Heart ailments to knee replacements, nothing stops these senior citizens

From Vadodara and Ahmedabad, a small band of 70-plus Indians is rewriting the script of retirement - skydiving, scuba diving, bungee jumping, even trekking across Antarctica's frozen expanse.Gautam Kothari, 74, has lost vision in one eye. His wife Beena, 72, cannot walk long distances. Together, they have leapt from aircraft, plunged into oceans, and dangled over canyons. The Kotharis stood at the edge of the world in polar cold. They cruised icy waters, met a lone lighthouse family in one of the planet's remotest outposts. In four years, they have travelled to 14 countries. Experiences many half their age postpone for ""someday"". ""In 2022, we leapt out of the skies in Russia,"" Gautam said. ""Icy wind hit us. Earth below looked fascinating. Neither of us was nervous even for a moment.""New Zealand followed. A bungee jump in 2024. Then Egypt. The Red Sea. Scuba diving. ""My family warned me about pressure on my heart,"" Gautam said. ""But I was adamant about seeing the underwater world.""They have chased auroras in Iceland. Drifted above Egypt in a hot-air balloon. Stayed in Indonesia's rainforests. Watched gorillas in Uganda. Glided over a frozen Siberian lake. Every detail planned by hand. Destinations. Flights. Rooms. Routes. ""We do everything ourselves,"" Beena said.Another Amdavadi couple follows that rhythm. Deval Thakor, 77, and his wife Daksha, 76, took on Antarctica after earning the label of ""senior citizens"". They skydived in California too. ""Age is just a number,"" Thakor said. ""Journeys matter more than possible hardships.""Then there are Nautam Vakil, 78, and his wife Neeta, 82. Neeta's knee replacement did not stop them from taking the Alpine Tour in Japan this year. ""We believe in living with high spirits,"" Vakil said.Back in Vadodara, Gautam still runs an industrial electrical products business. For the couple, travel feeds curiosity. ""We want to live every moment,"" Gautam said, adding, ""Meet new people. Explore different cuisines.""The bucket list remains unfinished. Namibia's desert is next for the Kotharis. Egypt and Jordan await the Thakors, after they ""travelled from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and from Kutch to Arunachal Pradesh in our car"". Time keeps moving. The Kotharis, Vakils and Thakors move faster.","Gautam Kothari, 74, has lost vision in one eye. His wife Beena, 72, cannot walk long distances.

Heavy traffic blamed for delay

CHITRADURGA/BENGALURU: The passengers who escaped the bus fire after a collision with a truck near Hiriyur, Karnataka, in the early hours of Thursday said surviving the flames was only the first battle; the second was the long wait in the bitter night cold for medical help.While three passengers in the sleeper coach survived serious wounds including burns, 25 others suffered minor injuries. Most passengers were asleep when the crash jolted them awake. Thick smoke quickly filled the bus, leaving many gasping for breath. With no time to think, several passengers kicked open windows and jumped out of the burning vehicle, sustaining injuries as flames engulfed the bus behind them.Hemaraj, who was travelling with his wife Kalpana and eight-year-old son to Gokarna, said: ""We were in deep sleep. I suddenly felt something falling on my head from above. When I looked around, everything was dark and filled with smoke. I realised a fire had broken out, and I immediately pushed my son out through the window. Then my wife jumped. I looked towards the back of the bus and heard people crying for help and shouting in panic. By then, the fire had reached us. I had no choice but to jump out through the window,"" he said.For many passengers who escaped, panic soon turned into anger.""We were alive, but in pain. We were shivering in the cold, injured, with the bus still burning in front of us. There was no ambulance,"" Varun, a techie travelling on the bus, told TOI.According to the survivors, despite repeated calls to emergency numbers, the first ambulance reached the spot nearly an hour and half later. Two more ambulances arrived only between 3.40am and 4am. ""The passengers were crying for help. We had burns and fractures, standing in the cold, waiting. There was no quick response at all,"" another survivor said. Manjunath M, who suffered nearly 70% burns, faced a harrowing time while waiting to be shifted to the hospital.Several passengers pointed out that firefighters reached the site within 20 minutes, but medical help lagged far behind. As the survivors waited in pain, it was locals who became first responders.Ritish Kumar, a private firm driver who rushed to the spot after learning of the crash, said he called his friends from Gayatri Jalashaya Sangha to help.""Firefighters came quickly, and along with locals, we tried to pull people out... We helped them escape,"" he said. With ambulances still missing, locals eventually helped shift the injured to Hiriyur and Shira govt hospitals once vehicles arrived.The drivers of the ambulances which reached the accident spot maintained that they got delayed because of a massive traffic jam on the highway. ""With vehicle movements coming to a standstill on the highway after the crash, we took a long time to reach the spot. The traffic extended up to around 3 km,"" one of the ambulance drivers said.","Three passengers in the sleeper coach survived serious wounds including burns, 25 others suffered minor injuries.

Virat Kohli's childhood coach makes a big statement on 2027 ODI World Cup

INSPIRED BY

AXAR PATEL

NEW DELHI: Vishal Jayswal was an unknown name until he claimed the most prized wicket of his cricketing career — Virat Kohli - a dismissal that instantly etched his name into the record books.Jayswal tempted Kohli out of the crease, spinning the ball sharply past the outside edge and the wicketkeeper made no mistake and whipped off the bails to send the well-set Delhi batter back for 77.While Gujarat narrowly lost the thriller by seven runs, the moment belonged to the young spinner, who was embraced by teammates for his unforgettable breakthrough.As the rest of the Gujarat players headed back to the dressing room, Jayswal lingered. He requested the umpire for the match ball — the one with which he had dismissed Kohli.Ball in hand, he nervously walked towards the Delhi dressing room. Spotting Kohli, he hesitated. Kohli noticed him, smiled, and said: “Aaja, aaja” (Come in).A nervous Jayswal pulled the ball out of his pocket and said: “Bhaiya, ball pe ek autograph chahiye” (Please give me an autograph).Kohli put his kit aside, asked Jayswal to sit down, and made him comfortable before signing the ball.“Achha ball daalta hai. Hard work karta rah. Opportunity aayega, wait kar and mehnat kar [You bowl really well. Keep working hard.Your opportunity will come — be patient and keep putting in the effort],” Kohli told him.Jayswal admitted the pressure of bowling to a modern day great.“I didn’t have any specific plan against him. He’s a legend of the game. Just bowling to him is a huge moment, and there’s immense pressure when he’s at the crease. I spoke to him and he gave me a lot of tips, how to remain calm under pressure, fitness etc,” Jayswal said, during an exclusive chat with TimesofIndia.com.“Of course, I’m really happy to have dismissed him. Having a wicket like that next to your name is very special,” the spin allrounder said.Like Axar Patel, Jayswal hails from Nadiad in Gujarat’s Kheda district and began his cricket journey at the same academy where Team India’s T20I vice-captain took his first steps.Jayswal lost his father when he was just eight months old.As he grew older, cricket became his passion, and he told his mother of his dream to become a professional cricketer. The road was far from easy, but his mother stood firmly by him.“The journey was extremely tough, but whatever I am today is because of my mother,” said Jayswal, who finished as the highest wicket-taker in the 2022–23 CK Nayudu Trophy.“Taking her to the awards function was one of the proudest moments of my life.”According to Jayswal, Axar has played a crucial role in shaping his career.“Axar bhai has helped me immensely — from my cricket kit to jerseys and bats. I look up to him as an inspiration and mentor,” he said.“I’ve always wanted to be a spin-bowling all-rounder like him. He teaches me how to be a game-changer — when to attack, how to control the run rate, and how to stay mentally strong.”Recalling Axar’s advice, Jayswal added with a smile: “He always tells me: ‘Batting mein dhyaan sirf ball pe rakho, aur bowling mein batsman ke pair aur wickets pe.’ Those tips have helped me a lot.”",Virat Kohli's childhood coach makes a big statement on 2027 ODI World Cup.

Sugar Ray Leonard’s overall net worth in 2025, boxing earnings, and legacy

Bernadette Robi and their combined financial picture

Sugar Ray Leonard is more than just a name in the history books. He is a standard by which many fighters’ achievements are still measured to this day. Sugar Ray Leonard is an Olympic legend and Hall of Famer who stunned the world of boxing through his electrifying performances in the 1970s and 1980s and translated his style and agility into wealth, which is still being enjoyed today through his astute business ventures outside of his fighting days of swinging punches and dodging others.Already in 2025, his achievement is as widely celebrated in wealth circles as it once was in boxing rings that resounded to roaring crowds of supporters and fans loyal to Sugar Ray Leonard and his illustrious career in the ring, his achievements and path to success in and outside that ring, and his life after boxing with his loving wife, Bernadette Robi Leonard.At the end of 2025, the net worth of the boxing legend, Sugar Ray Leonard, stands at an estimated 120 million dollars, and this treasure trove has been accumulated through his boxing purses, endorsements, public speaking, and lucrative investments. Long before the days when sportspeople even began to speak about extending their brands for financial gain, Sugar Ray Leonard began to redefine the financial rule book for boxers. He became the very first boxer to take home more than 100 million dollars in his heyday.His Hall of Fame career has been marked by world championships in five weight divisions, as well as his legendary fights against the likes of Roberto Duran, Thomas Hearns, and Marvin Hagler, pitting him not merely against a generation, but also lining his pockets with lucrative sums of money.After his active career, he did not just melt into the sunset longingly, but carved himself a niche as a sports commentator for HBO, NBC, and more, a speaker, television personality.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.Leonard has leveraged fame to produce returns on his investment as well, real estate investments that include his dearly-loved villa in the Pacific Palisades and earn residual income from contracts related to his publications, speaking events, and licensing deals that see his name and face popping up every corner of the globe .Bernadette Robi, Leonard’s wife since 1993, has a quieter but very important role in this joint life. A former model, she is his lifelong companion and has her own net worth, which is quite small at $500,000, but she is also the joint manager of theirs.Robi has been able to parlay the Sugar Ray Leonard Foundation into a platform where the foundation’s mission of juvenile diabetes research and relevant projects is combined with their popularity. Currently, the combined net worth of the couple in the year 2025 is estimated at around $120 million, largely due to Sugar Ray’s earnings through boxing and other contracts, but also as a result of the lifestyle choices they make in their lives.Also Read: Mike Tyson confirms timing and location for Floyd Mayweather Jr exhibition fight","At the end of 2025, the net worth of the boxing legend, Sugar Ray Leonard, stands at an estimated 120 million dollars.

Maple Leafs face midseason challenge with consistency and leadership under pressure

Elliotte Friedman talks Connor McDavid, Kirill Kaprizov and more.

The Toronto Maple Leafs face a difficult few games beginning this week. The performance of this team has not been very consistent recently, and raises some questions as to how consistent they can remain going forward. The added importance of each game helps to make the ability for the Leafs to bounce back from poor performances over the next couple of weeks something everyone will be paying attention to.Sportsnet’s Elliotte Friedman was blunt ahead of the short break, warning that the Maple Leafs are headed towards a lot of very uncomfortable conversations if they don’t sort this out. His comment highlights the immediate need for the team to fix their inconsistencies and strengthen leadership on the ice and in the locker room.The team is now under greater scrutiny than ever, amid NHL playoff pressure, with respect to leadership, performance and accountability. Outside of a few defensive breakdowns, inconsistent goaltending, poor special team, and a lack of consistency in their top forward lines; it has been evident that many areas of concern will need immediate attention by this team. In all likelihood, coaches will need to look at making changes in their tactical strategy, line combinations and roles for their players in order to create the balance and consistency that is needed to be a successful team.Very few of the top forwards have been able to find the chemistry that is needed to build a consistent top line, and many pairs of defense have had difficulties keeping the opposing teams to a minimum in scoring chances. Every game is magnified even more than before, thus forcing the management to make some difficult decisions behind the scenes in order to maintain or prevent a downfall from occurring.The execution of plays on the ice will be very critical. Players must focus all their efforts on playing to the best of their ability, while coaches should concentrate on the tactical adjustments made to apply them correctly during each play. Leadership from within the locker room will dictate how well the players hold each other accountable and continue to build the structure of the organization as they grow together.If not addressed quickly, the Maple Leafs could face a difficult stretch. How the team performs in the coming games will determine whether they can regain stability and build momentum for the rest of the season. Elliotte Friedman has emphasized Maple leafs to act quickly to improve consistency and reinforce accountability among players if they hope to avoid a midseason slide.Also Read: Phillip Danault trade rumors: Elliotte Friedman weighs in on LA Kings center amid slow NHL season","Sportsnet’s Elliotte Friedman was blunt ahead of the short break, warning that the Maple Leafs are headed towards a lot of very uncomfortable conversations if they don’t sort this out.

Travis Kelce has spent more than a decade taking hits on NFL fields, but lately, some of the biggest changes in his life are happening far from the stadium, inside the kitchen he now shares with Taylor Swift.During a festive episode of New Heights, the Kansas City Chiefs star offered fans an unexpectedly intimate look at how their relationship has reshaped his routines, habits, and even his health. What started as a shared love of cooking has evolved into something deeper, revealing a softer, more grounded side of the Super Bowl champion as he prepares for life beyond football.Travis Kelce revealed that one of his favorite recent moments with Taylor Swift came from a surprisingly practical Christmas gift: a bread slicer. He explained that he bought it because Swift has “been throwing together so much sourdough,” a hobby that has quickly become central to their home life.The gift wasn’t just thoughtful, it was symbolic of how much time they now spend cooking together and paying attention to what they eat.That shift, Kelce admitted, has had real benefits. He credited Swift’s cooking for helping him eat cleaner and feel better overall, joking proudly, “Gosh, I’ve got the best gut health there is.I love you, Tay.” For an elite athlete known for his durability, the comment struck a chord with fans who see it as another sign of how supportive and practical their partnership has become.Jason Kelce chimed in with his own seal of approval, noting that “slicing is a big deal,” especially when it comes to fresh bread.

Maxx Crosby met Rachel Washburn in Eastern Michigan University

Rachel Washburn stood by Maxx Crosby in his journey from alcohol addiction to sobriety

The 28-year-old star defensive end for the Las Vegas Raiders, Maxx Crosby , was recently ruled out of the Week 17 game against the New York Giants due to a lingering knee injury. He was unhappy with the decision.As NFL Insider Jay Glazer put it: The Raiders told Maxx Crosby they want to shut him down for the last two games. Crosby, who has played with injuries for much of the year, vehemently disagreed and has left the building, @nflonfox has learned. This could lead to questions about his future in Vegas.Crosby is going through a lot right now, but his steady support at home, his wife Rachel Washburn [now Crosby], will perhaps help calm his nerves since she understands what being a competitive player means. Let’s learn more about Rachel, the former soccer player and star athlete of the Eastern Michigan Eagles. But first, how did they meet?Maxx met Rachel while they attended Eastern Michigan University in 2016. Rachel was a star collegiate soccer player, and Maxx was building his football career. He was drafted in 2019. They started dating in college and stayed together through every change in Crosby’s career. They married in a lavish Nevada wedding in Boulder City in March 2023. They have a three-year-old daughter, Ella Rose Crosby, whom Crosby calls his “world.”The NFL WAG’s full name is Rachel Rose Washburn. She is the daughter of Mark and Trisha Washburn and has one brother, Chad, and one sister, Ashley. Rachel was a star on the soccer field. She led her Hartland High School soccer team to a district championship as team captain in her senior year.She was named Defensive Player of the Year all four years in high school and was a Hartland Eagle scholar athlete.The mom-of-one also accumulated all-district, all-county, and all-conference [Kensington Lakes Athletic Association] honors during her high school days. She later entered Eastern Michigan University, where she was named to the Loyola Invitational All-Tournament Team in 2015. She recorded career-high stats in her final year as an Eagle. She graduated from the University in 2017. She shone on the soccer gridiron as well as in the classroom. She majored in Sports Management.Five years ago, as his NFL career was beginning, Crosby reportedly became addicted to alcohol, and Rachel helped him through the darker days. “She’s my rock,” Crosby told PEOPLE in February 2025. “I wouldn’t be here without her. I was living a wild life, a fast life, and addiction is real.It’s a disease, something that was hard on me. At the end of the day, you always hear people say you can’t change, people don’t change, they are who they are. I firmly believe that’s so false. You’ve got to be able to go through hard times if you really want it.If you really want to be together, you have to go through hell and back. We’ve both been through a lot together, but it only made us stronger. I had to go to a dark place and live through it. It made me so much stronger and a better person.I love the person I am, and the person I look in the mirror and see now, and I wasn’t able to say that when I was younger, going through what I went through, and that means more than anything.”In March 2025, Crosby marked five years sober and thanked his “partner in crime,” wife Rachel, who helped him emerge victorious.Also Read: NFL legend and Las Vegas Raiders part-owner Tom Brady supposedly passed over Shedeur Sanders for being “very self-promotional”","Rachel Washburn is the wife of Las Vegas Raiders star defensive end Maxx Crosby.

Wayne Gretzky’s most famous cars: From Porsche to Rolls-Royce

Wayne Gretzky's WIFE, Children, House, Cars, Net Worth 2024 and More

Wayne Gretzky's wide range of vehicle collection, luxury cars, very few supercars, and performance units showed the same accuracy and elegance that characterized his superb NHL career. Although Wayne Gretzky was never a person to flaunt his lifestyle, reports coming from very reliable sources state that he once had a collection of luxury cars that more than quietly became the icons of the automotive world. Every automobile associated with The Great One mirrored the exceptionality, story, and very strong personal touch instead of ostentatious luxury.Unlike many famous people, Wayne Gretzky was very particular about the cars in his garage. He did not use up a lot of vehicles; instead, he picked the ones that had the attributes of art, power, and historical importance. These cars underwent a transfer of ownership from time to time, but always found their way back to the auction houses because their asking price would be instantly elevated due to the connection with the most popular name in hockey.The 1989 Porsche 911 Turbo Cabriolet was one of the first highpoints and the one that Wayne Gretzky bought brand new.The car was painted in Linen Grey Metallic with the complete grey leather interior and became famous when Wayne Gretzky signed the passenger-side sun visor. Automotive auction sources later confirmed its presence at the Barrett-Jackson Scottsdale auction before it went online, where its mileage and condition kept attracting collectors.Luxury cars came in when the 2005 Bentley Continental GT, which was finished in Ebony Black and later coated in custom matte black, was the next to enter the scene. Reports from the industry have it that the car by Dirty Bird Concepts underwent nearly $60,000 worth of upgrades, which included custom wheels and was thus rendered as one of the most visually attractive Bentley models attached to a sports celebrity.Performance lovers often mention Gretzky's possession of two Ford GT Heritage Edition models from 2006 as the ultimate proof of his performance orientation. They both had the famous Gulf Oil colors and the number 99, which stood for Wayne Gretzky jersey. As per the listings from RM Sotheby’s and Bring a Trailer, one of the cars was sold in 2023 for more than $500,000, and the other did not meet the reserve price despite receiving a very high bid.The 1993 Rolls-Royce Corniche Convertible remains the most iconic car, a present from the ex-owner of the team, Bruce McNall, after Wayne Gretzky had exceeded the NHL's all-time goal record. When this car was again sold in 2024, it was priced at over a million, thus securing its status as a legend.Wayne Gretzky’s car collection was not measured by the number of cars—it was the legacy that was important. Each car represented a story of success, moderation, and classy quality, perfectly describing the career of The Great One. His automotive choices reflected restraint, heritage, and enduring excellence beyond hockey.Also Read: Cale Makar net worth 2025: NHL achievements, Career, contracts, prize money, endorsements and more","The 1989 Porsche 911 Turbo Cabriolet was one of the first highpoints and the one that Wayne Gretzky bought brand new.

Brayan Bello draws trade interest despite Red Sox extension



“We have to be ready to move players under control if it helps the roster,”

Brayan Bello is suddenly at the center of MLB trade talk as rival teams call the Boston Red Sox to ask about his availability. At the same time, the Toronto Blue Jays are pushing hard to land Kyle Tucker, with more big-name decisions possibly coming next. League chatter picked up this week as front offices across baseball looked ahead to a busy offseason.Brayan Bello’s name popping up has surprised many fans because Boston just locked him up last year. Still, league insiders say teams are watching closely. Toronto, meanwhile, is not hiding its plans. The Blue Jays want a star who can change the lineup, and Kyle Tucker sits right at the top of their wish list.According to The Athletic reporters Will Sammon and Ken Rosenthal, multiple rival teams have contacted the Boston Red Sox about Brayan Bello in recent weeks.The report made it clear the calls came from other teams, not from Boston shopping the pitcher. In March 2024, the Red Sox signed Brayan Bello to a six-year, $55 million extension.The deal also includes a $21 million club option for the 2030 season and a $1 million buyout. During the 2025 season, Bello posted a 3.35 ERA and threw a career-high 166.2 innings, making him one of Boston’s most reliable starters.Earlier this year, Red Sox chief baseball officer Craig Breslow said the team would stay open-minded if tough decisions were needed.Breslow said at the time. If Boston doubts Bello’s long-term production, they could listen more closely, especially if the return helps fill other needs.According to MLB insider Jon Heyman, the Toronto Blue Jays remain very interested in Kyle Tucker.Tucker visited the team’s facility in Dunedin, Florida, a few weeks ago, which only fueled speculation. ESPN projections suggest Tucker could command a massive 11-year, $418 million contract.Toronto is also looking at one more big bat. Reports say the Blue Jays are weighing a move for either Bo Bichette or Alex Bregman.Bo Bichette is a homegrown star who plays the middle infield, while Bregman brings steady power and defense at third base. Both offer similar offensive value, but the fit and cost could decide the final call.Also Read: MLB Trade Rumors: MLB Insiders Predicting Kazuma Okamoto Could Surpass $34 Million Murakami Deal As Orioles Eye JoJo Romero","Brayan Bello is suddenly at the center of MLB trade talk as rival teams call the Boston Red Sox to ask about his availability.

Christian Watson’s availability could impact Packers’ Week 17 game against Ravens



Christian Watson’s name on the Green Bay Packers’ final injury report raised eyebrows, but the situation isn’t quite as alarming as it first looked. The wide receiver was listed as questionable ahead of Saturday night’s matchup against the Baltimore Ravens, yet his status isn’t tied to a new injury concern. Instead, Watson has simply been dealing with an illness that kept him out of Thursday’s practice.The Packers have had a bug working its way through the locker room this week, and Watson just happened to be the latest to feel it. Because his absence came midweek, he still had time to recover before kickoff. Illness can always be unpredictable, but it’s usually easier to manage than something like a soft-tissue setback this late in the season. Green Bay will get final clarity when the inactives are released at 6:30 p.m. ET, but internally there’s far less panic than a typical injury designation might create.For Green Bay, Watson’s availability matters. He remains a reliable target when healthy and gives the offense a vertical threat they don’t easily replace. With Jordan Love already ruled out due to concussion protocol, the Packers will turn to backup quarterback Malik Willis, and surrounding him with as many playmakers as possible becomes essential against a tough Baltimore defense.Watson’s presence stretches coverage, creates spacing, and forces the Ravens to respect the deep ball, which naturally helps the run game and underneath routes.From a bigger-picture standpoint, the Packers aren’t playing with desperation. They’ve already locked in a playoff berth, which takes away some anxiety around availability decisions. Even so, these final regular-season games still matter. Green Bay can improve playoff seeding with a strong finish, and having Watson on the field gives them a better chance of doing that. It’s a balance between managing health and competing to strengthen postseason positioning.So while the headline of “questionable” might have initially sounded worrying, this is closer to routine late-season maintenance than crisis territory. If the illness clears in time, Watson should be able to suit up and contribute. If not, the decision will simply be about keeping him fresh for when the games truly count, but for now, this feels like a situation trending more toward manageable than problematic.Also Read: Is Christian Watson playing in week 16 vs the Bears?

How much Robert Kraft's assets are worth

How much Gayle Benson's assets are worth

How their wealth stack up

Also Read:

Robert Kraft and Gayle Benson are two of the NFL's most prominent owners. They are also two of the richest persons in all of American sports. They both own well-known franchises and have a lot of authority, but the ways they made their money and became rich are very different. Here's a closer look at how their net worths compare and what makes their billion-dollar businesses unique.With a net worth of $13 billion, Robert Kraft is one of the richest owners in professional sports. He made a lot of money before he played football. He got through the Kraft Group, which is a holding company that owns businesses in sports, real estate, private equity, and paper and packaging.Robert Kraft paid $172 million for the New England Patriots in 1994. At the time, it was the most money ever spent for an NFL franchise. During the time he owned the Patriots, they created a modern dynasty, winning six Super Bowls with Tom Brady and Bill Belichick. That success over time made the franchise worth a lot more, putting it toward the top of the NFL.The New England Revolution is a Major League Soccer team owned by Kraft. He also owns important real estate, such as Gillette Stadium and the developments around it.He has also spent a lot of money on famous entertainment and media companies. These assets make sure that Kraft's wealth isn't just focused on how well the team does, but also on a lot of other things that are vital for the company's long-term prosperity.With a net worth of $7.9 billion, Gayle Benson is one of the richest women in the world who owns sports clubs. She got famous after her husband Tom Benson died in 2018 and she took over leadership of the New Orleans Saints (NFL) and New Orleans Pelicans (NBA).Gayle Benson, on the other hand, didn't make most of her money from huge firms like Kraft did. She has a lot of money since she owns franchises, makes wise investments, and has a background in interior design and property remodeling, which helped her launch her business. She also puts money into enterprises like Dixie Brewing Company and horse racing with thoroughbreds.Benson has told the Saints and the Pelicans to focus on stability, community ties, and preparation for the long run. This has kept their values high even when things have altered on the field.Robert Kraft has a big financial advantage because his net worth is around $5 billion more than Gayle Benson's. Kraft has an advantage because he has been growing in the private sector for decades and has a lot of investments outside of sports. Benson, on the other hand, is part of a newer group of owners whose wealth is more closely tied to the value of their franchises and their historical assets.Kraft and Benson are two of the most well-known owners in the NFL, yet their money is different. Kraft's empire shows how to plan for the future and how big a corporation can go. Benson's fortune shows how to pass on wealth and take care of it. They all indicate that there are many different paths to reach to the top of owning a professional sports franchise.","Robert Kraft and Gayle Benson are two of the NFL's most prominent owners.

Toronto Maple Leafs get much-needed defensive relief as Chris Tanev makes impactful comeback against Pittsburgh Penguins,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/toronto-maple-leafs-get-much-needed-defensive-relief-as-chris-tanev-makes-impactful-comeback-against-pittsburgh-penguins/articleshow/126205540.cms,"Toronto finds defensive relief with Chris Tanev back in action (Image via: Getty Images)

Chris Tanev ’s return helps Toronto Maple Leafs regain defensive control



Tanev stretchered off after awkward hit - Full Incident

The Toronto Maple Leafs went into the holiday break under tension, carrying the weight of a rough few weeks and a major coaching move. Five losses in six games had turned up the pressure, and the firing of assistant coach Marc Savard only added to the noise around the team. They badly needed something to steady the room.Their 6–3 win over the Pittsburgh Penguins offered that bit of relief. More importantly, it marked the return of veteran defenseman Chris Tanev, who came back from injury and immediately gave Toronto something they had been missing: calm, predictable defending. Even with a little rust, he made the game feel manageable again for the team around him.Tanev didn’t come back trying to do too much. He simply played the kind of hockey he’s known for: strong positioning, smart first passes, and clear decisions in the defensive zone. That helped Joseph Woll settle in as well, and his 29 saves looked more comfortable than what Toronto’s goalies have faced in recent weeks. For head coach Craig Berube, it meant having a defense group that finally had structure. He could sit Simon Benoit, lean on Philippe Myers when needed, and, most importantly, trust that Tanev would handle tough minutes without turning games chaotic.The win sends Toronto into the break with a little positivity, but the bigger picture remains challenging.Their record sits at 16-15-5, last in the Atlantic Division and 15th in the Eastern Conference. They are still within reach of a playoff spot, just five points back, but progress now depends not only on their own performances but also on other teams stumbling. That’s not the most comfortable position to be in.Tanev had been out since November 1, and during his absence, Toronto went 9-10-4. There was no one in-house, and likely no one available on the trade market, who could replace what he brings: low-event hockey, stability, and a veteran’s understanding of when to slow things down. He’s 36 and not the star of the franchise, but he is important to how this team functions.The win over Pittsburgh doesn’t erase the questions around Toronto’s season. What it does show, though, is how different the Maple Leafs look when they have structure at the back. Right now, Chris Tanev is a big part of keeping that hope alive.Also Read: Chris Tanev discusses return as Toronto Maple Leafs defeat Pittsburgh Penguins in NHL action","Toronto Maple Leafs beat Pittsburgh Penguins 6-3 in their final game before the holiday break.

Rocky Johnson’s wrestling career and income insights

Rocky Johnson and Dwayne Johnson’s complex son and father relationship details

Rocky Johnson's wrestling journey was characterized not only by great achievements but also by huge money. He started his career in the late 1960s under the name “Soul Train” and, before the end of the decade, with just a bit of luck, he had already gotten on the map from local venues to the National Wrestling Alliance and then the World Wrestling Federation in 1973. Although the professional legacy of Rocky Johnson is admired, the personal relationship with his son was very complicated. Dwayne Johnson has told the truth about the difficulties of being a child of his father, with the strict discipline and love he called tough love.Rocky Johnson was known for his physical skills and charisma, and his collection of major titles included the NWA Georgia Heavyweight Championship and the NWA Television Championship two times. His most significant victory came in 1983 when he won the WWF Tag Team Championship, which made him part of the first Black champions in WWE history, and he was the one who got the ball rolling in professional wrestling.At first, Rocky discouraged his son from becoming a wrestler since he was afraid of the difficulties that the industry would entail. However, The Rock later became his father’s successor, one of the most successful wrestlers and entertainers in the world.The Rock stated that he and his father had a huge disagreement in late 2019, only a few weeks before Rocky died. Their arguments became one of the biggest fights that they had, and it left them estranged when Rocky passed away. This painful situation is something that The Rock has to live with and he has spoken about his regret of not having made up with his father before his father’s unexpected death.For Dwayne Johnson, his father’s death was not only the loss of a dad but also the recalling of disputes that were not dealt with.

The 2025 NBA season will be remembered not just for the great on-court games but also for some highly controversial moments. From serious legal controversies to the in-game ones, the big league found itself in some of the most unexpected moments that quickly grabbed the spotlight, for the reasons that the fans will be discussing for years to come.Some of these moments tested the league’s values. Even though a game where trash talk is going on regularly, it is a game of pride and integrity, and with the controversies going on, it really questions the morality that the league aims to hold on to. Below are 5 of the most controversial moments that the NBA witnessed in 2025.The Luka Doncic and Anthony Davis trade became the most talked-about and one of the most controversial NBA moments of 2025, because of how unexpected it was for the fans. Luka Doncic was a star player of the Dallas Mavericks, who led them to the Finals in the 2024-25 NBA regular season. And Anthony Davis, on the other hand, is a ten-time NBA All-Star who also won an NBA championship with the Los Angeles Lakers. So, the trade was quite emotional for the fans of both players to witness and came as a shock to them.Fans all over social media were raging with anger. But the heat of the moment came, and the situation became even more controversial when the fans of the Dallas Mavericks started protesting openly against the Mavericks’ general manager, Nico Harrison.“Fire Nico”, the fans chanted, as they continued protesting against this sudden decision to trade the players.Another major controversial moment in the 2025 NBA season occurred during a game between the Brooklyn Nets and the Indiana Pacers in March 2025, when a sudden on-court fight broke out between Andrew Nembhard and Trendon Watford, and quickly escalated into a physical fight, eventually involving other players like Myles Turner. This incident quickly grabbed public attention and led to fouls and fines by the big league, raising questions of growing on-court aggression.The 2025 NBA gambling scandal is one of the most controversial incidents, and it came to light with the U.S. federal authorities accusing more than 30 people connected to the big league of being involved in illegal gambling activities. It immediately tensed up the whole situation and raised questions of whether games were being played fairly. Among those accused and arrested were the Miami Heat guard, Terry Rozier, and Chauncey Billups, who is the head coach of the Portland Trail Blazers.They were mainly accused of sharing inside information and earning money through it. Following the arrests, the NBA put the two on leave and agreed to cooperate with the authorities to further investigate the matter. It became a controversial matter of discussion even among the fans as it quickly raised questions about the authenticity of the big league.Chris Paul previously played for the Los Angeles Clippers from 2011 to 2017. In 2024, Paul joined the San Antonio Spurs as a free agent for the 2024-25 NBA regular season, and he continued with the Spurs that whole season and even signed a one-year contract worth $11 million with the team. After the end of that season, Paul again became a free agent and signed a $3.6 million contract with the Los Angeles Clippers in the summer of 2025. Even though Paul is a 12-time All-Star, however, at the start of the season, he was seen struggling on court, averaging only 2.9 points.And thus came the reports of tension between him and the Clippers head coach, Tyronn Lue. In early December 2025, Paul one morning announced on his Instagram that he had just found out that the Clippers were planning on parting ways with him. Shortly after, the Clippers officially confirmed the news that they were sending Paul home. This sparked intense reactions from fans and followers over social media as they were shocked by this decision. It became a controversial matter as former teammates voiced their support for Paul openly, as they felt the entire situation was quite disappointing.In December 2025, during a Golden State Warriors game against the Orlando Magic, Draymond Green left the game midway and stormed into the locker room, which happened as he missed a ball on a turnover. This was followed by an argument between him and the Warriors coach, Steve Kerr. And following this incident, Green headed back to the locker room.As he returned to the courtside after cooling off for a bit, he was seen sitting on the bench. And even though the Warriors ended up winning that match, this incident caught public attention and became a matter of controversy even among the fans, who talked more about Green’s sudden exit from the game instead of celebrating the Warriors’ win.Also Read: 5 Best NBA Christmas games of all time","The 2025 NBA season will be remembered not just for the great on-court games but also for some highly controversial moments.

In NBA, the action doesn't stop at the hardwood. While the athletes provide the high-flying dunks and clutch threes, the front row seats provide culture. Courtside seats have become the ultimate status symbol, offering an elite experience to the cream of the crop. In 2017, a buyer paid $133K, booking two floor seats for the NBA finals Game 5 between the Warriors and Cavaliers.These aren't just casual observers looking for a photo op, they are ""superfans"" who schedule filming around the playoffs, engage in psychological warfare with opposing guards, and, in some cases, hold official titles within the front office. They range from the legendary Hollywood stars, business tycoons, and musical icons. As we look at the landscape in late 2025, these six faces remain the pillars of NBA fandom.Jack Nicholson remains the undisputed celebrity superfan. ""Grandfather of Courtside."" While 2025 has seen the 88-year-old legend become more selective with his appearances, the Crypto.com Arena still feels different when Jack is in his signature seat near the visiting bench.Wearing his trademark sunglasses indoors, Nicholson has been a consistent ticket holder since the 1970s, and his love and dedication for Lakers was shown through his ""no filming during Lakers home games"" clause in his movie contracts.Spike Lee’s love for the Knicks stemmed from his younger days when his father, Bill, would take him to watch the NBA games at the third Madison Square Garden, before its demolition in 1968. He also witnessed the 1970s decider Game 7 between Lakers and Knicks, where the Knicks won by 113-99 and the NBA championship by 4-3.Lee was often seen on the courtside, decked in orange and blue with custom sneakers and sunglasses. He doesn't just watch the game, he officiates it from the sidelines, along with his legendary “trash talking” that once riled up legends like Reggie Miller and now the younger players are subjected to it.Drake took his love for the Toronto Raptors to another level when he became their Global Ambassador. He has his ""OVO"" branded on Raptors’ team gear, practice facility, and exclusive collaboration with Lakers, Celtics, Bulls, and Knicks, blending sports, music, and fashion. Whether he’s playfully lint-rolling his pants or getting a technical foul or being warned about “the use of bad language,” Drake isn’t just another super fan, he has made Toronto the NBA’s coolest northern outpost.You might not know his name, but you’ve seen the textured hat. With his signature python skin outfits and long silver hair, Goldstein is the only fan on this list who doesn't claim a team. Instead, he’s a fan of the game. Attending 100 games per season, Goldstein spends a fortune on travel and tickets to ensure he has the best view of the league's history as it happens.Standing as the loudest ""little man"" in Philly, Kevin Hart is the only person to win four straight NBA Celebrity All-Star Game MVP (2012-2015). For Hart, every Sixers game is like a stand-up special, filled with his notorious chirping at superstars like Jimmy Butler and Draymond Green, often resulting in hilarious mid-game exchanges.Hart’s role expanded even further when he became the first-ever-on-court emcee for the 2024-25 NBA All-Star Game.The 2011 Hall of Famer has become the Lakers' most high-profile protector. Since moving his Club Shay Shay brand to LA, Sharpe’s courtside presence has become a viral event in itself. Whether he’s getting into heated debates with the Memphis Grizzlies' bench or dapping up Anthony Davis, Sharpe brings a former athlete’s intensity to the front row that few other celebrities can match.Also read: 5 headline grabbing and most talked about controversial moments in NBA in 2025","Jack Nicholson remains the undisputed celebrity superfan.

"Who is the highest paid player of the Toronto Blue Jays in 2025? Salary breakdown, bonuses, and contract details",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/who-is-the-highest-paid-player-of-the-toronto-blue-jays-in-2025-salary-breakdown-bonuses-and-contract-details/articleshow/126204607.cms,"Bo Bichette, Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Springer (Image Source: Getty)

Vladimir Guerrero Jr.: Swinging for the biggest salary

From base pay to bonus: Inside the contract breakdown

Within Major League Baseball, where contract durations range from several years and player pay scales well into newsworthy territory, Toronto Blue Jays management has assembled a team lineup that capitalizes on star performers and economical spending measures alike. For the year 2025, there is one player on the Blue Jays who stands apart from his fellow players not only within the lineup but on paper as well, his contract terms for 2025 and his upcoming long-term contract making him literally the income pulse of this team.While the Blue Jays are taking home wins and making playoff appearances, it is interesting to calculate their wager by examining their contracts and their bonuses. In some cases, no less than for Vladimir Guerrero Jr., who is more than just a seventh-inning stretch bat within this lineup, as it just so happens he is the team's most highly paid player for 2025.As of the 2025 season, Vladimir Guerrero Jr. currently takes home the highest salary on the Blue Jays with $28.5 million, which is the biggest individual salary for a Jays player for the year. Guerrero’s contract is based on an arbitration bypass agreement he had with the Jays, which sees him as one of the league’s highly-paid players for the season.Guerrero Jr.’s contract is quite impressive considering he is part of a lineup with other big stars such as George Springer, Kevin Gausman, and Bo Bichette, to mention just a few.This 2025 raise is more than just a number in a contract; it is part of Guerrero’s larger arc from hot prospect to franchise foundation, and of course, it is simply the setup to his massive extension. It was in April 2025 that Guerrero reached an agreement to sign a record-breaking 14-year, $500 million contract that kicks in 2026, making it one of the largest contracts ever signed in Major League Baseball. It includes an absolutely massive $325 million signing bonus with no deferred components, making his value every bit as liquid as it is speedy.Guerrero's $28.5 million salary in 2025 already makes him the highest-paid Blue Jay, but a lot more layers exist to his financial picture than just pay per annum. The long-term extension looming over his head, which will value him at more than half a billion dollars, changes his career earnings outlook dramatically. That huge contract includes a structured signing bonus paid over multiple seasons, with incentives tied to All-Star selections, MVP voting finishes, and Silver Slugger or Gold Glove awards-bonuses that could add meaningful sums if Guerrero continues performing at elite levels.Relatively speaking, other stars on the Blue Jays, including George Springer and Kevin Gausman, make large salaries - Springer in the mid-$20 million range and Gausman at just over $23 million, neither of which eclipses Guerrero's 2025 total.In a sport where money often follows success, the Blue Jays have placed their bet on Guerrero's bat and his long-term potential. Whether he continues to swing for the fences or chases history with Toronto, 2025 makes one thing clear: when it comes to payroll prestige in Toronto, Guerrero runs the bases and the books.Also Read: “He is a machine”: MLB insider breaks down why signing Bo Bichette is best move for Toronto Blue Jays","Vladimir Guerrero Jr. currently takes home the highest salary on the Blue Jays with $28.5 million, which is the biggest individual salary for a Jays player for the year.

The Chicago Bulls are back on track. The team started the season on a high note with back-to-back wins but lost the momentum midway. In between, the Bulls faced 7 back-to-back losses. This led the team to move out of the top 10 teams of the Eastern Conference. Now, once again, the team is back on track, racking up 5 consecutive wins. Their latest win was against the Philadelphia 76ers.With these recent wins, the team managed to occupy a spot as one of the top 10 teams in the conference. Coby White is currently leading the team with an average of 21.4 points. Following right after are Josh Giddey, Nikola Vucevic and Ayo Dosunmu. Giddey is the highlight of the team with one of the highest scoring averages, rebound averages and assist averages. If the Bulls manage to keep these wins consistent, the team has a high chance of edging the teams on top to enter the next stage.The Chicago Bulls are currently in ninth place in the Eastern Conference. Until last week, they were in the 11th spot. However, with consistent wins, the team managed to rank up. Currently, their win percentage is .500 and their differential stands at -2.9 points.The team really needs to improve their performance in order to increase their differential points. Their last five wins were against the Cleveland Cavaliers, the Atlanta Hawks and the Philadelphia 76ers.While in the case of most other teams, several players have been listed as questionable or out, in terms of the Bulls, only one player has been listed as out. It is Noa Essengue. In this aspect, the Bulls are at an advantage with their key players available to carry the team to their victories. Their next game is against the Milwaukee Bucks. The Bulls needs to maintain the winning consistency to qualify for the playoffs.The Detroit Pistons are still dominating the Eastern Conference. Their win-loss streak stands at 24-7. Right after are the New York Knicks with a 21-9 win-loss streak. The difference in their win percentage isn’t much. Instead, the Knicks are leading the conference in terms of their differential points, which is +7.0. It is a very close competition going on between the top 6 teams of the conference. The Chicago Bulls have a long way to go before reaching this group. However, their recent performance indicates a positive sign in this aspect.","The Chicago Bulls are currently in ninth place in the Eastern Conference.

A bond built through battles, titles, and belief

The Kansas City Chiefs saw one of their worst seasons ever with back-to-back losses, including the recent Christmas match, which eliminated them from the postseason. It has also created an uncertainty about Travis Kelce’s tenure, who has had one of the most iconic careers in franchise history. After the loss to the Denver Broncos, the Chiefs have clearly become vulnerable and at their weakest.However, Chiefs’ defensive tackle Chris Jones does not want Kelce to go off into the sunset any time soon. Kelce had a noticeable sense of reflection as he stepped out for his recent match, which further fueled the retirement rumors. With all the shared memories and experiences Jones has had with Kelce on the field, he made an emotional plea to stay for one more year with the team.Following the recent loss, the star defensive tackle addressed the growing speculation around Kelce’s future with raw honesty. “Damn, man. We’ve been through so much together,” Jones said. “I hope he gives it one year, just one more year. Just one more, man. Just one more.” Jones' love for Kelce and his importance to the team was clearly visible in his plea.Jones and Kelce have been pillars of the Chiefs’ championship era, surviving coaching changes, playoff heartbreaks, and three Super Bowl triumphs together.Their deep connection and camaraderie on the field has helped transform Kansas City into a modern NFL powerhouse. However, the Chiefs struggled with a lot of inconsistencies and strategic loopholes this season. .Kelce himself has avoided firm answers regarding his retirement. He addressed the media after the game, telling them that he would decide with his loved ones and the team as a whole regarding his future. Jones has now jumped on the bandwagon of people and fans who want Kelce to stay and continue delivering for the team.A game against the Raiders is all that remains before a long offseason clouded by a lot of uncertainty about the future.

Gautam Gambhir's year as India coach ends like it started - on a chaotic note

INDIAN CRICKET CRICKET IN 2025

Champions Trophy (ODIs, Dubai; Feb–Mar):

T20 Asia Cup (UAE; Sept):

Tests in England (Jun Aug):

Dressing-room unrest:

T20I dips:

No handshakes:

Test dips:

Chinnaswamy stampede:

What an odd, bewildering year this has been for the Indian men’s cricket team. While the women largely dominated the happy headlines and crafted a legacy-shaping, narrative-defining first World Cup win, we watched the men play in split screen mode in 2025.Between Champions Trophy glory and the brisk, bittersweet red-ball goodbyes from Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma came the rise of the new order, embodied by Shubman Gill’s fine run in England. And yet, running through it all was the constant hand-wringing and incessant tweaking of personnel by a team management which has often, from the outside, seemed mired in doubt.The defining feature of Indian cricket’s 2025 campaign was the overshadowing of some fine wins by the self-sabotaging of a proud home Test record.It was almost as if there were two Team Indias. One was the usually assured, monopolistic winning machine that is the white-ball setup, which will face its big test in the T20 World Cup early next year. The other was a confused jumble of a Test team which was undone by misplaced strategy: the quest to manufacture advantage on doctored, spinning pitches on home soil, a throwback-era move for which the largely inexperienced batters were completely ill-prepared.If there was a silver lining, it was that most of Indian cricket’s lows seemed avoidable to everyone but those involved in the decision making. If there was a warning bell, it was that the dismantling of a top Test side can take so little time. The scale of the two defeats to South Africa, in Kolkata and Guwahati, was staggering. Of course, India bounced back in style in the white-ball leg.The pitch, then, rose to become symbolic of India’s 2025 Test campaign. Queer it, and the team came undone. Play it straight, like on the batting-conducive surfaces in England, and the team thrived. It was an early promise of better times which unfortunately petered out by the end of the year. The England tour, where Gill rose to become the kind of match-shaping colossus he is expected to be, was eventually an aberration. The quiet home Test series win of the year, against the West Indies — Gill’s first as Test captain — too did not stick.The 12-year period during which India won every home Test series and built a fierce reputation is now a distant memory. In just over 12 months, the team has lost two out of three home series: a 0-3 loss to New Zealand, followed by the 0-2 drubbing against the well-prepared South Africans. The downslide started, as it turns out, with the appointment of Gautam Gambhir as head coach in July 2024.The Test defeats had a ripple effect — some much-needed intro spection — and an important course-correction followed in an other format. Gill, the anointed one, was dropped from the T20I side for poor form two months ahead of the World Cup. It was a late acknowledgment that in sport, as in life, narratives aren’t always constructed. Poster boys cannot always be manufactured on the field of play.Long-term sporting success is as much organic as strategic. The team management must adjust plans accordingly. Sides that seek to consistently dominate need an element of magic: a rare, ethereal quality that stems from talent and thrives on encouragement. Constant boardroom tinkering and incessant backroom analysis can often undermine this quality. Add to that the punishing cross-format scheduling and one wonders how Gill — who had a long run without a T20I fifty and seemed prone to injury — would have kept up with it all.There may be pressure from all sides to replace Kohli and Rohit’s aura with a new face, someone who can straddle easily across formats and make things easy for both the leadership group and the broadcasters. For now, though, Gill, the ODI and Test captain, will have to bide his time even as World Cup glory beckons the others in the T20 side.The rollback could be an important lesson for the men at the centre of all the attention: Gambhir and selection committee chief Ajit Agarkar. Both are proponents of flexibility and horses-for-courses strategies. Yet they have come across as surprisingly intractable — until the Gill move — when it comes to pushing their vision through.It is now clear that Gambhir, who is more of a public face than Agarkar, was brought in with the clear task of replacing under performing seniors and reshaping the side in his own image. He is yet to command the kind of public respect that his predecessors Ravi Shastri and Rahul Dravid did, and there could be a reason for that. Indians still tend to view the ideal coach as a stern, disciplinarian father figure, especially when it comes to shepherding a young team. As previous such misadventures have shown, with Greg Chappell here and Justin Langer in Australia, the move doesn’t always work out at the international level and only spurs chaos.As commitments end with the likes of Kohli and Rohit hammering inconsequential tons against hopelessly weaker sides in domestic List A games, it almost seems as if Indian cricket is back in the late 1990s. Whispers, innuendo, speculation and perceived agendas have again become talking points. Method and manipulation seem to go hand in hand.The T20 World Cup in the coming year could, however, showcase Gambhir at his strategic best in a format he is clearly more comfortable with. The team also has Abhishek Sharma, who had a standout year. For now, the Test side, having sunk to sixth in the World Test Championship table, can take a backseat. Gambhir and India will be hoping there will be good T20 times to come.HIGHSWon title with a 5–0 record after the 3–1 Test loss in Australia, that too without Bumrah.

In the Asia Cup, India declined to receive the trophy from ACC chief Mohsin Naqvi.

BGT lost 1-3. England series drawn 2-2; WI beaten 2-0. South Africa won first series in India in 25 years. India lost in Kolkata by 30 runs (India 93 chasing 124); in Guwahati by 408. Gambhir was criticised for upsetting team balance and opting for ‘average’ allrounders over specialists.After RCB’s first IPL title ended an 18-year wait, celebrations saw 11 dead and 56 injured as crowds swelled to upwards of 2.5 lakh people. BCCI criticised organisers and RCB executives were arrested. The Chinnaswamy was banned.","The defining feature of Indian cricket’s 2025 campaign was the overshadowing of some fine wins by the self-sabotaging of a proud home Test record. It was almost as if there were two Team Indias. One was the usually assured, monopolistic winning machine that is the white-ball setup, which will face its big test in the T20 World Cup early next year. The other was a confused jumble of a Test team undone by misplaced strategy.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126199127,imgsize-77094,width-400,resizemode-4/team-india-champions-trophy.jpg"

Gautam Gambhir's year as India coach ends like it started - on a chaotic note

(With inputs from AFP)

NEW DELHI: A total of 20 wickets tumbled on the opening day of the fourth Test between Australia and England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) on Friday, with Australia bowled out for 152 before dismissing England for just 110.The dramatic collapse on both sides sparked concern within Cricket Australia, with chief executive Todd Greenberg warning that shortened Tests were bad for business, even as several of the biggest names in the game criticised the condition of the MCG pitch.It was the highest number of wickets to fall on the first day of an Ashes Test since 1909, following the 19 wickets that fell on day one of the series opener in Perth.That match ended inside two days, costing Cricket Australia millions of dollars in lost revenue, and the Melbourne Test is also shaping up as a potential financial blow for the governing body.""I didn't sleep well last night, put it that way,"" Greenberg said on SEN radio after more than 94,000 packed into the MCG for Friday's first day.""It was an amazing day of Test cricket, so for that record number of people who were here, boy, they've had an experience.""But our challenge is to make sure we can continue those experiences day after day. That's the challenge for all of us.""The Melbourne pitch was prepared with 10 millimetres of grass on the wicket, making it heavily favourable for the bowlers with plenty of movement and bounce under overcast skies.Greenberg said a trend towards shorter Test matches was not in Cricket Australia's interest.""A simple phrase I'd use is short Tests are bad for business. I can't be much more blunt than that,"" he said.""So I would like to see a slightly broader balance between the bat and the ball.""A host of former greats have been critical of the Melbourne pitch with former England captain Michael Vaughan on Saturday calling it ""a joke"".""This is selling the game short,"" he added, while another ex-England skipper Alastair Cook branded it ""an unfair contest"".Curators in Australia are traditionally independent when it comes to preparing pitches, both from captains and Cricket Australia.Greenberg suggested a more interventionist approach might be needed.""It's hard not to get more involved when you see the impact on the sport, especially commercially, he said.""I'm not suggesting I'll go around talking to ground staff, but we do have to have a careful eye on what our expectations are over the course of a summer.""","A total of 20 wickets tumbled on the opening day of the fourth Test between Australia and England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

India T20 World Cup squad: In search of ideal combination, Agarkar & Co. drop Shubman Gill

Brief scores

BENGALURU: Age, they say, is merely a number. For proof, look no further than Virat Kohli The former India captain, who turned 37 last month, continues to defy the passage of time. With the bat, he still makes prolific youngsters look ordinary. In the field, his energy and intensity can outdo even the quickest. On Friday, at the BCCI Centre of Excellence here, it was vintage Kohli once again — only the opposition had changed.Less than 48 hours after opening Delhi’s Vijay Hazare Trophy campaign with a century against Andhra, Kohli returned to the middle, this time against Gujarat. Though he fell short of another three-figure score, stumped on 77 (61b; 13x4;1x6), his 81-minute stay at the crease was unmistakably Kohli — authoritative and brimming with control.His innings, combined with a mature knock from Rishabh Pant (70), laid the foundation for Delhi’s thrilling seven-run win. Fittingly, Kohli — who was scheduled to feature in only two matches — signed off from the tournament by pouching the winning catch, dismissing Ravi Bishnoi as Delhi sealed the contest. He was also named the man of the match.Asked to bat, Delhi posted a competitive 254/9 on a testing surface before bowling out Gujarat for 247 in 47.4 overs.At 213/6 in the 42nd over, Gujarat appeared to be in control, but a dramatic 47th over, which yielded two quick wickets, swung the momentum. As the chase tightened, Prince Yadav (3/37) delivered the final blow to close out the game.Earlier, Kohli was forced into action early after Chintan Gaja sent Priyansh Arya back in the second over. From then on, Kohli assumed command, dealing largely in boundaries. He looked in sublime touch, and a trademark on-drive off Arzan Nagwaswalla in the seventh over stood out as one of the shots of the day. The introduction of leg-spinner Bishnoi coincided with Kohli’s half-century, which he brought up in just 29 balls by slashing through the covers for four.Imperious and seemingly unstoppable, Kohli’s stay ended when he went down the track to left-arm spinner Vishal Jayswal (4/42) and missed, allowing wicketkeeper Urvil Patel to whip off the bails in a flash.At the other end, Pant, who last played an ODI in Aug last year, shelved his usual aggression for caution. Walking in with Delhi at 98/3, Pant focused on rebuilding. His half-century off 62 balls was highlighted by a clean strike off Bishnoi over long-on. His resistance ended on 70 (79 balls; 8 fours, 2 sixes) when he dropped to one knee to work Jayswal on the leg side, only to miss and see his stumps disturbed.Delhi: 254/9 in 50 overs (Virat Kohli 77, Rishabh Pant 70, Harsh Tyagi 40; Ravi Bishnoi 2-50, Vishal Jayswal 4-42)beats Gujarat: 247 in 47.4 overs (Aarya Desai 57, Urvil Patel 31, Abhishek Desai 26, Saurav Chauhan 49, Jayswal 26; Ishant Sharma 2-28, Prince Yadav 3-37, Arpit Rana 2-39)",Virat Kohli scores 77 as Delhi beat Gujarat by seven runs in Vijay Hazare Trophy.

Kylie Jenner and Jordyn Woods' relationship from scandal to sisterhood

The beef between celebrities often gets stretched for decades, but not for the makeup mogul, Kylie Jenner . The young billionaire just showed that mistakes made in the past should remain there, and one should move forward with the years.When Jordyn Woods announced her engagement to New York Knicks’ Karl-Anthony Towns, the first thing the internet did was scan the comments for a reaction from her former bestie. And guess what? Kylie Jenner didn’t disappoint. Her comment painted over all the buzz around her and Wood’s relations since the scandal on Keeping Up with the Kardashians.KAT has been Wood’s rock in one of her toughest times when the internet collectively went against her over the scandal, and seeing them finally locking each other for life seems earned.Jordyn Woods, via her Instagram on Christmas Day, dropped a series of images showing KAT’s proposal, and captioned it as “Merry Christmas.”The proposal looked straight out of a romance movie as the NBA star, Karl-Anthony Towns, seemed to pull out all the stops from selecting the historic Chateau de Vaux-le-Vicomte as the proposal venue to surprising Jordyn with a massive diamond. A setting truly fit for royalty.The duo has known each each for a long time but didn’t begin dating until May 2020.That September, Jordyn told Extra, “The right person will bring a lot out of you. We have been friends for a long time. Naturally, we both connected about losing a parent at a very young age … so it was a very organic relationship that we’d been best friends for a while.”From Bella Hadid to the Olympic gold medalist, Simone Biles, multiple celebrities reacted to this post with heartfelt congratulatory messages and blessings. But what grabbed the netizens’ eyes was Kylie Jenner’s name amongst these.Jenner commented, “jordyyyyyyy” followed by a series of ""crying"" emojis. It was a moment that officially signaled the end of any lingering tension between the friends. Jordyn’s sister, Jodie, also commented, “The most deserving woman, so proud of both of you this is EVERYTHING.”Kylie Jenner’s comment might seem to some as a friend being happy for their friend, but the history behind these two makes this moment much more special. After a decade of friendship, the duo hit a rocky road in 2019 when Woods and Tristan Thompson’s were caught in a scandal during the filming of KUWTK, while the latter was dating Kylie’s sister Khloe Kardashian Following the nature of the reality show, the fallout was messy and heartbreaking while it got broadcast across the globe. It headlined the entertainment tabloids for years. However, it seems like time is truly a healing medicine. In 2023, Kylie and Jordyn were seen grabbing sushi, signaling the reconciliation. By celebrating Jordyn’s engagement today, Kylie is proving that they’ve traded the old drama for a supportive and mature friendship as it turns out that even the most complicated histories can have a happy ending.Also Read: “I’m ready to get home” — Stephen Curry shares heartfelt message for wife Ayesha Curry following Christma","Jordyn Woods announced her engagement to New York Knicks’ Karl-Anthony Towns.

A decision that remains fluid behind the scenes

Brian Schottenheimer: I Want to Take That Next Step | Dallas Cowboys 2025

Also Read:

As the Dallas Cowboys stumble toward the end of a disappointing 2025 season, one thing is no longer up for debate - Dak Prescott intends to play in Week 18.Following Dallas’ 30-23 Christmas Day win over the Washington Commanders, Prescott made his stance clear amid growing speculation that the Cowboys could rest starters in a season finale with no playoff implications. For the veteran quarterback, sitting out is not an option.“I want to play,” Prescott said when asked about the possibility of being held out. “I love this game. If I get the opportunity, I’m going to prepare the same way and give it my best.”The Cowboys enter Week 18 with a 7-8-1 record, officially eliminated from postseason contention. Expectations were far higher at the start of the year, but inconsistency on both sides of the ball - combined with injuries and defensive lapses, derailed Dallas’ playoff push.Despite the bigger picture, Prescott views the regular-season finale as more than a formality. Finishing strong, especially in a divisional matchup, still carries meaning for a locker room searching for momentum heading into the offseason.“There’s pride in that,” Prescott added. “I want to win. I want to be out there with my guys.”The Christmas Day victory came at a physical cost. Prescott was sacked six times by Washington and absorbed repeated hits behind an offensive line that struggled in the second half.Even so, he finished with 307 passing yards, two touchdowns, and no interceptions, a performance that reinforced his value to the offense.Teammates were quick to rally around their quarterback, praising his toughness and leadership. Running back Javonte Williams publicly called out protection issues while commending Prescott for playing through the punishment.Head coach Brian Schottenheimer has so far echoed Prescott’s mindset, indicating that the plan remains to start the franchise quarterback in the finale. Still, with the offseason looming, the Cowboys must weigh long-term health against short-term morale.A late injury would be catastrophic for a team already facing hard questions about roster construction, coaching continuity, and overall direction.Dallas will close its season on the road against the New York Giants, offering Prescott a final chance to set a tone before months of uncertainty. Whether the Cowboys finish strong won’t change their playoff fate, but it could influence how the offseason conversation begins.For Prescott, the message is simple: seasons don’t end quietly, even when the playoffs are out of reach. As the Cowboys limp toward January, their quarterback has drawn his line, and he intends to cross it on the field.",Dak Prescott intends to play in the Dallas Cowboys' season finale.

Kenny Stills believes “Trump curse” played a part in Detroit’s late-season setback



What looked like a season heading toward meaningful January football has ended with frustration, questions, and a sense of opportunity wasted. The Detroit Lions’ campaign unraveled at the wrong time, and their 23-10 loss to the Minnesota Vikings on Christmas night finally closed the door on any postseason possibility while clearing the way for the Green Bay Packers to secure their place instead.The defeat was not an isolated stumble. It capped a worrying run of form in which Detroit simply could not hold its footing during the most demanding stretch of the schedule. Performances dipped, execution failed, and the Lions repeatedly found themselves second best. By the time Minnesota controlled Thursday night’s contest, it felt like the end result had been building for weeks.As the disappointment settled, an unexpected angle resurfaced online. Former Miami Dolphins receiver Kenny Stills revisited an earlier moment from Detroit’s season, sharing a clip of Amon-Ra St. Brown’s celebration from the Lions’ convincing win over Washington. Stills suggested that the celebration invited bad luck, even calling it a “Trump curse” on Twitter, sparking debate rather than being brushed aside as harmless commentary.That celebration once symbolized Detroit’s swagger, coming in a game they controlled comfortably.What followed tells a harsher story: only two wins in seven outings, momentum gone, confidence shaken, and ultimately the playoff push slipping away. Supporters can joke about superstition, but the real issue lies in how quickly standards dropped when pressure intensified.Against Minnesota, the shortcomings were clear. Drives failed to sustain, defensive gaps appeared at crucial moments, and the Vikings showed greater composure in decisive situations. It wasn’t a curse that ended Detroit’s season; it was a mix of stalled offense, lapses in execution, and timing that worked entirely against them.Now the Lions head into the offseason knowing this one will hurt. A promising position dissolved into a late-season slide that cost them everything they were chasing. The challenge ahead is not about addressing online narratives; it is about restoring consistency, rediscovering belief, and ensuring a collapse like this does not define the group moving forward.",Kenny Stills believes “Trump curse” played a part in Detroit’s late-season setback.

Quinton Rampage Jackson gifts son Elijah Jackson a rare Audi R8 after keeping childhood promise

Quinton Rampage Jackson made Christmas very special this year. The former UFC light heavyweight champion surprised his youngest son with a gift many people only dream about. Just days before Christmas, Jackson shared that he spent about $275,000 on a car for his son, Elijah “Rampage” Jackson. This was not a last-minute idea. Jackson said it was a promise he made when his son was very young. Years later, he finally kept that promise.The moment quickly went viral after Jackson posted it on X. Fans saw a proud father and a shocked son sharing a quiet but powerful moment together. The gift stood out not just because of the price, but because of the meaning behind it. Jackson did not buy something for himself. He chose to reward his son and celebrate family during the holidays. That message made the story travel fast across social media.Jackson revealed the surprise on X, where he posted a video from his garage. In the clip, Elijah Jackson walks in and sees a black Audi R8 waiting for him. He pauses, clearly stunned, and asks if the car is really his.Jackson replies with a calm smile and says, “Like I promised you when you were a kid.” He then reminds his son to drive carefully, warning him that the car is very fast.After that, he hands over the keys.The Audi R8 is one of the brand’s top sports cars. It comes with a V10 engine and a carbon-fiber body. According to Edmunds, newer Audi R8 models can cost up to $275,000, depending on features. Older versions can be cheaper, but Jackson did not share the exact model.Audi officially ended R8 production in March 2024, as confirmed by Audi. That has made existing models more valuable among car lovers.Jackson shares Elijah with his former wife, Yuki Imoto. He is also a father to other children, including daughter Naname Nakia Jackson. Still, this moment was fully about a father and son.Later, Jackson also spoke about his income today. During a livestream, he said streaming has paid him more than fighting ever did. “I have been streaming for eight months, and I made more than I did in my fighting career,” he said. He added that sponsors support him more now because more people watch his streams.Quinton Rampage Jackson streams travel videos, home life clips, and content with other creators. He also shared that having two kids in college pushed him to focus on streaming full-time. The success of that move made this Christmas promise possible.Also Read: Ex-UFC Champion Sean O’Malley Flags Trouble For Dana White As The White House Card Faces Major Concern","Quinton Rampage Jackson surprised his son with a rare Audi R8 for Christmas.

Image Via Instagram





Mizkif has always remained one of the most popular names in online streaming circles with his unpredictable content, amazing ability to connect with his audience, and high-profile career changes. Moving on towards the end of the year 2025, his finances continue to be in the headlines with his high-profile career changes. Whether it’s a shift in platforms or a departure from organizational roles, Mizkif has become a name not associated with a linear career path, hence his net worth being a constant point of discussion.While exact figures are difficult to verify, there are several Internet estimates that say Mizkif is still in solid financial standing despite all of the highs and lows. Where once his income could be traced back to one specific area or industry, his career has become so diverse that his net worth is more of akind of deal, encompassing years of successful streaming, recognition as a brand, and an assortment of skill sets for adapting to an ever-shifting market landscape that is particularly challenging for creators like Mizkif to navigate successfully.As of 2025, Mizkif is reportedly estimated to have a net worth ranging from 4 million dollars to 6.5 million dollars, although some conservative estimates put it slightly lower than that. Although there is a considerable gap in these estimates due to discrepancies regarding calculations of platforming or spending, most people agree on where he got most of his money, which was presumably back when he was streaming.Streaming has continued to be a steady stream of income for him. He has, through the years, drawn income through subscription, ad revenue, and donations. Despite quitting Twitch to join Kick, it will be fair to say that many of his fans followed him, which is an important factor in ensuring a steady income. Deals probably followed, which enhanced income, even if figures are not made public.In addition to live streaming, Mizkif earns additional income from sponsorships, merchandise sales, and his channel on YouTube. In most cases, these additional sources of income tend to create financial stability for most of these influencers. Even though he does not have leadership positions within large corporations anymore, he owes that experience to his financial structure.All things considered, Mizkif's net worth in 2025 is indicative of his professional growth and success. In terms of his participation in the streaming industry, he has been changing. Nonetheless, his ability to sustain his fan base and various sources of income has guaranteed his ongoing financial success. Despite varying net estimates, Mizkif is undoubtedly one of the wealthiest people who came from the streaming industry.Also Read: Adin Ross confirms person allegedly hit by Clavicular’s Tesla Cybertruck is alive",Mizkif is reportedly estimated to have a net worth ranging from 4 million dollars to 6.5 million dollars.

Adin Ross explains FaZe Clan exits as GameSquare stake dispute while Richard Bengtsone denies involvement







FaZe Clan is in the middle of another big shake-up. The famous esports and creator group has seen many well-known members leave at the same time. Fans are confused and want answers fast. The biggest question is simple: who owns FaZe Clan now, and why are creators quitting together? Right now, GameSquare is the only owner of FaZe Clan. This comes after a long year of changes, buybacks, and exits at the top. As the exits happened, streamer Adin Ross shared his side of the story during a livestream.He claimed the issue was about money and ownership, not drama. At the same time, former FaZe leader Richard Bengtsone, also known as FaZe Banks, stepped in to clear his name. He said he had nothing to do with the recent exits. Here is what happened, step by step.FaZe Clan was started over 15 years ago by Richard Bengtsone. He led the group for years and became the face of the brand. That changed in 2023, when GameSquare bought FaZe Clan in an all-stock deal.In June 2024, Bengtsone returned by buying back 25% of FaZe Clan from GameSquare. Many fans thought this meant stability was back. But the return did not last long.In March 2025, Bengtsone’s company, Faze Media, sold its stake in FaZe Esports. This move gave GameSquare full control again.A few months later, in July 2025, Bengtsone stepped down as CEO. From that point on, GameSquare became the sole owner of FaZe Clan.Soon after, creators began leaving. On Christmas, QTCinderella, JasonTheWeen, StableRonaldo, Lacy, Adapt, and Silky all posted the same message on X:“Left @FaZeClan”As questions grew, Adin Ross spoke during a livestream. He claimed the exits were linked to a late demand for ownership shares. Ross said:“They never signed that 20% initially. They [GameSquare] come after them a year and a half later and then ask for the 20%…. That’s in the wrong. ‘Cause if your intention was to sign these guys for 20% of FaZe, they probably would’ve all done it.”He added:“But now, you wait until they’re big, have millions of followers, so why would they sign the contract? You can’t put a deal in their fking faces at this point.”Many fans then wondered if FaZe Banks was involved in this. Bengtsone responded on X and shut that down. He wrote that he had “nothing to do” with the situation, said he had moved on, and added that he would help if asked.Also Read: Viral Video Shows Clavicular And N3on Attacked With Red Liquid As Past Crash Livestream Resurfaces Amid Ongoing Kick Ban","FaZe Clan is in the middle of another big shake-up.

Chicago Cubs’ position and what’s at stake

How the Philadelphia 76ers vs Chicago Bulls game could unfold

The Philadelphia 76ers will not know Joel Embiid’s status until close to tip-off when they face the Chicago Bulls on December 26, 2025, at the United Center. He is still being managed for a right knee issue and is listed as questionable or day-to-day.Philadelphia comes into the game short-handed and cautious. Several rotation players are unavailable, while others are dealing with illness. Chicago, on the other hand, is close to full strength and has played well recently. That contrast puts pressure on the Sixers, who are trying to hold their place near the top of the Eastern Conference standings.Joel Embiid has dealt with knee problems for much of the season. He was already considered a game-time decision on December 25, and the situation has not changed much since then. The issue is right knee soreness tied to ongoing management rather than a new injury.There have been no reports of fresh scans or specialist visits for this game. The Sixers are sticking with a careful plan, shaped by Embiid’s past absences and long-term health concerns. The team continues to balance the need to win now with the goal of keeping him available later in the season.Philadelphia 76ers’ roster situation could affect both rotations and matchups, especially if Embiid does not play.If Joel Embiid is ruled out, Philadelphia may need to rely more on younger frontcourt players such as Adem Bona to fill minutes inside.The Chicago Bulls list only Noa Essengue as unavailable due to a G League assignment, giving them a clear health advantage. Chicago has played with more consistency lately, while the Sixers sit at 16–12 and are trying to stay competitive in the Atlantic Division race.Without Joel Embiid, the matchup inside shifts toward Chicago, where Nikola Vucevic could have more room to operate.Discussion around Embiid’s availability has been constant, and this game is no different. If he plays, even with limited minutes, Philadelphia gains stability on both ends of the floor. If he sits, the offense leans heavily on Tyrese Maxey, and the margin for error shrinks.Tip-off is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. ET, with Embiid’s final status expected shortly before the game begins.","Joel Embiid is still being managed for a right knee issue and is listed as questionable or day-to-day.

"'Eating rice with hands, go back to home': Times when Nick Fuentes used anti-India slurs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/eating-rice-with-hands-go-back-to-home-times-when-nick-fuetnes-used-anti-india-slurs-usha-vance-vivek-ramaswamy/articleshow/126192301.cms,"‘Eating rice with hands, speaking Hindi — is that America?’

Usha Vance J**t Slur Sparks Firestorm: Vivek Ramaswamy’s Outburst Splits MAGA | ‘You Have No Place…’

'Now do India'

Fuentes calls India food 's**t'

Usha and JD Vance

Vivek Ramaswamy





Nicholas J Fuentes, an American white nationalist known for his racist and sexist rants, has been after India for a very long time.He had several times used anti-India slurs at his podcasts, especially targeting Usha Vance, US Vice President's JD Vance's wife, and Vivek Ramaswamy In his recent podcast, while speaking about the Christmas celebration in the United States, said that no one celebrates the festival in Texas, Minneapolis and Seattle because there are all Indians, Somalians, and Asians.""What would America be without Christmas? Because pretty soon we're going to have a country of. A lot of people that don't celebrate Christmas aren't Christian, don't speak English, don't play baseball, don't eat hot dogs, don't eat apple pie. So imagine in 50 years, it's December 25th, and there. There are no Christmas trees. And it isn't Christmas in Dallas anymore or Frisco in Texas because it's all Indians. There is no Christmas in Minneapolis this year because it's all Somalians. There is no Christmas in Seattle anymore because it's all Asians,"" he said in the podcast.""And nobody's watching Christmas movies and nobody's going to visit a nativity scene and nobody's eating a turkey or a ham or singing Christmas carols and there are no Christmas lights or ornaments.Is that America? Nobody's even speaking English,"" he added.Speaking anti-India slurs, Fuentes asked that people are watching the soccer match on a tv, in a bar, in some hovel, eating rice with their hands, speaking Hindi to each other. Is that America? That look like any America you've ever heard of?On a report on X about the Donald Trump administration announcing “full suspension” of immigration and naturalisation for citizens of 19 countries, he commented, “Now do India”.These countries with full or partial travel restrictions include Afghanistan, Burma (Myanmar), Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela. The US has intensified its crackdown on immigration after an Afghan national was accused of shooting one National Guard member and critically wounding another in Washington, DC.""I really appreciate the invitation. It's very gracious. I have said a lot of negative things about JD Vance. So for him to extend an invitation like that to me to have dinner, a traditional Indian dinner, with his family...it actually moved me. It actually touched me a little bit. I have been nothing but antagonistic to this guy, really unprovoked; I started the beef,"" Nick Fuentes said, suggesting that Indians eat s**t.""And so for him, in the spirit of the holiday and Christmas, for him to extend an invitation in public like that, to enjoy a traditional Indian dinner prepared by his wife with his family at the Naval Observatory, he is a better man than me. Credit where it is due,"" Fuentes said.Fuentes added that he would have to decline the invitation respectfully as he does not want to eat s**t. ""That's why we don't want them here,"" Fuentes said adding that he knows that Indian eat cow dung and they scratch their a** and prepare the food.Fuentes has used anti-India slurs against her multiple times. He in one of the podcasts called her J**t, which is a common slur used against Indian-origin people. In one of the podcasts, Fuentes used racist slurs, saying, ""Your guy (JD Vance) is literally a fat, gay, race traitor that married a J***.""Earlier, Fuentes launched his attack on Vance and his family after Vance joined Trump’s re-election campaign last month.Fuentes questioned Vance's loyalty to white identity, citing his marriage to an Indian woman and the name of their child, Vivek.Not only this, recently, the podcaster mocked the photo featuring JD Vance celebrating Thanksgiving with his Hindu wife Usha’s Indian-origin family.Right-wing commentator Nick Fuentes mocked the Thanksgiving photo in a manner that many netizens deemed 'racist' on this year's Thanksgiving.Pointing at the image, Fuentes mocks its composition, claiming there are “two white people” and “24 Indian or East Asian people” dressed in what he calls “indigenous garb.” He sarcastically challenges viewers to “spot the differences,” using the moment to ridicule the family’s multicultural setting. Fuentes goes on to make a historically warped joke, insisting the first Thanksgiving involved Indigenous Americans, “not real Indians from India. ”He then takes a crude swipe at a red drink on the table, comparing it to street beverages in India prepared “with flies” and unsanitary handling. Using the photo as political ammunition, Fuentes argues that anyone considering Vance as a leader should simply look at the image, framing it as all they “need to know.”""This is not your home. And you know it's not your home. That's why you married an Indian and you had Indian kids, You gave them Indian names and you didn't assimilate, you didn't even adopt the religion of our country. And you go around telling us that we don't even have to speak English to be American. F**k you. You should go back to India where there's a lot more people like you. There's a billion and a half Indians in India and you don't have to worry about being called a J**t there because there's a billion and a half f**king J**ts in India and they won't call you one over there,"" Fuentes said in the recent podcast after his AmFest speech.""Go live there if it makes you feel uncomfortable. If you want to live here, give ounce and a shred of respect to the people that built this country. We're not asking anymore. We're telling you. And if you think now that you're gonna become the governor of Ohio, telling white people that you're as American as them, you got your anchor baby, birthright citizenship from your H1-B f****ng parents, you think you're gonna go around Ohio telling people that have been there since the civ or since the Revolutionary War, you're as American as them, you're now going to be their governor,"" he added.Over his Op-ed piece on New York Times, Fuetnes said, ""“Reminder that Vivek Ramaswamy is an actual anchor baby, so everything he says can be completely disregarded ... Foreigners who have no right to be here don’t get to lecture me about what it is to be American.”","Nicholas J Fuentes, an American white nationalist known for his racist and sexist rants, has been after India for a very long time.
