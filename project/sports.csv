Former Pakistan batter Basit Ali has made a bold prediction about the India versus Pakistan Asia Cup clash on September 14.The eight-nation Asia Cup will be the first major event in the build-up to next year's T20 World Cup in India in February and March. The Asia Cup will begin on September 9 with defending champions India set to face hosts United Arab Emirates a day later in Dubai in the eight-nation tournament.India and arch-rivals Pakistan have been clubbed in Group A and clash on September 14.Basit was furious about the way Pakistan Cricket Board is functioning in the recent years.A couple of days ago, Pakistan Cricket Board has downgraded deals for Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan in the latest list of 30 centrally contracted players announced.Both Babar and Rizwan were in category A but have been relegated to join Abrar Ahmed, Fakhar Zaman, Haris Rauf, Hasan Ali, Saim Ayub, Salman Ali Agha, Shadab Khan and Shaheen Shah Afridi in category B.Pakistan finished at the bottom of the ICC World Test Championship and the PCB has demoted its test captain Shan Masood from category B to category D.Fast bowler Naseem Shah, who was also dropped for the upcoming T20 tournaments in the United Arab Emirates, was dropped from the second tier to the third tier of contracted players.Wickekeeper-batter Usman Khan, who chose to play for Pakistan over the UAE, was among the eight international players who didn’t get a central contract.While some key Pakistan cricketers were demoted, legs-pinner Ahmed, fast bowler Rauf, opening batter Ayub, T20 captain Agha and legspinner Shadab Khan were all upgraded from C to B category contracts.The contracts run through June 30, 2026.Basit has called the entire saga about the contract a ""joke.""He then further stated: "".(One more joke will happen when India faces Pakistan on September 14. Another joke will unfold there),"" he told Kamran Akmal on a YouTube show ""Game Time.""",Former Pakistan batter Basit Ali has made a bold prediction about the India versus Pakistan Asia Cup clash on September 14.

SRINAGAR: The unhurried rhythm of a shikara gliding through the Dal is one of Kashmir's oldest inheritances.On Thursday, a 17-year-old Kashmiri boy swapped the oars of his shikara for a kayak paddle and whipped up a frenzy generations of his family hadn't known – shouts of ""Mohsin! Shabhash, Mohsin!"" from the banks of the lake as he neared the finish line of a 1000m kayaking competition to give J&K the first gold of the ongoing Khelo India Water Sports Festival.""I am so happy. I defeated kayakers who have competed in China and Europe. This is a big thing for me,"" said Mohsin, moments after stepping out of his kayak into the waiting arms of his coach Bilquis Mir, a former international and an Olympic judge.Mohsin, a Class 12 student at Srinagar's SP Higher Secondary School, takes tourists on shikara rides after school almost every day to earn some money that goes into supplementing his diet. It helps that he lives in Kand Mohalla, next to the lake.Mohsin credits his carpenter father Fida Hussain with encouraging him to excel in sport. ""My father tells me that kayaking is my ticket out of Dal to see the world,"" he told TOI.Winning gold in a national competition ""in front of my people"" has stoked Mohsin's ambition to aim for bigger glory, which his coach believes isn't out of reach.""Mohsin was only seven when he came to me to learn kayaking. He has come a long way since, striving to get better each day.I think this is just the beginning,"" said Mir.While the adulation still rings in his ears, Mohsin worries about finding the resources to reach the next level. ""Only I know how difficult it has been just to be able to afford the diet a kayaker needs to compete in such events,"" he said.Khelo India Water Sports Festival, which runs until Aug 23, is the second Khelo India event hosted by J&K after the Khelo India Winter Games in Gulmarg. The water sports edition features six events –rowing, canoeing, kayaking, water skiing, shikara race and dragon boat race.Launched in 2017-18, Khelo India is a mission to promote sports at the grassroots and help scouts spot talent early.","Mohsin Ali, 17, wins gold at Khelo India Water Sports Festival in Srinagar.

From $25K to $10M: Tyson Bagent’s tearful speech has fans rooting harder than ever,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/from-25k-to-10m-tyson-bagents-tearful-speech-has-fans-rooting-harder-than-ever/articleshow/123440842.cms,"Tyson Bagent signs two year extension as Chicago Bears lock in backup quarterback until 2027 (Image via Getty)

From Shepherd University to Chicago: Tyson Bagent’s $10M payday brings him to tears



Tears of gratitude show what this moment means



Why Tyson Bagent’s story matters for football fans everywhere



If you ever needed proof that dreams don’t care where you start, Tyson Bagent just delivered it in the most emotional way possible. The Chicago Bears quarterback, who not long ago was a Division II kid at Shepherd University in West Virginia just signed a massive $10 million extension and couldn’t hold back tears as he explained how many people he’ll be able to help with this money. From a $25k signing bonus to a $5 million-per-year contract, this is the kind of underdog fairytale the NFL is made for.Before he was tearing up over a $10M deal, Tyson Bagent was just another college QB at Shepherd Rams, a Division II program in West Virginia that doesn’t exactly scream NFL pipeline. He wasn’t drafted, didn’t have the hype, and definitely didn’t walk into the league with big endorsements waiting for him. But what he did have was grit, a cannon for an arm, and the kind of perseverance that makes scouts stop and think twice.Most Division II players never even sniff the league. Bagent not only made it, he carved himself a real role in Chicago.When Bagent first entered the NFL, his deal was about as small as it gets, a $25,000 signing bonus, and barely $1.5 million spread across two years. In NFL money, that’s pocket change. Every snap he took was basically an audition just to stay in the league.Fast-forward to now, his new $10 million contract extension puts him at $5M per year. That’s not just job security, that’s generational stability. It’s the kind of deal most undrafted players only dream about, and Bagent made it reality.When the extension was announced, Bagent broke down while talking to reporters. His words weren’t about himself or flashy purchases, but about how many people he could help with this money. That honesty, that raw emotion, it’s what made this moment hit harder than a touchdown celebration.Instead of bragging, he showed gratitude. Instead of flexing, he cried. And honestly, that’s why people are rallying behind him because he feels real.Bagent’s rise isn’t just about football. It’s about belief. He’s proof that you don’t need to come from a powerhouse program or be a first-round pick to make an impact. He’s proof that overlooked athletes can still climb to the top.In a league obsessed with stars and superteams, Tyson Bagent’s story is a refreshing reminder: sometimes the best narratives are written by the guys no one expected.Also read - Travis Kelce isn’t the first: Swifties remind everyone Taylor’s always shown off her boyfriends","Tyson Bagent, the Chicago Bears backup quarterback, just signed a $10 million contract extension.

Vanessa Bryant finally breaks silence on wild pregnancy rumors with a wild response featuring a Rihanna meme,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/vanessa-bryant-finally-breaks-silence-on-wild-pregnancy-rumors-with-a-wild-response-featuring-a-rihanna-meme/articleshow/121561895.cms,"Vanessa Bryant.

Poll Do you think Vanessa Bryant handled the pregnancy rumors well? Yes, very cleverly No, she should have addressed them directly

Met Gala Surprise: Rihanna Stuns With Baby Bump Reveal, A$AP Rocky Confirms It’s Baby No 3

After days of unrelenting speculation, Vanessa Bryant took to Instagram Stories on Sunday, June 1, to put the rumors to rest. Her response wasn’t a press statement or a legal warning, it was a wild meme with a big middle finger to the internet trolls. The meme featured music icon Rihanna floating in water with a snorkel mask on her head, holding a drink, and flipping her middle finger.“Me protecting my peace, not pregnant & having fun all summer,” Vanessa Bryant wrote in the caption on her response to the online trolls who spread her pregnancy rumors about five years after her husband, Kobe Bryant ’s, untimely and devastating demise.It was clear, clever, and vintage Vanessa who shut down noise without saying a word about the origin of the gossip. No press release needed when you’ve got Rihanna energy with a direct middle finger gesture.The rumors had emerged out of nowhere, with some users pointing to photos allegedly showing a ""baby bump,"" though no timestamps or context were attached to those images. Vanessa hasn't been publicly linked to anyone romantically, and there’s been zero confirmation from her side—until now.In another Instagram Story later that evening, Vanessa shared a motivational quote that hinted at how she views the entire situation and what matters to her personally.“The only way to impress me, is by being a good person,” the quote read. “I don’t care what you have, what you wear, where you live, or what you drive. I just have deep respect for people with pure hearts and good intentions.”Adding one final touch to her trilogy of clapbacks, she posted another Rihanna meme, this one stating, “I’m not mean, I’m just not the one.”With the classic Rihanna memes, Vanessa showed that she is busy being a proud mom to her daughters while being the powerhouse of her business ventures. While she does not care about the rumor mill, her reaction explicitly showed that she is urging privacy.Recently, Renaldo Wilson, the brother of WNBA star A’ja Wilson, has spoken out after a fake photo involving (who appears to be) Celtics forward Jaylen Brown and Vanessa Bryant started spreading online. The image, which many quickly realized was AI-generated, sparked a wave of unnecessary speculation. Renaldo stepped in to shut down the rumors and defend Vanessa from online trolls.Vanessa Bryant, who shares four daughters with Kobe— Natalia, Bianka, Capri, and the late Gianna— has remained devoted to family and philanthropy. Most recently, she shared footage of a joyful family ski trip over the holidays, showing the tight-knit bond she maintains with her children.Natalia Bryant stepped into the fashion world just like her mother, officially joining IMG Models in 2021 at the age of 18. “Ever since I can remember, I wanted to model,” she shared in a statement posted by IMG on Instagram. “There is a lot to learn, but I feel this is a great opportunity for me to learn and express myself creatively.”Vanessa and Kobe Bryant tied the knot in April 2001. Tragically, in January 2020, Kobe and their 13-year-old daughter Gianna lost their lives in a helicopter crash that also killed seven others. They were headed to Kobe’s Mamba Sports Academy for a youth basketball game when the accident occurred. Kobe was 41 at the time. The loss shook the sports world and left a lasting impact on fans, friends, and loved ones across the globe. Kobe has left a huge legacy to his name as well, he is considered one the of the elite NBA superstars of all time with astounding stats, records and intense playmaking abilities. His demise created a huge void in the NBA world as fans are still mourning his untimely passing.Since their passing, she’s kept their memory alive through meaningful business ventures and charitable work. Kobe launched the Mamba Sports Foundation in 2016, aiming to support young athletes. After his death, Vanessa renamed it the Mamba & Mambacita Sports Foundation in honor of both Kobe and Gianna. Today, the foundation helps underserved boys and girls in sports, pushing forward the mission they believed in. It's her way of carrying on their legacy with purpose and heart.Vanessa Bryant’s response was indeed witty and empowering as she hinted that she deserves privacy and reminded the world that while she may be a public figure, her peace and dignity aren’t up for debate, especially not over unfounded gossip. After the viral response via memes, Vanessa has seemingly closed the chapter as she did not extend the matter any further with any other comments about it afterwards.Days after shutting down the pregnancy rumor, Vanessa Bryant made a glowing courtside appearance with her daughters at the New York Liberty vs. Chicago Sky game. The WNBA shared a sweet clip showing Vanessa alongside Natalia, 22, Bianka, 8, and Capri, 5, all smiling and waving for the camera.Later, Vanessa uploaded an image of her in a restaurant, candidly posing as she waited for the food to be arrive. Considering the dress, it appears that the photograph was shot after her recent attendance in the game.Their family moment quickly caught fans’ attention online, adding a warm highlight to the evening. It was a rare and heartwarming public outing for the Bryant family, showing their strong support for women’s basketball. It was Vanessa's first public outing since she debunked the horrendous pregnancy rumors.Recently, Vanessa honored her husband Kobe's memory with a heartfelt Instagram post on Instagram, sharing a throwback photograph of the family with the NBA legend, ""Happy Fathers Day @kobebryant 💕 You are so missed. We love you so much. #GirlDad 💕💕""Earlier this July, Vanessa Bryant added another heartfelt moment to her social media with a birthday post for her sister, Sophie. The sweet throwback photo featured Vanessa, her late husband Kobe Bryant, and Sophie together, smiling during happier times. It comes after several touching family updates, including daughter Natalia’s recent USC graduation and emotional tribute to her dad.As for her fortune, Vanessa's net worth has seen major growth over the years. While Kobe Bryant’s NBA success helped build their fortune, Vanessa carved her own path, too. She’s earned recognition as a model, businesswoman, and philanthropist, adding to her wealth through years of steady work.As of 2025, her estimated net worth is $600 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. A large portion of that came from Kobe’s estate, after his tragic passing in 2020. At the time, Forbes valued the Lakers legend’s net worth at $600 million.Vanessa Bryant just shared a sweet throwback-inspired moment that melted hearts online. Her youngest daughter, Capri, recreated one of Kobe Bryant’s most iconic photos from 1999—wearing a cast and pajamas just like her dad did after a wrist injury. Vanessa captioned the photo, “Like father, like daughter. 💜 Capri Kobe Bryant 💜 #BabyMamba #KokoBean 💜💛🐍,” reminding fans how Kobe’s spirit lives on through their kids. From raising her children to keeping Kobe's memory alive, Vanessa has been an example of love and a remarkable parent. Also, there is no report of her seeing anyone as she remains loyal to her beloved husband Kobe, cherishing his legacy with their kids.Vanessa Bryant’s newest tribute arrives just months after she shared memories from a snowy holiday getaway with her daughters. Last December, she posted sweet moments on Instagram— showing the girls toasting marshmallows and skiing through the snow. Little Capri even shared a carousel ride with Vanessa, making the winter trip extra special.Additionally, Vanessa Bryant also grabs headlines for her friendship with several celebrities including Ciara, she often comments and likes the posts of her friends on social media. As of now, Vanessa is keeping a low profile about her personal life like always.Recently, Vanessa Bryant touched hearts with a heartfelt tribute to Kobe Bryant, joined by daughters Natalia, Bianka, and Capri during the Dodgers’ Bobblehead Night. She shared sweet photos from the emotional occasion, and her Instagram post celebrating Kobe Bryant’s legacy quickly drew an outpouring of love from fans. Certainly, Vanessa has been a proud mother with strong bonding with her kids.Recently, They partnered with @baby2baby and their Angel, @vanessabryant, to take part in a special Back-to-School Celebration for the incredible students of Ninth Street Elementary in Los Angeles. Each student received Mamba & Mambacita Sports Foundation gear along with Kobe sneakers — a perfect way to kick off the new school year and fall sports season.Also Read: Is Vanessa Bryant pregnant with her 5th child?

Poll Do you think Ashwin's YouTube video gave Australia an unfair advantage? Yes, it definitely helped them No, it was just a learning resource

NEW DELHI: Former India head coach Rahul Dravid and senior spinner Ravichandran Ashwin revisited a controversial moment from the 2023 Border-Gavaskar Trophy during the latest episode of Kutti Stories with Ash. The incident revolved around Ashwin facing backlash for allegedly helping Australia through a Tamil-language YouTube video on playing spin in India.The controversy erupted after Ashwin uploaded the video following Australia’s defeat in the second Test. The criticism intensified when India lost the third Test at Indore, with social media users accusing Ashwin of “coaching” the opposition. The channel was eventually forced to change the video’s thumbnail.Dravid light-heartedly brought up the episode with Ashwin.""You even coached the Australian team. I got sent a clip. Unfortunately, it was in Tamil. So that's the one I've seen about you. You're speaking in Tamil and with a little bit of Tamil that I understand, you're coaching the Australian team in the middle of the Australian series, how to play spin. And I'm thinking, Ash, the series is not over,"" Dravid said.Ashwin responded in his defence: ""If I knew how to do that, I would have told our boys how to play spin. I mean, why would I go and tell the Aussies?""Dravid admitted he was joking but also revealed he too had faced flak at the time.""The flak I got was 'Ashwin is coaching better than you are — what are you doing?'"" he said with a laugh.Ashwin also recalled a conversation with Mitchell Starc during the Indore Test: ""An interesting thing was that (Mitchell) Starc came and told me. I mean, he bowled a bumper, and I just left it in the Indore Test match. I think we were 80 for 7 or something. We went for lunch, and he was walking with me. He was like, 'Can I tell you how to play the bouncer like your YouTube video?'""Dravid further joked that the Australians might have found a translator: ""It's good to know that Starc knows Tamil.

Kansas City Chiefs superstars Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce have officially added “restaurateurs” to their long list of accomplishments. The quarterback-tight end duo revealed new details about their highly anticipated steakhouse, 1587 Prime, including its opening date and the launch of reservations. The restaurant, located at the Loews Kansas City Hotel, will officially open its doors on September 17. Patrick's wife Brittany has sent a big shoutout for the duo.Patrick Mahomes’ wife, Brittany Mahomes, chimed in with her support for the new venture. Sharing the announcement on social media, she kept it short and simple and wrote, “Let’s goooooo.” To make the announcement, Mahomes and Kelce dropped a video on the steakhouse’s Instagram page, letting fans know reservations had opened. “Signed. Sealed. Delivered. Be the first to dine among legends. Reservations now open – visit the link in the bio to reserve your table,” the caption read. It didn’t take long before every spot was gone, showing just how much buzz this place is already generating.As soon as reservations for 1587 Prime went live on August 20, Chiefs fans and Kansas City foodies jumped at the chance to be among the first guests. Within hours, the entire reservation book was filled – proof that anything attached to Mahomes and Kelce carries serious weight in the city.The location inside the Loews Kansas City Hotel puts the restaurant in a prime spot (pun fully intended), and with the NFL season just around the corner – starting with Kansas City’s opener against the Los Angeles Chargers in Brazil on September 5 – the timing couldn’t be better. With opening day set for September 17 – and every table already claimed – 1587 Prime is shaping up to be Kansas City’s most talked-about destinations before it even opens.The name 1587 Prime is a nod to Mahomes and Kelce’s jersey numbers — 15 and 87 — and reflects their joint venture off the field. But the restaurant is more than just a clever name. It’s a symbol of the duo’s connection to Kansas City and their desire to give something back to the community that’s supported them through three Super Bowl runs.In an interview with THE PEOPLE back in April, Kelce spoke about the vision he and Mahomes shared when starting this project. “What can I tell you is that we’re trying to open it up by around this time next year, so a 2025 grand opening,” Kelce said. “I’ve just been so fortunate to meet such amazing people and to be in it with my brother Pat Mahomes.”There’s still plenty of curiosity around what kind of dining experience Mahomes and Kelce plan to deliver, but if the buzz is anything to go by, fans are ready to find out. And with two of the NFL’s biggest stars behind it, expectations are high — both on the field and now, at the dinner table.","Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce have announced the launch of their new restaurant, 1587 Prime.

Nikola Jokic’s team Serbia’s win was crucial



In a packed arena in Belgrade, basketball fans were treated to a bit more than just a clash between two of Europe’s brightest stars. While Serbia’s Nikola Jokic and Slovenia’s Luka Doncic squared off in their final tune-up before EuroBasket 2025, a wholesome moment stole the spotlight. Courtside cameras caught Jokic’s young daughter reaching out to Doncic for a high-five, and the Los Angeles Lakers guard shared the heartfelt moment. The exchange instantly went viral on social media.The matchup between Serbia and Slovenia showed Serbia’s depth and dominance. Nikola Jokic and company rolled to a 106–72 victory, capping off a flawless seven-game preparation stretch. Jokic logged 10 points, eight rebounds, and four assists in limited minutes, while Doncic battled through a rough shooting night, scoring 17 points on 4-for-18 from the floor.Despite the lopsided result, fans were treated to moments that highlighted the mutual respect between the two stars. After the game, Jokic greeted Doncic with his daughter by his side. The Lakers superstar leaned in for a lighthearted moment, and Jokic responded with a kind gesture. As NBACentral captioned, “Jokic kisses Luka on the cheek after the game 🤝.”While Serbia enters EuroBasket as one of the clear favorites, boasting NBA names like Bogdan Bogdanovic, Nikola Jovic, Nikola Topic, and Tristan Vukcevic, Slovenia faces an uphill climb.Doncic carries the weight of his national team, with less roster support compared to Jokic’s dominant Serbian squad. Slovenia closed their preparations with just one win in six games, raising questions about how far Doncic’s brilliance alone can take them.Serbia’s control of Thursday’s contest left little doubt about their potential. They jumped out with a 10–0 run and stretched their lead to 21 points midway through the second quarter. From there, it was never close. Nikola Jovic paced all scorers with 18 points, while Bogdanovic and Vukcevic chipped in to showcase Serbia’s well-rounded attack.Also Read: Paige Bueckers surpasses legendary WNBA player to claim her latest milestone Serbia enters Group A alongside Turkey, Czechia, Latvia, Portugal, and Estonia.

Patrick Mahomes reflects on the struggles surrounding his father’s DWI arrest



Patrick Mahomes Sr.’s admission and the lessons from the past



In the high-pressure build-up to the 2024 Super Bowl, Patrick Mahomes faced not only the weight of leading the Kansas City Chiefs but also an emotional storm away from the field. Just days before the biggest game of the season, his father, Patrick Mahomes Sr. , was arrested on a third DWI charge, forcing the star quarterback to navigate a deeply personal crisis under the public eye.Speaking on ESPN’s Chiefs Kingdom, Mahomes candidly shared how the incident shadowed one of the most important moments of his career. “It was during that Super Bowl. It became a story, and so, I had to answer questions about it,” he recalled. For Mahomes, the hardest part was seeing how the headlines extended beyond the game. “I think just knowing that it hurt me woke him up to know that like, you can't keep doing the same things. ”Mahomes Sr., a former MLB pitcher, admitted how the arrest left him devastated. “For him to have to answer questions about me was probably the most embarrassing thing I've ever been through in my life,” he said, reflecting on the toll it took not only on his son but on their family’s public image.Even Brittany Mahomes, who stood by her husband during the storm, revealed how the arrest shook their household.As a mother of three, she stressed the importance of setting an example for the younger generation. “It finally hit him,” Brittany said, noting how Mahomes Sr. was reminded that his children and grandchildren “are watching” every choice he makes.In the episode, Mahomes Sr. confronted his past with unfiltered honesty. He admitted that being “considered one of the best athletes in the world” had given him privileges—some of which he misused. “Some of them you shouldn't take, and I took my fair share of them,” he confessed.He further acknowledged that alcohol was woven into his playing days, often dismissed as part of the culture of professional sports. “It was just something that I've always done, just something that's in the game. I went out, partied a little bit, wasn't always where I was supposed to be,” he said. Mahomes, reflecting on his father’s career, pointed out how he often underestimated his drinking because “he could always still be on the baseball field” until his retirement in 2009.The February 2024 arrest in Tyler, Texas, where he recorded a blood alcohol content of 0.23, wasn’t his first. Mahomes Sr. had previously served 40 days in jail for a 2018 DWI. Following his guilty plea this year, he served a 10-day sentence in October.For Patrick Mahomes, the ordeal was a test of resilience and focus, reminding the world that even star athletes carry heavy personal battles behind the spotlight of success.Also Read: Why was a potential assassination attempt on Andy Reid in 2024 swept under the rug by the NFL?","Patrick Mahomes Sr. was arrested on a third DWI charge just days before the 2024 Super Bowl.

Russell Wilson and Ciara’s oldest son, Future, isn’t the little boy fans remember from red carpets anymore. At just 11, the young star is growing up fast, turning heads with how much he’s matured while continuing to share a close bond with his stepfather, Wilson. Recently, the trio—Russell, Future, and Giants wide receiver Malik Nabers—were seen together, and the moment left fans marveling at how seamlessly Future fits into his family’s world of sports and stardom.Future Zahir Wilburn, whose biological father is rapper Future, has always been a part of the limelight thanks to his mom Ciara. From walking red carpets to joining Wilson at NFL events, the boy has been a constant presence in their lives. Now, as he stands nearly eye-to-eye with pro athletes, his transformation is striking. Wilson himself shared a candid photo on Instagram with Nabers and Future, captioned simply: “My Homies. ”For Wilson, the moment was more than just a snapshot. The Super Bowl–winning quarterback, who is battling to prove he still has the edge to remain QB1 for the New York Giants, has always prioritized keeping Future close. Despite Giants fans showing curiosity about backup Jaxson Dart, Wilson continues to carry himself as a leader, both for his team and at home.His stepfather role has never been in question. Even after being booed during WWE SummerSlam at MetLife Stadium while attending with Future and his younger brother Win, he remained unfazed—choosing instead to celebrate family moments that matter most.As for Nabers, the rising Giants star has returned to practice after a minor back injury, eager to show why he was a top draft pick. The sight of him alongside Wilson and Future was symbolic: a merging of mentorship, youth, and legacy.Ciara and Wilson, married since 2016, are parents to four children: Sienna, 8, Win, 5, Amora, 1, and Future, 11. The singer often calls their household “non-stop entertainment,” a reflection of the lively energy that comes with raising a big family. For Wilson, embracing a blended family has always been intentional. Speaking earlier this year on I AM ATHLETE, he described Future as “a gift” and went on to say: “When you’re raising children … you’ve got to love every single child as if they’re yours. God gave me that opportunity to raise them and love them and care for them … And there’s no difference [between Future and his siblings].”That philosophy has made the Wilson household one of the most admired in sports and entertainment. Whether Wilson can silence his critics on the field remains uncertain, but off the field, his legacy as a father figure and devoted husband already shines brighter than any Super Bowl ring.Also Read: Bills owner Terry Pegula sparks outrage buying $100M superyacht after $2.1B taxpayer-funded stadium approval","Russell Wilson and Ciara’s oldest son, Future, isn’t the little boy fans remember from red carpets anymore.

A well-kept secret inside the Chiefs’ building

Andy Reid’s resilience mirrors his coaching legacy

Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid has built a reputation as one of the NFL’s most composed leaders on the sideline. But according to a new report, Reid faced a life-threatening scare last year that went largely unnoticed by both fans and much of the organization.On May 4, 2024, Reid was reportedly working late at the Chiefs’ training facility when gunfire struck the building. According to The Kansas City Star, a bullet pierced the glass of his second-floor office window, cut through blinds, and lodged into a wall between his office door and private bathroom. At the time, Reid was seated just 15 feet away.The situation could have been far worse. Police confirmed that two additional bullets also struck the facility — one on the third floor and another on an outdoor air conditioning unit. Fortunately, no one was injured, and the Kansas City Police Department classified the case as an aggravated assault. Authorities emphasized there was “no indication” the shots were specifically targeted at Reid or the Chiefs.Perhaps most surprising is that the incident remained largely unknown until now. The report notes it was such a “well-kept secret” that many Chiefs players and even some staff members only learned about it this week.In the aftermath, the team took extra precautions, reinforcing Reid’s office with bulletproof glass.Despite the terrifying moment, Reid continued his work without interruption. The 67-year-old guided Kansas City to a 15-2 record in the 2024 season, eventually reaching Super Bowl LIX, where the Chiefs fell to the Philadelphia Eagles.For a coach who has navigated immense pressure on the field, Reid’s calm persistence after the shooting underscores the steadiness that has defined his Hall of Fame career. Since taking over in 2013, he has led the Chiefs to three Super Bowl titles and turned the franchise into a modern dynasty.Also Read: Gracie Hunt breaks silence on romance with Derek Green, reveals bond began long before Cody Keith split The investigation into the shooting remains open, with no arrests made.

Theand Miami Heat are reportedly in discussions over a trade that could seeland in Dallas, while Miami receives Daniel Gafford, P.J. Washington, and a future first-round pick. The potential blockbuster has quickly become one of the hottest topics of the NBA offseason, as both franchises look to recalibrate their rosters for the 2025–26 campaign.The proposal sparks questions: Do the Dallas Mavericks gain the missing piece to their championship puzzle, or does Miami come away stronger by building depth and future flexibility?This blockbuster proposal could reshape the trajectories of both franchises, sparking debate over who truly benefits from this swap. Andrew Wiggins , an NBA champion with Golden State in 2022, offers Dallas both experience and versatility. The Mavericks’ current core of Kyrie Irving , Anthony Davis, and rookie phenom Cooper Flagg is talented but requires balance on the wing.• Slated as starting small forward, adding scoring and defensive versatility• Reliable perimeter shooting (35% career three-point average)• Defensive stopper against elite forwards, complementing Davis• Offensive numbers may decline sharing touches with Kyrie• Fans could expect higher scoring outputs than his role may actually provideFor Miami, the deal offers depth and long-term planning without sacrificing their competitive edge.• Daniel Gafford: Productive center (12.3 PPG, 6.8 RPG last season), pairs well with Bam Adebayo• P.J. Washington: Young forward with rebounding upside and room to grow• Future First-Round Pick: Adds to long-term roster flexibilityBy letting go of Andrew Wiggins, Miami alleviates salary commitments while diversifying their roster with valuable assets.• Dallas Mavericks: Veteran-heavy group (Irving, Davis) gains a player who can bridge the gap between aging stars and Flagg’s youth. The cost, however, is losing Gafford and Washington, two key rotation pieces.• Miami Heat: Infusion of fresh frontcourt talent to support Adebayo, with Washington’s versatility providing lineup flexibility.Wiggins’ reputation as a player who blends seamlessly with star-heavy rosters may help Dallas avoid major chemistry issues, though integration always comes with uncertainty.• More stable role compared to Golden State ’s shifting bench/starter usage• Lower offensive burden alongside Davis and Kyrie, allowing him to focus on defense and efficiency• Potential career revival under Jason Kidd’s system• Contract security: two years before free agency considerationsThis proposed Dallas Mavericks-Heat swap is not a clear win for either side - it’s a deal loaded with calculated risks and potential rewards.

Why This Trade Might Turn Out To Be a Classic Warriors Gamble

The 2025 NBA offseason has taken another surprising turn withemerging as a potential signing for the. While Simmons was heavily linked to the New York Knicks and Boston Celtics, the Warriors have now entered the conversation as a dark-horse candidate. With Stephen Curry still leading the team and Jimmy Butler recently added to the roster, Golden State is looking for ways to extend its championship window - and Simmons might be the missing piece.Unlike many offseason rumors involving complex trade packages, Ben Simmons is an unrestricted free agent, which changes the dynamics. Instead of sacrificing assets, Golden State could directly offer him a contract - possibly at the minimum - while the Knicks and Celtics continue to weigh their own offers.• Warriors’ approach: Offer Ben Simmons a minimum deal with a defined backup role.• Knicks’ challenge: Reports suggest Simmons is hesitant about playing under the bright spotlight of Madison Square Garden.• Celtics’ situation: They remain in contention but may need more offensive firepower than Simmons currently provides.The Golden State Warriors ’ system under Steve Kerr has historically elevated players with unique skill sets.For Simmons, whose strengths lie in defense, playmaking, and transition offense, the Warriors could be an ideal landing spot.• Backup Playmaker: Simmons could run the second unit, giving Curry rest while maintaining offensive flow.• Defensive Anchor: His 6’10 frame would add much-needed switchability and interior presence.• Kerr’s System: Motion-heavy offense minimizes Simmons’ shooting issues while emphasizing his passing.• Spacing Concerns: Playing alongside Draymond Green - also a non-shooter - could hurt spacing, requiring careful minute management.Adding Ben Simmons would give Golden State a low-risk, high-reward option:• Depth for the bench and insurance if Draymond Green misses time.• A stronger transition attack to keep pace with Western Conference rivals.• Defensive flexibility to counter teams like Denver and Minnesota.• Reduced workload for Curry and Butler, both in their mid-30s.For Ben Simmons, Golden State offers an opportunity to revive his career in a winning culture:• A defined backup role eliminates the pressure of being a franchise star.• The chance to work alongside veterans like Curry, Butler, and Green could restore his confidence.• Success in the Warriors’ system may rehabilitate his league-wide value, much like Andrew Wiggins did.The Golden State Warriors appear to be the biggest winners in this scenario. For minimal financial investment, they could land a former All-Star with championship-level defensive skills. Simmons, meanwhile, gets a chance to rebuild his career away from intense scrutiny. The Knicks lose out on potential defensive depth, while the Celtics may simply not need Simmons’ current skill set.This potential signing reflects Golden State’s long-standing strategy of finding hidden value in players others have written off. As the original article put it, Ben Simmons would be a “free lottery ticket” for the franchise - one that could either flame out quickly or pay off big on the road to another title run.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors Projected to Sign $20 Million Boston Celtics Star in Free Agency to Support Stephen Curry With the Western Conference as competitive as ever, the Simmons-to-Warriors rumors add another layer of intrigue to the NBA offseason drama.","Ben Simmons is an unrestricted free agent, which changes the dynamics.

The Tkachuk brothers are no strangers to the spotlight, both on and off the ice. With Matthew Tkachuk cementing his legacy as a back-to-back Stanley Cup champion with the Florida Panthers and Brady Tkachuk leading the Ottawa Senators as captain, the duo is now drawing comparisons to another famous sibling pair — NFL superstars Travis and Jason Kelce.This summer, Matthew graced the cover of EA Sports NHL 26, with Brady and their father, Keith Tkachuk, joining him on the deluxe edition. For the brothers, it marked more than just a video game milestone. “I think our 10-year-old selves would be losing their minds seeing that we’re on a cover of the NHL game that we loved playing growing up,” Brady said.Their growing media presence has been hard to ignore. From commercials and TV appearances to streaming projects like Prime Video’s Faceoff: Inside the NHL, the Tkachuks are showcasing personality in a sport that often resists individual promotion. Their fiery showing at the 4 Nations Face-Off earlier this year — where both dropped gloves against Canada — only amplified their popularity.Soon after, they appeared on the New Heights podcast with the Kelce brothers, sparking chatter about their own potential media ventures. “We’ve gotten a little bit of advice via the podcast route,” Matthew revealed. “But maybe one day.”Like the Kelces, the Tkachuks thrive on charisma, but not everyone is on board.Matthew’s bruising play style and Brady’s physical edge continue to frustrate rival fans. Even off the ice, headlines follow — including Matthew’s recent selection to Donald Trump’s Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition. On this, he remained cautious, saying it’s “a little too early” to confirm his role.Still, the brothers are determined to use their platform to grow hockey’s reach. “I think any exposure you get that can grow the game is very important to us,” Brady said.

NHL Trade Rumors: Edmonton Oilers weighing major trade with Bruins as Connor McDavid contract factor looms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-rumors-edmonton-oilers-weighing-major-trade-with-bruins-as-connor-mcdavid-contract-factor-looms/articleshow/123431989.cms,"As Connor McDavid approaches the final year of his contract, the Edmonton Oilers are exploring contingency plans (Imagn Images)

Why Fabian Lysell is surfacing in Connor McDavid-linked trade talk

What Fabian Lysell would bring and why Boston might consider it



What this means for Connor McDavid and the broader market

As Connor McDavid heads into the final year of his contract, the Edmonton Oilers are quietly preparing contingencies — and one of the earliest moves could involve Boston winger Fabian Lysell. Recent trade chatter suggests a modest, preliminary swap that might expand into a much larger negotiation depending on how McDavid’s contract talks unfold.Lysell, a former first-round pick who spent most of last season in Providence, has been linked to the Oilers in multiple rumor cycles. Hockey insiders flagged Lysell as a possible piece in a small-package exchange between Boston and Edmonton — a deal that teams sometimes use as a framework for bigger moves down the road. For Edmonton, adding a younger winger with speed and upside would be a low-risk, potentially high-reward hedge if McDavid’s future became uncertain.At 22, Lysell carries a mixed résumé: flashes of offensive potential in the AHL and a handful of NHL appearances, but not a locked-in role in Boston’s top six. The Providence profile and recent AHL numbers show a player who can produce but still needs consistent scoring at the next level — exactly the kind of asset a team might be willing to part with in a strategic swap. For the Bruins, packaging Lysell could free cap or roster space while banking on other prospects to emerge.Major-market clubs are reportedly watching McDavid’s situation closely; any sign he won’t re-sign would accelerate Edmonton’s urgency to assemble trade assets. That’s why today’s “small” talks matter: they can set a precedent and identify players who fit into larger multi-asset negotiations. If talks escalate, expect more names and heavier draft/goalie assets to enter the conversation.Also Read: NHL Trade Rumors: Canadiens warned against disastrous move to swap David Reinbacher for Ducks’ Mason McTavish In short, a Lysell-for-future pick or prospect swap would be a subtle but instructive starting point — one that could presage seismic moves should McDavid’s contract saga tip toward an exit.","Edmonton Oilers are exploring contingency plans for Connor McDavid's future.

Sidney Crosby inspires Canadian hockey team next generation



Canadian hockey future shaped by Crosby’s mentorship



As the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina is getting closer, Canadian hockey once again looks to its most reliable leader, Sidney Crosby. The Pittsburgh Penguins captain, celebrated for his game-winning goals and unmatched leadership, isn’t just gearing up for another shot at Olympic gold. He’s embracing a bigger responsibility: guiding Canada’s next generation of hockey stars, including phenom Connor Bedard, to carry forward the nation’s legacy on ice.Sidney Crosby has been more than just a player in the red and white jersey—he’s been the face of Canadian hockey for nearly two decades. From the golden goal in Vancouver 2010 to his steady presence in Sochi 2014, his contributions stretch far beyond scoring. What sets Crosby apart is his rare ability to connect with teammates of all ages. Veterans respect his consistency, while young players gravitate toward his mentorship.Speaking on the new wave of Canadian stars, Crosby offered humility and encouragement. “These guys are so ready now when they come in at such a young age, so they probably don’t need to hear much, but I’m here if they need it,” he said. For Bedard and others making their Olympic dreams a reality, having Crosby around means more than tactical guidance—it’s about learning the values of patience, composure, and leadership.The three-time Stanley Cup champion reflected on his own journey, saying, “I had guys who were really important in helping me adjust and, hopefully, accelerate my progress as best as possible. That’s part of playing a team sport. It’s a great thing about the game. Hopefully I can do the same.” His words reveal the cycle of mentorship that keeps Canadian hockey thriving across generations.The younger generation has already started voicing its gratitude. At the recent 4 Nations Face-Off tournament, Nathan MacKinnon credited Crosby as a steady influence in his career, noting, “He helped me a ton.” This acknowledgment highlights Crosby’s impact not only as a world-class athlete but as a cultural cornerstone in hockey.With Milan-Cortina 2026 approaching, Crosby’s presence guarantees that Canada won’t just compete for medals—it will continue shaping champions for decades to come.Also Read: Former Maple Leafs star reacts boldly to shocking trade rumors involving two of Auston Matthews’ teammates",Sidney Crosby has been the face of Canadian hockey for nearly two decades.

Mike Rupp’s absurd comparison stirs Leafs Nation



Auston Matthews proves his worth despite injuries



Former NHL forward and current analyst Mike Rupp has found himself in hot water with Maple Leafs fans after making a surprising claim about team captain Auston Matthews. Despite Matthews’ proven track record as one of the league’s most elite scorers, Rupp suggested that he would take New Jersey Devils star Jack Hughes over the Leafs’ centerpiece—an opinion that immediately set off a firestorm among hockey faithful.While Auston Matthews is gearing up for a bounce-back year, Mike Rupp was busy making headlines of his own during a top-20 centers ranking segment on NHL Network. Discussing Matthews’ placement at seventh overall, Rupp delivered the line that left many stunned: “A healthy Jack Hughes, I would take him over Auston Matthews.”The comment quickly went viral, with Leafs fans questioning how such a statement could hold weight. Hughes, though immensely talented, has already faced more serious injury setbacks in his young career, including two shoulder surgeries. Comparing him to Matthews—who has repeatedly proven himself on the biggest stage—felt baffling to many.What isn’t up for debate is that Auston Matthews remains one of the NHL’s most dominant forwards. And if his clean bill of health holds true, Toronto’s captain could silence doubters like Rupp in the best way possible—by lighting up the scoresheet yet again.Auston Matthews’ 2022–23 season was anything but smooth. The Leafs’ superstar battled through lingering injuries dating back to training camp, yet still managed to record 33 goals and 78 points in just 67 regular-season games. For most players, those numbers would be career highlights. For Matthews, they were considered a “down year.” That alone speaks volumes about the kind of offensive force he brings to Toronto’s lineup.This summer, Matthews participated in the annual Hockey Night in Brampton charity event, where he confirmed he’s finally healthy heading into the new campaign. A fully fit Matthews means trouble for opposing goaltenders, as he sets his eyes on a potential fourth Rocket Richard Trophy. With his scoring pedigree and two separate 60-goal seasons under his belt, few players in the league can claim to match his consistency when healthy.Also Read: Can Auston Matthews bounce back?

Bill Gates reveals his winning answer to ‘why should we hire you’ to crack any interview,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/bill-gates-reveals-his-winning-answer-to-why-should-we-hire-you-to-crack-any-interview/articleshow/123405257.cms,"

Bill Gates answers why should we hire you?

What are your strengths and weaknesses?





Where do you see yourself in five years?



What are your salary expectations?







Bill Gates’ final advice

When it comes to cracking a job interview, even the brightest candidates often stumble on the most common questions. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates , who has not only given interviews in his youth but also conducted countless ones as an employer, recently shared how to approach some of the trickiest questions that appear in almost every interview. Gates believes that while technical skills matter, the way candidates express their motivation, adaptability, and problem-solving abilities makes a lasting impression. His advice offers a mix of honesty, preparation, and strategic thinking that can help job seekers stand out in today’s highly competitive hiring environment.Gates emphasizes that this question isn’t about boasting but about clearly communicating your value in a way that resonates with the employer. He explains that hiring managers are not just looking for a list of accomplishments – they want to see how your skills and mindset directly align with the company’s mission and challenges. Instead of giving vague responses like “I work hard” or “I’m a team player,” Gates suggests tailoring your answer to highlight the exact strengths the employer is seeking. For example, if the role demands innovation, a candidate could describe a time when they creatively solved a difficult problem and how that approach could benefit the company.As an example, Gates himself often pointed to his coding achievements, deep passion for software, teamwork skills, and ambition when answering this question during his early career. By showcasing not only what he had already accomplished but also his enthusiasm and hunger to grow, he left interviewers convinced of his long-term potential. He advises modern candidates to take a similar approach: connect your unique skills directly to the company’s needs, show you are motivated to grow with the role, and position yourself as someone who can contribute to both short-term impact and long-term vision.According to Gates, this question is an opportunity for self-awareness rather than self-promotion. He recommends that candidates choose strengths that are relevant to the job while explaining how those qualities have produced real results in the past. On weaknesses, Gates suggests honesty balanced with growth – admitting areas of improvement while showing the steps you are taking to overcome them. This demonstrates maturity and a willingness to learn, qualities employers value highly.Bill Gates’ own answer: Gates admitted that he was not particularly skilled in marketing or sales, but he excelled in product creation and defining features. By acknowledging weaknesses without trying to disguise them, while doubling down on his true strengths, Gates showed the kind of critical self-awareness employers value.Gates points out that this question is less about predicting the future and more about revealing ambition. Employers want to see that candidates have direction and drive. He suggests aligning your career goals with the company’s growth, showing that you want to grow alongside the organization. Even if the long-term vision evolves, demonstrating that you think ahead and are motivated to build a future leaves a strong impression.On this tricky question, Gates advises candidates to strike a balance between confidence and flexibility. Being too rigid about salary can make you seem difficult to work with, while undervaluing yourself may raise doubts about your worth. Gates recommends doing prior research on industry standards and giving a reasonable range instead of a fixed number. He also stresses framing salary discussions in terms of value – how your skills and contributions justify the compensation – while showing openness to negotiation. This demonstrates professionalism and practicality, traits employers respect.For Gates, interviews are not just about answering questions but about telling a story – one that highlights your passion, your potential, and your fit with the company’s culture. He encourages candidates to prepare, practice, and remain authentic, reminding them that the goal is not perfection but connection. By framing common questions as opportunities to reveal character and ambition, Gates believes any candidate can turn a stressful interview into a powerful career breakthrough. Gates reminds candidates that confidence paired with curiosity often leaves a stronger impression than rehearsed answers. Embracing challenges and demonstrating adaptability can set you apart in any competitive interview.","Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates offers advice on how to answer the most common interview questions.

Chennai: While the spotlight was on athletes vying for World Championships qualification, the men’s 400m event delivered a surprise at the National Inter-State Athletics meet here on Thursday. TK Vishal from Tamil Nadu shattered the six-year-old national record, clocking 45.12s and surpassing the 45.21s mark, set by Muhammed Anas Yahiya.Soon after the race, Vishal looked at the big screen and rushed to hug his father. On his bib, the 22-year-old had written: “For my coach Jason,” which he showed to the camerapersons with pride. It reflected the bond he shares with Jason Dawson, the men’s 400m relay coach.What is noteworthy is that he shifted from sprint to 400m just over a year ago and joined the national camp under Jason in December. “I see this as a reward for my hard work. My coach told me to be mentally prepared for the race, and I let go of all the nerves; this is why I was able to set a national record. I am in this position because of my coach,” Vishal said.“I was working hard to align with his (Jason’s) mindset, and although I did not know if I would get the desired results, I trusted him and believed I would do well,” Vishal added.The quarter-miler did not have the brightest of starts after he took up 400m, but it did not deter him.This season, Vishal has breached the 46s-mark five times and has shown good consistency. “The recent training stint in Poland played a vital role in my progress. We need to train and participate in competitions abroad and that would help us progress.”Jamaica’s Jason was full of praise for his ward. “Vishal is a new athlete and what he brings to the table is something that I have been asking the older athletes for. He is a level-headed person, and one thing is that he challenges me,” the coach said.Jason appeared to be disappointed with the news which came out last year that he had a rift with athletes for overtraining them for the Paris Olympics. The national coach also added that he faces a lot of interference in training and would like for that to stop. “Presently, I do not have an assistant coach, and I chose that because I want people to work with me and not against me. It does not matter who you are, you are here to develop and do not let your ego get in the way.The biggest problem since I arrived in India is that I had other coaches’ interference...As far as Vishal’s previous coach is concerned, he did not do that,” Jason added. Meanwhile, in women’s 1500m, Pooja clinched gold after clocking 4:10.68. The performance will help her climb close to the top-50 in the ‘Road to Tokyo’ standings (top-56 qualify) and she might have a chance to qualify for the Worlds.","TK Vishal from Tamil Nadu shattered the six-year-old national record, clocking 45.12s.

Sophie Cunningham's honest opinion on Paige Bueckers comes with a heavy penalty

WNBA star Sophie Cunningham is all over social media, as her recent podcast has gone super viral. She was even fined for being “honest” about Paige Bueckers, and this is the third time something like this has ever happened. However, in the latter part of the podcast, the conversation got even more interesting when Sophie Cunningham revealed something about Justin Bieber lookalike, and that cracked everyone up. She found that hilarious and thought about one and only one thing: how can fans and the audience be so naive? Sophie Cunningham is a fan of Justin Bieber. She confirmed this in the podcast and said that she would be ready to attend a JB concert if he announced one anytime soon.Sophie Cunningham is a Justin Bieber fan, and the fans and media know this because she confirmed it on her podcast, “Show Me Something”. However, she lost it when a random clip of someone who looked exactly like Justin Bieber came forward. She laughed enormously and found it to be super hilarious. “Dude, I think that's f***ing hilarious,” Sophie Cunningham said. “And how do they not know that's not him?. She was surprised as the fans didn’t even know that the lookalike wasn’t Justin Bieber after all.Sophie Cunningham is a Justin Bieber fan and wants to attend a concert as soon as he announces one. “I was just about to say, I think he's a little thicker though.

Good for him, man.”Sophie Cunningham stood up for her teammate Caitlin Clark after her recent injury. After Skip Bayless’s controversial statement about the WNBA lying about her injury, Sophie Cunningham said, “That’s literally bulls***, no one’s lying. When you are an elite-level player, you NOT being able to play is the hardest part”. She slammed the controversy with her bold reply. Hopefully, this time, the Fever player doesn’t get a fourth penalty.The Indiana Fever’s player, Sophie Cunningham, also spoke about Caitlin Clark and how she thinks that the WNBA player is growing bit by bit into a stronger personality. “It's just a day-by-day, legit type of thing. And so yeah, she's close, but you also have to remember, she could be playing if it wasn't in the WNBA by now,” Sophie Cunningham said.Earlier on Thursday, the WNBA star was fined for being brutally honest about Paige Buekers, marking it her third time. She said, “I love Paige to death... but those refs were giving her every frickin' whistle last night... Literally you couldn't touch her... That sh*t is so annoying”.

Pune: It was a rollercoaster qualification round for Abhinav Shaw in the junior men's 10m air rifle event at the 16th Asian Championships in Shymkent, Kazakhstan, on Thursday. However, the young shooter finished on a high and clinched gold in a tense final. Abhinav scored 250.4 in the final to finish on top but only by 0.1 point, ahead of Korea's Hyunseo Lee. The bronze went to China's Sihan Ma with a score of 229.2.Abhinav didn't shoot a great score for his eighth place qualification for the final, but the 17-year-old cleared his mind just in time. The Kolkata shooter began the qualification round with an impressive series of 105.0, followed by 105.2, but the next three series of 10 shots each – 103.3, 104.8 and 103.3 – pushed him down in the ranking.A push on the pedal in the last series saw him shooting 106.5 and barely making it to the top-8. “After first two good series, I got conscious – of my process, my scores, everything – and I got confused. But by the last series, I could gather myself and bring back to my process,” said Abhinav, who was named after his namesake, Abhinav Bindra.Meanwhile, Mansi Raghuwanshi and Yashasvi Rathore won gold and silver in the junior women skeet final. In the junior men's skeet event, Harmehar Singh (52) took silver, while Jyotiraditya Singh Sisodiya (43) won bronze, in a field of 15 shooters from only four countries.","Abhinav Shaw won gold in the junior men's 10m air rifle event at the 16th Asian Championships in Shymkent, Kazakhstan, on Thursday.

Former Indian cricket legend Rahul Dravid has named Australian fast bowler Glenn McGrath and Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralitharan as the toughest bowlers he faced during his 16-year international career spanning from 1996 to 2012. Dravid, who played 164 Tests, 344 ODIs, and one T20I, made this revelation during a recent appearance on, hosted by R Ashwin.During his illustrious career, Dravid encountered numerous world-class bowlers including Shane Warne, Brett Lee, Shaun Pollock, Wasim Akram , Waqar Younis, Shoaib Akhtar, Chaminda Vaas, Courtney Walsh, James Anderson, Stuart Board, and Makhaya Ntini.When asked about the most challenging fast bowler he faced, Dravid specifically highlighted Glenn McGrath's exceptional skills and consistency. He did, however, point out that Akram's abilities were on the downward curve in the fag end of his career.""As a fast bowler, it had to be Glenn McGrath. I thought McGrath was… I kind of played Wasim (Akram) and Waqar (Younis) at the back end of their careers. So it's not kind of fair… People who played Wasim earlier say that he was in a different league, and I could imagine after seeing the videos, I can imagine… And even bowling at the back end of his career, he was damn good.But I played McGrath at his peak. He was a phenomenal bowler. He challenged my off stump more than anyone ever did. Just being able to go close to the stumps, get the bounce and just the level of fitness… He was able to come at you right through the whole day. I have played faster bowlers than him, but in terms of consistency and skill, he must be the toughest bowler I've faced.""In terms of spin bowling, Dravid acknowledged Muttiah Muralitharan's exceptional abilities and relentless approach.""As a spinner, Muralitharan was the best bowler that I played against. Great skill. He had the ability to spin the ball both ways. Especially when he came round the wicket and got the doosra away from you. So, he was someone who was never tired and bowled really long spells. He kept at you and kept at you… and he is just a phenomenal spinner.""McGrath's career statistics demonstrate his dominance in international cricket. He represented Australia in 124 Tests and 250 ODIs from 1993 to 2007, claiming 563 Test wickets and 381 ODI wickets.McGrath holds the distinction of being Australia's most successful fast bowler in Test cricket and maintains the record for the most wickets in ODIs for his country.Muralitharan's career numbers are equally impressive. The Sri Lankan spinner accumulated 800 Test wickets, 534 ODI wickets, and 13 T20I wickets during his international career.Dravid's own career statistics underscore his authority to evaluate these bowlers. He amassed over 24,000 runs across all international formats during his career, establishing himself as one of cricket's most accomplished batters.","Rahul Dravid played 164 Tests, 344 ODIs, and one T20I in a 16-year international career.

Exploring Gabrielle Union and Dwyane Wade’s relationship

The relationship between Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union wasn't immediately accepted by his family. The couple talked about how the NBA star’s family, especially his older sister Tragil, was sceptical of their relationship because the actress was nine years older than him. The Bring It On actor recently talked about how hard it was to gain his family's trust in the beginning of their relationship during a visit on Michelle Obama 's IMO podcast.At first, Dwyane Wade 's family was very skeptical about his age difference with Gabrielle Union. She recently acknowledged that his family wasn't initially supportive of their age difference. In their most recent appearance on the IMO podcast hosted by Michelle Obama, she said:“When I first met his family, the older sisters, who are closer in my age, immediately good. But with Tragil, because she has been the protector… She has been the gatekeeper to keep him sane and to keep him doing everything he needs to do without interference from anybody.”The actress continued by saying that, as she is nine years older than him, both his mother, Jolinda, and his sister, Tragil, were quite sceptical about their relationship.

I just like him, we’ll see where it goes’.”According to Gabrielle Union, it took ""years"" for them to truly ""earn"" each other's trust:“But it took some years to earn their trust and also for them to earn my trust so we could be comfortable equally… Now, it’s easy, because we are all on the same side.”Gabrielle Union and Dwyane Wade's relationship is extensive and includes both their private hardships and their public triumphs.

What Jack Eichel’s selection means for Vegas

All Jack Eichel Goals: 2024-25 Regular Season & Playoffs

Another milestone has been achieved in Jack Eichel's journey through hockey. The Vegas Golden Knights' talented center has officially been named as one of the initial six players on Team USA's preliminary roster for the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina. His first Olympic appearance for the Stanley Cup champion is not only a personal achievement but a win for Vegas hockey. Eichel's presence brings an international spotlight for Team USA and much-needed attention to the growing legacy of the Golden Knights.Adding some balance, leadership, and offensive creativity, Jack Eichel turns out to be very valuable for Team USA. He adds an element of unpredictability to international hockey: his speed, vision, and ability to stickhandle in tight spaces are difficult to contain. The 6-foot-2 winger is a kaleidoscopic piece, able to wax and wane between shooter and playmaker on the power play, and is always the target. In a tournament in which games are decided by trivial margins, Eichel's 200-foot skill set could well be the difference.Eichel’s call-up for the Olympics also resonates outside the rink. For the Golden Knights, his selection raises the franchise to a global level of recognition.Just as Vegas and Eichel secured the 2023 Stanley Cup, the selection for the Olympics tends to elevate the team brand. Las Vegas fans now have to see one of their brightest stars go and represent the country on the biggest hockey stage, nurturing pride and respect internationally. After a set of tough times that have recently plagued the city, the rise of Eichel paints a positive story in favor of recognizing Las Vegas as a serious hockey platform.Also Read: Casey Mittelstadt trade rumors stir Boston Bruins off-season buzz The pathway of Jack Eichel to the 2026 Olympics carries themes of personal triumph yet alludes to something bigger.

Prince William & Kate Middleton's ‘Forever Home’ Dream Leaves Neighbours Homeless





Princess Anne turned 75 on August 15. To mark the day, the Prince and Princess of Wales posted a short birthday wish and shared her newly released portrait of the Princess Royal. Their message read, “Wishing Her Royal Highness The Princess Royal a very Happy 75th Birthday!”The image is part of a set released for the milestone. Shot at Gatcombe Park by John Swannell, the portrait keeps the tone formal and restrained—very Anne. Swannell has photographed her across multiple milestone birthdays, a continuity that suits the Princess Royal’s preference for understatement.There was also an earlier portrait released the week before: a two-shot of Anne with Sir Tim Laurence , taken at Windsor Castle by Chris Jackson ahead of July’s French state banquet. That image drew attention to a sleeker, pulled-back hairstyle, a look Anne also wore at the banquet with her longtime Festoon Tiara.The post from William and Kate landed during the family’s summer break, but the message stayed classic: a clear portrait, a brief line, and no long caption. It matches Anne’s public style and allows the picture to do the talking.As ever, the focus around her birthday was service. Anne is widely cited as one of the monarchy’s hardest-working royals, and official birthday coverage emphasized her decades of engagements and patronages.Family figured in the week’s imagery, too. The Windsor channels highlighted Anne and Sir Tim’s quiet partnership, as well as archival moments from her life—reminders of a career defined by duty, sport and charity more than spectacle.Why does a single post matter? It shows how the Wales household and the Princess Royal present milestones now: warm but minimal, with the visuals carrying the sentiment. For Anne, the emphasis stays on the work rather than the social-media flourish.As the summer break continues, the family is expected to spend time together in Scotland, with no indication of a large public event for the occasion. For the Princess Royal, a steady calendar and a modest celebration remain the norm—and the Waleses’ short message matched that mood.The takeaway: a milestone birthday, a clean portrait, and a brief wish from nephew and niece-in-law—small gestures that say plenty about how Princess Anne works, and how the royal family marks personal events today.","Princess Anne turned 75 on August 15.

Why are Israel’s football clubs playing in Serbia?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/why-are-israels-football-clubs-playing-in-serbia/articleshow/123421510.cms,".

Are sporting bans the answer?



Is UEFA becoming more political?



Must sporting chiefs take sides?







Though Maccabi Tel Aviv's name comes first on UEFA 's fixture list, neither they nor opponents Dinamo Kiev will be playing at home in their Europa League qualifier over successive Thursdays in August.While the clubs play domestic matches in Israel and Ukraine respectively, European football governors UEFA have deemed the countries unsafe for continental competition. As a result, the first leg on August 21 will be played in the TSC Arena in Backa Topola, Serbia, as were their previous European games this term. The team, like many other Israeli sporting clubs, has also played in Belgrade, with Serbia becoming a home away from home.Marko Begovic, an associate professor in sport management at Molde University in Norway and author of the book ""Sports Policy and Politics in the Western Balkans"" told DW there were three main reasons why Serbia ticked the necessary boxes.""Firstly, Serbia enjoys stable diplomatic relations with Israel and has a tradition of cooperation that makes such an arrangement politically viable. Second, Serbia maintains relative neutrality, exercising political ambiguity in these conflicts [the Middle East and Russia-Ukraine] and Belgrade represents a politically acceptable compromise in this regard.And the third is that Serbia possess the necessary sporting infrastructure. ""Serbia is not a member of NATO and Begovic said that, given the long-term policy aim of neutrality in international affairs, and the fact the population is much more concerned with the war between Russia and Ukraine than the one between Israel and Hamas, there are few objections to hosting Israeli teams.""If you look at the wider region, other republics of former Yugoslavia have been hosting Israeli clubs, not only in football, but in basketball as well. So it is not an issue. I would say this is part of institutional memory of the former Yugoslavia,"" he said.Part of that institutional memory is based in antipathy towards sporting sanctions for political or military actions. Yugoslavia, of which Serbia was a part, faced an almost total sporting ban in the early 1990s, which took in the Olympics, the football World Cup and all manner of other competitions.Russia is currently banned from all UEFA and FIFA tournaments but their national football team continue to play friendlies, generally against teams less hostile to their invasion of Ukraine, including a number of African sides and Serbia. The country is also banned from the Olympics, though some of their athletes compete under a neutral banner, and from a host of other international sporting competitions.Ukrainian sides like Dynamo Kiev are free to compete in most sports and will host the second leg at the Lublin Arena in Poland, with Ukraine's European club competition entrants playing at various venues across Europe.Palestine's national football team is recognized by FIFA and the athletes more broadly by the International Olympic Committee. Similarly Israel, as it stands, is still an active participant on the international sporting stage and will, for example, send a team to basketball's Eurobasket tournament that starts in September. The country sent a team to the Paris Olympics in 2024 and is to send athletes to the Winter Olympics in 2026.But a banner reading ""stop killing children, stop killing civilians"" was allowed by UEFA and held up by victims of current conflicts, including Palestinian children, at the recent UEFA Super Cup match between Paris Saint-Germain and Tottenham Hotspur in Udine, hinting at a more intense spotlight in the world's most popular sport.""For now, this is our decision. It is very difficult for me to comment on what could happen in the future,"" UEFA President Alexander Ceferin said in an interview with Slovenian public TV station Odmevi the day after the match, opening the door in the eyes of some for a potential ban. He added that the ""issue of Israel's participation in UEFA competitions is a legitimate question."" But Ceferin also re-iterated that ""in principle, I am not an advocate of not allowing athletes to compete,"" saying that the Russia ban had made little material difference.It's a position Begovic shares.""There has been a very selective approach in sanctioning and banning in sports,"" he explained. ""But either way, the [Ukraine] war is not any closer to an end. The same goes for other war zones. Banning and sanctioning sports will not bring wars to the end. Sports has a limit in that regard. I think sometimes we are expecting too much from sports.""But, for some, including the EU's sports commissioner, Glenn Micallef, allowing Israel to remain on the global sporting stage while they continue to exacerbate the dire situation in Gaza, is avoiding the issue.""When it comes to sports, I think there should be no space in sporting events for those who do not share our values,"" he told Politico, without directly naming Israel.""Sport is a tool that we use to promote peace, through which we promote human rights.""One could argue that this reading of sport's place within politics has been mostly absent in deed, if not in word, in recent years. Within the last two decades, football's World Cup has been hosted by Russia and Qatar, while Russia and China have hosted Olympic Games. In a world of significant geopolitical challenges, sporting organizations are increasingly forced into political decisions that most would rather avoid.","Maccabi Tel Aviv and Dinamo Kiev will not be playing at home in their Europa League qualifier.

A journey home after two years





A first gold gift, a lifetime memory





Viral response and emotional reactions online





A pattern of heartfelt moments in the skies









A touching family reunion between an Emirates cabin crew member and her grandmother is capturing hearts across the internet — thanks to a surprise that blended love, tradition, and a long-awaited homecoming.Zainab Roshna, an Emirates cabin crew member based in Dubai, recently made an emotional trip to Kerala to surprise her grandmother on her birthday, ending a separation that lasted two years. The visit was more than just a celebration; it was her personal mission to honour her grandmother in a way that reflected deep affection and tradition.Having not seen her grandmother in person for a significant period, Roshna decided to travel all the way from Dubai to Kerala solely to be by her side for her birthday. This wasn’t just any visit — it came with a gift that carried emotional and cultural significance: a gold bangle.In a short video clip shared as an Instagram Reel, Roshna documented the moment she presented the gift. The post’s caption highlighted the special nature of the occasion, stating:“Happy Birthday, Ummumma. It was my first gold gift to her, so I was adamant that I would personally honour her. That’s why I flew from Dubai to Kerala.”The scene unfolds with Roshna entering and handing over the gold bangle to her visibly surprised and joyful grandmother. Her expression shifts from shock to a warm, tearful smile — a moment that encapsulated years of love, longing, and pride.The gold bangle, which symbolised not just luxury but familial respect and affection in South Indian tradition, became the centrepiece of the reunion. For Roshna, it was more than a gift — it was a tribute.The video quickly resonated with viewers across social platforms, drawing thousands of reactions and comments. Many users praised Roshna’s dedication, calling the gesture “emotional,” “beautiful,” and a reflection of “true love and respect for elders.”Viewers were particularly touched by the effort and thought Roshna put into making the moment personal — refusing to send the gift remotely and instead choosing to deliver it in person. The sentiment that no distance should come in the way of honouring a loved one deeply struck a chord.This isn’t the first time an Emirates crew member has made headlines for a surprise involving family. In a recently surfaced video that also went viral, another Emirates flight attendant surprised her grandparents on a flight. As they boarded the plane, her grandmother recognized her mid-aisle and, overwhelmed with joy, ran to embrace her. Her grandfather followed with a proud hug, clearly delighted to see his granddaughter in uniform.Both moments, though different in setting, highlighted a common theme — how small gestures can become unforgettable when rooted in love and thoughtfulness.

A mission defined by resolve

“I dedicate this accomplishment to my country, the

UAE

, and to everyone who believes that willpower makes the impossible possible.”

Mount Elbrus: A formidable challenge

Preparation behind the summit

An inspiration for a generation





Emirati adventurer Rashid Ghanem Al Shamsi has successfully summited Mount Elbrus, Europe’s tallest mountain, enduring extreme weather conditions to raise the UAE flag at 5,642 metres above sea level.Rashid Al Shamsi’s ascent of Mount Elbrus, located in Russia’s southwestern Caucasus mountain range, came after navigating snowstorms, freezing temperatures, and rugged, icy terrain. The climb tested physical stamina and mental endurance, pushing through strong winds and challenging visibility across one of the world’s most notorious alpine environments.Al Shamsi dedicated his achievement to his country, stating:More than a physical feat, the ascent represented a symbolic journey. “The ascent was not only about reaching a geographic peak,” he added, “but also about achieving the peak of determination and resolve.”Mount Elbrus is a dormant volcano and part of the Seven Summits, a mountaineering challenge that includes the highest peak on each continent. Towering at 5,642 metres (18,510 feet), it holds the distinction of being the highest point in both Russia and Europe. Its two summits and unpredictable climate make it one of the most demanding climbs worldwide.Due to its elevation, extreme weather patterns, and terrain that shifts between ice, snowfields, and volcanic rock, Elbrus is widely regarded as a severe endurance test even for experienced mountaineers.Before attempting the climb, Al Shamsi committed several months to intense physical and logistical preparation. Training involved climbing smaller mountains and conditioning his body to withstand altitude and cold. He also undertook survival training in extreme weather and developed strategies to deal with known risks such as snowstorms and avalanches.A significant part of his readiness included studying Elbrus’s topography and weather systems in depth. His approach underlined the importance of not just courage, but also calculated planning, discipline, and adaptability in high-risk expeditions.Al Shamsi’s journey adds to a growing legacy of Emirati adventurers representing the UAE on global platforms. By reaching the highest geographical point in Europe and flying his nation’s flag there, he underscored the capability and spirit of the UAE’s youth.His achievement stands as both a national milestone and a personal triumph, reinforcing the message that focused preparation and unshakable willpower can overcome even the harshest physical and environmental barriers.","Emirati adventurer Rashid Ghanem Al Shamsi has successfully summited Mount Elbrus, Europe’s tallest mountain.

UAEFA takes a stand on referee criticism





Al Ain’s post match remarks spark controversy





Legal consequences and available alternatives





Match highlights and milestones from Al Ain vs Al Bataeh









The UAE Football Association has issued a firm directive to clubs after Al Ain FC publicly questioned refereeing decisions in their season-opening win. The Association underscored that legal steps will be taken against any party undermining match officials, marking a decisive move to safeguard the integrity of Emirati referees.The UAE Football Association (UAEFA) released a sharply worded statement warning clubs against challenging the competence or impartiality of match officials. The move follows comments made by Al Ain Football Club after their 2-1 win over Al Bataeh in the opening round of the 2024-25 ADNOC Pro League.According to the Association, any inappropriate public criticism of referees will lead to legal consequences. It emphasized that the authority for developing and overseeing the refereeing system lies solely with UAEFA and is managed through specialized committees and qualified professionals operating within structured frameworks.The statement also referenced a pattern of administrative missteps by Al Ain over the past two seasons. UAEFA said these were previously addressed with professionalism but added that it expects the club to focus on improving its internal processes and refrain from involving itself in areas outside its purview.The controversy began after Al Ain’s head coach, Vladimir Ivić, expressed frustration with the match officiating during his post-match press conference.The Serbian coach stated that his team had scored five times, with three goals disallowed. “For the first time in my career, I saw my team score five goals but the final result was 2-1. We definitely deserved more,” he said.The club also issued an official comment on its platforms, referring to “numerous controversial refereeing incidents” in the game. While affirming support for the domestic refereeing system, the club stated it “firmly rejects the continued occurrence of mistakes that could negatively affect the team’s results in domestic competitions.”In response, UAEFA criticized the tone and content of Al Ain's statements, highlighting the need for all clubs to uphold sportsmanship and show respect for the work of others in the football ecosystem.The Association confirmed that legal action will be initiated against Al Ain FC and any other individual or entity that publicly undermines match officials. It reiterated that complaints about officiating must be handled through formal channels, not public statements.As an alternative for clubs dissatisfied with domestic referees, UAEFA noted that there is an established mechanism for requesting foreign match officials. This provision, however, must be used through the proper channels and approvals.On the field, the match itself was notable beyond the controversy. Togolese striker Kodjo Fo-Doh Laba scored during first-half stoppage time, registering the 9,000th goal in ADNOC Pro League history — a significant milestone for the competition.Al Bataeh responded in the 69th minute with an equalizer from Uzbekistan international Azizjon Ganiev. However, Al Ain sealed their opening victory in the 82nd minute with a decisive header from Abdoul Karim Traoré.The match also marked the debut of Al Ain’s newly installed integrated cooling system at Hazza Bin Zayed Stadium. Over 300 air-conditioning units were operational to enhance fan comfort amid the UAE’s intense summer temperatures. Despite the off-field tensions, fans turned out in large numbers, with long queues at food outlets reflecting the growing attendance and engagement at league games.","UAE Football Association (UAEFA) issued a sharply worded statement warning clubs against challenging the competence or impartiality of match officials.
