NEW DELHI: India captain Rohit Sharma is not taken aback by Yashasvi Jaiswal 's exceptional performance in Test cricket . The young left-handed batsman's success is a direct result of his unquenchable thirst for knowledge and his determination to excel at the highest level of the sport.Since his debut in the middle of 2023, Jaiswal has accumulated an impressive 1217 runs in just 11 Test matches, including three centuries, maintaining an outstanding average of 64.05.Jaiswal's breakout performance came during the series against England earlier this year, where he amassed a staggering total of over 700 runs across the five Test matches played.His consistent and high-scoring performances have solidified his position as a rising star in the Indian cricket team, earning him well-deserved recognition and praise from his captain and teammates alike.""I am not surprised at all because the guy has got real talent. He has got the game to play in all sorts of conditions,"" Rohit said in the pre-match press meet in Bengaluru on Tuesday.""Obviously, very new to international cricket right now, so, very hard to judge. But he has got all the ingredients for success at this level,"" he added.But the early glimpses that Jaiswal showed have left skipper Rohit a pleased man.""He is somebody who wants to learn the game, learn about batsmanship. When a youngster comes into the team, his mindset is quite critical.""He always wants to improve, and is not happy with what he has achieved and which is obviously a great start to a young career. We found a great player. Hopefully, he can continue to do what he has done in the last year or so.""Throughout the history of Indian cricket, numerous exceptional players have lost their way and failed to reach their full potential. Rohit, recognising this pattern, also offered a word of caution to Jaiswal.""It is just about how he manages himself in the next couple of years. But what he has shown us in this brief period of time, you can bet on him to do wonders for the team.""He has come through the ranks. Hopefully, what he has been doing, I hope he continues to do that,"" he said.Rohit also mentioned that Jaiswal's presence in the team provides a unique advantage, considering he is a left-handed batsman.""He has played a lot of domestic cricket, under-19 cricket. He has succeeded as well, and that is why he is playing for India. It does obviously well for our team as well him being a left-hander, being an aggressive batter,"" he added.","Yashasvi Jaiswal has scored 1217 runs in just 11 Test matches, including three centuries.

Mohammed Shami situation: Who exactly is not telling the truth? | Beyond The Boundary

NEW DELHI: Former India captain Anil Kumble has voiced his opinion on who should open for India in Australia in the upcoming Border-Gavaskar Trophy if Rohit Sharma is unavailable for the first Test in Perth.The former India head coach believes that KL Rahul is the ideal candidate to step up in such a scenario and has backed Shubman Gill to excel at the No. 3 spot.With Rohit likely to miss the first Test due to personal reasons, Kumble has suggested that Yashasvi Jaiswal and Rahul should open, keeping Gill at No.3.Kumble believes this combination would maintain balance, as Gill has adapted well to the one-down position. Gill’s notable stint as an opener includes his crucial 91 in India’s historic victory at Brisbane in 2021.Debuting as an opener in Melbourne in 2020, Gill opened for India in 17 Tests before shifting to No. 3 in 2023, showing his versatility across the top order.""You know he (Shubman) is exceptionally talented, skilful and he's done that. He's been to Australia before. Like you mentioned, in Brisbane, he got a wonderful fifty there and he knows the conditions,"" Kumble said while speaking on JioCinema.""I don't want to change that. I know there's a temptation to push Shubman Gill because Rohit is not available in the first Test. But, there's always KL Rahul that name is synonymous with change and adapting to whatever the team wants. Whether you want to open the batting or keep wickets, Rahul Dravid did that, now KL Rahul is doing that,"" Kumble added.Kumble emphasized that Gill’s batting style differs from the more traditional approaches of past No. 3 stalwarts like Rahul Dravid and Cheteshwar Pujara.Kumble feels India can benefit from his ability to adapt quickly to varying match situations. With the series expected to be highly competitive, Gill’s dynamic strokeplay and adaptability could provide India with the edge they need in challenging Australian conditions.""You said, for the last 25 years, there have been only two players who have been consistently playing, and it's a tough role. I mean, both those batsmen, Rahul and Cheteshwar, contributed immensely during that period, and you know you have to balance it out. You could probably be batting the second ball of the test match, or you could be batting much later when the conditions are easier,"" Kumble noted.""But more often than not, you get in there to control that first session and see off the new ball because we know that the Kookaburra Ball after the 1st 25 hours, the best time to bat is between the 30th over and the 60th over. And that's what these two batters did throughout their careers, ensuring that the team was safe and the four number four, number five and number six batters, came in much later into the lineup so that they could comfortably bat and score the runs,"" he said.""So Shubman will have to play that role very specifically in Australia. He may have to change a little bit based on the conditions. He has the ability (to do that) as well,"" he further said.",Former India captain Anil Kumble has voiced his opinion on who should open for India in Australia in the upcoming Border-Gavaskar Trophy if Rohit Sharma is unavailable.

LIVE: India vs NZ 1st day washed out | Virat Kohli’s form | 2025 IPL Retentions

MUMBAI: In a sensational development, India's star wicketkeeper-batsman Rishabh Pant will not lead the Delhi Capitals in IPL 2025 , Times of India has reliably learnt.""Yes, the Delhi Capitals could be looking for a new captain. There are chances that India allrounder Axar Patel may take over as the new IPL captain, or the franchise could be eyeing someone who is captaincy material at the IPL auction (likely to take place overseas in mid-November).Pant, though, is set to be the franchise's top retention. It's just that the leadership group at DC feels that he's better off without the pressures of captaincy,"" the source told TOI.DC last reached the IPL playoffs in IPL 2021, and their best-ever finish in the tournament is when they finished as finalists in 2020, under Shreyas Iyer 's captaincy.Returning from an injury in a horrific car accident which kept him out of the game for a year-and-a-half, Pant led the Delhi Capitals in IPL last season, where they finished sixth, logging six wins and losing as many matches.One possible option for the franchise in the auction, if the Kolkata Knight Riders don't retain him, is Iyer, who led KKR to their third IPL title earlier this year.It's learnt that Pant recently met with Delhi Capitals' co-owners Parth Jindal and Kiran Kumar Grandhi to discuss his future at the franchise.Interestingly, just after midnight on October 12, the 27-year-old posted on X (formerly Twitter), ""If [I] go to the auction, will I be sold or not and for how much ??""Pant has been India's biggest match-winner with the bat in recent times in Test cricket, but his performance in white-ball formats hasn't been at par with his red-ball exploits for India.In 76 T20Is, he has scored 1,209 runs, with just three half-centuries, at an average of 23.25, and a strike rate of 127.26.One solid knock from him was a 31-ball 42 against Pakistan on a difficult pitch in New York in a low-scoring match of the 2024 T20 World Cup , that helped India win by six runs.In the IPL, where he has played for the Delhi-based IPL franchise all through, Pant has scored 3284 runs in 111 matches at an average of 35.31, with 18 fifties and one hundred.At the 2022 T20 World Cup, Pant was pipped by Dinesh Karthik in India's XI.The Delhi Capitals recently appointed former India and Tamil Nadu batter Hemang Badani as head coach for the next two seasons , while also appointing his former India teammate Venugopal Rao as the team's director of cricket.","India's star wicketkeeper-batsman Rishabh Pant will not lead the Delhi Capitals in IPL 2025.

The opener's ferocity, finesse & adaptability have ensured a quick rise up the ranks, attracting lavish praise from his captain. It all bodes well ahead of the looming acid test, the 5-game series Down Under...

LIVE: India vs NZ 1st day washed out | Virat Kohli’s form | 2025 IPL Retentions

BENGALURU: In the short while that Gautam Gambhir has been Team India head coach, he has reiterated one of his key philosophies of acing Test cricket - adaptability.The head coach couldn't have found a better ambassador for this mantra than opener Yashasvi Jaiswal Although questions have been raised on Jaiswal's ability to stretch his current purple patch to the five Tests in Australia beginning next month, his current form and ability to switch gears bodes well. The cool head he bears on his strong shoulders are an added bonus.Given the way he carries himself, it's hard to believe Jaiswal will celebrate only his 23rd birthday in Dec. Mostly likely, he will celebrate the day Down Under. His approach to the game is often modern, although his techniques are classic. He can drop jaws with the ferocity with which he attacks opposition bowlers and yet draw applause from purists with the finesse of his shots.In an age of quick-fix cricket, Jaiswal comes across as a square peg. He loves the red-ball version of the game and is hungry to make a mark. A teen sensation who broke on to the domestic circuit in 2019 and made an instant impact, he has shown that he is an incredibly quick learner.Two years ago, turning up for West Zone in the Duleep Trophy final against South, Jaiswal struck a double ton, but his on-field behaviour left a sour note. His constant sledging of the opposition led skipper Ajinkya Rahane to give him marching orders after he failed to heed the umpires' warning. He was censured by the match referee as well.That incident, luckily, appears to be an aberration. He has adapted well and been a far more disciplined player after breaking into the India team in July last year. In the two Tests away in South Africa . Jaiswal was immediately under the scanner after he scored 50 in two matches (17 & 5; 0 & 28). While he wasn't the only Indian to fail, his failure stood out.Jaiswal showcased his versatility early. In his debut against hosts West Indies in Roseau, he spent 501 minutes at the crease, crafting a 387-ball 171. Yet, in the next match, he appeared equally comfortable clobbering the West Indies bowlers around the park, making a 74-ball 57 without compromising on his instincts. In his 11-match Test career so far, he has been a revelation.In seven home Tests thereafter, he has scored at least a half-century in each match. He has two double centuries, coming in back-to-back matches against England and amassed a staggering 901 runs in the seven home games.Skipper Rohit Sharma has been a staunch believer in the youngster's abilities. ""I'm not surprised at all (by his progress) because the guy has got real talent,"" Rohit said. ""He has the game to suit any conditions. He is new to international cricket and it is hard to judge him right now. But he has all the ingredients for success at this level. It is just about how he manages himself in the next couple of years.""For Rohit, Jaiswal, his opening partner, has been a worthy investment. ""In this brief time, he has shown that you can bet on him and expect him to do wonders for the team. He has come through the ranks and shown what he is capable of. Hopefully, he will continue to do that.""""He is somebody who wants to learn the game and learn about batsmanship, which is always a nice thing,"" Rohit added.","Yashasvi Jaiswal has been a revelation in his 11-match Test career so far.

Adding salt to Pakistan 's wounds after the home team's embarrassing defeat in the first Test against England at Multan , Michael Vaughan has said that the second Test at the same venue may follow a similar script with another ""Pakistan collapse"".The second match of the three-Test series, which England lead 1-0, will enter its third day on Thursday, after Pakistan threw a few punches through spinner Sajid Khan to peg the visitors back.After scoring 366 in their first innings, the hosts reduced England to 239 for 6 at stumps on Day 2 despite opener Ben Duckett's century (114), with off-spinner Sajid registering impressive figures of 4 for 86.While Duckett was going strong, former England captain Vaughan commented that the visitors may take a first-innings lead, which could lead to a finish similar to the first Test.""Early signs this Test could end up the same as the first .. England lead, then Pakistan collapse in the 2nd innings,"" Vaughan posted on 'X'.But 127 runs behind at stumps on Day 2 and with just four wickets in hand, it might happen that Pakistan take a first-innings lead and then build on it.Vaughan's comment came after he had said that dropping Babar Azam from the Test squad was a ""stupid decision"" by Pakistan. However, Babar's replacement Kamran Ghulam went on to score a century (118) on debut to prove Vaughan wrong.""So Pakistan haven’t won in a while .. Go 1 nil down in the series and decide to drop the best player in @babarazam258 .. I guess Pakistan cricket is full of surprises but this tops the lot .. absolutely stupid decision .. unless he has asked for a break !!!"" Vaughan had written on X.Reacting to Vaughan's comment after Ghulam's century, former Pakistan batsman Basit Ali had said that ""Vaughan should be shown the picture of Kamran Ghulam"".",Michael Vaughan says Pakistan may take a first-innings lead in the second Test. England lead the three-Test series 1-0 after winning the first Test in Multan. Pakistan are 127 runs behind at stumps on Day 2 and have just four wickets in hand.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114299863,imgsize-60542,width-400,resizemode-4/114299863.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Ahead of the first Test versus New Zealand in Bengaluru, India captain Rohit Sharma provided an update on Mohammed Shami and revealed that the seamer, who has been away from cricket since November 2023, has developed ""swelling in his knee"" and it has ""put him back a little bit in his recovery"".""To be honest, right now it is very difficult for us to make a call on him whether he will be fit for this series or Australia series.He recently had a setback. He had a swelling in his knee, which was quite unusual while he was in the process of getting fit, getting close to 100%. That put him back a little bit in his recovery,"" said Rohit at the pre-match press-conference.The Indian skipper further added that they don't want to take an ""undercooked"" Shami to Australia for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy and divulged that the medical team has already put a road map in place for him.""So he had to start again fresh. Right now, he is at NCA ( National Cricket Academy ). He is working with the physios, the doctors at NCA. We are keeping our fingers crossed. We want him to be fit. We want him to be 100% fit. More than anything else, we don't want to bring an undercooked Shami to Australia. That is not going to be the right decision for us.""It is quite tough for a fast bowler having missed so much of cricket. Then suddenly to come out and be at his best, it is not ideal. We want to give him enough time to recover and be 100% fit. The physios, the trainers, the doctors have set a road map for him. He is supposed to play a couple of games before he plays international cricket. We will see where he is at after this New Zealand series. Then take a call at what stage of Australia he will be fit for us,"" added Rohit.The development was first reported by The Times of India on October 2 and it also mentioned the high chances of the 34-year-old taking another ""six-eight weeks"" to regain fitness. The report created a stir in cricketing circles and Shami took to social media platforms terming it as ""baseless rumours"".He went on to add: ""Why these type of baseless rumors? I'm working hard and trying my level best to recover. Neither the BCCI nor me have mentioned that I am out of the Border Gavaskar series. I request the public to stop paying attention to such news from unofficial sources. Please stop and don't spread such fake fake fake & fake news, especially without my statement.""Minutes after Shami's posts, TimesofIndia.com reached out to a senior member of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) who backed Shami's version and reiterated that the seamer's rehab is very much on track and he's likely to feature in the three Tests against New Zealand.Little over a week after all the drama, BCCI named the squad for the New Zealand Tests and Shami's name was missing. There was no official word from the Indian cricket board on the star's player's current situation as he continued to be away from competitive cricket since the 2023 World Cup final in November last year.A day after the squad announcement, the BCCI official insisted that Shami was very much on track for New Zealand series and it was only after some developments during his rehab that he wasn't included.""He was very much on track for New Zealand Tests as of that day. There were some developments during his rehab which tend to happen,"" added the official.Who exactly is not telling the truth?Shami said all is well, BCCI official said all is well but the Indian captain Rohit Sharma and TOI report on October 2 mention otherwise. It is further understood that Shami is not close to match fitness right now for the gruelling five Tests in Australia and the situation is very much 50-50.The seamer has been regularly posting rehab videos on social media but the bowling videos have now made way for a lot of gym work in the last few days.The first Test against Australia, scheduled to begin on November 22, is still over a month away but Shami is clearly in a race against time to regain match fitness before the high-profile series.","Mohammed Shami has been away from cricket since November 2023.

BENGALURU: It was a damp start to the landmark 25th Test at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium here, with the opening day of the first Test between India and New Zealand being abandoned without a ball being bowled due to rain on Wednesday.There was always a cloud of uncertainty over the start of play, with the India Meteorological Department having issued an orange alert for the city.The Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA), which is celebrating its golden jubilee this year, would have hoped for better weather. The venue hosted its first Test match in 1974, when a Clive Lloyd-led West Indies tamed Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi and his men by a massive 267 runs.Rain could well have the last laugh in the 25th Test here since more of it is predicated over the next two days. Despite the gloomy forecast, a handful of optimists made their way to the stadium, perhaps banking heavily on the city's fickle weather.However, all they saw was the covers being briefly lifted and glimpses of the likes of Virat Kohli, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Nitesh Reddy and assistant coach Abhishek Nayar. The Indian trio were among the home team players who spent time in the indoor nets at the adjoining National Cricket Academy facility.The Black Caps arrived at the venue at around 8 am but with no sign of the weather improving, they returned to their hotel. They may have felt a sense of déjà vu since their previous match againstAfghanistan in Noida last month was abandoned without a ball being bowled.Ironically, a few minutes after play was called off at around 2.30 pm, rain stopped and the light improved prompting ground staff to take the covers off the pitch for the first time in the day.Skipper Rohit Sharma, who was at the NCA, hopped across and had a good look at the pitch before another spell of rain forced it under covers. The toss has been scheduled for 8.45 am on Thursday with play at 9.15 am, but given the prevailing conditions, it seems like a distant possibility.","First Test between India and New Zealand at M Chinnaswamy Stadium abandoned due to rain.

Indian Premier League franchise Sunrisers Hyderabad are set to spend a jaw-dropping Rs 23 crore to retain the services of South African swashbuckler Heinrich Klaasen ahead of the mega auction, areport said.Klaasen set the IPL on fire last year, where he amassed 479 runs for the finalists at a staggering strike-rate of over 171.Alongside Klaasen, skipper Pat Cummins is also set to be retained by the franchise and they are willing to shell out Rs 18 crore for the Australian all-rounder.Among Indians, Abhishek Sharma is on the list and the franchise is reportedly set to spend Rs 14 crore for the 24-year-old.IPL's all time biggest buy is Australia's Mitchell Starc, who was bought by Kolkata Knight Riders for a record sum of Rs 24.75 crore in the 2024 mini auction.With the deadline for retention set to expire on October 31, SRH are also lining up to lock Travis Head and Nitish Kumar Reddy.Last season in IPL, Head was the top run-getter for the franchise, smacking 567 runs in 15 innings. Abhishek (484 runs in 16 games) was second highest scorer for the side followed by Klaasen.Riding on strong performances from Head, Klaasen and Abhishek, SRH went on to smash the highest-ever team total in IPL -- 287 for 3 against Royal Challengers Bengaluru.In the same season, the side also smacked 277 for three against Mumbai Indians.As per IPL retention rules, a franchise can retain a maximum of six players, including one uncapped player. It would account for Rs 79 crore from the total purse of Rs 120 crore. The retention slabs have been structured as Rs 18 crore for top pick, Rs 14 crore for Player No. 2, Rs 11 crore for Player No. 3, Rs 18 crore for Player No. 4, and Rs 14 crore for Player No. 5. The franchises have been allowed the freedom to pay players any amount within these limits, if the actual payout exceeds the allotment, the excess will be deducted from the auction purse.The actual retention rule reads: ""Retention deduction of overall amount instead of fee per player, in this case of 75 Crs irrespective of what amount is paid to 5 players.

NEW DELHI: Bangladesh cricket team's veteran all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan is set to make his final appearance in Test cricket in front of his home crowd.He has been named in the squad for the first Test match against South Africa, scheduled to commence on Monday.Prior to the second and final Test against India in Kanpur, Shakib had expressed his desire to play his last Test at home against South Africa, provided the Bangladesh Cricket Board ( BCB ) could ensure his safety.The squad for the South Africa series sees Khaled Ahmed as the only omission from the team that recently toured India.Najmul Hossain Shanto (c), Shadman lslam, Mahmudul Hasan Joy, Zakir Hasan, Mominul Haque, Mushfiqur Rahim, Shakib Al Hasan, Litton Das (wk), Jaker Ali, Mehidy Hasan Miraz, Taijul Islam, Nayeem Hasan, Taskin Ahmed, Hasan Mahmud, Nahid Rana.Shakib has been embroiled in controversy, with accusations of his involvement in the murder of a student. However, the Bangladesh veteran was participating in a T20 league in Canada at the time of the alleged incident.Initially, Faruque Ahmed , the new president of the BCB, had rejected Shakib's request for security, stating that the board was not a security agency and could not guarantee any cover for him.However, Asif Mahmud , the sports advisor to Bangladesh's interim government, stated that Shakib would be provided security once his political stance was clear.In response, Shakib issued an unconditional apology for his silence during the civil unrest in Bangladesh, which led to the ousting of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina In a statement on his official Facebook page, Shakib paid respects to the students who sacrificed their lives during the anti-discrimination movement and expressed his sincere apologies to those who were hurt by his silence during this critical period.Shakib also addressed a message to the Bangladesh fans, acknowledging that he would soon be playing his last match.He expressed his desire to bid farewell surrounded by the fans whose applause compelled him to play better and whose eyes welled up with tears when he did not perform well.""You all know that I will soon be playing my last match… I want to say goodbye with all of you around. At the moment of farewell, I want to shake hands with those whose applause compelled me to play better,"" Shakib wrote.""I want to meet the eyes of those who cheered in joy when I played well and whose eyes welled up with tears when I did not. I believe that at this farewell moment, you will all be with me.

NEW DELHI: England’s steady march in the second Test against Pakistan was halted abruptly by Sajid Khan , whose spell of sharp off-spin triggered a rapid batting collapse.After being well-placed at 211/2, England lost four wickets for just 14 runs, finding themselves reeling at 225/6 in the final session of Day 2 at Multan.Sajid’s brilliant bowling performance ensured Pakistan seized control at a crucial phase, leaving England trailing by 127 runs.The collapse began with the dismissal of England’s talisman Joe Root , who had looked comfortable until Sajid deceived him with a well-flighted delivery.On the third ball of the 42nd over, Root attempted a sweep but only managed an inside edge onto his boot, sending the ball rolling into the stumps. His dismissal at 211/3 opened the floodgates.Sajid’s next victim was Ben Duckett , who had earlier anchored the innings with a fluent 114. Duckett had survived multiple close calls, with Sajid repeatedly beating his bat.Finally, an aggressive drive off a full-length delivery found a thick outside edge, and Agha Salman at first slip made no mistake.With Duckett’s departure, England slumped to 224/4, and Sajid celebrated with his signature thigh-slap gesture.In Sajid's very next over, Harry Brook was bowled trying to punch a spinning delivery off the back foot.Brook misjudged the sharp turn, and the ball crashed through the gap between bat and pad, handing Sajid his fourth wicket of the innings.England, suddenly in trouble, stood at 225/5 with Brook gone for just nine.Noman Ali then compounded England’s woes by dismissing captain Ben Stokes for a mere 1. Stokes failed to adjust to Noman’s turn, edging a defensive push onto his pad, and Abdullah Shafique at short leg completed an outstanding diving catch.From a position of strength at 211/2, England were now in deep trouble at 225/6, leaving Jamie Smith and Brydon Carse to steady the ship before stumps.However, the pair managed to stabilize the innings and guided England to 239/6 by the end of the day.Sajid Khan finished the day with figures of 4/86, his devastating spell turning the match on its head.With Pakistan’s bowlers firing on all cylinders and England trailing by 127 runs, Day 3 promises to be a pivotal chapter in this thrilling Test series at Multan.",England lose four wickets for just 14 runs in final session of Day 2 at Multan.

As Indian Super League ( ISL ) returns from the international break with NorthEast United FC hosting Chennaiyin FC at Indira Gandhi Athletic Stadium in Guwahati on Thursday, the home side will look to start afresh and comeback to winning ways.Beginning their ISL journey this season with a 1-0 away win over debutant Mohammedan Sporting Club, NEUFC have lost one and drawn two games thereafter. Sitting in sixth position on the league table, the Juan Pedro Benali-coached side will aim for a win in their fifth tie against the southern opponents, who have four points after three games.Speaking about their opponents, NorthEast head coach Juan Pedro Benali said that the Marina Machans are physically very strong.“We’re playing against a nice team, a team who has a very peculiar style. Owen Coyle ’s style, we know it. They’re a strong team, physically very strong and they don’t give you a chance to breathe. And we hope at home we can do much better than the last game and get the three points,” Benali said in Guwahati on Wednesday.Meanwhile, Chennaiyin have experienced all three results possible once each, and have undergone quite a similar fate like NEUFC after a winning start to the league. They have been on the road for two out of their first three matches this season. Speaking to the media ahead of their third away tie, head coach Owen Coyle praised NorthEast while highlighting the need for his boys to be more clinical.“What you have is two very good teams,” Coyle said on the eve of the game. “Two very attack-minded teams, going all out to win a tough game. NorthEast are always a very dangerous opponent — they were last year and they certainly are this year. I think Juan Pedro Benali has done a fantastic job.”“Equally, we know we have a good team, we know we have good players and can stand toe-to-toe with the best teams in this league when we are at our best. So that’s our focus, being very respectful of our opponents but focusing on our qualities. In truth, we should probably be sitting with 7-9 points; in the last two games alone, we had just under 40 chances, so we know we have to be more clinical,” Coyle added.Due to heavy rainfall in Chennai, the Marina Machans had to travel to Guwahati pretty early to resume training. Expressing his gratitude to the Highlanders for opening their facilities early, the Scottish coach wished for the safety of the people back home.“We haven’t been able to train for the last three days because of the severe weather in Chennai. But, more importantly, we want to make sure everyone’s safe and well, so that’s the priority,” Coyle said.",NorthEast United FC host Chennaiyin FC at Indira Gandhi Athletic Stadium in Guwahati on Thursday.

NEW DELHI: Kylian Mbappe recently joined Real Madrid from Paris Saint-Germain ( PSG ) on a five-year contract, but his transition has been challenging. At 25, the French football star has faced multiple issues off the field.Mbappe, who has been dealing with fitness problems, is involved in a financial dispute with PSG.He claims PSG owes him 55 million euros ($60 million) in unpaid wages and bonuses from the previous season.Additionally, Mbappe is reported to be a suspect in a rape investigation in Sweden. He has dismissed these allegations as ""fake news."" The Swedish prosecutor confirmed the investigation without naming him.Mbappe has taken the financial dispute with PSG to a French league committee. He suggests a link between the rape report and his ongoing legal battles with PSG, writing on X: ""It's becoming so predictable, on the eve of the hearing, as if by chance.""Mbappe rose to fame as a teenager at Monaco and later became PSG's all-time top scorer.In March 2023, he was appointed captain of the French national team by coach Didier Deschamps. Due to a thigh injury, Mbappe was rested for France's UEFA Nations League matches this month.Deschamps defended the decision, stating, ""We need to put the player's interests first, without putting him into difficulty.""Mbappe's strained departure from PSG, where he was sidelined after declaring his intention to leave, may have affected his performance in the European Championships .He scored only one goal, a penalty, for France before they exited in the semi-finals.While Mbappe has scored seven goals in his first 11 matches for Real Madrid, he is still adjusting to his new club.His reception in France has changed, as evidenced by the boos from Lille supporters during a Champions League match. This contrasts with the warm welcome he received after the last World Cup.","Kylian Mbappe recently joined Real Madrid from Paris Saint-Germain ( PSG ) on a five-year contract.

Every kid watches cartoons, right? But I didn’t watch cartoons. I just used to watch sports, tennis specially.“So, my parents were like, ‘she likes it.We have to put her on to that’. So my uncle, he knows tennis coaches. But when I started at the age of 3, the coach was like ‘no, she’s small. She can’t play, she cannot understand anything'.“But I was happy to play tennis, and I was interested in playing tennis.”That was a decade ago, in Mendhasala in Odisha Now 14, not a grown-up yet, Aahan announced her arrival on the big stage by claiming a double crown, the Under-14 and Under-16 girls’ singles titles at the Fenesta Open National championships in New Delhi last week.It gets ever more incredible when you consider that she entered the Under-16 event as a qualifier and went all the way. Besides, she also played doubles in U-16, losing in the second round though.In the U-16 final, Aahan beat Aishwarya Jadhav , the eighth seeded Maharashra girl against whom she has a 1-1 head to head in the ITF juniors circuit. Aishwarya, two years older than the Odisha girl, had won her first juniors title in a Grade 5 tournament in Ahmedabad recently.“I’m happy, but it was very tough,” Aahan, who is currently coached by Santosh Malik, said.“Each and every round was tough. But I was just focused on each and every point. Like, I want to win this point, and next point, like that. So I was fully focused and my target was (to) win both the tournaments.So, I tried my best and the rest is the result (two titles).”Aahan’s first coach was Ajay Nishank, under whose tutelage she was until a year ago when she started working with Malik. She also has access to the Abhinav Bindra Targeting Performance (ABTP) centre in Bhubaneswar, where she is one of the athletes from various disciplines who get free fitness training under a programme by the Odisha state government ’s department of sports.She, along with Tavish Pahwa, was a part of the Asian junior team that was picked for an European exposure trip under the Grand Slam Player Development Programme of the ITF earlier this year.“In Europe, it was tough matches and I was a little bit nervous. But when I started winning matches, then I started to feel confident, like ‘yeah, I can beat them’,” she said.Aahan, while brimming with confidence and optimism, is also aware which areas of her game she has to improve.“I have to improve my serve and forehand. And a little bit in volleys,” she said.“I’m good in volleys. When I play doubles, I do good volleys. But in singles I have to do better because, you know, in singles that is tough. You have to cover the full court.“Like, if the opponent is giving you a lob, you have to cover that. You have to be confident, ‘yeah, I can do this. So I’ll go (up) front’.”For a youngster of her age, Aahan has remarkable clarity of what her long terms goals are and how to get there.“Yeah, in ITF, I want to be in top 100, so I can play the WTA (Tour events). In juniors, if I get in top 100, I’ll get a chance to play junior slams like the Australia open or US Open Junior slam.“Then, I can learn and work more on that thing, and then I’ll collect the points in ITF. Then I can play the Slams.”","Aahan won the Under-14 and Under-16 girls’ singles titles at the Fenesta Open National championships in New Delhi last week.

SEMI LOOMS

SHANGHAI: Former world number one Novak Djokovic , the last surviving member of tennis' ""Big Four"", said he does not plan on stopping any time soon but admitted that the retirement of rivals Roger Federer Andy Murray and Rafael Nadal has been overwhelming.Djokovic, Federer, Nadal and Murray were dubbed the ""Big Four"" during a period of dominance when they won a combined 69 Grand Slam titles and were involved in some of the most memorable matches of the last two decades.Spain's Nadal, who won a record 14 French Open titles, announced on Thursday that he would call time on his career after next month's Davis Cup. Murray retired after this year's Paris Olympics and Federer bowed out in 2022.Speaking after beating Czech Jakub Mensik in the Shanghai Masters quarter-finals on Friday, Djokovic said: ""(Nadal) has been my greatest rival. The rivalry I had with him has impacted me the most in my career by far.""We knew that that moment is coming sooner than later, but it's still a shock, you know.""Roger a few years ago, when he announced retirement and Andy as well this year. I mean, it's a bit overwhelming for me to be honest. I don't know what to make out of it. I still enjoy competing. But part of me left with them, a big part of me.""In his 6-7 (4), 6-1, 6-4 win over Mensik, who was born over a year after Djokovic played his first match on the ATP Tour in 2004, the Serb was pushed hard but fought back to clinch the win.It ensured his progression to a record-extending 78th ATP Masters 1000 semi-final - two more than Nadal.""These kind of matches, against teenagers, it's something that really motivates me,"" Djokovic told reporters after the win.""It keeps me going, and pushes me to really dig deep, and to show to the world that I still got it in my legs, that I can still go the distance with the young guys.""I'm super glad that I managed to win this very challenging match.""Djokovic faces world number seven Taylor Fritz in the semi-finals on Saturday after the American defeated Belgian David Goffin 6-3 6-4 earlier on Friday.""I'm going to have a big server opponent tomorrow, Fritz, so I have to be ready for another difficult match,"" the 24-times Grand Slam champion said.""Quick conditions, if you serve well it's quite a big advantage.""We are entering the last couple of matches of the tournament, and now is the time for me to really try to step it up even more, and hopefully I can get a chance to be in the finals.""","Novak Djokovic says the retirement of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal has been overwhelming.

TOI takes a look at the best five from both these famous rivalries:Federer was the undisputed king and even though he had lost to Rafa the previous year, the Swiss was just unstoppable at that point.Nadal had won the first two sets and was well on course to stopping Federer from winning his first Sunshine Double, but the experience of the Swiss helped him win 2-6, 6-7, 7-6, 6-3, 6-1.Rafa had beaten Federer in the 2005 French Open semifinal, but the rivalry on clay hadn't been settled yet. The Rome final was the first of the clay swing that year and if Federer had won this match, the head-to head on this surface might not have looked as lop-sided. Federer had two match-points in the fifth set Nadal prevailed 6-7, 7-6, 6-4, 2-6, 7-6.Rafa's autobiography starts with how he was feeling when there was a rain-break in this final during the fifth set. The Spaniard had lost the earlier two Wimbledon finals to his greatest adversary and when he went two sets up. Federer then played some of his best tennis to win the next two in tie-breakers. The rain breaks, the fading light - everything added to the drama, till Rafa held after breaking Federer in the 15th game of the fifth set to win 6-4, 6-4, 6-7 , 6-7 , 9-7.Though Nadal had won the Wimbledon final the year before, the popular mandate was Federer was the better player on faster courts. This was the first time they were playing in a Grand Slam outside Roland Garros and SW19, and the stakes were massive. In a match that went to and fro, Nadal prevailed 7-5, 3-6, 7-6, 3-6, 6-2. The loss left Federer in tears and as he cried, it was Rafa who consoled him on the podium.Both were coming back after massive injuries and it was a surprise that the two made the final. Federer attacked like never before using his single-handed backhand as an explosive weapon. But Rafa weathered the storm and was up a break in the fifth set. The last four games of that match was probably the best Federer had ever played while trailing against Nadal. He eventually won 6-4, 3-6, 6-1, 3-6, 6-3.Nadal was trying to emulate Federer and a select few in the history of men's tennis to win all four Majors. Djokovic, around that time, was establishing himself as the best player on hard courts. But Nadal was just in a league of his own that year after winning his second Wimbledon title and went on to beat Novak 6-4, 5-7, 6-4, 6-2 and make a place for himself in history.Five hours, 53 minutes - it went on for that long and by the end of it, the two struggled to stand on their feet in the humidity of Melbourne during the prize distribution ceremony. The fortunes fluctuated, but Novak stood strong. Nadal led 4-2 in the fifth but Novak's resilience came through in a 5-7, 6-4, 6-2, 6-7(5), 7-5 win.Many call it the greatest clay court match of the new millennium. Novak was desperate to break his Roland Garros jinx but Rafa was just being Rafa.
