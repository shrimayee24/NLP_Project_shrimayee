NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Wednesday questioned the decision to host the fourth India–South Africa T20I in Lucknow amid dense fog and severe air pollution, after the match was eventually called off due to poor visibility.Tharoor suggested the game should have been scheduled in Thiruvananthapuram, citing significantly better air quality conditions there.In a post on X, the Congress leader said cricket fans were “waiting in vain” as hazardous conditions stalled play.“Cricket fans have been waiting in vain for the #INDVSSAODI to start in Lucknow. But thanks to dense smog, pervasive in most north Indian cities, and an AQI of 411, visibility is too poor to permit a game of cricket. They should’ve scheduled the game in Thiruvananthapuram, where AQI is about 68 right now!” he wrote.India was scheduled to play the fourth match of the five-T20I series against South Africa at the Ekana Cricket Stadium. However, the toss was repeatedly delayed as thick fog enveloped the venue, forcing umpires to conduct multiple ground inspections through the evening.Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav also targeted the Centre, linking the cancellation of the Lucknow match to the city’s deteriorating air quality.He alleged that the government’s policies were worsening the situation and blamed them for making conditions unsafe for players and spectators.In a post on X he wrote: ""Delhi's pollution has now reached Lucknow as well. That's why the international cricket match scheduled to be held in Lucknow is not taking place. Actually, the reason for this is not fog, but smog. The parks that we had built for Lucknow's pure air, the BJP government wants to ruin them too by organizing investment events there. BJP members are neither kin to humans nor to the environment. Cover your face because you are in Lucknow. ""Fans expressed their disappointment following the announcement of match cancellation.With visibility failing to improve even after several assessments, match officials eventually called off the game. Both teams remained in their dressing rooms for most of the evening as conditions worsened after sunset.The fifth and final match between the two countries will be played at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Friday.The India Meteorological Department had earlier issued an orange alert for very dense fog in several parts of Uttar Pradesh, with visibility at the stadium severely affected.Former cricketers on the broadcast had warned that delaying the start could make it even harder to complete the match, as fog typically intensifies later in winter evenings.The washout came as an added setback for India, with vice-captain Shubman Gill ruled out of the match due to a toe injury sustained during training. Sanju Samson was expected to open the innings in his absence.India continues to lead the five-match series 2–1 against South Africa.",Congress MP Shashi Tharoor questions decision to host the fourth India–South Africa T20I in Lucknow.

H-1B Showdown: Amazon, Google Microsoft Pour Billions Into India as 20 States Sue Trump

NEW DELHI: An H-1B visa holder expressed their frustration over a sudden visa rescheduling that moved their December interview to March 2026 and left them unable to return to the US.The user shared their experience in a post on the workplace forum Blind. He said the rescheduling appears linked to a new social media vetting policy. Officials are now reviewing applicants’ posts on platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn to check for content seen as negative toward the US.“So I am one of those unlucky souls who got hit by the mass rescheduling this week. I had my h1b interview scheduled for December and got an email saying its moved to March 2026. MARCH. That’s literally 3 months away,” the uservwrote.They said the lack of information from employers has made the situation worse. “The worst part is nobody knows what's happening. The immigration team at my company is clueless, HR is giving generic responses like ‘we understand your frustration’ which helps exactly zero percent,” they added.The visa holder said they are currently stuck in India after their I-94 expired and are on unpaid leave.They’ve been relying on personal savings while waiting for updates and said a request to work from his company’s India office had not been answered.The user also noted that starting January 1, visa applicants will be allowed only one free rescheduling. If they miss the March appointment or needs to change it again, a visa fee of about Rs 16,000 will have to be paid.“Thousands of us got hit at the same time. december was supposed to be peak season for h1b stamping and they just wiped out the entire month. people who took expensive flights, booked hotels, all of that just gone,” they wrote.They ended the post by asking if others were facing the same situation and whether they were trying to get emergency appointments or arranging to work from India.The disruptions follow a new US State Department rule announced on December 3 that requires social-media screening for all H-1B workers and their H-4 dependents starting December 15. The rule is slowing down interviews, especially at busy consulates in Hyderabad and Chennai, and has led to mass cancellations of appointments originally scheduled for mid-to-late December 2025. Many of these appointments have been pushed into next year, with some as far out as June 2026.The US Embassy in India has warned that arriving on an old appointment date could lead to denial of entry. Immigration lawyers are now advising H-1B holders in the US to avoid non-essential travel.Under the new directive, all H-1B and H-4 applicants must make their social media profiles public so consular officers can review their online activity.

Are Sherrone Moore and his wife Kelli headed for divorce?

Allegations of an inappropriate relationship, resurfacing Paige Shiver rumors, and disturbing court claims have intensified public scrutiny, raising questions about whether their decade-long marriage can survive the legal and emotional fallout.

Public unity amid private turmoil and escalating allegations

The fallout from Sherrone Moore’s stunning firing and arrest has triggered intense speculation not just about his legal future, but also about the state of his marriage. The former Michigan head coach was recently spotted walking with his wife, Kelli Moore, and their youngest child outside his attorney’s office, marking their first public appearance together since the scandal exploded.While the sighting suggested a united front, questions continue to swirl about whether the pressure from the allegations, arrest, and Paige Shiver related rumors could permanently fracture their decade-long marriage. For many observers, the moment felt less like reassurance and more like a pause in a rapidly escalating personal crisis unfolding in full public view.Sherrone Moore and Kelli Moore have been married since 2015 and share three daughters, with Moore previously describing his wife as his “life partner” in now-deleted social media posts. That carefully curated image collapsed after the University of Michigan announced his termination, stating: “U-M head football coach Sherrone Moore has been terminated, with cause, effective immediately.”The school added that “credible evidence was found that Coach Moore engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a staff member,” a claim that has fueled online speculation, including renewed attention around Paige Shiver.The situation intensified when Kelli reportedly called 911 out of concern that Moore was feeling “suicidal” following his firing. Prosecutors later alleged Moore threatened to take his own life during a confrontation at his accuser’s apartment, telling her, “I’m going to kill myself. I’m going to make you watch. My blood is on your hands. You ruined my life.”Moore now faces felony and misdemeanor charges, is barred from contacting the alleged victim, and must wear a GPS tether. While no divorce filing has been made public, the combination of criminal charges, emotional distress, and lingering Paige Shiver rumors has placed unprecedented strain on the Moore household.Whether the couple’s recent appearance signals resilience or simply damage control remains an open and deeply personal question.Also Read: Were Paige Shiver and Sherrone Moore’s wife Kelli Moore friends?

Ja Morant’s latest ankle setback adds uncertainty as Memphis Grizzlies await his return to full form

Ja Morant’s injury concerns and absences continue to shape Memphis Grizzlies’ outlook against Minnesota

The Memphis Grizzlies will play the Minnesota Timberwolves on the road once more. Guard Ja Morant of the Memphis Grizzlies is back on the injury list ahead of the team's Wednesday night game against the Minnesota Timberwolves. Due to an ankle injury he sustained on Monday night against the Los Angeles Clippers, Morant is now categorized as questionable.Morant finished the game with 12 points, three rebounds, and four assists while playing just 20:58. Morant's ankle issue was a tweak, according to Grizzlies head coach Tuomas Iisalo, and the team is hoping it's not catastrophic.Before making his comeback for last Friday's game against the Utah Jazz, Memphis Grizzlies point guard Ja Morant had been sidelined since mid-November. But since then, Morant has experienced yet another setback due to an ankle injury.After missing the fourth quarter of a Grizzlies victory over the Los Angeles Clippers on December 15 due to a left ankle strain, guard Ja Morant was downgraded to doubtful. Based on Morant's questionable tag for this game, it appears he avoided a long-term issue.As of December 17, his status is still uncertain. After stepping on another player's foot late in the fourth quarter of Monday's 121-103 victory over the Clippers, Morant sustained the injury.In just his second game back from a calf injury, the Grizzlies star was limited in how many minutes he could play. Morant finished the game against the Clippers with 12 points on 4-of-12 shooting, 4 assists, and 3 rebounds. Morant, a two-time All-Star, hasn't yet reached his best during the 2025–26 campaign.After missing ten straight games due to a left calf strain, Morant's return to the starting lineup on Monday was only his second. Due to a sprain on the same ankle, Morant had also missed time during the preseason.He is now shooting 35.7 percent from the field and 19.4 percent from 3-point range while averaging just 17.7 points, 3.5 rebounds, and 7.5 assists per game. If Morant is to return to his All-Star form from a few seasons ago, his shooting stats must improve. In addition to Spencer's absence, Vince Williams Jr. would probably start if Morant couldn't make it.Due to a number of ailments, the Grizzlies point guard has only made 14 appearances this season. Morant has averaged 17.7 points, 7.5 assists, and 3.5 rebounds in those games, but his field goal percentage is only 35.7%.On Tuesday night, Memphis was the 8.5-point underdog in this game; however, the odds have now changed to Grizzlies +7.5 at DraftKings, with Morant labelled as doubtful.Cam Spencer is out for personal reasons, so Memphis will play without him. Spencer has been a significant offensive spark, hitting 63.6% from three-point range and scoring in double digits in each of his last ten games. Given that the Grizzlies decided not to play Monday's hero on Wednesday due to personal circumstances, that movement is noteworthy.Morant has only been in 14 games this season, and when he is in the lineup, the Grizzlies have a 5-9 record. After missing ten straight games due to a calf strain, Monday's game against the Clippers was only his second game back in action.Also read: Ja Morant trade update: Could Miami Heat be preparing a bold move for disgruntled Memphis Grizzlies star?","Memphis Grizzlies point guard Ja Morant is back on the injury list.

Silent Hill Townfall leaked release date



Silent Hill Townfall storyline , protagonist, and gameplay



Silent Hill Townfall is an upcoming title in the Silent Hills series, and it was revealed back in 2022. The game is basically a collaboration between Konami, Annapurna Interactive, and the narrative studio Screen Burn (known for Stories Untold, Observation).A lot of time has passed since the initial reveal of the game via a cryptic teaser, and the project has now vanished from public view. However, a recent retail slip-up suggests that the game could arrive much sooner than anticipated, signaling a continued, aggressive resurgence for the entire Silent Hill franchise.The information about the release date of Silent Hill Townfall was originally leaked on a listing on E-Shop Liverpool Mexico, which is a regional retailer. They displayed a release date of March 26, 2026. The specificity of this date suggests it is unlikely to be a simple placeholder and implies that Konami might have finalized the launch window.The leak has managed to gain a lot of traction after being noted by prominent community figures. With the franchise having seen recent success with Silent Hill 2 Remake and Silent Hill f, momentum could be building for a major announcement.If the March 2026 date is accurate, Konami may be planning a new Silent Hill Transmission event soon, possibly following rumored franchise updates at an upcoming Xbox Partner Preview.However, all of this must be taken with a pinch of salt, given that nothing has been confirmed by Konami yet. As a result, you are advised to wait for official confirmation from the developers.Details regarding Silent Hill Townfall's story, protagonist, and gameplay are scarce. This aligns with the psychological tension the series is known for. The initial teaser hinted at hidden messages and deep-seated horror, a style that perfectly suits the developer.Given the studio's history of creating interactive narrative experiences, fans have been anticipating that Townfall will focus heavily on psychological horror. The game could also use a first-person perspective to immerse you in the creeping dread.The game is expected to be available on major current-generation platforms, including PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. It will mostly capitalize on the renewed interest in the horror universe. If the early 2026 launch window holds, Silent Hill Townfall is set to deliver another unique and terrifying experience just as the series hits peak popularity.This was all you needed to know about Silent Hill Townfall.","A retail slip-up suggests that the game could arrive much sooner than anticipated.

Gisele Bündchen and Joaquim Valente choose movement, family, and privacy

Gisele Bündchen and Joaquim Valente are spending the holidays nowhere near a fireplace, and that feels perfectly on brand for them. While much of the world leans into winter routines, the couple chose movement, sunlight, and open water near their Surfside, Florida home. Their recent jet ski outing was not staged or showy. It felt relaxed, intimate, and deeply familiar, like two people fully at ease with the life they are building together.The scene captured something quieter than celebrity spectacle. Life jackets secured, sunglasses on, they stayed close as they cut through calm blue water. Bündchen looked strong and confident, the result of years of discipline and the jiu jitsu training she has openly embraced alongside Valente. This was not a photo about fashion or fame. It was about rhythm, balance, and shared momentum at a time when their personal world has expanded in meaningful ways.For Gisele Bündchen and Valente, the jet skis were less about thrill and more about connection. Since welcoming their first child together in February, the couple has kept their family life intentionally private. Their son’s name and face remain out of the spotlight, a decision that reflects Bündchen’s growing focus on grounding moments over public noise.Time on the water fits that pattern. It offers space to breathe, reset, and simply be present.Bündchen’s comfort in the ocean is no surprise. Just days before, she wrapped up a demanding photoshoot that highlighted her athletic frame in a one piece swimsuit. Yet even then, the energy felt less performative and more reflective of who she is now. A woman who values strength, health, and freedom over spectacle. Jet skiing, something she has done for years, seems to mirror that mindset better than any posed shot ever could.Her past chapter with Tom Brady remains part of her story, especially as they share two children together. Brady, meanwhile, made news of his own this week by addressing speculation about a possible NFL return.

Frogan declines the Financial Audit invite and explains her reasons publicly





YouTuber Caleb Hammer and Twitch streamer Morgan “Frogan” were involved in a heated exchange online recently, which quickly turned into a huge talking point among viewers. What began as a charity-related offer/invite to Frogan to appear on Hammer’s Financial Audit turned sour. Frogan was not receptive to the invitation, and the situation got even worse.Through X, they took jabs at each other, with Frogan declaring how Hammer would degrade just for content and clicks. The exchange drew strong reactions from fans across YouTube, Twitch, and TikTok. Hammer ultimately replied back to Frorgan’s claims and expressed how he had no intention of shaming her online by inviting her on his show.The whole situation began when Caleb Hammer offered to match a $10,000 charity donation if Frogan appeared on his popular Financial Audit show. A fan circulated a clip from his livestream about the invitation, in which Hammer again publicly extended the offer by commenting on it.

She wrote, “I don’t need a YouTube financial advisor to try to degrade me for content since that’s what’s popular."" She also addressed speculation around her income, explaining that she no longer earns ad revenue on Twitch after a past ban.According to Frogan, that loss forced her to rely more heavily on subscriptions, which she described as unpredictable. She added that she is actively working to build income outside of Twitch, including behind-the-scenes production work for other creators. Frogan made it clear that she felt her financial situation was not a fit for Hammer’s show.She finally wrote, “So no - I will not be coming onto your show.

How Mike Sullivan and Jon Cooper set the standard highest-paid NHL coaches

The Highest Paid NHL Coach in 2025 💰

What makes Jared Bednar, Bruce Cassidy, and Peter DeBoer worth millions?



The topic of the highest-paid coaches in the NHL has come to the forefront and is being widely talked about, mainly due to the fact that the league is becoming more and more popular. The climb in TV ratings and the increase in fan interest to a level that has not been seen in decades have made it clear that the NHL teams are willing to pay good money for having the best coaching staff in place. The teams from big cities are no longer at the stage where they are hesitating to spend a lot on coaching, as they are convinced that the right voice and vision can swing the Stanley Cup race their way.This conviction has been the main reason behind the changes in the salary pattern of head coaches. The information disclosed by sources such as Front Office Sports, The Athletic, and Hockey-Reference shows that just a handful of coaches are still able to command salaries that were regarded as unbelievable in the hockey world not so long ago. These contracts not only take into account the past success but also the growing importance that the teams attach to the art of tactics, controlling the locker room, and making stable long-term commitments.Mike Sullivan is alone at the top of the list after he reset the market in May 2025. The New York Rangers enticed him away from the Pittsburgh Penguins, making him the highest-paid coach in NHL history with a reported $6.5 million per year contract.Sullivan has the amazing credentials of being the coach who led the team to back-to-back Stanley Cups in 2016 and 2017, and the Rangers’ management obviously saw him as the missing puzzle piece for their championship aspirations.The head coach of the Tampa Bay Lightning, Jon Cooper, comes in at the second position with a salary of about $5.3 million per year. Cooper, the longest-serving coach in the league, has led Tampa Bay to four Stanley Cup Finals and two victories, thus creating one of the NHL's modern dynasties with his approach of consistency and adaptability.Underneath that excellent layer comes the Colorado Avalanche, coach Jared Bednar, who takes home a little less than $5 million annually. The very first professional hockey team for Bednar was the Colorado Avalanche, where he has molded the team into one of the brightest contenders and Stanley Cup winners with his fast, disciplined style.Following the mentioned coach is Bruce Cassidy, the Vegas Golden Knights head coach, who rakes in $4.5 million each year. His value was proven when he led the Knights to their first-ever Stanley Cup in 2023, thus justifying the franchise's daring investment.The fifth spot on this list is taken by Dallas Stars coach Peter DeBoer, who earns close to $4.25 million. He may not own a Stanley Cup ring, but his playoff streak and many Finals appearances still place him among the most trusted coaches in the league.The upswing in coaching salaries in the NHL clearly points to a shift in the league’s focus. Today’s teams are not just looking for a coach with an impressive track record, but a multimillion-dollar necessity for everyone involved to aim for the ultimate hockey prize.Also Read: NHL Trade Rumours: Phillip Danault, Ryan Strome, Mason Marchment linked to potential trades","Mike Sullivan is the highest-paid coach in NHL history with a reported $6.5 million per year contract.

The Minnesota Timberwolves and Memphis Grizzlies, two Western Conference playoff contenders, will square off on Wednesday night. Anthony Edwards and Ja Morant are both listed as questionable for this game on the injury report.The Timberwolves are currently 7.5-point favorites in the most recent DraftKings odds because Edwards is officially labelled as questionable for Wednesday's game. Due to a right foot injury that has kept him out of the last two games, Edwards' questionable designation on Wednesday was attributed to injury maintenance.Anthony Edwards, a star player for the Minnesota Timberwolves, has missed the team's previous two games due to a foot ailment, but it looks like he could make a comeback on Wednesday night against the Memphis Grizzlies.It's still uncertain if Anthony Edwards will start for the Timberwolves on Wednesday night against the Memphis Grizzlies after missing the previous two games due to right foot pain. The official announcement read:“Edwards (foot) is questionable for Wednesday's game against the Grizzlies, Dane Moore of 'The Dane Moore NBA Podcast' reports…”Despite Edwards' injury, the Timberwolves have won consecutive games and are currently 17-9 in the 2025–26 campaign, good for the sixth seed in the Western Conference.This season, Edwards has sustained a few injuries. He missed several games early in the season due to a hamstring problem.In an interview with KFAN-FM 100.3 on Tuesday morning, head coach Chris Finch stated:""It's definitely improving. He's still day to day... We have practice here this morning, and we'll see what he looks like coming in. But he was able to move around and get up some shots yesterday. We're headed in the right direction, but I'm not sure of an exact return time just yet.""Nevertheless, the All-NBA guard is shooting 50.0 percent from the field and 41.6 percent from beyond the arc while averaging 28.7 points, 4.9 rebounds, and 3.8 assists per game. Earlier this month, he ended a six-game run of games with 30 or more points, but in his most recent game, he scored 40.Edwards would be worth considering for Minnesota's prop market if he returns on Wednesday. My favorite play for him on December 17 is shown here.Edwards' next chance will be on Friday night when the 24-2 Oklahoma City visit the Wolves in Minneapolis if he doesn't play on Wednesday. With two victories over the weekend, including one against the Golden State Warriors in Stephen Curry's comeback game, the Timberwolves have generally performed well in Edwards' absence.In the Timberwolves' second consecutive game without star Anthony Edwards, Minnesota defeated the Sacramento Kings 117-103 on Sunday night thanks to 24 points and nine rebounds from Julius Randle.

From Texas prodigy to NFL

Why did Miami turn to Quin Ewers now?

Also Read:

The Miami Dolphins have turned to an unexpected name at quarterback as their 2025 season takes another sharp turn. Following Tua Tagovailoa ’s benching after a string of disappointing performances, rookie Quinn Ewers is set to make his first NFL start, stepping into the spotlight against the Cincinnati Bengals. For many fans, the obvious question now is simple: who exactly is Quinn Ewers?Quinn Ewers arrives in Miami with a college resume that once made him one of the most talked-about quarterback prospects in the country. A former Texas Longhorns star, Ewers played a central role in leading the program back to national relevance. During his time in Austin, he guided Texas to consecutive College Football Playoff appearances and finished his college career as one of the school’s most productive passers.Statistically, Ewers ranks third all-time at Texas in passing yards and passing touchdowns, throwing for over 9,000 yards and 68 scores. His best season came in 2024, when he threw 31 touchdowns and earned All-SEC and All-Big 12 honors across his college career. Despite that production, questions about arm strength and consistency pushed him down draft boards.Ewers was ultimately selected by the Dolphins in the seventh round of the 2025 NFL Draft, taken 231st overall. The slide reflected league-wide skepticism about his long-term upside as a starter, but Miami viewed him as a developmental option with strong football IQ and poise.The decision to start Ewers came after Miami’s 28-15 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers, a game in which Tagovailoa struggled under pressure. Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel admitted afterward that quarterback play was “not good enough,” signaling that changes were coming. With Miami eliminated from playoff contention, the team has opted to evaluate its younger options rather than stick with the status quo.Notably, Ewers was chosen ahead of former first-round pick Zach Wilson, a move that underscores the coaching staff’s desire to see what the rookie can offer in live action.At 22, Ewers brings solid size, a quick release, and a reputation for processing defenses well. He is comfortable operating short and intermediate passing concepts and has shown touch and anticipation when protected. However, concerns remain about his deep-ball consistency, pocket awareness under heavy pressure, and injury history dating back to college.Whether he emerges as a long-term option or settles into a backup role, Quinn Ewers now has the chance he’s been waiting for, and the Dolphins are watching closely.","Quinn Ewers is set to make his first NFL start against the Cincinnati Bengals.

Why Ohio University suddenly fired head football coach Brian Smith just days before the bowl game,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/why-ohio-university-suddenly-fired-head-football-coach-brian-smith-just-days-before-the-bowl-game/articleshow/126048287.cms,"Ohio football coach Brian Smith fired (Getty Images)

Ohio University fires head coach Brian Smith amid misconduct allegations

Ohio University’s football program woke up to turmoil at the worst possible moment. With a bowl game days away and a season of promise still fresh, the school made a decisive move that sent shockwaves through Athens, Ohio. On Wednesday, Dec. 17, the university announced it had fired head football coach Brian Smith, citing allegations serious enough to terminate his contract for cause. The timing, the language, and the lack of detail instantly raised questions far beyond the win loss record.For a program still building momentum, the decision lands heavy. Smith was not only less than a year into his tenure, he was also coming off a solid season that suggested stability. Instead, Ohio University now finds itself searching for answers, clarity, and yet another head coach as the Bobcats prepare for postseason football under an interim leader.In its official statement, the school said, “The termination follows an administrative review of allegations that Smith violated the terms of his employment agreement by engaging in serious professional misconduct and participating in activities that reflect unfavorably on the University.”The university offered no further specifics, leaving fans and observers to read between carefully chosen lines.Smith, 45, had been placed on leave on Dec. 1 for undisclosed reasons, a move that hinted at deeper issues behind closed doors. Just 364 days earlier, he had taken over the program after Tim Albin departed for UNC Charlotte. On the field, results were steady. Ohio finished 8-4 this season, building on the foundation of recent success and remaining competitive in the Mid American Conference.The response from Smith’s legal team was swift and forceful. His attorney, Rex Elliott, issued a statement saying his client is “shocked and dismayed” by the firing. Elliott added, ""We vigorously dispute Ohio University's grounds for the termination for cause of Coach Brian Smith. He is shocked and dismayed by this turn of events, and we plan to fight this wrongful termination to protect his good name.” He continued, ""Coach Smith is an ethical man who has done an exemplary job for the University. He wants nothing but the best for the players, coaches, and the entire Bobcat community.""With Smith gone, defensive coordinator John Hauser steps in as interim head coach, tasked with leading the Bobcats into the Frisco Bowl against UNLV on Dec. 23. Meanwhile, the university confirmed that a national search for a permanent head coach, its third in three seasons, will begin immediately.Smith’s dismissal also follows a broader trend of late season upheaval in college football. Just last week, Michigan fired head coach Sherrone Moore after an investigation found “credible evidence” of misconduct, days before a major bowl appearance. For Ohio University, the immediate challenge is focus. The longer term test will be restoring trust while keeping a once promising program from losing its footing.Also Read: Myles Garrett’s viral kiss with Chloe Kim leaves her dad hilariously cringing as Browns star chases history","Ohio University fires head coach Brian Smith amid misconduct allegations.

WATCH: Fans' reactions after the match was abandoned

NEW DELHI: Cricket fans poured their frustration onto the cold, foggy night outside the Ekana Cricket Stadium on Wednesday after the fourth T20I between India and South Africa was abandoned without a single ball being bowled, leaving thousands disappointed and empty-handed.Scheduled for a 7:30 PM IST start, the match never got going as dense fog — officially termed “excessive fog” but widely acknowledged as smog — enveloped the ground. After six inspections, the final one at 9:25 PM, umpires called off the contest, prompting a slow, silent exodus of fans who had waited for over two hours in the stands.For many, the disappointment ran deeper than just a lost evening of cricket. “I sold three sacks of wheat and came here to watch the match,” one fan told ANI, his voice shaking with emotion. “I want my money back.” Another supporter said refunds were beside the point. “Tickets and reimbursement don't matter. We wanted to see our Indian team play.”“I am heartbroken,” said another fan as visibility continued to worsen and the stadium lights faded into the haze.Under the BCCI 's refund policy, spectators are eligible for reimbursement (minus fees) if a match is abandoned before a ball is bowled.Yet the mood among fans suggested compensation could not make up for the experience they had missed.Inside the stadium, the signs of concern were evident early. Players cut short their warm-up by 7:30 PM and returned to their dressing rooms. Star all-rounder Hardik Pandya was seen wearing a surgical mask, while the Air Quality Index reportedly hovered above 400 — a hazardous level — raising fresh questions about player safety.By 9 PM, even the most patient spectators began to leave as the cold intensified and the smog thickened. BCCI vice-president Rajeev Shukla briefly walked onto the field during one inspection, his body language reflecting the collective disappointment.The abandonment has reignited criticism of the BCCI's scheduling during peak winter in north India, where pollution and poor visibility are recurring concerns. Fans questioned why the match wasn't scheduled earlier in the day, a move that might have ensured play.With no reserve day, both teams now head to Ahmedabad for the fifth and final T20I on December 19, with India leading the series 2–1.","The fourth T20I between India and South Africa was abandoned without a ball being bowled.

Prashant Veer's parents react after their son gets a Rs 14.20 crore IPL deal

Ravichandran Ashwin has weighed in on the fierce bidding war for Australian all-rounder Cameron Green at the IPL 2026 mini auction, pointing out that Chennai Super Kings missed a major opportunity. Kolkata Knight Riders eventually secured Green for a record Rs 25.20 crore, making him the priciest overseas player in IPL history.Both KKR and CSK were expected to compete heavily for Green, one of the most sought-after names in the auction due to their larger budgets. While both franchises aggressively pursued the young all-rounder, CSK withdrew once the bidding crossed Rs 25 crore.Ashwin felt KKR could have handled their bids differently to put more pressure on CSK. ""If KKR had been slightly patient, like some other franchises, like Punjab, took their time with the bidding. If KKR had also bid like that, then I think CSK would have let go of Cameron Green much more earlier. KKR felt that CSK bid on Green because they had to,"" he said on his YouTube channel.Despite CSK missing out, Ashwin emphasised Green’s value as a player. ""I felt Cameron Green would have been a great addition to CSK, I think they missed a trick, according to me. Whatever said and done, it is not about the price point, Green is a generational talent, and it is a brilliant acquisition for KKR,"" he added.Cameron Green is set to join his third IPL franchise, having previously played for Mumbai Indians and Royal Challengers Bangalore.

Dylan Harper shines in NBA Cup final loss as Spurs struggle to adjust and contain Knicks duo

The San Antonio Spurs were certain to win the NBA Cup after defeating the reigning champion Oklahoma City Thunder on Saturday night in the semifinals. The Spurs got off to a great start, leading by five points at the end of the first three quarters. Regretfully, the Knicks won by 11 points after outscoring San Antonio 35–19 in the last period.With two minutes remaining in the third quarter, Victor Wembanyama made a deep 3-pointer to put San Antonio ahead 92-81. Dylan Harper of the Spurs now talked about the sorrow following the defeat. After the San Antonio Spurs' 124-113 loss to the New York Knicks in Tuesday's NBA Cup final at T-Mobile Arena, the youngster offered his opinions.Harper discussed the lessons he learnt from his early high-stakes games after the game.“It was an unbelievable experience to be a part of this…I’m 3 months into the NBA and I get to go through things like this with a great group of guys,” Harper said.Harper stressed the value of effort and concentration when asked about lessons for upcoming high-pressure games, he continued:“It’s do or die. You’ve seen the level of intensity rise up for us and them.Obviously, they came out with the win. But for us, it’s not taking anything for granted; I think that’s the biggest thing. When we all go out there, we all know that we’ve got to play 110% in order to win things like this.”Despite their loss, San Antonio is still among the best teams in the Western Conference and seems ready for a long postseason run. Harper admitted that performing on a platform with such high stakes was difficult. He added:“The mindset we went into the game… we got away from it in the fourth quarter, but overall we’re going to take a lot from it and apply it to the next time.""The rookie emphasized the team's physicality and effort. He then continued:“You see how hard we’re playing out there, diving for loose balls, going to get offensive rebounds, just doing anything we could do to help our team win..”Harper also discussed how his father, a five-time NBA champion, advised him to maintain his composure throughout demanding seasons.“He always tells me there’s 82 games in the season. Every game isn’t going to go your way, but staying levelheaded through it all is the biggest thing he’s told me,” Harper said.It's only their second game together, Harper said, reflecting on the team's development. Nothing to get too worked up over. It was undoubtedly a worthwhile learning experience to be on the side. They even learnt a lot about themselves from it.During the same interview, Harper further talked about the challenges of playing half-court offence when important teammates have just returned. He said:“Vic just got back, Steph just got back, and all of us were out at one time. Finding how to play with each other at a high level comes with time and experience..”Despite having seven players in double figures at the end, San Antonio was unable to match the 53 points scored by Jalen Brunson and OG Anunoby. New York also finished the game with 17 more rebounds, dominating San Antonio on the glass.San Antonio's most outstanding player in the loss was rookie Dylan Harper, who led the team in scoring with 21 points off the bench.

Details on Toronto Maple Leafs captain Auston Matthews' net worth of $30 million

Auston Matthews remains the poster boy of the Toronto Maple Leafs and a highly marketable athlete in the NHL. Being picked first overall in the 2016 NHL Draft, Matthews has performed on an elite level since then, earning key personal awards, including the Hart Memorial Trophy and several Maurice ""Rocket"" Richard Trophies.As with the captain and offensive leader of the Maple Leafs, Matthews has an influence in more than just goals. His endorsing portfolio, long-term contracts, and investments have greatly enhanced his financial health, and his income became a common subject of NHL news and league-wide talk in the build-up to the 2025 season.By 2025, the net worth of Auston Matthews is estimated at around 30 million dollars, as per the estimated public financial estimates. Most of his fortune is due to NHL deals with the Toronto Maple Leafs, and endorsements and strategic investments supplement his earnings.The Toronto Maple Leafs have Matthews on a four-year contract of $53 million (cap hit of $13.25 million annually), which will expire at the conclusion of the 2027-28 NHL season. His income package, to run in the 2025-26 season, consists of a fairly small base salary, with a large signing bonus, usual with high-profile NHL players.Matthews already has a total salary of over 90 million dollars, making him one of the 60 all-time players in league history in terms of career earnings. His estimated income from hockey will exceed $110 million by the close of his current contract, which will further entrench his financial legacy.Outside the rink, Matthews enjoys large-profile endorsement deals with Nike, Fanatics, Upper Deck, RBC, and Uber.

DEHRADUN: Major General Lakhwinder Singh (retd), 77, hung up his boots in 2006 after nearly four decades of service in the Army. Commissioned in Dec 1967, he fought the 1971 Indo-Pak war as a 23-year-old captain attached to Field Regiment in the Dera Baba Nanak sector of Punjab. As the country prepares to celebrate Vijaya Diwas on Tuesday, he recalls an episode involving a Pakistani soldier that he says remains etched in his memory.Maj Gen Singh, who is also credited with the innovative use of artillery during the Kargil War that turned the tide in India's favour, shared the anecdote with TOI over the phone from his Delhi home.""I fought the adversary in the Dera Baba Nanak sector opposite Kartarpur Sahib on the western border. A few days after the war ended on Dec 16 with the declaration of a ceasefire, I was asked to lead a small contingent to exchange sweets and pleasantries with Pakistani counterparts to mark Eid,"" he said.""After reaching a common spot near the border, we exchanged greetings and sweets. After a few minutes, one of them asked about the officer handling artillery on our side, which was me. No one from our side revealed my name, but asked why they wanted to know.They said it was because artillery had caused heavy damage to them,"" Maj Gen Singh added.He recalled that soon after, a Pakistani soldier looked towards him and said, ""Agar India ke officers aur Pakistan ke jawan mil jaayen to duniya mein koi humein shikast nahi de sakta (If Indian officers and Pakistani soldiers come together, no one in the world could defeat us)."" ""I simply smiled and thanked him,"" he said.Maj Gen Singh described the moment as a testament to the ingrained ethos of Indian Army officers to lead from the front, unlike most of their Pakistani counterparts.""Having said that, it is not that Indian soldiers are not brave — they are extremely courageous. But the statement surprised us. We heard something similar again more than two decades later during the Kargil War, which suggested that stories about Indian Army officers were passed down generations on the other side,"" he said.""In the 1971 war, we largely encountered Pakistani JCOs and NCOs fighting at the front, which further reinforced that soldier's remark,"" he added.Lt Gen Mohan Bhandari (retd), who served alongside Maj Gen Singh during the Kargil War, echoed the Pakistani soldier's observation.""It is well known that Pakistani officers rarely lead their men from the front, unlike Indian Army officers. Indian officers are trained to lead from the front, not issue orders from behind,"" he said.""That is why the proportion of Indian Army officers making the supreme sacrifice during conflicts is higher. They are prepared to kill and to die for their men without a second thought,"" Lt Gen Bhandari added.The septuagenarian veteran also recalled another incident from the 1971 war in the Dera Baba Nanak sector, describing it as ""something divine"".""It was Dec 6, 1971. I, along with soldiers including those from 1/3 Gorkha, was tasked with attacking an enclave held by the Pakistani Army. The operation began in darkness, with heavy firing from our side,"" he said.""While advancing, we encountered a Pakistani pillbox, which we fired upon for three to four minutes — a significant duration in combat. We were certain that anyone inside would have been killed. Just then, a Pakistani soldier emerged from the pillbox and ran towards safety. We froze and could not bring ourselves to pull the trigger. It felt like the Almighty had willed that he live,"" Maj Gen Singh said.","Maj Gen Lakhwinder Singh (retd), 77, hung up his boots in 2006 after nearly four decades of service in the Army.

JALANDHAR: One moment he was enjoying kebabs on Bondi beach. The next, he was running headlong towards a hail of bullets.The Bondi shooting, horrifying as it was, also saw heroism by ordinary individuals, one of whom was Punjabi-Sikh origin New Zealander Amandeep Singh Bola, who sprinted in the direction of the gunfire, saw one of the shooters stagger back upon being hit by a police bullet, and pounced on him.Bola, 34, who works as a personal trainer in Australia, kicked Sajid Akram's gun away, held him down, and locked up his arms in case he tried to use any other weapon. ""I could feel him dying under me,"" Bola, whose roots are in Punjab's Nawanshahr, told TOI on the phone on Wednesday.""I was having a kebab when I heard the gunshots. At first, I thought it was firecrackers, but soon I saw men and women running away in fear. I started running in the direction of the gunfire. On the way, I tried to ask some people what happened, and figured out that two gunmen were shooting at people on the beach,"" Bola said.As he neared the footbridge where the shooters had positioned themselves, he slowed down and began advancing stealthily to try to get as close to them as possible before he made the final lunge.""When I saw one of them dropping down on the footbridge, I was just focused on getting him,"" Bola told TOI.""I saw police shoot at one of the gunmen. I sprinted towards him, pounced upon him, and held his arms behind his back. A policeman also helped and asked me to keep a tight hold and not let him go. I could feel that he was dying while I was sitting over him. I told police that he seemed to be taking his last breaths. In moments, policemen took control of him,"" he recalled.A short mobile phone video shows Bola, clad in a white T-shirt and shorts, sitting on Sajid's back, holding his arms, as a policeman handcuffs the other shooter, Sajid's son Naveed Akram. A man runs up and kicks Sajid in the head.""As I got up, there was a strong adrenaline rush. I felt like vomiting. People around me comforted me. Bondi has people from multiple cultures, and that brief moment reflected the true spirit of multiculturalism. A French guy gave me coconut water, two Africans remained by my side until I got comfortable, and a few others also stayed around, just to be close,"" said Bola.Asked how he went against the natural instinct of running away from danger, Bola said, ""In fact, I acted instinctively. My instincts took me there. I was only thinking of helping people in whichever way I could. But once I spotted the shooter, I was focused on getting him."" He said he hasn't been able to sleep properly after the tragedy.Bola said his family hailed from Naura village near Banga in Nawanshahr district (around 100km from Chandigarh).

“I Supported You Twice, But Never Again” Nitish Kumar Hits Out At RJD

SRINAGAR: Bihar CM Nitish Kumar ’s act of removing the face veil of a Muslim woman during a public function has set off a war of words far away in J&K, where CM Omar Abdullah has accused former CM Mehbooba Mufti of committing similar “unsecular act” by removing the burqa of a legitimate voter years ago.“Have you forgotten the way Mehbooba Mufti removed the burqa of a legitimate voter inside a polling station years ago. The Bihar CM’s act is a continuation of that. We have seen it before. That incident was regretful, and this too is regretful,” Omar told reporters on the sidelines of a tourism conference here.“Earlier, Nitish Kumar was considered a secular leader, but he is now slowly showing his true colours,” the CM said.The PDP was quick to react to Omar’s comment on Mehbooba. Spokesperson Mohit Bhan said, “Nitish Kumar humiliates a Muslim woman in public and Omar responds by attacking Mehbooba Mufti. This is his complicity.”PDP’s Iltija Mufti described Omar’s comments as “shameful.” “How shameful stepping in to defend a man who pulls a Muslim woman’s niqaab in full public view.

“Asmon can do whatever he wants with his 10k, I’ll match that 10k donation to a charity of ur choice or you can choose..5k to you,”

Caleb Hammer pulls Frogan into financial audit as streamer drama escalates





Caleb Hammer has publicly invited Twitch streamer Frogan to appear on his YouTube show Financial Audit, tying the offer to a major charity donation amid ongoing backlash involving Asmongold. The finance creator stepped into the situation after Frogan went viral for an emotional stream where she spoke about serious money stress, declining income, and the mental toll of a legal dispute linked to Ethan Klein. Asmongold later reacted to the clip, questioning parts of her story and drawing wider attention from the commentary and finance side of YouTube. With interest growing, Hammer made his move, framing the invite as both content and potential financial help.In his public message, Hammer said he would match a $10,000 charity donation connected to Asmongold’s involvement or, alternatively, give Frogan $5,000 directly.Hammer wrote. The proposal quickly spread across social media, with viewers debating whether the offer was genuine support or another example of creators turning personal struggles into viral moments.Hammer’s show Financial Audit is known for breaking down guests’ budgets, debts, and spending habits on camera, often in a blunt and confrontational style. His invite to Frogan came after she revealed she streamed fewer than 100 days this year and struggled to afford basic expenses, claiming the stress of lawsuits and online pressure hurt both her finances and mental health. By linking her appearance to a charity donation, Hammer turned the situation into a high-stakes offer share her financial details publicly, and in return, a large sum goes to charity, with optional direct cash support.The offer also pulls Asmongold further into the conversation, even though Hammer made it clear the money would be separate from Asmongold’s own choices. For some viewers, it looked like a rare chance for transparency and real help. For others, it raised concerns about mixing charity, criticism, and entertainment in a highly emotional situation.In the end, the decision now rests with Frogan. Accepting the invite could bring clarity to her financial claims and immediate relief through charity or cash. Declining it may help her avoid further scrutiny but keep questions unanswered. Either way, Hammer’s move shows how fast personal creator struggles can turn into public, high-profile content once major names step in.Also Read: AugieRFC’s channel suspended by YouTube AI moderation, claims violation was fake",Caleb Hammer invited Twitch streamer Frogan to appear on his YouTube show Financial Audit.

Fame, safety concerns, and a lifestyle Nichols no longer wanted





Former YouTuber Luke Nichols, who was behind the highly successful Outdoor Boys channel, recently revealed his reason behind stepping back from YouTube and content creation. For many years, Nichols built a loyal following by documenting his outdoor adventures, survival skills, and familial moments that felt authentic and relatable. His channel’s rapid growth turned him into one of YouTube’s most recognizable outdoor creators.In an interview on Steven’s MyLifeOutdoors channel, Nichols spoke candidly about how he did not see himself growing old as a YouTuber and had been thinking of retirement for some years. He emphasized that other concerns, including long-term sustainability, personal safety, and family priorities, shaped his outlook.During his appearance on MyLifeOutdoors, Nichols explained his long-term plans and how being a YouTuber was not feasible anymore. While also reflecting on the nature of online fame, he said, ""I always knew that I wasn't going to do this forever. And I've been thinking of retiring for a couple of years, actually. You know? I've been talking.""Nichols further went back in time to when he achieved peak fame and how people were recognizing him everywhere.Instead of embracing all the attention, he grew concerned about himself and his family. The former YouTuber added, ""A big part of it was the exposure. The channel blew up really big, and it kind of went from, 'Oh, people recognize me every once in a while…we started to have really serious conversations about security issues and the safety of the family.For Nichols, the idea of becoming a full-time celebrity did not attract him in the first place. He expressed his desire to live a normal life with his family and have the freedom to go wherever he wanted without any disruptions of any kind. He stated, “I'm looking at, you know, 'Okay, I'm going to be, you know, a really full-blown celebrity lifestyle.' I'm like, 'I don't want that. I don't want it for the kids. I don't want to live that way. ”Alongside fame, Nichols further pointed to another issue many creators face, which is the need to work at a relentless pace. He asserted that working 80 to 100 hours a week had taken a toll on his health and balance. For him, stepping away was not about choosing a life that kept him grounded and focused on his family.Also read: OutDoor Boys star Luke Nichols comes back from YouTube retirement to help MyLifeOutdoors creator Steven in family crisis","Former YouTuber Luke Nichols, who was behind the highly successful Outdoor Boys channel, recently revealed his reason behind stepping back from YouTube and content creation.

The Milwaukee Bucks are reportedly aiming to keep Giannis Antetokounmpo by pursuing short-term roster upgrades

Several NBA teams are monitoring Giannis Antetokounmpo’s situation as trade speculation continues to grow

Giannis Antetokounmpo, a forward with the Milwaukee Bucks, has recently been the subject of trade rumours and conjecture. This allegedly occurred after ESPN's Shams Charania revealed on December 3 that the team and his camp were debating his future and whether the ""best fit"" would be in town or somewhere else.However, Milwaukee is currently experiencing conflict. Giannis Antetokounmpo is said to occasionally urge the Bucks in the direction of a trade, but the Bucks consistently act as though they didn't hear him. Jake Fischer of the Stein Line newsletter has now released a new analysis on the Bucks star that addresses a number of issues.There is a lot of uncertainty about Giannis Antetokounmpo's future with the Milwaukee Bucks.According to Jake Fischer, the Milwaukee Bucks are making every effort to persuade Giannis to stay and have previously shown interest in players like Andrew Wiggins, Marcus Smart, Dejounte Murray, Zach LaVine, and Jerami Grant.On one end, Fischer talked about rival NBA executives' conjecture about the Bucks' potential assessment of Antetokounmpo's trade value:""I also hear rival teams wondering aloud if the Bucks have been so resistant until now to the mere idea of making Antetokounmpo available because they fear that his trade market wouldn't be as robust as anticipated.""According to Chris Haynes, Fischer said that Antetokounmpo is apparently uncomfortable with all of this. The Bucks won't move Antetokounmpo until he compels them to, and given his stated dislike of doing so, they appear to have a tiny window of opportunity to persuade him otherwise. According to reports from Eric Nehm and Marc Stein, they are trying to do this by looking into win-now deals.However, Fischer reported remarks made by a ""rival general manager"" who seemed to think the Bucks wanted to go ""big-game hunting"" in order to support Antetokounmpo and the struggling 11-16 team.""After repeatedly telling teams that Antetokounmpo is not available and that it is not interested in fielding trade offers for him, now Milwaukee is messaging that it wants to be buyers at this deadline to try to get Giannis more help. Even with no clear return-from-injury timetable yet in place for Antetokounmpo, Jon Horst's front office continues to hold onto hope that assembling a puncher's chance contender remains viable in the wide-open Eastern Conference…”The market for Antetokounmpo's services might not be as strong as anticipated if he does demand a move. A list of organisations interested in trading Giannis Antetokounmpo to the Milwaukee Bucks was made public by Chris Haynes. Rumours of a possible trade have been intensifying since the conclusion of the previous season.Before the NBA Cup semifinals, Chris Haynes spoke with Rachel Nichols in Las Vegas. Haynes was requested by Nichols to compile a list of the organisations interested in hiring the Greek superstar.""I heard that the New York Knicks are interested, I think the Miami Heat have interest in Giannis, the Golden State Warriors are interested for a long time, the San Antonio Spurs, the Minnesota Timberwolves, the list goes on.""Antetokounmpo reportedly wants to play in New York, according to several publications. The problem with an Antetokounmpo-to-Miami trade, from the Miami Heat's perspective, is that in order to make it work, the Heat would have to give up a lot of draft selections, Tyler Herro, and possibly Kel'el Ware. However, having said that, nothing is certain as of now for Antetokounmpo.Also read: Giannis Antetokounmpo to Miami Heat?

NEW DELHI: ""Apne ghar walon ke saamne khelne ka maza kuch aur hi hoga [Playing in front of my family members will be a completely different feeling]"" — India spinner Ravi Bishnoi is relishing the prospect of playing in front of his home crowd next IPL season. Bishnoi, who was part of the Lucknow Super Giants squad last season and was released ahead of the IPL 2026 Auction, was bought for Rs 7.2 crore at the IPL mini-auction in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday.Bishnoi appeared to be firmly on Rajasthan Royals ’ radar from the outset. As soon as auctioneer Mallika Sagar announced his name with a base price of Rs 2 crore, the Royals opened the bidding straightaway. Chennai Super Kings soon entered the fray, intensifying the contest. After CSK took the bid up to Rs 4.2 crore, Rajasthan Royals stayed aggressive in their pursuit of the leg-spinner. The bidding eventually concluded at Rs 7.2 crore, with Rajasthan Royals emerging successful in securing Bishnoi’s services.Bishnoi is all smiles and says it feels like a 'ghar wapsi' for him.""Excited to be back home. Ghar wapsi hai meri. I started as a net bowler from here and life has come a long way. I always dreamt of playing for my home franchise, and now that dream has come true.

I have learnt a lot from KL Rahul. He has an abundance of knowledge,"" he said.""KL Rahul bhai and Rishabh Pant bhai always said, ‘Jo karna hai kar, apni field laga. I trust you.’ The best thing was that they both were keepers, and a lot of guidance and tips came from behind the wickets whenever I was bowling. Pant bhai also emphasised fielding,"" the spinner added.Bishnoi was retained by Lucknow Super Giants ahead of the IPL 2025 mega auction for Rs 11 crore, but after managing just nine wickets in 11 matches at an economy rate of 10.83, he was released by LSG following a four-year stint with the franchise.""The price tag is nothing in front of playing in front of your home crowd. I am thankful to Rajasthan Royals and really excited to play this season for them,"" Bishnoi said.Now, Bishnoi will be sharing the ball with another Ravi — experienced spinner Ravindra Jadeja .""I am really excited for that deadly combo. I am eager to share the ball with him from the other end. He has got a lot of experience. He has played for this team in the past. His experience will matter a lot in IPL 2026,"" he said.""Googly is my main weapon. But with age, I have worked on my variations. Finger movement has helped me a lot. There is a lot of competition, so you need to keep improving. I spend a lot of time in the nets and keep bowling the same delivery until I get the desired results. If you want to play for long, whether for a franchise or India, you need to practise again and again. You need to grind really hard to stay in contention. You need to keep improving day by day and bring something new in terms of bowling and deliveries. You need to develop your game sense. The harder you grind, the better you become,"" Bishnoi said.""All I want is to hear cheers from my home fans. I am really eager to go out in the middle and play in front of my home crowd,"" the spinner signed off.","Ravi Bishnoi was bought by Rajasthan Royals for Rs 7.2 crore at the IPL mini- auction in Abu Dhabi.

How “The Last Dance” changed everything as Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen’s once-cordial relationship turns bitter after documentary fallout

Michael Jordan chooses disappointment over anger as his relationship with Scottie Pippen remains unhealed

The long-running issues between former basketball legends Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen have come back into the spotlight, bringing up memories from their time together with the Chicago Bulls. Once considered a great duo, many people thought Jordan was just angry about what happened, but that may not be true.The former Chicago Bulls coach Phil Jackson said Bulls forward Michael Jordan felt more hurt than angry by Pippen’s comments, according to Sam Smith, a former Chicago Bulls player. Instead of reacting in public, Michael Jordan stayed quiet and accepted that their close relationship had slowly come to an end.During their time with the Chicago Bulls, Michael Jordan, along with Scottie Pippen, won 6 championships together. “I didn't win without Scottie Pippen. And that's why I consider him my best teammate of all-time”, Michael Jordan once went candid about his bond with Scottie Pippen. And while Michael Jordan didn't share a very close personal off-court relationship with his Bulls teammate, Scottie Pippen. But they maintained a cordial relationship with each other, years after their retirement.But their relationship deteriorated following the release of the documentary, “The Last Dance” in 2020, which focused on Michael Jordan, placing him as the main figure of the Bulls’ legacy.Scottie Pippen allegedly felt deeply hurt by how his legacy was showcased in the film, as he felt the filmmakers didn't do justice with the way his legacy was portrayed in the film. He also felt positioning Jordan as the central figure not only minimized the roles played by the other teammates but also that the documentary didn't fully show their shared success. Over time, that feeling turned into bitterness, leading Pippen to openly criticize Jordan and question his reputation as one of the NBA's greatest players.Over time, Scottie Pippen's relationship with Michael Jordan has worsened to the extent that it still hasn't healed yet. But Jordan’s response has been quite unexpected as he seemed to have been more disappointed by how Pippen has reacted to this entire matter rather than feeling mad.And it is quite remarkable on Michael Jordan's part as he has handled the entire situation with Scottie Pippen, that instead of seeing it as an open public fight, he took it as a personal loss, a loss of years of on-court partnership and a deeply personal friendship that he once shared with Pippen. And while the duo is held by shared games and moments of championships, their personal relationship remains distant even to this day, which reminds that shared success on the court doesn't always mean harmony off it.Also Read: NBA legend Michael Jordan’s 23XI Racing wins major antitrust battle in dramatic NASCAR trial","Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen's relationship deteriorated after the release of the documentary, ""The Last Dance"" The documentary focused on Michael Jordan, placing him as the main figure of the Bulls’ legacy.

Braun Strowman’s WWE earnings and career-driven wealth

Victoria González (Raquel Rodriguez) and a rising financial trajectory

In 2025, Braun Strowman and Victoria González (aka Raquel Rodriguez) are at very different levels on the money ladder inside WWE. Together, they make for a great case study for how the WWE career of today can lead to multi-generational wealth. One is a heavyweight constructed to be a headline-grabbing mixed martial artist with previous experience as a world-title challenger, the other a recognized talent of the women’s division, with still-increasing value with the exposure of television.It is never a science to estimate a wrestler's net worth. WWE contracts are private, and income streams vary year-to-year. However, based on well-circulated numbers and career context, Strowman certainly represents the bigger portion of that percentage. While, on the other hand, Gonzalez's financial profile continues to reflect upward momentum instead of a maximum paycheck.Due to this fact, his estimated net worth in 2025 is between $2 million and $5 million. Most of that wealth is built on his years as a major headliner, where guaranteed deals, bonus money from premium live events, and royalty checks for merchandise comprise the foundation of earnings.Strowman was said to have signed a seven-figure a year deal before his release, which illustrates how quickly WWE's upper crust can line their pockets without ever setting foot in Hollywood or becoming major crossover draws.His status as a physical marvel meant he could stay commercially relevant across multiple creative cycles, and that is the biggest one of financial sustainability for WWE stars.It may not come with a lot of glitz in the public arena, Strowman's lifestyle veers toward upper-crust travel, fitness investments, and niche performance automotive (rather than celebrity branding bluster) outside the ring, but the money is there to be spent. His earnings are also buoyed by sporadic WWE-related media projects and appearances, as he is a company asset and not a star in it for the short term.Victoria Gonzalez, on the higher end of the scale for new main-roster talents, has an estimated net worth cited in 2025 to sit around $700,000. Her income consists of a base annual salary, plus earnings from live events, plus earnings from merchandise sales, plus championship bonuses from NXT and the women’s tag subdivision.Gonzalez makes money in one way that Strowman did not, because it is a story of momentum. Her notch up the card from NXT Women’s Champion and various Women’s Tag Team Champion opportunities has been slowly improving her stock to where the next time her deal is up for renewal, she could command a bit more in a monthly paycheck. She is also sidelined by health-related absences while on that ascent, but that is not the end of her long-term organisational worth.Also Read: Braun Strowman shares cryptic post on X hinting at career-ending after shocking WWE release","Braun Strowman and Victoria González make for a great case study for how the WWE career of today can lead to multi-generational wealth.
