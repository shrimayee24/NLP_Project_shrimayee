BHUBANESWAR: Not smoke. Not mirrors. Just steel that wasn’t there. Three decades after magician PC Sorcar Jr stunned a live crowd by making a passenger train “vanish” at Bardhaman in Bengal, rail travellers in western Odisha faced a far less theatrical disappearance — a reserved coach that never showed up.Passengers holding confirmed tickets for a 3AC coach on Sambalpur–Nanded Nagavali Superfast Exp discovered Sunday morning that their coach was missing when train 20809 rolled into Sambalpur, 320km west of Bhubaneswar.Sorcar’s act relied on lighting, timing and crowd control. This one needed none of that — just confirmed tickets, an absent coach and a reminder that on Indian Railways , reality can outdo illusion.The train departed Sambalpur without coach BE2. Confusion followed on the platform. Ticket examiners fielded protests as travellers were unsure whether to board. Others climbed into any coach they could find. Over 30 passengers with confirmed berths scattered across the train.East Coast Railway blamed a technical snag that prevented attachment of the coach. The issue was resolved when train reached Visakhapatnam Jn, where an AC coach was added.","Passengers holding confirmed tickets for a 3AC coach on Sambalpur–Nanded Nagavali Superfast Exp discovered Sunday morning that their coach was missing.

Cam Skattebo offseason break draws spotlight in Cabo



Cam Skattebo’s offseason break has become a talking point far beyond the New York Giants locker room, as his recovery period now overlaps with a sun-soaked escape that has drawn plenty of attention. The focus keyword surfaces immediately because this moment captures what is happening now: a young NFL running back rehabbing an injury while his personal life lights up social media in unexpected ways.While Skattebo continues to work back from a broken ankle suffered in October, his girlfriend Chloe Rodriguez has emerged as an offseason standout. Her recent Cabo San Lucas appearance has sparked buzz, offering fans a glimpse of how the couple is spending a rare pause away from football.It is a snapshot of rest, resilience, and visibility during a crucial stretch of Skattebo’s career.Skattebo’s rookie season with the Giants ended abruptly when his ankle was rolled up on and bent awkwardly against Philadelphia. Before that setback, the former Arizona State standout had carved out a promising role, piling up 410 rushing yards with five touchdowns and adding 207 receiving yards and two more scores.The numbers hinted at growth. His post-injury message later struck an optimistic tone, one that likely caught the attention of new Giants coach John Harbaugh.The timing of this offseason break matters. Skattebo is not just resting; he is recovering, recalibrating, and staying visible. Cabo San Lucas became the backdrop where that balance played out publicly. Rodriguez shared a series of beachside photos, highlighted by a striking blue and white bikini moment captioned, “cabo wabo 🏝️🍹“. The post traveled fast, reinforcing how modern NFL narratives now blend performance, personality, and presence.Rodriguez has been a steady figure alongside Skattebo all winter. The couple was spotted together during the holidays in New York, where her Rockefeller Center look also turned heads. Cabo simply amplified that momentum. The images suggested ease and confidence, with Skattebo appearing relaxed as he continues to heal.The trip also doubled as a reunion of sorts. Giants quarterback Jaxson Dart joined Skattebo in Mexico, extending a rookie-season bond that had already become fan lore. The two recreated a familiar pose from earlier in the year, a callback to sideline moments that once symbolized their on-field chemistry. Dart, now dating model Marissa Ayers, was also seen enjoying the vacation, even landing an impressive catch of his own.For Skattebo, this offseason chapter blends recovery with renewal. The ankle will dictate his return. The spotlight, however, shows no sign of fading.","New York Giants running back Cam Skattebo is recovering from a broken ankle.

Where and how the alternative halftime show will be streamed

As Super Bowl LX draws closer, Turning Point USA has taken a key step toward turning its long-discussed halftime concept into something viewers can actually access. The conservative nonprofit first teased its alternative event months ago, pitching it as a response to the NFL’s choice of Bad Bunny for the official halftime show. That announcement sparked attention across political and sports media, but the details were scarce.Turning Point USA has now revealed that its event, branded as “The All-American Halftime Show,” will be streamed live across several major digital platforms. Fans will be able to watch through their official YouTube channel, as well as on Charlie Kirk’s personal YouTube account. The organization also confirmed that the stream will be available on its Twitter and Rumble pages.Beyond social platforms, Turning Point USA (TPUSA) announced a lineup of television and streaming partners expected to carry the broadcast. That list includes The Daily Wire, Real America’s Voice, Trinity Broadcasting Network, Charge!, The National News Desk, New Tang Dynasty, and One America News. The organization shared this information through its website and social media accounts, presenting the wide distribution as a sign of strong interest in alternative Super Bowl programming.Still, much about the show remains unknown. Turning Point USA has not named any musical performers or speakers that will be present for the show. A spokesperson previously said that participants would not be revealed until the broadcast begins, as the organization’s website still reads, “More info & musical artists to be announced.”Questions also remain about its format, as Turning Point USA has not confirmed whether the show will be live or pre-recorded, nor has it released promotional clips or rehearsal footage. Compared to the NFL’s tightly choreographed halftime spectacle, the alternative broadcast and its strategy for the said event still remain a mystery.The NFL has declined to comment and continues to focus on its official Super Bowl LX plans. For now, viewers know where to tune in if they want to watch the alternate event. But with no information on what to expect, it's anyone’s guess as to what fans will see on their screens.","Turning Point USA has announced that its alternative Super Bowl LX event will be streamed live.

Cleveland Browns share heartfelt post featuring Shedeur Sanders and Todd Monken

Life changing moments have nothing to do with football

Can’t wait to see the video when Todd Monken meets Myles Garrett

There are two sides to the NFL quarterback position. Cleveland Browns longtime signal-caller Deshaun Watson, who arrived in a blockbuster trade sending Baker Mayfield to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, reportedly revealed he was baptized in Israel.Sports media personality Dov Kleiman shared on X that Watson said the experience was life changing. “I am truly in awe of this wonderful land and the wonderful people who live here.” Kleiman also wrote, “Deshaun is a devout Christian [red heart and folded hands emojis].”Now, the other side of an NFL field general. The Browns’ official X account shared a heartwarming post of QB Shedeur Sanders meeting their new head coach, Todd Monken, who was previously the Baltimore Ravens offensive coordinator and worked with Lamar Jackson and others.Cleveland captions it: “it all worked out.”Monken and Sanders shake hands, then the coach pulls the signal-caller’s shoulder and says, “Hey, we tried to draft your [---] last year for God’s sake! It all worked out. You remember that right?” Sanders chuckles and responds, “That’s what I was about to tell you…” Monken shares, “Someday we’ll get a chance to talk about that.”In Sept. 2025, ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported that the Ravens planned to pick Shedeur Sanders in the fifth round with the No.141 pick. League sources told the NFL Insider that Sanders did not want to play alongside Lamar Jackson because he would not have a chance to play soon.Is that why he chose Cleveland? A veteran like Deshaun Watson was recovering, rookie Dillon Gabriel was on the roster, veteran Joe Flacco was playing, and Super Bowl LIX winner Kenny Pickett was traded from the Philadelphia Eagles to the Browns. Maybe. Just speculation.Anyway, how did cybercitizens react to Watson’s baptism picture and Sanders’ union with a former Baltimore coordinator? Let’s find out.“Nothing wrong with making this move in your life. It’s never too late,” wrote one X user for Watson. Another wrote a wholesome comment for the playmaker, “Whatever people think about him on the field, moments like this are personal.Faith journeys are not about headlines or teams, they are about meaning and perspective. If this experience gave Deshaun Watson peace or clarity, that matters to him. Sometimes life changing moments have nothing to do with football at all.”A third user wrote, ""A true role model. I wouldn't want my kids looking up to anybody else."" A fourth user said, ""His past may not be forgotten but it can be forgiven."" A fifth user chimed in, ""He's about to get his starting job back.""Watson did not play a single game in his 2025 campaign. And Kleiman reportedly shared a photo of Watson’s baptism from June 2019.ABC13 Houston reported at the time that Watson was in Israel for a week on a trip sponsored by the nonprofit group America’s Voices. While on the trip, he was baptized in the Jordan River.Watson said in a statement then: “This is a part of the world which gets a lot of attention internationally, and this is a chance for me to look beyond the headlines and learn more about the history and culture of this land.I have been blessed to visit many countries around the world, but the chance to visit the Holy Land, see the sites and meet the people of this special place, truly is a special blessing and an amazing opportunity.”Coming to Deion Sanders’ son: “I’ve never seen a backup QB get this kind of treatment,” wrote one X user after seeing a special video of backup QB Shedeur Sanders meeting the franchise’s new head coach.Another user was waiting for a video featuring Cleveland’s star defensive end Myles Garrett: “Can’t wait to see the video when he meets Myles.”A third user spoke for the 23-year-old Colorado Buffaloes former standout QB: “Its clear coach cant wait to work with Shedeur. Say what you want, but Sanders was part of why Monken wanted to come here. That aside this interaction is hilarious [laughing face emojis].”",Cleveland Browns share heartfelt post featuring Shedeur Sanders and Todd Monken.

He cheated me financially,” she had said.Onler denied the allegations and countered with claims of extramarital affairs, alleging long-standing relationships and saying he had proof.“Firstly, in 2013, she was having an affair with a junior boxer. Our families had a fight, and after that, we compromised. And since 2017, she’s been having a relationship with someone working at the Mary Kom Boxing Academy. I have their WhatsApp messages as proof. I have proof, with the name of the person with whom she was having an affair. I remained silent.

There is always backdoor diplomacy. In 24 hours, anything is possible. Rashid Latif | Former Pakistan captain

Poll Should Pakistan proceed with their boycott of the T20 World Cup match against India? Yes, it's a strategic move. No, they should play as planned.

Pakistan will not play their group-stage match against India at the T20 World Cup on February 15, the Pakistan government announced in a social media post on Sunday. However, clearance has been granted for the tournament, which begins on February 7. Pakistan will play all their matches in Sri Lanka, and not India, as per terms agreed between the two neighbours in 2024.Former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif, in an exclusive interview with TimesofIndia.com, has offered a blunt assessment, saying Pakistan’s boycott of the India clash is a calculated move aimed squarely at the ICC’s financial and governance structure.Latif links the escalation to Bangladesh’s removal from the tournament, the shifting political climate in South Asia, and the enormous financial stakes attached to India-Pakistan cricket.“Till now, everything was going well. Pakistan and India both agreed that we would play in a hybrid model for the next three years. The Asia Cup happened in Dubai. Pakistan’s women’s team played in Sri Lanka in the Women’s ODI World Cup. Everything was going well, but things have changed since the Bangladesh episode happened,” says Latif from Islamabad.After Bangladesh unsuccessfully sought to shift its matches from India to Sri Lanka over security concerns, Pakistan began protesting the decision.In a show of support for the Bangladesh Cricket Board, Pakistan voted in favour of the request at the ICC board meeting, with chairman Mohsin Naqvi even threatening a boycott. When Bangladesh ultimately declined to play in India, they were replaced by Scotland.“Pakistan is standing with Bangladesh. It was not like this in the past,” Latif says.Despite Pakistan’s recent struggles on the field, Latif argues that their importance to global cricket remains undiminished. India-Pakistan matches, he says, are the engine that drives World Cup viewership.“Whether it is in India or Pakistan, 60–70 percent of people watch the World Cup because of India-Pakistan matches,” he says.Latif points out that even matches involving Australia draw packed stadiums, but when India and Pakistan are both involved, the scale is unmatched. Viewership runs into the millions, sponsorship valuations spike, and broadcasters plan entire commercial strategies around these fixtures.In case Pakistan do not take the field against India on February 15, they will lose two points, and there could be sanctions from the ICC as well.Latif claims that Pakistan’s move is not aimed at India directly, but at the ICC itself.“This decision is not on India. It is hitting the ICC directly,” he says.“Pakistan generally don’t take such decisions. The PCB is not even scared of sanctions. It will have a big impact. There is a Women’s T20 World Cup in England this year, and Pakistan might play India there as well. Then there is a Champions Trophy in 2028, hosted by India. So this will not end here. It seems that Pakistan has taken this step after a lot of thought,” he says.Latif dismissed the idea that Pakistan is worried about sanctions. He says that if Bangladesh had acted alone, punitive measures might have followed. With Pakistan involved, the equation changes dramatically.“Now that Pakistan has joined, it will impact Australia and England financially as well,” he explains.The ripple effect would not stop at one tournament. The ACC calendar, future Asia Cups, and even ICC events would feel the strain. Latif estimates the India-Pakistan cricket economy as a billion-dollar business across formats and tournaments.“The businessmen are above our governments,” he says bluntly. “Now the game has gone out of their hands.”Latif places significant faith in the power of broadcasters. He believes they will not allow a prolonged standoff that threatens their investments.“You know how powerful broadcasters are. They will find some solution,” he says.Drawing parallels with how previous Asia Cup deadlocks were resolved, Latif suggests similar behind-the-scenes negotiations are inevitable for the World Cup. Without compromise, he warns, the consequences could be disastrous for world cricket.“If not, then it is a disaster for world cricket,” he adds.Teams opting not to play matches is not unprecedented in ICC tournaments. At the 1996 World Cup, Australia and the West Indies declined to travel to Sri Lanka over security concerns. In the 2003 edition, England refused to face Zimbabwe for political reasons, while New Zealand did not travel to Nairobi for their group match against Kenya.However, Latif does not rule out a reversal of stance. “There is always backdoor diplomacy,” he says.With Pakistan taking nearly a week to arrive at this position, Latif believes the timing has been carefully calculated. The Australia series has just ended, both teams are set to travel to Colombo, and the spotlight is firmly on the ICC.“In 24 hours, anything is possible,” he concludes.","Former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif says India-Pakistan matches account for majority of World Cup viewership.

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), in solidarity with Bangladesh's ouster from the upcoming T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka, has decided not to play their group league game against India in Colombo on February 15. The decision has been taken despite the PCB holding a binding contract with the ICC and the BCCI on playing matches on neutral soil.The Pakistani government did however clear its national team to compete in the tournament which gets underway on February 7. Pakistan are due to play Netherlands in the tournament opener at the Sinhalese Sports Club Cricket Ground in Colombo.""The government of Pakistan grants approval to the Pakistan cricket team to participate in the Twenty20 World Cup, however, the Pakistan team shall not take the field in the match scheduled on 15th February against India,"" a Pakistan government release said.Here is a timeline of events that led to Pakistan's decision:The BCCI instructed Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) to release Mustafizur Rahman, who the franchise had aquired in the IPL mini-auction. The decision came due to deteriorating relations between India and Bangladesh.Bangladesh ordered that broadcast of IPL season be stopped in the country. Further, BCB declared that if a single player was considered a ""security liability"" then the entire team's safety could be at risk.BCB formally wrote to the ICC and asked for relocation of their T20 World Cup matches from India to Sri Lanka. The BCB suggested a ""hybrid model"", similar to the 2023 Asia Cup.ICC Board votes against moving Bangladesh matches. The 14-2 decision saw only Pakistan coming out in support of Bangladesh. ICC maintained that an independent security assessment found ""no credible threat"" to players in India. They also gave Bangladesh a 24-hour deadline to confirm their travel.At a meeting that took place at a hotel in Dhaka between the national squad, BCB officials, and Youth and Sports Adviser Asif Nazrul, Bangladesh stuck to their decision and decided against travelling to India for the T20 World Cup.With Bangladesh deciding against playing the T20 World Cup matches in India, ICC formally replaced them with Scotland in Group C.After Bangladesh were removed from the T20 World Cup, PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi said a final decision on their participation would be taken after talking to Pakistan's government.""Our stance [on World Cup participation] will be what the government of Pakistan instructs me,"" he said. ""The Prime Minister is not in Pakistan right now. When he returns, I'll be able to give you our final decision. It's the government's decision. We obey them, not the ICC.""Naqvi met with Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to discuss the situation. ""Had a productive meeting with the Prime Minister ... Shehbaz Sharif,"" Naqvi tweeted. ""Briefed him on the ICC matter, and he directed that we resolve it while keeping all options on the table. It was agreed that the final decision [on participation] will be taken either on Friday or next Monday.""Mohsin Naqvi and Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif meet for the second time in a week in Lahore. The government cleared the national team to compete in the T20 World Cup but stopped them from playing arch-rivals and tournament co-hosts India on February 15.",Pakistan will not play India in the group stage of the T20 World Cup.

Carlos Alcaraz conquers Melbourne to complete historic career Grand Slam,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/carlos-alcaraz-conquers-melbourne-to-complete-historic-career-grand-slam/articleshow/127845730.cms,"Carlos Alcaraz (Photo by Darrian Traynor/Getty Images)

Melbourne:

When Carlos Alcaraz fell back onto the Rod Laver Arena after just over three hours in the middle, he lay motionless for a while, stunned by the moment, caught between disbelief and the sudden weight of what he had achieved.The world No. 1 had just halted Novak Djokovic , the 24-time major champion, 2-6, 6-2, 6-3, 7-5 to lift the Norman Brookes Challenge Cup for the first time, continuing his relentless rewriting of the record books. At 22 years and 272 days, the Australian Open crown made Alcaraz the youngest man in history to complete a career Grand Slam.The path to the title, however, had been anything but smooth. Alcaraz arrived in Melbourne after a turbulent period, facing criticism at home and across the tennis world following his split from long-time coach Juan Carlos Ferrero in December, a backdrop that made the scale and composure of his triumph all the more striking.“Nobody knows better than my team how hard I've been working to get this trophy,” Alcaraz said of his seventh major title. “Pre-season was a bit of a rollercoaster emotionally. We did the right work, you pushed me every day to do the right things and I'm really grateful for everyone in my corner. This trophy is also yours.”Some 12 minutes into the match, Alcaraz unveiled his first drop shot, a clear signal of intent. He wanted to move Djokovic, to probe the older man’s legs early.Two minutes later in the fourth game, he saved the first break point he faced with another feathered drop shot. Djokovic, dragged around the court like a pawn in a carefully constructed board game, responded in the only way he knew how, with precision and patience, breaking on his third opportunity to move ahead 3-1.If Alcaraz arrived with a plan for the sport’s great symbol of longevity, Djokovic leaned on placement and control, closing out the opening set in just 33 minutes.Rod Laver Arena was captivated, and for the first time in his young career, Alcaraz, with Spanish legend Rafael Nadal cheering him on, sensed that the crowd’s volume tilted decisively toward his opponent. As he tried to accelerate the tempo in the second set, a tactic that played into Djokovic’s hands, the Spaniard muttered toward his box in search of answers. He eventually eased off the throttle, returning to variation and movement, and broke in the third game.As the sun dipped over Melbourne Park, Djokovic retreated further behind the baseline and on the scoreboard.The roof over Rod Laver Arena was only partially open on the coldest day of the fortnight, with temperatures peaking at just 20 degrees. Strong winds swept through Melbourne’s sporting precinct, blowing between 11.2 and 20.1 mph, with gusts reaching up to 29 mph, adding an unpredictable edge to the contest.The ten-time Australian Open champion left the court at the end of the second set, and as the roof began inching closer, Alcaraz got on his feet, protesting to the chair umpire. He did well not to let it distract him, carrying the momentum into the third, threatening in Djokovic’s opening service games before breaking in the fifth when the Serb’s crosscourt forehand drifted wide, igniting the Spanish contingent. Moments later, when the top seed emerged on top of a geometrical exchange of acute angles and the stands erupted, it was clear the world No. 1 had seized control.Djokovic called for the doctor at the end of the third set, gesturing toward what appeared to be acid reflux. Yet, just as the contest seemed to be slipping away, he produced one last stand, saving six break points from 15-40 in the second game with sheer resolve. Buoyed by the crowd inside Rod Laver Arena and thousands more braving the biting cold outside, the 38-year-old traded shot for shot with a younger, fresher opponent. The resistance held until the 12th game, when Alcaraz finally wrapped it up.A pivotal subplot in Sunday’s final was the serve. Alcaraz claimed 77 percent of the points on his first serve, while Djokovic, who saved 11 of 16 break points he faced in the match, only managed 66 percent.Alcaraz’s conscious effort to make that shot more efficient saw him borrow elements from Djokovic’s action and work on it in the off-season. Rather than chasing raw pace, the 22-year-old has actioned a cleaner, more repeatable motion, with the focus on disguise and placement over outright power. The influence is clear in how he now protects his service games under pressure, using variation and accuracy to set up his first forehand. For a player who stands at 6 feet, the shortest among the modern-day greats — Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer are both an inch taller than Alcaraz, while Djokovic is 6 ft 2 and Jannik Sinner at 6 ft 3 is significantly taller — this evolution is crucial.In a final against the very model he’s studied, it became a fascinating measure of how effectively the student had absorbed the master’s lessons.","Carlos Alcaraz beats Novak Djokovic to win the Norman Brookes Challenge Cup.

Ramadan 2026: February 18 or 19? The Lunar Calendar Debate Begins





With just weeks to go before the holy month of Ramadan 2026 in Saudi Arabia , Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and much of the Islamic world, Muslims are closely watching the skies and the lunar calendar to answer the question many are asking: Will Ramadan begin on Wednesday, February 18 or Thursday, February 19 this year? All eyes are on trusted astronomical calculations and crescent-sighting criteria to know which of the two dates this month is the most likely first day of Ramadan in the UAE and several other countries, depending on local moon sightings and weather conditions.Unlike the Gregorian calendar, the start of Ramadan in the Islamic lunar calendar is determined by the sighting of the new crescent moon (hilal) at the end of the month of Sha’ban. Cultural and religious traditions still place emphasis on visual sighting for the official declaration, even as modern astronomical calculations provide increasingly precise predictions.Every year, communities across the Middle East , Asia and Africa look to the western sky just after sunset to spot the youngest visible crescent moon, an event that traditionally marks the beginning of Ramadan.It is the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar and is dedicated to fasting, prayer, charity and reflection.Astronomical calculations from regional experts, including the International Astronomy Centre (IAC) and the Emirates Astronomy Society, explain why this year could see a debate between Wednesday and Thursday:On Tuesday, February 17, 2026, the new moon is expected to be born late in the afternoon but conditions for seeing the crescent just after sunset are extremely unfavourable across most of the Arab and Islamic world.This is because the moon will set too close to, or even before, the sun in many regions, providing a very brief or non-existent window for visibility.Scientific algorithms show that in the UAE the moon is likely to set one minute before sunset on February 17, making a reliable sighting virtually impossible even with optical aids. Due to this challenge, astronomers say that Wednesday, February 18, 2026, will most likely be the 30th and final day of Sha’ban in the region and that Thursday, February 19 will be observed as the first day of fasting for Muslims in the UAE and several neighbouring countries.This calculation-based approach where moon age, angular separation and horizon visibility are taken into account, aligns with international crescent visibility criteria developed by astronomers and scholars over the decades.While astronomical analysis strongly points to Thursday, February 19, some countries and communities that apply different sighting standards could declare Wednesday, February 18, as the start of Ramadan if the crescent is sighted that evening. Regions such as parts of South Asia or North Africa may follow local sightings and weather conditions that differ slightly from Gulf forecasts. Whatever the result, the final decision will be made based on confirmed moon sightings.The moon sighting practice is rooted in centuries-old tradition. This dual-possibility pattern has occurred in past years, with crescent visibility and local interpretation influencing whether regions begin Ramadan together or a day apart.Once the new crescent is sighted, whether on February 17 or February 18, religious authorities and moon-sighting committees in the UAE will make an official announcement, after which mosques, schools and government bodies will publish the confirmed Ramadan schedule. This includes prayer times, fasting guidelines and any adjustments to work and school hours throughout the holy month.Ramadan’s beginning also signals the start of several related preparations. Families plan for fasting routines, mosques arrange special Taraweeh prayers and charitable initiatives ramp up to support those in need.Astronomers and Islamic calendar experts also use moon-sighting projections to estimate the Eid al-Fitr holiday, which marks the end of Ramadan. Eid 2026 is anticipated to fall around March 20, 2026 in the Middle East if the month completes 30 days.However, like the start of Ramadan, Eid’s exact date will be confirmed only after the Sha’wal crescent moon is sighted at the end of the fasting month.This year’s Ramadan timing is attracting particular attention for several reasons. It falls earlier in February than in some previous years, a reflection of the Islamic lunar calendar’s shift relative to the Gregorian calendar. The proximity of the crescent moon to the sun on February 17 has made scientists and moon-sighting communities cautious about predictions and claims, reinforcing the role of scientific calculation in supporting traditional sighting methods.Arab and Islamic countries including Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Jordan, Egypt and others, are poised to coordinate their crescent sighting efforts, often deferring to science-based criteria when visibility conditions are marginal. This unfolding lunar observation process shows how ancient religious practices and modern astronomical science intersect in today’s world.While some Muslims prefer traditional visual moon sightings as the ultimate authority, astronomers argue that when visibility is virtually impossible, scientific calculation should guide decisions, a view reflected in 2026’s predictions. Local scholars and astronomers have advocated this blended approach, observing that in cases where visibility is highly unlikely, “attempting to sight the crescent serves no practical or religious purpose. ” This perspective respects tradition while acknowledging the precision of contemporary astronomical models.For millions of Muslims in the UAE and around the world, Ramadan 2026 is most likely to begin on Thursday, February 19, based on a combination of moon-sighting tradition and scientific prediction. While Wednesday, February 18 remains a possibility in some regions if sighted earlier, astronomers and calculators widely agree that Thursday will be the first fasting day in the Middle East and much of the Arab world. The moment will mark the start of a spiritually rich and deeply observed month.","Ramadan 2026: February 18th or 19th? When will the crescent moon be sighted and the month of fasting begins?

Anime-themed games on Roblox are everywhere right now. Some fade fast. Others stick around because they keep players coming back. Anime Paradox seems to fall into the second category. At first glance, it looks like another tower defence title with familiar anime faces and flashy attacks. But spend a little time with it, and the grind becomes obvious. Progress slows quickly, upgrades demand patience, and free rewards feel essential rather than optional for anyone hoping to stay competitive. Anime Paradox February codes let you redeem gems, stat chips, trait rerolls, and more.For players trying to build a decent team without sinking hours into farming, they matter.Below is the list of all working Anime Paradox codes in February 2026.Anime Paradox is a Roblox tower defence game where players summon and command powerful anime-style units to fend off waves of enemies and bosses as they defend a base.

And like most Roblox games built this way, Gems sit at the centre of everything. It sounds simple, but the cost adds up quickly. Progress slows if you rely only on gameplay rewards.

'US Benefited Immensely From Indians', Says Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Warns US Against Scrapping H-1B

What Andrej Karpathy said in his post on X

I'm being accused of overhyping the [site everyone heard too much about today already]. People's reactions varied very widely, from ""how is this interesting at all"" all the way to ""it's so over"".

To add a few words beyond just memes in jest - obviously when you take a look at the activity, it's a lot of garbage - spams, scams, slop, the crypto people, highly concerning privacy/security prompt injection attacks wild west, and a lot of it is explicitly prompted and fake posts/comments designed to convert attention into ad revenue sharing.

And this is clearly not the first the LLMs were put in a loop to talk to each other.

So yes it's a dumpster fire and I also definitely do not recommend that people run this stuff on their computers (I ran mine in an isolated computing environment and even then I was scared), it's way too much of a wild west and you are putting your computer and private data at a high risk.

That said - we have never seen this many

LLM agents

(150,000 atm!) wired up via a global, persistent, agent-first scratchpad. Each of these agents is fairly individually quite capable now, they have their own unique context, data, knowledge, tools, instructions, and the network of all that at this scale is simply unprecedented.

This brings me again to a tweet from a few days ago

""The majority of the ruff ruff is people who look at the current point and people who look at the current slope."", which imo again gets to the heart of the variance. Yes clearly it's a dumpster fire right now. But it's also true that we are well into uncharted territory with bleeding edge automations that we barely even understand individually, let alone a network there of reaching in numbers possibly into ~millions. With increasing capability and increasing proliferation, the second order effects of agent networks that share scratchpads are very difficult to anticipate. I don't really know that we are getting a coordinated ""skynet"" (thought it clearly type checks as early stages of a lot of AI takeoff scifi, the toddler version), but certainly what we are getting is a complete mess of a computer security nightmare at scale. We may also see all kinds of weird activity, e.g. viruses of text that spread across agents, a lot more gain of function on jailbreaks, weird attractor states, highly correlated botnet-like activity, delusions/ psychosis both agent and human, etc. It's very hard to tell, the experiment is running live.

TLDR sure maybe I am ""overhyping"" what you see today, but I am not overhyping large networks of autonomous LLM agents in principle, that I'm pretty sure.","Andrej Karpathy: ""We have never seen this many LLM agents wired up via a global, persistent, agent-first scratchpad"" ""I don't really know that we are getting a coordinated ""skynet"" (thought it clearly type checks as early stages of a lot of AI takeoff scifi)""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127834303,imgsize-23196,width-400,resizemode-4/openai-cofounder-andrej-karpathy.jpg"

Former captain Rashid Latif on Pakistan boycotting India T20 World Cup match

PCB may have to pay the broadcasters

NEW DELHI: The upcoming ICC T20 World Cup is set to suffer a big jolt with the Pakistan govt on Sunday announcing that its cricket team will boycott its league match against India in Colombo on February 15. While Pakistan govt didn’t provide any reason for the move, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Mohsin Naqvi had warned of drastic steps after Bangladesh was replaced with Scotland on January 24.The International Cricket Council (ICC) reacted sharply to development, stating: “ICC hopes PCB will consider the significant and long-term implications for cricket in its own country as this is likely to impact the global cricket ecosystem, which it is itself a member and beneficiary of.”“The ICC notes the statement that the govt of Pakistan has made regarding the decision to instruct its national team to selectively participate in the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026. While the ICC awaits official communication from the Pakistan Cricket Board, this position of selective participation is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental premise of a global sporting event where all qualified teams are expected to compete on equal terms per the event schedule,” an ICC statement said.Sources told TOI that ICC could contemplate expelling Pakistan from the World Cup and future ICC tournaments if the PCB goes ahead with boycotting the scheduled match against India.The govt of Pakistan’s official handle posted the decision on X. “The Government of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan grants approval to the Pakistan cricket team to participate in the ICC World T20 2026, how- ever, the Pakistan Cricket Team shall not take the field in the match scheduled on 15th February 2026 against In- dia,” the post read.It needs to be seen what Pakistan’s stance will be if they are drawn with India for the tournament semifinal. If the match doesn’t happen, broadcasters and the sponsors will incur enormous losses as the fixture has generated a major chunk of revenue from ICC tournaments over the last decade, as diplomatic relationship between the two countries froze. For the match to be forfeited in favour of India, the Indian team must be at the ground at the time of toss. According to ICC’s playing conditions, Pakistan will lose two points from the match and their net run rate will also take a hit. India and Pakistan are in Group A with USA, Namibia and Netherlands. Two teams from the group will qualify for the Super 8 stage.Over the last decade, ICC tournaments have always been guaranteed of at least one India-Pakistan match in the group stages. Each match has broken viewership records.Despite PCB struggling to generate revenue, it gets the fourth highest share of ICC’s annual revenue based on the revenue generated through India-Pakistan matches. PCB currently gets $34.5 million annually from ICC. Sources said ICC could penalise PCB by asking them to financially compensate for the loss of revenue from this match. The world body also mulls denying giving out No Objection Certificates to players across the globe to participate in the Pakistan Super League If ICC decides to compensate broadcasters from PCB’s annual share of ICC revenue, then PCB could stand to lose around 70-80% of $34.5 million that they currently receive from ICC.

Bengaluru: CJ Roy Death, SI Bribe Arrest, 4 Assam Workers Found Dead and More





BENGALURU: This is the story of sweat, toil, and dedication of Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) engineers to outsmart the clock and see the Hebbal flyover downramp project through in record time because of false starts. Sleeping on factory floors and snatching just 2-3 hours of sleep, having meals at roadside dhabas, letting go of family time, festivals and New Year celebrations are some of the sacrifices made by engineers to recoup the time lost to bureaucratic wrangling.The long-awaited downramp is finally ready, much to the relief of commuters in north Bengaluru — after nearly 10 years of planning and repeated delays. BDA completed the 6-metre-wide and 1km-long ramp in Jan in under 18 months after overcoming multiple administrative, technical, and logistical challenges.The ramp proposal was stuck for years because of design changes, land-use constraints, and prolonged bureaucratic approvals. When work resumed in early 2024, engineers had to coordinate continuously with Metro and railway authorities, urban transport agencies, and vendors to keep the project moving.Night-time construction, customised design adjustments, and real-time problem-solving ensured steady progress despite complex conditions such as active traffic, railway operations, and overlapping Metro and transport projects.The project demanded no less than 100 on-site visits — at last count — by the BDA team.Assistant executive engineer Sharan MS, who along with a seven-member team worked tirelessly, said: ""I had been married for just one month when I was sent to Ludhiana last year to oversee the manufacture of bolts to ensure they met the required standards. I don't know about commuters, but my wife is extremely happy that the Hebbal ramp work is finally done.""Umesh BR, executive engineer, said his son is ""now very happy"" because he gets to spend time with dad. ""We hardly spent time with family. Our two years of hard work has paid off.""Explaining how the team completed work in just 1.5 years, Suresh R, executive engineer, said: ""We visited the site and multiple offices every week. That is why we could do what would have otherwise taken three years. Normally, a project like this takes three years after approval. We completed it in less than half the time because we stopped working in silos and took ownership.""Umesh added: ""For two years, we worked without breaks. There were no festivals, no New Year celebrations. We were either on site at night or running between offices during the day.""","The long-awaited downramp is finally ready, much to the relief of commuters in north Bengaluru.

Main factors in the Portland Trail Blazers vs New York Knicks game (January 30, 2026)

What to expect on Blazers vs Knicks Jan 30

Thein New York with both teams in very different situations. Portland is trying to stop a three-game slide while dealing with several injuries. New York is coming in on a four-game winning streak and has most of its main players available.This game is likely to be decided by depth and basic execution. Portland is missing key guards and needs replacement players to handle the ball and score. New York’s job is not as difficult. They need to defend well, take care of the ball, and use its size advantage.The game will be played at Madison Square Garden, where the Knicks have been strong this season. New York already beat Portland once earlier in the year, and the Blazers are even more short-handed for this meeting.Portland Trail Blazers are 23-25 and have lost three straight. Head coach Chauncey Billups has to rely on a thin rotation.• Damian Lillard - left Achilles management• Scoot Henderson - left knee tear, out for weeks• Matisse Thybulle - right knee tendinopathy• Kris Murray - undisclosed issue• Blake Wesley - sidelined• Duop Reath - right foot stress fracture• Deni Avdija - low back strain, around 25 points and 7 rebounds per game• Robert Williams III - knee managementIf Avdija cannot play, Portland will depend more on Shaedon Sharpe for scoring and on Jerami Grant for defense and secondary offense.Without Lillard and Henderson, Portland lacks steady ball handling. That has led to many turnovers this season.New York Knicks are 29-18 and has won four in a row.• Josh Hart - ankle soreness• Miles McBride - ankle management• Jalen Brunson - around 26 points and 6 assists per game• Karl-Anthony Towns - about 20 points and 11 rebounds• Mikal Bridges• OG Anunoby - around 16 points and 5.4 reboundsIf Hart or McBride sits, Brunson will handle the ball more often, with Bridges and Anunoby helping to create plays.These teams have met 126 times in the regular season. Portland leads the series 70-56. New York won the first meeting this season 123-114 on January 11, 2026. In that game, Brunson and Towns scored more than 40 points combined, and Portland struggled with turnovers.Portland now enters the rematch with fewer healthy guards than it had in that loss.Portland’s last few games include losses by scores of 111-115 and 94-102. The team averages about 16.1 turnovers per game, one of the highest marks in the league.New York has won games by wide margins during its streak, including 119-92 and 103-87. The Knicks have controlled rebounds and limited easy fast-break chances for opponents. Towns anchors the middle, and the wings cover ground on defense. This sets up a simple contrast: Portland must avoid mistakes, while New York looks to force them.Portland needs reliable offense without its top two guards. Sharpe has to score efficiently, Grant has to defend without fouling, and Avdija, if he plays, has to contribute on both ends.New York needs steady guard play if Hart or McBride cannot go. Brunson will see more pressure, so wing support is important. Turnovers will likely decide the pace. If Portland protects the ball, the game can stay close. If New York forces early mistakes, it can build a quick lead.This matchup favors New York. The Knicks are healthier, at home, and have already beaten this opponent once this season. Avdija’s status is the biggest variable. If he plays well, Portland can stay competitive. If he is out, New York should control rebounds, limit mistakes, and manage the game from start to finish.For Portland, the path is simple and that is fewer turnovers and balanced scoring. For New York, it is strong defense, good rebounding, and letting its main players carry the offense.","Portland Trail Blazers are 23-25 and have lost three straight. New York Knicks are 29-18 and has won four in a row. Portland is missing key guards and needs replacement players to handle the ball and score. Knicks need to defend well, take care of the ball, and use its size advantage.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127809712,imgsize-497052,width-400,resizemode-4/new-york-knicks-vs-portland-trail-blazers.jpg"

MUMBAI: A year after her amazing run, where she advanced as a 15-year-old wild card qualifier all the way to the semifinals, Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi is back at the L&T Mumbai Open.The setting may have changed, as the WTA 125K tournament has moved from the Cricket Club of India to a new home this year — the Maharashtra State Lawn Tennis Association (MSLTA) at Colaba. But for the promising teenager from Coimbatore, that’s an irrelevant detail. Mumbai, she says, “has always given me the best memories of my tennis career”.“I won the U-12 Nationals here four years ago,” she tells TOI ahead of her practice session on Sunday.“That was the first tournament I won that made me realize, maybe I could do something with tennis.”Those who watched her progress from the qualifiers to the last four a year ago would readily back those sentiments. For Maaya, it’s what came after that has been of greater value.Playing both, the juniors and on the ITF circuit, brought some success but also dealt her the humbling blow of early losses. “I started the year with winning a J300 tournament in Delhi, and the first three months were very good.And then, there were tournaments where I lost first round, which I didn’t expect,” says Maaya.“So it’s been like a huge learning for me because everyone’s told me that it’s a phase of my career where I’m in the transition from juniors to pro, and I’m still playing juniors, but I’m starting women’s tournaments as well. So that is something that everyone has told me is going to be a bit up and down.“But I think I’ve learned a lot in terms of how to manage myself when losses happen, how to get out of it, to take them as learnings instead of losses. And there have been so many people who have actually helped me get out of those losses, because honestly, I believe at a young age it’s not very easy to accept certain losses.”That’s where earning the chance to train at the Rafa Nadal Academy in Mallorca has played a big role for Maaya, who is currently ranked 51 on the ITF juniors circuit while holding a WTA ranking of 650.“After it started, I think more than the tennis aspect, it’s the professional aspect, in terms of having so many pros in the academy,” says Maaya, citing the examples of Spain’s Jaume Munar, the current ATP world No. 39, Alexandra Eala, the Filipino talent who reached a career-high WTA singles ranking of world No. 49 last month, and Russian teenager Alina Korneeva, a double junior Grand Slam champion.“I think they’re very experienced in handling players that way, in terms of helping them get better and get out of that phase with that transition.“When you’re around athletes who are that professional and you’re around coaches who work with them, you kind of learn a lot in terms of how to go about things, the amount of discipline that they have, how they handle everything off court.“And the most lovely part is all of them are very approachable,” she adds. Take the man who moulded Nadal into one of the game’s greatest ever players, ‘Uncle Toni’, who now serves as director at his nephew’s academy. “Just his presence on court creates a difference,” Maaya says. “To have him just watching even without coaching, it’s going to be like — ‘I’m going to play my best tennis out there today’. He’s someone who can just give you motivation without even saying anything. ”The education, of course, stretches beyond the technical and physical aspects of the game. Coping with increasing media attention in a nation starved of tennis icons is something the Academy is also helping Maaya learn to gradually embrace.“We always try to tell Maaya that she’s very lucky to be receiving this attention, and she has to take it with a positive mindset,” says Polina Radeva, a Bulgarian coach who works closely with Maaya at the academy and is with her for the Mumbai Open this week. “Ever since the moment we saw her, everybody loved Maya because she’s so energetic on the court. Our goal this year is to try to get her to play a lot of matches and to try to get her to compete as much as possible as we want to make sure that she finds this high level of consistency in her performances. ”",Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi is back at the L&T Mumbai Open. The 15-year-old advanced as a wild card qualifier all the way to the semifinals last year.

The oldest cave in New Zealand reveals precisely dated ancient wildlife

Ancient New Zealand wildlife reveals cycles of extinction and renewal



The first Early Pleistocene (ca 1 Ma) fossil terrestrial vertebrate fauna from a cave in New Zealand reveals substantial avifaunal turnover in the last million years

Volcanic eruptions and climate shifts drove ancient extinctions



Ancient Kākāpō ancestor hints at lost bird diversity







For a long time, New Zealand’s ancient past felt incomplete. Bits and pieces here and there. A few fossils. Large gaps. Now, a cave near Waitomo on the North Island has quietly changed that picture. Inside it, scientists have uncovered the remains of wildlife that lived around one million years ago. It feels like stumbling into a forgotten chapter or maybe a whole missing book. The fossils suggest Aotearoa once supported ecosystems very different from what we see today. Dense forests. Shifting climates. Violent eruptions. Long before humans ever arrived, nature was already reshaping life here in dramatic ways.The cave itself is part of the surprise. Researchers say it appears to be the oldest known cave yet found on New Zealand’s North Island. That alone raised eyebrows.What made it so valuable, though, was timing. The fossils were trapped between two layers of volcanic ash. One from an eruption roughly 1.55 million years ago. Another from a massive blast around 1 million years ago. That sandwich of ash gave scientists something rare.Precise dates. Most ash from eruptions gets washed away over time. And inside, the remains of at least 12 bird species and four frog species were waiting.The fossils offer a glimpse of New Zealand as it looked long before people. Experts say it seems the country’s wildlife was already going through cycles of loss and renewal. Species disappearing. According to the research, published in Alcheringa , titled, as many as a third to half of species may have gone extinct in the million years before humans arrived. That’s a striking number.Associate Professor Trevor Worthy from Flinders University says this was a completely different avifauna. Not just older versions of modern birds. A distinct community that didn’t make it through the next stretch of time. It suggests extinction wasn’t an exception back then. It was part of the rhythm.So what caused all this turnover? The evidence points to nature itself. Rapid climate shifts. Repeated volcanic eruptions. Some of them are enormous. One eruption, around a million years ago, reportedly covered much of the North Island in metres of ash. Forests would have vanished. Food sources are gone. Habitats were erased almost overnight.Dr Paul Scofield from Canterbury Museum describes it as a kind of reset. Forests are turning to shrubland. Then back again. Birds forced to adapt or vanish. It’s not hard to imagine how brutal that would have been.One of the most intriguing discoveries is a new parrot species named Strigops insulaborealis. It’s an ancient relative of today’s Kākāpō, the heavy, flightless parrot that has become a symbol of conservation in New Zealand. This ancestor appears different. Lighter build. Weaker legs. Researchers say it might have been able to fly. Or at least fly better than its modern descendant.That idea alone is fascinating. The Kākāpō we know today feels almost prehistoric already. The cave also revealed an extinct ancestor of the Takahē and a pigeon closely related to Australian bronzewing pigeons.

Choosing a New Bishop | Yes, Prime Minister | BBC Comedy Greats





In Yes Minister, when Jim Hacker finds out that Italian terrorists have access to British-made weapons, Sir Humphrey Appleby tries to mollify him by pointing out it’s not their department’s problem. British weapons in the hands of foreign terrorists were outside the Ministry of Administrative Affairs’ jurisdiction. Probably a Defence Ministry problem, or a Foreign Office problem, the unflappable bureaucrat points out, before a beleaguered Hacker hits back: “I am talking about good and evil.” This leads Sir Humphrey to point out that made it a “Church of England” problem.That quip, while hilarious, stands the test of time, because knowing the difference between good and evil is a heavy cross to bear for an institution created by a megalomaniac king who wanted a divorce.Now, the Church is in the news for getting its female Archbishop of Canterbury for the first time in its nearly 500-year-old history. In classic ecumenical tradition, her predecessor had to resign over an abuse scandal involving hundreds of boys. But why does England have a separate Church?It begins, inevitably, with Henry VIII, who married Catherine but couldn’t produce a male heir. The Pope refused to annul the marriage because Catherine was the aunt of Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor whose armies effectively controlled Rome — a man at whose snook the Pope could ill afford to cock.So, Henry decided it was time to do a Thanos and take matters into his own hands.The English Reformation followed. In 1534 Parliament passed the Act of Supremacy, one of the first instances of a government nationalising a foreign institution, which in this case was Roman Catholicism.From that moment on, the CoE was in the thick of things. Under James I and Charles I, it saw a fight between the clergy who wanted to go back to the Puritan basics and the royalists who wanted the pageantry and theatrics. Their fight was one of the inspirations for the High Sparrow arc in Game of Thrones, just like the Red Wedding was inspired by the Battle of the Roses.The Puritans won briefly.During the English Civil War, Oliver Cromwell put a break on the monarchy, named himself Lord Protector and banned all things fun, which instantly made the British nostalgic for the monarchy. During Cromwell’s time, the episcopal Church was effectively outlawed, and when Cromwell’s nepo kid failed to hold on to power, the church and crown returned with a vengeance.But the moment that really earned the Church its liturgical stripes was two books: the Book of Common Prayer and the King James Version of the Bible.In 1549, Archbishop Thomas Cranmer produced the first edition of the Book of Common Prayer. Before this, English worship followed Roman Catholic rites in Latin. Cranmer translated them into English and standardised them across the kingdom.This was the moment England became liturgically independent, taking Catholic structure and making it British, the theological equivalent of chicken tikka masala: foreign in origin but completely British.The Book of Common Prayer combined Protestant theology with Catholic ceremony to give a book whose phrases are still spoken across the world by English speakers, who might not be believers:The most famous is obviously peace in our time, which was uttered by Neville Chamberlain after the ill-fated Munich Agreement.Then came the King James Bible, which in time would become the most published book in the world, competing with the Little Red Book, Harry Potter and Don Quixote.Those two books gave England a way to worship independently of Rome while preserving much of the Catholic structure in English form.The CoE retained many of the traditions.Bishops still stood in a lineage traced back to the apostles. Baptism and Eucharist remained central. Vestments, altars, kneeling, and liturgical seasons stayed. The Mass was not reinterpreted. Cranmer rejected transubstantiation (bread and wine becoming blood and body) but preserved Communion as a sacred ritual. The choreography remained Catholic. The theology shifted Protestant. And some things were still hushed up.This hybrid identity became the Anglican formula: Catholic structure plus Protestant doctrine.Bishops, creeds, and hierarchy stayed. Papal supremacy and indulgences were swept under the rug.In the 18th and 19th centuries, the Church didn’t stand still. A religious revival led by preachers like John Wesley pushed the idea that faith should be personal and emotional, not just ceremonial. This movement energised ordinary believers and eventually gave rise to Methodism. A few decades later, another group inside the Church went in the opposite direction. The Oxford Movement argued that Anglicanism should reclaim its older Catholic-style rituals, emphasising tradition, ceremony, and sacred continuity.At the same time, the Church remained tightly bound to the British state. Bishops sat in Parliament, monarchs ruled as heads of the Church, and political leaders were expected to belong to it. Religion was not just private belief. It was built into the machinery of government.The 20th century dismantled that certainty. Conservatives accused secularism of creeping in. The British Empire slowly faded and the Church adapted. In 1994, women were ordained priests. By 2015, women bishops were approved. The LGBT+ movement remains a question, though. Priests are not allowed to solemnise same-sex marriages, but same-sex couples can receive prayers of blessing. Abuse scandals continued to expose institutional failures.Into this turbulence steps Sarah Mullally, the first woman to hold the office in nearly 1,400 years. Her background as a nurse and administrator suggests a leader shaped as much by systems management as theology.The appointment also highlights England’s constitutional theatre. The archbishop is formally appointed by King Charles III, relayed through Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has no theological role whatsoever. An atheist head of government advising a Christian monarch on a church appointment is the perfect embodiment of British satire.Reactions, as usual, were split. Many in Britain celebrated the progressive milestone. Conservative Anglican leaders around the world condemned it. The Vatican – which still doesn’t ordain female priests – put out a bland statement. The kind you give when you see your colleague get promoted.For Sarah Mullally, symbolism is the easy part. Governance is harder. She inherits a church facing three blunt pressures: decline, division, and credibility. Attendance continues to fall in an increasingly secular Britain, leaving the Church culturally visible but spiritually fragile. Internally, evangelical conservatives, Anglo-Catholic traditionalists, and liberal reformers coexist in permanent tension over gender, sexuality, and doctrine. Externally, safeguarding scandals have eroded moral authority and public trust.Perhaps the situation was best summed up by a septuagenarian Canterbury tour guide on her predecessors and his expectations: “Some of them have been very good, some of them have been pretty bad. Some of them have been very contentious, and some of them ended up murdered. I hope it doesn't happen to this one.” As British a sentiment as one can get.Of course, Henry VIII – based on what we know about him – would have been horrified knowing that a woman was now in charge of the Church he had created. Sir Humphrey would probably nod and say that he had always backed having a woman in charge. Or at least, an inter-departmental committee backed the general idea. Hacker would probably wonder if it could get him re-elected.All things considered, it’s hard not to smirk at the bathetic irony: an institution born because a man wanted to divorce his wife is now being led by a woman who will head one of the most influential Christian denominations in the world.","The Church is in the news for getting its female Archbishop of Canterbury for the first time in its nearly 500-year-old history.

Likewise, across social platforms and smaller diocesan networks, many Anglicans shared mixed reactions not just based on gender but reflecting hopes for new approaches to pastoral care, inclusion, and maintaining communion amid diversity.

Looking ahead: The future of Anglican leadership







On January 28, 2026, Dame Sarah Mullally was officially confirmed as the first female Archbishop of Canterbury, marking a watershed moment in the 1,400-year history of the Church of England and capturing global attention across the Anglican Communion, whose members span more than 165 countries. Her confirmation ceremony at St Paul’s Cathedral in London, an ancient and legal ecclesiastical rite, was both celebratory and symbolic. Bells rang as she took on the role of spiritual leader once held only by men and her pledge to champion unity and pastoral care resonated with many observers.However, while her appointment represents a historic advance in gender equality within global Christianity, it also exposed deep fractures within the worldwide Anglican Communion, from liberal provinces that celebrated the milestone to conservative branches that raised profound theological objections.In many parts of the Anglican world, Mullally’s appointment was welcomed as a long-overdue step toward equality and inclusion. Clergy and lay leaders from more progressive provinces applauded the Church of England for breaking the “stained-glass ceiling” and demonstrating that women can occupy the highest offices of spiritual leadership.Supporters point out that the Church of England first ordained female priests in 1994 and consecrated its first female bishop in 2015, a gradual arc of inclusion now culminating in Mullally’s leadership.Many advocates see her role as evidence that long-standing gender norms in church leadership are being reexamined and transformed.Even within traditionally conservative contexts, there were voices of hopeful affirmation. For example, Bishop Emily Onyango of Kenya argued that the appointment signaled a new dawn for the Church and called for peace and reconciliation across the Communion.Yet the reactions have not been universally positive:The Anglican Communion with roughly 100 million members globally has long struggled with internal theological disputes, especially on the status of women and LGBTQ+ inclusion. Mullally’s installation has brought these debates to the fore once again.Some observers say the appointment’s reaction illustrates how geographically and culturally diverse the Communion has become. In Western and Northern provinces, there is substantial support for expanding gender roles and ecclesiastical authority to women. In many African and Asian provinces, however, traditional interpretations of Scripture and ecclesial leadership still dominate.While the Archbishop of Canterbury is not a formal hierarchical head of the Communion, the global body has no central authority akin to the Pope in Catholicism, the role is widely regarded as a symbolic spiritual leader. That symbolic function is precisely what critics argue is now jeopardised by such a polarising appointment.Despite the disagreements, there are influential Anglican voices urging a path forward grounded in mutual respect and listening:As Dame Sarah Mullally prepares for her formal enthronement at Canterbury Cathedral in March 2026, the global Anglican Communion remains deeply engaged in its internal discourse over leadership, doctrine and identity. Her leadership will test whether the Anglican Communion, a body inherently broad and diverse, can embrace plurality without splintering further or whether her appointment will accelerate conversations about new structures for global Anglican unity.What is clear from the varied reactions, from jubilant progressives to worried conservatives, is that this historic moment has redefined conversations about faith, authority, and tradition across continents, cultures and congregations alike. The varied global response to Mullally’s appointment goes beyond church politics. It reflects wider societal discussions about gender equality in leadership roles, the interpretation of religious tradition in the modern age and how global institutions balance diversity with unity.As one member put it online, the appointment is “history in the making”, not just for the Church of England but for a global community wrestling with change.","Conservative Anglican groups have expressed strong objections to Mullally’s leadership, not only because she is a woman but also because of broader concerns over theological direction and biblical interpretation.

Her appointment was confirmed as the 106th Archbishop of Canterbury in a ceremony filled with centuries-old tradition at St Paul's Cathedral.Commenting on the resignation of her predecessor Justin Welby due to the accusations that he did not do enough with the information he had on a prolific abuser, Dame Sarah said it was right that there was greater scrutiny on her own record in dealing with safeguarding in the Church.""There's a sense of the weight of office that I feel, but I've also been very conscious of the huge support that I've had from people either writing [to me] or passing me in the streets,"" she said.Formerly England's chief nursing officer, Dame Sarah had been serving as the Bishop of London, since 2018.The 64-year-old set to lead the world's 85 million Anglicans also spoke about the female support she had received and the misogyny she has experienced and will be speaking out against.""It is fair to say that I have, both in my secular role, as well as in the Church, experienced misogyny at times,"" she said.While she acknowledged that she had received support from many men throughout her ministry, she also learned that the issues of misogyny needed to be ""brought into the open,"" something she intended to do.""I'm conscious that being in this role, it's important for me to speak of it [misogyny], because there are some who don't necessarily have the status or power of this role, and feel more hesitant to do it. I commit myself to making an environment where all people can flourish and which is safer for all,"" she said.Previously, in an interview with BBC Radio 4, Dame Sarah had shared that she had received ""hundreds and hundreds of letters of support"" from women, one even from an ordained woman who said the ""announcement of my appointment was the first time that she felt affirmed as a priest.""She was nominated by a 17-member commission composed of clerics and laypeople and her appointment was confirmed by King Charles III, who is the supreme governor of the church. Soon in March 2026, she will be formally installed as bishop of the diocese of Canterbury in a ceremony marking the beginning of her new role and public-facing ministry.",Dame Sarah Mullally has been confirmed as the first female Archbishop of Canterbury.

Australia hit by severe heatwave with burning across places nearing 50 C and thousands without power; here’s the reason,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/australia-hit-by-severe-heatwave-with-burning-across-places-nearing-50-c-and-thousands-without-power-heres-the-reason/articleshow/127806178.cms,"Source: The New York Times

Australia's heatwave pushes Victoria into days of extreme heat



Bushfires burn across Victoria as temperatures shatter records







A record-breaking heatwave has been gripping Australia for days now, and still temperatures have climbed to levels that feel almost unreal even by Australian standards. The heat that doesn’t just make headlines, but leaves scars.Australia is no stranger to heat; people expect it, plan for it, and complain about it, as bushfires are flaring. Thousands of homes have gone dark for many communities; it feels uncomfortably familiar. This has been like a warning heard before, but maybe not fully absorbed. Experts say this heatwave is among the worst seen in decades. Some compare it to moments etched deeply into Australia’s memory. As reported by The Bureau of Meteorology the heat is coming from a very large hot air mass that first built up in Western Australia’s interior and then moved eastward. Emergency services are stretched, hospitals see heat stress cases rise, and infrastructure strains reveal vulnerabilities across cities and remote regions.By Wednesday, parts of southeast Australia were entering the fifth straight day of severe to intense heat. Victoria, the country’s second-most populous state, has been hit particularly hard. Emergency officials say the heatwave is the worst the state has seen since the devastating Black Saturday bushfires of 2009, when 173 people lost their lives.“We are now into day five,” said Victoria’s Emergency Management Commissioner Tim Wiebusch. And it appears the situation isn’t easing quickly. Authorities expect up to eight consecutive days of severe to extreme heat. That’s a long time to stay alert and exhausted.Extreme heat does more than scorch landscapes but it quietly stresses infrastructure. At its peak, power outages affected around 105,000 properties across Victoria. By Wednesday, that number had dropped to roughly 11,000, but the pressure remains. High demand for cooling systems pushes ricity networks close to their limits. For families without power, the heat feels heavier.Firefighters have been battling multiple major bushfires across Victoria. At least six large fires were active, with three reportedly out of control. One of the most serious blazes is burning near the Carlisle River in the Otways region. More than 11,000 hectares have already been scorched. At least 16 buildings are gone. Fire authorities say this fire is far from contained. Winds will return. The landscape will dry further. The season is still young. That part worries people the most.“We are early in the summer,” said Chris Hardman, chief fire officer at Forest Fire Management Victoria. And the environment is only heating up. Meteorologists say the numbers are startling. David Crock from Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology described the temperatures as “very unusual.” Around 20 weather stations across western Victoria recorded either all-time highs or January records in a single day.Some towns in the Mallee region reached 48.9 degrees Celsius. The hottest temperature ever recorded in Victoria. Elsewhere, the heat spread north. Parts of western New South Wales and south-west Queensland also saw temperatures soar above 48°C by late afternoon. It feels relentless. Like the heat has nowhere else to go.","Australia's heatwave pushes Victoria into days of extreme heat.

Mystery solved: What makes the sliding rocks of Death Valley move on their own,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/mystery-solved-what-makes-the-sliding-rocks-of-death-valley-move-on-their-own/articleshow/127535194.cms,"Mystery solved: What makes the sliding rocks of Death Valley move on their own (Image source: Wikipedia)

What are the sliding rocks of Racetrack Playa

How scientists finally observed the rocks move

The ice, sun, and wind mechanism

Rainwater collects on the playa, forming a thin layer of water.

Cold nights freeze the water, creating fragile ice only a few millimetres thick.

As the morning sun warms the ice, it begins to break into large floating panels.

Light winds push the ice sheets, which in turn push the rocks, dragging them slowly across the wet mud.

Why this rare phenomenon only happen occasionally

What the trails reveal

Visiting the Racetrack Playa





In one of the hottest and driest parts of the world, there is a phenomenon that is most unexpected. At a remote dry lake bed in the world-famous Death Valley area in the United States, large rocks are seen to be in motion.They slowly slide over the desert floor, with long tracks that do not seem to ever lift. The incredible movement of these rocks in the Racetrack Playa area has been a phenomenon not understood by scientists as well as tourists.There was never any animal or wind activity that could have caused the movement of the large rocks over the desert surface.Over the years, several theories were put forward, perhaps wind or even magnetic activity.Recent studies and research in the area made the phenomenon seem like one of the most interesting slow-motion events in nature.Racetrack Playa, in a remote part of Death Valley, is a dry lakebed that turns a shallow, slick surface after the occasional rain.The stones scattered across the dry lake, also known as ""sailing stones"" or ""sliding rocks,"" leave behind long trails etched into the soft mud as if they had been propelled by an invisible force.These trails can extend for tens of meters, often hundreds of meters, sometimes in straight lines or gentle curves, but for decades, nobody has watched them in motion.In 2013 and 2014, a team led by researchers set up on Racetrack Playa GPS-equipped stones, weather stations, and time-lapse cameras. For the first time, they documented rocks actually moving, in the process leaving trails behind. Their 2014 paper, “ Sliding Rocks on Racetrack Playa, Death Valley National Park: First Observation of Rocks in Motion ”, chronicled for the first time the resolution of the long-standing mystery. The movement associated itself with shallow pools of water, forming after rain; freezing temperatures at night; and thin sheets of ice, which form on the playa surface.These mysterious moving stones have puzzled scientists for decades, appearing to defy gravity and logic. So how do massive rocks slide across a nearly flat desert floor? The answer is a precise combination of conditions:This movement continues until the ice disintegrates or the water evaporates, leaving behind the characteristic trails in the mud. Because the process is slow and rare, the rocks often move only a few centimetres per second.Sliding stones don't move every year, only when the rare mix of conditions is just right.Death Valley is one of North America's toughest environments, requiring enough precipitation to create shallow water, severe temperatures to freeze the water at night, and sunlight to melt the ice in the morning. Rock movement occurrences are extremely rare due to the importance of ensuring that all of these components occur in the correct order. As a result, stones may only be moved a few times over a period of years, if not decades.When these boulders move, they leave behind peculiar trails that tell their tale. Some of these trails are straight, some bend gradually, and others intersect each other. The length and direction of these trails would depend on wind direction, patterns of ice breakup, and the duration the ice sheets remained intact.Over time, hundreds of these trails were mapped by scientists, but it was the recording of actual motion that confirmed the cause.Nowadays, geologists, photographers, and curious tourists see the location as a must-see. It is most accessible during the cooler months, when the weather is calmer, and occasionally when unusual winter rain activates the sliding stones. Tourists considering a visit to the area should be prepared to drive through tough terrain. Visitors are also asked to observe specific criteria in order to safeguard the fragile surface and preserve the phenomena.","Mystery solved: What makes the sliding rocks of Death Valley move on their own.

“It's a scam”: Adin Ross sparks debate by demanding proof on MrBeast’s TeamWater charity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/its-a-scam-adin-ross-sparks-debate-by-demanding-proof-on-mrbeasts-teamwater-charity/articleshow/127833252.cms,"Adin Ross questioned the transparency of MrBeast’s TeamWater initiative during a January 30 livestream, saying high-profile charity projects need visible proof and regular updates. While denying he was calling the project a scam, Ross argued that silence invites skepticism. He compared the situation to Kai Cenat’s Africa school project, stressing that public accountability helps prevent backlash.

Adin Ross calls for proof as he questions MrBeast’s TeamWater project





Kick streamer Adin Ross has once again ignited debate around influencer-led philanthropy, this time by questioning how transparency should work when creators raise money for global causes. During a January 30 livestream, Ross reacted to a viral clip involving MrBeast and criticism aimed at his TeamWater initiative. The moment quickly shifted from online drama to a wider conversation about trust, proof, and public accountability.Rather than accusing anyone of wrongdoing, Ross framed his comments as skepticism rooted in visibility. In a digital space flooded with clips, receipts, and constant updates, he argued that silence invites doubt.His remarks landed at a time when creator philanthropy is under intense scrutiny, with audiences increasingly demanding evidence that good intentions translate into real-world results.Ross made it clear that his stance was not an attack, but a call for clarity. He told viewers: ""This is the thing, all right? Like, I ain't going to lie, you know what MrBeast needs to do, though? He just needs to have it get posted, like, the proof.Because, like, obviously, I want to believe it's real, too. I haven't seen it. I'm not saying it's a scam. Like, he got really mad that I, like, it seemed like I insinuated that, but I wasn't. So, that's what I mean, though. We need the proof.""Ross then widened the lens by referencing Kai Cenat and his school-building project in Nigeria. According to Ross, even well-meaning creators face backlash when updates are scarce.He explained: ""It's the same thing with Kai and the school. He's always going to get hate without proof. You've got to give people the proof. You have to show people, that, you know, it's being build and all these things. You know? It can't be that hard to give an update. You know? So, that's just what people want to say.""Doubling down, Ross stressed that he was not labeling TeamWater a fraud. His closing words underscored frustration rather than suspicion:""But I'm not going to sit here and say, 'Scam.' It's like, 'No, it's a scam,' I'm not going to put that accusation out there, but I will say that we need a f**king update. You know what I mean? Straight up, we need an update.""As of now, MrBeast has not publicly responded. The discussion, however, highlights a growing expectation. In the age of creator influence, impact alone is not enough. Audiences want to see the journey, not just hear the promise.","Adin Ross questioned the transparency of MrBeast’s TeamWater initiative during a January 30 livestream, saying high-profile charity projects need visible proof and regular updates.

Expanding cycling culture in the UAE



UAE traffic and public engagement in cycling







Dubai’s vibrant cycling scene is once again in the spotlight as the Al Salam Cycling Championship continues its tenth season with high-stakes desert races, attracting top cyclists, elite competitors and enthusiastic spectators to the iconic Al Marmoom Reserve in the Saih Al Salam area this weekend. Under the patronage and directives of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, the championship has evolved into one of the most exciting and inclusive sporting events in the region.The weekend’s action kicked off on Saturday, January 31, 2025, with the Desert Race for Women, covering a challenging 20 km course designed to test endurance, strategy and resilience across a rugged desert terrain. The event featured two categories, one for Emirati women and another open to all nationalities, highlighting the inclusive spirit of the championship and providing a platform for female cyclists to shine on one of Dubai’s most demanding outdoor stages.On Sunday, February 1, the focus shifts to the men’s desert race, a 52 km showdown that includes special cash-prize challenges for standout performances. This staging marks the fourth and fifth rounds of the Al Salam Championship’s tenth edition, following earlier highlights such as the Security and Safety Race, organised in cooperation with Dubai Police and tailored for Emirati cyclists and the Ruler of Dubai Court Race, a high-profile event that drew elite professional riders from around the world.A significant talking point this year is the AED 455,000 total prize pool for the desert races, the largest ever for desert cycling competitions in the region. This exceptional prize money underscores the event’s growing prestige and its ability to attract a high calibre of participants from both local and international cycling circuits. Riders are urged to equip themselves fully. Helmets, goggles and essential gear are mandatory, given the demanding nature of the desert course, which features varied terrain and environmental challenges that test physical stamina and technical skill.The prominence of the desert races follows a series of competitive encounters that have already taken place in the championship calendar. Earlier this month, the championship staged a women’s race at Al Marmoom Reserve that drew some of the world’s top female cyclists, delivering thrilling head-to-head competition and showcasing world-class athleticism on UAE soil.The Al Salam Cycling Championship, now in its tenth edition, began in late 2025 and has since become a fixture in the UAE’s sports calendar, blending elite competition with community engagement. The season kicked off with the Emirati Men’s Amateur Race in December 2025, followed by the Elite Ruler’s Court Race in January 2026, both of which were organised with strong backing from local authorities and cycling federations.Earlier rounds also saw leading professional cyclists compete under the watchful eyes of dignitaries, including Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, who has consistently emphasised the role of sport in fostering healthy lifestyles, unity, and global sporting excellence. At the Elite Race, held in January, His Highness was present to witness key competitive moments, reinforcing the event’s significance as a platform for both elite sport and community participation.The Al Salam Championship is more than a series of races; it is part of a broader movement to embed cycling as a popular, accessible sport across the UAE. Over the past decade, the event has helped inspire thousands of residents and visitors to embrace cycling, whether as competitive athletes or recreational enthusiasts exploring Dubai’s scenic routes and desert landscapes. Initiatives linked to the championship, such as community rides, photography contests (in partnership with the Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum International Photography Award), and inclusive race categories for different age groups and skill levels, reflect a strategic push to broaden the sport’s appeal.Cycling aficionados and athletes alike view Al Marmoom Reserve as a natural hub for endurance sports, with its varied terrain and expansive desert setting offering an ideal backdrop for both competitive and recreational cycling. Local authorities have also leveraged this interest to expand cycling infrastructure, promote safe riding culture, and position Dubai as a global cycling-friendly destination.With the championship’s popular appeal comes practical considerations for city residents and visitors. In past years, the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has issued special advisories ahead of major races, including temporary road closures and traffic adjustments to ensure safety and smooth conduct of events linked to the Al Salam Cycling Championship and related cycling festivals. These measures reflect the high profile of cycling events in Dubai and their impact on urban mobility planning during peak weekends.Athletes competing in the desert races this weekend are not just racing for prize money; they are contributing to a larger narrative of sporting excellence, outdoor adventure and community pride that reflects the UAE’s broader ambitions in health, sports participation and international sports tourism. Public engagement has been strong, with large numbers of spectators and supporters attending the races, sharing social media content from the event sites, and following live updates that celebrate athletic achievement, community spirit, and cultural vibrancy. The championship’s blend of elite competition and inclusive participation continues to resonate with audiences across the UAE and internationally.As the tenth season progresses, attention will soon turn to future stages of the Al Salam Cycling Championship, including any additional invitational races, community challenges and potential year-end events that cap off Dubai’s rich calendar of cycling activities. With strong support from national and local institutions (including the Dubai Sports Council, UAE Cycling Federation and other strategic partners) the championship is poised to maintain its momentum and grow its legacy as a premier cycling event in the Middle East.","Dubai’s vibrant cycling scene is once again in the spotlight as the Al Salam Cycling Championship continues its tenth season with high-stakes desert races.

Dubai Police are taking community engagement to a new level by inviting UAE residents to capture the action at the upcoming UAE SWAT Challenge and win cash prizes. The move aims to blend high-adrenaline tactical competition with digital creativity and public participation. The announcement has quickly become one of the most talked-about local developments, especially among students, content creators and social media users across the Emirates.As a part of a new initiative called the SWAT Clip Award, Dubai Police will offer up to Dh30,000 (about $10,000) for the best short video made by residents during the event, which runs from February 7 to 11 at the Al Ruwayyah training grounds.The UAE SWAT Challenge is a high-profile international tactical competition organised by the Dubai Police General Command. Now in its seventh edition, this event attracts elite special tactical teams from around the world to compete across demanding scenarios, from assault and obstacle courses to officer rescue and tower challenges, testing teamwork, strategy and endurance.This year’s event has already drawn 114 teams from 48 countries, making it the largest edition yet and reflecting Dubai’s growing role as a global hub for police excellence and security cooperation.Unlike typical spectator events, the SWAT Clip Award is designed specifically to bring the community inside the action. Participants, especially students, are encouraged to submit 30- to 60-second creative videos showing anything from teamwork and tactical skills to cultural diversity and human values displayed during the challenge.Under the SWAT Clip Award -Additional cash rewards of up to Dh30,000 in total are on offer for the most compelling and well-crafted entries, making it a rare opportunity for residents to earn money while capturing a world-class event. Entrants must follow guidelines such as shooting in portrait mode (vertical), adhering to safety instructions at the venue and ensuring that content reflects the spirit of teamwork, discipline and fair competition. Drones are not allowed unless officially authorised.Officials say the competition is part of a broader strategy to foster closer ties between the police and the UAE community, especially young people who are active on platforms like Instagram, TikTok and YouTube. Brigadier Ali Al Mansouri, Director of the General Department of Community Happiness at Dubai Police, emphasized the SWAT Clip initiative’s goal of showcasing the professionalism of participating teams as well as “the human values that define the competition. ”By inviting residents to document the event, Dubai Police are tapping into a vibrant culture of mobile content creation, where authentic, resident-generated videos can boost awareness, pride and engagement far beyond traditional media coverage. This also enables the public to see elite policing in action and celebrate the discipline, courage and coordination that define special units.The UAE SWAT Challenge has a strong track record of global involvement. In 2025, it broke Guinness World Records for the number of participating nations and teams, underlining its reputation as one of the world’s most ambitious tactical competitions. The event combines practical tactical tests such as obstacle courses, hostage rescue simulations and tower challenges with opportunities for expert exchange between international police forces.Dubai Police also places a premium on professional benchmarking, with teams earning points across daily challenges leading to an overall champion trophy. By adding a public-facing video contest, organisers are broadening the appeal of the event beyond law enforcement circles to include students, creators, families and digital audiences. The initiative reflects how major sporting and tactical events can be amplified through community participation and social media storytelling.The response on social platforms has been enthusiastic, particularly among university students and young creators who see the SWAT Clip Award as a chance to combine creativity with real-world excitement. Many residents have already shared tips on filming mobile footage at large events, while social media groups are buzzing with suggestions on the best ways to capture striking angles, teamwork highlights and candid moments between competition heats.The reward has motivated some to plan storyboards, scout locations at the venue and prepare editing styles that underscore discipline, spirit and tactical precision. Overall, the challenge and its accompanying video contest are already shaping up to be a highlight of the UAE’s February event calendar, drawing not just elite police teams but also a growing network of creative residents and digital storytellers.The SWAT Clip Award demonstrates how law enforcement events can evolve into community-driven cultural moments, blending professional competition with creative expression. With cash prizes, international participation and high visibility, this initiative could set a precedent for how security agencies worldwide engage with the public in an increasingly interconnected digital landscape.As Dubai Police gear up for the event from February 7 to 11, residents and visitors alike are preparing to capture the action, tell their stories and potentially walk away with Dh30,000 in pocket, turning tactical excellence into public celebration and digital creativity.","Dubai Police offer residents up to Dh30,000 for best video at UAE SWAT Challenge.

Stonehenge mystery solved? Study reveals how 25-tonne stones reached the site in southern England,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/stonehenge-mystery-solved-study-reveals-how-25-tonne-stones-reached-the-site-in-southern-england/articleshow/127561744.cms,"Researchers uncovered the truth behind Stonehenge’s 25 tonne stones

Salisbury Plain shows no sign of ancient ice

Sarsens were local but still demanding

Bluestones point clearly to human effort

What the science changes and what it does not





Stonehenge, located on open chalk terrain in southern England, is identifiable but curiously unexplained. For decades, one practical question has hung over the site without being resolved. How did stones weighing hundreds of tonnes arrive here before wheels, metal tools, and written plans? A recent study done by geologists at Curtin University solidifies that disagreement. The researchers looked at small mineral grains in nearby river sediments to check if glaciers had transported the stones south during the Ice Age. The results indicate away from the ice and towards the people. The area surrounding Salisbury Plain has no chemical signs of glacial transit.Instead, sediments reflect local recycling. This lends weight to the hypothesis that Neolithic communities deliberately moved the stones over long distances on their own.The research “Detrital zircon–apatite fingerprinting challenges glacial transport of Stonehenge’s megaliths” focuses on detrital minerals, mainly zircon and apatite, found in streams that drain Salisbury Plain. These grains act as long-lived markers of where sediment has travelled. If glaciers had crossed the area, they would likely have left behind mineral signatures from Wales or northern Britain.That signal is absent. The zircon ages instead match rocks already known from southern England, suggesting the material has been recycled locally rather than dumped by ice. This matters because glacial transport has often been used as a convenient explanation. If ice sheets had carried the stones close to Stonehenge, human effort could be seen as minimal. The new data makes that position harder to hold.The finding also contributes to a growing consensus among geomorphologists. There is very little physical evidence that glaciers reached Salisbury Plain during the Pleistocene. There are no visible moraines, no continuous erratic paths, and no buried till layers. While ice did penetrate far into Britain during earlier cold periods, its southern boundaries are still well north of the monument. Fine sediments can move far beyond glaciers by meltwater. Larger stones typically do not. The lack of glacial fingerprints in the surrounding silt makes it improbable that the multi-tonne rocks arrived by coincidence.Stonehenge was not entirely assembled from distant sources. The sarsens, which are the largest stones, were obtained from West Woods, which is approximately 25 kilometres to the north. Although the distance may appear inconsequential, the stones are each approximately 25 tonnes in weight. Planning, labour, and time would have been necessary to relocate them. The mineral analysis does not explicitly address sarsens; rather, it corroborates a more extensive pattern. Stonehenge was not constructed using materials that were haphazardly found in the vicinity. The materials were intentionally chosen and introduced.The smaller bluestones tell a sharper story. Their geological fingerprints match outcrops in the Preseli Hills of west Wales, around 230 kilometres away. Some stones may have travelled by sea for part of that journey, others overland. Either way, the distances involved rule out casual movement. One stone stands out even more. The Altar Stone appears to come from the Orcadian Basin in northeast Scotland. If correct, that implies a journey of more than 700 kilometres. No known ice route explains this. Human organisation does.The study does not describe exactly how the stones were moved. Sledges, rollers and boats remain plausible tools. What it does change is the balance of probability. Stonehenge looks less like a monument finished by chance and more like one completed through sustained effort. There is no single moment where the mystery disappears. Instead, the space for easy answers narrows. The stones arrived because people brought them. That idea now sits more comfortably with the evidence, even if the work behind it remains only partly visible.","Researchers looked at small mineral grains in nearby river sediments to check if glaciers had transported the stones south during the Ice Age.

The Happisburgh 800,000-year-old footprints mark the earliest human presence in northern Europe

Soft estuarine mud helped preserve the ancient footprints

Digital recording captured the footprints before they vanished

Foot size estimates suggest a mixed age group

The footprints align with evidence of Homo antecessor

Happisburgh sediments preserve a wider record of early life

The footprints offer a brief but direct human trace





A brief period of low tide along a tranquil coastline in eastern England revealed an uncommon sight in Europe. A series of human footprints emerged on a Norfolk beach, momentarily exposed by shifting sands and pressed into ancient mud. The impressions were fleeting and fragile, yet they were sufficiently distinct to be captured prior to the sea's return. The impressions were subsequently verified by archaeologists to be approximately 800,000 years old, making them the oldest human footprints ever discovered outside of Africa. The site, located in close proximity to the village of Happisburgh, provides direct evidence that early humans resided in a much northern region than had been previously believed. The discovery provides physical detail to a profound period of human history that is typically only known through scattered stone implements and bone fragments.The footprints were uncovered on the foreshore at Happisburgh on the Norfolk coast, an area already known for its early prehistoric remains. Researchers estimate the prints were made between one million and 780,000 years ago, during the Early Pleistocene.At that time, Britain was connected to mainland Europe by a land bridge, and the climate, while cooler than southern regions, could still support human groups.According to the research article “Hominin Footprints from Early Pleistocene Deposits at Happisburgh, UK” , the impressions include prints from adults and children, suggesting a small group rather than a single individual. Their size and shape fall within the range expected for early human species living in Europe at the time.Footprints rarely survive in the archaeological record. At Happisburgh, a specific set of conditions made preservation possible. The prints were formed in soft but stable estuarine mud, likely along the edge of a slow-moving river. Soon after being made, the surface was covered by layers of fine sediment, sealing the impressions before erosion could destroy them.Over hundreds of thousands of years, coastal processes buried and later re-exposed the surface. Modern coastal erosion finally brought the prints back into view, though only briefly.The footprints were visible for only a short time before waves and wind erased them. Archaeologists worked quickly, using multi-image photogrammetry to create detailed three-dimensional digital models. These models remain the only permanent record of the footprints.Through this method, researchers could identify heel marks, arches, and in one case, toe impressions. The orientation of the prints suggests the group was walking south across a muddy flat near the water’s edge.By measuring the length of the footprints, researchers estimated the individuals ranged from about one metre to nearly one point seven metres in height. This points to a group that included both children and adults.Such evidence is rare for this period. Early human fossils from Europe are extremely scarce, especially in Britain. The footprints provide information about body size, movement, and group behaviour that bones alone often cannot.No human fossils from this time period have been found in the UK. However, the footprints match the size range of Homo antecessor, a species identified from fossil remains in Atapuerca, Spain. Homo antecessor is currently the only known human species in western Europe from a similar age.While the species cannot be confirmed without skeletal remains, the footprints are consistent with what is known from southern Europe.The footprint surface sits within the Hill House Formation, a sequence of estuarine sands and silts laid down during a warm interglacial phase. These sediments have also yielded stone tools, animal remains, and plant evidence, building a picture of a landscape that early humans could inhabit.Together, these finds show that early humans were capable of surviving in northern environments far earlier than once assumed.Unlike tools or bones, footprints capture a moment rather than an object. At Happisburgh, that moment lasted only long enough to be recorded. The sea has since reclaimed the surface.What remains is a quiet record of people moving across a muddy shore, long before Britain was an island and long before history left written traces.","The 800,000-year-old footprints mark the earliest human presence in northern Europe.

Vivian Wilson recalls childhood trips

What remains unclear





Freshly released Jeffrey Epstein-related documents have reignited scrutiny around Elon Musk’s past associations, this time pulling in an unexpected voice from inside his own family.As emails detailing Musk’s attempted visits to Epstein’s private Caribbean island circulated online this week, his estranged daughter Vivian Wilson shared a brief but unsettling recollection from her childhood, referencing holiday travel in the same region.The newly released files from the US Department of Justice include email exchanges between Musk and Epstein from 2012 and 2013. The correspondence shows the two communicating cordially while attempting to coordinate Musk’s visit to Epstein’s private island, Little St. James.In a December 13, 2013 email, Musk wrote, “Will be in the BVI/St Bart’s area over the holidays. Is there a good time to visit?”Epstein replied, “any day 1st - 8th . play it by ear if you want. always space for you.”After further exchanges, January 2 was tentatively selected. However, Epstein later canceled, citing scheduling conflicts.“Bad news- Unfortunately , my schedule will keep me in New York. I was really looking forward to finally spending some time together with just fun as the agenda.so i am very disappointed. Hopefully we can schedule another time in the near future,” Epstein wrote.Another email chain from November 2012 shows Epstein asking Musk, “how many people will you be for the heli to island”.“Probably just Talulah and me. What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?” Musk replied, referencing his former wife Talulah Riley.On December 25, Musk followed up after Epstein encouraged him to visit again.“Do you have any parties planned? I’ve been working to the edge of sanity this year and so, once my kids head home after Christmas, I really want to hit the party scene in St Barts or elsewhere and let loose. The invitation is much appreciated, but a peaceful island experience is the opposite of what I’m looking for,” Musk wrote.Epstein responded, “Understood , I will see you on st Barth, the ratio on my island might make Talilah uncomfortable.”“Ratio is not a problem for Talulah,” Musk replied.That visit, too, ultimately fell through. “Logistics won’t work this time around,” Musk later wrote.As the emails spread widely online, Vivian Wilson, Musk’s estranged transgender daughter, weighed in with her own memory of childhood travel in the region.Writing on Threads, Wilson said, “There was this boat ride from St Vincent to St Barth's I remember from when I was little. We used to visit around the holidays. I remember the sea being so dark at night.”Wilson would have been around nine years old at the time the emails were exchanged.It is not clear whether Musk ever actually visited Epstein’s private island. While the emails show multiple attempts to arrange meetings, both planned visits appear to have been canceled due to logistical or scheduling issues. The documents do not confirm that Musk ever set foot on Little St. James.Wilson is one of Musk’s children from his first marriage to author Justine Wilson. The 21-year-old has publicly distanced herself from Musk and filed a petition in 2022 to legally change her name, stating she did not want to be “related to [her] biological father in any way, shape or form.”",Elon Musk's estranged transgender daughter recalls childhood trips to the Caribbean.
