Bangladesh seek T20 WC match shift from India after Mustafizur Rahman's IPL exit

A senior Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) official’s comment calling former captain Tamim Iqbal ""an Indian agent"" has drawn criticism from players in the country. Tamim, one of Bangladesh’s leading openers, had advised the BCB not to be driven by emotion while deciding on the national team’s participation in the T20 World Cup in India.Nazmul, chairman of the BCB finance committee, made the remark in a Facebook post.""This time, the people of Bangladesh witnessed, with their own eyes, the emergence of yet another proven Indian agent,"" he wrote.The post received immediate backlash from former and current cricketers, including Taskin Ahmed, Mominul Haque, and Taijul Islam.The Cricketers’ Welfare Association of Bangladesh (CWAB) also expressed concern.""A comment made by BCB director M Nazmul Islam regarding former national captain Tamim Iqbal has come to the attention of the Cricketers' Welfare Association of Bangladesh. We are stunned, shocked, and outraged by it. Such a remark by a board official about the most successful opener in Bangladesh's history, who represented the country for 16 years, is utterly condemnable.""""Not only because it concerns a player like Tamim, but such comments about any cricketer of the country are unacceptable and insulting to the entire cricketing community,"" the players’ body said in a statement.The 36-year-old Tamim played 70 Tests, 243 ODIs, and 78 T20 Internationals for Bangladesh.""We strongly protest against this comment. When a responsible board director makes such remarks on a public platform, it also raises serious questions about the code of conduct of board officials,"" CWAB said.""We have already submitted a protest letter to the BCB president, demanding a public apology from the concerned board director and that he be brought under accountability. We hope the BCB president will take appropriate action as soon as possible,"" the statement added.Bangladesh had written to the International Cricket Council requesting their T20 World Cup games be moved out of India after the BCCI asked IPL franchise Kolkata Knight Riders to release Mustafizur Rahman ahead of the 2026 edition.""Cricket is the life of Bangladesh. A recent comment surrounding a former national captain who has made a major contribution to the game has caused many to reflect,"" said pacer Taskin.""I believe that such remarks directed at a former cricketer of the country are not helpful in the interest of Bangladesh cricket. I hope the concerned authorities will consider the matter seriously and adopt a more responsible stance in the future,"" he added.In 2007, Tamim’s half-century had helped Bangladesh eliminate India from the ODI World Cup in the Caribbean.Former Bangladesh captain Mominul said Nazmul’s remarks were unacceptable.""The comment made by BCB director M Nazmul Islam regarding former national captain Tamim Iqbal is completely unacceptable and insulting to the country's cricketing community. Such behaviour towards a cricketer is in direct conflict with the board's responsibility and ethics,"" Mominul said.""A senior cricketer was not given even the minimum respect; instead, he was deliberately humiliated in public. Such remarks show a lack of even basic decorum regarding where and how to speak while holding such a high responsibility.""I strongly condemn this comment and firmly demand a public apology from the concerned director and that he be brought under accountability. I call upon the BCB to take swift and strict action,"" he added.","Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) official M Nazmul Islam called former captain Tamim Iqbal ""an Indian agent"" in a Facebook post.

'India Will Develop Even On Autopilot', Says NSA Ajit Doval As He Credits PM Modi’s Leadership

NEW DELHI: National security adviser Ajit Doval , widely referred to as India's 'spymaster or James Bond', has revealed that he does not use a mobile-phone or internet in his day-to-day work.When asked if he used mobile or internet for routine work, the NSA replied, ""It is true that I do not use internet. I also do not use a phone, except for family matters or for speaking to people in other countries, which is necessary. I manage my work that way. There are many other means of communication as well, and some additional methods have to be arranged that people are not aware of.""He said this while addressing the inaugural session of Viksit Bharat Young Leaders Dialogue 2026 at Bharat Mandapam here Saturday.Doval, who has been NSA since 2014, said it is important to take the right and farsighted decisions at the utmost time, particularly for the youth. However, the former IB director advised it is important to think about what ""the next two steps will be before a person takes the first step"".He said India needs to strengthen itself as ""we had a painful history of attacks and subjugation"". ""We were a very advanced civilisation.We never broke anyone's temples. We did not attack any foreigners, even when the rest of the world was weak, we did not understand the threats to our security. And, so history taught us a lesson. It is important that we remember that lesson because if the youth forget it, then it would be tragic for the country,"" the NSA said.""Revenge is not a good word, but it can be a huge force. We have to avenge our history and take this country to the point where it is great again not just in terms of border security, but economy, social development, every aspect,"" he said.The NSA spoke about the importance of decision-making in leadership and nation-building. ""One common thing between when I was young and how I am today is the ability to make decisions. Whether you realise it or not, decision-making always walks with you. Youth take small and big decisions in daily life, and as you grow, these small decisions add up to big ones,"" he said. ""Napoleon once said, 'I am not afraid of 1,000 lions led by a sheep, but I am afraid of 1,000 sheep led by a lion'. That is how important leadership is,"" he explained.Expressing confidence in India's future, Doval said, ""India will be developed. The level to which our country has been brought under PM Modi, it will soon achieve the goal of being a developed nation. The real question is - who will lead the nation towards that development?

Shashi Tharoor Praises Nehru’s Democracy Role, Admits 1962 Errors, Accuses BJP Of Blame Politics

NEW DELHI: Senior Congress leader and MP Shashi Tharoor on Thursday once again appeared to strike a balanced tone. While expressing respect for the country's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru , and calling him the founder of Indian democracy, Tharoor also said it was necessary to acknowledge Nehru's mistakes, adding that blaming him alone for India's problems is unjustified.Speaking at the fourth edition of the Kerala Legislative Assembly International Book Festival (KLIBF), Tharoor spoke on the BJP government's treatment of Nehru's legacy.""I am a fan of Jawaharlal Nehru, but not an uncritical fan. I greatly admire his mind and outlook, and I have deep respect for him, though I cannot support all his beliefs and policies 100%. Many of the things he did deserve the highest appreciation. Most importantly, it was Nehru who firmly established democracy in India... I would not say that they (the Modi government) are anti-democratic, but they are certainly anti-Nehru. Nehru has been turned into a convenient scapegoat,"" he said.Recalling the 1962 India–China war, the Thiruvananthapuram MP said, ""In some cases, their (Modi government's) criticism may have a basis. For instance, the 1962 defeat against China can partly be attributed to some of Nehru’s decisions.""He then turned his focus to the ruling BJP, adding, ""But what they do now is blame Nehru for everything, regardless of the issue.""In recent times, Tharoor's stance and political alignment have come under close scrutiny. Unlike many other party leaders, he does not always adhere to strict partyline statements, often appearing less comfortable with unquestioned loyalty to the Congress high command.Reflecting on his journey as a writer, Tharoor said his love for reading began in childhood due to asthma. With no television or mobile phones, books became his constant companions.He revealed that he wrote his first novel at a very young age, though it was later lost to an ink spillage. His biography of Sree Narayana Guru marks his 28th book.Tharoor also mentioned that while reading habits are declining globally, Kerala continues to lead in reading culture. He said he wrote ""The Great Indian Novel"" in 1989 as a satirical work, a genre that was largely absent in India at the time.Addressing the younger generation, Tharoor suggested that shorter books with fewer pages may be more appealing to readers who struggle to find time. He also fondly recalled his college days at St Stephen’s College, Delhi, remembering a stage production where he played Antony while filmmaker Mira Nair portrayed Cleopatra.","Senior Congress leader and MP Shashi Tharoor spoke at the fourth edition of the Kerala Legislative Assembly International Book Festival.

Donna Kelce finds reality TV inspiration in Taylor Swift’s music

Donna Kelce has spent years cheering from NFL suites, but her latest spotlight came far from a football field. The mother of Travis Kelce stepped into a different kind of pressure cooker with her appearance on The Traitors, and she credits an unexpected source for helping her survive the mind games.As alliances formed and suspicion filled the Scottish castle, Donna leaned on the music of Taylor Swift . What started as casual listening turned into a mindset shift, one that helped her navigate deception, strategy, and social tension on reality television.During the Season 4 premiere, Donna revealed that Swift’s 2022 track “Vigilante S**t” played a role in shaping her approach. She summed up her game plan with a sharp line, “Don’t get mad, get even.” The phrase mirrors Swift’s lyric, “Don’t get sad, get even,” and Donna admitted it helped her stay focused rather than emotional as the competition intensified.Donna joined the show after encouragement from her sons, including Jason Kelce, both longtime fans of the series. “They’re so excited,” she said, describing their reaction when she told them she was in.Filmed inside a castle in Scotland and hosted by Alan Cumming, The Traitors challenges contestants to lie, build alliances, and outlast one another for a prize of up to $250,000.For Donna, the experience represented more than a TV appearance. It marked a personal turning point.“I never thought in a million years I would get this chance,” Donna said. “When you get to a certain part in your life, and your kids are starting their own families, it’s so important to reinvent yourself. Do the things you’ve always dreamt of and that’s how I ended up in Scotland.”She also joked about potential awkward encounters, including running into rivals connected to her sons. Yet the nerves did not outweigh the excitement.Donna is also connected to Swift since October 2023, when the singer appeared on stage the first time in a collaboration with her at Arrowhead Stadium. Their worlds have since that time remained in unanticipated ways of intersecting.Pointed neither at the field chocolate barricades nor atop the Scottish castle, the path of Donna Kelce demonstrates that having confidence, breaking molds, and a carefully crafted soundtrack will open the door at any age.Also Read: “I don't want to”: Travis Kelce’s wedding rule for Taylor Swift is already raising eyebrows","Donna Kelce revealed that music by her future daughter-in-law Taylor Swift helped shape her strategy on The Traitors.

Dennis Schroder reacts to his three-game suspension

Also Read:

Dennis Schroder faces a three-game suspension without pay. The athlete was involved in a post-game feud with the Los Angeles Lakers’ star Luka Doncic. Following the suspension, several NBA personalities have reflected on the decision. The Lakers’ coach, JJ Redick, also cleverly weighed in with his opinion on the matter. He refused to make an explicit statement and tagged the entire incident “a league matter.”On December 28, Dennis and Luka had a back-and-forth against each other during the second half of the game. Post the game, Dennis went towards Luka and tried to confront him on the issue. It was 40 minutes after the game had ended. However, the officials intervened and later they concluded that the Sacramento Kings star had attempted to strike Doncic.The Los Angeles Lakers coach, JJ Redick, has always been careful with his statements. Even if it involved players from his own team. Recently, a controversy involved the star player Luka Doncic and the Sacramento Kings' athlete Dennis Schroder. The latter player even had to face a three-game suspension following the incident on December 28. While comments from within the NBA are coming in on the incident, JJ Redick had a totally different approach to it.When asked about Schroder’s suspension, he simply stated, “I mean, look, it’s just a league matter. So I don’t really have a comment on it. They made the decision. It’s up to them.” With this statement, the Lakers’ coach steered away from getting involved in the controversy.Dennis Schroder’s reaction to his three-game suspension was rather amusing. The player did not showcase any signs of worry. Rather, his response to the entire incident seemed like the athlete was not very worried about the suspension. ESPN’s Shams Charania posted on Instagram, providing fans with an update on the action taken against the athlete. Reacting to the post, Dennis simply wrote, “Attempting,” followed by a laughing emoji.ESPN’s Anthony Slater stated that the incident was not just a post-game issue. Both Dennis and Luka were seen involved in verbal exchanges during the second half of the game. Luka reportedly brought up the topic of contracts with Dennis. The Lakers’ star believed that Dennis should have signed the 4-year, $82 million contract offered to him from the Los Angeles team.","Dennis Schroder was involved in a post-game feud with the Los Angeles Lakers' star Luka Doncic.

New England Patriots playoff return reflects Drake Maye’s steady rise



Drake Maye’s Wife Ann Michael (Instagram)

New England Patriots football feels different again in Foxborough, and that change is impossible to ignore the moment you step near Gillette Stadium. For the first time since the Tom Brady era, the Patriots are hosting a playoff game with a new face leading the huddle. Drake Maye’s rise has been fast, confident, and quietly dominant. As the Wild Card spotlight sharpens, the energy around this team is not frantic or loud. It is measured. Focused. The kind of mood that usually surrounds contenders who believe they belong here.That confidence spilled beyond the field before kickoff. Long before the first snap against the Los Angeles Chargers, Ann Michael Maye caught attention with a polished, playoff-ready look that felt symbolic. Calm on the surface. Sharp underneath. In a building built on legacy, the message was subtle but clear. This era is comfortable owning its moment.Drake Maye did not drag the Patriots back into January football with noise or bravado. He did it with control. The second-year quarterback put together a season that demanded national respect, throwing for 4,394 yards with 31 touchdowns against just eight interceptions.Those numbers mattered, but his command mattered more. The offense rarely looked rushed. Mistakes were limited. Situations stayed manageable.That poise showed again in the regular-season finale against Miami, when Maye threw only 18 passes while the Patriots ran for 243 yards. It was a quiet flex. A team confident enough to win without forcing anything. That balance is why New England secured the No. 2 seed and why belief inside the locker room feels earned, not manufactured.Off the field, Ann Michael Maye has built her own presence. Her baking videos became a hit, her Patriots-themed cookies turning into game-week rituals for fans. On Saturday, January 10, she announced her new project, the “Beyond Bakemas” show, reinforcing that her growing profile stands on its own. Then came a simple Instagram post hours before kickoff. “Happy Gameday”. Two words that matched the team’s mindset perfectly.Sunday night brings pressure. This is Maye’s first playoff start. The Chargers bring a defense that thrives on collapsing pockets and speeding up decisions. But their offense enters banged up, while New England stayed sharp. If the Patriots control the line early and Maye stays patient, the path forward opens.Win and the season continues at home. Lose and it ends. The calm tone around this team suggests they understand exactly what is at stake and feel ready for it.Also Read: What happened between A.J. Brown and Nick Sirianni that led to a heated Eagles sideline confrontation?","Drake Maye’s rise has been fast, confident, and quietly dominant. The energy around this team is not frantic or loud.

Dave Roberts’ career, contracts, and estimated net worth

Tricia Roberts' contribution beyond baseball to the household’s financial balance

Dave Roberts is one of the most esteemed figures in Major League Baseball today. Not only because of his intuitive leadership qualities on the field, but more specifically because he has managed to leverage his existence in the realm of baseball into long-term financial prosperity. As the Dodgers’ manager in Los Angeles, he has led his side to take home World Series Championships on more than one occasion. In doing so, he has not only earned championships; he has earned hefty financial rewards reflective of his own future earnings in the game.Outside the realm of professional sports and especially baseball, the renowned name in baseball, Dave Roberts, has diversified his business enterprise through the appointment of his wife, Tricia Roberts. In 2025, the total net worth of the Roberts family is evidence that career successes and marriage-related financial ventures can mix to form financial prosperity balanced equally to that of the lineup formulated during the Dodgers’ games.The career path of Dave Roberts, from an MLB player to a championship-winning manager, has also been a steep financial upward climb. As of 2025, his current net worth is approximately $15 million, which includes income from his playing career, managerial income, commercial deals, and investments.Roberts recently extended his contract with the Dodgers in March 2025 for a term of four years and $32.4 million, which not only recognizes the innovative manager’s achievement but also ranks Roberts among the best-paid managers in baseball, with an average annual income of approximately $8.1 million.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.The Dodgers’ faith in Roberts is not a small change-up. Roberts-led Dodgers have charged into several World Series championships, including the ones in 2020 and 2024, and sport one of the highest winning percentages for a manager in the history of Major League Baseball. These championships not only adorn the trophy shelf but are also laced with performance bonuses, long-term job security in contract agreements, as well as opportunities for endorsement tours, all of which contribute significantly toward their off-the-field wealth.While Dave Roberts manages the pitching rotation, Dave's wife, Tricia Roberts, has found another niche altogether, away from baseball. Tricia and Dave dated in high school, married in 1997, and Tricia's expertise today is that of an interior designer with her own design company. But this isn’t all, since Tricia is also certified in wine, being a certified wine specialist, and also owns her own company, 'Red Stitch Wine,' along with her husband Dave and friends.As for Tricia’s individual net worth, it does not appear in the open literature; however, her ventures as a creative professional and as a shareholder of Red Stitch Wine add quite a bit to the Davies’ financial well-being. The overall 2025 net worth of Dave Davies’s wife, Tricia Davies, represents a combination of the Davies’ great wealth as a result of their excellent baseball performance, as well as their astuteness in their side ventures, along with the synergy displayed in their professional as well as their marital lives.Also Read: Kevin McGonigle contract details in 2025: What the Tigers prospect is earning in MLB today","As of 2025, Dave Roberts' current net worth is approximately $15 million, which includes income from his playing career, managerial income, commercial deals, and investments.

"Connor McDavid and Lauren Kyle’s combined net worth: Inside the NHL’s power couple career earnings, endorsement and more",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/connor-mcdavid-and-lauren-kyles-combined-net-worth-inside-the-nhls-power-couple-career-earnings-endorsement-and-more/articleshow/126452818.cms,"Inside Connor McDavid and Lauren Kyle’s growing wealth (Image via: Instagram)

A look at Connor McDavid and Lauren Kyle’s net worth, career earnings and endorsement



Connor McDavid’s on-ice resume barely needs framing anymore. The Edmonton Oilers captain has spent nearly a decade redefining what elite production looks like in the modern NHL. Beyond the career points and trophies, McDavid has made a name for himself that offers long-term security. Alongside his wife, Lauren Kyle, that evolution has taken shape as one of hockey’s most compelling off-ice partnerships.Kyle is not a background figure in McDavid’s success story. An established interior designer and entrepreneur, she has created a career independently. Together, their estimated $35 to $42 million net worth reflects two careers growing side by side, each adding value in its own way rather than leaning on the other.The largest driver of the couple’s wealth remains Connor McDavid’s NHL earnings. In October 2025, he signed a two-year, $25 million contract extension with the Oilers, ensuring his stay in Edmonton through the 2027–28 season. The deal, which takes effect from the next season, carries a $12.5 million average annual value and reinforces his position at the very top of the league’s salary structure. Combined with his original long-term agreement, McDavid’s total NHL earnings now comfortably exceed the $100 million mark.Off the ice, endorsements continue to play a meaningful role. McDavid’s deal with BodyArmor and Rogers as central to his endorsement work, which focuses on trust and long-term value instead of quick attention. He has always avoided flashy branding, and his sponsorships follow the same steady approach as his NHL contracts.Lauren Kyle’s contributions add a different dimension to the couple’s financial picture. Through Kyle & Co. Design Studio, she has developed a strong reputation in high-end interior design, most notably after the couple’s Edmonton home was featured in Architectural Digest. That exposure accelerated her transition from client-based design to brand-driven ventures.Kyle has since expanded into lifestyle and hospitality with Trove Living, Bar Trove, and Sports Club Atelier. While the highly anticipated Sports Club Atelier x Hockey Canada collection has been delayed, Kyle recently confirmed a new collection launch and emphasized that the collaboration remains in progress. According to her, the wait will be worth it, an approach consistent with her measured, quality-first business strategy.Their personal timeline mirrors that same deliberate pace Connor McDavid and Lauren Kyle first met in 2016 and were married on July 27, 2024, in a private ceremony held on Old Woman Island, a quiet, secluded place on Lake Muskoka in Ontario. They also picked the Muskoka region for both their engagement and wedding celebrations, keeping everything private and personal rather than making it a public event.As both continue to grow in their careers, their combined net worth is about more than money. It shows steady planning and two separate careers moving forward together, a balance that is still rare in top-level professional sports.Also Read: Connor McDavid and wife Lauren Kyle's love life: Inside Edmonton Oilers star's relationship timeline and personal journey","Connor McDavid and wife Lauren Kyle are estimated to be worth $35 to $42 million.

George Kittle injury sparks panic in San Francisco as tight end leaves Eagles game on a cart,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/george-kittle-injury-sparks-panic-in-san-francisco-as-tight-end-leaves-eagles-game-on-a-cart/articleshow/126473216.cms,"George Kittle Achilles Injury vs Eagles (Getty Images)

George Kittle injury sparks concern and questions across San Francisco



George Kittle stood at the center of a moment that instantly shifted the mood of a high-stakes playoff afternoon. The San Francisco 49ers tight end went down in Philadelphia, and the energy inside Lincoln Financial Field changed from ruthless noise to uneasy silence. In a season already defined by attrition, the sight of one of San Francisco’s emotional leaders being carted off felt heavy, personal, and unsettling for both sidelines.The play itself looked ordinary until it was not. One cut. One push. One sudden collapse. What followed was a reminder of how quickly football strips control from even its toughest stars. As Kittle clapped and saluted the crowd, the focus moved beyond the scoreboard and toward what his absence could mean for the game, the locker room, and a fan base already worn thin by injuries.George Kittle suffered the injury on his only catch of the day, a short completion from Brock Purdy that ended with Eagles safety Marcus Epps dragging him down. When Kittle tried to drive off his right leg, it gave way. He stayed on the turf, grabbing at his leg while trainers rushed out. Minutes later, the cart arrived, and the 49ers ruled him out for the rest of the game with an Achilles injury.Even in pain, Kittle stayed himself. He clapped. He saluted.The Philadelphia crowd, known for its hostility, responded with applause. That atmosphere is something Kittle has spoken about openly, once saying, “The one thing that’s really unique about Philly is that … any road team that goes in there, they hate all of us equally, and I just appreciate that,” before adding, “It’s incredibly loud, they flip you off, they moon you on the bus ride in, but they do that to anybody. … They just give you that no matter what, and I appreciate that because you can tell how much they love their team.”The injury cuts deeper because of Kittle’s season-long battle to stay on the field. He played just 11 games, missed time with ankle issues, and still produced 628 yards and seven touchdowns on 57 catches, earning his seventh Pro Bowl selection. That resilience is why the reaction has been so sharp.On social media, frustration quickly turned toward the organization’s training and medical operations. Fans are not just grieving a loss. They are questioning patterns. While injuries are part of football, losing cornerstone players week after week has left supporters searching for accountability.Now, everything hinges on medical evaluations and recovery timelines. An Achilles injury carries uncertainty, especially for a 32-year-old tight end who plays with relentless physicality. For the 49ers, the challenge is larger than replacing a stat line. It is about steadying a team, answering valid concerns, and finding a way forward without one of its toughest hearts on the field.Also Read: NFL Playoffs: Who will the Rams face next in divisional round after win vs. Panthers","George Kittle suffered the injury on his only catch of the day, a short completion from Brock Purdy that ended with Eagles safety Marcus Epps dragging him down.

After retiring from basketball in 2011, Shaquille O’Neal, also popularly known as Shaq, who is the former NBA star turned sports analyst, built a massive wealth in various sectors such as fast food chains, real estate, etc. Instead of staying in one lane, Shaquille O’Neal, aka “Shaq”, broadened his business ideas, which have led to his immense financial growth, leading him to become one of the NBA’s wealthiest individuals.Shaquille O'Neal has a current net worth of $500 million, as per Celebrity Net Worth. Shaquille O’Neal is a basketball legend, but he gained popularity not just for his on-court moments, but also off of it. Shaq appeared in popular ads for different companies. It is very well-known that Shaq has a very fun personality that makes him friendly around people, and this is why many popular brands work with him. From fast food chains to the world’s top tech companies, Shaq has worked with tons of brands promoting their products, which has led to the massive financial empire that he has today.Shaquille O'Neal once owned 10% of the 155 Five Guys, a burger chain, before selling the stake in 2016.Shaq then went over to focus on expanding his business ideas, and one such idea was the concept of fried chicken, the Big Chicken, which he launched in 2018. Thereafter, to promote his business to the mass population, Shaq launched the “Big Chicken Shaq”, a reality show, and eventually, the Big Chicken has grown to become one of the fastest-growing fast-food chains in the United States. After its massive success, Shaq began expanding it outside of America. In 2024, Shaq opened Big Chicken chains in Manchester, England. He named the items in the menu after some important people in his life, such as Charles Barkley, the former NBA legend.Shaquille O'Neal also bought a few stakes in Papa John's in 2019 and invested in nine stores in Atlanta, Georgia. A year later, he introduced the Shaq-a-Roni pizza in collaboration with Papa John's. Shaq-a-Roni pizza is a large family-sized cheesy pizza, and with each sale of that large cheesy pizza, it contributes around one dollar to the Papa John’s Foundation, helping young boys and girls get proper education and improving easier access to food.Shaquille O'Neal entered into a partnership with Reebok in 1992, just as he was drafted into the big league by the Orlando Magic in the 1992 draft. He then launched his sneaker, which is now his classic ""Shaq Attaq."" And almost 30 years later, he came back to the same brand in even a bigger way. In 2021, Shaq helped finalize a deal worth $2.4 billion to buy Reebok from Adidas.In 2013, Shaquille O'Neal bought a stake in the Sacramento Kings, the team with which he had a rivalry during his time with the Lakers. He joked about ironically calling them the ""Shaqramento Kings"", before selling his stakes in 2022, after he joined WynnBET, as the NBA doesn’t allow players or even coaches to partner directly with gambling companies.Shaquille O'Neal invested in Google for $0.25 million in 1999. He was introduced to this idea of investing in Google by a tech investor whom he once met in Los Angeles. At the time, Google was valued at around $100 million, however, that early investment later grew into one of its most successful financial moves. And since then, he has also invested in Apple, only expanding his wealth and affluence.Shaquille O’Neal endorsed and partnered with Pepsi in the 1990s, promoting their brand by appearing in advertisements for them. Back in 2023, Shaq appeared in the ""I Wish"" campaign in order to promote Mini Cans for Pepsi, which they had launched back then.Also Read: Magic Johnson and Cookie Johnson’s combined net worth in 2025: NBA power couple’s career earnings, endorsements, and more","Shaquille O'Neal, aka Shaq, is a former NBA star turned sports analyst.

Injury setbacks rock Bears’ playoff hopes



Bears turn to depth as pressure mounts

Also Read:

The Chicago Bears’ dramatic Wild Card win over the Green Bay Packers came at a heavy cost, with the franchise suffering a brutal injury setback that could define its playoff run. Linebacker T.J. Edwards and offensive tackle Ozzy Trapilo have both been ruled out for the remainder of the postseason.The Bears pulled off an emotional comeback at Soldier Field, keeping their Super Bowl hopes alive. However, the celebrations were short-lived once head coach Ben Johnson confirmed that both starters suffered season-ending injuries during the game.Edwards, a key leader in the middle of Chicago’s defense, went down in the third quarter. Medical evaluations later revealed a fractured fibula, an injury that immediately ended his postseason availability. Edwards had been one of the Bears’ most consistent performers all season, providing stability, communication, and physicality at linebacker.Trapilo’s injury followed late in the fourth quarter, delivering another tough blow. The young offensive tackle exited with a patellar tendon injury, which Johnson described as serious enough to rule him out for the rest of the playoffs.Trapilo had taken over the left tackle role late in the regular season and quickly became a crucial part of the offensive line rotation.With Edwards sidelined, the responsibility now shifts to D’Marco Jackson, who stepped in after the injury against Green Bay. Jackson has shown flashes when given extended snaps and even earned NFC Defensive Player of the Week honors earlier in the season. Still, replacing Edwards’ experience and on-field leadership will be a major challenge in a high-stakes playoff environment.On offense, Chicago must reshuffle its line to protect the quarterback against elite postseason defenses. Theo Benedet is expected to be the next man up at left tackle. The Bears also have Braxton Jones available after his return from injured reserve, but he has yet to see game action following a long absence, making his usage uncertain.Chicago’s playoff run has been built on resilience, physical defense, and timely execution. Losing two starters one on defense and one on offense tests that formula at the worst possible moment. While the Bears remain confident in their depth, there is no denying that Edwards and Trapilo leave significant gaps.As the Bears prepare for the divisional round, the focus now shifts from celebration to survival. January football rarely forgives injuries, and Chicago will need contributions from every corner of its roster to keep its postseason dream alive.","T.J.

He was quickly interrupted by SmackDown's newest star, Trick Williams. The former NXT star did not hesitate in getting in The Viper's face, which led to them almost coming to blows. However, Orton exited after taking down The Miz, who came out to get revenge on him from last week. Rey Fenix entered to compete in his scheduled match against Williams.Trick Williams displayed a great performance in his first WWE main roster match against top luchador, Rey Fenix. The duo produced an exciting match, that did not have a classic end, as Williams used some underhanded tactics to get the pinfall and his first victory as a SmackDown superstar.This was Giulia's first WWE Women's United States Championship defense against Alexa Bliss. While Giulia had Kiana James, Alexa's partner, Charlotte Flair was absent this week. A back-and-forthd forth contest ended with some interference from Lash Legend, who pushed Bliss off the top rope to let Giulia plant her with the Northern Lights powerbomb to retain her title.It was a highly explosive showdown between The Wyatt Sicks and MFTs in an eight-man tag team match. Both sides tore down each other with everything in their respective arsenals. In the final moments of the match, Solo Sikoa got hold off Uncle Howdy's latern.

Despite the veteran controlling most of the match, Hayes found the moment by hitting a jumping knee from the ropes. Melo then took down Nakamura with First 48 and finished him off with Nothing but Miss to retain his title.The first fall was a traditional wrestling match, where both Drew McIntyre and Cody Rhodes displayed an excellent showing. As the referee was taking care of an exposed turnbuckle, McIntyre hit a low blow and Claymore to Rhodes to win the first fall.

NEW DELHI: India batting great Virat Kohli on Sunday reflected on his illustrious career, calling it “nothing short of a dream come true” as he continues to bring joy to millions through the sport he loves.The 37-year-old added another landmark to his glittering resume during the first ODI against New Zealand, becoming the fastest batter to reach 28,000 international runs across formats. Kohli achieved the feat in his 624th innings, making him the quickest to the milestone and the second-highest run-scorer overall behind Sachin Tendulkar.Kohli reached the landmark with a boundary off New Zealand leg-spinner Adithya Ashok. Tendulkar had taken 644 innings to reach the mark, while Sri Lanka great Kumar Sangakkara, the only other member of the elite club, got there in 666 innings.""Honestly, if I look back at my whole journey, it's nothing short of a dream come true. I've always known my abilities, when I came in and I had to work for a lot more to get to the place I am today.""God has blessed me with way too much for me to complain about anything. So I feel nothing but gratitude.I always look back at my whole journey with a lot of grace and and a lot of gratitude in my heart and I feel I feel proud about it.""Named Player of the Match for the 45th time in his career, Kohli once again enjoyed overwhelming support from fans at the venue.""I feel grateful that I've been put in this position. It's a blessing to be honest. You can give so much happiness to so many people by just doing what you love to do, which is play the sport you've always loved as a child.""What what more can I ask for I'm literally living my dream and making people happy and see smiling faces.""Reflecting on his match-winning 93 off 91 balls, Kohli said he was not focused on personal milestones.""If I'm being brutally honest the way I'm playing right now, I'm not thinking about the milestones at all.""Honestly, if we were batting first today, I would have probably gone harder. Because there was a total on the board, I had to kind of buckle down and and play the situation. I was feeling like I want to hit more boundaries.""Asked about his more aggressive approach early in the innings in recent times, Kohli explained his mindset at the No. 3 position.""The basic idea is I batted at number three, so if the situation is a bit tricky, I backed myself to counter-attack now rather than just trying to play the situation in.""Because some ball has your name on it. So there's no point waiting around for too long But at the same time you don't play outrageous shots, you still stick to your strengths. But you back yourself enough to put the opposition on the back foot and that's exactly what happened today when I walked in.""I just felt like if I push hard now in the first 20 balls, then we can probably string in a partnership straight after a wicket like Rohit's Where the opposition is gonna go on the back foot and that actually ended up being the difference in the game.""Kohli also revealed that his trophies are sent to his mother in Gurgaon.""I send my awards to my mum, she's proud of them. Yeah, she likes keeping all the trophies,"" he said with a smile when asked if he needed a separate room for his accolades.During the chase, Kohli walked out to bat following the dismissal of Rohit Sharma , drawing a massive cheer from the crowd.Addressing the reaction, he admitted feeling uncomfortable about it.""I think it's like different timing happens at different games, I am not really aware of it.""I honestly don't feel good about it if I have to be honest. Same thing happens with MS. I've seen a lot as well. I don't think that it's a good feeling for the guy going out. So I do feel bad about it. I also understand the crowd, gets excited and they get happy.""So I guess it's part of the game and I try to just focus on what I need to do and not think so much before I go to bat.""India captain Shubman Gill was full of praise for Kohli’s current form.""It's tough to start on these pitches. Tough to replicate what he does. Hope he keeps piling on runs.""""Always feels great to chip in, especially when you're chasing. Staying in the present is most important, esp for athletes. That's what I try to do.""","Virat Kohli becomes the fastest batter to reach 28,000 international runs. Kohli achieved the feat in his 624th innings, making him the quickest to the milestone.

Bangladesh seek T20 WC match shift from India after Mustafizur Rahman's IPL exit

Poll Should the ICC accommodate Bangladesh's request to relocate matches? Yes, it's essential for safety. No, it's too logistically complex.

NEW DELHI: With just over three weeks to go before the start of the T20 World Cup, uncertainty continues to swirl around where Bangladesh will play its matches, as the International Cricket Council (ICC) and the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) remain locked in a tense impasse over venues. What began as a security-related concern has now evolved into a full-blown standoff, forcing the ICC and co-host BCCI to look for alternatives within India itself, even as Bangladesh pushes for a complete shift out of the country.The BCB has formally written to the ICC on more than one occasion, seeking to move all of Bangladesh’s scheduled fixtures from India to Sri Lanka, the tournament’s co-host. The board has cited player safety concerns amid political tensions between India and Bangladesh, and has maintained that it is unwilling to send its team to India under the current circumstances. However, as per a Cricbuzz report the ICC is reluctant to accommodate this demand, particularly given the logistical complexities of relocating matches so close to the February 7 tournament opener.The same Cricbuzz report indicated that instead of Sri Lanka, the ICC and BCCI are actively exploring alternative venues within India.The Tamil Nadu Cricket Association (TNCA) and Kerala Cricket Association (KCA) have been sounded out, with Chennai and Thiruvananthapuram emerging as potential replacement hosts for Bangladesh’s matches. While officials from both associations could not be reached immediately, it is learnt that they have conveyed their willingness to stage the games if required.Chepauk is already a confirmed World Cup venue and is scheduled to host seven matches, including a potential India–Australia Super 8 clash. TNCA officials have reportedly assured the ICC and BCCI that accommodating additional fixtures would not be an issue, given the availability of eight pitches at the venue.Under the existing schedule, Bangladesh are set to play West Indies on February 7, Italy on February 9 and England on February 14 in Kolkata, before travelling to Mumbai to face Nepal on February 17. However, those plans were thrown into doubt after the BCCI instructed IPL franchise Kolkata Knight Riders to release Bangladesh fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman. That decision triggered a chain reaction, with Bangladesh citing heightened security concerns, writing to the ICC for venue changes, and eventually banning the broadcast of the IPL — a first since the league’s inception in 2008.Adding another layer to the saga, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has reportedly also approached the ICC, offering to host Bangladesh’s matches if neither India nor Sri Lanka proves acceptable. According to a Geo News report, PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi has conveyed Pakistan’s readiness to step in, though no official confirmation has come from the ICC so far.For now, the ICC has yet to issue a formal response to the BCB, a step that could come as early as January 12. But with time running out and positions hardening, the Bangladesh venue question threatens to cast a long shadow over the build-up to one of cricket’s marquee global events.","Bangladesh seek T20 WC match shift from India after Mustafizur Rahman's IPL exit.

Wasim Akram, Nikhil Chopra on the evolution of UAE Cricket during ILT20 Season 4

NEW DELHI: Wasim Akram stole the show during the Pakistan Super League ’s franchise auction on Thursday, turning the high-stakes bidding war into a moment of levity with his trademark wit.As the PSL officially added two new teams ahead of the 2026 season, Akram — who conducted the auction — kept the atmosphere light even as millions were at stake. At one point, spotting a hesitant bidder, the Pakistan great quipped: ""Balance toh khatam nahi ho gaya?"", drawing laughter from those present. Several journalists and social media users later identified the potential bidder as representatives of Jazz, Pakistan’s leading telecom service provider, who ultimately did not place a bid.The auction concluded with two successful bids, expanding the PSL to eight teams. OZ Developers, a real estate consortium, secured the Sialkot franchise for Rs 1.85 billion ($6.55 million/INR 58.38 crore), while US-based FKS Group won the Hyderabad team for Rs 1.75 billion ($6.2 million/INR 55.57 crore). Overall, the two franchises fetched $12.75 million (approximately INR 114 crore).The new teams will join the league when the next season begins on March 26.Multan Sultans, meanwhile, will be operated by the Pakistan Cricket Board for the upcoming season before being put up for sale after the PSL concludes in April.Former owner Ali Tareen, who had public differences with the PSL management, was eligible to bid but pulled out at the last moment from a pool of 10 approved bidders.Akram’s presence at the auction came amid recent debate sparked by his comments on league durations. Speaking at a PSL promotional event, the former fast bowler praised the league’s shorter window and took a swipe at longer tournaments.""The best thing about the league is that it is played for only about 34-35 days, maybe a little more next year. It's not like three months, like the other league. Bacchey bade ho jate hain, woh league khatam hi nahi hoti. Foreign players, when they come to Pakistan, prefer to be here for 35-40 days. More than that - two-and-a-half to three months - is a bit too long for everyone. Even I get bored,"" Akram said.He also cited Australia’s Big Bash League as an example of why shorter leagues work better.""Prime example is the BBL. They started off with two-and-a-half months. They realised after four or five years it wasn't working. Now their duration is about 40 days. That's it. That's the beauty of the PSL. Of course, the talent. Everybody overseas, when I talk to them, they talk about bowling in the IPL and other leagues. They say the PSL, as far as talent is concerned, is definitely No. 1 because we have quality, not quantity,"" he added.Akram’s comments triggered mixed reactions online, with many fans criticising the comparison — particularly given his long association with the Indian Premier League as both a coach and commentator.","Wasim Akram steals the show during the Pakistan Super League's franchise auction. The Pakistan great quipped: ""Balance toh khatam nahi ho gaya?"", drawing laughter from those present. The auction concluded with two successful bids, expanding the PSL to eight teams.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126446892,imgsize-30462,width-400,resizemode-4/wasim-akram-1001afp.jpg"
Dana White drops bold verdict on UFC’s greatest rivalry and it’s not Khabib Nurmagomedov vs Conor McGregor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/international-sports/dana-white-drops-bold-verdict-on-ufcs-greatest-rivalry-and-its-not-khabib-nurmagomedov-vs-conor-mcgregor/articleshow/126443145.cms,"Dana White (Image Via Getty)

Dana White says Jon Jones and Daniel Cormier rivalry tops all others

Dana White has seen almost every big fight in UFC history. From wild press conferences to sold-out arenas, the UFC CEO has watched rivalries grow, explode, and change the sport. But when he was recently asked to name the greatest UFC rivalry ever, Dana White did not pick the famous feud between Khabib Nurmagomedov and Conor McGregor.Instead, Dana White said the rivalry that stands above all others is Jon Jones vs Daniel Cormier. He shared his thoughts while talking about past UFC moments, pointing to their long history of tension, real anger, and unforgettable scenes both inside and outside the cage.During a recent media conversation in the United States, Dana White was asked which rivalry meant the most to him as UFC president. His answer was quick and clear.“It would absolutely be those two,” Dana White said, speaking about Jon Jones and Daniel Cormier. Their rivalry began long before they ever touched gloves.They argued in interviews, exchanged sharp words at press events, and even had a heated moment at a hotel in Las Vegas that became one of the most replayed clips in UFC history.Their first fight happened at UFC 182 in January 2015, where Jon Jones beat Daniel Cormier by decision after five tough rounds.Two years later, they met again at UFC 214 in July 2017, where Daniel Cormier was knocked out. That result was later changed to a no-contest after a failed test.Dana White said moments like those are why their rivalry still stands out. “When you are there, you are not there for pictures,” Dana White explained.“You are there to make sure they do not touch. Once someone feels disrespected, things can move fast.”White made it clear that the emotion between Jon Jones and Daniel Cormier was always real, not forced. Even years after their last UFC fight, the rivalry is still alive.In late 2025, Jon Jones and Daniel Cormier appeared on a Russian reality television show, where old feelings came back.During filming, the two were seen arguing again. Daniel Cormier later claimed they even talked about the idea of a third match, possibly in wrestling or boxing.After the show, Jon Jones spoke publicly about the experience. He said he once hoped to fix things between them. But now, he feels their relationship may never change.Jon Jones explained that while there were small moments where they laughed, most of the time the tension stayed.He added that the rivalry has followed them for years and still feels personal. Fans reacted quickly online. Many said Dana White’s comments made sense.While Khabib Nurmagomedov vs Conor McGregor created huge global attention and led to chaos at UFC 229 in October 2018, some believe Jon Jones vs Daniel Cormier had a deeper, longer-lasting story.With both fighters now away from full-time competition, their feud remains one of the most talked-about in UFC history.And for Dana White, no rivalry has ever matched what Jon Jones and Daniel Cormier brought to the sport.Also Read: Ilia Topuria Speaks Out After Court Hearing And Gives Hopeful Update On Daughter With Giorgina Uzcategui Badell",Dana White says Jon Jones and Daniel Cormier rivalry tops all others.

Why the Chiefs fear losing Travis Kelce for reasons that have nothing to do with football,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/why-the-chiefs-fear-losing-travis-kelce-for-reasons-that-have-nothing-to-do-with-football/articleshow/126443155.cms,"(Getty Images)

Andy Reid and teammates say Travis Kelce’s energy has always been real

With Travis Kelce openly weighing retirement, the conversation around his future in Kansas City has shifted. It’s no longer just about what he can still do on the field. According to multiple Chiefs players and coaches speaking recently, Kelce’s importance to the franchise runs much deeper, rooted in the behind-the-scenes leadership that has defined his 13 seasons in Kansas City.Chiefs head coach Andy Reid has often described Kelce’s personality as big and expressive, once joking that he was a “wild pony” early in his career. But that energy, teammates say, has never faded or been performative.Defensive tackle Chris Jones recalled how Kelce set the tone at practice when Jones entered the league in 2016, dancing between reps and catching everything thrown his way. Jones said that energy was contagious and pushed others to match it, even in routine practices.One of the strongest examples of Kelce’s off-field impact comes from running back Clyde Edwards-Helaire, who has spoken openly about dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder related to gun violence earlier in his life.Edwards-Helaire said Kelce was one of the few teammates who consistently noticed when something was off and checked in with him during difficult moments. He described Kelce as someone who paid attention when others didn’t, not as a star player but as a trusted presence in the locker room.Kelce’s reach inside the Chiefs organization extends far beyond stars. Center Creed Humphrey credited him with carrying the cultural torch inside the locker room, while reserve linebacker Cole Christiansen shared how Kelce went out of his way to make him feel valued when he was named a game captain.Defensive lineman Malik Herring, who spent much of his rookie season rehabbing a torn ACL as an undrafted free agent, said Kelce regularly checked on him during rehab. Herring explained that attention from a franchise cornerstone helped him believe he belonged in the NFL.Kelce’s influence has also crossed team lines. Tight end Robert Tonyan previously said Kelce reached out to him with encouragement during a breakout season in Green Bay, a rare gesture in a league where competition often outweighs connection. Tonyan later joined the Chiefs and described Kelce as the same person off the field as he appears on it.When Kelce eventually steps away, Kansas City won’t just be replacing a tight end. Players and coaches have made it clear they’ll be losing a connector, someone who bridged position groups, experience levels, and personalities.His production can be measured. His presence cannot.Also read - Rashee Rice and Rubi Rose spark dating rumors after being spotted together at the gym","Travis Kelce is weighing his future with the Kansas City Chiefs.

How Boston Celtics Are Playing Without Jayson Tatum

Toronto’s Injury Concerns

Game Time and Outlook

when theface the Toronto Raptors on. The Celtics forward remains out as he continues to recover from an Achilles injury that has kept him off the floor for most of the season.There was no expectation of a return for this game, and Boston has confirmed his status as out. The team has adjusted to life without its top scorer and will rely on the same rotation that has carried them through recent weeks.Jayson Tatum suffered a torn Achilles during last season’s playoffs and underwent surgery in May 2025. Recovery from this type of injury usually takes nine to twelve months. That timeline puts any possible return closer to late March 2026, and even that remains uncertain.For Friday night at TD Garden, Tatum is unavailable. Josh Minott will also miss the game due to an ankle injury, further thinning Boston’s depth.Boston Celtics have stayed competitive despite losing its main offensive option. Jaylen Brown has taken over as the focal point and is averaging a career-high 30 points per game.The roster looks different after offseason trades involving Kristaps Porzingis and Jrue Holiday, but the current group has found consistency.The expected starting lineup includes Payton Pritchard, Derrick White, Brown, Sam Hauser, and Neemias Queta. The group has played with balance and has performed better than many expected before the season.Toronto enters the game with issues of its own. Jakob Poeltl is out with a back problem. Scottie Barnes is dealing with a knee injury, while Brandon Ingram is questionable because of a thumb issue.RJ Barrett is expected to lead the offense after a recent game against Charlotte, though he will face pressure from Boston’s perimeter defenders throughout the night.The game is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. ET and will air on Sportsnet.

Read David Ellison's full memo to employees here:

Team Paramount,

As we wrap up our first week back together in our LA and NY offices, I want to thank each of you for your dedication, professionalism, and teamwork. I know that returning to the office full-time has been an adjustment for many, and I truly appreciate the flexibility and commitment you've shown.

The positive energy and increased productivity that come from being together in-person are already evident, and it's great to see.

A special thank you to our RTO Task Force and all the teams involved for their hard work behind the scenes to prepare for our return and to ensure the transition was smooth and welcoming for everyone.

It's hard to believe we launched the new Paramount just five months ago, and in that short time we haven't just set a strategy — we've acted on it.

In the process, we've made real and meaningful progress against our North Star priorities. From day one, our goal has been clear: to transform Paramount for the future by championing great storytellers, investing in world-class technology, and making bold, thoughtful moves that position us to help define the next era of entertainment.

That's exactly what we've been doing — and it's what we'll continue to do together.

While the coming year will bring its share of challenges, it will also be exciting. We've set ambitious goals, and we're confident we have the strategy, the momentum, and — most importantly — the team to achieve them. Your expertise, resilience, and commitment give me tremendous confidence in what we can accomplish. I am grateful for your efforts and incredibly proud to work alongside you.

Thanks again for a great first week back together. Let's go!

Best,

David

Sourav Ganguly on coaching in SA20, India’s World Cup chances and more

Poll Do you believe Sri Lanka's batting concerns have been resolved ahead of the T20 World Cup? Yes, definitely! No, they still need improvement!

Sri Lanka eased lingering doubts over their batting by grinding out a hard-fought 14-run victory over Pakistan in the third T20I at a rain-hit Dambulla on Sunday, squaring the three-match series 1-1 and gaining timely momentum ahead of the T20 World Cup.The series, serving as a warm-up for the global tournament, has carried added significance for Pakistan, who will play all their World Cup matches in Sri Lanka due to ongoing political tensions with neighbours India. Pakistan won the opening match by six wickets before rain washed out the second encounter, setting up a decider shortened to 12 overs per side.Asked to bat, Sri Lanka responded with purpose after being bowled out cheaply in the series opener. The hosts piled up a competitive 160, with contributions flowing through the order. Wicketkeeper Kusal Mendis set the tone in the Powerplay with a brisk 30 off 16 balls, while Dhananjaya de Silva (22 off 15) and Charith Asalanka (21 off 13) ensured the momentum did not dip.Captain Dasun Shanaka then provided the decisive surge, smashing 34 off just nine deliveries, including five towering sixes. His sixth-wicket partnership with Janith Liyanage yielded 52 runs in a mere 15 balls and proved to be the turning point of the contest.Pakistan’s reply began explosively, with skipper Salman Agha racing to 45 off just 12 balls as the visitors surged to 50 in 19 deliveries. However, once the field spread and the wet ball became harder to control, Sri Lanka’s bowlers tightened the noose. Wanindu Hasaranga led the charge superbly, claiming four wickets to complete 150 T20I scalps and earning both Player of the Match and Player of the Series honours. Pakistan were restricted to 146 for 8, falling 14 runs short.“We were a bit worried about our batting and I’m glad we addressed that today,” Hasaranga said. “The ball was wet and it wasn’t easy. We tried to bowl wide and slow and asked them to take risks.”Agha acknowledged the learning curve for his side, saying, “We conceded too many runs, but our batting effort was good. Playing in these conditions is important with the World Cup coming up.”","Sri Lanka beat Pakistan by 14 runs in the third T20I at a rain-hit Dambulla. The win sees Sri Lanka level the three-match series 1-1 ahead of the T20 World Cup.

Beer can allegations and viral bar response spark backlash

Philadelphia stepped into the Wild Card weekend expecting chaos. That part was never in doubt. What the Eagles did not expect was for their fan base to become the story again on January 11, 2026, during the playoff clash against the San Francisco 49ers at Lincoln Financial Field.As kickoff approached, the conversation around the matchup slowly shifted. Instead of matchups and injuries, social media is filled with videos and screenshots. On Sunday night, Eagles fans were back under national scrutiny, reopening a debate that has followed Philadelphia for years. The allegations spread quickly and carried familiar weight. For a fan base known for intensity, the line between passion and perception once again became the focus.The first wave of criticism surfaced on Sunday, January 11. Videos and firsthand accounts circulating online alleged that Eagles fans threw beer cans at 49ers supporters as they entered Lincoln Financial Field. The footage gained traction across X and Instagram within hours. As of now, no official police statement has confirmed the claims, but the images alone have drawn criticism from fans and analysts across the league.That controversy followed an earlier episode that had already heightened tensions between the two fan bases. On January 8, a Philadelphia sports bar, Ladder 15, shared a screenshot on Instagram of an email it sent to a 49ers fan group requesting space for nearly 200 visiting fans before the game.“After very little consideration, we cannot in good conscience host anything that has to do with the 49ers,” the email read. “We’re Birds fans till the end. We bleed green.” What the bar intended as lighthearted loyalty quickly escalated. The post went viral and was discussed on the January 9 episode of the “Pardon My Take” podcast, pushing the exchange into the national spotlight.For Eagles fans, the backlash struck a familiar nerve. Philadelphia’s supporters have long embraced a reputation for being loud and confrontational, especially during the playoffs. Critics argue incidents like these cross a line and reinforce a negative image that resurfaces every January. Supporters counter that home-field intensity is part of what makes Lincoln Financial Field one of the toughest venues in the NFL. The situation further intensified the reaction. With playoff pressure already high, the off-field narratives overshadowed the buildup to a marquee Wild Card matchup.As the Phillies continue their 2025 postseason run, the debate surrounding their fan culture remains unresolved. Philadelphia’s energy still fuels the team. Whether this moment becomes another footnote or a turning point will depend on what comes next, both inside the stadium and beyond it.Also Read: 49ers shatter Eagles’ Super Bowl repeat dreams with ruthless wild-card win that flips the NFC playoff picture",Eagles fans face renewed scrutiny as Wild Card incidents revive “worst fans” label.

""Speed Does Africa""

White Speed shows up in Kenya despite warnings from Speed’s team





IShowSpeed was once again stunned and confused during his Africa tour when a familiar face appeared unexpectedly. A viral clip from his Kenya livestream shows the popular streamer clearly at a loss for words after seeing White Speed, the well-known stream sniper, appear despite earlier warnings from management. The moment went viral across social media as fans reacted to Speed's dumbfounded expression and awkward silence. The incident occurred on January 11, 2026, during Speed's visit to Kenya, where hordes of people flocked to witness him streaming in public.The Kenya stream was part of the widely followedtour by IShowSpeed, which has already drawn huge attention across multiple countries. His Nairobi livestream attracted over 200,000 live viewers and even caused traffic disruptions as fans filled the streets. While the tour has been praised for its energy and fan engagement, the unexpected return of White Speed added a chaotic twist. Speed's team had previously warned the stream sniper to stop following him, making the Kenya appearance all that more surprising.White Speed, also known online as Gooonki or Tiki Wackowski, first caught attention during Speed’s South Africa streams. He is known for closely copying Speed’s behavior, outfits, and expressions, often appearing suddenly in public streams.According to past clips, White Speed has claimed that he spent all his money traveling just to follow Speed across locations. His actions have divided viewers, with some finding the situation funny and others calling it concerning.In the Kenya stream, Speed’s reaction portrayed him as being uncertain about what to do with the situation. Speed was told to steer clear of White Speed, just like in the past occurrences that triggered the security team to intervene. In the past, there was one instance that involved White Speed hanging on top of a building in South Africa. In the Kenya experience, Speed did not get involved with White Speed.Despite the disruption, the audience was still caught up in the unpredictability of Speed’s live streaming. While some laughed at the level at which White Speed had escalated, others showed support for Speed’s side for attempting to maintain the parameters. This video also contributed to the experience of live streaming on public platforms, especially when the live streamer’s actions can be so easily followed.As IShowSpeed continues his journey in Africa, the Kenya event is a reminder of the dangers that may be involved in these public streams. As for whether White Speed will make an appearance, that remains uncertain. For now, the event continues Speed’s long journey that has included some entertaining moments in Africa.Also Read: MrBeast celebrates Beast Games season 2 hitting #1 in the USA","White Speed, the well-known stream sniper, appeared unexpectedly during IShowSpeed's Africa tour.
