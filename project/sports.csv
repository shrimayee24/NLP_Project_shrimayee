"'Legend' Virat Kohli should not be compared to any cricketer, let alone Babar Azam: Ahmad Shahzad",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/legend-virat-kohli-should-not-be-compared-to-any-cricketer-let-alone-babar-azam-ahmad-shahzad/articleshow/111421172.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Indian cricket team was lauded all over the world by winning the T20 World Cup title.In a thrilling final, Rohit Sharma and his men edged out South Africa by 7 runs at Barbados on Saturday.Virat Kohli proved his big-match credentials, with his 59-ball 76 in the final clash -- after he managed just 75 runs in seven innings during the competition until the finale and was named the man of the match.Lauding the Indian cricket star, former Pakistan cricketer Ahmad Shahzad said that India would have never won the T20 World Cup final without Virat Kohli's innings, adding that no one should compare Babar Azam or any other cricketer to the former Indian captain.In a viral video, Shahzad says, ""Virat Kohli is a legend of our generation and he is leaving behind a legacy in T20I cricket. He has always played his cricket with enthusiasm. Even in his last match, someone else was taking wickets and he was celebrating at long-on, long-off.""Shahzad adds, ""He didn't score runs in the whole World Cup but as destiny would have it, he scored runs in the final when one else scored and had Virat not scored in that final, India wouldn't have won. I think he's leaving a big legacy behind for the Indian team, for the rest of the world. It won't be easy for India to fill in the shoes of Virat Kohli in any format. Good luck to Indian cricket team to fit his shoes.""When asked about the comparisons between Virat and Babar Azam and sometimes even himself, Shahzad said, ""There is no one like Virat Kohli, let alone me, let alone anybody else. People even compare him with Babar Azam. He should not be compared to anyone. He has an amazing strike rate and average in ICC tournaments. So he shouldn't be compared to anyone. He's one and only Virat Kohli, he got the send-off that he deserved. I am happy as a cricketer that Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma got the send-offs that they both deserved.""Kohli bowed out in the shortest international format with 4,188 runs in 125 matches including one century and 38 half tons since his debut in 2010.Virat amassed 1,292 runs at an average of 58.72 and a strike rate of 128.81 in 35 T20 World Cup games, including 15 half-centuries. He is the highest run-getter in the history of the tournament with an unbeaten 89 as his highest score.",Former Pakistan cricketer Ahmad Shahzad says Virat Kohli is a legend of his generation. He says India would have never won the T20 World Cup without Kohli's innings.

Six Indians in ICC T20 World Cup 'Team of the Tournament'; Virat Kohli misses out,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/six-indians-in-icc-t20-world-cup-team-of-the-tournament-virat-kohli-misses-out/articleshow/111393688.cms,"ICC Team of The Tournament

12th man:

NEW DELHI: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has announced its ' Team of the Tournament ' for the recently concluded T20 World Cup. Despite playing a key role in India's victory over South Africa in the final, star batter Virat Kohli did not find a place in this select squad.India clinched their second T20 World Cup title, defeating South Africa by seven runs in a thrilling climax.Kohli, who was promoted to opener for the tournament, had a relatively quiet World Cup until the grand finale, where he produced a match-winning knock of 76 runs off 59 balls and was named the player of the match. Despite his heroics, Kohli was omitted from the ICC XI.The ICC’s lineup featured six Indian players, reflecting their strong overall performance. Indian skipper Rohit Sharma , Suryakumar Yadav, Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Jasprit Bumrah , and Arshdeep Singh were all included. Rohit led from the front, amassing 257 runs at an impressive strike rate of 156.7, making him the second-highest run-scorer behind Afghanistan's Rahmanullah Gurbaz.One of the standout performers, Jasprit Bumrah, was named Player of the Tournament. Bumrah took 15 wickets and more importantly, his ability to restrict the scoring rate made him India's trump card. His economy rate of 4.17 was the best recorded by a bowler in a single edition of the men's T20 World Cup.Following a historic semi-final finish, PTI has reported that Afghanistan had three players making it to the ICC team. Left-arm quick Fazalhaq Farooqi topped the wicket-taking charts alongside India’s Arshdeep Singh with 17 wickets each. Wicketkeeper-batter Rahmanullah Gurbaz, who led the run charts with 281 runs, and captain Rashid Khan were the other inclusions from Afghanistan.Skipper Rashid Khan led Afghanistan brilliantly, claiming 14 wickets at an economy of 6.17, showcasing his prowess as both a leader and a player.Australian all-rounder Marcus Stoinis and West Indies’ Nicholas Pooran rounded out the XI, bringing additional balance to the team.South Africa, despite being the runners-up, did not have a player in the XI. However, pacer Anrich Nortje was named the 12th man.Overall, the ICC's 'Team of the Tournament' reflects a mix of individual brilliance and consistent performance across the event, highlighting the standout players who made a significant impact.Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav, Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Jasprit Bumrah, Arshdeep Singh (all Indians); Rahmanullah Gurbaz, Rashid Khan, Fazalhaq Farooqi (Afghanistan); Marcus Stoinis (Australia) and Nicholas Pooran (West Indies);Anrich Nortje.","The International Cricket Council (ICC) has announced its'Team of the Tournament'for the recently concluded T20 World Cup.

Ending an over-a-decade long ICC title drought, Rohit Sharma last week etched his name in history books, becoming only the second Indian captain after legendary MS Dhoni to lift the T20 World Cup title.As Rohit's men beat South Africa in a thrilling finale on Saturday at the Kensington Oval in Barbados, India laid hands at the T20 World Cup title after 17 years.With the title triumph, Rohit joined an elite group of captains to secure a T20 World Cup title.The win marked India's first ICC trophy in 11 years. The last time the Indian cricket team celebrated such a triumph was in 2013, under the leadership of Dhoni, when they secured the Champions Trophy.Previously, England and West Indies were the only teams to have won the T20 World Cup title twice. With the win on Saturday, India became the third team to achieve the distinction, solidifying their status among elites in T20 cricket.","Rohit Sharma became only the second Indian captain after legendary MS Dhoni to lift the T20 World Cup title.

WWE Money in the Bank 2024: Predictions for Seth Rollins vs Damian Priest World Title Match,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/wwe/top-stories/wwe-money-in-the-bank-2024-predictions-for-seth-rollins-vs-damian-priest-world-title-match/articleshow/111412006.cms,"WWE Money in the Bank 2024 could witness Seth Rollins' new rise at the cost of Damian Priest

The contest between Seth Rollins and Damian Priest , scheduled at the WWE Money in the Bank 2024 , could well become the discussion point for the entire community. After all, it's not just an ordinary title match, as there's more at stake. Rollins and Priest have a ""gentleman's agreement"" between them, and it could undoubtedly have a significant effect on the outcome of the clash.When required, Damian Priest managed to stand tall and apart from the remaining members of Judgment Day.He might be carrying the World Heavyweight Championship on his shoulders, but Seth Rollins is a different personality altogether. With due respect to Priest, Rollins is on another level when it comes to resonating with the audience.Most fans believe that bigger things await Rollins, and that could all begin with the upcoming contest during the WWE Money in the Bank 2024. Priest will face The Visionary in what will be a fight for the World Heavyweight championship.However, there's more at stake, all thanks to the gentleman's agreement the two superstars have between them. If Rollins loses the fight, he won't even challenge for the Heavyweight Title as long as Priest has his hands on it. However, Priest will have to leave the Judgment Day if he loses the fight.There's a general feeling that Priest might have outgrown Judgment Day. WWE Money in the Bank 2024 is the perfect chance to ensure that Priest goes the separate way from his current crib, which means that Rollins will win the contest in the future (a speculation, of course). However, Rollins winning the match might not automatically mean that he would get back his cherished title belt.There's a high chance that Judgment Day might intervene during the match (something that has become a common occurrence in recent weeks). Of course, their supposed attempt to help Priest might become the biggest reason for the superstar's departure. This is, of course, if Priest sticks to his agreement with Rollins.This sets up for an exciting outcome - Rollins wins the match, so he gets to challenge Priest in the future (who keeps the title as the WWE Money in the Bank 2024 contest ends in DQ). But Priest will no longer have the backing of Judgment Day, and then enters the third party - Gunther.Gunther's character transformation has been amazing, to say the least - a rise, a fall, and then a rise again. The Ring General was quick to send out the reminder that maybe the better person between Rollins and Priest would win to face him at Summerslam .If the WWE Money in the Bank 2024 contest between Rollins and Priest goes as predicted here, this could set up an eye-grabbing title fight at Summerslam. Instead of Gunther fighting any one of Rollins and Priest, he gets to fight both. That way, the audience gets a triple threat fight for the World Heavyweight Championship, where all three wrestlers have some agendas to fill.Of course, only WWE knows what they want to do with the WWE Money in the Bank 2024 fight, and the outcomes mentioned here are predictions. But fans will hope that the upcoming contest will be spicy, which will be wholly justified given the wrestlers and the stakes involved.","WWE Money in the Bank 2024 could witness Seth Rollins' new rise at the cost of Damian Priest.

Will NXT Heatwave spell the end of Je’Von and Williams’ friendship?

Je’Von Evans, Trick Williams , Ethan Page , and Shawn Spears were all sitting down in the ring this past night. The four gathered to sign the contract for their Fatal four-way championship match set to take place during the NXT Heatwave showdown airing on July 7, 2024. This gives us less than a week to see these four stars going at it for the NXT title.However, Je’Von and Williams have already given us a glimpse of what’s to come this Sunday. As it often does, the ring got heated while these four were arguing and penning down their names on the contract. In the end, a brawl broke out, and Je’Von and Trick Williams made short work of the other two competitors. Let’s take a look at the events that led to their brawl in the ring.Everything started off normally, with Williams maintaining his usual energy. The NXT Champ mentioned that the fans will all chant ""Whoop That Trick"" during his match next week. Ethan Page was then quick to remind the champ that Heatwave won’t be the same experience as the one he had at Battleground. Three weeks ago, Williams took Evans out at Battleground to retain his NXT Championship belt.After Page’s comments, Shawn Spears chimed in and mentioned that Trick Williams’ emotions ended up costing him their match last week and will cost him the NXT championship at Heatwave. 21-year-old Je’Von Evans got involved, and an argument broke out between him and Shawn Page.Things began after Page compared the Young OG, to a sports team that is just happy to participate because they can’t win. On that note, Evans rebutted and asked Page to tell him how much experience he has as anNXT champion . The 21-year-old also claimed that he'd be winning the title this Sunday.Immediately afterward, Page asked Williams what he thought about Evans’ statement. It was almost as if Shawn was trying to create some separation between the two before he took them on in the upcoming Fatal four-way match. However, Williams didn’t get provoked and said it'd be every man for himself this Sunday.Finally, an argument broke out between Shawn, Page, and Evans. Things escalated, and a brawl broke out. Shawn tried his best to put Je’Von out of commission, while Page started throwing punches at the NXT champion. However, Williams proved to be too much for him and slammed him through the table. On the other hand, Evans also power-bombed Shawn through a table, and the stage is now set for NXT Heatwave.Right after the brawl ended, Evans went to pick up the Championship belt. However, Williams quickly swooped in and stared at his friend, Je’Von with malicious intent. This could be the beginning of the end of their friendship.It might not sit well with Trick Williams if he ends up losing his title to a 21-year-old who has just burst onto the scene. It’ll be interesting to see who walks out of NXT Heatwave with the Championship belt.","Je’Von Evans, Trick Williams, Ethan Page, and Shawn Spears were all sitting down in the ring this past night.

He seemed set for victory with a 5-2, 30-0 lead in the third set and a double break, but struggled to close out the match twice when serving for it.Ruud capitalized on this and dominated the tiebreak to push the match into a fourth set. However, Fognini regained control, breaking serve for a 5-3 lead. Despite missing three match points and appearing to tighten up, he finally secured the win on the fourth attempt with a forehand winner.""Maybe 14 is the lucky one,"" Fognini said on court. ""I was 5-2 up and the match was almost done but then at 5-4 too many things were coming into my head.""But this is why I love and hate this sport.

I think it's such a privilege and a pleasure to work with each of you but also to Ro, thanks for the time. I know as a captain and a coach there's a lot of time we have to chat, we have to discuss, we have to agree, we have to disagree at times. But thank you so very much. I think it's brilliant to know each of you as a person.It's your moment, guys, remember it. It's not about any individual, it's about a team.

However, skipper Ben Stokes encouraged his team to strive for a higher purpose -- to become the side that will forever be etched in people's memories.The England and Wales Cricket Board recently released a three-part documentary series titled 'Ashes 2023 | Our Take,' which sheds light on Stokes' thought process during pivotal moments of the closely contested 2023 Ashes.Following the drawn fourth Test in Manchester last July, which was marred by rain and resulted in Australia retaining the urn, Stokes delivered an impassioned speech to his crestfallen teammates.""Everything we've done up until now isn't going to stop because we haven't managed to win the urn back. The reward for our work isn't what we get but what we become,"" said Stokes who, with head coach Brendon McCullum , has pioneered the 'Bazball' philosophy.""And what we have managed to do is we've managed to become a sports team that will live forever in the memory of people who were lucky enough to witness us play cricket,"" said Stokes, according to cricket.com.au.""I know it's going to be a bit flat, it's going to hurt that we go into the next game (at The Oval) not being able to get the urn back. But what we have done is something a lot bigger than any Ashes trophy could ever signify for this team – be the team that everybody will always remember.""Under the guidance of McCullum and Stokes over the past two years, the England cricket team has achieved an impressive record. They have secured victories in 14 Test matches, while suffering defeats in eight and settling for a draw in one.""Any decision I make will never be based on 'well, we're definitely not going to lose if we make this one, so I'll go with it',"" Stokes said, as quoted by PTI, in the documentary.""It will always be about what's going to give us the best opportunity to win a game.""Stokes' predecessor Joe Root expressed a more balanced perspective regarding the national cricket team. Root's assessment of England's performance and potential differed from Stokes' view.""I don't think anyone thinks we're something we're not. We're not trying to say that we're the best team in the world,"" Root said in the final episode of the documentary.""One of the sayings that comes out of the dressing room ... is teams might be better than us, but they won't be braver than us.""And it's a great way to play the game,"" said Root.",England captain Ben Stokes urges his team to strive for a higher purpose.

He admitted that his initial intention was to prevent a boundary, and he acknowledged the role of fielding coach T Dilip in that pivotal moment which ultimately led to India's World Cup victory.Throughout the tournament, Suryakumar made significant contributions with the bat, amassing 199 runs in eight matches at an average of 28.42.His performances included two half-centuries and other valuable innings in challenging situations. Additionally, he showcased his exceptional fielding skills by taking several remarkable catches during the World Cup.In the final over of the match, with South Africa requiring 16 runs from the last six deliveries, Miller, renowned for his ability to deliver match-winning performances under pressure, attempted a powerful shot.Suryakumar showcased his exceptional fielding skills near the boundary line. He managed to grab the ball, but his momentum carried him over the boundary. With great presence of mind, he tossed the ball up in the air, crossed the boundary, and swiftly returned to the field of play. He then calmly completed the catch, displaying his agility and quick thinking.This extraordinary feat by Suryakumar proved to be a game-changer, swinging the momentum in India's favor. The dismissal of the South African batter for 21 runs dealt a significant blow to their chances of victory. Ultimately, the Indian team emerged triumphant, securing their second ICC T20 World Cup title by a narrow margin of seven runs.Speaking to Revsportz, as quoted by ANI, Suryakumar said, ""When I started running I was not thinking of the catch. I was running with every iota of strength in my legs to make sure I somehow saved the boundary. I wanted to throw the ball back in and save two or three runs at least for the team. And honestly, I was not thinking of the catch. When I reached the ball and it came into my hands I realised there was an opportunity for me to take the catch and toss the ball up. I felt I could go out and come back in to complete that catch. I had 5-7 seconds to make that call and let me say to you I will forever remember these 5-7 seconds in my life. I made the call and it worked out for us.""Suryakumar admitted that he felt the pressure to successfully execute the catch, stating, it would be a lie to say that he was not. However, he emphasized that the team had put in significant effort to improve their fielding skills under the guidance of T Dilip, the fielding coach.During their training sessions, the players had diligently practiced taking at least 150 catches similar to the one Suryakumar encountered in the match. This extensive preparation aimed to enhance their ability to handle high-pressure situations on the field.""He has worked very hard with us and each one of us have taken out 15 mins during practice to train with him. As batters, we can contribute only in one department and often fielding goes unnoticed. But here each one of us have trained separately and the results are showing. The catch, I will say, is a product of the work we have put in,"" he concluded.","Suryakumar Yadav discussed his crucial catch that dismissed David Miller in the T20 World Cup final against South Africa.

The US squad struggled to create significant chances and never seemed capable of seriously challenging the well-organized Uruguayans.""It's difficult to say right now, obviously the emotions are running high,"" a disappointed US captain Christian Pulisic was quoted as saying by AFP after the game. ""We had a good start and brought a lot of energy, but just didn't have enough quality. We just couldn't find a solution.""Hopes for the US dimmed early as news arrived that Panama had taken a 1-0 lead against Bolivia in Orlando within the first 30 minutes. The Americans' prospects brightened briefly in the second half when Bolivia equalized, making the score 1-1 and giving the US a potential path to qualification if they could hold Uruguay.However, those hopes were short-lived. Uruguay took the lead through Mathias Olivera in controversial circumstances in the 66th minute. Ronald Araujo’s powerful header from a Nicolas de la Cruz free-kick was parried by US goalkeeper Matt Turner, only for Olivera to score on the rebound. Replays suggested Olivera was offside when Araujo initially made contact, but after a lengthy VAR review, Peruvian referee Kevin Ortega allowed the goal to stand.The US's chances of advancing grew increasingly slim when Panama regained their lead with a goal from Eduardo Guerrero to make it 2-1. The final blow came in stoppage time when Cesar Yanis scored a third for Panama, sealing their victory and ensuring the US's elimination.The early exit for the USA raises questions about the future of coach Gregg Berhalter, who has faced considerable criticism from American fans. Berhalter, who resumed the US coaching role in June last year following a break after the 2022 World Cup, now faces scrutiny about his capability to lead the team into the 2026 World Cup on home turf.Berhalter's frustrating record against top 20 teams continues, with only five wins in 20 outings against such opposition. Four of those victories were against regional rival Mexico, who also exited the Copa America in the first round.",The United States were eliminated from the Copa America on Monday after a 1-0 defeat to Uruguay.

In their first tour-level meeting, Muller, ranked 102nd, took the first set in a tiebreak.
