Sachin Tendulkar’s contribution in ISPL is invaluable, says League Commissioner Suraj Samat

MUMBAI: Ahead of his long-awaited Ranji Trophy comeback after more than 12 years, star bat Virat Kohli , currently struggling for form, resumed his training when he had a special nets session under the guidance of former India allrounder Sanjay Bangar at a ground in Bandra in the city.Bangar was India's batting coach during Virat Kohli's peak as an international cricketer between 2014 to 2019. During that time, Kohli often credited Bangar for his successful run.Whenever he is in Mumbai, the former India captain often trains under Bangar, with whom he clearly shares a comfortable equation.Kohli scored a bulk of his 80 international hundreds from 2014-19, when Bangar was a part of the Team India support staff.Bangar was later replaced by Vikram Rathour as India batting coach. Later, Bangar was the head coach of Kohli’s IPL team Royal Challengers Bengaluru for three years.In a video of the training session, which was widely circulating on social media on Sunday, Bangar was seen giving throwdowns from around 16 yards to Kohli, who seemed to be working more on his back foot play, rocking back to play the balls.A portable cement slab was placed at the back of length to feed the batter.Following the BCCI 's unofficial diktat to all centrally contracted cricketers to be available for domestic cricket, Kohli, who missed the last Ranji tie due to a neck sprain, will play in Delhi's last league game against Railways at the Kotla in Delhi from January 30.Except KL Rahul, almost all of Kohli's India teammates - skipper Rohit Sharma , Yashasvi Jaiswal, Shubman Gill, Rishabh Pant and Ravindra Jadeja playing in the just- concluded round of Ranji Trophy.Among the stars, only Jadeja and Gill, who scored a hundred, enjoyed fruitful outings.Kohli managed to scored just 190 runs in five Tests in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, including a century in the first Test at Perth. During the five home Tests this season against Bangladesh and New Zealand, his highest score was 47. Against New Zealand, all he managed to score was 93 runs in three Tests at an average of 15.50.The 36-year-old has been afflicted by serious technical issues against deliveries pitched on and outside the off-stump area and has been out in a similar way repeatedly, edging the ball behind time and again.",Virat Kohli had a special nets session under the guidance of former India allrounder Sanjay Bangar. Bangar was India's batting coach during Kohli's peak as an international cricketer between 2014-19.

Rams Vs. Eagles Game: An NFL Player Misbehaves with Matthew Stafford’s Wife Kelly Stafford During Rams vs. Eagles Game,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/an-nfl-player-misbehaves-with-matthew-staffords-wife-kelly-stafford-during-rams-vs-eagles-game/articleshow/117563441.cms,"Getty

From Where It All Started



""I fully thought this was a fan that was acting a certain way,"" Kelly said. [5:30] ""He was in the suite next to us and he was kind of just taunting a little bit, which, you know, you understand. But then, when I was told that he was an ex-player, it really baffled me. I expected it from a fan, I didn't really engage. But to get it from an ex-player and a supposed legend, I don't know what that means. Philadelphia has, like, Philadelphia legends, I guess.""

The Morning After Detroit Will Smith

""He was taunting the whole suite, which was honestly again, if you're a fan, I got it. We were all in LA gear, like totally understand it. But then he was doing the loser sign and my girls were sitting right there,""

""I did not expect this from an ex-player,""

The Los Angeles Rams’ divisional round game against the Philadelphia Eagles wasn’t just a loss on the scoreboard for Kelly Stafford—it turned into a deeply unsettling experience thanks to a former NFL player’s behavior. In the midst of the Rams not doing much better on the field, Kelly suddenly found herself confronting the ex-player, whose action quickly escalated what she thought could be just some aggressive fan behavior and turned into much more offensive in nature.As though that would be enough, it all started turning bad very soon when the player continued to disrespect the family. At one point in front of an entire suite, he mimicked her and also her family in a mock that even involved a ""loser"" sign—a thing Kelly did not like so much since there was her daughter beside her.she continued. It's one thing to mess with people who know what they are getting themselves into, but to include kids in that, NOT COOL.Kelly was visibly disturbed by the whole incident and showed her frustration over the ex-player's actions.she said. It is a game, but there is a level of respect you should have for others, especially when kids are involved.The confrontation didn't end there, but Kelly made it clear that she was more focused on her family's well-being than engaging in the drama. Though she didn't name the former player, she made it known that his behavior was completely out of line. This incident shed light on the fact that how players and their families had to face criticism and abuse publicly, how their mental health get ignored and no one gives a shit about their privacy.Despite this, Kelly also gave some words about the bright side of her experience. She was very good at saying the words of many Eagles fans who took care of her and her family on game day with respect and kindness. Still, she recalled the sour encounter: things that left on her mind, especially from an unexpected source.Also read - To Avenge Travis Kelce, You Won’t Believe Who His Ex Kayla Nicole is Supporting in the NFL Now—It’s NOT the Chiefs!","The Los Angeles Rams’ divisional round game against the Philadelphia Eagles wasn’t just a loss on the scoreboard for Kelly Stafford.

NEW DELHI: India batter Shubman Gill reflected on his recent struggles in red-ball cricket following his composed second-innings century for Punjab against Karnataka in the Ranji Trophy . While his 102-run effort showcased his undeniable talent, it came in a heavy defeat as Karnataka triumphed by an innings and 207 runs.""Red-ball batting is a concern,"" Gill conceded candidly. ""Sometimes, I think with the red ball, in the matches that I play, I get very good 25-30 runs. I think in those moments, I put too much pressure on myself to score big runs. That’s not the way I have grown up playing my game.""The elegant right-hander admitted that overthinking has often disrupted his rhythm. ""There is a certain zone that I am in, certain intent that I am in, and sometimes I lose that because I put too much pressure on myself that I have to get a big run now that I am set,"" he explained.Gill’s century, which included measured resilience early on and aggression later, was satisfying, especially after his dismissal off an inside edge in the first innings. ""I think this innings was very satisfying for me, the way I played,"" he said. ""In the first 130 balls, I scored 40-odd runs. They were bowling well, and there was some help in the wicket as well. Keeping that in mind, I was very satisfied with the way I was playing.""Reflecting on his approach, he added, ""After lunch, I just thought to play a little bit more of my shots. The wickets were falling from one end, so I wanted to make sure I was getting some runs as well.""Gill acknowledged that competitive match practice is invaluable, no matter how much preparation a player undertakes in training. ""When you’re playing at any level, certain aspects of your game are challenged that you can’t replicate in practice. So, if there’s enough of a gap before the next series, I think it’s very helpful to play matches,"" he remarked.Gill’s introspection and gritty century underscore his commitment to addressing his red-ball challenges as he looks to reclaim consistency in the format.","Shubman Gill scored 102 runs for Punjab against Karnataka in the Ranji Trophy.

NEW DELHI: India captain Suryakumar Yadav was full of praise for Tilak Varma after his match-winning knock steered India to a nail-biting two-wicket victory against England in the second T20I in Chennai on Saturday. Tilak's unbeaten 72 off 55 balls anchored India's chase of 166, with four balls to spare, in a game that swung back and forth until the very end.""Very happy with the way Tilak batted,"" said Suryakumar during the post-match presentation. ""Good to see someone like him taking responsibility. Ravi Bishnoi also deserves credit; he has been putting in the hard work in the nets and wants to contribute with the bat. Both of them showed a lot of character today.""The match saw India under pressure at various stages, with the required run rate climbing and wickets falling at crucial moments. With 20 runs needed from the final three overs, Tilak remained calm and placed his faith in Bishnoi, who chipped in with two valuable boundaries, including a flick off Brydon Carse and an edge against Liam Livingstone Reflecting on the tense chase, Suryakumar expressed relief that the team held its nerve. ""A little bit of relief. The way the game was going, we felt 160 was good, but the way they bowled, it was good that the game went down to the wire. We've been playing with an extra batter for the last few series, and that depth really helped today,"" he said.Suryakumar also highlighted the team's aggressive approach, a shift in mindset that has been evident throughout the series. ""The chat was to play like the last game. Good to see we are playing an aggressive brand of cricket. At the same time, the guys put their hands up and stitched the small partnerships. That was key in taking the pressure off,"" he noted.The skipper credited the relaxed atmosphere in the dressing room for enabling the players to express themselves freely. ""The boys have taken off a lot of pressure, and the atmosphere in the dressing room is light. There will be days it won't come off, but we know what we want to do. If we're on the same page, good things will take place,"" he added.India's bowlers also played a pivotal role, restricting England to 165/9 on a two-paced surface.

NEW DELHI: Gukesh Dommaraju, the youngest-ever World Chess Champion, displayed his best version in classical chess during Round 7 of the Tata Steel Chess Tournament 2025 on Saturday in Wijk aan Zee .Facing compatriot Pentala Harikrishna , who also served as his second during the World Chess Championship against Ding Liren, Gukesh opted for the French Opening.Despite Harikrishna's strong start with the black pieces, he made a misstep on move 12 (Nfe7) after white castled early on move 7. Gukesh capitalised on this by exerting dominance in the centre of the board.The 38-year-old GM attempted to reposition his knight with Kf5 but only compounded his troubles, handing further advantage to the youngster.A critical moment came on move 20 when Gukesh's b4 posed a serious threat; however, Harikrishna missed the opportunity for an effective counter.On move 29, Harikrishna captured a pawn with Nxe3, but Gukesh’s reply, Qb7—widely regarded as the best move in the position—steered the game decisively in his favour. The endgame reached its climax when Harikrishna resigned on move 45.With this victory, Gukesh climbed to the top of the Masters leaderboard in the 87th edition of the ""Wimbledon of Chess"", scoring 5/7.Meanwhile, Praggnanandhaa Rameshbabu faced Jorden van Foreest, a former Tata Steel champion. Playing Black, Pragg adopted the Sicilian Defense and skillfully countered the Dutch GM's solid play.A couple of strong moves from the Dutch grandmaster were aptly countered by the Indian GM. With the queens being traded off the board by the end of the 16th move, the game reached a stalemate.Sensing the deadlock, Pragg chose to shake hands and call it a draw, maintaining his position as co-leader of the Masters, with the same points as Gukesh and Nodirbek Abdusattorov.While Gukesh and Pragg had a good day in the office, Arjun Erigaisi 's poor run in the tournament continued as he suffered a heavy loss to Dutchman Max Warmerdam.Playing the Sicilian Defense with the black pieces, Arjun made several early mistakes, giving Max some breathing space. Despite trying to remain compact in the centre of the board for a long time, Arjun took Max's bait and sacrificed his rook with his own rook on the 29th move, which proved fatal for the Indian.Although he showed some resistance with the queen, Arjun resigned with his queen still on the board, and the Indian GM currently finds himself at the bottom of the Masters standings.Elsewhere, Leon Luke Mendonca held off defending champion Wei Yi in a 40-move draw. Notable games included draws between Dutch No. 1 Anish Giri and Abdusattorov, as well as Fabiano Caruana and Alexey Sarana.

Fans on social media begged CBS to give Hailey Steinfeld as much “camera time” as Taylor Swift

The AFC Championship Game tonight pits the Chiefs against the Bills; the winners, who get tired of the Taylor Swift -Hailee Steinfeld (faux) drama. After Sunday, there will not be any more ""bad blood"" comparisons between two women; Taylor's dating Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce . Steinfeld is newly engaged to Bills quarterback Josh Allen .Taylor Swift and Hailee Steinfeld are cheering for their favorite teams at the AFC Championship Game between the Kansas City Chiefs and Buffalo Bills . Swift has regularly attended Kansas City Chiefs home games, particularly in the last two seasons, as Kelce and the Chiefs pursue a third Super Bowl title, often sitting in the Kelce family suite at Arrowhead Stadium.Steinfeld frequently attends Bills games, cheering on her fiancé, Allen. She was even spotted with some of the wives and girlfriends of Bills players, including Paige Buchele and Tayler Bernard, during the Bills' wild-card win.There have been comparisons between two women who have known each other longer than their NFL significant others. Before the start of Sunday’s game, football fans on social media begged CBS to give Steinfeld as much “camera time” as Swift.One fan tweeted, “Hailee Steinfeld vs Taylor Swift game today”. Another wrote,“I personally will be rooting for Hailee Steinfeld over Taylor Swift for today’s game. Sorry not sorry Swifties.” A third wrote, “Rooting for the Bills in order to see Josh Allen and Hailee Steinfeld on the field instead of Kelce/Swift. I demand variety in my sports power couples.”One more fan tweeted, “CBS needs to show Hailee Steinfeld every time taylor swift is on my screen. It's only fair.” Another fan wrote, “i’m not going to pretend i know what happened between taylor and hailee steinfeld but it makes me sad that at one point they were such close friends and now they go to the same football games and don’t even say hi to each other.”Swift and Steinfeld have met before, but their relationship appears to have changed since Steinfeld featured in Swift's 2014 video for ""Bad Blood,"" featuring Swift's famous friends. However, the relationship is not clear in the years.Last year, Swift attended a Chiefs playoff game in Buffalo with Travis's brother, Jason Kelce. Jason left the suite shirtless, leaving the crowd.

Chiefs defeat Buffalo Bills to win AFC title and to continue 3-peat quest



The Kansas City Chiefs have advanced to their third-consecutive Super Bowl appearance, while the Philadelphia Eagles will have to wait at least one more season for that elusive championship. Chiefs held on for a 32-29 victory over the Buffalo Bills in the AFC Championship Game on Sunday at Arrowhead Stadium Kansas City will now face the Philadelphia Eagles on Feb. 9 with a chance to record the NFL 's first-ever three-peat.The Kansas City Chiefs defeated the Buffalo Bills 32-29 in the AFC Championship Game on Sunday, securing their third consecutive trip to the Super Bowl. Star quarterback Patrick Mahomes once again showed the world why he is considered one of the NFL’s elite, leading the Chiefs with precision and grit. This victory not only marks Kansas City's dominance but also sets up a highly anticipated rematch with the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LIX on February 9 at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans.Patrick Mahomes delivered a masterclass performance, throwing for 245 yards and a touchdown while completing 18 of 26 passes. He also contributed significantly on the ground, rushing for 43 yards and scoring two crucial touchdowns. In a moment emblematic of his competitive spirit, Mahomes fearlessly fought through defenders to reach the end zone, showcasing his determination to keep the Chiefs' title hopes alive.The game reached a boiling point in the final quarter when Mahomes orchestrated a drive that set up Harrison Butker’s decisive 35-yard field goal. With just under four minutes remaining, this kick proved pivotal in sealing Kansas City’s victory and keeping their dream of achieving the NFL’s first modern-era three-peat alive.The Bills and Chiefs delivered yet another playoff classic, with momentum swinging back and forth throughout the game. Buffalo showed resilience, narrowing a halftime deficit of 21-16 and even taking a 22-21 lead in the third quarter after a dramatic fourth-down touchdown by James Cook. Sean McDermott’s aggressive play-calling kept the Bills in contention, but critical missed opportunities, including a failed fourth-down quarterback sneak by Josh Allen , proved costly.Kansas City capitalized on Buffalo’s errors, with Mahomes taking advantage of the short field to score a 10-yard rushing touchdown and converting the subsequent 2-point attempt to extend the lead to 29-22. However, Buffalo refused to back down, as Allen connected with Curtis Samuel on a fourth-and-goal play to tie the game at 29-29 with just over six minutes remaining.Despite Buffalo’s efforts, the Chiefs' poise under pressure ultimately made the difference. A drive aided by a costly facemask penalty on Buffalo’s Matt Milano brought the Chiefs into scoring position. While a sack momentarily halted their momentum, Butker’s reliable leg ensured Kansas City emerged victorious.With the win, the Chiefs now face the Philadelphia Eagles, who dominated the Washington Commanders in the NFC Championship Game with a 55-26 victory. Having already secured three Super Bowl titles in five years, Kansas City will look to etch their name in history as the first team to achieve a three-peat.Also Read: Chiefs' Travis Kelce Draws Penalty with Bold Flop Following Patrick Mahomes Touchdown Super Bowl LIX, scheduled for February 9, promises to be a battle of two football titans, with Kansas City aiming for unprecedented glory and Philadelphia eager to avenge their previous Super Bowl loss.

Career and personal life

Bonnie Blue , a 25-year-old OnlyFans creator from Derbyshire , claims to have set a world record by having sex with 1,057 men in 12 hours, reports Daily Mail.The event took place in London, allegedly surpassing the previous record of 919 men in 24 hours set by adult actress Lisa Sparks in 2004, with Bonnie claiming she ""bedded 1,057 in 12 hours.""In a video shared on TikTok, Bonnie thanked those who participated, saying, “Thank you to all the barely legal, barely breathing and the husbands.”She added that her skin looked better after the event and described the experience: “The room was absolutely full. We did groups of five, like one after the other. It was a rotating circle.”Her PR team confirmed the tally, stating, “She slept with 1,057 people. As she hit 1,000, there were still 57 left in the queue who Bonnie wanted to pleasure before ending the 12-hour day.” Calculations suggest she averaged 41 seconds per partner.The stunt sparked outrage online, with comments such as “How embarrassing” and “Sad that men would want to do that too—all for fame and money.” Bonnie is no stranger to controversy, having previously defended her claims of sleeping with “barely legal” 18-year-olds and encouraging men to cheat on their wives.Bonnie's real name is Tia Billinger , who says she earns up to £750,000 a month from her OnlyFans content. Despite criticism, she insists her work is educational. “I can’t think of one situation where an 18-year-old has had sex where they’ve had to bring a passport, sign consent forms, and do a breathalyser,” she said on ITV’s This Morning.She also addressed criticism for sleeping with married men, arguing, “If wives aren’t going to pleasure husbands, let them go elsewhere. It’s just an act; the husbands mean nothing to me.”Bonnie transitioned to sex work after moving to Australia in 2022 with her now ex-husband, Oliver Davidson. Formerly a recruitment professional, she launched her career as a cam girl and later joined OnlyFans.She claims her family now supports her career, with her mother even assisting her business by booking appointments and handing out condoms for marketing. “It’s changed their life completely for the better,” she said.Bonnie defended her actions, stating, “These 18-year-olds can go to the army, they can drive, they can drink… If they want to use their own bodies to come and sleep with me, that is their decision.”","Bonnie Blue, 25, claims to have had sex with 1,057 men in 12 hours.

NEW DELHI: As Indian cricket holds its breath over Jasprit Bumrah ’s fitness, it has emerged his back injury is due to be assessed by orthopedic surgeon Dr Rowan Schouten in New Zealand, with a consultation visit also planned depending on his report and feedback.TOI understands that the Indian cricket board ( BCCI ) is already planning a backup since Bumrah could be cutting it very fine to get fit in time for ICC Champions Trophy next month.The ace bowler has been picked for CT and also named in the team for the third ODI against England in Ahmedabad on Feb 12, but there are no high hopes around him.The changes to the CT team can be made till Feb 11. The selectors have already named Harshit Rana for the first two ODIs against England. It will be interesting to see if they continue with Rana should Bumrah fail to get fit for CT.Sources said given the experience he has, Mohammed Siraj could be back in contention in such a scenario.“The BCCI medical team is in touch with Schouten in New Zealand. The board had also planned a visit for Bumrah to New Zealand. But that hasn’t happened yet. The selectors know it will be a miracle if Bumrah turns up 100% fit in the given timeline,” a BCCI source told TOI.Schouten had operated on Bumrah after he missed the T20 World Cup in 2022. He didn’t take the field in the second innings of the Sydney Test in the first week of this month when he complained of discomfort in his back.Bumrah and the rest of the fast bowlers who played most Test matches during the Test season were advised to take a three week offloading process. The offloading process dictates a player to not undertake any strenuous physical activity which includes basic fitness training as well. BCCI’s medical team was due to evaluate Bumrah’s condition after the offloading process which was due to end last week.“The reports will be shared with his doctor in New Zealand. Sending Bumrah to New Zealand will depend on the feedback. The board and Bumrah himself are not willing to push hard given his significance over a long period of time,” the source said.“The selectors will only be informed if he is ready to take the field after the entire process is complete. The selectors will need to keep a backup plan ready for him. It will be a miracle if Bumrah makes it,” the source added.It may be recalled that the Indian team tried to rush Bumrah back in action in a home series against Australia in 2022 which resulted in him breaking down again and he subsequently missed the T20 World Cup. Mohammed Shami’s comeback in international cricket is held back as the team management has not opted to play him in the first two T20Is against England.However, TOI understands that the team management is saving him for the ODI season, and is happy with how Shami is shaping up after a long injury layoff.“Shami has shed two kgs from what he weighed before his injury. He is bowling at full tilt. He is not needed as much in the T20 matches. But he should be good to go once the ODIs come around,” the source added.",Jasprit Bumrah's back injury is due to be assessed by orthopedic surgeon Dr Rowan Schouten in New Zealand.

CHENNAI: Tilak Varma may only be at the nascent stage of his T20I career, but the versatile India batter is moulding into a bankable resource.In the tour to South Africa late last year, the left-hander, who was promoted to No. 3, activated his destructive mode, especially during his twin unbeaten centuries. While Tilak has carved a niche for himself with positive intent-filled knocks, the fast-rising 22-year-old on Saturday displayed another key facet of his game.Up against a pace-heavy England attack on a tricky Chepauk track in the second T20I, Tilak showed excellent awareness in the successful 166-run chase and did just what the doctor ordered when the match seemed to be drifting away from the hosts. The southpaw expertly blended caution and aggression besides taking up the lead role in tough circumstances.“The pitch was double-paced and it was quite challenging to bat on. Wickets were falling continuously, and I was thinking that I should bat till the end. I wanted to show intent and I was looking for the gaps as well. I did that,” said Tilak after delivering a spectacular unbeaten 72, for which the ‘Man of the Match’ deservedly received a standing ovation.“I know that I can play both types, hitting at a good strike-rate and scoring at six or seven runs per over. During the drinks break, Gautam Gambhir (head coach) told me that I can show everyone that I can play over 10 and under 10 (run-rate). He asked me to be flexible. I got a chance to prove myself in this game,” added Tilak.The youngster operated with a simple yet effective mantra. He met fire with fire, targeting pacer Jofra Archer , whom he smacked for 30 runs off just nine deliveries.“I wanted to take on their (England’s) best bowlers. If I take on the best bowlers, it will put pressure on the others. When wickets were falling, I wanted to take on their best bowler. I felt that it would make the job easier for the batters at the other end. I backed myself and took chances. I was mentally prepared for it, having played those shots at the nets,” he said.Brimming with confidence after producing yet another effective knock, Tilak is prepared to perform a different role if required. “Before the South Africa series, I had not batted much at No. 3, maybe two or three times. I am ready to bat anywhere, and I am flexible. I know how to manage while batting at Nos 4, 5 or 6, but I like batting at No. 3. What the team needs, I am ready for that,” Tilak went on to add.",Tilak Varma named Man of the Match in India's second T20I win over England. The 22-year-old scored 72 not out in Chepauk. He was promoted to No. 3 from No. 4 on the tour of South Africa last year.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117589058,imgsize-39890,width-400,resizemode-4/117589058.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The Round 8 matchup of the Tata Steel Chess Tournament 2025 between Praggnanandhaa Rameshbabu and Gukesh Dommaraju on Sunday drew significant attention in Wijk aan Zee , with a large crowd gathering at the Dutch venue to witness the youngest-ever World Chess Champion face his compatriot.Defending the black pieces, Gukesh went for the Berlin Defense in a Ruy López opening. Following Praggnanandhaa’s castling on his 6th move, Gukesh chose to move his queen. However, neither player seemed eager to push forward, instead playing a balanced game on the board.Gukesh, who had the advantage, played a careless move (a3), giving Praggnanandhaa some industry. As the queens were exchanged, the game seemed to drift towards a deadlock. Both players made attempts to break the stalemate but were unable to find a way forward, ultimately agreeing to a draw after 33 moves.The result did little to alter the standings at the top of the Masters leaderboard. Co-leader Nodirbek Abdusattorov also drew his game against the fiercely competitive Vladimir Fedoseev of Russia, meaning that Nodirbek, Gukesh, and Praggnanandhaa all continue to share the top spot, each with 5.5 points.Arjun Erigaisi , still winless in the tournament, drew his game against Serbia’s Alexey Sarana. Ranked World No. 4 and India’s No. 1 entering the tournament, Arjun has seen his form's noticeable decline, losing around 30 ELO points over the last week. He now sits in sixth place, behind Nodirbek Abdusattorov in the live world rankings.Sarana, playing with the black pieces, faced the Queen’s Knight variation of the Queen’s Gambit Declined. Arjun took a conservative approach while Sarana pressed for an advantage.However, Arjun held his position firm, and Sarana had no choice but to agree to a draw on the 23rd move. Given Arjun’s poor form, this draw can be considered a welcome respite, especially with a rest day on Monday allowing him the chance to reset.Dutch No. 1 Anish Giri registered his seventh consecutive draw of the tournament, this time against India’s Pentala Harikrishna. In another 30-move game, Leon Luke Mendonca of India also drew against the Netherlands’ Jorden van Foreest.Top seed Fabiano Caruana defeated Germany’s Vincent Keymer, claiming his second win in the 87th edition of the “Wimbledon of Chess”. Defending champion Wei Yi beat Dutchman Max Warmerdam in one of the longest games of the day (63 moves).In the Challengers section, Vaishali Rameshbabu fought valiantly against Arthur Pijpers, with the game ending in a draw. India’s 19-year-old Divya Deshmukh, playing with the white pieces, lost to Kazakhstan’s Kazybek Nogerbek.The 11-year-old Argentinian sensation Faustino Oro resigned against Aydin Suleymanli, while Chinese wonder Lu Miaoyi was also defeated by the sole Challengers leader, Thai Dai Van Nguyen.","Gukesh Dommaraju and Praggnanandhaa Rameshbabu draw in Round 8 of Tata Steel Chess Tournament 2025.

Jannik Sinner retains Australian Open title with straight sets victory over Alexander Zverev,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/australian-open/jannik-sinner-retains-australian-open-title-with-straight-sets-victory-over-alexander-zverev/articleshow/117578014.cms,"(Photo by Darrian Traynor/Getty Images)

Jannik Sinner threw in a daring drop shot at match point, it came off his forehand side and was shaped with underspin. Alexander Zverev picked it up and didn't place it too poorly, but Sinner stepped in and swung through the court to close out the Australian Open final.After two-hours and 42-minutes of action in which time he strung together the 6-3, 7-6 (4), 6-3 win, Sinner, the world No.1, pushed his head back and threw up his arms in celebration. After the few seconds he had to himself, Rod Laver Arena on its feet, cheering him, Sinner looked at his team – coaches Darren Cahill and Simone Vagnozzi, trainer and physio Marco Panichi and Ulises Badio – before going over to embrace them.Not far from where Sinner celebrated his second successive win at Australian Open, Zverev, the world No.2, sat in his courtside seat, head bowed. The German has played three Slam finals and is looking for his first major title.Sinner and Zverev shared a warm embrace at the net and the 23-year-old began his speech with encouraging words for Zverev.""You are an amazing player,"" Sinner said. ""Keep believing in yourself, because all players and coaches know how strong you are, not only as a player, but also as a person. We all believe that you can lift one of these very, very soon.""Sinner, now a two-time Australian Open champion, and a three-time major winner, placed the Norman Brookes Challenge Cup beside him as he spoke, said, ""Talking about my team, what can I say? We worked a lot to be again in this position. It’s an amazing feeling to share this moment with all of you. It is amazing to achieve these things, but mostly to share this with you guys.""""And I know Darren, it's probably your - maybe, I try to convince you to stay - your last Australian Open as a coach, and I'm very, very happy to share this trophy with you,"" Sinner told Cahill, who was tearing up. ""Everything started a little bit when I made my whole change to Simone (Vagnozzi), and I think you are an amazing combination of coaches.""Earlier, when the German stepped forward to make his speech, there was a shout from the crowd, ""Australia Believes Olya and Brenda! Australia Believes Olya and Brenda!""Zverev battled a domestic violence case in Germany last year, accused by his ex-girlfriend Brenda Patea, the mother of his child, of physically abusing her. All of which he denies and wasn't formally charged.When asked about it in the press conference, Zverev said, ""I believe there are no more accusations. There haven't been for nine months now. Good for her. I think she was the only one in the stadium who believed anything in that moment. I think I've done everything I can, and I'm not about to open that subject again.""Zverev applauded the winner in his speech. ""You are the best player in the world by far.

You really deserve it.""Sinner, who hasn't lost a set against top-ten opponents since losing to Carlos Alcaraz in Beijing in September, may not have played his best match in the final, but did enough to get through without facing a breakpoint.Sinner was kitted in colour blocks of the palest yellow and white, his attire cutting an anaemic look, while across the net Zverev was all colour, red on maroon with red shoes.In the first set, the 27-year-old, coming into the net, trying to unsettle the Italian, gave Sinner some target practice.

Joburg Super Kings pacers Lutho Sipamla and Hardus Viljoen dominated the Sunrisers Eastern Cape at the Wanderers on Sunday, leading their side's decisive nine-wicket bonus-point win on Sunday at the Wanderers.After the Super Kings opted to bowl first, Sipamla delivered an impressive opening spell, claiming 3 for 13, which was followed by Viljoen's devastating burst of 4 for 24 towards the backend. It restricted the Sunrisers to a mere 118 runs.The chase was then led by New Zalander Devon Conway, who remained unbeaten on 76.Sipamla broke the back of Sunrisers' top order. He first had England batter Zak Crawley (0) caught at slip and then dismissed Tom Abell for a duck as well, leaving the visitors struggling at 0 for 2 at the conclusion of the first over.The situation deteriorated further for the Sunrisers as Jordan Hermann and Aiden Markram departed shortly afterwards without scoring, reducing the defending champions to 17 for 4.

THE TILAK VARMA SHOW

SHAKY START TO THE CHASE

THE COSTLY DROP

ENGLAND 'SPUN OUT' AGAIN

Tilak Varma produced an exceptional innings in a tough situation while wickets kept falling around him and managed to hold his nerve in India's famous two-wicket win against England in the second T20I at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai on Saturday.The last-over win gave India a 2-0 lead in the five-match series.Varma's (72 not out of 55 balls) skilfully exploited the pace battery of English bowlers and steered India to their target, with the home side concluding at 166 for 8 in 19.2 overs.The innings was particularly remarkable as the left-handed batter had minimal support from his partners, while the England bowlers maintained their momentum after securing breakthroughs at regular intervals.Jofra Archer proved particularly costly, with Varma targeting him specifically, striking four sixes against the Sussex bowler, the fourth bringing up his fifty, as Archer conceded 60 runs in four overs besides claiming Sanju Samson's (5) wicket.The southpaw's remarkable shot, sending the ball over deep fine leg for six against Brydon Carse (3 for 29), demonstrated his exceptional batting skills.India faced tense moments at the start of their run-chase before Varma's steadfast batting guided them to victory.Opener Abhishek Sharma (12) began India's innings brilliantly, striking three boundaries against Archer in the opening over. However, Mark Wood's pace caught him on the back foot and the review of the LBW decision by the batter stayed in favour of Wood.The situation shortly deteriorated to 19 for 2 with Samson's departure.A swift 39-run partnership between captain Suryakumar Yadav and Varma alleviated some pressure, taking the score to 58, but Carse dismissed Suryakumar (12), who played onto his stumps.The English pace attack capitalised on the opportunity, as India lost Dhruv Jurel (4) and Hardik Pandya's (7) wickets and were left struggling at 78 for 5.Washington Sundar capitalised on his early fortune when Adil Rashid dropped him at mid-on off Wood's bowling. He went on to strike Wood for a six and two fours in quick succession, helping in bringing the required run-rate in manageable space.However, Sundar's innings (26 off 19) came to an end when he attempted to guide Carse towards third-man, only to have his stumps disturbed.At that stage, India were struggling at 116 for 6, but found resilience through Varma.After India won the toss and opted to bowl, England captain Jos Buttler showed resistance, but his fellow English batters faltered against the Indian spinners.Buttler (45 off 30 balls) displayed his class with some brilliant shots, including a sequence of 4, 6, 4 against Arshdeep Singh, who had already dismissed Phil Salt in his opening over.Salt's attempt to pull the left-arm pacer fell short as Sundar, who came in for the injured Nitish Reddy, took the catch near the square leg boundary.Sundar found success when Ben Duckett's reverse sweep was caught by Jurel, who replaced the injured Rinku Singh.The pull shot proved to be problematic for England batters throughout the evening, with both Buttler and Liam Livingstone falling while attempting it.India's vice-captain Axar Patel (2 for 32) capitalised on England batters' aggressive approach.The left-arm spinner's strategy of bowling into the pitch, combined with the surface grip, made it difficult for batters to control their shots.Buttler, whose aggressive batting had helped England reach 58 for 2 in the Powerplay overs, was caught by Varma, while Livingstone was dismissed when he was caught by substitute fielder Harshit Rana.Carse, who replaced Atkinson in the line-up, displayed aggression with a quickfire 31 from 17 deliveries, including three sixes. However, his promising innings ended in a run-out after a mix-up with Archer.Another notable moment of England's batting show came in the form of Brook's dismissal. Despite starting well with a six against Varun Chakravarthy (2 for 38), Brook's innings was cut short.Chakravarthy's clever variation with a back-of-the-hand delivery proved too good for Brook, who failed to read the ball as it crashed into his off-stump.",Varma's (72 not out of 55 balls) skilfully exploited the pace battery of English bowlers and steered India to their target. The home side concluded at 166 for 8 in 19.2 overs.

That's not a problem for me. It's a motivation.""His sole encounter with Federer occurred during last year's US Open.""I would love to talk to him again,"" he expressed when asked if he anticipated a call from the 43-year-old following his Australian achievement.","Henry Bernet won the Australian Open boys' championship on Saturday.

in Melbourne:

Intent might be everything on Sunday night when the Rod Laver Arena rocks to the beat of gunshot serves and muzzle energy off the ground.The common consensus in tennis circles is that Alexander Zverev , the world No. 2, is a ‘beast’ physically and should the Australian Open men’s singles final go the distance, it augurs well for the German whose 5-set record stands tall at 23-13.Jannik Sinner , the world No. 1, who hasn’t lost a match since Oct, but has struggled physically in Melbourne, will want to finish it quickly. The defending champion has lost five of his last six 5-set matches (from Jan 2023).Zverev, 27, playing his third major final, and looking for his first Grand Slam title, showed intent after coming up short against the genius of Carlos Alcaraz last June in Roland Garros, falling in five sets in the final. Not long after, Zverev signed up fitness guru Jez Green, who he had worked with early in his career (2015 to 2021).“I always knew that I could last with anyone for as long as I wanted when I was with Jez Green. When I was with him for seven years, I felt like I was one of the strongest players on tour, physically,” the world No. 2 said. “That was the reason why I hired him, to be physically at the same level again. I said it after the French Open final that I got tired against Carlos, I simply got tired in the fourth and fifth sets.”Sinner, who trails Zverev 2-4 in head-to-head clashes, will look to corner his opponent and make the contest a mental exchange. “It’s going to be mental, no?” the 23-year-old defending champion said of the final. “It’s going to be a tough match for both of us. It’ll be physical, for sure.”Sinner who rallied from 0-2 sets down to beat Daniil Medvedev in last year’s final isn’t new to the long story. He has learnt well from the six losses in nine 5-set affairs.“I try to put a lot of work in the days off, trying to understand my body,” said Sinner, who overcame physical discomfort in the fourth round against Holger Rune and in the semifinals against Ben Shelton. “There’s a lot of things going on, on and off the court. I try to isolate myself a little bit, trying to be myself on the court. There are days where it’s easier, days where I struggle a bit more.”Sinner’s coach Darren Cahill, who applauded the work Zverev has put in over the years, extolled the German’s physical prowess. “Jannik is improving, he’s getting better physically. He’s somewhat of a late developer with the body. He is about 6-ft-4-in now,” he said. “He’s going to get better as time goes along.”Zverev, who has saved 27 of 35 (77%) of breakpoints in this year’s championships, is only a tad behind the Italian who has saved 18 of 23 (78%). “Playing at night maybe will favour Jannik a bit more,” Zverev said.","Alexander Zverev faces Jannik Sinner in the Australian Open men's singles final.

Axar Patel hints at flexible middle-order ahead of England T20I series

CHENNAI: Tilak Varma is slowly but steadily turning into a T20 beast. Everything the southpaw is touching in the shortest format is turning into gold.Batting at No. 3 in recent times after skipper Suryakumar Yadav made a sacrifice by dropping to the next slot, Tilak (72 not out off 55 balls; 4x4, 5x6) on Saturday extended his dream run with a stunning display of his match-winning credentials. The 22-year-old singlehandedly guided India to a thrilling two wicket victory over England in a nervewracking second T20I at the MA Chidambaram Stadium, staying unbeaten for the fourth match in succession.India found themselves in a precarious position in the chase and were staring at an unlikely defeat after the hosts’ spinners pounced on the visitors’ weakness to restrict them to a below-par 165-9. Despite frequently losing partners at the other end, Tilak provided India hope with his assured knock that had an assortment of shots.The left-handed batter adopted a calculative approach, which was the need of the hour. When he smashed express pacer Jofra Archer for back-to-back sixes in the 16th over, it seemed that he was destined to pull off a tough chase. He batted remarkably well with the tail and after hitting Jamie Overton for the game-winning boundary, he pumped his fists in the air in sheer delight.Towards the deep end, he found an able ally in No. 10 batter Ravi Bishnoi as the duo guided India in choppy waters to the target.Before Tilak took over, the India tweakers combined for 14 overs and six of the nine wickets that fell as the tourists could only record 165-9 after being invited to bat first on what appeared a decent batting deck. Skipper Jos Buttler threatened with a 30-ball 45 (2x4, 3x6), while Brydon Carse (31 off 17 balls; 1x4, 3x6) and debutant Jamie Smith (22) were the other top contributors in an innings where England could never kick on.The India spinners struck at regular intervals after left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh set the tone early by removing Phil Salt in the first over. Left-arm orthodox bowler Axar Patel (2-32) was one of the chief architects of England’s downfall, removing Buttler and Liam Livingstone in similar fashion.Both batters tried to line Axar up and clear the fence on their leg-side, only to be sent back to the hut with catches on the boundary.Varun Chakravarthy (2-38) and Washington Sundar (1-9), playing at ‘home’, sent the ‘local’ crowd into raptures, with Ravi Bishnoi (0-27) and Abhishek Sharma (1-12) also joining the party. Drafted into the XI, Washington dismissed Ben Duckett in his very first ball after the southpaw’s ambitious yet ineffective reverse sweep led to a meagre return.Varun bamboozled Brook for the second game running as the latter looked clueless facing the mystery spinner’s incoming delivery. In his last over, where Carse smashed him for two sixes, Varun disturbed the stumps once again, this time Jamie Overton falling prey.","India beat England by two wickets in second T20I at the MA Chidambaram Stadium.

CHENNAI: Stars returning to play domestic tournaments has been the hot topic of discussion in Indian cricket of late, especially with coach Gautam Gambhir and the BCCI making it clear that domestic outings are a must for those who want to play for India.Varun Chakravarthy , a key component of India’s T20I set-up, on Friday echoed Gambhir’s views, emphasising that consistently featuring for his state side Tamil Nadu in white-ball competitions has contributed to his growth as a spinner. “Definitely, it gives me the rhythm (before joining the India team). The level in domestic cricket is extremely high. I would say that it is almost on par with the IPL and the international matches that we play,” said Varun on the eve of the second India-England T20I here.Varun finished as the second-highest wicket-taker in the recent Vijay Hazare Trophy (50 overs) with 18 scalps in six matches and also shone in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy (T20). “I would suggest to everyone to go and play the Mushtaq Ali Trophy as it is very challenging. We play on small grounds and I find it very tough playing the SMAT.“It (domestic cricket) has definitely helped me get better, be more instinctive and on my toes. It has also helped me to think correctly at the right time,” Varun said.‘Should be ready for all challenges’: Varun stressed that the bowlers must try to stay one step ahead of the batters, even though T20 has become a batter-dominated format with favourable surfaces and small-sized boundaries.“In T20s, almost everywhere, the grounds are very small. Bowlers have the challenge of bowling from smaller ends. We plan for that as well. If we say that the batters are looking to have an aggressive approach, that is how T20 is. I cannot complain or be shocked by their (England’s) approach. I am expecting it and I have certain plans for that. Let us see if they work.”The 33-year-old also said that he has been putting in the hard yards to turn into a multi-utility cricketer across levels. “I have been working on my batting for the last six to seven months. I started my preparation at Kolkata Knight Riders, with the help of Abhishek Nayar (current India assistant coach). That kind of helped me. There is still a lot of work to do.”",Varun Chakravarthy says playing for Tamil Nadu in domestic tournaments has helped his development as a spinner.

South African rising star Annerie Dercksen has been crowned the ICC Emerging Women's Cricketer of the Year for 2024, beating out tough competition from Scotland's Saskia Horley , India's Shreyanka Patil , and Ireland's Freya Sargent .Dercksen made her international debut for South Africa in January 2023 during a T20I triangular series against India and West Indies, and has been a fixture in the team ever since.While she played in five T20Is in her debut year, the all-rounder truly established herself on the international stage in 2024, making her Test and ODI debuts as well.Dercksen's impressive 2024 stats include 161 runs and 5 wickets in 17 T20Is, 60 runs in 2 Tests, and 70 runs and 6 wickets in 4 ODIs.She showed great composure with the bat, demonstrating the ability to rebuild an innings and guide a chase when needed, including a crucial 27 in South Africa's sole victory in the limited-overs series against England late in the year.As a medium pacer, Dercksen also picked up 11 wickets, showcasing her potential as a genuine all-rounder.She was a key member of South Africa's impressive run to the final of the ICC Women's T20 World Cup 2024, where they ultimately fell short against New Zealand.Dercksen maintained a strong T20I average of 32.2 and often rescued South Africa from difficult situations, while also showing the ability to increase the scoring rate despite batting in the lower order early in the year before moving up to the middle order.Her bowling was even more impressive in the longer white-ball format, with a career-best of 3/16 against England in the first ODI.She also performed well in tough Test matches against India and England, with a best of 41 in Bloemfontein, where she helped rebuild the innings with a 92-run partnership for the second wicket.In the lead-up to the Women's T20 World Cup 2024, Dercksen had limited batting opportunities in the T20I series against Pakistan, but made the most of her chance in the series decider.In the series decider, South Africa faced a daunting chase of 154 runs. The early dismissal of Tazmin Brits and Anneke Bosch retiring hurt at a crucial juncture left the team in a precarious position.However, Dercksen stepped up under pressure, delivering a scintillating unbeaten 44 off just 23 balls. Her innings featured six boundaries and two massive sixes, taking on the seasoned bowlers Nida Dar and Sadia Iqbal with remarkable confidence.Dercksen's explosive performance led South Africa to a thrilling series-clinching victory and earned her the well-deserved Player of the Match award.","Annerie Dercksen has been crowned the ICC Emerging Women's Cricketer of the Year for 2024.

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu took a significant step towards the knock-out stage with a resounding 209-run win over Chandigarh in a group D match of the Ranji Trophy in Salem on Sunday.Left-arm spinners Ajith Ram and R Sai Kishore shared eight wickets between them as Chandigarh were bowled out for 193 while chasing an imposing target of 403 on the final day.Veteran Manan Vohra remained unbeaten on 100, but eight of his teammates failed to reach double digits. With 25 points from six games, Tamil Nadu now need just one point from their final group match against Jharkhand in Jamshedpur to secure their qualification for the next stage.Group D has presented some intriguing possibilities with an open-ended points table. Despite the defeat, Chandigarh remains in contention with 19 points and a final game against Chattisgarh in Raipur.They need to win outright or with a bonus point to stay in the race for the knock-out stages. A first innings lead could be insufficient for them, considering the quality of opposition in the last round for Tamil Nadu and Saurashtra.Saurashtra, which beat Delhi in just one and half days, are currently third in the table with 18 points and have the best chance of getting another seven against Assam on an under-prepared track at Rajkot.If Tamil Nadu lose their match outright and Saurashtra win with bonus points, both will be on 25 points, and the NRR will decide the outcome.As far as Delhi and Railways are concerned, they both need bonus points in theory, but that might not be enough in the end. The final round of matches will determine the teams that progress to the knock-out stages of the Ranji Trophy.Tamil Nadu 301 and 305/5.

Seamers Mukesh Choudhary and Rajneesh Gurbani put on a stunning display as Maharashtra crushed Baroda by a massive 439 runs in their Group A Ranji Trophy match on Sunday. The result has kept the defending champions, Mumbai, in contention for the knock-out stage.Baroda's primary goal on the final day was to save the game and secure a point, as chasing the target of 617 was virtually impossible. However, they failed to do so and were bundled out for a mere 177 in 36 overs.Former CSK left-arm seamer Choudhary claimed 5 wickets for 76 runs, while Gurbani, who recently switched from Vidarbha to Maharashtra, picked up 3 for 54.

Mumbai, despite their defeat to J&K on Saturday, remain on 22 points from six games.Ruturaj Gaikwad's Maharashtra has given the 42-time champions a lifeline, as Baroda will now need to secure at least a first innings lead against Jammu and Kashmir in their final game to qualify for the knock-out stages.If Baroda manages to get three points, both Baroda and Jammu and Kashmir will qualify with 30 points each, leaving Mumbai out of the competition in the group league stage itself.Mumbai, who will play against the wooden spooners Meghalaya in their last match at BKC, are expected to win comfortably and add another seven points to their tally, taking it to 29 from seven games.However, for Mumbai to qualify, they will need Jammu and Kashmir to at least take a first innings lead, if not win outright, which would take J&K's tally to 32, leaving Baroda stuck at 28.In the event that Jammu and Kashmir lose and remain on 29 points, and Mumbai win with bonus points, the net run rate (NRR) will be the deciding factor.The other five teams in the group - Tripura, Maharashtra, Meghalaya, Services, and Odisha - have no chance of qualification.","Mukesh Choudhary and Rajneesh Gurbani take five wickets each as Maharashtra crush Baroda by 439 runs in their Group A Ranji Trophy match on Sunday.

Barcelona scored their first four goals in 24 minutes and ended up hammering seven past a struggling Valencia for a commanding 7-1 victory on Sunday to give a much-needed impetus to their La Liga campaign.At the break, Barcelona were sitting at a handsome 5-0 lead. Fermin Lopez netted twice in the first half, while Frenkie de Jong, Ferran Torres and Raphinha also scored.The result marked Barcelona's second victory in last nine league fixtures. Hansi Flick's team now sits seven points behind La Liga leaders Real Madrid and three points adrift of second-placed Atletico Madrid.In the second half of the match, Hugo Duro managed to score for Valencia, before Robert Lewandowski added to Barcelona's tally, followed by a Cesar Tarrega own goal.Flick altered his team selection against Valencia, seeking to address the club's recent disappointing domestic results.The manager opted to rest Lewandowski and Ronald Araujo from the starting line-up and Pedri was unavailable due to stomach issues, allowing De Jong, Ferran Torres and the impressive Lopez to start.The comprehensive victory was a fair reflection of Barcelona's dominance, while dealing a significant blow to Carlos Corberan's Valencia, who remain in the 19th position, four points adrift of safety.Meanwhile, fourth-placed Athletic Bilbao failed to capitalise at home, managing only a goalless draw against Leganes, leaving them two points behind Barcelona.In other matches, Getafe boosted their survival hopes with a convincing 3-0 victory at Real Sociedad, moving up to 14th position, whilst Rayo Vallecano mounted a comeback to defeat Girona 2-1.","Barcelona thrashed Valencia 7-1 in La Liga on Sunday.

McManaman on Thomas Tuchel as the new England coach

MUMBAI: Things could hardly be going any better for Liverpool at the moment, be it domestically or in Europe. The Reds sit proudly atop the standings of both, the Premier League as well as the Uefa Champions League. In the latter, they are the only team in the revamped 36-club competition to have won each of their seven games so far.It’s the kind of position not many might have expected Liverpool to be in considering the arrival of a new manager in Arne Slot last summer following the end of a successful era under Juergen Klopp. “An incredible six months”, was how former Liverpool star Steve McManaman would describe it, though, he would also strike a cautious note saying it’s “the last four months” which would ultimately count.“I think the new manager and the coaching staff have been amazing, and the players as well,” McManaman, who is in India on an invitation from Standard Chartered for the SC Cup corporate football tournament, told The Times of India here on Saturday. “I didn’t think it’d be a huge transition because the team last year were very good. Of course, Juergen leaving was a blow at the time, but the new manager has come in and the team have responded really well.”The 52-year-old former England international put the exceptional start down to the solid foundations built during the Klopp era, which, he said, have helped Slot’s cause, as well as players getting better with experience, citing the examples of Ryan Gravenberch, Dominik Szoboszlai and Alexis Mac Allister. “The younger players have got more experience, so they’ve become better players. So all in all, I think they’ve all responded really well to the season, but I didn’t think that they’d be top of the league by six points with a game in hand and win seven from seven in the Champions League. So they’ve surprised me in that respect,” McManaman said.“When Juergen left, I think the foundations within Liverpool were exceptional, and Arne Slott has picked it up. We haven’t won any trophies yet this year, so it’s important not to go crazy. At this moment in time, he’s had an incredible six months, but the last four months are the most important months, starting with the League Cup second leg in a couple of weeks time against Tottenham (Liverpool lost the away leg 1-0).”But could the uncertainty surrounding the futures of key players like Mohamed Salah , Trent Alexander-Arnold and Virgil van Dijk be a stumbling block in the path of a team, who, according to McManaman, have the depth to “conceivably do the quadruple”?“The Mo Salah situation, Trent, Virgil van Dijk doesn’t bother me in the least. It won’t distract them. As a professional footballer, you want to be successful,” McManaman, a former Champions League winning midfielder with Real Madrid, said, adding: “In 2021, we had Mo Salah, (Roberto) Firmino and Sadio Mane in the same situation and they were going for the quadruple that year as well. So, no, I don’t think the contract situation is an issue at all.“I think Mo Salah wants to win every single trophy he can, including the Ballon d’or, including the leading goalscorer, the Golden Boot. So he won’t be thinking about his contract situation. That’s just secondary.”As well as it’s going at Anfield, it’s a different picture playing out at the Etihad, where defending champions Manchester City, the club which marked the final stop in McManaman’s playing career, are attempting to salvage their season after experiencing a shocking slump.While some pundits believe the long-term ACL injury suffered by Ballon d’Or winner Rodri has laid bare City’s lack of midfield recruitment in recent transfer windows, McManaman said the negative run could not be explained by the Spaniard’s absence alone.“I think it's a number of things. You can't lose games just because you lose one football player. I think Kevin de Bruyne was out at the same time, which didn't help. They had a number of issues defensively, which didn't help. And when I spoke about Liverpool getting a year more experience, the young kids getting a year older, maybe the Manchester City players are just getting older, that's all!“They've set such a high benchmark over the last four years, five years, that any decline is jumped upon. I still think they'll qualify for the Champions League (playoffs). They need to beat Club Brugge (on Wednesday). If they do that, they'll qualify and then you'll see probably a different Manchester City team. But, yeah, it's only because their standards have been incredibly high that any dip is pounced upon by the media,” said McManaman.“I personally would prefer an English manager to manage England. I know the FA did not speak to Eddie Howe. I know they didn't speak to Graham Potter. I know they didn't speak to a number of English players which was surprising. They thought Thomas Tuchel was the best man for the job, so fair enough, and I hope he wins the World Cup, I hope he's successful. But the fact that he's only got an 18-month contract suggests that after the World cup he might leave if he doesn't win the World Cup. So I don't know what the ins and outs is, but my personal preference would have been an English manager to represent the English national team.”",Steve McManaman says Liverpool have had an 'incredible six months' The former England international is in India for the SC Cup corporate football tournament. He says the uncertainty surrounding the futures of key players like Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk won't distract them.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117580458,imgsize-43272,width-400,resizemode-4/117580458.jpg"
