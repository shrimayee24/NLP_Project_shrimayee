India's two centurions from day three of the first Test against Bangladesh in Chennai, Rishabh Pant and Shubman Gill , not just entertained the crowd at the MA Chidambaram Stadium but also had a good time on the crease teasing each other, besides pummeling the bowlers.In one such incident shared by Shubman Gill after the close of play on Saturday, whenever either of them hit a boundary, Pant would hit Gill's bat hard with his.While that's normal for a batsman to do as a way of congratulating his partner in the middle, Gill had his reasons to ask Pant to stop doing it.""I was telling him not to because I was playing with a bat that I played the England series with, so my bat is quite old actually,"" said Gill at the press conference after play ended.But Pant, who is a character that keeps his teammates entertained, didn't listen.""He was hitting my bat so hard, I was telling him that I am trying to save my bat. But if he didn't middle it (hit well), he would say 'no, let's do it again'. Bro, calm down!"" a smiling Gill said, much to the delight of the reporters in the room.The duo added 167 runs for the third wicket, with Pant making 109 on his return to Test cricket since his car accident in December 2020. Gill was 119 not out when captain Rohit Sharma decided to declare India's second innings at 287 for 4, giving them a massive overall lead of 514.Facing a daunting target in the fourth innings, Bangladesh, who made 149 in their first innings in response to India's 376, were 158 for 4 at stumps on the third day.Offspinner Ravichandran Ashwin, who got India out of jail in the first innings with a century, did the bulk of the damage by taking three wickets.Skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto led the fight for the visitors with an unbeaten 51, with Shakib Al Hasan (5*) partnering him at close of play.","Rishabh Pant and Shubman Gill both scored centuries on day three of the first Test.

The third day's play of the first India-Bangladesh Test was no different as bad light forced the early stumps in Chennai.The match came to a halt on Saturday evening when the two on-field umpires decided to suspend play due to the arrival of dark clouds from the beach side, causing poor visibility on the ground.In response to the situation, India captain Rohit Sharma approached the umpires to inquire about the possibility of employing spinners to continue the game.However, it was Mohammed Siraj who came up with an unusual suggestion, which left his teammates and the umpires amused and chuckling.Umpire Rod Tucker suddenly stopped the game in the 38th over due to bad light that prompted Rohit to ask whether he could use spinners.Siraj was seen honing his spin bowling skills, which piqued the interest of the commentators. They wondered whether the Indian skipper would be bold enough to utilize this option.Siraj's self-assurance was evident as he approached Rohit, spinning the ball in his hand, and proposed an idea. However, when the umpires conveyed Siraj's suggestion to Rohit, the captain dismissed it with a chuckle, stating, ""He can't bowl spin."" The response elicited laughter from both the players and the match officials.Earlier in the month, England pacer Chris Woakes was forced to bowl off-spin due to bad light on the second day during the third and final Test against Sri Lanka at the Kennington Oval.Bangladesh started their 515-run chase briskly but lost wickets to reach 158-4 when bad light stopped play on day three, with the visitors still needing 357 for a win.","Third day's play of first India-Bangladesh Test stopped due to bad light.

Cricket holds a special place in the hearts of millions across India, with fans passionately following every move of their favorite cricketers. Legends like Sachin Tendulkar , Mahendra Singh Dhoni, and Virat Kohli enjoy massive fanbases, with their fame reaching almost mythical proportions within the country. However, this intense recognition doesn't always extend beyond India's borders, as a recent viral video highlights.A video recently surfaced on Instagram that caught the attention of cricket enthusiasts.The clip, shot in a foreign country, features a host stopping random passersby, asking them if they know who Virat Kohli is or if they've even heard of cricket. Much to the shock of Indian fans, the responses were overwhelmingly negative.In the video, the host begins by asking two men, ""Do you know who Virat Kohli is?"" Both men, without hesitation, admit they have no idea who the cricket star is. The host then turns to a woman and poses the same question, ""Have you heard of Virat Kohli?"" Initially confused, she too confirms that she’s unfamiliar with the name.The video continues as the host approaches more people, asking the same questions. Each time, the answer remains the same—none of the individuals interviewed had ever heard of Virat Kohli or cricket. This highlights the stark difference in the sport's popularity within India and globally. While Kohli is revered as a cricketing superstar in his homeland, cricket remains a relatively niche sport in many other parts of the world, where other sports like soccer or basketball dominate.Since being posted, the video has garnered over 1.6 million views on Instagram and sparked a flood of reactions. Thousands of users have liked, shared, and commented on the post, expressing everything from surprise to amusement.One user quipped, ""If you ask about Ronaldo, they'll know,"" referring to the global fame of football icons like Cristiano Ronaldo, whose recognition transcends borders. Another user called Virat Kohli ""the king"" in the comments, showcasing the immense pride Indian fans take in their cricket stars.A user named Suraj pointed out the obvious cultural divide, stating, ""When cricket isn’t famous worldwide, how will they know Virat Kohli?""

Top Picks For You India vs Bangladesh, 1st Test: Gill, Pant strike centuries before Ashwin grabs three to leave Bangladesh facing heavy defeat

CHENNAI: Stats don't necessarily reveal the entire story, but they do leave an indicator. So, when Rishabh Pant matches MS Dhoni 's six-Test-centuries feat — achieved over 90 Tests — in just 34 games, it's a very special achievement indeed. The Pant story is all the more special because of the cruel turn that life had taken on a wintry morning in 2022.Lucky to be alive after a car accident, not too many gave him a chance to play top-flight cricket again, let alone play Tests.Pant's comeback story is well documented. His return in the last IPL was a tale of determination while his role as a No. 3 batter on the most difficult pitches of the T20 World Cup spoke volumes of his grit. There were still doubts whether his body would be able to take the rigours of five-day cricket, but after Saturday, all those speculations have been put to rest. The comfort with which he batted against the Bangladesh bowlers showed that the cobwebs in the mind have been taken care of. Shubman Gill , who has seen him from close quarters and shared a 167-run partnership on Saturday, said that it was special to see Pant score the comeback ton. ""I've spent a lot of time with him on and off the field and watching him score his first 100 after his comeback gives me so much pleasure. I've seen him work so hard for it when he was coming back from the injury and I think he also must be feeling really good,"" Gill said.A couple of months ago in New York, as India were preparing for a game against Pakistan, the pitch in one of the nets had so much variable bounce that most batters refused to bat there. But Pant asked the throwdown expert to hurl the white ball at him from 18 yards on that pitch. He kept getting hit on the body, but connected a few as well with the bat. While Pant was trying to get used to the short ball, he was also trying to test his pain threshold, and now we can see all the hard work has paid off.While former coach Rahul Dravid was effusive in his praise of Pant, current boss Gautam Gambhir , too, had a lot of good things to say about the dynamite that he possesses in his arsenal. ""He's got runs everywhere around the world, and not many wicket-keepers of that age have done it so consistently in red-ball cricket . It is always good to have someone like him who can open the game for us, and more importantly, can bring a lot of impact as well,"" Gambhir had said before the Test.As we keep discussing about Pant the batter, sometimes we forget how well he has kept on Indian pitches as well. In this Test too, he has looked in top shape and his glovework has been on point. ""Probably his batting overshadows his 'keeping many times. It's not easy to keep against the likes of Ashwin, Jadeja and Kuldeep on Indian conditions and what he has done behind the stumps has been remarkable as well,"" Gambhir said.For Pant, things can only get better from here and we all believe the best is yet to come.",Rishabh Pant matches MS Dhoni's six-Test-centuries feat in just 34 games.

Former World chess champion Vladimir Kramnik tried to create some flutter in the ninth round of the Chess Olympiad on Friday but the authorities dealt with the issue swiftly and restored normalcy.Uzbekistan captain Kramnik, 49, complained about the presence of mobile phones on the Indian boards which are used to relay video recording for the live webcast.The Russian cited a rule in the FIDE handbook and claimed that it states that no electronic device can be allowed inside the playing hall. He added he was fine with just the video camera but not with the phone using video recording mode since data can be transmitted via bluetooth and other technological advancements. Without claiming that players were cheating by taking help from outside, he said that the bluetooth was on.However, Bojana Bejatovic, secretary of the FIDE Fair Play Commission, clarified that the cell phone fixed for D Gukesh vs Nodirbek Abdusattorov game was taken away for inspection on Kramnik’s request.""We found nothing wrong or suspicious with the cell phone. It was not connected, there was no SIM card. The bluetooth and Wifi were not on. We switched on the bluetooth, checked history and found everything to be satisfactory. No rule was broken. The phone was used as just a filming object,"" she told Chess24 and Chessbase India webcast. ""The phone was taken back to the playing hall and the video transmission was allowed.""Bejatovic also made it clear that the rule of not carrying electronic devices without prior permission is only for the players and captains and there are different regulations for the media. Chessbase India and organisers have a contract (for using phones for video transmission) and all the correct procedures were followed, she added.Kramnik said that it was his duty as captain of defending champions Uzbekistan to protect his players but he failed to furnish any proof as to how their interest was compromised. The Uzbek team did not lodge any protest about the incident either.Former seven-time national champion Praveen Thipsay said, ""Actually, a protest can be made only against Arbiter’s ruling on a game situation etc. Permitting a phone is not in the scope of Arbiter’s powers. There is a Fair Play Team which checks this.""India-Uzbekistan matchup was a pivotal contest in the ninth round. India had drawn with the eventual champions in the last edition as Gukesh stretched the winning position against Abdusattorov and lost on the top board. But India played with maturity on Friday and kept their march towards the gold medal alive.Kramnik had dethroned Garry Kasparov from the World chess throne in the 2000 match. But the Russian was accused of cheating by challenger Veselin Topalov for his frequent visits to the toilet during their epic unification match in 2006.

Najmul Hossain Shanto (51) and Shakib Al-Hasan (5) were at the crease for Bangladesh when the umpires called off play.The day could have been better for Bangladesh if they had been more careful with their shots against R Ashwin , who took 3 for 63.Pant and Gill’s centuries were the highlights of the day as they overcame personal challenges to shine on third day.Pant's struggles have been well-documented, especially following a severe car crash in December 2022. His reaction to reaching his sixth Test hundred with a two off Shakib Al-Hasan highlighted the significance of this innings to him. Pant stood in the middle of the pitch with closed eyes, head tilted upwards, and bat raised, possibly offering a silent prayer for his return to cricket.Gill watched from a distance, respecting Pant's private moment.Soon after, the two embraced warmly as the crowd at Chepauk cheered.The moment also paid tribute to Pant equaling MS Dhoni's record for the most Test hundreds by an Indian wicketkeeper-batsman -- six.Gill's struggles were more mental than physical, primarily due to a lack of confidence in the traditional format.Since scoring a century against England in Visakhapatnam earlier this year, Gill showed progress, further validated by his fifth Test hundred, achieved with a single off Mehidy Hasan Miraz.While Gill started at 33 overnight and Pant at 12, their emotions were kept aside as they focused on tackling the Bangladesh bowlers with contrasting styles.Pant began cautiously, looking to get his eye in before opening up. The turning point came when he pulled off-spinner Miraz for a four around the first drinks break of the day. From then on, Pant's dismantling of Miraz was a constant as he reached his fifty off 88 balls.After reaching fifty, Pant showcased some of his trademark shots.Pant's movements around the crease resembled a trapeze artist, and his scooped six over fine leg off Hasan Mahmud thrilled the crowd.He was dropped on 72 by Shanto off Shakib but continued to push forward. He eventually completed his century before offering a return catch to Mehidy.Gill's batting was marked by minimalism, with precise shots rather than extravagant strokes. His short-arm pull or the punch through the covers, often executed against pacers Nahid Rana and Hasan, didn't look conventional but were effective.Gill then added another 53 runs off 51 balls with KL Rahul for the fifth wicket, pushing India's lead past 500.Facing a significant chase, Bangladesh applied themselves better than in the first innings. Shanto played a key role in their resistance. However, some of his teammates, Zakir Hasan (33) and Shadman Islam (35), lost their wickets to poor shot selection.Shanto remained steady, hitting Ashwin for three sixes, including one that brought up his fifty off 56 balls.The final session was played under floodlights due to deteriorating light conditions.","Rishabh Pant and Shubman Gill score emotional centuries on third day of first Test.

However, it was the reactions of captain Rohit Sharma and umpire Richard Kettleborough that captured even more attention on social media.Kohli was trapped by Bangladesh spinner Mehidy Hasan Miraz for 17 on Friday. After umpire Kettleborough raised his finger in favour of the bowler, Kohli opted against reviewing the decision.However, UltraEdge later revealed a spike-there was an inside edge, and even Kohli wasn't aware of it.Kohli's costly error left Rohit visibly baffled, as he appeared frustrated with Kohli's decision not to take the DRS review. And Kettleborough couldn't help but smile upon realizing that the star Indian batter had made a blunder.During the final innings of the first Test on Saturday, Kohli approached Kettleborough for a brief conversation.

Daniel Dubois knocks out Anthony Joshua to retain IBF world heavyweight title,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/boxing/daniel-dubois-knocks-out-anthony-joshua-to-retain-ibf-world-heavyweight-title/articleshow/113562589.cms,"(Reuters Photo)

Daniel Dubois successfully defended his IBF world heavyweight championship by delivering a devastating fifth-round knockout against fellow Briton Anthony Joshua in a thrilling encounter at Wembley Stadium on Saturday night. The event drew a passionate crowd of 96,000 spectators.From the opening bell, the 27-year-old champion asserted his dominance, flooring the former two-time heavyweight titleholder on multiple occasions.Dubois had previously expressed his resolve to ""legitimise"" his reign as IBF champion, having been awarded the title vacated by Oleksandr Usyk in June.The challenger's powerful performance raises serious doubts about Joshua's boxing future, although his promoter, Eddie Hearn, indicated that he anticipates Joshua will seek a rematch.Despite entering the fight as the underdog, Dubois relentlessly pursued his renowned opponent from the outset, with his heavy punches visibly affecting the 2012 London Olympic champion throughout the contest.In a gripping fifth round filled with intense action, Dubois landed the fight-ending punch, having weathered some concerning moments himself as Joshua finally found his rhythm.The victory solidifies Dubois' position as a formidable force in the heavyweight division.""Are you not entertained?"" he said, speaking to DAZN after the biggest win of his 24-fight career. It's been a journey and I'm grateful to be in this position. I'm a gladiator, I'm a warrior until the bitter end. I want to get to the top of this sport and reach my full potential.""Before the explosive fireworks display over Wembley, Liam Gallagher of Oasis energized the eager audience with a three-song live performance.In a thrilling opening round, the British opponents clashed, culminating in Joshua being rescued by the bell after being knocked down by a vicious overhand right.Joshua, weighing 1.8 kilograms more than his younger rival, was in complete survival mode in the second round. Dubois floored him again in the third round with a left hook that caused his legs to give way.Following a standing eight count, the bell rang, and as the fourth round commenced, Joshua hit the canvas for the third time, despite his objection that it was not a valid knockdown.The fifth round was action-packed, with Dubois briefly stunned by two right hands. As Joshua attempted to capitalize on the situation, he was caught by consecutive right hands and found himself on the canvas once more, this time unable to beat the count.Both boxers stepped into the ring with the goal of securing a chance to face Tyson Fury or Usyk for the undisputed world championship.Usyk achieved a historic feat in May by becoming the first boxer to hold all four major heavyweight titles simultaneously, including the IBF, WBO, WBC, and WBA belts, after defeating Tyson Fury.Instead of facing the mandatory IBF challenger, Dubois, Usyk opted for a rematch with Fury. Dubois won the interim IBF title in June and was elevated to world champion status when Usyk vacated the belt.Joshua had aspirations of joining the prestigious group of three-time heavyweight champions, which includes legendary figures such as Muhammad Ali, Lennox Lewis, and Evander Holyfield. However, Joshua's career took a significant hit after suffering defeats against Andy Ruiz in 2019 and two subsequent losses to Usyk.Despite bouncing back with four consecutive victories, Joshua aimed to reclaim his position at the top of the heavyweight division.Following his devastating loss to Dubois at Wembley, which marked his fourth defeat in 32 professional bouts, Joshua suggested he would continue his boxing career, but the setback will undoubtedly require introspection and careful consideration of his future in the sport.""We came up short as a team,"" he said. ""You know I'm ready to kick off in the ring but I'm going to keep it respectful. Before I came here, I always say to myself I'm a fighter for life. You keep rolling the dice. I had a fast and sharp opponent, a lot of mistakes from my end.""","Daniel Dubois successfully defended his IBF world heavyweight championship by delivering a devastating fifth-round knockout against fellow Briton Anthony Joshua.

CHENNAI: There's been an air of inevitability about this Test match since the time Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja had that partnership of 199 in the first innings. On Saturday afternoon in fading light, the duo was in ‘let's finish the Test today' mode after the young entertainers Rishabh Pant and Shubman Gill had raced away to their centuries.But captain Rohit Sharma felt he needed a bit of variety and decided to introduce paceman Mohammed Siraj The light meter came in immediately, the light was offered, and Bangladesh lived to fight another day.Chasing 515 for victory, Bangladesh were 158-4 and not looking too comfortable against the spinners when the third day's play was called off due to bad light. Ashwin (3-63) was in his element, causing maximum damage while Jadeja was looking threatening with turn from the rough outside the left-hander's off-stump.But they will have to come back on Sunday and finish the job as captain Najmul Hossain Shanto (51 batting) and Shakib Al Hasan (5 batting) will try to battle on. There's a bit of rain round the corner, but the excellent MA Chidambaram Stadium drainage should allow enough game time for India to wrap things up.In fact, it was the drainage which had a role in the match starting at the right time after some strong showers in the early hours of Saturday. Under a murky sky, it was on Pant and Gill to entertain the weekend crowd and how well they did it.The lead, of course, was already over 300 and there wasn't too much pressure on the duo. The two young guns gave themselves a little bit of time to get set, apprehending a bit of moisture on the pitch. But it didn't take them too long to find out that it might not be that threatening after all and they launched into their shots.Shubman looks beautifully balanced at the crease and when the lateral movement isn't too alarming, he looks crisp on both sides of the wicket. The drives that he plays on the up are a thing of beauty and the Bangladesh pacers who got the better of him in the first innings were soundly beaten on Saturday.And when it comes to playing spin, he is as good as anybody in the business. His use of the feet, the way he dances down the track, makes it a treat and the weekend crowd had its share of fun as the 25-year-old raced away to his fifth Test ton.The biggest round of applause was reserved for the Delhi boy with whom Gill shared the 167-run partnership off 36.1 overs. Everyone loves a beautiful story and there's none better than Pant's, who matched Chennai's beloved MS Dhoni's record of the highest number of centuries by an Indian wicketkeeper in Tests.This was Pant's first Test since his comeback from a life-threatening injury a couple of years ago. And the wicketkeeper-batter hasn't put a foot wrong so far in this game. The Saturday show once again was an exhibition of his versatility as he brought his 360 degree game to the fore. The bowling was lacking the bite and Najmul dropped one sitter that he offered on 72, but that doesn't take anything away from the shots he played.The best thing about Pant's batting is that the bowler at times feels helpless. If one ball is hit over the bowler's head, the next one can be a pick-up shot over fine-leg. The crowd got ecstatic when all those shots came off and when the century came with a punch on the off-side, Pant looked up at the sky. The gods up there might also have been cheering for the boy who never gave up.",Rishabh Pant and Shubman Gill raced away to their centuries.

Playing in the air and hitting sixes actually came a bit later when I got a little bit more power in my body.

This confirmation aligns with Pant's stellar performance, scoring a century in the ongoing Test match against Bangladesh in Chennai.The decision also dismisses rumors of disagreements between Pant and the Capitals' management concerning his retention fee, which had previously clouded his future with the franchise.Although the BCCI has yet to announce the official retention rules, sources within Delhi Capitals have informed Cricbuzz that Pant will be their top retention choice.This choice was made after a recent meeting between Pant and co-owner Parth Jindal in Mumbai. Pant's current IPL salary stands at Rs 16 crore, a figure expected to rise following new retention fee guidelines from the BCCI.Pant, who captained the side last year but missed the 2023 season due to an accident, has returned to cricket with remarkable form. Both his batting and wicket-keeping have been sharp, as evidenced by his 109-run inning at the Chepauk Stadium.In the 2024 IPL season, his comeback year, Pant has impressed with 446 runs in 13 games, at a striking rate of 155. Pant also holds the record for the highest runs scored for the franchise, totaling 3284 runs.It appears that the management has also finalized other retention decisions. If the BCCI allows more than five players to be retained, Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav are expected to stay, followed by Jake Fraser-McGurk and Tristan Stubbs as the designated overseas players. Additionally, if uncapped player retentions are allowed, 21-year-old wicketkeeper-batsman Abhishek Porel is likely to be retained.Delhi Capitals' two co-owners, the GMR and JSW Groups, manage the franchise alternately every two years. Currently, the GMR Group is in charge. While each co-owner has the freedom to manage the team independently, decisions on retentions and auctions are made jointly through mutual agreement.","Rishabh Pant will remain with the Delhi Capitals.

However, he had a tough time as Rishabh Pant hit him for six fours and two sixes.This has been a challenging year for Shakib, who has managed to score just 295 runs in 18 innings across all formats with an average of 19.66, including one fifty.Additionally, he has taken 18 wickets at an average of 39.88, with best figures of 4/35.Karthik, who was handling broadcasting duties for the match, mentioned to ESPNCricinfo that Shakib has undergone finger surgery on his bowling hand.""Having seen him and known him for such a long period of time, I did go up to him and ask the reason why he has not bowled enough. And the thing which he said to me is something I completely resonate with. He has had a finger surgery on his bowling finger, which is the point of his finger of his left hand. It is swollen, it is rigid, there is no movement, no suppleness to it. So he feels he is not getting any feeling out of it. As a spinner you need the feeling. Also he is having issues with his shoulder so it is a combination of both and it's tough to bowl in Test cricket where you need that feel as a spinner,"" said Karthik.Shakib sustained a left index finger injury during a match against Sri Lanka in the 50-over World Cup last year, sidelining him for a few months.He also had an eye issue that delayed his return to the Bangladesh team until March this year.Former Bangladesh captain Tamim Iqbal stated that if Bangladesh picked Shakib despite his injuries, they are essentially playing with one bowler less.""Murali Kartik said that Shakib is having trouble gripping the ball due to this finger injury. If that is the case, Bangladesh are playing with four frontline bowlers. The team management should inform whether they knew about this injury or not,"" Tamim said.However, Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) chief physician Dr. Debashish clarified that they are unaware of any recent discomfort in Shakib's finger or shoulder.""Shakib had a fracture in his finger from the World Cup in India. Before that, he had an infection from another finger injury a few years ago. Shakib,, though has not recently complained about a finger or shoulder injury. A broken finger however can cause discomfort,"" he concluded.",Murali Karthik reveals Shakib Al Hasan is experiencing discomfort in his finger and shoulder.

Pant made his comeback in the IPL and participated in the victorious T20 World Cup, along with playing in Sri Lanka.""Test cricket isn't easy on the body after what Rishabh has had to go through. But all of us have now seen that his mental toughness is in a different league.""""If he is determined about something he will do it. He was hardly in Delhi, he mainly trained at the NCA and then played Duleep Trophy . I believe the NCA nets was for short duration but it was quality training before he played Duleep and gave a glimpse of his long format fitness,"" Devender said.""The kind of physical work that Rishabh has put in is phenomenal.

NEW DELHI: Former Indian cricketer Virender Sehwag , known for his aggressive batting style, saw opportunities where others saw risks. Sehwag aimed to score runs quickly throughout his career.Sehwag's record includes three triple centuries in Test cricket and becoming the second Indian, after Sachin Tendulkar , to score 200 runs in a One Day International (ODI). He set a record with 219 runs in an ODI , which stood for nearly three years until Rohit Sharma surpassed it with 264 runs.In the 2011 ODI World Cup, Sehwag set the tone for India's campaign with an impressive 175 runs in the first match. However, he did not start as an opening batsman. Sehwag began his Test career under Sourav Ganguly 's captaincy in 2001, debuting against South Africa in Bloemfontein, where he batted at the fourth position and scored a century.The decision to promote Sehwag to the opening position came later. At an Ocean Blue Academy event, Ganguly revealed the conversation that promoted him to be the opening batter.Sehwag's journey from a middle-order batsman to a prolific opener showcases the strategic decisions that shaped his illustrious career.Ganguly said, ""I was fortunate enough to captain a player like Virender Sehwag, a young boy who came from Delhi with absolute raw talent. A week before the start of the first Test, I went up to him and said, 'Viru, you’re such a fantastic player, but you’re not getting a game because we had Dravid at three, Tendulkar at four, myself at five, and Laxman at six.'""Ganguly continued, ""I said, 'You know, someone like you cannot just be sitting on the benches, so why don’t you open?' I could see it on his face—he couldn’t say no to me. His immediate response was, 'Dada, I have never done this.' I said, 'So what if you’ve never done this?' I knew his next question would be, 'What happens if I get out early with the new ball?'""""I said, 'You know, it doesn’t matter if you fail because you’re doing something for the team. You’re doing something out of your usual position, something you’ve never done before. So even if you don’t score runs as an opener, we will find an opportunity for you to bat down the order.'"" Ganguly added.""At the end of the conversation, he said, 'Can you write that on a piece of paper for me?'"" Ganguly concluded.",Former Indian cricketer Virender Sehwag is known for his aggressive batting style. He began his Test career under Sourav Ganguly's captaincy in 2001.

Kylian Mbappe , who has now scored in four straight matches for the club, added a late penalty to put the result beyond doubt.Meanwhile, league leaders Barcelona, boasting a 100% record with five wins from five games, face a tough test on Sunday as they visit fourth-placed Villarreal, who are yet to taste defeat this season.

""It's quality, character, commitment from the team, everyone is ready when called on... those are the key factors.""Carlo Ancelotti, the coach of Madrid, decided to rest Vinicius for the start of the match, given the team's busy schedule. Instead, he chose to play Arda Guler alongside Mbappe and Rodrygo.Throughout the first half, Madrid dominated the game but failed to score.

Joan Garcia, the Espanyol goalkeeper, made an impressive save at his near post to deny Mbappe's attempt from a tight angle.Following the corner, Eder Militao's header narrowly missed the target. Mbappe had another long-range effort stopped and also sliced a shot off-target. Growing increasingly frustrated, Mbappe received a booking for arguing against a decision made against him.Jude Bellingham struck a powerful shot from the edge of the box, but Garcia saved it comfortably, resulting in a goalless scoreline at halftime. Madrid has only managed to score one first-half goal in eight matches this season.In the second half, Carlos Romero's off-target strike provided a glimmer of hope for the newly-promoted visitors, but Madrid continued to dominate possession and create chances.However, in the 54th minute, Madrid were left stunned as Courtois inadvertently deflected Jofre Carreras' cross into his own net, giving the underdogs a surprising lead.Ancelotti quickly introduced Vinicius, but it was Carvajal who equalized just four minutes later, tapping in on the line after Bellingham's cross eluded the previously unbeatable Garcia.As Madrid intensified their pressure, Espanyol's defense eventually crumbled. Vinicius showcased his skill with a sublime outside-of-the-boot cross, setting up Rodrygo for Madrid's second goal.The Brazilian then turned provider, unselfishly playing Vinicius through on goal to score the third.

This win helped the Reds recover from last week's surprising 1-0 defeat to Nottingham Forest.In the first half, Diaz was in exceptional form. His dazzling performance on the left wing overshadowed Liverpool's occasional defensive lapses and effectively decided the match by halftime.Bournemouth initially thought they had taken the lead through Antoine Semenyo, but it was ruled offside after a VAR review.The Anfield crowd's initial apprehension turned into jubilation following the overturning of the goal.Diaz then took center stage, challenging Kepa Arrizabalaga with a fine save in the eighth minute and consistently posing a threat.

It was an inch perfect aerial ball from the right by Imran Khan and Murray, who started the game in place of Rei Tachikawa, timed his jump perfectly to head the ball into the net and score his second goal of the season.With their fans egging them on at the Furnace, JFC were in no mood to sit quietly, and they took the lead through Javi Hernandez eight minutes later.Imran once again played his part to win the foul just outside the box and Hernandez curled the ball into the left-bottom corner of the net directly from the free-kick.Mumbai goalkeeper Phurba Lachenpa should have done well to collect it but he failed to predict the cross.Even after the change of ends, Jamshedpur kept up the pressure and Hernandez scored his second of the night to make it 3-1 for the hosts. This time Seiminlen Doungel - brought in place of Mohammed Sanan at half-time - collected the ball from Murray, made the run down the left and laid it up for Hernandez, who ran in and blasted the ball into the net.At that moment it seemed that Jamshedpur had done enough to bag the win, but Mumbai weren't going down quietly. Petr Kratky’s men reduced the lead when Yoell van Nieff scored another superb goal in the 77th minute and then kept pressing for the equaliser.The match became quite physical at times and a total of nine yellow cards - 7 for JFC and 2 for MCFC - were shown as none of the two teams took their foot off the pedal. But after almost 10 minutes of injury time, the referee blew the final whistle as Jamshedpur earned their second successive win of the season.Earlier, even as Jamshedpur tried to take an early lead, it was Mumbai City who struck first and what a goal it was from their Greek striker Karelis.Collecting the ball in the midfield following a header, the No. 9 made a small run, made some space, and then fired the ball from the right into the top right corner of the net with his left foot from about 10 yards outside the box. It was certainly one of the goals of the tournament and goalkeeper Albino Gomes could do nothing to keep it out.In the next few minutes, Mumbai went all out in search of the second. Bipin Singh was outstanding on the left and along with Lallianzuala Chhangte and Karelis, the trio made life difficult for the Jamshedpur defenders.But the hosts did well to hold on and survive the onslaught.And once they got the opportunity to strike back, they pounced on it and scored the three goals.

However, he has shown strong form this season, already netting four goals in six appearances in all competitions.Chelsea have won all three of their away league matches this season, suffering just one defeat, which came against champions Manchester City in their five top-flight games.Despite reports of a power struggle between Chelsea co-owners Todd Boehly and Behdad Eghbali, Maresca, who took over from Mauricio Pochettino in the close-season, has made a positive impact.After finishing sixth and 12th in the last two seasons, there are signs that Maresca could guide Chelsea's costly but underperforming squad to become top-four contenders.West Ham's poor start under new boss Julen Lopetegui has put him under pressure, with fans expressing their frustration well before the final whistle.West Ham have managed just one win in their five Premier League outings, losing three consecutive home games to start the season.Chelsea kicked off quickly, with Jackson capitalizing on a defensive lapse in the fourth minute, taking Jadon Sancho's pass and beating Alphonse Areola easily.The goal marked Chelsea's earliest in a Premier League London derby since Daniel Sturridge’s strike against QPR in 2012.Jackson's dominance continued as he set up Cole Palmer for a shot that narrowly missed.Chelsea's pressure paid off again, with Jackson scoring in the 18th minute after a slick team move and a precise pass from Moises Caicedo.West Ham's Jarrod Bowen epitomized the team's struggles with a poor shot that soared over the bar from a promising position.Crysencio Summerville, making his first league start for West Ham, appealed for a penalty after a challenge from Wesley Fofana, but VAR dismissed the claims.Lopetegui showed his displeasure with his team's effort by substituting Argentina midfielder Guido Rodríguez before halftime.However, Rodríguez's replacement, Thomas Soucek, did not improve the team's fortunes, missing a chance to score by firing straight at Chelsea goalkeeper Robert Sanchez.Sancho, on loan from Manchester United, looked rejuvenated, causing problems for the West Ham defense with his dribbling. This was his first Premier League start since May 2023.Palmer sealed the win for Chelsea in the 47th minute, finishing past Areola after receiving a pass from Jackson.",Nicolas Jackson scored twice as Chelsea beat West Ham 3-0 at London Stadium. Cole Palmer added a third goal in the second half to secure the win. It was Chelsea's third win in five Premier League matches under new manager Enzo Maresca.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113554093,imgsize-49544,width-400,resizemode-4/113554093.jpg"
ISL: FC Goa look to regroup after opening shocker,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/isl-fc-goa-look-to-regroup-after-opening-shocker/articleshow/113541581.cms,"PANAJI: How Manolo Marquez wishes that he has all his players available for FC Goa ’s Indian Super League ( ISL ) clash against Mohammedan Sporting in Kolkata on Saturday.After the shock defeat at the hands of Jamshedpur FC at home early this week, the Goa coach was seething as he saw his side surrender the lead and then troop out empty handed. From a position of dominance at the start, the hosts were found wanting in the second half.That prompts the obvious question: will there be changes?""For sure, it won't be the same lineup,"" Manolo said during the pre-match media interaction on Thursday. ""I don't know whether it would be one or four changes.""Manolo will have to refresh his squad to get the campaign back on track. But with five players nursing injuries, the changes might only be cosmetic. Spanish midfielder Iker Guarrotxena, star defender Sandesh Jhingan and goalkeeper Lara Sharma are all recovering from surgeries. Mohammad Yasir and Alan Saji picked up injuries during the Bhausaheb Bandodkar Memorial Trophy. None of them are available, until after the FIFA international window ends on Oct 15.""When you lose one game, you remember the players who are unavailable. But that was not the reason (for the loss). The bench, and the players on the field, did not judge the situation correctly in the second half. The injured players cannot return before the window, but it's true that three of them -- Yasir, Sandesh and Iker -- will be available very soon, just after the break,"" said Manolo.Mohammedan were unlucky on their debut, conceding a last-gasp goal againstNorthEast United . The experienced Manolo knows he has to brace himself for another tough battle.""I liked everything about their game; the atmosphere on the pitch, the people at the stadium, everything was good. They were unlucky. I agree with (NEUFC coach Juan Pedro) Benali that Mohammedan will be a very difficult opponent this season. But, again, we won't be easy for them.""It is true that Mohammedan's pre-season was short, and you could see that. During the last minutes, they were very tired, with a lot of players having cramps. This is normal. They will get better after some games,"" said Manolo.Mohammedan qualified for the top tier after winning the I-League last season. It was coach Andrey Chernyshov who guided them to a title-triumph in the second tier of Indian football and he knows his defensive as well as offensive players will require more time to get accustomed to the opposition in ISL.""We need to improve in defensive situations, as well as in attacking ones,"" said Chernyshov. ""We try to change some situations and be better in the next match. It's not easy for players coming in from other countries to adapt quickly to the game here. Different players adapt differently to circumstances, some take less time and some more than that.""","FC Goa host Mohammedan Sporting in Indian Super League ( ISL) clash on Saturday. Goa lost their opening game of the season to Jamshedpur FC. Five players are out injured for Goa, including Iker Guarrotxena and Sandesh Jhingan.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113541576,imgsize-28708,width-400,resizemode-4/113541576.jpg"
ISL: Jamshedpur FC look to continue good show as champions Mumbai City FC come calling,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/isl-jamshedpur-fc-look-to-continue-good-show-as-champions-mumbai-city-fc-come-calling/articleshow/113541244.cms,"The last time Jamshedpur FC faced off against Mumbai City FC , they were battling for a playoffs spot in the last edition of Indian Super League ( ISL ) and had managed to earn a 1-1 draw after taking the lead at home. Jamshedpur though had to forfeit the game later on and Mumbai were awarded a 3-0 win by the AIFF disciplinary committee after the hosts finished the game with just six Indians on the field in place of seven.It was a big blow to the Men of Steel who were then on a brilliant streak after coach Khalid Jamil took charge midway into the season and looked to finish on a high.The verdict expectedly took the steam out of their campaign and they sadly finished second from the bottom of the table for the second consecutive season.However, Jamshedpur have made a dream start to the new season as they grabbed a comeback 2-1 win at FC Goa and will be looking to continue their winning run against defending champions Mumbai City at home on Saturday.While Jamshedpur’s performance at Fatorda Stadium wasn’t always impressive, they were able to do just enough to bag the win thanks to a brilliant goal from Jordan Murray in added time. The other goal was scored from the spot by Javi Siverio.But the win is in the past for coach Jamil as he wants the team to remain grounded for the next encounter. ""We must believe in ourselves in what we can do. We have to prepare, and we should not be overconfident. The next game is also a big game at our home ground. We have to be prepared, and we must get positive results,"" said the coach.Jamil, who also coached NorthEast United FC earlier, has an enviable record against the Islanders having lost only once in five matches and will certainly take confidence from that.Mumbai though will be a tough nut to crack. After winning the ISL trophy last season, Petr Kratky’s men are looking to bag their first win of the season on Saturday. They faced a difficult test against Mohun Bagan Super Giant in the opener in Kolkata and were able to deny the hosts a victory with a solid second-half performance which helped them overcome the two-goal first-half deficit for a 2-2 draw.Speaking ahead of the game, Mumbai City coach Kratky said, ""I wouldn’t say that playing away from home is a pressure. It’s a challenge that every footballer has to face. At the end of the day, we want fans to enjoy the game tomorrow, but hopefully we win the match.""However, Jamshedpur will surely hope to make life difficult for the visitors in front of their home crowd, who are expected to turn up in numbers at the Furnace for their first home match of the season.JFC, who for most part of the game against FC Goa were happy to stay back and defend, will likely have the same strategy for Mumbai but their goalkeeper Albino Gomes will have to put up a better show. Despite making some good saves in Goa, Gomes conceded in a terrible fashion and Jamil will be more than happy to not see anything remotely similar to that on Saturday.","Jamshedpur FC take on defending champions Mumbai City FC on Saturday. The last time the two sides met in the ISL, Mumbai won 3-0 at home. The Men of Steel finished second from the bottom of the table for the second consecutive season.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113541239,imgsize-76396,width-400,resizemode-4/113541239.jpg"

"Sumit Nagal asked for $50K pay rise, and AITA agreed, before Sweden tie",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/sumit-nagal-asked-for-50k-pay-rise-and-aita-agreed-before-sweden-tie/articleshow/113498053.cms,"PUNE: Does a professional athlete have the right to ask for fair compensation for representing the country, or should he be available unconditionally?Indian tennis tried to put a bat to this curve ball after it emerged that Sumit Nagal had asked to be paid $50,000 a year for playing Davis Cup in the lead-up to the World Group I tie against Sweden.""He (Nagal) asked for money, $50,000 (per year) for playing in Davis Cup,"" AITA honorary secretary Anil Dhupar informed TOI on Thursday.""His request was discussed in the Executive Committee meeting (on August 23) and there were two opinions.""Some members said that a player should be available without any conditions, others felt that instead of giving a fixed amount the extra money can be given as a bonus. If you win, you will get this much as a bonus, and if the team wins this much extra.""The committee then decided to authorize the captain to discuss it with the player.""Rajpal refused to comment on the matter but another member of the executive committee who attended the meeting confirmed, without revealing details, that Nagal's request was agreed to.An AITA source familiar with the subject said, ""It ($50,000) is roughly Rs. 40-45 lakh for two ties in a year. So essentially, he has asked for Rs. 20 lakh per tie, which I think is fine. A (No. 1) player gets anywhere around Rs. 7 to 12 lakhs at the moment.""As a standalone figure it might seem exorbitant, but to put it in perspective, a player earned $100,000 simply for turning up in the singles first round at the US Open this year. At the French Open, a first-round appearance made a player richer by 73,000-euros.It is also understood that Nagal had requested for a change in support staff attached to the Indian Davis Cup team. It is not clear whether he wanted both Rajpal (as captain by Mahesh Bhupathi) and Zeeshan Ali (as coach by Somdev Devvarman ) to be replaced, or only the latter. Devvarman is Nagal's mentor.The AITA subsequently appointed Ashutosh Singh as coach after Ali resigned.Nagal issued a detailed statement on the subject while also responding to the attack from the AITA that he skipped the Stockholm sojourn despite being fit.""It was a difficult decision to withdraw from the Davis Cup, as playing for the national team is a moment I cherish deeply. However, after consulting with my medical team, it became clear that competing while carrying an injury could not only jeopardize my health but also adversely impact the team’s chances,"" said Nagal, who on Thursday pulled out of the ATP 250 event in Hangzhou.""In professional sports, injury management is a complex science. Sometimes, just a few days of rest and targeted rehabilitation can make the difference between aggravating an injury and being fit to play again.""Regarding compensation, I want to clarify that it is standard practice in professional sports for athletes to be compensated for their participation in events, even when representing their country.""This is not about personal gain. My discussions with AITA and the Davis Cup Captain are confidential and I would not like to indulge in any speculation about this.""","Sumit Nagal had asked to be paid $50,000 a year for playing Davis Cup.
