A river again runs through UP’s parched Jalaun,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/a-river-again-runs-through-ups-parched-jalaun/articleshow/121196212.cms,"File photo

LUCKNOW: Farmers of Jalaun in UP’s parched Bundelkhand will not have to toil too much this season to get water for crops. They have almost revived an 81km-long local river that had dried up completely, four years after PM Modi extolled the mission in his Mann Ki Baat radio programme as a brilliant example of “people’s will doing wonders”.Community members have restored the drainage basin over a 14km course of Noon river to create a funnel through which water has again entered it. The river had dried up to encroachments and poor rainfall.The revival commenced in 2021 and reached the final stage only recently, with voluntary labour contributions from thousands of local men and women. Officials said the water would start flowing through the entire course of the river in a fortnight. The river is expected to help more than 15,350 farmers.PM Modi had pointed out that the formation of a committee of thousands of villagers from various panchayats in Jalaun set the ball rolling for the river’s revival.Noon meandered across 47 villages before merging with Yamuna on the other side of Jalaun. The river was earlier a key source of irrigation for agricultural fields spread over 2,780 hectares, as well as for animals looking for a waterbody in the dry region. But dwindling rainfall and sporadic construction activities changed the river’s contours, preventing water collected during the monsoon from funnelling down into the riverbed.Jalaun DM Rajesh Kumar Pandey noted that local politicians, social workers, and professionals played a crucial role in the river’s revival. “Having realised the consequences of unplanned activity, they all were equally committed to removing the hurdles and roadblocks that stalled the progress,” said Pandey.",Community members have restored the drainage basin over a 14km course of Noon river to create a funnel through which water has again entered it.

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 5: Shane Watson on how IPL gave him a lifeline & his tribute to Phil Hughes

NEW DELHI: A day after announcing his retirement from Test cricket, Indian batting legend Virat Kohli visited Vrindavan with his wife, Anushka Sharma , to seek guidance from the spiritual leader Premanand Maharaj. The couple visited Shri Hit Radha Keli Kunj Ashram in Vrindavan to receive blessings.Photos of Kohli and Anushka interacting with Premanand Maharaj in Vrindavan quickly went viral on social media.After leaving the ashram, Kohli was spotted exiting his car holding a Jaap counting machine . He waved to fans briefly before walking quietly into the airport.Kohli is set to take the field for Royal Challengers Bangalore in their IPL 2025 match against Kolkata Knight Riders on Saturday.On Monday, Kohli announced his retirement from Test cricket, marking the end of a stellar career in the longest format. He played 123 Tests for India, amassing 9,230 runs at an average of 46.85, including 30 centuries.As captain, Kohli led India to 40 wins in 68 Tests, the most by any Indian skipper to date.Former India coach Ravi Shastri described Kohli as “mentally fried and overcooked” due to constant public scrutiny. While surprised by Kohli’s decision to retire, Shastri believed the star batter still had two to three years left in Test cricket.Shastri also revealed that he had spoken to Kohli shortly before the announcement was made public.""I did speak to him about it, I think a week before that [his announcement] and his mind was very clear that he'd given us everything. There were no regrets,"" Shastri told The ICC Review.""Virat surprised me because I thought he had at least two-three years of Test match cricket left in him. But then, when you're mentally fried and overcooked, that's what tells your body. You might be physically the fittest guy in the business.""You might be fitter than half the guys in your team, but mentally you're well done, as they say, then it sends a message to the body. You know, that's it,"" he said.Opening up on their conversation, Shastri said Kohli's infectious personality and the constant spotlight he was under contributed to a burnout.""He's got accolades around the globe. He has a bigger following than any other cricketer in the last decade. Whether it's Australia, whether it's South Africa, he just got people to watch the game. There was a love-hate relationship.""They would get angry because he had the ability to get under the skin of the viewers. In the way he celebrated, you know his intensity was such that it was like a rash.""It spread very quickly, not just within the dressing room, but within living rooms as well for people watching cricket. So, he was an infectious personality,"" he added.","Virat Kohli visited Vrindavan to seek guidance from spiritual leader Premanand Maharaj. Kohli announced his retirement from Test cricket on Monday.

NFL Thanksgiving 2025: A star-studded holiday feast for Football fans



Tradition meets rivalry: Lions vs. Packers

Star power in the afternoon: Cowboys vs. Chiefs

Primetime fireworks: Ravens vs. Bengals

Thanksgiving and the NFL have long shared a bond that’s almost as iconic as turkey and pumpkin pie. What started in 1934 with Detroit Lions' former owner George A. Richards hosting the Chicago Bears has evolved into a national tradition. And in 2025, that tradition gets another thrilling chapter as the NFL sticks to its festive tripleheader format, bringing a mix of historical rivalry, emerging storylines, and MVP-worthy showdowns to fans across the country.The day kicks off, as always, in Detroit. The Lions, who’ve hosted Thanksgiving games every year since 1934—with the exception of 1939 to 1944 due to World War II—will face their age-old rivals, the Green Bay Packers. Slated for a 12:30 p.m. ET kickoff on Fox at Ford Field, this matchup carries rich historical weight. The Lions and Packers have squared off 22 times on Thanksgiving, with Detroit holding a slight edge at 12-9-1.Interestingly, Detroit has won six of their last seven encounters with Green Bay. However, it’s worth noting that the only loss in that stretch came on Thanksgiving in 2023, proving that this rivalry continues to deliver drama regardless of trends. The Packers may have the historical upper hand in their overall series, but the Lions' recent form and home-field advantage will give them hope for a strong holiday performance.When the clock strikes 4:30 p.m. ET, attention shifts to Arlington, Texas, where the Dallas Cowboys will host the Kansas City Chiefs at AT&T Stadium. Airing on CBS, this game may break from traditional rivalries, but it brings a compelling narrative of its own.The Cowboys have been synonymous with Thanksgiving since 1966, having missed the holiday game only twice in nearly six decades. They’re 34-22-1 in these contests—proof of how much they thrive under the national spotlight.This game, however, adds a unique layer of emotion and excitement. Patrick Mahomes, who grew up cheering for the Cowboys, will be playing his first Thanksgiving game—and his first-ever matchup in Dallas. The only previous meeting between Mahomes and Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott was back in 2021, where Mahomes led the Chiefs to a 19-9 win. With Mahomes now firmly established as one of the NFL’s brightest stars, the matchup has the makings of a holiday classic.Closing out the night at 8:20 p.m. ET on NBC, the Baltimore Ravens will host the Cincinnati Bengals in a prime-time divisional duel at M&T Bank Stadium. While these two teams have limited Thanksgiving experience—the Ravens are 2-0 and the Bengals 0-1—their recent head-to-head battles have been electric. Four of their last five matchups have ended in one-score games, offering a taste of the fireworks fans can expect on Thanksgiving night.This clash also features two marquee quarterbacks: Joe Burrow and two-time MVP Lamar Jackson. Both signal-callers are capable of turning any play into a highlight reel moment, and their showdown promises to be a fitting finale to a day filled with high-stakes football.With a schedule that blends tradition, rivalry, and star power, the NFL's 2025 Thanksgiving Day lineup is primed to deliver entertainment from noon to night. Whether it’s a historic divisional showdown or a new chapter in quarterback duels, football fans are in for a feast they won’t forget.Also Read: ""The Taylor Swift effect"": Kansas City Chiefs’ 2025 schedule fuels Swiftie buzz with must-watch primetime clashes early in the season","The 2025 NFL Thanksgiving schedule features a thrilling tripleheader with marquee matchups like Chiefs-Cowboys and Bengals-Ravens.

"""You'll never be as good as your dad"": How brutal criticism pushed Wayne Gretzky's son Ty Gretzky away from pro hockey",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/youll-never-be-as-good-as-your-dad-how-brutal-criticism-pushed-wayne-gretzkys-son-ty-gretzky-away-from-pro-hockey/articleshow/121163848.cms,"Wayne Gretzky son Ty Gretzky faced immense pressure growing up (Image via Instagram)

Being the son of “The Great One” came with more pressure than praise for young Ty Gretzky

Growing up in the shadow of hockey’s most iconic figure is no easy feat — just ask Ty Gretzky . As the eldest son of NHL legend Wayne Gretzky , Ty was never just another kid on the ice. Every shift, every goal, and every stumble came with a heavy dose of scrutiny — from teammates, rivals, and even strangers in the stands.In a candid 2006 interview with The New York Times, a 15-year-old Ty opened up about the harsh realities of being Wayne Gretzky’s son. “I get smack-talked all the time on the ice from other players,” he said. “Just like, ‘I thought you were going to be a lot better,’ stuff like that.”Even at a young age, Ty was dealing with the weight of impossible expectations. Despite having a passion for the game, his last name made it nearly impossible to play without comparison. Speaking to Thousand Oaks Acorn, he admitted to eventually removing his last name from his jersey in an effort to blend in: “Somehow people in the stands would just find out who I was and yell, ‘You’ll never be as good as your dad in hockey.’”The pressure didn’t stop there. During his second year playing center for a lower-tier team at Shattuck-St. Mary’s School — a well-known hockey academy — Ty managed four goals and six assists over 29 games. Still, his stats were often overshadowed by his surname. “It wasn’t just about playing hockey anymore,” Ty implied. “It became about living up to a legacy I didn’t ask for.”Ultimately, Ty chose not to pursue hockey professionally, but he never abandoned the game. Instead, he found a meaningful way to stay connected to the sport — and to his father. In 2014, he co-founded The Gretzky Hockey School alongside Wayne, creating a space where young players can develop their skills without the burden of comparison.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky's son Ty Gretzky’s Mother’s Day post hides a deeper message about family legacy Ty’s story is a poignant reminder that even in the world of sports royalty, carving out your own identity can be the biggest challenge of all.","Ty Gretzky is the eldest son of NHL legend Wayne Gretzki.

Pickens ignites the offense but Oweh could transform the defense



Why Odafe Oweh is FLASHING for the Baltimore Ravens

Dallas must act fast if Baltimore questions Oweh’s role



The Dallas Cowboys are back in the spotlight after pulling off a major trade for Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver George Pickens . The move immediately adds firepower to an offense that’s been searching for a consistent deep threat for Dak Prescott. But while the flashy headline caught fans' attention, it’s clear this roster needs more than offensive upgrades to make a serious Super Bowl run. If Dallas wants to finally break its postseason curse, the front office must turn its attention to the defensive side and specifically, to Baltimore Ravens edge rusher Odafe Oweh .Dallas got aggressive with the Pickens trade, sending a 2026 third-round pick to the Steelers. It’s a calculated gamble aimed at giving Prescott a reliable playmaker who can stretch the field. Yet while the offense just gained an explosive weapon, the defense still lacks a true counterpart to superstar Micah Parsons . And that’s where Odafe Oweh enters the conversation.Oweh quietly became one of the NFL’s most disruptive young defenders in 2024, finishing with 10 sacks, 48 quarterback pressures, and 31 defensive stops. He brings the kind of burst and edge speed that defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus would love to unleash alongside Parsons. Together, they could create one of the most feared pass-rushing duos in the league.Baltimore, however, may be at a crossroads. Oweh is entering the final year of his rookie contract, and the Ravens just spent a second-round pick on Marshall edge rusher Mike Green. While it would be surprising to see Baltimore move on from a player with Oweh’s upside, stranger things have happened when contract extensions and cap space come into play.Also Read: NFL’s iconic duo Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce aren’t what they used to be and NFL is noticing If there’s even a whisper that Oweh is available, Dallas needs to be on the phone. The Cowboys have added depth pieces like Kenneth Murray Jr. and Jack Sanborn this offseason, but those moves won’t swing playoff games. Oweh, on the other hand, could. The Cowboys have shown they’re not afraid to make bold moves. But if they want this year to be different, if they want the Pickens trade to mean something more then Odafe Oweh must be the next piece in the puzzle.","Odafe Oweh is entering the final year of his rookie contract.

Tom Brady’s voice shapes Raiders’ new direction

Poll Will the Raiders be playoff contenders this upcoming season? No, they will miss the playoffs Yes, they will make the playoffs

Tom Brady’s growing influence in the Las Vegas Raiders organization is already leading to significant changes, as the team released three players linebacker Amari Burney, defensive tackle Matthew Butler, and wide receiver Justin Marshall in an early roster overhaul. These moves reflect a shift in team culture and performance expectations under Brady’s emerging role.The Raiders waived the players in May 2025, just months after Tom Brady became a minority owner and increased his involvement in football operations. While the team has not officially linked the roster cuts to Brady, insiders indicate his voice is pushing for higher standards and a stronger competitive environment.The Raiders also parted ways with additional players including wide receivers Tyreik McAllister and Kristian Wilkerson, linebacker Brandon Smith, and offensive lineman Dominic Boyd. These moves reflect the organization’s intent to tighten the roster and raise the overall level of talent and readiness in the locker room.This roster trimming follows the Raiders’ recent additions of experienced defensive players, including veterans Jaylon Smith and Jonathan Sutherland. The team also signed promising newcomers such as edge rusher Jahfari Harvey, linebacker Wesley Steiner, and wide receivers Ketron Jackson Jr. and Key’Shawn Smith.These moves highlight a clear effort by the Raiders’ front office now led by head coach Pete Carroll and general manager John Spytek to bolster depth and competitiveness across key positions ahead of training camp.Amari Burney, the Raiders’ 2023 sixth-round pick, showed promise as a versatile linebacker over 24 games but was released to make room for players better suited to the team’s new direction.Matthew Butler, a 2022 fifth-round pick and respected defensive tackle, appeared in 15 games but was cut as the Raiders overhaul their defensive front.Wide receiver Justin Marshall, vying for a backup spot, was also let go as the team prioritizes players who can make an immediate impact.Brady, a seven-time Super Bowl winner, brings unparalleled leadership and a championship mindset to the franchise. His rising role as a part-owner and advisor is expected to influence roster decisions significantly as the Raiders aim to rebuild a winning culture.Sources suggest Brady is focused on accountability, discipline, and creating a competitive atmosphere conducive to sustained success.The team is undergoing broader changes beyond player cuts, including adjustments in coaching and management aimed at revitalizing the franchise. With the AFC West highly competitive, the Raiders are eager to re-establish themselves as playoff contenders.Though Brady has not publicly commented on the recent roster moves, the early releases signal that the Raiders are serious about aligning personnel with the new culture and expectations he represents. Fans can expect further roster activity as training camp approaches.Also read: “We don’t own Christmas”: Adam Silver’s response to NFL challenge as NBA holds strong in Christmas Day rivalry Ultimately, the cuts of Burney, Butler, and Marshall may just be the beginning of a deeper overhaul.

Anthony Stolarz latest injury update: Maple Leafs hit rock bottom as Coach Craig Berube casts doubt on his return for Game 6,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/anthony-stolarz-latest-injury-update-maple-leafs-hit-rock-bottom-as-coach-craig-berube-casts-doubt-on-his-return-for-game-6/articleshow/121198576.cms,"Coach Craig Berube casts doubt on Anthony Stolarz returning for Game 6

The Toronto Maple Leafs are in serious trouble. What started as a promising Round 2 playoff series has turned into a nightmare, with the Florida Panthers now one win away from sending the Leafs home. Their recent 6-1 loss on home ice wasn't just a scoreboard disaster — it’s a reflection of how badly things have unraveled since losing starting goaltender Anthony Stolarz in Game 1.Anthony Stolarz, who posted a respectable .901 save percentage through the playoffs' first round, has been sidelined since taking two brutal hits in Game 1 — one from Sam Reinhart to the chin and another accidental blow to the head from Sam Bennett. Stolarz’s attempt to power through was short-lived, as he vomited on the bench and was rushed to the hospital. Since then, there’s been an ominous silence about the specifics of his condition, though the signs point toward a possible concussion.When asked whether Stolarz would travel with the team for the do-or-die Game 6 in Florida, coach Craig Berube bluntly responded, ""I doubt it."" That’s a sobering blow for a team already on the brink.Yet, hope briefly flickers when Stolarz was spotted skating ahead of Game 5. “He’s progressing. He was on the ice a little bit, so he’s doing much better,” Berube said. However, the goalie only spent 25 minutes in one-on-one drills before exiting, and he hasn't joined team practice since.The Maple Leafs' goalie situation is now hanging by a thread. Joseph Woll had flashes of brilliance earlier in the series but crumbled in Game 5, managing just a .800 save percentage. The team even had to call on third-stringer Matt Murray after Woll allowed five goals.Also Read: Anthony Stolarz injury update: Goaltender injury raises red flags as NHL expert warns of symptoms 'more serious than a concussion’ With the Panthers now smelling blood and playing Game 6 on home ice, the odds are heavily stacked against Toronto.

Either way, risking Stolarz’s long-term health for one desperate game isn't a gamble worth taking.","Anthony Stolarz has been sidelined since taking two brutal hits in Game 1.

Auston Matthews’ hockey dream wasn’t cheap and his mom took the weight

“I used to work in the morning for Starbucks, in the afternoon the restaurant, i was very fortunate to have two jobs. And believe me, if they would have more hours, I would have more jobs.""





Before Auston Matthews was an NHL superstar, his biggest supporter was clocking into two jobs, trying to make ends meet. His mom, Ema Matthews , didn’t just believe in his dream, she bankrolled it, penny by penny, from behind a Starbucks counter. For families without deep pockets, hockey can be financially brutal. But Ema’s resilience turned obstacles into opportunity and her son into one of the league’s brightest stars. Her story is the heartwarming reminder that every great athlete often has a real-life superhero cheering from the sidelines.Ice time, gear, coaching, travel, youth hockey isn’t just a sport, it’s a financial beast. For the Matthews family, especially with Ema being originally from Hermosillo, Mexico, the culture and cost of the sport were both daunting. But she took on the challenge without hesitation, picking up multiple jobs including a gig at Starbucks to ensure Auston never missed a chance to grow on the ice.Ema shared in a past interview that the cost of hockey often reached up to $20,000 a year, a heavy ask for any middle-class family. To make it work, she didn’t just cut corners, she picked up shifts and poured lattes while helping Auston stay focused on the sport. She even deposited small amounts of money in his account so he could grab food with teammates like a regular teen.Ema’s story also breaks stereotypes. In a sport dominated by players from Canada and northern U.S. states, Auston’s rise as a player of Mexican heritage makes his success even more impactful. It's not just about talent, it’s about trailblazing, especially for kids of color or immigrant families who rarely see themselves represented in hockey.Auston Matthews is one of the Toronto Maple Leafs ’ biggest stars and a face of the NHL. He’s not just known for his goal-scoring skills but also for his poise and work ethic, traits his mom likely helped instill. While fans celebrate his success on the ice, stories like Ema’s remind us of the sacrifices behind the scenes that made it possible.Ema Matthews’ story shows what’s possible when love, grit, and hustle lead the way.Also read - “From baptism to strip club”: Pete Blackburn’s unhinged NHL comparison is going viral and fans totally get it","Auston Matthews is one of the Toronto Maple Leafs’ biggest stars and a face of the NHL.

Toronto Maple Leafs fans reach breaking point following humiliating defeat



Auston Matthews in focus of social media anger



The 6-1 Toronto Maple Leafs collapse against the Florida Panthers in Game 5 not only had the team on the doorstep of elimination—it also ignited a fan fury online and in arenas. From booing players off the ice to having a fan toss an Auston Matthews jersey in disgust, the angry reaction was instant, guttural, and unapologetically honest. For Toronto Maple Leafs fans, patience may have finally thinned.The boos inside Scotiabank Arena recounted part of it, but the internet finished it off. In the wake of the Toronto Maple Leafs' abysmal 6-1 defeat to the Florida Panthers during Game 5, supporters blanketed social media with scorching opinion pieces, savage memes, and visceral emotional angst—much of which was directed straight at superstar forward Auston Matthews.As the Maple Leafs trailed 3-2 in the series and were on the verge of elimination, the mood among the faithful went from sarcastic to furious. “At least someone wearing 34 hit their target tonight,” one Reddit commenter wrote after a Matthews jersey was thrown on the ice — a gesture of protest that shortly went viral.Another comment captured a sense of betrayal among fans who held onto hope: “4-0 and I put on Severance. This might truly be it for me. I already majorly cut back on watching regular season games (went from about 75 last year to about 25 this year).”The angst against Auston Matthews was not to be denied. Zero goals in his past ten second-round playoff contests and only three in his previous 21 playoff games had people questioning whether or not he was capable of carrying the team or delivering under the spotlight, and especially at the rate of well over $13 million annually.A particularly barbed remark had read: “Austin Matthews is NOT a leader. It's time for him to go. A new chapter in Leafs Nation must take root.”Other fans employed sarcasm to deal with the humiliation: “AM34 jersey: $300. Ticket to a home game: $3000. Beer: $25. Throwing a jersey on the ice: priceless. For everything else, there’s Mastercard.”And then there was existential terror that only a die-hard Maple Leafs fan could ever express: “No one hates the Leafs more than Leafs fans, I swear. Granted they’re very consistent choke artists so it’s kind of valid frustration for fans but still.”Reddit comments, fan sites, and postgame streams such as Steve Dangle's were full of not only lamenting remarks about the loss but demanding change. Some even mocked that if this was Matthews' legacy, then the city might need a second team: “Toronto needs an expansion team, as a treat.”There was no sugarcoating it. As fans left the arena early and jerseys landed on the ice, one feeling rang out loud and clear — Leafs fans are sick of hope, and even sicker of heartbreak.Also read: Auston Matthews silence grows louder as Maple Leafs chase playoff glory Game 6 is do-or-die for the Toronto Maple Leafs, but for so many in Leafs Nation, the emotional breaking point has already passed.

Virat Kohli Retires, Spotted With Anushka

Poll Who do you think should be the new captain of the Indian Test team? Other Jasprit Bumrah Ravindra Jadeja Shubman Gill

The retirement of Virat Kohli leaves a massive void in India's Test cricket team. The squad hasn't been announced yet, and there has been no confirmation as to who will lead India in the Test series against England, set to commence in June. While Kohli and Rohit Sharma leaving poses multiple questions, a few need immediate answering: who will be the new man to come in at the number 4 spot and who will be the new captain of this 'new', relatively inexperienced team?While the prominent discourse is that Gill appears to be the heir to both the number 4 spot and the captaincy, Ravichandran Ashwin feels that it is a massive role to function in. While the CSK man posed no questions as to Gill's ability, he sincerely wished that 'too much pressure' isn't put on the 25-year-old. In conversation with cricket journalist Vimal Kumar, Ashwin, on his YouTube channel 'Ash Ki Baat', name-dropped Gill's century in Dharamshala and a splendid outing against England in Ranchi as some of his most notable displays.Diving deep into the captaincy question that looms large ahead of the England series, Ashwin said, ""The most experienced person in the team is Ravindra Jadeja. If you're willing to train a new guy for two years and then make him captain, Jadeja can do that for two years too. They (India) can even play him as vice-captain (under Jadeja). It will seem like I'm throwing in a wildcard.""Adding to Jadeja's case, the spinner added that every Indian player dreams of captaining India ever since they start representing the country. Furthermore, Ashwin cited Jadeja's captaincy stint at CSK, although he did not continue for long in the role. Clarifying that he isn't insisting on Jadeja to be chosen as skipper, Ashwin clarified that there's no harm in considering the 36-year-old veteran for the role.While the IPL does not equate to the Test format in any way, the Gujarat Titans have risen to the top of the IPL table under the youngster's leadership. His ability to steer India against England, if chosen as captain, will largely determine the way Team India navigates this tricky transition.","Virat Kohli's retirement leaves a massive void in India's Test cricket team.

Poll Do you think Virat Kohli's retirement from Test cricket was a surprising decision? No, it was the right time Yes, it was unexpected

Virat Kohli retires from Test cricket after 14 years

Explained: Why Rohit Sharma retired from Test cricket

Former India cricket coach Ravi Shastri has disclosed details of his conversation with Virat Kohli before the latter's unexpected Test retirement announcement on Monday, May 12. Kohli, who ranks as India's fourth-highest Test run-scorer with 9230 runs and 30 centuries, made this decision despite an upcoming five-Test series against England in June.Shastri and Kohli, who formed one of India's most successful captain-coach partnerships in Test cricket, had discussed the retirement decision a week before the public announcement.""I did speak to him about it, I think a week before that and his mind was very clear that he'd given us everything. There were no regrets. There were one or two questions I asked, and that's a personal conversation which, you know, he mentioned very clearly, there were no doubts in his mind, which made me think, 'Yes, the time is right'. The mind has told his body that it's time to go,"" Shastri told Sanjana Ganesan in The ICC Review.Kohli leaves behind a remarkable legacy as India's most successful Test captain, securing 40 wins in 68 Tests, surpassing MS Dhoni's record by 13 victories.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Shastri acknowledged that Kohli's intense approach to the game may have contributed to his early retirement.""If he decided to do something, then he gave his 100%, which is not easy to match. Individually, as a bowler, as a batsman. A player does his job, then you sit back. But when the team goes out, it's as if he has to take all the wickets, he has to take all the catches, he has to make all the decisions on the field. That much involvement, I would think there's going to be a burnout somewhere if he doesn't take a rest, if he doesn't compartmentalise how much he wants to play across formats, there is bound to be a burnout.""Shastri highlighted Kohli's global impact and his ability to draw audiences to the sport.""He's got accolades around the globe. He has a bigger following than any other cricketer in the last decade. Whether it's Australia, whether it's South Africa, he just got people to watch the game. There was a love-hate relationship. They would get angry because he had the ability to get under the skin of the viewer also. In the way he celebrated, you know his intensity was such that it was like a rash. It spread very quickly, not just within the dressing room, but within living rooms as well for people watching cricket. So he was an infectious personality.""The retirement announcement caught Shastri off guard, despite understanding the mental toll of the game.""Virat surprised me because I thought he had at least two-three years of Test match cricket left in him. But then, when you're mentally fried and overcooked, that's what tells your body. You might be physically the fittest guy in the business. You might be fitter than half the guys in your team, but mentally you're well done, as they say, then it sends a message to the body. You know, that's it.""The Shastri-Kohli partnership led India to several historic achievements, including their first Test series victory in Australia, consecutive series wins in the West Indies, and breaking a 22-year winless streak in Sri Lanka. The team also showed strong performance in challenging conditions in South Africa and England.Shastri emphasized that Kohli had achieved everything possible in his career.""At times when you quit the game, you know, and after a month or two months you say, 'I wish I had done this, I wish I had done this.' He's done everything. He's captained sides, he's won World Cups, he's won an Under-19 World Cup himself. I mean, there's nothing for him to achieve.""",Virat Kohli retired from Test cricket after 14 years on Monday. Kohli is India's fourth-highest Test run-scorer with 9230 runs and 30 centuries.

Trey Hendrickson: Aidan Hutchinson stands between the possibilities of the Lions’ trade for Trey Hendrickson,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/aidan-hutchinson-stands-between-the-possibilities-of-the-lions-trade-for-trey-hendrickson/articleshow/121193551.cms,"Images via Getty

Can the Detroit Lions afford both Aidan Hutchinson and Trey Hendrickson?

Even though the Detroit Lions might have a golden opportunity to get Trey Hendrickson on board amid his tense back-and-forth with the Cincinnati Bengals , the dilemma still looms as the Lions hold back from investing a massive amount in one player since they already have one with a hefty contract. Aidan Hutchinson , bound in a 4-year contract, extracting over $30 million from the team, is a major reason why the Lions have their intentions set on a player whose paycheck won’t be a problem for future contracts to get hampered. While the choice to afford two skilled edge pushers at the same time might be a difficult one to make, there might not be a lot of time on the Lions’ hands to make a call as they continue to look for a new beneficial recruit.As per stats, the Lions still hold a hefty amount of $42.3 million in team cap space and can easily opt to get a big shot on their team, with Hendrickson currently seeming like a great option. The Bengals’ top pass rusher has been quite outspoken about him not being treated rightly while negotiating a deal regarding his contract and the team’s approval to seek a trade, to the extent that HC Zac Taylor has threatened to fine him if he refuses to play for the remaining year.With the words flying around of Hendrickson’s displeasure within his current team, it might be the perfect chance for the Lions to hit the bullseye, unless spending a massive amount is not on their list at the moment. While many believe that Hendrickson and Hutchinson together can be incredibly difficult to tackle on the field, the Lions might not be taking a step forward since Hendrickson’s expectations might not align with the team’s current goal of investment.The thought of Hutchinson and Hendrickson petrifying the offenses together sounds appealing; however, a sustainable decision might be the best choice for the Lions. Stepping away from the possibility of taking a big risk, the Lions continue to look for a more strategic deal.Also Read: Fans react to the hype building around Shedeur Sanders' impressive rookie minicamp performance in Berea","The Detroit Lions hold a hefty amount of $42.3 million in team cap space and can easily opt to get a big shot on their team, with Hendrickson currently seeming like a great option.

Chennai: On Thursday, LR Srihari became India’s 86th Grandmaster after sealing his final norm at the ongoing Asian Individual Championship in Al-Ain, with a round to spare. But ask him about his most memorable moment on the road to the GM title , and he’ll point to a game that he lost.In the first round of the 2023 Qatar Masters , where he bagged his second GM norm, Srihari, currently a second-year B Com student, was paired with Magnus Carlsen . The Chennai boy was completely outplayed, but that experience left a mark — so much so, it’s still his WhatsApp display picture.“The pairings came out at 12:55 pm and we were leaving the hotel at 1:30 pm. I saw I was playing Carlsen, and it was completely out of the blue. Some other player’s flight got delayed, so I got the pairing. I was a bit nervous but not scared. I just wanted to play a good game but ended up playing a really bad one. Still, that loss motivated me for the rest of the tournament and helped me achieve my second norm,” Srihari, who also became the 31st GM from Tamil Nadu, told TOI.“We didn’t converse much. But that would be one of my favourite moments in my chess career so far — to get a chance to play classical chess over the board with him. I could have played better, but I will cherish this the most.”And it’s been a long road for the 19-year-old since then. The final norm had eluded him for months, sometimes by the thinnest of margins.One such heartbreak at the 2024 Dubai Open really stung.“I personally feel I should have completed this norm last year itself. It was just a lot of unfortunate things and, at some point, it gets frustrating. I came extremely close in the Dubai Open; I had to win the final round. Iwas completely winning, but I made a one-move blunder and lost. I was literally one move away from becoming a GM,” Srihari said.",LR Srihari became India’s 86th Grandmaster after sealing his final norm at the ongoing Asian Individual Championship in Al-Ain.

Nihal Sarin defeated overnight leader Daneshvar Bardiya in the ninth and last round but it was not enough to clinch the Asian Continental chess title.Nihal and Bardiya finished on seven points each in the Swiss League tournament at Al Ain, UAE, on Thursday. The 18-year-old Iranian, seeded 12th, edged out the top-seeded Indian on the basis of playing against opponents with higher average rating than that of Nihal’s (Elo 2592 vs Elo 2515). Nihal finished runner-up.The tournament offered 10 spots for the 206-player FIDE knockout World Cup scheduled later this year.Six Indians from this event clinched these spots. Iniyan P, Raja Rithivik, SL Narayanan, M Pranesh (6.5 points each) and GB Harshvardhan (6) joined Nihal by finishing fifth to ninth in that order.IM Harshvardhan (Elo 2441) is not a GM yet. According to India team coach Pravin Thipsay, even the 11th finisher Murali Karthikyean is expected to get a World Cup seat as “the continental champion is seeded”.The Russians were playing in this event for the first time after changing their affiliation from Europe to the Asian federation. Hence the World Cup quota from the continental meet was increased from eight to 10 players this time.The women’s event saw a heartbreak for India as 38th seed WGM Srija Seshadri came close but finished fifth after drawing with Valentina Gunina of Russia in the last round.

Meanwhile, Jalen Williams struggled, going 3-for-16 from the field and missing all four of his threes. With limited help from the bench and too many fouls and turnovers, OKC couldn’t close the gap despite strong defensive energy.Nikola Jokic led the Denver Nuggets to a strong 119-point outing with a dominant performance. He dropped 29 points on 64.3% shooting, added 14 rebounds, and handed out 8 assists.

Poll Should the ICC establish a specific qualification pathway for Caribbean nations in cricket for the 2028 Olympics? Unsure, need more information No, it should be based on world rankings Yes, it's essential for fairness

Cricket West Indies has appealed to the International Cricket Council to establish a qualification pathway for Caribbean nations to compete in the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, where cricket will return after a 128-year absence with a six-team T20 tournament for both men and women.The qualification process for the LA Olympics remains unannounced by the ICC, raising concerns for West Indies cricket.The issue stems from the unique structure of West Indies cricket, where nations like Barbados, Jamaica, Antigua and Barbuda, and Trinidad and Tobago compete as a unified team in international cricket but participate separately in the Olympics.This structure could potentially exclude Caribbean involvement if Olympic qualification is determined by world rankings alone.""All we are asking is that our individual nations' exceptional Olympic legacy be considered in the conversation,"" said CWI chief executive Chris Dehring. ""Our nations have proudly flown their individual flags atop Olympic podiums as perennial gold medallists. Now, with cricket's inclusion, we must ensure that our cricketers are not shut out of history. We are ready to collaborate. We are ready to compete. But above all, we are asking for fairness.""CWI acknowledges that fielding a unified West Indies team at LA 2028 is unlikely, despite their past successes as T20 world champions in 2012 and 2016, with their women's team also securing the global title in 2016.In their letter to the ICC, CWI proposed two potential solutions for regional representation.The first proposal suggests an inter-Caribbean qualifying tournament if the West Indies teams secure a qualifying position.The second proposal recommends a dedicated regional qualifying process for all independent West Indies nations.""The Caribbean has always punched above its weight at the Olympics, inspiring the world with our athletic brilliance,"" said CWI president Kishore Shallow. ""Cricket's return to the Games in 2028 must not exclude our young cricketers from the same dream that has inspired our athletes.""","Cricket West Indies have appealed to the International Cricket Council to establish a qualification pathway for Caribbean nations to compete in the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.

Winter blues bounce-back

Barcelona clinched the Spanish title on Thursday for the 28th time in the club's history, but only the second occasion in the last six years.Hansi Flick 's hugely entertaining side beat Espanyol 2-0 to take the crown with two matches to spare. Here's how the Catalans turned things around for themselves, that too, in the space of a season.Flick's thrilling attacking outfit this season have shredded nearly every side to cross their path. Barcelona scored 97 goals in 36 games to power to the title, 23 more than second-placed Real Madrid.A 7-0 thrashing of Valladolid in August set out their intentions, and they hit four goals or more in 13 league matches. The brilliant Lamine Yamal, still only 17, excelled, feeding veteran striker Robert Lewandowski and dynamic winger Raphinha.The Brazilian, who Flick convinced to stay at the club, had his best ever season and credits his coach with changing his career.Yamal provided the most assists in Spain with 13, while Lewandowski notched 25 goals and Raphinha got 18 while setting up nine himself.Flick's high defensive line has been a key feature of the team's approach, which sometimes costs them at the back, but largely keeps opponents under pressure, including Madrid in last weekend's Clasico. ""For 24 minutes Real Madrid didn't touch the ball in our half... how we press them when they have the ball, it's unbelievable... we can be very proud of that,"" said Flick.Flick's predecessor Xavi Hernandez made every excuse under the sun -- and even including the sun -- last season as Barcelona failed to win a single trophy.This year the Catalans claimed a domestic treble and Flick has largely insisted on avoiding blaming external factors when his team has struggled. That helped Barcelona players realise that what they achieve, or not, is up to them and has given them the strength to turn around adverse situations.Barca have pulled off several impressive comebacks this season, including from two goals down against Real Madrid to triumph 4-3 in the most recent Clasico on May 11. ""The team's mentality is incredible,"" said Flick after securing a fourth Clasico victory from four meetings this season.Furthermore the team no longer looks weighed down by expectations or pressure and instead are focused on enjoying themselves on the pitch -- contributing to their attractive, flair-filled football.Pedri Gonzalez has a strong case for being the world's best midfielder right now and after injury-ravaged years him staying fit for the whole season has been vital for Barca.""For me, Pedri is absolutely incredible -- I'm on my knees for him,"" said former Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger. The Canary Islander, 22, has been the heartbeat of Flick's Barca, both in an attacking sense but also defensively, given the team operates without a holding midfielder following injuries to Marc Bernal and Marc Casado.Pedri's lithe form and quick-thinking allows him to get out of trouble quickly and helps Barca spring forward on the counter.Flick boosted Barcelona's fitness levels and confidence across the board and his faith in players who struggled last season has been paid back in spades.The German insisted on keeping Eric Garcia and the centre-back has impressed when given opportunities, even playing out of position. Ferran Torres has helped the stellar forward trio rest and is the team's third top goalscorer and third top assist provider in La Liga.Most importantly, Inigo Martinez struggled last season but has been a cornerstone of the defence alongside teenager Pau Cubarsi, becoming a true leader.Despite an excellent start to the season, in November and December last year Barcelona slumped.The Catalans won just once in a seven-match spell in that period, losing against minnows Leganes and Las Palmas at home. Their lead crumbled, with Atletico usurping them after beating Barca just before Christmas.Flick took action, deploying the fit-again Frenkie de Jong in midfield over Casado and installing Wojciech Szczesny in goal in place of Inaki Pena. Barcelona came back strongly and went on a run of 24 matches unbeaten over all competitions to get back in the driving seat for the title.","Barcelona clinched the Spanish title on Thursday for the 28th time in the club's history, but only the second occasion in the last six years.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Caleb Williams tried to avoid Bears in NFL Draft, wanted trade to Vikings

Caleb Williams, the top overall selection in last year’s NFL draft , faced a tough year as the starting quarterback for the Chicago Bears , with the team finishing at the bottom of their division. After an encouraging 4–2 start, they went on a ten-game losing streak. In late November, head coach Matt Eberflus was dismissed, marking the first time in franchise history that a coach was fired mid-season. Williams was under constant pressure throughout the season, running for his life on the field, and was Caleb Williams was sacked a league-high 68 times last season!And now a new book has revealed that quarterback Caleb Williams was so cautious about joining the Bears before the draft that his family consulted lawyers to explore options to bypass the NFL’s collective bargaining agreement.In Seth Wickersham ’s upcoming book “American Kings: A Biography of the Quarterback,” Williams’ father Carl, described Chicago as “the place where quarterbacks go to die” in the months leading up to the 2024 NFL Draft. Williams himself mentioned that “I don’t think I can do it with [Bears offensive coordinator Shane] Waldron,” as noted in the book.Williams admired the Vikings and head coach Kevin O’Connell during the pre-draft process and had admitted that he wanted to play there. However, he believed the Bears were unlikely to trade the pick to a division rival.Aware that Bears general manager Ryan Poles was probably going to select him first overall, Williams and his father thought the only way to prevent the Bears from taking him was to launch a smear campaign against the team. Ultimately, according to the book, Caleb Williams decided he “wasn’t ready to nuke the city.”At the NFL Scouting Combine, Williams stated he was open to playing for the Bears. “If I get drafted by the Bears, I’ll be excited,” Williams said on March 1, 2024. “If they trade the pick, and I get drafted by someone else, I’m just as excited.”After visiting Halas Hall the following month, Williams told his father that he was excited to help rebuild the Bears. “I can do it for this team,” Caleb told his dad, according to the book. “I’m going to go to the Bears.”Wickersham followed Williams during his college career for a book about quarterbacks at every level of the sport. A Bears spokesperson declined to comment when contacted by the press.The book stated that Carl Williams told agents before the draft that “I don’t want my son playing for the Bears.” He also criticised the rookie wage scale as “unconstitutional” and “the worst in sports history,” and even considered steering his son toward the minor-league USFL. Williams could have chosen to return to college but decided against it.The Bears selected Williams first overall. Williams was correct about Waldron, though; the Bears dismissed both the offensive coordinator and head coach Matt Eberflus during Williams’s rookie season. Williams revealed that sometimes last year, he would watch a film without coaches present to guide him, which is no doubt a concerning detail.“No one tells me what to watch,” he told his father. The Bears replaced Eberflus with the highly sought-after candidate on the market, Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson, partly by doubling their head coaching salary.When Johnson was introduced in January, Williams said he was “extremely excited” about the appointment. Johnson was his top choice. “Once I got off the phone — I was driving on the highway, I don’t know if it was safe or not — but I gave out a loud yell and scream of just excitement,” he explained.",Caleb Williams' father described Chicago as “the place where quarterbacks go to die” in the months leading up to the 2024 NFL Draft.

Poll Will Rajat Patidar's fitness impact RCB's performance in the upcoming match? No, RCB has enough depth. Yes, he is a key player.

Virat Kohli retires from Test cricket after 14 years

KKR GO THROUGH THE PACES

RAIN PAIN

The break in the IPL this season seems to have worked in Rajat Patidar ’s favour. The Royal Challengers Bengaluru captain, who suffered a right ring finger injury against Chennai Super Kings in a home game on May 3, got some time to recover for the remainder of the season, which resumes here on Saturday. With his availability a talking point ahead of RCB’s match against Kolkata Knight Riders here, the stylish right-hander made a statement on match eve on Thursday.On Thursday, Virat Kohli and Phil Salt were the first batters to start proceedings in the team’s first full training session after the break. As the opening duo showcased their range of shots, Patidar focused on basic fitness routines near the boundary line. The 31-year-old played shadow shots before heading towards the nets. To begin with, Patidar, who strapped his finger, took some low throwdowns. It was evident that the player was trying to test his finger, which was taped. Once Patidar felt comfortable, he walked towards the main nets and got down to business.Initially, he lacked power in his shots, even miscuing a few. Patidar, who was watched closely by batting coach and mentor Dinesh Karthik, pushed a few balls to either side of the wicket before unleashing his big hits. Most of it landed in the stands, with his timing being a standout feature. With every shot, Patidar grew in confidence and brought out his trademark aerial cover drives. While Patidar’s show during training is a huge relief for the team, it also strengthens the Madhya Pradesh player’s case for the England tour. Proving his match fitness will be crucial with an India A squad call-up in the pipeline.While focus was on Patidar’s fitness, others got their time in the middle, including Karnataka’s Mayank Agarwal, who is Devdutt Padikkal’s injury replacement. The bowling unit, led by Krunal Pandya and Bhuvneshwar Kumar, went through the grind. The latter has a huge role to play for the in-form franchise, with Josh Hazlewood’s availability in question and South Africa pacer Lungi Ngidi set to miss the Playoffs .The KKR squad, barring Rovman Powell and Moeen Ali, too got down to business. Confirming the duo’s absence, the franchise stated, “Powell and Ali couldn’t come back due to medical reasons. Rovman is undergoing a procedure, while Moeen and his family are down with a viral infection.”Saturday’s clash – with rain threat looming – is a big game for the visitors, who lie in sixth place and a defeat will make matters difficult for them in the Playoff race. On the other hand, RCB, who lie second with 16 points from 11 games, have all but sealed their berth.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru face Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL.

What’s the tile game Meghan Markle played on Netflix? A beginner’s guide to mahjong,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/whats-the-tile-game-meghan-markle-played-on-netflix-a-beginners-guide-to-mahjong/articleshow/120736644.cms,"Meghan Markle played the game of Mahjong in her Netflix series

From the Qing dynasty to pop culture

How is mahjong played?

Connor Wan, a 29-year-old British-Chinese artist, learned mahjong while visiting family in Hong Kong. He enjoyed it so much that he started the Four Winds Mahjong Club in London, and later brought it to Toronto after moving there in 2024. “Moving countries is hard, especially when you don’t know anyone,” he said. The club became popular quickly, not as a place for gambling, but for making friends and celebrating Asian culture. Nicole Wong, a writer and audio producer from California, started playing mahjong as a teenager with her grandparents. She later began The Mahjong Project in 2019 to share the game’s cultural stories and organise pop-up game nights. This year, she published a book called Mahjong: House Rules from Across the Asian Diaspora. Nicole says the sound of the tiles is especially powerful. “Mahjong is more than just fun,” she says. “It has a deep history and brings back strong memories.” In Toronto, Robyn Feldberg has taught over 250 people how to play mahjong through her courses. She donates all the money—about $50,000 so far—to charities like Save A Child’s Heart. She says the game is especially popular with young mothers who want a fun way to relax and connect with others. “They tell me, ‘We want something that’s just for us,’” she said.

A centuries-old Chinese game called mahjong is having a modern revival across continents, from luxury cruise ships and trendy hotel lounges to Meghan Markle’s Netflix series.In the sixth episode of her docuseries With Love, the Duchess of Sussex invites friends for a cosy game night – playing mahjong, reports the Globe and Mail.The four-person tile-based game, traditionally associated with Chinese culture, is now catching on with new generations across the globe. “The game itself is really so fun,” says Markle. “But what was so great was the idea of learning something new with your friends, together... the mahjong becomes the background of the expansion of friendship. It’s the feeling of community.”Mahjong dates back to the mid-1800s during the Qing Dynasty in China. Traditionally played with 144 tiles, the game blends skill, strategy and a touch of luck. Players pick and discard tiles to form winning hands, much like the card game rummy.The game’s expansion across the world has now erupted into a full-blown trend. The World Mahjong Championship was recently held in Mississauga, Ontario – the first time it’s been hosted in North America. Hotels such as the Ace Hotel New York and Thompson Hotel Dallas regularly hold mahjong-themed nights.Fans with money to spare are buying fancy mahjong sets from Hermès, Louis Vuitton, and Ralph Lauren. Some are even splashing out on luxury tables that shuffle the tiles automatically – costing over $4,500.Even cruise ships have joined the trend, offering mahjong tournaments and special rooms just for playing the game.Mahjong is played with 144 tiles. Players begin by shuffling the tiles face down. Everyone rolls dice and the highest roller becomes the dealer. Each player picks 36 tiles and builds a wall—two rows of 18 tiles. The walls are pushed forward, creating a space in the middle for discards. Each player then draws 13 tiles (the dealer starts with 14), and the game begins.Players take turns drawing one tile and discarding one, always keeping 13 tiles in hand. You can draw a new tile or pick up someone’s discarded one. If a discarded tile helps complete a set (called a meld), you can grab it, announce the set, and show the tiles. To win, a player must have four melds (like three or four matching tiles or a sequence of three in a suit) and one pair (two matching tiles)—making 14 tiles total.There are five types of tiles: Bamboo, Characters, Dots (these are the three main suits), and special tiles called Honors (Dragons and Winds) and Bonus (Flowers and Seasons). Each suit goes from 1 to 9. Honors and Bonus tiles add extra excitement but aren't needed to win. Mahjong mixes strategy and memory with a bit of luck—and it’s all about building the right sets before your opponents do.For many mahjong fans, it’s not just a game but a deeply social experience.","Mahjong dates back to the mid-1800s during the Qing Dynasty in China. Traditionally played with 144 tiles, the game blends skill, strategy and a touch of luck. The World Mahjong Championship was recently held in Mississauga, Ontario – the first time it’s been hosted in North America.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120736761,imgsize-1135604,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Barcelona win 28th La Liga title after beating Espanyol,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/barcelona-win-28th-la-liga-title-after-beating-espanyol/articleshow/121199484.cms,"Getty Images

- Yamal breaks through -

A stunning Lamine Yamal strike helped crown Barcelona La Liga champions with a 2-0 win at local rivals Espanyol on Thursday, with victory ensuring Real Madrid cannot catch them at the top of the table. Yamal's effort and Fermin Lopez's goal took Hansi Flick's side seven points clear of Los Blancos with two matches remaining, to clinch Barcelona's 28th title and complete a superb domestic treble.Only the Champions League escaped an exciting young Barca side this season, as they won the league for the second time in six years, at Espanyol's ground again just as in 2023.Back then, celebrating Barca players were chased from the field by angry home supporters but this time Espanyol turned on the sprinklers to soak the jubilant visitors, who headed down the tunnel quickly.Yamal opened the scoring after 53 minutes of a tense derby clash with a brilliant curling effort, before Lopez added another in the 95th minute to secure victory.""It's time to celebrate,"" said Barca coach Flick, who said he would demand even more from his team next season.""It's in our DNA (to want to learn), it's normal, and this is what I want from the players, that they always try to get better and they have this hunger, it's crucial.""Outside the stadium before the match several Espanyol fans were hit by a car which drove into a big crowd, although none were seriously injured and police said it appeared to be an accident.Barcelona were seconds away from sealing their title triumph on Wednesday but Real Madrid snatched a 95th-minute winner against Mallorca to delay the inevitable.Flick's side started slowly in Cornella, with Espanyol, 16th, looking dangerous on the counter-attack and keen to secure their top-flight survival.Wojciech Szczesny made a fine save to deny Javi Puado who broke through on goal in Espanyol's best chance of the opening period.Barca dominated the ball but failed to create any clear opportunities themselves in the first half.The Catalan giants have often blown teams away this season, approaching a century of goals in La Liga, but with the title on the line and a hostile crowd against them, they needed something special to break through.That came from 17-year-old wing wizard Yamal, who zipped inside off the right flank and unleashed a rocket into the top corner from outside the box, in a replica of his goal for Spain against France in the Euro 2024 semi-finals.It was the teenager's eighth La Liga strike of the season but with goals in both matches against rivals Real and also in the visit to face Atletico Madrid, he has a penchant for the big occasion.""I don't know what to say about Lamine, he scored an amazing goal, he's had an amazing season,"" said Lopez.Barca's superb display in Sunday's Clasico, in which they beat their rivals 4-3 in a thrilling battle, effectively won them the title.They still had to get it over the line against their neighbours, though, and that became easier when Leandro Cabrera was sent off for an elbow into Yamal's stomach.Even though they had a player fewer, Espanyol pressured Barcelona heavily until Lopez drilled past Joan Garcia to end the hosts' resistance.Espanyol fans pelted Barcelona players with bottles as they celebrated the goal, but as the league's youngest squad wrapped up a title that most believed was unlikely at best after Kylian Mbappe's arrival at last year's champions Real, they did not care.""On the pitch it was clear we could not celebrate there... two years ago (there was trouble),"" Flick told reporters.""It's also about respect for the fans here, (so) of course we celebrated in the dressing room, fantastic, the players could do that, really good.""Tomorrow I will stand a little bit in the background and I also will enjoy it. When I see the people are happy and smiling I will enjoy it.""",Barcelona win La Liga title with 2-0 win at local rivals Espanyol. Goals from Lamine Yamal and Fermin Lopez seal victory. Barca seven points clear of Real Madrid with two matches remaining. Barcelona win domestic treble for second time in six years.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121199529,imgsize-121548,width-400,resizemode-4/Barcelona-1605-Getty.jpg"
