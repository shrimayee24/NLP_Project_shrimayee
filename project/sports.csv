Taylor Swift Has “Distanced” Herself From Blake Lively Because Of This Reason, Fans Say



Blake Lively Was Not Spotted With Taylor Swift At Super Bowl 2025



Taylor Swift, the billionaire pop star, has been in the news since she got booed at the Super Bowl last weekend when Travis Kelce’s team, the Kansas City Chiefs lost the trophy to the Philadelphia Eagles. Away from the Super Bowl drama, the pop star has also found herself involved in the legal drama between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni. But now, the reason why Taylor Swift has “distanced” herself from Blake Lively is pretty clear, according to fans.Taylor Swift has remained pretty silent about the whole controversial situation and is yet to make an official announcement about it. It seems like fans have found the reason behind it.A fan took to X and wrote, “The fact that Taylor Swift, huge advocate of the womens movement, didnt support bestie Blake Lively speaks volumes. If anyone would support, know and have proof that Blake was harrassed it would be Taylor Swift. Talks, calls, texts...Yet Taylor didn't support it. Hmmm”Another fan wrote, “If my bestfriend who made me godmother to her children was in a legal battle over sexual harassment & retaliation, I would be standing ten toes down with her. I would not abandon her. The fact that Taylor Swift distanced herself from Blake Lively is damning enough.”While it is not confirmed why Taylor Swift has not been spotted recently with her best friend, Blake Lively, fans are pretty convinced that this is the reason behind it.For the unversed, Blake Lively had accused Justin Baldoni of harassment and Justin filed a counter lawsuit against Blake Lively and her husband Ryan Reynolds accusing them of defamation and trying to take over control of their blockbuster movie, It Ends With Us. Taylor Swift was named by Justin Baldoni in the lawsuit as he felt Blake Lively tried to “use” Taylor Swift’s power and influence to gain control of the movie.Many fans also expected to see Taylor Swift and Blake Lively at the Super Bowl held last weekend but Blake was nowhere to be found at the stadium. This was in complete contrast to the 2024 Super Bowl when Blake Lively was spotted cheering on Travis Kelce as she stood next to Taylor Swift. The two were also spotted hugging each other when the Kansas City Chiefs won the trophy last year.A few days ago, a source revealed to Page Six that “Taylor really wishes Blake hadn’t dragged her into this whole situation.” This might be true considering how Taylor Swift has avoided being spotted with Blake Lively.With the Chiefs losing the Super Bowl, both Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift have been trolled but have remained silent. They have also not been spotted out in public since then.Also Read: Hailee Steinfeld reacts as Josh Allen gets asked out on a date during their appearance at NFL Honors","Taylor Swift has been in the news since she got booed at the Super Bowl last weekend when Travis Kelce’s team, the Kansas City Chiefs lost the trophy to the Philadelphia Eagles.

GOAT

Kendall Gill shared NBA execs’ verdict on the GOAT debate

The debate on LeBron James Michael Jordan , the greatest of all time debate is far from settling as it comes up with new perspectives. While James still has, at least a few years on his sleeves and he has been on a streak of adding more records to his already stunning basketball resume, Jordan’s impact in the basketball narrative has always been on top alongside James. Now, in a recent interview, former Chicago Bulls star Kendall Gill shared that NBA executives already have theirpick in the debate.NBA has never openly shared its pick on the LeBron James vs. Michael Jordan GOAT debate. While it has been a safe play for the league to maintain the balance among fans, former NBA star Kendall Gill seemingly has the answer to the long-time debated question as he shared that he got it from NBA executives at the United Center. In a recent chat with the 2 Raw 4 TV podcast, the former NBA star gave the inside scoop on the matter.“I’m at the United Center all the time. And I did this specifically to get answers from executives of other teams. I go downstairs and ask each executive: ‘In their prime, who would you take in the draft—Michael Jordan or LeBron James?’ Just one executive chose LeBron over Jordan. That tells you everything,” Gill said.That tells you everything? Of course, most have been long-time devout fans of Jordan but James has also made his case strong. Additionally, it is also hard to compare the legends following their statistics.James is on top in regards to both their career points holding a stunning 41,641 points and continuing while Jordan posted 32,292 points in his legendary career. James has 21 All-Star selections to his credit while Jordan ended his career with 14. James has never won the Defensive Player of the Year award in his career. In the 1987–88 season, Jordan won the NBA Defensive Player of the Year award, becoming the first player to claim both the scoring title and DPOY in the same year. Jordan has 10 NBA scoring titles, which is the most in NBA history while James has claimed only one. Michael Jordan won the MVP award five times and James is a four-time NBA MVP.Also Read: “Go f**k it, go”: LeBron James explains what his wife Savannah James endured to influence his basketball legacy The stats continue and both the legends have made their marks in the league in different ways. Regardless, James’ reign as a dominant NBA star is not over as he recently surpassed the record set by his idol, Michael Jordan, the only other NBA player to score 40 after turning 40.","Kendall Gill shared NBA execs’ verdict on the GOAT debate.

“It was my idea”: Mets owner Steve Cohen calls out Scott Boras for minimal contributions in Pete Alonso’s re-signing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/it-was-my-idea-mets-owner-steve-cohen-calls-out-scott-boras-for-minimal-contributions-in-pete-alonsos-re-signing/articleshow/118338188.cms,"Steve Cohen calls out Scott Boras for minimal contributions in Pete Alonso’s re-signing (Image Source: Alonso/IG, NYTimes)

Steve Cohen bashed Steve Cohen for minimal participation in Pete Alonso’s contract negotiations

“It was my idea. I just felt that the negotiation had gone on so long, I just wanted to make sure that he heard from us how we felt about him. I just felt like he deserved that respect. He's been a great Met for a long time, he's a fan favorite, and I thought there was a real opportunity to sit down with him and kind of hash it out,”

Steve Cohen on Juan Soto, Francisco Lindor & a High-Stakes Meeting That Kept Pete Alonso in New York

“And so David and I flew down to Tampa, had a great conversation over a few hours, and frankly Pete did all the talking. Scott Boras was there and Scott didn’t say a freaking word the whole time. And it was like I turned to him, I go, 'I just want to make sure... you're still breathing over there!'”

""I love it. That means you're onto something, you're doing something well. Last year, we might've been a little bit of an underdog. Now all of the sudden, people are noticing, 'Hey, this is a good team.' And that's the way I want it. We want to come into every season with high expectations.”

Pete Alonso’s re-signing with the New York Mets has been one of the hot topics of the offseason. The reason behind the huge buzz around his hiring is contributed by the fact that Mets owner Steve Cohen publicly revealed the conclusions of his contract negotiations. Talking about re-signing, Cohen recently bashed Alonso's agent Scott Boras for his minimal contributions in the $54 Million signing.Earlier this month, the New York Mets announced re-signing their star first baseman Pete Alonso for a whopping $54 Million contract. Shortly after the signing, reports emerged, claiming that Alonso had an in-person meeting with Mets owner Steve Cohen.Apart from Steve Cohen, the meeting also featured Pete Alonso’s agent Scott Boras. On Monday Cohen made an appearance on the “Meet at the Apple” podcast by the New York Mets, to talk about Alonso’s $54 Million re-signing, during one of the segments of the podcast, Cohen bashed Boras for his minimal inputs during contract negotiations meeting with Alonso.Cohen said.Cohen further added.Whether it’s Pete Alonso’s re-signing or Juan Soto’s massive signing, the New York Mets have succeeded in making a great lineup for the 2025 MLB season. Moving forward in the podcast episode, Steve Cohen praised his team and said:Before his recent statement, Steve Cohen made headlines last week when he revealed “humanizing the negotiations” with Pete Alonso.","The New York Mets announced re-signing their star first baseman Pete Alonso for a whopping $54 Million contract.

Patriots Pulse shared an Instagram post of CB Christian Gonzalez

Christian Gonzalez was ""heated"" after being the third cornerback taken on draft night. Gonzalez thought he would go within the first ten picks but dropped to 17th overall to the Patriots

That was probably one of the most stressful (nights). I know I'm gonna get picked, but I don't know where, what's next, where in the country I'm gonna live.

The other two cornerbacks left with Patriots CB Christian Gonzalez were Seattle Seahawks CB Devon Witherspoon and Washington Commanders CB Emmanuel Forbes

But then I was kinda falling. I was thinking of going top 10. The whole thing was, we gonna go, cause me and Spoon (CB Devon Witherspoon) got the same agent. We thought whoever went first out of us, the other one, would go right after. That ain't happening. I kept just dropping, going down. Our class was kinda crazy. There was a lot of (players) that went that we didn't think was gonna go.

At the time, it was motivation. The knock on me was that I don't talk a lot. And people thought I wasn't competitive. I got to the league and have shown what I can do. I guess it's because, usually, corners are a lot more talkative and talk a lot more trash. It's just not my game. So, they thought I wasn't competitive.

WWE RAW this week saw the last few slots for the Elimination Chamber being filled, along with other exciting matches and heated moments taking place.The February 17th, 2025, edition of Monday Night RAW was presented from the Spectrum Center in Charlotte, North Carolina. The show continued the road to the WWE Elimination Chamber with more qualifying matches and explosive in-ring action by superstars.Sami Zayn returns to RAW after being taken out with a Piledriver assault by Kevin Owens. He accepted Kevin Owens' challenge for the Elimination Chamber, but RAW GM Adam Pearce refused to make the match, considering Sami is still not cleared. But Zayn insists on Pearce and claims that he is not afraid of the repercussions. Following a huge verbal back and forth, in the end, Adam Pearce makes the match, but an Unsanctioned match.The match was made last week after AJ Styles returned to RAW and had an altercation with Dominik Mysterio and Carlito. The action went back and forth as Dominik displayed an exceptional performance against The Phenomenal One. But in the end, it was not enough to put him down. Despite Carlito interfering, Styles takes him out and counters Dominik with a Styles Clash to win. After the bout, Bron Breakker tries to spear Styles, but he moves out, and Dominik Mysterio gets taken down, leading to AJ taking him out with a Pele Kick.This contest was a WWE Women’s Intercontinental Championship No.1 Contender’s Match. Dakota Kai and Ivy Nile fought with everything they had as a huge opportunity hung in the balance. In the final moments of the bout, Dakota Kai delivers a springboard stomp to the back of Ivy Nile's head. She then lifts her and hits a Go To Kick to pick up the win. As she celebrates, the champion Lyra Valkyria enters the ring to pose with her title.The World Heavyweight Champion Gunther mocks Jey Uso by entering him through the crowd. He even threatens Michael Cole and Pat McAfee for running his mouth each week and being a huge YEET movement fan. As Gunther continues to insult Jey and claim that he will end his WrestleMania dreams, the YEET man storms to the ring, breaking through the officials, and a brawl ensues between them. The officials rush to the ring to separate the duo as the segment comes to an end.Pete Dunne looked to gain momentum at the expense of RAW's newest rising star, Penta. The match was a stellar bout pitting two different styles against each other with captivating in-ring action. Towards the end of the bout, Ludwig Kaiser interferes but gets into a verbal altercation with Pete Dunne. Penta sends Pete crashing into Kaiser and hits the Penta Driver to seal the victory.This was the last Women’s Elimination Chamber Qualifying Match. The upstart Roxanne Perez went up against the dominant Raquel Rodriquez in this high-stakes bout. The match was a stellar showdown and a thrilling experience to witness. Towards the end, Bianca Belair makes her way to confront Liv Morgan. She tries to run but is stopped by Naomi. This distraction costs Raquel as Roxanne hits the Pop Rox to get the three count and pick up the win.The main event was the Men’s Elimination Chamber Qualifying Match, pitting longtime rivals Seth Rollins against Finn Balor. This was their 11th one-on-one match in WWE, and much like their previous encounters, Balor and Rollins put up yet another captivating showdown. The excellent display of in-ring prowess of both competitors, multiple counters, and near falls made it a must-see bout and led to the fans erupting in a 'This is Awesome' chant. In the end, Balor connected with a Coupe De Grace and locked in a cross face. But Rollins escaped the hold and quickly countered with a Stomp to win and get the last spot in the Elimination Chamber match.Also read: Two New Matches Teased for WWE Elimination Chamber 2025 on SmackDown","The February 17th, 2025, edition of Monday Night RAW was presented from the Spectrum Center in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Vladimir Guerrero Jr.’s take on rejecting contract extension with Blue Jays

""I am confident that we exhausted the communication, the ideas, the thoughts and communicated every dollar. The offers that we made for Vlad would've been record-setting and would've made him one of the highest-paid players in the game.""

""Listen, I want to be here. I want to be a Blue Jay for the rest of my career. But it's free agency. It's business. So I'm going to have to listen to 29 more teams and they're going to have to compete for that.""

“The signing of

Anthony Santander

with Toronto today guaranteed Vladimir Guerrero Jr. that the team wants to win and do not be surprised that before Spring Training begins he is signing a contract with the Toronto Blue Jays of over 450 million to 550 million,""

The Toronto Blue Jays have finally decided to bid farewell to their star player Vladimir Guerrero Jr. The Blue Jays have concluded their contract extension negotiations, sending Guerrero Jr. to free agency in November. Guerrero Jr. recently opened up about his reaction to not signing a contract extension, calling his decision a “business” move.On Tuesday, Vladimir Guerrero Jr. revealed that his negotiations for a contract extension with the Toronto Blue Jays have officially concluded. Guerrero Jr. has decided to say ""no"" to the final offer made by the Blue Jays. According to ESPN, general manager Ross Atkins labeled the team's offer as ""very, very aggressive."" Sharing his take, Atkins said:As for Vladimir Guerrero Jr. he ""wants to be"" with the Blue for ""the rest of"" his career in the league. However, it won't come at the cost of settling for an undervalued contract. Sharing his reaction to rejecting the contract extension offer from the Blue Jays, Guerrero Jr. said:MLB insider Hector Gomez previously revealed Vladimir Guerrero Jr. could possibly sign an extension with the Toronto Blue Jays worth $550 Million. Sharing his take via an X post last month, Gomez wrote (translated from Spanish to English):The Blue Jays fans would definitely be upset with Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s decision, who previously shared his desperation for wanting him back with the team.","Vladimir Guerrero Jr. has rejected a contract extension offer from the Toronto Blue Jays.

"“Old fool”: Deion Sanders refused to be swayed by Patrick Mahomes' hype, remains a strong supporter of Tom Brady as the GOAT",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/old-fool-deion-sanders-refused-to-be-swayed-by-patrick-mahomes-hype-remains-a-strong-supporter-of-tom-brady-as-the-goat/articleshow/118314888.cms,"Image via Imagn Images

Deion Sanders chooses Tom Brady in the GOAT debate against Patrick Mahomes

Deion Sanders , known for his life and personality, recently visited New Orleans and met Kayla Nicole, Travis Kelce 's ex-girlfriend, representing I Am Athlete. During a conversation, she asked Prime a question about Tom Brady or Patrick Mahomes , which stood out among the other questions she asked.Chiefs quarterback Mahomes is on the verge of becoming the GOAT, a feat no other quarterback has achieved, including Brady. Analysts like Stephen A. Smith believe Mahomes has solidified his place in the conversation. However, Deion Mahomes, an ""old-school"" man, remains a strong supporter of Brady as the greatest of all time.Deion Sanders, a former Buffaloes coach and NFL Hall of Famer, refused to be swayed by Patrick Mahomes' hype at the 2025 NFL Honors gala, instead choosing Tom Brady in the GOAT debate. ""I'm going with Brady,"" Sanders declared confidently. ""I'm old school. Not old fool.""Despite concerns, Mahomes remains a champion with a record of seven Super Bowl titles, five Super Bowl MVPs, and three league MVPs. His longevity, dominance, and rings continue to reign supreme. Mahomes, a three-time Super Bowl winner and MVP, is being hailed as Brady's successor.However, Sanders has been lukewarm on Mahomes. When celebrating Kansas City's AFC Championship win, Sanders praised Travis Kelce, head coach Andy Reid, and even wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins-but left out the Chiefs' QB.""I got mad love for my brother, Travis Kelce, and I'm proud of all that he's accomplished,"" Sanders tweeted. ""And I'm so darn happy for one of our game's greatest receivers, DeAndre Hopkins, Coach Reid & the Chiefs. Wow, God is good.”Kayla Nicole inquired about Prime's stance on the Kendrick vs Drake controversy, and he provided a detailed response. “Come on man you know I’m a Drake guy. I’m Weezy, I’m Mack Maine. You know I’m on that side.”Deion Sanders revealed a bias towards rappers, but did not confirm if he had spoken with Drake after the beef erupted. Prime admitted, “I haven’t spoken to him about this. I love them both but it shouldn’t be all this foolishness. I don’t like all this. Can we all just get along? Can we love one another? Like unity, you and I. I don’t like that. Come on this is entertainment… I don’t like to see brothers going at it.”Also Read: “Never gets a flag”: Fans call out Travis Kelce for getting away with taunting against the Philadelphia Eagles Deion Sanders is reportedly downplaying the contributions of quarterback Mahomes, despite his significant role in the Chiefs' victory over Buffalo. Mahomes may challenge Brady's legacy, but Sanders is not yet there, and the GOAT debate is intensifying as Sanders doubles down on his pick.","Deion Sanders met Travis Kelce's ex-girlfriend Kayla Nicole in New Orleans.

Lewis Hamilton Feels ""Invigorated"" as He Begins His Ferrari Journey



Lewis Hamilton's First Ferrari Is Here! 🔴

Formula 1’s latest season launch event in London witnessed a historic moment as Lewis Hamilton made his first public appearance as a Ferrari driver. The seven-time World Champion, who recently made the sensational switch from Mercedes, was greeted with thunderous applause from 15,000 spectators at The O2 Arena. Presented by comedian Jack Whitehall, the event set the stage for an exciting new chapter in Hamilton’s illustrious career.Lewis Hamilton, now 40, has already familiarized himself with Ferrari’s iconic red colors, having taken an older Scuderia car for a spin at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya in January. However, the upcoming week holds even greater significance as he prepares to sample the 2025 model during Ferrari’s official shakedown before pre-season testing in Bahrain. Speaking about his transition, Hamilton shared his enthusiasm for the new challenge ahead.“It’s such a great night to be here amongst all of you,” Hamilton said to the electrified crowd. Reflecting on his current mindset, he added, “I think the word I’m thinking of is invigorated. I feel so full of life, and so much energy, because everything’s new. I’m just focused on what’s up ahead. I’m so proud to be a part of the team, something new and exciting for me.”Alongside Hamilton, Ferrari’s long-time star Charles Leclerc also expressed his excitement about the season ahead and his new teammate. Having spent six years with the team, Leclerc has his eyes set on achieving his lifelong ambition.“If I have to choose one word, I was going to say fulfilment – fulfilling my childhood dream of becoming a Formula 1 World Champion,” Leclerc noted. “I think the one that fits better is probably honoured – honoured to be part of this team. It’s been a dream of mine since being a child, growing up with the red dream. I’m living the dream and I’m just super honoured to be part of this team. I’m really, really looking forward to hopefully writing history alongside Lewis.”With pre-season testing set to kick off in Bahrain on February 26, teams will have just over a week to fine-tune their cars before the season opener in Australia on March 16. Melbourne’s Albert Park has been a favorable qualifying ground for Hamilton, with eight pole positions to his name, but he has only secured victory there twice, the last time being in 2015.Meanwhile, Jack Whitehall couldn’t resist making light of Hamilton’s move, joking, ""It's everyone's worst nightmare. Your partner of 10 years running off with an Italian stallion."" The comment summed up the impact of Hamilton’s blockbuster transfer, which has already become the biggest storyline ahead of the 2025 season.Also Read: Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc gear up as Ferrari reveals SF-25 for 2025 F1 season Hamilton’s journey with Ferrari marks one of the most significant shifts in modern F1 history. After 12 seasons with Mercedes, where he made his name as the most successful driver of all time, his decision to don the prancing horse emblem signals the beginning of an exciting new legacy. As the countdown to Melbourne continues, all eyes will be on how this legendary partnership unfolds.","Lewis Hamilton made his first public appearance as a Ferrari driver.

PAKISTAN vs NEW ZEALAND LIVE STREAMING

The Champions Trophy will make a triumphant return to the cricket calendars today after more than seven years, starting with hosts Pakistan taking on New Zealand at the revamped Karachi Stadium .Cricket has seen a shift recently, with One Day Internationals (ODIs) vying for attention while the T20 format has captured the spotlight for its exciting, fast-paced games.With the Champions Trophy back, fans are likely to rekindle their passion for ODIs. Since Sarfaraz Ahmed led Pakistan to victory in 2017 against their arch-rival India with a commanding 180-run win in the final, many developments have unfolded.It is also a monumental moment and achievement for Pakistan as a country and the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) in itself. Not long ago, the country was struggling to get teams to set foot on their soil. Pakistan's ""home"" matches would take place in the UAE due to safety concerns. Ever since the 2009 attack on the Sri Lankan team bus, tours to the region dwindled with Zimbabwe the first team to make a visit in 2015. Then a World XI played a T20I series in 2017 with subsequent tours now by Sri Lanka, West Indies, Bangladesh, England, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.With the Champions Trophy, Pakistan will host their first major ICC tournament in 29 years with last being the 1996 ODI World Cup.In the opening match, Pakistan will face New Zealand, a team that has had the upper hand over the defending champions lately. The Blackcaps are well-acquainted with the conditions, having played more ODIs in Pakistan (11) than any other team since 2019.Given their recent victory over Pakistan in the ODI tri-nations final just five days ago in Karachi, New Zealand will be confident going into this clash.In their encounters during the 2019 and 2023 ICC ODI World Cups, Pakistan managed to secure victories, showcasing their resilience and ability to rise to the occasion.Looking at both sides' head-to-head record in the Champions Trophy, both teams squared off against each other in 2000, 2006, and 2009, with the Kiwis emerging victorious on all three occasions.Overall, in the ODIs, Pakistan and New Zealand have been neck-to-neck in their past 11 matches. The Kiwis have won five and lost six; however, in their past four meetings, New Zealand have won thrice.Pakistan captain Mohammad Rizwan : “A global event has come to Pakistan after 29 years, so I believe the entire nation is celebrating this historic occasion. There are no doubts about our performance, we have worked hard and learned from our mistakes. We hope that we play well tomorrow Insha’Allah.“Our sole focus is on winning the tournament for the country and our people and we hope that we achieve the desired results,” he said.New Zealand captain Tom Latham : ""I'm sure, the opening game of the Champions Trophy is really special, and to be playing against the host nation is going to be a great occasion. I guess if you look throughout the tri-series and the warm-up game, we've been fortunate enough that everyone throughout the squad has had some time in the middle, whether it be with the ball or with the bat.""""It's nice that we've been playing well, I think throughout the tri-series we were put under pressure in all three games and we obviously managed to overcome that and come out on the right side.""Latham gave a semi-update on Rachin Ravindra, the all-rounder who suffered a nasty head injury after struggling to pick up the ball under the lights on February 8.""He will train tonight so then we will get a bit more of an indication of how he's going. So, his recovery is obviously going well, but just need to make sure. It's obviously a pretty nasty injury. So especially, when you're involved with the head, you want to make sure things are right. So, yeah, just going through the protocols that he needs to go through and we'll wait and see.""Coming into the tournament, there was major concern in the hosts' camp with Haris Rauf picking up an injury in the tri-series. He got injured in the first game and didn't play a part since.Rizwan gave him a vote of confidence. ""Yesterday he (Rauf) bowled about 6 to 8 overs approximately, before that he bowled about 60%, and today he is bowling with full rhythm today. He has put in a lot of effort in the gym and here as well. He is saying that he doesn't have any problem. So, I hope he is fully fit.""Pakistan vs New Zealand is scheduled to begin at 2:30 PM IST. It will be broadcast on JioStar - Star Sports and Sports18 channels. It will be live streamed on JioHotstar.","The Champions Trophy gets underway today with Pakistan taking on New Zealand in Karachi.

head coach, who has guidedboth in the NBA and with Team USA , recently reflected on a defining moment in Curry’s illustrious career. In Netflix ’s Court of Gold docuseries , which chronicles Team USA’s journey to the 2024 Paris Olympics gold medal, Kerr shared a game-changing play that enhanced Curry’s legendary status.The gold medal game against France was an intense battle as Team USA fought to maintain control in the final minutes. However, amid the mounting pressure, Stephen Curry delivered a clutch three-pointer that all but sealed the victory. The shot, executed with his signature poise, sent the crowd into a frenzy and left an indelible mark on basketball history.“When it went in, the reaction of the crowd, of our bench, of France’s team—it was one of the greatest moments in basketball history,” Steve Kerr stated in the docuseries.The docuseries offers fans a behind-the-scenes look at the crucial possession that led to Curry’s iconic shot. As the game neared its climax, Kerr and the coaching staff were discussing their next move when Curry himself stepped up and signaled for a play known as “Ear Tug.”“With a few minutes left, we were discussing what we were going to run, and so Steph came over and [tugs his ear]. We call the play ‘Ear Tug,’ it’s just a cleared-side pick-and-roll with Steph and LeBron [James]. Steph just basically said, ‘Give me the ball and I know where I want it, they can’t guard that,’” Kerr revealed.The confidence in Curry’s decision-making was justified. The play unfolded perfectly, as LeBron James delivered a behind-the-back pass to Curry. The ball left his hands and swished through the net, giving Team USA a decisive lead. Reflecting on the play, Curry explained why he called for it and how it played out exactly as he envisioned.“Ear Tug, for me, was a play that could kind of just get us organized and calm the momentum down,” Curry said. “LeBron had the ball, and I wanted him to get downhill. When I set the screen and came off, he threw that behind-the-back pass and the ball was in my hands before I could even think about what was happening.”His celebration after the shot— a calm-down gesture —was as much for himself as it was for the team. “I did like the little ‘Calm down’ celebration, I was really kind of talking to myself, because you understand these four minutes will define our Team USA Olympic legacies,” he added.Kerr, who has witnessed Curry’s greatness for years, admitted that even now, the superstar continues to amaze him.“At this point, I am no longer surprised by anything Steph Curry does, but he continues to awe me. He’s capable of doing the unbelievable, but at this point, it’s believable because it’s Steph.”Also Read: NBA All Star Game 2025: Golden State Warriors' Stephen Curry Bags the MVP Accolade Curry’s Olympic heroics were written as one of the crucial chapters in the victory for Team USA alongside his astonishing individual legacy.","Steve Kerr shared a game-changing play that enhanced Stephen Curry’s legendary status.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin. The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee. England completely skipped Saturday's practice, but many India players also skipped the optional session.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118081067,imgsize-126924,width-400,resizemode-4/118081067.jpg"

The build-up to the return of the Champions Trophy after more than seven years has been nothing short of dramatic, but the three-week entertainment is finally set to begin with things settling in time for the action on the field to begin with the opening game between hosts Pakistan and New Zealand today, February 19.The competition will witness eight teams competing at four venues. India's matches are scheduled in Dubai, while the remaining fixtures are set for Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi in Pakistan, which returns to hosting an International Cricket Council (ICC) event for the first time since they co-hosted the 1996 World Cup.The 2017 winners Pakistan are also the defending champions.The tournament's organisation, following an eight-year gap, required overcoming numerous challenges. It holds particular significance amidst ongoing discussions about the position of ODIs in the current cricket world.No recent cricket tournament has faced such significant challenges stemming from geopolitical conflicts, rigid stances by two key participating cricket boards (India and Pakistan) and concerns about venue preparedness in the official host nation.The first match presents an intriguing contest -- an unpredictable yet skilful Pakistan squad facing New Zealand, an opponent that prioritises systematic approach above all else.However, the tournament's most anticipated encounter arrives on February 23 when India clash with Pakistan, bringing forth the usual surge of memories, sentiments, political statements and online discourse.This high-profile encounter will take place in Dubai, as India maintained its firm stance against travelling to Pakistan, citing safety issues.Beyond team dynamics, certain players aim to make this tournament a defining moment in their careers -- and none among them is bigger than Indian legends Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma.Their accomplishments and influence in contemporary cricket remain unparalleled. Now, as these two outstanding players approach the culmination of their illustrious careers, they aspire to conclude on a triumphant note.Regardless of the results, it seems unlikely that Kohli and Rohit will continue in India's ODI framework post the Champions Trophy. But nothing of that sort can be said with certainty despite the two already bidding adieu to the T20Is after the T20 World Cup last year.A fitting farewell tribute for Kohli and Rohit would coincide with the emergence of promising talents like Shubman Gill, who are poised to lead India's next cricketing generation.But a subpar performance in this tournament could jeopardise their likely desire to continue playing Tests, potentially prompting selectors to reassess their positions before India's tour of England in June.Failing to secure the Champions Trophy could place India's head coach Gautam Gambhir's position under review.Though India's recent victory over England in T20Is and ODIs at home offered Gambhir some breathing space, it cannot overshadow the team's struggles against New Zealand and Australia.However, clinching a global trophy would significantly strengthen his position.For the team as a whole, India aim to secure their first ICC trophy in the 50-over format since their 2013 Champions Trophy victory under Mahendra Singh Dhoni.India are pooled alongside Pakistan, New Zealand and Bangladesh. The 2013 winners will face Bangladesh on February 19, Pakistan on February 23 and New Zealand on March 2.Despite fading from cricket's spotlight recently, they remain capable of springing a surprise and can't be treated lightly or considered as pushovers.India's neighbours and arch-rivals must maintain composure and resilience during crucial moments. The host nation could prove formidable if they avoid focusing just on their match against India and stop viewing it as the ultimate challenge. Their bowling unit excels in pace, while batters such as Fakhar Zaman and Salman Ali Agha possess the ability to dominate opposition attacks.The Kiwis enter a different phase after Trent Boult and Tim Southee's departure. Kane Williamson remains their key player, and they are banking on his performance to secure their first ICC white-ball title despite consistent show in ICC tournaments across formats over the years.Despite the absence of their leading fast bowlers Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood, the Aussies remain formidable. The two-time champions possess a batting lineup well-suited to the ODI format's requirements.Previously dominant in limited-overs cricket, England have experienced a decline as several key players grapple with advancing years and diminishing performance levels. But they have a nice mix of youth and experience with Joe Root and Jos Buttler there to guide the likes of Harry Brook or Ben Duckett.The team, under Temba Bavuma's leadership, seeks to change the so-near-yet-so-far pattern. They reached the T20 World Cup final before losing to India in a dramatic finish to the final in Barbados last year and would want to build on that in the longer version of the two white-ball formats.The Afghans have evolved into a strong limited-overs side, capable of challenging any team with players like Rashid Khan and Rahmanullah Gurbaz in their ranks.","Champions Trophy returns for the first time in more than seven years. India are pooled alongside Pakistan, New Zealand and Bangladesh. The 2013 winners will face Bangladesh on February 19, Pakistan on February 23 and New Zealand on March 2. India's matches are scheduled in Dubai, while the remaining fixtures are set for Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118373212,imgsize-67274,width-400,resizemode-4/118373212.jpg"

Champions Trophy: Pant's trademark no-look sixes and Iyer's clean hits steal the show

Team India arrives for practice amid loud cheers for Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, Hardik Pandya | EXCLUSIVE VISUALS

It's been three days since the Indian cricket team landed in Dubai and the majority of that time has been spent at the ICC Academy. There is very little gap between their first two games versus Bangladesh (February 20) and Pakistan (February 23), and it wasn't a surprise to see the Men in Blue sweat it out for hours at the global cricket body's training facilities not far from the venue of Champions Trophy fixtures.The bowlers had extended spells, batters didn't want to come out of the nets, the fielding coach ensured everyone underwent extended drills and the physios, strength & conditioning coach had a customised recovery plan for every individual.On both days - February 16 and February 17 - every squad member applied those crucial touches to their respective game before the multi-nation tournament gets underway. The order in which they honed their skills could be a subtle hint of the Playing XI, for the first game at least, but that had no say on the intensity they operated with.Shubman Gill might have created a record of sorts for the hours he spent batting; Rishabh Pant played with pain but smashed plenty with disdain; Rohit Sharma looked to find that touch; Virat Kohli seemed assured; KL Rahul flexed his batting muscle but the highlight across sessions was the batting of Shreyas Iyer and Hardik Pandya . The two were at their belligerent best and were severe against spin. A lot of ball-watching was essential as they smashed plenty out of the training ground and kept everyone on their toes.As far as bowlers are concerned, Mohammed Shami put fitness concerns, if any, to rest as the experienced seamer bowled lengthy spells during both sessions. He still has compression sleeves protecting the knees but there was no lack of rhythm when he operated with the new ball with Arshdeep Singh before Harshit Rana joined in the fast-bowling net. The spinners - all five of them - had the far net and there were plenty of fireworks as batters went bang, bang from the word go.Amid all the action and high-intensity preparations, the mood remained very upbeat as the players engaged in regular banter with each other. The warm-up and fielding drills served a lot of entertainment, and Arshdeep Singh was on the receiving end of a lot of sledging from the opposite group when his turn to hit the target would come. Senior players Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma and Hardik Pandya joined in, and even fielding coach T Dilip got rapturous cheers when he took a stylish catch in the deep with the big glove on.Head coach Gautam Gambhir was very upbeat and played his part in the fun activities before the serious business got underway. He would do plenty of one-on-one conversations with players and support staff but was mostly stationed between the three nets so that he could keep an equal eye on the action. The last two days could well have been the most intense training days of the Champions Trophy as the action will soon take centrestage and India could have a light session on eve of the match. There is a possibility of them training at the Dubai International Stadium to get a feel of the venue and get used to the ring of fire, which could be an issue for the first-timers as it has its own set of challenges and is very different from the usual tower floodlights.The body language of all players was positive, the camaraderie was in full display and they seemed very relaxed during both afternoon and evening sessions. The little bit of free time was used by some players to take a trip to the famous Dubai Mall while most preferred food delivery from their preferred joints.The action will take centrestage on February 20 but the Men in Blue have certainly managed to tick the boxes they would have liked during their little preparatory period.","The Indian cricket team have been training at the ICC Academy in Dubai.

Team India undergoes intense training in Dubai ahead of Champions Trophy | Exclusive Visuals

Solid batting lineup (at last)

India’s Champions Trophy 2025 schedule:

India vs Bangladesh on February 20 in Dubai

India vs Pakistan on February 23 in Dubai

India vs New Zealand on March 2 in Dubai

India's Champions Trophy squad:

Rohit Sharma (c), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul, Rishabh Pant, Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav, Harshit Rana, Mohd. Shami, Arshdeep Singh, Ravindra Jadeja, Varun Chakaravarthy.

NEW DELHI: A year before the 50-over World Cup at home in 2023, India played 30 ODIs in order to find the right balance and the right combination. As a result, India had a near faultless show - up until that forgettable evening in Ahmedabad.With the ICC Champions Trophy in the offing, things are the complete opposite. Chasing a spot in the World Test Championship (WTC) final for a third cycle running, India have played the longest format for the most part. Since losing to Australia in November 2023, India have played just nine ODIs - the fewest of the eight teams that will compete in Pakistan and Dubai. Overall, only Ireland has played fewer matches than India in this period.In the last 12 months, that number has been reduced to just six matches - three in Sri Lanka and three against England at home this month. While Sri Lanka shattered India's series streak over them, India had little trouble romping past England.With few ODIs to go back on, selectors and team management had a tricky time deciding the playing XI versus England. In the first ODI, Harshit Rana played over Arshdeep Singh despite the left-arm seamer being part of the squad. Harshit, however, has made the journey to Dubai since Jasprit Bumrah's injury.The absence of Bumrah with a back injury is arguably the biggest challenge for India going into the Champions Trophy. ""My concern is they [India] are going to miss Jasprit Bumrah, there is no doubt he will be a big absence and I think they will feel it very strongly,"" wrote 2013 Champions Trophy winner Shikhar Dhawan in his column for the ICC.""For me, he is the best bowler in the world, and his accuracy is hard to replicate. He is also a very calm character and that is crucial in a huge ICC event like this,"" he added.How do you find a suitable replacement for the Player of the Tournament in the T20 World Cup and then the Player of the Series in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy? By bringing in the highest wicket-taker from the ODI World Cup, for one.After playing a lengthy will-he-won't-he game on his return from multiple injuries, Mohammed Shami played his first India game in 14 months this January. In the four matches - two T20Is and two ODIs - the returns have been modest. He's posted figures of 0/25, 3/25, 1/38 and 1/66 in the four fixtures. Maybe, more importantly, he hasn't looked to be a fitness casualty. Even though he sported the brace during the nets session in Dubai, the 34-year-old has bowled full tilt without fuss.Yet, there is no clear indication whether he will fill right back into the playing XI or will that place go to Harshit Rana. If form is an indication, the 23-year-old put his name right up the list with 3/33 in the T20I against England and then 3/53 in an ODI versus the same opponents.Dhawan has predicted Rana to have a ""breakout tournament.""""I like his attitude, he is a go-getter and he is not afraid of anything. He accepts challenges and we have seen in the England series that he is in form. I am sure he will look to seize this opportunity and, if he does, he could provide a real x-factor for India,"" stated the southpaw.After some horrible shows with the bat against New Zealand and Australia in the Test matches, India looked like a well-oiled machine against England in the shorter formats. Shubman Gill , who slammed a ton in Ahmedabad, and Shreyas Iyer have been in good form which helps the team take away the dependency on the senior batters in Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli. They, too, found runs in the ODI series. The India skipper produced 119 runs sandwiched between two single digit returns. Kohli, meanwhile, raised his bat after a half century in Ahmedabad.At the top of the order, the Rohit-Gill combination has been a fruitful pairing for India. Since 2023, Rohit and Gill have made 1874 runs as an opening pair in 27 innings, averaging 72.07, including six 100-plus and 11 fifty-plus standsPresence of Hardik Pandya , Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel and KL Rahul down the order gives the team the solidity it needs to produce big totals.",India have played just nine ODIs since losing to Australia in November 2023.

Bayern Munich clinched their spot in the Champions League's last 16 with a last-gasp goal against Celtic on Tuesday. The German giants will be joined by Club Brugge and Benfica , who also progressed to the next round. But it wasn't to be for AC Milan , who made a painful exit after a draw with Feyenoord .Bayern, who held a 2-1 advantage from the away leg, struggled to extend their lead at home. Harry Kane came close but struck the crossbar in the first half, while it was the visitors from Scotland who took a surprising lead after 63 minutes when Nicolas Kuehn, who previously played for Bayern, capitalised on Kim Min-jae's defensive error to slot the ball into the bottom corner.That meant the tie was heading for extra time, but Bayern ultimately would not need to go that far as they scored in the fourth minute of injury time.Davies scored from close range to level the match at 1-1, securing Bayern's progression with a 3-2 aggregate victory in the prestigious European competition.The draw scheduled for Friday will reveal whether Kompany's side faces Bayer Leverkusen or Atletico Madrid in the round of 16.Earlier, seven-time European Cup winners Milan were eliminated by Feyenoord, following their 1-1 draw at San Siro. It took the Dutch club through 2-1 on aggregate.Santiago Gimenez, facing his former team after his recent departure, scored from close proximity in the opening minute, bringing Milan level on aggregate.The match took a turn when Milan's Hernandez received his second yellow card early in the second period, resulting in his dismissal. Carranza equalised for Feyenoord with 73 minutes on the clock.In the closing moments, Feyenoord's Read was dismissed with a red card, though his team had already secured their progression in the tie.They now await to face either Inter Milan or Arsenal in the last-16 stage.In Lisbon, Benfica secured their progression despite a 3-3 home draw with Monaco, winning 4-3 on aggregate, setting up a clash with either Barcelona or Liverpool.The Portuguese side, who had secured a 1-0 away victory in the previous week, strengthened their position when Kerem Akturkoglu found the net halfway through the opening period.Monaco mounted a strong response as Takumi Minamino and Eliesse Ben Seghir scored before and after the interval, bringing the aggregate score level.Vangelis Pavlidis converted from the spot, marking his seventh goal in six Champions League appearances, levelling the match at 2-2, before Monaco's substitute George Ilenikhena responded with another goal.However, the tie swung decisively back towards Benfica as Orkun Kokcu made it 3-3 on the night in the 84th minute.Young sensation Chemsdine Talbi netted twice to help Club Brugge secure a 3-1 away win against Atalanta in Italy, sealing a comprehensive 5-2 aggregate victory.Following Talbi's double, Ferran Jutgla added a brilliant goal as the Belgian side built upon their 2-1 home advantage from the previous week's first leg. They will now face either Lille or Aston Villa in the round of 16.Despite Atalanta's 29 shots at goal, they fell victim to counter-attacks from the visitors, with Ademola Lookman's goal early in the second half providing little comfort.Lookman missed from the penalty spot and Atalanta skipper Rafael Toloi received a red card in the closing stages, leading to Atalant's elimination.","Bayern Munich secure their place in the Champions League's last 16 with a last- gasp goal against Celtic on Tuesday.
