Cam Newton shared his dissatisfaction seeing his former teammates honored except him

The Carolina Panthers honored their franchise icons on a field in Munich, Germany, by playing the game against Giants. Luke Kuechly, Steve Smith, Thomas Davis, and Jonathan Stewart were all present while Cam Newton, the former MVP and Panthers legend, wasn't. Newton said that he was disappointed with the organization and how his feelings about honoring his former teammates could be disregarded. He also recalled a game where he took his son to Bank of America Stadium; there were no pictures of him.Carolina Panthers greatest quarterback in its history was shocked in the team's Charlotte facility in a 7-on-7 tournament trip last year. Cam Newton shared that on his podcast, 4th and 1. ""We went into the Panthers' facility and you mean to tell me one of the greatest Panthers to ever play ain't up [on the walls] nowhere? I'm talking nowhere.""""Who brought it to my attention? My son,"" he continued. ""So as a man, when you have to explain to your son, 'Daddy, where's your picture?'"" Newton claimed the Panthers' reasoning was because he isn't retired yet. ""At this particular point in time the question was, 'Oh, we don't know if Cam's retired yet.' Newsflash: I'm never going to retire. I know I played my last piece of football. It don't matter to me to officially retire.”In fact, the three-time Pro Bowler added he wasn't even approached to join in on fellow former Panthers stars Luke Kuechly and Thomas Davis' team ambassadorship of their latest trip to Germany. ""I didn't even know certain opportunities even existed,"" Newton said in a somber tone. ""So did it hurt my feelings? Yeah, it did. I'm like damn, bro. I gave this city everything.”Also Read: “I think so”: Aaron Rodgers spoke about his future in the league and if he wants to play in 2025 The Panthers excluded him in light of a technicality because he is considered a free agent as he never gave them notice of his retirement, and putting him as part of the stadium would be tampering. Newton last played the NFL game way back in 2021, and since then, hasn't dressed for a game. The Panthers can be countering this; the fact that they didn't uphold him suggests that the system has placed its priorities misguidedly and that the Panthers failed to uphold such a move.","The Carolina Panthers honored their franchise icons on a field in Munich, Germany, by playing the game against Giants.

Tom Brady signs and throws signed football at crowd

Tom Brady , seven-time Super Bowl champion and NFL color commentator, looked like he was on his way to an eighth Super Bowl championship as he entered Madison Square Garden as a retired player for the third time in his life. As he signed a ball to be tossed into the crowd, the announcer at the Knicks game yelled out to the fans that Brady would be throwing the ball out into them, and they responded with a chorus of boos. Brady would watch the Knicks-Nets contest before his Week 11 Fox NFL assignment. He will be in the booth alongside Kevin Burkhardt for Sunday's Bears-Packers matchup at 1 p.m. Eastern Time.Former NFL quarterback Tom Brady had a less than warm welcome at Madison Square Garden by way of New York Knicks fans, who booed him and prompted him to sign a football then toss it into the crowd. Brady attended a cross-town rivalry game against the Brooklyn Nets, which will count towards the NBA Cup group stage. After retiring in 2023, he joined Fox Sports broadcasting for the 2024 NFL season. His next broadcasting appearance is scheduled for the Chicago Bears' Week 11 home game against the Green Bay Packers.Tom Brady showed that not over attitude toward losses he has endured, the last two being from the New York Giants in 2008, has indeed been his style, and he further extended his bold predictions to the Knicks on Jalen Brunson and Josh Hart's podcast, ""Roommates Show.""The retired QB, who is remembered more for football strength, has also made such bold predictions regarding the Knicks before the start of the NBA season. “To win the Super Bowl is just a whole ‘nother thing,” he said in August. “It is probably like getting to the Finals. It is hard to get there. And then once you get there now, you really gotta compete. I have a feeling you’re gonna get there.”Also Read: Tom Brady heaped praises for Cincinnati Bengals WR Ja'Marr Chase and believes he might win the Triple Crown Brady is set to join the broadcast for a game this week, in which the Packers face the Bears, for Fox.

Taylor Swift was shocked by Bills Mafia's 'ruthlessness' last year

The Buffalo Bills and Kansas City Chiefs are set to face off in a highly anticipated game, with the Bills aiming for their sixth consecutive win and the Chiefs maintaining their undefeated record. Taylor Swift , who is dating Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce , may attend the game after her concert in Toronto. Swift experienced a hostile atmosphere during last season's playoff match, raising concerns about the Bills Mafia 's reception.The Kelce-Swift entourage apparently had the ball with their divisional round win at Orchard Park, NY, on their second consecutive Super Bowl as they are said to have shirtless Jason Kelce drink beer with Bills fans. However, the fans of their fame did not leave Western New York with a very sweet taste in their mouths as friend Adam Lefkoe posted that the group had been somewhat rattled by Bills Mafia.""I have heard from people very close that it was not a great experience in Buffalo. It was not. For all parties involved. And I'm talking about the most famous of all the parties,"" Lefkoe said. ""I think that it kind of shocked the Kelce family and everyone related to the Kelce family the reception they got.""He further added, ""I think they were kind of going in being like, 'This is going to be an amazing game with good energy.' And they got there and they experienced Bills Mafia in full form, in its complete ruthlessness. And I think they left and went, 'I don't know if I want to experience that again.'”In a New Heights podcast episode following Buffalo's playoff elimination, Travis Kelce expressed his sarcasm towards Bills Mafia, expressing love and support for the Chiefs, despite their perceived resentment towards them. “There was a lot of hate pulling up to that stadium, man. Understandable it’s a football game, the Bills, coming into their house, they want to make it rowdy. Did it get a little disrespectful? One thousand percent. Did it get a little extra? One thousand percent.”Kelce added, “Some things were said about the families. Some pretty inappropriate things were said about Pat Mahomes, it was pretty whack. I get it, coming into a hostile environment. I respect it, but I just wanted to make sure [they] knew it wasn’t mutual.” Jason Kelce was unfazed and said, “I mean, honestly, one of the most fun experiences I’ve ever had from start to finish.”Also Read: Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift Face Safety Challenges Ahead of Week 11 Game: Will Taylor Swift Attend Chiefs vs. Bills Amid Safety Concerns?

Pakistan's Don Plots Against Aaqib Javed | India Lost Before BG Trophy Began | Basit Ali

Dhruv Jurel Makes a Solid Impression With Gritty 80 vs AUS at the MCG

India opted for closed-door practice sessions in Perth ahead of the series-opening Test of the Border Gavaskar Trophy (BGT), and former Pakistan batter Basit Ali feels it shows that the Indian team isn't confident about their title-defence.India have had a strong hold on the BGT, thwarting Australia's challenge for a decade. India's reign also includes historic triumphs Down Under on their last two tours.But going into this BGT, India haven't shown consistent red-ball form and got washed out 0-3 in the home Test series against New Zealand before flying to Australia. Add to that the woeful form of their star batters Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma , the problems seem compounded.India flew to Australia without Rohit, who recently became father again, and he won't be available for the opening match of the five-Test series. The visitors canceled their official warm-up match against India 'A' to spend more time in the nets and played an intra-squad match, which were hidden from public view at the WACA stadium.Before that, wicketkeeper-batsman Dhruv Jurel, was flown to Australia early to play in the unofficial Test between India A and Australia A in Melbourne. Grabbing the opportunity, Jurel stuck in to impress with knocks of 80 and 68 in the two innings to knock at the doors of head coach Gautam Gambhir for a place in the eleven for the Perth Test.""My personal opinion is that Jurel, who is in form, should be included in the playing eleven,"" said Basit in a video on his YouTube channel. ""In Australia, whosoever is in form should be played...So what if he (usually) bats at No. 5 or 6! Push him to No. 3. He has guts, is a good player of the cut and pull shots. It might pay.""Basit added that close-door practice sessions only show that India's confidence is low.""The Indian team's confidence at the moment is down. Chhup ke toh practice kar rahe hain, maafi ke saath bolna pad raha hai (they are practising behind closed doors, sorry to say that)...The kind of preparation they should have had before the series is not there, whether you reach 12 days before or 12 months before (the tour). This is not the way. They should have played (warm-up) matches and tackled their (Australian) bowling,"" he reckoned.Before ending his views on the Indian team's readiness, Basit had a piece of advice for Virat Kohli, who hasn't been at the top of his form, especially in Test cricket.""Let me give one piece of advice. I think Khaleel (Ahmed) is there. Practice more against the left-arm (fast) bowler, especially Virat Kohli,"" he said, before adding that he is looking forward to the race between Kohli and former Australia captain Smith.""I want to see who scores more runs between Virat Kohli and Steve Smith. Will Virat score 400 runs in the series? He should, because the ball comes onto the bat (in Australia), and he does well when that happens.""The first Test of the BGT begins in Perth on November 22.","India opted for closed-door practice sessions in Perth ahead of the series- opening Test of the Border Gavaskar Trophy (BGT) Former Pakistan batter Basit Ali feels it shows that the Indian team isn't confident about their title- defence.

The Kansas City Chiefs suffered their first loss of the season, losing 30-21 to the Buffalo Bills , dropping them to 9-1 on the 2024 campaign.

His first throw of the day was a blooped pass, and Buffalo's Taylor Rapp gathered it, lighting up social media. Mahomes was forced to make an uncharacteristic mistake, which triggered a strong discussion on the field. After the interception, the Bills drove down the field before James Cook punched it in for a three-yard score.Mahomes and the Chiefs floundered on their second drive, allowing for a three-and-out with no positive yardage or completions. The next time, Xavier Worthy caught a 10-yard touchdown pass. Losing their undefeated streak was certainly not ideal since you go into every game looking to get a win. But following a tough loss to his conference rival, quarterback Patrick Mahomes of the Chiefs seemed quite unruffled.""That's a good football team,"" the signal-caller said in his post-game press conference, talking about the Bills. ""Nothing to hang your head on, losing to them. We feel like we can play better, so we'll get back to work and try and use this as a spark so that we can be a better football team in the end.""He further added, ""We feel like we can play better, so we'll get back to work and try and use this as a spark so that we can be a better football team in the end."" Mahomes completed the Buffalo game with 23/32 passing and three touchdowns, but also turned the ball over twice, including an interception on their first offensive play.

He stayed down for a moment before limping to the bench. Shortly after, Wade headed back to the locker room for further evaluation.Hornets’ LaMelo Ball scored an astonishing 31 points. However, Cavs’ Ty Jerome emerged as the game-changer as he stepped into the starting role with Mitchell sidelined and finished with a career-best 24 points. His contribution was quite important for the team. The Cavs' frontcourt also delivered their best with Jarrett Allen putting up 25 points and 15 rebounds. Further, Mobley added 23 points, 11 rebounds, and sealed the win with a crucial block on Brandon Miller in the final minutes.Also Read: NBA hits Hornets’ LaMelo Ball with $100K fine over anti-gay slur As for the Hornets, bad news has surrounded the team.

NEW DELHI: A fit-again Mohammed Shami recently made a comeback to competitive cricket after a year-long injury hiatus, appearing for Bengal in a Ranji Trophy game and looked in good rhythm.In the clash against Madhya Pradesh, Shami bowled 43.2 overs with good control and picked up a seven-wicket haul in the match. But former India opener Aakash Chopra feels that pushing the veteran pacer into Test cricket after just one game post recovery will be too much to ask for.With India set to lock horns with Australia Down Under in the blockbuster Border-Gavaskar Trophy , calls for Shami's inclusion have been made as team's bowling looks inexperienced.India's pace department includes vice-captain Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj and Akash Deep besides seam-up allrounder Nitish Kumar Reddy, Prasidh Krishna and Harshit Rana. Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin and Washington Sundar are the three spinners in the squad.Chopra feels that Shami looked 'undercooked' in the domestic game and putting him in Test cricket, that too in Australia, so early might turn out to be a questionable call.""Mohammed Shami has played a match (Ranji). We weren't able to see much of his bowling as it was not being streamed. We did see the wickets he took. I'd say he is undercooked. Honestly, we want Shami to be there (in Australia) because Bumrah, Shami, Siraj -- there's a different ring to it. In Bumrah, Siraj, Akash Deep combination, we can see a bit of weakness. Lack of experience can be felt,"" Chopra said in a video on his YouTube channel.""To push Shami into Test cricket so early will be a questionable call because he hasn't played since last one year. You play one match after a year and suddenly you put Shami in a Test game, that won't be fair. If there's a breakdown during the match or if there is no form, then everyone will ask 'why was there so much desperation to play Shami?'"" he said.Chopra also pointed out that the grounds in Australia can take a toll on the body of the players. That in turn raises chances of a flare-up or a fresh injury.""Secondly, the grounds in Australia are very soft, so there are chances of recurrence of injury. I would say Shami should take more time. We all want Shami to play as soon as possible, but we shouldn't hurry his return,"" Chopra added.The first Test between India and Australia starts from November 22 in Perth.","Mohammed Shami recently made a comeback to competitive cricket after a year-long injury hiatus.

Mohammed Shami returns, India get boost ahead of Border-Gavaskar Trophy | BTB Highlights

Siraj has lacked rhythm in last few Tests & shorter run-up could be the reason | #beyondtheboundary

Aussie top order not in best form

Conflicted about waking up early on Friday for the start of the Border Gavaskar Trophy? You clearly have a reason after what happened over the last one month in India, when Rohit Sharma's boys were handed a 0-3 humiliation by New Zealand at home.The World Test Championship Final berth, which looked likely before the start of the season, now looks a distant dream as Australian pacers lick their lips on a spicy Perth surface, known for its tennis-ball bounce.But if you can look through the mist of disappointment, you may figure a hint of silver lining as the Indian side prepares for a response. What exactly should give the Indian cricket fan some hope ahead of this massive challenge?It's the Indian pace attack, which is one of the best in the business. In Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj , Akash Deep , Prasidh Krishna and Harshit Rana , the fast bowlers have all the ingredients to do well in Australia. This lot hardly had a role to play in the New Zealand debacle as the spinners called the shots on surfaces which were a little too spin-friendly for everybody's liking.The pitches in Australia will be completely different. The crucial thing about bowling in Australia is to understand the lengths to hit. While Bumrah, arguably the best paceman in the world across formats, has all the experience, Siraj, too, is a perfect fit for the fast and bouncy tracks. If Mohammed Shami can return sometime later on in the series, it will be the icing on the cake.Bumrah had 21 wickets in the 2018-19 series win. In Brisbane in January 2021, Siraj got 5-73 in the second innings that kept India's target to manageable proportions and allowed Rishabh Pant to go for that almighty chase.""Akash Deep has shown that he can be equally effective both against right-handers and lefthanders. He should be the third pacer and if there is a little bit of help for the seamers, all three can be as good as their Aussie counterparts,"" former India paceman L Balaji, who has experience of touring Down Under, told TOI.Balaji, who was edged out by Morne Morkel for the bowling coach's job a couple of months ago, wants India to play with only four bowlers in the first Test, the fourth being Ravindra Jadeja ""You don't need more than four bowlers on a spicy surface in Australia. The batters have to give a minimum of 250 to allow the bowlers to stay in the fight and for that, a proper batter at No. 7 is necessary,"" Balaji said.That brings us to the most crucial issue, the batting frailties of India in recent times. On a pitch which had a bit of help for pacers in Bengaluru in the first Test against New Zealand, India were bowled out for 46 by the Kiwi pacers, and the Aussie team management must have taken note of that.Having said that, the Australian top-order isn't in the best of form. While Usman Khawaja, in all probability, is playing his last home series, the hosts have a new makeshift opener in Nathan McSweeney, who will be making his debut in Perth. Marnus Labuschagne and Steve Smith haven't been in great form either, while Mitchell Marsh hasn't been too much of a headache for Indian bowlers ever. That leaves the top-order with Travis Head, a real thorn in the flesh for India in recent times, and a dependable wicketkeeper-batter Alex Carey.But if we have to do a man-to-man analysis, is Carey a better bet than Pant? You can make your own calculations. Add to that the fact that this Australian team, not too long ago, lost a Test against lowly West Indies at home, that exposed all the frailties in their batting.""The Indian bowling attack is perfectly capable of keeping this Australian batting line-up to a score of below 250, especially when there is a bit of help. From there on, it can become a batters' game and the likes of Kohli, Pant, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill (though out of first Test with finger injury), have the capability to score big in Australia,"" Balaji said.It's not going to be easy, but then, historically, when has a tour of Australia been smooth sailing? Be it Melbourne in 1980-81, Perth in 2007-08 or Brisbane in 2020-21, India hit back really hard when the chips were truly down. The Aussies too know that this Indian lot is made of some stern mettle and they experienced that first-hand twice at home not too long ago. Will the trend continue?",India take on Australia in first Test of Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Perth. Rohit Sharma's side were beaten 0-3 by New Zealand at home. India's fast bowlers have all the ingredients to do well in Australia.

Rishabh Pant. The next Test captain | Beyond the Boundary Highlights | TOI Sports

NEW DELHI: Team India would be eyeing their third successive Test series win on the trot in Australia and the Aussies would be looking to go all guns blazing to stop the Indians in their bid in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy .With captain Rohit Sharma set to miss the first Test in Perth, pressure will be on rest of the Indian batters to come good in the series.And the maximum pressure undoubtedly will be on India batting mainstay and former captain Virat Kohli With 6 hundreds from 13 Tests in Australia at an average of 54.08, Kohli has a phenomenal record in Australia but has averaged merely 22.72 in six matches in 2024, the lowest in his career.Former Australia captain Michael Clarke picked Virat Kohli and flamboyant keeper-batter Rishabh Pant to play decisive roles for India to win the series in Australia.""Virat Kohli's record in Australia in phenomenal. I actually think his record is better than what it is in India. I think he's got six hundreds in 13 Tests in Australia,"" Clarke says during an interview.The 36-year-old Kohli has scored just one fifty this year - 70 against New Zealand in the second innings of the first Test at Bengaluru, while his last Test century came in July 2023 against the West Indies.With India set to play the first Test in Perth from November 22, Kohli can hope to strike form from the word go.Kohli has till now played two Tests in Perth - one at the WACA in which he scored 44 and 75 in the two innings in January 2012 which Australia won by an innings and 37 runs.The second Test that Kohli played in Perth was as captain in 2018 and he became the first batsman to score a Test hundred at the new Perth stadium as he scored his 25th Test century at the age of 30.Clarke continues, ""If India are to win this series, it has to be Virat Kohli leading run scorer with Rishabh Pant just behind.""During the fourth and final Test of India's last tour of Australia at the Gabba in January 2021, Rishabh Pant played one of the most iconic innings in Test cricket history.Pant played a fearless, match-winning knock, scoring an unbeaten 89 off 138 balls to chase down 328 runs on the fifth day as India achieved a record-breaking victory at the Gabba, a venue where Australia had been undefeated in Tests for 32 years.The innings highlighted Pant's fearless approach and unyielding belief, even under immense pressure. His aggressive mindset, combined with clever shot selection, helped India pull off one of the greatest chases in Test cricket.This was a major moment in his career and elevated his status as a cricketer who thrives in high-pressure situations and uses his attacking play style to turn games.India need to win 4 Tests in Australia to directly qualify for the World Test Championships final that is scheduled to be held at Lord's in June 2025.",Former Australia captain Michael Clarke picked Virat Kohli and Rishabh Pant to play decisive roles for India to win the series in Australia.

A triple jab rocked Tyson, pushing him to the ropes and signalling a shift in momentum. By Round 4, Tyson’s fatigue became evident, and Paul exploited the opportunity, landing precise body shots and controlling the pace.Heading into the final rounds with a slim 48-47 lead, Paul maintained his composure. Despite the crowd’s chants urging Tyson to mount a comeback, the 27-year-old boxer continued to dictate terms, ultimately securing a unanimous decision.

He also highlighted the star power within the Indian lineup, urging fans to savor their presence.“And they’ll be getting written off for being too old, but people say that all the time, and I just can’t wait to see them play. I just hope, if this is the last time (Kohli) is out here, people enjoy it because he is a superstar, so is Rohit Sharma , so is (Ravi) Ashwin, so is (Ravi) Jadeja, so is (Jasprit) Bumrah.""He drew parallels between the Australian and Indian teams, both boasting experienced bowling attacks, and encouraged fans to appreciate these players while they are still active.“It’s the same with the Australians; the bowling attack is a very senior attack now... so really enjoy it while you can; they are not going to be around forever,”To secure a spot in the World Test Championship final at Lord's next year, India needs to win at least four matches in the series.Langer believes India's recent loss to New Zealand might fuel their determination, making them a formidable opponent for Australia.“India losing to New Zealand is a bit like North Melbourne beating Brisbane in the grand final at the moment. And not for one millisecond is that disrespect for New Zealand, because they are the great overachievers; they are brilliant.""He acknowledged New Zealand's achievement in winning the series 3-0, emphasizing the pressure India will face to make amends for their performance.“I think they’d won two Test matches (in India), and to win the series 3-0, that’s an amazing achievement. They’ve just been beaten three-nil by New Zealand, so India will be humbled by that and equally determined to remedy it because the pressure on them will be intense.”","Former Australian cricketer and head coach Justin Langer shared his thoughts on the upcoming Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

Champions Trophy in PAK: More drama as Jay Shah strongly objects PCB's PoK plans

NEW DELHI: The Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ) on Sunday firmly denied reports suggesting Jason Gillespie ’s imminent exit as head coach.In a post on X, the PCB stated, “PCB strongly refutes the story. As announced previously, Jason Gillespie will continue to coach the Pakistan side for the two red-ball matches against South Africa.”Media speculation erupted recently, claiming Gillespie was set to be sacked just six months into his tenure.Reports alleged that Gillespie’s reluctance to oversee both red-ball and white-ball teams without a pay increase prompted the PCB to reconsider his role.However, the PCB insists that Gillespie remains committed, at least through the South Africa series.Adding to the turmoil, former Pakistan pacer Aaqib Javed is reportedly lined up to take over as Pakistan’s white-ball coach.Javed, currently serving as the men’s cricket selection convenor, is expected to step into the limited-overs role ahead of Pakistan’s upcoming tour of Zimbabwe, which begins on November 24.This uncertainty around Gillespie's future reflects a broader issue within Pakistan cricket: a pattern of frequent coaching changes undermining team stability.The PCB has faced criticism for its lack of long-term planning and frequent leadership reshuffles.Gillespie’s reported departure would follow a string of quick replacements, including his predecessor Gary Kirsten , who resigned citing insufficient time spent in Pakistan.Gillespie has delivered some notable successes during his short stint, including a 2-1 Test series win over England and a historic ODI series victory in Australia.Yet, these achievements appear overshadowed by the PCB’s apparent impatience and focus on short-term fixes.The PCB’s ability to foster a stable environment will be crucial as the team prepares for high-profile tournaments like the 2025 Champions Trophy .",Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB ) firmly denied reports suggesting Jason Gillespie ’s imminent exit as head coach.

'KL Rahul is going to unleash himself in the next three to five years'

Astrological analysis by Greenstone Lobo on StarPlay: Cricket & Astrology suggests that KL Rahul is going to dominate the next four to five years.""Rahul was once considered a great talent. However, his batting is not flourishing at the moment. He’s not doing well for himself and is creating more trouble as time goes on. The question is: will he overcome this slump and rise again? Will there be a resurrection for KL Rahul?""""Let’s delve into KL Rahul’s astrological aspects. Rahul has a phenomenal horoscope, with Pluto in the third house. Pluto, the most powerful planet in the universe, moves into its own house only once every 250 years. It was at 0° when KL Rahul was born, making it highly significant. This planetary position influences his hands, which are crucial for sports."" said the astrologer.""Rahul also has a powerful seventh house, the house of defeating enemies. Neptune, the lord of the seventh house, is exalted in a favourable star, making him a highly competent player who can outshine his opponents. We’ve seen Rahul at his best: travelling to different parts of the world, smashing bowlers, and dominating his rivals. But why is he struggling now?The astrologer highlighted two main reasons:Mindset Issues""KL Rahul has Mercury in Pisces. If you recall, Rahul Dravid had his Moon in the Pisces zodiac sign. Such placements can make players vulnerable when their confidence is low. Dravid, for example, often adapted his game based on the aggression of his partners, like VVS Laxman . Similarly, KL Rahul seems to feel an immense sense of responsibility, believing he must perform for the entire team’s success. This psychological burden might be hindering his performance. Someone needs to sit down with him to address this.""Astrological Factors""Rahul’s ninth lord is debilitated in the tenth house, which governs career. This weak planetary position is preventing him from converting his intent into results on the field. However, transformation is on the horizon. Pluto is set to undergo a significant shift by the end of this year, with its effects becoming evident by February or March next year."" he added.""This planetary change will likely result in a transformed KL Rahul. If he goes to Australia, he could perform exceptionally well. Selectors should persist with him, as he has the potential to deliver remarkable numbers,""""Looking ahead to the IPL, Rahul is currently without a team. However, he could become a tournament-winning captain for any side that picks him during the auction. Recent IPL winners, like Hardik Pandya and Shreyas Iyer , belong to the 1990s-born generation, and Rahul, born in 1992, fits this pattern."" he further added.""His strong seventh house, ruled by Neptune, indicates a bright future, with the ability to defeat opponents and lead teams to victory. It’s worth noting that Rahul is only 31 years old, with several years left in his career. He has the potential to achieve great things over the next three to five years,""""The best version of KL Rahul is yet to come. He will unleash his full potential, pile up runs, defeat opponents, and win tournaments. To those writing him off: be patient. KL Rahul is here to stay."" he concluded.","Astrological analysis by Greenstone Lobo on StarPlay: Cricket & Astrology suggests that KL Rahul is going to dominate the next four to five years.

NEW DELHI: Former Australian cricketer Matthew Hayden believes India’s recent 3-0 Test series defeat to New Zealand, though disappointing, might ultimately benefit them ahead of the upcoming Border-Gavaskar Trophy .Speaking to the Sydney Morning Herald, Hayden described the whitewash as “the kick up the a*se that India need.” He noted, “Even though India copped a drubbing and were lightweight in terms of performance, playing long-format cricket gives them a preparation advantage.”India’s loss to New Zealand marked a historic low. The Black Caps sealed the clean sweep with a 25-run victory in the third Test at Mumbai’s Wankhede Stadium.This was India’s first home Test series whitewash in over two decades and their first-ever in a three-Test series or more.The result has led to significant introspection within the Indian camp as they prepare for the marquee series against Australia.The Border-Gavaskar Trophy begins on November 22 in Perth, with both teams aiming to assert dominance.Hayden suggested that India’s recent exposure to red-ball cricket might give them a leg up in adapting to the demands of the Test format, unlike Australia, who haven’t played long-format games recently.He remarked that India’s struggles could serve as a wake-up call, motivating them to bounce back stronger against a formidable Australian side.The series promises a packed itinerary, beginning with the opening Test in Perth. The second Test, from December 6-10, will be a day-night clash at Adelaide Oval, under lights.The contest then shifts to Brisbane’s Gabba (December 14-18) before the iconic Boxing Day Test at Melbourne Cricket Ground (December 26-30). The series finale at the Sydney Cricket Ground from January 3-7 could well be the decider.","Former Australian cricketer Matthew Hayden believes India’s recent 3-0 Test series defeat to New Zealand, though disappointing, might ultimately benefit them.

""He is likely to bat at the No 3 spot now,"" a reliable source told TOI.The left-hander, who was recently named in Karnataka's squad for the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, made scores of 36, 88, 26, 1 for India 'A' during the Australia tour.While these performances aren't extraordinary, Padikkal's experience and familiarity with Australian conditions make him the ideal choice as a batting backup. The left-hander had made his Test debut against England earlier this year at Dharamsala and made a 65 while batting at No. 4.Going by sources, there's a good chance that Delhi and Kolkata Knight Riders pacers Harshit Rana , who is yet to get the India cap, may make his Test debut in the first Test at Perth.""Harshit was very impressive in the match simulation at Perth, especially while bowling his bouncers. There's a good chance that he will make his India debut at Perth,"" a source told this paper. Rana has played 10 first-class matches so far, in which he has picked up 43 wickets@24.00, with a best haul of seven for 45 in an innings. The 22-year-old was called as a net bowler during India's home Test series against New Zealand.The youngster impressed for the Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL, taking 19 wickets in 13 matches@20.15, with a best haul of three for 24. When he was called up to bowl in the Team India nets just ahead of the third Test at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, Delhi head coach and former national selector Sarandeep Singh had said that Rana is ready for Test cricket.""If India wants him to play, I would love to see it. If he ends up playing a Test before going to Australia, then it is better for Harshit and for India, too, that they get a good fast bowler,"" Sarandeep had said.","Devdutt Padikkal will be added to the 18-member squad in Rohit's place for the first Test match at the Opus Stadium in Perth.
