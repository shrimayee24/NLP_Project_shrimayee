Your Money Vanished? The Truth About Online Scams & How To Fight Back!





NEW DELHI: Their plan was audacious, modus operandi professional and inspiration crystal clear. This group of alleged cyber criminals in the city weren't just running a con job, they were staging a real-life version of their favourite TV series, Money Heist, even taking on aliases from characters of the Netflix thriller.So, Arpit Mishra adopted the mantle of the cerebral mastermind of the series and was known to his gang as ""professor"". Working under him were key people executing crucial day-to-day operations. Prabhat Vajpayee, who holds a master's degree in computers and used to manage digital communications and perhaps the flow of illicit funds, used the alias, Amanda. Functioning alongside him was Abbas Khan aka Berlin, a core player ensuring the gang kept running smoothly.With the chilling precision of career criminals, the gang duped around 200 people of Rs 50 crore through a fake online trading scheme. According to special CP (law and order) Ravindra Yadav, the operation, code-named Direct Market Account, was an almost perfect digital deception.Posing as elite financial brokers, the syndicate used to lured the targets into their complex web, first securing their faith by making them part of an ""exclusive"" WhatsApp group that promised privileged market tips.""The setup was elaborate: a fake trading platform, phantom shares and the promise of massive returns — a perfect illusion created to secure maximum gains. Funds of unsuspected people were swiftly transferred before the gang locked their accounts, freezing their money and then demanding a fresh ransom under the threat that they would otherwise have to forfeit their entire investment,"" a cop said.This virtual heist, however, came to a sudden halt as police got hot on the gang's trail following a flurry of complaints, and arrested the three suspects. Investigation began when one Rohit filed a case after being duped of Rs 22 lakh. The fraudsters, masquerading as representatives of a reputed financial firm, had lured him into their web.""The cyber crime team of northeast district comprising inspector Rahul Kumar and others pieced together the digital trail, arresting Vajpayee (22) and Khan (24). Mishra (25) was tracked down to Siliguri in West Bengal and nabbed,"" said DCP (northeast) Ashish Mishra.The cops recovered 14 mobile phones, 20 SIM cards, and 32 debit cards from the three, showcasing the scale of their operation. A manhunt is on to nab other members of the syndicate.","Arpit Mishra adopted the mantle of the cerebral mastermind of the series and was known to his gang as ""professor"" Working under him were key people executing crucial day-to-day operations.

'Will Cut Off Your Tongue': Bihar Poll Campaign Turns Ugly, AIMIM Candidate Threatens Tejashwi Yadav

For live updates |

NEW DELHI: As Bihar gears up for the first phase of assembly elections tomorrow, a video from Patna airport has gone viral on social media. The clip shows an unexpected encounter between estranged brothers Tejashwi Yadav and Tej Pratap Yadav The video, captured during a podcast shoot by YouTuber Samdish Bhatia, shows Tej Pratap Yadav, chief of the newly formed Janshakti Janata Dal (JJD), inside a garment store browsing Nehru jackets with Samdish when a party worker informs him that his younger brother, Tejashwi Yadav, is also at the airport.Tejashwi, the Mahagathbandhan’s chief ministerial candidate and RJD leader was seen along with Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) chief Mukesh Sahani.In the viral clip, Tejashwi smiles and greets the YouTuber, asking, “Shopping karwa rahe hai bhaiya?” (Are you shopping with brother?) to which Samdish replies, “Woh humko gift de rahe hai.” (He’s giving me a gift.)Tejashwi responds, “You’re very lucky,” before shaking hands with the YouTuber. Moments later, the camera pans back to Tej Pratap, who quietly watches the exchange before turning away without a word.When asked by youtuber if the brothers are not on talking terms, Tej Pratap pauses, then softly says he’s “doing fine.”The clip has spread rapidly across social media platforms, with users interpreting the silence between the brothers as both awkward and emotional. Many viewers commented that “political differences may divide leaders, but the bond of brotherhood remains.”A widely shared post read, “All the relationships in the world on one side, and the bond of a brother on the other — a brother is a brother after all.”The moment has struck an emotional chord online, coming just a day before the first phase of polling. With both brothers campaigning for rival fronts — Tejashwi for the RJD-led Mahagathbandhan and Tej Pratap leading his own JJD — the scene underscored the widening political and personal rift within the Yadav family.In recent months, tensions between the brothers have been visible. Tej Pratap, who was expelled from the Rashtriya Janata Dal earlier this year for what the party described as “serious breaches of moral and social values,” has repeatedly taken jibes at his younger brother.Just yesterday, he referred to Tejashwi as “still a child” and remarked that “after the elections, we’ll hand him a toy (jhunjhuna)”, suggesting that his brother lacks political maturity.Earlier, Tej Pratap had unfollowed Tejashwi on X, signaling the deepening feud between them.The family feud dates back to earlier controversies involving Tej Pratap. He was expelled from the RJD and reportedly distanced by the Yadav family after a Facebook post in which he claimed to be in a long-term relationship with a woman went viral, sparking a public dispute.The post also reignited discussion about his turbulent marriage with Aishwarya, granddaughter of former Bihar chief minister Daroga Rai, who left their home within months of marriage alleging mistreatment. Their divorce case remains pending in court.Since his expulsion, Tej Pratap has launched his own political outfit, the Janshakti Janata Dal (JJD), and has ruled out any reconciliation with the RJD, saying he would “choose death over returning to that party.” He has maintained that he is guided by “principles and self-respect,” not power.The JJD chief is contesting from the Mahua constituency, while Tejashwi is leading the Mahagathbandhan’s statewide campaign alongside Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) leader Mukesh Sahani, who has been named the alliance’s deputy chief ministerial face.Voting for the Bihar Assembly will take place in two phases on November 6 and 11, with results to be declared on November 14.","The video shows Tej Pratap Yadav, chief of the newly formed Janshakti Janata Dal (JJD), inside a garment store.

Antonio Brown’s Net Worth in 2025: From NFL millions to bankruptcy and legal trouble

More NFL News:

The name Antonio Brown once stood for brilliance on the football field, but today, it’s a symbol of a superstar’s dramatic fall from grace. The former NFL wide receiver, who dazzled fans with his unmatched speed and agility, is now facing serious legal trouble after being arrested for attempted homicide. Authorities confirmed that Brown, extradited from Dubai to Miami, is currently in custody over a May shooting incident outside a boxing event. It marks yet another dark turn in a career that has spiraled from record-breaking seasons to bankruptcy court.At his peak, Brown was among the most electrifying players in the NFL. With the Pittsburgh Steelers, he recorded multiple 1,000-yard seasons and earned seven Pro Bowl selections. His career earnings exceeded $80 million through lucrative contracts, but suspensions, fines, and abrupt team exits eroded much of that fortune. Once set to earn $30 million guaranteed with the Raiders, he ultimately collected only a fraction — about $138,000 that year. His most productive years came with the Steelers, where he earned nearly $69 million and cemented his legacy as one of the league’s elite.According to Celebrity Net Worth, Antonio Brown’s net worth in 2025 stands at approximately -$3 million.In May 2024, the former Super Bowl champion filed for bankruptcy in Florida, declaring $50,000 in assets against roughly $3 million in debt. The filings, cited by multiple outlets, reveal that Brown owes money to former agents, marketing firms, and unpaid child support.However, one major asset remains untouched — his $9 million Fort Lauderdale mansion. Purchased for $6.6 million in 2016, the luxury property is protected under Florida’s homestead law, which prevents a filer’s primary residence from being seized during bankruptcy proceedings.Brown’s post-football ventures, including a brief foray into rap music, failed to revive his financial standing. Legal disputes and unpaid obligations further compounded his problems. He’s faced lawsuits from promoters, allegations of unpaid wages, and a series of arrests that have overshadowed his athletic achievements.Now, at 37, the man who once stood at the pinnacle of professional sports finds himself battling criminal charges and mounting debts. Antonio Brown’s downfall serves as a sobering reminder of how quickly fame and fortune can vanish — and how difficult it is to reclaim them once they’re gone.","Antonio Brown, 37, is facing attempted homicide charges in Miami.

What’s Next for Bellinger

Thecould be on the verge of a blockbuster reunion with one of their former stars. According to a recent prediction, the team may bring back- a former MVP, two-time All-Star, and World Series champion - in what would be a significant offseason move for both sides.After a strong season with the New York Yankees, Bellinger’s future took a sharp turn when he opted out of his contract, setting himself up for another lucrative deal in free agency.Cody Bellinger’s time in New York came to an expected close following the Yankees’ disappointing postseason run. The Yankees fell to the Toronto Blue Jays in the ALDS, ending their hopes of returning to the World Series. Following that exit, speculation immediately began about Bellinger’s next move.“As expected, New York Yankees outfielder Cody Bellinger plans to opt out of his contract and become a free agent next month, a source told ESPN. Bellinger, 30, has a $25 million player option for next season,” ESPN’s Jorge Castillo wrote. (H/t: Sporting News)Just days after the World Series, MLB Network insider Jon Heyman confirmed the move, writing, “Cody Bellinger has opted out.” Now a free agent, the 30-year-old outfielder is in high demand thanks to his versatility and revived form at the plate.During his early years with the Dodgers, Cody Bellinger was one of baseball’s brightest young stars. He captured the 2017 NL Rookie of the Year and followed that with an MVP campaign in 2019. However, his production dipped in 2021 and 2022, leading to the Dodgers’ decision to non-tender him.Since then, Bellinger has found his rhythm again. Playing for the Chicago Cubs and later the Yankees, he hit .281/.388/.477 over the last three seasons - a clear sign of his resurgence.Bleacher Report’s Joel Reuter suggested that a return to Los Angeles could be the perfect move for both parties. “That might make a reunion with Cody Bellinger their best fallback plan,” Reuter noted. He added that Bellinger “could be headed for a $30 million AAV payday,” reflecting his restored market value.Reuniting with Bellinger would not only bring a familiar face back to Los Angeles but also add depth and balance to an already potent Dodgers lineup. His defensive versatility - being able to play both outfield and first base - makes him an ideal fit for a team looking to maintain its dominance.If the Dodgers manage to sign him, they would become an even greater threat to secure a three-peat, adding to their powerhouse roster that already boasts elite talent.• Reinforces their outfield and first base depth• Adds an experienced postseason performer• Strengthens lineup versatility against left and right-handed pitching• Reunites fan favorite with the franchise that drafted himAs free agency opens, multiple teams are expected to pursue Bellinger. However, a reunion with the Dodgers seems both sentimental and strategic. The move would allow him to return to the organization where he rose to stardom while providing the Dodgers with an offensive and defensive asset who knows their system well.Also read: MLB trade rumors: New York Yankees could sign $418 million Chicago Cubs Champion in major offseason move With the Dodgers gearing up for another title run, bringing back a familiar and proven winner like Bellinger could be the final piece they need to stay on top of the league.

Rookie RB RJ Harvey reaches contract agreement with Broncos

More NFL Coverage

Denver Broncos running back R.J. Harvey is making waves in his rookie NFL season, proving that dedication and family support can take an athlete far. The Orlando-born player, who began playing football at just five years old, has emerged as one of the league’s most promising young stars. His relentless drive and versatility have quickly made him a fan favorite in Denver.This season, Harvey is on pace to total over 700 yards from scrimmage with double-digit touchdowns — an impressive feat for a rookie sharing the field with veteran J.K. Dobbins. So far, he’s rushed 46 times for 205 yards and two touchdowns, averaging 4.5 yards per carry. As a receiver, he’s been equally valuable, catching 23 passes for 166 yards and four scores, showing that he’s not just a one-dimensional back. Here's what you need to know about his family.R.J. Harvey was born on February 4, 2001, to Juliet and Robert Harvey in Orlando, Florida. His father, Robert Harvey Sr., played cornerback at Bethune-Cookman from 1987 to 1990. “My dad taught me how to play football. He coached me up until high school. I started playing quarterback when I was maybe 7 or 8 and all the way through high school and one year at Virginia,” Harvey shared in an interview with the UCF Knights website.Family is the heartbeat of Harvey’s success. His younger sister, Alaina, plays softball at Allen University in South Carolina, while his older sister excelled in track during high school. Despite limited public information about his mother, Juliet, Harvey often credits his family for his resilience and values. Their bond remains strong, with the Harveys frequently seen cheering together at games. “Watching a match with family. .. bring the whole city out and let the kids have a good time,” Harvey said, reflecting his deep-rooted connection to both his family and his community.Standing 5’9″ and weighing 205 lbs, Harvey’s journey hasn’t been without challenges. Before joining the Broncos, he was a dual-threat quarterback at Edgewater High School in Orlando, where he led his team to a 12-2 record and a state playoff appearance as a senior. His remarkable high school stats — 42 passing touchdowns, 1,815 passing yards, 1,350 rushing yards, and 22 rushing touchdowns — set him apart early on. Off the field, his 4.3 GPA reflected a disciplined mind to match his athletic skills.After redshirting at Virginia in 2019, Harvey made a bold move to UCF and switched to running back. Despite tearing his ACL in 2021, he returned stronger than ever. By 2024, he set a UCF record for career touchdowns (48) and ranked second all-time in rushing touchdowns (43). His 1,577 rushing yards and 22 touchdowns that season led the Big 12, earning him national recognition before the Broncos selected him in the 2025 NFL Draft.","R.J.

Stefon Diggs confirmed as father, custody case continues

More NFL coverage

For months, fans and media alike have been following the drama surrounding New England Patriots star Stefon Diggs . The wide receiver, who’s also famously dating Grammy-winning rapper Cardi B , has been at the center of a legal dispute with Instagram model Aileen Lopera over the paternity of her daughter. And now, the mystery is solved! Diggs has been officially confirmed as the father of baby Charliee Harper Diggs-Lopera.The news has sent waves through both NFL and celebrity circles, sparking conversation about how this revelation might impact Diggs’ personal life and public image. While the paternity question has been settled, the broader legal battle over custody and co-parenting remains unresolved, keeping fans and followers eager to see what happens next.Aileen Lopera’s attorney, Tamar Arminak, spoke to Page Six about the ruling and its implications. “The paternity has been confirmed. Mr. Diggs is the father of the child,” she said. “Now that the child's paternity has been established and Mr. Diggs has acknowledged his daughter, my client hopes they can work toward being great parents to their child.” Arminak also cautioned that the legal matter is not yet fully resolved.“The case has not yet been dismissed and will move forward if the parties are not able to resolve [their issue] themselves,” he added.The legal drama has been brewing since December 2024, when Lopera filed a paternity suit seeking full legal and physical custody of her daughter while limiting Diggs to visitation rights. She also requested financial compensation for pregnancy-related medical expenses and attorney fees. After Charliee’s birth in April, the case remained active through the summer. Diggs responded in July, requesting a DNA test to determine paternity. He admitted he was “not certain” whether he was the father at the time, and proposed joint custody and shared expenses if the results confirmed parentage.Adding another layer to the story, Diggs recently made headlines when Cardi B revealed in a September interview on CBS Mornings that she is expecting a child with him. “I'm having a baby with my boyfriend, Stefon Diggs,” Cardi said. “I'm excited. I'm happy. I feel like I'm in a good space. I feel very strong, I feel very powerful that I'm doing all this work, but I'm doing all this work while I'm creating a baby.”Now, with paternity legally established, both Diggs and Lopera must decide whether to settle privately or continue the court battle. Arminak’s statement hints at a willingness to cooperate but leaves the door open for legal action if necessary.",Stefon Diggs has been officially confirmed as the father of baby Charliee Harper Diggs-Lopera.

Nico Harrison is seen signing autographs for the first time since the Luka Doncic trade



Fans react to Nico Harrison’s autograph signing



Nico Harrison has endured a lot. Following the nerve-wrecking Luka Doncic trade, the Dallas Mavericks have been under constant scrutiny for letting their star player go to the Los Angeles Lakers. It appeared to wean off the heat among fans as the Mavericks General Manager, Nico Harrison, was seen in a recent video signing autographs. However, the very sight did not go well among online fans as they took the whole matter under microscopic examination again with different opinionated explanations.In one of the biggest trades in recent NBA history, the Los Angeles Lakers landed Luka Doncic from the Dallas Mavericks, sending Anthony Davis , Max Christie, and a 2029 first-round pick in return. The blockbuster deal, which also involved the Utah Jazz, stunned fans and insiders alike. Utah received Jalen Hood-Schifino and two 2025 second-round picks as part of the agreement. The news broke shortly after the Lakers’ win over the Knicks, leaving many—including LeBron James—caught off guard. Soon after the trade, fans demanded to “fire Nico” everywhere.Nico Harrison was the center of attention following the blockbuster Luka Doncic-Anthony Davis trade. There was a huge uproar against the shocking trade that no one saw coming.Within days, fans chanted “fire Nico” on the road, in games, and even threatened him with disturbing messages.Now, as the Mavericks got Cooper Flagg, most of the heat appeared to slow down. On top of that, Nico was seen signing autographs for fans, a rare sight for fans following the trade.The Luka Doncic trade came after weeks of quiet negotiations between Lakers GM Rob Pelinka and Mavericks GM Nico Harrison, with even Dallas coach Jason Kidd unaware until the final stages. Pelinka praised Doncic as “a one-of-a-kind, young global superstar” who could lead the Lakers into a new era. Doncic, who averaged 33.9 points last season and guided Dallas to the NBA Finals, brings elite playmaking and scoring to a Lakers roster eager to build beyond LeBron’s twilight years.For Dallas, the move centers on strengthening its defense and balancing its roster. Harrison described Davis as “one of the best two-way players in the league.” Still, fans in Dallas voiced frustration after losing a generational talent. Harrison admitted the move carries risk, but said the franchise believes in the long-term vision. “The easiest thing would’ve been to do nothing,” he said.The Dallas Mavericks fans were in shock as the video of Nico signing autographs appeared online.One fan shared a screenshot from the video showing a young fOKC Thunder fan who asked for Nico’s autograph.Another fan who goes by the name of @SnapCrapola wrote on X, “Dude will be so historically infamous his autograph might be worth something in the future.”“Those are Lakers fans in disguise,” @DeyLuvHuggy shared.“Thunder fan in there like thank you for saving us from Luka belt every year 😭😭,” @ayyrod_ wrote.@joshegbuna shared, “Can’t be real fans 😭😭😭.”While Nico is apparently getting his respect back from the courtside fans, the online Mavericks supporters are still far from showering praise for his tenure at the franchise.Also Read: Why was ex-Grizzlies defensive star Tony Allen arrested?

Sidney Crosby and Alex Ovechkin: NHL legends set for another iconic showdown tonight

Another classic chapter in hockey's most enduring rivalry is about to unfold, with the likes of Sidney Crosby and the Pittsburgh Penguins clashing with Alex Ovechkin and his Washington Capitals. The two legends will be on the same ice Thursday night, at 7:30 p.m. ET, right from Pittsburgh's PPG Paints Arena. Fans can have the exclusive opportunity to watch the action on ESPN+, or they can listen to the radio broadcast on SiriusXM channel 91. The clash holds out high drama, old-time feeling, and perhaps even a sighting among the last duels of one of the great Hall of Famers.Crosby and Ovechkin joined the NHL together in 2005, making instant faces of the franchises, and at the same time, the whole hockey world was watching them with their rivalry that defined a generation. While Crosby's magic is in his two-way play and his passing IQ, Ovechkin's power as a supreme goal-scorer is still unrivaled, and he is also pursuing the all-time goals record of Wayne Gretzky. The two players are veterans who might be close to the end of their careers, but their fire still blazes hot. Crosby is still on track to score almost 100 points this season, while Ovechkin, surprisingly, finished the previous season with 44 goals, thus proving all doubters wrong.The Penguins' expectations for this match are set at getting over the slump of their recent loss to Toronto, which was a downfall as the starting goalie, Tristan Jarry, had to leave with a lower-body problem. The already veteran goalie has been ruled out for a few weeks, and thus, Sergei Murashov has to take up the position of the main goalie and do more work behind the net. Meanwhile, the Capitals are getting back the players they cannot do without, starting with Rasmus Sandin, who is making a comeback to the blue line after being sidelined because of an upper-body issue.Pairing struggle for pivotal points in the standings, the real story of the night is actually the Simone rivalry between Crosby and Ovechkin - two legends who will always be recalled together in the history of hockey. So, get ready for this historic face-off to take place at 7:30 p.m. ET on ESPN+ with the puck drop!More coverage on NHL","Sidney Crosby and Alex Ovechkin set for another iconic showdown tonight.

What to Expect from Tonight's Los Angeles Clippers vs Phoenix Suns Game (November 6, 2025)

Theare gearing up for a high-stakes regular-season clash on November 6, 2025, at the PHX Arena in Phoenix, Arizona. Both Western Conference contenders are striving to find early-season rhythm, with the Clippers standing at 3-4 and the Suns at 3-5. The matchup carries significance for both teams looking to rise in the standings after inconsistent starts marked by injuries and lineup adjustments.With both sides hungry for a rebound, this game promises an intense battle marked by tactical adjustments and key absences. The Suns are eager to defend their home court, while the Los Angeles Clippers aim to overcome adversity despite missing several stars. Fans can expect a tightly contested duel where every possession will count.For the Phoenix Suns, the injury report highlights two notable names - Dillon Brooks and Jalen Green. Brooks remains sidelined due to a lingering core muscle strain, missing his sixth consecutive contest. His absence has been felt significantly, particularly in perimeter defense and scoring depth. On a more positive note, Jalen Green, yet to make his Suns debut following a major trade, has been upgraded to “probable.” The dynamic guard impressed in practice, taking part in full five-on-five drills without setbacks. If cleared, Green’s speed and offensive explosiveness could immediately elevate the Suns’ energy and scoring options.Devin Booker continues to be the centerpiece of Phoenix’s offense, expected to handle the bulk of the scoring load. Meanwhile, Dillon Brooks’ absence creates more opportunities for players like Grayson Allen and Mark Williams to make an impact.The Los Angeles Clippers face a tougher situation with a depleted roster. Superstars Kawhi Leonard and James Harden are both unavailable for this matchup. Leonard remains out with a right ankle sprain, his second straight missed game, while Harden will not play due to personal reasons after recently posting a team-high 25 points in a loss. In addition, Kobe Sanders (knee) and Jordan Miller (hamstring) are sidelined, further thinning the Clippers’ depth.Without Leonard’s two-way dominance - averaging 24.3 points, 5.7 rebounds, and 2.5 steals per game - and Harden’s veteran playmaking, the Clippers will rely on role players like Ivica Zubac and Bradley Beal, who remains available despite ongoing knee management concerns.Thursday’s matchup stands out as the only NBA game on the schedule, airing nationally on NBC and Peacock at 9:00 PM ET. Both teams are coming off losses - Phoenix against the Warriors and Los Angeles against the Thunder - making this a crucial bounce-back opportunity.Oddsmakers slightly favor the Phoenix Suns with a -142 moneyline and a -2.5 spread. The projected total sits around 225.5, suggesting a moderately paced game. The Los Angeles Clippers won their previous meeting 129-102, but with Leonard and Harden absent, Phoenix has a strong chance to even the season series - especially if Jalen Green suits up for his debut.Fans should keep an eye on Booker’s offensive command and Zubac’s inside presence, both vital to their teams’ outcomes. The Phoenix Suns’ home advantage, paired with the potential spark from Green, gives them a slight upper hand.In a season defined by unpredictability, the Los Angeles Clippers vs. Suns game encapsulates the intensity of NBA competition - where depth, health, and adaptability often dictate success. Expect a fierce, fast-paced contest as both teams fight to regain momentum and climb the Western Conference standings.","The Los Angeles Clippers host the Phoenix Suns on November 6, 2025, at the PHX Arena in Phoenix, Arizona.

Are Buffalo Sabres planning to trade Alex Georgiev amid goalie logjam?

The Buffalo Sabres are currently dealing with a potentially problematic goalie logjam throughout the upper levels of the organization, which may force general manager Kevyn Adams to make an early trade. Therefore, reports are suggesting, according to hockey insider Elliotte Friedman, the Buffalo Sabres are actively exploring options to trade veteran goaltender Alexandar Georgiev.As of Georgiev’s performance, he has emerged as a promising goaltender in the league. Earlier, Georgiev was traded to the San Jose Sharks by the Colorado Avalanche on December 9, 2024, three seasons after he was acquired from the New York Rangers. However, after some years, he signed a one-year, $825,000 contract with the Buffalo Sabres on September 11, 2025, after playing for the Avalanche and San Jose Sharks. The Buffalo Sabres are reportedly shopping veteran goaltender Alexandar Georgiev , as revealed by NHL insider Elliotte Friedman. According to Friedman, the Sabres have initiated discussions with other teams, signaling their intent to move the former All-Star amid a crowded goaltending situation.He stated, “The Sabres have made it clear Colten Ellis is staying. Someone asked me if Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen could be moved, but I'd be surprised. He's still their most-experienced and best option, assuming he is healthy.""Later, he added, “They are trying to find a new home for Alexandar Georgiev.” Friedman reported that Buffalo’s front office has been active in exploring potential trade scenarios.Meanwhile, Alex Lyon, who's seized the Sabres' No. 1 goalie job with a terrific start to the 2025-26 season, and prized prospect Devon Levi are the other goaltenders in the picture for Buffalo.Georgiev, 29, actually joined the Sabres as a short-term stabilizer, but his inconsistent play and his recent performances have been uneven this season. Once regarded as one of the NHL’s most reliable backups, his save percentage has dipped below .900 this season. That decline, coupled with Buffalo’s defensive inconsistencies, has hurt his market value.Although General Manager Kevyn Adams has not publicly commented on the situation, insiders suggest that trade talks could progress quickly, especially as the NHL season nears the midpoint and teams reassess their rosters ahead of the trade deadline.","The Buffalo Sabres are reportedly shopping veteran goaltender Alexandar Georgiev.

Former NBC analyst Drew Brees makes a bold move to FOX in the wake of Mark Sanchez’s sensational arrest after a chaotic late-night brawl in Indianapolis

Drew Brees’ NFL background:

More coverage on NFL News:

On November 6, Andrew Marchand of The Athletic reported that Drew Brees is returning to the broadcast booth on a full-time basis as a FOX NFL game analyst. Sources told the outlet that Mark Sanchez’s chapter may have come to an end at the network. Brees, 46, will begin his broadcasting career at the channel in Week 11. While the details of his contract remain under wraps, the multi-year nature of the contract hints that Brees is stepping in as Sanchez’s long-term successor. He will work as an analyst for the rest of the year and call games through next season. He will join play-by-play announcer Adam Amin, taking over the analyst seat once filled by Sanchez, who has not returned since his arrest in Indianapolis.Former NBC analyst Drew Brees has worn several broadcasting hats. He joined ESPN at the start of this year as a contributor on “First Take.” It is not confirmed if Brees will leave “First Take” for FOX. He worked for NBC in 2021, where he was considered a potential successor to Cris Collinsworth on “Sunday Night Football.” He also called some Notre Dame games and selected NFL games. However, not every broadcast was a touchdown.His booth appearance for the Cincinnati Bengals’ game against the Las Vegas Raiders drew sharp criticism from NFL fans. The consensus was that Brees’ analysis lacked flavor and missed key moments, leaving viewers wanting more insight and energy.Back in January 2022, Andy Nesbitt of USA TODAY reported, “Brees was so bad throughout the game that he had fans actually wishing that Jason Witten was back calling games. That is not good. That is not good at all. The biggest problem with Brees was that he was beyond vanilla and offered very little to the broadcast. He didn’t seem to wait to be critical of any of the players, refs, or anything that an analyst should be critical of. He was particularly bad when an inadvertent whistle was heard during a play that led to a touchdown for the Bengals. Brees didn’t bring that up until well after the fact. It was a big moment and should have been talked about more.”Stepping into the spotlight, the 13-time Pro Bowler is set to replace Mark Sanchez, whose recent arrest in Indianapolis has shaken the sports world. The trouble began on October 4, when Sanchez clashed with 69-year-old truck driver Perry Tole over a parking spot outside a hotel. According to police, Sanchez seemed intoxicated and entered Tole’s vehicle uninvited. The confrontation escalated quickly: Tole defended himself first with pepper spray, then with a knife as Sanchez grew more aggressive. The aftermath left both men wounded—Sanchez with a stab wound to his upper torso, Tole with a deep cut to his face. After being hospitalized, Sanchez faced felony and battery charges. Tole responded with a lawsuit against both Sanchez and FOX Corporation, citing assault and negligence. FOX Sports has remained silent about Sanchez’s broadcasting future, but on November 6, The Athletic’s Andrew Marchand revealed that Drew Brees would step in as his replacement.He was selected by the San Diego Chargers in the 2001 NFL Draft as their second round, 32nd overall pick. He played five seasons for them and then 15 seasons for the New Orleans Saints. He is a Super Bowl XLIV champion and MVP, two-time NFL Offensive Player of the Year, NFL Comeback Player of the Year, and Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year. He has one First-team All-Pro selection, four Second-team All-Pro selections, 13 Pro Bowl selections, seven NFL passing yards leader titles, six NFL completion percentage leader titles, four NFL passing touchdowns leader titles, and two NFL passer rating leader titles. He has also received the New Orleans Saints Hall of Fame Award, the Art Rooney Award, the Bart Starr Award, the Bert Bell Award, the George Halas Award, and the Maxwell Award. As a quarterback, Brees amassed 10,551 passing attempts, 7,142 completions, a 67.7% completion percentage, 571 touchdowns, 243 interceptions, 80,358 passing yards, a 98.7 passer rating, 752 rushing yards, and 25 rushing touchdowns.","Drew Brees is returning to the broadcast booth on a full-time basis as a FOX NFL game analyst.

When you go through infertility , you feel like you’re alone–and you’re not

More coverage on the NFL couple:

Jakob and Mikayla, recipients of in vitro fertilization from the Brilora Fertility Foundation, recently welcomed a baby boy. They chose to honor Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford and his wife, Kelly, by naming their son Stafford Torrey. The signal-caller and his better half also faced fertility challenges, but IVF helped them conceive their twin daughters, Sawyer and Chandler, in 2016. The twins were born on March 31, 2017.On Wednesday, the Foundation tagged the NFL WAG and captioned it— “He’s here! Jakob and Mikayla, Brilora Stafford Grant recipients, have welcomed their beautiful baby boy, and our hearts are overflowing with joy. This little one is a reminder of what’s possible when hope meets compassion, and when community comes together to make miracles happen. Welcome to the world, Baby Stafford, your story is already shining bright. In partnership with Stafford Family and the (@ivfmichigan @pinnaclefertility) IVF Michigan & Ohio Fertility Centers/Pinnacle Fertility.”Seven years ago, Kelly Stafford, the voice behind “The Morning After” podcast, shared a heartfelt hospital photo on Instagram, titled “2 YEARS AGO.” Her caption read, “2 years ago today, Matthew and I’s journey to parenthood began. We are so beyond grateful for the science behind IVF and what it has brought to our lives.For anyone going through this, remember you aren’t alone and keep faith!! #ivf #ivftwins.”After welcoming their next two daughters, Hunter and Tyler, naturally, Kelly became a passionate advocate for fertility awareness. At a California event, she spoke candidly about the isolation of infertility and the importance of community: “When you go through infertility, you feel like you’re alone—and you’re not.”Inspired by their own struggles, the NFL couple launched the Stafford IVF Grants, aiming to lift both the financial and emotional burdens for others on a similar path. The grant covers a fresh IVF cycle, including monitoring, ICSI if needed, anesthesia, cryopreservation, and up to $3,000 in medications. Kelly now leads as board chair for the Chosen Fertility Group, which works with the Staffords to distribute these grants.The program is available in Michigan, in partnership with the Michigan Center for Fertility & Women’s Health, and in California for clinics within a 40-mile radius of Los Angeles. She reflected that, even years after her own experience, the infertility community remains close to her heart, and there is still much work to be done to foster open, honest conversations. “Even though it’s been years since our own experience with infertility,” Kelly said. “It’s a community you belong to forever. We still have a long way to go in raising awareness and normalizing open conversations about infertility.”","The Brilora Fertility Foundation announced that Jakob and Mikayla Stafford have welcomed a baby boy, Stafford Torrey.

Cleveland Cavaliers fans have trash-talking kid to thank for Donovan Mitchell's latest masterclass

The Cleveland Cavaliers last faced the Philadelphia 76ers, who have been at the top of their game this season, until recently. With how these two teams have been performing in thai campaign, most thought that the game would go to the 76ers, who were at the top of the leaderboard fighting it out with the Chicago Bulls. The Cavaliers on the other hand started off on the wrong foot, but have slowly making a comeback. So much so that now they have surpassed the 76ers after the last, even though both teams are on a 5-3 record so far.And someone who has been on top of this transition is Cavaliers star Donovan Mitchell, who scored 46 points in his last game against the 76ers, in 35 minutes of playtime. He also scored 8 assists and 4 rebounds in this game, taking his team to a 132-121 winning scoreline. And while many had a lot of praise for the shooting guard, he had a very different motive for showing up with a masterclass for this game. All because a kid he played NBA 2K with, called him ""washed up. ""In his latest post-match press conference, Cleveland Cavaliers shooting guard Donovan Mitchell had a funny story to share with everyone. Apparently, his lackluster performances this season led to a kid - who he played NBA 2K with, trash talked him.The kid called him ""washed up"" and it didn't sit too well with the athlete. He shared the story with the press, saying, ""He just called me washed up... this game was for that kid. """"I wouldn't put the game I had based on [anything that happened] on the court. This kid pissed me off today. He just called me washed up. He called me a bunch of things. But I love it, you know what I mean? He said he ain't seen a highlight from me in a minute. … I had been playing 2K for like two hours and I told him, I was like, 'Just wait.'""Mitchell was decidedly smug about his performance and the win, and it was clear as day that he had proved the point he wanted to. ""That's what this was about."" He was ""pissed off"" with the comments from the kid, and knew he had to show up in this game, and show up he did. He proved why Spida is one of the best players in the league right now. And he did it!

Suns Look to Capitalize Amid Los Angeles Clippers’ Setback

Los Angeles Clippers Face a Tough Task Without Their Stars

Thewill be without their star forward,, for tonight’s highly anticipated matchup against the Phoenix Suns on November 6, 2025. Leonard’s absence is a major blow for the Clippers, who have already been struggling to maintain consistency early in the season. The team confirmed that Leonard remains sidelined with a right ankle sprain, marking his second consecutive missed game due to the same injury.This development arrives at a critical point in the Los Angeles Clippers’ campaign as they continue to search for rhythm in a competitive Western Conference. Kawhi Leonard, known for his two-way dominance and leadership, has been one of the key figures driving the Clippers’ offense and defense alike. His unavailability means the team must adjust its strategy to keep up with a surging Suns squad eager to take advantage of their depleted opponent.According to the official injury report, Kawhi Leonard has been listed as out for the November 6 contest, continuing his recovery from a right ankle sprain suffered earlier this week. This marks his second straight absence, and there is no confirmed timeline for his return.Prior to the injury, Leonard was putting up impressive numbers this season, solidifying his position as the Clippers’ most dependable scorer and perimeter defender.Adding to the Los Angeles Clippers’ woes, veteran guard James Harden will also miss the game due to personal reasons. His absence leaves a significant void in playmaking and offensive depth, forcing the Clippers to rely heavily on players like Paul George, Ivica Zubac, and Norman Powell to shoulder the scoring burden. The back-to-back absences of Kawhi Leonard and Harden present a considerable challenge for head coach Tyronn Lue, who must make key lineup adjustments to stay competitive.On the other side, the Phoenix Suns enter the matchup relatively healthier, although they have dealt with minor injury concerns of their own this season. The Suns, led by Devin Booker and Kevin Durant, are looking to capitalize on the weakened Clippers lineup and strengthen their position in the standings.

Marc Anthony supports Bad Bunny amid Super Bowl backlash





More NFL coverage

Marc Anthony is offering heartfelt guidance to his longtime friend Bad Bunny as the Puerto Rican superstar prepares for one of the biggest moments of his career — headlining the 2026 Apple Music Super Bowl LX Halftime Show. The salsa legend, who knows the weight of such a global stage, shared his wisdom during an interview with Rolling Stone, making sure his friend approaches the opportunity with both passion and responsibility.“I tell him to just to be responsible with the risk [and] with the responsibility that he’s taking on, because I’m sure for him, he sees this as a massive responsibility to represent not only his culture, but his music,” Anthony said. “He’s going to work that much harder to bring an amazing show and I’m looking forward to it.”Anthony’s advice carries the weight of experience. In 2002, he graced the Super Bowl stage himself, performing “America the Beautiful” alongside Mary J. Blige at Super Bowl XXXVI. Now, over two decades later, he’s set to return — not as a performer, but as Bad Bunny’s proud supporter. “I’ll definitely be there, and I’ll be the first one cheering him on,” he added.The two artists share a bond that stretches back nearly a decade. Their friendship has grown both on and off stage, with Anthony recently joining Bad Bunny during his Debí Tirar Más Fotos concert in Puerto Rico — a symbolic gesture of mentorship and unity within Latin music.However, not everyone has celebrated Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl announcement. The rapper’s outspoken views on immigration and politics have drawn backlash from conservative circles. A Change.org petition, with more than 100,000 signatures, even called for country legend George Strait to replace him. Former President Donald Trump and his advisor Corey Lewandowski also criticized the choice, with Lewandowski confirming that ICE agents will be present at the event.Still, the Grammy-winning artist stands unfazed, and Anthony has been vocal in defending his friend’s right to shine. “He’s not there because he’s lucky,” Anthony said firmly. “He’s there based on merit and everything that he’s accomplished. I mean, his numbers are just astronomical.”Anthony’s admiration goes beyond friendship. “I’m proud of what he’s been able to accomplish in terms of spreading his gospel and that type of music, and the level he’s taken it to,” he shared.As Bad Bunny put it himself, this moment is about something greater than fame: “It’s for those who came before me and ran countless yards so I could come in and score a touchdown… this is for my people, my culture, and our history.”On February 8, 2026, in Santa Clara, California, Bad Bunny will make history as the first Latino male to perform solo at the Super Bowl halftime show — carrying with him not only the hopes of millions but the wisdom of a mentor who believes in him completely.",Marc Anthony is offering advice to his friend Bad Bunny ahead of his Super Bowl halftime show.

Brittany Mahomes’ entire love-story history is getting dragged back up as fans dissect one red carpet moment

More coverage on NFL:

Being in the NFL inner circle is no longer just game days and VIP suites, it’s content consumption, nonstop fan theories, and dissected facial expressions frame by frame. Brittany Mahomes knows that better than almost anyone. Anyone who’s followed her marriage to Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes has watched the couple grow up in public, from teenage connection in Texas to NFL superstardom, but social media doesn’t care about their full arc.Instead, TikTok and X users zoom in on a few seconds of eye contact, a shift of posture, or a moment of distance and call it “evidence.” That’s how the latest round of divorce speculation began, off one clip that looked chilly, not affectionate.The couple attended the red carpet for ESPN’s 2025 docuseries “The Kingdom,” yet instead of celebrating the milestone, the internet became hyper-focused on how separate they appeared standing next to one another. They weren’t the PDA-heavy duo fans are used to and that silence between them was louder than any interview soundbite.Brittany has admitted publicly that she’s had to toughen up emotionally when other women shoot their shot at her husband.During a fan Q&A, she didn’t sugarcoat her frustration: “Lol it's actually really sad how disrespectful some women are...But they are a waist [sic] of my time & not going to disturb my peace.” She admitted she once struggled with it deeply, but now says, “But I did use to have a very hard time and get extremely annoyed. But I am now to a point where I could care less!”Here’s the reality, online rumor culture rewards worst-case scenarios. Brittany and Patrick have three children, a decade-long foundation, and a shared empire. A weird moment on a red carpet might simply be nerves, but social media would rather write fan fiction than believe in a calm marriage.Ultimately, unless Brittany or Patrick speak directly, internet detectives will keep projecting. In today’s celebrity climate, silence breeds theories and every quiet second becomes narrative fuel for strangers online.","Brittany and Patrick Mahomes are facing renewed divorce speculation fueled by social media's dissection of a single red carpet clip.

Miami’s long-term direction

What’s next for Herro and Miami

Theare once again at the center of trade discussions, and this time it involves one of their top stars., who is currently sidelined with a left ankle injury, has found himself in the middle of trade rumors that could see him moving to the Western Conference once he returns to action. Despite Miami’s balanced 4-4 start to the season, the team’s inconsistent performances have raised questions about their long-term direction and whether Herro still fits into their future plans.The 24-year-old guard, signed to a $130 million contract, has evolved from a reliable bench scorer to an All-Star-caliber player capable of running the offense. However, with Miami choosing not to extend his deal and drafting point guard Kasparas Jakučionis this past offseason, signs point toward potential changes ahead. According to Bleacher Report’s Dan Favale, Herro’s skill set and playmaking ability could make him a prime target for a Western Conference team like the Dallas Mavericks once he’s fully healthy.The Miami Heat are facing a challenging start to their 2025 NBA campaign, and trade rumors are already beginning to swirl. One of the team’s biggest storylines revolves around guard Tyler Herro, who has been sidelined due to a left ankle injury.Despite being out of action, Herro’s name has surfaced in potential trade discussions, particularly involving a move to the Western Conference once he’s healthy.The Miami Heat opened their season with a 4-4 record, a middling start that reflects both promise and inconsistency. While Miami’s offense has turned heads with its creativity and efficiency, it still lacks the firepower to challenge elite contenders in the East. With Herro’s $120 million contract on the books, the Heat might explore trade options before the market shifts and other teams recognize their potential as sellers.Tyler Herro’s journey with the Miami Heat has been nothing short of impressive. Starting his career as a bench player, he quickly established himself as one of the best scorers in his role and even earned the NBA Sixth Man of the Year award. Over the past few seasons, he has developed into an All-Star-caliber player and a key part of Miami’s offensive identity.According to Dan Favale of Bleacher Report, the Dallas Mavericks could be a logical destination for Tyler Herro once he recovers. “Herro has improved enough to run the show for long pockets of time. He has long been one of the more underrated from-scratch shot-makers, and he leveled up as facilitator amid a skeleton crew of orchestrators in Miami last year,” Favale said Thursday.He added that Herro’s defensive shortcomings wouldn’t be a major concern for the Mavericks, who could rely on their strong frontcourt to cover him. “Covering up for Herro defensively will be no sweat. Cooper Flagg, Anthony Davis and the Mavs’ overall size are equipped to handle it.” (H/t: Sporting News)While the Mavericks appear to be an ideal fit for Tyler Herro’s offensive skill set, matching salaries could be a major hurdle. A potential trade would likely require a third team to balance out financials.The Dallas Mavericks may be tempted to act quickly, especially as they look to protect the development of rookie sensation Cooper Flagg. Bringing in a polished scorer and playmaker like Tyler Herro could stabilize their backcourt rotation while Kyrie Irving recovers or manages minutes.The Miami Heat’s front office has already shown signs of preparing for change. They opted not to extend Herro’s contract further and used their 2025 draft pick to select Lithuanian point guard Kasparas Jakučionis, indicating a possible shift in philosophy.Herro’s return timeline from his ankle injury remains uncertain, but once he’s healthy, his trade market could heat up quickly. Miami’s decision will depend on whether they see him as a long-term cornerstone or as a valuable trade chip to retool around Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo.Also read: NBA trade rumors: Houston Rockets potentially eyeing $125.9 million Boston Celtics superstar to fill for Fred VanVleet As the season progresses, expect the Herro-to-Dallas rumors to gain traction - especially if the Miami Heat hover around .500 and the Mavericks look for another offensive boost out West.","Miami Heat guard Tyler Herro is currently sidelined with a left ankle injury. Herro's name has surfaced in potential trade discussions, particularly involving a move to the Western Conference once he’s healthy.

Nick Kyrgios and Aryna Sabalenka draw backlash for ‘ Battle of the Sexes ’ event

Nick Kyrgios and Aryna Sabalenka will face each other in a special “Battle of the Sexes” match on December 28, 2025, at the Coca-Cola Arena in Dubai, as reported by Reuters. The match is backed by their management company Evolve, which is led by tennis star Naomi Osaka.The event was planned for months, but many thought it would never happen. Now that it’s confirmed, it has sparked strong reactions across the tennis world. Many fans and players feel it turns an important part of tennis history into a show for attention.Critics say it makes fun of the original “Battle of the Sexes,” which once helped women’s tennis gain respect. Let’s look at how this idea began, why the original event mattered so much, and why this new version is being called a publicity stunt.The idea of men and women facing off in tennis is not new. The first “Battle of the Sexes” happened in 1973 when Bobby Riggs, then 55, played Margaret Court, who was 30 and returning after childbirth.Riggs said women’s tennis was not as strong as men’s and promised to win easily. On May 13, 1973, he did just that, beating Court 6-2, 6-1. The match was later called the “Mother’s Day Massacre.”Later that same year, Riggs challenged Billie Jean King, then the world’s top female player.On September 20, 1973, in front of more than 30,000 fans in Houston, King beat Riggs 6-4, 6-3, 6-3. According to History.com and Britannica, that match became a big moment for women’s rights and gender equality in sports.Now, fifty years later, Nick Kyrgios and Aryna Sabalenka are bringing that idea back, but the reaction has been mixed. Aryna Sabalenka, the world No. 1, will take on Kyrgios, who has been off the tour due to injuries and is currently ranked No. 652, as confirmed by The Guardian. Many say this match feels less like a competition and more like a show meant for clicks and sponsors.Aryna Sabalenka herself told People Magazine she hopes to “represent women’s sport in the best way,” but admitted the setup puts pressure on her because if she loses, “it could send the wrong message.”The event may attract huge attention, but many believe it risks turning an important chapter of tennis history into just another viral moment.Also Read: Serena Williams Brings Wimbledon Vibes To The Spanish Royal Event And Alexis Ohanian’s Sweet Reaction Wins Heart","Nick Kyrgios and Aryna Sabalenka will face each other in a special ‘Battle of the Sexes’ match on December 28, 2025, at the Coca-Cola Arena in Dubai.

According to the Frisco Police Department, Kneeland’s death was ruled an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, sending shockwaves through a league already familiar with the importance of mental health awareness.Among those deeply affected was Sarah Jane Ramos, the fiancée of Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott, who has long been an advocate for mental health following his own family tragedy. Ramos took to Instagram to express her sorrow, writing, “Devastating,” while reposting the Cowboys’ official statement. She added, “Please lift this family and community up with love and prayers. Rest in Peace, Marshawn.” Her words echoed the collective heartbreak felt across the Cowboys’ locker room and beyond.The Cowboys’ official statement read, “It is with extreme sadness that the Dallas Cowboys share that Marshawn Kneeland tragically passed away this morning.

Tyreek Hill is using the injury break to explore life outside football while keeping his future wide open

More coverage on NFL:

Tyreek Hill has been the NFL’s most explosive entertainer on the field for years, but 2025 might be the year fans discover whether he’s also capable of reinventing himself off it. The Miami Dolphins superstar is currently sidelined with a season-ending knee injury, and instead of sulking his way through rehab, Hill is redirecting his competitive personality into a completely different creative lane — DJing.For a player who reshaped offensive schemes just by existing in motion, pivoting into house music actually fits his energy more than people think. This isn’t a retirement press announcement, but it feels like a preview of what the post-football version of Tyreek Hill might eventually look like.The injury happened Sept. 29 against the Jets, when Tyreek Hill's knee bent unnaturally near the sideline. The torn ACL and related ligament damage ended his year instantly, but what’s interesting is how Hill has responded to the emotional swing. Instead of building hype about 2026 immediately, he’s been honest about reassessment.Miami radio host Andy Slater revealed the new lane when he said Hill casually told Luther Campbell about his DJ plans over dinner at Joe’s Stone Crab and Hill doubled down by retweeting it with: “Coming to play house music near you.”The five-time All-Pro still has one year left on his Dolphins deal, but he refuses to force the next chapter too early.“At the end of the day, I feel like that decision is based upon how I feel and where my mindset is at the moment,” he admitted on Terron Armstead’s podcast.Hill doesn’t sound like a player terrified of a non-football identity. He sounds like one trying, very deliberately, to evolve. And Mike McDaniel supports that approach, praising Hill for not rushing his life choices and not hiding from the recovery process.For now, the Dolphins lose his speed, but the world might gain a house-music wildcard. Hill’s story is shifting fast and if this DJ lane sticks, the NFL might eventually become the side chapter. His injury break feels less like downtime, and more like a pivot point.","Tyreek Hill is using the injury break to explore life outside football.

Jordan Binnington explains his side after Ovechkin puck incident



More NHL coverage:

St. Louis Blues goaltender Jordan Binnington found himself at the center of NHL buzz on Wednesday night—not for his saves, but for his stunt. After giving up the 900th goal of Alex Ovechkin’s remarkable career during Washington’s 6-1 win, Binnington casually skated away from the crease, plucked the puck from his net, and slid it into his goalie pants. The Capitals were celebrating Ovechkin’s milestone in the corner while cameras caught the Blues netminder seemingly pocketing hockey history. Moments later, linesman Michel Cormier intervened, and the puck was retrieved before play resumed. It eventually found its rightful owner, as Ovechkin posed proudly with the record-setting puck postgame.The moment sparked laughter and debate across the league. When asked about Binnington’s antics, Ovechkin smiled and said, “Yeah, I just saw it. I’m not going to comment,” before chuckling. Binnington, meanwhile, had already been pulled midway through the second period after surrendering four goals on 15 shots. The Capitals’ locker room, lighthearted in victory, couldn’t resist poking fun. “I don’t know, maybe he was trying to grab it to give it to him, but who knows?” said Washington goalie Logan Thompson. Former NHL goalie Martin Biron was more critical, saying, “It’s not that he wants to sell it on eBay, he just wants to put it in his basement, right? … It’s not been a great season for the Blues’ goaltending, and now you do that? I’m saying, ‘Where’s your head at?’”By Thursday morning, Binnington sought to clear the air, saying he meant no harm or theft.“Yeah, I figured I basically had an assist on the goal there, turning it over. Didn’t think he’d mind sharing it,” he told KMOV’s Jacob Cersosimo. “I had full intention to give it back to him.” He also praised Ovechkin’s brilliance, saying, “Incredible play by him to catch that on his forehand, spin around, and get that on net from a bad angle… He’s next level. He just continues to impress.”It wasn’t the first time Binnington stirred headlines for his fiery antics. From water-bottle tosses to crease confrontations, controversy seems to trail him. Yet, this episode—part comic, part chaotic—added another bizarre chapter to his career. And while Ovechkin etched his name deeper into hockey history, Binnington ensured he’d be remembered for turning a milestone moment into one of the season’s strangest highlights.",St. Louis Blues goalie Jordan Binnington stole Alex Ovechkin's 900th goal during Wednesday night's game.

Fans celebrate the great 8: Social media explodes after goal no. 900



Sporting events' magnificence, amongst which, to the undeniable advantage, stood Ovechkin's 900th goal. The Washington Capitals’ captain sat on top of the world once again—this time doing it against the St. Louis Blues on Nov. 5—and thus piercing through a record that no NHL player had ever attained. Since he got into the league in 2005, Ovechkin has been nothing less than a human highlight reel pursuing Wayne Gretzky's impressive record with what seems to be infinite determination. The moment he became the first player to score 900 goals, his name was not only in the record books but also in the history of the sport forever.Ovechkin, at age 40, relived all the days and numbers he shot, the power behind his shot that is still like that thunder crack heard in every place where he performs. His goal meant the flood of fans to X (Twitter) in mere seconds; they turned their timelines into digital fireworks celebrating one of the most iconic careers in hockey. It didn't matter if they were fans of the Penguins, giving a respectful nod, or supporters of the Capitals crying happy tears—everybody on that night would be united, as across the NHL it would be rare to see such harmony—the Great 8 received the applause of all.“Goes without saying but greatest goal scorer in,” enthused Adamo Marinelli, whereas along the same lines, another user, Terri, said, “Best regular season goal scorer in history. Still needs 40 to reach 1017 and say he has scored the most NHL goals in history. He is on a 19 goal pace this season. Tough call if he will make it even with next season but I hope he tries.” Even the fans of rival teams could not prevent the flow of admiration, “UNBELIEVABLE CAREER WELL DESERVED! From a Penguins fan incredible player!!” was the comment from @Baseball4Ever99.A few of the reactions were just perfect for the occasion. “Ovechkin’s legend grows stronger ,” commented @Corners, and @CorvoAttano_14 concluded it very briefly: “Generational. We may never see a goal scorer as good as Ovi in our lifetime.”There were even some fans who looked into the future — “Can’t wait to see the car that Gretzky promised Ovi,” was the comment coming from @marknliu, while the atmosphere was deeply nostalgic. Noticing the situation, @AgentJoe11, a longtime fan, said it very well: “Every goal Ovi scores will be the most ever until he retires. I saw his 1st game and hundreds since. No one will ever break Ovi's record. Last season, while en route to breaking 99's record, he broke his leg and missed 16 games and still came in 3rd in the NHL for goals at 39. ”Ovechkin didn't solely score a goal—he made history immortal. The Great 8 is now the only one at 900, and the hockey world can do nothing but admire and wonder what will follow.More coverage on NHL","Alex Ovechkin became the first player to score 900 goals in the NHL on Nov. 5.

Jannik Sinner praises Italy’s diversity and calls for unity

Jannik Sinner, the World No. 1 tennis player, has finally shared how he really feels about being Italian. Many people in Italy have questioned his national identity for years, especially after he pulled out of the 2025 Davis Cup Finals. Sinner, who helped Italy win back-to-back Davis Cup titles in 2023 and 2024, decided to skip this year’s event to prepare early for the 2026 Australian Open. His choice started a wave of negative talk in Italy, with some questioning if he truly feels connected to his country.Jannik Sinner, 24, was born in the South Tyrol region in northern Italy, near Austria. The people in that area mostly speak German, and Sinner himself grew up speaking it as his first language. His red hair and accent often make him stand out from players born in southern Italy. Because of this, Italian media has sometimes questioned how “Italian” he really is.In a recent chat with Sky Sports, Sinner was asked if he would be seen differently if he had been born in southern Italy. The four-time Grand Slam winner smiled and said he didn’t know how to answer that but made one thing clear, he is proud to be Italian.“This is a question to which I don’t know how to respond,” Sinner said.“It’s like saying since today it’s sunny, it won’t rain. But I’m proud to be Italian. I’m very happy to be born in Italy and not in Austria or anywhere else. Because like I always said, this country deserves much more than what I’m doing. We have good coaches, players, and so many different mentalities, and that’s our strength.”During the Sky Sports interview, Jannik Sinner also spoke about how Italy’s diversity makes it special.

NHL Trade Rumors: Nazem Kadri linked to Montreal Canadiens as Pittsburgh Penguins silence the noise,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-rumors-nazem-kadri-linked-to-montreal-canadiens-as-pittsburgh-penguins-silence-the-noise/articleshow/125142196.cms,"Nazem Kadri (Image Via Twitter)

Could the Montreal Canadiens or Carolina Hurricanes make a move for Nazem Kadri?

Nazem Kadri: 1,000 Games In The NHL

The Pittsburgh Penguins have surprised everyone by their strong performance at the start of the 2025 season, and thus, the early rumors of trades of their veteran players have been put to rest. With Crosby and Malkin at the front, the team’s good start has made the speculation of a rebuild die down. TSN’s Pierre LeBrun has stated that the general manager, Kyle Dubas, wants to keep the team competitive and also wants to build its future. This strategy, for the time being, has made the conversations about moving Crosby or Malkin before the trade deadline stop.While the Penguins have a peaceful moment, the Calgary Flames are on the opposite side. The veteran center, Nazem Kadri, was rumored to be traded even after he just recently celebrated his 1,000th NHL game with a goal in Calgary’s 6-1 victory over Columbus. Though Kadri is still producing at the age of 35, the fact that he is not that far from retirement and the $7 million annual salary cap hit through 2028-29 have all together raised a question about his trade value.Kadri has reportedly been associated with various teams, like the Montreal Canadiens, who are in search of a dependable second-line center. But Montreal Gazette columnist Jack Todd ridiculed the thought and said that Kadri’s contract and his past conduct of being hot-headed, and at times undisciplined, made him an unlikely fit. At the same time, Nick Kypreos hinted that the Carolina Hurricanes could be a more plausible buyer because they have been trying to get an elite forward since last season.Kypreos also disclosed that Carolina is on Kadri’s no-trade list; however, if the Hurricanes were to make a strong push, Calgary GM Craig Conroy could ask for permission to speak directly with Kadri’s agent. A very attractive offer might be the reason for Kadri to lift the trade clause for the possibility of playing another postseason with a contender.The NHL trade season's unpredictability, which is marked by a blend of calm assurance and increasing stress, is reflected in the contrasting scenarios of the two teams, where Pittsburgh has acquired some stability, and Kadri's fate is still unclear.More coverage on NHL","Nazem Kadri recently celebrated his 1,000th NHL game with a goal in Calgary’s 6-1 victory over Columbus.
