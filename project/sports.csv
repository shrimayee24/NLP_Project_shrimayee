Will the Miami Heat chase short-term success or sign Butler for a prolonged future?



The February trade deadline is closing in, forcing the Heat management to make up their mind



According to recent reports from ESPN’s Shams Charania , the. The franchise mentioned that they are “open to listening to offers” and that they will only accept a trade offer if the terms sit well with them. Jimmy Butler seemed pretty set in the Miami Heat and it is not known why the team is willing to let him go. This could either make his future better or negatively affect Butler’s performance in the NBA.You might be wondering about Jimmy’s favorite teams and where he would want to get offers to shift to. According to Butler’s agent, the six-time All-Star would like to move to teams like the Houston Rockets, the Dallas Mavericks, or the Golden State Warriors. All of the aforementioned teams have been performing well in the current season and if Jimmy gets traded to either of these franchises, we can see him fit right in. However, chemistry comes into play and we feel that a player of Butler’s caliber will not take too long to gel with the rest of the team.The Heat and Butler are at a crucial zone in their partnership. Butler is anticipated to decline his player option for the 2025–2026 season, making him a free agent, according to a June Charania article . Miami must therefore decide whether to deal with Butler now or risk losing him to free agency.The possibility of losing Butler and not getting paid could force the team to make a big change. The Heat face a serious challenge as a result of this possible turning point after five straight postseason appearances. Given his age and the present collective bargaining agreement, signing the 35-year-old Butler to a maximum contract also has dangers.The Heat showed that they are still committed to aiming for immediate postseason success by declining to deal with Jimmy Butler during the offseason. Miami might change their strategy, though, if they feel like their time for a championship is shrinking.Some hints can be found in the Heat's performance this season. With a 12-10 record and a fifth-place finish in the Eastern Conference, they have been erratic and currently rank 12th in net rating (+2.7). A three-game winning streak, which includes a resounding 41-point thumping of the Los Angeles Lakers and a 122-113 triumph over the scorching Cleveland Cavaliers, has restored hope despite these setbacks.Also read: Top 30 most valuable NBA teams of 2024 Miami's front management is taking its time making a decision, as there are still over two months before the February 6 trade deadline.

The Surprising Win Of The Cincinnati Bengals Against The Dallas Cowboys



Is it crazy to think playoffs if the Cowboys beat the Bengals?

A Stressful Future For The Cincinnati Bengals



Cincinnati Bengals had a tough season and almost ran out of hopes of making it to the AFC North playoffs until their win over the Dallas Cowboys 27-20 on the Monday Night Match. This has renewed hopes of the Cincinnati Bengals’ team and its fans but its not an easy journey for them till the playoffs. At this point in the game, the Cincinnati Bengals team might just have to win every upcoming match they play to keep the hope of entering into the playoff alive.The 2024 season of the National Football League has not been a great one for the Cincinnati Bengals. Till before they won the Week 14 match against the Dallas Cowboys on Monday night, the Cincinnati Bengals had an embarrassing score of 4-8 which quite literally seemed like their season was over for the 2024 season of the National Football League. But as fate would have it, things suddenly changed for the better for the Cincinnati Bengals when they won after defeating a team of similar strength and performance this year, the Dallas Cowboys.But it is not like that this win has made things easier for the Cincinnati Bengals. Currently, the Cincinnati Bengals are still behind the Indianapolis Colts, and Miami Dolphins, each holding 6-7 scores. The teams that are currently holding the wild card spots for the AFC North Playoffs are the Denver Broncos 8-5, the Los Angeles Chargers 8-5 and the Baltimore Ravens 8-5. Now this has become the situation that the Cincinnati Bengals have to deal with, at least one of the teams have to lose any of their upcoming matches for the Cincinnati Bengals to have a chance of making it to the AFC North playoffs by at least securing a wild card spot for itself.However, truth be told, there are higher chances of the Cincinnati Bengals to make it to the AFC North playoffs. The upcoming matches they play are with the Tennessee Titans and the Cleveland Browns and both of them had a poor run this season. One may assume that the Cincinnati Bengals might just win the matches against them. But the problem does not end here - their upcoming matches also includes a match with the Denver Broncos and the Pitsburgh Steelers, two of the strongest teams. If Cincinnati Bengals loses these matches, they can bid goodbye to the dream of making it to the AFC North Playoffs.Also Read: College football star Travis Hunter mocks NFL stars Travis Kelce and Patrick Mahomes for security lapses in bold podcast statement Things are looking very difficult for the Cincinnati Bengals but things actually looked worse before their win against the Dallas Cowboys on Week 14 at the Monday Night Match.

IND vs AUS: Rohit Sharma has had a terrible time with the bat in whites

NEW DELHI: The debate over Captain Rohit Sharma 's batting position for the third Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series against Australia in Brisbane has sparked discussions on social media. After missing the Perth Test due to his second child's birth, Rohit opted to bat at No. 6 in Adelaide, allowing KL Rahul to continue opening.However, this strategy proved unsuccessful as Rohit managed only nine runs across both innings in India's 10-wicket defeat.A notable discussion emerged between cricket legends Sunil Gavaskar and Matthew Hayden regarding Rohit and KL Rahul's batting positions for the upcoming Brisbane Test, scheduled for Saturday, with an amusing incident involving Hayden's on-air mistake.In his analysis on Star Sports post-second Test, Gavaskar advocated for Rohit's return to opening, suggesting it could provide India with a strong start. He proposed moving Rahul to No. 6, entrusting him with handling the second new ball.""I think he should come back to opening for the next Test because he likes the ball to come onto the bat. This innings, one can understand, because he hadn't played for a while, and Rahul and Jaiswal had a 200-run partnership in the previous game. But Rahul can come down the order and face the second new ball. I'm being optimistic that India will bat so well in the next game that Rahul will take care of the second new ball,"" he said.Hayden presented a contrasting view, advising against hasty changes despite the Adelaide defeat, supporting the ""technically-sound"" Rahul as opener.However, he mistakenly said "" Rahul Dravid "" instead of ""KL Rahul.""He stated: ""I'll be slightly more stubborn. I will not be changing at this stage. I know you would like a better outcome inside the top three. But from what I saw in Perth, technically, Rahul Dravid is right there. He just needs to do it for a longer.""Gavaskar humorously pointed out the error: ""I would love it if it was Rahul Dravid, as you said, but it is KL Rahul.""Hayden, amidst laughter, apologised and explained that Dravid's Adelaide Oval double century still haunts him.""Sorry, KL Rahul. My apologies. I was thinking of when he dominated here in Adelaide and got us smashed in 2003/04 series. That's a nightmare I'm stull living.""Dravid’s marathon 233 during India’s 2003/04 tour of Australia was a masterclass in grit. Chasing Australia’s 556, powered by Ricky Ponting’s 242, Dravid found stellar support from VVS Laxman.The pair’s record 303-run stand fueled India’s 523-run reply.Dravid’s 446-ball knock featured 23 fours and a six. He followed it with an unbeaten 72 as India chased 230, sealing their first win in Australia since 1981 and only their fourth ever Down Under.","Rohit Sharma will bat at No. 6 in the third Test against Australia in Brisbane.

NEW DELHI: Star pacer Shaheen Afridi carved his name into cricketing history by becoming the first Pakistan bowler to achieve the milestone of 100 wickets in each format of international cricket.The historic feat came during the opening T20I against South Africa in Durban on Tuesday. Shaheen delivered a standout performance, striking once in the powerplay, once in the middle overs, and once at the death to complete a three-wicket haul and reach this rare milestone.With his impressive 3/22 spell, the 24-year-old left-arm pacer notched up his 100th T20I wicket, adding to his 112 scalps in ODIs and 116 in Test cricket. Shaheen also became the third Pakistani bowler to claim 100 T20I wickets, joining Haris Rauf and Shadab Khan.Notably, Shaheen achieved this landmark in his 74th T20I, making him the second-fastest Pakistani to the milestone after Haris Rauf, who accomplished it in 71 matches.At the same time, Shaheen became the youngest bowler in the world to achieve 100 wickets across all formats, joining the elite club of New Zealand's Tim Southee, Bangladesh's Shakib Al Hasan, and Sri Lanka's Lasith Malinga.During the match, Shaheen displayed his brilliance by cleaning up Rassie van der Dussen for a golden duck with a searing yorker. He later dismissed the dangerous David Miller before he could reach a well-deserved century and trapped Nqabayomzi Peter in front of the stumps to secure his 100th T20I wicket.Despite Shaheen’s record-breaking performance, Pakistan fell short in their chase of a challenging 184-run target, losing by 11 runs.

India's over dependence on Jasprit Bumrah visible in Adelaide

How can India still qualify for World Test Championship final?

SHAMI STRUGGLING WITH KNEE SWELLING

BOWLING UNIT MUST STAND UP TO SUPPORT BUMRAH

Is India's batting now over dependent on Yashasvi Jaiswal?

MEDICAL TEAM MONITORING SHAMI

MUKESH KUMAR: A POSSIBLE OPTION

NEW DELHI: After a comprehensive win in the series opener vs Australia in Perth, the Indian cricket team was riding high on confidence. Jasprit Bumrah was at his magical best, Mohammed Siraj seemed to have rediscovered his mojo and Harshit Rana made an instant impact on his Test debut.The mood, however, drastically changed as the colour of the ball went from red to pink for the next Test in Adelaide. India stuck to the same bowling combination for the 2nd Test and they failed to click as a unit. Bumrah seemed overworked and Australia's gameplan of seeing him off cautiously worked!What India clearly lacked in that Adelaide fixture was an able support cast with Bumrah, and it wasn't a surprise that Mohammed Shami started dominating social media trends. Representing his state Bengal in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, Shami was some thousand miles away from action and was proving his fitness under the watchful eyes of the National Cricket Academy specialists.It wasn't a surprise when Rohit was asked about Shami's availability after the Adelaide Test and the skipper reiterated that the door remained open for the experienced pacer. However, he emphasised that the team was being cautious about Shami’s fitness.""We are just monitoring him because while playing Syed Mushtaq Ali, he got some swelling in his knee, which hampers his preparation to come and play a Test match. We want to be very careful, we don't want to bring him here, he pulls up sore or something happens. We want to be more than 100% sure with him because it has been a long time,"" Rohit said.Shami has not played for India since the 2023 ODI World Cup final against Australia, sidelined by an achilles injury that required surgery earlier this year. After enduring setbacks during his recovery, he returned to competitive cricket for Bengal in the Ranji Trophy, where he picked up seven wickets against Madhya Pradesh in Indore.Following this, Shami has played all group stage games for Bengal in the SMAT and also featured in the knockout fixture vs Chandigarh last evening. While there were hopes Shami would join the squad during the series, his knee swelling has delayed his return. On Sunday, Rohit confirmed that bringing Shami to Australia on short notice would be a poor decision.Before departing for the tour, Rohit had already hinted at Shami’s absence, describing him as ""undercooked"" and unfit for the rigours of a high-stakes series.The team faced another blow when Jasprit Bumrah suffered an injury scare during the second day of the Adelaide Test, adding to the pressure on the bowling attack.In Shami’s absence, Bumrah bore the responsibility of leading the pace department. He was supported by Mohammed Siraj and an experienced pair of Harshit Rana and Nitish Kumar Reddy.In the Perth Test, Bumrah’s brilliance was complemented by Siraj’s consistency and Rana’s impressive debut performance. Rana, thriving in Australian conditions, picked up three crucial wickets in the first innings and another in the second, showcasing his ability to bowl decisive deliveries.Rana’s confidence was already evident before the Adelaide Test too, thanks to his four-wicket haul during the warm-up match in Canberra. However, Rana struggled in Adelaide, conceding 86 runs in 16 overs at an economy rate of 5.37 and going wicketless.Despite this, he received support from Rohit.""Rana didn't do anything wrong in the first Test. He bowled well, got crucial breakthroughs, and I believe that players shouldn't be let go if they haven't done anything wrong... If it happens, how will other members of the team feel secure?,"" Rohit said in support of Rana.As India gear up for the Brisbane Test, starting on December 14, all eyes will be on Bumrah’s fitness and how Rohit manages the bowling attack in this crucial match.Shami’s fitness is now under the close watch of BCCI’s medical staff.According to a Cricbuzz report, SS Das from the selection committee and a team from the NCA, led by Nitin Patel, are assessing whether Shami can endure the demands of Test cricket.If declared fully fit, Shami’s return would be a significant boost for India’s campaign.Mukesh Kumar, often compared to Shami, is one of the traveling reserves with the team. With prior experience in overseas conditions, including South Africa and the West Indies, he could play a key role if needed.Mukesh, who was part of the squad for the World Test Championship Final and the ODI series against South Africa last year, has consistently delivered in domestic and A-team matches.He made his Test debut in 2023 against the West Indies, taking seven wickets across three matches.If Bumrah is unavailable or further issues arise, Rohit may look to Mukesh as a viable option during the series.",India's over dependence on Jasprit Bumrah visible in Adelaide. Mohammed Shami was some thousand miles away from action and was proving his fitness under the watchful eyes of the National Cricket Academy specialists. Shami has not played for India since the 2023 ODI World Cup final against Australia.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116163268,imgsize-34768,width-400,resizemode-4/116163268.jpg"

Former Australia batter and captain Ricky Ponting offered his perspective on the recent incident between Travis Head and Mohammed Siraj during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy Test match in Adelaide. He believes it stemmed from a misunderstanding.The incident occurred in the 82nd over of Australia's first innings. Siraj bowled Head out with a yorker after the Australian batsman had scored 140 runs, including a six off Siraj on the previous delivery.After Head's dismissal, there was an exchange of words between the two players. This prompted a reaction from Head before he left the field to applause from the Adelaide crowd. Siraj then received boos from the home crowd, who were supporting their local player.Later, Head clarified in a press conference that Siraj was responding to his ""well bowled"" comment. Both players received one demerit point for violating the ICC Code of Conduct . Siraj also received a 20% match fee penalty.Ponting discussed the incident on The ICC Review. He offered a balanced viewpoint on the events.“Looking back at it now, I think it was accidental the way that whole thing played out,” Ponting said. “I don't think there was any malice meant at the start.”Ponting felt the initial“Then the way it started and almost like the misinterpretation of what had actually gone on, I think led to how it ended.”While Siraj's reaction was immediate and intense, Ponting felt it was a natural response from a fast bowler under pressure, having taken only one wicket at that point and being hit for a six.“I know Travis has gone and said that he said ‘well bowled’ at the start,” Ponting said. “Siraj obviously wasn't happy about being hit over the deep backward square for six the ball before.”Ponting believed that Indian captain Rohit Sharma would expect such reactions from his fast bowlers in high-pressure situations.“Rohit (Sharma) I'm sure would expect these fast bowlers to react like that. When they're under the pressure and they're getting hit and then they've just got a wicket you'd expect that they'd be up and about.”Despite the intensity of the exchange, Ponting downplayed the seriousness of the incident.“Look, it wasn't that big a deal,” he said.He did, however, express concern for Siraj due to the bowler's send-off towards the Australian dressing room, something umpires generally disapprove of.“I was in comms (commentary box) at the time. As soon as I saw the send-off, I actually got worried for Siraj. I know how the umpires react to those things. Umpires and referees don't like seeing the send-off, pointed in the direction of the dressing room.”Siraj and Head resolved their differences quickly. They were observed having a chat when Siraj came out to bat, and they also embraced during the post-match handshakes.“It was great to see them actually chatting. When Siraj came out to bat and Travis was at short leg, they were actually clarifying what had happened out there,” said Ponting.“They were talking amongst themselves as to what had actually happened. Both players have now had their say on what they thought happened.""The third Test of the series will get underway on December 14 in Brisbane.

How can India still qualify for World Test Championship final?

Quarterfinals line-up:

BENGALURU: The presence of star players has added sheen to the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy this season. More importantly, they have lit up the domestic T20 competition with individual brilliance. The likes of Hardik Pandya (231 runs, Baroda), Mohammed Shami (9 wickets, Bengal) and Shreyas Iyer (278 runs, Mumbai) have played an integral role in helping their respective teams reach the quarterfinals, starting on Wednesday.Besides the trio, Rajat Patidar (253 runs, Madhya Pradesh), Jaydev Unadkat (7 wkts, Saurashtra), Ishant Sharma (7 wkts, Delhi), Rinku Singh (267 runs, Uttar Pradesh) and Karun Nair (229 runs, Vidarbha) have delivered. With the knockouts getting underway, it remains to be seen if star power can translate into trophy success for the teams.Among the quarterfinalists, four of them – Bengal, UP, Delhi and Mumbai – have tasted trophy success once each and will be keen to add another trophy to their cabinet. On the other hand, MP, Saurashtra and Vidarbha will be eying their maiden title. Baroda, twice runners-up in the last five editions, will look to go the distance this season.While the focus will be on the crowd pullers, other players around them need to step up. Among the quarterfinalists, Baroda have thrived on team effort with skipper Krunal Pandya, who has eight wickets in the competition, and Bhanu Pania (254 runs) being the key contributors.Baroda have been one of the standout teams, topping Group B, which included heavyweights Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Saurashtra and Gujarat among others. Baroda will carry confidence from the league performance, when they square up against Bengal at the Chinnaswamy Stadium. The latter have found success via Shami, Abishek Porel (313 runs), Karan Lal (332 runs) and Sayan Ghosh (13 wickets), making the clash intriguing.Meanwhile, Mumbai, who will meet Vidarbha in Alur, have been blessed with stars. The likes of Ajinkya Rahane (250 runs) and Shardul Thakur (12 wickets), Shivam Dube and Suryakumar Yadav have it in them to win matches on their own. Even Venkatesh Iyer (172 runs) and Avesh Khan (7 wickets) have made their presence felt for Madhya Pradesh, who face Saurashtra in Alur.At Alur: Madhya Pradesh vs Saurashtra (9 am); Mumbai vs Vidarbha (1:30 pm)At Chinnaswamy Stadium: Baroda vs Bengal (11 am); Delhi vs Uttar Pradesh (4:30 pm)","The quarterfinals of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy begin on Wednesday.

D Gukesh vs Ding Liren: World Chess Championship on razor's edge with two games to play,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/chess/d-gukesh-vs-ding-liren-world-chess-championship-on-razors-edge-with-two-games-to-play/articleshow/116194534.cms,"Ding Liren and D Gukesh after Game 12 (Photo: Maria Emelianova for FIDE)

Last two games when scores are equal (since 2000)

Summary:

Is losing five games too many?

0-1, 1-1, 2-1, 2-2

Strike back in next game after trailing WCC matches since 1995

Summary:

The World Chess Championship (WCC) stands at a tantalizing juncture. A series of seven consecutive draws in the middle games between world champion Diren Ling of China and his Indian challenger D Gukesh , may have lulled the casual observer into thinking that this duel was seriously lacking in excitement and aggression. But the experts have been continuously pointing out over the past fortnight that there is much that lies beneath.While they have conceded that this is arguably the most human of all title matches in the classical format, there still lurks the unknown, though the pattern does point out to Ding drawing Gukesh towards his favoured tiebreaks ‘endgame’.As things stand, with two games remaining, how Gukesh extracts himself from this web and emerges in those prodigious colours that was so expected of him will be foremost on Indian fans’ minds. Remember, if scores remain level after 14 games (either through draws or one win for each player), the match goes to rapid tiebreaks scheduled on Friday.Will the players remain ultracautious in the final two classical games on Wednesday (Gukesh gets white) and Thursday (Ding white)? Because one slip could decide the match. Who will manage nerves better in tiebreaks? There are more questions than answers as we head to the climax in this cerebral war between the Chinese emperor and the Indian prince.Do the past trends in WCC Matches provide an answer? TOI takes a look…2006: 2-2. Last two games drawn. Kramnik beat Topalov in tiebreaks.2010: 2-2. Game 11 drawn. Anand beat Topalov in Game 12 with black and retained the title.2012: 1-1. Both draws. Anand beat Gelfand via tiebreaks.2016: 1-1. Both draws. Carlsen beat Karjakin via tiebreaks.2018: 0-0. Both draws. Carlsen beat Caruana via tiebreaks.2023: 3-3. Both draws. Ding beat Nepo via stiebreaks.Only Anand-Topalov match saw a decisive result. Other matches went to tiebreaks.In the 2000, 2004, 2008, 2013, 2014 and 2021 matches, either the scores were not level before the last two games or the matches got over with one or more classical games to spare.Though Ding Liren has bounced back, he has already lost five games in his WCC career so far – three against Nepo last year and two against Gukesh (third and 11th game) in the ongoing match. Both world champions before Magnus Carlsen (since 2000), had to vacate their crowns once they lost five games in their WCC careers. Carlsen lost only two of 56 WCC games and forfeited his right to play last year.Kramnik: After dethroning Kasparov without losing a game in 2000, Kramnik lost two games against Leko in the winning campaign of 2004. And when he suffered his third loss against Anand in Bonn (2008), his days with the crown were numbered.Anand: Having lost one game each against Kramnik in 2008 and Gelfand in 2012, besides two against Topalov in 2010, Anand lost his fifth WCC game against Carlsen in their fifth game in Chennai (2013). He trailed 0-1 and never recovered, eventually losing the match 0-3 with two games to spare. In other words, if Ding manages to retain his crown, he will be the first player to do so despite losing five career games in world championships since 2000.The scoreline through four decisive games for Gukesh as he trailed after the first game, equalised in the third game, led after the 11th and was forced to draw level after the 12th. Only Anand (vs Topalov in 2010), Leko (vs Kramnik in 2004) and Kasparov (vs Karpov 1985) have experienced such a sequence in the last 60 years of WCC match history. Anand and Kasparov went on to win while Kramnik retained the title being the defending champion as there was no provision of tiebreaks then.1995: Anand wins G9, Kasparov G10.2006: Topalov G9, Kramnik G10.2010: Topalov wins G1, Anand G22012: Gelfand G7, Anand G82014: Carlsen G2, Anand G32023: Nepo wins G5, Ding G62024: Gukesh G11, Ding G12(All above wins were via white pieces)Except for Anand in 2014, the player who struck back immediately went on to win the match.",The World Chess Championship (WCC) stands at a tantalizing juncture.

NEW DELHI: Spinner George Linde delivered a stellar all-round performance to guide South Africa to an 11-run win over Pakistan in the first T20I at Kingsmead on Tuesday.Linde played a pivotal role with the bat, smashing a quickfire 48 off just 24 balls to help South Africa post a challenging total of 183-9 after opting to bat first. His explosive knock provided crucial momentum to the innings. David Miller was the standout performer with the bat, hammering a blistering 82 off 40 balls. His innings featured eight fours and four towering sixes, anchoring South Africa’s total despite wickets falling at regular intervals.In response, Pakistan managed 172-8, falling short despite a valiant effort by skipper Mohammad Rizwan , who top-scored with 74. Rizwan held the innings together but lacked adequate support, and the visitors struggled to keep up with the required run rate.Linde shone with the ball, returning exceptional figures of 4-21 in his four overs. He nearly claimed a hat-trick, but a review saved Haris Rauf after an LBW decision was overturned.

How can India still qualify for World Test Championship final?

NEW DELHI: Legendary West Indian pacer Andy Roberts has advised Virat Kohli to focus on Test cricket to regain form ahead of the third Test, starting on December 14 in Brisbane .Roberts, known for his straightforward views, remarked, ""get your batting right,"" urging the Indian star to prioritise the traditional format of the game.Kohli, regarded as one of the finest batters of his generation, has been struggling with his form in recent times.Since January 2020, Kohli's batting has scored 1,961 runs across 64 innings, maintaining an average of 32.14. During this period, the 36-year-old managed to score three centuries and nine half-centuries.Roberts, in his conversation with Mid-Day, offered a broader perspective to Kohli, who effectively silenced his critics by scoring his 81st international century in Perth. The remarkable achievement, his first Test hundred after a gap of 16 months, contributed significantly to India's historic victory with a margin of 295 runs.Roberts believes Test cricket offers Kohli the platform to regain his lost focus, emphasising the importance of red-ball cricket in shaping a player’s legacy.""I don’t know if there will be a revival after the Adelaide defeat, but get your batting right. One of your best batsmen of all-time has been struggling for the last five years,” he said referring to Kohli.“He needs to be focused on the longer version of the game. You will get runs and score heavily in Test cricket only when you are fully focused on the longer form. The standard of Test cricket is not the same. The top batsmen look as if they are struggling.”","Legendary West Indian pacer Andy Roberts has advised Virat Kohli to focus on Test cricket to regain form ahead of the third Test, starting on December 14 in Brisbane.

IND vs AUS: India batting has been a major cause of worry

IND vs AUS: Rohit Sharma has had a terrible time with the bat in whites

How can India still qualify for World Test Championship final?

ADELAIDE: The manner of India’s capitulation in the second Test has left them facing many questions, but the immediate need is to address the balance of the fast-bowling lineup.With the frontline batters more or less picking themselves, additional pace reinforcements could be uppermost on India’s mind going into the third Test. If it is a typically fast and furious, seaming Gabba surface, Jasprit Bumrah will cover up for some of the others. But what if the surface is flatter? Will it be another case of the team being too reliant on Bumrah, like in Adelaide? Will India then need a stronger third, or even fourth seamer?The question would have been playing on the minds of captain Rohit Sharma and coach Gautam Gambhir when the team returned to the site of the carnage, the Adelaide Oval, for a morning nets session here on Tuesday. This time, the red Kookaburra replaced the pink ball, a move likely to have been a welcome relief for many of the batters.Some all-too-familiar scenes played out.Rohit Sharma looked scratchy. Virat Kohli continued to work on his backfoot play. Shubman Gill and Yashasvi Jaiswal put in the hard yards. Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj, while present, chose to indulge in some ‘workload management’ and put in time at the gym instead. And Akash Deep continued to trouble all the top batters.Since preparations began for the second Test, Akash Deep has looked the most penetrative of the second rung of pacers during training, drawing praise from the likes of Kohli at the nets.Harshit Rana 's explosive Perth debut, of course, ensured he would walk into the XI in Adelaide. Disappointingly, Rana was largely listless in the pink-ball Test. Without regular inroads from Bumrah and Siraj, the pressure and inexperience showed.Rana’s lengths and pace were off. He was often easy pickings for the likes of Travis Head and to a lesser extent, Marnus Labuschagne. Mohammed Shami, remember, is not around yet.If the team persists with a specialist spinner in Ravichandran Ashwin or even Washington Sundar , how can they fit Akash Deep in without taking away some of the side’s batting depth? There’s also Prasidh Krishna, who wheeled away at the nets on Tuesday, waiting in the wings.One way would be to swap Rana for Akash Deep, but it’s not an easy choice to make. The team has backed Rana and it would be unfair to dump him after just his second Test. Rana was more impressive in the warm-up game against the PM XI as well, taking 4/44 from 6 overs, and in Perth he got rid of the dangerous Head and toppled the tail in the first innings.Akash Deep has more first-class experience but is a largely unknown quantity on foreign soil, having played only the India A-South Africa A game in Benoni a year earlier and come away wicketless. Rohit suggested as much after the Adelaide defeat, saying, “That option is always there (swapping Rana for Akash Deep). All the bowlers who are here are capable of walking into the side. But how could I drop Rana when he had done nothing wrong in his debut Test? He gave crucial breakthroughs.”If India do decide they need four frontline pacers at the Gabba, that would mean including both Rana and Deep. In that scenario, can they drop their lone spinner and go with an all-pace lineup? That too is a difficult decision to make, since apart from depriving the attack of variation it might also take away from the notional batting depth, given that both Ashwin or Sundar are credible batters in their own right. The exclusion of the lone spinner could hurt India in case of another top and middle-order collapse.The other option is scarier still, if India can stop obsessing over a seam-bowling allrounder. Latest sensation Nitish Kumar Reddy has made a stellar impact with the bat, his lower-order cameos adding crucial runs to the board in quick time. However, he has not been as penetrative as a fourth seamer as, say, Shardul Thakur was. He may not even be the fourth seamer the team needs in Brisbane .In Perth, Reddy contributed a crucial 41 as India folded for 150 in their first innings, but was required for only three overs when Australia batted, more to give the likes of Bumrah, Siraj and Rana a break. In the second innings too, he bowled only a notional four overs, though he got the wicket of Mitchell Marsh.In Adelaide, Rohit needed the services of a proper fourth seamer in Australia’s first innings, but Reddy bowled only six overs, though he did get Marnus Labuschagne out before being taken off. Marsh plays a similar fill-in role for the Aussies as fourth seamer, but it can be argued their main three pacers are far, far more penetrative and they are not over-reliant on just one bowler.What can turn out to be important for the team is the 163 runs Nitish has scored on this tour at 54.33 and a strike rate of 87.16. Most of his cameos have come with India in deep, deep trouble. With some veteran batters struggling for form, Nitish’s presence with the bat is crucial. The 14 overs he has bowled for two wickets at a strike rate of 42 is incidental.Given the fragility of the batting, there are no easy choices for India to make when it comes to settling on their pace lineup for Brisbane. Only one thing is clear — without runs from the top and middle order, no amount of tinkering with the bowling lineup will be of any help.",Harshit Rana was largely listless in the pink-ball Test.

NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer Mohammad Kaif sees Rohit Sharma under pressure as he now has the twin task -- to score runs as batter and use Jasprit Bumrah carefully as skipper -- going forward in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy .While Rohit flopped with the bat in the second game in Adelaide, scoring 3 and 6 in two innings, the skipper also faced a Bumrah injury scare as on the second day, Bumrah was seen in trouble while bowling.Amid a horrible show from the batters in both innings, the Bumrah injury came as a big scare but bowling coach Morne Morkel later assured that it was just a cramp.With no Mohammed Shami and an inexperienced bowling attack, Kaif feels that Rohit will have to be extra careful in using Bumrah while focussing on his own form with the bat.Rohit has been going through a rough patch with the bat as he has scored 8 single-digit scores in the last six Tests.After missing the Perth Test due to personal reasons, which India won by 295 runs, Rohit returned in the XI for the second Test and under him, the team lost the contest by 10 wickets.With the series now level at 1-1, Rohit now is in a tricky spot as India have to win the remaining three games Down Under to make it to the WTC Final on their own.",Rohit Sharma has been going through a rough patch with the bat as he has scored 8 single-digit scores in the last six Tests.

Azam Khan gears up for 'tough' ILT20 Season 3 with power-hitting promise

Is India's batting now over dependent on Yashasvi Jaiswal?

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan captain Sarfaraz Ahmed has addressed speculation about his international cricket future, stating that retiring would be his 'personal decision'.The experienced wicketkeeper-batter, currently mentoring the Dolphins team in the Champions T20 Cup , recently spoke about his future. As quoted from Geo News, ""Look, as far as my career is concerned. I think I don't need to say anything. Nothing is left. I know what you are waiting for, and it will happen soon.""These comments led to widespread speculation about his potential retirement. Given his limited recent appearances for Pakistan, many supporters believed the 37-year-old was preparing to end his career.Sarfaraz has since provided clarity on his earlier statement, confirming he remains active in cricket despite being outside the national selection committee's considerations.""Yes, I said 'nothing is left to say' the other day. Look, I am still playing cricket and will avail whatever opportunity I would get. In the Pakistan team, I never said that I want to bat in this position or that position."" He added, ""If I could be selected [in the national team], I would be. As far as leaving cricket is concerned, that is my personal decision. When I feel that I should quit cricket, I will quit,"" ANI quoted Sarfaraz as saying to Geo News in an interview.Since his Pakistan debut in 2007, Sarfaraz has been significant across all formats. His statistics include 54 Tests, 117 ODIs and 61 T20Is, accumulating 6,164 runs with six centuries and 32 fifties.His captaincy achievements include leading Pakistan to their first ICC Champions Trophy in 2017, defeating India by 180 runs in the final. He also guided Pakistan to victory in 11 consecutive T20I series, setting a national record for captains.Recently, his international appearances have decreased. His final Test match was in Australia in 2023, where he scored seven runs in his sole appearance of the series. His most recent white-ball match was against Bangladesh in Mirpur in November 2021.","Former Pakistan captain Sarfaraz Ahmed has addressed speculation about his international cricket future.

Royal Challengers Bengaluru ( RCB ) have explained their decision to release Faf du Plessis before the IPL mega auction held in Jeddah last month. Delhi Capitals subsequently secured du Plessis for Rs 2 crore.RCB released a video detailing their rationale. Mo Bobat, RCB's director of cricket operations, highlighted fan input.""All of you voted (fans voted via pre-auction polls) for Faf du Plessis to open the batting.""Du Plessis's age was also a factor in the decision-making process. Dinesh Karthik , another key figure at RCB, emphasised the importance of a batter's strike rate, particularly against spin in the initial six balls of an innings.""We would want a foreign opener because, on the day they get going, they can score a hundred in 60, 50, or 40 balls, whatever it might be. Players like Jos Buttler and Phil Salt have done this time and time again.""Karthik pointed out the scarcity of Indian openers with the desired power-hitting ability, contrasting this with the explosive potential of foreign openers.""Among Indian players, I can only think of Ishan Kishan , who has done that to a limited degree. We know why we don't want to go there (open with an Indian opener)—the power isn't there.""Bobat echoed Karthik's sentiment, emphasising Phil Salt's consistency and boundary-hitting prowess. He noted Salt's remarkable statistic of scoring 15 or more runs in an over 35% of the time.""Salt has achieved that consistently. If we aggregate everything, he emerges as the common denominator.""Karthik further elaborated on Salt's scoring patterns, underscoring his ability to consistently accumulate runs in boundaries. He provided specific statistical insights into Salt's scoring frequency.""My concurrence is that Phil Salt scores 6–8 runs in an over 28% of the time, and 12–15 runs in an over 30% of the time. In one out of four overs, he scores 16 or more runs, and in one out of two overs, he scores 12 or more.""RCB's preferred list of openers was revealed, highlighting their strategic considerations. The list included Phil Salt, Will Jacks, Rachin Ravindra, Jos Buttler, and Faf du Plessis.The video concluded by explaining the final decision. Salt's impressive statistics, dual role as a wicketkeeper, and his position in the auction order made him a compelling choice. RCB ultimately acquired Salt for Rs 11.5 crore.""Salt, Jacks, and Faf were considered for the opening slot. Salt's staggering numbers, dual skill of wicketkeeping, and auction order made him a priority option, and RCB ended up picking Salt for Rs 11.5 crore."" The video ended with a note.Du Plessis, a 40-year-old right-handed opening batsman, has a rich IPL history. He has represented Chennai Super Kings (CSK), Rising Pune Supergiant (RPS), and RCB.In his 145 IPL matches, Du Plessis has scored 4,571 runs at an average of 35.99. His strike rate exceeds 136, and his highest individual score is 96.Since becoming RCB's captain in 2022, Du Plessis has been a consistent performer. He amassed 1,636 runs at an average of 38.05 and a strike rate of nearly 147. He scored 15 half-centuries in 45 innings, with a high score of 96.Du Plessis played a crucial role in RCB's playoff qualification last season, contributing 438 runs at an average of 29.20 and a strike rate of 161.62. This included four half-centuries, with his highest score being 64.Despite his valuable contributions, RCB chose not to retain Du Plessis for the IPL 2025 season.

Sri Lanka suffered a 109-run defeat in the second Test, resulting in a 2-0 series whitewash by the hosts.Jayasuriya acknowledged that the Sri Lankan batters need to convert their starts into substantial scores, particularly hundreds, to be competitive in challenging conditions away from home.""Batsmen have to convert their scores into hundreds - 30s and 40s aren't enough. It's tough on these wickets, but at least two batters have to score hundreds on a tour like this. We didn't get that.

Although there was a lot of effort from the senior batters, I think if they assess themselves individually, they will realise it wasn't enough,"" he added.Jayasuriya praised Kamindu Mendis , describing him as a key player for the team.""Kamindu Mendis is a key player. In every Test match almost he was in the runs, aside from this series. If you saw the way he batted in this series, it was still with a lot of confidence.

NEW DELHI: FIFA will officially announce the 2030 and 2034 World Cup hosts on Wednesday.A joint bid from Morocco, Spain, and Portugal is expected to secure the 2030 tournament, while Saudi Arabia is anticipated to host in 2034.The hosting rights will be determined through a vote during a virtual FIFA Congress. However, the outcomes seem predetermined as neither bid faces competition.The 2030 World Cup holds special significance as it marks the centenary of the inaugural tournament held in Uruguay in 1930. To commemorate this milestone, Uruguay will host one match, alongside Argentina and Paraguay.The unique arrangement involves three different continental confederations, creating an unprecedented hosting scenario.FIFA confirmed over a year ago that the Morocco, Spain, and Portugal bid was the sole contender for 2030. Other potential bids had withdrawn.A joint British and Irish bid was abandoned to focus on hosting Euro 2028. There were also unconfirmed suggestions of a joint bid from South Korea, China, Japan, and North Korea.Four South American countries initially launched a joint bid in 2019. They believed the centenary World Cup should be held entirely on the same continent as the first tournament.In late 2022, UEFA promoted a joint bid involving Spain, Portugal, and war-torn Ukraine. This was seen as a gesture of “solidarity” following the Russian invasion.Ukraine was subsequently removed from the candidacy. Morocco joined the Iberian nations, and South America agreed to host three symbolic matches in exchange.Following the “centenary celebrations” in the Southern Hemisphere winter, the participating teams and their fans will travel across the Atlantic for the remaining 101 matches.This extensive tournament will conclude with the final on July 21st. The venue for the final match is yet to be determined.Spain, which hosted the 1982 World Cup, is expected to play a central role, offering 11 of the proposed 20 stadiums.Morocco, having unsuccessfully bid five times previously, will become the second African nation to host the World Cup, following South Africa in 2010.Potential final venues include Madrid’s Santiago Bernabeu, Barcelona’s renovated Camp Nou, and the planned Hassan II stadium. The Hassan II stadium, located between Casablanca and Rabat, is projected to be the ""biggest stadium in the world"" with a capacity of 115,000.Portugal, which hosted Euro 2004, will contribute two stadiums in Lisbon and one in Porto, hoping to host a semi-final.Regarding the 2034 World Cup, FIFA invoked its continental rotation principle, welcoming bids only from Asia or Oceania. The 2026 World Cup, expanded to 48 teams, will be hosted across North America.FIFA gave potential bidders a short timeframe to submit candidacies, causing controversy. Australia and Indonesia quickly withdrew their interest.This left Saudi Arabia as the sole candidate. This paves the way for the World Cup to return to the Gulf region after Qatar hosted in 2022.Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been utilizing sport to enhance the nation's global image and influence.Securing the 2034 World Cup would be a significant achievement for Saudi Arabia. Currently, they possess only two stadiums with a capacity of 40,000, while 14 are required.Besides the logistical challenges, the extreme summer temperatures might necessitate rescheduling the tournament to later in the year, similar to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. The timing of Ramadan in December 2034 presents an additional complication.The awarding of the World Cup to Saudi Arabia is expected to reignite discussions surrounding human rights, as seen with Qatar in 2022.Rights groups have raised concerns about mass executions, allegations of torture, restrictions on women under the male guardianship system, and limitations on free expression in Saudi Arabia.Saudi Arabia, currently hosting high-profile events like Formula One and the WTA Finals, faces accusations of ""sportswashing.""
