Dwayne Johnson moved to tears after powerful reception at Venice Film Festival



Poll Which aspect of Dwayne Johnson's transformation for the role do you find most impressive? His physical transformation His emotional depth

Benny Safdie and Emily Blunt share an emotional moment with Dwayne Johnson



Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson experienced one of the most emotional nights of his career when his latest film, The Smashing Machine, premiered at the Venice International Film Festival. The 53-year-old actor, portraying UFC legend Mark Kerr, was overcome with tears as the audience delivered a thunderous 15-minute standing ovation, among the longest of this year’s festival.Footage from inside the theater showed Dwayne Johnson wiping his eyes while applauding back at the cheering crowd. Standing beside him were his co-star Emily Blunt , director Benny Safdie , and Kerr himself, each visibly shaken by the extended applause. Variety’s co-editor-in-chief Ramin Setoodeh, who shared the moment on X, remarked, “Dwayne Johnson weeps during the 15-minute #Venezia2025 standing ovation for ‘The Smashing Machine.’ This was the most emotion we’ve since on the Lido since Brendan Fraser launched his Oscar campaign here four years ago for ‘The Whale.’”The comparison to Fraser’s Venice triumph quickly sparked speculation about Johnson’s awards season prospects.Fraser went on to win an Academy Award for The Whale, and Johnson’s raw, vulnerable turn as Kerr is already drawing early buzz.Johnson himself acknowledged how transformative the project has been. At a press conference earlier that day, he admitted, “I looked around a few years ago and I started to think, you know, am I living my dream or am I living other people’s dreams? I've been scared to go deep and intense and raw until now, until I had this opportunity.”Safdie, making his solo directorial debut after acclaimed collaborations like Uncut Gems, also broke down during the ovation, clutching Johnson and Blunt as tears streamed down his face. Blunt, who plays Kerr’s now-ex-wife Dawn Staples, stood hand-in-hand with Johnson as the real Mark Kerr wiped his own eyes from the audience.The moment showed how personal the film is for everyone involved. Johnson underwent a dramatic physical transformation to embody Kerr, stepping away from his signature blockbuster action persona. Fans even noticed his lean frame on the red carpet.Also Read: John Cena turns heads as he carries wife Shay Shariatzadeh over puddle during sweet public moment Distributed by A24, The Smashing Machine releases in theaters on October 3. If the reaction in Venice is any indication, Johnson may have delivered the most defining performance of his career.

Nagpur To Bombay, Via Calcutta

Mogambo… Khush Hua



A Politicians’ Tailor

Madhav Agasti’s mobile rings as we step into his tailoring shop in Bandra. “Farooq Abdullah ,” Agasti tells his son, Shantanu, before answering. The first time he had met Abdullah, then the chief minister of Jammu & Kashmir, was in 1984. Agasti was at the Delhi airport, and so were Abdullah and Congress’s NKP Salve. Salve was in a bandhgala and Abdullah had admired the cut. And that is how the serendipitous meeting took place. Spotting Agasti, Salve introduced him to Abdullah. Then things moved fast. Agasti requested Abdullah to accompany him to the VIP lounge. Out came Agasti’s measuring tape — he always carries one — and the measurements were done. What followed a few days later was an impeccable sherwani. Abdullah was impressed. He ordered a suit next, then a pathani, followed by a safari suit. “He remains my client to this day,” says Agasti.Agasti’s 76 now. And had invited Abdullah to his Andheri home for Ganeshotsav. But Abdullah called because he thought he would not be able to make it. But he’s promised to be back soon for new measurements.Agasti’s father was a bhikshuk in Nagpur, a wandering monk who stitched coats for a lawyer named Shewde.Agasti’s ambitions were likely sparked by his father’s skills. He left Nagpur for Calcutta, a young man in his early 20s. He found himself a job as a “cutter” in the city. Then he travelled to Moradabad to learn how to stitch sherwanis and then to Mhow, a cantonment town in MP, to study how to make military uniforms. He travelled back to Calcutta, and, this time, landed a job at a tailoring counter because he could speak English.In 1973, he moved to Bombay. “I was smoking outside Citylight Cinema in Mahim when I noticed a man with scissor marks on his hand, the hallmark of an assistant tailor. He worked at Super Tailors, dressmakers to Hindi film actors,” recalls Agasti. Soon enough, Agasti landed himself a job there.A door had opened for him. But what worked wonders was his learning from Mhow; 14 years later, that would catapult him to even higher tailoring fame. He stitched the military uniforms for the 1973 film, ‘Dhund’. And Danny Dengzongpa, who played the role of a cruel, wheelchairbound husband of Zeenat Aman in the film, loved the tailoring.Agasti had been noticed. His star was on the rise. Plus, his Nagpur-honed Hindi was good, and so was his Marathi. He quickly began to acquire admirers.Actor Sunil Dutt was the first to suggest that he strike out on his own. “There were no Maharashtrians in tailoring then,” Agasti says. He set up a small shop in Dadar in 1975. Word spread fast. Soon, ministers Vilasrao Deshmukh (“he loved safari suits”), Gopinath Munde, Pramod Mahajan (“he wore kurtas without pockets”), Sharad Pawar and L K Advani (“three-button jackets”) were clients.Through lawyer Shirish Gupte and theatre veteran Mohan Wagh, he met Bal Thackeray in 1981. “Balasaheb asked me to design clothes in such a manner that his legs wouldn’t show in photographs,” says Agasti. He crafted a white kurtapyjama that became the late Shiv Sena chief’s signature look. “I got him a shawl from Kashmir. He mostly preferred white and off-white,” adds Agasti, himself in off-white shirt and pants today “because this way, I don’t have to worry about combinations”. Thackeray nicknamed him “Rajshimpi” (politicians’ tailor).But you could also call Agasti a filmstars’ tailor.Last month, he received the Bharat Gaurav Award at the UK Parliament in London for designing Amrish ‘Mogambo’ Puri’s unforgettable costume in the 1987 blockbuster, Mr India, and also Bal Thackeray’s signature kurta-shawl look. He is now preparing for the release of his memoir, ‘Stitching Stardom’. The book traces his journey of image-making across comedians and chief ministers, prime ministers and presidents. Much has changed in tailoring — technology, speed, the churn of fast fashion — and much hasn’t. “Earlier it was about who you knew,” says Agasti. “Now it’s word of mouth.”As tea is served for unannounced guests — BJP’s Raghunath Kulkarni and former national secretary Sunil Deodhar have arrived in the shop — the septuagenarian darzee holds forth on his craft, his clients, and his takeaways from 50 years of dressing up the who’s who.“Contrary to perception,” he says, “politicians are the easiest clients and the best paymasters.” Many believed his “lucky hand” made their measurements special. As he reminisces about designing costumes for five villains in Anil Kapoor’s ‘Ram Lakhan’, his eyes settle on the crisp shirt Kulkarni is wearing. “The linen suits you,” Agasti says. “It’s linen?” asks Kulkarni. “Yes, and the American cut sits well,” replies Agasti, seated in the shop he opened in Bandra in Nov 1985, its launch postponed by 15 days to mourn the death of his friend Sanjeev Kumar.Dev Anand would sneak in through the back door, head bobbing, calling out: “ Ey Madhav, kya banaya hai mere liye ?” while Sunil Dutt preferred the front, greeting him warmly as “Madhav Seth”. He even kept a special stool for Mehmood, who would arrive most evenings, leaving the tailors in stitches with his antics.But the costume that cemented his name in Bollywood lore was Mogambo’s in Mr India. The now-iconic piece with its high-collared military cut and gold trimmings was meant to project both colonial grandeur and zamindar-like menace. Puri, who exclaimed “Mogambo… khush hua” on seeing it (here, in the Bandra shop), wore it with relish. “I worked with him from his first film till his last. After he passed away in 2005, I slowly stepped away from films,” says Agasti, who found the era of menacing villains fading from the silver screen. Soon, it was in politics, rather than films, that his reputation as a tailor of image flourished.From the dhoti-kurta and Jodhpurs era to the rise of the suit-boot and back, Agasti has seen political sartorialism in India come full circle. Various chief ministers, prime ministers and presidents — including Pranab Mukherjee — have taken oath in his creations. The busy Narasimha Rao would often be exercising on his stationary bike at 6 am when Agasti would get an appointment with the silk-jacket-favouring polymath.Someday soon, he hopes to tailor PM Narendra Modi’s clothes. “I’m a big fan of Narendra Modiji,” he says. “He dresses sharply, always to suit the occasion.”Today, as he marks half a century in the trade, the shop is lined with mementoes.Pride of place goes to a cap gifted by former Army Chief Manoj Mukund Naravane upon retirement. “Clothes make the person,” says Kulkarni. “By that measure, he (Agasti) is a personality builder.” Deodhar sizes him up as a “self-made man with networking skills and a sharp memory,” adding one enduring quality: “He calls himself a tailor with pride at a time when many look down on the profession. And… he always has a measuring tape handy. ”","Madhav Agasti, 76, is an award-winning tailor. He is best known for designing Mogambo’s off-white shirt and pants. Last month, he received the Bharat Gaurav Award at the UK Parliament.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123658352,imgsize-227263,width-400,resizemode-4/mogambos-tailor-netas-favourite-meet-the-dressmaker-of-icons.jpg"

Micah Parsons consoles young Cowboys fan after emotional reaction



Micah Parsons embraces pressure with Packers’ record contract



When the Dallas Cowboys stunned the NFL world by trading Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers, emotions ran high. Fans felt betrayed, pundits questioned Jerry Jones’ move, and a viral clip of a young supporter crying captured that heartbreak. Yet, what stood out was Parsons’ heartfelt response—FaceTiming the child, offering encouragement, and promising a Packers jersey with his iconic No. 1. In that moment, Parsons showed the human side of a blockbuster trade.The trade didn’t just impact analysts and fantasy football rosters—it hit fans on a deeply personal level. One viral TikTok video captured the raw emotion of a young Cowboys fan, filmed by his mother Lesley, breaking down in tears after learning Micah Parsons had been dealt away. What followed turned into one of the most heartwarming moments of the offseason.Parsons himself saw the clip, reached out, and later FaceTimed the devastated child. His words were both empathetic and motivational: “I saw that video, I’m sorry, bruh. I hope you know, in life, things happen that you can’t control, but you just got to keep going.”The four-time Pro Bowler didn’t stop there. He promised the boy a brand-new Packers jersey with his No.1 on it. “Even though you’re a big Cowboys fan, I hope that you still follow me and my career, because that’s what it’s all about. Passionate fans. That just meant a lot to me. I hope you know that.” He even playfully reminded the youngster to focus on school, joking that bad grades might cost him the jersey.For the fan, it was a tough lesson in the business side of sports, but also a reminder that heroes can be human too.The Cowboys received a haul—two future first-round picks and defensive tackle Kenny Clark—in exchange for Parsons. Meanwhile, Green Bay wasted no time, signing him to a four-year, $188 million extension, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in league history.At his Green Bay introduction, Parsons admitted the reality of the deal hadn’t fully sunk in. “I didn’t think I would be traded,” he said. “But that’s the harsh reality.” Still, he embraced the pressure, noting: “I’d be a fool to not think that there isn’t expectations… But then again, that’s a blessing in itself, that means that they believe in me that much.”Parsons’ staggering $47 million annually sets a new league benchmark, surpassing the record contracts handed out earlier this offseason to Cleveland Browns standout Myles Garrett ($40 million) and Pittsburgh Steelers star T.J. Watt ($41 million).His arrival in Green Bay has energized the locker room, with teammates eager to see the impact he’ll bring to their defense. Left tackle Rasheed Walker — Parsons’ former Penn State teammate — even went as far as to say the addition could put the Packers on a Super Bowl path.Parsons’ first test comes quickly: a month from now, he’ll return to Dallas in a Packers uniform, staring down the very fans who once cheered his every sack.Also Read: Patrick Mahomes teases Travis Kelce with geography joke ahead of Chiefs’ season opener in Brazil","Micah Parsons was traded by the Dallas Cowboys to the Green Bay Packers.

Gisele Bündchen’s modeling career has spanned decades, but even after reaching supermodel status, her beginnings remain an emotional subject. Back in June 2023, during a business conference in São Paulo, Brazil, the star teared up while recalling what it meant to leave her family behind as a teenager chasing her dreams.While speaking on stage at the VTEX event, Bündchen became visibly emotional as she looked back at her early journey.

She left everything she knew behind. ”That early sacrifice, the source explained, continues to shape her perspective even decades later. “It’s a long path to 40 when you leave at 14-15 years old.

When the Indiana Fever faced the Connecticut Sun on June 17, no one thought that it would be a change of destiny for Sophie Cunningham. Caitlin Clark absorbed a shove, an eye poke, and repeated hard contact. Many thought referees were failing to protect the rookie. That’s when teammate Sophie Cunningham stepped in, and arguably, it was one of the turning points of her WNBA career, at least, her popularity. There was less than a minute left, Cunningham fouled Jacy Sheldon hard, sparking a scuffle that ended with multiple ejections. It was a viral moment that reshaped Cunningham’s career and fueled Clark’s growing fandom.Sophie Cunningham later explained her decision with no hesitation: “I didn’t do that for clickbait. I stand up for my teammates.” The act, however, had immediate ripple effects. Fans quickly branded her Clark’s “enforcer,” while detractors booed her loudly at away games. But it turned out to be a blessing in disguise. Within days, Cunningham’s social media following surged past a million across Instagram and TikTok.Her profile spike also had financial implications in a positive way. PRP, the agency representing her, lined up fresh deals, including one with Ring. She added six more endorsements in the weeks after the incident and launched a podcast in July with Bravo star West Wilson. “When you’re in this position, everything is on the table to be talked about,” Cunningham told The New York Times. She declined to share figures but admitted the new opportunities will be higher than her $100,000 WNBA salary.The moment also attracted attention from conservative commentators, who framed Clark’s treatment as racially motivated and embraced Cunningham as a defender. Some critics even nicknamed her “MAGA Barbie.” Cunningham brushed off the label, calling herself “right down the middle” politically.The Fever guard’s bond with Clark has only extended her popularity. The two often interact on social media and share lighthearted moments on the bench. Their connection certainly adds to Cunningham’s image as Clark’s trusted ally. That chemistry matters. In a league where visibility is still an uphill battle, Cunningham’s fiery defense of Clark and her unfiltered personality have helped draw new eyes to the Fever.Also Read: What is George Raveling's connection to Michael Jordan?

Taylor Fritz’s girlfriend Morgan Riddle turns heads in stylish New York-inspired tank top



Morgan Riddle has become as much a talking point at the US Open as her boyfriend, world No. 4 Taylor Fritz. The 28-year-old influencer, who met Fritz on a dating app in 2020, has created her own spotlight courtside. Riddle, who is known for bold fashion choices and a mission to make tennis “cool” again, recently drew viral attention for balancing on a stadium railing in heels while cheering for Fritz.Morgan Riddle’s viral moment came just before Taylor Fritz’s quarterfinal clash against Novak Djokovic. In a TikTok video captioned “U.S. Open final boss,” she perched on a concrete railing with a drink balanced on her head, an internet challenge dubbed “squat and slay.” Two signature Honey Deuce cocktails sat on the railing beside her, adding to the daring scene.The video quickly passed 300,000 views and has been increasing since, sparking conversation across TikTok and Instagram. While Fritz did not comment on the viral video, he often supports her content on TikTok. “I think what she did was awesome for our sport,” Fritz said when asked about her viral content. “It got a ton of people looking at it.I think you get your typical older fan who may be upset about it. I don’t understand how anyone can get upset about it. ”Beyond TikTok stunts, Riddle’s style choices have become a staple of this year’s tournament. One of her most talked-about looks featured a white tank top with “New York” written in the shape of an apple, paired with pins of an apple and a yellow taxi. Captioned “right to the core 🍎,” the look was a playful nod to the city hosting the event.Also Read: UFC star Garrett Armfield reveals Emily Goldberg's father ruined his proposal surprise Riddle’s growing presence has been a mild talk of the town.

Junior Caminero’s rise to stardom at such young age speaks a lot



Where Junior Caminero stands among Rays legends



At just 22 years old, Junior Caminero is rewriting what it means to be a young power hitter in MLB. The Tampa Bay Rays third baseman, who only celebrated his birthday a few weeks ago, has already joined rare company by becoming just the second player in franchise history to hit 40 home runs in a season. His historic swing against the Seattle Mariners not only tied the game but also etched his name deeper into Rays’ lore.Junior Caminero’s journey to this point has been nothing short of remarkable. His stateside debut in 2022 showed flashes of brilliance, but the Rays wanted to accelerate his growth. That decision led him to an unlikely stop in Australia with the Perth Heat, where his power bat quickly became the talk of the league. Fast forward to 2025, and Caminero has proven that the Rays’ gamble paid off.“I feel that I belong here,” Caminero said earlier this season, reflecting on his mindset shift. Confidence has been the key. Unlike his midseason call-ups in 2023 and 2024, this year he has anchored himself in the lineup from Opening Day. That security has translated into results—an astonishing 40 home runs and 97 RBIs so far, making him one of the most dangerous hitters in the American League.He isn’t just breaking franchise records. Caminero recently became the first player aged 22 or younger to smash 11 homers in a 16-game span since 1980. He also joined Albert Pujols and Juan Soto as the only Dominican players to hit 30 home runs before turning 22.The Rays have had their share of powerful bats, from Carlos Peña to Jose Canseco. Yet Caminero is rapidly climbing that list. Before the All-Star break, he tied Peña and Canseco for the most home runs in team history at 19. His Home Run Derby appearance in Atlanta, followed by a two-homer game against the Orioles, only further cemented his reputation as a generational slugger.With the Rays out of playoff contention this season, Caminero’s rise is the brightest storyline. If his current pace continues, the young star could not only become the greatest power hitter in Tampa Bay history but also a household name in baseball for years to come.Also Read: MLB 2025 Playoff scenes post Labor Day: Wild Card standings, bracket, division leaders and more",Tampa Bay Rays third baseman Junior Caminero is rewriting what it means to be a young power hitter in MLB.

Why NFL’s highly anticipated Friday opener won’t happen in 2026 despite record-breaking TV numbers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/why-nfls-highly-anticipated-friday-opener-wont-happen-in-2026-despite-record-breaking-tv-numbers/articleshow/123667364.cms,"Why the NFL won’t play on opening Friday in 2026 (Getty Images)

Why the NFL can’t play on Friday in 2026



NFL’s international ambitions remain strong



The NFL is shaking up its schedule for 2026, and fans will notice a major change. For the past two years, the league opened Week 1 with a Friday night showcase, often tied to its international expansion. But that tradition won’t continue. Citing federal law, the league confirmed that no Friday game will be played during Week 1 of the 2026 season.Hans Schroeder, the NFL’s Executive Vice President of Media Distribution, explained that the shift is not a choice but a legal necessity. The Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961 prohibits professional football games on Friday or Saturday evenings during the high school and college football seasons. The aim was to protect grassroots programs from competing directly with the NFL’s massive reach.In 2024 and 2025, the league sidestepped the restriction because Labor Day fell early, allowing the Friday opener to slide in before the blackout period. However, in 2026, Labor Day falls on September 7. That places the second Friday of the month — the league’s traditional opener window — squarely inside the restricted period.As Schroeder confirmed, “the league cannot legally open its season the same way it has the past couple of years. ”This shift marks the end of what had quickly become a lucrative experiment. Broadcasters spent heavily for exclusive rights to those Week 1 international Friday games. In fact, NBC Universal and Peacock paid $105 million in 2024, while YouTube matched the same fee in 2025. With the blackout rule in effect, the league will have to redirect that spotlight.While the Friday opener disappears, the NFL isn’t slowing down its global push. In 2026, the season will kick off with the league’s first-ever regular-season game in Australia, hosted at the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground with the Los Angeles Rams as the home team. São Paulo, Dublin, London, Berlin, and Madrid are also on the international slate, marking the most ambitious overseas schedule in league history.The Friday night gap may ultimately fuel broader scheduling changes. Reports suggest the league is exploring the possibility of an 18-game season, which would allow an entire slate of international matchups packaged in the 9:30 a.m. ET window for broadcasters. Commissioner Roger Goodell has been vocal about his vision: to spread the NFL’s footprint worldwide with as many as 17 or 18 games played internationally.For now, though, fans should savor the 2025 Friday night clash between the Kansas City Chiefs and Los Angeles Chargers in São Paulo. Once the whistle blows in 2026, Week 1 will look different, but the NFL’s global reach will only continue to expand.Also Read: Experts warn Ravens’ Buffalo Bills woes may continue, but Lamar Jackson could flip the script under the lights","The NFL won't play a Friday night game in 2026, citing federal law.

NFL insiders back Myles Garrett as top choice for 2025 Defensive Player of the Year

Myles Garrett’s contract extension, offseason controversy, and 2025 expectations

The Cleveland Browns didn’t come close to expectations last season, stumbling to a 3–14 finish in 2024. But while the team’s struggles defined the year, Myles Garrett’s dominance never wavered. The former No. 1 overall pick remained a constant force in the trenches, piling up sacks and tackles-for-loss despite facing relentless double teams. Yet the offseason was far from smooth for the Browns’ defensive cornerstone. Garrett requested a trade, spoke publicly about wanting to win elsewhere, and even skipped voluntary workouts. Now, heading into 2025, he’s back in Cleveland with a record-breaking contract and the spotlight firmly on him.Despite the turbulence, Myles Garrett remains the favorite to reclaim the Defensive Player of the Year award. In July, The Athletic’s Jeff Howe conducted a survey among league insiders, and Garrett’s reputation carried the day.“Garrett ran away with this category for the second consecutive year, even strengthening his perch after drawing 13 of 26 votes in 2024,” Howe wrote. “What’s more, the 2023 Defensive Player of the Year slipped to third in that voting last season, but he still stood out this summer in voters’ minds.”This time, Garrett earned 17 of 30 votes, a clear sign that, across the NFL, he’s still viewed as the league’s most unstoppable defender.The Browns made headlines of their own when they refused to trade Garrett, eventually finalizing a massive extension on March 9, 2025. The four-year, $160 million deal includes $123.5 million guaranteed, a $40 million annual salary, and a no-trade clause that ties him to Cleveland through 2030.Not everyone in Northeast Ohio welcomed the offseason drama. Some fans felt frustrated by Garrett’s trade request and his absence from voluntary workouts. Others pointed to another speeding ticket, suggesting he needs to win back trust. Still, his production has never been questioned — Garrett posted 14 sacks, 47 tackles, three forced fumbles, and a league-leading 22 tackles-for-loss in 2024.Myles Garrett enters the 2025 season as both the Browns’ defensive cornerstone and the NFL’s top favorite for Defensive Player of the Year. His dominance is unquestionable, his new contract guarantees stability, and league insiders continue to back him as the standard for elite pass rushing. But in Cleveland, the challenge isn’t just about sacks and awards — it’s about proving he’s still the leader this fan base can believe in.Also Read: CeeDee Lamb responds to doubters as the Dallas Cowboys face Micah Parsons and the Green Bay Packers in the 2025 season opener","NFL insiders back Myles Garrett as top choice for 2025 Defensive Player of the Year.

Aaron Glenn keeps Aaron Rodgers in the rearview as New York Jets look ahead

Aaron Glenn charts a new course for the New York Jets beyond Aaron Rodgers



With the NFL season set to kick off, the New York Jets are gearing up for a crucial first-week showdown against the Pittsburgh Steelers. With the NFL season opener fast approaching, the New York Jets are gearing up for an important first game against the Pittsburgh Steelers.What makes this meeting even more compelling is the man under center for Pittsburgh Aaron Rodgers , the New York Jets’ former quarterback and one of the league’s most decorated players. But New York Jets head coach Aaron Glenn isn’t interested in looking backward.Rather than feeding into the buzz surrounding Aaron Rodgers, Glenn is concentrating fully on the path forward.With a new quarterback leading the huddle and a new culture taking root, Aaron Glenn has made it clear: the future is now.Taking over as head coach during a transitional year, Aaron Glenn stepped into a job already clouded by storylines.A major talking point has been Aaron Rodgers ’ departure from the Jets, whose short stint with the team generated significant media buzz. As the Jets prepare to face Rodgers in their season opener, head coach Aaron Glenn is deliberately avoiding the hype surrounding Rodgers’ comeback. His approach is deliberate. With a full season ahead and many young players to develop, Aaron Glenn is redirecting attention to the roster he’s building. The message to the team is clear as this isn’t about one individual or one game, but about sustaining momentum across a long and demanding season.Aaron Rodgers, now leading the Pittsburgh Steelers, brings one of the most storied résumés in NFL history. Rodgers holds an impressive legacy as he won Super Bowl XLV and took home the MVP award for that game, earned the NFL MVP title four times, and was named First-Team All-Pro twice. Over his career, he’s thrown for over 42,500 passing yards, achieved a career passer rating of 103.1, and set the NFL record for the lowest interception percentage in a single season. His 4.23:1 touchdown-to-interception ratio remains the best in league history, a testament to his surgical precision and decision-making under pressure.Despite Aaron Rodgers’ impressive legacy, Glenn and the Jets are concentrating on the team’s current progress and future goals rather than dwelling on past successes.The organization is focusing on internal progress, especially at the quarterback position. Justin Fields, now at the helm, represents the direction Aaron Glenn is committed to youth, leadership, and accountability. The New York Jets are building around their current core, and that includes strong voices on defense and developing depth across the offensive line.Behind the scenes, the team has been emphasizing competition, unity, and staying grounded. There's no room for distractions as they try to reshape their identity. Facing Aaron Rodgers so early in the season could have sparked a media frenzy, but Aaron Glenn’s calm, controlled leadership has kept things in perspective. This isn’t a revenge game; it’s the first of many tests.The New York Jets are beginning a new chapter, and Aaron Glenn is setting the tone.By choosing not to highlight Rodgers’ return, Glenn is clearly signaling that the team’s main focus is on internal work and performance rather than outside noise. With a young quarterback taking charge and a full season of opportunity ahead, the spotlight is no longer on what was but what’s next. For Aaron Glenn, the goal is clearly to build a team that wins not just headlines, but games.Also Read: Swifties & NFL Fans Unite: How the Engagement Bridge Two Cultures","New York Jets head coach Aaron Glenn is deliberately avoiding the hype surrounding Aaron Rodgers' return to the NFL.

Toronto Maple Leafs sign Dennis Hildeby to three-year extension,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/toronto-maple-leafs-sign-dennis-hilde-by-to-three-year-extension/articleshow/123661760.cms,"Photo by Julian Avram/Getty Images

Why Dennis Hildeby could be the Toronto Maple Leafs ’ next full-time NHL goaltender

What Dennis Hildeby’s contract means for the Toronto Maple Leafs’ goalie future

The Toronto Maple Leafs finalized an important piece of business on Tuesday in Toronto, announcing a three-year contract extension for goaltender Dennis Hildeby. The deal carries an average annual value of $841,667 and removes the final restricted free agent from general manager Brad Treliving’s offseason to-do list. With this signing complete, Treliving can now turn full attention to training camp, the pre-season schedule, and the possibility of professional tryouts.The contract is structured to support Hildeby’s ongoing development. For the 2025-26 and 2026-27 seasons, the deal is two-way, allowing the Maple Leafs flexibility in moving him between the NHL and AHL. Beginning in 2027-28, it shifts to a one-way format, a move that points toward the organization’s confidence in Hildeby as a potential NHL-calibre goaltender.Drafted in the fourth round of the 2022 NHL Draft, Dennis Hildeby has steadily built a résumé in North America. His NHL action came during the 2024-25 season, when injuries pushed him into six games with the Maple Leafs. He went 3-3-0 with a .872 save percentage and a 3.33 goals-against average. While the numbers reflected his adjustment to the league, the experience offered him a firsthand look at the demands of NHL competition.At the AHL level with the Toronto Marlies , Hildeby’s results have been more consistent. In 30 games during the 2024-25 season, he recorded a 16-9-4 record with a 2.55 goals-against average, a .908 save percentage, and two shutouts. Across his AHL career, he has appeared in 73 games, posting a 37-21-11 record with a 2.53 goals-against average, a .909 save percentage, and six shutouts.“Every time he’s been called upon, he’s handled himself with professionalism,” a team official noted in Toronto earlier this summer. That assessment underlines why the Maple Leafs continue to view him as a player who could grow into a regular NHL role.The structure of Hildeby’s new deal also aligns with upcoming roster decisions. Current backup Anthony Stolarz is scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent after the 2025-26 season. If the Maple Leafs choose to re-sign Stolarz for a short term, his contract would overlap with the point at which Hildeby’s deal converts to one-way status in 2027-28. That timing reflects how the organization is planning its depth chart in goal, keeping Hildeby in position to take on a larger role in the near future.For now, Hildeby remains the top option for call-ups when injuries strike, as seen last season. His continued performance in the AHL will dictate how quickly he moves up the depth chart.By securing Hildeby on Tuesday, the Maple Leafs ensured stability in their goaltending pipeline. The combination of a two-way start and a one-way finish to his contract signals a clear progression plan. If his numbers with the Marlies translate upward, Hildeby could be positioned to make the jump to a full-time NHL role by the time his deal enters its final year.Also Read: Quinn Hughes’ future in question while Vancouver Canucks takes another look at Vitali Kravtsov","Dennis Hildeby signed a three-year contract extension with the Toronto Maple Leafs on Tuesday.

Deion Sanders’ advice for Travis Hunter as a new dad



Travis Hunter embraces fatherhood and NFL dreams



Travis Hunter is stepping into fatherhood and the NFL at the same time, and one man who has been by his side throughout this journey is Deion Sanders. The Hall of Famer, who once recruited Hunter to Jackson State and later coached him at Colorado, recently shared heartfelt fatherly advice for the Jacksonville Jaguars rookie as he embraces life’s two biggest milestones — becoming a professional athlete and a dad.For Sanders, Hunter has always been more than a player. Their bond goes back to 2021 when Hunter, then the No. 1 recruit in the nation, shocked everyone by committing to Jackson State instead of a powerhouse like Florida State. He later followed Sanders to Colorado, where he won the 2024 Heisman Trophy as a two-way sensation. Through it all, Sanders played a fatherly role, especially during Hunter’s toughest moments.On the night Hunter lifted the Heisman, his biological father was absent due to legal troubles. Sanders stepped in, embracing the young star in what became one of the most emotional moments of Hunter’s career. Years later, when Sanders was quietly battling a bladder cancer scare and couldn’t attend Hunter’s wedding, the rookie showed up at his coach’s Texas ranch, standing by him as the two shared quiet moments fishing together.“Oh my god, I’m taking a deep breath because I love him to life — I love him like he’s my son,” Sanders said. “It’s funny when your son is now a father… it’s a beautiful thing.“The thing that I told him is let’s correct all the things that we think we didn’t receive as children and let’s do that in our fatherhood. No matter what happens, let’s make sure we are the best darn father that ever walked. That’s what I told him. I’m proud of him, I love him to life, and I miss him dearly.”It wasn’t coach-speak. It was a father figure speaking to someone he considers family.Hunter, just 22, is now a husband and a father. He and his longtime girlfriend, Leanna Lenee, tied the knot earlier this year before welcoming their first child, a baby boy. In a heartfelt video titled “Dear Son…”, Hunter can be heard saying to his newborn, “Gotta be better than me.”The timing couldn’t be more symbolic. On September 7, Hunter will make his NFL debut when the Jaguars face the Carolina Panthers. It marks the start of two parallel journeys: one on the field as a top draft pick, and one at home as a father. With Sanders’ wisdom and his own determination, Hunter now carries two legacies — as a rising NFL star and as a dad committed to doing things right.Also Read: Justin Jefferson injury update: Vikings may take cautious approach as hamstring issue raises long-term concerns",Jacksonville Jaguars rookie Travis Hunter is stepping into fatherhood and the NFL at the same time.

Travis Kelce adds millions and star power of his own

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have officially stepped into their “Engagement Era,” sealing their love story with a fairytale-worthy proposal. The Kansas City Chiefs star popped the question in a dreamy garden setting, where Swift showed off a dazzling 13-carat diamond ring estimated at $650,000. The couple announced the news in a joint Instagram post, writing: “Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married.”At just 35, Swift has built one of the most impressive fortunes in music history. With a net worth of $1.6 billion, the pop icon has become the richest female musician in the world. Her record-breaking Eras Tour generated over $1 billion in revenue, while her complete ownership of her music catalog added even more weight to her financial power. On top of her music, Swift owns an impressive real estate portfolio worth about $120 million and even a private jet valued at $23 million.This engagement marks yet another milestone for Swift, who has consistently balanced her global stardom with carefully placed personal moments that resonate deeply with fans.Though Kelce’s net worth of $70 million doesn’t compare to Swift’s billion-dollar empire, the NFL star brings a diverse financial portfolio to the partnership.His 12-year career has earned him more than $100 million in contracts, while his off-field ventures—including a hit podcast with his brother Jason, TV hosting gigs, endorsement deals, and investments in Formula 1 and restaurants—have earned him an additional $80 million.Together, Swift and Kelce boast a combined net worth of $1.67 billion, placing them among the most powerful celebrity couples in the world.

Justin Jefferson’s hamstring remains a long-term concern



Vikings’ star faces pressure to stay healthy all season



The Minnesota Vikings are preparing to have Justin Jefferson fully available for their season opener against the Chicago Bears on Monday night. Still, lingering concerns over the star wideout’s hamstring injury are shaping the team’s strategy. Jefferson strained his hamstring during the second practice of training camp, and while he has steadily increased his workload, insiders believe this will be a season-long storyline the Vikings must carefully manage.Jefferson’s return to action has been encouraging, but Minnesota insider Ben Goessling warned fans not to mistake his progress for complete recovery. Speaking on KFAN-FM 100.3, Goessling explained, “I think this is going to be a long-term maintenance thing. He’s had enough hamstring stuff at this point that I would not be surprised — he practices hard and he does not like to miss practices — I wonder if they will mitigate any of that. ”That statement highlights the delicate balance Minnesota faces: keeping its top receiver game-ready while preventing setbacks. The Vikings are expected to limit his workload in certain practices, with close monitoring throughout the season.Jefferson may frequently be seen stretching indoors or working in the sideline tents during open practice periods.History underscores why caution is necessary. Jefferson missed seven games in 2023 due to a right hamstring strain, his first extended absence since entering the league. The latest setback in July sidelined him for about three weeks, during which he avoided preseason and joint practices. His first true test comes at Soldier Field — a stadium with a notoriously fragile grass surface. With new sod only recently installed after multiple concerts, footing could pose an additional risk in Week 1.Jefferson’s impact on the Vikings is undeniable. His explosiveness and ability to stretch defenses make him the centerpiece of Kevin O’Connell’s offense. Yet the concern lingers: can Jefferson perform at full strength across a grueling 17-game season?Goessling reiterated that Jefferson’s hamstrings have now become a “consistent enough issue” that demand constant attention. This could mean fewer practice reps, strategic rest, and constant stretching routines. For a player who prides himself on hard work and rarely missing practices, such adjustments may not come easily.The Vikings know they cannot afford another prolonged absence from Jefferson. His health will directly influence Minnesota’s playoff hopes in a tightly contested NFC. For now, the team is optimistic he’ll be ready in Chicago. But the season-long question remains: can Justin Jefferson’s hamstring hold up when the Vikings need him most?Also Read: A billion-dollar love story: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's fairytale proposal comes with billion-dollar stakes","Vikings’ star faces pressure to stay healthy all season.

Bill Belichick and Jordon Hudson’s unconventional relationship continues to stir debate

Bill Belichick’s debut as North Carolina’s head coach was always going to be a spectacle, but one fan sign ensured the spotlight wasn’t just on football. Ahead of the matchup against TSU, a UNC supporter brought a cringeworthy poster featuring Belichick and his girlfriend Jordon Hudson, blending sports, pop culture, and controversy in a way that quickly went viral.As fans poured into Chapel Hill, one sign stood out above the rest. The poster depicted a silhouette of Belichick and his girlfriend Jordon Hudson posing on a beach together—but with a twist. The design mimicked the iconic Air Jordan logo, a tongue-in-cheek nod to UNC’s most famous alum, Michael Jordan. Social media immediately lit up with reactions, branding it everything from “creative” to downright “cringy.”The viral sign is only the latest example of how Belichick’s relationship with Hudson has become just as much a talking point as his coaching comeback.Belichick, now 73, has been dating Hudson, 24, since 2023. The pair’s nearly 50-year age difference has been at the center of public chatter, but their dynamic has also made headlines for other reasons. Earlier this year, Hudson interrupted Belichick during a CBS News interview, sparking both amusement and confusion among viewers. On top of that, her frequent social media posts featuring the famously stoic coach have shown a side of Belichick that few fans are used to seeing.Also Read: Bill Belichick’s 24-year-old girlfriend Jordon Hudson rocks Tar Heel blue alongside Randy Moss at UNC debut game While many who came to Chapel Hill focused on whether Belichick could bring his legendary NFL expertise to the college level, it’s clear his personal life continues to follow him onto the field.

Former Miami Heat star Dwyane Wade has recently revealed a shocking incident from his major league career. He recalled a moment when he felt left out during the All-Star Weekend. Slam Magazine had a Zoom interview with the icon in early June to discuss the same. They further talked about the influence of the 2003 draft class on and off the court and how he, LeBron James , and Chris Bosh reportedly shaped the NBA.Dwyane Wade recently shared memories of his early days. He discussed how he, LeBron James , and Chris Bose contributed to the NBA's structure in a recent interview with Slams Magazine.The Cleveland Cavaliers selected Bron first. They also picked Dwyane Wade in the fifth round of the draft. On the other hand, Chris Bosh was selected by the Toronto Raptors with the fourth overall pick.Future Hall of Famers LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony , and Dwyane Wade were chosen in what is widely considered one of the greatest NBA drafts in history. D- Wade also said the same. During the interview, he said:“We knew it in that moment. We didn’t know what it was going to be or what it was going to look like, but we knew that we were shifting the culture. And it’s not even the superteams. Everyone wants to make this about superteams….”He continued:“And then we just shifted the power a little bit.

We just didn’t know what was going to happen, we didn’t know that Kevin Durant was going to go to Golden State later. We didn’t know these things were going to happen, but we did know that, Hey, we’re doing something special. And we knew in 10, 20 years we’d be able to look back and be like, Yo, that was a key moment…”King James, CB, and D-Wade were aware that they would face a lot of criticism for their decision to work together rather than attempt to win a championship alone.

Mitch Marner’s family, winning goals, and vision for his future in Vegas

Mitch Marner’s blockbuster sign-and-trade from the Toronto Maple Leafs to the Vegas Golden Knights shocked fans across the NHL this summer. But according to his longtime agent Darren Ferris, the decision didn’t play out the way he had envisioned. On the 100% Hockey With Millard & Shannon podcast, Ferris opened up about how Marner turned down his advice to explore free agency before sealing the $96 million deal.Ferris revealed he hoped Marner would go through the full process of meeting teams in free agency, describing it as the classic “dog and pony show.” But Marner’s mind was already made up. “I wanted that to go to free agency and do the whole dog and pony show, but he didn't want to do it,” Ferris admitted. Instead, Marner was sold on Vegas after speaking directly with players who praised how the Golden Knights treat families.That family-first approach resonated deeply with Marner. “He (Marner) heard directly from other players about Vegas and how they treat the players and their families, too,” Ferris explained. By the end of the Maple Leafs’ season, Marner had decided he wanted to be a Knight.In July, Marner confirmed he spoke with his wife, Stephanie LaChance, and gave his agent the green light.“This was a spot very high on my list, we wanted to come here, and I went back to my agent (and) said I’m open to doing this,” he said via NHL.com. For Marner, the chance to compete for a Stanley Cup with a franchise that won it all in 2023 was too good to pass up.Also Read: “There was a death threat”: Mitch Marner reveals threats and security fears during final months with Toronto Maple Leafs Ferris ultimately respected his client’s decision, saying his role was simply to support him once his choice was clear.

Edmonton insists Connor McDavid is staying, but doubts remain

Why the Maple Leafs are perfectly positioned to make a play

The future of Connor McDavid has become the most captivating storyline in hockey. While the Edmonton Oilers maintain confidence in their captain’s eventual extension, whispers of a Toronto Maple Leafs homecoming continue to gather steam. With each passing day, the possibility feels less like wild speculation and more like a scenario that NHL front offices must prepare for.The Oilers’ public stance has been one of calm assurance. Local insiders such as David Staples argue that McDavid already knows his future is in Edmonton and is merely waiting for the right time to finalize a deal. “Staples believes McDavid knows he’s going to re-sign and is simply controlling the timing to avoid distraction.”On paper, it makes sense. The Oilers have built a perennial contender around their superstar, reaching consecutive Stanley Cup Finals. Walking away from that foundation would be nearly unthinkable.And yet, hockey history is filled with unthinkable moments. Behind the optimism lies an uncomfortable truth: as long as McDavid hasn’t put pen to paper, uncertainty lingers.Here’s where the rumors gain traction. McDavid’s family ties to Ontario remain strong, and sources suggest the pull of home is real.The Maple Leafs, desperate to capture their first Stanley Cup since 1967, appear to be strategically clearing cap space—nearly $25 million will be available next summer. The recent departure of Mitch Marner only fuels speculation that Toronto is preparing for the boldest move in franchise history.The thought of McDavid in a Leafs jersey isn’t just fan fiction anymore—it’s a chessboard maneuver NHL executives are watching closely.

Carey Price’s wife responds to speculation about his contract



A candid message of realism and loyalty to the Canadiens



The uncertainty surrounding Carey Price’s future in Montreal has taken an emotional turn, with his wife Angela Price offering her candid perspective. The legendary goaltender hasn’t played since 2022 due to a lingering knee injury, yet his $10.5 million contract continues to weigh heavily on the Canadiens’ salary cap. Now, as speculation builds about the team moving his deal, Angela’s words reflect both realism and loyalty.Price’s absence has been deeply felt by the Canadiens and their fans. Once the backbone of Montreal’s remarkable run to the 2021 Stanley Cup Final, the former MVP has struggled to return to the crease. With the Canadiens already stretched above the salary cap, trading his contract seems inevitable.When asked about the possibility, Angela Price didn’t shy away from honesty: “Probably the same way most of Montreal would feel… but ultimately you want what’s best for the team.”Her response captures a sentiment many in Montreal share. While the idea of severing ties with a franchise icon may sting, the business side of hockey often leaves little room for sentimentality.Throughout his career, Carey Price embodied loyalty to Montreal. Even when Jaroslav Halak briefly stole the spotlight during the 2010 playoffs, Price persevered and reclaimed his starting role. That resilience carried him to legendary status, culminating in his Hart Trophy win as NHL MVP in 2015 — the first Canadiens goalie to do so since José Théodore.Yet, the present reality is harsher. With a contract too large for a sidelined player, management’s decision will be driven by cap space and long-term planning rather than legacy. Angela Price’s remarks remind fans that sometimes love for the team means embracing tough choices.If and when the Canadiens move on from Price’s deal, it won’t erase his impact. Instead, it will underscore the delicate balance between heart and business that defines professional sports.Also Read: NHL insiders suggest Penguins are preparing a fire sale while Sidney Crosby rumors continue to swirl","Carey Price hasn’t played since 2022 due to a lingering knee injury.

Nathan MacKinnon ready for the Olympic spotlight



Nathan MacKinnon and Canada’s gold-or-bust mentality



For Nathan MacKinnon , the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan carry more weight than any other stage he’s faced. The Colorado Avalanche superstar, who has yet to skate in the Games, now has the chance to represent Canada on hockey’s grandest platform. With the NHL returning to Olympic competition for the first time since 2014, expectations are soaring—and so is the pressure.MacKinnon’s first taste of international pressure came earlier this year at the 4 Nations Face-Off, where he not only excelled under Jon Cooper’s system but also walked away with MVP honors. The moment crystallized what lies ahead in Milan. “Yeah, (playing in a major event with Canada) is something I’ve never experienced until the 4 Nations, just the whole country rooting for you,” he said via QMJHL on “X”. “But there’s a lot of pressure as well. I mean, for us, it’s gold or bust, which is a great feeling.”Those words reflect both his mindset and the weight of a nation. Canada doesn’t just participate in Olympic hockey—it enters as the perennial favorite. With Connor McDavid , Sidney Crosby, and emerging star Connor Bedard expected on the roster, MacKinnon’s leadership and scoring touch will be pivotal in blending experience with youthful firepower.For Team Canada, anything short of gold would be considered failure. MacKinnon acknowledges that reality but embraces it with confidence. “That’s kind of our expectations as athletes, is to be the best, and to win. So it’s exciting, and (I’m) excited to feel that pressure.”The roster will be finalized on December 31, setting the stage for the February 11–22 tournament in Milan. Fans across Canada hope this mix of generational talent will restore the nation’s dominance, last fully displayed in Sochi 2014.For MacKinnon, the Games represent more than medals—they are a chance to cement his legacy on the world stage. If he delivers as he did at the 4 Nations, Canada’s Olympic dream of gold could very well become reality.Also Read: NHL insiders suggest Penguins are preparing a fire sale while Sidney Crosby rumors continue to swirl",Nathan MacKinnon will play for Team Canada at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan.

New York Islanders lock in 2025 NHL Draft second-round pick Daniil Prokhorov with entry-level deal

New York Islanders draft pick Daniil Prokhorov stands out as a power forward with physical edge

The New York Islanders have officially added one of their most intriguing prospects to the organization. On Tuesday, the club announced the signing of forward Daniil Prokhorov to a three-year entry-level contract. Selected 42nd overall in the 2025 NHL Draft, Prokhorov had been expected to stay in Russia, but his ELC opened the door for him to move overseas sooner than anticipated.Prokhorov’s signing comes as a notable shift in his development path. Initially set to play with Dynamo Moscow in the Kontinental Hockey League on a two-year deal, the Krasnodar native is now eligible to leave for North America. By inking his ELC, the 18-year-old can join the Sarnia Sting of the Ontario Hockey League, who selected him in the second round of the 2025 CHL Import Draft.The 6-foot-6 forward brings size, strength, and scoring touch. With MHK Dynamo St. Petersburg of Russia’s top junior league (MHL), Prokhorov tallied 20 goals and seven assists for 27 points in 43 games last season. He added another eight goals in eight playoff contests, showcasing his knack for finishing in high-pressure moments.Prokhorov’s frame and style of play make him a unique asset for the Islanders’ pipeline.Weighing over 200 pounds, he thrives on physical play, creating space on the forecheck and establishing a strong net-front presence. Coaches in Russia praised his willingness to attack the dirty areas of the ice, while his playoff goal-scoring highlighted his ability to elevate his game when it matters most.Over two seasons in the MHL, he recorded 27 goals and 16 assists for 43 points. That steady production, combined with his imposing size, earned him strong draft stock and positioned him as a potential long-term power forward for New York. His decision to sign an NHL contract suggests both he and the Islanders are committed to accelerating his transition to North American hockey.By signing Prokhorov, the Islanders secured the rights to a prospect with the physical tools and scoring upside to become a future impact player. While his immediate destination, whether the OHL or AHL, remains to be determined, this contract ensures his development will now unfold under New York’s guidance.Also Read: NHL Trade Rumors: Calgary Flames and RFA forward Connor Zary expected to finalize three-year, $3.5M contract","New York Islanders lock in 2025 NHL Draft second-round pick Daniil Prokhorov with entry-level deal.

Patriots offense shaping around Stefon Diggs and Drake Maye



Patriots defense rewards K'Lavon Chaisson’s rise



The New England Patriots have released their unofficial depth chart ahead of Sunday’s season opener against the Las Vegas Raiders at Gillette Stadium. While it’s not a guaranteed snapshot of the final lineup, it offers a revealing look into how Mike Vrabel views his roster heading into his first year as head coach. With both teams coming off 4-13 seasons, this Week 1 matchup feels like a fresh start on both sidelines.The biggest highlight is Stefon Diggs being locked in as the Patriots’ top wide receiver. The veteran didn’t see preseason action, but that was more caution than concern. New England expects Diggs to be a primary target for second-year quarterback Drake Maye, who now carries the weight of leading this rebuild.In the backfield, Rhamondre Stevenson remains the lead back, with Antonio Gibson backing him up. Rookie TreVeyon Henderson enters as the No. 3 option, a role that still carries value in what could be a committee-style approach. The Patriots’ offense, long criticized for lacking explosiveness, suddenly looks deeper and more versatile than in recent years.Defensively, the most notable move comes at edge rusher, where K’Lavon Chaisson has officially surpassed Keion White on the depth chart. After an eye-opening training camp, Chaisson’s promotion signals Vrabel’s willingness to reward performance over pedigree.For a Patriots defense that has struggled to generate consistent pressure, his presence could be pivotal.The depth chart reinforces that New England remains very much in transition, but it also highlights a roster that is buying into Vrabel’s message. The Patriots know progress won’t come overnight, yet the combination of veteran leadership and emerging young talent offers reasons for optimism.With Vrabel making his Patriots coaching debut and Pete Carroll beginning a new chapter with the Raiders, Sunday’s game feels more like a tone-setter than a typical opener. For fans in Foxborough, the question is simple: can this revamped Patriots squad begin turning last year’s frustrations into meaningful steps forward?Also Read: Travis Hunter receives heartfelt fatherhood advice from Deion Sanders, who considers the Jaguars rookie “like a son”","The New England Patriots have released their unofficial depth chart ahead of Sunday’s season opener against the Las Vegas Raiders.
