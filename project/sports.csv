Why Serena Williams didn’t rush to meet Taylor Swift during the Super Bowl LIX?



Serena Williams and Taylor Swift — two of the biggest names in sports and entertainment — found their stories unexpectedly intertwined during Super Bowl 59. While the Kansas City Chiefs were locked in a rematch against the Philadelphia Eagles, with the latter emerging victorious 40-22, what unfolded off the field drew just as much attention. As Taylor Swift watched from the stands, cheering on her boyfriend Travis Kelce, Serena Williams made headlines with her presence and her heartfelt revelations in a recent Time interview.For Serena Williams, the night wasn't just about her surprise cameo in Kendrick Lamar’s halftime show. It was also a family affair — an evening she hoped would create a magical moment for her daughter, Olympia. The tennis legend had planned to approach Taylor Swift’s suite with her husband Alexis Ohanian and their daughters to get an autograph. But witnessing the emotional turmoil Swift was going through as the Chiefs trailed, she chose empathy over fandom. “I totally get it,” Williams told Time, highlighting her understanding as both a mother and a fellow athlete.“I'm such a mom. I was ready to go in here myself and be like, ‘Taylor, come get this girl,’” Williams said with a laugh, revealing just how much she had her heart set on the moment for Olympia. But with Kelce’s team facing a tough defeat, Williams decided it was best not to intrude. “It’s hard when your team is losing,” she added, echoing a sentiment any sports lover can relate to.While the game didn’t go Kelce’s way, Swift faced more than just scoreboard disappointment. When her face appeared on the jumbotron, she was met with boos — a reaction that didn’t sit right with Williams. “Why would you boo her? That’s so mean. That’s just awful,” she said, defending Swift both in the interview and later on X (formerly Twitter), where she posted, “I love you @taylorswift13 don’t listen to those booo!!”Williams’ appearance during Lamar’s performance also stirred online chatter. She was seen crip walking during the track “Not Like Us,” Lamar’s highly publicized diss at Drake — a rapper she was once rumored to have dated. However, Williams swiftly shut down any speculation. “Absolutely not,” she clarified when asked if her cameo was a jab at Drake. “I would never do that.”Beyond the Super Bowl spectacle, Williams also shared a glimpse into her private world. Having married Ohanian in 2017 and now a mother of two, she spoke about their life together. “We’re so connected, we’re so in love, we’re just, like, trying to get our daughter Taylor Swift autographs. And nothing else.”As a newly named member of Time’s Most Influential People list of 2025, Serena Williams continues to be more than just a sports icon — she’s a grounded, protective mother and a supportive friend. And when it comes to Serena Williams and Taylor Swift, their mutual respect — even from afar — is a reminder that even superstars experience life just like the rest of us.Also Read: When is the 2025 NFL schedule dropping?

Mitchell Starc's late heroics, including a crucial yorker and composed final over, forced the Super Over after Rajasthan faltered in their chase of 189.

Here's the updated IPL 2025 points table after the thriller in Delhi:

NEW DELHI: Delhi Capitals climbed back to the top of the Indian Premier League 2025 points table with a thrilling Super Over win against Rajasthan Royals at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Wednesday. This marked DC's fifth win in six matches, taking them to 10 points — two clear of second-placed Gujarat Titans (8 from 6).Meanwhile, the loss deepened RR’s woes, as they languish at eighth with just two wins in seven games.In a high-octane contest, both teams fought tooth and nail, but it was Mitchell Starc ’s late brilliance that swung the match DC’s way. Rajasthan, chasing 189, were off to a flying start with Yashasvi Jaiswal and skipper Sanju Samson adding 61 runs in just 5.3 overs. However, Samson pulled up with a rib injury after smashing a four and a six, retiring hurt in visible pain.Despite the setback, Nitish Rana and Jaiswal kept the Royals in the hunt. But as DC’s spinners tightened the screws, the equation got steeper — 73 required off the last six overs. Starc returned to dismiss the well-set Rana with a peach of a yorker, and with just 9 needed in the final over, the Aussie held his nerve to force a Super Over.Rajasthan managed 11/2 in the Super Over but two quick run-outs derailed their momentum. DC, needing 12, saw KL Rahul and Tristan Stubbs finish the job with two balls to spare, sealing a memorable win and the top spot.Delhi Capitals currently sit atop the IPL 2025 points table after six games, securing five wins and one loss to accumulate 10 points and a net run rate (NRR) of +0.744.Trailing by two points are Gujarat Titans, boasting an impressive +1.081 NRR from four wins in six fixtures (W-W-W-W-L). Third place belongs to Royal Challengers Bengaluru, also on eight points but with a slightly lower NRR of +0.672 after a 4-2 record.Punjab Kings and Lucknow Super Giants share eight points as well, occupying fourth and fifth spots respectively. While Punjab’s NRR stands at +0.172, Lucknow’s is +0.086, reflecting tight contests in their seven matches. Both sides have displayed resilience with alternating wins and losses in recent games.In mid-table, Kolkata Knight Riders have six points (3-4) and a +0.547 NRR, whereas Mumbai Indians, Rajasthan Royals, Sunrisers Hyderabad, and Chennai Super Kings sit in the lower half with four points each. They will be keen to climb the standings as the tournament progresses.Next up, Delhi Capitals face a tough test against Gujarat Titans, while Chennai Super Kings look to bounce back against Mumbai Indians. As the race for playoffs intensifies, every match and NRR will matter.","Delhi Capitals secured a thrilling Super Over victory against Rajasthan Royals.

“What did he expect?”- Yankees fire back after Juan Soto remarked on Aaron Judge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/what-did-he-expect-yankees-fire-back-after-juan-soto-remarked-on-aaron-judge/articleshow/120349456.cms,"“What did he expect?”- Yankees fire back after Juan Soto remarked on Aaron Judge (Image Source: Getty)

Juan Soto says things don't feel the same with Aaron Judge batting behind him

""It's definitely different. I had the best hitter in baseball hitting behind me.""

Yankees insider reports Juan Soto ""got what he wanted"" but lost something huge

and said, “I’m not really going to go back and forth with this. Juan Soto just needs to keep being himself. He’s going to be fine.”

The 2025 MLB season is already hot, and fans are buzzing about one major story: Juan Soto's performance with the New York Mets. Following his massive deal to sign a $765 million contract and depart the Yankees to join the Mets, everyone is looking at him. The Mets signed Juan Soto to bring offense to their team, but his start hasn't been so great. He has hit .250/.392/.467 this year, below his normal figures. That's not what fans were hoping for from one of baseball's superstars.In an interview with Mike Puma of the New York Post, Juan Soto expressed his opinions. He stated that it feels odd to no longer have Aaron Judge hitting behind him like he did when he was with the Yankees. Juan Soto explained that pitchers would be more cautious when Aaron Judge was up next, and now things are different.He stated,These were words that made headlines in a hurry, and some Yankees fans took it personally.Certain baseball analysts would assert that Juan Soto is slowly settling into the Mets, and time may just be needed. Despite his present stats being low, he still manages to get on base a lot and hit balls hard. Barely three days ago, he registered a solid homer off the Minnesota Twins. Thus, he is still a scary hitter.An anonymous individual in the Yankees' organization had a forceful response to Juan Soto's statement. He stated, ""What was he expecting? The guy wanted his money; he received it. But he surrendered a lot too."" This illustrates that some believe Juan Soto made a decision out of money, but perhaps didn't consider what he'd be losing at the Yankees, such as playing alongside Aaron Judge.Even Aaron Judge was asked about it. He stayed calmAaron Judge doesn’t seem angry, he just wants Juan Soto to focus and do well.Also Read: “It’s Definitely Different”- Mets’ Juan Soto Opens Up About Pitching Changes After He Left Yankees","Yankees insider reports Juan Soto ""got what he wanted"" but lost something huge with his move to the Mets.

Detroit Red Wings balance lineup as New Jersey Devils seek to pick up the pace heading towards playoffs



Suspension update



Having secured their playoff or offseason course, the Detroit Red Wings and New Jersey Devils approach Wednesday night's game with new lineups and several important absentees. The Devils head to the playoffs and potentially the return of star defenseman Dougie Hamilton, while the Red Wings continue to limp through a season's worth of injuries as they finish up the regular season. The faceoff is at 7:30 p.m. ET and will appear on several networks such as truTV and TNT.The out-of-playoff-hope Detroit Red Wings are using the final quarter of the season to give younger players large amounts of ice time. Jonatan Berggren has risen to the first line with Dylan Larkin and Lucas Raymond, and Patrick Kane will ride the second line with emerging rookie Marco Kasper and sniper Alex DeBrincat.Veteran Vladimir Tarasenko is added to the third line along with J.T. Compher and Michael Rasmussen and adds experience and depth. Physicality and energy are added through the fourth line, comprised of Austin Watson, Tyler Motte, and Craig Smith.

Nico Hischier is the first-line centre with Stefan Noesen and Jesper Bratt, and Dawson Mercer and Timo Meier are with veteran Erik Haula on the second line. Tomas Tatar, Justin Dowling, and Cody Glass are depth lines, and the fourth line includes Nolan Foote, Marc McLaughlin, and Nathan Bastian.The best news for New Jersey is the possible return of defenseman Dougie Hamilton from an 18-game absence with a lower-body ailment. His presence alongside Brenden Dillon on the third blue line would be a welcome addition as the Devils play their first-round playoff contest against the Carolina Hurricanes.In net, Jacob Markstrom is the probable starter, with Jake Allen as his backup. Dennis Cholowski and a few others are healthy scratches, while Ondrej Palat is officially out after getting hit in the leg during Tuesday's overtime victory over the Boston Bruins.Forward Paul Cotter will miss the second of a two-game suspension for an illegal check to the head on New York Islanders defenseman Adam Pelech.

The second baseman showed no signs of injury concerns while going 4-for-4 with two RBIs in the Reds' 8-4 win over the Seattle Mariners on April 15. Cincinnati Reds fans will be eager to see if Gavin Lux can maintain this hot streak as the team looks to build on their recent success, having won four straight games and six of their last seven to move above .500 for the first time this season.Gavin Lux's contribution to Cincinnati's win Tuesday came off the back of the returns of Matt McLain and closer Alexis Diaz, both of whom have been bolstered by the Cincinnati Reds with the returns of a number of key players from injury. After spending 10 days on the injured list, Matt McLain walked three times and scored twice in his return game. Alexis Diaz, a 2023 All-Star, made his season debut after recovering from a hamstring injury, but he walked two in the sixth inning before recording two outs.The Cincinnati Reds got an immediate impact from Austin Hays, who socked a go-ahead three-run homer and delivered four runs overall in his Cincinnati Reds debut. Austin Hays was sidelined with a calf injury that she sustained just three days before the season opener and missed the team's first 16 games, before Tuesday's triumphant return.The Seattle Mariners (8-9) battle the Cincinnati Reds (9-8) tonight at 6:40 p.m. EDT at Great American Ball Park in the second of their current series.

The game will be broadcast on local television networks and through MLB.TV for out-of-market viewers. With Gavin Lux coming off a perfect night at the plate and the Cincinnati Reds winning six of their last seven games, Cincinnati Reds supporters have plenty of reasons for optimism heading into tonight's contest.The Cincinnati Reds will continue their homestand and hope that Gavin Lux can keep up his hot hitting and help the team secure a win over the road struggling Seattle Mariners, who have yet to win away from home this season with a 0-4 record.Also Read: “He meant excellence”- Ex-basketball player Kareem Abdul-Jabbar pays tribute to MLB’s first Black player",Gavin Lux is expected to be in the Cincinnati Reds lineup tonight against the Seattle Mariners.

Patriots make bold QB move: Why Joe Milton III’s trade could be a gamble,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/patriots-make-bold-qb-move-why-joe-milton-iiis-trade-could-be-a-gamble/articleshow/120355373.cms,"Joe Milton III (via: Getty Images)

Patriots’ bold QB shift: What Milton’s trade means



HIGHLIGHTS: Joe Milton III's Best Plays vs. Buffalo Bills | NFL Week 18

The New England Patriots are making significant waves this offseason, but not all of their moves are as straightforward as they might seem. After a deeply disappointing 4-13 season, head coach Mike Vrabel is taking decisive action to overhaul the team’s roster, with a sharp and strategic focus on revitalizing the quarterback position. While much of the media attention is centered around rookie quarterback Drake Maye , who promises to be the team’s future under center, a surprising decision has raised more than a few eyebrows: the trade of the promising young QB Joe Milton III to the Dallas Cowboys.Joe Milton III showcased impressive talent during his brief appearances last season, including a notable debut in Week 18. With a cannon of an arm and raw potential, many believed he could be the future of the Patriots' quarterback room. However, the team’s decision to trade him for a fifth-round pick rather than developing him further, has many wondering if New England is betting too early on their new direction.The Patriots are putting their chips on Drake Maye, the No. 3 overall pick in 2024, and veteran Joshua Dobbs as the backup. With a revamped offensive line and new playmakers like Stefon Diggs , New England is prioritizing stability and experience under center. But is moving on from Milton too soon?Given Milton’s impressive athleticism and untapped upside, trading him now could very well be a missed opportunity for the Patriots. Teams with uncertain quarterback futures, especially those looking to rebuild, could have offered a more valuable return for Milton earlier in the offseason. By moving him so quickly, New England may have rushed the decision, potentially leaving room for regret if Milton goes on to find success as a starter elsewhere.Also Read: “I'm not Taylor Swift” - Serena Williams breaks silence on Super Bowl cameo with Kendrick Lamar The timing of the trade only adds to the uncertainty surrounding the move, raising more questions than answers. If Milton develops into a solid starter or even an elite quarterback down the line, the Patriots’ decision to trade him so soon could become a major regret. New England’s gamble on Drake Maye could certainly pay off, but only time will tell if they made the right call in letting go of a player with so much potential. For now, the Patriots are focused on the present, but the future of their quarterback situation remains anything but certain.","Joe Milton III was traded to the Dallas Cowboys for a fifth-round pick.

'I take the blame': Ajinkya Rahane after KKR's defeat to Punjab Kings

NEW DELHI: In a dramatic moment during Kolkata Knight Riders ' (KKR) Indian Premier League 2025 clash against Punjab Kings (PBKS) in Mullanpur, Sunil Narine's bat failed the official gauge test — highlighting the BCCI's recent clampdown on oversized bats during live IPL matches.The incident occurred just before KKR began their unsuccessful chase of PBKS' modest 112-run target.Also See: DC vs RR Reserve umpire Saiyed Khalid conducted random checks outside the playing area, where Narine and fellow KKR batter Angkrish Raghuvanshi stood together. While Raghuvanshi's bat passed the standard test, the thickest part of Narine's bat couldn't slide through the house-shaped gauge, violating ICC's prescribed bat size limits.Despite the bat drama, Narine had a mixed outing — claiming 2 for 14 with the ball but managing just 5 runs with the bat. Raghuvanshi top-scored for KKR with 37 off 28, yet the team crumbled from 62 for 2 to 95 all out.A second bat-related interruption came in the 16th over when Anrich Nortje was stopped by on-field umpires Mohit Krishnadas and Saidharshan Kumar. Nortje's bat also failed the gauge test, prompting substitute Rahmanullah Gurbaz to rush in with a replacement. However, the match ended before he could face a ball, as Andre Russell was dismissed immediately.These live checks mark a shift in BCCI protocol, with bat dimensions now scrutinised mid-match to prevent players from gaining illegal advantages through oversized blades. While previously done in dressing rooms, this season has seen on-field checks involving several players, including Shimron Hetmyer, Phil Salt, and Hardik Pandya.The ICC allows a maximum bat face width of 10.79 cm, blade thickness of 6.7 cm, edge width of 4 cm, and overall length of 96.4 cm.","Kolkata Knight Riders' Sunil Narine's bat failed the official gauge test.

Samson was almost on the edge of the inner circle, prompting the umpire to intervene just before Archer bowled his final delivery of the over.Then came a dramatic final over from Sandeep Sharma . The experienced pacer, who had given away just 14 runs in his first three overs, bowled an 11-ball over riddled with extras — four wides and a no-ball — and conceded 19 runs.

Monk’s absence is a significant blow, though he could return if the Kings advance.Dallas has struggled against Sacramento this season, losing all three matchups. Injuries played a role in those losses, with both Kyrie Irving and Anthony Davis getting hurt in the last two meetings.Despite the setbacks, the Mavericks have reinforcements. Dereck Lively II, Daniel Gafford, Dante Exum, Jaden Hardy, and P.J. Washington are all available after dealing with injuries late in the season. However, two-way players like Kai Jones and Kessler Edwards are ineligible for the postseason.The game tips off at 9 p.m. CST from the Golden 1 Center, with ESPN broadcasting the action. The Mavericks will need Anthony Davis at full strength to counter Sacramento’s physical play. His presence in the paint could be the difference-maker in a game where Dallas must break its losing streak against the Kings.Sacramento, meanwhile, will rely on its depth to compensate for Monk’s absence.

Chelsea Green has not been booked for the WrestleMania 41 match card despite being a popular figure in the company.Chelsea Green has become one of the most popular and captivating WWE superstars of all time. The Hot Mess is a must-see sight on Friday Night SmackDown every week. In December 2024, Green made history by becoming the first-ever WWE Women's United States Champion. Her title reign has been remarkable so far, with Green molding her character to a USA inspired figure and being protected by her Secret Service, Piper Niven and Alba Fyre.Despite her rising popularity, Chelsea Green has not been booked for a match at WrestleMania 41 which comes as a surprise to many. With the show only days away, the chances are looking even more unlikely. However, Chelsea Green would have stolen the show if given that chance, and here are three matches where she could have done that:Bayley is one of the most established names on the WWE roster today. She has claimed multiple championships, accolades and is one of the top-tier WWE superstars of the modern era. The Role Model is known to put stellar matches on big stages like WrestleMania and she could have done the same with Chelsea Green if they were booked to battle. A US title match between Bayley and Chelsea Green could have been a great addition to the WrestleMania 41 card.A legendary name who recently crossed paths with Chelsea Green on SmackDown could have been an excellent opponent for her at WrestleMania 41. That is none other than Trish Stratus. The WWE Hall of Famer had a brief segment with Chelsea Green that also involved Tiffany Stratton. Moreover, Stratus returning to compete at WrestleMania after her excellent showing at the 2025 Elimination Chamber PLE could have been a major push for Chelsea Green had the match been booked.The one opponent Chelsea Green expressed her desire to face at WrestleMania 41 was Nikki Bella . The Fearless One made her return to WWE as part of the 2025 WWE Women's Royal Rumble match and proved that she had a lot of gas left in the tank. Moreover, Green even proposed to have a 'Hair vs Hair' match against Bella to raise the stakes. Regardless of the stipulation, a major US title match between Nikki Bella and Chelsea Green would have been a marquee showdown for the WrestleMania 41 card.",Chelsea Green has become one of the most popular WWE superstars of all time.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Sometimes it comes off; a bit of luck goes a long way. It was a fantastic game, happy to get on the right side. I've played long enough for everyone to know what I'd do, but if I execute, then I know I'll get by. A bit of luck goes a long way,” said Starc at the post-match presentation.Starc also admitted he was caught slightly off guard by Rajasthan’s Super Over strategy.“(On RR's choice of batters for the Super Over) It was a bit of a surprise to see left-handers come in with my angle as the ball was tailing back in. Got one wrong there with the side line no-ball, but we had the batting depth then to chase that down,” he added.Rajasthan posted 11 runs in their Super Over, with Delhi replying confidently.

NEW DELHI: Rajasthan Royals’ Riyan Parag was at the center of a rare interruption during the IPL 2025 match against Delhi Capitals at the Arun Jaitley Stadium, as he was forced to change his bat moments before taking strike.Coming in to bat in place of the injured Sanju Samson, Parag was halted by the on-field umpire for a routine bat gauge check. The bat failed to meet the required specifications, leading to a brief but animated exchange between the batter and the official. Despite his protest, Parag had no option but to change his bat before resuming play.A video capturing the incident has gone viral on social media, showing the exact moment the bat was tested and Parag’s visible displeasure upon learning it didn’t pass.However, the change in equipment didn’t bring a change in fortune. Parag managed just 8 runs from 11 balls before being dismissed.This incident adds to a growing list of players flagged for bat regulation breaches this season. Earlier, KKR's Sunil Narine and Anrich Nortje were also made to replace their bats after similar checks by match officials.According to IPL 2025 regulations, bats must adhere to strict dimensions: a maximum width of 10.79 cm, blade thickness of up to 6.7 cm, edge thickness not exceeding 4 cm, and a total length capped at 96.4 cm.With enforcement tightening, players and franchises are being reminded that compliance with equipment standards is non-negotiable this season.The umpires are checking the bats as part of BCCI protocol which aims to prevent players from gaining unfair advantages in an era of aggressive powerhitting.The BCCI has authorised IPL match officials to inspect any bat they consider necessary during live games, marking a significant change from previous seasons where such checks were confined to dressing rooms.The ICC regulations stipulate specific bat dimensions. The bat face width must not exceed 4.25 inches (10.79 cm), while the middle of the bat thickness is limited to 2.64 inches (6.7 cm). The edge width cannot be more than 1.56 inches (4 cm), and the bat's total height from handle to base must not exceed 38 inches (96.4 cm).","Rajasthan Royals’ Riyan Parag forced to change his bat moments before taking strike.

Poll How crucial was Mitchell Starc's final over in securing the win for Delhi Capitals? Not at all crucial Not very crucial Somewhat crucial Extremely crucial

NEW DELHI: Delhi Capitals skipper Axar Patel hailed Mitchell Starc ’s clinical execution in the final over as the key factor in their nail-biting Super Over win against Rajasthan Royals at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Wednesday. In a match that went down to the wire, the Royals required just nine runs from the last over, but Starc held his nerve, giving away only eight to force the first Super Over of IPL 2025 .“I knew if Starc hit his mark, we’d be back in the contest. He delivered 12 balls straight—every single one aimed as a yorker. He’s an Australian legend, and his mindset was spot on. He only missed the mark once,” said Axar, praising the left-arm pacer.Delhi, who batted first in regulation time, chased down a 12-run target in the Super Over with remarkable ease. KL Rahul and Tristan Stubbs sealed the win in just four deliveries, with Sandeep Sharma handling the pressure over for Rajasthan.Reflecting on the team's batting, Axar admitted that Delhi fell short of expectations during the powerplay.“We should have scored more early on. KL Rahul mentioned the pitch wasn’t easy to bat on. I reminded the boys to stay positive and show intent. Sometimes, pressure makes you panic. When RR were dominating, I felt the heat. I took a strategic timeout and asked my bowlers to stick to proper line and length,” he shared.Assessing Delhi’s overall performance, Axar said the team gained momentum after a sluggish start. “All’s well that ends well. The way we began, especially in the powerplay, we could’ve done better.""During the first strategic break, our batters told us the wicket was tricky for new batters. I told them to maintain intent. Fortunately, we picked up steam around the 12th or 13th over.”","Delhi Capitals skipper Axar Patel hails Mitchell Starc's clinical execution in the final over as the key factor in their nail-biting Super Over win against Rajasthan Royals.

KL RAHUL MANIA

AXAR'S FIRST WICKET OF IPL 2025

NEW DELHI: In trouble? Call Mitchell Starc . That’s exactly what Axar Patel did when things got tense. With just 9 runs to defend in the final over, he turned to his strike bowler — and Starc delivered.Yorker after yorker, Starc kept the pressure high and the fans on edge. Dhruv Jurel and Shimron Hetmyer managed to survive the heat but couldn’t find the boundaries needed. The match ended in a thrilling tie, pushing the contest into the first Super Over of IPL 2025 .Starc returned for the Super Over, taking the ball once again with ice in his veins. Rajasthan Royals managed just 11 runs, setting Delhi Capitals a target of 12.Enter KL Rahul and Tristan Stubbs , with Sandeep Sharma bowling.Rahul started with a couple, followed it up with a crisp boundary, and handed over the strike after a single. Stubbs needed no second invitation — he launched Sandeep into the stands, sealing a dramatic win for Delhi Capitals.It was their first win at home this season, and it took them right back to the top of the table. As the players celebrated, the ‘Dilli re, Roar Macha!’ anthem echoed through the Kotla — a perfect end to a pulsating night of cricket.Tension was palpable in the Rajasthan Royals dugout. Sanju Samson wore a frustrated look behind the stumps as Sandeep Sharma — one of their most trusted bowlers at the death — lost his rhythm when it mattered the most. Tasked with bowling the final over, Sandeep’s six legal deliveries stretched into a chaotic 11-ball over: Wd 0 Wd Wd Wd N1 4 6 1 1 1 — a rare meltdown from the usually reliable pacer.Delhi Capitals finished their innings at 188/5, and the mood in their camp was upbeat. Smiles lit up their dugout, with players clearly satisfied with what looked like a competitive total.Opener Abishek Porel, who set the tone early with the bat, sounded confident in the mid-innings chat with the broadcasters.""The plan was to go hard in the powerplay which would make it easier later on. If you bowl slower, it is helpful on this wicket and hopefully our bowlers do well. A very good total on this wicket,"" he said.But Rajasthan Royals had other ideas.They came out all guns blazing, dismantling Delhi’s bowling attack from the outset. Yashasvi Jaiswal set the tone with a brisk 51, while Sanju Samson, before retiring hurt on 31, ensured the momentum stayed firmly in Rajasthan’s corner.And then came Nitish Rana, who played a stunning knock of 51 off 28 balls to give a big home but star pacer Starc pulled things back in Delhi's favour.When the match headed into a Super Over, Sandeep found himself in the spotlight once again — a chance at redemption after a forgettable final over.But pressure mounted, and history repeated itself.Sandeep struggled to hold his nerve, failing to apply any real pressure. Delhi Capitals chased down the target in just four deliveries, sealing a memorable win and leaving Sandeep with another tough outing to reflect on.""Bhaiya, plain t-shirt hai ya kissi player ke naam wali jersey?"" — a curious fan asked a t-shirt vendor stationed outside the Arun Jaitley Stadium, just an hour and a half before the Delhi Capitals vs Rajasthan Royals clash.The seller replied, ""Sirf KL Rahul ki hai."" One fan bought it. Then another. Soon, a line of eager customers formed, each asking for different sizes, as the buzz around KL Rahul gripped the scene outside the stadium.Interestingly, the jersey bore the Delhi Capitals colours, but had ""KL Rahul"" and the number 01 printed on the back — a curious sight, yet a clear sign of the mania surrounding the star batter.Inside the Kotla, it was a vibrant sea of blue and red.The atmosphere reached a crescendo when the stadium DJ dropped the ""Dilli re, Roar Macha!"" anthem — and right on cue, KL Rahul cleared his front leg to send a slot ball from Tushar Deshpande soaring over long-off. The crowd erupted.Rahul's knock was entertaining, albeit not blistering. He scored 38 runs off 32 deliveries before falling to Jofra Archer — notably, the first time Archer managed to dismiss Rahul in IPL history.And he showed his composure in the Super Over too, delivering under pressure and giving fans a treat to watch.""We perhaps got too casual in the middle phase,"" admitted Axar Patel after Delhi Capitals’ unbeaten run was halted by Mumbai Indians in their previous outing.Before the clash against Rajasthan Royals, a quick glance at Axar's IPL 2025 stats painted a worrying picture: 67 runs, 0 wickets in 5 matches — far from the impact expected from the captain and star allrounder.Trolled heavily for throwing his wicket away against Mumbai, Axar walked out to a mix of pressure and expectation. But amidst loud chants of ""Bapu! Bapu!"" echoing around the Kotla, he responded like a true leader — smashing a fiery 34 off just 14 balls, laced with four boundaries and two sixes.The crowd, however, erupted when he made an impact with the ball. Coming in just when his team needed a breakthrough, Axar cleaned up Riyan Parag for 8 — his first wicket of IPL 2025. The dismissal came at a crucial juncture, especially after Sanju Samson had to retire hurt on 31.Axar had finally delivered with both bat and ball — and the Kotla faithful made sure he knew it.","Delhi Capitals beat Rajasthan Royals in the first Super Over of IPL 2025.

Playoff Chances

After playing 7 matches, the Lucknow Super Giants find themselves in a pretty decent position — sitting right in the middle of the points table. With 4 wins from 7 games, LSG currently hold the 5th spot and are very much in the playoff race.One of the biggest positives for Lucknow this season has been Nicholas Pooran, who was retained by the franchise for a whopping amount of Rs 21 crore. He has certainly justified his price tag, smashing 357 runs at an average of 59.50 and a staggering strike rate of 208.77. Pooran has been the backbone of the LSG batting line-up.Another big plus has been Mitchell Marsh, who has given solid support to Pooran. Marsh has scored 295 runs at an average of 49.16 and a strike rate of 171.51. Impressively, he has hit four fifties this season in just six matches — a significant leap considering he had only three IPL fifties before this season.On the bowling front, uncapped player Digvesh Rathi has emerged as a bright spot. He has picked up 9 wickets at an average of 23.11 and an impressive economy of 7.42. Shardul Thakur has also chipped in with 11 wickets at an average of 24.90, though he has been slightly expensive with an economy of 10.96. He currently sits third on the Purple Cap leaderboard.Rishabh Pant, who was LSG’s most expensive signing at Rs 27 crore, has struggled to make an impact this season. He has managed just 103 runs at an average of 17.17 and a strike rate of 104 — numbers that include a scratchy 63 against CSK where he never really looked in rhythm.Apart from Pant, the rest of LSG’s middle order is yet to click. Players like David Miller and Ayush Badoni haven’t had much game time, and when they did, they couldn’t make it count.LSG have a solid shot at making it to the top four if they maintain their current form. Winning 4 out of their remaining 7 matches should be enough to secure a playoff berth. But the bigger question remains — can they go beyond that and actually lift the trophy this time?","Lucknow Super Giants currently sit in the 5th spot in the IPL points table.

Poll Do you think Sanju Samson's injury will significantly impact Rajasthan Royals' performance in IPL 2025? No, they can still perform well. Yes, it will be a major setback.

NEW DELHI: Rajasthan Royals suffered a major blow during their Indian Premier League 2025 clash against Delhi Capitals at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Wednesday as captain Sanju Samson walked off retired hurt in visible discomfort during the sixth over of their run chase.Samson, who was in terrific touch, had just hit a four and a six off the first two balls of the over bowled by DC spinner Vipraj Nigam. However, on the very next delivery — a no-ball — he attempted a fierce slash and missed. Immediately after the shot, he clutched his side and called for medical attention, indicating pain in his ribs.Despite receiving treatment and taking strike for the free-hit, Samson clearly wasn’t comfortable. He hit the ball towards long-on but didn’t attempt a run. In visible pain, the RR skipper decided to walk off after scoring 31 off 19 deliveries, laced with three sixes and two fours. He had earlier stitched a quick 61-run opening partnership with Yashasvi Jaiswal in just 5.3 overs.Earlier, Delhi Capitals posted a competitive 188/5, powered by impactful knocks from Axar Patel (34 off 14) and Tristan Stubbs (34 off 18).

'I was under pressure': SRH's Abhishek Sharma after a record 141 against Punjab Kings

MUMBAI: This match, irrespective of which team wins, should be a treat for Mumbai’s fans. Abhishek Sharma is back at the Wankhede, the venue where he smashed that fabulous 54-ball 135 against a stunned England at the Wankhede Stadium in early Feb this year.What’s more, he is fresh off an equally murderous 55-ball 141 which helped the Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) chase down Punjab Kings’ 246 with ease in Uppal. Needless to say, hosts Mumbai Indians (MI) have a massive challenge on their hands when they face SRH on Thursday night.Perhaps burdened by the weight of huge expectations since that scintillating century against England, the 24-year-old was groping for runs at the start of the IPL, getting out for scores of 24, 6, 1, 2, and 18. Then he exploded against PBKS to register the highest-ever individual score by an Indian batter in the IPL.MI will look to control the damage from Abhishek and his equally destructive opening partner Travis Head by unleashing their ace seam bowling duo, Jasprit Bumrah and Trent Boult. Both Abhishek and Head like to pounce on the new ball, but attacking Boult, who has a habit of striking in the Powerplays, and Bumrah, won’t be straight forward.Abhishek, Head and South African ’keeper bat Heinrich Klaasen form the engine room of the SRH batting lineup. But MI will also have to deal with an insider. Ishan Kishan , who was an integral part of the franchise since 2018, and was let go by MI, will be having a point to prove. And he knows the Wankhede inside out.Ishan had a stunning debut for SRH, smashing a blazing 106 not out off just 47 balls against Rajasthan Royals, but since then his form has dipped. Conversely, MI have someone in their lineup who was on the SRH rolls once: Karn Sharma Playing his first match of the season, the experienced leggie took 3/36, including the crucial wickets of the in-form KL Rahul and Tristian Stubbs, to help Mumbai pull off a heist against DC in the last match. If Karn and Kiwi left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner, whose brilliant delivery castled a well-set Karun Nair and changed the course of the last match, combine well again, MI will be difficult to beat.Two SRH bowlers who will be marked men will be Uttar Pradesh’s impressive young leg-spinner Zeshan Ansari, who has taken four wickets in four matches at 35.25 (ER 9.40), and Sri Lankan seamer Eshan Malinga. Taking 2/45 on his debut in four overs in a high-scoring match, Eshan managed to impress Lasith Malinga.The Sri Lankan fastbowling great posted on X after watching him: “Well bowled, Malinga!” MI will no doubt be rejuvenated after their comefrom-behind win against the Delhi Capitals in their last match on Sunday.","Abhishek Sharma is back at the Wankhede, the venue where he smashed that fabulous 54-ball 135 against a stunned England in early Feb this year.

How do you think success in the IPL will change your career?

Digvesh Rathi , the longhaired Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) mystery spinner , is the toast of IPL-2025, having caught everyone’s attention with his frugal spells and crucial wickets. Having been penalised twice for his extravagant ‘notebook’ celebration, Rathi hopes he can script a memorable season for himself and the franchise.Excerpts from an exclusive interview...I was a batsman initially, but there were very few opportunities. After batting, I would warm up or bowl to senior batsmen, and I learned a lot by watching Sunil Narine ’s bowling (as a net bowler for Kolkata Knight Riders in 2024). I tried those techniques in the nets and learned everything new from there.I never learned the basics. No one taught me. I didn’t do basic bowling! I liked doing ‘mystery bowling’ because it was new to the world, I enjoyed bowling and watching it. I used to bat, but when I bowled in the nets, I found great joy in beating batsmen with mystery balls. I played at a complex in Dilshad Garden (in Delhi), where a senior teammmate, Robin Bisht, told me to focus on bowling. He told me I was meant to be a bowler, not a batsman. That’s when I started. Regarding mystery bowling, if you ask anyone, they’ll likely say they don’t know much about it. Mystery spinners often discuss things among themselves. I spoke to Mujeeb ur Rehman during the Mumbai Indians match, and he thinks the same way I do. Last year, when I was a net bowler for KKR, I spoke to Varun Chakravarthy, and he thinks similarly. I believe all mystery spinners think this way.No one motivated me. Everyone said this ‘mystery’ spin wouldn’t work, that I should give it up and just do regular spin, and that I should play in the Ranji Trophy. All my coaches said I should bowl offspin, but I didn’t like off-spin at all. Cricket in Delhi is so fast-paced that if you bowl offspin, you can only bowl 2-3 overs at the most. After that, batsmen just target the offspinner and try to hit sixes, regardless of the ground size or pitch conditions.Yes, not just for me but for all the cricketers in Delhi. Many cricketers play very well, and for them, the DPL is a big platform. If they’re not able to play domestic cricket for Delhi for some reason, they can perform well in the DPL and also catch the attention of IPL franchises. I took 14 wickets in the DPL. I felt I should have taken more.It was an extremely special moment in my life. I was supposed to bowl in the Powerplay, but in that match, I didn’t get the opportunity. I had prepared a strategic setup for Narine because he bats exceptionally well. My plan was to get him out in the Powerplay, but when I didn’t get to bowl in that period, I felt it would be easier to dismiss him later, when the field was open. I really admire his bowling, although he is also a good batsman.I knew if I bowled to him the way I usually do, I would not be able to get him out. That’s why, a day before, I spent an hour on the ground with (LSG) coach Justin Langer and Vijay Dahiya sir, and I developed a new variation because I knew Priyansh would read my googly. He is a talented player. I decided one ball would move away, and another would be a googly. That’s how I got him out.I just want to keep doing what I’m doing. I love learning new things. I enjoy living in the moment. I don’t even like watching past matches. I don’t look back or find watching my own bowling appealing. I don’t enjoy social media. I just want to perform well for my team.",Digvesh Rathi is the toast of IPL-2025 with his frugal spells and crucial wickets. Rathi was penalised twice for his extravagant ‘notebook’ celebration.

Hardik Pandya-led Mumbai Indians (MI) will lock horns against Pat Cummins' Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in Match No 33 of the Indian Premier League (IPL) at the iconic Wankhede Stadium on Thursday.Both the teams will be looking to improve their position in the tournament after securing just two wins each from six matches in this tournament so far.Mumbai Indians have found some positives in Suryakumar Yadav and Tilak Varma's recent performances, during their thrilling win against Delhi Capitals. Naman Dhir has also impressed with his lower-order batting and fielding abilities.Nearing the halfway mark, the Sunrisers are also struggling to find their range, tottering at ninth on the table with only net run rate separating the two teams after four losses and two wins in six matches each. MI has a NRR of +0.10 while SRH's run-rate stands at -1.24.But MI will have to be wary of SRH's batters who have given signs of finding back their mojo after a lull.Each of the top four - Head, Abhishek, Klaasen and Kishan - fired on all cylinders to stun Punjab Kings to give SRH their second win of the season.

MUMBAI: The BCCI ’s decision to carry out on-field inspections of bats has become a major talking point. The initiative commenced on Sunday with checks during the RR vs RCB and DC vs MI matches. Pictures of MI skipper Hardik Pandya’s bat undergoing a check went viral.However, on Tuesday, KKR players Sunil Narine and Anrich Nortje became the first to fail the gauge test. Reserve umpire Saiyed Khalid found Narine’s bat oversized before their chase against PBKS. A video shows Narine with Angkrish Raghuvanshi near the dugout during inspection, where Raghuvanshi’s bat passed through the gauge but Narine’s didn’t.Forced to change his bat, a distracted Narine was dismissed for five runs by Marco Jansen. Similarly, debutant Nortje’s bat too failed the gauge test. However, he remained at the non-striker’s end and didn’t take strike. SRH head coach Daniel Vettori downplayed the situation on Wednesday at the Wankhede Stadium, noting regular bat compliance checks occur in dressing rooms.“I wish they’d checked the bats when I was playing,” he joked. “The umpires go through the dressing rooms a lot of the time, so guys know that their bats are compliant. It’ll reset anyone trying to have a bigger bat, but it’s pretty easy to get your bat through that cage.” He acknowledged bat evolution as natural progression, citing manufacturers’ ability to create larger yet lightweight bats. Will bat sizes be reduced in the future to give bowlers more of a chance in the game? “I mean, everyone seems to enjoy sixes and fours.I don’t think we’re going to get a reduction in bat size and it doesn’t really worry me,” Vettori stated. However, Paras Anand, CEO of Meerut-based Sanspareils Greenlands (SG), a wellknown bat manufacturer, feels that the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), the custodians of the laws of the game, and the ICC must look at other areas to restore balance.“Modern-day players practise hitting sixes. Cricket is not what it was 15 years ago. There are other ways of achieving balance between bat and ball, like churning out sporting pitches, using a ball that swings a bit more, or increasing the size of the boundaries. A 1 mm or 2 mm increase in the size of the bats won’t make a difference,” Anand told TOI.Current IPL rules state: “The blade of the bat must not exceed the following dimensions: width 4.25 in or 10.8 cm, depth 2.64 in or 6.7 cm, edge 1.56 in or 4 cm. Moreover, it must be able to pass through a bat gauge.”",KKR's Sunil Narine and Anrich Nortje fail the 'gauge test' during their match against Punjab Kings.

NEW DELHI: Tristan Stubbs starred in a pulsating Super Over win for Delhi Capitals against Rajasthan Royals , hitting a six that sealed the issue after having contributed an 18-ball 34 not out down the order that helped the Capitals put up a fighting total.Stubbs’ maximum came as heartbreak for the Royals, who at one point looked to be in total command of the 189-ball chase. Stubbs’ star turn was one among many for the Capitals, starting with Abhishek Porel, who again showcased his versatility. A natural strokeplayer, Porel blended elegance, aggression, and situational awareness to notch up a sprightly 49 (off 37b; 4x5, 1x6).Thereafter, KL Rahul (38 off 32b), Axar Patel (34 off 14b), Stubbs and Ashutosh Sharma (15* off 11b) made telling contributions as Delhi Capitals posted 188/5. The Royals, though, appeared to have it all under control at one stage during the chase. Nitish Rana (51 off 28b; 6x4, 2x6) brought his ‘A’ game, playing a captivating innings full of aggression. His knock was pivotal in maintaining the momentum after Yashasvi Jaiswal (51 off 37b; 3x4, 4x6) and Sanju Samson (31 retd. off 19b) got RR off to a rocking start.Towards the end, Dhruv Jurel (26 off 17b) and Shimron Hetmyer (15* off 9b) nearly got RR over the line. But DC speedster Mitchell Starc bowled an incredible final over, nailing his yorkers with precision. RR required nine from the final over to win, but the Jurel-Hetmyer duo managed to get only eight.As the match went into a Super Over, the first of this season, Starc once again showed his impressive death-bowling skills as RR put 11 on the board. Chasing 12, KL Rahul and Stubbs walked out for DC, with Sandeep Sharma bowling for Rajasthan. Rahul carved a boundary, and Stubbs smacked the winning six high into the stands over midwicket off the fourth delivery.Earlier, DC opener Porel smashed Tushar Deshpande for 23 runs in the second over. A graceful pick-up whip that saw the ball soar deep into the stands at deep backward square leg was the highlight. As Deshpande delivered it full on the pads, Porel just waited before effortlessly flicking it over the ropes for six.But back-to-back wickets of Jake Fraser-McGurk and Karun Nair saw Porel tone down his belligerent self. While FraserMcGurk fell to the pace and bounce of Jofra Archer, Nair was run out after a horrible mix-up between him and Porel. Rahul’s stint at the crease was sedate and nothing out of the ordinary.He mostly preferred to milk the bowling rather than go for aggressive options. The 63-run partnership between him and Porel took 9.3 overs. Rahul holed out to deep midwicket off Archer’s bowling, and soon Porel miscued one from Wanindu Hasaranga. But skipper Axar Patel injected some much-needed momentum to the DC innings. He first got hold of Hasaranga for a 19-run over in the 16th, and then collected 16 runs off the next one (17th) bowled by Maheesh Theekshana.","Tristan Stubbs hits winning six as Delhi Capitals beat Rajasthan Royals.
