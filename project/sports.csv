While injuries are common late in the season, his absence does not appear to be health-related. Knicks head coach Tom Thibodeau addressed the situation before the team’s game against the Golden State Warriors, confirming that Towns would not be available but offering no timetable for his return.“When he’s ready to come back, obviously we want him back,” Thibodeau told reporters, per SNY’s Ian Begley. “But he needs some time right now.”Despite his absence, Towns’ father was seen courtside during the Knicks' 114-102 loss to the Warriors, adding intrigue to the situation.

When and where to watch LaMelo Ball play tonight against the Cleveland Cavaliers (March 7, 2025)?

As the Charlotte Hornets prepare to face the Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday, March 7, 2025, at the Spectrum Center, all eyes are on LaMelo Ball’s injury status. The Hornets’ star point guard is listed as probable due to illness, raising questions about his availability for the game. LaMelo Ball ’s availability tonight faces uncertainty as he is listed as GTD on the team’s injury report. The Charlotte Hornets, struggling with a 14-47 record, are already dealing with a lengthy injury report. Brandon Miller, Tre Mann, and Grant Williams are out for the season, while key players like Mark Williams and Josh Okogie remain sidelined. Ball’s potential absence would further deplete a roster already missing significant firepower.Ball, who leads the team with 26.2 points per game, has been a bright spot in an otherwise challenging season for Charlotte. His ability to create plays and knock down three-pointers (averaging 3.9 per game) has been crucial. However, his illness adds uncertainty to the Hornets’ chances against the league-leading Cavaliers, who boast a 52-10 record and a fully healthy roster.The Cleveland Cavaliers , on the other hand, enter the matchup in peak form. Donovan Mitchell, averaging 24.4 points per game, headlines a squad that leads the NBA in scoring (123.1 points per game) and three-point shooting (39.3%). Their dominance on both ends of the floor makes them heavy favorites, especially against an injury-riddled Charlotte Hornets team.For Charlotte, Miles Bridges has stepped up in recent games, averaging 22.6 points and 8.4 rebounds over the last 20 contests. However, without Ball at full strength, the Hornets face an uphill battle against Cleveland’s suffocating defense and high-powered offense.Fans can catch the game live at 7 p.m. ET on FDSSE and FDSOH or stream it on Fubo. While the Cavaliers aim to extend their winning streak, the Charlotte Hornets hope Ball’s probable status turns into a green light, giving them a fighting chance in front of their home crowd.Also read: Will Donovan Mitchell play tonight against the Charlotte Hornets?

When and where to watch Nikola Jokic play tonight against the Phoenix Suns (March 7, 2025)?

The Denver Nuggets are facing potential setbacks as they prepare to host the Phoenix Suns on Friday, March 7, at Ball Arena. The team’s injury report lists five players, including reigning MVP Nikola Jokic, who is questionable with an ankle injury. Jokic’s availability remains uncertain, casting a shadow over the Nuggets’ chances in this critical Western Conference matchup. Nikola Jokic ’s availability faces uncertainty as he is listed as GTD in the team’s injury report. Jokic, the Denver Nuggets’ leading scorer and rebounder, has been instrumental in Denver’s success this season, averaging 28.8 points, 12.8 rebounds, and 11.3 assists per game. His absence would be a significant blow to the team, which currently holds a 40-22 record and sits third in the NBA in scoring (121 points per game).Alongside Jokic, forward Aaron Gordon is also questionable with an ankle issue, while Julian Strawther (knee) and DaRon Holmes (Achilles) are ruled out. Zeke Nnaji, however, is probable with an ankle injury. The Nuggets’ depth will be tested if Jokic and Gordon are sidelined, especially against a Suns team looking to climb the standings.The Suns, led by Devin Booker and Kevin Durant, have their own injury concerns. Bradley Beal is questionable with a calf strain, and Cody Martin is out with an abdominal injury. Despite their 29-33 record, the Suns remain dangerous, ranking eighth in three-pointers made per game (14.2) and fourth in three-point percentage (37.8%).Jokic’s potential absence could shift the dynamics of the game. Denver’s offense heavily relies on his playmaking and scoring, and his defensive presence on the boards is unmatched. Without him, the Denver Nuggets would need Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Jr. to step up significantly.Fans can catch the game live on ESPN, ALT, and AZFamily, or stream it on Fubo.

Charles Barkley predicts the Eastern Conference Finals winner



As the 2024-25 NBA season winds down, the playoff picture is taking shape, with the race for the championship heating up. While many eyes remain fixated on the Los Angeles Lakers and Golden State Warriors following their blockbuster trade deadline acquisitions of Luka Doncic and Jimmy Butler, TNT analyst Charles Barkley has made it clear that the real story lies elsewhere, specifically inDuring a recent segment on Inside the NBA, Charles Barkley made a bold prediction regarding the Cleveland Cavaliers, who currently hold the best record in the Eastern Conference. The NBA Hall of Famer did not hold back as he declared them the favorites to win the conference and advance to the NBA Finals.""Man, the Cleveland Cavaliers are going to the finals,"" Barkley said. ""The Celtics, that's going to be a great series if they play the Celtics. But right now, I'm telling y'all, and I told you to book it last week. The Cleveland Cavaliers are going to the NBA Finals.""The Cavaliers' dominance this season has been undeniable. As the only team in the NBA with three All-Stars— Donovan Mitchell, Evan Mobley, and Darius Garland— Cleveland has emerged as an offensive powerhouse. They are averaging a league-best 123.1 points per game. Their defense, anchored by Mobley and Jarrett Allen, has been just as formidable. Their playoff spot is already secured.However, while the Cavaliers and the Oklahoma City Thunder— who currently lead the Western Conference— continue their dominant seasons, Barkley took issue with the lack of media coverage they are receiving compared to the Lakers and Warriors. He directly called out ESPN for its fixation on the two storied franchises, arguing that smaller-market teams are being unfairly overlooked.""The Lakers are doing great,"" Barkley said. ""Got a long way to go. But the reason the season's been going great is the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Oklahoma City Thunder. Y'all just want to talk about the Warriors and the Lakers. They're both doing great, don't get me wrong. If I turn out to be wrong, I got no problem with that. But y'all are idiots cause y'all talk about the Lakers and the Warriors all the time.""Barkley further asserted that the league’s best teams deserve more attention than they’re getting.""The Cleveland Cavaliers have won 12 straight games,"" he continued. ""Oklahoma City got the MVP and they are on fire. Y'all are talking about who's in second place.

The Los Angeles Lakers are making strategic moves as they gear up for the playoffs, with reports indicating that Jordan Goodwin ’s two-way contract will soon be converted into a standard NBA deal. This decision comes as the team continues its impressive run, winning seven straight games and 18 of their last 21. To make room for Goodwin, the Lakers are likely to waive either Cam Reddish or Alex Len, with Reddish being the more probable candidate.Jordan Goodwin, a 26-year-old guard, has quickly become a valuable asset for the Los Angeles Lakers since joining the team in early February. Over eight games, he has averaged 6.1 points, 3.8 rebounds, and 1.0 assist in 16.9 minutes per game. Despite a recent right ankle sprain slowing his momentum, Goodwin’s contributions have not gone unnoticed. Head coach JJ Redick has repeatedly praised him, calling him a key rotation player.According to The Athletic’s Jovan Buha, the Los Angeles Lakers are expected to convert Goodwin’s contract as late as possible to maximize financial flexibility. ""I do expect him to be converted at the end of the season as late as possible, and then be on the playoff roster. ... He's kind of become the 9th man, and you could argue that depending on the night and depending on the matchup, he should be like the 8th man,"" Buha said on his podcast . He also hinted at a potential multi-year deal for Goodwin in the future, stating, ""I think he's going to get a multi-year contract, longer-term later in the season.""Jordan Goodwin’s journey to the Lakers began after they waived Armel Traore to open a roster spot. A four-year NBA veteran, he has previously played for Washington, Phoenix, and Memphis, holding career averages of 6.4 points, 3.8 rebounds, and 2.6 assists across 128 games. His versatility and defensive prowess have made him a reliable option off the bench.Also read: NBA Buyout Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers could bag $33 million ex-Toronton Raptors star to bolster squad's defensive end As the Los Angeles Lakers continue their push for playoff success, the decision to convert Jordan Goodwin’s contract reflects their commitment to strengthening their roster.

The Tragic Tale of The Thing in Marvel Rivals (a.k.a. The Lonely Tank)

“The Thing is extremely useless if your team doesn’t push with you.”

“Playing

The Thing

without backup feels like being the only sober person at a party—you're trying to keep things under control while everyone else is just vibing.”

“Bro, I once charged in as The Thing, thinking my team had my back. Turns out they were all chasing one low-health Spider-Man across the map. I died faster than Quicksilver in Age of Ultron.”

“The worst is when a dps keeps calling for a second healer, but refuses to switch themself. And then also refuses to leave spawn until someone else does switch lol; I'll never forget that stupid Bucky...”

“Honestly, just ignore it and play on. If they want a second healer, they can damn well play it themselves. If they afk, report them and get them banned. You may lose the battle, but you win the war.”

The Solo Tank Blues in Marvel Rivals

inmarvelrivals

“Every tank is shit if your team won't push with you.”

“The thing is a bad solo tank. His kit is just not built for it. If I'm playing a 250/275 health DPS or support I don't have the same health pool as a resource that Thing does so pushing up for me just opens me up to getting insta killed by a hela or Hawkeye, or pulled by a bucky, or combo'd by a magik.”

“My Mantis teammate was out here throwing hands instead of healing me. Girl, you’re not Gamora!”

The Comedy of Errors

“I watched our Hulk charge straight into enemy territory… only to miss everyone and slam into a wall. Meanwhile, I’m The Thing getting melted because no one followed up.”

“as a thing main, the amount of pain I have when I push up into a 3v1 with my dash expecting support only to have no one to jump to when I realize no one followed is crazy”

“Our Doctor Strange kept teleporting himself into danger and then blaming us for not saving him. Sir, you’re supposed to be the Sorcerer Supreme, not the Supreme Liability.”

It’s Clobberin’ Time (If Your Team Shows Up)

Ah, Marvel Rivals . The game where you get to live out your superhero fantasies… until your teammates remind you that even the Avengers had bad days. Over on Reddit, one poor soul vented their frustrations about playing as The Thing , only to discover that their team was less ""Fantastic Four"" and more ""Mediocre Three."" Naturally, this sparked a tidal wave of hilarious, relatable, and downright salty comments from players who’ve been through the same pain. Let’s break it down and laugh (or cry) together.The original post is basically a love letter to frustration:Imagine being a literal rock monster, ready to charge into battle, only to turn around and see your teammates… nowhere. They’re either farming kills in the corner or standing still like they’re admiring the graphics.One commenter summed it up perfectly:Another player chimed in with:Ouch.A recurring theme in the comments is how players treat team composition like an optional side quest. Tanks? Nah. Healers? Who needs ’em? It’s all DPS all the time, baby! One player hilariously vented:Another added:Honestly, they’re not wrong. Playing Marvel Rivals without a balanced team is like trying to assemble IKEA furniture without instructions—it’s possible, but you’re gonna regret it.Being the only tank on your team is basically signing up for heartbreak. One commenter shared their pain:Another player painted an even sadder picture:And let’s not forget those moments when your healer decides they’d rather play DPS too.Honestly, we need a support group for solo tanks.Of course, no Marvel Rivals match would be complete without some truly baffling teammate behavior. One player shared this gem:Another classic tale:And then there’s this masterpiece:At its core, this Reddit thread is a love-hate letter to Marvel Rivals—a game where teamwork is supposed to be everything… but sometimes feels like an afterthought. Playing as The Thing (or any tank) without support is like being Thor without Mjolnir—it just doesn’t work.But despite all the chaos and frustration, there’s something comforting about knowing we’re all in this together. Whether you’re the tank screaming for backup or the DPS who accidentally left their healer behind (we see you), these moments are what make Marvel Rivals both infuriating and unforgettable.So next time you queue up as The Thing and your team abandons you mid-push?

Bill Simmons Opens Up on Why Tom Brady’s Raiders Ownership Could Spell Trouble



Bleakest NFL Teams, QB Draft Drama, and Sunny Washington Times | The Bill Simmons Podcast

Amid the process of NFL picking, the Los Angeles Raiders are making preparations to be in an important place: Green Bay and steer the ship by none other than Tom Brady. This ""seven-time"" world-beater will be the major factor in securing a good franchise quarterback to the club. An enthusiast for Brady like Bill Simmons gets excited by all this, but even he is concerned about Brady's role in the franchise.The Las Vegas Raiders' decision to bring Tom Brady on board as a minority owner has sparked immense excitement among fans. The move, approved by the league in October 2024, not only connects the franchise to a seven-time Super Bowl champion but also fuels speculation about Brady’s potential influence in shaping the team’s future—especially when it comes to finding their next franchise quarterback. However, while many are thrilled about his involvement, not everyone is convinced that Brady’s greatness on the field will translate to success in the front office.Media personality and longtime New England Patriots fan Bill Simmons has raised concerns about Brady’s ability to evaluate quarterbacks. As reported by Awful Announcing, Simmons addressed the topic on The Bill Simmons Podcast, pointing out that legendary players don’t always make great decision-makers.“This is a dangerous thing where you have him running a football team thinking he knows what’s best with quarterbacks because he was a great quarterback,” Simmons remarked. He further emphasized that history has shown how former elite players often struggle in management roles. “Because all of the evidence with the great players we’ve had, name the sport, mostly they’re not good at this. They think they’re seeing things that other people don’t see, and it’s not actually rational.”Simmons’ concerns stem from a common issue in professional sports: the assumption that elite players naturally excel at talent evaluation. Many former greats have struggled when transitioning to front-office roles, with John Elway’s tenure as the Denver Broncos’ general manager serving as a prime example.One of the biggest questions surrounding Brady’s involvement with the Raiders is how much influence he will have on their quarterback selection in the 2025 NFL Draft. With Las Vegas potentially looking for a long-term solution at the position, having Brady’s input might seem like a huge advantage. However, Simmons argues that his presence in the decision-making room could create complications.“I’m just saying it’s not a slam dunk. Part of the problem is if you and I are in that room with Tom Brady and we were like, ‘yo man, we think Darnold, look…’ and he’s like, ‘I’m out. I watched that game and he doesn’t have it, I’m out,’” Simmons said. “Are we gonna argue with Tom Brady? It’s just now — it’s this one voice that sees what he wants to see.”This raises a critical point: Will Brady’s opinions be too influential, even if they aren’t always correct? His unmatched playing experience could give him valuable insight, but it also comes with the risk of bias—seeing the game through the lens of his own greatness rather than an objective evaluator.Brady’s presence in the Raiders’ ownership group guarantees that all eyes will be on the team’s quarterback decisions moving forward. His involvement could be a game-changer if he successfully helps the franchise land its next star signal-caller. But as Simmons pointed out, history suggests that not all legendary players thrive in this kind of role.Also Read: Kelly Stafford might have accidentally revealed Matthew Stafford’s remaining years in the NFL While some may take pleasure in seeing if Brady struggles in his new position, the NFL will ultimately determine whether his transition from the field to the front office is a success.

Ravindra Jadeja: Experienced, explores turn

Kuldeep Yadav: Variety of left-arm unorthodox

Varun Chakravarthy: Enigmatic mystery spinner

NEW DELHI: India's spin bowling arsenal has long been a cornerstone of its cricketing dominance. The ongoing ICC Champions Trophy has ensured the tradition carries on with the spin quartet of Axar Patel Kuldeep Yadav and Varun Chakravarthy being instrumental in India's journey to the final.Each brings a distinct style and skill set, collectively weaving a web that has trapped opposition batsmen and propelled India in the tournament. Whether it's controlling the opposition's scoring or picking up crucial wickets, the Indian spin quartet has proven itself to be a formidable force.Their performances have not only highlighted individual brilliance but also underscored the importance of strategic variety in a bowling attack.Axar Patel's bowling is characterized by relentless accuracy and subtle variations. As a left-arm orthodox, he maintains a tight line and length, making it challenging for batsmen to score freely. He is skipper Rohit Sharma 's go-to spinner in the first ten Powerplay overs, offering control and precision. His ability to extract bounce, even on placid surfaces, adds an extra dimension to his bowling.In the Champions Trophy, Axar's performances have been instrumental in India's success. In the group stage match against Bangladesh, he showcased his wicket-taking ability by dismissing two key batsmen in the Powerplay.His economy rate (4.51) in the tournament has been exemplary - the best among the four Indian spinners - often stifling the opposition's run flow and inducing false shots.In comparison with Axar, Jadeja is more orthodox with his left-arm spin. He brings a wealth of experience to the team, having played in numerous ICC tournaments. Jadeja's bowling is characterized by his ability to read the game situation and adjust his strategy accordingly. He can bowl with varying speeds and trajectories, explore turn from the wicket, and also has the ability to skid the ball off the surface - thus making him a constant threat.In the semifinal against Australia, Jadeja's bowling was pivotal. He broke two crucial partnerships, preventing Australian batsmen from accelerating during the middle overs. First, he dismissed Marnus Labuschagne leg-before to break the threatening partnership involving Steve Smith and then had the better of the in-form Josh Inglis.Jadeja has been pivotal in controlling the middle-overs, often bowling in tandem with Axar to strangle the opposition's scoring.Kuldeep Yadav offers a rare skill in modern cricket - a left-arm wrist spinner. His deliveries are characterized by significant turn and deceptive flight, often bamboozling the batsmen. Kuldeep's ability to spin the ball both ways without a discernible change in action makes him a potent weapon.Kuldeep also adds a dimension of unpredictability to India's bowling. His ability to pick up wickets in clusters has been crucial in breaking partnerships and shifting the momentum of the game in India's favor.During the group match against arch-rivals Pakistan, Kuldeep's spell was a masterclass in wrist spin. He claimed three wickets with his variations, dismantling the Pakistani middle-order and restricting them to a modest total.The wickets of Salman Agha and Shaheen Shah Afridi with well-disguised googlies were a treat to watch, catching both batsmen off guard. His bowling style is unique, making him a wicket-taking option even if the pitch doesn't offer much spin.Varun Chakravarthy's rise in international cricket has been nothing short of remarkable. Dubbed the 'mystery spinner' due to his unconventional grip and a repertoire of deliveries, including the carrom ball, googly, arm ball, and flipper, he adds an element of unpredictability to India's spin attack.His bowling style is difficult to read, as he can turn the ball both ways with varying speeds, making it hard for batsmen to anticipate his deliveries.In his Champions Trophy debut against New Zealand, Varun delivered a match-winning performance, claiming a five-wicket haul and leading India to a 44-run victory. Varun's inclusion in the playing XI after India's first two matches added a fresh dimension to the spin attack.The quartet offers a range of spin options, from orthodox left-arm spin to leg-spin and mystery spin. As a pack, they are adept at both controlling the run-rate and picking up wickets. While Axar and Jadeja provide control, Kuldeep and Varun are more aggressive, looking to take wickets.As India prepares to face New Zealand in the Champions Trophy final , the role of the four spinners will once again be under the spotlight.","Axar Patel, Ravindra Jadeja, Kuldeep Yadav and Varun Chakravarthy have been instrumental in India's journey to the Champions Trophy final. Each brings a distinct style and skill set, collectively weaving a web that has propelled India in the tournament.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118797259,imgsize-81726,width-400,resizemode-4/118797259.jpg"

These odds reflect the Bucks’ recent form and home-court advantage, but the Magic’s defensive prowess could make things interesting.As for the prediction, the Bucks’ offensive firepower and home advantage make them the likely winners. However, the Magic’s defense could keep the game closer than expected. If Orlando can limit Milwaukee’s three-point shooting and Wagner delivers a big performance, an upset isn’t out of the question.The Milwaukee Bucks, led by the dynamic duo of Giannis Antetokounmpo and Damian Lillard, have been in stellar form. Antetokounmpo is averaging an impressive 30.8 points per game, while Lillard adds 25.5 points, making them one of the most formidable offensive tandems in the league. The Bucks also boast the second-best three-point shooting percentage in the NBA, which could be a key factor in this game.

Franz Wagner has been their standout performer, averaging 24.9 points per game. However, the Magic’s offense has been inconsistent, and they will need to step up significantly to challenge the Bucks.

World No. 2 Alexander Zverev , who suffered a defeat against Tallon Griekspoor in his Indian Wells opener, admitted that his ""terrible"" performance has pushed any thoughts of overtaking Jannik Sinner in the rankings out of his mind.Zverev entered the prestigious ATP Masters event in the California desert as the top seed, taking advantage of world No. 1 Sinner’s belated three-month suspension for a doping violation.Having finished as the runner-up to Sinner at the Australian Open, Zverev initially saw an opportunity to claim the top spot. However, with his current struggles on the court, that ambition is quickly fading.""Now it's less, because I'm just playing terrible,"" said Zverev, who made early exits at Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro and Acapulco before his disastrous Indian Wells showing.He became the first men's top seed at Indian Wells to crash out in the opening round since Andy Murray in 2017.""I have to find my game before thinking about that, because to become world number one you have to win tournaments,"" Zverev said.""I'm not past getting first, second round at the moment. So I need to figure that out first.""Zverev admitted he had no clear explanation for his dip in form since the Australian Open.Before the tournament, he had cited illness during two of the three weeks of his ""rough South American swing"" as a possible factor.However, after his 4-6, 7-6 (7/5), 7-6 (7/4) loss to 43rd-ranked Griekspoor—who had been defeated in six of their previous seven meetings—Zverev conceded that he was simply not playing well enough.""I'm not playing a level that I want to play, definitely not playing anywhere near what I played in Australia,"" he said.After taking the first set against Griekspoor, Zverev staged a comeback from 2-5 down in the second to lead 6-5, only to be broken while serving for the match.In the third set, he saved five match points in the 12th game and converted his fifth break point to push the contest into a decisive tiebreak. However, he could not hold off Griekspoor any longer, ultimately falling short.""He played a good match,"" Zverev said. ""There's no question about that. But I have to look at myself a little bit.""""It's everything,"" he said. ""I keep working, but right now it's not clicking.""",World No. 2 Alexander Zverev loses to Tallon Griekspoor in the first round of the Indian Wells Masters. He is the first men's top seed to lose in the opening round since Andy Murray in 2017. The German admits he is not playing at a level he wants to play.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118797150,imgsize-26982,width-400,resizemode-4/118797150.jpg"

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Christian McCaffrey's Wife Olivia Culpo Faces Scary Fire Incident at Her Rhode Island Barn



A peaceful day at the barn quickly turned into a nightmare for Olivia Culpo, the wife of NFL star Christian McCaffrey . While visiting her family home in Rhode Island, Culpo found herself in the middle of a frightening fire incident that required the immediate intervention of the local fire department. What started as a routine visit to check on the barn and its animals soon escalated into an emergency.Culpo began her day with a visit to the barn, where she shared an update about the rescued cats her mother had taken in. She mentioned there were eight of them, although only a few were visible in the photos she posted. Curiously, the cats were seen lounging around with a large rat beside them, seemingly indifferent to its presence—an amusing deviation from the classic cat-and-mouse dynamic.Among the barn's residents, one cat stood out—George. Culpo introduced George as a ""failed barn cat"" but also as her favorite, despite his apparent habit of ""barking orders."" She went a step further in her playful commentary by declaring, ""George is the real King of the Castle,"" humorously bestowing him the royal title of ""George I, the King of Rhode Island.""However, the lighthearted moments were short-lived. Soon after, Culpo found herself in an alarming situation as a fire broke out at the barn. Initially, she shared a post with a seemingly controlled scene, where water hoses were being used to douse the flames. She captioned it, ""Truly never a dull moment on the farm!!!!!""But the severity of the situation became apparent when she later posted an image showing thick smoke engulfing the entire area. Flames had spread rapidly, and the once-calm farm was now at serious risk. Despite the alarming visuals, Culpo reassured her followers with the message, ""Everything ended up ok."" However, the images told a more dramatic story.Fortunately, the quick response of the South Kingstown fire department ensured that the fire was contained before causing further damage. In her final update, Culpo expressed her gratitude, saying, ""Thanks to the amazing fire department,"" as she shared a photo of two firetrucks parked outside the barn.Had it not been for the prompt action of the firefighters, the situation could have escalated into a devastating disaster. The incident likely brought back memories of another fire-related scare that Culpo had previously encountered in Los Angeles. This time, though, with the help of the first responders, the outcome was much less catastrophic.Also Read: ""Trump Loves Fisherman"": Jordon Hudson’s political allegiance becomes clear as Bill Belichick’s girlfriend celebrates a big win Thanks to the brave firefighters, Culpo’s barn was saved, and she could breathe a sigh of relief—though it’s safe to say that this is one farm visit she won’t forget anytime soon.","Olivia Culpo, wife of NFL star Christian McCaffrey, was visiting her family home in Rhode Island.

Google Gemini predicts a close clash with India having an edge

Predicting the

India vs New Zealand Champions Trophy 2025

final is tough! Both teams are strong, but India has the edge. Their batting lineup is deeper and more explosive, with Kohli, Rohit, and Rahul all capable of match-winning performances. If India's bowlers can maintain discipline, they have a high chance of lifting the trophy. Ultimately, I predict India will emerge victorious.

Score: India 1 - New Zealand 0

OpenAI's ChatGPT says “India”

India is favored to win the 2025 Champions Trophy final against New Zealand, aiming for a record third title. Their dominance in Dubai, with an unblemished record and a prior victory over New Zealand, underscores their strength. Key players like Virat Kohli and Shreyas Iyer have been instrumental in their success.

However, New Zealand's resilience in ICC tournaments is noteworthy; they've reached five global event finals in the past decade, clinching the 2021 World Test Championship. Their balanced squad, featuring in-form players like Kane Williamson and Rachin Ravindra, poses a significant challenge.

While India's comprehensive team and familiarity with Dubai conditions provide an edge, New Zealand's adaptability and tactical acumen could lead to an upset. The final promises a competitive clash between two formidable sides.

Score: India 2 - New Zealand 0

DeepSeek says predicting winner is speculative

India boasts a star-studded batting lineup (e.g., Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli) and versatile bowlers like Bumrah, thriving in high-pressure games.

*New Zealand, known for tactical brilliance and adaptability (e.g., Kane Williamson, Trent Boult), excels in crunch moments. India’s recent dominance in ICC events and home-like subcontinental conditions (if hosted in Asia) may tilt the balance. However, New Zealand’s calmness in finals and balanced attack could counter.

**Key factors*: toss, pitch conditions, and handling pressure. A close contest, but India’s firepower and experience might edge it, though NZ’s resilience ensures unpredictability.

Score: India 3 - New Zealand 1 (Awarding 1 point for each team)

Microsoft Copilot: India to win in high stakes match

India is favored to win the Champions Trophy 2025 final against New Zealand due to their consistent performance and strong lineup. India has been unbeaten in the tournament, showcasing a balanced squad with world-class batters like Virat Kohli and Shubman Gill, and a potent bowling attack led by Mohammed Shami. New Zealand, while formidable, has struggled against India in the past, especially in Asian conditions. India's experience and adaptability give them the edge in this high-stakes match.

Score: India 4 - New Zealand 1

Anthropic's Claude: India favourites to lift the trophy

India is poised to win the Champions Trophy 2025 final against New Zealand. Their batting lineup, featuring Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, and Shubman Gill, provides formidable depth and experience. India's bowling attack, led by Jasprit Bumrah with support from Mohammed Siraj and spinners Kuldeep Yadav and Ravindra Jadeja, offers versatility for all conditions.

While New Zealand is always competitive with players like Kane Williamson and Trent Boult, India's recent dominance in ICC tournaments, home advantage if played in the subcontinent, and better adaptation to pressure situations give them the edge. India's comprehensive skills across departments make them favorites to lift the trophy.

Score: India 5 - New Zealand 1

continuing as Test captain, Bumrah is seen as the frontrunner to lead the side if the selectors don't go for a younger captain, given the pacer's fitness concerns

England Tests

?

NEW DELHI: Jasprit Bumrah 's return to competitive cricket may take a while longer. TOI has learnt that the ace fast bowler may miss the first week or two of the IPL and likely to join the Mumbai Indians camp only in April.Bumrah is undergoing rehab at the BCCI's Centre of Excellence (CoE) in Bengaluru after sitting out of the ongoing Champions Trophy due to a lower back injury.""Bumrah's medical reports are okay. He has resumed bowling at the CoE. However, it is unlikely he'll be able to bowl at the start of the IPL in another fortnight. As per current status, the first week of April looks a more realistic date for him to get back to high-intensity cricket,"" a BCCI source said.In that scenario, Bumrah is likely to miss the first three or four matches for MI. Bumrah, it is learnt, still hasn't started bowling full tilt. ""It's standard operating procedure. The medical team will gradually build up his workload and intensity. Unless he is able to bowl full tilt without any discomfort for some days, the medical team is unlikely to clear him,"" the source said.Incidentally, Lucknow Super Giants pacer Mayank Yadav , too, is expected to join the IPL in April.What needs to be factored in is that India have a tough five-Test tour of England immediately after the IPL. The eventual target is to have Bumrah fit for as many Tests in England as possible. With so much uncertainty around Rohit Sharma continuing as Test captain, Bumrah is seen as the frontrunner to lead the side if the selectors don't go for a younger captain, given the pacer's fitness concerns.It is learnt that with Bumrah and Mohammed Shami prone to injuries, the selectors don't want to plan the entire tour of England around these two seamers. ""How Shami and Bumrah endure the long IPL will be important. Shami is under constant watch. If the selectors get both of them together for two-three Tests, it will be the ideal situation. The team management will also be cautious of pushing the duo to pay all Tests together. Nobody wants either of them breaking down in the middle of a Test, like it happened with Bumrah in Sydney. Too much depended on Bumrah alone in Australia,"" sources said. Mohammed Siraj is almost certain to retain his Test place while Harshit Rana and Akash Deep will have to prove their worth. Mukesh Kumar and Arshdeep Singh will also be in the race. The India 'A' tour before the England Tests will be key.","Bumrah is undergoing rehab at the BCCI's Centre of Excellence (CoE) in Bengaluru.

Big injury scare for New Zealand as Matt Henry doubtful for Champions Trophy final

NEW DELHI: India's batting coach Sitanshu Kotak has hailed KL Rahul's adaptability, stating that his seamless transition to the No. 6 role has strengthened the team's batting depth.While Rahul had previously flourished at No. 5, he has willingly embraced the shift down the order since the ODI series against Sri Lanka last year.Rahul showcased his growing comfort in the Champions Trophy semifinal against Australia, playing a crucial unbeaten 42. Alongside Hardik Pandya , he added 34 quick runs to shut the door on Australia.Kotak praised Rahul's willingness to play any role the team requires. ""He is someone who can open, go at 4 or 5, and is now doing what No. 6 demands. He adapts well and is very happy in the role he is performing,"" he said.The coach emphasised how having a solid batter at No. 6 benefits the team. ""When he starts performing at that number, it obviously helps him too because he is adjusting to different situations. So, that is great for the team as well,"" Kotak explained. ""But whatever I have spoken to him, he is happy to do whatever the team requires, and he has been doing that.""Kotak also stressed that the Indian team is handling the pressure of the final well, thanks to the influence of senior players like Rohit Sharma Virat Kohli , Hardik Pandya, Mohammed Shami and Ravindra Jadeja.""The seniors, young players... they all talk. That is something very priceless,"" he said. ""They have 15-20 years of experience. They talk to the players who have been playing for two or three years.
