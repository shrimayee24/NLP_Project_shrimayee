The long-standing alleged hostility between the two former teammates seemed to dissolve as they demonstrated mutual respect and camaraderie.In IPL 2023, Kohli and Gambhir, then the mentor for Lucknow Super Giants, had a fierce on-field altercation, but this season, it seemed they had left the past behind.Kohli, the face of RCB, and Gambhir, mentor of KKR, showed that their past differences were behind them.Now in a video shared by KKR Vibe, former Indian spinner Amit Mishra revealed how the feud ended.Amit Mishra says, ""It was Gautam Gambhir who ended the feud with Virat Kohli by walking up to him and hugged him thereby showing his large heartedness. Although it should've been done by Kohli as he made the issue bigger and dragged it.""Earlier, Kohli had also reflected on the moment with Gambhir during an event. ""People are very disappointed with my behaviour. I hugged Naveen, and then the other day, Gauti bhai (Gautam Gambhir) came and hugged me. Your masala is over so you're booing. We're not kids anymore,"" Kohli remarked.Gambhir had also provided perspectives on his relationship with Kohli and the nuances of on-field conduct, shedding light on the complexities inherent in their interactions both within and beyond the cricketing arena.Gambhir remarked on the media's role in shaping public perceptions, highlighting the tendency to sensationalize narratives for the sake of ratings.""It is all about TRPs. Media has got no clue what kind of a person I am, what kind of a person Virat is. All the media wants to do is create hype. But hype can also be created in a positive way,"" Gambhir observed, underscoring the impact of media coverage on public opinion. I absolutely second what Virat said. Logon ka masala nahi mila toh (The gossip bit is over for people). As I said, when two people are mature enough, I don't think so anyone has got any right to interfere between two people's life or their relationships because ultimately, it is between two of them,"" Gambhir added on the subject.With Gambhir now appointed as the head coach of the Indian national cricket team, succeeding Rahul Dravid , the dynamics between the former teammates are under scrutiny once again.","Virat Kohli and Gautam Gambhir had a fierce on-field altercation in IPL 2023.

'You need to identify...': Team India head coach Gautam Gambhir on having a balanced mix of players,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/you-need-to-identify-team-india-head-coach-gautam-gambhir-on-having-a-balanced-mix-of-players/articleshow/111794788.cms,"NEW DELHI: Team India 's new head coach Gautam Gambhir carries with him the hopes of the country that is fresh from T20 World Cup glory.The 42-year-old, a skilled left-handed batsman who scored over 10,000 international runs across three formats, played a key part in India's T20 World Cup win in 2007 and ODI World Cup win in 2011.Back as mentor, Gambhir led Kolkata Knight Riders to the IPL crown this year.Gambhir has now succeeded Rahul Dravid who stepped down after celebrating victory in the T20 World Cup -- India's first global title since the 2013 Champions Trophy.Gambhir's tenure will officially get underway with the away series against Sri Lanka , that has 3 T20Is and 3 ODIs.Ahead of the series, Star Sports shared a video of Gambhir talking about the importance of having a balanced mix of players in the team.Flanked by former cricketers Irfan Pathan , Krishnamachari Srikkanth and Kumar Sangakkara, Gambhir discusses team formation ahead of the Sri Lanka series.Gambhir says in the video, ""First you need to identify players who have got that fearless approach as well and probably in a format like 50 overs, you need to have a mixture of every kind of players. You should have players who can anchor the innings and change in rules has also made a huge difference. That time we used to have only on new ball, now we've got two new balls and five fielders inside, so the role of the part-timer has gone out of the window. You don't see enough reverse swing anymore, you don't see enough purchase for finger spinners as well, but I always feel that when we talk about this new approach, you got to identify players who can adapt to those roles, that template very easily. Some people just cannot adapt to that template. So why push them to play in a certain way which doesn't come naturally to them. So for me I think indentifying players and at the same time getting the right mix is very very important rather than think that we have to play with a certain template so we got to select all the 15 with a similar mindset or with a similar template.""India have not won a global title in the ODI format since winning the Champions Trophy in 2013, and Gambhir would want to change that in the upcoming year.Gambhir is the only Indian -- and one of four international cricketers including Don Bradman, Jacques Kallis and Mohammad Yousuf -- to have scored centuries in five successive Test matches.",Gautam Gambhir is India's new head coach.

Barring

Hardik Pandya

, India does not have a genuine pace-bowling allrounder...

India's outgoing bowling coach Paras Mhambrey has worked within BCCI's ecosystem from 2015 as Rahul Dravid's trusted lieutenant. During their last assignment, they saw India lift the T20 World Cup in Barbados last month.""It's rewarding to see that the process that we started has seen players come through the ranks, go on to play for India and eventually share the dressing room when they were lifting the trophy. Rahul was very clear in his head what he wanted to do and backed it all the way - be it with the U-19 and India 'A' teams or at the NCA,"" Mhambrey tells TOI in an interview.Rahul was very clear that we had to stick to a 'process-first' policy with the developmental teams. Results were not the focus. It was ensured that every player on a tour got at least a game. That didn't mean that all of them got equal opportunities. But we had to ensure that no one was denied game time. Players felt secure and as a result the 'A' teams and U-19 teams lost very few matches. Thriving 'A' and U-19 programmes were instrumental in making sure the players never felt out of place when they toured with the senior team.I believe the biggest achievement during our tenure has been assimilation of data. When we started, there was no data at the U-19 and India 'A' level. There were no video analysts assigned. We had to run around and chase state associations to keep data of players. I remember there was a series in New Zealand when I had to sit all day at a spot holding a camera to shoot the game from the perfect angle. Devraj Raut at NCA was a massive help. As we got data across all aspects of the game, we could formalize a lot of programmes and streamline the structure. When you have data with you, it's easier to get players on board with your planning such as workload management.Then there was the decision to limit players to just one U-19 World Cup. Again, a strong 'A' programme and 'emerging' programme helped bridge the gap and carry out the transition of players.It was different. We took time to build a relationship with senior players. You can't be dealing in the same way with the likes of Shami , Ashwin , Virat or Rohit as you did with the players coming through BCCI programmes. Here the most important thing was conversations. Building relationships is crucial. That's why we got to a place when we could have an honest conversation with Ishant Sharma in South Africa and then the likes of Bhuvneshwar Kumar to tell them the vision we had for the team going forward. Even with the likes of Siraj, who has come through our 'A' programme, we were having different conversations and that was result-oriented.It's important to have those discussions with Shami and Ashwin about their future plans and then lay out a plan. When we decided to invest in youth, we made sure they were not alone in the park shouldering all responsibilities. Be it Arshdeep or Avesh, we made sure they were always bowling alongside senior bowlers.You can't put a timeline on that. You have to be patient with it. We started in 2015 and we had that pool by 2020. If you look at Arshdeep's evolution, he played in the U-19 World Cup in 2018 and he was representing India in 2022 before really becoming an integral part in 2024. A young pace bowler takes four-five years to hit his peak. You can't simply rush them through.He got just one game in the U-19 World Cup because we were giving opportunities to everyone. Then he was out of the system. When he got picked in the IPL , I thought it was going to be interesting. But the best thing about him is that he is all about bowling. He loves to keep on bowling. He doesn't have a cluttered mind when he is at the top of the mark. He has bowled in the toughest phases. Even in IPL, where you were seeing consistent scores of above 200, his economy was under nine. Just the dedication towards bowling and a clear head has seen him rise.It is a bit tough with the younger generation of cricketers who have grown up seeing IPL. When Rahul and I were working with the junior teams, we talked a lot about the history of the game so they could understand the importance of all formats. Only 314 players have played Test cricket for India. What could be more glamorous than becoming a part of that elite list? And if you talk to the likes of Bumrah, Shami and Siraj, who have been doing well in all three formats, you will know how much they value Test cricket. If you do well in Test cricket, your value goes up a few notches.You have to understand what your advantage is according to the resources you have. If you have far better spinners then obviously spinning tracks will be your advantage. But raging rank turners are not the answer. It brings the touring team into the game big time because anybody who could roll his arm over and land the ball at a desired spot can run through your batting. It becomes a lottery.You need to identify such players across the country. There won't be many pace-bowling allrounders. The problem is that most of them give up bowling to sustain themselves. But if you can manage to find five-six potential allrounders from U-19 and domestic cricket, you have to keep working with them. Give them confidence. The Impact Player rule in IPL doesn't help. But you have to be at it. We have got Shivam Dube back to bowling. You have to give these bowlers overs in matches so that they start backing themselves.","India's outgoing bowling coach Paras Mhambrey has worked within BCCI's ecosystem from 2015 as Rahul Dravid's trusted lieutenant.

In the message, Gambhir recognized the significance of his journey with Kolkata, stating, ""are a story, are a team"".However, he also emphasized that there are greater legacies to be created and more ambitious scripts to be penned together, as he embarks on a new chapter in his career as a member of the Indian cricket team's coaching staff.""I smile when you smile. I cry when you cry. I win when you win. I lose, when you lose. I dream when you dream. I achieve when you achieve. I believe with you and I become with you. I am you, Kolkata, I am just one of you. I know your struggles and I know where it hurts. The rejections have crushed me but like you, I wake up embracing hope. I get beaten every day but like you, I am yet to be defeated. They tell me to be popular, I tell them to be a winner. I am you, Kolkata I am just one of you. This Kolkata air talks to me. The sounds, the streets here, the traffic jams. They all convey how you feel. I hear what you say, but I know what you mean. I know you are emotional. So am I. I know you're demanding. So am I. Kolkata, we are a bond. We are a story. We are a team,"" said Gambhir in his video message.""And now the time has come when we have to create some legacies together. The time has come when we have to write some bigger and bolder scripts. The script not with purple ink but in that blue, the treasured India blue. As we both take our fresh card we promise each other that we will never walk alone. It will always be shoulder-to-shoulder, hand in hand. It will all be for the tricolor. It will all be about our India,"" he added.Gambhir's tenure as mentor of KKR was highly successful, as he revamped the team's approach after a few disappointing seasons. The opening pair of Phil Salt and Sunil Narine led the charge, making KKR one of the most formidable and aggressive batting lineups in the tournament. The spin bowling combination of Varun Chakravarthy and Narine, along with the youthful exuberance of Harshit Rana and Vaibhav Arora, also contributed significantly to the team's championship victory.The championship triumph also elevated the status of Indian middle-order batsman Shreyas Iyer, who had been excluded from the BCCI's central contract list earlier in the year. Following Gambhir's success with KKR, fans are eagerly anticipating his leadership of the Indian national team, hoping that he will guide them to numerous victories with the same aggressive, winning, and never-give-up attitude.","Gautam Gambhir steps down from his role as coach of Kolkata Knight Riders.

I said sir my leadership role as a player will always be there, only the captain tag won't be there in front of me but whatever in my capacity till I hang up my boots, I will always give my 100% for the country.

'If they take us for granted...': Joshua Da Silva on England's focus on Ashes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/if-they-take-us-for-granted-joshua-da-silva-on-englands-focus-on-ashes/articleshow/111792006.cms,"NEW DELHI: Joshua Da Silva , the West Indies wicketkeeper-batter, expressed his thoughts on England's approach to the current series, stating that their keen attention on the upcoming 2025-26 Ashes series against Australia could present an opportunity for his team.De Silva believes that this focus could work in favor of the West Indies as they aim to level the series in the crucial second Test.The second Test is set to commence on Thursday at Trent Bridge in Nottingham, following England's commanding victory by an innings and 114 runs at Lord's , which gave them a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.It was also the retirement game for the pace legend James Anderson , who retires from the sport with a total of 991 international wickets, including 704 Test scalps. From Tuesday onwards, Anderson took on a new role within the team as a bowling coach.The decision to appoint Anderson as a coach, along with the introduction of pacer Gus Atkinson and wicketkeeper-batter Jamie Smith, was made with a clear objective: to prepare for the 2025-26 Ashes series in Australia. England are determined to reclaim the coveted urn, having last lost it during the 2017-18 season. The team's last Ashes series victory on Australian soil dates back to the 2010-11 campaign, making the upcoming series a crucial opportunity to break the long-standing drought.Silva expressed his understanding of England's approach to prepare for the upcoming Ashes series in Australia, despite facing criticism from the cricketing world for potentially underestimating their current opponents, West Indies and Sri Lanka, who are touring the UK this summer. As a wicketkeeper-batter, Silva comprehends the significance of planning ahead for a crucial assignment like an away Ashes series.However, Silva also pointed out that if England were to underestimate the West Indies, it could provide an opportunity for the Caribbean side to clinch a crucial victory and keep the series alive.""That is their biggest fixture of their calendar,"" Da Silva said, as quoted by ESPNCricinfo.""So if they are looking forward, they are looking to groom some players to make sure they have their team ready for them. I do not think it is wrong of them at all.""""Nah, it does not hurt us. I do not study it especially. We still have to play the cricket. If they take us for granted we might get a win, or might win the series. For me, I take that as a favour,"" he concluded his point.Da Silva acknowledged that the team's batting performance was subpar in the opening Test match. However, he pointed out a few encouraging signs, such as batsmen getting decent starts, despite his personal scores of zero and nine in the two innings.""Obviously in the batting a few of us did not stick our hands up. We had a few soft dismissals. We are pretty disappointed after the first Test. We have put that behind us, we have had our discussions, and we are looking forward to the second Test. We are doing everything we can, rebuilding, and going hard forward into the next Test,"" said Silva.""It might not look like it, but we have taken a few positives. A lot of guys got starts and just did not carry on. We talked about soaking up more pressure and how we are going to deal with those situations if we are put in them again. Not losing wickets in clusters...""It is about reminding ourselves of the process and trusting that process because all of us have a different way of going about it.

NEW DELHI: Suryakumar Yadav , the dynamic batsman, has unexpectedly emerged as a strong contender to lead India's T20 team until the 2026 World Cup, potentially surpassing Hardik Pandya , who was previously considered the natural choice for the position.Despite Pandya's availability for the upcoming T20I series against Sri Lanka, it has come to light that Suryakumar, who led India in eight T20Is against Australia and South Africa in the previous year, is the favoured choice of the newly appointed head coach Gautam Gambhir and the chairman of selectors Ajit Agarkar .It is understood that Gambhir and Agarkar had a discussion with Pandya earlier in the evening, explaining the decision to finalise a long-term option to ensure stability within the team.The T20 captaincy position became available following Rohit Sharma 's retirement from international cricket in the shortest format after India's triumphant World Cup campaign in the West Indies last month.Pandya, a key contributor to that victory, will be absent from the three-match ODI series against Sri Lanka due to ""personal reasons"".The T20I series is scheduled from July 27 to 30 in Pallekele, followed by the ODIs from August 2 to 7 in Colombo. The squad announcement for the series is expected in the coming days.""Hardik Pandya was India's T2O vice-captain under Rohit Sharma. He is completely fit and available for the three-match T20I series and was supposed to lead the side but there is a very strong feeling that SKY would be the potential leader not only for the Sri Lanka series but till the 2026 World Cup,"" a seniorBCCI source told PTI on conditions of anonymity.""Hardik's break from ODIs is for very personal reasons. He doesn't have any fitness issue as is being suggested in the media,"" the official said.Suryakumar, aged 33, is considered one of the most well-liked individuals within the Indian cricket team. His rise to prominence as a T20 player occurred during his stint with the Kolkata Knight Riders, where he played under the leadership of Gautam Gambhir, who gave him the moniker 'SKY'.Although Hardik Pandya was seen as the natural choice to succeed Rohit Sharma, several factors have influenced the decision-making process. His lackluster performance as the captain of the Mumbai Indians, coupled with the selectors' unwillingness to allow him to pick and choose his assignments, has impacted his chances.The selectors are open to the idea of Pandya participating in the Vijay Hazare Trophy this season to gain some experience in the 50-over format.Regarding the ODIs, an official confirmed that Pandya has requested leave and has already informed Rohit, who is also taking a break from this series.For the ODI series, KL Rahul , who led the team in the previous series in South Africa, and Shubman Gill are the frontrunners for the leadership role.Jay Shah, the BCCI secretary, has emphasized the importance of star cricketers participating in domestic tournaments when they are not engaged in national team commitments. However, he mentioned that players such as Rohit, Virat Kohli, and Jasprit Bumrah will be exempted from this requirement.The BCCI is keen on having the remaining Test specialists take part in at least one or two Duleep Trophy matches scheduled for August. This participation is seen as a preparation for the upcoming Test series against Bangladesh and New Zealand.""This time there is no zonal selection committee for Duleep Trophy. Only the national selection committee will pick Duleep teams.""All Test team contenders will be picked.

This win marked the end of India's 11-year drought for an ICC title.Following the successful T20 World Cup campaign, Hardik was greeted with open arms upon his return to his hometown, Vadodara, on Monday.The 30-year-old cricketer also participated in a roadshow to celebrate the Indian team's remarkable achievement in the tournament, reported ANI.Taking to X, Hardik thanked fans for a ""surreal"" welcome back home, which made him experience ""so many emotions"".""Surreal Thank you for all the love Baroda, thank you for the support and thank you for making this such a special day.

He mentioned that the team revolved around three key players: Virat Kohli , AB de Villiers , and Chris Gayle .Parthiv had two separate stints with RCB, first in the 2014 edition of the IPL and then from 2018 to 2020. During his initial stint in 2014, the trio of Kohli, de Villiers and Gayle were at the height of their careers, dominating the opposition with their exceptional batting skills. However, when he returned to the franchise in 2018, Gayle was no longer a part of the team.""I played for RCB, I've been there for four years. The team is always about individuals, it's not about the team. And then everyone who comes out of that team will say that. Because it's all about Virat Kohli, AB de Villiers, and Chris Gayle when I was in the team,"" Parthiv said while speaking on the Cyrus Says Podcast.""So they were given the kind of special preference always so there the team culture was not there. You can see clearly when they are playing, and that is the reason why they haven't won the trophies. That's the fact,"" Parthiv added.Parthiv, a former Indian cricket player, represented the RCB in the IPL for three seasons. In 2014, he featured in 12 matches for the team.

NEW DELHI: The Australian cricket team is set to embark on a white-ball tour of the United Kingdom in September, with matches scheduled against Scotland and England. Chief selector George Bailey announced a 15-man squad on Monday, with Mitchell Marsh named as the captain.The squad also includes 16-year-old Cooper Connolly , who has received his first call-up for the T20I matches on the tour.Connolly's journey to this moment began three years ago at Willowmoore Park in Benoni, South Africa, a venue located about 20 kilometers east of Johannesburg.In a less glamorous setting compared to the recent BBL final at Optus Stadium, which drew over 50,000 fans, Connolly experienced a defining moment in his young career.Despite the modest crowd at Willowmoore Park, the stakes were high for the then 16-year-old Connolly. He was given the opportunity to play in the final game of the 2020 men's Under-19 World Cup against the West Indies after Jake Fraser-McGurk had to withdraw from the tournament due to a monkey scratch incident.Connolly seized the moment and scored a 47-ball half-century, showcasing his ability to perform under pressure. Over the next four years, Connolly's talent and contributions played a significant role in thePerth Scorchers ' success, helping them secure a record fifth men's Big Bash title.Additionally, he was instrumental in Western Australia 's three consecutive Sheffield Shield victories. His consistent performances and ability to deliver in crucial moments have now earned him a place in Australia's T20 squad for the upcoming tour of the UK, marking his first international call-up.The call from national selector Tony Dodemaide was a ""surreal moment"" for Connolly. ""I couldn't sit still, I was walking around for about 10-15 minutes, it was such a surreal moment,"" IANS quoted Connolly as saying to cricket.com.au.Despite his success with the Scorchers and WA, Connolly admits that he is venturing into uncharted territory. ""I've never experienced this level (international cricket), so it'll be nice to learn from some of the guys going, some quality players including the likes of Travis Head,"" he said.""I'll get (over) there, get learning and hopefully, if I get my opportunity, I'll make the most of it.""Despite his relatively short stint in top-level cricket, having participated in just 15 matches since his BBL debut in January of the previous year, Connolly demonstrated remarkable versatility. His exposure to various playing conditions, such as leading the Australian team at the 2022 U19 World Cup held in the West Indies and being part of a tour to India, further bolstered his qualifications.Connolly's capacity to excel under high-pressure situations was showcased during the BBL 12 final against Brisbane Heat. He played a pivotal role in the Scorchers' victory by contributing an essential 25 runs off just 11 deliveries, remaining unbeaten. This ability to perform in crucial moments established him as a dependable middle-order finisher, a position that was previously occupied by experienced players such as Matty Wade and Marcus Stoinis.As he prepares for the UK tour , Connolly remains grounded and focused on his growth. At just 20, he recognises that he is far from a finished product. ""I'm trying to take every opportunity because I want to allow myself the best opportunity to represent my country in any position that's required,"" he said.Despite his desire to open the batting, he acknowledges the learning curve and aims to excel in the middle-order role where he has already shown promise.""I found my way a little bit towards the back end of the Big Bash last season at six and worked out how to play that role a bit better. I still want to open the batting, it's quite a good spot to be.""It's just going to take some time and it was something new to me, I haven't had that much exposure or experience with it so over time I'll hopefully get better and maybe get some opportunities in coming years.""Connolly frequently reminisces about his experience in Benoni in February 2020, a pivotal point that catalyzed his swift ascent. The event in Benoni served as a launchpad for Connolly's career, instilling in him the self-assurance needed to pursue his aspirations.""That tournament doesn't feel like a long ago at all,"" he said. ""I made (64 off 53 balls) at 16 years of age which was a real confidence booster for myself, I thought I could potentially make it to the next level.""It was strange circumstances that I got the opportunity and I just tried to make the most of it as much as I could. It's always nice to have in the back of your mind but then again I was 16 at the first one and 18 at the last one, there's so much growth that has happened between then and now.""And I feel like there's so much more growth I can give to my cricketing ability and hopefully I can show some of my talent if that opportunity presents (in the UK).""It's pretty surreal to be saying that I could be standing shoulder-to-shoulder with some of these guys, it won't feel real for the first bit but hopefully I can settle in … have some fun and see what happens.""",Cooper Connolly named in Australia's T20 squad for tour of the UK. The 16-year- old will play against Scotland and England on the tour. Connolly's first international call-up came at the 2020 U19 World Cup in South Africa.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111786142,imgsize-30988,width-400,resizemode-4/111786142.jpg"

The side missed Jobby Justin who was on a card and Aditya Patra replaced Debjit Ghosh under the post.East Bengal began well as Jesin TK, the scorer in the derby, made it into the rival box in the second minute only to be adjudged offside.

But the Customs defence continued to frustrate them. They even managed to create chances with some effective counter-attacks.""We did create chances, but failed to convert those.

UEFA Euro 2024: Spain bask in bench strength,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/uefa-euro-2024/uefa-euro-2024-spain-bask-in-bench-strength/articleshow/111771032.cms,"A bold and beautiful Spain sailed over every hurdle that came in their way over the last one month. While they were taking teams apart across different cities of Germany, they were also breaking a few age-old perceptions that have become part and parcel of Spanish football .Since the turn of the century, and more specifically following the Leo Messi-Cristiano Ronaldo era, the modern-day consumer of world football had come to believe that there's nothing more to Spanish football than El Clasico.The last time there was a club-country double in European competitions was way back in 1988 when PSV Eindhoven and The Netherlands won the two titles. Real Madrid and Spain have done an encore 36 years later, but it can be safely said that these two titles are completely independent of each other.Yes, Real's Dani Carvajal had the captain's armband on when Spain finally won it, and Barcelona 's Lamine Yamal was the talisman who kept delivering the goods time and time again, but this victory wasn't just about the two elite-team players. There was a bit of Barca influence with Dani Olmo and Marc Cucurella both being products of the Catalan giants' youth set-up La Masia, but they have played all their football in other clubs of Spain and abroad.Let's look at the two scorers of Sunday - Nico Williams and Mikel Oyarzabal. Not many are aware that they play in opposing clubs of one of the most fiercely contested derbies in Europe - the Basque derby . While Nico is still a part of Athletic Bilbao (he may not be one at the end of the summer transfer window), Oyarzabal plays for Real Sociedad, one of the most consistent Spanish clubs which played in the Champions League this year. Add to them goalkeeper Unai Simon and defender Le Normand - both from the Basque region - and we have a team which is significantly different from the 2012 Euro winning side, which had six Barcelona and four Real players in the starting XI. Meanwhile, the man of the tournament Rodri, who now plays for Manchester City, is a Villarreal product, a team that most Manchester United fans would remember from that Europa final marathon tie-break loss in 2021.It's not just about the personnel. The current lot's style and approach is significantly different from that of both Real and Barca. This Spanish team does revel in possession, but it is not meaningless possession of Luis Enrique's 2022 World Cup team, that seemed a pale shadow of the tiki-taka masters of the earlier decade.The Spanish coach Luis de la Fuente - himself a Basque who played most of his football for Bilbao - understood very early that he doesn't have the quality of Xavi Hernandez, Iniesta and Sergio Busquets in his line-up to play the old tiki-taka style. Rather, the players have the zest and speed of a technically gifted lot which is ready to press high when required and launch lightning fast counters when that's the call of the hour. There has also been a shift in style with the fast wingers on two ends of the pitch calling the shots instead of million passes in the middle of the park with the hope of one breakthrough ball.This pragmatism and fluidity of approach with a group of players who don't have the ego of superstars, but the work ethic of world beaters, helped de la Fuente create a team for all seasons.Come next World Cup, four magnificent Barcelona youngsters - Pedri, Gavi, Fermin Lopez and Pau Cubarsi - should be in the mix and the red of La Roja could be the brightest colour in world football for a while.","The last time there was a club-country double in European competitions was way back in 1988 when PSV Eindhoven and The Netherlands won the two titles.

Player of the tournament: Rodri

Young player of the tournament: Lamine Yamal

Player of the final: Nico Williams

BARCELONA: Spain arrived in Germany with no huge stars or real expectations. Six weeks later, Luis de la Fuente 's team heads home with a European Championship title to celebrate and reason to believe in a bright future.The youthful spark of Lamine Yamal and Nico Williams combined perfectly with the veteran poise of Rodri and other mainstays who had yet to win a major trophy as Spain completed its superb Euro 2024 with a 2-1 win over England on Sunday.The key was making Spain a more dynamic attacking team to end a decade of "" tiki-taka "" misfires.""We hope this can keep going and we can shoot for the World Cup ,"" the 22-year-old Williams said after scoring the opening goal.The euphoria was justified.Spain won all seven games - with none going to penalties - and scored a record 15 goals at a European Championship.Spain downed Croatia and Italy in the group phase before eliminating Germany and France to reach the final.""We made history,"" Rodri said after the game. ""We made history beating four world champions in a row."" Rodri was named the player of the tournament, even without playing in the second half of the final due to a leg problem.The title ends a 12-year wait since a group piloted by Andres Iniesta and Xavi Hernandez dominated world soccer after sweeping up the 2008 and 2012 Euros and the 2010 World Cup. ""The previous generations showed us the way,"" Rodri said. The only member of the team who knew what it was like to win a major title was the 38-year-old Jesus Navas, who played at the 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012. Fittingly, Iniesta, Xavi and former Spain striker David Villa were together in the stands at the Olympiastadion to watch how this new batch of players added a new dimension to Spain's game.While nowhere close to England's anguishing title drought since the 1966 World Cup, Spain had entered a period of underachieving since their success at Euro 2012. Their attempts to maintain the ""tiki-taka"" ball-possession playing style failed. In Germany, however, Spain deployed some new weapons that left defences scrambling to cover attacks from all angles. The imprint of those great Spain teams was still there to be seen, of course. Rodri and fellow midfielder Fabian Ruiz could latch onto the ball when required. Yet the strength of Spain shifted to the wings.Yamal put on a show each game from the right side. The Barcelona forward, who turned 17 a day before the final, scored an instant classic of a goal to help beat France 2-1 in the semi-finals, and he delivered his fourth assist of the tournament to set up Williams' goal against England.Williams romped on the other flank, doubling up with Marc Cucurella to make a duo that no defenders could handle. Cucurella delivered the pass for Mikel Oyarzabal to score the winner over England. Williams, the Athletic Bilbao forward and Leipzig's Dani Olmo are likely going to draw the attention of major clubs.",Spain beat England 2-1 in the Euro 2024 final in Berlin. Lamine Yamal and Nico Williams were key to Spain's success. Spain won all seven games and scored a record 15 goals at a European Championship.

The Italian had won three of their last four meetings.""Overall, I was inferior on the court. He was the better player,"" the 24-time major winner said.

dreams of one day sitting 'at same table' as

Djokovic

, Nadal and Federer

LONDON: Carlos Alcaraz took ownership of Wimbledon 's Centre Court in signature style. The 21-year-old was leaping into the air and slamming forehands one minute and getting down on the grass and picking up a volley off his shoelaces the next.He was all over the court, covering ground, corner to corner, baseline to net and back again without really breaking a sweat.The Spaniard thumped down serves at 136 mph and came up with feather light dropshots. Like a real estate mogul marking territory, he knew every blade of grass on the rectangle. ""I've never seen him serve that way, 136. I've never seen him serve that fast,"" Novak Djokovic marvelled.Alcaraz, just the second man in the Open Era to win his first four Grand Slam finals, Roger Federer won his first seven, is in a race with the record books. ""I've seen and heard all the stats,"" he said. ""I try not to think about it too much. It's a really great start to my career, but I have to keep going.""Alcaraz has Djokovic's 24 Grand Slams, Rafael Nadal 22 and Roger Federer 20 in his sights. That's the goal post he's aiming for. ""At the end of my career, I want to sit at the same table as the big guys. That's my dream right now,"" the two-time Wimbledon champion said. ""It doesn't matter if I already won four Grand Slams at the age of 21. If I don't keep going, it doesn't matter. I will try to keep winning and end my career with a lot of Grand Slam titles.""The world No. 3, who turns to the golf course to relax, reiterated the importance of building. Brick by brick. ""I'm happy with the work I'm doing with my team, I'm proud of myself, all the things that I'm doing great. It has been unbelievable, an amazing journey so far,"" said Alcaraz, whose long-time coach Juan Carlos Ferrero has been the conductor of his career.""I don't know what my limit is. I don't want to think about it,"" he said. ""I just want to keep enjoying my moment, just to keep dreaming. So, let's see if at the end of my career it's going to be 25, 30, 15 or four (Slams). I don't know.""Alcaraz, who had 21 forehand winners, and just 10 unforced errors off that flank in the final against Djokovic, picked on his weapon when asked where he could improve. ""I have to keep improving everything, I guess. My forehand, at this level I think it can be better. Every year it should be better,"" he said. ""I think my game in general can improve. I have to keep growing and keep improving.""Alcaraz, whose play appeared to have lost its edge in the second half of last year, stumbling in big matches, falling to Daniil Medvedev in the semifinals of the US Open, said he needed to grow up.""I learnt a lot from that match against Daniil in the US Open in 2023,"" he said. ""I had to be more mature in those situations. I gave up a little bit. I remember perfectly. I gave up a little bit in the second set after losing the first one. It is unacceptable playing in a Grand Slam. I knew that these things can't happen again.""""I'm here right now thanks to these kinds of situations that I learned from,"" he added. Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner , who between them have the season's first three majors covered, have powered a change of guard. That's not to say Djokovic is done, only that the top of the game has a whole different vibe now.""Being over there with Jannik, 21 years old and 22 years old in the top of the ranking, winning Grand Slams, I think it is good for tennis to have new faces winning the big things and fighting for the big tournaments,"" he said.
