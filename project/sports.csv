NEW DELHI: A day after pro-Khalistan terrorists opened fire at Kapil Sharma 's cafe in Surrey and Germany-based Babbar Khalsa Operative Harjeet Singh Laddi claimed responsibility, terror group SFJ released a video confronting Sharma ""for backing Modi's Hindutva ideology while investing in Canada"". SFJ chief Gurpatwant Singh Pannun said, ""To Kapil and every other Modi-brand Hindutva investor: Canada is not your playground. Take your blood money back to Hindustan. Canada will not allow violent Hindutva ideology to take root on Canadian soil under the guise of business"", reports Rajshekhar Jha.Laddi, a fugitive on NIA's ""most-wanted"" list, termed the shooting as a retribution for some claims purportedly made on Sharma's show in the past. Intriguingly, he also disengaged Khalistanis from the shooting at the cafe associated with the popular comedian, terming the attack a ""false flag operation masterminded by Indian agencies"".The SFJ's rabble rouser chief kingpin went on to question why Sharma ""who chants Mera Bharat Mahan and openly endorses Modi's Hindutva"" was investing in Canada instead of Modi's India.","Pro-Khalistan terrorists opened fire at Kapil Sharma's cafe in Surrey.

Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality.

The boys denied wrongdoing, but the professors promised no punishment if they told the truth.And out it came.The student in the first row would write the answers, slip the sheet into the professor’s deep coat pocket and the one in the last row would retrieve it, copy it, and place it back.

That’s their weak point.” Conmen aren’t always brilliant—but they’re observant. They look you in the eye, smile warmly, exude trust—and then vanish with your wallet and your faith in humanity.Even Thiruvalluvar couldn’t resist a wry smile at this timeless phenomenon:He must have written this couplet with the tongue firmly in the cheek. No, he doesn’t appreciate those who cheat the vulnerable. He has dedicated an entire chapter on turpitude and warns us to be careful with fraudsters. But he also knows that conmen are invincible and will be around forever!","Soham Parekh took Silicon Valley by storm, not with code, but with cunning. Why are fraudsters often charming?

A quiet love story and learning to live without apology

In March 2024, Gisele Bündchen gave fans an emotionally raw glimpse into her post-divorce life during a heartfelt sitdown with Robin Roberts, reflecting on the end of her 13-year marriage to NFL icon Tom Brady. As part of the IMPACT x Nightline special Climbing the Mountain, the supermodel's tearful moment caught headlines—but beyond the emotion was a message of resilience, healing, and self-discovery.Gisele Bündchen, now 44, opened up about what she once described as “the death of my dream.” When Roberts gently revisited the quote, asking how she was coping more than a year after the split was finalized, Gisele struggled to answer before turning away and softly requesting, “Can I have a little moment?”That vulnerable pause wasn’t scripted—it was the real-time unfolding of a woman still navigating the aftershocks of letting go of a once-idealized life. And it struck a chord with fans who had watched her grace red carpets and Super Bowl stands by Brady’s side for over a decade.Following their October 2022 divorce, media speculation had pointed fingers at Tom Brady’s return to football as a key factor. But Gisele Bündchen strongly rejected that narrative in a Vanity Fair interview: “It’s the craziest thing I’ve ever heard.”Bündchen continued, “Listen, I have always cheered for him, and I would continue forever.”Despite the pain of separation, her sentiments toward Brady remained grounded in mutual respect. “If there’s one person I want to be the happiest in the world, it’s him, believe me,” she said. “I want him to achieve and to conquer. I want all his dreams to come true.”The interview at that time also hinted at Gisele Bündchen’s future—with herself and possibly with someone new. When asked if she was ready to love again, she replied with serene confidence: “Where my heart is now is where I am right now. I’m living my truth, and I’m not apologizing for it.”Behind the scenes, she had reportedly grown close to Joaquim Valente, her children’s jiu-jitsu instructor, though the relationship started as a friendship. “They’re taking it slow,” a source said at the time, noting how Valente had been a steady source of comfort during her transition.Also Read: “She is secure and happy”: Gisele Bündchen thrived after dumping Tom Brady—was the NFL legend the real problem?

Connor McDavid, one of the most talented and popular players in the NHL, has been recovering from a brutal heartbreak after his team, the Edmonton Oilers, ended up losing the 2025 Stanley Cup Finals to the Florida Panthers. With Connor McDavid’s contract with the Edmonton Oilers expiring in 2026, there are a lot of speculations about his future and it seems, the NHL star player has made his feelings pretty clear about it.A few days after the Edmonton Oilers lost to the Florida Panthers, Connor McDavid reflected on his future in the NHL. As per NHL.com, Connor McDavid spoke about his new contract and said, “It’s only been a couple of days since the season ended, I’m going to take some time to regroup.”The Edmonton Oilers’ captain added, “I’m going to talk to my agent a little bit and family and all that, and make some decisions whenever that time comes.

Swifties connect the dots between an Eras lyric and Travis Kelce’s first encounter

July 7 now holds a deeper meaning in the Swift-Kelce timeline

Fans about Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's relationship (SS via Twitter)

Before Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce became pop culture’s favorite power couple, fans believe their love story quietly began during a pivotal moment on the Eras Tour. A single lyric, a packed stadium, and one NFL star in the crowd—Swifties are convinced destiny was already singing in Kansas City that night.On July 7, 2023, during her Kansas City stop, Taylor Swift paused between songs and asked the crowd, “Will you allow me the honor of starting over?” The lyric — from her emotional ballad Last Kiss — was poignant on its own, but now, fans are giving it a whole new meaning. As fate would have it, Kelce was in the crowd that very night. Though the two hadn't met yet, Swifties are convinced that destiny was already at work.To the fans, this wasn’t just a concert — it was a cosmic nudge. Kelce reportedly attended the show with no idea that his life was about to change. But as Swift performed to a stadium of screaming fans, confetti raining down and bridges being belted out like gospel, something clicked. As one fan noted on social media, “He walked in a tight end and walked out a hopeless romantic.”The lyric from Last Kiss became symbolic. What once sounded like heartbreak has now become a line reinterpreted through love — a subtle, almost spiritual call for a fresh start, made even more poetic by what followed.What’s remarkable is how fans are treating this date like a new national holiday. Edits are being made. Fonts are being chosen. Tears are being shed. Many even believe that “the Eras Tour was a matchmaking ritual in disguise.” Swifties have always been excellent storytellers, but this theory might be their most cinematic yet.One Swifties @reneeasance wrote, “Well now I’m crying.” @j_eckerle wrote, “It was rare. I was there. I remember it all too well.” Another fan @thirteen_87 wrote, “This is sweet. I hope they can read this.” Another user @cleantvloverr wrote, “i’m in a puddle of tears.”Now, over a year later, Kelce seems fully committed to playing the long game. Whether he’s dancing at Swift’s concerts or traveling across continents to support her, he’s fully embraced the role of romantic lead.Also Read: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce refuse to satisfy public curiosity—no relationship update until they’re ready With their love continuing to unfold like a live tour setlist, fans are already imagining Swift’s next album including a subtle thank-you to Arrowhead Stadium.

NHL trade buzz: Montreal Canadiens targeting $50M Tampa Bay Lightning star Anthony Cirelli to strengthen top six,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-buzz-montreal-canadiens-targeting-50m-tampa-bay-lightning-star-anthony-cirelli-to-strengthen-top-six/articleshow/122387455.cms,"Anthony Cirelli (Credit: Getty Images)

Anthony Cirelli trade talks are not simple, but not off the table



Canadiens willing to make bold NHL moves this offseason



Lightning’s decision may come down to roster depth



The Montreal Canadiens are actively exploring trade options to upgrade their forward group this offseason, and Tampa Bay Lightning center Anthony Cirelli has surfaced as a top target. Team officials reportedly believe Cirelli’s skill set aligns perfectly with their roster needs, particularly as a reliable second-line pivot behind captain Nick Suzuki.Despite the Canadiens’ interest, pulling off a trade for Anthony Cirelli would be far from straightforward. The Lightning values his versatility and leadership, especially as they work to stay competitive in a tight Eastern Conference. Cirelli has long been viewed as a cornerstone in Tampa’s middle-six and a key penalty-kill contributor.Montreal has already demonstrated this offseason that it is willing to be aggressive. The team added top talent through the draft and is working to complement its young core with experienced, playoff-proven players. Anthony Cirelli checks many of those boxes.Though Montreal has reportedly considered other options to fill their second-line center void, including younger and older names across the league, Cirelli stands out due to his balanced game and long-term upside.He could also provide mentorship to developing forwards like Cole Caufield, Juraj Slafkovský, and Ivan Demidov.For Tampa Bay, the decision to entertain offers for Anthony Cirelli would likely hinge on their confidence in internal replacements. While the Lightning have a strong core intact, moving a forward of Cirelli’s caliber would leave a hole in their lineup, one that may not be easy to fill without adding from the outside.Anthony Cirelli has become a focal point in NHL trade rumors for good reason. He’s the kind of smart, dependable center that playoff teams are built around. If the Montreal Canadiens can navigate the trade hurdles and convince Tampa Bay to deal, they could make one of the biggest moves of the NHL offseason.Also Read: Former NHL enforcer Nick Tarnasky destroys drunk man in wild viral golf course brawl","Tampa Bay Lightning center Anthony Cirelli has surfaced as a top target.

Friendship on ice: Taylor Swift and Blake Lively ’s once-close bond crumbles

Blake Lively reportedly blames Justin Baldoni—and has a new strategy

It seems not even Taylor Swift ’s most cherished friendships are safe from Hollywood drama. According to insiders, the pop icon has gone radio silent on her longtime best friend Blake Lively—and the catalyst may be actor-director Justin Baldoni. But with Swift’s focus shifting more toward Travis Kelce and her carefully curated inner circle, fans are questioning if the rift is beyond repair.For years, Blake Lively was part of Taylor Swift’s elite inner circle—frequently appearing in behind-the-scenes snaps, attending birthday parties, and even lending her children’s names to Swift’s music. But sources say the two haven't been on speaking terms since Lively’s connection to Baldoni’s It Ends With Us legal drama unexpectedly dragged Swift into the spotlight.“After months of radio silence, Blake has stopped trying to reach out,” one insider revealed. “There is no recovering from this. Their friendship is done.”Fans quickly noticed the silence when Blake failed to like or acknowledge Swift’s celebratory post about reclaiming her music rights—a moment typically met with enthusiastic support from her tight-knit group. Swift, known for being fiercely loyal, apparently took Blake’s perceived alignment with Baldoni personally.Behind the scenes, Lively is said to be frustrated that her public image took a hit due to Baldoni’s legal team’s aggressive tactics. “Blake’s image took a huge hit with all the mud that Justin and his legal team threw at her, she lost her best friend,” a source explained.And now, with Swift's world increasingly dominated by her high-profile romance with NFL star Travis Kelce, it’s clear who has her attention these days. The tight end has become a steady presence in Swift’s whirlwind life, traveling across continents to be by her side. Some insiders believe Swift has re-centered her personal world, pushing out friendships that no longer serve or align with her evolving brand.Still, Blake Lively reportedly isn’t staying quiet. “She’s also looking to build up more high-profile bonds so she can show Taylor she is still a Hollywood heavyweight—and part of that is bitter,” another source added.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s masters win went viral with Jack Antonoff and her cat Meredith—but Travis Kelce quietly made it unforgettable As Swift gears up for another leg of the Eras Tour and Kelce preps for his next NFL season, one thing is certain: there may no longer be space in their storybook romance for past dragons.",Taylor Swift and Blake Lively's friendship appears to have fractured.

Self-Proclaimed World's Top ASTROLOGER Speaks! | TGA 4

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce may look like the ultimate power couple, but one astrologer believes their stars are far from aligned. While the world buzzes with speculation about a possible engagement, especially after the couple’s loved-up Fourth of July getaway, a bold new prediction suggests their story may end in heartbreak.Travis Kelce, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end, and Taylor Swift, the global pop icon, have been inseparable since going public with their romance in September 2023. From Swift cheering at NFL games to Kelce flying across continents to catch her Eras Tour, the pair have shown unwavering support for one another.Fans have even speculated that a secret proposal may have already happened. However, reports from outlets like People and Entertainment Tonight suggest they are waiting until Kelce finishes what could be his final NFL season.Amid all the romantic speculation, astrologer Mark Du Boise has thrown cold water on the fairytale. Calling himself the “world’s best” astrologer, Du Boise analyzed their birth charts and concluded that their cosmic chemistry is off.“Taylor’s troubled. She’s a sun-moon quincunx. It’s hard astrology. I don’t think anyone is going to last with her,” Du Boise claimed, suggesting that Swift’s Sagittarius sun and Cancer moon create inner tension between her adventurous nature and emotional needs.Meanwhile, Kelce’s Libra sun and Sagittarius moon make him charming and balanced, but potentially hesitant to commit deeply. According to Du Boise, the two signs together create a disconnect that could spell doom for long-term happiness.Despite the celestial warning, fans see no trouble in paradise. The couple continues to make public appearances, exchange heartfelt glances, and integrate into each other’s lives—including their families.

Ace Bailey's Injury: What Happened?

Impact and Fan Reaction on Ace's Injury

fans hoping to catch a glimpse of rookiein action at the Las Vegas Summer League were hit with disappointing news: Bailey has been ruled out of the Jazz’s first game due to hip flexor soreness. The update, confirmed by beat reporters and team sources, means Bailey will be sidelined as the Jazz face the Charlotte Hornets, turning what was a highly anticipated debut into a waiting game for both the player and his supporters. Ace Bailey , the No. 5 pick in the 2025 NBA Draft, had already generated buzz with his performances in the Salt Lake City Summer League, which served as a warm-up to the main event in Las Vegas. In his debut against the Philadelphia 76ers, Bailey played over 25 minutes, putting up a solid stat line of eight points and seven rebounds despite some rookie nerves. He quickly found his footing, following up with an 18-point, seven-rebound, three-assist performance against the Memphis Grizzlies, showcasing his athleticism with highlight-reel dunks and confident shot-making.“Just confidence. Stop thinking so hard... Just be Ace Bailey, who I am,” Bailey said after his breakout game, reflecting a growing comfort with the NBA pace and spotlight.Bailey sat out the Jazz’s final Salt Lake City Summer League game with what was initially described as a right groin strain.Hopes were high that he would return for the Las Vegas opener, but the team ultimately ruled him out due to hip flexor soreness—a common but frustrating injury for athletes that can linger if not properly managed. While the Jazz have not indicated that the injury is serious or long-term, they are taking a cautious approach, prioritizing Bailey’s health and long-term development over a single summer showcase.The timing is undeniably a letdown for Jazz fans who traveled to Vegas or tuned in specifically to see Bailey’s electrifying talent. The Summer League is a prime stage for rookies to make their mark, and Bailey’s absence is felt both on the court and in the stands. However, most analysts agree that missing a Summer League game is unlikely to have any lasting impact on Bailey’s NBA trajectory. The Jazz coaching staff has emphasized that their focus for Bailey is on developing his all-around game, especially his defense, decision-making, and off-ball movement, rather than immediate scoring output.While the setback is disappointing, Bailey’s early showings have already offered a glimpse of why he was such a coveted prospect. His blend of size, athleticism, and scoring instincts has drawn attention, and his attitude suggests he’s ready to put in the work required to succeed at the next level. The Utah Jazz and their fans will be hoping for a quick recovery, with the expectation that Bailey will return to action before the Summer League concludes—if not, his full debut will have to wait until preseason or the regular season.Also read: Larsa Pippen Spills on Her “Immature” NBA Coach Ex Before Finding Love With 31-Year-Old Jeff Coby For now, the message is clear: Ace Bailey’s story with the Utah Jazz is just beginning, and a minor injury won’t dim the excitement for what’s to come.",Utah Jazz rookie Ace Bailey has been ruled out of the Jazz’s first game due to hip flexor soreness.

“A mistake”: Aaron Rodgers at war with Steelers coaches as Jerome Bettis accuses team of abandoning their soul,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/a-mistake-aaron-rodgers-at-war-with-steelers-coaches-as-jerome-bettis-accuses-team-of-abandoning-their-soul/articleshow/122375158.cms,"Steelers' offseason acquisitions of Aaron Rodgers and DK Metcalf have sparked debate (Getty Images)

Jerome Bettis questions Steelers' identity shift away from run-first football

Jerome Bettis on the Dan Patrick Show Full Interview | 07/10/25

Clash of philosophies between Aaron Rodgers and Arthur Smith looms large



The Pittsburgh Steelers may have made headlines this offseason by landing Aaron Rodgers and DK Metcalf, but not everyone’s convinced the glitzy moves align with the team’s traditional DNA. In fact, Hall of Famer Jerome Bettis is ringing the alarm bells—and Rodgers might be silently agreeing.Aaron Rodgers signed with Pittsburgh for what could be his final NFL season, bringing a Hall of Fame résumé and a clear philosophy: he thrives in a controlled, efficient, pass-first offense. But that clashes with what offensive coordinator Arthur Smith has planned—a ground-heavy, tight end–centric scheme that echoes old-school football more than Rodgers’ up-tempo style.Bettis, appearing on The Dan Patrick Show, didn’t hold back. When Patrick asked about the departure of running back Najee Harris and whether Rodgers changes the team’s approach, Bettis was clear: “They’re going to run the football. They drafted [a] young kid from Iowa who’s really, really good running back.”He emphasized that even with Aaron Rodgers and Metcalf on board, abandoning the run game would be a fundamental mistake. “If you ask Aaron Rodgers to throw the ball 40 times, that’s a mistake,” Bettis warned.His logic? At 41, Rodgers shouldn’t be scrambling or absorbing unnecessary hits. The offense should play through the run to maximize play-action and control tempo.The tension deepens when you examine Arthur Smith’s history. Known for heavy run schemes, multiple tight end sets, and complex pre-snap motion, Smith’s system is almost the antithesis of what Rodgers prefers. The quarterback’s track record thrives in motion-light, single-tight-end, pass-heavy playbooks—a setup far from what Pittsburgh appears to be building.Even Bettis acknowledged this delicate balance: “He’s moving. He’s getting the ball out. He’s, you know, quick in the huddle, out of the huddle, running.” That doesn’t mesh easily with Smith’s grind-it-out game plans.Beyond the philosophical divide, practical concerns remain. Pittsburgh’s backfield, featuring rookie Kaleb Johnson and Jaylen Warren, is unproven. Meanwhile, the offensive line—an Achilles’ heel for Rodgers in New York—must protect its aging quarterback or risk an early collapse.Also Read: What we learned about Joe Burrow’s mindset, swagger and quirky side from Netflix’s 'Quarterback’ The Steelers’ attempt to fuse new-school talent with old-school identity could either produce fireworks—or a full-blown identity crisis.

Matthew Tkachuk Has Made Winning Stanley Cups Look Easy (Full Interview) | Stugotz

Panthers-Oilers rivalry continues to heat up



Western Canada wants a win, Tkachuk says, but not yet



Connor McDavid left searching for answers

After leading the Florida Panthers to back-to-back Stanley Cup championships, Matthew Tkachuk is in no mood to show mercy. When asked if he felt bad for Connor McDavid and the Edmonton Oilers, Tkachuk dismissed the suggestion outright.He pointed out that no one offered the Panthers sympathy when they lost in 2023 despite their injuries. Now, with two Cups in hand, Tkachuk isn’t about to soften his edge, especially not for a rival team.The Panthers and Oilers have built a fierce rivalry over the past two seasons, and Tkachuk’s latest remarks have only intensified it. Despite the Panthers having the upper hand with two straight Finals wins, the tension shows no signs of cooling.Tkachuk, a former Calgary Flames forward, has a long history with the Oilers, and his latest comments reflect a personal edge that keeps this rivalry burning.According to Tkachuk, fans from Western Canada have been hoping for a break for the Edmonton Oilers. But his message was clear: the Stanley Cup isn’t something to be handed out for pity. His competitive mindset has no room for emotional appeals.His time in Calgary made him all too familiar with Edmonton’s hunger for a Cup and even more determined to deny it.While the Panthers celebrate, Connor McDavid and the Oilers are left facing another tough offseason. Despite elite talent and deep playoff runs, they’ve fallen short once again.Tkachuk’s cold reaction is likely to sting, but it may also fire up McDavid and his teammates heading into next year. The Oilers are still chasing their first championship in the McDavid era, and the Panthers are standing firmly in the way.Tkachuk has drawn a clear line in the sand: there are no handouts at the top. And with the Panthers now firmly established as the team to beat, don’t expect this rivalry, or Tkachuk’s sharp edge, to disappear anytime soon.Also Read: Former NHL enforcer Nick Tarnasky destroys drunk man in wild viral golf course brawl","Florida Panthers left wing Matthew Tkachuk says the Stanley Cup isn't something to be handed out for pity.

Tom Brady and Sofia Vergara share yacht moments that spark dating speculation

High-profile rebound? Inside Brady and Vergara’s post-breakup glow-up

Tom Brady may be retired from the NFL, but his off-field adventures are keeping headlines just as busy. The latest buzz? A rumored summer romance with Modern Family star Sofía Vergara. And according to insiders, it’s giving all the signs of a classic A-list fling—complete with luxury yachts, gala dinners, and some unexpected seat-switching.The romance chatter began after Tom Brady and Sofia Vergara were spotted aboard the Luminara, a high-end Ritz-Carlton superyacht cruising the waters of Ibiza. Page Six reports that the two were seated together during a formal dinner—by design, not accident.“He asked to switch seats to sit next to her at dinner,” a source revealed, describing the vibe between the pair as flirtatious and light-hearted. The setting—sunsets on the Mediterranean, elite company, and private yachts—seemed almost too perfect for gossip not to ignite.Images of the two enjoying their time at sea quickly surfaced online, fueling even more speculation that Brady and Vergara may be more than casual acquaintances.The timing also adds intrigue: both stars are single and recently separated from high-profile relationships.Vergara finalized her divorce from actor Joe Manganiello in 2023, while Brady stepped away from the NFL and finalized his split from supermodel Gisele Bündchen the same year. Now, he’s transitioning into a new phase as a lead NFL analyst for FOX, but it seems he’s also making time for fun in the sun.OutKick described the dynamic as “classic summer fling energy,” noting the perfect tabloid recipe: two newly single, wildly attractive celebrities enjoying lavish getaways with no public labels—yet.And while neither Brady nor Vergara has confirmed the nature of their connection, the optics suggest something is brewing. “It’s a textbook meet-cute for the A-list crowd,” one outlet noted.Also Read: Tom Brady’s bold Birmingham move overshadowed by romance rumors with Sofía Vergara Though close sources say it’s still too early to tell where this story is headed, the internet isn’t waiting.

Travis Hunter’s two-way challenge could change game strategy

Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce has never been one to hold back his thoughts. But his latest comments on NFL rookie Travis Hunter are raising eyebrows across the league.

It’s about strategy.During a recent episode of the Bussin’ With The Boys podcast, Travis Kelce shared a strong warning about the unique role that Jacksonville Jaguars rookie Travis Hunter is expected to play. Travis Hunter, who was drafted as a two-way player, might face more than just double the workload, he could face double the target.Travis Kelce explained that if Travis Hunter lines up as a cornerback, opposing teams won’t just throw his way, they might run deep routes at him all game just to wear him out.Travis Kelce said.That warning is sparking debate: Will the Jaguars’ plan backfire if Travis Hunter becomes the focus of every offensive attack?Travis Hunter’s skillset is rare.

Terry Bradshaw rips Pittsburgh Steelers for Kenny Pickett “failure”: “They didn't even do anything to build around him”,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/terry-bradshaw-rips-pittsburgh-steelers-for-kenny-pickett-failure-they-didnt-even-do-anything-to-build-around-him/articleshow/122395497.cms,"Photo by Jamie Squire/Getty Images

Terry Bradshaw slams Steelers for trading Kenny Pickett, ignoring offensive line, and failing their first-round QB

Terry Bradshaw’s unapologetic critique of the Pittsburgh Steelers’ direction

NFL legend Terry Bradshaw isn’t exactly known for pulling punches, and this offseason he’s at it again—taking aim squarely at his old team, the Pittsburgh Steelers. Bradshaw believes the organization badly mishandled young quarterback Kenny Pickett, now with the Philadelphia Eagles, calling the decision to give up on him after just two seasons a prime example of systemic failure. In recent podcasts and interviews, he’s aired his frustration about Pittsburgh’s roster decisions, their treatment of Pickett, and even floated some biting takes about rumored replacements like Aaron Rodgers . When Bradshaw talks about quarterbacks, everyone listens—even if it ruffles some feathers.On a recent podcast this week (July 2025), Terry Bradshaw didn’t mince words describing how Pittsburgh jettisoned Kenny Pickett after just two seasons.“A first-rounder, got rid of him after two years,” Bradshaw said. “And they're still looking for a quarterback. They didn't even do anything to build around him.”That’s not the first time he’s sounded the alarm. Earlier this year, speaking with ESPN, Bradshaw made clear he thought the trade was a massive blunder.“I liked Kenny Pickett,” he said. “I liked him at Pitt. I know him. I know what he's like.”Bradshaw argues Pittsburgh never gave Pickett a real shot to succeed.“When they got him to Pittsburgh, they didn't protect him, they didn't get him an offensive line,” Bradshaw explained. “They wanted to run the football, but they didn't have an offensive line that could protect, and they didn't have weapons. He had no wide receivers to speak of.”He points out the irony that the Steelers finally invested in the offensive line after shipping Pickett to Philadelphia.“They throw a kid in there for two years, and you've got an offense that doesn't fit and doesn't work, and they can't run because their offensive line's not even good enough for a run-blocking team,” Bradshaw said. “Now, they're saying Kenny Pickett is a failure. He wasn't a failure. The Steelers were a failure.”When Pickett left Pittsburgh, he’d posted a 14-10 record as a starter, with 4,474 yards, 13 touchdowns and 13 interceptions. Meanwhile, backup Mason Rudolph stepped in and delivered a three-game win streak that secured a playoff spot—prompting the Steelers to move on from their former first-rounder.Pickett will now compete for the starting job with the Cleveland Browns this season, while Rudolph’s future in Pittsburgh remains uncertain.Bradshaw also didn’t hold back on another rumor swirling around Pittsburgh this offseason: the idea they’d sign Aaron Rodgers to be their next starter. He dismissed the idea as a “joke.” As for Bradshaw’s opinions? Love them or hate them, they’re hard to ignore. When Terry Bradshaw talks quarterbacks, he doesn’t sugarcoat it—and the Steelers might be wise to listen next time.Also Read: Jaylen Warren’s bold offseason overhaul could make him the Pittsburgh Steelers’ surprise RB1 in 2025","NFL legend Terry Bradshaw is taking aim at his old team, the Pittsburgh Steelers.

LeBron James was spotted at Bad Bunny’s concert



As speculation continues to swirl around LeBron James ’ future with the Los Angeles Lakers, the NBA icon has taken a different kind of spotlight, and it is not on the hardwood, but at a live concert. James was recently spotted attending Bad Bunny’s concert, drawing attention for his appearance as much as for the timing. With the Lakers facing uncertainty and pressure to reshape their roster, the four-time MVP's off-court activity is generating just as many headlines as any potential trade talk.LeBron James’ appearance at Bad Bunny’s concert grabbed immediate attention. In a series of videos shared on social media, James was seen having a splendid moment as he was dancing and having his favorite drinks.The NBA legend recently sent a message directly to the Puerto Rican music star, expressing his excitement for the performance. What made it especially intriguing was that James tweeted entirely in Spanish, which took fans by surprise and led to plenty of buzz online.""Benito! I'm at the Los Angeles airport right now, coming to see you! I heard about what you have planned for tomorrow night. Welcome!"" LeBron posted, referring to Bad Bunny’s real name, Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio.The post simply noted that he was at LAX.This comes during a pivotal offseason for the Lakers. LeBron opted into his contract for a 23rd NBA season, committing to at least one more year in Los Angeles. But the franchise still has work to do. They brought in Deandre Ayton to strengthen their frontcourt, but lost one of their top defenders in Dorian Finney-Smith. If the team wants to keep both LeBron and Luka Doncic happy and competing at the highest level, the front office will need to act fast before training camp opens.However, the buzz around the Lakers' veteran isn’t something any fan of the franchise would celebrate. It was rumored that James could be traded to the Golden State Warriors with his son, Bronny James, as the Lakers are looking to reshape their roster centering around Doncic and a young core.Also Read: LeBron James' Final Act?

San Jose Sharks bet on Jeff Skinner’s scoring touch and playoff experience to boost NHL rebuild

What Jeff Skinner’s signing means for the San Jose Sharks’ NHL future

On Friday, the San Jose Sharks signed veteran winger Jeff Skinner to a one-year, $3 million deal, hoping to tap into the scoring instincts and leadership he’s built over 15 NHL seasons. For Skinner, now 33, this move marks another dramatic turn in a career that began with Calder Trophy glory and stretched all the way to his long-awaited first Stanley Cup Playoff goal last year. He arrives in San Jose with 699 career points and the chance to be both a mentor and an impact scorer on a team hungry for improvement. It’s a fresh start that might just suit him perfectly.When the Carolina Hurricanes drafted Skinner seventh overall in 2010, their scouts saw “nobody in the draft that scores goals like Jeff Skinner.” He delivered instantly, winning the Calder Memorial Trophy as the league’s top rookie and earning a spot in the All-Star Game at 18—the youngest to play in it, a record he still holds. But along with that early promise came adversity: concussions interrupted strong seasons, yet Skinner kept finding ways to produce and lead. He eventually wore the alternate captain’s ‘A’ in Carolina and recorded multiple hat tricks, proving his resilience and goal-scoring pedigree. Jeff Skinner’s career took its next major turn in 2018 with a trade to the Buffalo Sabres. He quickly lit it up, becoming only the second player in franchise history to notch 20 goals before December and finishing with 40 on the season. That earned him an eight-year, $72 million extension. But over time—and after a coaching change—his role diminished, leading to a buyout announced by Buffalo on June 29, 2024.Just two days later, Skinner landed with the Edmonton Oilers, signing on July 1. He scored 16 goals during the 2024–25 regular season and, in a moment that showcased his patience paying off, finally broke through in the postseason. On May 29 in Dallas, he scored his first playoff goal during the Western Conference Final. “It’s special to finally get here, and to contribute means a lot,” he said that night.Now in San Jose, Skinner will try to recapture the form that made him one of the league’s top pure scorers. The Sharks are betting on his veteran savvy and willingness to embrace new roles, something he made clear last season when he said, “There’s always more you can do, more to give.”For a San Jose team searching for leadership and proven NHL scoring, Jeff Skinner’s signing offers both experience and the possibility of one last great chapter. Fans will be watching to see if this veteran sniper can deliver the goals—and guidance—that help the Sharks take meaningful steps forward. What do you think of this signing?

Tim Legler says Mavericks must prioritize fixing Cooper Flagg’s “sideways” shot rotation

What We Learned from Cooper Flagg’s 1st Summer League Game | ALL NBA PODCAST

The Dallas Mavericks came out on top, but Cooper Flagg left a somewhat mixed impression during his first game in Las Vegas. The No. 1 overall pick managed to score 10 points, pull down 6 rebounds, provide 4 assists, make 3 steals, and block one shot—yet he had a rough shooting night, hitting only 5-of-21, and he missed all five of his attempts from three-point range in their 87–85 win over the Los Angeles Lakers. Now, NBA insider Tim Legler is sounding the alarm about the rookie’s shooting form.Cooper Flagg's game was like two sides of a coin. He struggled with nerves at first, which hurt his offensive game, but he got it together towards the end of the first half, pulling off a stunning breakaway dunk, making some nice plays, and getting a key block, all while demonstrating his defensive talent and athletic ability. But as soon as the second half started, he went ice-cold—no points after halftime, despite having many chances.Legler, a former NBA three-point specialist who clinched the 1996 Three-Point Contest and had a career average of 43% from beyond the arc, didn’t hold back. He commended Flagg’s competitiveness, defense, ball handling, and court vision, but stressed that ongoing mechanical flaws, like the ball’s ""sideways rotation,"" could limit his shooting potential. If these issues aren’t addressed, he might remain a 20–30% three-point shooter—a ceiling that no top pick wants to hit.During the debriefs, Flagg was honest, admitting his outing was ""not up to my standard"" and calling it ""one of the worst games"" he's had. While this self-assessment shows his maturity, head coach Jason Kidd highlighted the good aspects. Kidd commended him for his confident ball control, making winning decisions under pressure, and maintaining his composure.Still, the numbers indicate why this concern is valid: in just over 32 minutes, Flagg managed to score 10 points on 5-for-21 shooting—going 0-for-5 from three-point territory—while also grabbing six rebounds, dishing out four assists, making three steals, and recording a block. The defensive pressure, including targeted double-teams, hastened his release and revealed issues with the structure of his jump shot.Also Read: Kevin Durant targets 20 year NBA career milestone after historic seven-team trade to Houston Rockets His shooting form needs some quick adjustments, particularly as NBA defenses become more challenging. With Tim Legler's keen eye on his release, the Mavericks have a strategy for enhancement. Little changes in his catch and dribble, combined with muscle memory and consistent practice, could reveal the jump shot that will make Flagg a true star—and turn his bright debut into the groundwork for an iconic career.","Tim Legler says Mavericks must prioritize fixing Cooper Flagg’s “sideways” shot rotation.

Boston Celtics’ rising talent steals spotlight with dominant win over Memphis Grizzlies in Summer League clash

Boston Celtics vs. Memphis Grizzlies | Full Game Highlights | 2K26 NBA Summer League

The Boston Celtics' young core stood out in a high-octane matchup against the Memphis Grizzlies on July 11 at the Pavilion in Las Vegas Summer League. The Celtics secured a 92-78 win over the Grizzlies and flexed their prowess for a top-notch and apparently future-proof roster that may land on the main roster in the coming days. The 14-point deficit was huge for the Grizzlies, and they were far from coming back to the game to lead.The Memphis Grizzlies struggled to find rhythm in their Las Vegas Summer League matchup, falling short against a more cohesive Boston Celtics squad. Despite a few bright spots in individual performances, the Grizzlies shot just 40.6% from the field and a disappointing 20.7% from beyond the arc, connecting on only 6 of their 29 three-point attempts. They also made just 64% of their free throws (16-of-25), which added to their offensive frustrations in a game they lost by a 14-point margin.GG Jackson led the Grizzlies with 16 points on an efficient 5-of-10 shooting. Jackson also added 4 rebounds and 2 assists in 29 minutes. Armando Bacot had a solid showing in the frontcourt with 7 field goals on 13 attempts, scoring 14 points and pulling down 6 rebounds. Cam Spencer was another bright spot, adding 15 points, 3 rebounds, and shooting a team-best 50% from three-point range.Jaylen Wells struggled with his shot, making just 3 of his 10 field goal attempts and going 2-of-7 from deep. However, he hit all five of his free throws and chipped in 3 rebounds, 3 assists, 2 steals, and 1 block. Zyon Pullin and Aaron Estrada also had quiet games, with Pullin scoring 5 points and Estrada adding 8 points off the bench. The Grizzlies committed 19 turnovers and 27 personal fouls, which stalled any chance of a comeback.On the other side, the Boston Celtics' Summer League squad delivered a strong performance in Las Vegas, securing a 92-point outing on balanced team play and energy on the boards. The team shot 40.5% from the field, connecting on 30 of 74 attempts, and hit 9 of their 28 shots from beyond the arc (32.1%). Though their free-throw shooting was uneven at 69.7%, Boston made up for it with hustle, grabbing 45 rebounds and sharing the ball well with 17 total assists.Hugo González led the charge with an all-around effort in 28 minutes. He scored 12 points on 4-of-12 shooting, including three triples, and dished out 5 assists while grabbing 4 rebounds. Jordan Walsh also stood out with 17 points on 50% shooting from the field and an efficient 3-of-6 from deep. Kenneth Lofton Jr. struggled with his shot, going just 1-of-8, but got to the line often and made 9 of his 10 free throws. He also contributed 11 points, 9 rebounds, and 2 assists.Charles Bassey delivered one of the most efficient showings of the game, hitting 7 of his 8 shots for 14 points and pulling down a team-high 11 rebounds in just under 19 minutes.Despite a rough shooting night (2-of-14), Baylor Scheierman filled the box score with 5 rebounds and 4 assists. Max Shulga added 3 assists and 3 rebounds off the bench, and Aman Williams scored 9 points on a perfect 3-of-3 from the field.

Kevin Durant becomes a Houston Rocket after NBA approves first ever seven team trade

Kevin Durant has stepped onto a fresh court in Houston, and his ambitions are more than just adding to his ring collection. Fresh from a huge seven-team trade, Durant revealed something interesting on the Mind the Game podcast with LeBron James and Steve Nash—he's not done yet. With 18 seasons under his belt, packed with MVPs, Finals wins, and 30,000 career points, The Slim Reaper is aiming to push his legacy to an extraordinary 20 NBA seasons. This alone has the basketball world intrigued.Kevin Durant officially became a member of the Houston Rockets when the NBA sanctioned the league's inaugural seven-team trade on July 6, 2025. The trade involved 13 players and a bunch of draft picks, some stretching all the way to 2032, among Phoenix, Atlanta, Brooklyn, Golden State, Minnesota, the Lakers, and Houston. Houston sent Jalen Green, Dillon Brooks, a variety of picks, and cap space to the Suns, while also reacquiring Clint Capela from Atlanta through a sign-and-trade.With Durant on board, the Rockets' youthful core, featuring Alperen Şengün, Amen Thompson, Jabari Smith Jr., Fred VanVleet, Steven Adams, Dorian Finney-Smith, and the returning Capela, gets even stronger. At 36 years old (born September 29, 1988), this 15-time All-Star and four-time scoring leader is joining a team fresh off a solid playoff run, now ready with a proven scorer to elevate their title hopes.In a frank discussion on Mind the Game, Durant shared that he’s not looking to add more trophies to his collection. His true goal is to play in the league for 20 years—a promise he refers to as ""a contract you’ve got to have with yourself.""Durant surpassed the 30,000 career points milestone and joined an elite club of eight NBA players to score more than 30,000 points. With two MVP awards, two Finals MVPs, four scoring titles, and four Olympic gold medals already under his belt, KD is now focusing on achieving a unique level of longevity in his professional career.Kevin Durant’s incredible switch to the Houston Rockets didn’t merely disrupt team rosters, it emphasized a personal ambition that few athletes dare to pursue: playing a complete 20 seasons.

Lakers’ Dilemma: Keep or Trade?

Knicks’ Cap Flexibility and Strategic Planning

A compelling NBA trade scenario is turning heads as speculation intensifies aroundsuperstarpotentially heading to the New York Knicks. Proposed by Dan Favale of Bleacher Report, the hypothetical swap would send Karl-Anthony Towns to Los Angeles in exchange for the four-time NBA champion.In a straight one-for-one trade that fits under the current collective bargaining agreement, Towns’ $53.1 million salary matches closely with LeBron James ’ $52.6 million for the 2025-26 season. The potential deal is drawing traction not just for its financial feasibility but also for its basketball implications.According to Favale, the trade could bring flexibility and much-needed star power to the Knicks’ roster: “Straight-up swapping Towns for LeBron would make the Knicks a lot older. So be it. New York still needs another ball-handler to consistently lighten its dependence on Jalen Brunson,” Favale wrote. (H/t: Dallas Hoops)This trade scenario gains further legitimacy considering the Knicks’ connections to LeBron. Team president Leon Rose is James’ former agent, and head coach Mike Brown previously coached him in Cleveland. With the Knicks reaching the Eastern Conference Finals last season for the first time since 2000, adding a veteran like LeBron James might be the final push they need.Here are the key reasons why this trade isn’t outlandish:- New York Ties: LeBron has a long-standing admiration for Madison Square Garden, calling it his favorite arena.- Prior Knicks Interest: He met with the Knicks during his 2010 free agency before signing with the Miami Heat.- Championship Aspirations: The Knicks haven’t won a title since 1973. LeBron’s arrival could shift that narrative.- Roster Fit: With Karl-Anthony Towns gone, the Knicks could restructure their big-man rotation with Mitchell Robinson and new addition Guerschon Yabusele.Despite his age, LeBron remains elite. Last season with the Lakers, he averaged:He also earned All-NBA Second Team honors and showed little sign of slowing down, solidifying his value even as he prepares to turn 41.As of now, the Los Angeles Lakers haven’t confirmed whether James has picked up his player option for next season. Until he does, the door remains open for trade talks. This uncertainty has added fuel to the Knicks rumors.Favale also points to the potential cap benefits for New York: “Give team president Leon Rose truth serum, and he might even tell you he appreciates the flexibility that the expiring contract of a soon-to-be 41-year-old LeBron would give the Knicks over the three seasons and $171.2 million owed to Towns.”A deal like this could allow the Knicks to reshape their future while contending in the short term. Even with Towns gone, the Knicks would retain a veteran-minimum slot to bolster their rotation.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers reportedly eyeing $33,075,000 Portland Trail Blazers star to bolster perimeter defense and improve title odds While this blockbuster trade remains hypothetical, all the pieces—from financial structure to long-standing relationships and roster fit—make it more than just fantasy.

LeBron James intrigued by the Los Angeles Lakers ' futuristic vision as trade season whispers grow louder



In the midst of swirling trade speculation and mounting questions about his future in Los Angeles, LeBron James ' longtime agent, Rich Paul , has finally addressed the rumors head-on. As the Lakers pivot toward a future built around Luka Doncic and new acquisitions like Deandre Ayton, James is reportedly taking a step back to evaluate where he fits into the franchise’s evolving blueprint. With just one season remaining on his contract, the four-time NBA champion finds himself at a career crossroads, and the tension between legacy and change is more real than ever.As the Los Angeles Lakers reshape their roster with an eye toward the next decade, LeBron James is facing the most uncertain offseason of his legacy-enriched career. While the addition of Luka Doncic has sparked hope for a bright future in Los Angeles, it’s also led to speculation that the franchise may be preparing for life after LeBron.In a revealing report by ESPN’s Shams Charania, James is said to believe the Lakers ""are more in a futuristic mindset,” adding that “some hard conversations will need to happen.” Though James recently picked up his $52.6 million player option for the 2025-26 season, the decision appears more about flexibility than finality.Speaking to Charania, Rich Paul commented on where James and his team stand amid the speculation.""We understand the difficulty in winning now while preparing for the future,"" Paul said. ""We do want to evaluate what's best for LeBron at this stage in his life and career. He wants to make every season he has left count, and the Lakers understand that, are supportive and want what's best for him.""Despite averaging 24.4 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 8.2 assists last season, James and the Lakers were bounced in the first round of the playoffs for the second straight year. As front office executives Rob Pelinka and JJ Redick reshape the roster around Doncic, James has remained notably quiet.The silence has only amplified speculation. According to ESPN’s Brian Windhorst, one Eastern Conference executive is ""convinced James wanted out of LA,” with teams like the Golden State Warriors actively exploring trade packages. A potential blockbuster deal could even include both LeBron and Bronny James heading to the Bay Area in exchange for young assets like Jonathan Kuminga and Moses Moody.Meanwhile, former teammate Udonis Haslem added fuel to the fire on ESPN’s NBA Today, joking about James joining Stephen Curry. “If chef cooking up something, I’m showing up for dinner. For sure. That’s for damn sure. If chef cooking, I’m showing.""Also Read: LeBron James' Final Act? Lakers Set the Stage for a Legendary Hollywood Farewell in 2026Whether James ultimately stays or joins forces with Curry for one last title push, James is all up for retaining his legacy and retiring like a king in his potentially final season.

But as Rich Paul bluntly said on ESPN, James “values a realistic chance of winning it all.”And if the Lakers can’t offer that, the King may be ready to move on.","LeBron James is reportedly taking a step back to evaluate where he fits into the Los Angeles Lakers' evolving blueprint.

Panthers push for three-peat with Marchand and Seth Jones; Mathew Tkachuk calls it ‘amazing’

Matthew Tkachuk Has Made Winning Stanley Cups Look Easy (Full Interview) | Stugotz

The Florida Panthers in order to retain core players like Sam Bennett, Aaron Ekblad, and Brad Marchand, successfully navigated salary cap challenges. Despite the potential to earn significantly more elsewhere, the team secured these players, with long-term, team-friendly contracts, influencing their championship success. Matthew Tkachuk expressed strong approval for these crucial roster moves.The Florida Panthers pulled off a magic trick with their team, keeping key players like Sam Bennett, Aaron Ekblad, and Brad Marchand even with a tight budget. How'd they do it? Their secret weapon, which convinced these guys to take a bit less money than they could've gotten elsewhere, was their winning spirit and two Stanley Cup championships.Aaron Ekblad, a top defenseman, signed an eight-year deal for $6.1 million a year. That's a steal when he could've easily charged over $10 million! And Sam Bennett followed suit, taking an $8 million AAV over eight years, turning down potential $10 million offers. Since both wanted to keep winning, they both chose to stay. Even Brad Marchand is sticking around for another six years at $5.33 million a year.Matthew Tkachuk, one of the Panthers' stars, even with the money crunch, was absolutely thrilled about these moves.When asked if he was upset about Marchand joining, he practically flared: ""I loved it. I knew that was a guy, with Seth Jones, who could put us over the hump. Now they’re here for the next five years — Marchy, six. Two culture guys and glue guys we’re lucky to have.""He even found it funny, inserting, ""No. I find it funny that hockey players want to stay in South Florida to play hockey — and will stay for less money. That’s amazing. It’s the greatest place to play in the NHL. Hopefully we’re not stopping at two.""It really indicates how much these players believe in the Panthers' winning formula and love playing in South Florida. Tkachuk himself is locked in for eight years at $76 million, and racking up points and helping them grab those two championships, he's been a huge part of their recent success.Also Read: “Just frustrating”: Ryan Reaves slams toxic Leafs fans, says they drove Mitch Marner out of Toronto after years of loyalty Being traded from the Calgary Flames, he's been with the Panthers for three seasons since in 2022.

Rangers may lose Artemi Panarin amid rising speculation and behind-the-scenes tensions



The New York Rangers are at a crossroads, and all eyes are on Artemi Panarin. Despite an impressive regular-season performance from the star forward, the Rangers missed the postseason — an outcome the front office is determined to prevent moving forward. But doing that while managing the salary cap and aging roster has presented a complex challenge, especially as Panarin’s eight-year, $81.5 million contract nears its end in 2026.Still producing at an elite level, Panarin notched 89 points last season, following a stellar 120-point campaign in 2023-24. Yet, at 33 years old, he remains both an invaluable asset and a financial question mark. The team’s top brass, led by President and GM Chris Drury, has shown a willingness to part ways with veteran contracts that no longer justify their price tag — most recently seen with the trades of Chris Kreider and Barclay Goodrow.While Arthur Staple of The Athletic reported that Panarin is considered “one of the team’s only untouchables,” his age and cap hit are hard to ignore. The team may be reluctant to commit to another long-term deal that could age poorly — especially with an eye on building a younger, faster core to remain competitive in the coming seasons.According to Bleacher Report’s Lyle Richardson, “The Rangers can afford to re-sign Panarin on a short-term deal with a slight pay cut to around $10 million annually.However, his future in New York could depend on the Blueshirts' performance in 2025-26. Another missed postseason could lead to his departure to a Stanley Cup contender next July.”This raises a strategic dilemma for New York. Letting Panarin hit free agency without compensation would be a major loss, given his consistent production — 37 goals and 52 assists last season alone. Trading him now could recoup assets but might also derail their postseason hopes. Extending him would keep one of the league’s top point producers, but at a potential long-term cost.There’s no question Panarin remains a game-changer. But the Rangers know the window to win with their current core is narrowing. Whether they choose to trade him, extend him, or let him walk, the decision will shape the team’s trajectory for years to come.The writing may already be on the wall, and one thing is certain — the Rangers can’t afford to wait until next July to decide Panarin’s fate.Also Read: Connor McDavid's patience tested as Oilers trade key prospect amid rising 2025-26 expectations","Rangers may lose Artemi Panarin amid rising speculation and behind-the-scenes tensions.

From promising NHL talent to international shame

Criminal charges and fallout from the team

Dillon Dubé, once a rising star in Canadian hockey, is now at the center of one of the most disturbing scandals the sport has seen in years. The 26-year-old forward, formerly with the Calgary Flames, is one of several NHL players charged in connection with the 2018 Hockey Canada sexual assault investigation — a case that has sent shockwaves through both the league and the public.Dubé, born July 20, 1998, in Golden, British Columbia, was once viewed as a promising young forward with strong leadership qualities. He captained Team Canada to gold at the 2018 World Junior Championships and was drafted 56th overall by the Calgary Flames in 2016. After breaking into the NHL in 2018, he became a regular in the Flames’ lineup and signed a three-year, $6.9 million extension in 2021.But his career took a dramatic turn in early 2024.On January 21, 2024, the Flames announced that Dubé was taking an indefinite leave to address mental health issues. Just days later, the shocking news broke: “Representative for Calgary's Dillon Dubé confirm to The Athletic he's been charged with sexual assault by London Police,” tweeted Ian Mendes on January 30.The London Police Service formally charged Dubé on February 5, 2024, for an alleged sexual assault that occurred in 2018 in London, Ontario.The Calgary Flames immediately issued a statement distancing themselves, noting they “had no knowledge of pending charges at the time Dillon's request for a leave of absence was granted.”By the end of the 2023–24 season, the Flames declined to extend a qualifying offer, making Dubé an unrestricted free agent. On July 1, 2024, he signed a one-year deal with HC Dinamo Minsk in the KHL — a clear sign of his exile from the NHL amid the legal proceedings.Also Read: Who is Cal Foote?
