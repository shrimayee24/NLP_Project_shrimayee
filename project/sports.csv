'Endured what happened to me but my sister ... ': Tej Pratap slams Jaichands for 'insulting' Rohini; Lalu family feud escalates,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/endured-what-happened-to-me-but-my-sister-tej-pratap-slams-jaichands-for-insulting-rohini-lalu-family-feud-escalates/articleshow/125399285.cms,"In a passionate outburst, Tej Pratap Yadav took aim at family members and RJD associates whom he branded as 'betrayers' for disrespecting his sister, Rohini Acharya. This vehement reaction came on the heels of Rohini's retirement from the political arena and ongoing family turmoil.

NEW DELHI: Tej Pratap Yadav on Monday again launched a strong attack on individuals within his family and RJD, accusing them of acting like “traitors” and warning that he would not accept any insult directed at his sister.His remarks come days after RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav ’s daughter Rohini Acharya announced her exit from politics and severed ties with the family, a move followed by three of her sisters reportedly leaving the Patna residence amid the escalating dispute.In a post on X, the Janshakti Tej Pratap wrote: “We will not tolerate any insult to our sister under any circumstances; the traitors will surely have to pay the price for this misconduct!”“The abuse that was done to our Rohini di by Jaichand, this incident has shaken my heart to the core. What happened to me, I have endured, but what happened to my sister — that insult is absolutely unacceptable under any circumstances. Listen, Jaichand, if you attack the family, the people of Bihar will never forgive you,” Tej Pratap added in his post.This marks the latest development in months of turmoil within the Yadav family, which saw Tej Pratap himself expelled from both the RJD and the family following a bitter dispute over his personal life.Earlier, on Sunday, following Rohini Acharya’s announcement, Tej Pratap shared an emotionally charged post on his party’s Instagram account, warning those he described as “traitors” and appealing directly to his father.“Yesterday’s incident has shaken me to the core. What happened to me — I endured it. But the insult done to my sister is absolutely unbearable under any circumstances. Listen, traitors— if you target our family, the people of Bihar will never forgive you. When the emotions of the people are wounded, the dust covering their judgment is blown away,” he wrote.He also accused them of influencing his brother Tejashwi’s political judgment.“These few faces have even clouded Tejashwi’s judgment. The consequences of this injustice will be extremely grave. Time’s reckoning is harsh,” he added.Also read: Nitish Kumar resigns as Bihar CM: Cabinet backs assembly dissolution; oath ceremony on Nov 20 The JJP chief also urged Lalu Prasad Yadav to intervene: “Father, give just one signal… just one gesture, and the people of Bihar themselves will bury these traitors. This is not a fight of any political party — it is a fight for the family’s honour, for the dignity of daughters, and for the self-respect of Bihar.”The controversy comes in the wake of Rohini Acharya’s social-media post on Sunday in which she alleged humiliation, abuse and expulsion from her parental home.She claimed she was “disgraced, abused, and even hit” after questioning the leadership over RJD’s poor performance in the Assembly elections.Rohini had named responsible for the family rift, claiming their actions prompted her decision to quit politics and leave her parents’ home.","In a passionate outburst, Tej Pratap Yadav took aim at family members and RJD associates whom he branded as 'betrayers' for disrespecting his sister, Rohini Acharya.

The Culmination

The painful truths

Investigative systems can fail, especially when constrained by corruption, negligence, or lack of urgency.

Evidence matters, but how it's collected — and whether due process is followed — can make or break a case.

Confession is a double-edged sword: powerful, but only if obtained fairly and documented properly.

NOIDA/NEW DELHI: For years, the narrow lanes of Nithari whispered the same story: children vanished, one after another, swallowed by a darkness no one could name.Inside D-5, where life seemed ordinary from the outside, investigators later uncovered fragments of a nightmare scattered through drains, courtyards and rooms that refused to give up their truth.Two decades on, Nithari remains less a crime scene and more a wound — a place where every unanswered question still walks the streets.The Nithari case remains one of country's most chilling and controversial serial-killing episodes. It centers around Bungalow D-5 in Nithari village, Noida and involves two men — the homeowner, Moninder Singh Pandher and his domestic helper, Surinder Koli The macabre tale that unfolded over years involved skeletal remains in drains, allegations of rape, murder, necrophilia, and organ trading — and a deeply flawed investigation that has haunted the judicial process for nearly two decades.The nightmare began in May 2006, when Nand Lal , father of a 22-year-old woman named Payal (also known as Deepika), reported her missing.Payal had visited Pandher’s bungalow D-5 in Sector 31, Nithari, allegedly to talk about a job for her brother — but she never returned.It was later reported that Koli had called her from a public phone booth.Despite the serious nature of the disappearance, the police response was strikingly delayed.According to a former investigator (then sub-inspector, later DSP), no FIR was registered for months.It was only after a court application under Section 156(3) of the CrPC, filed by Nand Lal, that an FIR was formally lodged on October 7, 2006 — nearly five months after Payal vanished.Things took a horrifying turn on December 29, 2006, when investigators discovered eight skeletal remains in a roadside drain next to the D-5 bungalow.This grim find, lead to the arrest of both Koli and Pandher. Within days, more bone fragments were unearthed in and around the drainage system.The discovery shook the nation and exposed the full extent of what had been a series of missing persons — children and young women — in and around Nithari.The initial investigation by the Uttar Pradesh Police came under criticism almost immediately. According to the first investigator, crucial delays had allowed the case to spiral: The FIR was filed only after months of pressure, and formal search operations began six months too late.These early lapses, he said, sowed the seeds of deeper problems.By January 10, 2007, due to mounting public outrage and the scale of the horror, the case was handed over to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).Within days, CBI teams conducted intensive searches around the bungalow and adjoining areas, recovering more human remains — skulls, bone pieces and dismembered body parts.The sheer scale of recovered remains made it difficult even for the investigators to determine how many victims there might have been.In the early months of the investigation, charge sheets were filed in 16 cases, spanning accusations of murder, rape, abduction, criminal conspiracy, destruction of evidence and more.On March 1, 2007, Koli made a highly detailed recorded confession.He reportedly admitted to murdering six children and one woman. He described luring them into the bungalow, strangling them, sexually abusing the bodies, dismembering them and discarding the remains in drains.He also made claims of cannibalism, stating that he sometimes cooked and ate flesh from the victims.The case proceeded in a special CBI court in Ghaziabad, and on February 13, 2009, both Koli and Pandher were sentenced to death in the first case.The trial court would go on to deliver verdicts over many years, across multiple hearings, more than 2,000 hearings were held during this prolonged trial.Koli was eventually convicted in 13 cases by the trial court and awarded death sentences in all, though one of these was commuted to life imprisonment.In a later case (May 2022), a special CBI court awarded him another death sentence for the rape and murder of a woman.While the trial court’s judgments were gruesome and seemed to close the case, the story was far from over.On September 11, 2009, the Allahabad high court delivered a big verdict: While upholding Koli’s death sentence, it acquitted Pandher in at least one prominent case, citing “no evidence” against him.Over time, Koli’s legal team mounted a fierce appeal. On October 16, 2023, in a landmark decision, the Allahabad high court acquitted Koli in 12 of the death-sentence cases and Pandher in two, overturning the trial court’s verdicts.The court did not mince words: It stated that the investigation had been botched up and that “basic norms of collecting evidence were brazenly violated.”A particularly scathing point in the high court’s judgment was the failure to probe possible organ trade — an angle raised by a high-level committee from the Ministry of Women and Child Development.Investigators, the court said, “opted for the easy course” by pinning blame on Koli and demonising him, instead of exploring deeper and more alarming conspiracies.The court also questioned the credibility of Koli’s confession. It noted procedural irregularities: the confession was allegedly recorded 60 days into police remand, yet there was no medical examination or independent witness.Moreover, the court highlighted contradictions in prosecution testimony about where and when the confession was made.Recovery of skeletal remains, according to the court, came from a drain outside the boundaries of Pandher’s house — not from inside, as had often been claimed.Ultimately, the court declared that the guilt of Koli and Pandher had not been proved beyond reasonable doubt, particularly because the case rested largely on circumstantial evidence.The judgment drew sharp criticism from victim families, who saw it as a deep betrayal after nearly two decades of pursuing justice.Following the high court’s 2023 acquittal, Moninder Singh Pandher was released from Luksar Jail on October 20, 2023, after spending 14 years behind bars.Surinder Koli, meanwhile, was not immediately freed — he continued to serve a life sentence in a separate conviction.But his legal fight was not over.In July 2025, the Supreme Court upheld the Allahabad HC’s acquittal of Koli in the 12 previously overturned cases. The apex court ruled that police lapses had rendered crucial evidence inadmissible.Then, on November 11, 2025, in a decisive moment, the Supreme Court accepted Koli’s curative plea (his last judicial recourse), acquitted him in the final pending case (Rimpa Haldar case) and ordered his immediate release.The man once dubbed the “Nithari killer” has now been acquitted in all major Nithari murder cases.When word of his acquittal reached his barrack, Koli had remained seated for some time, staring at the floor. Then a faint smile crossed his face. “He was relaxed, and there was a smile on his face,” a senior jail official told TOI.While Koli did give a detailed confession, the courts later scrutinised the conditions of its recording, It came long into police custody, without independent witnesses, and with no medical examination — casting shadows on its voluntariness and authenticity.Perhaps most damning was the court’s assertion that organ trade – a horrifying, but plausible, motive – was not properly probed.The investigation, according to the HC, seemed to choose the less difficult path of blaming a single man rather than confronting possible organised crime.One sacked officer, Simranjeet Kaur was arrested by the CBI in 2007 for allegedly framing false records to protect Pandher and Koli, having received payments.The mysterious death of a key witness, Jatin Sarkar, whose daughter was among the missing. His body was later found in a pond in Bengal.Parents of missing children watched as time passed with no clear answers. The high court’s 2023 acquittals were met with “dejection” by many, signaling that legal closure did not equal emotional closure.The community around Nithari, once traumatised by the gruesome revelations, still remembers the D-5 bungalow as a somber landmark.The Supreme Court’s acquittal in the 13th, and final, case against Koli left the families devastated.A 63-year-old Jhabbu Lal and his wife Sunita (60) continued seeking justice for their daughter Jyoti — one of the children who went missing in 2006 and was later found among the Nithari victims.“I had six children, and the fifth was Jyoti. She went missing in 2006,” Lal recalled, his voice shaking. “Her body was later found in the drain outside house number D5 (Moninder Pandher's bungalow where Koli worked).”Lal spent decades fighting in courts, selling valuables and even a house in Sangam Vihar, Delhi, to fund the case.Lal said, “If he didn’t commit the crime, then who did? If he is freed, that means someone else killed our children. Why was Koli kept behind bars for so many years?”Sunita Lal added, “Even after all these years, the pain hasn’t faded. Every time I pass that bungalow, it feels like I’m standing at the same place where my world ended. We never got our child back — only the memories and a lifetime of waiting for justice.”Another mother of a deceased said ""Moninder (Moninder Singh Pandher) and Surinder Koli, killed so many children. But the case is not being done anything about. Who is guilty now? Was there a ghost in that house which killed all children? They used to kill children and indulge in organ trafficking. Now they say that they are innocent. Law is letting them go; God won't.""When the Supreme Court finally granted his curative petition in November 2025 and ordered his immediate release, it marked the end of a long, fraught journey.The ruling underscored deep flaws in the original investigation: procedural lapses, contested confessions and weak evidence.Moninder Pandher, too, walked free earlier when the high court acquitted him.It was noted that during his release in October 2023, Pandher was frail, battling health issues including tuberculosis.The bungalow D-5, once infamous, now lies overgrown and decaying — a ghostly testament to the violence that took place there.Even when courts finally render a verdict, emotional justice may remain elusive for victims and their families.The Nithari killings case, is more than a crime story; it is a mirror to systemic failures, a cautionary tale about investigative hubris, and a study in how the quest for justice can stretch over decades.The courtroom battles — convictions, acquittals and final release — have reshaped public memory of D-5 bungalow.But the wounds remain: for the families who lost children, for a village scarred by horror, and for a nation forced to reckon with how easily its systems can be outpaced by darkness.","Nithari case remains one of country's most chilling and controversial serial- killing episodes. It centers around Bungalow D-5 in Nithari village, Noida and involves two men — the homeowner, Moninder Singh Pandher and his domestic helper, Surinder Koli. The macabre tale that unfolded over years involved skeletal remains in drains, allegations of rape, murder, necrophilia, and organ trading.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125365659,imgsize-46652,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/-.jpg"

Insult meted out to my sister is intolerable: Tej Pratap

PATNA/NEW DELHI: RJD patriarch Lalu Prasad's daughter Rohini Acharya's outburst at her brother Tejashwi Yadav and his close associates for ""abusing"" and ""throwing"" her out of home is snowballing into a full-blown family feud and hints at increasing internal rumblings over the decisions of the party's anointed heir after its bid for office unravelled spectacularly in the assembly polls.As she dropped another bombshell on Sunday by saying she was dissed for donating her ""dirty kidney"" to Lalu and was accused of extracting crores of rupees and a Lok Sabha ticket, three of her sisters - Ragini, Chanda and Rajlakshmi - left their parents' Patna residence.Their brother Tej Pratap Yadav, disowned by his father and ousted from the party last year, spoke up against Rohini's ""humiliation"".Lalu, his younger son and political heir Tejashwi and other family members have maintained silence, an indication of the division and conflicted emotions within. The party too has kept mum.Some party leaders suggested that differences among the siblings have long been simmering as Tejashwi took firmer control of the party and leaned on a set of advisers loyal to him to run its affairs. That arrangement has come up for questioning.But the Bihar assembly poll debacle has opened up this style of functioning to questioning. Rohini said everybody is wondering what fate has befallen RJD, a party that governed Bihar between 1990 and 2005.Tej Pratap said in a social media post, ""Yesterday's incident has shaken me. But the insult meted out to my sister is intolerable.""I tolerated whatever happened to me but her humiliation cannot be tolerated under any condition... The consequence of this injustice will be very dire.""He accused 'Jaichands' (betrayers), widely believed to be a reference to a couple of Tejashwi's close associates, including Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Yadav, of targeting the Yadav family. Appealing to Lalu, he said, ""Just one nod, and the people of Bihar will bury these Jaichands themselves. This fight is not for any party; it is for the honour of the family, the dignity of the daughter, and the self-respect of Bihar.""As the family fallout played out, TV footage showed three more daughters of Lalu's reaching Patna airport with their children to catch a flight, reportedly for Delhi. None of them spoke to the media. Incidentally, their departure came hours after Rohini advised women to ""look after your in-laws and families and take care of your children"" rather than parents.""I would tell all married women never to do anything to save their parents, and if they have a brother, they should ask him to donate his own kidney or ask his Haryanavi friend to do so,"" she said in an emotional post. She said she had committed a blunder by not obtaining permission from her husband and in-laws and not thinking about the future of her three children before donating a kidney to her father.Earlier, she alleged she was humiliated and abused, and a slipper was lifted to hit her. She said her parents, Lalu and Rabri Devi, both former CMs, were crying and blamed Sanjay Yadav and Rameez Nemat Khan, who hails from Uttar Pradesh and is said to be Tejashwi's friend, for her ""fate"".She named her brother too but directed most of her anger at his two associates.The developments followed RJD's disastrous performance in the just-held assembly elections in Bihar, in which the party could win only 25 seats after contesting 143. Tejashwi was officially projected as MGB's chief ministerial candidate.Meanwhile, the JD(U) asked Lalu to explain the developments and act. ""She is the daughter of entire Bihar, then why are you silent, Lalu ji... Please break your silence,"" JD(U) spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said.","Rohini Acharya's outburst at her brother Tejashwi Yadav is snowballing into a full-blown family feud.

‘Misa-Priyanka Ko Dickey Mein…’: Yashwant Deshmukh’s Message to RJD–Cong After NDA’s Bihar Win

High votes, low wins: The big contradiction



Contest more seats



NDA's math clicked, MGB's math cracked



JD(U)'s comeback flipped the story



BJP grows bigger than ever



MGB slipped because allies didn't deliver



Jan Suraaj and AIMIM changed the margins



So, what really happened?



NEW DELHI: Bihar's 2025 election results threw up a story full of surprises. Tejashwi Yadav 's RJD turned out to be the party with highest vote share in the state, yet it ended up with one of its lowest seat tallies ever. On the other hand, the NDA kept the power with landslide victory, clinching over 200 seats in 243-member assembly, keeping the Mahagathbandhan far from the seat of government.RJD recorded a vote share of around 23 per cent, just few decimals down from 2020, when it got 23.11 and emerged as the largest party with 75 seats. But this time, that same level of popularity translated into just 25 seats. So the striking question is: how can a party get the most votes, yet finish with so few seats?The answer lies in how votes were spread. RJD seems to have polled a large number of second-position votes. It remained popular, but not with enough concentrated support in winning zones.In simple terms, RJD got votes but not victories. This is no surprise in India's electoral mechanism of 'First Past the Post System.'RJD contested 143 seats this time, the highest among all parties across both the NDA and the Mahagathbandhan. In the 2020 assembly elections, the Lalu-led party had fielded one more candidate, contesting 144 seats.Contesting widely helped the party accumulate more total votes, contributing to the highest vote share. But losing candidates also add to vote share totals.Meanwhile, BJP and JD(U) fought on 101 seats each. They contested fewer seats but converted their votes efficiently into victories. That is why their seat count shot up, even with a lower vote share than RJD.A major turning point this election was the return of Chirag Paswan's LJP (Ram Vilas) to the NDA camp. In 2020, the LJP had hurt the NDA's chances by cutting into its votes, but this time its support helped strengthen the alliance instead of splitting it.In the previous election, LJP (RV) was unhappy with the NDA's seat-sharing formula in Bihar. Even though it was part of the alliance at the Centre, Chirag Paswan chose to go solo in the state and contested 134 seats, which ended up damaging NDA numbers—especially Nitish Kumar 's JD(U).Similarly, Upendra Kushwaha's party contested 104 seats independently in 2020, further cutting into votes that could have benefitted the NDA.This time, with both LJP (RV) and Kushwaha’s RLM back in the NDA fold, the alliance appeared far more united, organised, and prepared. The result: NDA outperformed the Mahagathbandhan by a wide margin.One of the biggest turnarounds happened in seats where RJD and JD(U) were in direct fight.In 2020, RJD dominated these contests. But in 2025, JD(U) turned the tables and won 50 out of 59, almost wiping out RJD in head-to-head battles. JD(U)'s vote share also jumped from 15.39 percent in 2020 to 19.25 percent this time, helping it win 85 seats from the tally of 43 last time.RJD simply failed to see this drastic reversal coming.The BJP crossed 89 seats, its highest tally ever in Bihar, marking a historic leap for a party that once had almost no grassroots base or ideological legacy in the state. By staying aligned for years with ""sushasan babu"" and steadily expanding its footprint, the saffron party has now grown into Bihar's biggest political force.With this mandate, the BJP has effectively redrawn the political map of Bihar. It now sits at the centre of power, holding the strongest bargaining position in the alliance. For years, Nitish Kumar played the ""big brother"" to the BJP, but for the second election in a row, the BJP has outperformed the JD(U), this time doing so with its best-ever numbers.The shift isn't just about arithmetic -- it's psychological. For decades, Bihar's political story revolved around the Lalu–Nitish axis. Today, it revolves around the BJP’s weight, influence and negotiating power.Unlike NDA, the Mahagathbandhan struggled with coordination and clarity.Congress contested on 61 seats as compared to last time's 70, but won only six. The Left parties, which surprised everyone in 2020, could not repeat their performance either. Seat-sharing disagreements and confusing ""friendly fights"" meant votes did not transfer smoothly within the alliance.The opposition was visible but not united -- and unity decides tight contests.Prashant Kishor's much-talked about startup -- Jan Suraaj did not open its account, but it made a strategic dent, in at least 35 seats, its vote share was higher than the winning margin, influencing outcomes for both alliances.Meanwhile, AIMIM repeated its strong Seemanchal performance, winning five seats with 1.85 percent of votes and signalling a shift in political thinking among Muslim voters.The traditional Muslim–Yadav (MY) vote base of the RJD showed signs of fragmentation, with Muslim voters exploring alternative platforms in multiple constituencies, leading to a near wipeout of the Mahagathbandhan in Seemanchal, barring one Congress candidate who scraped through.Mayawati's BSP also registered a presence, securing 1.62% of the total vote share with one seat in the west.RJD did not lose popularity, but lost positional advantage. It remained a strong choice for many voters but could not cross the finishing line often enough. High vote share created the impression of strength, but seats reflect actual power -- and that is where NDA towered above everyone.","RJD recorded a vote share of around 23 per cent, just few decimals down from 2020. But this time, that same level of popularity translated into just 25 seats. RJD seems to have polled a large number of second-position votes.

Candace Owens explains her list of “verifiable lies” told after Charlie Kirk’s assassination



Image via Candace/Podcast

She said the first lie was the story that Mikey McCoy had “blood all over him.” She said this story was made up and was told by Pastor Rob McCoy.

The second lie, she said, came from Alex Clark and Andrew Kolvet. She said they pushed a story that Charlie Kirk was a “committed evangelical” who only liked Catholic buildings. Candace Owens said this was not true.

The third lie was a strange story that Charlie Kirk’s “strong bones” stopped a 30-06 bullet. She said Andrew Kolvet pushed this and that it made no sense.

The fourth lie, she said, was the claim that Charlie “never blinked” in his support for Israel. Candace Owens said this was not true.

For the fifth lie, she said TPUSA told people that Mikey McCoy first called his dad during the crisis. Owens said this story was also false.

The sixth lie was about Terryl Farnsworth, the AV worker. She said TPUSA claimed police told him to remove cameras. Candace Owens said her video review shows this did not happen.

The seventh lie was the claim that Farnsworth moved SD cards because “people were stealing them.” She said this made no sense because SD cards are cheap and cameras are expensive.

The eighth lie came from Alex Clark, who said there was “no bad blood” between Ben Shapiro and Charlie Kirk. Owens said that was “propaganda.”

The ninth lie was that TPUSA’s yearly audits proved nothing odd. Candace Owens said this was misleading because Doge worked differently from normal TPUSA work.

The tenth lie was calling Mikey McCoy a “hero.” Candace Owens said this was not fair because he did not call 911 right away.

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce ripped apart for ‘clueless’ fashion choices during NYC date night

More coverage on NFL:

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce may be one of the most talked-about celebrity couples of the decade, but even their status and their bank accounts can't shield them from fashion criticism. During their recent date night at New York City’s exclusive Zero Bond, the pair stepped out in designer looks that should have been effortless wins.Yet social media users were quick to pounce, questioning whether the two style icons were having an off night or simply leaning too hard into their signature quirks. While Swift’s rose-embroidered tights and wrap miniskirt drew plenty of attention, Kelce’s relaxed burgundy ensemble raised eyebrows too. Their outfits, worth thousands, became instant conversation starters and not necessarily for the reasons they hoped.Swift arrived in a textured wrap miniskirt, twisted-collar knit top, and knee-high Louis Vuitton boots, a look elevated by a gold-chained Coussin bag, simple jewelry, and her signature red lip. Her black Fleur De Mal hosiery, embroidered with roses and styled with a long braid detail, ended up being the focal point of online debate.Kelce’s coordinated burgundy bomber jacket and loose trousers, paired with gold chains and black boots, completed the duo’s coordinated aesthetic.But critics didn’t hold back. One person wrote, “They seriously have no fashion sense. Matchy matchy like they bought whatever was on the mannequin.” Another jabbed at their wealth, saying, “They would think that with all that money, they would shop somewhere other than the Goodwill Store for clothing.” Others chimed in about Swift’s predictable favorites: “Her dress sense is terrible. Always a short skirt and long boots. So boring and predictable.” Another commenter couldn’t resist aiming at Kelce: “Does he get dressed in the dark?”Despite the commentary, Swift’s fashion influence continues to dominate pop culture. From plaid skirts inspired by her Folklore era to the red tights she wears on game days, her style reaches fans who admire the mix of high-end, vintage, and approachable trends. Her generosity also stands out, such as when she gifted young fan Naya the full Miu Miu outfit she wore during their hospital meeting, turning fashion into a meaningful connection.Kelce, meanwhile, has his own evolving style journey, sometimes shaped or criticized by Swift’s influence. But together, the couple walks with unshakable confidence. Whether fans love or hate their looks, Swift and Kelce prove one thing: fashion is most powerful when it reflects who you are, not who people expect you to be.","Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s latest NYC date night ignited online backlash as critics mocked their designer outfits.

Rebel Tanea Brooks’ sudden absence from AEW television had puzzled fans for months, especially after Britt Baker’s rise changed the dynamics on screen. What many did not know was that Rebel, a former Dallas Cowboys cheerleader and well known AEW personality, had been quietly fighting a private battle. On November 16, that silence ended when she revealed a heartbreaking health update that showed how much she had been carrying behind the scenes.In an Instagram post, the 47 year old announced that she has been diagnosed with lung cancer. She shared the news with honesty, emotion, and a clear request to her supporters. “Health update,” wrote Rebel Tanea in the caption of the post. “Asking for your prayers and support 🙏🏼. I hope to keep you updated in my rehab journey. #lymphoma #cancer #nonhodgkinslymphoma #lungs #fnd #css #mycobacteriumabscessus #rebel. ” Her message set the tone for a video where she explained the long chain of struggles she has been facing.In the video, Rebel revealed that she would begin rehab on November 17 while also managing another serious condition. She explained that she has Functional Neurological Disorder, which has affected her mobility in ways she never expected.“Along this tumultuous journey, I picked up a little disorder called functional neurological disorder, and it has taken my ability to walk,” said Rebel Tanea. “I now walk with a walker. And my ability to speak clearly. I think you can tell, but it sounds like I bit my tongue. And I have also lost the ability… or function, I guess I should say, of my right hand, and I have kind of like a claw hand.”Even with these challenges, she has continued to push forward. She recently suffered an arm injury and is currently dealing with an infection, which requires IV antibiotics before any cancer treatment can begin. She described rehab as “a full-time job,” yet her voice carried determination.The most emotional moment came when she confirmed that she is battling Primary Pulmonary Lymphoma, a rare form of lung cancer. Earlier in May 2024, doctors had misdiagnosed her with Cryptococcal pneumonia. After months of infections, ruptures, and failed treatments, she turned to the Mayo Clinic. “And after a year of not getting better, I decided to go to the Mayo Clinic and see if I could get treated by them,” said Rebel Tanea. “And they found that it was not Cryptococcal pneumonia this whole time, and that is primary pulmonary lymphoma, which is cancer in the lungs, and if there’s a best-case scenario, then I have it, so that’s good.”She now awaits a third bronchoscopy in December to determine whether she will begin radiation or immunotherapy. Despite the uncertainty, Rebel thanked her fans and promised to keep them close on her journey forward.","Rebel Tanea Brooks announced that she has been diagnosed with lung cancer.

Interest grows inside the Steelers community as WAGs admit they still haven’t met Aaron Rodgers’ wife

More coverage on NFL:

Aaron Rodgers has brought plenty of intrigue to Pittsburgh this season, and surprisingly, not all of it has to do with football. As the 41-year-old quarterback leads the Steelers through a competitive AFC North race, fans and teammates alike have been buzzing about something completely unrelated to passing yards or touchdowns, the identity of his elusive wife, Brittani.Rodgers stunned the NFL world earlier this year when he casually revealed he got married “a couple months ago,” yet offered no details about the ceremony or his spouse. Months into the season, the mystery remains unsolved, turning Brittani into one of the most talked-about topics around the Steelers’ facility.Rodgers’ performance this season has been strong, with 1,853 passing yards and 18 touchdowns, helping the Steelers sit atop the AFC North with a 5-4 record. But while fans are focused on his comeback and playoff push, those close to the team say an entirely different curiosity is dominating conversations behind the scenes.Rodgers was first spotted wearing a wedding band during his inaugural practice with the Steelers, confirming rumors that he’d tied the knot shortly before joining the team. Since then, however, his wife has remained completely absent from public view, no game appearances, no social media presence, no accidental sightings.According to one unidentified Steelers WAG who spoke to the Daily Mail, “She’s like a phantom. We all want to meet her, to invite her out, get to know her. But we haven’t met her yet. We don’t even know who she is.”Rodgers has long been one of the league’s most private and polarizing stars, so it isn’t shocking that he and Brittani are choosing to stay out of the spotlight. The quarterback is no stranger to intense media scrutiny, and protecting his relationship may be a deliberate attempt to keep a part of his life untouched by the chaos of NFL fame.Still, with Rodgers thriving on the field, curiosity around the couple continues to grow. And unless Rodgers decides to share more, Brittani’s identity may remain one of the NFL’s most persistent and fascinating mysteries, one that even the Steelers’ own WAGs can’t crack.","The identity of Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers' wife, Brittani, remains an enigma.

Is Victor Wembanyama alright?



What Victor Wembanyama’s absence from the court means for the San Antonio Spurs



The San Antonio Spurs were riding one of their strongest starts in recent memory, fueled by Victor Wembanyama’s explosive third-year leap. That momentum came to a sudden halt after the team confirmed the 21-year-old star had suffered a left calf strain, an injury that will keep him out for at least a few weeks.It’s a setback that hits the franchise at a time when Wembanyama was not only anchoring their surge up the standings but emerging as an early MVP contender. With San Antonio sitting comfortably in the upper tier of the Western Conference, his absence forces the team to recalibrate both expectations and rotations.The injury occurred during Friday’s matchup against Golden State, a game Wembanyama finished with 26 points and 12 rebounds despite discomfort. He was ruled out ahead of Sunday’s win over Sacramento, and further testing confirmed the team’s fears. For a player who has already dealt with significant setbacks in his young career, including last season’s lengthy layoff, this latest development places added pressure on a Spurs roster that leans heavily on his two-way production.The Spurs insist they are taking a cautious path, and early indications suggest the injury isn’t season-threatening.“Obviously, we’ve seen around this league recently, the calf-tightness thing is not something you want to take lightly,” Spurs coach Mitch Johnson said.“Don’t want to push it there.” Wembanyama underwent an MRI over the weekend, with the team revealing the left calf strain on Monday. ESPN reported he will be reevaluated in two to three weeks.Wembanyama’s numbers before the injury underline why the organization is proceeding carefully. He has averaged just over 26 points, nearly 13 rebounds, and a league-leading block rate while playing 35 minutes per game.Replacing Wembanyama’s impact on both ends is nearly impossible. Without him, the Spurs lose their focal point on offense and their most imposing defensive presence. Luke Kornet stepped in as the starting center Sunday and delivered a solid outing, while Kelly Olynyk is expected to absorb expanded minutes. Still, neither replicates the spacing, rim protection, or versatility Wembanyama provides.San Antonio must also monitor the ripple effects. The team is already dealing with a hip injury to Stephon Castle, further thinning the rotation. De’Aaron Fox and the bench unit will shoulder greater scoring and creation duties as the Spurs try to maintain their early-season pace.Also Read: Draymond Green confronts taunting fan after Angel Reese jeers push tensions to a boiling point","Victor Wembanyama has been ruled out for at least a few weeks with a left calf strain.

Toronto Maple Leafs head coach Craig Berube hints Matthews may be behind schedule



More NHL coverage

Toronto Maple Leafs fans hoped this stretch of the season would bring clarity, but Craig Berube’s latest update has only raised more questions. The coach revealed that Auston Matthews may be further behind in his recovery than anyone expected. His comments have shifted the mood in Toronto, especially with the team already battling uneven form and a crowded injured list. The Leafs had counted on a quick turnaround for their superstar. Instead, the timeline looks blurry and the concern is growing by the day.Matthews has been sidelined since suffering a lower-body injury in the November 11 meeting with the Boston Bruins. Berube initially estimated that the forward would miss about a week, and the team placed him on injured reserve shortly after. That move meant Matthews could return by November 18 against the St. Louis Blues, but that target now appears doubtful. TSN’s Mark Masters reported that Berube told media on November 17 that Matthews has not even touched the ice since exiting the Bruins game. The coach did say a return against the Blues was still possible, but the tone surrounding the update has left fans uneasy.The forward’s injury history adds weight to this concern. He already missed significant time earlier in the 2024-25 season with an upper-body issue, continuing a trend that has limited him throughout his career.Matthews has played at least 75 regular-season games just once since his rookie year in 2016-17. With Toronto sliding near the bottom of the Atlantic Division after 19 games, Masters’ report triggered strong reactions online. Some fans even responded by saying the team should “throw in the towel” on the season, a stark shift from the preseason optimism that came with top-ten Stanley Cup odds.Complicating matters, Matthews is only one of several key players on injured reserve. Chris Tanev, Brandon Carlo, Anthony Stolarz, and Scott Laughton are all sidelined, and Nicolas Roy is set to miss the matchup against St. Louis as well. That leaves the Leafs relying on a thin center group of John Tavares, Max Domi, Jacob Quillan, and Steven Lorentz. Quillan has just one NHL game, while Lorentz had 19 points in 80 games last season.Even so, the Leafs cannot pin everything on injuries. The roster lacks depth, and the front office is weighing roster-for-roster trades rather than dealing prospects. Elliotte Friedman recently said the team is open to offers for nearly every player except William Nylander, Matthew Knies, Matthews, and Tavares. How the team navigates this stretch may define the rest of their season.",Auston Matthews has not played since suffering a lower-body injury on November 11.

Jose Altuve’s foot procedure adds an offseason wrinkle for the Astros



How Jose Altuve’s health shapes Houston’s roster outlook



The Houston Astros entered the offseason with the sting of missing the 2025 MLB playoffs still fresh. Their postseason streak had stretched across eight straight years, producing two championships and cementing the franchise as one of baseball’s modern powerhouses. That run ended this fall, leaving the club facing pointed questions about whether the window that once seemed wide open is starting to narrow. At the center of that discussion is Jose Altuve, the longest-tenured Astro and the face of the team’s recent dominance.Altuve completed his 15th season in Houston showing the kind of durability and competitiveness that has defined his career. He appeared in 155 games at age 35 and remained a productive bat, even as his numbers reflected a player pushing through discomfort. Now, as the Astros begin shaping their plans for 2026, the team is processing new health news surrounding their cornerstone second baseman.Early in the offseason, word emerged that Jose Altuve underwent a minor procedure on his right foot. According to Brian McTaggart of MLB.com, “Astros second baseman Jose Altuve, who was bothered by a sore right foot in the final two weeks of the regular season, underwent a minor skin aspiration Monday, a source told MLB.com.“He will be ready for the start of Spring Training.” McTaggart added, “Altuve had a procedure to remove fluid from a wound between his fourth and fifth toes on his right foot, the source said.”The injury dates back to September 13 against Atlanta, when Altuve was pulled from a game with discomfort and remained out the following night. Still, he played through the issue as Houston fought to stay alive in the playoff race.Once the Astros were eliminated, he finally sat. Even then, his competitive edge showed in flashes. Over his final 22 plate appearances, he posted a .353 average and a .500 on-base percentage, a reminder of the offensive spark he can still provide.Altuve’s surgery is not expected to delay his spring training readiness, but it arrives at a complicated moment for Houston. His overall production dipped in 2025, as he hit .265 with the lowest full-season on-base percentage he has posted in more than a decade. The Astros have also wrestled with how to manage his defensive role. They experimented with him in left field, hoping the short porch could mask range limitations, but manager Joe Espada ultimately returned him to second base.The challenge is that Houston lacks a clear internal replacement. Brice Matthews flashed promise but struck out at a high rate. Mauricio Dubón offers defense but not consistent offense, and his projected salary complicates the evaluation. Ramón Urías, meanwhile, struggled after the trade deadline. Those realities leave Altuve as the primary option for now, though the team remains linked to external possibilities such as Brendan Donovan or Brandon Lowe.Also Read: Javier Báez's wife Irmarie posts a touching tribute to her late mother, receiving warm reactions from MLB partners","Houston Astros second baseman Jose Altuve underwent a minor procedure on his right foot.

Ben Rortvedt thanks fans for standing by him during a tough period



Ben Rortvedt’s move from the Dodgers to the Cincinnati Reds may look like a routine roster change, but for him, it came with honest emotions. After the Reds picked him up, the catcher shared a warm message for Dodgers fans, thanking them for their support during a time when he was trying to adjust and find his place. His note showed how much he valued the people who watched him play, even though his role with the team often changed and he had to work through tough stretches.For Rortvedt, the goodbye wasn’t just about leaving a clubhouse, it was about appreciating the fans who made his short stay in Los Angeles meaningful. His time with the Dodgers came with challenges, including shifting responsibilities and limited chances to play. But the support he felt from the stands and on social media helped him stay steady. His message made it clear that even in a big market where expectations are high, he felt comfortable being himself, and that mattered to him as he prepares for his next step.In his message, Rortvedt spoke openly about what the support meant to him. “It was tough when I came in but I really appreciate the support. It’s been really cool to come in and try to do my job but feel support from the fans and be able to be myself.”His words showed a simple truth, being backed by fans helped him get through a challenging season.Now with Cincinnati, Rortvedt brings steady catching skills, a good understanding of working with young pitchers, and experience from playing in pressure-filled environments. The Reds have been building a young pitching group, and having a catcher who can guide different types of arms adds important depth as the team looks ahead to 2025.The Dodgers, meanwhile, stay active in making roster changes as they shape another postseason run. The team has always kept flexibility at the center of its plans, and Rortvedt’s move fits into that strategy. His farewell message reminded fans that, behind every transaction, there is a player who felt the crowd’s support and carried something positive from his time in Los Angeles.Also read: Shane Bieber’s wife Kara shares a sweet moment from her day that had fans melting across Instagram","Ben Rortvedt thanks fans for standing by him during a tough period in his career.

Blake Lizotte’s relentless play showcases why he’s becoming key piece for Pittsburgh



NHL Highlights | Penguins vs. Predators - November 16, 2025

More coverage on

NHL

:

Blake Lizotte delivered one of his most complete performances of the season as the Pittsburgh Penguins shut down the Nashville Predators in a commanding 4-0 victory. With the team searching for a spark after recent struggles, Lizotte stepped up in every zone, setting the tone with energy, discipline, and relentless pressure that Nashville simply couldn’t match.From the opening puck drop, Lizotte played with purpose. His speed disrupted breakouts, his tenacity on the forecheck created turnovers, and his defensive awareness helped neutralize Nashville’s limited scoring chances. Even before he sealed the game with an empty-net goal, his impact was clear that this was the kind of two-way effort that often goes unnoticed on the stat sheet but makes a massive difference in how a game unfolds.Lizotte was deployed on the fourth line once again, but his influence stretched far beyond typical fourth-line minutes. He dominated on the penalty kill, pressuring puck carriers, winning board battles, and refusing to give the Predators any clean looks. His commitment to the defensive side of the game played a major role in securing the shutout.The analytics matched what fans saw on the ice. Lizotte was on for 66.6% of the scoring chances and posted a strong 67.6% expected goals rate, elite numbers for any forward, especially one in a depth role.His work ethic helped stabilize the Penguins’ play and shift momentum at key moments.Injuries forced some lineup shuffling, including Connor Dewar moving up to skate alongside Sidney Crosby. Once healthy, Dewar is expected to return to the fourth line, where he and Lizotte form one of the most effective and irritating checking duos on the team. Their speed, pressure, and chemistry consistently wear down opponents and tilt the ice in Pittsburgh’s favor.Lizotte may have just three goals and four points through 19 games, but his value extends far beyond traditional scoring totals. His ability to drive possession, kill penalties, and outwork opponents makes him a crucial piece of the Penguins’ bottom six. Sunday’s win was a reminder that players like Lizotte often provide the spark needed to shift momentum, and he delivered exactly that in a much-needed victory.","Pittsburgh Penguins defeated Nashville Predators 4-0 on Sunday.

Connor Hellebuyck net worth in 2025: Updated wealth projections for the Jets star,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/connor-hellebuyck-net-worth-in-2025-updated-wealth-projections-for-the-jets-star/articleshow/125392393.cms,"Connor Hellebuyck (Image Source: Getty)

Detailed look at Connor Hellebuyck’s contract structure and income

Estimated net worth projection as of 2025

Connor Hellebuyck has established himself as one of the premier players in the NHL. As of 2025, his financial profile reflects the elite level at which he has performed for nearly a decade. He is known for his consistency, durability, and impact. He continues to shape both the team’s future and his own earning potential through long-term contracts. These are further enhanced by performance bonuses and career achievements that elevate his value.Connor was born in Commerce, Michigan. He was drafted 130th overall in the fifth round of the 2012 NHL Entry Draft. Hellebuyck’s journey began with modest expectations. After signing his entry-level contract in 2014, he worked his way through the AHL. This was followed by firming his presence in the NHL during the 2016–17 season. Since then, his trajectory has been marked by achievements. The 2020 Vezina Trophy, multiple franchise records, and a reputation as one of the most reliable goaltenders of his generation are among them.By 2025, Hellebuyck’s financial stability is largely catered to by the seven-year, $59.5 million contract.He signed with the Winnipeg Jets on October 9, 2023. The deal carries an average annual value (AAV) of $8.5 million. It includes a $5 million signing bonus paid in the 2024–25 season and guarantees the full contract value. This is a major factor in evaluating his projected net worth.For the 2025–26 campaign, Hellebuyck will earn a base salary of $10 million with a matching total cash payout of $10 million. His remaining cap was unchanged at $8.5 million. This made the Jets cost certain while ensuring the goaltender receives substantial compensation during the peak years of his career. Earlier deals like his six-year, $37 million contract signed in 2018 also contribute significantly to his accumulated earnings.Also Read: Connor Hellebuyck crowned NHL 26’s top goaltender as Winnipeg Jets dominate EA Sports rankings According to sources, Hellebuyck’s estimated career earnings are roughly $61.5 million by 2025, not including future guaranteed income. His annual salaries over time reflect his steady rise from an entry-level player earning under $1 million per season to one of the highest-paid goaltenders in the league.A realistic projection for Hellebuyck’s net worth in 2025 would fall between $35 million and $45 million. This range reflects his career earnings to date. This also includes the guaranteed money remaining on his contract, and financial considerations for professional athletes such as taxes, agent fees, living expenses, and personal investments.Some public estimates list his net worth as low as $5 million, but such figures do not align with confirmed contract data or the guaranteed structure of his long-term deals. Given the sizable income he has earned and continues to earn, higher projections are far more consistent with his financial reality.","Connor Hellebuyck was drafted 130th overall in the fifth round of the 2012 NHL Entry Draft.

New details on the Giants rookie (Image Via Getty)

Abdul Carter was benched for missing a team walk-through at the Giants facility



Abdul Carter, the New York Giants rookie edge rusher, did not play during the first defensive series of the 27–20 loss to the Green Bay Packers on Sunday at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. This was the first thing reporters noticed because the Giants started the game short on defense. Interim head coach Mike Kafka spoke after the game and said the decision was made by the coaching staff.But soon after the press conference, new information came out explaining why the rookie did not step on the field during that opening drive. The details came from people who were inside the Giants building before the game and saw what happened. The reason mattered even more because the Giants already had several injured players, including Kayvon Thibodeaux, who missed the game with a shoulder injury. That meant the team needed Abdul Carter on the field as soon as possible.According to Dan Duggan of The Athletic, Abdul Carter was benched because he missed the team walk-through on Saturday inside the Giants facility.Duggan reported that Abdul Carter was asleep at the facility when the walk-through took place and did not join the team on time.Duggan also wrote that Abdul Carter had been late to meetings before, and that this was a “trend” former head coach Brian Daboll allowed earlier in the season.When reporters asked Abdul Carter about the situation after the game on Sunday, he kept his answer short. He said, “I made a mistake, and there are consequences.” He did not give any more details about missing the walk-through or about the past late arrivals.Once the first defensive series ended, Abdul Carter played almost the whole game. He took every other defensive snap and finished with one tackle and one quarterback hit.Still, his rookie season has been slow compared to expectations. The Giants picked him No. 3 overall in the 2025 NFL Draft, hoping he would form a strong pass-rush trio with Brian Burns and Kayvon Thibodeaux.So far, Brian Burns has carried the group with 13 sacks this season. Abdul Carter has 0.5 sacks, and Kayvon Thibodeaux has 2.5 sacks. With Thibodeaux out because of his injury on Sunday, Abdul Carter’s workload grew right after the benching.These updates show why Abdul Carter sat out the first series and how the Giants handled the situation inside the locker room.More coverage on the NFL-","Abdul Carter, the New York Giants rookie edge rusher, did not play during the first defensive series of the 27–20 loss to the Green Bay Packers on Sunday.

It’s a one-man show right now so I’m very overwhelmed,” she admitted, offering viewers an honest look at the pressure and pride that come with running a business solo.The debut of Swete at a Vancouver Canucks home game marked a major milestone for her, and although she planned to film more backstage moments, the energy inside the arena took over. Katelyn says she wanted to soak in the reactions of fans trying Swete for the first time, something that made the launch even more meaningful.Alongside the business update, Katelyn added a heartfelt moment by sharing the birthday surprise she put together for Elias Pettersson. The clip offers a glimpse at their off-ice life, adding warmth and personality to the entrepreneurial story fans were already invested in.Swete will continue to be available at every Canucks home game, with an online release on the way.

Luke Littler dominates rival Luke Humphries to secure No. 1 Spot in PDC world rankings



Luke Littler created darts history once again as he became the youngest-ever world number one after a stunning run at the Grand Slam of Darts in Wolverhampton. The 18-year-old English sensation defeated the defending world number one, Luke Humphries, by 16-11 in the final to lift the title for the second straight year. His dominant 16-9 semi-final victory over Danny Noppert had already guaranteed his rise to the top of the PDC world rankings. With this win, Littler also remained unbeaten in the Grand Slam and proved why he is the new face of the sport.This achievement adds to Littler’s rapidly growing legacy. He first shocked the world with his record-breaking run to the 2024 World Championship final. A year later, he became the youngest world champion, and since then, he has become a global star. After his Grand Slam victory, the teenager proudly declared, “I am the best in the world, I can finally say it.” Littler’s rise has been so quick that he overtook Michael van Gerwen’s record, who was 24 when he first reached world No. 1.Luke Littler’s victory over Luke Humphries was a statement. The match swung back and forth early, with Littler leading 2-0 before Humphries won four straight legs. Humphries stayed in front until a brilliant 167 checkout helped Littler level at 8-8.The turning point came at 10-9 when Humphries, in control of the leg, went for a risky 170 finish. He missed, and his follow-up visit also fell apart. Littler seized the chance with a perfect 160 checkout. From there, he powered forward and never let the lead slip.After the win, Littler said, “Now I’m number one, I’m hungry to stay there. I want to be there for the next few years.” He knows the pressure will grow, adding, “There’s going to be a target on my back from Luke and all the other players.”Humphries, who hit 16 180s in his semi-final win over Gerwyn Price, admitted it was an emotional night. “This is the last day as number one. I’ve been so happy and proud of myself,” he said. He added that his focus was now on winning trophies again, “When it gets to the Worlds, I’ve got one opportunity to take it back from him. I’ll be fighting hard; it’s a war now.”Littler’s achievement is remarkable. His prize money now totals £1.85 million in under two years, proving his rapid rise is no accident.Also Read: What is China’s new “Ultra-Perspective” mode in live streaming and why is it the ultimate game-changer for live sports?",Luke Littler becomes youngest-ever world number one.

Matthew Schaefer turning heads in 2025 NHL season: Could he become the next Cale Makar?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/matthew-schaefer-turning-heads-in-2025-nhl-season-could-he-become-the-next-cale-makar/articleshow/125387361.cms,"Matthew Schaefer’s rookie season sparks Cale Makar comparisons (Image via: Getty Images)

Matthew Schaefer’s rookie metrics highlight Cale Makar-caliber potential



Matthew Schaefer's Unbelievable Story Of Adversity And Perseverance

More coverage on NHL:

At just 18, New York Islanders rookie Matthew Schaefer is establishing himself as one of the NHL’s most promising young defensemen. With a combination of speed, skill, and offensive instincts, Schaefer is making an immediate impact in his debut season. His early performance has prompted comparisons to Colorado Avalanche star Cale Makar , a generational defenseman known for offensive production and two-way play.Through the first 18 games of the 2025 season, Schaefer has recorded seven goals and 15 points, leading all rookies and ranking among the top NHL defensemen in scoring. He also leads his rookie class in power-play goals (4) and shots on goal (54). In comparison, Makar, through a similar span this season, has six goals, 24 points, and seven power-play points, highlighting Schaefer’s scoring efficiency relative to an established elite defenseman.Schaefer’s advanced stats further emphasize his impact. He leads NHL defensemen in 20-plus mph skating bursts with 65, compared to Makar’s 44, while both are tied for third among defensemen in 22-plus mph bursts. Schaefer also ranks in the 96th percentile for max skating speed (22.93 mph), close to Makar’s 23.86 mph. These metrics highlight not only his speed but also his ability to consistently join the rush and create offensive opportunities.In terms of offensive impact, Schaefer is generating significant scoring opportunities from prime areas on the ice. He is producing high-danger chances and contributing consistently on the power play, showing a similar ability to influence games as Makar. While Makar has more experience and overall points, Schaefer’s efficiency and scoring from key areas indicate that he can match elite defensemen in creating offensive pressure.Schaefer has also set NHL rookie records, becoming the youngest player to score a regular-season overtime goal and the youngest defenseman with a multi-goal game, achievements that reflect his poise and readiness at the professional level.While it is early in his career, Schaefer’s combination of skating, scoring, and advanced metrics indicates a high ceiling. If he maintains this trajectory, Matthew Schaefer could develop into a cornerstone defenseman for the Islanders and a generational talent comparable to Cale Makar.","New York Islanders rookie Matthew Schaefer is establishing himself as one of the NHL’s most promising young defensemen.

Season Performance and Expected Impact on Tonight’s Game

Game Outlook and What Fans Can Expect

Milwaukee Bucks fans have reason to be optimistic heading into tonight’s highly anticipated showdown against the Cleveland Cavaliers, as superstar forward. The matchup at Rocket Arena in Cleveland promises intensity, playoff-like energy, and major implications for early-season Eastern Conference standings. With both teams battling injuries, Giannis’s expected return becomes one of the game’s defining storylines.This contest also comes at a moment when the Milwaukee Bucks are searching for stability. After an inconsistent start to the season and an 8-6 record so far, Milwaukee needs its MVP centerpiece to regain momentum. Cleveland, meanwhile, continues to push forward despite its own injury setbacks, ensuring an intriguing clash between two teams hoping to climb the Eastern Conference ladder.According to the latest team updates, Giannis Antetokounmpo is listed as probable due to a right knee issue that previously sidelined him for two games earlier in the season. Historically, this status has almost always resulted in him taking the floor unless something changes during pregame warmups. The Milwaukee Bucks have leaned on him heavily, and his ability to play through minor discomfort has consistently kept Milwaukee competitive.In addition to Giannis’s probable return, Milwaukee continues to navigate other absences, with Taurean Prince and Kevin Porter Jr. still unavailable. Their continued recovery places even more responsibility on Giannis to carry the scoring and playmaking load. For Cleveland, injuries remain a significant factor as well - Darius Garland, Jaylon Tyson, and Max Strus are all out, thinning the Cavaliers’ rotation for the second straight week.Giannis Antetokounmpo has been in peak form this season, averaging 32.6 points, 11.3 rebounds, and 7.1 assists per game while shooting over 63% from the field and an impressive 50% from three-point range. His all-around dominance has kept the Milwaukee Bucks afloat despite fluctuating team performances. The matchup against Cleveland is another chance for him to shift momentum in Milwaukee’s favor after a series of mixed results.His recent history versus the Cavaliers adds even more intrigue - Giannis erupted for a 40-point performance earlier this season against this same squad. With the Cavaliers missing multiple defensive starters, another explosive outing from him could be on the horizon.With one of the NBA’s biggest stars likely taking the court, tonight’s contest promises high scoring, physicality, and fast-paced action. Analysts are already predicting a combined total exceeding 230 points, signaling the offensive firepower expected from both sides. Giannis Antetokounmpo’s versatility and playmaking will be crucial for Milwaukee as they attempt to exploit Cleveland’s injury-weakened depth.","Giannis Antetokounmpo is listed as probable for tonight’s game against the Cleveland Cavaliers.

Justin Tucker faces uncertain NFL return after serving suspension





More NFL coverage

Justin Tucker’s name is back in NFL conversations, but not because of a game-winning kick. The former Baltimore Ravens star has completed his 10-game suspension and is finally eligible to return. Now the league waits to see if any team is willing to sign him after months of headlines, allegations and intense scrutiny. His return window is open, yet his future remains uncertain as front offices weigh talent against controversy.Tucker, once viewed as one of the most reliable kickers in football, is now trying to rebuild his career at a time when several teams are desperate for stability. He has served his full punishment under the NFL’s personal conduct policy, and his reinstatement clears the path for a comeback. Whether that comeback actually happens will depend on who is willing to take the risk.Justin Tucker can return to the field if he signs with a team. His 10-game suspension for violating the NFL’s personal conduct policy is complete, and he is now free to join any roster. The Ravens released him in May after allegations of sexual misconduct surfaced. Sixteen Baltimore-area massage therapists accused him of inappropriate behavior between 2012 and 2016.As the claims spread, Tucker and his wife, Amanda, denied the accusations. He said, “It devastates me to know that anyone I have worked with would not have felt respected. To anyone who has felt otherwise, I am sorry.”The NFL launched its own investigation and suspended him in June. He served the suspension as a free agent, officially becoming eligible to return on Nov. 11. Despite the controversy, NFL Network reported earlier that he had interest from several teams.Tucker’s resume is still impressive. He is a seven-time Pro Bowler and five-time All-Pro with an 89.1 percent career accuracy rate, ranking him among the best kickers in league history. He also set the 66-yard field goal record in 2021 before it was topped this season. But his final year in Baltimore raised concerns. He hit just 73.3 percent of his attempts and went 6 of 11 from 50 yards or more.Teams like the Rams, Falcons and Packers have struggled with consistency this season, making Justin Tucker a possible option despite the backlash that may follow. As the playoff push intensifies, reliability becomes priceless. That might give Justin Tucker the opening he needs, even if the decision comes with consequences for whichever team signs him.",Justin Tucker can return to the field if he signs with a team.
