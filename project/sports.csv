“Aridhoaru Ariyaamai Kandatraal Kaamam





Seridhoarum Seyizhai Maattu.”

The more men learn, the more their ignorance they detect; so is passion—that discovers more of her undiscovered secrets at every union.

Book of Love

The genius of Thiruvalluvar lies not only in the wisdom of his words but in his craft. Nowhere is this more visible than in—the Book of Love. With just two principal characters—the man and his beloved—he scripts a complete play of 25 chapters and 250 couplets.Apart from the two, there are only faint shadows of other figures; the thozhi, friend of the lady, paangan, friend of the lad, and the foster mother of the lady. It remains a two-character play, where Valluvar carefully scripts the entire arc of a relationship; intimate yet vast, narrow in frame but infinite in resonance.The lover celebrates her beauty while she longs for eternal companionship. There are moments of bliss, episodes of quarrels, reconciliations, separations, and the yearning to be reunited. In every line, the elixir of love binds them together.And what is the play about? Nothing less than life itself. Love is the pinnacle of human happiness, a universal experience that transcends cultures and centuries. The drama of love has not changed — couples quarrel, break up, reconcile, and rush back into each other’s arms. Perhaps the Gods themselves must be weary of watching the same scenes replay endlessly. Yet when these emotions are woven with the grandeur of poetry, they appear fresh.What elevates this poetic drama is not just its theme but the devices Valluvar employs. He uses soliloquy, dramatic irony, metaphors, and similes to breathe life into his characters. The result is more than poetry—it is theatre, staged not in grand halls but in the hearts of those who read it.What makes Valluvar’s poetry radiant are also some unexpected allegories and parables that almost jolt you. Couplet 1110, is an example:At first glance, this seems misplaced. Such a thought could have belonged in the chapters on learning () or wisdom (). Indeed, it describes a universal truth: the more one discovers, the more one realises how little one knows. Newton’s confession: “I feel like a boy playing on the seashore, finding pebbles, while the great ocean of truth lies undiscovered before me” is a perfect echo of this.Galileo, on the night of January 7, 1610, peering at Jupiter through his telescope, must have felt this same shock—that the universe is infinitely larger than one can fathom. Ramanujan, writing his first theorem, must have sensed that numbers conceal an inexhaustible world. In knowledge, every discovery reveals the immensity of what remains.Why then does Valluvar speak of this in the? Because love too is an endless quest. The lover, like the seeker, realises that every new glimpse of his beloved opens yet another hidden dimension of her being. The journey of desire is also like an endless path where every door opened leads to another. Knowledge and love, science and passion—all the different quests merge in the recognition that the greatest truths are inexhaustible.Perhaps the only certainty is that Valluvar himself was in love. For only one who has truly loved could have dared to compare the boundless mysteries of the universe with the inexhaustible depth of a beloved.","The Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.

Ciara ensures Russell Wilson’s name is part of her son’s identity



Russell Wilson embraces his role as stepdad with grace



Ciara and Russell Wilson have once again captured public attention, not with a red carpet moment, but with a deeply personal family milestone. The singer legally added her husband’s last name, Wilson, to her eldest son Future Zahir’s legal name — a move that fans had speculated about for years. The update underscores the couple’s commitment to their blended family and Russell’s steady presence as a stepfather.The story first reignited when Russell Wilson posted a family photo from the U.S. Open, captioning it, “Mrs. @ciara Wilson Future Wilson & Sienna Wilson.” Fans quickly noticed that Ciara’s 11-year-old son, born to rapper Future, was listed with the Wilson surname, sparking questions about adoption.Sources confirmed that Ciara, who has full custody, had legally added “Wilson” to her son’s name years ago. His complete legal name still carries Wilburn, from his biological father, but the addition reflects a symbolic recognition of Russell’s role. The decision wasn’t overnight. Back in 2019, Ciara filed a petition to change her son’s name to Russell Wilson Jr., though it was reportedly denied. Despite the legal hurdles, Ciara never wavered in her intent to honor Russell Wilson’s influence as a father figure.For Russell Wilson, the name change simply puts on paper what he has lived daily since marrying Ciara nine years ago. Speaking on I AM ATHLETE in 2024, he explained his philosophy: “When you’re raising children … you’ve got to love every single child as if they’re yours. God gave me that opportunity to raise them and love them and care for them … And there's no difference [between Future and his siblings].”Those words resonate with the way Ciara and Wilson present their family—united, supportive, and joyful, as seen courtside at the U.S. Open. While Future has remained silent on the matter, the quiet evolution of his son’s identity tells its own story.Ultimately, the legal recognition of “Wilson” in Future Zahir’s name marks more than a paperwork update. It shows how Ciara and Russell Wilson continue to strengthen their family bond, with love, resilience, and stability in a way that feels both deeply personal and powerfully symbolic.Also read: Haley Cavinder matches twin Hanna in cheeky Cowboys ‘stars’ fit while cheering Jake Ferguson in season opener against Eagles","Ciara adds Russell Wilson’s last name, Wilson, to her eldest son Future Zahir's legal name.

Boxing earnings fuel Manny Pacquiao’s massive fortune

Endorsements amplify Manny Pacquiao’s global brand

Political career adds to Manny Pacquiao’s influence but not wealth

Manny Pacquiao, the Filipino boxing star, had built a vast fortune by 2025, inspiring millions around the world. His net worth is around $220 million, thanks to his incredible journey from a poor kid to a global hero. Known as “PacMan,” he made money through boxing, brand deals, and politics.Manny Pacquiao's boxing career is the biggest reason for his massive wealth, earning him millions over the years. As the only boxer to win world titles in eight weight classes, he made about $575 million from his fights. His 2015 fight against Floyd Mayweather alone brought in $130 million. His 25 pay-per-view fights earned $1.3 billion total, proving how popular he is worldwide.Even at the age of 46, Pacquiao keeps fighting, like his July 2025 draw against Mario Barrios, which earned him around $12.5 million. His exciting style and wins against stars like Miguel Cotto and Oscar De La Hoya made him a fan favorite. Pay-per-view shares also added to his fortune, making him one of the richest boxers ever. His hard work in the ring built a strong financial foundation for his life.Also Read: Manny Pacquiao dares to defy age with bold move to steal Mario Barrios' WBC title Manny Pacquiano became a target of major brands due to his fame, and his net worth was boosted by endorsements to the tune of millions.During his prime, companies such as Nike, Nestlé, and Hennessy paid him annually between 2 and 5 million dollars. In his fight with Mayweather, companies such as Paramount Pictures and Smart Communications also purchased advertising space on his shorts to the tune of $300,000 apiece. In 2016, Nike dumped him, and he joined the Chinese ANATA brand.Being a clean image and with a massive following, and more so in the Philippines, he was ideal for marketing. He, too, began Manny Pacquiao Promotions to help the young boxers, which is another source of revenue. Team Pacquiao Coffee and real estate are other business activities that contribute to his wealth. These transactions demonstrate how Pacquiao has built his brand of fame beyond the boxing ring. Together, these ventures highlight the boxing legend Pacquiao’s sharp business mindset and ability to turn fame into a mega fortune. His journey was tough, but it also proves that his legacy extends far beyond the boxing arena.Pacquiao earned some respect through his work in politics, but could not significantly contribute to his wealth as compared to boxing. He represented the Philippines in the Senate between 2016 and 2022 and made approximately $40,000 a year, a modest sum when compared to his fight purse. His 2022 presidential campaign and 2025 Senate bid were not successful, but kept him in the limelight. These positions made his image, but they were not mega-grossers.He pays it back through his Manny Pacquiao Foundation, where he finances homes and scholarships to the poor. He also has a Beverly Hills mansion worth $12.5 million and houses in the Philippines. Politics did not make him wealthy; however, it reinforced his reputation as a popular personality. The combination of charity, investments, and service to the people demonstrates that he left a non-monetary legacy.","Manny Pacquiao, the Filipino boxing star, had built a vast fortune by 2025.

Deion Sanders’ advice for Travis Hunter as a new dad



Travis Hunter embraces fatherhood and NFL dreams



Travis Hunter is stepping into fatherhood and the NFL at the same time, and one man who has been by his side throughout this journey is Deion Sanders. The Hall of Famer, who once recruited Hunter to Jackson State and later coached him at Colorado, recently shared heartfelt fatherly advice for the Jacksonville Jaguars rookie as he embraces life’s two biggest milestones — becoming a professional athlete and a dad.For Deion Sanders, Travis Hunter has always been more than a player. Their bond goes back to 2021 when Hunter, then the No. 1 recruit in the nation, shocked everyone by committing to Jackson State instead of a powerhouse like Florida State. He later followed Sanders to Colorado, where he won the 2024 Heisman Trophy as a two-way sensation. Through it all, Sanders played a fatherly role, especially during Hunter’s toughest moments.On the night Hunter lifted the Heisman, his biological father was absent due to legal troubles. Sanders stepped in, embracing the young star in what became one of the most emotional moments of Hunter’s career. Years later, when Sanders was quietly battling a bladder cancer scare and couldn’t attend Hunter’s wedding, the rookie showed up at his coach’s Texas ranch, standing by him as the two shared quiet moments fishing together.“Oh my god, I’m taking a deep breath because I love him to life — I love him like he’s my son,” Sanders said. “It’s funny when your son is now a father… it’s a beautiful thing.“The thing that I told him is let’s correct all the things that we think we didn’t receive as children and let’s do that in our fatherhood. No matter what happens, let’s make sure we are the best darn father that ever walked. That’s what I told him. I’m proud of him, I love him to life, and I miss him dearly.”It wasn’t coach-speak. It was a father figure speaking to someone he considers family. And Hunter will also be happy to get some off-field advice from Coach Prime.Travis Hunter, just 22, is now a husband and a father. He and his longtime girlfriend, Leanna Lenee, tied the knot earlier this year before welcoming their first child, a baby boy. In a heartfelt video titled “Dear Son…”, Hunter can be heard saying to his newborn, “Gotta be better than me.”The timing couldn’t be more symbolic. On September 7, Hunter will make his NFL debut when the Jaguars face the Carolina Panthers. It marks the start of two parallel journeys: one on the field as a top draft pick, and one at home as a father. With Sanders’ wisdom and his own determination, Hunter now carries two legacies — as a rising NFL star and as a dad committed to doing things right. Fans and critics will be watching Travis Hunter how he make his debut a dreamy one. he is ready to show what he is capable of and to prove that he is indeed a two-way player and rare.Also Read: Justin Jefferson injury update: Vikings may take cautious approach as hamstring issue raises long-term concerns","Jacksonville Jaguars rookie Travis Hunter will make his NFL debut on September 7.

A fresh start at UNC quickly turns contentious

Jordon Hudson makes her stance on the Patriots clear

Bill Belichick’s transition from the NFL to college football was never going to be quiet, but few expected it to spark this much controversy. Between a rocky start at North Carolina and a public feud with the Patriots, his girlfriend Jordon Hudson has stepped forward, fiercely defending his legacy.Bill Belichick’s move to the college game was supposed to offer a clean slate after his long run in New England. Instead, controversy has followed him to North Carolina. The former Patriots coach recently banned NFL scouts, including those from his old franchise, from attending Tar Heels practices. While the decision appears aimed at protecting his players, it has been interpreted by many as another chapter in his ongoing feud with the Patriots.The ban came at a difficult time for Belichick, whose Tar Heels were blown out 48-14 by TCU. Critics suggest he is clinging to control in an effort to reassert his authority, while supporters view the move as a classic Belichick strategy—tight-lipped, defiant, and protective of his team.Amid the scrutiny, Belichick’s girlfriend Jordon Hudson has become one of his loudest defenders. On X (formerly Twitter), she reposted several fans who claimed the Patriots have worked to downplay his 24-year dynasty.One repost took aim at NFL analyst Mike Florio’s coverage: “Damn Mike, I didn’t think it was that serious lol. They made a 10-part series to try to diminish him and he made a joke about them.”Her outspoken defense has fueled speculation that Hudson is more than just a bystander, with some suggesting she may be operating behind pro-Belichick accounts. Regardless, her posts have amplified the narrative that the Patriots are actively trying to diminish the coach who brought them six Super Bowl titles.Also Read: Ciara’s son with rapper Future now officially carries Russell Wilson’s last name after legal change Belichick’s college chapter was expected to quiet doubts about his coaching future.

Raiders sign Justin Shorter to fill Amari Cooper’s vacated WR spot



Justin Shorter’s return could shape Raiders’ WR depth and special teams role in 2025



The Las Vegas Raiders faced an unexpected shakeup on their wide receiver depth chart after veteran Amari Cooper announced his retirement on Thursday, just nine days after re-signing with the team. This sudden move left the Raiders with an open roster spot, which they promptly filled by signing a familiar face: Justin Shorter.Justin Shorter, originally a fifth-round pick by the Buffalo Bills in the 2023 NFL Draft, will now step into Cooper’s vacated role. Shorter’s rookie year with the Bills was derailed by injury, causing him to miss the entire 2023 season. Following a roster cut during last summer’s downsizing, the Raiders added Shorter to their practice squad, giving him a chance to prove his worth.Shorter appeared on the Raiders’ active roster for 10 games in 2024, primarily contributing on special teams. His offensive snaps were limited, though he did record three catches in the preseason this August. Despite limited playing time, the Raiders clearly see potential in Shorter to support the team in multiple ways.Heading into Week 1 against the New England Patriots, Shorter is not expected to see significant offensive action.The Raiders’ first-string wide receiver trio—Jakobi Meyers, Tre Tucker, and Dont’e Thornton—along with rookie Jack Bech, remain ahead of him on the depth chart. However, Shorter’s versatility on special teams could earn him valuable playing time, allowing him to make a case for a more consistent role on the active roster.For the Raiders, adding Shorter ensures they maintain depth at wide receiver after Cooper’s sudden departure. While he may not immediately impact the offense, his familiarity with the team and ability to contribute in multiple areas make him a practical addition. Coaches and fans alike will be watching to see if Shorter can carve out a niche and potentially grow into a more prominent role as the season progresses.Also Read: Will Isiah Pacheco play against the Los Angeles Chargers tonight?

Caitlin Clark rules herself out after long recovery attempt



Indiana Fever bracing for stretch run without Caitlin Clark



Indiana Fever guard Caitlin Clark confirmed Thursday night that she will not return to the court this year, ending her second WNBA season with just three games left on the schedule. The two-time All-Star and reigning Rookie of the Year had been sidelined since mid-July with a right groin injury and later suffered a bone bruise that slowed her recovery. Her announcement is a major blow to the Fever, who are still fighting for the league’s final playoff spot.Caitlin Clark shared the difficult news directly with fans on social media. “I had hoped to share a better update, but I will not be returning to play this season,” she wrote on X. “I spent hours in the gym every day with the singular goal of getting back out there, disappointed isn’t a big enough word to describe how I am feeling. I want to thank everyone who had my back through all the uncertainty.”The 23-year-old guard said the support from Fever fans kept her motivated despite setbacks. “This has been incredibly frustrating, but even in the bad, there is good. The way the fans continued to show up for me, and for the Fever, brought me so much joy and important perspective.I am so proud of how this team has only gotten stronger through adversity this year. Now it’s time to close out the season and claim our spot in the playoffs. ”Clark averaged 16.5 points, 8.8 assists, and 5 rebounds across 13 games before her season ended. She had looked close to returning earlier this week, taking part in light drills, but contact work never followed.Fever general manager Amber Cox acknowledged the timing made a comeback impossible. “Caitlin has worked so hard throughout this time, doing everything possible to recover and return to the court but, ultimately, time is not on our side,” Cox said in a statement.Cox continued, “while we will continue working with Caitlin and provide her with every resource we have available, there is not enough time left in our season for her to safely return, and her long-term health and well-being remains our top priority. We are looking forward to having her back at full strength to start the 2026 season.”Also Read: Anthony Edwards receives words of caution from Miami Heat legend Dwyane Wade ahead of 2025-26 NBA season Clark’s absence adds to a brutal injury list for Indiana, with multiple guards already out for the year.

Steve Ballmer denies salary cap circumvention allegations

Steve Ballmer denies report that Clippers circumvented NBA’s salary cap [FULL INTERVIEW]

Steve Ballmer is adamant about having done the ""right thing""

The world of NBA was quite stunned when investigative journalist Pablo Torre revealed a report on the Los Angeles Clippers, their owner Steve Ballmer, and their star forward, Kawhi Leonard. The salary cap circumvention controversy has caught the eye of everyone, and the NBA is also launching an investigation into the matter. The Clippers as well as Ballmer have denied any wrongdoing on their part, and are open to said investigation. And now Steve Ballmer has doubled down on his stance in the matter, denying any involvement on his part.Steve Ballmer recently sat down for an interview, where he vehemently denied the allegations against him as well as the Los Angeles Clippers, being involved in salary cap circumvention. He did not arrange any ""no-show"" endorsement deal between the fintech company, Aspiration and Clippers player Kawhi Leonard. Ballmer told ESPN SportsCenter:""We made an investment in the company. All fine. I had no control over this company. This is important under the salary cap rules. I owned less than three percent of the company. There were investors who put in a lot more money than I did. I had no board seat. I had no control. Heck, it was a fraudulent company. It's possible nobody had control.""He further added:""At that time, we hadn't introduced Kawhi to Aspiration. We were done with Kawhi. We were done with Aspiration. The deals were all locked and loaded.Then they did ask to be introduced to Kawhi. Under the rules, we can introduce our sponsors to our athletes. We just can't be involved. We made an introduction. ... Where could any of this circumvention have happened? It didn't. It couldn't have.""But given Ballmer invested $50 million into the company, all eyes are on him and the Clippers as the NBA begins their investigation on this matter.Throughout the interview, Steve Ballmer was adamant that he and the Clippers had always done what was right. He said that they are looking forward to the investigation, so that things can be clear for everyone and it can be proven that there was no wrongdoing on their part. His priority is the Clipper fans, and he wants to show them that ""We've really emphasized on doing things the right way,"" without taking any shortcuts.He wants his fans to know that they are an up-and-up organization, that does things the ""right way,"" and he hopes after the investigation is done, it can all be put to rest. He was very adamant about them following every rule in the NBA, and continuously kept denying any involvement with Kawhi Leonard's $28 million 4-year endorsement deal with the fintech company.He also added that he made introductions between Leonard and Aspiration, but had no involvement in the deal. In fact, he said he didn't even know there was a deal between the two parties.

Brett Favre’s Parkinson’s announcement stuns NFL world as Deanna Favre’s reaction reveals painful truth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/brett-favres-parkinsons-announcement-stuns-nfl-world-as-deanna-favres-reaction-reveals-painful-truth/articleshow/123706473.cms,"Images via Getty

Deanna Favre’s stunned response shows how quietly Parkinson’s disease strikes



Brett Favre’s NFL career puts spotlight on the hidden cost of toughness

Brett Favre and Deanna Favre face the future with strength and resilience

When Brett Favre stepped to testify in Washington, D.C., during the Mississippi welfare funds case in September 2024, the focus was expected to be legal questions. Instead, the Green Bay Packers icon revealed something far more personal: he had been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease earlier that year.The Hall of Fame quarterback, now 55, explained that doctors confirmed the condition in January 2024 after he had struggled with unusual stiffness in his right arm. Everyday tasks became difficult, even something as simple as turning a screwdriver. For someone once known for unmatched durability, it was a startling admission. “It’s been an ordeal,” Brett Favre said, adding that the diagnosis had reshaped how he thought about the years ahead.At home, the moment was no less heavy. When Brett Favre first told his wife, Deanna Favre, she was stunned. He recalled her asking what made him seek medical advice, since she hadn’t noticed alarming symptoms herself. Her reaction showed just how quietly Parkinson’s can creep in, often without visible signs until it is undeniable.The couple has faced battles before. Deanna Favre fought breast cancer in 2004 and went on to start the Deanna Favre Hope Foundation.But this time, the challenge was shared and it struck a chord with fans who saw not just a football legend but a husband and wife staring down another life-altering fight.Brett Favre has not hidden his belief about where the disease may have started. Over a 20-year NFL career, he absorbed thousands of hits. Known for his toughness, he started 297 straight regular-season games, or 321 including playoffs, for the Green Bay Packers, New York Jets, and Minnesota Vikings.That streak set him apart as one of football’s toughest competitors, but it also left scars. Favre has openly estimated that he may have sustained more than a thousand concussions. He has been outspoken about how the NFL once minimized head trauma, treating concussions as little more than “getting your bell rung.” His comments have reignited debate about whether enough was done to protect players during his era, raising questions that stretch well beyond one man’s story.By the middle of 2025, Brett Favre acknowledged that what weighed on him most was the unpredictability of Parkinson’s. He admitted that not knowing how fast the disease might advance left him uneasy, calling the uncertainty the toughest part of it all. For Deanna Favre, whose own strength was tested years earlier during her battle with breast cancer, standing with her husband now reflects a shared resilience that goes well beyond the football field. Together, the Favres are facing a challenge that no championship or record streak could prepare them for a reminder that behind the fame and the victories are very human struggles.Also read : Travis Kelce breaks his silence on retirement as Patrick Mahomes makes a subtle dig at his weight loss ahead of the Chiefs' match against the LA Chargers","Brett Favre revealed in 2024 that he had been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease.

Gisele Bündchen’s emotional reflection on leaving her family behind for modeling

Moving on from her marriage to Tom Brady , Gisele embraced a new chapter



Gisele Bündchen’s modeling career has spanned decades, but even after reaching supermodel status, her beginnings remain an emotional subject. Back in June 2023, during a business conference in São Paulo, Brazil, the star teared up while recalling what it meant to leave her family behind as a teenager chasing her dreams.While speaking on stage at the VTEX event in 2023, Gisele Bündchen became visibly emotional as she looked back at her early journey. A source close to the model shared with People, “Gisele teared up on stage when they were talking about her early career. She still gets emotional when she thinks about leaving her family and her sisters. She was only 14 years old and she went off to start a new life, a new career. She left everything she knew behind. ”That early sacrifice, the source explained, continues to shape her perspective even decades later. “It’s a long path to 40 when you leave at 14-15 years old. It’s just emotional reflecting on her younger self,” the insider added.At the time, Bündchen was also publicly stepping into a new era of independence following her split from NFL legend Tom Brady after 13 years of marriage. The couple shares two children, Benjamin and Vivian.According to insiders then, the model was “really happy just enjoying her new chapter,” rediscovering her career and personal passions after years devoted to family life.In addition to reflecting on her past, Bündchen shared her hopes for the future—emphasizing the importance of leaving behind a better world for her kids. “You can do anything if you believe in yourself and your dreams,” she told the audience in Portuguese, inspiring many with her resilience and optimism.Also Read: No ""real relationship"" left: Tom Brady’s comments about parenting deepen rift with Gisele Bündchen Though this moment happened two years ago, it remains a powerful reminder of the sacrifices Gisele Bündchen made early on and the way she continues to redefine herself well beyond the runway.","Gisele Bündchen teared up while recalling what it meant to leave her family behind as a teenager chasing her dreams.

South Africa achieved a historic victory at Lord's, defeating England by 5 runs in the second ODI to secure their first bilateral ODI series win on English soil in 27 years. Under Temba Bavuma 's leadership, the Proteas took an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series, with Matthew Breetzke 's outstanding 85 contributing to their total of 330.The last time South Africa won an ODI series in England was in 1998, when they defeated Adam Hollioake's team 2-1. They had since lost four ODI series to England in 2008, 2012, 2017, and 2022 before this current triumph.The series history between these teams in England shows varied results.

Since the 2023 ODI World Cup, England have struggled in bilateral ODI series, winning just one out of six while South Africa claimed five victories.That said, Bavuma's captaincy has garnered loads of plaudits of late, especially on the back of their title-winning campaign at the ICC World Test Championship.The recent head-to-head record shows England's declining performance.They lost by 229 runs in Mumbai 2023, suffered defeats with 125 and 175 balls to spare in Karachi and Leeds 2025 respectively, and now this 5-run loss at Lord's.The match at Lord's set a new ODI record with a combined total of 655 runs. Matthew Breetzke and Tristan Stubbs formed a crucial partnership, scoring 58 runs in 101 balls, helping South Africa reach 330 for 8 in their 50 overs.England faced a challenging target, needing to surpass India's record of 326-8 from 2002, which remains the highest successful chase at Lord's. Despite their efforts, they fell short against South Africa's bowling attack, led by Nandre Burger 's 3/63 and Keshav Maharaj 's 2/59.This victory margin of 5 runs marks South Africa's second closest win against England in ODIs, following their one-run victory in Cape Town in 2000. England's current ODI performance statistics show a win percentage of just 31.8, winning only 7 out of 22 matches, with only Bangladesh and Zimbabwe having lower success rates among full member teams.The final match of the series is scheduled for September 7, with South Africa looking to complete a clean sweep while England aims to salvage pride with a consolation win.",South Africa defeated England by 5 runs in the second ODI at Lord's.

India Asia Cup squad: Why Shreyas Iyer and Shubman Gill are biggest talking points

Poll Do you agree with Yuvraj Singh that playing golf can help cricketers improve their game? Yes, absolutely! No, not really.

Ahead of the 2025 Asia Cup, the former India all-rounder has requested Shubman Gill and Abhishek Sharma not to repeat the mistake he made during his playing years and to play golf, as it will help them score more runs.""I have told them to play golf and I encourage them to play. It's very hard to find time, but I think the IPL is a good time for them to actually find time and hit some balls,"" Yuvraj said at an event.""It's up to them. Now they are superstars of the game and they have to decide what's going to help them be better. If golf can be something, then they have to decide that. But I encourage all athletes to play golf. I think it's a great way to unwind and it's great for the mind.""When asked whether playing golf would help them, Yuvraj said: ""I feel that any sport that helps you relax is going to be less taxing on the body and more fruitful for the mind. If you see the culture of golf in Australia, South Africa, England—majority of the best cricketers have played golf from a very young age.""You see a lot of these guys actually play a lot of golf and do less cricket practice during tours. You can't change something in a game in three days.But how can you recover and be mentally fresh for a game? So I just feel it's not just cricket. For any sportsperson in the world, they should play golf because eventually it will bring out the best in them in their sport.""Shubman Gill and Abhishek Sharma are set to open for India in the upcoming Asia Cup, starting next week.Yuvraj said if he had played golf during his playing years, he would have scored 3,000 more international runs.""I would have scored 3,000 more runs,"" said Yuvraj.""I tell all the young cricketers to try and play golf, hit the ball, see how you feel. Because sometimes too much practice is also not good for you. Sometimes when you're not scoring runs, you want to practice more, and with golf as well, you want to hit more balls. But sometimes it's good to relax,"" he said.","Yuvraj Singh says he would have scored 3,000 more international runs if he had played golf during his playing years.

Former India pacer Sandeep Sharma has revealed a thoughtful gesture by Punjab Kings co-owner from the 2017 Indian Premier League (IPL) and revealed why that moment is still very close to his heart.In one of his final outings for the franchise that season, Sandeep produced a match-winning spell of 3 for 22, guiding his team to defend a modest 138 against Royal Challengers Bengaluru (then Royal Challengers Bangalore). His victims included three of RCB’s biggest names -- Chris Gayle Virat Kohli , and AB de Villiers ""We were playing a match in Bengaluru against RCB. And I had taken three wickets with the new ball.

Poll How do you feel about the Pandya brothers' support for their childhood coach? Inspiring Generous Unexpected Overrated

The Pandya brothers, Hardik and Krunal, are known to be fierce competitors on the field, unwilling to budge an inch. No equation seems out of reach, considering their warrior-like hunger and desire to dominate the opposition. However, there is a softer side to their personality off the field. Despite witnessing the heights of success, the Pandya brothers continue to value and support their childhood coach Jitendra Singh , just like a member of their immediate family, providing ""financial assistance of nearly Rs 70-80 lakhs"".""Hardik and Krunal ensured that my first sister's wedding took place smoothly in 2018, stepping up with monetary assistance. Not only this, they also transferred Rs 20 lakhs for purchasing a car, along with other gifts, during my second sister's marriage in February 2024. Hardik said, 'Your sister is my sister. Just let me know whenever the wedding gets fixed'. After being informed about the date, he simply responded, 'Don't worry. Just ensure that all things go well', taking care of all the requirements,"" said Jitendra in an exclusive interaction with TimesofIndia.com.Hardik began his IPL career with the Mumbai Indians (MI) in IPL 2015, which emerged as a major source of happiness for the Pandya family as well as their coach. However, Jitendra suffered an unexpected blow during Hardik's absence after his mother fell seriously unwell all of a sudden.""I didn't mention the issue to Hardik to avoid any distractions. However, he figured out that there was something amiss after returning to Baroda and questioned me. I eventually opened up. After hearing about my mother's ill health, Hardik simply said, 'Please take all my money and make sure she recovers'. This was the first instance of their generosity and showcases our relationship,"" said Jitendra.""Hardik further gifted me a car which cost Rs 5-6 lakhs after returning from India's 2015-16 tour of Australia, which marked his first appearance with the national team, despite not being financially strong. I was caught by surprise and wasn't agreeable initially. Even Krunal attempted to convince me. However, I eventually relented after Hardik said, 'We are giving you a car for your safety. You shouldn't suffer an accident while driving a bike'. That was his way of acknowledging a coach who'd always been there when needed,"" added Jitendra.The relationship shared by the Pandya brothers with their childhood coach is further evident from a message shared by Hardik on Facebook in 2017, on the occasion of Teacher's Day.""On this day, I would like to say thank you to many teachers in my life, but the one who deserves the most is this guy, Jitu Singh sir. The guy who stood there with me in all ups and downs and always made sure I kept going! Thank you coach, we love you. I got your back always,"" he said.While the phrase 'I got your back' is thrown around lightly nowadays, the Pandya brothers have ensured that they live up to the significance involved. ""Hardik and Krunal helped me financially after MI won the IPL in 2017 and 2019. Krunal also transferred Rs 18 lakhs to purchase a car after RCB won IPL 2025. The overall financial assistance received from the Pandya brothers has been nearly Rs 70-80 lakhs. Their gestures definitely mean a lot considering I hail from a lower middle-class familial background,"" said Jitendra.""The Pandya brothers bore every expense on my behalf when they got married, personally ensuring my utmost comfort in every aspect. They ensure I have access to the best resources without a single penny being spent from my pocket. Hardik gifted me Nike merchandise worth Rs 2 lakhs back in 2016. All my clothing has been gifted by Hardik and Krunal, which I wouldn't have been able to afford otherwise. It is certainly a blessing and a matter of great fortune for any coach to have students like them,"" he added.","The Pandya brothers, Hardik and Krunal, are known to be fierce competitors on the field, unwilling to budge an inch.

Team India head coach Gautam Gambhir showed off his humorous side while celebrating Teachers' Day on Friday. Posting on X, he once again remembered the enduring bond between him and his mentor, Sanjay Bhardwaj.“Now I know what you went through coaching me all those years! Happy #TeachersDay!” Gautam Gambhir wrote in his heartfelt post.Replying to which, former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan posted a laughing emoji under it.Gambhir joined Bhardwaj’s LB Shastri Cricket Club at age 10.“There is no need for him to change his behaviour towards me,” Gambhir says. “When I went to him, I was a nobody. Even if my stature has grown, guru toh guru hi rehta hai.” Bhardwaj told TOI in an interview back in 2019 , “Gautam is still the same 10-year-old for me. God and life have given him a lot, but with me, he is still the same kid who came to learn cricket.”The star pupil recalled the biggest lesson: honesty. “He taught me to be honest to myself. There is no bigger lesson, whether in cricket, work, or life. That honesty is something I will carry forever.”Bhardwaj added wryly, “I may have taught him to be too honest.He stayed very straightforward, always saying, ‘I want to bank only on my game.’ That honesty also hurt him at times.”In that same interview, Gambhir added, “When the coach works hard, the students are forced to work hard… When he travelled daily from Rohtak to Delhi by train to coach, I realised only hard work earns you a place with him. He taught me never to give up.”This Teacher’s Day, Gambhir’s tribute is more than a post, it is a celebration of a lifelong mentor whose guidance shaped Indian cricket",Gautam Gambhir remembered his mentor Sanjay Bhardwaj on Teachers' Day.

Nolan Smith penalized after physical stop on former teammate



NFL doubling down on taunting emphasis this season

The NFL’s crackdown on taunting wasted no time making headlines in Week 1. Philadelphia Eagles linebacker Nolan Smith became the first player flagged under the league’s stricter enforcement of the rule during Thursday night’s clash with the Dallas Cowboys.The incident unfolded when Smith wrapped up running back Miles Sanders on the edge, stopping him for no gain. After the play, Smith celebrated by flexing and taking a couple of steps toward Sanders, who wasn’t facing him at the time. Officials immediately threw a flag for taunting, marking the first such penalty of the young season.The call didn’t result in an ejection but set the tone for what the NFL has promised will be a zero-tolerance approach to taunting in 2025. League officials emphasized during the offseason that actions deemed as directed celebrations or gestures toward opponents would draw penalties.For Smith, the penalty adds an extra layer of intrigue given that Sanders is his former teammate in Philadelphia. While the flex may have seemed harmless to some fans, the NFL has made clear that even subtle actions aimed toward an opponent can warrant a flag.Also Read: Eagles’ Jalen Carter ejected just six seconds into opener for spitting on Dak Prescott The moment will serve as a reminder to players across the league that celebrations need to be more contained this season. With emotions running high in rivalry games like Eagles-Cowboys, Smith’s penalty may only be the first of many in 2025.","Philadelphia Eagles linebacker Nolan Smith became the first player flagged under the league's stricter enforcement of the rule.

Jalen Hurts is robotic and not out in public like Tom Brady was when he was playing



A fan said modern-day Tom Brady and Bill Belichick are Patrick Mahomes and Andy Reid

(Comments via X post on Dan Orlovsky)

Dan Orlovsky received sarcastic responses from fans

Also Read:

On September 4, Football Analyst Dan Orlovsky made a bold statement on ESPN’s morning show, “Get Up.” The former Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback called Philadelphia Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni, “Bill Belichick,” and quarterback Jalen Hurts, “Tom Brady. ” Orlovsky provided numerous reasons for his comparison, noting their shared hyper-focus and that Hurts’ private demeanor was like that of Brady when he played.However, the reactions Orlovsky got from the other hosts were noteworthy–Adam Schefter(let out a chuckle), Will Compton(silently smiled), Mike Greenberg(dropped the pen he was holding), and Taylor Lewan(clueless as to what to say that?) Those were the hosts, what about the fans? They went into a wild frenzy! From utter disbelief to total disagreement–from ‘How could Orlovsky’ to ‘We are genuinely concerned!’ Before we delve deeper, let’s hear the former Los Angeles Rams quarterback’s entire monologue.On ESPN’s Morning Show, “Get Up,” NFL football analyst Dan Orlovsky expressed, “Nick Sirianni and Jalen Hurts are the modern-day Bill Belichick and Tom Brady. Just total alignment. Like, you know, I remember Belichick and Brady constantly saying stuff and being like, there’s no way you actually think that or feel that way or you operate like that. And it feels the same way.Jalen’s just robotic and maniacal and very focused. Not out in public like Tom was when he was playing.And Sirianni, there’s no way that he doesn’t know, but he says, and you’re like, maybe he didn’t really know. Like, the same way that coach Belichick would say stuff when he’d be like, there’s no way that you think that way. It just feels like their alignment and the way that they’re so hyper-focused and blocking out the noise, it’s very Belichick-Brady-like. ”“That’s a wild claim”–wrote a fan upon hearing Dan Orlovsky call Jalen Hurts “Tom Brady” and Nick Sirianni “Bill Belichick.” The fan further stated, “Patrick Mahomes and Andy Reid literally exist!” Another commented, “I’m real confused as to how that wouldn’t be Andy Reid and Patrick Mahomes… the Eagles were phenomenal last year but the discourse is getting a bit ridiculous at this point.”A third fan called it a “horrible comparison,” and differentiated between them: “Belichick and Brady won Super Bowls because of supreme QB play and coaching. Nick Sirianni and Jalen Hurts won because they had the best talent (Hurts has never thrown more than 23 TD passes and rode Barkleys back last year).”A fourth fan sided with Orlovsky, writing, “For all of the slow people in the comments. He means the focus, ability to block out the noise, and grind under the radar. However, if you judge them at similar times in their respective careers, you'll find the comparison making plenty of sense.” A fifth fan simply wrote, “Nah. If any duo has earned that comparison wouldn’t it be Reid and Mahomes?” A fan clarified, “People will get upset about Reid not being included in this but they’re comparing coach + QB not coach + defense. ”A fan responded sarcastically, saying, “Yeah, and I’m the modern day Elvis. I mean what are we doing here?” Another fan wrote, “They just give anyone the mic nowadays 😂😂😂.” A third fan commented, “Talking just to talk.” A fourth fan suggested Orlovsky drew the comparison for attention, “Dan Orlovsky running out of bounds for some attention.” A fifth fan questioned, “Dan, what is going on with your takes lately? Genuinely concerned. ”A fan brutally expressed, “Time to yank Dan from TV. It’s been too much for too long now. Save the former pro seats for people that actually did something in the league. At least the McAfees and RGIIIs of the world have hardware.” Another called Orlovsky's opinion, “Worst take of all time.” A third fan pictured Orlovsky on the gridiron and wrote, “Dan Orlovsky just ran out of the end zone again.” A fourth fan said, “Are you even kidding me right now? Dan just keeps losing any credibility he has. ”","NFL analyst Dan Orlovsky made a bold statement on ESPN’s morning show, “Get Up.” The former Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback called Philadelphia Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni “Bill Belichick,” and quarterback Jalen Hurts, ‘Tom Brady.’ The reactions from the other hosts were noteworthy, but what about the fans?","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123702418,imgsize-94189,width-400,resizemode-4/nfl-jalen-sirianni.jpg"
Hardoi Instagram Missing Husband: 30-sec reel helps UP woman locate hubby who died 7 years back; living with second wife in Ludhiana,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/30-sec-reel-helps-woman-locate-hubby-who-died-7-years-back/articleshow/123663305.cms,"The seven-year vanishing act

The reel that became evidence





LUCKNOW: Forget CID, forget private detectives. In Hardoi, Uttar Pradesh, a wife solved a seven-year-old mystery with just a casual Instagram scroll.Back in April 2017, Sheelu of Murarnagar, Sandila, married Jitendra Kumar (32), better known in his village as Babloo. A few months later, the couple was expecting their first child. But instead of fatherhood, Babloo chose a disappearing act. In 2018, he suddenly vanished without a trace.His family, rather than helping Sheelu search, accused her of murdering him and hiding the body. A missing person’s report was lodged at Sandila police station, but the case soon went cold. For years, Sheelu carried the stigma of being suspected as a “husband killer,” while raising her son alone.Fast-forward to 2025. While scrolling Instagram reels, Sheelu spotted a man dancing happily in Ludhiana. The problem? It wasn’t just any man. It was Babloo — alive, grooving, and flaunting a new woman by his side, who police later confirmed was his second wife.“Sheelu waited seven years. Then one reel ended the suspense,” quipped a police officer involved in the investigation.Furious, Sheelu made the reel viral, then filed a formal complaint.Acting swiftly, Circle Officer Santosh Kumar Singh and his Sandila team — SI Ranjanikant Pandey, Head Constable Diwakar Mishra, and Constable Sunil Kumar — tracked Babloo down in Ludhiana, where he was working at a cloth factory and living a double life. He was arrested under Section 82(1) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (bigamy).Police said Sheelu and Babloo married in 2017, and their son was born in 2018. Just weeks after the child’s birth, Babloo went missing. His family claimed ignorance but secretly filed a complaint suggesting foul play by Sheelu.“Time passed, but he never returned,” Sheelu told reporters, recalling how she was left abandoned and stigmatised during pregnancy. She also alleged that before disappearing, Babloo became abusive, forcing her to return to her parents’ house in late 2017. She only learned he “vanished” when she was four months pregnant.For years, the case remained a mystery. Then came the Instagram reel.Sheelu described her shock when she spotted her missing husband online. Determined, she confronted her in-laws, who admitted the man looked like Babloo but offered no explanation. Meanwhile, residents began sharing the reel widely, and soon the entire district knew the man “long gone” was alive and well.The police investigation confirmed the reel’s authenticity and Babloo’s new life in Punjab. “During the inquiry, it was found that Jitendra married another woman in Ludhiana. He has been taken into custody,” said CO Santosh Singh.For Sheelu, the discovery was bittersweet. “I don’t know why he left me during my pregnancy, when I needed him the most,” she said, adding that her years of waiting ended not with closure, but with betrayal gone viral.","Sheelu married Jitendra Kumar (32), better known in his village as Babloo, in 2017.
