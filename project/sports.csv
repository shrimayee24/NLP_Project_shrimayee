NEW DELHI: Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) fast-bowler Yash Dayal took to social media to express his admiration and respect for Virat Kohli , the former Indian captain.Dayal's heartfelt message came in the wake of controversial statements made by former Indian leg-spinner Amit Mishra , who alleged that Kohli's aggressive nature has led to him having fewer friends and that it was Kohli who had instigated a rift with Afghanistan cricketer Naveen-ul-Haq during an IPL match between RCB and Lucknow Super Giants (LSG).In his Instagram post, Dayal shared a picture with Kohli, captioning it, ""It's an honour to stand beside you, bhaiya @virat.kohli.""Furthermore, Dayal shared the post on his Instagram story, using audio from Kohli's final game as RCB captain. In the background, Kohli can be heard saying, ""I have given my best. I don't know how the response has been, but I have given 120 percent to this franchise every time, which is something I will now do as a player.""In an appearance on YouTuber Shubhankar Mishra’s show ""Unplugged,"" Amit Mishra commented, “He (Kohli) started abusing our players (in the LSG vs RCB rematch in Lucknow). He didn’t have any grudges with Kyle Mayers, but he abused him as well. Naveen-ul-Haq was bowling, and he abused him too. A lot could have been avoided, but Kohli chose not to.""Mishra further added, “For social media, it all seemed to be over between them. But do you think Naveen will ever respect Kohli again? What about the youngsters who witnessed a big star abusing others?”Meanwhile, Kohli has been enjoying a well-deserved break after India's title-winning campaign in the 2024 T20 World Cup .

Virat Kohli has told BCCI he's ready to move on from past clashes with coach Gautam Gambhir: Reports,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/virat-kohli-has-told-bcci-hes-ready-to-move-on-from-past-clashes-with-coach-gautam-gambhir-reports/articleshow/111850000.cms,"One aspect from where Gautam Gambhir 's appointment as India's head coach always looked at was in terms of his strained relations with Virat Kohli; but according to a report in Cricbuzz, Kohli has communicated to the BCCI that he is ready to move on as it is in the best interest of the team and Indian cricket Kohli, who has been spending time with family since India's T20 World Cup win on June 29, was on Thursday named in India's ODI squad for the tour of Sri Lanka after earlier reports suggested he and skipper Rohit Sharma will skip the three-match series.But both will be part of the squad for the 50-over leg of the tour, in which Rohit will continue to lead the team. Suryakumar Yadav was named the T20 captain since Rohit has retired from T2OIs.Kohli and Gambhir have had on-field disagreements and even came eye to eye on multiple occasions in the Indian Premier League, but as stated in the Cricbuzz report, ""Kohli is believed to have stated that previous issues will not affect their professional relationship in the dressing room"" and that he has ""communicated this clearly to the relevant BCCI officials"".The report also states that discussions on the issue were possibly held after the T20 World Cup final.The Sri Lanka tour will be Gambhir's first assignment as India's head coach since he replaced Rahul Dravid in the role. Dravid's tenure ended after the T20 World Cup last month.The way Kohli and Gambhir, whose last appointment as Kolkata Knight Riders' mentor helped the franchise win IPL 2024, approach their cricket, both are cut from the same cloth. They like to wear heart on sleeve while representing the county and don't shy away from letting their joy or displeasure be known, even in the public eye.No coach or player likes to lose, but with Gambhir, that narrative goes a little further with the added, intense patriotic fervour he brings to the dressing room. On that note, again, Gambhir is not different to Kohli, or vice versa, and maybe a step ahead.When those things combine for the common cause, which is winning matches and trophies for India, it can make the team invincible in all formats, with Kohli part of Tests and ODIs only going ahead, having quit the T20Is.","Virat Kohli and Gautam Gambhir have had on-field disagreements.

NEW DELHI: The Indian opening batters Shafali Verma and Smriti Mandhana exhibited an impressive display of aggressive batting from the outset in the pursuit of a modest target of 109 runs in their Women's Asia Cup 2024 opener at Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium in Dambulla, Sri Lanka.Verma, known for her explosive batting style, contributed a crucial 40 runs to the innings, while her opening partner, Mandhana, complemented her efforts with a well-crafted 45 runs.The duo's partnership laid a solid foundation for India's chase, as they consistently found the boundary with an array of powerful strokes.The sixth over of the innings, bowled by Tuba Hassan, exemplified the aggressive mindset of the Indian openers. Mandhana and Shafali unleashed a barrage of boundaries, including two fours and a towering six, amassing 15 runs from the over. This onslaught not only dented the confidence of the Pakistani bowlers but also demonstrated the duo's ability to seize control of the game.Throughout their partnership, Mandhana and Shafali displayed a remarkable understanding of each other's strengths, rotating the strike effectively and capitalizing on scoring opportunities. Their ability to find gaps in the field and clear the boundary with ease kept the Pakistani fielders on their toes, adding to the pressure on the bowling unit.The aggressive approach adopted by the Indian openers was a calculated risk, but one that paid dividends as it allowed them to maintain a healthy run rate and keep the required run rate within manageable limits. Their ability to score freely also provided the subsequent batters with the luxury of playing their natural game without undue pressure.While the Pakistani bowlers tried various strategies to stem the flow of runs, the Indian openers remained undeterred, showcasing their skill, temperament, and determination to succeed. Their partnership not only set the tone for India's successful chase but also highlighted the depth and quality of the Indian batting lineup, leading the team to a convincing victory over their arch-rivals.",Shafali Verma and Smriti Mandhana lead India to convincing victory over Pakistan.

West Indies century-maker Kavem Hodge glad to survive 'brutal' Mark Wood battle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/west-indies-century-maker-kavem-hodge-glad-to-survive-brutal-mark-wood-battle/articleshow/111874892.cms,"NEW DELHI: Kavem Hodge expressed satisfaction in achieving his first Test century during a challenging encounter with Mark Wood at Trent Bridge on Friday. During the intense battle, Hodge playfully reminded the England fast bowler that he had ""a wife and kids at home"".Hodge's impressive 120 formed the backbone of West Indies' 351-5 at the close of play on day two, reducing the deficit to just 65 runs in response to England's first innings total of 416.This performance marked a significant improvement from their disappointing batting display in the innings and 114-run defeat at Lord's, which had left the West Indies trailing 1-0 in the three-match series.The Lord's Test was notable for being James Anderson 's farewell to international cricket, as the England legend retired with an impressive 704 Test wickets, a record for a fast bowler.In Nottingham, Wood stepped in to fill Anderson's shoes, consistently delivering express pace throughout the day, with his fastest delivery clocking in at 97.1 mph (156.2 kmh) and maintaining an average speed of around 93 mph.Wood also struck Alick Athanaze on the helmet when the left-hander was on 48, but Athanaze recovered to score 82 in a crucial fourth-wicket partnership of 175 with Hodge.""There was one point I was joking with him (Wood), I said 'hey, I have a wife and kids at home!',"" said Hodge after stumps.""He started to laugh and I think it made the century much more satisfying.""Test cricket is brutal, it is challenging, it is mentally draining. To experience that, facing guys like Mark Wood, it was tough but it was satisfying.""The 31-year-old added: ""Some guys got hit but it's part of Test cricket. Kudos to Alick. He bounced back and was able to stand his ground and push on even further. I flinched, I thought I was going to get hit before that.""But the sheer grind of bowling so quickly on a good batting pitch eventually took its toll on Wood, whose career has been blighted by injuries.He left the field before Friday's close with suspected cramp following a wicketless return of 0-51 in 14.1 overs that was no reward for a determined and skilful display.""Surprisingly, he said he's never had cramp before. I'm hoping it's just a bit of fatigue,"" said Paul Collingwood , the England assistant coach.""He certainly was stretching his hamstring so I presume it's in there somewhere. It's been a hot day, he's put all his effort into every ball. But he had a smile on his face at the end.""The former England all-rounder added: ""Everyone watching Woody throw himself 100 percent at every single spell was exceptional and getting up to speeds of 97 mph is everything you want to see in Test cricket.""",Kavem Hodge scores 120 in West Indies' 351-5 at close of play on day two of second Test.

His serve and forehand were hampered. Nagal hadn’t planned to take a break then. Unfortunately the body doesn’t send out preinjury notifications.Nagal took five weeks off, after which he planned a loaded schedule with just one goal in mind — Paris 2024 .Like an amorous lover on the loose, he chased a distant shot at a place in the singles draw. After three successive first-round losses on his return in May, two of those coming against top 20 opponents — Sebastian Baez and Karen Khachanov — the Heilbronn Challenger was the 26-year-old’s last chance to present a best-possible profile for a spot in the Olympic field.He would climb to a career-best No. 71 in the rankings even if he won the Challenger, but he would still be out of the direct entry cut. Nagal was determined.“My goal was to make the Olympics . Heilbronn was my last chance,” he said.First up for Nagal in Heilbronn, a city in southwest Germany nearly 500 kms from his base in Peine — where he trains at the Nensel Academy — was Nikoli Basilashvili, who was ranked outside the 500 mark at the time but was in the top-20 at No.16 five years ago.Nagal took the first set but hit rock bottom in the second.“I wasn’t playing good tennis . I was playing horrendous, I was complaining, not really competing,” said Nagal, sitting in one of the small interview rooms at the All-England Club. “I was a break down in the third set when I told myself, man, don’t forget you have to make the Olympics. It is a promise to yourself.”Nagal, hands crossed over his chest, shook his head.“To be able to control myself and complete that match was fabulous,” Nagal said. “I was able change my mentality, turn it around when playing with all that pressure.”Nagal, who lives in Germany while most of his family and friends are back home in India, is a bit of a lone ranger.“When I’m stressed, I’m a little moody, I can get aggressive on the court, not with the tennis, but verbally,” Nagal said, when asked to describe pressure. “For me, pressure can make my body heavy. When your body is tight, you are burning way more than you usually do and that can pull you down in a match.”Nagal, ranked No. 68 in the world, will now play his second successive Olympics starting July 27. He knows what to expect.“The funny part of the Olympics is that you never know what you can do, it is not the same as playing a Grand Slam,” he said. “You can come out for the first match and can completely freeze, the pressure you have is very different. It takes some getting used to.”There’s a new-found equilibrium to Nagal, a considered pause, that ability to question oneself.“My mind and body are in the same place,” he said, his shoulders lifting in a gentle motion. “When there’s a maturity about you, you are seeing things better, feeling your body better, you are in a different mood. You feel your aura. Some 10 months ago, I was ranked 150, now I’m top 70, maybe 70 places is not big, but the difference is huge.”Nagal can see the difference as much as he can feel it. On his racquet strings. In his stride.","Sumit Nagal will play his second successive Olympics starting July 27.

If your bowlers do swing & reverse swing then it is skill, if we do then, we are tampering with ball & chip on the ball,"" Shami said on Shubhankar Mishra's YouTube channel.In response to Inzamam's allegations, Shami expressed his disapproval and urged them to refrain from deceiving the public with such outlandish claims.""Jo unke against perform karegi team wo wahan par target hoti hain. Manlo maine device se ball daal diya aur button ulta dab gaya. Maine inswing daal but outswing ho gayi toh chauka ho jayega. Ye cartoon giri kahin aur chal sakti hai, yeh public ko bewakoof banane wali baate hain,"" Shami said. (The team that performs against them gets targeted there. Suppose I bowled with the device and pressed the button incorrectly. I intended to bowl an inswinger but it turned into an outswinger, resulting in a boundary. This kind of cartoonish behavior can happen elsewhere; these are just ways to fool the public)."" Arshdeep Singh , when he was bowling the 15th over, the ball was reversing. Is it too early (for reverse swing) with the new ball? This means the ball was ready for reverse swing by the 12th or the 13th over. Umpires should keep their eyes open (to spot) these things...If it was Pakistani bowlers (reverse swinging the ball) this would have been a big issue. We know reverse swing very well and if Arshdeep can come in the 15th over and start reversing the ball, it means some serious work had been done before,"" Inzamam had said on Pakistani news channel.Shami, who has returned to bowling in the nets after being out of action since the ODI World Cup due to ankle injury, also revealed his best friends within the Indian cricket team during the conversation.""Virat Kohli and Ishant Sharma are my Best friends.

Players trust Suryakumar Yadav more than Hardik Pandya: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-sri-lanka/players-trust-suryakumar-yadav-more-than-hardik-pandya-report/articleshow/111856876.cms,"The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has appointed Suryakumar Yadav as India's T20I captain, succeeding Rohit Sharma, based on reports that the players trust him more than allrounder Hardik Pandya , who led the team in T20Is before getting injured last year.The decision was announced late on Thursday when the selectors revealed the squads for India's upcoming white-ball tour of Sri Lanka, which commences on July 27.Suryakumar, aged 33, will lead a squad of 15 players announced for the three T20I matches to be held in Pallekele. However, he has not been selected for the subsequent series of three ODIs.Rohit, along with Virat Kohli and Ravindra Jadeja, retired from T20 internationals following India's World Cup victory last month. He will continue to captain the ODI team, which is set to face Sri Lanka on August 2, 4, and 7 at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo.Despite being Rohit's deputy during the T20 World Cup, the 30-year-old Hardik Pandya was overlooked for the captaincy role in favour of Suryakumar, who made his international debut five years after the talented all-rounder. Hardik was also not considered for T20I vice-captaincy, which was given to opener Shubman Gill who led a young squad on the tour of Zimbabwe.A report in the Indian Express newspaper said, ""feedback received by the board was that players trusted Surya more than Pandya and were more comfortable working under him"".Pandya's recurrent fitness issues, such as the ankle problem he suffered during the previous year's ODI World Cup held in India, worked against his favour.As per sources, the newly appointed coach, Gautam Gambhir, preferred a skipper without injury worries and was impressed by Suryakumar's understanding of the game.Suryakumar, a consistent performer in T20 cricket, has revolutionized batting in the format. Despite making his India debut at the age of 30, he quickly became the team's reliable middle-order batter in the shortest format.His fearless strokeplay, including his famous lap shot behind the stumps, makes him a nightmare for bowlers, earning him the reputation of a ""360 degree"" player for his ability to hit all around the ground.In the T20 World Cup final against South Africa in Barbados last month, Suryakumar took a stunning catch at the boundary in a tense last over bowled by Pandya, helping India secure a thrilling victory.Having previously captained Mumbai in domestic cricket, Suryakumar led India to a 4-1 T20I series win over Australia last year and followed it up with a 1-1 result in South Africa.Pandya had a successful World Cup campaign with both bat and ball, but his journey has been challenging, especially after replacing Rohit as the captain of Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League.He faced criticism from Rohit's fans, who booed him across various venues, and Mumbai finished at the bottom of the 10-team table in IPL 2024.On Thursday, Pandya announced his separation from his wife and Serbian model Natasa Stankovic, adding to his personal struggles. The couple, who were married for four years, will co-parent their son.",Suryakumar Yadav named India's new T20I captain. Reports suggest players trust him more than allrounder Hardik Pandya. Pandya was Rohit Sharma's deputy during the T20 World Cup.

He proved to be a valuable asset to the team with his bowling prowess, both in the Powerplay and death overs.Not only did Axar excel with the ball, but he also made significant contributions with the bat.Axar played a vital knock of 47 in the final against South Africa. However, his bowling performance was subpar, as Heinrich Klaasen took advantage of his deliveries, resulting in Axar conceding 49 runs in his allocated 4 overs.In an exclusive interview with Cricbuzz, Axar shared his experiences from the match where Klaasen launched a brutal assault on him. The left-arm spinner revealed how captain Rohit Sharma played a crucial role in keeping his spirits high, even as Klaasen took him to task.""In the final, when Heinrich Klaasen was aggressive against me, Rohit approached me and reassured me, saying, 'It's alright. You bowled your best. If he hits a good shot, there's not much you can do. Just focus on the next ball.' His support and encouragement boosted my confidence. After I completed the over, he tapped my shoulder and said, 'Well done. Don't worry.' Such conversations from your captain lift you and keep you motivated on the field. Rohit excels in providing that kind of support,"" he told Cricbuzz.Axar commended Rohit for his shrewd leadership during the T20 World Cup, noting how he effectively managed the team and extracted the best performances from each individual player.""Rohit Sharma is a brilliant captain. If you observed his captaincy during the World Cup, you wouldn't find a set formula. In some games, I bowled two overs in the PowerPlay, while in others, Jasprit Bumrah bowled early. There wasn't a specific pattern. Similarly, in batting, I didn't always move up the order. In the final, Shivam Dube batted ahead of Hardik Pandya . It was all very tactical, showcasing his ability to think strategically in different situations, determining which player would perform best.""""I believe Rohit had done his homework. Throughout the World Cup, he brought out the best in each player. For instance, in the England game, he sent Ravindra Jadeja ahead of me and Dube, displaying an incredible presence of mind. Even in the final, Bumrah completed his overs by the 18th over (normally he bowls the 19th over). There were numerous such instances where his skill in rotating bowlers effectively contributed to the result. It's something that comes with experience I guess. He understands each player's strengths and utilizes them according to the game's demands.

"After India captaincy snub, can Hardik Pandya retain MI's top post next season?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-sri-lanka/after-india-captaincy-snub-can-hardik-pandya-retain-mis-top-post-next-season/articleshow/111865183.cms,"NEW DELHI: Hardik Pandya departed from the Caribbean, reveling in the triumph of leading India to their first ICC tournament victory in over a decade. Yet, within a span of just three weeks, his world has been turned on its head.The unforgiving nature of elite sport has become apparent to Pandya, as he faced a surprising decision regarding the captaincy of the Indian T20 team for the forthcoming Sri Lanka tour, all while grappling with personal challenges.The decision to overlook Pandya in favor of Suryakumar Yadav for the leadership role was a resounding and direct vote of 'no confidence' in his captaincy skills.According to PTI, this unexpected turn of events, one of the most striking twists in Indian cricket history, has left the dynamic all-rounder confronting yet another significant question about his future in the team.The Mumbai Indians , the most influential and affluent franchise in the IPL, face a crucial decision regarding the leadership of their team. The question remains whether they will continue to back their current captain, Pandya, who took over fromRohit Sharma , their most beloved skipper, under contentious circumstances in the previous season.Rohit's remarkable achievement of guiding the Indian team to victory in the T20 World Cup has propelled him to a stature second only to Mahendra Singh Dhoni in Indian cricket. This triumph comes just months after his unceremonious dismissal by his IPL franchise.As the mega auction approaches next year, the Mumbai Indians must carefully consider their approach towards Rohit and the potential consequences if the Indian captain chooses not to be retained by the franchise.MI find themselves in an intriguing situation with Suryakumar, the newly appointed Indian T20 captain, on their roster. As the mega auction approaches next year, MI will undoubtedly prioritize retaining Surya, considering his pivotal role in the team and his newfound leadership responsibilities.However, securing Surya's retention might require MI to present an irresistible offer. Being the captain of the Indian team, Surya may now aspire to lead the most popular franchise in the IPL as well. This potential desire could complicate negotiations and force MI to go the extra mile to ensure Surya remains with the team.Jasprit Bumrah's affinity for leadership roles in Indian cricket is well-known, but his invaluable skills as a pace spearhead make it impractical to consistently assign him captaincy duties. However, he would likely embrace being the premier player retained by his team.Given this context, Pandya's position remains uncertain. After a highly successful tenure with Gujarat Titans, he transitioned to Mumbai Indians through a widely publicized all-cash deal. Despite this move, Pandya faced widespread booing from fans across the nation during the previous IPL season.The IPL Governing Council is yet to reveal the number of retentions permitted for each franchise in the upcoming mega auction. If the limit remains at four, with one overseas player allowed, the teams will have to make tough decisions regarding their three Indian selections.Building a competitive squad for the next five years will be the primary focus of the mega auction. Franchises will need to make difficult choices to ensure they have a well-balanced team for the future.Mumbai Indians' management, if they are honest with themselves, will admit that the decision to appoint Pandya as the captain did not create a positive atmosphere within the team. The team's last-place finish in this season only reinforced the doubts surrounding this decision.Pandya's chances of leading the Indian team took a hit with Gautam Gambhir's appointment as the head coach. The selection committee, headed by Ajit Agarkar, also had reservations about Pandya's tactical acumen, which is crucial for an international captain.Pandya requires some guidance, which he received from Ashish Nehra at Gujarat Titans. However, Mark Boucher, his coach at MI, was not the right person to provide that support. According to general feedback, the younger players in the Indian team are more likely to respond better to Suryakumar's leadership than to Pandya's.Pandya's immediate future involves proving his worth in the upcoming T20I series against Sri Lanka. A stellar showing in these matches would solidify his position in the team. However, relying solely on international appearances is not an option for Pandya.To enhance his international appearance percentage, which currently stands at a subpar 50 percent across the two white-ball formats over the last 19 months (46 out of 79 T20Is and 23 out of 59 ODIs since January 2022), Pandya must actively participate in domestic cricket.Pandya's journey in Indian cricket has encountered a significant setback, but the door hasn't completely closed on his aspirations. To keep his hopes of participating in the Champions Trophy next year alive, Pandya will need to showcase his skills in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, representing Baroda in December.Pandya's leadership ambitions have faced a massive roadblock but in cricket, it ain't over till the last ball is bowled.",Hardik Pandya faced a surprising decision regarding the captaincy of the Indian T20 team for the forthcoming Sri Lanka tour.

Dortmund eye fresh start under new Turkish coach,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/dortmund-eye-fresh-start-under-new-turkish-coach/articleshow/111843336.cms,"New manager, new ambition

Rebuilding for the future

It's been a case of so close yet so far for Borussia Dortmund in the last couple of seasons. While 2022-23 saw them finishing second to Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga on the last day of the season, the last season culminated in a Champions League final heartbreak with Real Madrid beating them 2-0 in the final. What made it more difficult for the Dortmund fans was the fact that the German giants, who were playing the Champions League final after 10 years, were the better team for long parts of the final.Now, as Borussia Dortmund embark on a new season, a few things have changed.Talisman Marco Reus has left the club after 12 years, stalwart defender Mats Hummels has also moved on. Influential striker Niklas Fullkrug, too, is also likely to join AC Milan while, most significantly, manager Edin Terzic has left his post.Considered the best bet to lead the club to the summit, Terzic left many shocked when he departed after two-and-a-half seasons. But the appointment of Nuri Sahin came as a pleasant surprise. As a former academy and first-team player, Sahin is well-known amongst the ‘black-and-yellow' faithful. In his first speech as manager, Sahin made it clear that his primary objective is to bring the German giants back to where they belong. Dortmund last won the Bundesliga title in 2011-12 and have suffered multiple heartbreaks in the league and European cup competitions – their last silverware came in 2021 when they won the DFB-Pokal.""From day one, we will work with great passion and energy to make the club as successful as possible."" The Turkish manager has his hands full as he will be looking to rebuild the team as it prepares for Bundesliga and Champions League.If we were to reflect on the past, Dortmund hardly made statement signings. ‘Die Schwarzgelben' have always been a club built around developing players. Dortmund have also been smart off the field and have relied on talented young players in the transfer market, traditionally selling them to the powerhouses for a significant sum of money.However, the club does not have the Haalands, Bellinghams or Pulisics it once did. Jamie Bynoe-Gittens has shown promise and could have the X-factor that Dortmund may require, but a relatively poor finish to the season leaves a lot to be desired in the new term.Since senior figures like Hummels and Reus have departed, Dortmund are without leaders in the dressing room. The club has signed Serhou Guirassy following his impressive 28-goal campaign with VFB Stuttgart. The club will hope that he brings his end product and build-up play, areas which Dortmund lacked last season. Nico Schlotterbeck and Julian Ryerson will be retained in the back line, but with Ian Maatsen's loan ending, Dortmund's defence looks fragile.With Maatsen and Hummels no longer in the setup, Dortmund will turn to the recent signing of Waldemar Anton to deliver consistent performances. They do have Niklas Sule and Ramy Bensebaini, who weren't a part of the first-choice defensive line last campaign, but it will be interesting to see if they become starters next season.",Borussia Dortmund finished second in the Bundesliga last season. The German giants lost to Real Madrid in the Champions League final. Manager Edin Terzic left the club after two-and-a-half seasons. Nuri Sahin has been appointed as the new manager.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111843341,imgsize-28516,width-400,resizemode-4/111843341.jpg"

His significant drop in the rankings can be attributed to his prolonged absence from the tour, during which he underwent surgeries on his hip and wrist.","Chris Eubanks beat Aleksandar Vukic 6-2, 4-6, 7-6 (7/3) in the ATP Hall of Fame Open quarter-finals on Friday.
