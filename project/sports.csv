Observations from Emmanuel Acho



“I am not surprised that Caleb Williams is struggling,”

“I am surprised that Caleb Williams is struggling this much. So yes, rookies should be rookies, but if you were better than all them, then I need you to be better than all them. So, Caleb, if you was better than all of the dudes then, why'd he caught you?

Bears Struggle Early in Season



Future Prospects: Under the Spotlight to Continue



Alina Thyregod's unwavering support for Caleb Williams underscores the importance of personal relationships in the high-pressure environment of professional sports. Her encouragement and understanding reflect a strong bond, offering Williams the emotional backing necessary to navigate both the triumphs and tribulations of his rookie season in the NFL.

Caleb Williams , the Chicago Bears’ highly anticipated rookie quarterback, is navigating the ups and downs of his debut NFL season with a mixture of pressure, performance critique, and unwavering support from his girlfriend, Alina Thyregod .

Her posts have drawn attention for their blend of fashion and fandom, highlighting the unique role she plays as a supportive partner in the high-stakes world of professional football.Whereas the online presence of Thyregod has given the limelight to the positive side of the whole relationship course, Williams has had it rather rockier on the field. He has had a greater amount of scrutiny as he enters his rookie season as a quarterback and has faced several hiccups along the way.The well-played game Williams had against the Indianapolis Colts led him to his first two NFL touchdowns, an exciting achievement for any rookie. His success came along with two costly interceptions and being sacked four times, showing the grim curve he is likely to grapple on such a significant transition from high school to professional football.Not everyone is willing to chalk up Williams’ struggles to the usual rookie growing pains. Former NFL linebacker and sports analyst Emmanuel Acho weighed in on Williams' performance, delivering a pointed critique of the young quarterback. Acho expressed disappointment in how Williams has performed so far, suggesting that his reputation coming into the league was not matching up with his early showings.Acho said.” said Acho. For Williams, whose awkward mistakes with interceptions and sacks nobody saw coming considering all the hype that surrounded this young quarterback coming into the draft, added weight to the pressure mounting on him as every inch of his movements on and off the field is put into scrutiny.The overall performance of the Bears from Chicago has been discouraging this season as they have only managed to win one of the initially scheduled games. It is yet another irony that the team managed to win that singular game in the home match Thyregod witnessed - one of the magnificent moments of fan support amidst a rubbish season otherwise.The Bears' struggles mirror the growing pains that are not only for Williams but also the team as a whole, as they adapt to the expectations mounted on them in the early goings of this NFL season. As for Williams, the media has left him headachy, with all analysts, fans, and other stakeholders weighing every performance he makes.While Caleb Williams puts in work to get into a rhythm in the NFL, he does this under the scrutiny of football insiders and with Alina Thyregod's watchful eye from behind the lens. Sure, detractors abound at a sport this trendy, but Williams always has such a stalwart ally in Thyregod, his biggest fan-in-life as much as in social media.The coming weeks are surely going to be very crucial for Williams as he will be walking all over to silence the critics and clinch success in his rookie season. It may be on the grass or even on the webpage, but such a journey is one filled with challenges yet full of hope toward future triumphs.Also read - Taylor Swift, Olivia Culpo & NFL Wives Rally Behind Fashion Maven Kristin Juszczyk","Caleb Williams, the Chicago Bears’ rookie quarterback, is navigating the ups and downs of his debut NFL season with a mixture of pressure, performance critique, and unwavering support from his girlfriend.

Families of martyrs invited

KANPUR: The Green Park Stadium , one of India's earliest Test centres, may struggle to find another international fixture in the foreseeable future, TOI has learnt. As it stands, the Indian cricket board ( BCCI ) is unsure of the hosting capabilities of the venue.According to sources, the board has been made aware of the reluctance of senior India players to play at the venue.With the Ekana Stadium in Lucknow having state-of-the art facilities and a new international stadium expected to come up in Varanasi next year, it will be tough for Green Park to get another international match to host.""There were concerns raised by Indian team management about the venue. They prefer to play in Lucknow, which has better facilities. This Test match was awarded to Uttar Pradesh Cricket Association ( UPCA ) as per rotation and since Green Park has been declared a Test centre by BCCI, the association decided to host the match in Kanpur,"" a BCCI source said.The stadium wears an old-world look. For this Test between India and Bangladesh, civic authorities have deemed one of the stands unsafe to seat its full capacity. There are structural problems with one of the floodlight towers. Hygiene and maintenance of the blocks are questionable.""The stadium in Varanasi should be ready well before the T20 World Cup in India in 2026. This stadium needs an overhaul and better management. The BCCI can't really say when the next international match will be played here,"" source said.Meanwhile, the UPCA authorities are trying their best to bring in as many people as possible for the Test. In a one-of-kind initiative, the UPCA has decided to invite families of martyred soldiers to the match and plant a sapling in honour of each martyred soldier.""We have asked the authorities to give us a list of martyred soldiers around Kanpur and we have extended our invitation to their families. Planting a sapling in their name is a part of our go-green initiative.

Embroiled in political turmoil back home, Bangladesh stalwart says he is done with T20Is; Champions Trophy to be last ODI appearance

KANPUR: It's not easy to be Shakib Al Hasan at the moment. He has endured a love-hate relationship with Bangladesh cricket fans for over 15 years. Now, at the age of 37, he faces murder charges and multiple corruption suits following the political protests and turmoil back home.Shakib was a member of parliament of the Awami League-led government, which fell after the protests on Aug 5.Since then, Shakib has faced complications in entering his own country.On Thursday, Bangladesh's greatest cricketing icon decided to announce his retirement from T20Is and said that he will play one last Test match against South Africa in his home town Mirpur next month if conditions allow his entry and the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) can guarantee his family's safety.If not, the Kanpur Test against India could be the last time we see Shakib in Test whites. This will be followed by giving up ODIs after the ICC Champions Trophy in February 2025.With a resigned smile, Shakib sat through a press conference and explained, ""I had discussions with the BCB. The first Test against South Africa in Mirpur will be my last Test if they can assure safety for me and my family and that I can leave Bangladesh as well. The T20 World Cup was my last in T20Is. The Champions Trophy will be my last ODI assignment. I have nine possible ODIs left to play.""All this is a rather sad way to end an illustrious career. Shakib has not been home since the T20 World Cup. He doesn't know when and how he can return. ""It's my desire to play my last Test in Bangladesh. If it doesn't happen, then this Kanpur Test will be my last. Being a Bangladesh citizen, going back to Bangladesh is not a problem. Leaving Bangladesh could be a problem. I would like to continue playing in other leagues across the globe,"" he said.Interestingly, South Africa's tour of Bangladesh has still not obtained security clearances. According to the Bangladeshi media, BCB president Faruque Ahmed has said the board is incapable of doing anything regarding Shakib's safety concerns when and if he arrives in the country. ""Actually, I am not a member of any (law enforcement) agency. So, this is not in my hand,"" Faruque was quoted as saying following a board directors' meeting at the BCB headquarters in Mirpur.""I believe there is nothing better than him being able to play his final Test at home. But his safety issues are not in our hands as these need to come from the highest authorities. The board does not have the authority to ensure security clearance to any individual,"" Faruque clarified.A cricketer with chest-thumping confidence who is always in combat mode with the local media, Shakib was rather mellow during Thursday's press conference.""Regarding T20s, I had discussions with BCB that the T20 World Cup was my last.

Second Test against Bangladesh begins today with the next rung of leaders vying for vacant vice-captain's slot

KANPUR: On Thursday afternoon, Shubman Gill walked up to Rishabh Pant and requested him to throw some balls as he wanted to practice drives off the front foot. Pant, with pads still on after a lengthy batting stint in the nets, obliged.During the 10-minute drill, they seemed to be discussing batting technique and animatedly exchange ideas.It's apparent that these boys from Gabba's historic heist are now two very important men in the Indian setup. They are not just about having fun in the field. They took a hard look at the two Green Park surfaces being prepared for the second Test, which starts on Friday.They also had an intense chat with captain Rohit Sharma Amid all this, Yashasvi Jaiswal was seen walking up to Pant. The pair exchanged a fist bump before they broke away. It needs to be noted that the selectors have not named a designated vice-captain for this series. Jasprit Bumrah was given the role in the last home series against England. KL Rahul was stripped of the role due to poor form midway through the Border-Gavaskar Trophy at home in February 2023.In essence, this home Test season, with three Tests against New Zealand to follow after this match, is an audition to formalize India's emerging leadership group.""You've got a lot of captains, ideal captains in this team,"" India's assistant coach Abhishek Nayar said on Thursday. He then went on to offer a peek into the team management's outlook.""When you talk about Shubman, Rishabh, hopefully Yashasvi going forward, these are players who've led their franchises in the IPL . So, I wouldn't look at them as youngsters anymore. Their development as international cricketers has been really impressive.""I believe they have the leadership qualities that are required.

NEW DELHI: In eight editions of the Women's T20 World Cup since its inception, India reached the semifinal four times and the final in 2020 but have never landed their hands on the silverware. Australia, not for the first time, were their nemesis in 2020 final.Skipper Harmanpreet Kaur is determined to change the script this time when the tournament gets under way in the UAE next week, describing her team as the ""best ever at the World Cup"".She is bent on getting across the line.Kaur had a strong supporter in former Australia skipper Lisa Sthalekar , who believes India could go the distance, but she qualified that assertion with a big 'if'. ""They are like the men's side. If they have a great tournament, then anything is possible. So, India's chances are very high,"" said Sthalekar at an interaction with a select group of journalists at ABC – International Development's commentary and mojo programme at the Australian High Commission here.Sthalekar said India would breeze through to the semifinal ""if not the final"" but that it would be anybody's game at the business end.""India has the power, depth and decent goals. It's probably that 4-5-6-7 positions in the batting line-up where the discussions are. Can they score at a good rate? Then we have someone like Jemimah Rodrigues . She fired in the West Indies during the CPL. I saw the article Harmanpreet Kaur wrote for the ICC saying they have had enough of being in the semis, so let's bring home the trophy. There is every possibility that they would, but they will be relying on their openers to get off to a good start, and then for the all-rounders to come in. Players like Pooja Vastrakar, if she can stay fit and in rhythm, she will be quite a handful.""But Sthalekar, now a seasoned commentator, put her money on her country, the reigning champions, saying, ""They are going for a four in four.""Sthalekar attributed the aura of invincibility around the Australian side to the ""system"", pointing out that the country was an early mover in the women's game. ""Australia invested a lot of money before women's cricket got trendy. That has allowed them to put structures in place which meant players were getting exposed to elite training facilities, conditions, teammates, and being challenged. And I think because Australia has predominantly won, there is a mentality within the side that they can win from any situation.""On other potential title contenders, Sthalekar said, ""England have been strong. You get a sense that they are building up nicely and they are taking the challenge on. South Africa were the finalists in 2023, and they seem to have a similar squad, so they could push hard. Also, never discount the West Indies.""Leading perspective to the landmark move of equal prize money, the Indian-born Aussie said, ""It's really good. But what I'm more pleased about than just the winner getting the same money as their male counterparts is how much money teams get for just participating in the World Cup. This ensures it's not just strong nations getting stronger and wealthier. There is an effort to grow the global game. Scotland coming in for the first time will probably earn more money than their national contract. The headline is equal prize money and that is primarily the intention but when you look a little deeper, they would like to have a bigger impact on the game.""","Former Australia skipper Lisa Sthalekar believes India could go the distance at the Women's T20 World Cup.

He emphasized that the team already has numerous individuals who possess leadership qualities and have previously held captaincy roles at the highest level of the sport.""I think we need to understand that we have got a lot of IPL captains in this team.

I am not sure about the bounce yet,"" Nayar said.""With the conditions and the forecast, it is going to be interesting, when we turn up in the morning, how the conditions are. A lot will depend on that because as you know in Test wicket, conditions can be a huge factor in how the pitch plays.""It is too early for us to judge and decide or have any sort of thought process on the pitch or the conditions.

NEW DELHI: Former India wicketkeeper-batter Parthiv Patel feels there is ""no harm"" in trying Yash Dayal in place of either Jasprit Bumrah or Mohammed Siraj for the second Test against Bangladesh in Kanpur, beginning on Friday.Before the beginning of the Test series against Bangladesh in Chennai, skipper Rohit Sharma asserted that the workload management of their pacers will be monitored throughout their jam-packed Test schedule, which will last till January next year.India stamped their authority in the opening Test by sealing a 280-run victory. In the pre-match press conference on Thursday, assistant coach Abhishek Nayar didn't dwell on the details of the playing XI.Parthiv feels that Dayal, who has ""tremendous potential,"" can come in place of either Siraj or Bumrah, presenting a chance for everyone to see a left-arm pacer in action for India.""This will be a great chance to see a left-armer. It has been a while since India had a left-arm seamer, so I feel if he gets the chance, it will be good. We will know. Yash Dayal has tremendous potential. So I don't think there is harm in trying,"" Parthiv Patel, who is an expert on JioCinema & Sports18 told ANI.Another aspect that will be keenly looked at will be the middle-order setup of the Rohit-led side. Sarfaraz Ahmed and Dhruv Jurel are knocking on the door after impressing during India's 4-1 series triumph over England earlier this year.With the return of Rishabh Pant and KL Rahul in the Test setup, Parthiv finds it hard to see the duo feature in the playing XI and could have to wait for their opportunities.""I don't think Sarfaraz and Dhruv will make a comeback to the side. Rishabh has just made a comeback. Both of them are very very talented players and very much ready for Test cricket. But they will have to wait for their chances,"" Parthiv added.Jurel earned his maiden Test cap for India against England in the 3rd Test in Rajkot. In his debut Test, the young wicketkeeper batter played a promising 46-run knock.In the fourth Test, he played a match-saving knock of 90 (149) in the first inning, which propelled India's score to 307.Sarfaraz acted as the backbone of the Indian middle order. He garnered 200 in three matches at an average of 50.00.Jurel and Dayal have been drafted in the Rest of India's squad for the upcoming Irani Cup. On the other hand, Sarfaraz has been selected in Mumbai's squad.

Angelo Mathews (78) and Kamindu Mendis (51) will resume for the hosts on the second day after both hitting half-centuries.For Kamindu it was a world record eighth consecutive fifty since the 25-year-old's debut against Australia at the same venue two years ago.Mathews reached his own milestone by becoming only the sixth cricketer to make 2,000 Test runs at a single venue -- a select group that includes the likes of Joe Root and Graham Gooch -- on the notoriously bowler-friendly Galle pitch.Chandimal made his ton with a single off Kiwi spinner Mitchell Santner in a knock that capitalised on loose deliveries.He powered forwards after the end of his 122-run stand with Dimuth Karunaratne , who was run out on 46 and walked back to the pavilion fuming after a miscommunication between the pair.New Zealand missed two opportunities to break the partnership earlier and failed to halt Sri Lanka's momentum through the day. Daryl Mitchell , fielding at slip, dropped two catches including a change to get Chandimal out on five in the fourth over.Wicketkeeper Tom Blundell missed a stumping opportunity off Karunaratne.Sri Lanka won the opening match of the two-Test series by 63 runs.

"'When you play against a team like India, pitches don't matter much': Shakib Al Hasan",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/bangladesh-in-india/when-you-play-against-a-team-like-india-pitches-dont-matter-much-shakib-al-hasan/articleshow/113701936.cms,"Shakib Al Hasan (PTI Photo)

KANPUR: Star Bangladesh all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan on Thursday admitted that travelling to India is the toughest Test assignment and pitches don't make much difference due to the sheer quality of the hosts. Bangladesh are still searching for their first Test win against India since 2000, when they first clashed in Dhaka.The two teams have played 14 times against each other with India winning 12 contests while the remaining two ended in draws.""If you look at other countries, every now and then they will lose one or two games. But in India, you hardly see them losing in Test matches. So yes, I would say you are right,"" Shakib told reporters when asked if a tour to India was indeed the toughest assignment.""We won against them in the ODI series in Bangladesh, we were very close to win a game against them in a Test match in Bangladesh. In Test cricket , we haven't got the success that we are looking for. Tomorrow we will have another opportunity.""I thought in patches we played really well in Chennai. But having said that, finishing the match in three-and-a-half days wasn't ideal for us. We felt like we were a better team than that. So, we need to show that in tomorrow's match,"" he added.Bangladesh did extremely well to win the Test series 2-0 in Pakistan before coming to India, and Shakib drew a comparison between the two teams.""Pakistan is a relatively new team. In experience, I would say, if you look at the matches they played and if you look at our team and the matches we have played, we have got more experience than them. And in Test cricket I think that is a massive factor.""If I talk about India, they are the number one team in the World Championship at this moment. They are probably unbeatable at home. I saw a stat somewhere where for some 4000 days they have been unbeaten in India. So, that shows how good they are in India.""They have been doing well outside India as well. Any country that came to India finding it difficult, we are no different there. But having said that, we have to play really well against them to be able to show the fight that we feel like we can put on,"" he noted.Asked if a spin-friendly pitch in Kanpur would help their cause, Shakib was clear that tracks are not a big factor when it comes to competing against quality teams.""When you play against a team like India, Australia, England, pitches don't matter much because they will obviously have their weapon with which they can attack us.""They will have quality spinners, they will have quality fast bowlers, they will have quality batsmen. So, I don't think pitch will have any effect. It's just we have to perform better than what we have done in Chennai.""Shakib exhorted the young Bangladeshi batters to score big for the team to be competitive.""If I talk about batting only, I think there has been an improvement. If you see from the first innings to the second innings. First innings we bowled out for about 150.""In the second innings, we scored about 250. If we can score 350, somewhere there, I think that will be a huge improvement. And 350 to 400 on first innings will give us a lot of confidence and the dressing room will feel a lot more comfortable,"" he said.",Bangladesh are still searching for their first Test win against India since 2000.

NEW DELHI: In the world of football , where strategy often reigns supreme, one manager took a unique approach that would leave fans scratching their heads and players in stitches.Neil Warnock , famed for his no-nonsense attitude in English football, revealed that he sometimes relied on his wife Sharon’s dreams to make crucial decisions about his starting XI.The anecdote that came to light in 2022 was first revealed by former Sheffield United striker Paul Ifill, who recounted his experience of being dropped for the Sheffield derby due to one of these whimsical hunches.Ahead of a highly anticipated Sheffield derby against rivals Sheffield Wednesday, Ifill, who played under Warnock from 2005 to 2007, was unexpectedly dropped from the lineup.The reason?A vivid dream experienced by Sharon Warnock , Neil's wife, the night before the match. According to Ifill, “Been telling people about his wife’s dreams for years! He once dropped me because of her dream, and she replaced me with Alan Quinn, who scored the only goal! Madness.”But this wasn’t just a one-off occurrence. Darren Ambrose , another player under Warnock’s stewardship, recalled an equally bizarre episode during his time atCrystal Palace .With the team gearing up for an FA Cup tie against Wolves in 2010, Warnock announced that Sharon had dreamed a right-back would score the winning goal.Laughably, he decided to play Danny Butterfield , then a second-choice right-back, as a striker. The result? A perfect hat-trick from Butterfield, leading to a triumphant 3-1 victory.These whimsical tales portray Warnock's old-school charm and how his unorthodox methods garnered respect among players.As Ambrose humorously noted, it led to players regularly asking, ""Gaffa, has Sharon had a dream last night? Am I in the team?"" It’s a reminder that sometimes, the most memorable stories in football come not just from tactics but from the delightful unpredictability of life—and the dreams that guide it.",Neil Warnock revealed that he sometimes relied on his wife Sharon's dreams to make crucial decisions about his starting XI.

CHENNAI: Chennaiyin FC could not have asked for a better start to the Indian Super League (ISL) season as they defeated the Sergio Lobera-managed Odisha FC at their 'fortress'. Brimming with confidence after a commendable show in the opener, CFC will be keen to keep the momentum going in the first home match against Mohammedan SC here on Thursday.The ISL debutants are expected to give Chennaiyin a run for their money at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium , having shown promise in the first two games.The Kolkata side put up spirited performances but fell victim to stoppage-time goals against NorthEast United FC (lost 0-1) and FC Goa (drew 1-1).CFC head coach Owen Coyle acknowledged the quality Mohammedan possess. “They have already shown with their performances what kind of a team they are. They were unfortunate to lose the first game against NorthEast, while a draw would have been fair. The other day, Manolo Marquez said that Mohammedan were better than his side FC Goa. I expect a good fight,” Coyle said.While Mohammedan could be dangerous opponents, CFC will be on a high as they bounced back strongly after conceding an early goal against Odisha. With potent players up front, Coyle went full throttle, a move that helped Chennaiyin seal the deal. However, Coyle is wary of a potential weakness in defence and highlighted that it needs betterment. ""The penalty that we conceded early (to Odisha) was due to lack of focus and concentration and that happens in football. It (defence) is not an area of concern, while it is an area where we are working on and are looking to get better moving forward,"" Coyle added.For Mohammedan to taste their maiden victory, Andrey Chernyshov's black-and-white brigade will bank on forward Carlos Franca to come good. Franca was a constant threat against Goa in their previous encounter. He drew a penalty for his side which helped Mohammedan score their first goal in the ISL.

BEIJING: World number one Jannik Sinner fought back to launch the defence of his China Open title with a 4-6, 6-3, 6-1 win over 28th-ranked Chilean Nicolas Jarry on Thursday.The US Open champion next faces veteran three-time Grand Slam winner Stan Wawrinka, who is a wildcard entry in Beijing, or Russia's Roman Safiullin.The 23-year-old Sinner arrived in the Chinese capital fresh from winning in New York for his second major title, having triumphed at the Australian Open at the start of the year.With victory also at the Cincinnati Masters before the US Open, Sinner faced Jarry in red-hot form and on an 11-match winning streak.Sinner made that 12, but not before suffering a scare.""In the first set I was struggling to return his serve and he broke me,"" Sinner said.""I just tried to stay there mentally. The first round at any tournament is never easy and playing against him is very tough.""But I am happy about the performance and how I ended the match.""The two went toe-to-toe in the first set but it was the Chilean who got in front when he broke for a 4-3 lead when the world number one fired long.The 28-year-old Jarry consolidated without losing a point in the eighth game and, after double-faulting on his first set point, sealed the set with his fifth ace of the match.Going behind seemed to sting a re-energised Sinner into action.The top seed raced to a 3-0 lead in the second set, eventually wrapping the set up after briefly threatening to blow his advantage.Sinner tamed Jarry's big serve to start the deciding set and grab an early break, winning the game with a terrific crosscourt backhand.Sinner broke again for 4-1 and was well on the way to an ultimately comfortable win.His main rivals in the Chinese capital will be four-time major champion Carlos Alcaraz and the Russian duo of Daniil Medvedev and Andrey Rublev , the third and fourth seeds. Novak Djokovic is not in Beijing, where a WTA 1000 event is also taking place at the same time.","World number one Jannik Sinner beats Nicolas Jarry in straight sets.

For Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan , the ATP Tour doubles title in Hangzhou marks a sort of Jeev 2.0 — not only has his game has matured and become more solid since he won his maiden title at his home town of Chennai, but he is also able to understand better the significance of triumph and what it means to his career going forward.The 35-year-old left-hander claimed the ATP 250 Series event in Hangzhou, China, in the company of his friend and fellow Tamil Nadu player Vijay Sundar Prashanth , beating Constantin Frantzen and Hendrik Jebens of Germany 4-6, 7-6 (5), 10-7 in the hard-court final on Sunday.Jeevan’s first title had come in 2017 at the Chennai Open in the company of veteran Davis Cupper and Australian Open Grand Slam champion Rohan Bopanna.“I think (I am) a little bit more experienced. I remember the first title was a little sooner than I thought,” Jeevan, who has climbed 27 spots on the ATP ladder to be ranked 86 in doubles, told The Times of India.“After switching to doubles, Rohan and I had won Chennai in 2017 and I didn't really know where that title was going to take me, you know.“I was just kind of excited to be playing Grand Slams , because that title happened to push me into the top 100. And ironically, this title has also pushed me into the top 100.“But I would say, (in) 2017 I was kind of naive without any real path to move forward after achieving a 250 title. But now, I'm feeling much calmer after winning a title of this stage, because I have a set partner and I have schedule which works in our favour.“And I'm healthy, I'm able to see that there is definitely going to be an exciting path to be playing with the same partner and consistently at a higher level.”It has been an eventful year for him so far, and Jeevan, wiser with experience, feels things are falling in place for him.“This year has not been very easy, there have been a lot of ups and downs. But very happy to be playing with Vijay, who's one of my closest friends, not just on tour, but in life,” he said.“We've been patient as a team. We've been learning how to get to our best ability together.“As the as far as the emotions are concerned, I think in goal setting, it was very clear for me that this was going to be the year for me to build something, because I'm always looking at long term with my partners.“I have only played with a handful of people my whole career. So with Vijay, we are just building something to give ourselves an opportunity to be, you know, a set team in the Grand Slams next year.”A long-term partnership has become a rare phenomenon in modern doubles and Jeevan looks at it practically.“A lot of teams are looking to build partnerships together. You can see (that) even with the Double Dream of India. So many teams are sticking together, and we're just trying to figure out what best combinations are going to get us all into the Grand Slams,” he said.“Today was a good day for Vijay and me, but the season has been good for Balaji and even Yuki has been doing very well.“The ideal goal for this program is to see all the players sitting at the Slam, taking a group picture.”","Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan wins ATP Tour doubles title in Hangzhou.

CHENNAI: At an age when many players think of retiring from professional tennis, Vijay Sundar Prashanth has secured his biggest title at the ATP level. The 37-year-old Vijay Sundar and Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan , both from Tamil Nadu , won their maiden ATP Tour crown as a pair by overcoming Germany's Constantin Frantzen and Hendrik Jebens 4-6, 7-6(5), 10-7 in the Hangzhou Open summit clash on Tuesday.""I cannot explain in words how I am feeling. We did not expect to win the tournament as we headed into it after taking breaks. Jeevan got married a few days ago and I took a week's rest. We believed in ourselves and that showed on the court,"" Vijay Sundar told TOI from Hangzhou.After dropping the first set, the Indian duo rallied to win the encounter in super tiebreak. En route the title, the Indian duo registered two upset victories; defeating second seeds Lloyd Glasspool and Julian Cash in the quarterfinals and the third-seeded pairing of Robert Galloway and Ariel Behar in the last-four stage. The title victory in Hangzhou will take Jeevan into the top-90 in the world rankings, while Vijay Sundar will move closer to the top-100 mark.Vijay Sundar, who tasted success in the ATP Challenger-level events last year with Anirudh Chandrasekar, joined hands with the experienced Jeevan in May.""We (Jeevan and I) have known each other for the last 25 years and grew up playing the sport together. When we did not have our respective partners earlier this year, we spoke to each other and then had a mutual agreement to join forces,"" Vijay Sundar added.The pair did not enjoy much success at the start and at one point they lost five first-round matches on the trot on the Challenger circuit . Still, they kept believing in themselves and their work behind the scenes has done the trick.""When we joined hands, we knew that this was going to be a long partnership. Although we lost a few close matches early, it did not bother us much as we knew that wins were not far away. We did not put pressure on us and waited for the right moment.""The next goal for the Indian pair will be to carry forward the momentum and book a place at the Australian Open next year. Vijay made his Grand Slam debut in Australia earlier this year by partnering Anirudh, while Jeevan could not make it to any of the majors this year. ""We will relax till Sunday and then play in a Challenger competition next week. We will head to Europe after that as we have registered for three ATP 250 tournaments. We hope to play in as many competitions as possible and end the season on a high.""","Vijay Sundar Prashanth and Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan win maiden ATP Tour crown as a pair.
