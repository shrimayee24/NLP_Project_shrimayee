Stephen A. Smith fires back at LeBron James, again



What did LeBron James say about his feud with Stephen A. Smith?



Just when it seemed that the highly discussed feud between Los Angeles Lakers legend LeBron James and Stephen A. Smith was over, it took a new turn. After James’s response to the confrontation with Smith in his recent chat with Pat McAfee, Smith did not hold back, as he gave a fiery remark to threaten James’ legacy. The incident has been the talk of the town, and it appears that both parties are not ready to move on just yet.ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith has been one of the vocal critics of Bronny James , and now his attention has shifted to Bronny’s father, LeBron James. After James’ discussion of his courtside confrontation with Smith with F-words, the NBA analyst fueled the fire with more gasoline as he did not hesitate to respond with a bold remark.“But don’t the truth matter?” Smith asked his audience during the latest episode of the show on Wednesday's Stephen A. Smith Show . “Because there’s one person in this ordeal that’s telling the truth and it’s me... And there’s a lot of shady stuff that he does and one of the things is passive aggressiveness and the two facedness,” Smith continued. “I happened to know that about him which is why I don’t like him and he don’t like me but it doesn't stop me from being fair and calling it like I see it.”Smith asked James why his son and family were in the Crypto.com arena if he couldn’t handle the criticism. He further slammed the Lakers veteran for his response to Smith on the Pat McAfee show .""It was fresh out of a timeout. It was him walking to the basketball court. It was on national television. The cameras were rolling. And had I done something, what do y'all want me to do? You want me to act new? You want this to be a reincarnation of Chris Rock and Will Smith?"" the NBA analyst recalled the incident.But Smith was all armed up for a fight if the altercation turned into a physical brawl. ""And let me state for the record that while we bring up that, let me assure you it wouldn't have gone down like that. I would have gotten my a** kicked because had that man put his hands on me, I would have immediately swung on him. Immediately. That I'm not going to tolerate,"" he said.He continued, ""I knew he wasn't going to do something like that. There was no fear in my mind about it. It was shock because as I have repeatedly stated, I was not talking about his son. I was talking about him.""Smith also asserted that James’ legacy in the league does not matter much. ""When you retire let's see how much I talk about you then. You won't matter much. I promise you. I won't be talking about you much when you stop playing, but as long as you're playing, I'm going to talk about you because that's my job, and I'm going to be very objective about it. You deserve praise. I'm gonna give it to you. You deserve criticism. I'm gonna give that to, but at least I'm going to tell the truth instead of lying.""James recently had a chat with McAfee on the Pat McAfee show, and he gave his reaction to the whole ordeal. ""Motherf*****, if there's one person who could not wait to address it,"" James said.""What I do know is that he completely missed the whole point. Missed the whole point. Never would I ever not allow to talk about the sport, criticize players what they do on the court. it is your job. It's part of the game. But when you take it and you get personal with it, it is my job to protect my damn household, but protect the players. I think a lot of the media, including him.""Also Read: ""We don't talk, because I'm still playing"": LeBron James opens up on his relationship with Michael Jordan and what the future might hold The Lakers star further mocked Smith, saying that he “is on a Taylor Swift tour run right now.”","ESPN's Stephen A.

Erin Andrews on managing a hectic career while adjusting to the realities of motherhood

Episode 312: CAN YOU GIVE ME A MINUTE?! | Calm Down Podcast

Erin Andrews on juggling a successful broadcasting career, a growing business, and motherhood

Renowned sports broadcaster Erin Andrews is no stranger to navigating a demanding career while balancing personal responsibilities. However, during a recent episode of the Calm Down podcast, Andrews got emotional as she reflected on what she described as an incredibly difficult year juggling work, motherhood, and her personal life.As a veteran Fox Sports reporter, Erin Andrews has spent years covering the NFL with relentless dedication. But now, as a mother to nearly 2-year-old Mack—whom she shares with husband and former NHL player Jarret Stoll—she’s finding that the demands of her career and family life are harder to balance than ever.“It’s really hard, it really is,” Erin Andrews admitted during a live taping of her podcast with co-host Charissa Thompson. “My better half [Stoll] works in the hockey world, and so his season is going on at the same time. This was a really, really hard year. I’m going to get emotional about it.”Erin Andrews recalled that during Mack’s first year as a newborn, it was easier to leave for work. But now, as he grows older and more aware of her departures, the emotional toll has increased. “I had this attitude like, ‘I have this career and this is how it’s going to be.’ And then he starts talking and realizing you’re leaving, and it was just really, really hard.”Beyond her broadcasting career, Andrews is also deeply involved in her clothing line, WEAR by Erin Andrews, making her schedule even more demanding. She shared how she often felt like she wasn’t giving enough to any aspect of her life.“I would just have multiple meltdowns with Charissa saying, ‘I feel like I’m not giving 100 percent of myself to my son, or my job, or my clothing line, and I feel like I am barely above water,’” Andrews revealed. “And then your relationships start to suffer.”She admitted that the intensity of the football season kept her from seeing friends and maintaining personal connections. Once the season ended, she looked back and thought, “I don’t know… excuse me, how the f–k I did that.”Reflecting on the past year, Andrews recognized the need to be kinder to herself. “I need to go easier on myself, and I’ve realized that. I was so worried I wasn’t giving all of myself to both things that I was doing the best I could, and everybody’s fine. I just need to give myself a little grace.”Her openness about the struggles of working motherhood resonates with many, especially those juggling high-pressure careers with raising children. As she moves into the next NFL season, Andrews hopes to apply the lessons she’s learned, prioritizing balance and self-compassion.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s iHeartRadio speech hides a secret—Fans think they’ve uncovered it Her journey, marked by resilience and honesty, continues to inspire, proving that even the most accomplished women face the challenge of finding harmony between career and family.","Erin Andrews is a veteran Fox Sports reporter and mother to nearly 2-year-old Mack.

Edmonton Oilers’ offseason mistake: The fallout of letting key players walk



Paul Bissonnette on the Four Nations Face-Off & Hockey’s Future | Games With Names

Holloway and Broberg making Edmonton regret their decision



Could this mistake cost Edmonton a shot at Stanley Cup?



The Edmonton Oilers made what seemed like a smart financial decision last offseason, choosing not to match the St. Louis Blues ’ offer sheets for Philip Broberg and Dylan Holloway . But now, as both players thrive in St. Louis, Oilers fans and analysts are left questioning whether this was a disastrous misstep. Could letting go of these rising stars come back to haunt Edmonton in the playoffs?The Oilers opted not to match the offer sheets extended to Broberg and Holloway by the St. Louis Blues. Broberg, a 23-year-old defenseman, signed a two-year, $9.16 million deal, while Holloway inked a two-year, $4.59 million contract. With the Oilers already balancing hefty contracts for superstars like Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl, they chose to let both players go rather than stretch their cap space.At first glance, it appeared to be a pragmatic decision. But as the current season unfolds, it’s clear that the Oilers may have underestimated the value of these young talents. Broberg has emerged as a standout defenseman in St. Louis, even outperforming some of Edmonton’s key blueliners in pivotal moments. Holloway, on the other hand, has taken his offensive game to another level, proving to be a dynamic force in the Blues' lineup.Holloway and Broberg have silenced any doubts about their potential. The former first-round picks have played a crucial role in the Blues’ playoff push, with Holloway amassing 58 points (23 goals, 35 assists) in 72 games and Broberg contributing 23 points (seven goals, 16 assists) in 59 games. Their stellar performances have propelled St. Louis into the final wildcard spot in the Western Conference, positioning them as a dangerous team heading into the postseason.Former NHLer Paul Bissonnette recently weighed in on the decision, questioning why Edmonton would willingly part ways with young, physically dominant players after a deep playoff run. His concerns resonate with Oilers fans who now watch Broberg and Holloway excel elsewhere while their team struggles to find the same spark as last season.The Oilers are still a formidable team and remain on track for a playoff berth, but their current roster lacks the depth and youthful energy that Broberg and Holloway provided. Could this move ultimately cost them a Stanley Cup run? If St. Louis continues their surge, Edmonton’s front office may have to answer some tough questions about why they let two rising stars slip away.Also Read: Quinn Hughes: The Canucks’ captain who leads with heart and game-changing plays For now, all eyes will be on St. Louis as they put their six-game winning streak on the line.

The grind of the AHL and the transition to the NHL



Seattle Kraken's Jessica Campbell chats with Julie & Cat | Episode 10

When Jessica Campbell received the life-changing call that she had been named assistant coach of the Seattle Kraken , she immediately broke down in tears of joy. The former player has loved hockey her whole life. She started as a player in Canada before pivoting to coaching. Her hiring in July made history, as she became the first female full-time assistant coach behind an NHL bench. The moment was deeply emotional for Campbell, who had spent years working toward this opportunity.Campbell's milestone moment wasn’t lost on her—or the fans. She received a loud ovation when she was introduced at Climate Pledge Arena during the Kraken’s season opener against the St. Louis Blues.“It was a surreal moment because I had been working toward this for so long,” she shared her feelings. “But when I called home, I just immediately started crying—happy tears. My parents thought something was wrong and instantly went into parent-protect mode, asking, ‘Are you okay?’ Of course, I was okay, and pretty quickly, we were all crying.”Before leaping to the NHL, Campbell worked in the AHL, where the demands of the job took a toll on her. “In this league, that’s a good thing, but it’s also taxing—physically, emotionally, and mentally,” Campbell said. “I never had much time to go home and see my family. Those windows were really small, and you learn to cherish the moments you do get.”Her transition from the AHL to the NHL happened almost overnight. “When I got the news, I was in Seattle at development camp, fully in my AHL role. Then, overnight, I went from being an AHL coach to an NHL coach,” she added.Also read: “Have to go the longer route”: First and only female NHL coach Jessica Campbell talks about her journey The journey hasn’t been easy, but Campbell’s historic rise is a testament to her dedication, resilience, and passion for the game.

IPL 2025: How will KKR, MI, CSK, SRH, RCB fare this season?

After being outclassed in their previous matches, title holders Kolkata Knight Riders and Rajasthan Royals are looking for a quick turnaround when they meet in an IPL match today (March 26).The Knight Riders lost to Royal Challengers Bengaluru by seven wickets in their opener, while the Royals suffered a 44-run defeat against Sunrisers Hyderabad.Both teams share a common issue: their once-impressive batting and bowling units have failed to perform. While the Royals might attribute their bowling struggles to playing at a difficult Hyderabad venue, the Knight Riders lack such an excuse.Except for Sunil Narine, none of the KKR bowlers managed to restrain the aggressive RCB lineup, raising concerns about the effectiveness of mystery spinner Varun Chakravarthy, who struggled significantly. Even on Eden Gardens' pitch, which had some grip, Chakravarthy was hit hard by Phil Salt and Virat Kohli.The KKR camp is hopeful that Chakravarthy will regain his form on a Guwahati pitch that typically offers more assistance to bowlers.The Barsapara Cricket Stadium in Guwahati has hosted four matches in IPL history - two in 2023 and two in 2024. The highest total at this ground came courtesy Rajasthan Royals who scored 199 against Delhi Capitals. The RR vs KKR fixture was washed out last year at this venue.Yashasvi Jaiswal, Sanju Samson, Riyan Parag(c), Nitish Rana, Dhruv Jurel(wk), Shimron Hetmyer, Shubham Dubey, Jofra Archer, Wanindu Hasaranga, Maheesh Theekshana, Tushar Deshpande, Sandeep Sharma, Akash Madhwal.Yudhvir Charak/Kunal Singh Rathore.Quinton de Kock (w), Sunil Narine, Ajinkya Rahane (c), Venkatesh Iyer, Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Rinku Singh, Andre Russell, Ramandeep Singh, Harshit Rana, Spencer Johnson, Varun Chakaravarthy.Vaibhav Arora/Manish Pandey.Sanju Samson (c), Yashasvi Jaiswal, Riyan Parag, Dhruv Jurel, Jofra Archer, Shimron Hetmyer, Tushar Deshpande, Wanindu Hasaranga, Maheesh Theekshana, Nitish Rana, Sandeep Sharma, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Kwena Maphaka, Akash Madhwal, Vaibhav Suryavanshi, Shubham Dubey, Yudhvir Singh, Kunal Singh Rathore, Ashok Sharma, Kumar KartikeyaRinku Singh, Varun Chakaravarthy, Sunil Narine, Andre Russell, Harshit Rana, Ramandeep Singh, Venkatesh Iyer, Quinton de Kock, Rahmanullah Gurbaz, Anrich Nortje, Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Vaibhav Arora, Mayank Markande, Rovman Powell, Manish Pandey, Spencer Johnson, Luvnith Sisodia, Ajinkya Rahane (c), Anukul Roy, Moeen Ali, Chetan SakariyaAs the RR vs KKR head-to-head record reads, the two teams have played each other 30 times in the IPL, with the Royals and the Knight Riders winning 14 each.

Bombay Sports Exchange Episode 1: Interview with Sanjog Gupta, CEO (Sports) at JioStar

A fan breached security at the Barsapara Cricket Stadium in Guwahati during the IPL 2025 match between Rajasthan Royals and Kolkata Knight Riders on Tuesday. The young supporter ran onto the field to touch stand-in captain Riyan Parag 's feet while he was bowling.The incident occurred in the second innings as KKR were chasing 152 runs. The fan managed to reach Parag, touched his feet, and hugged him before security personnel intervened and removed him from the field.This match marked Parag's first appearance as IPL captain in his home state of Assam. He is leading RR for the initial three matches due to regular captain Sanju Samson's finger injury.Samson played in both this match and RR's season opener against Sunrisers Hyderabad, but only as a batter. The BCCI's Centre of Excellence cleared him for batting but advised against wicketkeeping, leading to his role as an Impact Player.This was the season's second pitch invasion incident. The first occurred at Eden Gardens during the KKR-Royal Challengers Bengaluru opener when a fan entered the field to meet Virat Kohli. That individual was arrested and banned from the stadium for the remainder of the season.The incident highlighted Parag's popularity in Assam, as he is the state's first IPL cricketer. Rajasthan Royals' decision to schedule two matches in Guwahati appears strategic, suggesting they view him as a potential successor to Samson.Parag's performance in the match was mixed. He scored a quick 25 runs off 15 balls batting at number three but fell to Varun Chakaravarthy at a crucial moment. His bowling figures were 25 runs from four overs without any wickets.Rajasthan Royals remain without a win in IPL 2025.

LeBron James propelled Los Angeles Lakers to a much needed win against the Indiana Pacers



On Wednesday night, LeBron James delivered a stunning buzzer beater that sparked huge attention from fans. The Los Angeles Lakers superstar’s dramatic game-winning tip-in at the buzzer to lift his team to a 120-119 victory over the Indiana Pacers although he was not in his A-game in terms of scoring. But his contribution to the win can not be ignored.With under five seconds left and the Lakers trailing by a single point, Luka Doncic drove into the lane and released a floater that bounced off the rim. Right on cue, LeBron James, perfectly positioned under the basket, soared up and tipped the ball in before time expired.A review by officials confirmed what everyone had already witnessed— James had indeed beaten the buzzer, sealing a much-needed win for Los Angeles. The victory snapped a three-game losing streak and gave the Lakers renewed momentum as they push toward the playoffs.Through three quarters, the four-time MVP had just three points on an 0-for-6 shooting. Entering the fourth quarter, James quickly put up back-to-back baskets, sparking a Lakers run that turned a tight contest into a 13-point lead. However, Indiana wouldn’t go down without a fight.The Pacers answered with a 13-0 run of their own, erasing the deficit and even taking the lead late in the game. As 42 seconds remaining, Tyrese Haliburton’s three-point play put Indiana ahead 119-118. But after a missed three from Bennedict Mathurin, the Lakers had one last chance, setting up James for his iconic finish.James finished with 13 points, extending his streak of scoring at least 10 points per game to an astonishing 1,283 consecutive outings. The last time he failed to reach double digits was on January 5, 2007.The only player who comes remotely close to James in this category is Michael Jordan, whose streak of 866 games is a distant second. James has managed to keep it intact for over 18 years.The win improved Los Angeles to 44-28 on the season, tying them with Memphis for the fourth seed in the Western Conference. With just 10 games remaining, the Lakers are looking to improve their playoff position and regain the form that saw them go on an eight-game winning streak earlier this season.Also Read: “You won’t matter much”: Stephen A.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

NEW DELHI: Kolkata Knight Riders had a disappointing start to their IPL 2025 campaign against Royal Challengers Bengaluru on March 22 at Eden Gardens, but they bounced back in style on Wednesday. The defending champions put up a commanding performance to register their first win of the season, securing two valuable points in the standings. The star of the night was Quinton de Kock , whose stellar knock powered KKR to an emphatic eight-wicket victory over Rajasthan Royals . This win also marked KKR’s first triumph under Ajinkya Rahane ’s captaincy.De Kock’s brilliance ensured that KKR remained in control throughout the chase. His combination of clean ball-striking and sharp game awareness reaffirmed why he is regarded as one of the most dangerous openers in the IPL. His innings was a textbook display of counter-attacking cricket—starting with caution before seamlessly shifting gears to dismantle the opposition’s bowling attack with exquisite timing and brute power.With this dominant win, KKR not only got off the mark in IPL 2025 but also sent a strong statement to their rivals. Under Rahane’s leadership, the team has gained momentum, with de Kock leading the charge in spectacular fashion.Earlier in the match, Rahane won the toss and opted to field first, putting Rajasthan Royals on the back foot. Led by Riyan Parag, RR struggled to put up a competitive total as KKR’s disciplined bowling unit applied relentless pressure. Yashasvi Jaiswal (29 off 24) and Dhruv Jurel (33 off 28) were the only notable contributors as the Royals managed to post 151/9 in their 20 overs.KKR’s bowlers were clinical, with Varun Chakaravarthy (2/17) and Moeen Ali (2/23) stifling RR’s middle order, while Harshit Rana and Vaibhav Arora chipped in with crucial wickets to keep the total within reach.Chasing 152, KKR faced an early setback when opener Moeen Ali was run out for just 5. However, de Kock stepped up with an authoritative display, dismantling the RR bowling attack with a breathtaking array of strokes. Despite losing captain Rahane for 18, the South African wicketkeeper-batsman kept the chase on track with a flurry of boundaries and well-calculated big hits.De Kock’s explosive innings featured eight fours and six towering sixes, making light work of the Rajasthan bowling attack. His heroics ensured KKR cruised to victory with plenty of overs to spare.Next up, KKR will take on five-time champions Mumbai Indians at the Wankhede Stadium on Monday, looking to build on their newfound momentum.",Kolkata Knight Riders beat Rajasthan Royals by eight wickets in IPL 2025.

NEW DELHI: Quinton de Kock delivered a masterclass in controlled aggression, smashing an unbeaten 97 off 61 balls to steer Kolkata Knight Riders to a commanding eight-wicket victory over Rajasthan Royals in their IPL 2025 clash on Wednesday. On a challenging Barsapara surface, KKR’s disciplined bowling unit, led by spinners Varun Chakravarthy (2/17) and Moeen Ali (2/23), restricted RR to a modest 151/9.Despite the tricky conditions, De Kock paced the chase beautifully, his innings decorated with eight fours and six sixes. KKR reached the target comfortably in 17.3 overs, securing their first win of the season in style.KKR’s chase remained in control, with the required run rate staying manageable throughout. Though they lost Moeen Ali (5) and captain Ajinkya Rahane (18) early, De Kock anchored the innings masterfully. He found solid support in young Angkrish Raghuvanshi, who contributed 22 off 17 balls. The duo’s unbeaten 83-run partnership off just 44 deliveries sealed the victory for the defending champions.The South African keeper-batter played a near-flawless innings, relying on precision and placement rather than reckless power-hitting. He took calculated risks when needed, dismantling RR’s bowling attack with ease. His 35-ball half-century was highlighted by a towering six over wide long-on off Wanindu Hasaranga—his third maximum of the innings.RR’s strategy of over-relying on spin played into KKR’s hands, allowing their batters to settle in. Hasaranga, who had previously dismissed De Kock twice in the IPL, found himself on the receiving end this time. A more aggressive strategy—introducing Jofra Archer earlier—could have added pressure, but the English speedster was held back until the 18th over, by which time KKR needed only 17 runs from 18 balls.De Kock quickly wrapped up the chase, taking Archer apart with a boundary and two massive sixes, sealing KKR’s emphatic win.Earlier, KKR’s bowlers turned the game in their favor with timely strikes. Chakravarthy and Moeen Ali broke the Royals’ middle order with two wickets each in consecutive overs after the powerplay, shifting the momentum decisively. Seamer Vaibhav Arora (2/33) proved expensive but made crucial breakthroughs, dismissing RR skipper Sanju Samson (13 off 11) and impact substitute Shubham Dubey (9).Harshit Rana (2/36) delivered at the death, removing Dhruv Jurel (33 off 28) and the dangerous Shimron Hetmyer (7) in a crucial penultimate over. A late cameo from Jofra Archer (16 off 7) helped RR scrape past 150, but Spencer Johnson (1/42) dismissed him on the penultimate ball of their innings.RR initially looked set for a big total at 54/1, with Yashasvi Jaiswal (29 off 24) and local favorite Riyan Parag (25 off 15) leading the charge. Parag, captaining RR for the first time at his home ground, showed early intent, smashing a six off Harshit Rana and playing the shot of the innings—a stunning lofted drive off Vaibhav Arora straight down the ground.Jaiswal, dropped on 19, ended the powerplay with a six as RR reached a promising 54/1 after six overs. However, KKR hit back immediately, with mystery spinner Chakravarthy triggering a collapse by dismissing the well-set Parag with a deceptive 113kph delivery in the seventh over.With this victory, KKR not only opened their account in IPL 2025 but also sent a strong message to their competitors. They will now shift focus to their next challenge against five-time champions Mumbai Indians at the Wankhede Stadium.",Kolkata Knight Riders beat Rajasthan Royals by eight wickets in their IPL 2025 clash.

Lucknow Super Giants:

NEW DELHI: Lucknow Super Giants (LSG), smarting from a narrow opening defeat, face a daunting task against the explosive Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in their upcoming IPL clash on Thursday at Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium, Hyderabad.SRH, last year's runners-up, began their campaign with a statement victory, dismantling the Rajasthan Royals by 44 runs and setting the tournament's early pace.SRH's batting acumen was on full display, amassing a near-record 286 runs. Ishan Kishan, their new recruit, announced his arrival with a blistering century, while established stars like Abhishek Sharma, Travis Head, and Heinrich Klaasen maintained their aggressive approach.This relentless batting firepower, coupled with Nitish Kumar Reddy's explosive cameo, makes SRH a formidable force.LSG's bowling unit will need to be at their tactical best to counter this threat.The tournament has already witnessed a barrage of sixes, highlighting the high-scoring nature of this year's IPL.LSG's bowlers, particularly the spin trio of Ravi Bishnoi, Manimaran Siddharth, and Digvesh Rathi, will need to be precise and disciplined against SRH's aggressive batting lineup.While LSG showed promise in their opening match against the Delhi Capitals, their middle-order collapse proved costly.Despite a blistering start by Mitchell Marsh and Nicholas Pooran's late heroics, their inability to maintain momentum in the middle overs allowed Delhi to claw back into the game.LSG skipper Rishabh Pant will be eager to make amends for a forgettable first outing. His early dismissal and a missed stumping opportunity proved crucial in the context of a close finish.The match promises to be a fascinating contest between LSG's batting firepower and SRH's explosive batting lineup.LSG will need to address their middle-order vulnerabilities and devise a clear bowling strategy to counter SRH's aggressive approach.

The Women's Premier League (WPL) will maintain its current structure of five teams, according to IPL chairman Arun Dhumal , who serves on the WPL committee. The committee is led by BCCI president Roger Binny.The BCCI had initially planned to expand the number of teams after three seasons but has now decided to focus on strengthening the existing format.""To further strengthen this tournament for the time being, we want to consolidate before we take a call on further addition of any team. There are no immediate plans (to add teams),"" Dhumal told news agency PTI.""So, within three editions, WPL has grown phenomenally in terms of traction, for in-stadium attendance. All the broadcast numbers are very, very encouraging. And it has given new impetus to women's cricket worldwide. So, we are hoping this continues to grow. And this augurs very well for not only the tournament, but women's cricket in general,"" he added.Unlike the Indian Premier League, the WPL has not implemented a home and away format. The latest edition, which concluded on March 15, was hosted across multiple venues including Mumbai, Bengaluru, Baroda, and Lucknow.Mumbai Indians secured their second title in three years by defeating Delhi Capitals in the final match in Mumbai.The BCCI generated Rs 4670 crore from selling five teams representing Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, UP, and Gujarat.The media rights were sold for Rs 951 crore, establishing WPL as the second-largest women's league globally before its inception.",The Women's Premier League (WPL) will maintain its current structure of five teams.

SHILLONG: The fans came out in large numbers, making their presence felt with some lusty cheering. But India, playing their second international match at the JN Stadium here, could not give them the joy they had hoped for as their opening AFC Asian Cup Qualifier against Bangladesh ended 0-0 on Tuesday.With the other match of Group C between Hong Kong and Singapore also ending in a 0-0 draw, all four in the group are level on one point each with five more games left to decide the toppers and eventual qualifiers for the tournament to be held Saudi Arabia in 2027.The match began on a frustrating note for India as they could have been two goals behind within the opening 20 minutes — due to silly mistakes by goalkeeper Vishal Kaith and Sandesh Jhingan. While Mojibor Jony failed to slot home a terrible clearance from Kaith in the opening minute, Shariyar Emon glanced wide a gorgeous cross from Mohammed Shakil Topu.India managed more possession in the first half but it was Hamza Choudhury’s game reading in midfield that kept Bangladesh in the hunt for a breakthrough. While Mohd Ridoy’s clearance of a Liston Colaco free-kick in the 23rd minute could have ended in an own goal, it was in the 31st minute that the best chance of the half came for India.Colaco sent a cross from the left flank to the right of the goal after combining from behind with Subhasish Bose. But Udanta’s diving header was saved by Bangladesh custodian Mitul Marma, who then went on to collect Farukh’s soft try from the ensuing rebound. The chance lifted India’s game with Colaco looking more dangerous and Sunil Chhetri lurking more often near the goal. However, the constant cheers from the stands could not inspire a breakthrough.India started the second half with more purpose. But with Hamza Choudhury marking Chhetri during set-pieces, the Indian legend failed to win his duels with the former Premier League veteran.Manolo Marquez’s ‘men in blue’ did come close in the 55th and 57th minutes. First, Colaco’s curling header evaded an onrushing Chhetri, and then Hamza blocked the comeback man’s shot.",India and Bangladesh play out 0-0 draw in their opening AFC Asian Cup qualifier.

NEW DELHI: India and Bangladesh played out a goal-less draw in their 2027 AFC Asian Cup qualifying match on Tuesday. The Bangladesh side showed better form in the initial half, generating more attacks and corner kicks, though without creating definitive scoring opportunities.The second half saw India displaying improved control, applying substantial pressure on Bangladesh, yet struggling to create meaningful chances.A crucial moment occurred in the 12th minute when Indian goalkeeper Vishal Kaith's miscalculated kick deflected off an opponent. Mohammed Ridoy attempted to capitalise with a left-footed shot, but Subhasish Bose made a vital clearance on the goal line.India's notable opportunity arrived in the 31st minute when Udanta Singh's header from Liston Colaco's left-wing cross was saved by Bangladesh keeper Mitul Marma.India's second-half dominance included Bose's ambitious long-range attempt in the 68th minute, which narrowly missed the left corner despite beating the goalkeeper.Five minutes afterwards, Farukh Choudhary's right-footed shot deflected off a Bangladeshi defender and went wide.In the 84th minute, Sunil Chhetri found space for a free header in the box, but his attempt lacked both accuracy and power.Bangladesh's Hamza Choudhury, on loan at Sheffield United from Leicester City, remained largely ineffective throughout the match.The teams will meet again on November 18 in Bangladesh.

Shillong: How much can one footballer influence the fate of a team or the course of its history? Sunil Chhetri made some good points on that with a strike in his comeback for India vs Maldives in the friendly last week as the hosts returned to winning ways after over a year of winless results.And while he and coach Manolo Marquez will look to carry that momentum into the crucial AFC Asian Cup Qualifier against Bangladesh here on Tuesday, their opponents on the day will be eager for the trump card up their sleeve, Hamza Choudhury , to earn their first win against India since 2003.The lead-up to the teams’ opening Group C match at JN Stadium here may have been dominated by the hype surrounding two footballers – one, the third highest active scorer in international football after Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, and the other, a veteran of 57 Premier League matches for Leicester City.But all 22 players on the pitch will have to play their roles well to churn out three points and take a positive step towards qualification for Saudi Arabia 2027. “I think it’s exciting having Hamza and having Sunil back. It’s going to be really competitive. But it’s not going to be only about them,” Bangladesh coach Javier Cabrera said on Monday. “If we win tomorrow, it will not only be for Hamza.”His fellow Spaniard and Indian counterpart Marquez echoed the same feelings for a Chhetri-inspired India while also acknowledging the importance of starting the qualifiers on a winning note, with matches against Hong Kong and Singapore to follow thereafter. “The first game is obviously very important. It’s a short competition, only the top team qualifies for the tournament. There are six games and we need to finish first. We want to get the maximum points possible to qualify for Saudi Arabia,” he said on match eve on Monday.Already laden with injury woes, the latest being in-form Brandon Fernandes against Maldives, it will be interesting to see if Marquez utilises the pace of the young Macarton Nickson or the experience of Udanta Singh — the new inductees into the squad — to make up for Fernandes’ absence on Tuesday.He will, however, have been impressed by performances of Hmingthanmawia Ralte at right-back and, going forward, goalscorer Liston Colaco down the left, debutant Ayush Dev Chhetri in midfield, and the aerial prowess of Rahul Bheke, and will hope for them to carry the show vs Bangladesh.However, India have drawn two of their last three matches against Bangladesh, all of which came in the Igor Stimac era, and were lucky to get away with a point through Adil Khan’s late equaliser in their last clash. While the hosts will be wary of a motivated Bangladesh having Sheffield United’s Choudhury making his debut for his national team, it wouldn’t be a surprise if Choudhury is pushed further upfield, unlike the deeper midfield role he occupies for his clubs in England, to make a difference with his quality higher up.Also, the partnership that he scripts with skipper and veteran Jamal Bhuyan in the middle could well decide Bangladesh’s fortunes in this match and throughout the qualifying campaign.“We know it’s not only Hamza, they have other good players. (And) the same coach for the last three years with the same philosophy. Continuity is obviously important in any team,” acknowledged the Indian coach, adding, “But I feel that if we play a good game, we will win this one. But obviously, if you ask Javi Cabrera the same, he will say the opposite.”Tuesday will reveal which Spaniard emerges on top in the South Asian derby or if the cycle of draws between them continues.","India take on Bangladesh in their first AFC Asian Cup qualifier on Tuesday.

Shillong: When Shillong hosted its first-ever international match last Wednesday, less than 7,000 fans in this football-crazy region turned up at the JN Stadium to watch India clinch their first international win in 12 games, and the first since November 2023.The first taste of international football in Meghalaya was in stark contrast with the three Indian Super League matches played here, each of which garnered over twice the footfall for the FIFA friendly.Interestingly, the largest crowd was for NorthEast United FC’s match against Bengaluru FC — with fans filling up the venue to see Sunil Chhetri in action. But the veteran’s comeback in India colours inspired very few live-viewing enthusiasts.Even Shillong Lajong owner Larsing Ming , who has long been associated with Meghalaya and Indian football , couldn’t fathom the contrast, reluctantly attributing it to a probable “lack of awareness” for the fixture.However, locals are optimistic, and the picture is expected to be very different for India’s AFC Asian Cup Qualifier against Bangladesh on Tuesday with officials confirming that ticket sales have been quite high and are expecting the match tickets to be sold out by Monday.Arki Nongrum, the founder of sports management firm ISMG, told TOI on Sunday that his firm is working with the Meghalaya govt to facilitate the fixtures. “A lot of people are just eager to watch a Premier League player in action, like Hamza Choudhury,” he said of the local enthusiasts, who are huge followers of English football and would be there to see the Sheffield United player, on loan from former EPL champions, Leicester City, play live.","Shillong hosted its first-ever international match last Wednesday.

World number one Aryna Sabalenka fought back in the second set to secure her spot in the semi-finals of the Miami Open , defeating China's Zheng Qinwen 6-2, 7-5 on Tuesday.This win marks Sabalenka’s first appearance in the semi-finals in Miami, where she’ll meet Italy's Jasmine Paolini for a chance to reach the final.It seemed like a straightforward match for the Belarusian against the ninth seed Zheng as she easily took the first set. However, Zheng made adjustments and came out strong in the second set, breaking Sabalenka twice to establish a 4-2 lead.Sabalenka faced significant pressure at 0-40 but, after showing some frustration, rallied to hold serve and tie it at 4-4. She then unleashed a powerful finish, breaking Zheng again to lead 6-5 and serving confidently to clinch the match.""Honestly every match is tough against her, I always have to work really hard to get the win and today was an incredible level from both of us,"" said Sabalenka.""I'm super happy to get this win. I'm super happy with the way I handled all the emotions and handled the pressure,"" she added.Meanwhile, Paolini advanced to the semi-finals with a decisive 6-3, 6-2 victory over Poland's Magda Linette . The sixth seed, who reached the finals at Wimbledon and the French Open last year, becomes the first Italian to reach the last four in Miami.Despite a lengthy rain delay, Paolini quickly established control over Linette, who had previously upset Coco Gauff in the quarters. Paolini, aiming for her second WTA 1000 title since winning in Dubai last year, exuded confidence and expressed that she knew her hard work would eventually lead to results.""I think I didn't play bad this season but I just didn't have a great result. But I was there. I lost many matches but to big opponents,"" she said.""It was tough but I was repeating to myself that I was there - maybe I just needed a little more confidence and it came here maybe,"" she said.In Wednesday's quarter-finals, second seed Iga Swiatek will face Alexandra Eala, the teenage wildcard from the Philippines who has already defeated Australian Open champion Madison Keys.Additionally, Britain's Emma Raducanu, who is experiencing her best tournament run since winning the US Open in 2021, will take on American fourth seed Jessica Pegula.","Aryna Sabalenka defeated China's Zheng Qinwen 6-2, 7-5 on Tuesday.
