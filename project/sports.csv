Wayne Gretzky is a name synonymous with greatness in the NHL , but the origin of his famous nickname, ""The Great One,"" has a surprising twist. During a recent segment on NHL on TNT’s Face Off, Wayne Gretzky shared that his father, Walter Gretzky, was not a fan of the moniker when it first appeared during his youth hockey days.Long before Wayne Gretzky shattered NHL records, he was just a ten-year-old prodigy from Brantford, Ontario, netting an unbelievable 400 goals in a single season. A reporter from the London Free Press came to profile the young phenom. At the conclusion of the article, the journalist proposed a fitting nickname: “The Great One,” drawing inspiration from legends like “Mr. Hockey” and “The Golden Jet.”“They said, ‘We should just call him The Great One,’” Gretzky recalled. “Well, my dad tried to kill that right away — it just kept coming back.”Gretzky believed such a title placed unnecessary pressure on his young son. He didn’t want Wayne to bear the weight of premature hype. But despite his father's objections, the nickname gained traction and became permanently linked to the budding superstar.Over time, the family had no choice but to embrace the label. “Finally, I just was like, ‘Well, we’re going to have to live with it,’” Gretzky admitted.And live with it he did. By the time he retired in 1999, Wayne Gretzky had not only fulfilled but exceeded the expectations that came with such a grand title. With 894 goals, 2,857 career points, and 61 NHL records, “The Great One” wasn’t just a nickname—it became his rightful legacy.Switching gears to current NHL action, Wayne Gretzky also shared his thoughts on the Edmonton Oilers' Game 5 loss to the Florida Panthers. “Right from the get-go, Florida played a really smart, intelligent road game,” he said, noting that Edmonton looked “cautious” and “on their heels” early on.Also Read: No longer Canadian: Wayne Gretzky’s Canadian identity questioned after Donald Trump friendship sparks controversy Wayne Gretzky’s nickname, “The Great One,” once resisted by his father, ultimately came to represent not just early talent, but a lifetime of excellence, From a childhood nickname to a storied NHL career, Gretzky’s story remains one of humility, brilliance, and enduring greatness.","Wayne Gretzky's famous nickname, ""The Great One,"" originated from a profile of his youth hockey dominance.

Taylor Swift breaks from Blake Lively after shocking betrayal as Travis Kelce becomes her emotional shield,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/taylor-swift-breaks-from-blake-lively-after-shocking-betrayal-as-travis-kelce-becomes-her-emotional-shield/articleshow/121974781.cms,"The once-close friendship between Taylor Swift and Blake Lively has reportedly fractured due to a $400 million lawsuit (Getty Images)

Text messages and court drama reveal a hidden strain in the friendship

Travis Kelce stands by Taylor Swift as she distances herself from Lively

Once hailed as one of the most charming celebrity friendships, the bond between Taylor Swift and Blake Lively is now fractured beyond repair. The fallout stems from a $400 million lawsuit involving actor-director Justin Baldoni and Lively, where unexpected court revelations have dragged Swift’s name into the legal storm. According to sources close to the matter, the pop star is ""deeply wounded"" by how the situation has unfolded.The friendship, often displayed publicly at NFL games and star-studded events, came under scrutiny when Page Six reported that private text messages from Blake Lively were presented in court. In those messages, Lively referred to Swift as one of her “dragons”—a reference to Game of Thrones, but interpreted by many as dismissive or even manipulative.Though Swift is not a party to the lawsuit, her indirect association has sparked media frenzy, with insiders claiming, “even if she heals, the scar will remain.” The messages reportedly exposed a side of Lively that Swift never anticipated, casting doubt on the authenticity of their bond. “The friendship Lively portrayed with Swift wasn’t entirely accurate,” the source added, stating it was rooted more in lifestyle camaraderie than genuine personal connection.The Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, Swift’s current boyfriend, has reportedly pledged to protect her emotionally during the turmoil. The lawsuit's public nature has added stress to Swift’s otherwise private life, especially as she balances her global Eras Tour with ongoing personal challenges.Their last public appearance together was during Super Bowl LVIII, cheering Kelce on from a VIP suite. But given the emotional toll of recent events, future public moments between the two women seem increasingly unlikely.This friendship unraveling shows how celebrity relationships can collapse under the weight of legal disputes and unwanted publicity. Taylor Swift's unintentional entanglement in Lively’s legal issues offers a sobering reminder: in the world of fame and billion-dollar lawsuits, even the strongest bonds can be tested—and sometimes broken—without warning.Also Read: Taylor Swift's texts exposed in Blake Lively court loss — will this strain the popstar's relationship with Travis Kelce?

Boston Bruins open to trading seventh overall pick for roster-ready player

Noah Dobson and Alexander Romanov floated as trade options

Trade talks expected to intensify as draft nears

The New York Islanders appear to be going all in ahead of the NHL Draft. According to multiple reports, they are aggressively pursuing a second top-10 pick to go alongside the one they already hold. The rumored goal is to select both star defenseman Matthew Schaefer and local standout forward James Hagens.The Boston Bruins, owners of the 7th overall pick, are reportedly willing to part with the selection if it lands them a player who can help immediately. Their front office has made it clear they are more focused on improving the current roster rather than adding another developmental prospect.According to reports from RG Media’s James Murphy and Stefan Rosney, talks between the Bruins and Islanders have become increasingly serious. Sources close to the situation suggest that Boston’s priority is to add a top-six forward or a top-four defenseman if they are to surrender such a valuable draft position.In order for the trade to materialize, the Islanders would have to offer more than draft capital. Reports indicate that defensemen Noah Dobson and Alexander Romanov, along with forward Jean-Gabriel Pageau, have come up in trade discussions.Among the trio, Dobson would be the most impactful piece.The 24-year-old logged a career-best season and has grown into one of the Islanders’ most dependable blue liners.With less than a week to go before the NHL Draft on June 27, time is ticking. The Islanders remain determined to secure their draft targets, while the Bruins weigh immediate returns against long-term prospects.This deal, if it happens, could reshape both rosters heading into the 2025–26 season. League observers now have June 27 circled, as this rumored transaction might be the headline moment of the draft.If the Islanders manage to pull off this trade, it would mark a bold shift in their strategy, signaling a true commitment to building a new core. For the Bruins, moving the pick could fast-track their push for contention.Read more: NHL trade rumor: Edmonton Oilers eye bold eight-year deal in less than 24 hours after Stanley Cup loss","The New York Islanders appear to be going all in ahead of the NHL Draft.

Washington Wizards aim for Dylan Harper or Jeremiah Fears with bold trade offers

Dylan Harper and Jeremiah Fears could reshape the Washington Wizards’ future

The Washington Wizards are reportedly willing to trade some ‘surprising names’ in an effort to move up to the No. 2 pick. The Washington Wizards may be planning something big. Right before the 2025 NBA Draft, the team has started making trade offers. They already have the 6th and 18th picks, but that may not be enough for them. Now, a report says they want to move up—way up. Who they’re after might surprise you.According to Grant Afseth, who shared the news on X (formerly Twitter), the Washington Wizards want to get the No. 2 overall pick.They’ve made several offers to teams in the top five. In these talks, they even offered to trade some “surprising names” from their roster. That’s what league sources told Grant Afseth.Right now, the Wizards have pick No. 6 and pick No. 18. But they want more.Why? They are targeting two of the best young guards in the draft—Dylan Harper and Jeremiah Fears.Dylan Harper is a 6'5"" guard known for his smart plays and calm game. He is from Don Bosco Prep in New Jersey and is ranked as a top prospect. Most experts think he will be picked in the top three.Jeremiah Fears is another top guard.He’s known for his quick moves and strong defense. Scouts like his energy and court vision.So far, no team has accepted the Washington Wizards’ trade offers. But talks are still going.Dylan Harper and Jeremiah Fears are two of the biggest names in the 2025 NBA Draft. Dylan is the son of Ron Harper, a five-time NBA champion. He’s calm on the court, makes smart passes, and scores when it matters. If the Washington Wizards get him, he could become the face of their team.Jeremiah Fears is smaller but very fast. He can shoot from deep and guard top players. He grew up in Illinois and quickly became a top name in the draft class.The NBA Draft will happen on June 26, in Brooklyn, New York.If the Washington Wizards want either of these players, they’ll need to act fast. And they may need to give up a big name to get what they want.Fans are waiting to see what will happen next.Also Read: The Los Angeles Lakers took a risk on Luka Doncic and now the weight of that decision is starting to show","The Washington Wizards are reportedly willing to trade some ‘surprising names’ in an effort to move up to the No. 2 pick.

NEW DELHI: Former Indian cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar hailed Rishabh Pant as the country's ""greatest wicketkeeper-batter ever"" following his stunning century against England, calling him a ""breath of fresh air."" Pant continued his brilliant form in Test cricket by registering his seventh Test century, breaking multiple records during his innings in the first Test against England at Leeds.Speaking on Match Centre Live after the first session, JioStar expert Manjrekar said, ""By far, India's greatest ever Test batter-keeper. I was worried when he was in the 90s that he might end up getting his 8th 90 of his career. It is just unbelievable that he has so many 90s! But he's a breath of fresh air.""""When he got out and raised his bat, there were a lot of English supporters who stood up and applauded that innings. That's what we love about England -- these guys come to watch good cricket. They want their team to win, but when they see excellence from the opposition, you can see true appreciation for it,"" he added.On Saturday, Pant surpassed MS Dhoni to become the Indian wicketkeeper with the most Test centuries. His knock of 134 off 178 balls, laced with 12 fours and six sixes at a strike rate above 75, came in testing overseas conditions — a territory where Pant continues to shine.This was his fifth Test century in SENA (South Africa, England, New Zealand, and Australia) countries — the most by any Asian batter. Three of these have come in England, with the remaining two in Australia and South Africa.Pant also equalled Sri Lanka’s Kumar Sangakkara (seven centuries) for the most Test hundreds by a designated wicketkeeper from Asia.Earlier on Friday, Pant crossed the 3,000-run mark in Test cricket, becoming only the second Indian wicketkeeper after Dhoni to do so. He also overtook Dhoni in terms of runs scored by an Asian keeper-batter in SENA countries.In 44 Tests, Pant has scored 3,082 runs at an average of 43.40, with seven centuries and 15 fifties in 76 innings — all at a strike rate of 73.69.In the match, after England chose to bowl first, centuries from Yashasvi Jaiswal (101), captain Shubman Gill (147), and Pant (134) helped India post a total of 471. Ben Stokes (4/66) and Josh Tongue (4/86) were the standout bowlers for the hosts.","Former Indian cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar hails Rishabh Pant as the country's ""greatest wicketkeeper-batter ever"" Pant scored his seventh Test century, breaking multiple records during his innings in the first Test against England at Leeds.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121995118,imgsize-41198,width-400,resizemode-4/121995118.jpg"

Dwyane Wade’s legendary NBA career has produced unforgettable moments, but a recent fan interaction may have added one of the most bizarre to his post-retirement highlight reel. While attending Fanatics Fest, the former Miami Heat star came face-to-face with a life-sized banana boat, courtesy of some creative fans. They actually asked him to sign it. What followed was a hilarious callback to one of the most iconic off-court images in NBA history, all thanks to his wife, Gabrielle Union , who reposted the incident on her Instagram story.The banana boat has long been part of Dwyane Wade’s public lore. Back in 2015, Wade, Gabrielle Union, LeBron James , and Chris Paul vacationed in the Bahamas. During that trip, they were photographed riding an inflatable banana boat, a photo that instantly went viral and became an internet sensation. Despite its global reach, Wade insists it wasn’t meant to be seen.Fast forward, the incident has resurfaced, and Dwyane actually signed on the banana boat. “D-Wade signed on actual banana boat…” the video caption read on the story of Union. In the video, Wade was seen with his swift chuckles. “What you want me to sign in as?” Wade asked. “To the gang,” the fans responded, prompting Wade to repeat with the same chuckle. Wade obliged and later shared the surreal moment on Instagram.Speaking on the Pardon My Take podcast, Wade previously shared, “My wife wanted to go on a banana boat. So, Chris Paul, Bron, and I all got on a banana boat. Now, we were in the middle of nowhere, no one was supposed to know this but us.” He continued, “Someone took a photo from God knows where. No one was supposed to have seen us on a banana boat!”Adding a playful touch, he joked, “If I knew they were taking a photo, we would have looked a little cooler.”Gabrielle Union also had fun with the moment. She once revealed that it was her idea to go on the banana boat in the first place, unknowingly setting the stage for one of the most talked-about images in sports pop culture.The ""Banana Boat Crew"" eventually became an unofficial nickname for Wade, LeBron, Chris Paul, and Carmelo Anthony, even though Anthony wasn’t in the original photo. “Melo showed up late,” Wade said. “Had he been there on time, he’d be in it too.”Also Read: Dwyane Wade’s wife Gabrielle Union keeps their love alive with touching tributes and romantic gestures amid vacation in France Now, years later, fans are still keeping the memory alive, this time with a Sharpie and a floating yellow tribute.

Deion Sanders Jr. Has Built a Strong Brand Around Colorado Football

A funny thing happened this weekend that fans can’t stop talking about. It wasn’t on a football field, but it still involved big names from the Colorado Buffaloes.

He says he beat Travis Hunter not once, but twice and he didn’t hold back while saying it.Deion Sanders Jr. shared a video on Instagram on Friday, June 14, 2025, after a light tennis tournament during a family vacation. It happened at a private tennis court, where the Sanders family and close friends gathered for enjoyment.In the video, Bucky, wearing a headband and holding a tennis racket, confidently says, “I just beat Travis in tennis twice. I whooped him twice… So bro is really a*s, bro.” The clip went viral across fan pages and X (formerly Twitter), especially among Colorado Buffaloes fans.Travis Hunter, who has a close bond with Bucky since his time at Jackson State in 2021, didn’t respond online, but fans were quick to joke about the friendly rivalry. Hunter had previously called Bucky his “big brother.” Their friendship has been strong since Hunter shocked the football world by choosing to play under Deion Sanders at Jackson State, and later followed him to Colorado.The tennis match was just for fun, but Bucky didn’t miss the chance to brag a little, leaving fans laughing and tagging Hunter for a rematch.Deion Sanders Jr. isn’t just Coach Prime’s son — he’s also behind the popular Well Off Media YouTube channel that has made Colorado Buffaloes one of the most followed college football teams in the country.Also Read: Fanatics Fest explodes with surprises as Travis Scott,Tom Braddy and Tracy McGrady show up for epic panels Since Deion Sanders became head coach in 2023, Bucky has filmed the team’s practices, locker room speeches, and daily life.

Los Angeles Lakers open to trading Austin Reaves this offseason but one name in Utah's package could seal the deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/los-angeles-lakers-open-to-trading-austin-reaves-this-offseason-but-one-name-in-utahs-package-could-seal-the-deal/articleshow/121998121.cms,"(Image Source - Getty Images)

Utah Jazz's pitch could tempt Rob Pelinka if it includes both size and scoring help

The whispers are growing louder in Los Angeles. Austin Reaves, a breakout performer and fan favorite, may not be wearing the purple and gold for much longer. While the Lakers aren’t actively shopping him, they're listening and one team, the Utah Jazz, is emerging as a serious suitor. What makes this more than just noise is the inclusion of a specific name in Utah’s package. If Walker Kessler is involved, this deal could become very real, very fast.The Jazz are reportedly focused on Reaves, and the Lakers are closely monitoring the situation. What gives this trade potential is the blend of two very different yet equally valuable players: Walker Kessler and Collin Sexton. Kessler, a 7-foot defensive force, provides the rim protection and size that the Lakers have been missing during their playoff difficulties.At the same time, Sexton brings a scoring surge off the bench, able to fill the score sheet when LeBron James or Luka Dončić need assistance. This combination meets multiple needs for the Lakers — interior defense, athleticism, and bench scoring — and together they represent the kind of immediate impact that Rob Pelinka would need to justify parting ways with Reaves.Reaves isn’t just a dependable contributor — he’s coming off a breakout season where he averaged over 20 points, nearly 6 assists, and shot close to 38% from beyond the arc.He’s shown composure in critical moments, has good chemistry with the stars, and perhaps most importantly, is tied to a four-year deal that averages around $13.5 million per season.That’s incredible value in today’s cap-heavy league. However, with a player option on the horizon in 2026, the Lakers risk losing him for nothing if they don’t take action now. It’s that ticking clock — paired with a package like Utah’s — that makes these trade discussions so serious.Even though Reaves is a fan favorite in the locker room and has expressed his desire to stay a Laker for life, the NBA operates as a business — and Pelinka is running out of time to create a championship team around LeBron and Luka. With Desmond Bane leaving Memphis and Jayson Tatum sidelined in Boston, there's a unique opportunity to advance in the West.Also Read: Tracy McGrady breaks silence on what could’ve happened if he played alongside Shaquille O’Neal during the Kobe Bryant era The Lakers aren't going to trade Reaves just to make a deal.

Tennis star Kei Nishikori caught up in messy scandal after alleged years-long affair with model

Japanese tennis player Kei Nishikori has been embroiled in a controversy after Japanese media reported that he was cheating on his wife, Mai Yamauchi, with model Azuki Oguchi. The claim was proven true with his public apology to his family, fans, and sponsors. The news comes at a time when Kei Nishikori had withdrawn from Wimbledon 2025 and has shocked the tennis world, casting further doubts over his off-court woes.Kei Nishikori married Mai Yamauchi in December 2020, and they have two children together. The scandal erupted when reports claimed that the former world No. 4 and now world No. 61 had been dating Japanese model Azuki Oguchi since 2022. Their romance reportedly began in Hawaii, and they were spotted at the Tokyo residence of Oguchi on June 11, 2025.In a statement, he apologized to his family, fans, sponsors, and tennis officials for the ""dishonest behavior"" and emotional distress it inflicted. “I deeply apologize for causing discomfort to everyone who supports me—tennis fans, tennis associations, sponsors, and other related parties—and for their concern and inconvenience due to my dishonest behavior,"" his apology read. ""In addition, I deeply regret that I made my wife, children, and each ‘parent’ feel hurt.From now on, in order to fulfill my life as a responsible member of society, I will solely focus on tennis competitions and produce results. We will do our best to regain your trust.""Kei Nishikori's career has been a trailblazer for Japanese and Asian tennis. He was the first and only Japanese man to win a Grand Slam singles final of the Open Era and won an Olympic bronze medal at the 2016 Rio Olympics against Rafael Nadal. But now with this controversy, it is being marred off-court, a situation that has been rare in his previously low-profile private life.Also read: Roland Garros draw: Carlos Alcaraz starts against Kei Nishikori as Iga Swiatek gets tough draw Whether his fans and the tennis world will be ready to look to the future with him is yet to be seen, but one thing is certain: the next installment in the career of Kei Nishikori will be scrutinized more than ever.","Tennis star Kei Nishikori caught up in messy scandal after alleged years-long affair with model.

Magic Johnson praises Jeanie Buss and Mark Walter in heartfelt reaction to record-setting Lakers sale



The Los Angeles Lakers legend Magic Johnson could not hide his feelings after a bombshell report that the franchise was being sold. In a stunning move that has redefined sports business history, the Los Angeles Lakers— one of the NBA's most valuable franchises— has been sold for a record-breaking $10 billion. Jeanie Buss and her family agreed to sell their 66% majority stake to billionaire Mark Walter, CEO of TWG Global and Guggenheim Partners. The transaction, first reported by ESPN’s Shams Charania, makes it the largest sale of a professional sports franchise ever, surpassing the Boston Celtics' $6.1 billion mark earlier this year.Magic Johnson, the face of the Los Angeles Lakers' greatness and a longtime close friend of Jeanie Buss, had no hesitation in applauding her decision and the legacy she now leaves behind. Taking to X, Johnson poured out a series of personal and public reflections.“Job well done to my sister Jeanie Buss for striking an incredible deal and picking the right person to carry on the @Lakers legacy and tradition of winning - Mark Walter, my business partner and friend! Mark Walter is the best choice and will be the best caretaker of the Laker brand. The proof is in the pudding on what he’s been able to accomplish with the LA Dodgers.Mark has been nothing short of a winner notching 2 World Series and 11 NL West divisional titles in the last 12 years!” Johnson wrote.Mark Walter, already a minority stakeholder in the Lakers since 2021, also owns the Los Angeles Dodgers, the WNBA’s Sparks, and interests in Chelsea FC and a Formula 1 team. His entry into majority ownership, as confirmed to CNBC, is viewed not just as a business move but as a strategic continuation of LA's winning culture.“Laker fans should be ecstatic. A few things I can tell you about Mark – he is driven by winning, excellence, and doing everything the right way. AND he will put in the resources needed to win! I can understand why Jeanie sold the team to Mark Walter because they are just alike – they are competitive people, have big hearts, love to give back, and both prefer to be behind the scenes. This makes all the sense in the world. I am so so SO happy and excited for @Lakers fans all over the world!!” Johnson added.The sale marks the end of a 46-year legacy that began when Dr. Jerry Buss purchased the Lakers for $67.5 million in 1979. Under the Buss family's leadership, the franchise flourished, capturing 11 NBA championships and becoming a global brand. Jeanie Buss, who took over as governor in 2013 following her father’s passing, will retain her position and a minority share post-sale.“Just like I thought, when the Celtics sold for $6B, I knew the Lakers were worth $10B!” Johnson stated, referencing the Celtics’ March 2025 sale to private equity executive Bill Chisholm.Despite the mammoth valuation, the Lakers’ home—Crypto.com Arena—is not included in the deal, which makes the sheer franchise value even more staggering.“I know that my sister Jeanie would have only considered selling the Lakers organization to someone she knows and trusts would carry on the Buss legacy, started by her father Dr. Buss. Now she can comfortably pass the baton to Mark Walter, with whom she has a real friendship and can trust. She’s witnessed him build a winning team with the Dodgers and knows that Mark will do right by the Lakers team, organization, and fans! Both are extremely intelligent, visionaries, great leaders, and have positively impacted the greater Los Angeles community! I love both my sister @JeanieBuss and my business partner Mark Walter,” Johnson shared in another post.The sale, which still requires formal league approval, is expected to close within months. For Johnson, the emotion was palpable when he spoke directly to Jeanie.“I just talked to my sister Jeanie Buss to tell her congratulations, and that I’m so happy for her and family. I told her that her dad Dr. Buss would be very proud of her for getting $10B for the Lakers, the largest sports franchise sale in history!” he wrote.Also Read: Los Angeles Lakers $10 Billion Sale Shatters Sports Franchise Records; Buss Family Makes NBA History The Lakers, with 17 NBA championships and a global fanbase, are entering a new era. But with Jeanie Buss still seated at the executive table and Mark Walter's proven record of success, Johnson’s enthusiastic approval signals confidence that the purple and gold’s proud tradition is in steady hands. As for Johnson's reaction, it was valid as the huge deal could change the very scenario of the franchise that already has several big names including LeBron James, Luka Doncic and more.",Magic Johnson praises Jeanie Buss and Mark Walter in heartfelt reaction to record-setting Lakers sale.

WV Raman backs Shubman Gill to fire in England: 'He needs the right support'

Poll Do you believe Sunil Gavaskar's change in opinion about Pant is justified? Yes, he has improved No, he was right initially

Yashasvi Jaiswal credits Shubman Gill after maiden Test ton in England: 'I love it'

NEW DELHI: Sunil Gavaskar , once scathing in his criticism of Rishabh Pant , has now offered a more thoughtful appraisal of the explosive batter’s style after the opening day of India's domination in the first Test against England.During a segment on Sony Sports, Gavaskar heaped praise on Pant. Previously branding Pant’s shot in Australia as “Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!” on ABP Sport, Gavaskar has revisited his perspective.In his fresh remarks, Gavaskar said, “It seems like that’s how he plays. When he comes in to bat, on the second or third ball, he often uses his feet and hits a boundary. It makes him feel free and then allows him to play the way he wants.""Over here, he's been measured in his approach, giving himself time out in the middle. But once he's in and the bowlers start to tire, that's when he begins to step down the pitch and really attack, hitting big shots, sixes, and boundaries.”Such quick-fire aggression is now viewed less as recklessness and more as a calculated release.Gavaskar explained how Pant allows himself an initial period of restraint, adding, “Because he gives himself that time early on, it becomes easier for him to play those aggressive strokes later.When he defends, he seems to have so much time against the pace bowlers—it almost looks like he's taking the mickey out of them, saying, 'Look, I've got all the time in the world; I don't need to play a big shot, I'm just middling the ball. ' He’s got enormous talent. I’ve seen him score hundreds in South Africa and Australia, and they've been absolutely unbelievable. There’s such a great blend of defence and attack—starting with solid defence and then shifting to attack.""Gavaskar’s earlier harsh critique sprang from frustration over Pant’s dismissal for just 28 during the tour of Australia.“Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! He should not be going into that (India’s) dressing room - he should be going into the other dressing room!” he had said.With Pant’s approach now paying dividends and India opening their five-Test series in England with an imposing 359/3 at stumps on Day 1, his captain’s deputy Shubman Gill (127*) and Yashasvi Jaiswal (101) stole the headlines, while Pant held firm at 65 not out, even unleashing two late sixes to keep the momentum flowing.",Sunil Gavaskar has given a more thoughtful appraisal of Rishabh Pant's style.

Connor McDavid earned the Conn Smythe Trophy as the 2024 #stanleycup Playoffs #mvp #shorts

Offseason 2025: The Edmonton Oilers' next moves circling Connor McDavid

Connor McDavid: more than a player, the emotional core of the franchise

A very few athletes exist around the world of sports whose presence can uplift an entire franchise; Connor McDavid is undoubtedly one such athlete. Losing in the 2024 Stanley Cup Final was heartbreaking, but McDavid was still the shining star. Breaking all records in the postseason, McDavid became the first skater in over 20 years to win the Conn Smythe Trophy while on the losing team testament to his greatness and grassy impact on the game.In the 2024 postseason, the Edmonton Oilers had the best player; McDavid was simply an outstanding player with 42 points in 25 games, the highest among all. His help was instrumental for the Oilers to push deep into the Stanley Cup Final.Though the Oilers went down in Game 6 to the Florida Panthers, the Conn Smythe went to McDavid. He is only the sixth player in NHL history to have one without the Cup, last witnessed in 2003 with Jean-Sebastien Giguere. This award was further confirmation of McDavid’s standing as the modern icon of hockey.With the dust settling on the Stanley Cup, future interests very quickly came into play. Edmonton's management, led by GM Ken Holland, is already being pushed to put the team in the best shape for one more deep run.Defense is still a concern, and free agents may be out there to somehow shore up support for McDavid and Leon Draisaitl.McDavid is signed through 2026, but early contract talks have already begun among NL circles. Some have predicted it could break salary records, although McDavid himself has stayed in the spotlight with the focus on winning and not the money.This same offseason could decide Draisaitl's future, since here is the other star whose contract will expire in 2025. Both have expressed a wish to stay, but their commitment to the team may depend on whether the right players are brought in to support them.In between all the skills, speed, and records, Connor McDavid is the very spirit of Edmonton hockey. His ability to put things into perspective, even after a tremendous disappointment like a Stanley Cup loss, just speaks so much for his leadership. McDavid leads by example in every practice, every game, every loss- that building spirit for his teammates, inspiring the fans, and this world of hockey just cannot afford to lose sight of him.The class shown in his post-Final remarks last season was behind him; now it was time to grow and prepare for next season. After such mental processing is what takes him beyond an elite forward; it is what makes him a champion in the making.The 2024 playoff heroics of Connor McDavid, accompanied by the rare Conn Smythe Trophy win with no victory in sight, characterize a player at the height of his power and maturity. With a crucial offseason ahead of the Edmonton Oilers, one thing is crystal clear: as long as McDavid is an Oiler, a Stanley Cup will never be far from hope. His story is far from over-just entering its most exciting chapter.Also Read: How will the Edmonton Oilers retain Connor McDavid?

The Nail Incident that Actually Got Fans Talking

“Guys, the 'J' stands for Jawhn.”



Jawhn.

Social Media Flooded With Death Threats

“Sakura and I are fine. Please stop sending death threats and harassment, especially toward her.”



So… Are They Still a Thing?

If you were online anytime during June 2025, youcaught some chaos (and some cuteness) from Streamer Prom. When Jasontheween walked into Streamer Prom with Sakura on his arm, it felt like Twitch had its own red carpet power couple moment. But by the end of the night, fans were left dazed, confused, andin the chaos that unfolded. So, what actually happened between Jason and Sakura at Streamer Prom? Here's everything you need to know.Jason “Jasontheween” Nguyen, FaZe Clan’s rising star, needed a prom date. After multiple failed attempts on Pokimane, Cinna, and ExtraEmily, he pulled one last card — a customfor Sakura Shymko, Kyedae’s younger sister. Sakura, unimpressed but slightly charmed, reluctantly accepted. Here’s what she said:For a few hours, everything was picture-perfect. Jason’s stream hit a record-breaking 118k+ viewers. Sakura kissed him on the cheek. Kyedae gave a cheeky “marriage approved” shoutout. The internet. Fan edits, “Jakura” hashtags, and prom-themed memes were everywhere. But if you watched closely, there were cracks forming in real time and there was a clear awkwardness and confusion all the time.Around the fifth hour of the stream, Jason stepped away for a quick break, leaving Sakura outside with Jawhn, Jason’s cameraman. In what seemed like harmless banter, Sakura said something that would flip the whole vibe:Yes.Not Jason. Jason came back, got updated via chat, and his mood visibly plummeted. The camera caught him slouched over an arcade machine, face in sleeve, asking Sakura what happened.Things only got worse when Sakura brought up… the balloon incident. Apparently, a balloon had hit Jason’s head, and Sakura admitted it gave her the “ick.” As in, deal-breaker-level ick. That was the moment viewers realized that this wasn’t the love story they were promised.To make things even more uncomfortable, Sakura kept calling Jason “gang,” and Jason, trying to play it cool, responded with a soft “I’m good.” But viewers saw through it. The air was tense, the side-eyes were real, and the fairytale date started feeling more like a high school drama. For some viewers, it even started to become cringe.After the stream ended, drama bled onto social media. Hate, speculation, and death threats flooded in. Jason had to make a public post, asking fans to chill out and reminding everyone thatNo official update on “Jakura” just yet, but fans are still rooting for some kind of comeback — romantic or just civil. Either way, Streamer Prom 2025 gave us a wild ride, a viral moment, and a reminder that behind every stream is a real person, just trying to navigate feelings and fame in real time.","Jason “Jasontheween” Nguyen, FaZe Clan’s rising star, needed a prom date.

“Sh*t dawg… the people wanna see it?”

All eyes on Toronto as Marchand hits free agency radar



Brad Marchand has never needed many words to make an impact—on or off the ice. Now, just days before entering free agency, the veteran forward has stirred the NHL landscape with a single Instagram comment that’s fueling intense speculation about a potential move to the Toronto Maple Leafs. Coming off a stellar postseason with the Florida Panthers, Marchand has once again seized the spotlight—this time, with a message that has fans and analysts on edge.The buzz began when veteran NHL insider Nick Kypreos made a bold claim during his appearance on Leafs Morning Take: “I don’t know how [Marchand] doesn’t end up as a Maple Leaf.” Kypreos pointed to the financial leverage Toronto holds and Marchand’s underpaid eight-year, $49 million contract as key factors.Marchand’s reply came not in a press release, but in a striking comment on Instagram:For a player who has long been a central figure in heated rivalries particularly between Boston and Toronto just acknowledging the possibility of joining the Maple Leafs was enough to dominate headlines.The Maple Leafs are entering a pivotal offseason. With over $25 million in projected cap space and uncertainty surrounding stars like Mitch Marner and John Tavares, the franchise is actively seeking a cultural reset.General manager Brad Treliving has spoken openly about the need to alter the team’s ""DNA""—and Marchand fits the bill.Despite being 37, he remains a postseason powerhouse.

Connor McDavid rumored to join Tampa Bay Lightning after another Cup loss

Connor McDavid’s quiet finals and media pressure spark trade talks

An unexpected is making waves in the NHL world. A major rumor has surfaced, and it involves one of the biggest stars in hockey — Connor McDavid. After another painful Stanley Cup loss for the Edmonton Oilers, whispers are now pointing to a possible move. But it’s not just about leaving — it’s where he might go that has fans shocked.On June 20, 2025, during the latest episode of the Spittin’ Chiclets podcast, a surprising topic came up — could Connor McDavid leave the Edmonton Oilers and join the Tampa Bay Lightning? The podcast team discussed this rumor in a segment that was later shared on social media platform X by Game Notes.The talk started when host Mike Grinnell brought up whispers of McDavid heading south. Former player Matt Murley added, “There wasn’t much detail. It just said that it was a rumor.” But Murley also said it made sense. “He’s gotta be so sick of this media up in Canada… A team from Florida — what, they’ve won the Cup four of the last six years?”Another host, Colby Armstrong, also said he believed Tampa Bay had all the pieces to attract someone like McDavid. “They have the weapons to do it,” he said, while mentioning how tough Tampa was for Florida to beat in the first round of the playoffs.The idea of McDavid leaving a Canadian team to chase a championship in the U.S. is being compared to when NBA star LeBron James left Cleveland for the Miami Heat in 2010. Warm weather, less media pressure, and a winning team — that’s what Tampa offers.Connor McDavid had a tough time in the 2025 Stanley Cup Final.In Game 6, held on June 17 in Florida, he ended with no points and a -4 rating. Across the six-game series, the Oilers captain scored only one goal and had just seven points — a big drop for someone with his record.Also Read: Connor McDavid Rumors Explode As Leon Draisaitl Speaks On Uncertain Edmonton Oilers Future Canadian fans and media were expecting him to lead the team to victory. But the Florida Panthers shut him down and took the Cup again. After the loss, McDavid said during the postgame press conference, “We kept trying the same thing over and over again… just banging our heads against the wall.”Edmonton head coach Kris Knoblauch defended him, saying on June 18, “I think there’s been a lot of good scoring chances for him… I’ve got no issues with his game.” Still, fans wondered if McDavid had reached his limit in Edmonton — and if it’s time for a new chapter. In today’s shifting NHL landscape, McDavid’s rumored departure to Tampa Bay symbolizes more than a trade—it reflects a quest for legacy, relief from relentless scrutiny, and a renewed championship pursuit in a welcoming environment.","Connor McDavid had a tough time in the 2025 Stanley Cup Final.

“Connor’s the best player in the League, the most important player in the League, he’s our captain, he’s our leader, and certainly he’s a No. 1 priority,”

“He’s earned the right for us to be respectful of his time.”

Connor McDavid’s contract situation is the hottest topic in Edmonton and the Oilers aren’t leaving any room for doubt: re-signing their superstar captain is the franchise’s top priority. With McDavid entering the final season of his eight-year, $100 million deal, the Oilers are gearing up to do whatever it takes to keep the face of the franchise in Edmonton long-term.There’s no understating the impact Connor McDavid has had on the Edmonton Oilers—and the NHL as a whole. As he enters the final year of his eight-year, $100 million contract, general manager Stan Bowman wasted no time addressing the elephant in the room.Bowman said.McDavid, 28, will be eligible to sign an extension on July 1. If he doesn’t, he’ll become an unrestricted free agent in 2026—a scenario that would send shockwaves through the hockey world. But the Oilers aren’t panicking.Instead, they’re focused on building a winning culture that aligns with what McDavid values most: a Stanley Cup.The three-time Hart Trophy winner and five-time Art Ross Trophy recipient delivered another phenomenal season, putting up 100 points in 67 games and leading all players with 33 points in the 2025 Stanley Cup Playoffs. Yet again, he proved he’s not just elite—he’s in a class of his own.Despite back-to-back Stanley Cup Final losses to the Florida Panthers, McDavid hasn’t lost focus. According to Bowman, winning—not money or accolades—is his driving force.The Oilers already extended Leon Draisaitl on an eight-year, $112 million deal, and McDavid’s next contract is expected to become the richest in NHL history. But for Edmonton, this goes beyond numbers. It’s about legacy, loyalty, and finally bringing the Stanley Cup back to Oil Country.Also Read: Brad Marchand ignites Maple Leafs buzz with cryptic “Sh*t dawg” comment ahead of NHL free agency With key roster decisions ahead—including re-signing Trent Frederic and Evan Bouchard—Bowman’s offseason mission is to keep the core intact and give McDavid every reason to stay.","Edmonton Oilers GM Stan Bowman calls Connor McDavid the team’s top priority.

Lobo Predicted It, Again: South Africa’s Historic WTC Win vs Australia

NEW DELHI: A chaotic moment of fielding madness overshadowed a high-pressure Eliminator in Maharashtra's premier T20 league as Vicky Ostwal capitalised on a comical lapse by Kolhapur Tuskers to turn the tide for Raigad Royals at the MCA Stadium in Pune.Chasing a tricky total of 160, Ostwal found himself at the centre of a bizarre sequence during the middle overs.Having punched a back-foot shot off Atman Pore through the cover region, he and his batting partner looked to push for a second run. But disaster struck mid-pitch, with both batters colliding and falling flat, giving Kolhapur a golden opportunity to run Ostwal out.What followed, however, left fans and commentators stunned.The throw came in from the deep straight to the keeper, who astonishingly decided to send it back to the bowler instead of completing the run-out himself, despite Ostwal being well short of his crease.Watch:Pore, caught off-guard, fumbled the return. Realising a window still existed, a Kolhapur fielder grabbed the ball and sprinted toward the striker’s end.Sensing danger again, Ostwal made a dash for safety.The shy at the stumps missed, and with no one backing up, Ostwal regained his ground unscathed.The Royals’ dugout erupted in laughter and relief, while Kolhapur Tuskers looked on in disbelief.Fans, in disbelief, started commenting on the incident.

Calgary Flames’ trade history under fire again



Brad Marchand celebrates the Florida Panthers teammates and takes shots



Flames left to reflect while Brad Marchand enjoys the last laugh



After winning his second Stanley Cup, Brad Marchand made sure to use the moment not just to celebrate, but to send a not-so-subtle reminder to teams that once doubted the Florida Panthers roster. One of his sharpest jabs came at the Calgary Flames, who once traded away both Sam Bennett and Matthew Tkachuk, now vital parts of Florida’s championship core.It has been a difficult stretch for the Flames. Missing the playoffs for three straight seasons while watching Tkachuk and Bennett dominate the postseason makes the trades sting even more. The Matthew Tkachuk deal, though initially considered a strong return, hasn’t aged well. Calgary received Jonathan Huberdeau and Mackenzie Weegar, but Huberdeau’s struggles in Calgary have been well-documented.The 37-year-old Marchand, acquired by Florida from Boston earlier in the year, has leaned fully into his new role as both on-ice leader and off-ice agitator. At the celebratory dinner that quickly turned into a nightclub-style party, Marchand publicly thanked teams like Calgary for “giving up on” key players like Bennett and Tkachuk.Brad Marchand has never been one to shy away from controversy. Now, as a Cup winner again, he’s embracing the spotlight with the same energy he brought on the ice. For the Calgary Flames, his post felt like salt in a still-fresh wound. While there is some long-term upside to the trades they made, the optics are hard to ignore.Read more: Connor McDavid’s wife, Lauren Kyle, sharesa heartfelt message with the Edmonton Oilers fans after the Stanley Cup loss As Marchand danced and toasted his teammates, he left Calgary fans, and former GM Brad Treliving with a tough pill to swallow.

With all the heat from the cup bid, contract discussions gain momentum)

Contract projections soar for McDavid amid rising cap and playoff frustration, with much speculation

For the last few weeks, Connor McDavid has been at the center of NHL headlines, either for elite on-ice performance or for the uncertainty of his next contract. As the Edmonton Oilers try to pick themselves up once again after a Stanley Cup failure, the attention turns sharply toward the franchise's greatest asset. With just a year left on his current contract, McDavid's future will soon be moving from wild speculation to serious negotiations, with nothing being higher-staked on the long-term aspirations of Edmonton.The Oilers have enjoyed the brilliance of McDavid for nearly a decade, with the question now being for how much longer they can keep their generational star before his current contract of eight years and $100 million comes to an end, a contract signed in 2017, and discussions have begun to get serious concerning the next. He has never gone after the highest dollar; however, things on the financial front change faster each day. NHL's upcoming $95.5 million salary cap jump lends every forecast an added dimension.The insiders have said that he can get paid more than he is getting. Even though his highest salary would probably be estimated at around $19 million per season, McDavid's track record points to him accepting a little less money for the sake of providing some flexibility to his team.Draisaitl, his teammate, is locked at $14 million per annum, making it an inescapable precedent for management to steer through.The problems of the Oilers are not only about contracts. McDavid dazzled again in the 2024-25 campaign, hitting 100 points for a second consecutive time but having to settle for a pitiable showing under unfamiliar circumstances. Again, dueling with Draisaitl for production in the postseason, in the Finals, the goal tallies evaded McDavid, with the Floridians' defense stifling the top weapons of Edmonton, and the Oilers lacked a little more punch in the secondary to make a difference.What this postseason displayed was the dependence of Edmonton on its two superstars. The core should have been talented but expensive, including names like Zach Hyman, Ryan Nugent-Hopkins, and Darnell Nurse. Should McDavid's next deal command a higher share of the cap, the front office will be forced to get creative in putting a championship-caliber team around him.Also Read: Connor McDavid and Draisaitl Leon injury update: Oilers face major setback as the star players have been sidelined for a week Connor McDavid's next contract is going to be a defining moment for himself and the Edmonton Oilers. While the extortionate numbers will make all those ridiculous headlines, the real test will be whether those dollars really could now go on to deliver McDavid a Stanley Cup. So while it's legacy for McDavid on the line, for Edmonton, it's running out of time to put together a team that can finally bring it home.","Connor McDavid has been at the center of NHL headlines, either for elite on-ice performance or for the uncertainty of his next contract.

Poll Will Yashasvi Jaiswal's style of play change as he gains more experience in Test cricket? Yes, he will become more conservative No, he will maintain his aggressive style

NEW DELHI: In the IPL and T20Is, Yashasvi Jaiswal has built his reputation by playing 360-degree shots. But in Test cricket, he plays in stark contrast to his aggressive nature — biding his time, and striking only when the opportunity arises.On Friday, the 23-year-old scored an exquisite hundred in the first innings of the Leeds Test. It was an innings of two halves: his first 50 came off 96 balls, while his second came in just 48. It marked his fifth Test ton and third against England. He joined the elite list of Vijay Manjrekar, Sourav Ganguly, Sandeep Patil, and Murali Vijay by scoring a century in his first outing in England. Jaiswal was dismissed for 101 on Day 1 of the first Test of the five-match series against England in Leeds.In Jaiswal’s case, cricket greats have often cited his “inherent hunger” and “desperation to succeed” — attributes rooted to his humble beginnings.Jaiswal’s story is indeed inspiring. But Jos Buttler , his former Rajasthan Royals teammate, credits the youngster’s fearless approach for his excellence in both T20s and Test cricket.""It's probably the mindset — the sort of attitude to risk is a lot — and he is very willing to take what may seem on the outside like a risk, but I don't think players now see it as a risk.He plays a lot of different shots from ball one,"" Buttler told TimesofIndia.com in an interaction during IPL 2025.Buttler, who has observed Jaiswal’s growth up close at the Rajasthan Royals, explained what makes the opener so special.""He has got excellent fundamental basics of the game as well. And I think that will never really change over time,"" he shared.""We certainly do play in a time now where there are players who are more focused on being hitters of the cricket ball and sort of setting up their techniques for that.""But, you know, the basics sort of remain the same — being in a good solid base, having a good head position, everything working well together. I think the basics will always take care of where to start, and then you develop the rest of your game after that. So I think it's important, in and around your practice, to make sure you have a bit of that.""And I think that's what he does. Guys like Jaiswal are very successful in Test cricket as well as T20 cricket because their game is so strong,"" he added.Buttler, the former England white-ball captain, had also posted a heartfelt message when Jaiswal took England to the cleaners during the home series in early 2024 — explaining why he enjoys Jaiswal’s batting, even if it comes against his own country.""Shame he's doing it against England but v(very) hard not to be so happy for @yashasvijaiswal28. Getting everything he deserves from his talent, hunger and work ethic. WHAT A STAR!"" Buttler had written in his Instagram story.Joe Root, who spent a season with Jaiswal at the Royals during IPL 2023, had also showered praise on the southpaw.“His ability to strike cleanly and blast the ball to all parts from ball one is impressive. But to be able to transfer skills to the Test format [means] he has got a very sound technique,” Root had said of Jaiswal.In the home series against England, Jaiswal had scored 712 runs in 2024. He then finished as India's leading run-getter in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, finishing with 391 runs, including a 161 in Perth and a couple of fifties in Melbourne. Now, on his first tour of England, he has opened his account with a century.","Yashasvi Jaiswal scored an exquisite hundred in the first innings of the Leeds Test.

Poll Who impressed you the most in India's batting lineup during Day 1? Rishabh Pant Shubman Gill Yashasvi Jaiswal

A s the third session on Day 1 between India and England marches on, India’s middle order looked in assured hands with the combined efforts of Rishabh Pant and captain Shubman Gill.Jaiswal, who has rapidly become England’s new Test nemesis, notched up a sparkling 101 off 159 balls — his fifth Test ton and third against the English — to lay a solid platform for India. His dismissal, however, came at a crucial time: England captain Ben Stokes produced a timely breakthrough, trapping the left-hander and celebrating a much-needed scalp after plenty of work under the Leeds sun.In walked Pant at No. 5, and he wasted no time announcing his arrival. Facing Stokes for his second ball, Pant drilled a full delivery straight back past the England skipper for a scorching boundary. The shot drew an instant laugh from Stokes, who couldn’t help but find laugh at Pant’s aggressive greeting. Pant, however, appeared to show little to no reaction.Since then, Pant has kept the energy high in the middle, regularly chatting with Gill between overs. In one such stump mic moment, Pant was heard telling Gill,Gilly, ball ban gaya hai. Banaya hai inhone abhi…- a remark hinting that England’s bowlers have now got the ball to reverse swing, adding an extra layer of challenge on a pitch that still has good pace and carry.Gill, who earlier stitched a crucial stand with Jaiswal, looked equally composed as he guided India’s innings alongside Pant. Together, the pair will aim to capitalise on the foundation built by Jaiswal’s ton and keep India firmly in charge as the visitors look to start their new era in Test cricket with a statement performance in foreign soil.With Pant in the mood and Gill anchoring calmly, India’s intent to control Day 1 remains clear.","Yashasvi Jaiswal notched up a sparkling 101 off 159 balls to lay a solid platform for India.

Jon Jones exits UFC with emotional farewell as new legal storm brews in the background



Jon Jones, one of the most dominant and controversial figures in mixed martial arts history, has officially announced his retirement from the UFC. The decision comes just hours after UFC CEO Dana White confirmed the news publicly, signaling the end of an era. While fans and fighters alike took to social media to reflect on the legacy of “Bones,” the retirement news was almost immediately followed by reports of yet another legal issue tied to the former champion, casting a shadow over what should have been a celebratory farewell.In a lengthy and reflective statement shared on X, Jon Jones wrote, “Today, I’m officially announcing my retirement from the UFC. This decision comes after a lot of reflection, and I want to take a moment to express my deepest gratitude for the journey I’ve experienced over the years.” The message was packed with appreciation for those who supported him, from family and teammates to UFC leadership and fans worldwide.He recounted a career filled with historic highs and personal lows, “From the first time I stepped into the Octagon, my goal was to push the boundaries of what was possible in this sport. Becoming the youngest UFC champion in history... these are memories I’ll cherish forever.”Jones continued, “I want to thank the UFC, Dana, Hunter, Lorenzo, God, my family, coaches, teammates, and all the fans who have stood by me through every chapter.”He closed his post with an optimistic outlook, sharing, “As I close this chapter of my life, I look forward to new opportunities and challenges ahead… The best is yet to come.”In a follow-up post, the 37-year-old added, “I’m completely overwhelmed right now, I love you guys so much. Thank you.”While Jones’ words struck a sincere emotional chord with many, news soon broke via the Albuquerque Journal that he had been issued a criminal summons for allegedly fleeing the scene of an accident back in February. According to reports, a woman, who appeared intoxicated and partially unclothed, claimed Jones was the driver and had fled the crash site on foot.

Washington Freedom held their nerve to clinch a thrilling two-wicket win over MI New York in a high-scoring contest. Chasing 189, Freedom were always ahead of the required rate but kept losing wickets at regular intervals, which kept MI New York in the hunt till the end.The chase was laid on a solid platform by opener Mitchell Owen, who came out all guns blazing. Owen smashed a blistering 60 off just 26 balls, hammering five fours and five sixes to put his side in command early on. After his departure, Rachin Ravindra (10) and Andries Gous (14) chipped in with quick runs, but Freedom’s middle order struggled to build partnerships.Mark Chapman’s composed knock of 45 not out off 32 balls proved decisive in the end. Despite losing partners at the other end with Maxwell (16) and Jack Edwards (30) falling cheaply — Chapman kept his cool and guided Freedom home with four balls to spare.Earlier, MI New York posted a competitive 188 for 4. Michael Bracewell top-scored with an unbeaten 42 off 24 balls, while Quinton de Kock cracked a quickfire 55 off 34.

Victor Wembanyama quietly records advice from NBA greats like LeBron and Kevin Durant in a notebook



The San Antonio Spurs' centerpiece for the future, the 21-year-old French phenom Victor Wembanyama, has turned heads for how he approaches greatness. What’s not often seen is his personal notebook, where he stores advice from NBA legends. The Spuers superstar recently shared that he is willing to note wisdom from active NBA legends, including Kevin Durant and LeBron James During a live taping of The Shop: Uninterrupted at Fanatics Fest in New York, Victor Wembanyama peeled back the curtain on a unique part of his process. “I have a note on my phone with questions to ask the guys, KD [Kevin Durant], 'Bron [LeBron James],” he shared, sitting alongside LeBron James and NFL icon Tom Brady. “I had the chance to talk to [Nikola] Jokić for 45 minutes at All-Star [weekend]. And I’m taking notes.” That moment gave fans a glimpse into how seriously the Spurs star studies the game and its greatest minds.Wembanyama’s hunger to learn doesn't end with casual conversation. “When I’m told something, I don’t forget it. It’s super precious, for sure,” he added. That philosophy, combined with his freakish 7-foot-3 frame and raw talent, is what makes his ceiling so terrifyingly high.Before a blood clot in his right shoulder ended his season prematurely, Wembanyama was averaging 24.3 points, 11.0 rebounds, 3.7 assists, and a league-leading 3.8 blocks per game.The setback raised concerns, but the support from peers like Durant has been heartfelt. “I’m glad they caught this early,” Durant said after a Spurs win over his Suns. “That can affect your overall health… I’m thinking about Vic… he’s gonna put his best foot forward every day. ”That mutual respect isn’t one-sided. On Kevin Hart’s Cold as Balls podcast, when asked if he’s a big Durant fan, Wembanyama didn’t hesitate: “That’s right.” He later doubled down in an interview with M6 Info after the Paris Olympics, calling Durant his “favorite childhood player.” Laughing, he added, “I made it clear that I wanted to learn from him, perhaps only steal one or two of his secret techniques.”Also Read: Dwyane Wade’s wife Gabrielle Union keeps their love alive with touching tributes and romantic gestures amid vacation in France If trade rumors surrounding Durant pan out, and the Spurs do become a landing spot, the student might soon train daily with the teacher.

NEW DELHI: Team India's vice-captain Rishabh Pant lit up Day 2 of the Headingley Test not just with his bat, but also with his words.In a now-viral video, Pant was caught on the stump mic saying, “Suja diya yaar maar maar ke, ek hi jagah maare ja raha hai” — roughly translating to, “He’s made me swollen, man, just by hitting the same spot again and again!”The comment, directed at partner Ravindra Jadeja , came right after an aggressive phase of his innings.Watch:Ironically, Pant was dismissed on the very next ball, pinned lbw by Josh Tongue after shouldering arms to a delivery that nipped back sharply.Despite the dismissal, Pant’s 134 (off 178 balls) was a masterclass in controlled aggression, featuring fearless strokeplay and tactical brilliance.Cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar later praised Pant’s unusual “falling paddle sweep”, calling it “intentional and extremely clever”.According to the legendary batter, the shot allowed Pant to scoop the ball with precision over leg slip, especially effective against Bashir.Tendulkar also pointed out the strategic mid-over conversations in Hindi between Shubman Gill and Pant, suggesting they were designed to disrupt the young spinner’s rhythm.Gill and Pant’s 209-run stand was the cornerstone of India’s imposing 471-run total, following Yashasvi Jaiswal’s fluent 101. Gill’s composed 147 and Pant’s flamboyant ton put England’s attack under severe pressure -- until both fell within quick succession, triggering a collapse.While India lost their last seven wickets for just 41 runs, Jasprit Bumrah ensured they stayed in command with a three-wicket burst, including the vital scalp of Joe Root. But Ollie Pope ’s gritty unbeaten 100 kept England in the game at 209/3.","India's vice-captain Rishabh Pant lit up Day 2 of the Headingley Test.
