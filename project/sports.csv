What Singapore cops uncovered

NEW DELHI: Zubeen Garg was “severely intoxicated” and drowned off Lazarus Island after declining a life jacket, a Singapore court was told on Wednesday. The Singapore police reiterated that it does not suspect any foul play in the death.""At the time, he was also severely intoxicated and several witnesses saw him trying to swim back to the yacht when he went limp and began floating with his face in the water,"" Channel News Asia reported citing the investigating officer.The court was further told that Garg had a history of hypertension and epilepsy, with his most recent recorded epileptic episode occurring in 2024. However, it remained uncertain whether he had taken his prescribed epilepsy medication on the day of the incident, as eyewitness accounts are insufficient to confirm that he had done so.Police told the court that their investigation revealed Garg and around 20 others on board the yacht, including friends and colleagues, had consumed snacks, drinks and alcohol during the outing. Multiple witnesses stated that Garg was seen drinking alcohol, with one account claiming he consumed several cups of liquor, including gin and whisky.According to the chief investigating officer’s reconstruction of events, Garg later went for a swim during which he removed his life jacket.He subsequently returned to the yacht and was heard telling others that he was feeling tired, the officer informed the court.“When he decided to resume swimming, Garg was offered a second, smaller life jacket, but he declined to wear it. He entered the water without a life jacket and started swimming in the direction of Lazarus Island alone,” the Channel cited chief investigating officer saying.The officer told the court that post-mortem examination confirmed drowning as the cause of Garg’s death, and while some injuries were found on the body, they were determined to have occurred during CPR and rescue attempts. The officer added that medical tests detected Garg’s prescribed medication for hypertension and epilepsy in his blood, with no traces of any other drugs.Moreover, they said that a toxicology report showed Garg had a blood alcohol concentration of 333 milligrams per 100 ml of blood, indicating severe intoxication that would have significantly impaired coordination and reflexes.“The evidence of several witnesses, provided via their statements to the court, stated that Mr Garg had no suicidal tendencies and that he was not pushed into the water but had jumped in himself for a swim,” the news website report said, quoting the court hearing.However, as per the probe conducted by the SIT and the Assam Police’s CID, those named as accused include the principal event organiser Shyamkanu Mahanta, Zubeen Garg’s manager Siddharth Sharma, suspended APS officer Sandipan Garg, and two personal security officers, Nandeswar Bora and Paresh Baishya.The CJI court in Guwahati remanded five accused — Shyamkanu Mahanta, Siddharth Sharma, Sandipan Garg, Nandeswar Bora, and Paresh Baishya — to judicial custody in connection with the Garg death case.Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma assured justice saying: ""Another step forward towards justice for our beloved Zubeen. The Singapore Police authorities will meet the Assam Police team led by Sri Munna Gupta, ADGP and Head of SIT, on 21st October. Our collective resolve remains, Justice for Zubeen will prevail.""Garg died in Singapore on September 19, reportedly after an incident while swimming, just a day before he was slated to perform at the Northeast India Festival.","Zubeen Garg died in Singapore on September 19, reportedly after an incident while swimming.

‘40 years of warnings’: Indian envoy to Canada calls out decades of inaction on terrorism - watch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/40-years-of-warnings-indian-envoy-to-canada-calls-out-decades-of-inaction-on-terrorism-watch/articleshow/126528057.cms,"'Failed For 40 Years': Indian High Commissioner Slams Canada Over Terrorism Inaction

NEW DELHI: India's high commissioner to Canada Dinesh Patnaik strongly pushed back against allegations linking the Indian government to the killing of NIA-designated terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, sharply questioning the absence of evidence during a televised interview.Responding to a question during CBC News' ""Power & Politics"" on allegations primarily made by former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that India had interfered in the country's internal affairs by killing Nijjar, Patnaik repeatedly demanded ""evidence"", saying accusations cannot stand without evidence.""Well, where is the evidence? Every time you keep on saying 'credible information',"" the Indian envoy said, rejecting the allegations as unsubstantiated.""We have always said it's preposterous and absurd; it's something we don't do. These are allegations which have not been backed by evidence. There's always easy-to-do accusations. Accusations are easy,"" Patnaik added.Patnaik emphasised that the ongoing legal case in Canada does not implicate the Indian state, adding that the accusations stemmed from statements made by a former Canadian prime minister and his team.""You have accused us, but where have we been implicated? The case is going on in court... And the case in court is also against four individuals. Where is the case against a state? It's a talk given by a former prime minister backed by his team at that time, which he had; they had to back it. Where is the evidence on the ground?"" he asked.""We can go into who said what. At the end of the day, it's about evidence on the ground,"" Patnaik said, reiterating India's long-standing position that it is willing to act if credible proof is presented.In a pointed remark aimed at the framing of the allegations, the Indian envoy said, ""When you accuse us, what happens here is my accusations need evidence. Your accusations don't need evidence, right?""He further added, ""You have accusations; you have to back it up with evidence. You can't say I accuse you, and you have to now justify yourselves.""The remarks come in the context of the strained ties between the two sides in recent years, primarily due to concerns over Canada's perceived leniency towards Khalistani separatist elements and Canada's allegations that Indian agents were involved in the killing of NIA-designated terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar outside a gurdwara in Canada in 2023.India had strongly rejected the allegations and termed them ""politically motivated"".",India's high commissioner to Canada Dinesh Patnaik strongly pushed back against allegations linking the Indian government to the killing of NIA-designated terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar.

Hyderabad: NCB seizes 813 kilograms of ganja and arrests three in crackdown,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hyderabad-ncb-seizes-813-kilograms-of-ganja-and-arrests-three-in-crackdown/articleshow/126530805.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a significant crackdown on interstate cannabis trafficking, officers of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), Hyderabad Zone, seized 813 kilograms of ganja and arrested 3 individuals in the early hours of January 13, 2026.Acting on precise intelligence, 2 NCB teams launched a coordinated operation to intercept a suspicious vehicle moving through the outskirts of Hyderabad.The vehicle, a specially modified lorry, reportedly transported the contraband from Malkangiri district in Odisha towards Latur, Maharashtra. The contraband was to be distributed in Delhi, Mumbai, and other places, sources said.Upon intercepting the vehicle, officers conducted a thorough search under the provisions of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985. Investigators discovered that the lorry operated with an expired Registration Certificate and was extensively altered to facilitate smuggling.The team uncovered a large, hidden cylindrical cavity designed to resemble a storage tank. To further evade detection, the traffickers camouflaged the compartment with grass and a tarpaulin sheet. Inside this concealed space, officers recovered the bulk shipment of ganja.The 3 arrested suspects were identified as residents of Bidar district. Preliminary investigations revealed that 1 of the accused was a habitual offender with a prior criminal record involving narcotics. He was previously implicated in 2 separate drug-related cases in Karnataka and Maharashtra.The NCB is currently conducting an expansive investigation to dismantle the broader trafficking syndicate, focusing on identifying the source of the drugs, the intended destination network, and the financial trails associated with the operation. Further legal proceedings and investigations into forward and backward linkages are ongoing, officials said.","Officers of the Narcotics Control Bureau seized 813 kilograms of ganja and arrested 3 individuals.

New York Mets likely expanded their offer to four years as Steve Cohen became directly involved in Kyle Tucker negotiations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/new-york-mets-likely-expanded-their-offer-to-four-years-as-steve-cohen-became-directly-involved-in-kyle-tucker-negotiations/articleshow/126536471.cms,"(Image Source - Getty Images)

New York Mets put $50 million per year on the table as Kyle Tucker

New York Mets outfield plans remained thin with Juan Soto

Toronto Blue Jays position a longer contract that lowers Kyle Tucker’s annual value

Kyle Tucker's free agency is at a pivotal stage, and the New York Mets are making it obvious they don't want to fall behind. Initially, it was a quick, high-value proposal, but now it's shifted in a significant way, suggesting that the Mets feel a decision could be on the horizon.Sources close to the situation indicate that the offer's structure has been modified to enhance New York's standing, both financially and strategically. Additionally, ownership has sent a clear message that this pursuit is significant, particularly considering the Mets' current outfield needs. With other teams offering contrasting contract proposals, Tucker now has to make a decision that involves more than just money. The upcoming move could decide if the Mets successfully acquire their target or see him sign with another team.The New York Mets have made a short-term offer to Tucker, valued at an average of $50 million per year. This was confirmed by MLB Network insider Jon Heyman and others. According to Will Sammon from The Athletic, the Mets have conducted several video meetings with Tucker over the last week and proposed a three-year contract worth between $120 million and $140 million.Jim Duquette, who used to be the Mets General Manager and is now an analyst for SNY, mentioned on MLB Network Radio that the Mets have probably added a fourth year to their earlier reported three-year, $150 million agreement with Kyle Tucker.Duquette pointed out that the deal would probably include at least one opt-out. This matches earlier speculation since the Mets preferred to offer a shorter contract, possibly under four years, but it seems they have now changed their approach.The Mets are anticipating a response from Kyle Tucker ""in the near future"" as the free agent weighs his options. This implies that the discussions are progressing, with the fourth-year addition likely trying to enhance the competitiveness of the offer.Mets owner Steve Cohen getting involved shows how serious they are about this chase. Jim Duquette mentioned that Cohen is part of the talks, highlighting the team's dedication to landing Tucker.This comes as the Mets are working on their offseason game plan, having already made some big moves but still needing to strengthen their outfield after sending Brandon Nimmo to the Rangers.Right now, Juan Soto is the only outfielder secured, with Tyrone Taylor and Carson Benge being the leading options for center and left field. Bringing Tucker on board would instantly change the lineup.Cohen's position also aligns with the larger story of the Mets' bold spending since he took over. If Tucker agrees to a $50 million per season contract, Cohen would be on the hook for $101 million just for Tucker and another high-priced player like Soto in 2026.The Mets aren't the only team after Tucker. According to ESPN, the Mets have put a $50 million per season short-term deal on the table for him, but he's also considering offers from the Toronto Blue Jays. The Blue Jays' proposal is said to be a long-term deal that pays Tucker less annually compared to New York's offer. While the Mets are leaning towards a shorter contract, the Blue Jays are likely to present a longer one.The Los Angeles Dodgers are definitely in the conversation. They’re still hanging around and can put together a huge short-term contract, but we haven’t seen any exact figures yet. Former MLB executive Jim Duquette mentioned earlier that the Mets, Dodgers, and Blue Jays are the top contenders, with Tucker having met with all three teams, either face-to-face or via Zoom, during the recruitment process.The New York Yankees are currently ""on the outskirts"" of the Tucker situation. This interest comes up as talks with Cody Bellinger have hit a standstill, leading the Yankees to look into other options like Tucker and Bo Bichette.Also Read: MLB trade rumour: Ryan Weathers trade gives New York Yankees immediate pitching help while Gerrit Cole and Carlos Rodón recover","The New York Mets have made a short-term offer to Kyle Tucker, valued at an average of $50 million per year.

The Red Sox's efforts to retain Alex Bregman

After signing with the Cubs, Bregman took to Instagram to post a photo along with a touching message expressing his gratitude to the Red Sox organization and the city of Boston. ""It was an honor to play for a city that shares the same passion and love for the game as I do,"" Bregman wrote. ""You welcomed my family with open arms and we will always be grateful for the support you gave us."" This goodbye followed Bregman's one-season stint with the Red Sox, where he had established himself as an important veteran figure in the clubhouse.Bregman signed a five-year contract worth $175 million with the Chicago Cubs on January 10, 2026, according to ESPN's Jeff Passan. This deal has an average annual value of $35 million and comes with a complete no-trade clause, without any opt-out options.It includes $70 million in deferrals, bringing the current value down to around $150 million to $155 million, as per sources familiar with the details.The Cubs made the contract announcement on January 14, 2026. This deal ranks as the third-largest in Cubs history by total value, following Jason Heyward's eight-year, $184 million contract from 2015 and Dansby Swanson's seven-year, $177 million agreement from 2022.Bregman, a 31-year-old guy from Albuquerque, New Mexico, kicked off his MLB career with the Houston Astros, playing there for nine seasons from 2016 to 2024. During his time with the Astros, he snagged World Series titles in 2017 and 2022.After wrapping up the 2024 season, he inked a three-year, $120 million deal with the Boston Red Sox, which had opt-out options after the 2025 and 2026 seasons. Bregman decided to opt-out after the 2025 season, jumping into free agency even though he could have made more money annually by sticking with Boston. Ultimately, he went with the Cubs' offer for better long-term stability.In 2025, Bregman took the field for 114 games with the Red Sox, boasting a batting average of .273 along with 18 home runs and 62 RBIs. That year, he made his third All-Star appearance, but he did miss some games due to a quad injury.He was placed on the 10-day injured list starting May 24, 2025, and was activated again on July 11, 2025. His performance included an .822 OPS and strong defensive skills at third base.The Red Sox extended a five-year, $165 million proposal to Bregman, featuring significant deferrals but lacking a no-trade clause, consistent with the team's policy.As reported by ESPN's Buster Olney, the Red Sox thought this offer would guarantee his return, and the organization felt genuine disappointment when he opted for the Cubs. In an email interview with MassLive, Red Sox chief baseball officer Craig Breslow mentioned that, ""Any time you are active in trying to bring a player in, it's disappointing to lose out.""With Bregman joining the team, the Cubs are looking to capitalize on their success from 2025. As a three-time All-Star and a proven winner, he adds offensive strength and leadership to a squad that has high hopes for the 2026 season.Also Read: New York Mets likely expanded their offer to four years as Steve Cohen became directly involved in Kyle Tucker negotiations","Alex Bregman signed a five-year contract worth $175 million with the Chicago Cubs on January 10, 2026.

A'ja Wilson and Angel Reese join Stephen Curry's animated film GOAT

Impact on women's sports and media representation



When the lights go up in theaters on February 13, 2026, the silver screen will showcase a level of star power that fans of both the NBA and WNBA have been dreaming of. Stephen Curry’s highly anticipated animated feature, GOAT, has officially added two of the biggest names in women's basketball to its cast: Angel Reese and A’ja Wilson. Joining a lineup that already features Hollywood heavyweights like Gabrielle Union and David Harbour, the addition of these hoopers marks a massive cultural bridge between professional basketball and mainstream entertainment.Produced by a living legend, Stephen Curry, the film centers on an underdog story. A little goat, Will, dreams of playing roarball, a high-intensity sport, but his physical limitations obstruct him. It will follow his journey from being looked down upon to overcoming all barriers and rewriting the rules. Sounds familiar? Do you feel Curry’s story could be reflected through Will?For any dedicated WNBA watcher, the pairing of Reese and Wilson is a game recognize game moment. Both Wilson and Reese are coming off a historic 2025 season where one former won her 4th WNBA MVP award, 2nd Finals MVP, 3rd DPOY, and led the Aces to their 3rd championships in the last 4 years. These accolades don’t finish just here. Wilson is an elite offensive and defensive powerhouse. She also led the 2025 season as the highest point scorer with 2025. Now set to play a reptile named Kouyate, in Curry’s GOAT money, the fans can’t wait to see how the MVP plays out her role on the big screen.Angel Reese, on the other hand, has been writing, redefining what WNBA stardom is. She set the league record in rebounds with 12.6 in 2025, and is leveraging her online presence to slowly build her own brand empire. Barely two years into her career, and she’s already headlining games and fashion shows. In the movie, fans will see her voicing a polar bear named Propp.The genius of this casting lies in its authenticity. By having actual champions and record-breakers voice these characters, Curry’s Unanimous Media is leaning into the specific it factor that has driven WNBA viewership to record highs over the last year. Both Wilson and Reese made an impact on women’s sports beyond the hardwood.The release of GOAT represents a pivotal shift in how women's sports stars are marketed to the next generation. Traditionally, WNBA players were relegated to the sidelines of sports media, but this film places them at the center of a major Sony Pictures Animation production alongside the greatest shooter in NBA history.This visibility is a power move for the WNBA's brand. By appearing in a family-friendly animated film, Reese and Wilson are being introduced to Gen Alpha and younger fans who may not yet be regular league pass subscribers. It’s a flywheel effect: movie stardom breeds cultural relevance, which in turn drives jersey sales and ticket stubs. As the WNBA prepares for further expansion into markets like Portland and Toronto in 2026, having its biggest stars become household names through cinema is the ultimate fast-break toward long-term growth.Also read: The top 5 most expensive contracts in WNBA right now: Kelsey Mitchell, Jackie Young, and more","A'ja Wilson and Angel Reese join Stephen Curry's animated film GOAT.

Why are teams still monitoring a potential Dougie Hamilton trade?



CHAOS: Why Are Devils ABANDONING Dougie Hamilton—Is San Jose Next in SHOCK TRADE?

Once again, the New Jersey Devils are involved in trade rumors, and Dougie Hamilton’s name is one of the most mentioned in this regard, as teams are still looking for opportunities to upgrade their defense through the back line. Moving their star defenseman has become a subject of debate among both fans and insiders, but the initial signs point out that more of a watch-and-wait situation rather than a deal about to be done is at stake here.TSN’s Pierre LeBrun reports that there is no signal at present that a Dougie Hamilton trade is on the cards. Notwithstanding, the situation still stays dynamic, mainly due to Hamilton's contract situation, which has two more years to run and comes with a huge $9 million cap hit.Josh Wegman from The Score reported that a little while ago, Sportsnet's Elliotte Friedman made it known that Hamilton was not keen on moving to the San Jose Sharks. Recently, San Jose has turned out to be a surprise playoff contender, and the possibility that Hamilton might change his mind if the interest is revived has been talked about among the league watchers. Wegman additionally mentioned the Nashville Predators and a possible return to the Calgary Flames, but those both seem unlikely because of the team’s direction and contract issues.James Murphy from RG.Org gave extra insight that the Utah Mammoth were also interested last summer and could reacquaint through talks. At the same time, the Detroit Red Wings, Toronto Maple Leafs, and Vegas Golden Knights keep a close watch on the situation. Detroit and Utah are the two that get attention, as both have over $26 million in cap space, in addition to good draft and prospect assets.Cap limitations complicate the situation for Toronto and Vegas unless they are willing to move or take on some salary. Terry Koshan of the Toronto Sun and Kevin McGran of the Toronto Star both reported that Leafs GM Brad Treliving is still on the hunt for defense upgrades, with contract decisions within the organization possibly influencing the team’s trade flexibility as the March 6 deadline approaches.At this point, Dougie Hamilton is still a Devil, but the interest from other teams in the league has not diminished. It's tough to see this plot as over with the mix of salary cap difficulties, timing, and team direction.Also Read: NHL Trade Rumors: Ottawa Senators linked to Rasmus Andersson while Vancouver Canucks and Edmonton Oilers explore changes","The New Jersey Devils are involved in trade rumors, and Dougie Hamilton’s name is one of the most mentioned in this regard.

Who Benefits Most

The Los Angeles Dodgers are being widely viewed as the most serious destination for free agent infielder Bo Bichette. Around the league, few teams appear willing or able to meet his reported $240-300 million asking range. As a result, Los Angeles has separated itself as the only club clearly positioned to make a deal work.The plan, as currently discussed, would involve moving Bo Bichette to second base. That alignment keeps Mookie Betts flexible while addressing a position that quietly became a problem for the Los Angeles Dodgers last season. The fit is more about lineup balance than star power, even though the name value is undeniable.The expected framework is an eight-year deal worth between $240 million and $300 million. Annual value would likely land in the $25-30 million range, with a front-loaded structure and a player opt-out after the fourth season. This allows Los Angeles to limit long-term risk while still making a strong commitment.For Toronto, the situation resolves cleanly through free agency. There are no trade discussions involved.The Toronto Blue Jays avoid the risk of a rejected qualifying offer and would receive compensatory draft picks. Los Angeles, already projected near a $288 million payroll for 2026, can absorb the contract without changing its overall approach, similar to how it handled the Shohei Ohtani deal.Second base production was a clear weakness last season. Los Angeles Dodgers hitters at the position combined for a .649 OPS, ranking near the bottom of the league. Bichette’s career .294 batting average offers steady contact from the right side and helps balance a lineup built around Freddie Freeman and Ohtani.From Bo Bichette’s side, the move shifts him away from a roster entering a transition phase and into a team built to contend every year. Toronto gains payroll flexibility and can redirect resources toward younger players, while also moving on from a defender whose glove has graded below average in recent seasons.Bichette is 27 years old, born March 5, 1998. He is a two-time American League hits leader and a Silver Slugger winner, even as injuries and defensive decline have complicated his recent seasons.Los Angeles adds a reliable bat at a position of need and keeps its competitive window wide open through the end of the decade. The risks are real, health, defense, and blocked prospects like Freeland, but manageable given the roster depth.Also read: MLB Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Dodgers emerge as lone Big-Money Suitor for $300 million AL hits leader prior free agency Bichette secures a long-term deal and consistent postseason exposure. Toronto gains flexibility and future assets. If completed, the move reinforces how the Dodgers continue to separate themselves financially and competitively from the rest of the league.","The Los Angeles Dodgers are being widely viewed as the most serious destination for free agent infielder Bo Bichette.

Charlotte Hornets set to retire Dell Curry’s jersey



Dell Curry’s impact extends beyond the court and into the community



The former Charlotte Hornets sharpshooter Dell Curry recently received a heartfelt accolade. The franchise informed him that No. 30 will be retired on March 19 during a home game against the Orlando Magic. Dell, who is the father of Stephen and Seth Curry, had a remarkable career in the league with astonishing stats.Curry’s career was crucial in shaping the early identity of the Hornets. Also, his connection to the city never faded after retirement. The honor places him among the most enduring figures the organization has known.Dell Curry played 10 of his 16 NBA seasons in Charlotte after arriving through the 1988 expansion draft. Over that span, he became one of the league’s most reliable perimeter threats and a steady presence for a young franchise. He retired as Charlotte’s all-time leader in points and three-point field goals made, marks that stood for years. He still ranks near the top in games played, scoring, and shooting efficiency.“I never imagined it would happen,” Curry said. “It means so much to me. I do it because it’s what I love to do.The game gave me so much, the fans gave me so much and I want to stay involved just to give back what I can and make this organization what it should be and give the fans, the team and the broadcast and the show that it’s fun, we’re having a great time and come celebrate, come support. ... Man, it would be an injustice to try to put into words what this means. ”Hornets' leadership also shared their thoughts on the decision. “Dell Curry has been a cornerstone of the Charlotte Hornets for more than 25 years, both on and off the court,” Rick Schnall and Gabe Plotkin said.“He exemplifies what it means to be a Hornet through his professionalism, work ethic and commitment to excellence. Dell’s impact on our organization, our fans and our community is undeniable, and he is truly deserving of this honor.”Curry’s bond with Charlotte did not end when his playing days did. He has spent 17 seasons as the team’s television analyst, bringing familiarity and trust to broadcasts while staying connected to fans. Combined with his playing career, his time with the organization spans more than two decades.The city also watched his family grow. Stephen and Seth Curry developed their games in Charlotte gyms, while the community followed their paths through college and into the NBA. That shared history deepened the connection. “I still love the game. I love the fans. I love their interaction, not only in the arena, but when I go out to the community, I’m one of them. And they treat me as such, my whole family as such,” Curry said.When No. 30 rises to the rafters, it will honor Dell’s contribution to the franchise while celebrating his love for the city.Also Read: “Everything else doesn’t matter”: LeBron James sent a heartfelt message to fans supporting him throughout his 23-year career",Charlotte Hornets set to retire Dell Curry’s jersey on March 19.

Cole Ragans Performance Snapshot

Who Comes Out Ahead

The Boston Red Sox and Kansas City Royals are at the center of a growing trade rumor that has drawn attention across MLB circles. The idea is simple but significant: a straight swap sending Jarren Duran to Kansas City in exchange for left-handed pitcher Cole Ragans.Both teams are trying to solve clear problems. Boston needs another reliable arm at the top of its rotation. Kansas City needs a dependable everyday outfielder who can impact games on the bases and at the plate. This proposed deal addresses both without involving prospects or complex contracts.The trade would be a one-for-one exchange. Boston sends Duran, who is arbitration-eligible and under team control through 2028. Kansas City sends Ragans, also controlled through 2028, with a salary path that stays manageable and peaks at $7.5 million in 2027. From a financial standpoint, the move fits both clubs. Boston adds pitching without tax concerns, while Kansas City gains a controllable position player without long-term risk.For the Boston Red Sox, the appeal is rotation stability. Ragans has shown frontline ability when healthy and would slot in behind Garrett Crochet and Sonny Gray.His strikeout rate stands out, even in a shortened 2025 season affected by injury. Trading Duran also helps Boston manage an outfield logjam, with younger options like Ceddanne Rafaela already in place and Roman Anthony nearing readiness.The concern is durability. Ragans dealt with rotator cuff and groin issues in 2025, which lowers the margin for error in a division as demanding as the AL East.The Kansas City Royals get a clear everyday center fielder. Duran brings speed, power, and flexibility in the lineup, and his presence would help lengthen the order around Bobby Witt Jr. Kansas City avoids sacrificing prospects and fills a long-standing outfield need.The downside is obvious. Ragans has shown the ability to miss bats at an elite level, and moving that kind of arm always carries long-term risk, especially for a team building around sustained contention.Duran is a left-handed hitter with top-end speed and average center-field defense. He was born September 5, 1996, stands 6’1”, weighs 205 lbs, and was the 2024 All-Star Game MVP.Ragans struck out 223 batters in 2024 and posted a 14.4 K/9 with a 2.50 FIP in limited 2025 action. He remains under team control through 2028.Also read: MLB Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Dodgers emerge as lone Big-Money Suitor for $300 million AL hits leader prior free agency If Ragans stays healthy, Boston likely gains more long-term value by strengthening its rotation.

“MVP (Most Violations Player)”: Fans react to Dillon Brooks surpassing Green and Booker to become NBA’s technical foul leader,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/mvp-most-violations-player-fans-react-to-dillon-brooks-surpassing-green-and-booker-to-become-nbas-technical-foul-leader/articleshow/126530874.cms,"Dillon Brooks leads the NBA in technical fouls this season with 14, inching closer to a suspension. His aggressive playstyle, which often draws whistles, has sparked fan reactions and comparisons to Draymond Green. Despite the fouls, Brooks remains a key scorer for the Suns, who narrowly lost to the Heat.

Dillon Brooks is just a step away from reaching a century in technical fouls. This season, he has stepped almost 40 times on the court, and nearly had at least one technical foul call every three games. He picked up his league-leading 14th tech call on Tuesday in Miami against the Heat while being on offense. Yes, he had the ball advantage, and any contact while going for the rim would have resulted in free throws in favour of Suns.But Brooks and tech fouls go hand in hand, and after losing the possession against Heat’s Norman Powell’s defense, the duo appeared heated, leading to the referees calling a tech on Brooks.This season, Suns’ Brooks lead NBA in tech calls, followed by Warriors' defensive cornerstone, Draymond Green, with 9, and then Lakers’ superstar Luka Doncic is tied with Green with 9, and following him is Suns’ another entry, Devin Booker, with 6 tech calls.Brooks’s aggressive and unbending playing style and ability to get under people's skin have often put him in the limelight on court. In his rookie year, he had five techincals, and since the 2020-21 season, he kept it above 10. For the 2025-26 season, he already has 14 technicals, two more, and he’ll be facing a one-game suspension.After picking up his 14th tech foul in yesterday’s game against the Miami Heat, Brooks needs to tread carefully and should avoid any more whistles.But fans are not avoiding any chance to react to Brooks’ technical saga. One fan commented, “Brooks running away with MVP (Most Violations Player) race.” A second fan wrote, “Brooks wants to technical foul is way back to the Rockets.” while the third fan said, “Brooks just got max passion and a good rage baiter. ”A fan tagged Green’s official account and wrote, “are you gonna let dillon brooks of all people steal your flow?” Well, if not for Brooks, Green would have been leading the list.Another fan commented, “And yall said draymond was terrible lol. Don’t pay attention to the noise warriors and draymond.” Some fans wrote how they had guessed all the names but the last one on the list was a surprise, “ Would guessed ¾. Booker not so much.""The Suns lost to Heat in a close contest of 121-127, all thanks to the latter’s 35 point stream in the 4th quarter. Bam Adebayo was Heat’s leading scorer with 29 points, followed by Norman Powell’s 27 points. Despite the tech call, Dillon Brooks came as Suns’ top scorer with 24 points and 4 rebounds and went 11-of-24 from the field.Also read: Shaquille O’Neal stirs up the goat conversation by crowning Michael Jordan and putting Kobe Bryant over LeBron James","Dillon Brooks leads the NBA in technical fouls this season with 14.

Why that unscripted moment now defines Tomlin’s legacy

As Mike Tomlin steps away from the Pittsburgh Steelers, one of his most memorable mic’d-up moments is going viral, and the timing couldn’t have been better. The clip captured Tomlin at his most authentic, reacting instantly when lineman Broderick Jones realized the cameras were still on. The coach had no inhibitions even when faced by reporters with cameras.As the tackle asked the coach whether he was mic’d up, Tomlin’s answer was equal parts blunt and equal parts hilarious, while the spectators were left giggling. That raw exchange has resurfaced just hours after Tomlin confirmed he is stepping down, closing the book on an undisputed and unparalleled 19-season run with the team.As Jones inquired about the mic to his coach. Tomlin had the most savage reply, saying, “Shut up, shut your *** up, let’s go”, much to the tackle’s embarrassment. The viral mic’d-up clip resonates now as it reflects how players experienced him daily. When Jones hesitated after noticing the camera, Tomlin’s response proved that he had no filter with or without the camera.Tomlin’s exit came one day after Pittsburgh’s latest playoff disappointment. Since taking over in 2007, Tomlin built a résumé few coaches can match. He never had a losing season, guided the Steelers to 13 playoff appearances, won eight division titles, and lifted a Super Bowl trophy.In a league where coaches rarely last five years, Tomlin became an anomaly and was what the team needed.In his statement announcing the decision to step down, Tomlin thanked the organization, players, and fans, calling his tenure an “extraordinary honor.” He also expressed his gratitude for having the privilege to lead the team successfully for many years and also added that he is now looking forward to the team’s future prospects.Now, Pittsburgh faces a rare moment of uncertainty, as the franchise has had only three head coaches since 1969, and choosing the next one will shape its future for years. Tomlin leaves behind a legacy that will continue to be remembered for generations, and his successor will have a lot to live up to.Also read: What comes next for Mike Tomlin following Steelers’ latest postseason disappointment","Mike Tomlin confirmed he is stepping down as head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers.

A record untouched without even playing

Why this matters for Patrick Mahomes’ legacy

Also Read:

The 2025 NFL playoffs feel a little strange without the Patrick Mahomes-led Kansas City Chiefs. For the first time in more than a decade, the Chiefs are not part of the postseason picture. Yet, even while watching from the sidelines, Mahomes still managed to hold on to a major playoff milestone.Mahomes, who turned 30 this season, remains second on the NFL’s all-time list for playoff touchdown passes. That record stayed untouched during the Wild Card round, despite a rare opportunity for it to change.What makes this situation striking is that Mahomes did not need to take a single snap this postseason to protect his record. With the Chiefs missing the playoffs after a disappointing 2025 campaign, Mahomes could only watch as other quarterbacks attempted and failed to close the gap.Rodgers needed just two playoff touchdown passes to overtake Mahomes. Instead, his Wild Card outing ended scoreless through the air, with turnovers proving costly. As a result, Mahomes officially cannot drop below second place on the all-time playoff touchdown list this season.The only player still comfortably ahead is Tom Brady, whose playoff touchdown total remains the gold standard. Brady’s postseason résumé is nearly unmatched, but Mahomes’ pace has kept him firmly in the conversation, even with fewer playoff appearances.Because the Chiefs failed to qualify for the playoffs this year, Mahomes had no chance to add to his total. That also means he could not close the gap on Brady at the top. However, the silver lining for Kansas City fans is clear: Mahomes cannot lose his second-place spot, no matter how the rest of the playoffs unfold.The absence of the Chiefs from postseason football has been one of the biggest surprises of the 2025 season. Injuries, including Mahomes’ late-season ACL tear, and overall team struggles led to a disappointing 6-11 finish. It marked the end of a long playoff streak under head coach Andy Reid.Even so, Mahomes’ playoff resume continues to shine. His past postseason runs, filled with comeback wins and clutch performances, built a cushion that protected his standing this year.Watching an NFL postseason without Mahomes feels unusual. But it may not last long. If history is any guide, the Chiefs and their star quarterback will be back soon. And when Mahomes returns to the playoff stage, his slow but steady chase of Brady’s legendary record will continue.For now, one thing is certain: Patrick Mahomes’ playoff touchdown record remains safe even in a season he didn’t play.","Patrick Mahomes is second on the NFL’s all-time list for playoff touchdown passes.

Jayden Daniels’ injury timeline explained

What the Saudi Flag Football Classic involves

Also Read:

Washington Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels is officially returning to the field, ending weeks of uncertainty around his injury status. The young QB is set to take part in Fanatics Flag Football Classic in Saudi Arabia, an announcement that also confirms he has recovered from the injuries that limited his 2025 NFL season.The update came directly from Tom Brady, who revealed Daniels as one of the team captains during the launch of Fanatics Studios. The event will be held in Riyadh in March and will feature several current and former NFL stars competing in an Olympic-style flag football format.Daniels played just seven games during the 2025 season before suffering a dislocated elbow in a heavy loss to the Minnesota Vikings in December. The injury effectively ended his year and raised concerns about how quickly he would be able to return to football activities.While the Commanders have stayed quiet about detailed medical updates, Daniels’ inclusion in the Saudi Arabia event is a strong sign that his recovery has gone well. Participating as a team captain suggests he is not only healthy but also trusted to handle leadership responsibilities on the field.The Fanatics Flag Football Classic will feature three teams, each captained by an NFL quarterback. Brady will captain one team, Daniels another, with a third captain yet to be announced. Games will follow five-on-five Olympic-style flag football rules, played on a shorter field with two 20-minute halves.Several big NFL names are expected to take part, including Saquon Barkley, Christian McCaffrey, CeeDee Lamb, Myles Garrett and Rob Gronkowski.

Bangladesh seek T20 WC match shift from India after Mustafizur Rahman's IPL exit

Poll Should the BCB consider compensating players if they don't participate in the World Cup? Absolutely, it’s only fair No, players must accept the risks Maybe, but it depends on the situation

NEW DELHI: Bangladesh cricket plunged into fresh turmoil on Wednesday as the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) publicly distanced itself from controversial remarks made by its director Najmul Islam, even as players threatened to boycott domestic matches and uncertainty deepened over the national team’s participation in the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup in India.The controversy erupted after Najmul questioned the commitment of national cricketers, suggesting that certain players had failed to justify the support and resources invested in them. His comments were widely seen as disrespectful, triggering a strong backlash from former internationals, players’ bodies and fans on social media.Responding to the uproar, the BCB issued a formal statement expressing regret over any remarks that may have been deemed inappropriate or hurtful, firmly stating that the comments did not reflect the board’s official position. “The BCB does not endorse or take responsibility for any statement unless it is formally issued through the board’s designated spokesperson or the Media and Communications Department,” the statement read, underlining that comments made outside authorised channels are personal in nature.It has since emerged that players had threatened to boycott Thursday’s Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) match unless the board took a clear stand and protected players’ honour.The board also warned that it would take appropriate disciplinary action against any individual whose conduct or comments disrespect cricketers or damage the reputation and integrity of Bangladesh cricket.Reaffirming its stance, the BCB said it holds all past and present players in the highest regard. “Players remain at the heart of Bangladesh cricket, and their contributions and welfare continue to be a top priority,” the statement added.Najmul’s remarks came against the backdrop of an escalating standoff involving the ICC, and the BCCI over the T20 World Cup venue. Last week, Najmul courted further controversy by calling former captain Tamim Iqbal an “Indian agent” after Tamim urged the board not to be driven by emotion while deciding on Bangladesh’s participation in the World Cup in India.The BCB has cited security concerns in refusing to travel to India, particularly after the BCCI instructed an IPL franchise Kolkata Knight Riders to release pacer Mustafizur Rahman from its 2026 squad amid tense bilateral relations. While the ICC remains reluctant to shift Bangladesh’s matches out of India, the BCB has stayed adamant.Former captain Mohammad Ashraful criticised public attacks on players by administrators. “Issues should be handled internally. Such remarks demoralise players and damage the image of Bangladesh cricket,” he wrote on social media. The Cricketers’ Welfare Association of Bangladesh (CWAB) said it was “stunned, shocked and outraged” by Najmul’s comments, calling them “utterly condemnable”.Adding fuel to the fire, BCB finance committee chairman Najmul Hossain said the board would not face financial loss if Bangladesh skipped the World Cup. “There will be no loss for the Bangladesh Cricket Board; the loss will be for the players,” he said, noting that match fees and performance bonuses go directly to players. He also rejected the idea of compensating players if the team withdraws.",Bangladesh cricket plunged into fresh turmoil on Wednesday as the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) publicly distanced itself from controversial remarks made by its director Najmul Islam.

Bangladesh seek T20 WC match shift from India after Mustafizur Rahman's IPL exit

NEW DELHI: As Bangladesh’s participation remains uncertain in the upcoming ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) finance committee chairman Najmul Hossain said on Wednesday that if the men’s team decides not to play in the World Cup, the board would not face any financial loss,""There will be no loss for the Bangladesh Cricket Board [if we don't take part in the World Cup] as the loss will be for the players,"" Najmul said, as cited by Circbuzz. ""Up to 2027, our revenue will not be hampered because in the 2022 ICC financial meeting, this was already fixed. Future World Cups or future bilateral or international events may have relevance, for example whether teams will come to us under the FTP. Those are valid questions. But this World Cup does not affect that.""Najmul clarified that match fees and performance bonuses are paid directly to players, and the board does not profit or lose from them. ""The players will lose because when they play, they receive a match fee for every match. If someone participates in a match, or becomes man of the match, or has some kind of special performance, then according to ICC rules and match regulations they get what is due to them. That money belongs exactly to the player. The board has no connection with that. Meaning the board does not gain or lose anything from this. Whether Bangladesh plays here or not, the board has no profit or loss from this, at least not for this World Cup,"" he was quoted as saying by Cricbuzz.The remarks follow speculation that the BCB could face financial repercussions if it decides not to travel to India for the World Cup, citing security concerns. The ICC had urged Bangladesh to reconsider after the board informed the BCCI of its reluctance. The situation intensified after the BCCI instructed IPL franchise Kolkata Knight Riders to release Mustafizur Rahman amid political tensions between the two countries.Najmul also rejected the idea of compensating players if Bangladesh pulls out. ""Why [should we compensate?] If they go somewhere and cannot do anything, then the crores of Taka we spend behind them, do we ask for that money back from them? Do we? Answer me,"" he said. He added that players would find it difficult to survive without the board.Najmul has previously courted controversy with claims that Bangladesh opener Tamim Iqbal was an Indian agent.",Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) finance committee chairman Najmul Hossain says the board would not face any financial loss if the men’s team decides not to play in the World Cup.

Easy to score runs in ODIs?

Spectators are priority! Here's what IPL must learn from the SA20 experience

NEW DELHI: Former India spinner Harbhajan Singh has shared his opinion on Sanjay Manjrekar ’s remark suggesting that Virat Kohli chose “the easiest format to play” by continuing in ODIs while stepping away from Test cricket. Harbhajan defended Kohli’s stature and consistency, calling such opinions unfair and dismissive of what it takes to succeed at the highest level.Harbhajan responded during an event on Wednesday, making it clear that scoring runs in any format is never easy.“If it was so easy to score runs in any format, then everyone would have made it. Let’s just enjoy what people are doing. They are playing well, winning games, scoring runs, and taking wickets. That's all that matters. It doesn't matter who plays which format. Virat, whether he plays in one format or all formats, has been a fantastic player and a big time match winner for India,” Harbhajan said.He further underlined Kohli’s influence on Indian cricket and his role as an inspiration for younger players.“They inspire the next generation. Manjrekar has his own way of thinking. The way I see it is that Virat and these players have played a major role to take this game forward.Virat is an unbelievable player. Even today, if he plays Test cricket, he will be our main player,” he added.Manjrekar’s comments came at a time when Kohli has been in excellent form in the ODI format.The former India batter, known for his blunt opinions, suggested that modern-day one-day cricket has become significantly easier for top-order batters.In an Instagram video, Manjrekar explained his stance by comparing batting roles across formats.“A lot of people have asked me why I keep saying ODI cricket is easy for top-order batters,” he said, pointing out that several Indian batters preferred opening in ODIs but were content batting in the middle order in Tests.He added that limited fielding restrictions and bowlers focusing more on run control than wickets make life simpler for top-order batters in ODIs.Manjrekar’s remarks triggered widespread debate and criticism, especially after Kohli scored a fluent 93 in the first ODI against New Zealand on Sunday. Kohli’s brother, Vikas Kohli, also issued a strong response in defence of the former India captain.","Former India spinner Harbhajan Singh responds to comments made by Sanjay Manjrekar.

campaign vs USA

NEW DELHI: India’s Under-19 World Cup campaign begins on Thursday in southern Africa with the spotlight firmly on a 14-year-old prodigy who is already knocking on the doors of history. Vaibhav Sooryavanshi, the most talked-about name in age-group cricket over the past year, is on the verge of surpassing Virat Kohli ’s Youth ODI run tally as India open their tournament against USA in Zimbabwe and Namibia.Sooryavanshi needs just six runs to go past Kohli’s 978 runs in Under-19 ODIs, a record the former India captain accumulated in 25 innings. What makes the moment striking is the pace at which the teenager has risen. Sooryavanshi has piled up 973 runs in only 18 innings at a staggering average of 54.05, already boasting three centuries and four half-centuries. Kohli, by contrast, averaged 46.57 with one hundred and six fifties at the same level.The opener is also only 27 runs away from completing 1,000 runs in Youth ODI cricket. Should he get there, Sooryavanshi will become just the seventh Indian to reach the landmark and the third fastest, after Shubman Gill and Unmukt Chand.The numbers underline a meteoric rise that has seen him become a household name through his exploits not just for India Under-19 and India A, but also in the IPL, where his fearless batting has already turned heads.India, five-time champions of the tournament, start as overwhelming favourites as they chase a record-extending sixth title. Champions in 2000, 2008, 2012, 2018 and 2022, they are looking to bounce back after finishing runners-up to Australia in the previous edition. The Under-19 World Cup has long been a launchpad for future greats, with names such as Kohli, Rohit Sharma, Kane Williamson, Joe Root and Steve Smith all emerging from this stage.This Indian squad looks formidable on paper, having won 13 of their last 16 matches, including series victories in England, Australia and South Africa. Alongside Sooryavanshi, skipper Ayush Mhatre, vice-captain Vihaan Malhotra and Asia Cup top-scorer Aaron George form the batting core, while pacer Deepesh Devendran could be an X-factor with his awkward action.Placed in Group B with New Zealand, Bangladesh and USA, India begin against the Americans before facing Bangladesh on January 17 and New Zealand on January 24 in Bulawayo.","Vaibhav Sooryavanshi is on the verge of surpassing Virat Kohli ’s Youth ODI run tally.

Denver Nuggets vs Dallas Mavericks Records, Stakes, and Game Outlook

when theface the Dallas Mavericks on. A knee injury has ruled him out, forcing Denver to approach this game without the player who usually controls every part of their offense. What was expected to be a high-profile Western Conference matchup now becomes a test of depth, rotation management, and decision-making on both sides.The Nuggets arrive in Dallas with a strong overall record, but this game presents a different challenge. Jokic’s absence changes how Denver runs its offense, spaces the floor, and finishes possessions. Dallas, despite its struggles this season, gets a clear opportunity to take advantage of a weakened opponent at home.Nikola Jokic is dealing with a bone bruise in his knee and has been officially ruled out. His absence is part of a wider injury problem for Denver Nuggets. Cameron Johnson is also out with a knee injury, while Jonas Valanciunas will miss the game due to a calf strain. Christian Braun is listed as questionable with an ankle sprain.Jamal Murray and Aaron Gordon are listed as game-time decisions, and whether they play could shape the entire night for Denver.Without Jokic, the Nuggets are missing their top scorer, rebounder, and playmaker all at once. That shifts the offense toward the guards, with less time spent running sets through the middle and more emphasis on quick reads and ball movement.Dallas is also dealing with injuries. P.J. Washington is out with an ankle issue, and Dereck Lively II will miss the game because of a foot injury. Losing both players thins the frontcourt and makes it harder for Dallas to protect the rim.Even so, Dallas benefits from playing at home and facing a Nuggets team missing its most important player. That context has pushed the Mavericks into the role of slight favorites despite their overall record.Before the injury, Jokic was once again producing at an elite level. He was averaging near triple-doubles and leading an offense shooting above 50 percent from the field. Nearly every Denver possession flowed through him, whether he was scoring, passing, or drawing defensive attention.When Jokic is out, Jamal Murray carries more of the load. He has been putting up about 24 points, over four rebounds, and close to seven assists per game. Those numbers help keep Denver competitive, but they don’t replace what Jokic brings, especially when games slow down and possessions matter late.Denver comes in with a 22-9 record and has been reliable on the road at 12-4. Dallas is 12-21, but the circumstances give them a chance to change the direction of their season.Also read: Denver Nuggets vs Dallas Mavericks injury report: Injured and questionable players, where to watch, team stats, and more (January 14, 2026) This game comes down to how clean both teams play.

Bangladesh seek T20 WC match shift from India after Mustafizur Rahman's IPL exit

Pakistan wicketkeeper-batter Mohammad Rizwan found himself at the centre of a debate after he was asked to retire out during a Big Bash League (BBL) match between Melbourne Renegades and Sydney Thunder. The decision, taken by Renegades captain Will Sutherland, came after Rizwan scored 26 off 23 balls, an innings that again brought focus on criticism around his strike rate in T20 cricket.The move sparked discussion in Pakistan’s cricket circles, with several former players and fans calling it disrespectful for a player of Rizwan’s standing. The incident was discussed on a Pakistani channel, GTV Sports, where former Pakistan wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal was asked to share his views. During the show, the host also raised the question of whether Rizwan should leave the league and return to Pakistan as a mark of protest.The host said, ""What happened to Rizwan has not only caused mockery worldwide but has also created a sense of humiliation. Some are even saying Rizwan should leave the league and return home. During the first season of the IPL, Younis Khan was kept on the bench while playing alongside you for the Rajasthan Royals.He famously stated, ‘I am the captain of Pakistan; I will not sit on the bench. You must send me back with respect. ’ we have seen players stand up for themselves like that.""Akmal agreed that the situation should not have unfolded the way it did but said modern T20 cricket demands quick scoring. ""Absolutely. I also believe this should not happen; he is our top player and a proven performer. However, you have to realise how fast these leagues are. Every country is now following the modern-day approach to cricket, so it is vital to develop yourself accordingly. Rizwan has been playing with the same mindset since he started in T20s. In Australia, they view the game through a specific lens. We have seen similar tactical moves in the ILT20 and the IPL,"" Akmal said.He pointed out that such decisions are not limited to one league or one player. Akmal recalled an incident from the IPL involving India batter Tilak Varma. ""Even a key player like Tilak Varma was called back to the dugout. While these moves are based on the match situation, Rizwan needs to consider his future path,"" he said.Akmal concluded by stressing that Rizwan needs to adapt if he wants to continue playing T20 cricket at the highest level. ""I have been saying for three or four years that the way he is playing will make the future very difficult. Modern-day cricket is moving at a rapid pace, and you must adapt. It should not have happened to our best player and the Pakistan captain, but he has, in a sense, given them a reason to make that call. ""","Pakistan wicketkeeper-batter Mohammad Rizwan was asked to retire out during a Big Bash League (BBL) match between Melbourne Renegades and Sydney Thunder.

Adin Ross may quit Kick temporarily after backlash and earnings drop

“f—– up.”

“big streams”

“girl, get up,”





Twitch and Kick streamer Adin Ross is facing heavy backlash after comments he made about rapper Doechii and other Black women sparked outrage online. The 25-year-old streamer reportedly saw his monthly earnings on Kick drop by more than 30%, which has fueled speculation that he may take a temporary break from the platform. While Ross has not officially confirmed quitting, tensions between him and Kick reportedly grew after a reduction in partner payouts following his switch to a new betting sponsor. Fans and critics alike have been discussing the controversy, making it one of the biggest topics in the streaming community.The controversy started after Ross criticized Doechii, calling her anand using offensive language in response to a Met Gala clip showing her scolding staff. He later released a diss track calledwith rapper 6ix9ine, further insulting her, which drew strong reactions from members of the Black community, as well as hip-hop figures like Glasses Malone and Joe Budden. In response, Ross pledged six figures to Black-owned businesses and denied that his comments were racist, but the backlash has continued, affecting both his reputation and his earnings.Ross reportedly claimed that Kick reduced his partner earnings after he joined Rainbet instead of Stake, calling the situationHe also rejected a 2025 Kick deal and announced that he would no longer doon the platform. While he plans to continue streaming on Twitch, including appearances with guests like 6ix9ine, the ongoing friction with Kick and the loss of revenue highlight the financial impact of the controversy.Previous breaks and equity claims in 2024 show that this tension between Ross and the platform is not new.This has already led to Ross losing multi-million-dollar endorsements as well as NBA partnerships despite his efforts to restore his public image. Doechii has, on the other hand, seemingly referenced the conflict in her own trackfeaturing SZA, questioning why successful black women are subject to so much hate. At the moment, Ross is still streaming but seems to be carefully considering his next step in light of the conflict while still being able to sustain his streaming career.Also Read: Kai Cenat net worth timeline (2016 to 2026): Breaking down his rise from early content to streaming dominance",Adin Ross may quit Kick temporarily after backlash and earnings drop.

T.J. Watt speaks honestly as Mike Tomlin avoids future talk after another Steelers playoff loss

T.J. Watt did not hide his feelings after another tough playoff night. The Pittsburgh Steelers saw their season end with a heavy 30–6 loss to the Houston Texans in the AFC wild-card game on Sunday. This loss made it seven straight postseason defeats for Pittsburgh, a number that keeps growing and hurting more each year.For Watt, the pain runs deep. He has been with the team since 2017 and has now been part of six of those seven playoff losses. After the game, the veteran linebacker spoke honestly about the team’s struggles and his own frustration. His words showed how hard these losses have been on the players.This was also the third straight season the Steelers were knocked out in the wild-card round. The team never found momentum, and the Texans controlled the game from start to finish. As the locker room cleared, questions again turned to what is going wrong in January for a team known for its proud history.T.J. Watt did not try to soften his message. He spoke straight from the heart and admitted he does not have easy answers anymore.“I haven’t had the answer for a long time, so don’t ask me,” Watt said. “Sitting up here again, same story.Going to have to take a long look in the mirror. Going to take this one in. This stinks. Thought it was going to be a different story. Same story. I mean, you guys saw what happened.”The numbers back up his pain. The Steelers’ last playoff win came in the 2016 season. That year, they went 2–1 in the postseason before losing to the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game. Since then, every playoff trip has ended early.Sunday’s loss also put the Steelers in the record books for the wrong reason. They became the first team in NFL history to lose five straight playoff games by double-digit points. That stat has raised serious questions among fans and analysts.Many eyes then turned to head coach Mike Tomlin, who has led the team since 2007. But Tomlin made it clear he was not ready to talk about his future.“I’m not even in that mindset as I sit here tonight,” Tomlin said. “I’m more in the mindset of what transpired in this stadium and certainly what we did and didn’t do. Not a big-picture mentality as I sit here tonight.”Mike Tomlin’s greatest moment came in 2008, when he guided the Steelers to a Super Bowl XLIII win. However, recent playoff results have kept pressure on the franchise. For now, the team faces another long offseason filled with hard questions and honest reflection.Also Read: T.J.

Monkey spotted in IGI stands

NEW DELHI: A day after Denmark’s Mia Blichfeldt slammed the unhealthy conditions at the Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium, the venue for the ongoing India Open Super 750, another Danish badminton player Anders Antonsen revealed that he withdrew from the tournament for a third straight year due to what he described as “extreme” air pollution in Delhi. The world No. 3 posted on Instagram: “Many are curious why I’ve pulled out of the India Open for the third year.Due to the extreme pollution in Delhi at the moment, I don’t think it’s a place to host a badminton tournament.”The four-time World Championships medallist posted a screenshot of Delhi’s air quality index reading a staggering 348 as hazardous.Anders Antonsen’s decision to pull out, however, has earned him a $5,000 fine from the Badminton World Federation (BWF).This year’s India Open is being staged at the Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium after the Badminton Association of India (BAI) moved the tournament from the KD Jadhav Indoor Stadium, also in Delhi.The Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium also set to host the BWF World Championships in August, making the India Open a designated test event.Antonsen, however, remained unconvinced. “Crossing my fingers that it will be better in the summer when the World Championships take place in Delhi,” he posted, before adding pointedly, “As a result, BWF has once again fined me $5,000.”A monkey was spotted in one of the spectator galleries at the India Open here on Wednesday, reports PTI.The monkey drew considerable attention from fans inside the stadium and on social media.

Allan Donald on Virat Kohli’s legacy: Can he reach 100 centuries?

BENGALURU: Devdutt Padikkal could hardly have asked for a richer purple patch than the one he is currently enjoying in the Vijay Hazare Trophy. The numbers underline the effort: a tournament-record 719 runs from eight matches at an astonishing average of 103, embellished by four centuries and two half-centuries.Defending champions Karnataka have built their campaign on the solid base laid by the prolific left-handed opener. Come Thursday, Padikkal’s form will once again be under the spotlight when Karnataka face a formidable Vidarbha unit in the first semifinal — a repeat of last year’s title clash. Padikkal’s dominance has been central to Karnataka’s batting. The other members of the top order — skipper Mayank Agarwal , Karun Nair and R Smaran — have sparkled in patches.That means added responsibility on the quartet, along with wicketkeeper-batter KL Shrijith and the explosive Abhinav Manohar, to raise their collective output against a Vidarbha side that has dismantled opponents through cohesion rather than individual brilliance.Vidarbha, too, draw their batting strength from a young run-machine, Aman Mokhade. He is just a rung below Padikkal on the tournament charts with 643 runs and four centuries.He is backed by an experienced toporder featuring Dhruv Shorey and former Karnataka mainstay R Samarth.The conditions could also play a decisive role. The semifinals and final will be played under lights. Karnataka, who opted for a four-pronged pace attack in the quarterfinal against Mumbai, may once again weigh the conditions carefully. Among Karnataka’s pacers, Vidhyadhar Patil has stood out for his consistency and control.A 1.30 pm start will neutralise early assistance for bowlers, making defending totals less demanding.","Devdutt Padikkal has a tournament-record 719 runs from eight matches at an astonishing average of 103.

How Lil Wayne’s Packers loyalty sparked the exchange after another Bears win

NFL rivalries have always been emotional but in 2026, they don’t end when the clock hits zero.

His response was short, composed, and confident.That single line said everything. Williams acknowledged Wayne’s passion, stayed loyal to his team and refused to turn the moment into a feud.Not long after, Lil Wayne followed up with a message that flipped the narrative completely. While reaffirming his Packers loyalty, he openly praised Williams’ talent, calling him a “killa” and a “beast” who had “kilt us bad each time.”Wayne made it clear the frustration came from watching his team lose, not from disrespect toward Williams. He even added a “praise gesture,” acknowledging the quarterback’s skill while still standing firm as a Packers fan. It was competitive, honest, and surprisingly respectful.More than anything, the moment showed how modern sports rivalries unfold online, intense in the moment, viral within minutes and often resolved just as quickly when both sides keep perspective.The Bears-Packers rivalry isn’t going anywhere and neither is the emotion that comes with it.

Cameron Jordan explains his stance on Trent Williams and Tristan Wirfs

Cameron Jordan has reached the stage of his career where honesty comes easy. After 15 NFL seasons, the New Orleans Saints defensive end speaks like a veteran who has faced every style of offensive lineman imaginable. That experience framed a podcast banter that quickly drew attention across league circles.Jordan, who has played through recurring knee and ankle wear common for edge rushers, understands how bodies change in the trenches. Those injuries shape how linemen train, move, and survive across long seasons. That perspective guided his comments during a relaxed conversation rather than a formal interview.The moment came on the podcast ""Why Is Draymond Green Talking About Football? with Jordan Schultz"". The topic centered on whether elite offensive linemen truly deserve the label “athletic” or if strength often gets mistaken for movement skill.Jordan first addressed San Francisco 49ers left tackle Trent Williams, pushing back on the athletic label while still offering evident respect. Speaking on the podcast, Jordan said, “No. He’s hella strong, though, and he makes hella highlights off of getting to the second level.”He added that Williams remains dominant because of power, balance, and timing, not because he moves like a skill player.The conversation then shifted to Tampa Bay Buccaneers tackle Tristan Wirfs, a familiar NFC South rival. That is where Jordan delivered the line that spread quickly online. “He’s fat as hell. Stop,” Jordan said on the same episode, before immediately following up with context. “Shout out to Tristan Wirfs for being a hell of an offensive tackle though.”Jordan never questioned Wirfs’ ability or resume. Wirfs remains the only player in NFL history to earn first-team All-Pro honors at both right and left tackle. His Combine testing in 2020 ranked among the best ever for offensive linemen, and his on-field consistency backs that up.Jordan’s point focused on language, not performance. From a defender’s view, leverage, hand placement, and core strength decide battles, not straight-line speed. That distinction matters to players who live in the trenches.The comments landed loudly because they felt unfiltered. Still, the tone stayed rooted in respect. Jordan spoke like a veteran talking football, not like a player taking shots. In today’s NFL media space, that kind of honesty still grabs attention.Also Read: Cameron Jordan car collection: Inside the New Orleans Saints star’s luxury garage featuring Range Rover and Mercedes models",New Orleans Saints defensive end Cameron Jordan speaks like a veteran who has faced every style of offensive lineman imaginable.

WPL: Lizelle Lee stars in DC's thrilling seven-wicket win over UPW,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/wpl/wpl-lizelle-lee-stars-in-dcs-thrilling-seven-wicket-win-over-upw/articleshow/126537853.cms,"Lizelle Lee (PTI Photo)

Allan Donald on Virat Kohli’s legacy: Can he reach 100 centuries?

NAVI MUMBAI: Playing in her maiden Women’s Premier League season, South African ‘keeper-bat Lizelle Lee smashed her second half-century (67, 44b, 8x4, 3x6) on the trot to star in Delhi Capitals’ nerve-jangling seven-wicket win over UP Warriorz at the DY Patil Stadium on Wednesday night.The game went right down the wire as UPW fought back late, leaving DC with six to get in the final over, bowled by Sophie Ecclestone. South African captain Laura Wolvaardt (25 not out, 24b, 2x4, 1x6) stroked a four to cover off the second ball to bring it down to just two off four balls, but Ecclestone bounced back brilliantly to take it to the last ball, with DC needing one.Wolvaardt then smashed the ball through the cover region for a four to seal DC’s maiden victory in WPL-2026, and also the first under their new captain Jemimah Rodrigues (21, 14b, 3x4). Unfortunately, it came in front of empty stands as no crowds were allowed due to local municipal elections on Thursday.Coming off a 54-ball 86-run knock in her previous outing against Gujarat Giants, the 33-year-old Lee, who plays in Women’s T20 leagues around the world and has scored 1896 runs in 82 T20Is for South Africa, flourished again. It was the so far winless UP Warriorz’ third straight defeat, certainly a bad start for their new head coach Abhishek Nayar.Chasing 155, DC were provided an ideal 94-run start in 69 balls by Lee and India opener Shafali Varma (36, 32b, 6x4).For some reason, UPW hardly gave a chance to India’s ace off-spinning allrounder Deepti Sharma to do anything in the match-she scored two after coming to bat at No 9 in the final over, and came on to bowl as late as the 15th over.Suffering a stunning collapse, the Warriorz lost six wickets for 20 runs in 26 balls after skipper Meg Lanning, playing against her former team, scored a half-century (54, 38b, 9x4, 1x6).However, the biggest talking point of UPW’s innings, which finished at 154 for eight in 20 overs, was their debatable decision to retire out his India batter Harleen Deol when she was batting on 47 (36b, 7x4). Looking shocked after being asked to leave the crease by Nayar, Harleen became just the second player in WPL to be retired out -with both the decisions coming in two consecutive days-after Gujarat Giants retired out debutant Ayushi Soni (11, 144b) against Mumbai Indians on Tuesday night.However, while GG’s decision proved to be bang on, with incoming batter Bharti Fulmali smashing 36 not out off 15 balls, UPW’s move, taken to ensure a good finish to the innings after 17 overs, didn’t work out well, as next batter South Africa allrounder Chloe Tryon (1), playing her first match after sitting in the MI dugout for three years, and replacing Deandra Dottin in this game, was caught at deep mid-wicket after just balls, off Shree Charani, triggering a slide.The decision to retire her three short of a fifty is surely going to hurt Harleen’s confidence, as she is an experienced player and was a part of India’s World Cup winning team last year, unlike Ayushi, who is a rookie.After Sophie Ecclestone (3) and ‘keeper-bat Shweta Sehrawat (11) were gone, India’s ace allrounder walked in at Deepti Sharma at No 9-another highly questionable call.Deepti perished for just two, as part-time off-spinner Shafali Verma took two wickets in the final over of the innings, finishing with 2-16 in four overs to show her worth as a bowler. From 141-3 in 17 overs, UPW sank to 152 for eight in the final over.Earlier, after Rodrigues won the toss and chose to bowl first again for the third straight time, big-hitting opener Kiran Navgire’s woeful tournament-she was out for 1 & 5 in the previous matches-continued as the Maharashtra batter was caught at mid-off off SA speedster Marizanne Kapp, who finished with 2-24 in four overs.Lanning, who scored her 10th WPL half-century, put on a 35-ball 47-run partnership for the second wicket with Phoebe Litchfield (27, 20b, 5x4) and then 85 in 56 balls for the third wicket with Harleen.","Lizelle Lee scores 67 in Delhi Capitals' seven-wicket win over UP Warriorz.

DJ Akademiks and SummyahMarie livestream clash and the messages that followed





The online fight between DJ Akademiks and streamer SummyahMarie has grown bigger after private text messages were shared online. The issue centers on serious claims made by Akademiks, who said SummyahMarie was part of what he called “escort culture. ” She strongly denied this and later sent him a cease-and-desist letter to protect her name.This controversy arose during a livestream on January 10, 2026, when SummyahMarie appeared on the DAkademiks show to confront the accusations head-on. It did not take long for the dialogue to escalate as Akademiks brought up Summyah’s traveling with rappers and reiterated his charges against her. SummyahMarie countered and declared the accusations to be untrue while a few days later, on January 13, 2026, SummyahMarie uploaded pictures of the text messages between them. The messages revealed her legal notice and Akademiks’ reply, which once again put the matter into the limelight and led to new discussions online.During the January 10 livestream, DJ Akademiks questioned why SummyahMarie was in Turks and Caicos with rapper Trippie Redd. He suggested that such trips fit a pattern he called “escort culture.” SummyahMarie firmly denied this and explained that she was invited to stream and create content, not for any personal reason.She also said many women were invited on the same trip and accused Akademiks of focusing only on her to push a false story. She denied having any romantic relationship with Trippie Redd and said the claims were hurting her career.After the stream, SummyahMarie sent Akademiks a cease-and-desist letter in PDF form. In one message, she wrote:“There is a difference. I am not an escort. That statement about me is false.”Akademiks replied by saying the situation was not serious to him and questioned why legal steps were taken. He also asked for her phone number to talk privately instead of handling it through legal messages. SummyahMarie later explained that she chose a legal route to protect her image and allow Akademiks a chance to correct the statement.According to HotNewHipHop, the tension began when Akademiks reacted to a clip where SummyahMarie and friends discussed financial expectations in relationships. Akademiks addressed the clip on his livestream, which later led to the escort claims.Akademiks publicly confirmed on his January 13, 2026 livestream that he received the cease-and-desist letter and said he felt legal action after an online argument was unnecessary. The disagreement remains unresolved, with both sides standing firm on their versions of events.Also Read: IShowSpeed Net Worth Timeline (2016 To 2026): How YouTuber And Streamer Darren Watkins Jr. Built His Fortune Over The Years","The online fight between DJ Akademiks and streamer SummyahMarie has grown bigger after private text messages were shared online.
