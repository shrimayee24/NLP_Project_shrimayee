Derrick Henry Ready to win in Baltimore w/ Lamar, NFL legacy, Alabama’s best & RB future |The Pivot

I knew once free agency started that I wanted to work something out [with the Ravens] if we could,

Even though I’m living in Dallas and Dallas being a perfect situation, as well, because we lived there, we ain’t got to move…”

“They ain’t holla at me at all,”

Dallas could have been a perfect fit, but now Henry is locked in with the Ravens

Baltimore Ravens ’ star running back Derrick Henry has officially sold his Dallas home, but it’s not just a routine real estate transaction—it’s a symbolic farewell to a long-standing dream. Henry, who was once rumored to be eyeing a future with the Dallas Cowboys , sold the property for $1.6 million, falling short of its original asking price. This move marks the final chapter in his connection to Dallas, a city he once hoped to call his permanent NFL home.Henry originally bought the luxurious 4,154-square-foot home in Inwood Park in 2022. Featuring 20-foot ceilings, floor-to-ceiling windows, marble floors, and hardwood flooring, the property was a high-end investment. The stunning residence offers four bedrooms, four bathrooms, and a spacious three-car garage. Designed for both comfort and style, it boasts a gourmet kitchen, a cozy fireplace, custom walk-in closets, and a lush turf backyard perfect for outdoor relaxation.He first listed it for $1.8 million in 2023 but later took it off the market before relisting it at $1.6 million with a different real estate agency.According to TMZ, the final sale amount has not been disclosed, but sources suggest it was close to the lowered asking price. The sale ends Henry’s residential ties to Dallas, a city he had considered home due to his girlfriend, Adrianna Rivas , having family in the area.While Henry’s Dallas residency was partly personal, it was also fueled by his football aspirations. The running back admitted onpodcast that he had wanted to play for the Cowboys.” Henry said. “Unfortunately for Henry, the Cowboys never approached him.he revealed, making it clear that the interest was one-sided.Many Cowboys fans were thrilled by the idea of Derrick Henry joining the team and teaming up with Dak Prescott. With his powerful running style and Dallas’ solid offensive line, Henry could have brought a whole new level of strength to the offense. His ability to break tackles and wear down defenses seemed like the perfect fit for a team looking to boost its rushing attack. But despite all the excitement and speculation, the Cowboys stuck to their usual cautious approach to building the roster. Instead of making a big move for Henry, they decided to stay the course—meaning the star running back never got the call.Now, he’s set to be a major difference-maker for the Ravens, strengthening their already powerful running game alongside his new teammates. With his size, speed, and experience, he adds another level of dominance to Baltimore’s offense, making them an even bigger threat. Meanwhile, Cowboys fans may be left wondering what could have been, regretting the missed chance to have him in their backfield. But for Ravens fans, this move is cause for celebration. Henry isn’t just switching teams—he’s fully embracing Baltimore’s Super Bowl dreams, bringing his unstoppable energy and determination to help them compete at the highest level.Also read - Cam Heyward says he ""Stole"" DK Metcalf from the Chargers, did he cross the line?","Derrick Henry sold his Dallas home for $1.6 million, falling short of its original asking price.

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce continue to be one of the most popular couples in the NFL. While the recent events at Super Bowl 2025 might have made them lowkey, they are still very much in love with one another.

President Donald Trump had said, “I wish the best for both of them. I hope they enjoy their life, maybe together, maybe not — most likely not.”Two years later, while Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have continued to be together, President Donald Trump’s feud with Swift has also continued and gotten worse.The billionaire pop star Taylor Swift has publicly spoken about not supporting Donald Trump. A few months before the 2025 elections, Taylor Swift had publicly supported Kamala Harris when Harris debated with Donald Trump.However, Donald Trump has not held back. He had posted on his Truth Social handle about his feelings for Taylor Swift when she got booed at the Super Bowl 2025, which he was also attending.Donald Trump’s post on his Truth Social handle read as, ""The only one that had a tougher night than the Kansas City Chiefs was Taylor Swift. She got BOOED out of the Stadium. MAGA is very unforgiving!""Recently, in an interview with OutKick, Donald Trump spoke about inviting the Kansas City Chiefs to the White House since, due to COVID-19, the team could not make their visit to the White House after they won the Super Bowl in 2020.Donald Trump said, “I look forward to having the (Philadelphia) Eagles (for winning Super Bowl LIX in February). And one other thing, we’re going to have the Kansas City Chiefs after that, because they missed their turn because of Covid.”While it is not known how Taylor Swift will react to accepting her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, visiting the White House when she has been trolled multiple times by President Donald Trump, it remains interesting to see how it changes the couple’s equation or if it will even have an effect on them.Currently, fans are waiting for Taylor Swift to announce the date for the release of her new album while Travis Kelce has not yet confirmed if he would be retiring this season.Also Read: ""He looks pissed"": Travis Kelce’s solo outing raises questions about his mood amid Taylor Swift romance",President Donald Trump had predicted Taylor Swift’s breakup with Travis Kelce in 2023.

Jayson Tatum reacted to his nickname ‘The Anomaly’ while speaking with Travis Kelce and Jason Kelce



Where did Jayson Tatum’s nickname come from?



Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum ’s reaction to a particular nickname has sparked plenty of discussion among fans and media alike. Tatum, who has been a star player for the Celtics, recently addressed the growing trend of people calling him ‘ The Anomaly ’ during his chat with NFL star siblings Travis Kelce and Jason Kelce in a new episode a their New Heights podcast .During a guest appearance on the New Heights podcast hosted by NFL stars Travis and Jason Kelce, Jayson Tatum was asked about the nickname that has been making rounds on social media. Travis Kelce, referring to Tatum’s Wikipedia page, brought up the moniker and asked, “Has anybody that is close to you ever actually called you, ‘The Anomaly’?”Tatum was amused. He responded with a candid answer that sent the Kelce brothers into fits of laughter. “Twitter is not a real place, I’ll say that,” Tatum hared. His reaction made it clear that he wasn’t exactly embracing the nickname, despite its growing popularity.Jason Kelce, however, had a different take. “I would run with that one. I like it. ‘The Anomaly’ is a good one. I don’t know who came up with that.” To which Travis Kelce agreed, saying, “It is a banger.”The origins of ‘The Anomaly’ trace back to social media, where an X user first suggested it, pointing out Tatum’s unique skill set. “Handles like someone 6 inches shorter, shoots pull-ups like a guard, finishes at the rim like a center, and consistently defends 1-5.”The nickname got wide attention, and soon, even official team accounts like the Portland Trail Blazers started using it in their game promotions. Basketball Reference has even added it to Tatum’s list of nicknames.Previously, when asked directly if he liked the name, he hesitated before admitting, “Ahhh, I don’t know.” He went on to mention that friends and teammates call him by other names, such as ‘Big Deuce’ and ‘Taco.’Also Read: Jayson Tatum's injury report (March 26, 2025): Is the Boston Celtics star fit to play against the Phoenix Suns tonight?

After being outclassed in their previous matches, title holders Kolkata Knight Riders and Rajasthan Royals are looking for a quick turnaround when they meet in an IPL match today (March 26).The Knight Riders lost to Royal Challengers Bengaluru by seven wickets in their opener, while the Royals suffered a 44-run defeat against Sunrisers Hyderabad.Both teams share a common issue: their once-impressive batting and bowling units have failed to perform. While the Royals might attribute their bowling struggles to playing at a difficult Hyderabad venue, the Knight Riders lack such an excuse.Except for Sunil Narine, none of the KKR bowlers managed to restrain the aggressive RCB lineup, raising concerns about the effectiveness of mystery spinner Varun Chakravarthy, who struggled significantly. Even on Eden Gardens' pitch, which had some grip, Chakravarthy was hit hard by Phil Salt and Virat Kohli.The KKR camp is hopeful that Chakravarthy will regain his form on a Guwahati pitch that typically offers more assistance to bowlers.The Barsapara Cricket Stadium in Guwahati has hosted four matches in IPL history - two in 2023 and two in 2024. The highest total at this ground came courtesy Rajasthan Royals who scored 199 against Delhi Capitals.

RCB posted a competitive 196/7, with Rajat Patidar leading the charge with a fortuitous 51 runs off 32 balls, supported by Tim David’s late blitz (22* off 8 balls).Despite early fireworks from Phil Salt (32 off 16 balls) and Devdutt Padikkal (27 off 14 balls), RCB struggled in the middle overs, but Patidar’s knock and David’s late hitting propelled them to a solid total.CSK’s chase never gained momentum as they crumbled to 146/8, with key wickets falling early. Josh Hazlewood was the standout performer with the ball, claiming 3/21, including the vital scalps of Rahul Tripathi and Ruturaj Gaikwad, reducing CSK to 8/3 within the first two overs.Bhuvneshwar Kumar (1/20) also contributed, dismissing Deepak Hooda.Though Rachin Ravindra (41 off 31 balls) and Sam Curran (8) tried to stabilize, the required run rate surged, and wickets fell at regular intervals. Curran was dismissed by Liam Livingstone, and Ravindra was bowled out by Yash Dayal (2/18), who also removed Shivam Dube (19).CSK’s decision to send Ravichandran Ashwin instead of MS Dhoni at this stage signaled their lack of fight. Dhoni’s 30* off 16 balls, including 2 sixes, was a mere consolation.RCB’s bowlers, including Livingstone and Dayal, tightened the screws, and an outstanding performance from Impact Sub Suyash Sharma (4-0-32-0) kept CSK under control.Patidar’s fortunate fifty and Hazlewood's destructive spell were key to RCB’s historic win, marking a rare defeat for CSK at home and a memorable victory for RCB.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) ended a 17-year winless streak at Chepauk with a dominant 50-run victory over Chennai Super Kings (CSK) RCB posted a competitive 196/7, with Rajat Patidar leading the charge with a fortuitous 51 runs off 32 balls, supported by Tim David’s late blitz.

NEW DELHI: At 43, Mahendra Singh Dhoni continues to showcase why he is one of the greatest wicketkeepers in cricket history.

As he momentarily lifted his back foot while trying to regain balance, Dhoni — faster than a blink — whipped off the bails in a flash.The decision was sent upstairs, and replays confirmed what everyone suspected — Salt's foot was in the air when Dhoni executed the dismissal. The MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai erupted as yet another Dhoni masterclass was added to his long list of iconic stumpings.This moment echoed Dhoni's brilliance from CSK's season opener against Mumbai Indians, where he had stunned Suryakumar Yadav with an equally breathtaking stumping. The 43-year-old legend, despite his age, continues to outshine younger wicketkeepers with his unmatched agility and sharp cricketing brain.With every such moment, Dhoni reinforces his status as a generational wicketkeeping genius, proving that in his case, age is just a number.","MS Dhoni's incredible reflexes behind the stumps cut short Phil Salt's blazing innings, leaving fans in awe.

The much-anticipated return of Hardik Pandya from a one-match ban is expected to inject much-needed balance into the Mumbai Indians ' lineup as they face an equally determined Gujarat Titans on Saturday. Both teams are searching for their first victory of the IPL season after disappointing opening matches.Mumbai Indians' perennial opening-game jinx continued with a four-wicket loss to Chennai Super Kings, while Gujarat Titans suffered an 11-run defeat at the hands of Punjab Kings in a high-scoring thriller.The week-long break between games allowed Mumbai Indians to regroup and engage in team bonding activities at Reliance's Jamnagar facility. However, the absence of Jasprit Bumrah and Hardik Pandya in the opener exposed vulnerabilities in their bowling and lower-order batting.Gujarat Titans' bowling attack, heavily reliant on Kagiso Rabada and Rashid Khan, will face a stern test against a potent Mumbai batting lineup. The lack of experienced Indian pacers and Mohammed Siraj’s vulnerability add to their concerns.The batting-friendly conditions at Ahmedabad’s Narendra Modi Stadium, which witnessed a combined total of 475 runs in the opening game, will be a welcome change for Mumbai’s batsmen after the sluggish Chepauk track. The boundaries are 64m and 66m on the sides, and the pitch looks excellent for batting. The grass covering is not expected to be a major factor. A score of 200 has been achieved 10 times in 17 matches at this venue.

“No hard feelings” Former WWE star ready for a comeback?

A former WWE NXT star might have hinted at his willingness to step inside the WWE ring. Despite the unwilling departure from the company in July last year, Damon Kemp recently insisted that there are “no hard feelings” for what happened in the past and is ready to enter the wrestling scene again. With the opportunities and chances of comebacks higher than ever, this could be the next huge return that might play out in the upcoming days, as the days left for WrestleMania 41 aren’t many.The brother of Olympic gold medalist and pro wrestler Gable Stevenson , Bobby Stevenson was a part of the company from 2021 to 2024. After it was decided that Kemp’s presence wasn’t impactful enough to hold a crowd, the company decided on not renewing the contract, thus resulting in his release in 2024.Recently speaking on the I Love Wrestling Podcast , he was asked if he held back any bitter feelings for WWE after his unexpected release. He stated, “I mean, if WWE called back, like I said before, I’d go back for sure. I don’t think I burned any bridges there. Never had issues, never back-talked. I felt like it was just one of those things; once my brother got let go, I don’t know if it was one of those things they wanted to stab the knife a little deeper in him and get me too as collateral damage.”Reflecting on the past he stated, “Like I said, if my wrestling was bad or my acting was bad or my character work was bad, I wouldn’t have been on TV as much as I was, and I wouldn’t be in the video game two years in a row. So obviously, I was doing my part. It’s one of those things… I talked to the person about it too; he was like, ‘Yeah, I kind of knew it was going to happen.’ I was like, ‘Yeah, I kind of knew too.’ Just the extra, let’s stab the knife even deeper and let’s get his brother too.”Kemp also underlined the openness to explore possibilities with AEW and TNA wrestling as well: “But if the opportunity does come for an AEW or TNA or even WWE again, I enjoyed it; there’s no hard feelings. Yeah, it sucked, but like I said, it’s an entertainment business. The show’s not going to stop if one person’s gone. It just keeps rolling.”There might be speculations regarding a lot of comebacks among fans, but it is hard to predict what WWE’s creative team has up their sleeve as the atmosphere is further intensifying with grand events approaching.Also Read: 5 WWE superstars with rich family background",Damon Kemp was released from WWE in July last year.

Paige Bueckers’ return to dominance: Why her hype is missing

Caitlin Clark vs. Paige Bueckers: Their two March Madness battles, relived

Paige Bueckers addresses media bias and the price of speaking out

The Guardian

Paige Bueckers deserves more recognition for her remarkable comeback

Paige Bueckers has been one of the most electrifying talents in college basketball for years. As a standout for the UConn Huskies and a projected No. 1 pick in the upcoming WNBA draft, her skill set speaks for itself. Yet, Bueckers’ impact reaches far beyond her on-court prowess. She has leveraged her platform to advocate for meaningful change in the sport, emphasizing the need to uplift all players rather than focusing solely on individual stardom. For her, leadership is not only about winning games but shaping the future of women’s basketball. Paige Bueckers has always been aware of the power of attention in sports. She recognizes that individual stardom can only go so far in growing the game and has long advocated for a more inclusive spotlight.“Everybody was focused on me my freshman year,” Bueckers said during the NCAA Tournament. “But it’s more important to grow the game by sharing the spotlight... and showing all the stars of college basketball.”Even with that mindset, her return to dominance has been impossible to ignore. But here’s the thing—her name isn’t everywhere like it used to be. The question is, why?Bueckers’ journey hasn’t been easy. A torn ACL in 2022 wiped out an entire season, adding to earlier injury struggles. People questioned if she’d ever be the same player again.She didn’t just return—she came back better. She’s the only player across the NBA, WNBA, and college basketball with a 50/40/90 shooting split this season. She’s putting up nearly 20 points a game, leading the conference in assists, and making UConn a serious title contender. And yet, despite all that, she’s not generating the same media frenzy Caitlin Clark did last year.While Bueckers’ performance has been remarkable, a deeper look into her media coverage reveals why her stellar comeback hasn’t garnered the attention it deserves. Bueckers has never been afraid to speak out, and that might explain some of it. When she won College Athlete of the Year at the 2021 ESPYs, Bueckers used her platform to address the underrepresentation of Black women in sports.“With the light that I have now as a white woman leading a Black-led sport, I want to shed light on Black women,” she said. “They don’t get the media coverage they deserve. Their value is undeniable.”She wasn’t wrong. Black athletes have long dominated the WNBA’s biggest awards but don’t always get the same mainstream attention. Bueckers named Maria Taylor, Robin Roberts , Maya Moore, and others, calling for a shift in how Black women in sports are covered.It was a bold move—and one that may have changed how certain audiences viewed her. Former NBA player Etan Thomas put it bluntly in: “While Black America cheered Bueckers, mainstream white America—a demographic that once saw her as a ‘media darling’—wasn’t as loud about her anymore.”Race and media narratives have always shaped sports. The 2023 NCAA Championship was a perfect example—Angel Reese was criticized for her confidence, while Caitlin Clark was celebrated for the same fire. It’s a pattern that’s been around forever, but women’s basketball is just now seeing it play out on a bigger stage.Unlike Clark, Bueckers isn’t part of a rivalry that fuels constant headlines. She’s just an elite player who also happens to challenge the status quo. And in a world where athletes are often rewarded for staying quiet, maybe that’s why her comeback isn’t being celebrated the way it should be.Still, Bueckers keeps doing what she does.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

CSK in IPL 2025: Sixth title loading for Chennai Super Kings?

Chennai: There’s a new ‘No. 9’ in town. MS Dhoni has made a career out of being out of the box, but on Friday night at the MA Chidambaram Stadium, he seemed to be stretching things a bit too far.As wickets fell and CSK kept losing steam in their chase of 197, the fans got more and more impatient. They wanted to see their ‘Thala’ come out and take on the RCB bowlers, but the wait continued. It was only after Ravichandran Ashwin, not exactly a swashbuckler, got out in the 16th over that Dhoni walked in at No. 9, probably the lowest that he has batted in his 18-year IPL career.Not that he batted badly. The 16-ball 30* was an indicator that his ability to clear the boundary hasn’t exactly diminished. In fact, it was his late burst of 19 off Krunal Pandya that brought down the margin of defeat to 50. But then, what’s holding him back? Dhoni is apparently “fitter than what he was in the last two years,” when he was playing with a knee injury and a muscle tear, respectively. His wicketkeeping skills are only getting better — the stumping of Phil Salt on Friday was a piece of beauty — but there’s a strange reluctance to go up the order with the bat.Virender Sehwag was quite critical about his decision to bat No. 9. “What can you do? Even when he was playing for India, he didn’t care much for suggestions to go up the order. Now, it’s probably the fag end of his career, what can you expect?” Sehwag said in a post-match show.The CSK think-tank, though, has a different take on the issue. Captain Ruturaj Gaikwad was asked before the first game against Mumbai Indians if there will be a case for a promotion in the batting order for Dhoni. “MSD has been performing a specific role and he is doing that very well. It’s unlikely to change,” he said.What he meant was that Dhoni is still immensely dangerous at the business end of the innings, where his ability to clear the fence and the fear factor that he generates combine beautifully to bolster the CSK totals. Last year, in those short bursts, Dhoni was batting at a strike-rate of 220.54, and the CSK team wants that same impact this time too.Even though the legend has maintained his body well, there’s always that gnawing suspicion that too much running between the wickets may just lead to damage of the ageing body that has taken a lot of wear and tear. The IPL is a two-month journey, and the team wants him fully fit when things really get tight at the back-end.Don’t be surprised if CSK are only three down in the 15th over against Rajasthan Royals in Guwahati on Sunday and Dhoni comes out to bat. “Dhoni has done a good pre-season, working on his hitting and keeping skills,” coach Stephen Fleming said.",MS Dhoni came down to bat at No. 9 during Chennai Super Kings' loss against Royal Challengers Bengaluru in Chennai. It was probably the lowest that he has batted in his 18-year IPL career.

Vyshak Vijaykumar reveals how Shreyas Iyer and Arshdeep Singh backed his 'wide yorkers' plan

NEW DELHI: In a thrilling IPL encounter, Shardul Thakur 's impressive four-wicket haul and Nicholas Pooran 's sensational display of power-hitting guided Lucknow Super Giants ( LSG ) to a five-wicket victory over Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) on Thursday.Thakur's dream comeback continued as he returned with figures of 4/34, helping LSG restrict the formidable SRH batting lineup to 190/9.Pooran then took center stage, showcasing his 360-degree hitting prowess with a blistering 70 off just 26 deliveries, including six fours and six maximums. His partnership with Mitchell Marsh (52 off 31) yielded a match-winning 116 runs for the second wicket, propelling LSG to chase down the target in just 16.1 overs.Despite losing Aiden Markram early in their chase, LSG surged ahead thanks to the effortless hitting from Marsh and Pooran. Pooran, in particular, was at his attacking best, dealing primarily in sixes and clobbering Simarjeet and Abhishek Sharma for massive hits, mostly towards the square boundary.SRH found it challenging to contain Pooran as he didn't even spare Cummins, hitting him for two fours in his first over to reach 77/1 in the powerplay. Pooran brought up the fastest fifty of the season in just 18 balls with another colossal six over square leg off Adam Zampa's bowling.Cummins eventually trapped Pooran in front of the wickets in the ninth over, but Marsh took the onus upon himself and brought up his half-century off just 29 balls. Although LSG skipper Rishabh Pant (15 off 15) couldn't contribute much, Abdul Samad played an entertaining cameo to guide his side home.Earlier, after opting to bowl first, Shardul (4/34) provided LSG with a fiery start, removing Abishek Sharma and the previous match's centurion, Ishan Kishan, in consecutive balls in the third over. While Shardul sent Sharma packing with a short delivery, he dismissed Kishan caught behind off an innocuous delivery down the leg side.Travis Head (47 off 28), however, looked in ominous form as he took the attack to the opposition, using his brute power to deal in boundaries and sixes. Head was particularly brutal against Avesh Khan, hitting him for two sixes and one four to pick up 18 runs in the fourth over.Head was fortunate to receive two reprieves, but his luck eventually ran out when fast bowler Prince Yadav disturbed his timbers to claim his first IPL wicket.Henrich Klaasen (26 off 17) was run out in a bizarre fashion by Yadav off his own bowling, while young Aniket Verma played a 13-ball 36-run cameo that included five sixes before falling to leg-spinner Disvesh Rathi.SRH skipper Pat Cummins (18 off 4) hit three sixes off his first three balls before departing in style, contributing to SRH's competitive total of 190/9.",Lucknow Super Giants ( LSG) beat Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) by five wickets. Shardul Thakur (4/34) and Nicholas Pooran (70) guided LSG to victory.

GUWAHATI: With the current Indian Premier League (IPL) season witness to some high-scoring games in the opening week, Wednesday’s match at the ACA Stadium then looked like an aberration.The Barsapara track offered help for the tweakers as Kolkata Knight Riders spinners, Varun Chakravarthy and Moeen Ali , ran through hosts Rajasthan Royals’ middle order to choke the flow of runs to restrict them to 151.On the wicket, Ali said, “It was good one, had a bit of everything — swing, bit of seam, spun nicely but not massively, just enough spin. I played here in the England warmup games (ahead of 2023 ODI World Cup); it’s a very nice ground.”Ali added that it was good that the track offered something for the bowlers.“Some of the wickets are amazing. India is a great place to bat actually, and when the wickets are like this, you’re not going to get 300, you probably won’t even get 200. So it’s great to have these games in between those big ones,” said Ali.Ali combined well with Chakravarthy as the duo shared four wickets between them. The English allrounder had praise for his ‘mystery’ partner Chakravarthy.“I came on before him (seventh over), so my job was to bowl tight. I’m used to bowling with somebody who’s better and has more mystery. So I bowl as tight as I can and hopefully, that builds pressure for them to get wickets,” Ali said.“Varun’s a brilliant bowler who has improved so much over the last two-three years. It’s amazing to bowl with him.”",Kolkata Knight Riders restrict Rajasthan Royals to 151. Moeen Ali and Varun Chakravarthy take four wickets between them.

After serving a one-match suspension for an over-rate offence from Mumbai Indians ' (MI) concluding match of the 2024 Indian Premier League season, Hardik Pandya will be back to lead the five-time champions in their second match of this edition against Gujarat Titans in Ahmedabad on Saturday.Both MI and the 2022 champions Gujarat had lost their opening fixtures against Chennai Super Kings and Punjab Kings, respectively and are keen to put a win on the board for their first points.The MI squad utilised the extended break between their first and second matches by spending time at the Reliance facility in Jamnagar, where they participated in team-building exercises and relaxation activities.While the return of captain and all-rounder Hardik will come as a boost for MI, they will remain without the services of their premier fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah, who continues to recuperate from his back injury at the BCCI's Centre of Excellence on Bengaluru.Hardik's return to the playing eleven likely means Robin Minz's exclusion, although MI's batting performance on the tricky Chepauk pitch failed to generate confidence.The batting conditions in Ahmedabad on Saturday evening will prove more favourable, considering the substantial 475 runs scored in 40 overs during the first match of the season at the venue between Punjab Kings (243) and hosts Gujarat (232).But the batting-friendly surface at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad raises concerns about Mohammed Siraj's effectiveness, following his expensive spell of 54 runs in the previous match where Punjab batters dominated his bowling.With not many senior Indian pacers in the GT ranks, it will be a strategic call that home team head coach Ashish Nehra will fret upon. The pressure to contain runs as well as take wickets is way too much on Kagiso Rabada and Rashid Khan.Both the teams clearly had difficulties in finding the optimal blend of their overseas players.For MI, the challenges are further intensified due to Suryakumar Yadav's prolonged dip in performance over the past year, while Rohit Sharma also needs to rediscover his consistency.The addition of Pandya strengthens the batting lineup while offering bowling options, particularly at the start of the innings. His expertise in delivering wide yorkers during death overs.The Gujarat Titans' overall performance this season could heavily depend on captain Shubman Gill's batting form.The bowling department presents concerns for captain Gill, as the Indian pacers - Siraj, Prasidh Krishna and Ishant Sharma - predominantly employ similar hit-the-deck techniques. Apart from Rabada, the pace attack lacks variety in their bowling arsenal.","Hardik Pandya will lead Mumbai Indians against Gujarat Titans on Saturday.

Bombay Sports Exchange Episode 1: Interview with Sanjog Gupta, CEO (Sports) at JioStar

Former India players Manoj Tiwary and Virender Sehwag have raised concerns about Mumbai Indians' Rohit Sharma 's recent performance following another single-digit score. Mumbai Indians faced a 36-run defeat against Gujarat Titans, marking their second consecutive loss in IPL 2025.Rohit Sharma's IPL journey has been challenging lately. He was dismissed for a duck by Khaleel Ahmed in the opening match against CSK.Against Gujarat Titans, Rohit managed to hit two boundaries in the first three balls. However, Mohammed Siraj's precise delivery that swung back in dismissed him shortly after.In the past five IPL seasons, Rohit has crossed the 400-run mark only once. The Mumbaikar has had six single-digit scores in last nine IPL innings.Tiwary expressed concern about Rohit's inability to consistently achieve 600-700 runs per season.The situation is particularly notable following last year's controversial captaincy change. Hardik Pandya's appointment as captain in place of Rohit Sharma led to widespread fan disapproval, with crowds booing Pandya at various venues.""Look, I'm telling you, I don't want to be tough, but I must be. For some players, you have to be. Look, it's high time Rohit Sharma got back among the runs. The ability of a player like Rohit Sharma is not 400. Last season, he scored 400, he hit a century, that's fine. But where is the 800-900 season? Rohit is just not able to have these types of seasons. Why does Virat Kohli always score? You tell me. It's equally good. It's equally good, but there should be a season where Rohit scores 600-700,"" Manoj Tiwary told Cricbuzz.""He should take his orange cap with him. That's how it should be. How will it be if you don't get a good start? I expect a lot from him. That's why he was retained. Because of last year's drama and controversy, it felt like Rohit would leave because there were a lot of small audio clips. Despite that, he was retained. But since there were no runs in the last two matches, the atmosphere must have been mixed up,"" he added.Former India opener Sehwag also shared his thoughts on Rohit's performance. While acknowledging his admiration for Rohit, Sehwag suggested it might be too late to expect a 600-700 run season from him.""What Manoj Tiwary said about Rohit Sharma, where is that season? Isn't it too late for this type of season to come (laughs)? We are also his fans, but we are just asking where the season of 600-700 runs is. When has Rohit Sharma done that? It has been 18 years, when it has not happened in 18 years, how can you hope for this to happen now when he is at the last part of his career?"" asked Sehwag.Following their loss to Gujarat Titans, Mumbai Indians now stand at ninth position in the points table. Their next match is scheduled against the defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders at the Wankhede Stadium on Monday.","Rohit Sharma has had six single-digit scores in last nine IPL innings.
