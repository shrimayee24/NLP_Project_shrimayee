Man of The Moment

NEW DELHI: Where dreams are woven with every delivery, Saurabh Netravalkar etched his name in history with a spellbinding performance that propelled Team USA to a stunning victory over former champions Pakistan in Dallas in the ongoing T20 World Cup 2024.While defending 18 runs in the Super Over, the cricketer-turned-engineer Netravalkar defied all odds and shattered the expectations of hundreds and thousands of Pakistanis on Thursday.ALSO SEE: T20 World Cup Schedule In 2010, Netravalkar donned the Indian jersey at the U19 World Cup, where a young Babar's Pakistan dashed their hopes. The loss was a bitter pill.Fast forward 14 years, Netravalkar, now a cornerstone of the USA team, scripted a poetic reversal at the 2024 T20 World Cup. Bowling a sensational Super Over, he led the USA to a stunning victory over Babar's Pakistan.Born in Mumbai, India, Netravalkar's journey began with a love for the game that burned brighter than the city's neon lights.

Team USA, considered underdogs, rose to the occasion, matching Pakistan's score and forcing a nerve-wracking Super Over.It was in this crucible of pressure that Netravalkar's true mettle was forged. With the world watching, he delivered a sensational over, restricting Pakistan to a mere 13 runs for the loss of one wicket. The stage was set for the United States to etch their name in the annals of cricketing history, and Netravalkar's heroics paved the way for a famous victory.With every delivery, Netravalkar etches his name deeper into the pages of cricketing lore, proving that passion, perseverance and an unwavering spirit can conquer even the mightiest of foes.","Saurabh Netravalkar led Team USA to a stunning victory over former champions Pakistan in Dallas.

ICC

ADMITS NY PITCH IS 'INCONSISTENT'

NEW YORK: In all the euphoria of cricket coming to America, there now appears to be a cloud of doubt hanging over the most crucial component of the sport, the pitch. In two back-to-back games at the Nassau International Cricket Ground in New York - the venue for the high-profile India-Pakistan game on Sunday - teams have been bowled out for less than 100 and the chases haven't been easy.Sri Lanka were dismissed for 77 and it took South Africa 16.4 overs to get over the line. The Indian top-order also struggled to chase 97 against Ireland on Wednesday. While the Irish looked like fish out of water while batting, Rohit Sharma , Virat Kohli and Rishabh Pant too had to struggle before India opened their account.What's more crucial is the fact that the winner of the toss is calling the shots. In addition to the up-and-down nature of the pitch, the 10:30 am starts have meant the white ball is moving around so much that batting is looking really hard at the moment.""Yes, the toss is crucial and fortunately we won the toss today (against Ireland). It allowed us to control the game,"" batting coach Vikram Rathour said. But it didn't take too long for the discussion to veer towards the India-Pakistan match and when he was asked what would be a par score batting first, Rathour merely said: ""Whatever we can get"".Former India spinner Harbhajan Singh , who is doing commentary here, too sounded concerned. ""The worrying bit is one delivery is shooting up, one is keeping a bit down. Anything can happen on a track like this,"" Harbhajan told TOI.The one man who had to deal fire with fire was skipper Rohit. Despite a shaky start, he held on to score 52 before being hit by a ball that rose up to hit his shoulder. The captain retired hurt, though he later clarified that ""it's just a little sore"" and there's no concern about his participation in the Pakistan game.""It's just a little sore (the arm). Quite unsure of what to expect from the pitch. Not aware on what it is to play like on a pitch that's five months old,"" Rohit said. ""I don't think the wicket settled down even when we batted second. There was enough for the bowlers.""Rohit has played enough cricket to know that the decibels will increase manifold when it's Pakistan and any adverse result will add to the noise. ""I don't know what to expect from the pitch to be honest, but we will prepare as if the conditions are going to be like this,"" the skipper said.Rathour, on the other hand, is banking on the quality of India's batting lineup to deal with whatever challenges that come their way. ""It is a challenging wicket and have to find ways. We have the skill and experience, there are players who know how to deal with these conditions,"" he said.The International Cricket Council admitted on Thursday that the pitch in New York has not played satisfactorily and that the groundstaff is working hard to salvage the situation ahead of the big India-Pakistan game on Sunday. ""T20 Inc and the ICC recognise that the pitches used so far at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium have not played as consistently as we would all have wanted,"" ICC said in the statement.""The world-class grounds team has been working hard since the conclusion of yesterday's game to remedy the situation and deliver the best possible surfaces for the remaining matches.""","Two back-to-back games at the Nassau International Cricket Ground in New York have seen teams bowled out for less than 100.

NEW DELHI: The United States enjoyed arguably the greatest day in their cricket history, stunning Pakistan with a Super Over victory at the T20 World Cup in Dallas on Thursday.Both teams scored 159 in their regulation 20 overs, leading to a Super Over in this Group A match held at Grand Prairie, near Dallas, Texas. The United States set Pakistan a target of 19 runs to win in the Super Over.India-born paceman Saurabh Netravalkar held his nerve as Pakistan, runners-up at the 2022 T20 World Cup and champions in 2009, managed only 13-1 in reply.Earlier, Pakistan was restricted to 159-7 after being sent into bat in their first match of the tournament, with Netravalkar delivering an economical spell of 2-18. The United States innings ended dramatically, with Nitish Kumar hitting a four off the last ball from Haris Rauf, bringing the score to 159-3.In the Super Over, Pakistan's Mohammad Amir bowled several wides, and panic fielding led to overthrows, helping the United States accumulate 18 runs. Netravalkar then dismissed Iftikhar Ahmed, brilliantly caught in the deep by Kumar, confirmed after a lengthy check by third umpire Paul Reiffel.With seven needed off the last ball, Shadab Khan couldn't manage the required six, sparking wild celebrations among the USA team and their home fans.This victory is a landmark result in modern American cricket, even considering their recent 2-1 ODI series win over Bangladesh. Pakistan now faces a quick turnaround before their next match against arch-rivals India in New York on Sunday.The United States were cruising at 104-1 in the 14th over but were reduced to 111-3 when India-born captain Monank Patel was caught behind off Amir for exactly 50. Earlier, left-arm spinner Nosthush Kenjige, who opened the bowling, took 3-30, including two wickets in two balls, from his four overs.Pakistan found themselves in trouble at 26-3 before a 72-run partnership between skipper Babar Azam (44) and Shadab Khan (40) bolstered their total. Mohammad Rizwan was caught one-handed at slip by Steven Taylor off Netravalkar, and Usman Khan holed out off Kenjige, leaving Pakistan at 14-2.Shadab and Azam Khan fell in successive balls to Kenjige, but tailender Shaheen Shah Afridi 's 23 not out gave Pakistan some hope, which ultimately proved insufficient.","United States stun Pakistan with Super Over victory at T20 World Cup in Dallas.

NEW DELHI: The Nassau County ground 's track has raised concerns during the ongoing T20 World Cup , with the ICC acknowledging on Thursday that the pitches used thus far have not played as consistently as we would have all wanted. The track is described as ""bordering on dangerous with huge open cracks"".These worries intensified following India's eight-wicket victory against Ireland in a low-scoring match, where Ireland was dismissed for just 96 runs in 16 overs.During the successful chase, India's captain Rohit Sharma , who scored a half-century, was struck on his right bicep by pacer Josh Little, forcing him to retire hurt. The ball that hit him suddenly took off from length on a pitch that provided a significant amount of uneven bounce. Rishabh Pant was also hit on his left elbow during his unbeaten 36.Apart from the injury scares, the nature of the pitch, a drop-in surface brought specifically from Adelaide for the World Cup, has raised questions. India are scheduled to play two more matches at this stadium.Several former players, including Irfan Pathan , Michael Vaughan , and Sanjay Manjrekar, have deemed the track unsuitable for T20 cricket, especially when the event is being promoted as cricket's entry into the untapped American market.""T20 Inc and the ICC recognise that the pitches used so far at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium have not played as consistently as we would have all wanted,"" the ICC said in a statement.""The world-class grounds team have been working hard since the conclusion of yesterday's game to remedy the situation and deliver the best possible surfaces for the remaining matches,"" it added.Rohit is anticipated to recover from his injury in time for the highly anticipated match against Pakistan, scheduled for Sunday.""Rohit's injury isn't serious. He himself said that it's a bit sore. He should be okay for Pakistan game (on Sunday) as of now. There are two practice sessions before that,"" a senior BCCI source told PTI on conditions of anonymity.Pathan, a key member of India's victorious 2007 T20 World Cup squad, expressed his strong disapproval of the pitch, calling it unsafe.""Look, we definitely want to promote cricket in America, but this pitch is not safe for players. If we had a pitch like this in India, a match would never be played there again for a very long time,"" he said on Star Sports.""This pitch is definitely not good. I mean, we are talking about the World Cup here, not even a bilateral series,"" he asserted.Also unimpressed was former England captain Vaughan.""Trying to sell the game in the states is great.. love it.. but for players to have to play on this sub-standard surface in New York is unacceptable… You work so hard to make it to the WC then have to play on this,"" he wrote on his X handle.Rohit expressed his confusion regarding the pitch's nature and admitted his uncertainty about how it would play during the match against Pakistan. The team's batting coach, Vikram Rathour, was slightly more reserved in his assessment of the track.""It is a challenging wicket as far as batting is concerned but this is what we have. So we need to find ways to deal with that,"" Rathour said in the post-match press conference, placing the onus on his team to find ways to score.The Indian team management is unlikely to file any official complaint. But the displeasure is clear about the nature of the track, which according to some who saw, is ""unfit for T20 cricket"" and ""bordering on dangerous"".""It is actually a very fresh pitch. There is a grass cover but along with it are big cracks. So, it will seam but also take off from length. Now when you have a fresh track like this, you first try out a few games like you do with beta testing of a new app,"" the source explained.""Then you release it in the market. It is not a T20 wicket and all four tracks look the same,"" said another source after a first-hand look at the track following the match.The uneven surface might benefit from a roller to smooth out the cracks, but it's common knowledge that such pitches require time to become suitable for batting.The Indian pace attack made light work of a highly skilled T20 team like Ireland. However, even Arshdeep Singh 's most ardent admirers couldn't have predicted that his deliveries would soar like surface to air missiles.""One should be glad that nothing serious happened to Rohit and Rishabh (Pant). They are fine,"" the source added.Ireland's Harry Tector faced a frightening delivery from Jasprit Bumrah during the match. The ball struck Tector's gloves before making direct contact with his helmet, resulting in Virat Kohli securing the catch. As per protocol, Tector was required to undergo a mandatory concussion assessment following the incident.The ICC has well-defined regulations regarding the quality of pitches used in tournaments. The evaluation process takes place only after the conclusion of the event. If a pitch is deemed to be below the required standards, its overall rating will be reduced accordingly.Andy Flower, the former captain of Zimbabwe and a highly respected coach, joined others in voicing his disapproval of the pitch conditions.""I have got to say that is not a good surface to play an international match on. It's bordering on dangerous,"" Flower said on 'ESPNcricinfo's Timeout' show.Former India batter Sanjay Manjrekar feels the pitch is under-prepared.""You have seen dangerous pitches before as well at the international level but something has gone wrong with the preparation where either the pitch has been under-prepared or something that is beyond their control,"" Manjrekar said.","ICC acknowledges that the pitches used so far have not played as consistently as we would have all wanted.

NEW DELHI: Captain Richie Berrington 's unbeaten 47 guided Scotland to a five-wicket victory over Namibia in their T20 Cricket World Cup Group B game in Barbados on Thursday.After being thwarted by the weather in their opening fixture two days earlier at the same venue, Berrington's commanding knock of 47 off 36 balls (two fours, three sixes), alongside timely support from Michael Leask (35 off 17 balls, four sixes), steered Scotland to a winning total of 157 for five with nine balls to spare.Their combined effort in a fifth-wicket partnership of 74 rendered Gerhard Erasmus ' all-round contribution ineffective. The Namibian captain had top-scored with 52 in Namibia's total of 155 for nine and also took two for 29 off four overs, causing Scotland to wobble at 73 for four in the 11th over.Erasmus's innings of 52 off 31 balls (five fours, two sixes) had earlier helped his team recover to a competitive total after they struggled at 19 for 2 early on, having opted to bat. Erasmus was eventually stumped off the bowling of off-spinner Michael Leask.Scotland's win was also due to the efforts of seam bowlers Brad Wheal and Brad Currie, who pulled Namibia back from a total that seemed destined to reach closer to 170, especially with David Wiese, their super over hero from the opening match victory over Oman, at the crease.Wheal, who dismissed JP Kotze in the first over of the match, returned to take out Wiese and wicketkeeper-batsman Zane Green (28), finishing with impressive figures of three for 33.Currie (two for 16), who opened the bowling with Wheal, was also effective at the end, ensuring the Namibians were kept in check as four wickets fell in the final two overs.",Scotland beat Namibia by five wickets in their T20 Cricket World Cup Group B game.

NEW DELHI: India's 2026 FIFA World Cup Qualifier against Kuwait ended in a disappointing goalless draw, failing to provide a fitting farewell for the talismanic Sunil Chhetri in his last international match.The result leaves India in a challenging position to progress to the third round of the qualifiers, with only five points collected so far. India's final match is against Asian champions Qatar on June 11, while Kuwait, with four points, will face Afghanistan on the same day.Chhetri's international career spans an impressive 19 years, during which he scored 94 goals, making him the fourth most prolific scorer in international football, behind Portugal superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (128), Iran legend Ali Daei (108) and Argentine wizard Lionel Messi (106).This remarkable achievement is particularly noteworthy for a player from a country like India, and FIFA recognised Chhetri's legendary status upon his announcement of international retirement on May 16.Kolkata's Salt Lake Stadium, with a capacity of 68,000, was packed with fans, officials, and former players who came to bid an emotional adieu to Chhetri.His parents, Kharga and Sushila, and wife, Sonam Bhattacharya, were also in attendance.

The first half was action-packed, with both teams creating chances but failing to find the back of the net.The crowd remained engaged, chanting ""Sunil, Sunil"" and ""Vande Mataram"" throughout the match.Kuwait's best chance in the first half came in the fourth minute when Eid Al-Rashidi set up Daham with a perfect through ball. However, Indian goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu made a crucial save to deny Mohammad Daham.India responded in the 11th minute with Liston Colaco's low cross, but Hasan Alanezi's sliding clearance prevented Chhetri from scoring his 95th goal.Debutant Jay Gupta was involved in the action, delivering a sublime low cross from the left in the 25th minute, but the Kuwait defense cleared it for a corner. India failed to capitalize on a freekick in the 28th minute, despite Poojary's impressive run and nutmeg.At the halfway mark, Thapa sent a fantastic ball into the box, which Kuwait cleared to deny Sahal Abdul Samad. The rebound fell to Liston Colaco, who fired a low strike into the side netting from a narrow angle.In the second half, Igor Stimac made changes to India's attacking lineup, introducing Rahim Ali, Brandon Fernandes, and Chheri. However, the desired result was not achieved, as Rahim failed to convert his chances.Kuwait's frustration peaked in the 74th minute when they were denied a penalty claim, leading to a confrontation between players and bench.Replays suggested a foul, but the referee deemed otherwise. Tempers flared up after a challenge on Indian debutant Edmund, resulting in a mini-brawl and yellow cards for both Edmund and Sultan Alenezi.Despite the tension, Edmund rallied the crowd's support with a free-kick opportunity, but Brandon Fernandes' poor delivery meant India's last hope for a win disappeared in the added seven minutes.Stimac handed left-back Gupta his international debut in a 4-2-3-1 formation, with Chhetri as the sole striker.

However, Lalpekhlua's promising career was derailed by recurrent knee issues, highlighting the unpredictable challenges athletes may face.""I had tried my best when I was young. I worked extremely hard to emulate his (Chhetri's) game, but injuries held me back, disappointing Indian football fans who had high expectations from me. I hope the future brings young players who can fill in his boots,"" he told PTI from Aizawl.""Managing injuries is crucial. In 2011, when I first played, the coach liked me, there were some minor injuries but I would never take them seriously,"" said the 33-year-old.""But if you want to play for a longer period, you need to be careful and never take risks.

Gauff, who was reduced to tears by the incident, lost the point, but won the game. She, however, couldn’t quite get going thereafter.The American justifiably reopened the debate of an appeal system that left no room for human error.“I think tennis is the only sport where not only we don't have the VR system, but a lot of times the decisions are made by one person,” said Gauff, who’ll move to No.2 in the rankings on Monday. “In other sports there's usually multiple refs in making a decision. I know the US Open brought some of it last year. I know we used it in our doubles at one point.”“It's almost ridiculous that we don't have it (in tennis). Not just speaking because of what happened to me, but I just think every sport has it,” she said. “Also, it sucks as a player to go back or online and you see that you were completely right.“In situations where you can call for the supervisor, there's not much they can do. I definitely think as a sport we have to evolve, and we have the technology. They're showing it on TV, so I don't get why the player can't see it.”In the final on Saturday, Swiatek, whose play is strung perfectly for this surface, will play the surprise package in Jasmine Paolini .The 12th-seeded Italian, whose ranking will now climb to No.7 on account of making the final here, beat the 17-year-old Russian Mirra Andreeva 6-3, 6-1 in the second semifinal.","Iga Swiatek beat Coco Gauff 6-2, 6-4 in the French Open semifinal.

PARIS: After falling short in their first two meetings of the year against the world No.2 pairing of India's Rohan Bopanna and Aussie Matthew Ebden , the all-Italian combine of Simone Bolelli and Andrea Vavassori , found a way in their next outing in Rome.

The 11th-seeds, playing sharp tennis under a weak Paris sun, managed to replicate that effort in the Roland Garros semifinals on Thursday.

Bopanna and Ebden, who have struck consistent notes in the majors, making at least the semifinals of their last four Grand Slams, went down 5-7, 6-2, 2-6 in a shade under two-hours.

Bopanna and Ebden struck first in the fourth game of the match, Bopanna's forehand crosscourt opening up the court, giving the second seeds a chance to break. They made no mistake on the next point. The Italians hit back in the seventh game, before gaining the decisive break in the 11th.

Bopanna and Ebden, who had beaten Bolelli and Vavassori in the title round of the Australian Open in January, were broken early in the deciding third set and the Italians did well to steer clear of trouble, with Bopanna and Ebden winning just 19 points in the third set.

Bolelli and Vavassori, Italy's Olympic pairing, are in their second successive major final.

I lost against her one month ago so I was like, come on you have to do better, today I was nervous in the first set but then ball after ball I was getting relaxed,"" said the 12th seeded Paolini after the win.""I learned I think a little bit later than other players maybe, to dream is I think the most important thing in sport and in life, I'm happy that I could dream this moment and I don't know what to say, I'm so emotional,"" added the tennis star.Her perseverance and dedication have culminated in this career-defining moment.

NEW DELHI: Alexander Zverev has secured his place in the semi-finals of the French Open for the fourth consecutive year, defeating Australian 11th seed Alex de Minaur 6-4, 7-6 (7/5), 6-4 on Wednesday. The German fourth seed showcased his resilience and tactical prowess, wrapping up the match in under three hours.

Zverev will face Norwegian Casper Ruud for a place in Sunday’s final. Ruud advanced to the semi-finals after receiving a walkover due to Novak Djokovic 's injury withdrawal. Riding high on an 11-match winning streak, including a recent title at the Rome Masters , Zverev aims to reach his first final at Roland Garros .

""I'm happy to be in another semi-final. Hopefully I can win one,"" said Zverev, reflecting on his achievement. He highlighted his preparedness, attributing his stamina to rigorous offseason work. ""Everybody in the press keeps asking me what I do for recovery and the answer is very simple -- you don't recover after matches, you recover in the off-season.""

The match against de Minaur featured pivotal moments, especially in the second set. Zverev saved a set point at 5-6 and clinched a crucial 39-shot rally during the tie-break, ultimately sealing the set at the first opportunity. ""I have the mindset you have to work harder than everyone else to be the best player. I like to work to my absolute limit. If I do that then playing five sets all of a sudden is not that difficult,"" Zverev remarked.

De Minaur, despite the loss, praised his own efforts and acknowledged the challenge posed by Zverev. ""I'm extremely proud of my efforts through the two weeks. Even today I think I put up a hell of a fight in difficult conditions against a quality opponent,"" he said. The Australian rued missing a key opportunity in the second set tie-break, which could have altered the match's trajectory.

Zverev's semi-final run comes amid the backdrop of an ongoing trial in Berlin over allegations of assault, but he remains focused on his tennis ambitions. He hopes to overcome the hurdles that previously thwarted his quest for a French Open final, including a serious ankle injury against Rafael Nadal in 2022 and a five-set loss to Stefanos Tsitsipas in 2021.
