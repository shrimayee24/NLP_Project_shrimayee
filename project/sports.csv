Theare facing uncertainty as they prepare for their Tuesday night showdown against the Houston Rockets , with star point guarddue to an adductor injury. The game is set to tip off at 7:30 PM ET at State Farm Arena in Atlanta, Georgia, and the Hawks will need every edge to take on a surging Rockets squad currently boasting a 31-14 record. Trae Young ‚Äôs status has been a matter of significant concern, as the 24-year-old has been the heart of Atlanta‚Äôs offense this season. Averaging 22.8 points per game, Young is ranked 24th in the league in scoring and remains a strong playmaker with 8.9 assists per game. His ability to control the Atlanta Hawks‚Äô offensive rhythm will be sorely missed if he is unable to play. The team, sitting at 22-24, has already struggled to maintain consistency this season, and Young‚Äôs absence could further hamper their efforts to climb the Eastern Conference standings.In addition to Trae Young, Atlanta‚Äôs injury list includes key contributors like Kobe Bufkin (out for the season with a shoulder injury) and Cody Zeller (personal reasons), along with day-to-day players Dyson Daniels (ankle), Larry Nance Jr. (hand), and Jalen Johnson (shoulder). This growing list of injuries poses a daunting challenge for the Atlanta Hawks, who are already allowing 118.5 points per game, ranking them 27th in the league for defensive efficiency.Houston, on the other hand, enters the matchup with strong momentum, led by standout performances from Jalen Green and Alperen Sengun. The Rockets excel in defense, allowing just 108.4 points per game, and lead the league in rebounding with 48.2 boards per game. Atlanta‚Äôs defensive struggles could make them vulnerable against a team that thrives on second-chance opportunities.Trae Young‚Äôs potential absence also impacts Atlanta‚Äôs perimeter game, as he ranks 23rd in the NBA with 2.9 three-pointers made per game. Without his shooting threat, the Atlanta Hawks could face challenges in keeping up with Houston‚Äôs pace and scoring depth.Also read: Will Anthony Davis play tonight against the Philadelphia 76ers?

NEW DELHI: Following a rest day in Wijk aan Zee on Monday, the 2025 Tata Steel Chess Tournament returned with a bang as Gukesh Dommaraju of India became the sole leader in the Masters standings after defeating compatriot Leon Luke Mendonca in a 43-move game on Tuesday.Mendonca, who qualified for the Masters this time by winning the Challengers title in the 86th edition of the Tata Steel Chess Tournament last year, had a challenging task ahead, defending with the black pieces against the current World Chess Champion.Almost two months older than Gukesh, Leon has struggled with health issues during this tournament. Earlier, he also visited the doctor prior to his Round 3 match against Pentala Harikrishna.On Tuesday, he chose the Morphy Defense in a game that began with the Ruy L√≥pez Opening. After Gukesh castled on the fifth move, Mendonca responded aggressively by pushing his pawns in the Columbus Variation.However, Gukesh opted to maintain his piece structure, and the first capture occurred when he sacrificed his opponent's knight with Bxe3 on move 15.The game remained evenly balanced up until move 30. However, on move 31, Mendonca's Bc8 marked his first misstep. Another mistake came on move 32 with Rd8, and a third error, Bd7 on move 39, gave Gukesh a decisive advantage as he used his queen to dominate Mendonca's central position.By the 43rd move, with Gukesh playing Rf2, Mendonca, sensing there was no escape, resigned immediately.This victory propelled Gukesh to claim sole leadership in the Masters standings.

However, Giri, determined not to take his foot off the paddle, handed the Indian GM his first loss of the tournament in Wijk aan Zee on Tuesday.The game started with a Catalan Opening, during which Praggnanandhaa initially advanced his rook before retreating and pushing his pawns.His first significant mistake came on move 17 when he pushed his pawn to e5. As pieces, including queens, were traded off and the complexity of the game began to evade, Pragg played Rd8.Since losing his opening game against Gukesh, Giri hadn‚Äôt lost another game on home soil. Capitalising on Praggnanandhaa's mistake was no challenge for the Dutchman, who expertly pinned the Indian GM to the left side of the board with some impressive moves.As the game entered the endgame, Praggnanandhaa finally accepted defeat on his 64th move and resigned.ALSO SEE: Tata Steel Chess 2025 Schedule In a morale-boosting result for Indian supporters, Arjun Erigaisi, who had been struggling for form, managed a commendable draw against defending Masters champion Wei Yi of China.

RAJKOT: First, the good news. Mohammed Shami made a decent, much-awaited return to international cricket after nearly 14 months, conceding 25 runs for no wickets in three overs and hitting a six towards the closing stages of the match. But it was Varun Chakravarthy who dominated the show, continuing to torment the Englishmen. The 'mystery spinner' took his maiden five-wicket haul in India (five for 24 in five overs).Now comes the bad news. Varun‚Äôs superb effort went in vain as India, batting poorly, were restricted by England‚Äôs much-improved bowlers to 146 for nine in 20 overs, losing by 26 runs to suffer their first defeat of the series in the third T20I at the Niranjan Shah Stadium here on Tuesday night.Given that the scoreline is 2-1 in favor of India now, England will look to equalise the score when they take on the hosts in the fourth T20I at Pune on Friday.Chasing 172, India lost wickets at regular intervals as England‚Äôs bowlers, led by Jamie Overton (3-23 in four overs), Jofra Archer (2-33), Brydon Carse (2-29), and leggie Adil Rashid (1-15 in four overs), who had earlier chipped in with a vital 10 not out, kept up the pressure.Enduring a poor series after smashing back-to-back centuries in South Africa, the inconsistent Sanju Samson (3) was caught at mid-on off Archer in the third over, while Abhishek Sharma (24, 14b, 5x4), who looked dangerous, was brilliantly caught by Archer, sprinting at cover, off Brydon Carse in the fourth over.India‚Äôs T20 skipper Suryakumar Yadav‚Äôs (14) poor run continued as he top-edged a pull off Mark Wood, with ‚Äòkeeper Phil Salt completing the catch, while the in-form Tilak Varma (17) was castled by a beauty of a leg-spinner from Rashid in the ninth over. Hardik Pandya (40, 35b, 1x4, 2x6) kept India in the game for a while, but was left throwing his bat in frustration after being caught by Overton at long-off.India‚Äôs strategy of playing four spinners in a T20 match backfired badly on the night. While Varun toyed with England‚Äôs batters, Bishnoi went for 1-46 in four overs, and off-spinner Washington Sundar, who was out for 6 batting at No 6, conceded 15 in the only over he bowled.Earlier, succumbing to Varun‚Äôs bag of tricks, England, who were flying at 83 for one in nine overs, with opener Ben Duckett (51, 28b, 7x4, 2x6) and skipper Jos Buttler (24, 22b, 1x4, 1x6) going great guns, lost nine wickets for 64 runs in a space of just 49 balls to slip to 147 for nine by the 18th over.Coming on to bowl in the sixth over, Varun gave away just three runs as both Duckett, who stroked his second T20I half-century, and Buttler looked to play him cautiously. However, once Buttler gloved a reverse sweep behind off the spinner, the floodgates opened.After Axar Patel had Duckett mistiming a hit to cow corner and Brook (8), who is enduring a horror run in this series, was bowled while under-edging a sweep off Bishnoi (his first wicket of the series), Varun began to slice through the England batting.Breathing fire, he was on a hat-trick in the 14th over as England‚Äôs ‚Äòkeeper-bat Jamie Smith (6) dragged him down to cow corner, while Jamie Overton (0) lost his leg stump while trying to paddle the bowler, going too far across.Brydon Carse (3) staved off the hat-trick, but perished soon, mistiming a sweep to give Tilak Varma a catch at deep square leg. Two balls later, Jofra Archer (0) was castled by a beauty that skidded off the pitch.Just as England were looking in danger of not even lasting for their full quota of 20 overs, the visitors‚Äô Nos 10 and 11, Adil Rashid (10 not out) and Mark Wood (10 not out), did extremely well to hold on for 17 balls, adding 24 crucial runs in a 10th-wicket partnership‚ÄîEngland‚Äôs joint-second best in T20Is‚Äîto take the score to 171 for nine in 20 overs.After Suryakumar won the toss for the third successive time and put England in, Liam Livingstone (43, 24b, 5x6, 1x6) launched a blistering counterattack, slog-sweeping and pulling Bishnoi for three sixes in the 17th over.With England‚Äôs batters failing to read him and making it worse for themselves by trying to play across the line to him, Varun has now taken 10 wickets for just 85 runs in the series so far, at an average of 8.50 and an economy rate of 7.08.The tweaker is the first bowler to take 10 wickets in a bilateral T20I series between India and England. Have India missed a trick by not picking the 33-year-old for the Champions Trophy next month, even considering questions around his fielding?Since his comeback after three years in the wilderness last year, Varun has taken 27 wickets in 10 matches at an average of 11.00 and a strike rate of 8.8 (per wicket).Earlier, India rested left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh, giving Shami some game time at last.","Varun Chakravarthy took his maiden five-wicket haul in India (five for 24 in five overs) India lost wickets at regular intervals as England‚Äôs bowlers, led by Jamie Overton, Jofra Archer, Brydon Carse and Adil Rashid, kept up the pressure.

Utah Jazz vs Golden State Warriors: Prediction

Lauri Markkanen has been in fine form, recording 19.7 points, 6.1 rebounds, and 1.8 assists per game. However, his efforts have not been good enough to help the Jazz turn their season around. Next to him, Collin Sexton is the second-best, recording 18.4 points, 2.9 rebounds, and 4.1 assists per game.Meanwhile, the Warriors have lost all of their championship identity over the summer. The team looks lost and has a record of 22-23 at the time of writing. Furthermore, they have also lost six of their last 10 games. The team doesn‚Äôt even win the games they are favorites in and have a record of 15-10 when facing an underdog.However, the Jazz are simply too weak and disorganized to pose any kind of threat to Stephen Curry and company.

WWE Royal Rumble is the first major event of 2025 which will kick off the company‚Äôs spectacular yearly PLE calendar. Apart from the two Royal Rumble matches at the event, a few championship matches will also be featured at this year‚Äôs PLE.Considering that the event is an important one, it‚Äôs worth noting that major storyline shifts can be expected at the Royal Rumble. So here‚Äôs a list of all the matches that have been announced for this PLE on February 1, 2025 and our predictions for who‚Äôs set to win them.The following matches have been announced for the event so far:The Women‚Äôs Royal Rumble is an interesting mix and it is hard to predict the winner because a lot of big names might just end up appearing at the event. With Becky Lynch and Charlotte Flair‚Äôs return imminent, it‚Äôll be interesting to see if they make it to the match to begin with.Considering that Tiffany Stratton‚Äôs being pushed for a match at WrestleMania, it‚Äôs likely that Charlotte Flair picks up the win, should she show up at the Rumble. Bianca Belair is also being considered for a win, but she‚Äôs still involved in a tag team scenario so she might have to sit out on this victory.Charlotte Flair wins.One of the most anticipated matches of the night, the Men‚Äôs Royal Rumble will see some of the biggest names of the company fighting it out for a championship shot at the Show of Shows, WrestleMania.Ideally, if The Rock does end up showing in the match, then he‚Äôs walking out of the event with a WrestleMania title shot, which will in turn reignite his feud with Cody Rhodes. Cm Punk is also a strong contender and might be the last man standing in the ring. That however, might not be the case at all, and Cena might pick up the win here, securing the WrestleMania main event spot for himself. John Cena wins.Motor City Machine Guns have set an exemplary record in the Stamford-based promotion, ever since they were called up to the main brands from NXT. While they‚Äôre yet to pick up their titles from DIY, there‚Äôs a chance that they‚Äôll finally do it at Royal Rumble.Although this is a 2 falls out of 3 match, it‚Äôs going to be a long drawn match, and will all boil down to the team with the most amount of stamina. They‚Äôve got a lot of steam behind them, and this title victory could do them a world of good.Motor City Machine Guns win.Probably the most important match of the night, Kevin Owens and Cody Rhodes will face off in a Ladder Match for the Undisputed WWE Championship. While Kevin Owens has proved his mettle and could win the title, it‚Äôs likely that he won‚Äôt walk out with the belt in hand.With John Cena back in the company, there‚Äôs a high chance that he‚Äôll want to take a shot at the top wrestler in the company, and with Roman Reigns not holding any title right now, Cody Rhodes is the best bet.Cody Rhodes retains the title.","WWE Royal Rumble is the first major event of 2025 which will kick off the company‚Äôs spectacular yearly PLE calendar.

‚ÄúAnthony is one of the most dominant players in the league when healthy. We‚Äôre making sure he‚Äôs managed properly to keep him at his best,‚Äù

Theare gearing up for their highly anticipated clash against the Philadelphia 76ers on Tuesday, January 28, 2025. However, all eyes are onas questions loom about his availability. While Davis isn‚Äôt listed on the Lakers‚Äô official injury report for the game, his history of managing injuries remains a focal point for fans and analysts alike.Davis, the Los Angeles Lakers ‚Äô leading scorer and rebounder this season, has been a key player for the team. Over the last 20 games, the eight-time All-Star has averaged 22.3 points, 12 rebounds, 3.1 assists, and an impressive 2.2 blocks per game. Despite his consistent production, Anthony Davis has faced scrutiny due to his frequent injury concerns, which have occasionally sidelined him in crucial matchups.Los Angeles enters the game with a 26-18 record and sits in playoff contention, but their performance has been a mixed bag. The Los Angeles Lakers average 111.5 points per game while allowing 112.6, with a slim scoring deficit. Anthony Davis, however, remains a cornerstone of their defensive and offensive strategies. His 12.1 rebounds per game rank sixth in the NBA, and his presence in the paint has been vital for the Lakers' interior defense.The matchup against Philadelphia presents a questionable challenge, as the 76ers are struggling with significant injuries of their own, including the absence of Joel Embiid. Without Embiid, the Sixers' frontcourt lacks the firepower to match Davis, should he remain healthy and active for the game. Anthony Davis ‚Äô durability has been a recurring topic, but head coach Darvin Ham expressed confidence in his star player earlier this season.Ham stated in a press conference.The Los Angeles Lakers' success may depend on Davis's ability to keep up his form and steer clear of any setbacks as supporters anxiously await the game. Anthony Davis's performance against the Philadelphia 76ers might be the difference between Los Angeles winning again and losing because of his scoring ability and defensive supremacy.Also read: Will LeBron James playing tonight against the Philadelphia 76ers?

SSP, Rahil reflect on golf's past and present as India hosts elite IS event

GURUGRAM: Nostalgia was basking in the winter sun, and the smiles added more warmth and flavour to the afternoon tea. Well, make that tee. There was a preview of coming attractions as the International Series India presented by DLF takes its swing at the Black Knight course on Thursday, with a prize purse of $2 million at stake.There was SSP Chawrasia , and a reprisal of his success stories on this stage; Also, a resurgent Rahil Gangjee , effervescent, insightful and still yearning. With touches of grey - certainly not green behind the ears - the golfers who once lived a few streets apart in Kolkata painted a picture of past and present.Winning biggies here twice, once at the Avantha Masters on the old Arnold Palmer course in 2011, and more recently at the Indian Open in 2017 on the challenging Gary Player layout, where a host of stars will aim to shine this week, Chawrasia has a rule. ""I think just hit the ball straight and, below 10ft, you just have to putt. That's it.""He did it right that Sunday in March, when the then 38-year-old executed an emphatic 7-stroke defence of the Indian Open, playing measured shots and converting opportunities. Targeting a bogey on the 18th for a trophy is ultra-luxe on this course. SSP's tour that week became the stuff of legend.""He makes it simple but you need a really good, strong mindset,"" Gangjee elaborated. ""The 15th hole is probably the longest hole. But yesterday (Monday) when I was playing, I just about reached the fairway with my driver. I had a hybrid to lay up and a nine iron into the green, but I still made birdie. It is all about what you are going to think on each hole.""For the two-time winner on the Asian Tour , whose triumphs came 14 years apart, a positive attitude was hard to adopt in recent years.Waylaid by a stress fracture in his left foot two years ago, he was unable to walk for five months. ""No golf for eight months so basically just sat home and grumbled for three months. Then my wife Ruhi says, 'hey, listen, just take a holiday'. When I came back, I was much stronger. The mind was fresh. That's what changed.""Last year, an intercostal muscle injury kept him out for a month. ""I'm going to say that these Covid-19 vaccinations haven't done me any good. I'm in better state of mind after these breaks. Time off is important,"" said the 46-year-old.The muscle memory returned, and the mental images too, as Gangjee won twice on the Asian Development Tour to finish third on the 2024 Order of Merit and grasp the premier card again. ""When I won in Vietnam, I bogeyed 14, and I was grumbling, but my wife's words were 'we have got 15, 16, 17, 18 to make birdies'. And I birdied three out of the four!""Also 46, SSP is enjoying his present too, but off the course. ""I've given my life to golf. I think I'm more relaxed now.""The homebody, who finished T-31 at the Phillipine Open three days ago, is not ready to rest on his laurels yet, though. ""When I'm playing, I'm still hungry for titles.""","SSP Chawrasia and Rahil Gangjee reflect on golf's past and present as India hosts elite IS event.

NEW DELHI: For tennis aficionados, the name Togo might not ring a bell. Few would bet on them to trouble India in the Davis Cup 2025 World Group Playoff match here on the weekend. But for their captain Ali Agnamba , who believes his team is in the middle of the best phase in two decades, it would be anything but a cakewalk. Agnamba has a point.Togo have reached this position the back of a 10-match winning streak - achieved by a group of young players who play their tennis abroad. It may sound a bit fanciful when he suggested that his team could beat India, but then he threw up numbers to support his belief.""When we played against Latvia in the last match, nobody expected us to win,"" he said referring to the World No.73 Togo's Davis Cup tie against World No. 46 Latvia. ""Even back home, people thought this was going to be the end. But the guys came together, they were like 'Oh, we want to win this. We're going to win'. And we surprised a lot of people. Even the Latvia players were surprised when we beat them 4-0.""India are ranked eight places above Latvia - at 38.The captain, a former Togolese Davis Cupper himself who migrated to the US years back and was in the coaching team that worked with the Williams sisters in their formative years, draws his confidence from the ability of the four-member team at his disposal. His team of players are based around the world and have been specially assembled for this journey - two from Paris, one from Nantes and the other from Atlanta, USA - not just to earn glory, but respect too.""The Williams sisters changed women tennis. If you have a female tennis player doing what they're doing now, is because of them. Because before, nobody had to go to the gym to get strong. Those girls came, they're so powerful that they force everybody to do a lot more,"" he said.They also changed mindset on race, reminded Agnamba. ""You know, when you're a person of colour, you're already 10 steps below before you can come up. You have to be the best of the best to get respect. Even that sometimes you may not.""Togo would be looking to inspire some of that respect over the weekend. ""Obviously we have four players here that all live in different parts of the world, but we have a way to communicate together through chat. And when there's a competition like this, we kind of figure out how each player can get ready individually, either by training or going to competition. And that's how the team has been performing for the past three years,"" said Agnamba, who admitted having a culture shock when he shifted base to the US 30 years back.In a bid to escape poverty and being able to pursue the sport, the players had to leave Togo seeking greener pastures abroad, but their loyalty remains firmly with the western African country. So, in the match against India, the objective was not just to have a better show in Davis Cup, but to inspire several others back home struggling to make ends meet. Tennis is the second-most followed sport in Togo, behind football.""When you grow up in developing countries, the opportunity is very small. And when you are good at any type of sport, I mean, since we're talking about tennis and the dream is always to get out of the country because once you get out, you have more opportunity to train, you have better equipment. And yeah, that's always been a dream to get out of the country, to have more opportunity.""So, the average kid that plays tennis back home, they're coming from very poor families, and you cannot be your best in Africa. You must get up. And I think for any African country that played in the Davis Cup, 90% of the players live overseas. In developing countries there are a lot of poor kids that use sport as a way to get out of the country to have a better life. And I'll tell you, 99% of the players that are able to compete for Togo come from very poor families. But the system that we have there, the federation helps the best players.""",Togo face India in the Davis Cup 2025 World Group Playoff match on the weekend.

Chiefs vs. Bills AFC Title Showdown Delivers Record-Breaking TV Audience



What Made This Game a Ratings Juggernaut?



The Kansas City Chiefs have once again secured an AFC Championship victory, and with it, another milestone in television ratings. According to Austin Karp of the Sports Business Journal, the Chiefs' thrilling 32-29 win over the Bills attracted 57.4 million viewers, surpassing last year‚Äôs record of 55.5 million. Front Office Sports placed the figure slightly higher at 57.7 million, proving the Chiefs' dominance extends beyond the field to record-breaking audience engagement.The AFC Championship Game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Buffalo Bills on Sunday set a new viewership benchmark, averaging 57.7 million viewers, making it the most-watched AFC Championship Game on record.The thrilling contest, broadcast on CBS, saw the Chiefs edge out the Bills 32-29 in a nail-biting finish. The matchup not only exceeded the ratings for the NFC Championship Game‚Äîwhere the Philadelphia Eagles faced the Washington Commanders, drawing 44.2 million viewers‚Äîbut also positioned itself as the second most-watched NFL game ever, excluding Super Bowls. The only game to surpass it remains the 2009-10 NFC Championship, where the Minnesota Vikings, led by Brett Favre, fell to the New Orleans Saints in an unforgettable overtime clash that secured the Saints' first Super Bowl appearance. That game averaged 57.9 million viewers, a number now narrowly challenged by Sunday‚Äôs AFC showdown.However, even with the NFL‚Äôs surging audience in recent years, the all-time record for a conference championship game remains untouched. The 1982 NFC Championship Game between the Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco 49ers, featuring Dwight Clark‚Äôs legendary ""The Catch,"" drew an astonishing 68.7 million viewers. Given advancements in audience measurement, industry experts speculate that if today‚Äôs ""out-of-home"" viewing metrics (which track viewership in public spaces) had existed back then, the 1982 number might have soared between 75-80 million.Several factors contributed to the Chiefs-Bills showdown‚Äôs record-breaking viewership. The game was not just another playoff clash‚Äîit delivered high-stakes drama, featuring two of the league‚Äôs biggest quarterback superstars, Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen, in an intense rivalry. The prime Sunday evening slot also played a pivotal role in maximizing engagement, with millions tuning in.Beyond football, pop culture elements likely gave viewership an additional boost. Taylor Swift‚Äôs presence at Arrowhead Stadium, cheering for her boyfriend Travis Kelce, further heightened intrigue. Her influence on NFL ratings has been evident throughout the season, and this game was no exception.Also Read: Raiders owner praised Tom Brady's appointment as a minority owner as a crucial addition to the organization since Jon Gruden's resignation As Sports Business Journal‚Äôs Austin Karp noted, the record-breaking numbers reinforce a key takeaway‚Äîthere is no Chiefs fatigue among viewers. This trend bodes well for the Super Bowl, which could surpass last year‚Äôs record numbers, as Kansas City prepares to face the Eagles on Feb. 9 in Super Bowl LIX, eyeing a historic third consecutive championship‚Äîa feat unseen in the Super Bowl era.","The AFC Championship Game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Buffalo Bills on Sunday set a new viewership benchmark.

However, despite his efforts, the Eagles fell short in a heartbreaking 38-35 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs. Now, as the much-anticipated Super Bowl rematch approaches, Brown has reflected on the invaluable lessons he gained from that experience.As A.J. Brown prepares for his second Super Bowl appearance, the Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver is embracing the lessons learned from his previous trip to the grand stage.

However, with a fresh perspective and a more composed mindset, Brown is determined to make this opportunity count.Having taken time to reflect and learn since his last Super Bowl experience, Brown is approaching this trip with a more disciplined mindset. ""This is very different,"" Brown said. ""My emotions are intact. Of course, I‚Äôm excited for guys who haven‚Äôt been before. But I just want to win. I just want to win.

According to sources, with the Champions Trophy looming, the Indian team think-tank will advise Rahul on the batting position and the Karnataka team management is happy to work around it.Irrespective of where Rahul bats, one among KV Aneesh and Abhinav Manohar ‚Äì two players in good touch -- will have to sit out.Pacer Vidwath Kaverappa, who picked up a shin injury during the Duleep Trophy in September last year, will make his maiden appearance this season.

Rajkot: A major point of interest in the ongoing series has been Mohammed Shami ‚Äôs much-awaited return after being out of action since the 2023 ODI World Cup. Shami was expected to play right from the first match but his bowling has been restricted to just the warm-up sessions.India‚Äôs newly-appointed batting coach Sitanshu Kotak , while clarifying that Shami was ‚Äúfit,‚Äù hinted that India are planning to unleash Shami closer to the ICC Champions Trophy next month. When to play him will be a decision that rests with India‚Äôs head coach Gautam Gambhir and captain Suryakumar Yadav , Kotak said.‚ÄúYes, Shami is fit but something about him playing or not playing, I am not the one who can answer. There is definitely a plan (for Shami) looking at coming matches as well as One-Dayers. So, that is something Gautam and obviously Surya will take a call on. But (his) fitness, definitely is not a problem, depending on how they are planning to build his load,‚Äù Kotak said.A critical part of Kotak‚Äôs role will, of course, be beyond this T20I series , with Test and ODI skipper Rohit Sharma and star batter Virat Kohli going through a rough patch. Asked if he had identified areas where he could help them rectify, Kotak said, ‚ÄúRohit and Virat are senior players, but even the players we have now, it is a lot about understanding how they are planning their games, how they think and then see if we can add something.

'Keep it Simple': Rubin Hermann on Paarl Royals‚Äô approach in SA20

Dinesh Karthik on Lhuan-dre Pretorius, start for Paarl Royals in SA20

Paarl Royals , led by David Miller and featuring India's Dinesh Karthik , made history on Monday by becoming the first SA20 team to achieve a perfect home record at Boland Park .In a thrilling encounter, Dayyan Galiem and Mitchell van Buuren held their nerves to secure the win for the Royals, with six runs needed off the final over.This marks the first time an SA20 side has remained unbeaten at home throughout the league phase, surpassing Joburg Super Kings' previous best of four wins and one washout at the Wanderers in the 2023 edition.The loss eliminated Keshav Maharaj's Durban Super Giants from playoff contention, as they have only managed one win from nine matches.""Five from five at home, been fantastic support from fans. The local fans really do get behind us. Nice achievement, the guys have been phenomenal, sticking to their plans. So good to see the youngsters coming through,"" Miller said at the post-match presentation.South Africa's young talents, Luhan-dre Pretorius and Kwena Maphaka , played crucial roles in the Royals' continued dominance at the top of the SA20 points table.Maphaka delivered his best SA20 performance to date, with figures of 2/22, helping restrict the Super Giants to 143/7.Pretorius then clubbed 43 off 29 deliveries (5x4s, 1x6) in the successful run-chase, reclaiming the top run-scorer position from teammate Joe Root, who was dismissed LBW off the first delivery of the innings.The Royals had already qualified for the knockouts with seven wins from eight matches, with their only loss coming against MI Cape Town.

Ranji Trophy: Virat Kohli's grand homecoming stirs up Delhi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/virat-kohlis-grand-homecoming-stirs-up-delhi/articleshow/117664297.cms,"Star batter turns up for training ahead of

comeback after 12 years

Business as usual at nets

NEW DELHI: It's been 12 years and three months since Virat Kohli last played a Ranji Trophy match for Delhi. Since that frenzied game against Uttar Pradesh at a small, packed stadium in Ghaziabad - in a match lit up by the presence of established stars like Virender Sehwag , Gautam Gambhir, Ashish Nehra Suresh Raina and Praveen Kumar - Indian cricket has gone through many cycles of change.Kohli has been at the centre of it all, amassing 8500 Test runs in that period and becoming a brand ambassador for India's cricket. Now, with the dwindling form of the senior batters in focus after the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia - and calls for more star presence in the Ranji Trophy growing louder - Kohli returned to the Ferozeshah Kotla on Tuesday for a practice session, two days ahead of Delhi's last Ranji Trophy match against Railways.Poor returns from the bat of late have haunted the likes of Kohli and other Test batters, forcing them to make the right noises by showing commitment to domestic cricket. However, it's easy to forget that Kohli has been playing rigorous, non-stop international cricket across formats for these 12 years.Kohli's presence ensured that the entire day's training became an event in itself. Delhi and District Cricket Association ( DDCA ) officials, working overtime to provide seamless practice in presence of a sizeable media, were eager to show off their proximity to the star. Phrases like ""he hasn't changed at all"" prefixed every conversation with anyone who spent even a minute with Kohli.Everyone wanted a piece of Kohli. From the Delhi team lining up like a human chain to greet him upon arrival to old acquaintances sharing a few laughs to a few extra 'security' people escorting him from the nets, it was like Kohli had not been to the Kotla at all these last few years. Of course, he's played numerous internationals and IPL games at this venue in the meantime.None of these 'special' arrangements were required earlier, but Tuesday morning was more about making a statement. So much so, that the members of Delhi team management were not shy of conceding that the team went through one of the most disciplined and intense warm-up drills in the season just to match Kohli's intensity. Too bad that it came when Delhi's domestic campaign is as good as over.When Kohli padded up in the nets, he was all business. He started by taking out two new bats from his kit bag. ""Bhaiya, aap knocking kar lo (you do the knocking),"" Delhi's designated captain Ayush Badoni said, ready to give up his own session. ""I'll stand behind you. We can switch and take throwdowns,"" was Kohli's response.Through the next 45 minutes, Kohli's batting drills revolved around playing off the backfoot and driving on the off-side. Driving through covers has been his bane of late. It was evident he was working overtime to find a solution to the problem.The punches off the backfoot to marginally back-of-a-length balls dominated the session. Balls outside off were met under the eye and steered square on the off side. Dabs and pushes towards cover point and third man were also a feature.The big lunges towards the full ball seemed a lot measured. It could be Kohli is getting into One-Day mode with the ICC Champions Trophy about three weeks away.As he walked off the nets, he told the team manager that he loved the practice and is eager to come back on Wednesday.As the nets session got over, Kohli's teammate from U-16 and U-19 days, Shawej Khan, walked up to him with his eight-year-old son Kabir. Kabir, an aspiring cricketer, brought a sketch of Kohli drawn by himself, and wanted to get it signed. As the media hounded the kid, he gave away Kohli's message to him: ""Your father shouldn't be telling you that you need to go for training. It should be you telling him that you want to train.""Before the entire team went into the Virat Kohli pavilion for lunch, Kohli got them into a huddle and delivered an animated speech. This isn't a sight usually seen in Delhi cricket . No one's going to give out the exact words but a few who couldn't resist would mention the crux of the speech. It was about stirring up the team, which has been floundering for the past few seasons.",Virat Kohli last played a Ranji Trophy match for Delhi 12 years and three months ago.

Stuart Broad on India's challenge in the Champions Trophy

NEW DELHI: When New Zealand quick Trent Boult was posed with a unique challenge -- how he would bowl the first over to the legendary Sachin Tendulkar ? -- he offered an entertaining glimpse into his hypothetical strategy.‚ÄúAll right,‚Äù Boult began, his voice tinged with playful confidence, ‚Äúa very easy, very simple plan.‚ÄùHis imaginative field setup kicked off with one slip instead of two‚Äîrecognising Tendulkar's formidable presence at the crease‚Äîand then a cover, a point, a mid-wicket, and a mid-off.Boult declared an audacious approach to unsettle the Little Master.Watch:He envisioned deceiving Tendulkar into thinking an in-swinger was coming, aimed at middle stump, luring him into a subtle push that would result in a mid-wicket catch.Boult elaborated, ""I'd even bring my cover fielder in close, making it look like a trap."" But his ultimate move? The bait-and-switch.‚ÄúI‚Äôd run in, start my delivery, then change the plan completely,‚Äù he chuckled.In this imagined face-off, Boult would bowl a surprise bouncer, targeting Tendulkar‚Äôs helmet. He saw Tendulkar attempting a hook shot and being caught by the leg-side fielder.‚ÄúFirst ball of the game‚Äîso easy,‚Äù he finished with mock bravado, knowing that such a feat is a bowler's fantasy against someone of Tendulkar's caliber.Meanwhile, Boult has been showcasing his real skills in SA20 2025, representing MI Cape Town.Despite his moderate tally of five wickets in seven matches, his team has claimed four wins, accumulating 21 points.MI Cape Town sit second, seven points behind the David Miller-led Paarl Royals, who top the standings.","Trent Boult imagines how he would bowl the first over to Sachin Tendulkar.
