Michael Carter II trade gives Eagles defensive flexibility



Why the Jets and Eagles both benefit from the swap



The Philadelphia Eagles have made another strategic midseason move, acquiring cornerback Michael Carter II from the New York Jets in a deal that could reshape their defensive flexibility. The trade sends Carter and a 2027 seventh-round pick to Philadelphia in exchange for wide receiver John Metchie and a 2027 sixth-round pick. It’s a small shift on paper but one that might carry a big impact for both sides.For the Eagles, this deal is about solidifying depth and experience in the secondary. Carter, who missed the Jets’ last game due to a concussion, was expected to be cleared after the bye week. In his five appearances this season, he posted 14 tackles and two pass deflections — modest numbers that don’t fully reflect his reliability in the slot. According to Pro Football Focus, Carter has played 85 percent of his career snaps at nickel corner, making him a natural fit for Philadelphia’s evolving defensive schemes.The Eagles have been experimenting with Cooper DeJean’s role, alternating him between the slot and outside coverage. Defensive coordinator Vic Fangio recently addressed that internal debate, saying, “We considered it. But when you have one of the better players at a certain position, and it’s an important position where you get involved more, you hate to take a really good player at one position to maybe not be as good of a player or impactful of a player at another position.But it’s definitely something that we’ve talked about.”That quote perfectly sums up the team’s dilemma — DeJean’s versatility is an asset, but the Eagles lacked a true nickel specialist. With Carter’s arrival, Fangio now has the flexibility to keep DeJean outside full-time if needed, strengthening both coverage spots without compromising defensive efficiency.While the Eagles gain a proven slot defender, the Jets offload a player who became expendable after the addition of Jarvis Brownlee Jr. Carter remains under contract through 2027 with $20.3 million left on his deal, though only $2.3 million is guaranteed, making the move financially low-risk for Philadelphia.The Eagles part ways with John Metchie, a talented receiver who never found his rhythm in their crowded offense. Despite showing flashes of potential in seven games, Metchie managed just four catches for 18 yards. The trade offers him a clearer path with the Jets, while Philadelphia effectively swaps a late-round pick for a defensive upgrade.Time will reveal how Michael Carter II fits into the Eagles’ rotation, but one thing is certain — his addition gives the Birds much-needed versatility and stability in the secondary, right when the season’s intensity is about to peak.Also Read: Cam Newton reacts to viral Alabama A&M mascot clash, reveals surprising reason behind the playful scuffle","The Philadelphia Eagles have acquired cornerback Michael Carter II from the New York Jets.

When is Lamar Jackson returning to the field? Ravens star confirms comeback and sparks locker-room shake-up ahead of Dolphins clash,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/when-is-lamar-jackson-returning-to-the-field-ravens-star-confirms-comeback-and-sparks-locker-room-shake-up-ahead-of-dolphins-clash/articleshow/124926500.cms,"Lamar Jackson is back for the Baltimore Ravens, boosting team confidence and offensive rhythm for their crucial game against the Miami Dolphins. His dual-threat ability and leadership are expected to revitalize the team's dynamic play. This return marks a significant moment as the Ravens aim for a strong resurgence after a period of inconsistency.

Lamar Jackson’s return reshapes Baltimore’s identity and confidence

A defining test awaits as Ravens aim for resurgence



Baltimore Ravens fans can finally breathe a sigh of relief, Lamar Jackson is officially back. After weeks of uncertainty surrounding his hamstring injury, the Ravens quarterback has been cleared to play in Thursday night’s high-stakes matchup against the Miami Dolphins. His return comes at a critical juncture in Baltimore’s season, as the team looks to rebound from an inconsistent start and regain its offensive rhythm.For the first time in weeks, head coach John Harbaugh will have a fully healthy 53-man roster, a welcome change after a series of injuries derailed the Ravens’ early momentum. Jackson’s reappearance not only restores Baltimore’s dynamic offense but also revives the leadership that the team has sorely missed.The former MVP’s impact extends well beyond the stat sheet. His dual-threat capability—both as a passer and a runner, forces opposing defenses to cover every inch of the field. With Jackson back under center, offensive coordinator Greg Roman can reintroduce designed quarterback runs, play-action schemes, and deep passing routes that have long been hallmarks of Baltimore’s success.But Jackson’s influence isn’t purely tactical. His leadership has quietly transformed the Ravens’ locker room over the past few weeks.In a move that grabbed headlines, Jackson reportedly asked for table games like ping-pong to be removed from team facilities, emphasizing focus over fun. It wasn’t about cutting out camaraderie, it was a message about accountability. The quarterback made it clear that celebration would return only once the team rediscovered its winning rhythm.The Ravens managed to snap a four-game losing streak last week behind backup Tyler Huntley, a victory that gave them a glimmer of hope before Jackson’s return. Now, Baltimore faces a resurgent Miami Dolphins defense, a perfect test of whether their restored health can translate into consistent performance.Jackson’s readiness couldn’t have come at a better time. If his confidence matches his physical recovery, Baltimore’s offense may finally return to the explosive, clock-controlling form that once made them a powerhouse in the AFC North. For a team searching for momentum, Lamar Jackson’s comeback feels less like a return and more like a revival.Also Read: Brittany Mahomes' heartwarming hidden detail in her Chiefs game day outfit proves she’s Patrick Mahomes’ No. 1 cheerleader","Lamar Jackson has been cleared to play in Thursday night's game against the Miami Dolphins.

Cam Newton Breaks Down What REALLY Happened With That Mascot on Live TV

Cam Newton reflects on lessons and reactions



Cam Newton has finally addressed the viral clip showing him in a heated moment with Alabama A&M’s mascot “Butch” during ESPN’s First Take live event in Birmingham. The former NFL star insists the interaction wasn’t as serious as it appeared online, saying the entire exchange was meant in good humor.During the 4th and 1 podcast, Newton said the short clip that made headlines didn’t tell the full story. “Everything was all in good fun,” he explained. “If people really wanted to dig deep, they could’ve dug deeper in finding the other clip, but that was the only clip you saw. What am I gonna do? I’m gonna let it air out.”The incident took place on October 24 at Legion Field in Birmingham, ahead of the Magic City Classic between Alabama A&M and Alabama State. As part of the pregame festivities, the schools’ mascots took part in a 40-yard dash. When Newton celebrated with the winning mascot, Butch appeared to take offense, leading to a brief shoving exchange that aired live on television.The clip quickly went viral, with fans and even Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin initially believing it was a genuine fight. But Newton cleared the air, saying, “I just thank God no one got hurt, as we were doing what we were doing.It was all in good fun.”Newton, 36, added that the situation reminded him of a valuable life lesson from his father, Cecil Newton Sr. “Son, you can be on top of the world. The next day, the world’s gonna be on top of you,” his father once told him — a line that perfectly fits how quickly online moments can spiral out of control.The former Heisman Trophy winner also used humor to lighten the mood, joking that Butch should thank him for becoming “Meme of the Year.” Despite the chaos that followed, Newton emphasized the importance of perspective, reminding fans that not everything seen online reflects reality.“Everything was playful, but it didn’t look like it was playful,” he added. For Newton, the moment was a lighthearted misunderstanding that snowballed into viral frenzy — proof that in today’s digital age, even the most harmless moments can take on a life of their own.Also Read: Patrick Mahomes breaks silence with bold four-word message about ‘hostile’ Bills fans before AFC showdown","Cam Newton says viral mascot altercation was all in fun.

"Governor Jeff Landry declares war on LSU leadership, blocks Scott Woodward from choosing next coach after Brian Kelly's costly fallout",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/governor-jeff-landry-declares-war-on-lsu-leadership-blocks-scott-woodward-from-choosing-next-coach-after-brian-kellys-costly-fallout/articleshow/124926269.cms,"Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry has asserted that the LSU Board of Supervisors, not Athletic Director Scott Woodward, will select the next head football coach. Landry cited concerns over costly buyouts and potential conflicts of interest, stating, ""I’m tired of rewarding failure."" This unexpected power shift signals a new focus on fiscal responsibility for the prominent athletic program.

Governor Jeff Landry says the Board will take charge of hiring LSU’s next coach

Scott Woodward’s legacy questioned amid Kelly fallout and costly contracts

A defining moment for LSU’s football future

Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry made a bold statement this week that sent shockwaves through Baton Rouge’s sports and political circles. Following the sudden firing of LSU head football coach Brian Kelly , Landry announced that Athletic Director Scott Woodward will not be the one choosing Kelly’s replacement, a decision that immediately sparked debate about power, accountability, and the future of LSU football.During a press conference primarily focused on SNAP benefits amid the ongoing government shutdown, Gov. Landry didn’t hold back when questioned about the Tigers’ coaching search. “I can tell you right now, Scott Woodward is not selecting the next coach,” Landry said. “The Board of Supervisors is going to come up with a committee and they are going to find us a coach.”The statement came as a surprise even to LSU’s Board of Supervisors, whose chair, Scott Ballard, told reporters that the group “had no idea” they’d be handling the decision. Still, Ballard appeared ready to embrace the challenge, saying, “Well then, I better get to it!” as he exited an interview with WBRZ.The development marks an unusual shift in control for one of the most high-profile athletic programs in the country, especially given that athletic directors typically oversee such hiring decisions.Scott Woodward, who took over as LSU’s athletic director in 2019, has built a reputation as a big-game hunter when it comes to coaching hires, previously bringing in big names like Jimbo Fisher at Texas A&M and Brian Kelly at LSU.But Governor Landry was clear that he doesn’t want a repeat of those costly arrangements.“Right now we have a $53 million liability and we are not doing that again,” Landry said, referring to Kelly’s buyout. “I’m tired of rewarding failure in this country.”Landry also hinted at potential conflicts of interest, noting that “the agent who wrote Fisher’s contract represents both Woodward, Kelly and some players.” Kelly is represented by Trace Armstrong, while Fisher’s agent is Jimmy Sexton, both major figures in college sports negotiations.The power shift suggests Landry and the LSU Board intend to prioritize fiscal responsibility and performance over prestige in choosing the next head coach. As the search intensifies, all eyes will be on Baton Rouge, not just to see who leads the Tigers next, but who truly holds the reins of Louisiana’s most influential football program.Also Read: “Just being cruel”: Benedict Polizzi faces backlash after mocking Mark Sanchez’s stabbing with controversial Halloween costume",Governor Jeff Landry says the Board will take charge of hiring LSU’s next coach.

Joe Alwyn is reportedly handling Taylor’s engagement with quiet grace

From heartbreak to healing: both stars move forward in different directions



Taylor Swift’s engagement to Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce has captured headlines across the world, but one person fans can’t stop wondering about is her longtime ex, Joe Alwyn. The British actor, who dated Swift from 2016 until their quiet split in 2023, has remained almost completely out of the spotlight since their breakup. Now, sources close to him are finally revealing how he feels about Taylor’s new chapter and it’s more complicated than fans might think.While many expected Joe to react emotionally to the engagement news, insiders say he’s showing remarkable maturity. “He genuinely hopes Taylor’s happy,” one source told RadarOnline, emphasizing that Joe has no plans to reach out or make a public statement. “For him, it’s time to move on for good,” the insider added.Those who followed Taylor and Joe’s relationship know that they kept their romance intensely private, a stark contrast to the very public love story she now shares with Kelce. During their six-year relationship, the two collaborated creatively, with Alwyn even co-writing several of Taylor’s Folklore and Evermore tracks under the pseudonym “William Bowery.”Their breakup marked the end of one of Swift’s most introspective eras, and while she has since moved on to global headlines and NFL stadium appearances, Joe has chosen the opposite path, retreating into his acting career and maintaining his signature low profile.Despite the emotional weight of seeing an ex move on so publicly, Joe seems content to focus on his career. He recently wrapped filming Panic Carefully alongside Julia Roberts and portrayed Laertes in a reimagined film adaptation of Hamlet.Meanwhile, Taylor’s own life couldn’t be more different. Her concert film, The Official Release Party of a Showgirl, grossed over $50 million this month, and her engagement to Kelce has made her one half of America’s most-watched couple.While Swifties debate whether Joe might secretly harbor lingering emotions, those close to him insist otherwise. For Joe, it’s not about jealousy, it’s about closure. After years of shared memories and creative collaboration, his quiet acceptance may be the truest sign of peace in a story the world can’t stop following.Also Read: Taylor Swift beams with pride as Travis Kelce hits 100th touchdown and breaks into her viral ‘Fate of Ophelia’ dance","Joe Alwyn is reportedly handling Taylor Swift's engagement with quiet grace, with sources close to him stating he genuinely hopes she's happy and has no plans to reach out.

Aljamain Sterling on Tom Aspinall’s reaction in the cage

“When Tommy got poked in the eye, the first thing he said was, ‘I cannot see.’

… You can’t say those words; otherwise, the referee is inclined to stop the fight.”

“I got illegally kneed, blasted in the head … I know if I said that I’m done the fight is over.”

Inside the UFC 321 eye-poke incident between Tom Aspinall and Ciryl Gane



“The whole narrative on oh Tom wanted out, he was losing the fight, he found a way out… You’re talking about the guy that fought Sergei Pavlovich… You’re telling me that guy was looking for a way out?”

“Don’t be mad at me.”

On 25 October 2025, during UFC 321 at the Etihad Arena in Abu Dhabi, England’s heavyweight champion Tom Aspinall faced off against France’s former interim champion Ciryl Gane. Midway through the first round, Gane accidentally poked Aspinall in the eyes and the fight was declared a no-contest. Former bantamweight champion Aljamain Sterling has since weighed in, insisting Tom Aspinall should have handled the situation differently and he’s stood firm despite a backlash.Aljamain Sterling’s view is clear: when Tom Aspinall said “I cannot see” after the eye poke, that wording alone pressured the referee to stop the fight.On his YouTube channel, Sterling said,Sterling added he isn’t questioning Aspinall’s integrity. He said, “I never questioned Tommy’s integrity.” Yet he felt Aspinall should have asked for the full five-minute recovery window instead of immediately signalling he couldn’t continue.Fans were quick to respond on social media after Sterling’s comments went public. Some felt Sterling was unfair, given Sterling himself once won his title via disqualification when he was fouled at UFC 259.Sterling referred to that:Tom Aspinall made his first defence of the undisputed heavyweight title against Ciryl Gane at UFC 321. The fight came to a halt at about the 4:35 mark of round one when Gane’s fingers struck both of Aspinall’s eyes as he attempted to block a kick.The injury forced the referee to end the bout as a no-contest. Medical checks after the fight raised concern, as Aspinall was taken to the hospital for further evaluation.Despite panic among fans, his doctor later said there was nothing “dangerous” about the eye injury. Meanwhile, commentator and ex-fighter Brendan Schaub defended Aspinall against critics who claimed he quit too early.Also Read: Tom Aspinall’s UFC 321 Eye-Poke Controversy Sparks Sean O’Malley’s Bold Claim About Missed Jon Jones White House Clash Schaub said,So Sterling’s comments arrive amid a larger debate: Was Aspinall’s reaction valid?

Sterling says his opinion stands, and he told critics:Aljamain Sterling still thinks Tom Aspinall could have handled the eye-poke situation at UFC 321 differently, even while recognising the injury and refusing to question his integrity.",Former bantamweight champion Aljamain Sterling says Tom Aspinall could have handled the eye-poke situation at UFC 321 differently.

Thesquare off in a regular-season battle on October 29, 2025, as both teams navigate a series of injuries that could heavily influence the outcome. With key stars sidelined, this matchup promises an intense test of depth and resilience for both rosters.The Los Angeles Lakers enter the contest shorthanded, missing several major contributors. LeBron James continues to be out due to right sciatica and is not expected to return until mid-November. Luka Doncic is also sidelined after suffering a left finger sprain and a left lower leg contusion in a recent game against Minnesota. The injury will keep him out for at least another week.Additionally, Gabe Vincent remains unavailable with a left ankle sprain, and Maxi Kleber continues to recover from an abdominal muscle strain. Jaxson Hayes and Marcus Smart are both listed as questionable - Hayes is battling left patellar tendinopathy and has already missed three consecutive games, while Smart is managing a right quadriceps contusion.Adou Thiero remains out following left knee surgery recovery.With these absences, Austin Reaves becomes the focal point of the Lakers’ offense. Reaves has risen to the challenge this season, already posting multiple 40-point performances and playing a key role in keeping the Lakers competitive despite the adversity.The Minnesota Timberwolves will also be without their star guard, Anthony Edwards, who is recovering from a right hamstring strain expected to sideline him for approximately two weeks. Jaylen Clark is listed as questionable with a left calf strain, leaving his availability uncertain for the matchup.Despite these setbacks, Minnesota still boasts capable scorers in Jaden McDaniels and Julius Randle. McDaniels has been impressive, recently notching 25 points and 3 rebounds, while Randle added 24 points in the team’s previous outing. Naz Reid continues to provide reliable production off the bench, contributing valuable scoring and rebounding support to keep Minnesota’s frontcourt strong.The Lakers’ injury woes place tremendous pressure on Austin Reaves , who will once again be tasked with leading the offense in the absence of LeBron James and Luka Doncic. His playmaking, scoring efficiency, and leadership will be critical in keeping Los Angeles afloat. The rest of the Lakers’ rotation will need to step up on both ends of the floor, particularly on defense, to contain Minnesota’s physical lineup.For the Timberwolves, this game presents an opportunity to capitalize on a depleted Lakers squad. McDaniels and Randle are expected to carry the offensive load in Edwards’ absence, while the team’s defensive focus will likely center on limiting Reaves’ production. Fatigue could become a factor for Los Angeles, given the team’s current lack of depth and ongoing injury challenges.Despite the injuries, both teams are expected to bring energy and intensity, with role players having the chance to shine in expanded roles. Fans can look forward to a hard-fought, entertaining matchup as these two Western Conference teams battle for early-season momentum.The game will air nationally on ESPN, with local coverage available on Spectrum SportsNet and FanDuel Sports Network North. Streaming options include NBA League Pass and Fubo, ensuring fans won’t miss a minute of the action.This clash between the Los Angeles Lakers and Minnesota Timberwolves offers more than just a typical regular-season game. Both teams are dealing with key injuries, but their resilience will define who prevails in what promises to be a gritty and competitive showdown early in the 2025-26 NBA season.","The Los Angeles Lakers and Minnesota Timberwolves square off in a regular-season battle on October 29, 2025.

A breakout season on the field, and a big heart off it



The Patriots’ lasting commitment to community

The New England Patriots traded their game jerseys for costumes this week — and rookie quarterback Drake Maye was front and center. As Halloween approaches, the Patriots teamed up with the Kraft family, the New England Patriots Foundation, and the New England Revolution Foundation to host a special Halloween party for children fighting pediatric cancer. The event took place at Gillette Stadium on October 28, giving kids and their families a chance to forget hospital rooms for a night and simply have fun.Maye, the third overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, arrived dressed as Charizard, the fiery Pokémon character, drawing smiles and laughter from everyone there. The young quarterback was joined by teammates Kayshon Boutte, DeMario Douglas, Mack Hollins, Marcus Jones, and Ben Brown, along with team mascot Pat Patriot, the Patriots Cheerleaders, and New England Revolution forward Malcolm Fry and mascot Slyde. More than 40 children from hospitals including Boston Children’s Hospital, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Hasbro Children’s Hospital, Mass General Hospital, UMass Memorial Health, and One Summit attended the event with their families. They took part in Halloween activities like pumpkin decorating, cookie design, and fun games, surrounded by players who made sure every kid felt special.While fans know Maye for his breakout rookie season — with 2,026 passing yards, 15 touchdowns, and just three interceptions — he’s also making an impression off the field.He’s added 250 rushing yards and two more touchdowns on the ground, quickly becoming a fan favorite across New England. But appearances like this show another side of him — one that connects deeply with fans and the local community. “They've been through it, and the fans have been through it the last couple years,” Maye said. “So it's just credit to them. I know the fans have been awesome. Like I said, I think they're the best fans in the league, and they continue to show out every week.”The New England Patriots Foundation, started by Robert Kraft in 1994, continues to help families across the region through year-round programs and partnerships. Its sister organization, the New England Revolution Foundation, launched in 1996, focuses on supporting local initiatives around childhood cancer, social justice, and inclusion. Together, they’ve built a strong community presence — and this Halloween celebration was another reminder that for the Patriots, giving back is just as important as winning on Sundays.","The New England Patriots teamed up with the Kraft family to host a Halloween party for children fighting pediatric cancer.

On Wednesday night, the Boston Celtics and Cleveland Cavaliers will clash at TD Garden in Boston, Massachusetts. The tip-off time is set for 7 p.m. ET. However, the Cavaliers' development may be halted by the recent injury setback. Sam Merrill, their star player, reportedly won't be at their upcoming game. Merrill will have to sit out at least one game due to his health issue after leaving Monday's game against the Detroit Pistons in the first quarter. Friday's encounter with the Toronto Raptors will be his next match.Following a first-round 0-3 after cashing, the Cavaliers bounced back to crush the Detroit Pistons on Monday night as a 2-point favorite and picked up their first cover of the year. On the other hand, the Celtics visited the New Orleans Pelicans, betting as a 4.5-point favorite. The Celtics were led by G Anfernee Simons' 25 points off the bench.However, recently, unfortunate for the Cavs, Sam Merrill has been labelled as OUT for tonight's game against the Boston Celtics due to a right hip injury. Merrill was only able to play 18 minutes because of the injury he sustained during the third quarter of Cleveland's victory over the Detroit Pistons on Monday night.Despite having grasped his hip earlier in the game, Merrill played until the third quarter. Stating the same, Cavs’ head coach Kenny Atkinson said after the win:“He’s hurting.. When Sam can’t come back in the game, it’s [painful]. I think Evan [Mobley] actually hit him in the hip. Somehow they [collided]. Looks like a hip pointer. Those are painful, so we’ll see. But he’s hurting right now.”Aside from Sam Merrill, Max Strus and Darius Garland are also sidelined due to injury . The Cavaliers can start Jaylon Tyson on Wednesday while Darius Garland continues preparing to play in spite of the setback.Sam Merrill was chosen to start for Cleveland in the 2025–26 season to replace Darius Garland and Max Strus. Merrill has had an early-season breakout, averaging 17.3 points on 52.5% shooting from the field and 51.4% from three-point range through the team's first four games.For a Cavaliers squad that was just beginning to establish, Merrill's injury came at the worst possible time. The team's 3-1 start has been largely due to his perimeter shooting, as he has made 18 threes in four games. The rotation had begun to stabilize with De'Andre Hunter's return, but Cleveland will once again need to make adjustments.Merrill has been the Cavaliers' best player in their first three games, according to head coach Kenny Atkinson during Sunday's victory over Milwaukee Bucks . He will now probably look to Lonzo Ball or Jaylon Tyson to replace Merrill. When the Cavaliers host the Toronto Raptors on Friday, October 31, Merrill will have another opportunity to make a comeback.With an average of 4.5 3-point field goals made, Merrill leads the squad. He is shooting 51.5 percent from the field and 51.7 percent from beyond the arc. Hence, it is safe to say that he is a phenomenal player.Also read: Is Jayson Tatum playing tonight?

Cleveland Cavaliers vs Boston Celtics Matchup Outlook (October 29, 2025)

What to Watch for in Tonight's Cleveland Cavaliers vs Boston Celtics Matchup?

Theare set to clash in a high-stakes regular-season showdown on October 29, 2025, at TD Garden in Boston. Both Eastern Conference contenders are dealing with crucial injuries that could heavily influence the outcome of this early-season matchup. Cleveland Cavaliers enter the contest with several key players sidelined. Star point guard Darius Garland remains unavailable as he continues to recover from surgery on his left great toe. Shooting guard Max Strus is also out of action, still rehabilitating from a Jones fracture in his left foot that required surgical repair. Adding to the Cavaliers’ injury woes, Sam Merrill has been ruled out after sustaining a right hip contusion in a collision with teammate Evan Mobley.These absences have forced head coach J.B. Bickerstaff to rely more heavily on his bench and recent addition Lonzo Ball, who has stepped into Garland’s role at point guard. Despite their injury setbacks, the Cavaliers have impressed early in the season, holding a 3-1 record and riding a three-game winning streak. Their ability to remain competitive without key starters underscores the team’s growing depth and resilience.The Boston Celtics , too, are managing their share of health concerns. Franchise cornerstone Jayson Tatum remains sidelined after undergoing surgery to repair his right Achilles and is not expected to return until he’s fully cleared by medical staff. Meanwhile, Jaylen Brown is listed as “probable” as he continues to manage a left hamstring strain that has nagged him since opening night. Though limited, Brown has continued to suit up in every game so far, demonstrating grit and consistency - including his solid 15-point, 7-rebound showing in the team’s 122-90 season-opening victory over the New Orleans Pelicans.Boston Celtics’ depth will be tested again, as players like Derrick White, Jrue Holiday, and Kristaps Porziņģis will be expected to shoulder additional scoring and defensive duties in Tatum’s absence. The Celtics currently sit at 1-3 and are looking to build momentum with a statement win at home.The injuries on both sides set the stage for an intriguing battle centered around adaptability and depth. The Cavaliers, buoyed by their strong start and improved chemistry, will look to continue their winning run on the road. With Lonzo Ball orchestrating the offense alongside a healthy frontcourt featuring Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen, Cleveland has the tools to pose a serious challenge to the Celtics.Boston, on the other hand, will rely heavily on Brown’s presence and the team’s collective effort to make up for Tatum’s scoring void. Head coach Joe Mazzulla will need to deploy creative rotations and balanced scoring to counter Cleveland’s size and physical play inside the paint.• Lonzo Ball’s performance as the primary playmaker in Garland’s absence.• Jaylen Brown’s agility and offensive rhythm as he continues to recover from a hamstring strain.• The Celtics’ secondary scorers and their ability to step up without Tatum.• The interior matchup between Evan Mobley, Jarrett Allen, and Boston’s frontcourt rotation.The October 29 meeting between the Cleveland Cavaliers and Boston Celtics promises to be a compelling contest defined by strategy, resilience, and adaptability. Both teams are navigating early-season adversity, but their depth and competitiveness should ensure an exciting night for fans at TD Garden.While injuries have reshaped both lineups, the clash serves as a testament to the physical demands of the NBA and the determination of two Eastern Conference powerhouses striving to stay in contention. Expect an intense and tactical battle as both sides look to prove their mettle early in the 2025-26 campaign.","Cleveland Cavaliers and Boston Celtics set to clash in a regular-season showdown on October 29, 2025.

Shubman Gill vs Jasprit Bumrah in the nets: Exciting contest between star players

NEW DELHI: Shubman Gill 's poised yet powerful batting display in the rain-marred first T20I against Australia in Canberra has reignited comparisons with Virat Kohli 's hallmark composure and efficiency. The Indian vice-captain looked in complete control at the top of the order, remaining unbeaten on 37 off just 20 balls before the skies opened up and play was eventually called off.Gill's innings, which featured crisp timing and effortless strokeplay, reflected a growing maturity that has become a defining feature of his batting. Even without taking undue risks, he maintained a strike rate of 185, underlining his ability to dominate bowlers without appearing aggressive.Former India wicketkeeper-batter Dinesh Karthik was among those left impressed, drawing a striking comparison between Gill's style and that of former skipper Virat Kohli. Speaking on Cricbuzz, Karthik said, “This is what Virat Kohli does in ODIs. You'll never know where he is till you look at the scorecard. You'll think he has only been around sometime and he'll be on 45.”The veteran cricketer noted that Gill's innings mirrored Kohli's signature ability to score freely while appearing unhurried.Karthik also touched on the intense competition within India's T20 setup, acknowledging that Gill's place at the top of the order is far from a given.“I am sure he is aware of the kind of players he is keeping out, starting from Sanju (Samson) opening, Yashasvi (Jaiswal) and the rest like Ruturaj and KL Rahul. It's not easy to be a T20 player right now — you need to be consistent, exceptionally skilled and almost play a match-winning knock every second or third game. That's the kind of depth India has,” Karthik added.Karthik believes Gill's growing leadership stature — as captain in Tests and ODIs and vice-captain in T20Is — has further boosted his self-belief.“The fact that he is the Indian captain and vice-captain will give him a lot of confidence. That helps you up to a point, but then you need to go out there and put out the runs, which he has done nicely today,” Karthik added.For India, Gill's evolving balance between flair and focus could be the key as they build toward next year's T20 World Cup.",Shubman Gill scores 37 off just 20 balls in first T20I against Australia.

Reserve Day Rules

Tough challenge for India

NEW DELHI: The ICC Women's ODI World Cup 2025 semifinal between India and Australia at the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai on Thursday promises to be a blockbuster — if the weather allows it. With heavy morning showers predicted, cricket fans across the country woke up with one anxious question: will rain play spoilsport?A yellow alert for heavy rain was issued for Thursday morning across Mumbai, with thunderstorms expected until around 7 am IST. According to AccuWeather's forecast, the morning will see a thundershower in spots, followed by clouds giving way to clearer skies. The chance of precipitation is 55% early in the day, but it's the afternoon brightening that brings relief for players and fans alike.By 3 pm, when India and Australia are set to take the field, conditions are expected to be ideal for cricket — hazy sunshine, 33°C temperature, and only a 20% chance of rain. The risk drops even further to 4% by 7 pm, making it highly likely that the match will go ahead without major interruptions.Still, given Navi Mumbai's unpredictable coastal weather, officials remain on alert. The International Cricket Council (ICC) has already made provisions for a reserve day for both semifinals and the final, ensuring that rain alone does not decide who reaches Sunday's title clash.According to ICC regulations, every possible effort will be made to complete the game on the scheduled day, even if overs have to be reduced. If rain interrupts play, the match will resume from the exact point where it was stopped on the reserve day.For instance, if the game starts as a full 50-over contest but rain halts play midway, it will continue as a 50-over match the following day. However, if overs have already been reduced — say to 46 per side — the game will resume from that revised point.But what if the rain refuses to relent even on the reserve day? In that case, the team ranked higher on the group stage points table will automatically progress to the final. That means Australia, who topped the standings, would move through if the semifinal is completely washed out.And in the rare event of the final itself being abandoned across both days, the trophy would be shared between the two finalists.For now, though, the weather gods seem to be smiling just in time. Once the morning thunderstorms clear, Navi Mumbai should have perfect cricketing conditions — setting the stage for a high-voltage India-Australia clash that could rekindle memories of Harmanpreet Kaur's iconic 171 in 2017.After surviving a turbulent campaign, India are looking for that one magical performance to break Australia's dominance.","India take on Australia in ICC Women's ODI World Cup 2025 semifinal on Thursday.

Shreyas Iyer injury: Greenstone Lobo says Iyer got lucky, predicts comeback

NEW DELHI: India and Delhi Capitals batter KL Rahul recently opened up about his fun friendship with England great Kevin Pietersen , sharing a hilarious story about how their Indian Premier League 2025 banter led him to jokingly complain to Pietersen’s wife, Jessica.During this year’s IPL, Rahul and Pietersen were both part of the Delhi Capitals setup. Rahul had joined the franchise from Lucknow Super Giants, while Pietersen took over as the team mentor. Their playful on-field and off-field exchanges became a fan favourite throughout the season.Also Watch:Speaking on the 2 Sloggers YouTube podcast, Rahul revealed how his wife, actor Athiya Shetty, had teased him after watching a few of their banter clips on Delhi Capitals’ social media handles.“Our banter is different. He is a great sport. He gives it to you also,” Rahul said with a laugh. “There was this video, and there were two-three times where I said something and DC posted it on Instagram. So, my wife was telling me, ‘Why are you being so mean? He is such a sweet guy.’”Rahul added that what fans saw online was only a small part of their constant back-and-forth. “Half the things that he does to me and tells me, that doesn’t come out,” he said.“This is three times that I have given out of the 100 times he is after my life.”He also recalled a funny moment from a dinner with Pietersen and his wife during a trip to England earlier this year. “I complained to his wife when we were in the UK. They invited me for dinner and I told her, ‘Tell your husband to go easy on me. He is very rude to me,’” Rahul laughed.Their friendly exchanges added charm to Delhi Capitals’ 2025 campaign, often giving fans entertaining moments on social media. Pietersen, who had earlier been critical of Rahul’s cautious batting in T20s, later praised him for his fearless and match-winning displays during the season.Rahul carried that form into India’s tour of England, scoring 532 runs in 10 innings with two centuries and two half-centuries, proving his confidence and consistency were back at their best.","India and Delhi Capitals batter KL Rahul recently opened up about his fun friendship with England great Kevin Pietersen.

What went wrong with CSK in IPL 2025

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings ’ young wicketkeeper-batter Urvil Patel gave fans a glimpse of the future this week with a brilliant display of skills behind the stumps — one that reminded many of legend Mahendra Singh Dhoni ’s magic.In a video shared on his Instagram, 27-year-old Urvil can be seen executing a lightning-fast stumping that left the batter stunned. As the ball zipped past the outside edge, the batter’s back foot lifted for just a split second — and that was enough. Urvil, in true Dhoni style, whipped off the bails in a flash before anyone could blink.Click here to watch Urvil Patel’s stunning stumping The clip, captioned, quickly went viral. Fans flooded the comments section praising the youngster’s reflexes, and even CSK’s official handle joined in, commenting,While speculation continues over whether MS Dhoni will return for another IPL season, CSK fans are already seeing hope in Urvil — a player who seems to be carrying the Dhoni legacy forward with confidence and composure.Urvil has also been in superb touch with the bat. Playing for Gujarat in the Ranji Trophy against Bengal at Eden Gardens, he produced a stunning counter-attack when his team was in deep trouble. Chasing a stiff target of 327, Gujarat were tottering at 50 for 3 when Urvil walked in at number three.With wickets tumbling around him, the young wicketkeeper held his nerve, mixing caution with calculated aggression.He went on to score a fighting 96-ball century, reaching the landmark with a crisp drive through the covers. Urvil’s innings of 109 off 124 balls, decorated with 14 fours and 2 sixes, injected belief into Gujarat’s dressing room. He also stitched together a vital 100-run stand with Jaymeet (34) that briefly raised hopes of an unlikely chase.Facing a strong Bengal bowling attack featuring Mohammed Shami, Akashdeep, Abhishek Porel, and Shahbaz Ahmed, Urvil looked unflustered, taking on the pacers with confidence and reading the spinners smartly. However, after he retired hurt due to cramps, Gujarat’s resistance fell apart, collapsing to 185 all out, handing Bengal a 141-run win.Despite the defeat, Urvil’s knock stood out as the highlight of the match. It was an innings that not only showcased his temperament and shot-making ability but also his ability to perform under pressure — a quality that will serve him well in bigger stages.The 26-year-old has already built a reputation in T20 cricket, holding the record for the fastest century by an Indian in T20s — off just 28 balls against Tripura in 2024. Picked by CSK as a replacement for Vansh Bedi in IPL 2025, Urvil has played three matches so far, scoring 68 runs, and with such performances, he is fast emerging as one of the brightest young names in the CSK setup.","Chennai Super Kings wicketkeeper-batter Urvil Patel is emerging as one of the brightest young names in the CSK setup.

Poll Should cricket clubs implement stricter safety protocols in training after incidents like Ben Austin's? Yes, definitely No, it's rare

ABC

A promising 17-year-old Australian cricketer has died after being struck by a ball during practice in Melbourne, leaving his local sporting community heartbroken.Ben Austin, 17, was reportedly training at the Wally Tew Reserve in Ferntree Gully on Tuesday afternoon when the freak accident occurred. According to reports, the teenager was facing deliveries from an automatic bowling machine in the nets while wearing a helmet when he was hit in the head and neck area.Paramedics rushed to the scene, and Austin was taken to Monash Medical Centre in a critical condition. Despite the best efforts of the doctors, he died on Wednesday.""We are utterly devastated by the passing of our beautiful Ben, who died earlier on Thursday morning,"" his father Jace Austin said in a statement.""This tragedy has taken Ben from us, but we find some comfort that he was doing something he did for so many summers -– going down to the nets with mates to play cricket.""We would also like to support his teammate who was bowling in the nets. This accident has impacted two young men and our thoughts are with he and his family as well.""The Ferntree Gully Cricket Club, where Ben played, confirmed his death in a statement on Thursday, saying the entire community was “absolutely devastated.”“We are absolutely devastated by the passing of Ben, and the impacts of his death will be felt by all in our cricket community,” the club wrote on social media. “Our thoughts and prayers are with his family – Jace, Tracey, Cooper, and Zach – his extended family, friends, and all who knew Ben and the joy that he brought.”Ben was described by his club as a “star cricketer, great leader, and an awesome young man.” He also represented Mulgrave and Eildon Park cricket clubs and played junior football for Waverley Park Hawks.Ferntree Gully and District Cricket Association president Arnie Walters called Austin “both talented and popular,” adding, “We will provide any and all support we can to our clubs and cricket family.”Victorian Education Minister Ben Carroll said grief support was being offered to students at Rowville Secondary College, where Ben studied. “We will wrap our arms around them and give them every support they need,” he said. “This is a tragedy that will last many years for that local community.”Austin’s death has drawn comparisons to the 2014 tragedy that claimed the life of Australian Test batter Phillip Hughes , who was struck in the neck during a Sheffield Shield game. Hughes’s death prompted sweeping safety reforms in cricket.Cricket Victoria chief Nick Cummins told broadcasterthere were similarities between the two tragedies.""The ball hit him (Austin) in the neck in a similar accident that Phil Hughes suffered 10 years ago,"" Cummins said.Cricket Australia chair Mike Baird said his heart ""was broken"" and lessons needed to be learned.""Clearly there are things we have to learn from this,"" Baird told reporters.

Shubman Gill vs Jasprit Bumrah in the nets: Exciting contest between star players

Poll What position should Sanju Samson primarily bat in for T20 matches? Opening position Middle order (No. 3-5) Lower order (No. 6-8)

NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer Kris Srikkanth has launched a fiery defense of Sanju Samson , saying the wicketkeeper-batter has been unfairly treated despite proving his worth at the top of the order in T20 internationals.Srikkanth, never one to mince words, expressed his frustration over the constant shuffling of Samson's batting position, which he believes has disrupted the Kerala cricketer's rhythm and confidence.“The guy who's most unlucky is Sanju Samson,” Srikkanth said on his YouTube channel. “He was scoring centuries as an opener. But now they send him everywhere — from No. 3 to No. 8. If given an opportunity, they may send him at No. 11 also! A person like Sanju will naturally feel bad after doing so well at the top, but he has no option but to be tight-lipped and bat wherever the team asks him to.”Since India's 2024 T20 World Cup triumph, Samson has been one of their most explosive openers, smashing three centuries and averaging 37 at a strike rate of 183 in just 13 innings. His partnership with Abhishek Sharma at the top had been instrumental in India's new aggressive T20 template.However, with Shubman Gill 's return to the T20I setup during the Asia Cup , Samson was pushed down the order — batting at No. 5 thrice, once at No. 3, and even not getting to bat until No. 8 against Bangladesh.Despite the inconsistency, Samson played a crucial hand in the Asia Cup final, scoring a valuable 21-ball 24 in India's tense last-over win against Pakistan.Srikkanth, though critical of Samson's treatment, remains optimistic about his future. “The only good thing is he did well at No. 5 in the Asia Cup. It's a good sign because Sanju is now the automatic choice as the first wicketkeeper for the T20 World Cup,” he said.Looking ahead, the former India opener predicted that the XI which played the opening T20I against Australia in Canberra is “more or less the World Cup team,” with Hardik Pandya replacing Harshit Rana.“The team is almost set,” Srikkanth concluded. “Now it's just about getting match practice and rhythm before the World Cup.”",Former India cricketer Kris Srikkanth says Sanju Samson has been unfairly treated.

Suryakumar Yadav press conference: On Shreyas Iyer's injury, his own form and Australia series

Scores:

The first T20I of the highly anticipated five-match series between the top two T20 sides, India and Australia, at the Manuka Oval in Canberra on Wednesday was called off after 10 overs due to persistent rain. However, India did draw some positives from the number of overs they batted before the game was abandoned.After a lean patch with the bat of late, skipper Suryakumar Yadav showed glimpses of his old self in an entertaining unbeaten 39 (24 balls, 3x4, 2x6). His deputy, Shubman Gill, also helped himself to an elegant unbeaten 20-ball 37 (4x4, 1x6) as India raced to 97 for one in 9.4 overs before showers had the final say.Surya walked out to bat with his form under the microscope. The dismissal of Abhishek Sharma (19 off 14 balls) after a quick cameo meant that the Indian skipper was at the crease early.To put additional seeds of doubt in his mind, Surya received a beauty from Australian seamer Josh Hazlewood off the third delivery he faced. The ball was angled into the right-hander, but it seemed to move away after pitching on the surface, and Surya was lucky that it didn’t graze the outside edge of his bat.Despite getting beaten, he showed no signs of being bothered.He took a few steps back, walked towards the square-leg umpire before getting ready to face the next delivery.The next delivery from Hazlewood was a back-of-a-length one on the middle stump, and Surya walked across the stumps nonchalantly, whipping the ball over the square-leg fence to produce the shot of the night. The Indian captain was up and running. Though there was a 40-minute break due to rain after Hazlewood’s over, and the match was reduced to 18 overs per side, it didn’t break the momentum of the 35-year-old nor the Indian innings.Surya was lucky that Josh Philippe dropped a difficult running catch when he was on 18, and he took full advantage of it.He swept the Aussie left-arm spinner Matthew Kuhnemann for boundaries before unleashing himself on Nathan Ellis. He struck the Aussie pacer for back-to-back fours in the 10th over.India 97 for 1 in 9.4 overs (Suryakumar 39*, Gill 37*) vs Australia — No Result","The first T20I of the highly anticipated five-match series between the top two T20 sides, India and Australia, was called off after 10 overs due to persistent rain.

Joe Flacco’s Week 9 status in doubt: What it means for Bengals stars Ja’Marr Chase, Tee Higgins and Chase Brown



Tee Higgins fantasy value drops without Joe Flacco



Chase Brown PPR upside becomes more important in Week 9

The Cincinnati Bengals’ heartbreaking 39-38 loss to the New York Jets delivered a new setback beyond the scoreboard. Quarterback Joe Flacco briefly exited with a shoulder injury, raising major concern for his Week 9 availability. NFL insider Ian Rapoport reports Flacco is dealing with an AC joint sprain in his throwing shoulder, putting Cincinnati’s offense and fantasy managers on high alert ahead of their matchup against the Chicago Bears.If Flacco cannot suit up, Jake Browning would return as the Bengals’ starting quarterback. Browning can operate the offense, but the production drop-off with him under center is undeniable. Cincinnati’s fantasy stars take a clear hit, even in a favorable matchup versus a depleted Bears defense.Chase has thrived with Flacco, racking up 346 yards and two touchdowns on 54 targets since Week 6. That volume fueled WR1-level confidence every week. Browning has shown the ability to feed Chase, including his huge Week 2 performance (165 yards and a touchdown), yet his efficiency and usage dipped sharply in other games. Against a Chicago secondary missing multiple starters, Chase remains a must-start, though with a lower fantasy floor.Flacco revived Higgins’ production, delivering consistent targets and scoring opportunities over the past three games. Browning’s track record with Higgins is far more volatile, turning him into a risky Flex play. The matchup is strong enough to keep him in lineups, but expectations must be tempered if Browning starts.Higgins thrives in contested-catch situations with a quarterback who trusts him, and Flacco delivered that instantly. Without that chemistry, his fantasy ceiling drops sharply even in a favorable matchup against Chicago’s secondary.Brown’s fantasy value is tied to passing-game involvement. Browning relied on him earlier in the season, giving Brown a decent PPR floor even when the offense struggled. Chicago’s bottom-half defense keeps Brown Flex-worthy, although his efficiency and scoring upside drop without Flacco.Cincinnati’s offense immediately loses upside if Browning is forced back into the lineup, lowering the ceiling for every major fantasy contributor. Ja’Marr Chase stays a must-start based on talent and matchup alone, while Tee Higgins and Chase Brown fit best as risky Flex options. Fantasy managers fighting for playoff position will want to monitor Flacco’s status right up until kickoff because his availability could be the difference between a crucial win and a costly setback.Also Read: Jason Kelce’s dad sparks laugh-out-loud moment at Travis Kelce and Patrick Mahomes’ Steakhouse, Kelce brothers crack up on “New Heights”","Joe Flacco is dealing with an AC joint sprain in his throwing shoulder.

The Phoenix Suns and the Memphis Grizzlies are ready to face each other on Wednesday. Phoenix is trying to avoid losing for the fourth time in a row after losing three straight away games, while Memphis is at 2-2. On October 29, the Suns will host the Grizzlies at PHX Arena in an effort to end a three-game losing streak. However, both the teams have a number of important players on the injury report going into the game on Wednesday.The Phoenix Suns and the Memphis Grizzlies will play at Footprint Centre, PHX Arena, on Wednesday, October 29 at 10 p.m. ET. All of the action between the Suns and Grizzlies can be seen live by fans in the USA on FDSSE, AZFamily, and Suns+.The Suns are currently in a precarious position. Jalen Green is doubtful due to a right hamstring injury, and Dillon Brooks will miss the game due to right groin pain. Additionally, due to their ongoing assignments in the G League, two-way players Koby Brea and CJ Huntley will also not be available.On the other hand, due to pain in his left shoulder, forward Santi Aldama is doubtful for the Grizzlies. Vince Williams Jr.'s right ankle impingement might be the reason for his absence. Memphis is still without Scotty Pippen Jr . (toe surgery recovery), Ty Jerome (right calf strain), Zach Edey (ankle surgery recovery), and Brandon Clarke (knee surgery recovery).Early in the season, the Grizzlies have struggled on defense, allowing at least 131 points in their two losses and at least 122 points in three of their four games. They shot 53% from the field and 44.2% from three-point range while shooting 45.5% and 30.8% from long range in their most recent game.With an average of 22.3 points and 6.5 assists over the course of four games, Morant is still Memphis' top scorer. One of the team's rising stars, Cedric Coward, has averaged 16.5 points off the bench, while Jaren Jackson Jr. adds 17.5 points and 5 rebounds a game.On the other hand, the Suns have made a season-high in a 138-134 away against the Utah Jazz. Although they only shot 42.5% and 36.45% from beyond the arc and conceded 10 more offensive boards, they managed to keep the Jazz to 40.7% shooting and 32.7% 3-point shooting.Their star, Grayson Allen , scored 23 points, Devin Booker led the way with 23, and Mark Williams scored 25 points after coming off the bench. Phoenix is 0-3 ATS in their previous three games and was unable to cover as a 2-point underdog.Also read: Scotty Pippen Jr.’s unexpected setback leaves Memphis Grizzlies’ backcourt in precarious flux","The Phoenix Suns and the Memphis Grizzlies are ready to face each other on Wednesday.

This surprised many longtime Dodgers fans who felt it was disrespectful to baseball history.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle arrived in full Dodgers gear, wearing blue caps and white shirts. It is unclear if they paid for the seats or were invited by the team as VIP guests. MLB had posted a video earlier showing the couple smiling and waving to fans as they entered the stadium with security.Some fans on social media reacted strongly, including:@DodgersFan87: “Prince Harry and his wife sitting in front of Sandy Koufax?

Kyle Davidson, the general manager of NHL’s Chicago Blackhawks, had a quiet summer, but his decision for the team looks like a successful one. During the offseason, the Blackhawks really did not make any huge trades or free agency signings. However, a few selected trades and high-profile free-agent signings turned out to be big for the Blackhawks. Let’s take a look at the key moves made by Kyle Davidson and how they have turned big for the team this season.Chicago Blackhawks General Manager Kyle Davidson ’s smart decisions are paying off for the organization. It is the small roster moves, trade decisions, and timely contract extensions that are proving most rewarding for GM Kyle Davidson in the early weeks of the season. One of them is that Davidson's decision to hire Jeff Blashill as head coach, a move that wasn’t initially making headlines, but is now showing positive results.Next, what proved big was his acquisition of Andre Burakovsky from the Seattle Kraken, which has bolstered the team’s offensive depth, and Burakovsky is now contributing to wins and had a key assist in a game against the Ottawa Senators As per reports, Burakovsky played his first game with the Blackhawks against the Senators on Tuesday.It paid off quickly as he made a beautiful cross-ice feed to Connor Bedard, who scored his first of three goals. Burakovsky is now up to six points in ten games.Moreover, his contract extension for players like Ryan Donato was signed to a 4-year deal ($4 million AAV), and younger assets like Frank Nazar and Spencer Knight also received long-term deals, which will kick in for the 2026-27 campaign.After a strong kickoff to the season, the next step for general manager Kyle Davidson and the Chicago Blackhawks are trying to keep the momentum going. They will be focusing on nurturing their young talent and creating a solid foundation for long-term success around their core players. A major task ahead for Davidson is negotiating a long-term deal with rising star Connor Bedard, whose restricted free agent status looms.The deal could be finalized midway through the season, ahead of his restricted free agent status on July 1, but currently, there’s no urgency from either side. Davidson’s primary focus remains on watching his team continue to develop and steadily rise in the standings.","Chicago Blackhawks general manager Kyle Davidson had a quiet summer, but his decision for the team looks like a successful one.

Why are the Colorado Avalanche back on top of the NHL power rankings 2025?

The Avalanche is Just Getting Started | Peak Access

What does the rest of the NHL power rankings reveal about 2025’s top contenders?

The journey for the top position in the NHL Power Rankings 2025 has already begun, and it is a crazily happening one! Just after the first few weeks of playing, the order of the teams has already been changed—a lot!—and the Colorado Avalanche have even soared to the top position. A lot of fan excitement, teams crashing into each other, and no one being able to prove itself as the strongest team are the features of the season so far. Still, the Avalanche are not invisible during the first period of the game.The Colorado Avalanche have won over a lot of people’s hearts with their fabulous 8-4 victory against the New Jersey Devils, not the least because it was the team that some predicted could dethrone them. The play of their extremely powerful offense, plus the return of Mackenzie Blackwood in goal, has made the Avs look like a very strong army that is very difficult to fight against.Colorado’s consistency is even spoken about in Gary Bettman’s league office; analysts are even giving them credit for their depth and energy. The team did encounter a very minor setback of 0-1-3 in their performance early this month, but they proved their mettle with their response, which was nothing less than a champion’s.The Avs are still the team that everyone else is trying to catch, but the gap is so small that it is hardly noticeable.Besides Colorado, the New Jersey Devils and the Winnipeg Jets are still the ones keeping the lookout for the top spot, while unpredictable teams such as the Montreal Canadiens, Utah Mammoth, and Pittsburgh Penguins have taken their place in the top 10 unexpectedly by climbing the ranks. The likes of Cole Caufield and Logan Cooley are giving the fans their teams ' trials to the biggest disruptors in this season.However, October's conclusion does not signify the rise of a definite victor as five teams are still tied in points, which indicates an unpredictable season to come. A fresh drama, a new head, and lots of havoc and chaos are what interest you about hockey each week.The NHL Power Rankings 2025 reflect the early madness of the league perfectly - it is exhilarating, competitive, and extremely unpredictable. Colorado is on top for now, but in such a season, even the strongest can quickly lose their position.Also Read: NHL Injury Update 2025: Why star players like Brad Marchand and Quinn Hughes are missing key games","The Colorado Avalanche have won over a lot of people’s hearts with their fabulous 8-4 victory against the New Jersey Devils.

“He wanted to be the top scorer” — Phil Jackson reveals how his relationship with Carmelo Anthony completely collapsed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/he-wanted-to-be-the-top-scorer-phil-jackson-reveals-how-his-relationship-with-carmelo-anthony-completely-collapsed/articleshow/124915588.cms,"Carmelo Anthony

Phil Jackson’s triangle offense vision collides with Carmelo Anthony’s isolation playstyle

George Karl shared how Carmelo Anthony wanted to outscore Kobe Bryant in the 2009 playoffs

Phil Jackson supports claims that Carmelo Anthony ruined team chemistry in New York Knicks

James L. Dolan faced a choice between Phil Jackson and Carmelo Anthony

Phil Jackson and Carmelo Anthony were never a perfect match. One was all about teamwork, while the other preferred to have the reins.When Phil Jackson introduced his well-known triangle offense to the New York Knicks, he aimed to revamp the system. But what he encountered was pushback. This led to a mix of egos, frustration, and a gradual downfall that defined one of the Knicks' most disheartening periods.When Phil Jackson joined the New York Knicks, he set out to introduce the triangle offense, a strategy that prioritizes ball movement and spacing, which had been crucial to his success with the Chicago Bulls and Los Angeles Lakers. In his book, Masters of the Game, Jackson shared a chat he had with Knicks head coach Jeff Hornacek during the 2016-2017 season.Hornacek let Phil Jackson know that Carmelo Anthony was more into an isolation-heavy game, wanting the ball in his hands to get the most scoring chances. ""I wanted the team to implement triangle offense and ball movement. However, then-Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek told Jackson that Anthony wanted ball in his hand,"" Jackson wrote, as cited in the New York Post on October 29, 2024. This difference in philosophy frustrated Jackson, who saw Anthony's style as contrary to a team-first approach.The disagreement mirrored past critiques. Anthony, a 10-time All-Star who averaged 22.5 points per game during his time with the Knicks from 2011 to 2017, had flourished in Denver's more fluid system under George Karl. Jackson's attempt to implement the triangle, which was somewhat embraced under interim coach Kurt Rambis in 2016, produced mixed outcomes, with the Knicks ending the season at 23-59.To highlight his worries, Phil Jackson recounted a story from 2009 involving George Karl, who was Anthony's coach with the Denver Nuggets, during a private chat. In the Western Conference Finals against Kobe Bryant's Los Angeles Lakers, Karl suggested letting Bryant score 30 points while concentrating on defending other players. Anthony jumped in, arguing that they should focus on defending Bryant.Later, Karl told Phil Jackson that Anthony's real reason was to be the leading scorer of the series. ""'Kobe’s going to get his 30 points and we'll deal with that; shut down everybody else.' Carmelo interjected, 'No, I disagree with that. We've got to defend Kobe first. We've got to throw everything at him.' 'You know why?’ George asked. '[Carmelo] said he wanted to be the top scorer,'"" Jackson quoted Karl in Masters of the Game, as noted in excerpts from Sporting News on October 29, 2024.The Nuggets ended up losing that series 4-2, with Anthony averaging 27.0 points compared to Bryant's 32.4. Karl shared this anecdote with Jackson around 2015, emphasizing Anthony's competitive spirit but also his apparent self-interest. Jackson referenced it to explain why it was tough to fit Anthony into the triangle offense.Phil Jackson supported the long-held beliefs that Anthony was responsible for ruining careers in New York. Back in 2012, during Anthony's debut season with the Knicks, point guard Jeremy Lin's incredible 'Linsanity' phase ended quickly due to reports that Anthony's return was upsetting the team's chemistry.Similarly, coach Mike D'Antoni resigned in 2012, pointing out that his offensive strategy clashed with Anthony's playing style. ""After being with Carmelo in New York, I knew,"" Phil Jackson mentioned in the book that Anthony played a key role, as noted by Bleacher Report on October 29, 2024. The events described in ESPN reports from 2012 established a precedent for the tension that Jackson took on.By 2017, things had gotten so bad that they couldn't be fixed. Jackson had a chat with Knicks owner James L. Dolan and made it clear that either he or Anthony had to go to save the team. ""In his conversation with Knicks owner James Dolan, he said that with his broken relationship with Anthony, one had to leave,"" Jackson shared in Masters of the Game, as reported by ClutchPoints on October 29, 2024.He hinted at leaving after signing a five-year, $60 million deal in 2014, but he only stayed for three seasons. The Knicks wouldn't trade Anthony unless they lifted his no-trade clause, which ultimately led to Jackson stepping down on June 28, 2017.On September 25, 2017, Anthony got traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder, teaming up with Paul George and Russell Westbrook.The Knicks ended up with a 17-65 record in Jackson's last partial season, which was one of their roughest years.Phil Jackson's insights, taken from his personal thoughts in Masters of the Game, wrap up a chaotic time. The book covers NBA history through 75 players, placing this period within the larger challenges faced by the franchise under Dolan. As of October 29, 2025, there hasn't been any public comment from Anthony, according to the latest reports.Also Read: Is Jaylen Brown playing tonight?

Bhubaneswar:





Nearly 10 years after he went missing, Sudam Hembram (39) could be on his way back home in Mayurbhanj district, thanks to the efforts of amateur radio clubs.Sudam, who is mentally unsound, was found roaming the streets of Bangladesh, where he was discovered by social worker Md Abdul Goni Fitu on Oct 20. How he got there continues to be a mystery as Sudam could offer very little details.“Many people have seen Sudam wandering near the Golabari railway station. One day, I found him in a very distressed condition and tried to help him. His mental condition was not good. He was very aggressive. But after repeated efforts, we managed to pacify him,” Abdul Goni told TOI over phone.After offering Sudam primary treatment, Abdul Goni, president of the Humanitarian Assistance Volunteer Team and a resident of Golabari in Chapai Nawabganj district under Rajshahi division, tried to gather details from him.“Sudam was seriously ill when we rescued him. Now he is staying at my home and recovering. From his appearance and language, we assumed he was from India,” said Abdul Goni. He got in touch with social workers from West Bengal through ham radio clubs in Bangladesh and India and found one contact who could identify Sudam.After getting information from ham radio clubs, Utpal Roy from Kolkata got in touch with Abdul Goni. Utpal got hold of the phone number of Sudam’s nephew.He then started writing letters to govt officials of both countries.“West Bengal ham radio club contacted Odisha ham radio club, and one of the neighbours of Sudam pointed out that he was from Jagannathpur village under Badasahi police station in Mayurbhanj district. The neighbour contacted Subhas Chandra Hembram, Sudam’s nephew,” said Utpal, who is the organising secretary of International Human Rights Council, West Bengal.Utpal said Subhas and his family members spoke to Sudam and confirmed his identity. “I have written letters to President Droupadi Murmu, Odisha chief secretary Manoj Ahuja, foreign secretary Vikram Misri, and top officials from Bangladesh and India to help reunite Sudam with his family in Mayurbhanj,” Utpal said.He said Sudipta Ray, head of chancery, High Commission of India in Dhaka, spoke to Abdul Goni on Tuesday. “We hope the Indian govt will take immediate action to bring Sudam back to Odisha,” Utpal added.Subhas (30) said his uncle has been missing for the last 10 years. “His mental condition was not good when he disappeared. Prior to that, he went missing twice, but returned home each time,” said Subhas, who is preparing to welcome Sudam.","Sudam Hembram, who is mentally unsound, was found roaming the streets of Bangladesh.

Remember last season when Taylor Swift basicallythe NFL broadcast every Sunday? From luxury suite reactions to friendship bracelets with Brittany Mahomes, she was the league’s unofficial MVP. But this year, something’s different. Taylor’s still showing up for Travis Kelce , just not in the same all-eyes-on-her way. And insiders say that change has everything to do with security, not publicity.According to, Taylor has made a “personal decision” to keep a lower profile at Travis’s games this season because of heightened safety concerns. It’s not that the NFL told networks to stop showing her, it’s thatasked to scale things down. Sources say she’s arriving through hidden entrances, occasionally shielded by movable walls, and watching from suites where cameras can’t easily reach her.The turning point came after the Charlie Kirk assassination attempt, which sent shockwaves across both political and celebrity circles. Around the same time, Swift’s name had been dragged into extremist chatter online, a development that reportedly heightened concerns within her camp. Not long after, reports surfaced of a trespassing scare at Travis Kelce’s Kansas home, deepening those security fears.Multiple outlets reported that Taylor’s team responded by beefing up security around her Chiefs appearances, adding new arrival routes, bullet-resistant dividers, and additional bodyguards.For a celebrity who’s already dealt with stalkers for years, this was one threat too many.An insider toldthat this decision was “about feeling safe, not staying hidden.” Taylor’s not ducking out of support for Travis, she’s simply choosing privacy over pressure.Even with her lower game-day profile, Taylor’s presence hasn’t gone unnoticed. Fans still spot her occasionally, quietly cheering from a distance, no camera flashes, no headlines, just genuine support.This shift feels intentional and maybe even healthy. After a year ofmania, Grammys domination, and a high-profile romance with an NFL star, Taylor’s embracing something rare for her: normalcy. Her life with Travis isn’t about spectacle anymore; it’s about soft mornings, shared space, and simple joys, a real-life rom-com grounded in reality.Taylor Swift isn’t retreating, she’s recalibrating. After the Charlie Kirk fallout and growing safety threats, she’s proving that even the world’s biggest pop star knows when to step out of the spotlight for her peace of mind.At the end of the day, Taylor showing up for Travis doesn’t need to be televised because the strongest kind of support happens quietly, behind the cameras, in a stadium suite somewhere in Kansas.Also read - Inside Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s rom-com life in Kansas — cozy nights, coffee mornings, and wedding dreams","Taylor Swift has kept a lower profile at Travis Kelce's games this season.

How Guerrero Jr.’s Game 5 heroics silenced doubt and electrified the night

Blue Jays now one win away from ending their three-decade title wait

From potential to power — Guerrero Jr.’s moment of arrival

By the middle innings, the energy inside the stadium had shifted. Dodgers fans watched quietly as Guerrero Jr. controlled the pace, while Toronto supporters erupted with every pitch he connected on.

Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

NEW DELHI: For nearly two years, boxer Parveen Hooda lived in silence. Not the quiet of peace, but the heavy, suffocating kind that follows heartbreak — the kind that seeps in when the only thing that mattered to you the most suddenly stops mattering.The 25-year-old from Rurki village in Rohtak, Haryana, who had once proudly clinched bronze at the 2023 Asian Games in Hangzhou, found herself stripped of both her Asiad medal and the consequent Paris Olympics quota spot. Her world collapsed when the International Testing Agency (ITA) announced in May 2024 that she had committed three whereabouts failures between April 2022 and March 2023 — a violation under WADA’s (World Anti-Doping Agency) anti-doping rules.Her punishment: a 22-month suspension, later backdated to 14 months. Her loss: an Olympic dream she had fought to earn.“Every athlete dreams of competing at the Olympics,” Parveen told TOI, her voice steady but still carrying traces of that old ache. “I worked really hard to get that quota. When the ban happened, I realised all my efforts had gone to waste. It felt like my world stopped.”For Parveen, it wasn’t just about missing a tournament. It was the emotional free fall that followed.Overnight, her name — once celebrated — became entangled with an unfortunate label. She insists there was no doping, no substance, just a simple, avoidable mistake.“It was carelessness on my part,” she admitted. “I didn’t know I had to update my whereabouts every three months. I was in camp throughout the year, being tested regularly. I was angry at myself for not checking my emails. It was a minor fault, but it cost me everything. For two-three months, I was mentally disturbed. You suddenly lose your rhythm. You see others competing while you sit out and you start doubting if you’ll ever return. ”It took months for Parveen to even lace up her gloves again. But eventually, she found her way to the Star Boxing Club in Rohtak — where she began her slow, painful rebuild.At Star Boxing Club, Parveen started small. Simple drills, light sparring, focus on fitness. But then, another hurdle arrived — a shoulder injury that took her out for nearly five months. “I thought maybe this was destiny trying to stop me,” she said with a wry smile. “But I also knew I couldn’t let it end like that. I wanted to fight back, even if it meant starting from zero.”Her psychologist at the national camp became her lifeline. Meditation, visualization and hours of self-reflection followed. “Slowly, I picked myself up. I told myself setbacks are necessary sometimes; they teach you who you really are. I started dreaming again, and my dream is to win a medal for the country at the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028,” she said.Parveen returned to competition at the BFI Cup, where she stunned everyone by winning gold. The smile was back. The bounce in her step had returned. “Winning the BFI Cup was emotional,” she said. “It wasn’t just a medal. It was proof that I could still stand in the ring and fight.”Now training at the National Boxing Academy in Rohtak, Parveen has her eyes on the upcoming World Boxing Cup Finals 2025 — her first major international assignment after suspension. “This tournament will show me where I stand. It will help me focus on areas I need to improve before the Commonwealth and Asian Games next year,” she said.For Parveen, the toughest opponent wasn’t another boxer — it was self-doubt.“It’s natural to have doubts,” she admitted. “I listen to lots of positive talks. Watching legends like Katie Taylor helps. I also drew inspiration from seniors like Nikhat Zareen and Lovlina Borgohain . They’ve faced challenges too, and they kept going.”But make no mistake, the Parveen stepping into the ring now is not the same one from 2023. “Earlier, I used to rely too much on counter-punching,” she said. “Now I focus on landing the first punch. I’ve become more aggressive and smarter in the ring. I’ve worked on my ring craft and my footwork. I don’t want to just survive anymore, I want to dominate.”As she plotted her comeback, Parveen decided to move up to the 60kg category — an Olympic weight division. “I’ve competed in this category before,” she said. “Cutting weight again and again at 57kg was putting my body at risk. Moving up feels right for me physically and mentally.”“This whole phase has made me mentally stronger,” she added. “I take my own decisions now. I manage my own training. I’ve learnt to take responsibility because no one else can live your dream for you.”","Parveen Hooda won bronze at the 2023 Asian Games in Hangzhou.

After spending around three minutes against the Indiana Pacers on Sunday, October 26, Anthony Edwards had to exit the court suddenly due to an injury in his right hamstring. Then, on Monday, October 27, he was reported to miss the game against the Denver Nuggets. With the Minnesota Timberwolves now set to take on the Los Angeles Lakers on October 29, the burning question remains as to whether or not Edwards' playing. He is actually doubtful to suit up for the Wolves against the Lakers.Due to a hamstring injury, Minnesota Timberwolves guard Anthony Edwards exited Sunday night's game against the Indiana Pacers early and did not return. The three-time All-Star returned to the locker room after complaining of stiffness in his right hamstring. He would not participate in the games going forward, the Timberwolves later declared.According to ESPN's Shams Charania, Edwards was ruled out for the game against the Denver Nuggets and will miss two weeks due to a health issue. It means that he won't be able to play in any of Minnesota's next games.Edwards is officially labelled as OUT on the team's most recent injury report, indicating that the Timberwolves will be without their top guard for the foreseeable future.Minnesota is playing the second night of a back-to-back and trying to keep up early-season momentum, so the setback comes at a difficult time.For the Wolves, his absence is a huge blow. The 23-year-old set the tone for what appeared to be an MVP-caliber season by scoring 41 points in the first game and then 31 points in the second. To allow their star player time to heal, the Timberwolves will be inclined to let Anthony Edwards rest for the time being.On Wednesday night, the Los Angeles Lakers will travel to play the Minnesota Timberwolves in a Western Conference matchup. However, their star player Anthony Edwards is not well. In addition, the Timberwolves' injury report for Wednesday's game includes another player. Due to a left calf strain, Jaylen Clark's availability for the game is uncertain.Now, the Timberwolves have suffered a severe setback, and while Edwards is out, Terrence Shannon Jr. and Mike Conley may be given bigger roles.Edwards participated in at least 72 games in his NBA career, including some from the last season. Therefore, it will be difficult for the rest of the team to make up for his prolonged absence.He is shooting 51.9 percent from the field and 47.4 percent from three-point range this season, averaging 25.7 points, 4.0 rebounds, and 2.0 assists per game. He should be able to make a comeback in two weeks and continue to compete for postseason honors.Also read: Is Sam Merrill playing tonight?
