Kevin Gates apparently started LeBron James' beef with a bold comment about Savannah James



Rapper Kevin Gates ’ latest remarks about LeBron James ’ wife, Savannah James , have ignited serious backlash from the NBA legend himself. The back-and-forth feud escalated, starting a new beef after James’ recent heated verbal clash with Stephen A. Smith as the ESPN analyst made comments on the Los Angeles Lakers legend’s son’s NBA tenure. Here’s what went down that sparked the online clash.It all started on April 19, when Gates posted a now-viral Instagram video in which he criticized Savannah’s demeanor toward her husband during games. “He’s one of the greatest players to ever play the game, but I wouldn’t want to trade places with him,” Gates said. His reasoning? “I don’t like the way Savannah look at LeBron. I like the way them white women look at LeBron. As soon as he walks out there, they just be like, ‘Oh oh oh.’”He didn’t stop there. The rapper went so far as to describe Savannah as “the warden of the jail”, claiming she polices LeBron’s every move. “When he go to do the handshake with the main player on his team … you act like I’m bothering you, b—h. I’m the greatest player in the world — one of ’em … and you act like the warden.” Gates said the energy LeBron brings is “so loving and giving” that it “hurt me to see that.”Unsurprisingly, fans and critics alike were quick to call out the rapper for crossing a line, accusing him of disrespecting Savannah and promoting problematic stereotypes. But it was LeBron’s response that truly set the tone with royalty.On April 20, LeBron posted two affectionate photos with Savannah on Instagram, including a caption that left no doubt about how he felt about Gates’ remarks:“Kings don’t concern themselves with the opinions of peasants,” he wrote, followed by a Black queen emoji. “Where to next Queen?!?! Let’s get it!”Still, Gates didn't back down. In a follow-up video posted the same day, the rapper doubled down on his comments. “The truth hurts, but it heals,” he said. “And 'Bron, I love you.” He then added, “Long as you being celebrated, I don't care who don't like me. Long as you being celebrated, that's all I care about.” Even as he expressed his admiration for LeBron, saying that his views were rooted in emotional honesty: “I love LeBron and I hate that for him,” he said.“I know a lot of people gonna hate what I just said,” Gates noted in the original clip. “But I’m gonna be honest, if everybody like me then I’m p---y.”Also Read: “Jokic defense impression” – Shaquille O'Neal’s wild TV moment sparks fan comparisons to Nuggets star James has been under constant scrutiny, primarily for his son Bronny James’ NBA career as many believe that he has made it into the Los Angeles Lakers’ main roster for his father’s influence. James' prolonged feud with Stephen A. Smith was a headline grabber in the recent times and as his back-and-forth clash with the ESPN analyst seemingly ended, the new beef with the rapper puts the NBA veteran in the cycle of unending feud. As for James, he has been very protective of his family and Savannah also grabs headlines for her comments defending her family she share with the King.

From gridiron greatness to emotional vulnerability



When public image collides with private battles



Even the most successful athletes face challenges that stats and accolades can’t capture—and Tom Brady is no exception. Widely regarded as the greatest quarterback in NFL history , Brady's legendary career boasts an unmatched seven Super Bowl titles, yet behind the shine of championship rings lies a more vulnerable, human side he’s beginning to share with the world.For two decades, Tom Brady maintained a laser focus on football, becoming the ultimate symbol of discipline and competitive excellence. But recently, the 46-year-old has revealed glimpses of his personal struggles, particularly in the wake of his divorce from supermodel Gisele Bündchen . Brady, who is usually tight-lipped about his private life, opened up about the emotional toll of navigating heartbreak, admitting he’s dealt with moments of “willful blindness.”This phrase—suggesting a conscious decision to ignore uncomfortable truths—points to the complexities Brady faced in his marriage’s unraveling. While he didn’t name names, the context was unmistakable, especially given recent headlines surrounding Bündchen's ongoing relationship with her jiu-jitsu trainer, who is now widely rumored to be her partner and the father figure in her children’s lives.“Willful blindness” is not just a phrase—it’s a powerful acknowledgment of emotional compromise. Tom Brady’s reflection reveals the cost of chasing perfection on the field while personal issues simmer in the background. The quarterback, once seemingly invincible both in his career and family life, now speaks like someone reckoning with the pain of being left behind. For fans, it’s a rare and raw admission: the GOAT is still just a man.The emotional fallout of watching Gisele Bündchen move on publicly is undoubtedly difficult for someone so accustomed to control and success. Reports of her being seen with her new partner and children add emotional weight to Brady’s recent comments, suggesting a sense of betrayal or at least loss.Also Read: Fresh discussion on Tom Brady and Gisele’s Bündchen’s marriage reignites debate over missed red flags Tom Brady’s recent openness signals a shift—not just for him but for the culture surrounding sports icons.

How Randy Orton can break John Cena's WWE World Title record,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/wwe/top-stories/how-randy-orton-can-break-john-cenas-wwe-world-title-record/articleshow/120519422.cms,"Randy Orton’s championship legacy

John Cena might have engraved his name into WWE history with a record-breaking 17th world title at WrestleMania 41, but it seems his long-time rival isn’t ready to let him ride into retirement unchallenged. On RAW after WrestleMania, just as Cena was celebrating his historic win and taunting fans with talks of retirement, RKO outta nowhere silenced the new champion. Randy Orton’s return to the title picture was loud, lethal, and left a clear message - the Apex Predator has unfinished business.Randy Orton is already a 14-time WWE World Champion. With Cena now holding the record at 17, the numbers might seem distant, but they’re not unreachable - especially with Cena hinting at only 26 more appearances in his farewell tour.Orton’s path to the record could be driven by two key factors: WWE’s preference for storytelling symmetry, and Orton’s revival after a long injury layoff. His recent appearances have shown he’s still in top physical condition, and if WWE is booking a redemption arc, putting him back in the title spotlight would make for great television - especially with Cena in heel mode for the first time in over two decades.With WWE Backlash set to take place in Randy Orton’s hometown of St. Louis, the storyline writes itself. A championship match between Cena and Orton could not only deliver a nostalgic clash of titans but also possibly mark Orton’s 15th world title win - narrowing the gap to just two.Add in another potential run by the end of 2025, possibly at SummerSlam or Survivor Series - and Orton could find himself at 16, tied with Ric Flair. From there, one more world title win would put him on level terms with Cena. A WrestleMania 42 main event showdown between Cena and Orton for the record-breaking 18th title could be the climax WWE fans never knew they needed.While Cena may be in his farewell year, Orton has hinted at having more in the tank. If WWE wants to build one final generational arc, Orton is the most credible and compelling challenger to not just face Cena - but surpass him. The record isn’t sealed just yet. The Viper is watching, waiting, and could very well strike his way into the record books.","Randy Orton is already a 14-time WWE World Champion.

Shah Rukh Khan: The superstar who turned IPL into a blockbuster

Chennai Super Kings (CSK) captain MS Dhoni has revealed the ""most ridiculous"" rumour he had heard about himself.When MS Dhoni exploded onto the cricketing scene in the early 2000s, his incredible power-hitting and remarkable fitness fueled widespread speculation about his diet.Rumours circulated that his daily intake included a staggering five litres of milk, and this was believed to be the reason behind him hitting those massive sixes.At a promotional event in Chennai, he was asked about this year-old rumour. The former India captain replied with a smile: ""I drink five litres of milk a day.""""I used to drink maybe a litre of milk, you know, spread throughout the day. But four litres, you know, it's a bit too much for anyone,"" he added.The former India captain also laughed at the rumour about him making lassi in a washing machine.He said: ""First of all, I don't drink lassi.""The 43-year-old is currently leading CSK in the absence of regular captain Ruturaj Gaikwad, who has been ruled out due to an elbow injury.Having already lost six out of eight games, the bottom-placed CSK will find it extremely difficult to win all their remaining six games to make it to the last four stage, which looks like a long shot at the moment.Dhoni rarely gives his opinion on any issue, but he didn't mince words in dissecting his team's poor batting. CSK have consistently failed to either chase or put up big scores.""I think we were quite below par, because we all knew that dew would come in the second half, and we were in a position to exploit the middle overs,"" Dhoni said, speaking about the lack of cricketing sense among the batters.",MS Dhoni reveals the'most ridiculous' rumour he has heard about himself.

Poll Should the BCCI intervene in this situation involving Azharuddin? Only if evidence is provided No Yes

Huge prediction! KL Rahul would play in place of Rishabh Pant in 2026 T20 World Cup

Former India captain Mohammad Azharuddin has expressed deep disappointment over the Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA) Ombudsman’s directive to remove his name from the North Stand at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium.The former cricketer did not hold back his emotions, calling the situation “heartbreaking” and a “complete disgrace to the sport.”""It pains me deeply to say this, but I sometimes regret having played cricket. It’s heartbreaking to see individuals with little to no understanding of the game now in positions to teach and lead. It’s a complete disgrace to the sport,"" he told IANS.Azharuddin, who served as HCA president from September 2019 to September 2023, said he intends to take legal action and urged the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) to step in.""I am determined to pursue legal action against this injustice, and I urge the BCCI to intervene and take appropriate action. This issue isn’t isolated – Sunrisers Hyderabad also had a dispute with the association over passes, highlighting a pattern of mismanagement and conflict,"" the former skipper said.He further added that the situation has become personal, especially after he was barred from contesting the HCA elections .""What’s unfolding is beyond comprehension, and it hurts me on a personal level. I was not allowed to contest the HCA elections, simply because I exposed the corruption within the system. That truth made me a target,"" he said.The decision to remove Azharuddin’s name from the stadium stand was taken by Justice (Retd) V. Eswaraiah, the HCA’s ethics officer, following a petition filed by Lords Cricket Club — a member unit of the state association.The petition alleged that Azharuddin, during his tenure as HCA president, misused his position by taking arbitrary decisions. It pointed specifically to an Apex Council meeting in December 2019, just a month after he took office, where a resolution was passed to name the North Stand after him. According to HCA rules, such resolutions require approval from the General Body, which was reportedly not obtained.","Mohammad Azharuddin has expressed deep disappointment over the Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA) Ombudsman’s directive to remove his name from the North Stand at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium.

In Delhi Capitals ’ recent clash against Lucknow Super Giants , Pant walked in at No. 7 — a position he hadn’t batted in across his last 113 IPL innings.This was only the third time in his entire IPL career that he batted so low, with the previous two occasions occurring back in his debut season in 2016.The move, however, failed to bear fruit.

Alex Ovechkin dwarfed Ivan Demidov in the playoffs

Looking to game 2: Ovechkin on strong ground with the capitals

An exhilarating Game 1 was played in the first round of the series between the Washington Capitals and Montreal Canadiens, and Alex Ovechkin demonstrated the ability to stake a claim at least for one moment in time on the ice. Ovechkin's brilliant performance, capped by an overtime goal , dashed the Montreal Canadiens ' hopes of a comeback and constituted a defining moment of the 2025 Stanley Cup Playoffs. The night was momentous for the newcomer Ivan Demidov , the latest Russian prospect, who faced his first test against the veteran Ovechkin, after previously making waves by stating his admiration for Evgeni Malkin over the likes of Ovechkin.A night when youth was not served; 39-year-old Alex Ovechkin proved to the world that he is still the undisputed captain of the Washington Capitals. It was Ovechkin's leadership that kept the team in the fight, while the Washington Capitals beat Montreal 4-3 in overtime. His final score was two goals, one assist, and a flurry of big hits. His sudden-death overtime goal became the first in his storied playoff career. Young Ivan Demidov, 22 years of age and gaining recognition for his talent, was under intense scrutiny during his first playoff game. Even though he possessed tons of potential, Demidov was able to play for just 11:57 minutes on the ice.Ovechkin sent out ripples through the hockey world reminding everyone the Great 8 is far from done. In the hours leading up to the game, Demidov made headlines when he commented that he would take Malkin over Ovechkin. Ovechkin likely took that to heart and found a few extra minutes to settle accounts with Demidov through physical play, gently reminding him of the pecking order.The reality of being in the NHL's most prestigious tournament settled in for Demidov. The chances he got to showcase his talent were very few, and throughout the game, it was the presence of Ovechkin that took center stage. What happens with Demidov in the following games depends on how head coach Martin St. Louis views him. Nonetheless, one thing is certain: any success the rookie hopes to achieve in the league will demand stepping up against giants like Ovechkin.The leadership and skill of Alex Ovechkin were put on full blast during Game 1, and in Game 2, the Capitals look to go on from strength to strength in the series. As for Ivan Demidov, this first playoff experience will only help him develop, but right now, legendary status is reserved completely for Ovechkin. Challenges are bound to come Demidov's way as the series progresses, and how he deals with them will, in some sense, define his life in the NHL.Also Read: Alex Ovechkin, the Greatest Of All Time, sets the tone, and the Washington Capitals boys follow itThis brings us to the end, Alex Ovechkin reaffirmed himself as one of the few ever to play the game.

While Tkachuk shrugged off the wisecracks, Giroux voiced different sentiments, deeming those attempts at mocking more like a reluctant compliment to his junior teammate.If anything, the argument to be had was underway while the Senators were barely keeping pace with the Leafs. The wild crowd in Toronto turned their frustration toward Tkachuck with chants of ""Brady Sucks,"" and it was somewhat of a statement. They tried their best to rattle the skilled forward. Tkachuk, however, wasn’t moved by the animosity. “I guess I expected it. Couldn’t care less. I don’t really give a [expletive], to be honest. That’s not going to affect me,” Tkachuk remarked, showing he was unfazed by the jeers.Giroux, ever the supportive veteran, took a different angle when discussing the incident. “No, I mean, in my eyes it’s a compliment for Brady.” he explained. “They don’t do that if you actually suck, so. So, I mean it’s a compliment; I’ve got booed at Pittsburgh before and to be honest, it’s the best games to play.” Giroux’s comments highlight the underlying truth: hostile crowds can often be an indicator of a player’s impact. This might make Tkachuk increasingly important in the game as it apparently makes some of the Leafs' fans very bitter toward him.Tkachuk's well-documented history with vocal fans is something that subjectively doesn't really add up to much. In the past few seasons, hecklers have invaded just about every single home game-witness also included that of a Tampa Bay Lightning game held at the Canadian Tire Centre in 2023, where Senators fans booed their team right off the ice. With all that negativity, Tkachuk is unambiguous as to where his frustration lies: ""It irks you even more when the boo-ers seem to just fuel the fire.Earlier this year, Tkachuk visibly reacted and escalated tensions before the game even commenced when Canadian fans jeered against the American national anthem. After all, Giroux believes that Tkachuk would only grow stronger in the face of such tests.As far as I know, this young star is not at first disoriented by the emotional weight of fan criticism. Whether to go faster or slower, surely, with which some of it shoulders him, that totally irrefutable point remains at odds with the validity of question now: whether Tkachuk will rise to new heights as the Senators approach their first home game of the series or if the pressure will simply sink its claws in deeper.Also Read: Connor McDavid suffered from a lower-body injury, and Leon Draisaitl suffered from an undisclosed injuryIn other words, as a whole Tkachuk has yet to prove his metal on ice, whether in the face of unruly fan behavior or not, to be worth all that faith the Senators put in him. Undoubtedly he will be robust enough to overcome it; that determination will factor into Ottawa's fortunes.","Brady Tkachuk made his playoff debut after a lengthy hiatus.

Shah Rukh Khan: The superstar who turned IPL into a blockbuster

Aryaman Varma , an 18-year-old leg-spinner, was awarded the 2025 Wisden Schools Cricketer of the Year award on Tuesday.By winning this award, Varma, the captain of Eton College, joins the esteemed company of Jonny Bairstow and Jos Buttler , who were the first and third winners of this title, respectively.The Eton College captain's outstanding performance in the 2024 season saw Aryaman take 51 wickets at just over 12 runs apiece with his leg-spin, as well as scoring over 300 runs.Varma was also nominated for the award last year, when he was among the four boys shortlisted after taking 45 wickets. However, he narrowly missed out.Aryaman's family hails from Delhi. His father, Munish Varma, has played badminton for Delhi. Aryaman was born in London but spent his early years in Mumbai, where he and his elder brother, Aarav, developed a deep love for cricket.For the past three years, Aryaman Varma has been a net bowler with the Delhi Capitals .

Golden Bachelor Season 2 introduces Mel Owens—ex-NFL player with a golden heart



The Golden Bachelor franchise has found its new leading man, and this time, it’s someone who has tackled life both on the gridiron and in the courtroom. Mel Owens , a 66-year-old former NFL linebacker turned attorney, is officially set to star in the upcoming season of The Golden Bachelor, as announced by ABC and Disney during Hulu’s Get Real House event on April 22.Mel Owens follows in the footsteps of Gerry Turner, the first-ever Golden Bachelor who captured hearts in 2023, and Joan Vassos, who made history as the first Golden Bachelorette. But Owens brings a compelling journey of his own — one shaped by triumphs, challenges, and a deep-rooted desire to find love once again.Born and raised in Detroit, Owens came from a close-knit Midwestern family. His drive and discipline were evident early on, eventually leading him to the University of Michigan, where he became a standout athlete. His dedication paid off when he was selected as the ninth overall pick in the 1981 NFL Draft by the Los Angeles Rams. For a decade, he built a solid career on the field until an injury forced him to retire in 1991.Yet, Owens’ story didn’t end with football. He transitioned seamlessly into the legal world, earning his law degree and moving to Orange County, California, where he began advocating for clients dealing with sports-related injuries. It was there that he met his first love. The couple married and went on to raise two sons together.However, life threw Owens a curveball. The death of his father came at the same time as the dissolution of his marriage, a period that deeply tested his resilience. Rather than dwell in disappointment, Owens channeled his energy into being the best father he could be — coaching his sons in their sports and embracing single fatherhood with pride and grace.But now, years later, Owens is ready to take a bold step back into the realm of romance. According to ABC, he’s seeking “a love rooted in the simple joys of companionship — sharing life’s everyday moments, making plans for the future and growing stronger together as a couple.” He’s hoping to meet someone who shares that heartfelt vision and is ready to walk hand in hand into the golden years of life.“As the Golden Bachelor, he’s eager to meet someone who shares this vision and finally find that perfect teammate he’s been waiting for in his golden years,” reads the press release from ABC.From the NFL to the courtroom, and now to the world of reality television, Mel Owens has lived many chapters. This next one promises to be just as meaningful — not just for him, but for millions watching and rooting for love to bloom again in its most mature and beautiful form.Also Read: Kylie Kelce shares the only situation where she’d actually let Jason Kelce live separately","Mel Owens is a 66-year-old former NFL linebacker turned attorney.

Jaipur: Rajasthan Royals are facing a challenging period. Beyond their poor performance and reported team discord, the Jaipur-based team now confronts accusations of match-fixing. Following Royals’ narrow two-run defeat to Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) at Sawai Mansingh Stadium last Saturday, RCA ad hoc committee convenor and BJP MLA Jaideep Bihani has raised match-fixing accusations.He questioned the team’s inability to score nine runs in the final over with six wickets remaining. Bihani, who expressed doubts about the loss, has called for an investigation by the BCCI and other agencies. “I have not filed a police complaint. I have spoken to the media and now it’s on the BCCI to investigate the matter,” he stated.Royals vice-president Rajeev Khanna dismissed these claims as unfounded. “The RCA ad hoc convenor’s statement is totally factless and is condemnable. Royals have filed an official complaint with Rajasthan State Sports Council (RSSC) which is our host association and have communicated the same to state chief minister Bhajan Lal Sharma and to sports minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, stating that these kind of baseless statement from a MLA is hurtful and demotivates players who give their best to win games,” he stated.Bihani further alleged that Royals and RSSC excluded RCA from IPL operations, despite BCCI’s initial contact with RCA for arrangements. He criticised the sports council’s stadium management and claimed RCA’s resources, including curator Taposh Chatterjee, were utilised without payment, whilst committee members were denied accreditation.RSSC chairman and state sports secretary Neeraj K Pawan said responded that the ad hoc panel’s responsibility is limited to conducting RCA elections. Regarding fixing allegations, Pawan said, “The anti-corruption team of BCCI sits here before the match, during the match and after the match, so whatever is being said is fictional.”",Jaipur-based team now confronts accusations of match-fixing.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

I can get some get-back: Sean Strickland”Adesanya, humbly, accepted the defeat that came from his bout with Strickland while giving the latter complete credit for his win. However, the post fight activities of Strickland was something that bothered Adesanya to the core“He beat me fair and square in Sydney, five nil. Just whooped my ass badly. That was one of the things what made me realize I need to slow down in my activity. I was fighting 3-4 a year as a champion. So I’m like, I’m gonna pull back now because I’m older. I’m doing things different. I don’t wanna make excuses because he beat me. But then I just wanna show him if he beat me at my best. So, this time I’m gonna come in and correct.”The fighter continued, “Everything he’s done since that… because I used to get bullied a lot as a kid. So he’s an embodiment of that in a sense. He attacked a young me, the inner child. So, I wanna protect him and get some get-back on him”Adesanya reflected on how the trash-talking by Strickland reminded the former of his childhood days when he used to get bullied.Also read: Conor McGregor gets 3-word message from Michael Chandler teasing a comeback fight Strickland’s last bout was a defeat against Dricus Du Plessis.

Pat Cummins-led Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) will take on Hardik Pandya 's Mumbai Indians in match no 41 of the Indian Premier League (IPL) at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad on Wednesday.With only two wins in seven outings, Pat Cummins ’ side is under immense pressure to turn things around. Their campaign has been riddled with inconsistency, especially in the batting department which, despite boasting of explosive names, has flattered to deceive. The bowling unit too has lacked bite, and the combination of both has left SRH languishing in the bottom half of the table.On the other hand, the Mumbai Indians arrive in Hyderabad riding high on momentum. After a shaky start to the season, the five-time champions have bounced back emphatically with three consecutive wins, the latest being a dominant nine-wicket victory over Chennai Super Kings. Chasing 180 on a flat surface, MI romped home with more than four overs to spare — a statement win that underlined their return to form.The pitch at Hyderabad is likely to be a belter.

Poll Who do you think was the standout player in the match between Delhi Capitals and Lucknow Super Giants? Axar Patel Mukesh Kumar Abishek Porel KL Rahul

Huge prediction! KL Rahul would play in place of Rishabh Pant in 2026 T20 World Cup

NEW DELHI: After a rollercoaster run in their last three IPL 2025 fixtures — a loss to Mumbai Indians, a nail-biting Super Over win against Rajasthan Royals, and a defeat to Gujarat Titans — Delhi Capitals finally found stability, cruising to a dominant eight-wicket win over Lucknow Super Giants at the Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow.The spotlight was firmly on KL Rahul , facing his former team for the first time, and the elegant right-hander delivered with trademark composure and class. Rahul played a match-winning knock, anchoring the chase with an unbeaten 57 off 42 balls, laced with four boundaries and three sixes. His fluent innings was a statement — not just against his former side, but also to those questioning his T20 credentials.Adding to the occasion, Rahul reached a monumental personal milestone — becoming the fastest Indian and the second-fastest overall to 5000 IPL runs, achieving the feat in just 130 innings. He surpassed the likes of Virat Kohli (157 innings), AB de Villiers (161), and Shikhar Dhawan (168), while trailing only David Warner, who took 135 innings.Rahul found a reliable partner in Abishek Porel, who stole the early show with a classy 51 off 36 balls. The pair shared a century stand that effectively took the game away from LSG. Porel’s positive intent and timing set the tone in the powerplay, while Rahul played the perfect anchor.Earlier, Mukesh Kumar’s brilliant spell set up the victory. The right-arm pacer wreaked havoc in the middle overs, scalping 4/34 in four overs, including the key wickets of Mitchell Marsh, Abdul Samad, Ayush Badoni, and Rishabh Pant . His strikes derailed LSG’s charge just as they looked to push past 180.Despite a solid foundation laid by Aiden Markram (52 off 33) and Mitchell Marsh (45 off 36), LSG stuttered in the death overs to end on 159/6. Axar Patel and Mitchell Starc supported Mukesh with tight spells, while Kuldeep Yadav chipped in with one wicket.Chasing 160, DC lost Karun Nair early, but the Rahul-Porel partnership took control, and Axar Patel’s unbeaten 34 off 20 applied the finishing touches. Rahul fittingly sealed the win with a towering six over mid-wicket off Prince Yadav.With this win, Delhi Capitals solidified their second spot on the points table with 12 points from 8 matches — six wins and just two losses.","Delhi Capitals cruise to eight-wicket win over Lucknow Super Giants.

There were so many talented players in the auction, so many young players – like Priyansh Arya , debuted and scored a century,"" Raina said.

But when they went to the auction, like you mentioned the big names – they did not take Rishabh, did not take KL Rahul,"" he said. ""Among the youth selected, we can't see any who could give game-changing performances.""As CSK prepare to return to their den — the MA Chidambaram Stadium — for back-to-back clashes against Sunrisers Hyderabad and Punjab Kings, the pressure will be immense.

IPL Points Table after KKR vs GT at Eden Gardens.

Gujarat Titans bolstered their chances of qualifying for the IPL 2025 playoffs following their convincing 39-run win against Kolkata Knight Riders at the Eden Gardens on Monday night. The win maintained GT's foothold at the top of the IPL points table with 12 points from eight matches - winning six and losing two.Delhi Capitals, Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Punjab Kings occupy the remain three playoff spots.KKR, meanwhile, remain seventh as they picked up their second straight loss in the season. They are on six points after eight matches - winning three and losing five. They are still in contention for playoffs but will have to pull up their socks if they are to go through without a hiccup considering the table is tight above them with four teams on 10 points and Mumbai Indians on eight points.Captain Ajinkya Rahane emerged as KKR's primary fight, scoring a determined 50 off 36 balls with five boundaries and a six as they chased 199 runs. His innings concluded when Washington Sundar had him stumped in the 13th over.The middle order's collapse followed quickly as Venkatesh Iyer and Rahane followed in quick succession followed by the same episode with the wickets of Andre Russell and Ramandeep Singh.Prasidh Krishna delivered a double strike in the 17th over, removing both Ramandeep Singh and Moeen Ali, further diminishing KKR's chances of victory.In the first innings, GT skipper Shubman Gill led the scoring with a brilliant 90 runs off 55 balls, helping GT set a challenging total of 198/3 in 20 overs.On a slow surface, GT struggled initially, managing only 45 runs in the powerplay, but they accelerated their scoring afterward. Gill and B Sai Sudharsan, who scored 52, formed a formidable opening partnership of 114 runs.Jos Buttler added a quick 41 not out from just 23 deliveries, capitalising on some fielding mistakes by KKR. However, it raised questions about GT's risk management, as they could only muster 59 runs in the last five overs.","Gujarat Titans remain top of the IPL 2025 points table following their win against Kolkata Knight Riders at the Eden Gardens on April 21.

Shah Rukh Khan: The superstar who turned IPL into a blockbuster

The competition for a spot in the IPL 2025 playoffs is heating up massively, with teams looking to pull off dominant wins in order to boost their NRR. Gujarat Titans (GT) are currently on top of the table with 12 points in eight matches and a NRR of +1.104. Delhi Capitals (DC), Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) and Punjab Kings (PBKS) occupy the second, third and fourth positions. DC have accumulated 10 points in seven matches at a NRR of +0.589. RCB and PBKS currently have the same number of points as the Axar-Patel-led side. However, their NRR stands at +0.472 and +0.177, respectively.Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), Rajasthan Royals (RR), SunRisers Hyderabad (SRH) and Chennai Super Kings (CSK) occupy the last four spots on the points table. KKR are the best placed with six points while the other franchises have won only four points so far. However, every side currently has a chance of making it to the IPL playoffs. Here's a look at what the teams need to do to qualify for the playoffs:Winning two out of their remaining six matches should prove enough, considering they have the best NRR currently. Sai Sudharshan and Prasidh Krishna are the current Orange and Purple cap holders showcasing their dominance across all departments. The Gujarat-based franchise have bounced back incredibly this season following an underwhelming performance last year. GT face RR, SRH, MI, DC, LSG and CSK in their remaining matches.The Axar Patel-led side will need to win three out of their remaining seven matches, having played one game fewer than GT. DC's NRR is the second-best in the league which will definitely play a crucial role with regard to sealing a spot in the playoffs. DC face LSG, RCB, KKR, SRH, PBKS, GT and MI in their remaining matches.The Rajat Patidar-led side has accumulated 10 points in eight matches, making three wins in the remaining six matches sufficient with regard to securing a spot in the playoffs. RR, DC, CSK, LSG, SRH and KKR are the teams they will be facing in their remaining games.Both teams will look to win three out of their last six matches in order to stay in contention for the playoffs. However, they have an inferior NRR in comparison to RCB's +0.472. While PBKS have a NRR of +0.177, LSG's NRR stands at +0.088 with 10 points in hand. Dominant wins will hold both teams in good stead, considering the immense competition. PBKS face CSK, LSG, DC, MI and RR in their remaining matches. DC, MI, PBKS, RCB, GT and SRH will be LSG's opponents.The Hardik Pandya-led side will need to win four of the remaining six matches. MI currently have eight points as well as a NRR of +0.483. They will face SRH, LSG, RR, GT, PBKS and DC in their upcoming encounters.The defending champions are in a tough position following their defeat by 39 runs against GT. The Ajinkya Rahane-led side will need to win five out of their remaining six matches to remain in contention for a playoff berth. KKR are set to face PBKS, DC, RR, CSK, SRH and RCB.CSK and RR need to win their remaining six matches while SRH require six wins in their remaining seven games. The poor NRR of these teams could well prove to be a stumbling block. RR will face RCB, GT, MI, KKR, CSK and PBKS in their last six matches. CSK's upcoming matches will be against SRH, PBKS, RCB, KKR, RR and GT.

Rishabh Pant-led Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) will lock horns against Axar Patel 's Delhi Capitals (DC) in match No 40 of the Indian Premier League (IPL) at the Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow.With five wins in seven games, DC are placed at the second place on the points table, whereas LSG are at fifth position with 10 points in eight games.For Lucknow the poor form of their captain Rishabh Pant is a big worry. He has merely 106 runs from eight games and 63 of those came in a single match. His strike-rate of 98 is also a tad worrisome.On the other hand, Axar too will have some concerns about their skipper -- Axar Patel. Axar has led well and made 140 runs at a strike-rate of 159, but those improvements have masked his diminishing returns as a bowler -- just a solitary wicket from seven matches at an economy of 9.36.This season, LSG have played four matches at home, two each on black and red soil surfaces, respectively. The black soil pitches have favoured the team’s strengths and brought two victories, while the team has lost both matches played on the red soil pitch, which will be used for Tuesday’s game. Rishabh Pant and Co. will be keeping their fingers crossed heading into this one.LSG predicted XI: Aiden Markram, Mitchell Marsh, Nicholas Pooran, Rishabh Pant (c & wk), Ayush Badoni, David Miller, Abdul Samad, Shardul Thakur, Avesh Khan, Ravi Bishnoi, Prince YadavDigvesh RathiAbhishek Porel, KL Rahul (wk), Karun Nair, Axar Patel (c), Tristan Stubbs, Ashutosh Sharma, Vipraj Nigam, Mitchell Starc, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohit Sharma, Mukesh KumarDonovan FerreiraAccuWeather forecasts a temperature drop from 36°C at the start of the match to 29°C by the end, with no rain expected.Catch the match between LSG vs DC on the Star Sports Network on TV, with livestreaming available on JioHotstar from 7:30 PM IST onwards.Rishabh Pant (wk/captain), Aiden Markram, Mitchell Marsh, Nicholas Pooran, Ayush Badoni, Abdul Samad, David Miller, Shardul Thakur, Avesh Khan, Akash Deep, Digvesh Singh Rathi, Ravi Bishnoi, Prince Yadav, Shahbaz Ahmed, Matthew Breetzke, Himmat Singh, Shamar Joseph, Manimaran Siddharth, Aryan Juyal, RS Hangargekar, Yuvraj Chaudhary, Akash Maharaj Singh, Mayank Yadav, Arshin Kulkarni.Axar Patel (c), Jake Fraser-McGurk, Abishek Porel, Karun Nair, KL Rahul(w), Tristan Stubbs, Ashutosh Sharma, Vipraj Nigam, Mitchell Starc, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohit Sharma, Mukesh Kumar, Sameer Rizvi, Darshan Nalkande, Donovan Ferreira, Tripurana Vijay, Dushmantha Chameera, Faf du Plessis, T Natarajan, Ajay Jadav Mandal, Manvanth Kumar L, Madhav Tiwari.","Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) take on Delhi Capitals (DC) in match No 40 of the Indian Premier League (IPL) at the Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow.

Shah Rukh Khan: The superstar who turned IPL into a blockbuster

The writing on the wall seems to getting clearer for defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders . The Knights are precariously placed, having won just three games out of eight. They face an uphill task to make the playoffs from here.Just a fortnight ago, KKR’s highest-paid player Venkatesh Iyer , explaining the team’s gameplan, had said, “We want to be a team which understands the pitch and conditions quickly, to assess the par score and try to make 20 runs above par. That’s what aggression means for KKR.” It hasn’t exactly worked out that way.Things changed quickly thereafter and former KKR skipper captain Eoin Morgan hit the nail on the head when he said after Monday’s loss to Gujarat Titans, “They (KKR) had the same failures they’ve shown throughout the tournament.” The problem is there for all to see, as skipper Ajinkya Rahane and mentor Dwayne Bravo both admitted.“We bowled really well, we faltered with our batting,” Rahane said after the side’s 39-run loss to GT at home. “I think the bowlers, first of all, did a fantastic job restricting them to under 200,” Bravo said. “When you are chasing 199, you expect a good start, That’s what we’re struggling (with) throughout this tournament.”KKR’s winning template last season was based on the blistering starts provided by Sunil Narine and Phil Salt. They’ve tried replicating that impact with three different opening partnerships this season, but with little success. No wonder their openers have the worst batting average this season (19) so far.“IPL is a tough tournament, and when you don’t start well, batsmen go into a period where they lose confidence,” Bravo said. “Form brings confidence. And we, at the moment, to be honest, don’t have that confidence,” a candid Bravo explained.Although doubts were raised about the forms of KKR’s retained trio Rinku Singh , Andre Russell and Ramandeep Singh, Bravo felt slowing down in the middle overs is leaving too much for the finishers to achieve. “Russell is not the only one who is struggling at the moment.When Russell walks in to bat every time, the run-rate is at 14-15. So the work needs to be done on top so that we give him a chance to finish off games like he is accustomed to doing over the years for KKR,” Bravo stated.The team also does not seem to arrive at a settled batting order, with impact player Angkrish Raghuvanshi, one of their in-form batters, coming at No. 9. “We tried to create a left-right combination,” Bravo said trying to explain the batting order.But at the same time he indicated some changes in the coming days. “There is a fine line between backing a player and trying to come up with the best combination. We can try to make some changes, some necessary adjustments to give the team the spark that is missing,” the West Indian saidAlso Watch:",Defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders have won just three games out of eight.

Hyderabad: When SRH host MI on Wednesday, local lad Tilak Varma will garner much attention despite being in the opposition camp.

He is, naturally, pleased that Mumbai Indians are on a roll. “It’s not easy to win three games (in a row), but I would say it’s a long tournament, so we just want to follow our basics and be calm.We want to do the right thing at the right moment. Though we lost four games in the first five matches, the team atmosphere is good and there is belief that we can do better now.” Speaking about the Uppal pitch, he said, “The Hyderabad wicket is always good to bat on, so we’re hoping that it will be a big scoring game again.There are two wickets — one is flat, the one that was used in the last game, and the second wicket is slightly tricky. It takes a little time to get going. We’re ready for both.”Sunrisers Hyderabad ’s assistant coach Simon Helmot said that they are raring to go against Mumbai Indians. “We are a very positive team. We have lots of self-belief. Yes, we’d like the win-loss ratio to be slightly different, but the camp is in a very positive frame of mind.”","Tilak Varma says playing at home is a'special moment' for him.

They have raised expectations only to falter. The fine run that culminated in a runners-up finish last season was rooted in home domination — the Sunrisers had won five of their seven matches at home, losing only one, while a match against Gujarat was abandoned.This season, SRH have won two and lost two at home and also lost all three away games so far. The team seems to be struggling on many fronts, from the indifferent form Travis Head to their inability to cope with slow surfaces.If inspiration is what they need to better their standing of 14 defeats in 24 encounters against MI, SRH need to look no further than their rivals, who have improved their position with three straight wins.
