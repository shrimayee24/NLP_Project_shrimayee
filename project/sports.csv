Kajol Reveals Acting Trick That Helped Her Nail A DDLJ Scene

Bhattacharya is an economist and author of ‘Desperately Seeking Shah Rukh’

Thirty years of ‘Diwale Dulhania Le Jayenge’, the film that invited a subset of urbane women to ‘come fall in love’. My qualifications to trace its journey involve being an accidental chronicler of the economics and mathematics of Shah Rukh Khan and his female fans. For fifteen years, I thought I was interviewing women about how they saw Khan. Instead, I discovered how these women saw themselves and their frustrated attempts to find love and livelihoods.Finer minds than mine have dissected every inch of the film; there is thirty years of discourse out there. Stunning photographs of audiences at Maratha Mandir signal how the film continues to offer escape from the drudgery of daily life. For parts of the commentariat, the romance of Raj and Simran captures India's enduring love affair with patriarchy and caste endogamy. After all, Simran can only marry Raj if her father approves. Raj prefers patriarchal permission games to the rebellion of elopement. Familial regulation of women’s bodily autonomy remains at the heart of the plot. None of the women in the film seem to have jobs beyond loving andcaring for men. Simran writes great poetry but possesses no clear profession. Her girl gang and Europe trip looks fun, until a group of entitled boys crashes into it.Raj most certainly meshes harassment with wooing.The film marks the beginning of elite Indians awkwardly managing the pretense of modernity. In post-liberalisation India, with candy floss and GDP growth in the air, here is the fusion of traditional rituals, wealth and retail consumption.So, in its thirtieth year, what does DDLJ mean? I am not brave or foolish enough to make summary pronouncements on how most, or even many women feel about the film. DDLJ may be one movie, but each of us has experienced it in our own unique way. Some of my closest friends have grown up to be cynical about the love story. “He will grow old to be an unhelpful unsexy Uncle”, they say. They surmise that Simran would be better served by revolution than Raj. Others continue to prefer the promise of Raj’s wideopen arms and sanskari happy endings.For some elite urban women like myself, the film is a reminder of the years spent in the captivity of romantic love, hoping to find the One. We were foolish and privileged when we watched DDLJ as teenagers; we are foolish and privileged in our forties. For women our age from the precariat, it was often the first film they recalled watching in a hall or a screening at home or their neighborhoods. Songs from the movie haunted my fieldwork across India; homebased women workers I surveyed had memorised the film’s beautiful soundtrack.Aditya Chopra fashioned a new masculinity through Khan. He raced airplanes, cried beautiful tears, fasted for karwa chauth , broke Preeti’s heart, helped women with housework and sarees. In the second half of the film, Raj transforms into a man who performs emotional and care labour with elegance and elan. Dialogues were equally proportioned between men and women, a rare event in Hindi films.One scene seemed to stir every fan I interviewed. It involved Simran’s mother remarking on how men would never sacrifice their well-being, while women were expected to give up their desires without complaint. She urges the young couple to run away. Simran is willing and raises this option repeatedly, Raj declines. So many women would wonder about Simran’s fate. If she gave up on Raj or gave up on the protection of her family home — where would she go? Would she risk an honour killing? Could she find safe housing? Could she afford to live on her own? Could she bear the loneliness of her revolt? Would the state or market offer credible protection?Since DDLJ’s release in 1995, the times have certainly changed for women, as has the economy. However, the binding constraints on Simran’s horizons remain the same. In 1994, 23% of urban women held paid jobs or were looking for work compared to 80% of urban men. In 2024, the gap remains significant — 76% urban men participated in the labour force compared to 28% women. Public space and the housing market remains odiously masculine. Rates of domestic violence suggest the home is deeply unsafe. Ten percent of our police force is female.A young home-based worker I followed, with a brief history of running away from home, insisted that elopement was the easier choice for men, more so when their fam-ilies supported the match, as was the case in DDLJ. Since intimate violence was assumed as a fact of life, women would always need a safe place to escape. I heard the same explanation from a posh Rajput woman in an abusive marriage. Abandoning the family would make Simran’s ‘fall back’ position weak. Projecting their precarities onto the film’s couple, these women understood Raj as securing Simran a way home should their marriage fall apart. Where earlier all I saw was capitulation and conformity, I began to see bargains and trade-offs. I started to realise that the calculus of rebellion can look very different for women. There are days when a clumsy regressive Raj feels better than liberal men who find no greater joy than lecturing ladies without ever comprehending our bitter constraints.DDLJ marks three decades of women's complicated relationship with their own freedom, the conformist compromises forced upon some, while happily chosen by others. But much like Simran’s mother, I'm impatient now. I have long given up on Raj, the belief that a handsome man can offer happiness. I prefer a political regime that prioritises liberating Simran to fall in love with her own possibilities. I long for the romance of public institutions that credibly care for women's safety and safety nets. Raj can wait. Come fall in love with your freedom. Jee lete hai apni zindagi.","Bhattacharya is an economist and author of ‘Desperately Seeking Shah Rukh’ The film marks the beginning of elite Indians awkwardly managing the pretense of modernity.

"Gyttja, Caziques, Mbaqanga Scrabble’s now a competitive sport",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gyttja-caziques-mbaqanga-scrabbles-now-a-competitive-sport/articleshow/124681332.cms,"Players across all ages at a Scrabble tournament in Delhi

It was once a gentle, afternoon pastime. But, for an increasing number of players, making up words on a board is a serious pursuit — for which they crisscross the country and even go abroad, writes Avijit Ghosh

Bingo! India has a youth world champion

,

In a chandelier-lit basement of a south Delhi hotel, a bunch of men and women across 30 tables are focused on a board game that seems gender-neutral and age-agnostic. A 10-year-old fourth-grader squares off with a 60+ English professor, and a retired civil servant duels with a young businesswoman. The players take notes, challenge words and, much like chess, press a game timer.But it’s the frequent clatter, much akin to a rattlesnake clicking its tail, that gives the roomy arena its buzz and the game its signature. It’s the sound of the tile bag being jiggled and shaken; that is where consonants and vowels are stored, and from which match-winning words are formed. Welcome to the serious world of competitive Scrabble — once a gentle afternoon pastime, it is now a sharp strategic sport that receives little media attention.Early last month, though, the scenario changed, albeit briefly, when Madhav Gopal Kamath, a class 10 student from Delhi (see box), became the first Indian to win the 2025 World Youth Scrabble Championship. “People were astonished to know Madhav was just 14 years old,” says Harry Bhatia, president, Scrabble Association of India (SAI).Scrabble was invented by unemployed American architect Alfred Mosher Butts during the Great Depression, which haunted the US in the 1930s. While the exact year it arrived in India is fuzzy, senior citizens from English-aware homes recall relishing the game or its variants in childhood.“What we do know is that it emerged as a competitive sport in the mid-1990s in Hyderabad,” says Mohan Chunkath, 69, India’s first national champion. Since then, the sport has gained ground. Scrabble clubs are active in Bengaluru, Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Goa, Hyderabad, Pune, Vadodara, Kochi, with Kottayam the latest addition. From around 60-odd players in the 1990s, India has about 400 registered players now, says Bhatia. Players are ranked and rated on performance. The Chennai-based Chunkath says he was the lone player to represent India at the Melbourne world championship in 1999. That number now has gone up to six-eight.There are more young players on the scene. Vihaan Singhvi, a class 10 student from Jaipur who was part of India’s youth team, learnt the sport from his aunt. “Jaipur doesn’t have too many offline players. I mainly play online,” he says. His sister, Khanak, just 6, is a promising Scrabbler. So is Noida-based Dahlia Verma, 12, who has represented her school at an international inter-school meet.Nine-time national champion Sherwin Rodrigues says domestic tournaments have doubled since he started competing in 2005. “Currently, we have about 10-12 three-day tourneys,” he says, “plus a clutch of one-dayers, making it a packed domestic calendar.”A team-based Scrabble League is also scheduled in Lonavla next month. The KSSA Indian Open, a four-day international meet, will be held in Bengaluru next Jan. Corporates, too, are slowly coming on board, pun intended. “Kids are even putting Scrabble in their college resumes,” says Bhatia. “We are forming more state associations to boost the game’s infrastructure,” he adds.Scrabble is a complex mix of word knowledge, strategy, concentration and chance. Words are loved not for their beauty, but for the points they rack up. India’s top-ranked woman player, Ishika Shivalingaiah, used “roneoed”, in Delhi last week. The word is ‘playable’ and means ‘duplicated’.In the past too, she has used words that would stump most of us. “Gyttja”, for one, which means a fine-grained, high-organic-matter sediment, or, just, “Shh” — to silence someone. The validity of a word can be ‘challenged’. But Scrabble has its own DRS, the all-knowing umpire: the Collins Scrabble Word List, a constantly growing dictionary.Ishika and other Scrabblers also point out that the game is about much more than just employing high-scoring ‘playable’ words to create a “bingo”, the term for any seven-letter word that fetches an extra 50 points. Which is why, as Chunkath points out, the best players are not literature professors, but mathematicians, computer programmers and musicians. “They follow patterns,” he says.Good players practice one-two hours daily. “They must be good at tile-tracking, which means being aware of the letters already played and those yet to come,” says Vihaan. Rack management, balancing vowels and consonants, is another key skill, he says.Nonetheless, an element of randomness is integral to Scrabble. “You have no control over the tile (letter) fished out of the bag,” says Chunkath. But there’s a general consensus that while luck can be critical in a single match, it mostly evens out in tournaments, where every player plays about 25 matches. Attentiveness, too, is vital when you are playing eight games per day, each lasting 50-60 minutes.Simply put, a combination of word knowledge, strategy and attentiveness outdoes the role of chance. “Nigel Richards of New Zealand, the current world champion, is the best because his strategy is unmatched,” Madhav says.Like chess, volleyball and basketball, defence, too, is integral to Scrabble. You play in a way to maximise your own points, but you also block your opponent from piling them up. Madhav recalls being tested in Malaysia against Nigeria’s Abdulqudus Aliu Olawale, who had bested him on previous occasions.“My style is open and high-scoring; He is defence-oriented, a master in limiting the opponent’s scoring opportunity,” Madhav explains. “I had to adapt by becoming a blocker myself.” It was a tight encounter, but Abdulqudus ran into time trouble and Madhav prevailed.Anjana Meira Dev, 61, who teaches English in Delhi’s Gargi College, says Gen Z players are sharper strategists and memorise more. “They can make words they don’t know the meaning of. Which is legal. But we never did that. They also anticipate bingos better,” she says. “They play Scrabble like T20. For us, it is Test cricket,” says Anjana, who started playing when she was six.These days, players also use technology to improve their game. Ishika uses a web app, ‘aerolith’, which offers a fast way to learn words and woogles.io, a free, non-profit online platform for word gamers, which also analyses matches, including the best possible choices you could have made. Madhav refers to a word tool, zyzzyva.Players have taken to Scrabble for different reasons and ended up being its devotees. Ishika, a 43-year-old consultant at PWC, was a former chess player who had sparred against the likes of Tania Sachdev and Harika Dronavalli. She got interested in the word game after participating in a corporate event five years ago. What chess couldn’t give her, Scrabble did: major success.For hotelier Ritu Chadha, the game has been like meditation, her ‘no-mobile time’. “It works like an antidepressant for me,” says Ritu, also treasurer, SAI.Many Scrabblers, like her, are working professionals. Money is invested in, rather than taken out of the game. Prize money is low, sponsors rare, plane tickets and hotel bills footed individually. “Every time, I tell myself I am not doing this anymore. But I end up doing it again,” says Ritu. Then she smiles and says, “I guess I am addicted.” Most tournaments last three days. “Expenses roughly work out to Rs 25,000 for each of them,” says Rodrigues, who plays about five of them every year. The India No.2 won the Delhi Scrabble Open last week and pocketed Rs 20,000. The cost-benefit ratio doesn’t add up.Yet Scrabble thrives, not on prize money, but passion. And, one carefully placed letter at a time.is potentially the highest scoring word in Scrabble. It can net up to 1,778 points, won the World English-language Scrabble Players Association (WESPA) title in 2017. He had represented Bahrain thenMadhav Gopal Kamath’s first memory of Scrabble is watching a game and pointing out how the player had missed out on the word, ‘aediles’, the plural for magistrates in ancient Rome. He had seen his father use the word a fortnight before that and remembered. He was five.The boy could remember well even before he had properly begun to read. When four, he learned the names of 80 dinosaurs from flashcards. “From a very young age, he could concentrate well. We knew he was gifted,” says his entrepreneur father, Sudhir.By the time he was eight, Madhav would occasionally beat Sudhir. “But in the last two years, it has been eight out of 10,” he says. Sudhir is ranked 28 in Scrabble Association of India’s latest official ratings. Madhav is India No.3 — and No.1 among juniors.The Class 10 student of Delhi’s Sanskriti School has bigger plaudits to his name, though. When he became the world youth champion in Malaysia last month, he also pocketed a cash prize of $1,000. He is also the national champion. His ambition is to be world champ. “But I have a long way to go,” he says.“What makes Madhav special is his ability to stay cool under pressure, which is crucial during end games,” says Neeta Bhatia, who was coach and team manager at the Malaysia event.In the Scrabble Association of India (SAI) magazine, Endgame, Madhav spelt out a small list of dream playable words back in Sept 2021. Two of them were: “Caziques” and “Mbaqanga”.

Jan Suraaj Party's Prashant Kishor Drops Bombshell, Reveals Why He Will Not Contest Bihar Elections

Mahagathbandhan

NEW DELHI: Jan Suraaj chief Prashant Kishor on Wednesday announced that he would stay out of the electoral fray in Bihar , even as he seeks to ""disrupt"" the state's power equation that has long swung between Nitish Kumar 's JD(U) and Lalu Prasad Yadav 's RJD .Prashant Kishor, who has served both the NDA and the Bihar(grand alliance) as a political strategist, has set for himself an ambitious target. To replace Nitish and Lalu in Bihar's caste-driven political landscape.But will his decision to stay out of the electoral ring give him an edge, or prove to be a strategic misstep?Rumours were rife that Kishor might throw a direct challenge to RJD’s successor Tejashwi Yadav from Raghopur, the Lalutraditional bastion. The speculation was not for no reason, as PK had on several instances hinted at contesting from the bastion of either Nitish or Tejashwi.But the buzz fizzled quickly, as PK on Tuesday fielded Chanchal Singh to take on Tejashwi instead.Kishor said that the party members asked him to concentrate on ensuring the victory of other party candidates, which is why he has decided not to contest the elections.The moment Kishor announced he would stay out of the contest, rivals pounced. Both the BJP and RJD took jibes at him for ""accepting defeat before the battle.""“Kishor realised that he would not win elections, and that is why he announced that he would not contest polls. Whatever he had invested in forming the Jan Suraaj Party had been recovered. His party is nothing but a ‘vote katwa’ (a party that cuts the votes of others). Jan Suraaj is the 'B' team of the RJD,"" Union minister and BJP leader Giriraj Singh alleged.RJD spokesperson Mrityunjay Tiwary said: ""Kishor has realised that he and his party will face a humiliating defeat in the upcoming assembly polls. That is why he has announced that he will not contest. He has accepted defeat for the Jan Suraaj Party even before going to the battlefield.""Away from political jibes and rhetoric, is his decision truly about strengthening the Jan Suraaj in the polls, as PK claims, or is there more to it?Calling the move prudent, political analyst Kumar Vijay told TOI that if PK focuses on a single constituency, he cannot give time to party candidates.""He has taken the right decision because even CM Nitish Kumar is an MLC. Whoever leads a party needs more time. If he focuses on one constituency, he cannot give enough time to his party’s candidates. He is contesting elections across Bihar for the first time, and being the sole star of his party, I believe he thought it was prudent to devote his time to his candidates,"" Vijay said.Since Prashant Kishore is the lone big face of his party, his decision not to contest the polls has raised questions about whether it could dent the morale of his candidates.""In the present scenario, the way NDA andare fighting elections, they have created chaos in Bihar, especially in the ticket distribution system. This has given a certain edge to PK and Jan Suraaj because confusion has been created by these parties,"" Kumar Vijay told TOI.He also said that PK may not emerge as a giant slayer in the present scenario, but the ""ticket distribution system has brightened their (Jan Suraaj) chance to increase the tally"".In Bihar’s crowded political ring, Prashant Kishor has set an ambitious target of winning over 150 out of 243 seats for Jan Suraaj, calling anything less a defeat. For now, the claim looks like threading a needle in a storm.As Bihar’s campaign battle intensifies, his gamble will be tested against the state’s hard political math, where personality, perception, and caste arithmetic collide. Whether this outsider’s playbook rewrites Bihar’s politics or fades as another ambitious experiment will be the story to watch.","Prashant Kishor, who has served both the NDA and the Bihar(grand alliance) as a political strategist, has set for himself an ambitious target.

Optics vs reality

""Not a sign of disintegration""

A bigger bloc, more arithmetic

Friendly fights and withdrawal loophole

Not the first messy start

NDA's campaign mode on

NEW DELHI: As nominations for Phase 1 of the Bihar assembly elections closed on Friday, the NDA appeared battle-ready, its candidate list finalised, campaign plan rolled out.Across the aisle, the opposition's Mahagathbandhan (or INDIA bloc), led by Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), continues to debate who fights where. Congress and RJD, which are still holding talks, have also declared a few of its candidates for the high-prestige contest.This, obviously, has given a big ammunition to the NDA which has claimed that the Mahagathbandhan has crumbled even before the contest.Yet, despite the optics of confusion, alliance leaders insist the delay signals expansion, not disarray.Congress leader Kanhaiya Kumar, who has been part of the opposition bloc's discussions, said such coordination takes time. ""Coordination matters more than speed,"" he quipped, adding that the bloc’s final list would be announced soon.Congress leader Pawan Khera on Thursday also questioned why NDA was concerned about Mahagathbandhan's deal.Khera informed that candidates were filing their nominations and the procedure for seat distribution was under way. He affirmed clearance on the situation and mentioned that the Mahagathbandhan government will be formed in Bihar.""The work is going on very well, symbols are being distributed. Those who have to file nominations are also doing so. The process has started... Very soon, the entire situation will be clear to everyone. The Mahagathbandhan government is going to be formed. Why is the NDA raising questions? They should think about themselves,"" Khera told ANI.CPI(ML) Liberation general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya dismissed speculation of infighting within the opposition alliance.""People may feel there is chaos in the INDIA bloc. But the delay in announcing seats is because more constituents are on board this time. It’s definitely not a sign of disintegration,” he told PTI.Bhattacharya revealed that his party, which won 12 of the 19 seats it contested in 2020, would field roughly the same number this time.This year's Mahagathbandhan is more crowded than in 2020, when it included the RJD, Congress, and the three Left parties — CPI(ML), CPI, and CPI(M).Now, Mukesh Sahni’s Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) has joined the fold, while talks are under way with Hemant Soren’s JMM, which wants to contest a few border seats.Congress, meanwhile, has released its first list of 48 candidates even before the seat-sharing formula was finalised - a move that signalled both impatience and self-confidence. Among the key names are state chief Rajesh Ram (Kutumba), CLP leader Shakeel Ahmad Khan (Kadwa), and Youth Congress chief Prakash Garib Das (Bachhwara).In Bachhwara, however, CPI’s Awadesh Roy has also filed papers, creating what insiders call a ""friendly contest"", a common phenomenon in Bihar’s multi-party coalitions.Sources within the bloc told PTI said RJD has tentatively agreed to allot 61 seats to the Congress, with some negotiations still underway over high-stakes constituencies.In India’s electoral playbook, such overlaps between allies are common. When alliances negotiate till the last minute, parties often field 'friendly' candidates in the same seats, using the withdrawal window to clean up overlaps once the deal is sealed.The withdrawal window, which opens after nominations close, gives them room to tidy up overlaps once the final deal is sealed. Candidates in overlapping seats typically withdraw nominations at the last minute, leaving only the officially endorsed name in the fray.With the Phase 1 withdrawal deadline on Monday, and Phase 2 deadline on Thursday, several overlapping candidates are likely to quietly withdraw once the bloc finalises its list.This isn’t the first time Bihar’s opposition has walked into an election season with unresolved seat-sharing issues.In 2020, the RJD and Congress sparred till the eleventh hour over key constituencies, and yet, the alliance went on to deliver one of its strongest performances in years, falling just short of defeating the NDA. The Grand Alliance registered win on 110 seats out of 243. Tejashwi Yadav's RJD emerged as the single largest party in the assembly and he was election leader of opposition in the assembly.The Left parties contested as part of the alliance and performed notably well, especially CPI-ML(L) that won 12 seats. Congress secured 19 seats.That precedent might have made leaders more relaxed about the optics of delay.The NDA, by contrast, has its machinery in motion. The JD(U) and BJP are contesting 101 seats each, with allies LJP (Ram Vilas), RLM, and HAM covering the rest.The BJP’s 40-member star campaigner list, led by PM Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, signals a high-energy campaign. Chief minister Nitish Kumar, seeking his 10th term, is pitching continuity and stability, while the opposition bets on discontent, voter fatigue and anti-incumbency.The first phase of voting will be held on November 6, the second on November 11, and counting on November 14. For now, the NDA may have the early advantage in optics, but Mahagathbandhan's late start may not necessarily have an impact on the final results.","BJP fields Samrat Choudhary, Vijay Sinha in first list for Bihar polls.

Can Jan Suraaj really disrupt the two-horse race?



NEW DELHI: For nearly three decades, Bihar has been dominated by socialist forces, with Lalu Prasad ’s RJD and Nitish Kumar ’s JD(U) shaping the state’s political landscape. Since 1990, these two stalwarts of the JP movement have kept national parties on the sidelines. Ahead of the 2025 elections, however, a new narrative is emerging. Prashant Kishor ’s Jan Suraaj is attempting, perhaps for the first time, to challenge the decades-old socialist discourse and offer an alternative vision for Bihar.Kishor-led Jan Suraaj has opened the doors to a third-front contest, challenging both Nitish Kumar-led NDA and the Mahagathbandhan, now fronted by Lalu’s son, Tejashwi Yadav . Notably, Jan Suraaj may be the only Bihar-based party contesting all 243 seats.Could this be the start of a new political mood in Bihar? The party is staking its claim on issues like employment, education, and migration, moving away from the traditional caste-centered politics that have dominated the state for decades. Jan Suraaj can be now viewed as a party of parallel politics or alternative politics, offering voters a local option beyond the familiar two fronts.On being asked byabout Jan Suraaj chief Kishor’s efforts and whether he could challenge Bihar’s two-horse race, political analystsaid: ""Prashant Kishor has emerged as a significant factor in Bihar elections.Wherever he fields Muslim-Yadav candidates, he will dent the RJD-led Mahagathbandhan, and wherever he fields upper-caste candidates, he will impact the NDA. He will certainly be a strong factor for both factions.""On whether his issues will translate into votes, Vijay added: ""The issues he is raising are reaching the masses, but how they convert into votes remains to be seen on the D-Day.""Addressing Kishor’s decision not to contest the polls, Vijay drew a parallel with current CM Nitish Kumar, who also doesn’t contest assembly elections and remains an MLC: ""His exit won’t really affect Jan Suraaj’s experiment or harm its prospects. It doesn’t carry much weight. People in Bihar are politically aware; they will decide quietly, and it’s difficult to gauge public mood on the roads.""This time, Kishor is himself in the fray as the leader of the party he launched last year, Jan Suraaj, aiming for an upset akin to AAP’s shock victory in Delhi in 2015.That may sound far-fetched, yet PK can hardly be faulted for lack of effort. He has travelled across Bihar, drawing on his years of campaign experience for others, and launched an ambitious drive that takes direct aim at the entrenched political class.Fed up with Congress rule in the early 1990s, Bihar turned to Lalu Prasad and RJD, reshaping politics under the influence of Mandal-era dynamics. Lalu-Rabri’s tenure of over a decade entrenched the family-first ethos, but was often criticised for corruption and poor law-and-order, earning the nickname “jungleraaj.”Then came Nitish Kumar, who emerged as Bihar’s longest-serving CM. Yet, despite reforms and initiatives, the state remained one of India’s most backward, struggling with GDP per capita, poverty, and development indicators, creating fertile ground for voters seeking alternatives.A recent C-Voter survey revealed that Prashant Kishor is the second most preferred leader for the chief ministerial post, behind Tejashwi Yadav and ahead of Nitish Kumar, signalling significant public confidence in his leadership potential.Prashant Kishor confirmed he will not contest the upcoming assembly elections, saying this was for the “greater good” of his party. Speaking to PTI, he said,“If I were to contest, it would distract me from necessary organisational work.”He added that Chanchal Singh will contest against Tejashwi Yadav in Raghopur instead.Kishor’s own prediction is audacious: “I can say with certainty that we will either win handsomely or receive a drubbing. I have been stating on record that I expect a tally of either fewer than 10 seats or more than 150 seats. There is no possibility of anything in between.”Despite stepping aside, he exudes confidence: “We will either win handsomely or face a complete drubbing. There’s no middle ground. A tally below 150 will be a defeat for me.”The reactions from rival parties have been scathing. RJD claimed Kishor has “accepted defeat for his Jan Suraaj Party even before going to the battlefield,” while BJP said, “Kishor realised he would not win elections.” JD(U) called it a “humiliation for his party workers.”RJD’s Mrityunjay Tiwary said, “Kishor’s tyre has been flattened,” BJP’s Niraj Kumar added, “his bubble burst even before the elections,” and JD(U)’s Neeraj Kumar said, “He has run away before the electoral battle.” Union minister Giriraj Singh mocked the venture as “Mungerilal ke haseen sapne,” calling Jan Suraaj a “vote katwa” and “RJD’s B team.”Observers note that PK’s Brahmin background and leadership style could appeal to upper-caste youth who feel excluded in Bihar politics. Yet the state’s political structure remains largely bipolar, meaning Jan Suraaj risks being seen as a spoiler rather than a serious contender.A top poll strategist-turned-politician has surprisingly opted out of contesting his party’s first election, raising questions about his approach.While NDA has mostly finalised seat-sharing, the Mahagathbandhan’s candidate announcements remain a bit indecisive on some seats over seat-sharing discussions.Bihar now faces not just an RJD vs JD(U)/NDA battle, but a potential challenge from Jan Suraaj, testing voter appetite for a new political alternative.","Prashant Kishor's Jan Suraaj is attempting, perhaps for the first time, to challenge the decades-old socialist discourse. The party is staking its claim on issues like employment, education, and migration, moving away from the traditional caste-centered politics that have dominated the state.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124665350,imgsize-774153,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-55.jpg"

Bihar Polls: UP CM Yogi Adityanath Accuses RJD, Congress of ‘Mischief’ Over Burqa Verification Order

NEW DLEHI: Janhit Janata Dal (JJD) chief and Lalu Yadav ’s elder son Tej Pratap Yadav , who is set to contest from Mahua constituency in the upcoming Bihar Assembly elections , filed his nomination on Thursday accompanied by a roadshow and carrying a photo of his grandmother Marchiya Devi.Speaking to reporters, he said the occasion was significant for him as he had moved ahead with the blessings of his grandmother and parents.""I have moved ahead with the blessings of my grandmother and my parents. On this auspicious occasion, as I am required to file my nomination, I have brought my grandmother with me. She lives on in our hearts... People of Mahua will support whoever works for them. I worked to make Mahua a district and also give employment opportunities to the youth,"" Tej Pratap said, as quoted by ANI.Tej Pratap, who currently represents Hasanpur, had earlier served as Mahua MLA from 2015 to 2020. The seat is now held by RJD’s Mukesh Kumar Raushan.The JJD, which Tej Pratap floated after his expulsion from the RJD earlier this year, has announced 22 candidates in its first list for the assembly elections scheduled for November. His expulsion from the party followed a controversy involving a social media post where he claimed to be in a long-term relationship.Tej Pratap had later stated that his account was hacked.His strained ties with his family have played out publicly in recent months. On October 12, he unfollowed his younger brother and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav on X. He had earlier unfollowed his sisters Misa Bharti and Hema Yadav. He now follows only five accounts, including his father Lalu Prasad Yadav, mother Rabri Devi, and sister Raj Lakshmi Yadav.Despite family tensions, Tej Pratap’s sister Rohini Acharya extended her support to him with a message on X: ""May you achieve all the success and happiness in the world, and may you always move forward like a shining light, brother. Wishing you all the very best... with love and blessings.""It makes an interesting twist in the Yadav family dynamics, as last month Rohini Acharya did something similar to his elder brother Tej Pratap when she unfollowed RJD, and Tejaswi Yadav from her social media accounts. The increasing rifts between family members playing out in public are often attributed to sudden importance given to Sanjay Yadav, a close friend to Tejaswi.On being asked about the grandmother and Acharya he said, ""I brought the photo of my grandmother Marchiya Devi in the nomination. With her blessing, I am going to win in Mahua. The Janshakti Janata Dal is going to win. Rohini Acharya called me, she extended her good wishes.""The Bihar Assembly elections will take place in two phases on November 6 and November 11, with counting scheduled for November 14. The main contest is expected between the NDA alliance led by BJP-JD(U) and the INDIA bloc led by RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav. JJD is among the new entrants in the fray, alongside Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj, which has announced plans to contest all 243 seats.",Lalu Yadav's elder son Tej Pratap Yadav filed his nomination for Bihar Assembly elections.

How a social media rumor spiraled out of control

Super Bowl SHOCK: Turning Point USA Plots Its OWN Halftime Show Amid Bad Bunny Drama

Adam Sandler remains focused on comedy and film, not politics

A bizarre viral rumor suggesting that Adam Sandler was set to perform at Turning Point USA’s All-American Halftime Show has officially been debunked. The claim, which spread rapidly across Facebook and X (formerly Twitter), alleged that the comedian would headline a rival event to the Super Bowl halftime show, but fact-checkers and sources close to Sandler have confirmed that the story is entirely fabricated.The rumor began earlier this week after a series of misleading Facebook posts claimed that “Adam Sandler will join Lara Trump at the Turning Point USA halftime show.” The posts racked up thousands of shares within hours, with users debating whether Sandler had shifted toward political performances. However, no reputable news outlet, nor Turning Point USA itself, ever announced his involvement.According to media watchdog Primetimer, the rumor stemmed from a manipulated headline that mixed genuine coverage of Lara Trump’s recent offer to perform at the event with false claims about Sandler’s participation. The viral graphic even used a photo of Sandler from his Netflix stand-up special, adding to the illusion of authenticity.Fact-checkers later confirmed that Sandler has no known ties to Turning Point USA or its founder Charlie Kirk , and he has never publicly expressed interest in performing at political events.In reality, Adam Sandler’s current schedule is packed with promotional appearances for his upcoming Netflix sequel “Happy Gilmore 2” and a new family comedy project set for release in 2026.Sources close to the actor emphasized that he’s steering clear of politically charged platforms. “He’s focused on creative projects and touring, not partisan events,” one insider told Primetimer.This isn’t the first time Sandler has been the subject of viral misinformation. Earlier this year, fake posts alleged that he had exchanged texts with Charlie Kirk and criticized late-night host Jimmy Kimmel, both of which were later proven false.Also Read: Will Jennifer Lopez join Bad Bunny at the Super Bowl halftime show?

Carter Hart drops a bold message to Mitch Marner and his new Golden Knights teammates upon his long-awaited return,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/carter-hart-drops-a-bold-message-to-mitch-marner-and-his-new-golden-knights-teammates-upon-his-long-awaited-return/articleshow/124619497.cms,"Carter Hart opens up on Golden Knights move (AP Photos)

Carter Hart’s next chapter with the Golden Knights





Golden Knights stand by their decision





Carter Hart is officially back in the NHL , and the Vegas Golden Knights have secured a goalie who once held the spotlight in Philadelphia. The 27-year-old goaltender has signed a professional tryout contract (PTO) with the team, setting the stage for a mid-season return. After months away from the league, Hart is ready to prove himself once again, telling the Las Vegas Review–Journal, “I’ve learned a lot. I’ve grown a lot. I’m ready to move on. I’m excited to get out in the community and show my true character.”Though Carter Hart’s comeback has drawn mixed reactions from fans, his talent is undeniable. Vegas expects him to strengthen an already formidable goaltending room alongside Mitch Marner. While Hart won’t be eligible to play until December 1, the team has ample time to get him back into top form. The Golden Knights could debut him against the Chicago Blackhawks on December 3, or perhaps schedule a dramatic return in Philadelphia on December 11. Either way, expectations are high for a goalie eager to leave past struggles behind.Hart’s career with the Flyers saw highs and lows. Drafted 48th overall in 2016, he amassed a 96-93-29 record with a 2.94 goals-against average and a .906 save percentage, including six shutouts.Yet his last NHL outing in January 2024, where he allowed five goals against the Colorado Avalanche, left fans questioning his consistency. Now reinstated by the NHL and signed for a PTO with Vegas, Hart has a chance to redefine his legacy.Vegas faced criticism for bringing Hart aboard, but the organization emphasized their commitment to core values. A team statement highlighted alignment with the NHL and NHLPA’s process, noting, “We remain committed to the core values that have defined our organization from its inception and expect that our players will continue to meet these standards moving forward.” With a fresh start and clear support, Hart’s journey with the Golden Knights promises to be both closely watched and deeply compelling.Hart’s story is one of resilience, growth, and the pursuit of redemption. As the calendar flips to December, all eyes will be on him to see if he can recapture the form that once made him a rising star in the NHL.Also Read: Connor McDavid leads the way as Oilers rookie Matt Savoie reveals candid thoughts on playing with NHL legends","Carter Hart is officially back in the NHL with the Vegas Golden Knights.

She said,""I'll speak for myself when I say that the decisions that he was making hurt me about his cancer. It felt like, 'Oh, you're trying to kill me. And I'm going to be alone raising these kids. It's a very selfish response that I had, and it caused all kinds of problems, but [so did] his need for secrecy about his cancer decisions. It just starts sowing the seeds of distrust.""After coming across the life-threatening tumor in Wade’s kidney, Gabrielle Union felt as if the NBA icon was almost near to death. She explained that the Miami Heat's alum was trying to leave her behind all alone raising the kids herself. Gabrielle Union admitted that she had serious trust issues with her husband Dwyane Wade.

Gabrielle Union said,“It was year nine of our marriage and ... year nine was very hard. When you mention year nine being hard, he hadn’t revealed his cancer diagnosis and his own cancer journey, so now we can put it in more context.”She further elaborated,""Obviously him getting that diagnosis was traumatic for him: Being faced with your own mortality in your early 40s, and you’re like, ‘Am I going to be here to see my family? Who am I without this big life, and without this healthy body? But you also don’t understand the journey and the toll that it takes on your marriage, on your family, on your kids.”After being married for 11 long years, Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union share a daughter named Kaavia via surrogacy.

Why This Trade Could Work for Both Teams

Key Trade Implications

Theare reportedly exploring a blockbuster move that could redefine the franchise’s future. According to Fansided’s Matt Moore, the team may consider parting ways with long-time defensive anchor Draymond Green to acquire- a player with a massive $175 million contract and generational talent.After a quiet offseason, the Golden State Warriors ’ biggest addition has been veteran forward Al Horford, making them one of the oldest teams in NBA history. Despite that, the front office remains confident that Stephen Curry can still lead the franchise to another deep playoff run.The organization is reportedly waiting until midseason to determine whether this current roster can keep pace with the Western Conference elite. If they prove competitive, major trade talks could intensify before the deadline.“You fundamentally reshape your entire future instead of trying to sneak out one more title. It buys you time to reconfigure and extend your success and avoid a post-Steph rebuild,” Matt Moore said Monday. (H/t: Sporting News)Moore’s statement highlights what could be a defining moment for Golden State - choosing between loyalty to its core and building for the next era.Moore’s trade scenario involves the Golden State Warriors sending several key assets to Milwaukee in exchange for Giannis Antetokounmpo This trade would mean Golden State parting with a franchise icon and its young depth - a steep price even for a two-time MVP. However, pairing Giannis with Curry could immediately catapult the Golden State Warriors back into title contention.The addition of stretch big men like Quinten Post and Al Horford gives the Golden State Warriors more spacing than in previous seasons, allowing Giannis to dominate inside without clogging the floor. His explosive playstyle could perfectly complement Curry’s perimeter shooting, creating one of the most dynamic duos in NBA history.For Milwaukee, the move represents a potential reset. The Bucks have struggled recently despite Giannis’s brilliance, and a package featuring young talents like Moody and Podziemski, along with multiple first-round picks, offers a clear path toward rebuilding.• For the Warriors: A chance to extend their championship window beyond the Curry era• For the Bucks: Long-term assets and flexibility to reshape their roster• For Draymond Green: The possible end of a legendary run with Golden StateTrading Draymond Green - a four-time champion and defensive cornerstone - would be one of the toughest decisions in franchise history. Yet as Moore points out, “You can’t justify moving one of your franchise icons for almost any player. Giannis is not just any player.”Should the trade be completed, it would both end an era and start a new one centered on Giannis Antetokounmpo and Stephen Curry. Additionally, it would be remembered as one of the most significant moves in NBA history.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors Could Limit $8.6 Million Star’s Minutes as Veteran Core Takes Priority in New Season The Golden State Warriors’ front office faces a defining test this season: stay loyal to a proven core or risk it all for a once-in-a-generation superstar.

Who is Shannon Kobylarczyk?



Milwaukee Brewers 'Karen' Fired By Employer After 'Racist' Rant Against LA Dodgers Fan Goes Viral

Exploring Shannon Kobylarczyk's controversy



Did Shannon Kobylarczyk lose her job?



What did MLB say about the Shannon Kobylarczyk controversy?



The Milwaukee Brewers’ National League Championship Series clash with the Los Angeles Dodgers took a sharp turn off the field when a video from Game 2 went viral for all the wrong reasons. A heated exchange between Brewers fan Shannon Kobylarczyk and Dodgers supporter Ricardo Fosado turned into a national talking point after Kobylarczyk was seen making a racially charged remark. Within days, she lost her job, resigned from a charitable board, and was banned from American Family Field.Shannon Kobylarczyk, a Milwaukee-based attorney, worked at ManpowerGroup, a global staffing firm, and also served on the Make-A-Wish Wisconsin board of directors. Until last week, she was largely unknown outside professional circles. That changed during Game 2 of the NLCS on October 14, when she became the center of an online firestorm.The game, played in Milwaukee, had started as a typical postseason battle — the Brewers took an early lead before the Dodgers surged ahead. Amid the excitement, Fosado, a Los Angeles fan and U.S. Navy veteran, began recording the crowd’s reaction after a Dodgers home run.In his clip, Kobylarczyk can be heard mocking him, yelling, “Real men drink beer, p***y!” Moments later, she tapped another fan and said, “You know what, let’s call ICE. ”Fosado, calm but defiant, replied, “Call ICE. Call ICE. I’m a U.S. citizen, war veteran, baby girl. War veteran, two wars. ICE is not gonna do nothing to me. Good luck.”The exchange escalated, leading to Fosado’s removal from the stadium after Kobylarczyk reported him to security. However, the story didn’t end there, it was only beginning.The viral video, viewed more than 2 million times, quickly drew outrage online. Many criticized Kobylarczyk for using an anti-immigrant remark, especially toward a Latino veteran. The Brewers soon confirmed that both fans were banned from American Family Field due to “offensive statements” and “physical confrontation.”In a statement, the team said, “The Brewers expect all persons attending games to be respectful of each other, and we do not condone in any way offensive statements fans make to each other about race, gender, or national origin.” They emphasized their commitment to maintaining a “safe and enjoyable experience” for all fans.The fallout was swift. ManpowerGroup announced that Kobylarczyk had been placed on leave and later terminated. “As soon as we became aware of this video the individual was placed on immediate leave and we began an investigation,” the company said. “As a result of this process, the employee is no longer with the organization. We remain committed to maintaining a culture grounded in respect, integrity, and accountability. ”She also resigned from Make-A-Wish Wisconsin’s board. The nonprofit confirmed, “Shannon Kobylarczyk resigned from our board of directors this afternoon effective immediately. Make-A-Wish Wisconsin does not condone nor agree with Kobylarczyk’s words and actions.”Major League Baseball and the Brewers shared that such behavior violates league standards. The Milwaukee Police Department also became involved, citing Fosado for disorderly conduct and intoxication, though he wasn’t charged. Both fans, the Brewers said, are barred “from returning to the ballpark for future events.”Interestingly, Fosado himself showed grace toward Kobylarczyk despite the confrontation. Speaking to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, he said, “I don’t think it was like horrible or something that should get her fired. I feel bad for her. We cannot be judged on one mistake, and a lot of emotions were involved.”For Fosado, the night ended on a surprisingly positive note. “This is my first time at a Brewers game and I got kicked out, but you know what? I had a great experience and everybody was really friendly and welcoming,” he said.The viral moment dubbed Kobylarczyk “Brewers Karen” online.Also Read: Brewers 'Karen' fired after viral video identifies her as Shannon Kobylarczyk in racist rant at Dodgers supporter and U.S. war veteran","Shannon Kobylarczyk, a Milwaukee-based attorney, worked at ManpowerGroup, a global staffing firm.

Saints want to keep Chris Olave long-term not trade him

Titans open to trading nearly everyone except Jeffery Simmons and rookie QB Cam Ward

Eagles shopping for EDGE and cornerback help but A.J. Brown isn’t going anywhere

Jets, Dolphins, and Bengals fielding calls on big defensive names



Chiefs, Cowboys, and Jaguars hunting for defensive reinforcements

The NFL trade deadline is still a little way off, but insider Dianna Russini just turned the volume up with her latest scoop. According to her post on X, front offices across the league are already in overdrive, from the Saints working on a long-term deal with Chris Olave to the Titans reportedly willing to move nearly everyone not named Jeffery Simmons. Add in the Eagles searching for defensive reinforcements and the Chiefs quietly shopping for linemen, and you’ve got all the makings of a spicy trade season ahead.Forget the trade chatter, the New Orleans Saints reportedly want to keep Chris Olave in black and gold for years to come. Russini noted that the Saints and Olave are trying to work out a long-term extension ahead of schedule, which makes perfect sense given his early production. Olave, still on his rookie deal, has been one of the team’s few bright spots in an otherwise inconsistent offense. This move signals that New Orleans is doubling down on building around its young star instead of shopping him at the deadline.Over in Tennessee, the Titans appear ready to clean house. According to Russini, they’re open to trade discussions on almost everyone except star defensive tackle Jeffery Simmons and rookie quarterback Cam Ward.After several seasons of middling results and roster churn, Tennessee looks ready to rebuild around Simmons’ dominance in the trenches and Ward’s potential as the team’s new face. Expect calls to keep coming in on veteran assets as they reshape the roster.In Philadelphia, Russini reports that the Eagles are working the phones for help at EDGE and cornerback, a classic Howie Roseman move as the team eyes another postseason run. But here’s the key line: they’ve rejected all calls on star receiver A.J. Brown. That’s no surprise. Brown is a core part of Philly’s offensive identity, and the team’s defense has been its main area of concern this season.Elsewhere in the AFC, phones are buzzing. Russini says the Dolphins have received calls about edge rushers Bradley Chubb and Jaelan Phillips, while the Jets are getting interest in running back Breece Hall and linebacker Jermaine Johnson. Neither team seems eager to deal, but it shows how high those players’ values are league-wide. Meanwhile, the Bengals reportedly aren’t trading Trey Hendrickson, ending speculation that their top pass rusher could be on the move. It’s a smart call, Cincinnati can’t afford to lose its defensive anchor as they fight for playoff positioning.Russini also noted that Kansas City is shopping for defensive linemen, though not for a running back signaling confidence in their current backfield. The Cowboys and Jaguars are similarly searching for defensive upgrades to solidify their playoff chances. Add in Detroit reportedly looking for an edge rusher and Indianapolis eyeing help at cornerback, and you get a clear theme: contenders are gearing up for the second half of the season, and defense is the name of the game.If Dianna Russini’s thread is any indication, the 2025 NFL trade deadline could be pure chaos. Teams like the Saints and Eagles are locking in stars, while others like the Titans and Chiefs are wide open for business. As the deadline approaches, expect rumors to swirl, deals to heat up, and a few blockbuster surprises that no one sees coming. It’s shaping up to be a wild couple of weeks in the NFL.Also read - Dolphins vs. Browns Week 7 faces hurricane-level winds and nonstop rain prediction","The NFL trade deadline is still a little way off, but insider Dianna Russini just turned the volume up with her latest scoop.

How Mike Evans’ Hamstring injury could impact Buccaneers vs. Lions in week 7



Balancing performance and health: Mike Evans’ role in Buccaneers’ key matchup



Todd Bowles on Mike Evans Returning to Practice | Press Conference | Tampa Bay Buccaneers

Tampa Bay Buccaneers fans are eagerly awaiting the return of star wide receiver Mike Evans as the team prepares to face the Detroit Lions on Monday Night Football. After missing three weeks due to a hamstring injury, Evans’ expected Week 7 return is a major boost for the Bucs’ offense, but it comes with significant injury concerns.Evans sat out Friday’s practice as part of a planned recovery but is expected back on the field Saturday, putting him on track to play against Detroit. Despite this, medical experts, including social media doctor Deepak Chona, warn of a “high re-injury risk,” which is common with hamstring injuries. Such injuries are delicate and can easily flare up if the player is pushed too hard too soon.The timing of Evans’ return is critical. With teammates Chris Godwin and Emeka Egbuka sidelined, Evans is likely to carry a heavier workload immediately. Unlike a gradual return, he will have to perform at full intensity from the start, increasing the likelihood of another hamstring issue. For Evans, maintaining his streak of 1,000-yard seasons is a top priority, adding pressure to his comeback.Tampa Bay’s receiving depth further highlights Evans’ importance. Without him, the Bucs may have to rely on Sterling Shepard, Tez Johnson, and Kameron Johnson as their top receivers, a scenario that could hinder the team against a strong Detroit defense.Evans’ presence ensures the offense remains competitive and gives quarterback the reliable target needed for high-pressure situations.The Buccaneers face a delicate balance between immediate performance and long-term health. Evans’ return could turn the game in their favor, but careful management is essential to prevent setbacks that could impact the rest of the season. Monitoring his snap count, route assignments, and overall performance will be critical to ensure he handles the workload without aggravating his hamstring.Mike Evans’ anticipated return on Monday Night Football is a key storyline in the NFL, emphasizing both the high stakes of player health and the impact of star talent on team success. For Tampa Bay, having Evans back could be the difference between a win and a tough loss, making this Week 7 matchup one of the most-watched games of the season.Also Read: Justin Herbert and Madison Beer: 2025’s Hottest new couple striking the perfect balance everyone’s talking about","Mike Evans set to return for Buccaneers vs Lions despite hamstring risk.

'Unfair at this stage!': Virat Kohli's childhood coach on the treatment of senior duo Virat-Rohit

Poll What do you think about Virat Kohli's transition to focusing on a single format of cricket? It's a smart move for his career He should play all formats It will help him maintain peak fitness I don't think it matters

In a candid chat with Ravi Shastri and Adam Gilchrist on Fox Cricket, Virat Kohli opened up about his life after retiring from Test cricket, his fitness goals, and how he’s rediscovering balance after nearly two decades of relentless cricket.“Yeah, I mean, look, it’s been a long time off for me since I retired from Test cricket,” Kohli said.“And yeah, as I was just catching up on life. You know, I haven’t been able to do anything for the last, I don’t know how many years and yeah, just being able to spend some time, some quality time with your kids, with family at home, it’s been a beautiful, beautiful phase and something that I’ve really enjoyed.”With Shastri pointing out how Kohli now plays only one format, the former India captain admitted the break has been rejuvenating. “Well, to be honest, I mean, the amount of cricket I’ve played over the last 15-20 years, I’ve actually not rested at all, if that makes sense. I’ve probably played the most number of games in the last 15 years in international cricket, combining the IPL together as well.”The time off, Kohli said, has recharged both his mind and body. ""So for me, it was a very refreshing time off. I'm feeling as fit, if not fitter, than I've ever been before. And yeah, you can just feel the freshness when you know you can play the game and mentally you know what to do out there.""It's just the physical preparation that really needs to be taken care of. At this stage, I realised that if my body is fit, if my reflexes are there, then the game awareness is already there.""On his readiness for the Australian tour, Kohli added, “My body has to match up with my game awareness. That’s something I try to keep up with. I live my life like that. And yeah, no issues at all. I’m feeling fresh here, moving really well in the nets and in the fielding sessions as well. So all good so far.”","Virat Kohli opened up about his life after retiring from Test cricket. The former India captain admitted the break has been rejuvenating.

Poll Should international cricket teams reconsider touring countries with a history of violence? Yes, safety first No, cricket should promote unity Depends on the current situation

Cricket is a sport that unites millions across the world. However, it has occasionally been marred by violence and terror. From targeted attacks on players to cross-border airstrikes, the game has witnessed moments of shock that shook the global cricket community.During the second Test in Lahore, masked terrorists targeted the Sri Lankan team bus en route to the Gaddafi Stadium. Captain Mahela Jayawardene and deputy Kumar Sangakkara, along with Ajantha Mendis, Thilan Samaraweera, and Tharanga Paravitarana, sustained minor injuries.The attack claimed the lives of six security personnel and two civilians. The Test was immediately called off, and the tour was canceled. This marked the first time sportsmen were specifically targeted since the 1972 Munich Olympics, highlighting the severe risks teams can face abroad.A suicide bomb outside the Pearl Continental Hotel in Karachi forced New Zealand to abandon their Pakistan tour. While players were unharmed, physio Dayle Shackel received minor injuries.ICC referee Mike Procter said, “Due to the security situation, the tour has been called off after mutual consultation between the PCB, NZC and the Black Caps team manager Jeff Crowe.”PCB Director Brig Munawar Rana added, “This indeed is unfortunate for our country and our cricket... but this incident really was beyond our control.”Following a cross-border airstrike in Paktika province, Afghanistan withdrew from a tri-nation T20 series with Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Three young cricketers – Kabeer, Sibghatullah, and Haroon – were killed, along with five civilians.Captain Rashid Khan called the attack “absolutely immoral and barbaric,” while Mohammad Nabi said, “This incident is not only a tragedy for Paktika but for the entire Afghan cricket family and the nation as a whole.”The ICC and BCCI condemned the incident and sided with the Afghanistan Cricket Board following the shocking incident.","Cricket is a sport that unites millions across the world.

NEW DELHI: Rohit Sharma etched his name in cricketing history on Sunday, playing his 500th international match for India during the first ODI against Australia in Perth. At 38, he became only the fifth Indian to reach this remarkable milestone, joining legends Sachin Tendulkar, Virat Kohli MS Dhoni , and Rahul Dravid. Globally, Rohit is the 11th player to achieve 500 international appearances.Rohit’s illustrious career spans all three formats, featuring 273 ODIs, 67 Tests, and 159 T20Is. He also holds the record for the most T20I appearances for India, highlighting his impact in the shortest format. On the all-time list of international matches, Sachin Tendulkar leads with 664 games (463 ODIs, 200 Tests, 1 T20I), followed by Mahela Jayawardene (652), Kumar Sangakkara (594), and other cricketing greats like Sanath Jayasuriya, Ricky Ponting, Virat Kohli, MS Dhoni, Shahid Afridi, Jacques Kallis, and Rahul Dravid. Rohit’s 500 matches firmly place him among the elite of world cricket.Beyond this milestone, Rohit is chasing another record—the most sixes in ODI cricket. With 344 sixes, he sits just seven short of Pakistan’s Shahid Afridi, needing only eight more to become the leading six-hitter in men’s ODIs.Rohit has also enjoyed tremendous success in Australia, scoring 990 runs in 19 matches at an average of 58.23, including four centuries and two fifties.Crossing 1,000 runs in Australia during this series would make him the first Indian to achieve the feat on Australian soil.His leadership record is equally impressive. Rohit led India to the 2024 T20 World Cup title before retiring from the format, and then captained the team to the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy triumph. Earlier this year, he also announced his retirement from Test cricket, closing a remarkable chapter in the longest format of the game.Australia have won the toss and opted to field. After 223 long days, Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli are finally back in action for India, bringing their experience and firepower to the top of the order.

His net worth rose after he signed a three-year contract with the Los Angeles Lakers in 2023.The contract, according to reports, is $175 million. Davis will have a base salary of $54,126,450 in 2025-2026, with a cap hit of $54,126,450 and a dead cap value of $54,126,450.

Industry tension or marketing genius?

The music world may be witnessing another chapter in the ongoing saga of celebrity “shading”, this time involving Olivia Rodrigo and Taylor Swift . After Swift released her much-discussed album The Life of a Showgirl, fans have been poring over every lyric, reaction, and social media move to decode hidden meanings. Now, a subtle action from Olivia Rodrigo’s manager, Aleen Keshishian, has sparked new waves of speculation and somehow, even Travis Kelce ’s name has become part of the conversation.Fans noticed that Rodrigo’s manager liked a viral reel that appeared to throw shade at Swift, and the internet quickly ran wild with interpretations. One fan post that went viral stated:“olivia rodrigo's manager, aleen keshishian, just liked a reel that was directly shading taylor... you can't convince me the industry isn't trying to push whichever narrative they can to bring her down because they feel overshadowed by her.”The timing is notable, as many listeners believe Swift’s Father Figure might subtly address her fallout with Rodrigo or perhaps even reignite old wounds tied to Vampire, Olivia’s emotional 2023 single that was once rumored to include veiled references to Taylor. Whether coincidence or calculated, this social media interaction has intensified the debate about rivalry narratives that dominate pop culture.Swift’s album has also stirred up theories involving Charli XCX, with fans pointing to a lyric in Actually Romantic, “Like a toy chihuahua barking at me from a tiny purse”, as a possible response to Charli’s Brat era.Meanwhile, Opalite has fans speculating about Kayla Nicole, Travis Kelce’s ex, due to lyrics about someone being “in it for her phone.” Swift’s decision to send gifts to Teyana Taylor, who previously criticized Nicole, only added fuel to the theory mill.Observers argue that what fans see as feuds might actually be deliberate storytelling. With Swift now balancing her NFL spotlight through her relationship with Travis Kelce and maintaining dominance in music, some in the industry may feel eclipsed. Whether it’s genuine tension or clever marketing, one thing is clear, Taylor Swift continues to be the gravitational force around which the pop culture universe spins.Also Read: Travis Kelce stands by Taylor Swift as critics accuse her of exploiting fans with ‘The Life of a Showgirl’ marketing blitz","Fans are dissecting lyrics from Swift's new album, linking them to potential digs at Rodrigo and even Travis Kelce's ex, Kayla Nicole.

Veteran Joe Flacco has stepped in, but the offense has struggled, leaving the team's playoff hopes dependent on Burrow's potential late-season return.

Joe Burrow’s injury and uncertain recovery timeline spark major concerns in Cincinnati

Veteran Joe Flacco steps in as Bengals fight to stay alive in the AFC

The Cincinnati Bengals’ season took a crushing turn in Week 2 when star quarterback Joe Burrow suffered a severe Grade 3 turf toe injury during a hard-fought win over the Jacksonville Jaguars. What was meant to be a statement victory has instead become the defining setback of the Bengals’ 2025 campaign, one that could derail their Super Bowl aspirations altogether.The injury occurred in the first half when Burrow was tackled from behind and twisted awkwardly as a defender grabbed his foot. Though he managed to limp to the sideline without a cart, the damage was significant. According to head coach Zac Taylor, Burrow underwent surgery to repair the injury, but the team has avoided committing to a firm timeline for his return.Early estimates suggest Burrow could be sidelined at least three months, putting his potential comeback sometime around mid-December. NFL insider Ian Rapoport has echoed this projection, saying Burrow remains on track for a late-season return, but that optimism comes with a massive asterisk.With the Bengals slipping to a 2-4 record entering Week 7, Taylor may be forced to consider whether it’s even worth risking his franchise quarterback’s health if the team is out of playoff contention.In Burrow’s absence, the Bengals turned to Joe Flacco, who was acquired in an October 7 trade from the Cleveland Browns. The 40-year-old veteran made his debut just five days later, completing 64.4% of his passes for 219 yards and two touchdowns in a loss to Green Bay.While his leadership and experience provide short-term stability, the offense has clearly struggled without Burrow’s signature explosiveness, now ranking 30th in offensive efficiency, per PFSN metrics.The Bengals’ playoff hopes rest on whether Flacco can keep them competitive long enough for Burrow to make a meaningful late-season return. But with each passing week and each tough loss, the team’s margin for error shrinks.For now, Cincinnati’s future remains tied to the health of its franchise cornerstone and the hope that Joe Burrow’s comeback will arrive in time to save their season.Also Read: “Connie baby”: Joe Burrow’s shaggy hair sparks ‘The Summer I Turned Pretty’ comparisons as fans dub him the real-life Conrad Fisher","Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow suffered a severe turf toe injury in Week 2.

Mark Sanchez breaks silence after stabbing and arrest, thanks his surgeon for saving his life

Former Jets quarterback Mark Sanchez has been sidelined from Fox Sports’ Week 7 NFL coverage following his recent arrest in Indianapolis. Once considered a rising star in sports broadcasting, Sanchez now faces growing uncertainty about his future in the booth as legal troubles threaten to overshadow his television career.Fox Sports’ updated NFL Week 7 broadcasting lineup was released this week, and noticeably absent from the roster was Sanchez’s name. The 38-year-old was slated to call the Colts vs. Raiders game on October 5 but was abruptly replaced after his arrest the night before. His sudden absence raised eyebrows across the league and the broadcasting world.According to reports, Sanchez was arrested on October 4 following a violent altercation in downtown Indianapolis. The former quarterback allegedly attacked 69-year-old Perry Tole after a heated dispute over a delivery truck’s parking spot turned physical. Both men were hospitalized after the fight, Tole reportedly suffered a deep facial wound, while Sanchez was treated for multiple stab wounds.Tole has since filed a lawsuit against both Sanchez and Fox Corporation, claiming the network “should have been aware of Sanchez’s unfitness” and “propensity for drinking and/or harmful conduct.”Prosecutors have now added a felony charge to the case, carrying a potential one-to-five-year prison sentence.After days of silence, Sanchez finally spoke outside the Marion County Jail in Indianapolis. “Right now, I’m just focused on my recovery,” he told local reporters. “I just wanted to thank the first responders, Eskenazi Hospital. I just want to thank Dr. [Lindsey] Mossler, the surgeon. She saved my life, so I’m grateful for that.”While Fox Sports has yet to issue an official statement, sources close to the network suggest Sanchez’s return to the booth is “highly unlikely” in the near future. His substitute, Brady Quinn, admitted the experience was “not ideal,” adding, “Not much sleep and mixed emotions… concerned for Mark’s health and the well-being of all those involved.”Also Read: Is Mark Sanchez’s silence about his broadcasting comeback hinting at a bigger story behind the stabbing incident?

Tom Brady’s six-touchdown spectacle against the Titans still stands as NFL history



Brady’s humble reflection shows why his legacy endures



Sixteen years ago, on October 18, 2009, Tom Brady delivered a performance that redefined quarterback excellence. Under falling snow at Gillette Stadium, the New England Patriots dismantled the Tennessee Titans 59-0 — a game that remains one of the most lopsided victories in NFL history. For Brady, it wasn’t just about numbers; it was about silencing doubts, reclaiming dominance, and reminding the world of his greatness.In that unforgettable clash, Brady completed 29 of 34 passes for 380 yards and six touchdowns, with five of them coming in the second quarter — an NFL record that still stands. The Patriots erupted for a 35-point second quarter and took a commanding 45-0 lead into halftime, the largest halftime margin in league history.The precision and rhythm of the Patriots’ offense were breathtaking. Randy Moss hauled in two long touchdowns from 40 and 28 yards, Wes Welker added two of his own, and veteran Kevin Faulk joined the scoring spree. With 68,756 fans watching through the snowflakes, Gillette Stadium became the stage for one of the most complete offensive displays the NFL had ever witnessed.The Titans, unable to counter the Patriots’ relentless assault, suffered what was then their worst defeat in franchise history.For Brady, though, it was more than just another win — it was the definitive statement of his comeback.What makes this memory shine brighter today is not just the record-breaking numbers but Brady’s humble response when the Patriots recently revisited that historic win. With his trademark humor, he said, “Sometimes I look back at my career and think ‘OK, you were actually pretty good sometimes.’”At that time, Brady was returning from a season-ending knee injury in 2008, and the win over the Titans served as a reassuring reminder that the legend was far from done. It reignited his journey toward the legacy that would eventually include seven Super Bowl titles and countless accolades.Even after all the rings and records, this snowy afternoon in Foxborough remains one of those rare moments when everything clicked perfectly. For fans, it’s a reminder of Brady at his most ruthless. For Brady, it’s a reason to smile — knowing that perfection, once upon a time, truly looked effortless.Also Read: Patrick Mahomes’ mom Randi gets touching shoutout from Chiefs owner’s wife after launching her Chiefs-inspired merchandise","Tom Brady's six-touchdown spectacle against the Titans still stands as NFL history.
