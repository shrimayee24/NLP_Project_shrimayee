1983: When Kapil’s Devils became the Lords of Cricket

2012: Sindhu’s double: Saina Nehwal had paved the way.

2024: Manu Bhaker

India's sporting journey is a tale of unexpected victories and hard-fought triumphs. From securing a surprising fourth position in football at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics to Neeraj Chopra 's historic gold medal in javelin at Tokyo 2021, each milestone is a testament to country's commitment and groundbreaking achievements.Hard to believe today, but it’s true.Neville Stephen De Souza, the nippy striker, fired a delightful hat-trick, leading to India’s memorable 4-2 triumph over host Australia in Melbourne. In the semifinals, India even led formidable Yugoslavia 1-0 at one stage; poacher De Souza the scorer. The improbable was happening. But in the end, India went down 4-1. A 3-0 loss to Bulgaria in the battle for bronze meant the team finished fourth. Now, nearly 70 years later, the triumph remains India’s high point in a sport that’s largely frustrated fans.1975: When India won a World Cup in hockey: In the previous edition of the championship, India had suffered a heart-breaking loss after missing a penalty stroke in ‘sudden death’ against the Netherlands in the final. But in Kuala Lumpur, India pulled off a famous victory overcoming Pakistan 2-1 in a thrilling final to lift the cherished trophy. Equally remembered is the 3-2 victory over Malaysia in the semifinal. At one point of time, with barely five minutes left, India trailed 2-1. Defender Aslam Sher Khan’s penalty conversion, after kissing the amulet given by his mother, is one of the unforgettable stories of Indian sports.The story, probably apocryphal, goes that someone bet on an Indian victory and won an island. But it explains how implausible the triumph over the famed and the formidable West Indies cricket machine was. All-rounder Mohinder Amarnath was the Man of the Match. The 43-run victory, the first major sporting conquest to be telecast widely in India, set the tone for the One-Day cricket revolution.1988: Viswanathan Anand India is one of the superpowers of world chess today. Five-time World Champion Anand started the fire. The Lightning Kid from Chennai became India’s first Grand Master in 1988. Today India has 85 GMs.2008: Bindra becomes golden moment: In the history of Olympics, India had never won an individual gold. In Beijing 2012, shooter Abhinav Bindra wiped out a national deficiency. In the 10m air rifle category, Bindra overcame the local favourite shooting with accuracy and calm and became India's unofficial Godfinger forever.The shuttler became the first Indian to win a badminton medal, a bronze, in the London Olympics. But PV Sindhu created Indian badminton 2.0. The Hyderabad-born shuttler produced a masterclass in tenacity to wrench out a silver in Rio. Four years later, she delivered another bronze in Tokyo. In between the two was the women's singles world championship title earned in Basel in 2019. A common feature in the rise and success of both badminton players was their coach Pullela Gopichand, an all-England winner whose academy groomed a crop of top shuttlers.2021: Neeraj Chopra: After sprinter Norman Pritchard’s two silvers in Paris 1900, India had never won another Olympic medal in athletes. Just when the nation was resigned to reducing its ambitions, Chopra came out of nowhere to claim a gold in javelin in Tokyo. This was just the beginning. He dominated his discipline in the past three years, winning the World Championship and the prestigious Diamond League. In Paris 2024, his silver was the first earned by the 117-strong contingent.In the rescheduled Tokyo Olympics, bad luck dogged Manu Bhaker. A pistol malfunction botched the Haryana teenage shooter’s quest for a medal. The reaction was sharp. In this backdrop, Manu’s double medal haul in 10m air pistol (individual and team, with Sarabjot Singh) was an inspiring tale of redemption for the focused and determined shooter. The achievement was special because she became the first Indian to win two individual medals in a single Olympics.",India's sporting journey is a tale of unexpected victories and hard-fought triumphs.

Rachael Gunn: Did breakdancer RayGun’s husband pick her for Australia’s Olympic squad? Here’s the truth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/did-breakdancer-rayguns-husband-pick-her-for-australias-olympic-squad-heres-the-truth/articleshow/112528604.cms,"Sydney Morning Herald

Rachael Gunn , known by her stage name RayGun , has recently found herself at the centre of a heated online controversy regarding her selection for the Paris 2024 Olympics . The 36-year-old athlete, who went viral for her performance during the breakdancing competition—making its Olympic debut—failed to secure a single point from the judges across three rounds.This led to a wave of criticism and accusations, which have since been debunked.A petition, launched by an anonymous individual under the name ""Someone Who Hates Corruption,"" has amassed over 20,000 signatures, accusing Gunn of manipulating the selection process to secure her spot on the Australian Olympic team . The petition alleges that Gunn, alongside her husband and coach Samuel Free, founded the Australian Breaking Association (ABA), the organisation responsible for choosing which athletes would represent Australia in the games. However, these claims have been refuted by the, which has confirmed that neither Gunn nor Free were involved in the founding of the ABA.In response to the allegations, Gunn clarified the circumstances surrounding her Olympic selection. Speaking to the publication before heading to Paris, she explained, “I won the Oceania qualifier , and by winning that competition, I got the direct spot to Paris. That was a really intense, really stressful but really amazing competition.”The petition against Gunn also questioned the fairness of the selection process, pointing out that other talented female breakdancers, such as G Clef and Holy Molly, were overlooked. It further claimed that the NT Youlong Boys, a group of talented and underprivileged youth from the Northern Territory, were denied crucial funding by Dr. Gunn, a decision that reportedly impacted their chances of showcasing their skills on a national stage.The Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) president, Anna Meares, came to Gunn’s defence amidst the growing backlash. Meares, a former Olympian herself, expressed her disappointment over the online criticism, stating, ""I love Rachael. What has occurred on social media with trolls and keyboard warriors, and taking those comments and giving them airtime, has been really disappointing. RayGun is an absolutely loved member of this Olympic team. She has represented the Olympic spirit with great enthusiasm, and I absolutely love her courage and character.""AusBreaking, the body responsible for overseeing the selection process, also issued a statement to clarify the situation. They explained that the selection process for Australia’s breaking team was conducted over two days and was open to all interested participants in the Oceanic region. They emphasized that the process adhered to World DanceSport Federation (WDSF) regulations, which align with International Olympic Committee (IOC) standards, ensuring a fair and transparent outcome. The competition was overseen by a panel of nine international adjudicators, a head judge, and a chairperson, all trained to uphold the highest standards of impartiality.Despite the backlash, Gunn remains focused on her Olympic journey, carrying the support of her team and those who recognise her commitment to the sport.","Rachael Gunn, known by her stage name RayGun, failed to secure a single point from the judges across three rounds.

The day after her disqualification, Vinesh announced her decision to retire from wrestling.Following Vinesh's failure to meet the weight limit, members and officials of the Indian Olympic Association faced increased scrutiny.IOA President PT Usha clarified on Sunday that the responsibility for weight management of athletes in sports like wrestling, weightlifting, boxing, and judo lies with each athlete and their coach, not with the IOA-appointed Chief Medical Officer Dr. Dinshaw Pardiwala and his team.Usha stated that each Indian athlete in the Paris 2024 Olympic Games in such sports had their own support team, which had been working with the athletes for many years, according to a statement from IOA.","Vinesh Phogat will return to India on Saturday, August 17.

ICC yet to upload pitch ratings of New York games of T20 World Cup,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/icc-yet-to-upload-pitch-ratings-of-new-york-games-of-t20-world-cup/articleshow/112530698.cms,"NEW DELHI: The International Cricket Council ( ICC ) has not released the official ratings for the pitch and outfield conditions of the 54 matches played during the T20 World Cup in the United States and West Indies. This delay comes despite the passage of seven and a half weeks since the tournament's conclusion.Particular attention is being paid to the ratings of the eight matches held at the Nassau County ground in New York state.The fresh drop-in pitches, prepared by Adelaide curator Damian Hough, resulted in an average first innings score of just 107.6 runs across the eight games played at this venue, PTI reported.The ratings for the matches held in the West Indies are also awaited, but the focus remains on the performance of the pitches at the Nassau County ground.The ICC website, which provides ratings for pitch and outfield conditions, appears to have neglected updating this information since May 31, 2024, for both men's and women's international matches.The cricket venue in New York faced severe criticism from around the globe due to its unpredictable bounce and sluggish outfield. These conditions made run-scoring a challenging task, with even modest totals of 120 proving to be difficult to chase down.The delay in updating pitch and outfield ratings on the ICC website, now spanning 46 days, is unusual given that during the 50-over World Cup in India, such assessments were typically posted within a week of a match's conclusion.The match referees for the eight matches in New York were Ranjan Madugalle (3 games), David Boon (3 games), Jeff Crowe , and Richie Richardson.Given the rating categories of very good, good, satisfactory, average, and below average, it's likely that New York will receive an average or below average rating for both the pitch and outfield if assessed fairly.With cricket being included in the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, the ICC is eager to avoid any negative findings regarding pitch quality during the global event in the US.Over the next four years, the ICC will need to develop the necessary sporting infrastructure to support cricket's Olympic debut, as New York's performance did not provide a strong example for the sport's entry into the Games.",The International Cricket Council ( ICC ) has not released the official ratings for the pitch and outfield conditions of the 54 matches played during the T20 World Cup in the United States and West Indies.

Harmanpreet Kaur should bat at No. 3; India must relook at combinations for T20 World Cup: Anjum Chopra,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/harmanpreet-kaur-should-bat-at-no-3-india-must-relook-at-combinations-for-t20-world-cup-anjum-chopra/articleshow/112530619.cms,"NEW DELHI: Anjum Chopra , the former Indian women's cricket team captain, believes that Harmanpreet Kaur possesses the necessary skills to dominate a match and should be positioned at No. 3 in the batting order.With the T20 World Cup approaching, Chopra suggests that India should consider making changes to their team composition. The elegant former batter also expressed concern about the Indian bowling attack's lack of effectiveness in crucial matches.According to Chopra, although India has several options for the No.3 spot, captain Kaur should not deny herself the opportunity to play longer innings.""I've always felt that Harman should play at No 3. I've told her also. But of course, depending upon the scenario, and, every player's comfort is (also) there,"" Chopra told PTI in an exclusive interview.""She is one of those players, who can control the game and will have more time, rather than coming in later and then swinging her bat. Why reduce the number of deliveries?,"" she said.Chopra attributed India's defeat in the Asia Cup final to the absence of significant challenges faced by the team throughout the tournament leading up to the final match.""Even if they have won this Asia Cup, it would have been like 'oh, we are a better team'. But because they didn't, they got a wake-up call and I am hoping it is a wake-up call. Not in a bad way but in a good way,"" she said.""They were not challenged and whenever they were, it was okay, it wasn't like digging in deep to come out victorious. When Sri Lanka posed a challenge to them, especially after winning against Pakistan (in the semifinal), they were a team on a high.""""Once (Vishmi) Gunaratne was run out in confusion with (Chamari) Athapaththu and then the second wicket fell, I thought they are missing on the barrel. But for Sri Lanka to bounce out of that situation and win convincingly, that was a high,"" she continued.Chopra highlighted Sri Lanka's recent progress and emphasized that India needs to make significant improvements as a team to match their level of performance.""We lost 2-1 to England. We lost 2-1 to Australia. We were challenged by South Africa. When we go to the Asia Cup, there are other teams also challenging us,"" she said.""Sri Lanka didn't even qualify for the 2022 World Cup in New Zealand because they didn't have any cricket for two-and-a-half years during Covid. But look where they are now.""She had a simple question for one and all. Has Harmanpreet and her band improved as a team? The answer is a mixed one.""Has our team shown that kind of advancement and improvement? Yes, to a certain extent. But are we still plugging in those gaps whereby we are not conceding defeat?,"" she questioned.""The reason why we lost the Asia Cup final (was) because we are still not plugging those gaps,"" she said.""Certain decisions are obviously not favorable. Certain resources that we have at the disposal are not favourable. You have to make do with what you have, which is probably not quite there right now to become world leaders,"" she said.Chopra expressed his apprehension regarding the current state of India's bowling attack.""Look, we have Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj and Mohammed Shami (in the men's team). When we have these bowlers around, we boast of a bowling lineup like no one in this world and this wasn't achieved overnight,"" she said.""I'm not saying that overnight we will have these kind of quality bowlers in the women's team as well. We are playing with only five bowlers. Now that one bowler has a bad day, we are challenged,"" she said.Bowling options in India are limited, she accepted.""Maybe we don't have the options. Maybe because players are injured, they are not there. Maybe the skill level has dropped for all those players who are injured or whether they've dropped off the radar. We do have a good bowling line-up but we don't have a penetrative bowling line-up,"" she said.Chopra raised concerns about the non-participation of key Indian players in the current series against Australia 'A'. She pointed out the inclusion of Tahlia McGrath in the Australian team, highlighting the contrast between the two sides.""We've not done well in Australia. India A is playing there. Meghana Singh is playing, who is not considered (for selection) even when she's around the Indian team. (Then) why is she playing there?"" she said.""Why is Titas Sadhu not a part of this? Why is Sobhana Asha not a part of India A? I thought Jemimah Rodrigues should have been there in this team playing in Australia. Why is she not there?""(Those who have) just stepped out of the South African series and have not gone for 'The Hundred'. Tahlia McGrath is leading Australia, why is no current India player a part of that?""""We need to do a bit of our combination reassessment again and hope that a few players come into this lineup as options.

One can't wait for that series to start and (I think) India can do the hat-trick (of series victories in Australia),"" Shastri told ICC.Despite Australian legend Ricky Ponting's recent prediction of a 3-1 series win for his nation, Shastri maintains that Indian bowlers are capable of delivering success, provided their batsmen rise to the occasion.""It is going to be one heck of a series and India have every chance of making it a hat-trick because they've got their bowlers fit and if they can bat well, they can tickle (beat) Australia once again,"" said Shastri.India are set to embark on a five-match series in Australia, commencing with the Test match in Perth this November.""The Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia over five Test matches is going to be a humdinger.""Remember, India have beaten Australia twice on the last two tours and Australia have not had a hand on the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in almost a decade and that's the reason why everyone will be waiting for these two heavyweights of Test match cricket over the last five to eight years to go head-to-head,"" added Shastri.Shastri believes that the Australian team, also boasting a potent bowling lineup, will be driven by a desire for revenge due to the back-to-back series defeats they have endured in the last two editions of the contest.""We know what Australia will be wanting (revenge). They will be thirsty, they'd be looking to go at the throats of the Indians because they've been beaten there (in Australia) twice.""The attack is pretty much the same. One of the greatest fast bowling attacks -- (one of the greatest) all-round attacks when you add Nathan Lyon there -– in a long, long time. And one of the best in the history of the game. They'll be looking for those 20 wickets, game after game to help Australia win the series.""""It's going to be India's batting against the Australian fast bowlers. And of course, the Indian bowling attack is going to be something everyone will be waiting to see,"" he added.",Ravi Shastri believes India have the potential to secure a third consecutive Test series victory in Australia.

NEW DELHI: Kylian Mbappe scored on his Real Madrid debut to help his new team defeat Atalanta 2-0 and win the UEFA Super Cup for the record sixth time on Wednesday in Warsaw.After years of waiting to play for his ideal team, the French forward sensation finally joined Los Blancos this summer upon his departure from Paris Saint-Germain , and he celebrated his debut with a goal, as per AFP.After the Italian Europa League winners held their own in the first half, Fede Valverde broke the tie for the holders of the Champions League in the 59th minute with a close-range shot.Madrid started to build momentum, and in the 68th minute, Mbappe scored a spectacular goal to secure the win after Jude Bellingham had spotted his run into space in the box.""It was a great night, I've been waiting for this moment for a long time,"" Mbappe told Movistar, speaking in fluent Spanish.""To play with this shirt, with this badge, for these fans, it's a gift for me.""We won a trophy too, that's very important, we know that here we always have to win and I am very happy.""With Madrid's victory, head coach Carlo Ancelotti tied previous Los Blancos coach Miguel Munoz for the most titles won as a club manager with 14.This season, the Italian's first priority is creating a system that would maximize the performance of his wide range of attacking players.Initially, Mbappe started in the middle of Madrid's front line, with Vinicius Junior on the left and Rodrygo Goes on the right, giving an indication of how Ancelotti may use him this season.Consequently, Bellingham, an England international, did not play in the forward position he started last season with such devastating goal scoring effect; instead, he was a member of the midfield trio.""(Mbappe) has the quality to score a lot of goals,"" Ancelotti told Movistar.""What we have to look for is balance in the team -- today we didn't have that balance.""In a close first half, Mbappe's best opportunity came in the fifteenth minute, but Isak Hien expertly blocked his attempt from the middle of the box.After shocking Bayer Leverkusen in the Europa League final the previous season, Gian Piero Gasperini's Atalanta made their Super Cup debut. Eder Militao nearly gave them the lead by heading Marten de Roon's cross over his own bar.Bellingham took a hard touch to control a deft pass from Vinicius and was booked for a late push on Atalanta goalkeeper Juan Musso during a raid forward from midfield.Vinicius set Rodrygo up, and he clipped the top of Atalanta's crossbar right before halftime.At the beginning of the second half, Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, who was injured for the majority of the previous season, made an incredible one-handed save to deflect a header by Mario Pasalic.At the beginning of the second half, Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, who was injured for the majority of the previous season, made an incredible one-handed save to deflect a header by Mario Pasalic.Before the hour, Valverde of Real Madrid broke the tie with a close-range tap-in as Atalanta's defense fretted over Mbappe's increased freedom of movement.Vinicius, who was becoming more and more important, feed Bellingham, who then sliced the ball across the goal for the Uruguayan midfielder to score.When Vinicius was let through on goal, Musso knocked over his attempt, which would have doubled Madrid's lead.As Madrid attempted a second, Swedish defender Hien stopped Bellingham, and Musso then stopped the former Borussia Dortmund player.Eventually, Mbappe finished it with a deadly flourish after Bellingham stalled an attempt and saw the Frenchman's deft move.The Madrid supporters applauded the striker as Ancelotti took him off the field in the 83rd minute, probably the first of many that to come.Mbappe stated that he anticipated getting better in the upcoming weeks. Real Mallorca will be Madrid's first La Liga opponent on Saturday.""I am sure we will get better and me first of all -- but today is a positive step,"" added the striker.",Kylian Mbappe scored on his Real Madrid debut to help his new team defeat Atalanta 2-0 and win the UEFA Super Cup for the record sixth time.

""We'll play against a team that is showing why they deserve to be in an AFC competition year after year as they've qualified for top 9AFC) competitions every season. It'll be a good test for us to prove that we are also at that kind of level and can represent the country in a top competition like the ACL-2,"" the Spanish coach told reporters on Tuesday.""We are not favourites for this game. We are playing in Asia after 9 years and have a lot of inexperienced players. It will be the first game (in an Asian tournament) for some of our players. But one thing is clear is that East Bengal will play with a never-say-die attitude and we'll hope to take advantage of our home crowd,"" he added.Cuadrat has had the experience of facing the Turkmenistan rivals. During his stint with Bengaluru FC back in 2018, Sunil Chhetri & Co. lost the two-legged AFC Cup inter-zonal semifinals 5-2 on aggregate.Never a man fond of beating the drum for revenge, Cuadrat, however, will take on Altyn Asyr at a challenging time. The senior team's pre-season is just two competitive match-old with the all-important derby against Mohun Bagan SG coming up in four days time with the Durand Cup quarterfinal spot at stake. Players like Hector Yuste are yet to join the side while a few others are nursing injuries.Yet, amid the euphoria of India defender Anwar Ali's unveiling during the club's Sports Day ceremony later in the day, Cuadrat knows that his team can announce the arrival of its new-found ambitions with a win over Altyn Asyr.""We want to raise the standards. We reached two finals last season and were not so good in the ISL. We want to be the protagonist in all the competitions we want to play this season,"" the East Bengal coach remarked.For a team founded only in 2008, winning Turkmenistan's top domestic league (Yokary Liga) 8 times and being a regular in Asian football speaks volumes of Altyn Asyr's emergence as a force to reckon with.The visitors from Turkmenistan have the form and history on their side. But the red-and-gold's history is replete with many odds-defying tales. It remains to be seen if Nandhakumar Sekar & Co., starting as underdogs, can rise to the occasion and alter the script.","East Bengal face Turkmenistan's Altyn Asyr FC in AFC Champions League preliminary play-off.
