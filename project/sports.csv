PARIS: “Oh my god! So many phones! I have so many options,” Manu Bhaker exclaimed, happiness shining through her voice, as she looked at the tray which held at least 20 mobile phones of eager Indian journalists who had gathered in the mixed zone to speak to the shooting star here on Sunday.She laughed some more, not apprehensive anymore of what would come her way.She had the medal around her neck to give her confidence. She looked unburdened. The questions came in a hurry. What was going through your mind last night Manu?“I was not tense. I read the Bhagavad Gita a lot. And you know those famous advice which Lord Krishna gave to Arjun: 'Apna karm karo, phal ki chinta mat karo (Just do your work, don’t think of result). So I knew I just had to give my best.”Tell us about your special bonding with your coach Jaspal Rana .“He is special. He made the training so difficult for me that shooting here was easy. We worked very hard on the technical areas. His style of coaching is so different. He would often give me very difficult targets. If I failed to achieve them, he would make me donate a certain amount of money to the needy. It would be 40 euros one day, 400 euros the other day.”On having won an Olympic medal at such a young age, and being destined for bigger things, Manu said: “It feels surreal. Have dreamt of this for years. Yes, top of the world. I did miss the silver by 0.1 point, but I have no complaints. This medal is for all of us, our country. I would like to thank everyone who has helped me on this journey – my coach, other Indian coaches, my parents, Sports Authority of India...everyone.“But there is no time to celebrate. I have to compete in many more events. Yes, you cannot be at the top of your game all the time and I have become used to it. I will still give my best in the upcoming competitions.”Manu does not want to talk about the Tokyo heartbreak but did say that it gave her important lessons.“Whatever happened in Tokyo was probably because of my carelessness, probably my fault. Let us leave that part behind. There were so many lessons there. If I had not learnt from them, this would not have come. Tokyo was a valuable input on the road to Paris. I told myself last night that I would give my best. Dekhi jayegi! Aage Bhagwan dekh lenge (will see how it goes; god will take care of the rest).”You talk of God. How religious are you?“After Tokyo, I became religious. But not in a fanatic way. For me, God is some form of energy which guides us through life. It is like an aura around us. I believe in that.”",Shooting star Manu Bhaker won bronze at the Paris Olympics. She missed out on the silver medal by 0.1 points. Bhaker says she has become more religious after her experience in Tokyo. She says she will still give her best in the upcoming competitions.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112095609,imgsize-52708,width-400,resizemode-4/112095609.jpg"

"Paris Olympics: Rafael Nadal loses to Novak Djokovic, but gives memories to cherish",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/paris-olympics-rafael-nadal-loses-to-novak-djokovic-but-gives-memories-to-cherish/articleshow/112123275.cms,"Nadal

shows flashes of his fighting spirit at 'home' court but it's not enough to stop Novak

PARIS: The long, winding queue outside Roland Garros added to the sense of growing anticipation. Some locals and a Polish bunch were there for the Iga Swiatek-Diane Parry match. But even for them that clash was a mere footnote to the main action coming up at Philippe Chartier court here on a sunny Monday afternoon.It was all about two ageing, great champions of the game - Rafael Nadal , 38 and Novak Djokovic , 37 - meeting probably for the last time on this hallowed patch of clay.The Parisians love Nadal as their own. The Spaniard is the King here. 14 titles, 112 wins, just 4 losses. Nadal was 8-2 against Djokovic here before the match; the Serb was ahead 30-29 in career head-to-head record.But Monday was not about numbers or records. His body ravaged by injuries over a two-decade career, Nadal willed himself to play here at the Olympics. He lost in the first round in the French Open three months back. Djokovic , also troubled by a knee injury, pulled out of the quarterfinals. But all that did not matter when the two greats met again, this time fighting for their respective countries.They walked onto the court to a loud roar from the 15,000-capacity crowd. The action started with Djokovic's serve. The Serb, knee strapped, raced to 40-0, then saw Nadal make it deuce. Djokovic somehow managed to hold on to his serve. Nadal started with 0-30, then drew level with a sublime inside-out forehand shot. However, he was broken when his return hit the net and went out.Djokovic won the next game at love, playing two superb drop shots in the process. 3-0. He looked to be in a hurry. Down 30-40 in the next game, Nadal pulled out a vintage drop volley that made it 40-40. He was fighting for every ball, the way he has all his life. But it was clear that he was not 100 % match fit.Djokovic, on the other hand, was playing with authority and ease, having sensed that his rival was not at his best. It was soon 4-0.Nadal made the final of the Bastad Open just last week. However, that outing was not enough to give him the momentum he needed against a player of Djokovic's calibre.Djokovic raced through the next game, holding his serve again at love. 5-0. It was looking desperate for the Spaniard, but he won the next one and pumped his fist. The crowd came alive. Djokovic lost the first point in the next game as Nadal passed him at the net. But after that it was again a cruise for him. Game done, set done. 6-1.Nadal started the second set with some promise but found himself at 40-40 once again on his serve. Two unforced errors made it 1-0 in the Serb's favour. Nadal seemed to be playing from memory. His mind was willing, his body was not.A magical backhand down the line by Djokovic was the talking point of the next game, which he sealed with an ace. 2-0.The crowd chanted 'Rafa, Rafa ', egging their favourite to fight back. He tried hard, catching up at 30-30 after losing two points. Then a double fault pushed him to the edge, but Nadal clawed back to make it 40-40. Djokovic refused to budge, breaking the Spaniard again. 3-0.There was no change in the script when Djokovic served. The Serb sealed it with a delicate volley. 4-0.Nadal then won his first game of the set and pushed hard for a service break in the next game. Nadal went up 40-30 on Djokovic's serve for the first time in the match. An uncharacteristic double fault by Djokovic gave Nadal the much-needed break, the first of the match for him. 4-2. Game on?The break did change Nadal's game. He suddenly looked pumped up. He won the next game without much fuss. The crowd roared its approval. 4-3. Up 40-30 in the next game, Nadal broke Djokovic again with a scorching forehand crosscourt shot. 4-4. The crowd was on its feet, singing, dancing, chanting. Their Rafa was back. Match fitness or not, he was not going to simply fade away.Down 15-30 on his serve, he recovered to 40-40 but Djokovic broke him with a drop volley. It was 5-4 in the Serb's favour.Serving for the set and the match, Djokovic made an unforced error but recovered with an ace to go up 30-15. Then came another unforced error: 30-30. Then Rafa made an unforced error. Djokovic needed no more prompting. He finished it with an ace. Game, set, match Djokovic.Nadal packed his bag quickly and walked away to loud applause.For those who care, it is now Rafa 8-3 vs Djokovic at Roland Garros and Djokovic 31-29 in career head-to-head. But that's just for the record, it's all about the memories.","Rafael Nadal beats Novak Djokovic 6-1, 6-2 in the quarterfinals of the men's singles at Roland Garros.

India has not played cricket in Pakistan for over a decade, and it is uncertain if this will change soon.The debate has drawn various comments from former cricketers from both nations.Harbhajan Singh , a former Indian spinner, voiced concerns about India's potential visit to Pakistan, citing the volatile security situation.On the other hand, ex-Pakistan pacer Tanvir Ahmed has openly challenged the Indian team to visit Pakistan, referring to Pakistan's own visit to India for the ODI World Cup last year.A video clip featuring Tanvir Ahmed has gone viral on social media wherein he commends the Pakistan team for being ""brave and fearless"" for traveling to India to play cricket. In the clip, he extends an invitation to the Indian team to come to Pakistan, reassuring them of their safety.""Sher hai hum log sher hai, hum log sher hai. Hum log tere mulk me aa ke khel ke gaye hai. Aake dikha....Hum toh kah rahe hai aake khelo. Security denge, sab kuch denge tum logon ko. Aao toh sahi ek dafaa [We are lions, we are lions.

Only Pakistani players come and play and go back, regardless of winning or losing, and no matter how they play. They went to India and returned after playing there. This is what you call a brave team and brave players],"" he added.Pakistan has assured that all matches involving the Indian team in the tournament will be held in Lahore, and the Indian team will stay at the same hotel throughout their visit. The idea behind this arrangement is to implement more effective and secure measures.Last year, the Indian cricket team refused to travel to Pakistan for the Asia Cup , leading to India matches being staged in Sri Lanka instead. Since 2012, the two nations have not played any bilateral series, with the Indian government limiting cricket encounters between Pakistan and India to ICC or ACC events.","India has not played cricket in Pakistan for over a decade, and it is uncertain if this will change soon.

But as the drama unfolded, people started streaming in.When TOI visited the shooter’s home, her grandmother Daya Kaur explained that the family follows a ritual of not watching her match as they believe it brings good luck for their girl.“We sat in a prayer with our eyes closed for about half an hour during the shooting event. But today since so many came home, we made an exception to switch on the TV,” said the octogenarian Daya. “Manu, my granddaughter, might have missed the gold medal today, but bronze is no less. I will make up for the missing gold by garlanding her with a golden chain when she returns,” she said with a smile.As hard as Daya tried to keep the excitement of the kids under control as Manu fought tooth and nail for a medal, she struggled.“Go for gold, go for gold, go for gold… Manu,” her young fans shouted. And when the medal happened, it was joy unbound. Laddoos were distributed and they broke into impromptu dance steps.“This is just a trailer. We will give her a grand welcome when she comes back to the village,” Manu’s uncle, Mahendra Singh said.While Manu was shooting her way to a historic medal, her parents Ramkishan and Sumedha cheered for their daughter. Ramkishan highlighted his daughter’s bend towards spirituality post the Tokyo Olympics, where her pistol malfunctioned and dented her medal chances.“She is spiritually inclined. She saw her mother recite shlokas from the Bhagavad Gita, and she also started reading the holy text. Doing that makes her mind calm and sharpens her focus. She knows exactly what to do to achieve her target. We, as parents, back her through all ups and downs,” her father said.“Her medal has also come as a major boost for the sport in the country after we couldn’t win any medal in shooting at the 2016 Rio Olympics and 2020 Tokyo Olympics.“I am confident our shooting contingent in Paris will take this medal as a shot in the arm and bag more medals in the ongoing Olympics. Manu has two more events left, and we expect her to do better,” he added.Manu’s mother Sumedha said she backs her daughter through thick and thin – whether she comes home from any championship with a medal or not.“I just want my daughter to be happy and feel good about herself. I also want to say that the media has always supported my daughter. Back in the days when my husband had to run from pillar to post to get pistol license for Manu, the media highlighted the issue and that helped our cause.”Uncle Mahender, who runs a private school in the village where Manu began her shooting career, said about 35 children practise shooting there, inspired by the numerous medals the young champion has won.“Manu is their role model, and whenever she has time, she visits the school to train them,” he said.Reflecting on Manu’s early shooting days, Mahender mentioned her unwavering focus. “We would make her work really hard, but she didn’t mind. That extra effort must have helped her,” he said.","Shooter Manu Bhaker won bronze at the Paris Olympics on Sunday. Her parents were in Faridabad, while her grandmother was in Jhajjar.

Brendon McCullum says England have 'harder feel' after West Indies clean sweep,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/brendon-mccullum-says-england-have-harder-feel-after-west-indies-clean-sweep/articleshow/112116998.cms,"NEW DELHI: England's head coach Brendon McCullum is of the opinion that the revamped Test team has developed a ""harder feel"" following their dominant 3-0 series victory against the West Indies, which marked the beginning of their home season.The 4-1 defeat in India prompted England to, in McCullum's words, ""refine"" their aggressive strategy and overhaul their red-ball team.This led to the international retirement of James Anderson , England's all-time leading wicket-taker, while experienced wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow , who has over 100 caps, and Ben Foakes were both surpassed by Test debutant Jamie Smith.During the West Indies series, England also handed debuts to fast bowler Gus Atkinson and spinner Shoaib Bashir , who replaced Jack Leach as the team's primary spin option.The young trio of Smith, Atkinson, and Bashir all made significant contributions as England secured an innings and 114-run victory at Lord's, followed by a 241-run win at Trent Bridge, and finally wrapped up the series with a 10-wicket triumph at Edgbaston on Sunday.""No changes are ever easy, are they?,"" said England red-ball boss McCullum, as quoted by AFP. ""But we knew we needed to make a couple of improvements as a side and we brought in some new faces.""The former New Zealand captain added: ""You don't ask for instant gratification when it comes to them but the way the series played out you'd say the guys have certainly shown they're good enough at this level.""What we've seen from Gus Atkinson, from Shoaib Bashir and Jamie Smith, is that international cricket is where they belong and they've performed accordingly.""Sometimes when you lose you have a period of reflection and what we've seen is a team which has bounced back with a bit of a harder feel to it. I think we're a stronger team now than we may have been in the past.""Anderson retired after the series opener at Lord's with 704 Test wickets, the highest tally by any fast bowler in the 147-year history of the format. Only spinners Shane Warne (708 wickets) and Muttiah Muralitharan (800 wickets) have more wickets in the all-time rankings.England, however, have retained Anderson's services as a fast-bowling mentor, with a grateful McCullum saying: ""What Jimmy's given in the past couple of matches is quite incredible. He's fitted seamlessly into our group of coaches.""It's never easy but he seems really content right now, it's great to have him and I feel very lucky that he's part of our group.""England would be eager to bring a group of authentic fast bowlers with them to Australia as they aim to reclaim the Ashes in the 2025/26 series.""With the bowlers now we've got some pretty good ammo (ammunition) that we are going to need on flat wickets when times arise,"" said McCullum.""Gus has touched 90mph (145kmh), been able to jag the ball off a good length and also been able to operate a bumper plan for a period of time.""The way Chris Woakes bowled was outstanding. Then you add the speed of Mark Wood, which is quite frightening really.""Shoaib Bashir and Stokesy (England captain Ben Stokes ) are in there too... We're not the finished article but this series is a step forward.""Meanwhile, speculation continues to surround the future of England white-ball coach Matthew Mott, with the Australian's position under threat as director of cricket Rob Key conducts a review following the limited-overs team's lacklustre defence of both their 50-over and T20 World Cup titles.""I don't know how it's going to work out to be honest, I haven't really followed it because you're worried about doing your own job,"" said McCullum.""Motty is a good bloke and a very good coach. Whatever happens he'll be fine.""","England coach Brendon McCullum says red-ball team has developed a ""harder feel"" England defeated the West Indies 3-0 in a series which marked the beginning of their home season.

'He should not need any motivation...': Ravi Shastri's advice to Hardik Pandya on captaincy snub,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-sri-lanka/he-should-not-need-any-motivation-ravi-shastris-advice-to-hardik-pandya-on-captaincy-snub/articleshow/112100836.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former Indian head coach Ravi Shastri set the future course for star all-arounder Hardik Pandya after he was passed over for the T20I captaincy . He advised him to play as much as possible and draw motivation from his team's recent heroics at the ICC T20 World Cup , which ended the Men in Blue's 11-year ICC trophy drought.As Rohit Sharma 's deputy during India's victorious ICC Men's T20 World Cup campaign, Pandya was among the favorites to inherit the role after Rohit departed from the competition.But when the team for the current tour of Sri Lanka was revealed, Hardik was just mentioned as a player. Shubman Gill was chosen vice-captain and Suryakumar Yadav as India's T20I skipper.In the end, Hardik's continued fitness problems were the main reason he lost the captaincy. Ajit Agarkar , the chief selector, tipped the scales against Hardik by stating at the pre-tour press conference that they favored a player whose availability was consistently dependable.In the latest edition of The ICC Review, Shastri offered valuable advice to Hardik on how he can return to his peak performance.""I think (it is) very important that he continues to play,"" Shastri said while speaking to host Sanjana Ganesan, as quoted by the ICC, as per ANI.""I believe match fitness is very important. So whatever T20I cricket there is, he should play as much as he can. And if he feels strong and fit, then obviously he comes into the side for the one-day game as well.""""But then again, the bowling becomes important. If you have someone coming and bowling just three overs in where you have to bowl 10 in a one-day game, then the balance of the side takes a hit.""""If you can bowl consistently eight to 10 overs every game and then bat the way he does, I think he'll play in one-day cricket as well,"" he concluded his point.From 2018, Hardik has struggled with serious injuries for an extended period of time.That year, in India's intense Asia Cup match against Pakistan in Dubai, Pandya was stretchered off the field after collapsing from a bowling strike, gripping his back in pain. After a stress fracture was identified, surgery and prolonged rehabilitation were required.Pandya made the decision to heal naturally, and he was able to recuperate in time for the 2019 ICC Men's Cricket World Cup. Later on in the year, though, his back problems returned, necessitating surgery.In a recent match between India and Bangladesh for the Cricket World Cup 2023, Hardik hurt his ankle trying to field the ball on follow-through.He was out of the game for a long time due to this injury, and he didn't play for his country again until the T20 World Cup.After coming back, Hardik showed everyone just how good of an all-round player he is, taking significant wickets and making big runs throughout the competition.India's 11-year trophy drought came to an end in the final thanks to Hardik's performance under duress, which included the important wickets of David Miller in the final over and the dangerous Heinrich Klaasen .In order to further highlight his abilities, the 30-year-old took two wickets and hit a crucial 22* during India's series-clinching victory over Sri Lanka on Sunday in Pallekele.According to Shastri, Hardik would have enough desire to return to full fitness based on his recent performances.""So I think it is up to him really, more than anything else,"" Shastri added.""He understands his body better than anyone. And I am sure, this will inspire him, especially with the way he did in the World Cup, the way he performed at the right times for India and the World Cup, so that should really get him going. He should not need any motivation to get his fitness right at the top,"" he concluded.",Ravi Shastri advises Hardik Pandya to play as much T20I cricket as possible. Pandya was passed over for the captaincy after Rohit Sharma's departure. Shubman Gill was chosen vice-captain and Suryakumar Yadav as India's T20i skipper.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112100797,imgsize-41750,width-400,resizemode-4/112100797.jpg"

With the series already secured following dominant victories in the first two games, India remain determined not to ease up.In the second T20I, India achieved a confident seven-wicket victory in a rain-shortened match, thwarting Sri Lanka's attempts to recover.Throughout the series, Sri Lanka's struggles have been evident, particularly with their batting collapses in the middle overs. Despite promising starts, the hosts faltered under pressure and failed to maintain momentum against India's formidable side.On the same day, the Sri Lankan women's team celebrated their maiden Women's T20 Asia Cup title with a victory over India in Dambulla. However, this success had little impact on the men’s side, continuing to face persistent issues.Team India has displayed their superiority, with Suryakumar Yadav leading effectively both in strategy and performance. He has made impactful bowling changes and contributed significantly with the bat, scoring 58 and 26 in the previous matches. India's aggressive approach from the start has been fruitful, including a formidable 200-plus score in the opener and a slight tweak in the batting order in the second game, leading to a seven-wicket win and sealing the series.Vice-captain and opener Shubman Gill, who missed the second game due to a stiff neck, remains a key player to watch. Sanju Samson, his replacement, had an unfortunate outing with a golden duck, but India will be seeking improved performances from the experienced batter.Yashasvi Jaiswal has been a standout performer, scoring 70 runs in two matches and posing a significant threat to Sri Lankan bowlers. For Sri Lanka, Pathum Nissanka , with 111 runs, and Kusal Perera, with 73, have shown promise at the top, but the middle order’s recurrent failures remain a concern.Indian spinner Ravi Bishnoi had a crucial impact in the second game with figures of 3/26, highlighting Sri Lanka’s difficulties against spin.""They play spin really well but I do not know what has happened, they are collapsing in the middle overs,"" Bishnoi remarked, suggesting a potential lack of skills and aptitude among Sri Lankan players across formats.Sri Lanka's bowlers, particularly Matheesha Pathirana, who had an expensive return of 4/40 in the first game, need significant improvement to salvage pride in the final match.As India aim for a whitewash, their aggressive gameplay and strategic execution will be closely watched, while Sri Lanka seek to avoid a clean sweep and conclude the series on a positive note.","India set to pursue a series whitewash against Sri Lanka in the third and final T20I on Tuesday.

Having controlled Madih Talal's delightful chip while beating an offside trap, David saw goalkeeper Subhajit Basu come out of line and coolly lobbed the ball over him.Cuadrat introduced Diamantakos and PV Vishnu in the second half and the Greek forward rose to the occasion in the 61st minute to make his debut special, meeting Mark Zo's cross from left and beating the goalkeeper in the air with a perfect header.Six minutes later, Saul Crespo sealed the deal. A link-up play with Diamantakos allowed Crespo to receive the ball on the edge of the box. With a half-turn the Spaniard left his challenger Arashpreet Singh searching for an answer and then beat the goalkeeper with a low shot which hit the inside of the post before going in.Both Mohun Bagan SG and East Bengal have started their campaign on a winning note but Cuadrat's side is leading Group A because of a better goal difference.Six group winners and two second-best teams would progress to the quarterfinals.","Dimitrios Diamantakos scored on his debut in East Bengal FC jersey as Carles Cuadrat's team began their Durand Cup campaign with a 3-1 win over Indian Air Force FT.

They collected just 21 points from 22 games and lost as many as 11 games.Speaking ahead of the game, Jamil said, “We’re on home turf, but that’s no excuse to take things lightly. We must approach this game with utmost seriousness and respect for our opponents. A good start is crucial, and every single player and staff member is focused and geared up for this match. We can’t afford to underestimate them — it’s time to put in the work and make our home advantage count.”The team has been putting in the hours and began their preparation midway into July. Jamil has also made numerous signings after penning a 2-year contract extension with the club. This week itself they have announced the recruitment of Javi Hernandez and Stephen Eze among the foreigners and Aniket Jadhav, Shubham Sarangi and Ashutosh Mehta among the Indians.Although Jamil has made it aptly clear that Assam Rifles are not to be taken lightly, it’s their second game against Chennaiyin that will test them to the fullest.Like JFC, the Marina Machans have also bolstered their squad with a number of signings and will be looking to put it past the hosts. The match will also see Own Coyle making a comeback to the city where he holds a special positon in the hearts of the JFC fans after he guided them to their only Shield win three seasons back.Meanwhile, a grand opening ceremony will be held at JRD Tata Sports Complex earlier in the afternoon.

Will support national team by developing players at Inter Kashi: Habas,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/will-support-national-team-by-developing-players-at-inter-kashi-habas/articleshow/112029904.cms,"Last season, Habas guided Mohun Bagan Super Giant to the ISL Shield triumph

Panaji:

Antonio Lopez Habas was close to becoming the national team coach until he was pipped at the post by FC Goa ’s Manolo Marquez , who will now do a dual job of coaching club and country.Habas remains the most successful coach in the Indian Super League (ISL), the top-tier league in the country, and believed he had more than a decent chance of stepping into the boots of Igor Stimac, sacked last month for his failure to steer India to the third round of the FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifiers.“I think I deserved the nomination (to coach the national team),” Habas told TOI after completing a surprise move to Inter Kashi in the I-League , Indian football’s second tier, on Thursday. “We won three (ISL) titles, played four finals and six semifinals. Within football (fraternity), I feel like another Indian. I have coached many players of the national team. I was not chosen, and I accept it. I will support the national team by developing players at Inter Kashi. It’s what I have done until now, and what I will continue to do.”Last season, Habas guided Mohun Bagan Super Giant to the ISL Shield triumph. But while title victories normally assure coaches of a contract extension, the experienced Spaniard was not considered, reportedly due to concerns over his health. Even while selecting the national coach, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) executive committee members made a mention of the 67-year-old’s age and health.Habas though said he has the same “strength and enthusiasm” as when he first arrived in India to take charge of Atletico de Kolkata and won the maiden ISL trophy in 2014.“I am very disappointed and saddened by the treatment that some journalists and others have given me, speaking about my health problems. Someone did it to justify my departure from Mohun Bagan, and at the same time, prevent me from training the national team. My medical tests are currently perfect,” said Habas.The serial trophy winner has won the ISL twice with ATK (2014, 2019-20) and the ISL Winner’s Shield with Mohun Bagan last season. Now, his focus is on ensuring that Inter Kashi – started last season – win the I-League and move to the ISL.Explaining his decision to take over Inter Kashi, Habas said the club’s “proposal is attractive, serious and ambitious.”“It offers me guarantees and seriousness to develop my work,” he said. “At the same time, it is a great responsibility to be able to have a great impact sportingly in such an important and fascinating region of India as Uttar Pradesh.”Besides winning trophies in India, Habas had a stint as Bolivia’s head coach and finished runner-up in the 1997 Copa America.Inter Kashi said Habas will spearhead a long-term project aimed at creating a sustainable football ecosystem in Uttar Pradesh. “This initiative will focus on the promotion of Inter Kashi to the ISL, ensuring the club competes at the highest level of Indian football.“Habas will also help Inter Kashi devise a concrete player pathway to Europe, collaborating with Inter Escaldes to establish a pathway for Indian players to gain opportunities in Andorra, providing them with invaluable international exposure and experience,” the club said in a statement on Thursday.","Antonio Lopez Habas was close to becoming the national team coach until he was pipped at the post by FC Goa’s Manolo Marquez.

Five first-team players – Samik Mitra, Bikash Yumnam, Vincy Barretto, Alexander Romario and Irfan Yadwad – have been included in the camp. What is the plan for them?

What do you make of the youngsters in the squad?

How has the preparation been so far?

Coyle is well known for his positive brand of football. Will the reserve team have a similar style of play going forward?

You have reunited with Coyle, after having worked at Jamshedpur FC. How does it feel?

CHENNAI: Chennaiyin FC ’s newly appointed assistant coach Noel Wilson said the club opted to play with the reserve team in the Durand Cup to ensure that the first-team gets a six-week pre-season ahead of the Indian Super League (ISL). In an interaction with TOI at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium – Chennaiyin’s current training base – Wilson spoke about head coach Owen Coyle’s plan for the main team, Durand Cup preparation and more.Excerpts:You (first team) need to have a six-week pre-season (ahead of the ISL), which is about one-and-a-half months. I think, after the Durand Cup, there is going to be a gap of two months. You cannot be stagnant in that period. Coyle will have better ideas. He does not want the main team to play in the Durand Cup as there are chances of players getting injured. Maybe he does not want to take risk with the main-team players. He knows what is right.The players who have come here did not get much game time last season. When you play competitive matches, your confidence level will increase. After playing here, they will perform better once they return to the main team.There are some young players who have good quality. They need the experience and exposure of playing with the bigger guys (seniors). The difference between playing in a reserve team and a senior team is huge. But I can see that there is potential.Besides players from the main and reserve teams, we have shortlisted a few players from the trials. The team is good; the young boys are working hard. No matter what the team is (opponent), you will win if you play well. That is what I believe in. I have asked the boys not to worry about the opponents, whether they are from the ISL or I-League.It is difficult to implement a style of play when you have only a month to prepare. We began training at the start of the month and our first match is on July 31. But in general, I like it when the boys keep the ball in the front (attacking areas). I do not want the boys to keep the ball at the back for a long time. I do not want them to do that because it might create problems; errors at the back could lead to goals. I would rather expect the players to take the ball forward and play in the opponent’s half. That will be safer for us.Coyle is a wonderful coach; we can see it in his personality and coaching. Last season, he got Chennaiyin to the playoffs. It is always good to work with good coaches.

Following these events, Bev Priestman , the head coach of the Canadian team, announced her decision to abstain from participating in the team's opening match of their Olympics gold medal defence against New Zealand.This series of events unfolded after French authorities detained a staff member for piloting the drone over New Zealand's training, an act aimed at gathering intelligence on their tactical preparations.The Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) has been informed of a second similar incident involving New Zealand, prompting an official complaint from the latter to the IOC integrity unit, seeking clarification and action from Canada.In response, the COC has engaged with both the IOC and FIFA.

As a result they struggled to impose themselves on the game in the way they decimated Police AC 6-0 in the previous match five days ago.However, the hosts went ahead in the second minute of the first first-half injury time thanks to an error of judgement from Railway FC goalkeeper Subhankar Dutta.As Musharaf sent a looping ball from the left into the box, it appeared more like a cross intended for his teammates. But the rival goalkeeper failed to judge the ball's trajectory as it sailed over him and nestled into the far corner of the net.Having broken the deadlock, East Bengal looked in control of the proceedings with more focus and hunger in the second half. Second-half substitute Ajad Saheem saw his shot blocked by the goalkeeper soon after his arrival. He came calling again, on the back of a sweeping move down the right before laying it off for Tanmay Das, who was denied by the goalkeeper again. The resultant corner, however, led to the second goal.Playing a quick 1-2 with Aman CK following a short corner, Musharaf whipped in a long cross.
