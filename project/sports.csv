Stephen A. SUSPECTS Micah Parsons' comments about Mike McCarthy is something bigger üëÄ | First Take

Cowboys legends, NFL analysts, and Micah Parsons react to McCarthy controversy



The Dallas Cowboys are having a tough season, and things are starting to heat up. With a disappointing 3-6 record, frustrations are building, especially after standout linebacker Micah Parsons made some controversial comments that have sparked backlash from fans and analysts alike. As the team faces mounting challenges, many are wondering if changes are on the way for the Cowboys.The Dallas Cowboys are in rough waters this season, facing mounting struggles and internal tension. With a disappointing 3-6 record under owner Jerry Jones and head coach Mike McCarthy , frustrations are boiling over‚Äîparticularly for standout linebacker Micah Parsons, whose recent remarks have drawn backlash from fans, former players, and analysts.Ex-NFL player Shaun Smith didn‚Äôt hold back, calling out Parsons for his comments on McCarthy and Rex Ryan. Smith fired back, ‚ÄúHe has that much time to listen to his critics? Go watch some film,‚Äù urging Parsons to focus on the field rather than off-field drama.Following the Cowboys' crushing loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, Parsons voiced his disappointment, shifting attention away from McCarthy's future and onto veteran teammates like Zack Martin, remarking,‚ÄúMike can go wherever he wants‚Ä¶ I feel bad for guys like Zack Martin who might be in their last year or on their way out.‚Äù This was perceived as a subtle jab at McCarthy, hinting that losing seasoned players like Martin would be a bigger blow than a coaching change.McCarthy addressed the team‚Äôs performance, calling out turnovers as ""unacceptable,"" while Jones acknowledged the gap, bluntly stating, ‚ÄúPhiladelphia is a high-caliber team. We‚Äôre not up to it.‚Äù (via: EssentiallySports)As leadership and accountability come into question, fans are left wondering if the Cowboys are heading for a major shake-up.Also Read: Jerry Jones‚Äô daughter Charlotte Jones pays tribute to Cowboys‚Äô veterans, replaces blazer with boxing gloves After the Cowboys‚Äô crushing loss to the Eagles, Micah Parsons‚Äô comments on head coach Mike McCarthy ignited a wave of reactions.

Sharpe claimed Jones ignored ‚Äúkey issues like the run game and defense,‚Äù fueling discontent within the team.Cowboys legend Michael Irvin offered a more diplomatic view, suggesting that while Parsons‚Äô choice of words was controversial, his intent wasn‚Äôt wrong. Parsons later clarified on his podcast, saying he ‚Äúnever intended to throw Mike McCarthy under the bus,‚Äù and wanted to honor longtime players like Zach Martin. The incident has fans wondering if this conflict will impact the Cowboys‚Äô already turbulent season.","The Dallas Cowboys are having a tough season, with a disappointing 3-6 record.

Problems galore as Tamil Nadu launch Santosh Trophy bid,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/problems-galore-as-tamil-nadu-launch-santosh-trophy-bid/articleshow/115322177.cms,"Tamil Nadu players and staff

Choosing 22 players from 580 in a space of a few days was the biggest challenge, says coach Nallappan Mohanraj

CHENNAI: The men‚Äôs football scene in Tamil Nadu has been far from ideal in the last six years. With the non-conduct of the CFA leagues since 2018 due to the long-standing dispute between the Tamil Nadu Football Association (TFA) and Chennai Football Association (CFA) ‚Äì they were hosted without recognition in 2022 ‚Äì the local players have been struggling for game time.In a bid to sustain their careers and make a living out of the sport, many TN footballers have been forced to ply their trade in other state leagues. The grim situation has severely impacted TN‚Äôs performances in the Santosh Trophy (National Championship), where the state team has been a mere participant in the last few years.Not much has changed in TN football in recent times, but newly-appointed head coach Nallappan Mohanraj is optimistic about restoring pride in the upcoming Santosh Trophy. TN have been pitted alongside Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Andhra Pradesh and 2022-23 champs Karnataka in Group G and will play their pool matches in Anantapur from Friday to Tuesday. As only one team will qualify from the group for the final round, the competition is going to be tough.""I played in the Santosh Trophy as a youngster and captained the team as well. Being with TN in my first assignment as a head coach is something memorable. I love being put in tough situations; staying comfortable makes me uncomfortable. I have always wanted to do something good while being put in a tough situation,"" Mohanraj, a former India defender, told TOI.""I had to assess about 580 players in just three days of the trials, so I do not know if they were able to show their full potential in the little time they got. I might have missed out on picking a promising player. I do not know when these players (22 members in the final squad) last played 90 minutes in a match, so I had to decide which aspect I needed to give more importance to ‚Äì fitness or tactics. It has been a huge challenge, but I have been trying to find solutions,"" said Mohanraj, who had worked with the India U-23 and U-20 teams.Mohanraj can rely on the experience of Ajith Kumar, Lijo Francis, B Sriram, Sinivasan Pandiyan and Alexander Romario Jesuraj, players who have competed in the top-two tiers of Indian football . ""I hardly had 10 days to work with the group. Adding experience while building a team is important; that is why I have opted to have at least one senior player in every area of the pitch. There has to be a good balance between youth and experience,"" added Mohanraj.Despite not having the best of build-ups, the chief coach is focused on the target. ""Our goal is to take TN to the final round. We did not have time to implement my philosophy, so I did not want to complicate our tactics. The boys know what I expect from them. I want them to do the basics right.""","Choosing 22 players from 580 in a space of a few days was the biggest challenge, says coach Nallappan Mohanraj.

However, even if they win all three matches against England, a place in the final is not guaranteed.England, under Ben Stokes' captaincy, lost 2-1 to Pakistan in their last Test series.""It's also an exciting time for Nathan to be brought into the Test squad for the first time,"" added Wells.""Nathan is an exciting talent with a proven first-class record and I‚Äôm sure he will bring a lot of skill and energy to the group.""Wells acknowledged the difficulty of leaving out Ajaz Patel.

KOLKATA: On Oct. 13, when Bengal was preparing to bid farewell to Maa Durga, Sanjoy Sen began his new journey.A total of 78 players assembled at the Salt Lake Stadium. And so commenced the selection trial for Bengal‚Äôs Santosh Trophy squad under the watchful eyes of coach Sen. Over the past few days, they were made to go through the grind and play four practice matches, including the one against I-League team Inter Kashi, before Sen picked his final 22 for the tournament.""When I watch a game ‚Äî be it a match from ISL or I-League or any other tournament ‚Äî I have this habit of taking note of the performance of any good player and keeping their names in my notebook.

They have also helped me pick my players. Robi Hansda, Israfil Dewan, Ayon Mondal and Aritra Ghosh ‚Äî they all have proved their worth in the CFL.

I'm not a person who wants to live in the past. Maybe, at that time players from Mohun Bagan, East Bengal and Mohammedan SC used to play for Bengal. From Latifuddin to Md Akbar and Xavier Pias they all played for Bengal in the Santosh Trophy and helped Bengali players grow as a whole. Now these three teams no longer allow their players to take part in the tournament. So, the present can't be judged in the light of what has happened in the past,"" said Sen, who has also managed Mohammedan Sporting and United SC in the I-League and served now defunct ATK as its head of youth development.""Moreover, when we used to rule Indian football, the game was limited to Bengal, Kerala, Goa, Punjab and Services. Now, 38 teams are playing in the Santosh Trophy this year. The game has expanded and it offers a more level-playing field,"" he remarked.A daily routine chart for the players hangs up on the wall of the dining room. Each morning it is shared with them on the specially-opened WhatsApp group. ""They must know what I want from them.

Mohun Bagan SG's ISL Shield-winning coach Antonio Lopez Habas, now serving the Varanasi-based team as a technical director, spoke highly of Sen's brigade after the match which Kashi won 2-0.Working a little away from the media glare and with the challenge of helping Bengal return to their days lost glory in Santosh Trophy for the first time in his 27-year-old coaching career, does he have a point to prove? Is there any self-motivating factor?""In our time, representing Bengal was itself an honour. But the players now know that unless they become champions or runners-up, they will not be noticed.

NEW DELHI: The Nations League match between France and Israel at the Stade de France on Thursday was overshadowed by tensions surrounding the ongoing conflict in Gaza.Despite the deployment of 4,000 security personnel, there were instances of booing during the Israeli national anthem and minor scuffles inside the stadium.The attendance of 16,611 was the lowest for the French national team at the Stade de France since its opening in 1998, with many fans opting to stay away due to security concerns.The sparse crowd was a reflection of the frictions surrounding the match, which took place against the backdrop of the Gaza war.While some Israeli fans defied their government's warning against travelling for sports events, anti-Israeli demonstrators gathered outside the stadium, waving Palestinian flags and protesting against the match.The protesters carried banners condemning the Gaza offensive, with one reading, ""We don't play with genocide.""Despite the tensions, the match proceeded without major incidents, ending in a goalless draw.Watch:French President Emmanuel Macron attended the game as a show of solidarity, emphasizing the need to combat anti-Semitism and violence.""We will not give into anti-Semitism anywhere and violence, including in France, will never prevail, nor will intimidation,"" he told France's BFM TV ahead of kickoff.The match highlighted the broader societal issues surrounding the Gaza conflict, with racism and intolerance on the rise in France and other parts of Europe.The clashes between Maccabi Tel Aviv fans and local groups in Amsterdam the previous week further underscored the potential for tensions to spill over into the sporting arena.While the match itself was a symbolic gesture of normalcy, the surrounding events and low attendance reflected the complex dynamics at play, with the Gaza conflict casting a long shadow over the sporting encounter.","The Nations League match between France and Israel at the Stade de France on Thursday was overshadowed by tensions.

Until last season, Goa were in the Elite category but were relegated after finishing at the bottom of the pool. This season, they topped the group and qualified, winning all their five matches. In contrast, Arunachal Pradesh lost all five games, the one in Goa in less than two days.After bowling out Arunachal for 84 in their first innings, Goa declared their innings at 727-2, with Kauthankar (314* off 215 balls) and Bakle (300* off 269 balls) putting on a record partnership for the third wicket. Arunachal's second innings ended at 92 in 22.3 overs, giving Goa a win by an innings and 551 runs, a Ranji record.Goa's 727-2 was their highest score in the premier domestic cricket tournament, but it was well short of the record in Ranji Trophy. That belongs to Tamil Nadu who declared their innings at a massive 912-6, incidentally against Goa in Panaji in 1989.In that game, Tamil Nadu's WV Raman and Arjun Kripal Singh had scored 313 and 302 runs, the first instance of two batters getting triple centuries.Arunachal 84 (Nabam Tagan Abo 25, Neelam Obi 22; Arjun Tendulkar 5-25, Mohit Redkar 3-15) & 92 (Nabam 31) Lakshay Garg 4-43, Deepraj Gaonkar 2-15, Keith 2-25) lost to Goa 727-2 (Snehal Kauthankar 314*, Kashyap Bakle 300*, Suyash Prabhudessai 73).",Goa's Snehal Kauthankar and Kashyap Bakhale put on the highest-ever partnership in Ranji Trophy history. The duo went past Maharashtra's Swapnil Gugale and Ankit Bawne's record 594. Goa's 727-2 was their highest score in the premier domestic cricket tournament. The highest partnership in first-class cricket is the 624 runs scored by Sri Lankan pair of Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene in 2006.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115319470,imgsize-574330,width-400,resizemode-4/115319470.jpg"

#LIVE: India preparations in Perth | 1st Test vs Australia | 1 Week To Go For #BGT | #BTB

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli will be in the spotlight as India prepare to face Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy , starting on November 22 in Perth. All eyes will be on the star batter as he aims to overcome recent struggles and make history on Australian soil.Despite a recent dip in form, Kohli has a strong track record in Australia, making it an ideal setting for him to rediscover his peak performance and leave a lasting legacy.Kohli is on the verge of achieving several significant milestones during this series.* One of the most notable milestones within Kohli's reach is surpassing Sachin Tendulkar 's record of 1,809 Test runs in Australia. Kohli currently sits at 1,352 runs in 13 Tests at an average of 54.08, needing 458 more runs to claim the top spot for an Indian batter.* Kohli is also closing in on the record for most Test centuries by a visiting player in Australia. He currently holds six centuries, putting him within striking distance of surpassing English legends Jack Hobbs (nine centuries) and Wally Hammond (seven centuries).* The Adelaide Oval holds a special place in Kohli's heart, as it's his most successful Australian venue. He has amassed 509 runs in four Tests there, averaging an impressive 63.62. With 102 more runs, he can surpass Brian Lara 's tally of 610 runs and become the highest-scoring visiting batter at this iconic ground.* Beyond Test cricket, Kohli is also in contention to top the list for most fifty-plus scores in international cricket by a visiting batter in Australia. He currently boasts an impressive 30 fifty-plus scores across all formats (11 centuries, 19 fifties), putting him in the running alongside legends Viv Richards (42) and Desmond Haynes (34).* Kohli's consistent performance in Australia extends to overall international runs. He has accumulated 3,426 runs across all formats, putting him 126 runs ahead of Sachin Tendulkar's record of 3,300 runs. He's also aiming to become the first Indian to reach 4,000 international runs on Australian soil, requiring 574 more runs to achieve this milestone.* The Adelaide Oval has been particularly kind to Kohli, as he's already notched five centuries at the venue. Scoring another century there wouldn't just make him the first visiting player to reach 1,000 runs at the venue, but also surpass Jack Hobbs' record of five centuries at the MCG.* This series will mark Kohli's 100th international match against Australia, likely during the third Test at The Gabba. This achievement would make him the second Indian to reach this milestone, joining the ranks of Sachin Tendulkar who has played 110 matches against the Aussies.* Kohli's current tally of 16 centuries against Australia puts him in a strong position to chase down Sachin Tendulkar's record of 20 international centuries against the Aussies.Having faced a challenging year with the bat, scoring just 488 runs in 19 matches across formats at an average of 20.33, Kohli will be eager to use this series as a platform for redemption. Australia has historically been a happy hunting ground for him, and his performance in this series holds the potential to shape not only the outcome of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy but also cement his legacy in Test cricket.The series begins on November 22 in Perth, followed by matches in Adelaide, The Gabba, and the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. The final Test will be held at the Sydney Cricket Ground from January 3, 2025.",Virat Kohli will be in the spotlight as India prepare to face Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

NEW DELHI: Australian Test opener Usman Khawaja emphasizes the depth of India's bowling attack ahead of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy , stating it's not just about Jasprit Bumrah While acknowledging Bumrah's impressive track record, Khawaja highlights the skills of Mohammed Siraj and Mohammed Shami ‚ÄúEveryone talks about Jasprit, but they actually have a lot of other good bowlers. I think [Mohammed] Siraj is a very good bowler. He's a very good bowler to both right-handers and left-handers. When [Mohammed] Shami was fit, when he was playing those series, he was a very good bowler. He was very underrated. No one really talked about him. And then they got good spinners lining up, too, which really complements their fast bowlers,"" Khawaja told Fox Cricket.""So for me it's never ... I'm just not thinking about Jasprit Bumrah. You want to ask me where do you think... I'm not thinking about where he is getting me out. I'm thinking about where am I scoring runs against him. And I'm sure all good batsmen would tell you exactly the same thing because if he misses, well, then I'm coming and then if he bowls good stuff, then I'll respect that. So that's just Test cricket,"" he added.He further explains his approach to facing India's bowlers, stating he focuses on scoring runs rather than worrying about getting out.The Border-Gavaskar Trophy commences on November 22nd in Perth.The second Test, scheduled for December 6 to 10 at Adelaide Oval, will feature the exciting day-night format under the stadium's lights.After that, fans will turn their attention to The Gabba in Brisbane for the third Test, which will be held from December 14 to 18.The customary Boxing Day Test, set for December 26 to 30 at Melbourne's storied Melbourne Cricket Ground, will bring the series to its penultimate stage.The fifth and final Test, to take place at the Sydney Cricket Ground from January 3 to 7, will serve as the series climax, promising a dramatic conclusion to an exciting contest.","Usman Khawaja emphasizes the depth of India's bowling attack ahead of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

A rare opportunity to bat at No. 3 was all Tilak Varma needed to justify skipper Surya Kumar Yadav 's faith. Having badgered his skipper to be allowed to bat at his favourite position, the southpaw seized the opportunity at SuperSport Park to score a marvellous 107 (56b; 8x4, 7x6), his first international century, and set up an 11-run win for India in the third T20I against South Africa.Varma had reservations about the dual nature of the pitch when he came in to bat. ""Bahut slow hai (it's too slow),"" he was heard telling partner Abhishek Sharma after he came out to face the third ball of the innings. A top edge that grazed the helmet proved a minor distraction and he soon found his bearings.""He (Surya) gave me an opportunity to bat at No. 3,"" Tilak said. ""I love to bat at No. 3 or 4, but in the last two matches I played at No. 4. Last night (on Tuesday), Surya came to my room and said that I'll bat at No. 3. I told him that I'll perform. That's why I pointed the bat at him,"" Tilak said of his celebration after reaching his maiden T20I century. Tilak was under a bit of pressure coming into this game ‚Äî his previous two outings in this fourmatch series at No. 4 saw him score 33 in Durban and 20 in Gqueberha.Earlier this year, in the IPL, Tilak suffered an injury and missed training for two months. Having missed two T20I series in the process, he needed a big knock to prove his mettle and regain confidence.""I suffered an injury in the last game of the IPL. I missed series in Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka. I was feeling very bad but I was patient and focused on my process. I worked very hard,"" Tilak said.Fortunately for him, the Indian team management has been very supporting and encouraging. With such emphasis on aggressive intent, the youngsters are looking to emulate the brand of cricket India played en route to winning the T20 World Cup this year. ""We had a lot of backing from the team. Even when we flop, we are told to play with positive intent.""We are the World Cup champions (T20), we should display our brand of cricket. There was no pressure. Even if we lose a wicket early, we're told not to worry. We followed the basics and played with positive intent,"" he said after India took a 2-1 lead in the fourmatch series.Back home, his coach Salam Bayash, who used to give him a 41-km scooter ride daily before Tilak's family moved closer to the academy, was naturally over the moon seeing Tilak score a hundred.""I have never seen Tilak so happy. He called me around 2.30 am (IST) after the match and expressed his joy over his first century. He is a very quiet lad. It was so heartening to see,"" Bayash told TOI on Thursday.The coach also backed his ward to do well in the red-ball cricket. ""He spends more time training with red ball than white. I am sure he will do well in Tests. He is definitely a three-format player. He has been working hard on his bowling too.""When he was out of the game for two months with injury to his left hand, he was nervous and tense. But he trained hard on his bowling and his fitness,"" Bayash added.","'We're T20 champions, we should display our brand of cricket,' says batter after scoring his maiden international ton.

NEW DELHI: Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting took a fresh dig at India head coach Gautam Gambhir after clarifying his remarks about Virat Kohli 's performance.Speaking on the podcast 'The Run Home with Joel & Fletch,' Ponting again labeled Gambhir as a 'prickly character'. He suggested that Gambhir's reaction, during the press conference before leaving for Border-Gavaskar Trophy (BGT), was influenced by India's recent Test series loss to New Zealand.""I'm not sure if I mentioned a couple of them [other Indian batters], but I reckon he's just throwing me in the deep end, trying to find their two most experienced and make sure when they come out, they put that back on me,"" Ponting said.In the lead-up to the BGT, Ponting had raised concerns about Kohli's form. He highlighted Kohli's declining home average, which has dropped to almost 30, with only three centuries in the past five years. However, Ponting also acknowledged Kohli's excellent track record in Australia, suggesting that this tour could be an opportunity for him to regain his form.Ponting believes Gambhir misinterpreted his comments and reacted emotionally, possibly due to the recent series defeat.""I think the hair on the back of his neck was already standing up. We got a bit of history as well, but he took a chance to fire back at me,"" Ponting said, adding that Gambhir seemed anxious and was looking for a reason to retaliate.Despite their differences, Ponting stood by his initial assessment of Kohli's recent form, attributing his concerns to the statistical decline in Kohli's performance. Ponting, however, expressed confidence that the Australian tour could be a turning point for Kohli.""I said if there ever was a tour where he [Kohli] could turn things around, it would be this,"" Ponting noted.","Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting takes a fresh dig at India head coach Gautam Gambhir after clarifying his remarks about Virat Kohli's performance.

However, Jansen's extraordinary hitting in the final overs nearly turned the match on its head, forcing India to dig deep for the win.Arshdeep, who finished with figures of 3/37, held his nerve in the last over, conceding only 13 runs and delivering the crucial breakthrough that ended Jansen's charge.

TURIN: Frances Tiafoe , who reached the semifinals of the US Open, received a substantial fine for his behavior during a match at the Shanghai Masters last month. While he will not be suspended from playing, the consequences of his actions are significant.The ATP , the governing body of men's professional tennis , announced that Tiafoe was fined a total of $120,000 for his outburst.The hefty penalty comprises two parts: the maximum on-site fine of $60,000 for verbal abuse and an additional $60,000 for aggravated behavior.Despite the severity of the fine, the ATP confirmed that Tiafoe would not face suspension and would be eligible to participate in upcoming tournaments.The incident occurred during Tiafoe's third-round match against Roman Safiullin, ranked 61st at the time. After a hard-fought battle, Tiafoe lost the match with a final score of 5-7, 7-5, 7-6 (5).Following the match, Tiafoe engaged in a profanity-laced tirade directed at chair umpire Jimmy Pinoargote, lasting approximately one minute. It was reported that Tiafoe used around ten expletives during this outburst.In the aftermath of the incident, Tiafoe took to social media to express remorse for his actions. He acknowledged that his behavior was unacceptable and apologized for his outburst.‚ÄúThat is not who I am and not how I ever want to treat people. I let my frustration in the heat of the moment get the best of me and I‚Äôm extremely disappointed with how I handled the situation.‚ÄùThe primary source of Tiafoe's frustration stemmed from a penalty he received for a time violation during the crucial closing tiebreaker.With the score tied at 5-5, Tiafoe was preparing to serve when the serve clock was about to expire. He tossed the ball in the air at the baseline, but umpire Pinoargote deemed this action insufficient to constitute a genuine attempt to serve.As a result, Tiafoe was penalized with a fault, costing him his first serve. While he initially protested the decision, he continued playing but ultimately lost the point and the subsequent point, leading to his defeat.Despite the heated exchange, Tiafoe displayed sportsmanship by congratulating Safiullin at the net after the match concluded. However, he then turned towards the umpire and began shouting expletives.Tiafoe then moved to the other side of the net, positioning himself closer to his chair, and voiced his discontent, asserting that the umpire's decision had negatively impacted the match's outcome.Tiafoe's impressive run to the US Open semifinals in 2022, where he faced eventual champion Carlos Alcaraz, solidified his status as a rising star in tennis.

TURIN (Italy): He's got a stranglehold on the No. 1 ranking. He's unbeaten this week and hasn't dropped a set. And his home Italian fans can't get enough of him.Things couldn't get much better for Jannik Sinner at the ATP Finals so far ‚Äî despite an ongoing doping case that likely won't be decided until early next year.Sinner and US Open finalist Taylor Fritz advanced to the semifinals on Thursday at the season-ending tournament for the year's top eight players.Sinner won the round-robin group after a 6-3, 6-4 victory over 2020 champion Daniil Medvedev; and Fritz advanced in second after rallying past Alex de Minaur 5-7, 6-4, 6-3.Sinner was already assured of a spot in the last four before his match against Medvedev but still extended his winning streak to nine matches. Sinner beat Fritz in the U.S. Open final in September for his second Grand Slam title.‚ÄúI hope this match gives me confidence for the semifinals, where I'm hoping to raise the level,"" Sinner said. ""But honestly, I'm happy with the level I'm playing at right now.‚ÄùSinner is playing at home for the first time since it was announced before his U.S. Open title that he tested positive in two separate drug tests this year.A decision to clear Sinner of wrongdoing was appealed by the World Anti-Doping Agency in September and a final ruling in the case is expected in 2025.Medvedev, who won one of three matches, and De Minaur, who didn't win any, were eliminated.Last year, Sinner lost the final to Novak Djokovic , who pulled out injured this year.Alexander Zverev leads the other group ahead of Casper Ruud, Carlos Alcaraz and Andrey Rublev.Sinner took the edge in his career meetings with Medvedev at 8-7 ‚Äî after Medvedev swept their first six matches.‚ÄúHe's in full confidence right now,‚Äù Medvedev said. ‚ÄúI watched his practice before the match ‚Äî barely misses a shot and he hits strong. Many times a lot of players that don't miss a lot, at least they don't hit strong. He can hit strong ‚Äî very strong, probably one of maybe top three, four, five hitters on tour, and doesn't miss.‚ÄùFritz improved to 4-5 in his career against De Minaur and could pull level next week in a quarterfinal matchup between the United States and Australia at the Davis Cup Finals.‚ÄúI feel like he typically plays better in the team environment. I also feel like I play better in the team environment,"" Fritz said. ""It's still going to be a nightmare to play him next week, too.‚Äù","Jannik Sinner and Taylor Fritz advanced to the semifinals of the ATP World Tour Finals. Sinner won the round-robin group after a 6-3, 6-4 victory over 2020 champion Daniil Medvedev. Fritz advanced in second after rallying past Alex de Minaur 5-7,6-4, 6 -3. Last year, Sinner lost the final to Novak Djokovic.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115318456,imgsize-45082,width-400,resizemode-4/115318456.jpg"

(AP)

Taylor Fritz moved closer to the semis of the season-ending ATP Finals after the American beat Alex de Minaur 5-7 6-4 6-3 in their last group game on Thursday, but he will have to wait and see if Jannik Sinner can take a set off Daniil Medvedev .The match also marked the first time a deciding set was played at this year's tournament as Fritz bounced back from a set down with a dominant display in the second before running away with the third set.US Open runner-up Fritz can qualify for the final four if Sinner takes a set in his match against Medvedev. But the American will be eliminated if Medvedev beats Sinner in straight sets.Seventh seed De Minaur, meanwhile, goes home without winning a single match in the Ilie Nastase group on his tournament debut.""He was all over me (in the first set). What I did a great job of was in the second set, towards the end of the second set, I really started to find my serve,"" Fritz said.""I started serving much better and then that allowed me to just stay with it and create more pressure on his service games... It just gave me a little bit of comfort to just stay in the match and not be under so much pressure all the time.""The two played some entertaining tennis in the opening set, including a 30-shot rally which De Minaur won with a passing shot while Fritz walked back to the baseline with a wry smile.De Minaur converted the all-important break at 5-5 and served for the set, sealing it with an ace, which also confirmed world number one Sinner as the first semi-finalist.De Minaur, however, needed to win the second set comfortably to stand a chance of advancing to the semi-finals and the Australian saw his slim hopes of going through evaporate when Fritz levelled the score at one set apiece.That was all the motivation a fired-up Fritz needed as he raced into a 4-1 lead to gain control of the decider while De Minaur crumbled. At 5-3, Fritz had three match points and took the contest with an ace.""I think all of us are pretty beat up, but if I'm in the semis of the World Tour finals, I've got energy to give it for the semis,"" Fritz added.",Taylor Fritz beats Alex de Minaur 5-7 6-4 6-3 at ATP World Tour Finals.

Ruud misses chance

TURIN: Carlos Alcaraz opened his account at the ATP Finals on Wednesday with an entertaining 6-3, 7-6 (10/8) win over Andrey Rublev , while Casper Ruud missed an early chance to reach the semi-finals after losing in straight sets to Alexander Zverev .World number three Alcaraz comfortably defeated Rublev to lift himself off the bottom of the John Newcombe Group and looked in much better form despite struggling with fatigue and illness in the lead-up to the match.There had been some doubt as to whether Alcaraz, who lost his opening match in straight sets to Ruud, would continue in Turin after quickly ending his training session on Tuesday, with his coach Juan Carlos Ferrero saying that he had trouble breathing.""I could be better, I'm not going to lie,"" said Alcaraz on court after beating Rublev.""I've been struggling with my health the last week and today I thought I was going to feel better. I was OK to play, but thinking about the first match I was thinking a lot about that I was sick, that I couldn't play.""Today I really wanted to step on the court and just think about tennis , try to play a high level... When I played the first match I felt like I did not entertain the people, I did not play good tennis.""Alcaraz, who has won the Wimbledon and French Open titles this season, cruised to the first set in 38 minutes, breaking Rublev in game seven and quickly winning the next two to go one set ahead.And although the Spaniard had a harder time of it in the second set, he delighted the spectators with a series of spectacular shots which suggested he might be approaching his best form.Rublev meanwhile drops to last place after losing his sixth straight Finals match, although he put up a battle and had two opportunities to win the second set.Alcaraz winning in straight sets meant that Ruud would have reached the semi-finals with a match to spare if he had beaten two-time Finals champion Alexander Zverev in the day's late match.However, Zverev put on a punishing display to prevail in straight sets 7-6 (7/3), 6-3 and all-but ensure a spot in the last four with his second win from as many matches.Zverev took charge of the match in the tie-break at the end of a first set, which before then had gone entirely with serve, and the pair exchanged blows until the German broke in game eight of the second set and then served to love to win the match.""I think it was a very good match actually from both of us,"" said Zverev on court.""I'm happy to win today but it was very, very close. One or two points decided the first set and I thought the level was very high from both of us.""Leader Zverev can eliminate Alcaraz in his final match of the group stage on Friday, when Ruud takes on Rublev.On Thursday, world number one Jannik Sinner will reach the last four if he claims a single set against Daniil Medvedev , and will top the Ilie Nastase Group with a third straight win.","Carlos Alcaraz beats Andrey Rublev 6-3, 7-6 (10/8) at ATP Finals.

Spain's Carlos Alcaraz shrugged off respiratory troubles to reignite his ATP Finals campaign with a decisive win over Russia's Andrey Rublev on Wednesday.Despite being under the weather and sporting pink nasal tape for better breathing, the four-time Grand Slam winner triumphed with a 6-3, 7-6(8) scoreline. Alcaraz, seeded third, appeared much sharper compared to his previous group-stage defeat to Norway's Casper Ruud .After splitting the first six games, Alcaraz broke Rublev‚Äôs serve with a blazing forehand and quickly secured five consecutive games to take control. Though Rublev, ranked world number eight, fought back in the second set and came close to securing break points at 2-2, he missed a routine ball after a drop shot attempt.The thrilling match concluded with Alcaraz saving two set points in the tiebreak before claiming victory.
