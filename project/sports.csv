However, the BCCI has not yet provided their approval for the proposed schedule.The Champions Trophy is planned to take place from February 19 to March 9, with March 10 designated as a Reserve Day.It is believed that PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi who attended the T20 World Cup final in Barbados as an invitee, has submitted a schedule consisting of 15 matches. All of India's games have been allocated to Lahore, citing security and logistical considerations.""The PCB has submitted the draft of the 15-match ICC Champions Trophy. Seven games in Lahore, three in Karachi and five in Rawalpindi,"" an ICC Board member said.""The opening match will be held in Karachi with two semifinals in Karachi and Rawalpindi, final in Lahore. All India matches (including semifinal, if the team qualifies) in Lahore,"" the source added.India find themselves in Group A, alongside their traditional rivals Pakistan, as well as Bangladesh and New Zealand. Meanwhile, Group B features cricketing powerhouses Australia, South Africa, England, and the rising Afghanistan team.In a recent development, Chris Tetley, the ICC head of events, held a meeting with Mohsin Naqvi in Islamabad. This meeting took place following a comprehensive inspection of the venues and other arrangements by the ICC's security team.Pakistan's most recent experience hosting a major cricketing event was the Asia Cup in 2023. The tournament was conducted using a unique 'Hybrid Model' due to the Indian government's refusal to allow its players to travel across the border into Pakistan. As a result, India's matches were played in Sri Lanka, while the rest of the tournament took place in Pakistan.""All board chiefs of the ICC Champions Trophy participating countries (minus BCCI) have assured him of their complete support but BCCI will consult its government and update the ICC,"" the source added.The ICC finds itself in a challenging position, as it lacks the authority to compel any cricket board to act in opposition to its government's directives. The BCCI is faced with a complex decision, and the cricketing world eagerly awaits its final stance on the issue.","Champions Trophy is planned to take place from February 19 to March 9, with March 10 designated as a Reserve Day.

If the ankle injury prematurely ending his ODI World Cup last year was not enough, the jeers he received at the Indian Premier League (IPL) before the T20 World Cup and personal troubles off the field damaged his spirits. But the allrounder and India's T20 vice-captain demonstrated exceptional resilience and determination to overcome adversity and turn the tables in a matter of three months.Pandya's return to Mumbai Indians (MI) replacing Rohit Sharma as skipper initially sparked anger among fans.The transition was not well-received, and Pandya faced the brunt of the fans' discontent. It had a detrimental effect on his personal game, besides five-time IPL champions MI enduring one of their poorest seasons.Additionally, there were unconfirmed reports of a separation from his wife, Natasa Stankovic, adding to the personal challenges he faced.When Pandya first led the Mumbai Indians side in Ahmedabad for their season opener, he was met with boos, heckles, and negativity from the fans. Even at his first home match at the Wankhede Stadium, the harshest response awaited him during the toss. The situation escalated to the point where commentator and former India and Mumbai cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar had to intervene, urging the crowd to ""behave"" during a toss against Rajasthan Royals.However, the tide turned dramatically with Pandya delivering India's T20 World Cup-winning over in the final against South Africa, ending with three wickets to lead India's bowling charts in the title clash.As Pandya landed at the Wankhede Stadium on Thursdya after India's victory parade through the Marine Drive in Mumbai, he was greeted by deafening cheers from a vast sea of fans filling the stadium. The past negativity had been replaced by overwhelming support and admiration for the resilient cricketer who had overcome so much to reach this point.""See you soon, Wankhede,"" wrote the World Cup champion as he posted his selfie with the trophy before the parade here.The stadium erupted with chants of 'Hardik… Hardik', echoing through the stands.As the team arrived at the airport, Pandya was among the first to emerge, proudly holding the trophy high on his shoulder. He led the way to his 'homeground', where thousands of fans had been waiting for hours to catch a glimpse of the coveted prize.Despite concerns about potential chaos and stampedes, the atmosphere remained celebratory as everyone came together to cheer for India's heroes. Pandya joined the open bus ride for a couple of hours before making his way to the Wankhede Stadium.Virat Kohli, during his speech, highlighted Suryakumar Yadav's crucial catch in the final over, which was off Pandya's bowling. The mention of this moment triggered thunderous cheers from the Wankhede crowd, who united in their appreciation for Pandya's performance, chanting 'Hardik… Hardik' in unison.""The biggest turnaround happened in terms of (when) he was included. We could bat deep and we had an extra bowling option. In last ODI World Cup final we missed him,"" a fan said, talking to PTI.""The biggest testament is Hardik's mental strength, he was booed in the (first game) here against CSK. But still he did not hit back, kept his head down and kept working.""All the hate he got was unwarranted. The owners took him in, he had nothing to do with it. There was no point booing him...Obviously, we did not qualify (for the IPL 2024 playoffs) but we are just here to celebrate him and smile all day,"" he added.""The problem with us MI fans is that we have very short memories. Now we are going to cheer ‘Mumbaicha Raja Hardik Hardik'. We will accept him as MI captain now,"" he said.“IPL is different from international cricket, it is purely entertainment cricket. I am happy for him, he scored runs and took wickets that too at the crucial times. We needed that (Heinrich) Klaasen wicket (in the final),” said another fan Srinivas Reddy, who finished work in his job at a bank in Hyderabad at 3:30 am and caught an early morning flight to Mumbai.",Hardik Pandya's return to Mumbai Indians initially sparked anger among fans.

The next youngest team member is Lan Yao, 23.The other players are in their 30s and 40s.Fide's July classical rating list ranks Bodhana as the top under-10 girl in the world. On Fide's blitz list of top 100 girls born after 2003, she is ranked 58th with a 2185 Elo rating, despite being the youngest on the list.One of her new teammates, Jovanka Houska (44), said: ""I can tell you one thing - I've had a lot of players say to me they're terrified of playing her. A 9-year-old that's close to 2200 - that's scary.""Last year, Sivanandan became England's first world youth chess champion in 25 years when she won the triple crown with titles in classical, rapid and blitz competitions in the girls' under-8 category. She followed up by winning the woman's award in the European Women's Blitz Championship in Croatia.""I'm so pleased to be picked for England, it's a great honour and I'm looking forward to being part of the team,"" she said.She picked the game up during lockdown, aged five, when a friend of her father's was clearing out his garage. One of the items he was throwing away was a chess set which Tamil Nadu-born Sivanandan brought home, intending to give it to charity. She peered inside the bag and was curious about the chess pieces such as the king and the knight. She started watching YouTube videos of chess and playing online against strangers.Velayutham thinks his daughter was drawn to the royal associations of chess. ""She likes the royal stories and family. I think that's why she thought this looks interesting,"" he told the Daily Telegraph.Now she aspires to become a grandmaster, the highest title in international chess, as well as women's world champion. She currently holds the title of Woman FIDE Master. Malcom Pein, a selector for the England team, said: ""At nine years of age, she must surely be the youngest to be selected to represent England in any international sporting competition.""He said the chess craze in the UK has been triggered by Netflix's 'The Queen's Gambit', which has created millions of new players and a golden generation of emerging talent, that also includes Bengaluru-born English chess player Shreyas Royal (15), the world's top under-10 player Ethan Pang (9) and Supratit Banerjee (9), the world No. 7 in the under-10 category.Together with Sivanandan, they will all be at the ChessFest, a free chest festival, in Trafalgar Square on Sunday, taking on chess enthusiasts across the country. It is organised by the charity 'Chess in Schools and Communities'.","Bodhana Sivanandan, 9, is the youngest member of England's women's chess team.

If you have a look at what this team did, they were champions in every different field. So while there was 'Player of the Tournament'Jasprit Bumrah , who absolutely totally deserved to be the 'Player of the Tournament', the main man running the show was Rohit Sharma.""So Rohit's captaincy is something that has to be admired because never once during tense situations did his body language go down. Yes, we have all got used to some of his grimaces and stuff like that, but that's okay...The way he handled the situation when it was not looking good for India, that is deserving of the highest praise.""Thus, Gavaskar's verdict was unequivocal.""That is why his captaincy was the standout Indian performance of the tournament for me.""He was further quizzed on where does he rank this World Cup win, considering he too has experienced it when India lifted a World Cup (ODI) for the first time in history, in 1983.""It's going to be pretty much at the top because of the expectations factor, the pressure of expectations that this team had over the last 17 years, ever since India won the first ever T20 World Cup in 2007,"" Gavaskar said.He added that with the introduction of the Indian Premier League (IPL), the expectations from the team at T20 World Cups only rose.""Then the IPL started in 2008, where India got to play so many T20 matches with and against some of the best players in the world. India were expected to win the T20 World Cup after that practically every single time,"" he said.That pressure understandably increased, especially after 2013 when India won the Champions Trophy. For 11 years after that, the team kept losing in the knockouts of the ICC tournaments, be it the ODIs, Tests or T20 World Cup, with the latest being the heartbreaking defeat in the final of the 2023 ODI World Cup against Australia.""This time around, the pressure was even more because the last couple of times, India got to the semifinals and the finals but were not able to win it. So the pressure was at its peak. Therefore, to come through that pressure and win is absolutely terrific,"" said Gavaskar.","Sunil Gavaskar says Rohit Sharma's captaincy was the standout Indian performance of the tournament. India won their second T20 World Cup on June 29, beating South Africa by seven runs in the final. The 2024 T20 world champions arrived home in the early hours of Thursday morning from Barbados.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111494578,imgsize-52948,width-400,resizemode-4/111494578.jpg"

'We are ready to take a bullet for our Men in Blue'

The sea looked bluer on the reclaimed-land side on Thursday evening. After their delayed departure from Barbados due to a hurricane, Rohit Sharma 's T20 World Cup winning Team India returned home to a different kind of storm with cricket-crazy Mumbaikars filling the stretch from Nariman Point to Wankhede stadium and making the open top bus carrying India's cricket heroes happily, gently and proudly cut through the surging sea of admirers, each eager for a glimpse of the champions.Hours before the team even landed in Mumbai from Delhi well past 5pm, after having met PM Modi in the morning on touching down in the national capital, tens of thousands of cricket fans had flooded the route from the NCPA gates ignoring the showers, winding their way towards Wankhede which had been thrown open for a late-evening felicitation.Some climbed trees, some tore through barricades, and everyone clicked away furiously on their cell phones as the team finally made its grand appearance atop a blue bus. Captain Rohit Sharma, flanked by Virat Kohli , Hardik Pandya , Suryakumar Yadav, and other teammates, held the trophy high, waving to the delirious masses. The air was electric with chants of 'Mumbaicha Raja, Rohit Sharma' and 'Boom Boom Bumrah'. As the parade inched forward, the frenzy left behind a scattering of shoes in its wake, evidence of the near-stampede excitement of the moment.After the bus reached Wankhede, the team did a lap of honour amid resounding applause, with Rohit dedicating the T20 WC title ""to the entire nation"".BCCI office-bearers felicitated the team and presented it with a cheque of Rs 125 crore. ""The huge turnout of fans shows they were as desperate for this T20 World Cup title as we were,"" said Rohit.""I am going to miss this love. What I saw on streets tonight, I won't forget it,"" said outgoing coachRahul Dravid .So jubilant were the crowds from late afternoon that nothing mattered to them except the excitement and anticipation of the team's parade though they found themselves, for quite some time, at the mercy of nature's whims. First, the sun baked them to a crisp. Then the skies opened up. Yet everyone stood patiently for over four hours and soaked it all in as part of the celebration, with intermittent roars of ""India! India!"" at full pelt.A gang of 20 friends, all clad in their own version of a Team India jersey, made the long journey from the western suburbs of Kandivli to the city's southernmost tip. As the train doors opened, they poured out onto the platform, waving the tricolour, blaring vuvuzelas and taking turns to chant the names of each one of their cricketing heroes.Among them was Rajendra Damle, 20, who tried to capture the emotion of the moment. ""It's hard to explain the feeling. It's just pure joy,"" he said, his eyes sparkling. ""They've won, but it feels like we've won. We're a part of this and want to celebrate with them.""Beside him, Kreena Vaghel, 18, nodded enthusiastically. ""It's also our chance to show them how much we respect and adore them,"" she added. Together, they joined the throngs along Marine Drive, ready to celebrate their heroes' victory as if it were their own.High schoolers Aditya, Agastya, Sanchay, and Jainit made the trek from Goregaon to join the crowd. ""Surya Kumar Yadav's catch was one of the best moments in the final,"" they chorused, still buzzing with the thrill of the win.""This victory has been healing for us after the November 2019 ODI World Cup final loss against Australia. We had to cheer for our men in blue."" Agastya could barely contain his enthusiasm. ""Excited to see Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, we'll be trailing them from NCPA to Wankhede. Rain or sun doesn't matter.

The poster read: ""End of an Era: India won, but lost these diamonds… Please don't go."" It was a heartfelt plea that captured the sentiment of many, amid the celebratory atmosphere of the parade. ""I made this poster because I feel so emotionally attached,"" she explained. ""I can't bear the thought of their retirement from international T20s and India playing without them.""Meanwhile, N B Chittalwala from Mumbra, Thane, busy scouting for a good vantage point for his wife and two daughters, 13 and 4, reminisced, ""In 1983, my father took me to the airport to see the World Cup-winning team. Later, I was part of Dhoni's 2007 T20 winning parade, too. Now it's my turn to give my daughters the same experience.""Amid all the 'Rohit,' 'Dhoni' and 'Virat' t-shirt-sporting fans, Pradeep Gond from Kandivli took his fandom to the next level. His t-shirt read 'Akaay' on the back-the name of Virat Kohli's son. ""That's also my one-month old son's name,"" Pradeep said.
