Former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif has softened his earlier stance on calling for a boycott of the upcoming T20 World Cup, admitting that the moment for such a move has passed. While ruling out a full withdrawal, the former wicketkeeper-batsman floated a different form of protest, suggesting Pakistan could take part in the tournament but decline to play fixtures against India. He stressed, however, that any such call would have to come from the Pakistani government rather than the cricket board.“If the government says we won’t play against India, the ICC will have to accept it,” Latif said. “If they don’t, that’s where the real confrontation begins.” Asked what would happen if India and Pakistan met in the final, Latif replied, “nahi khelenge’ (we won’t play)”.Latif, who had earlier urged Pakistan to boycott the World Cup to challenge what he described as India’s influence over global cricket administration, said on Wednesday that the opportunity slipped away when the Pakistan Cricket Board did not act immediately after Bangladesh were excluded from the event.“The time for a strike has passed,” Latif said on the YouTube channel CaughtBehind. “Every decision has a timing. When the iron is hot, that’s when you strike. That time was last week during the ICC meeting.”Bangladesh were replaced by Scotland after 14 votes went against their participation, with the ICC citing logistical and contractual issues. Pakistan backed Bangladesh in the vote but eventually went along with the final decision.“We showed our support. We voted for them. That chapter is over,” Latif said. “If we boycott now, it won’t have the same impact.”Pakistan chairman Mohsin Naqvi had hinted earlier this week that the board could consider a principled stand similar to Bangladesh’s, but no formal announcement followed. The T20 World Cup will go ahead with Pakistan participating under a hybrid model, with matches involving India scheduled at neutral venues until 2027.",Former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif has softened his earlier stance on calling for a boycott of the upcoming T20 World Cup.

OPS makes AIADMK reunion pitch: Why is he desperate ahead of Tamil Nadu elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ops-panneerselvam-makes-aiadmk-reunion-pitch-palaniswami-why-is-he-desperate-ahead-of-tamil-nadu-elections/articleshow/127774845.cms,"'To Remove Corrupt DMK': TTV Dhinakaran Meets Goyal As AMMK Rejoins NDA Ahead Of Tamil Nadu Polls

OPS's reunion pitch: A challenge or a last attempt?

Why EPS rejected the offer

Why OPS looks desperate ahead of 2026 polls

3 scenarios for OPS ahead of assembly election

Scenario 1: Backdoor NDA entry via AMMK (most likely)

OPS joins NDA through Dhinakaran's AMMK arrangement.

Gets 2–3 seats from AMMK's quota.

Stays in the game, avoids total invisibility.

Risk

Scenario 2: Go solo-lite with BJP support (possible)

OPS contests with BJP backing, either on BJP's symbol or as an Independent.

Helps BJP widen footprint in the south.

Keeps OPS out of AMMK shadow.

Risk

Scenario 3: AIADMK reunion miracle (least likely)

EPS allows a return under some formula.

OPS returns with symbolic honour.

Reunion narrative energises some cadres.

Risk

NEW DELHI: Expelled AIADMK leader O Panneerselvam (OPS) on Thursday publicly declared that he was ""ready"" for reunification with Edappadi K Palaniswami ’'s (EPS) AIADMK faction ahead of Tamil Nadu 's 2026 assembly polls.At a press meet in Madurai, OPS threw a pointed challenge at both EPS and AMMK general secretary TTV Dhinakaran, asking whether they were prepared to take the leap. ""I am ready for that. Are they ready?"" he said, invoking the possibility of rival factions closing ranks under the NDA umbrella.But EPS's response was a door-slam: ""There is no chance of admitting OPS into AIADMK. OPS has already been removed from the basic membership position."" EPS cited the party's general council, which had expelled OPS in 2023, saying there could be no re-induction.The sharp exchange has reopened a question Tamil Nadu politics has been quietly circling for months: what does OPS do in 2026. A three-time chief minister and once a stand-in in AIADMK for J Jayalalithaa after her death, why is he pushing so hard now?OPS's reunion line comes amid a BJP-driven effort to revive and expand the NDA alliance in Tamil Nadu. With BJP increasingly invested in forging an anti-DMK front, the party has been nudging splintered AIADMK factions to align, or at least avoid damaging vote-splits.In that backdrop, OPS framed reunification as the ""natural"" outcome if EPS and Dhinakaran who were bitter rivals could close ranks. If such a rapprochement is possible, he argued, what stops his return?OPS also returned to his familiar ideological peg: the restoration of MGR-era by-laws and ""cadres' rights"".His committee, later evolved into a kazhagam, he said, exists only to reclaim the party's original rules, not to become a full political party for 2026.When asked about reported talks with BJP's Tamil Nadu in-charge Piyush Goyal and rumours of a 2-seat offer, OPS refused to answer directly, calling it ""parama ragasiyam"" (a profound secret). Dhinakaran, meanwhile, positioned himself as mediator, urging OPS to join NDA to revive the ""Amma regime"".EPS's refusal is being framed by his camp as a matter of party discipline and organisational authority.AIADMK leaders point to the 2023 general council decision expelling OPS for ""anti-party activities"", saying it was a unanimous verdict by a council of over 2,500 members. EPS has repeatedly argued the party cannot return to ""dual leadership"" politics, and that the focus is to defeat the DMK with a consolidated NDA.The BJP too has indicated where it stands. Union home minister Amit Shah has backed EPS as the NDA's leading face for the 2026 contest, with decisions on the future shape of the alliance to be taken post-election.In other words, OPS's biggest problem is not just EPS. It is that the BJP's Tamil Nadu unit has moved on without him.OPS’s urgency is rooted in one blunt reality - political isolation is fast turning into electoral irrelevance.He is a former chief minister with three stints, but in Tamil Nadu’s current alliance arithmetic, OPS has limited negotiating power. This is because he no longer controls three negotiation essentials - a party, a symbol or a demonstrable seat-winning base.In the last two election cycles, OPS has failed to convert name recognition into measurable electoral influence. In 2021 assembly polls, his camp failed to emerge as a force. In the 2024 Lok Sabha election, OPS did not win a seat, contesting as an Independent under the jackfruit symbol, which he described as a ""test of cadre support"" for his reunification pitch.Meanwhile, OPS has also been structurally locked out of the AIADMK. EPS’s camp points to OPS's 2023 expulsion for ""anti-party activities"", endorsed by a 2,500+ member general council, making re-entry not a matter of personal goodwill but a question of organisational authority. Without access to district units and booth machinery, OPS is left with .just sentiment politics and not the election machinery.The bigger squeeze is coming from the NDA itself. BJP, which once saw OPS as a useful fracture point inside AIADMK, now appears firmly invested in EPS-led consolidation. In this ecosystem, OPS is being offered only a small role: TOI sources suggest 2–3 seats, either through AMMK's quota or a BJP-backed independent route.That might be why OPS is pushing ""reunion"" so publicly. In 2026, his fight is not for power, but to stay politically alive.Apart from this, OPS is also facing a personal political deadline. At around 75, he has limited time to rebuild. His reunion pitch for EPS can therefore be read not only as a negotiation tactic, but also a legacy attempt - a final effort to remain relevant in the story of AIADMK after Jayalalithaa.With EPS shutting the door, OPS effectively has only three options left ahead of assembly poll:: Becomes a junior player under Dhinakaran and BJP, with limited voice.: Without AIADMK machinery, OPS may remain confined to pockets.: EPS may only accept him on strict terms, or not at all.OPS's recent ""I'm ready for reunion"" pitch is not merely a message to EPS or Dhinakaran.It is a signal to the BJP-led NDA: don't finalise 2026 election plan without me. But Tamil Nadu's political reality is unforgiving. Currently, the NDA alliance math is being built around EPS-first consolidation and OPS is being negotiated not as a central point but as a marginal add-on, with talk of only 2–3 seats.That is why he has wrapped a survival bid in the language of legacy - MGR by-laws, cadre rights and unity.The question now is simple: will the AIADMK gates reopen for OPS, or will 2026 mark his last election appearance as a consequential player?","Expelled AIADMK leader O Panneerselvam (OPS) publicly declared that he was ""ready"" for reunification with Edappadi K Palaniswami ’'s (EPS) AIadMK faction ahead of Tamil Nadu's 2026 assembly polls.

Bangladesh crash out of U19 World Cup; BCB flags 'unfair schedule' by ICC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/bangladesh-crash-out-of-u19-world-cup-bcb-flags-unfair-schedule-by-icc/articleshow/127779209.cms,"File photo

Bangladesh’s campaign at the Under-19 ongoing World Cup has ended amid criticism from the country’s cricket board over match scheduling and travel arrangements. The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has accused the International Cricket Council (ICC) of unfair scheduling, saying repeated travel affected the team during the tournament.The issue comes at a time when the BCB has already been at odds with the ICC following its decision not to send the senior national team to India for the T20 World Cup, after which Bangladesh were replaced by Scotland. Now, BCB game development coordinator Habibul Bashar has raised concerns about the U19 team’s travel plan during the World Cup.""More than the approach, I think our calculations were lacking [against England and India]. But this [travel schedule] is something I want to highlight, even if people think I'm making excuses,"" Habibul told Bangladesh news outlet The Daily Star.He added, ""To avoid the boys getting too tired before the India match, the BCB actually paid for an internal flight out of its own pocket because the bus journey was too long and direct flights were scarce.""As per The Daily Star report, Bangladesh head coach Naveed Nawaz and several players expressed frustration over the schedule.The team had to travel from Harare to Bulawayo, a journey of nearly nine hours by bus during the monsoon season, ahead of their opening group match.Due to the importance of matches against India and New Zealand, the BCB arranged and paid for internal flights. However, the travel demands continued, with the team returning to Harare by bus for their match against the USA on January 23, before travelling again for the Super Six game against England in Bulawayo on January 26.“The schedule was very unfair to us. During the initial schedule, we were supposed to play two of our warm-up matches in Masvingo and travel to Bulawayo, which is a four-hour drive, for our opening two group-stage matches. Later, they [ICC] suddenly changed the schedule, and it meant we had to play two of our warm-up games at different venues, travelling back and forth,” Bashar said.He added, “We notified them [of the travel burden] before the tournament started. We asked them to move our practice games to avoid the back-and-forth travel, but they didn't listen. Once the tournament starts, you can't really change these things.”",Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has accused the International Cricket Council (ICC) of unfair scheduling.

Trae Young honors John Wall



John Wall celebration night highlights Wizards legacy



Trae Young made his presence felt in Washington without logging a single minute on the court. As the night was devoted to celebrating John Wall’s legacy, the Wizards guard showed a heartfelt gesture. Young, who is currently sidelined by injury, chose a different way to honor the franchise icon.Washington’s celebration night for Wall was full of emotion. The former No. 1 overall pick returned to the city that defined his career. Further, Young’s tribute created a link between two eras.Trae Young wore Wall’s No. 2 Wizards jersey while sitting on the bench as Washington hosted the Milwaukee Bucks. The image quickly spread across social media, symbolizing a league-wide acknowledgment of Wall’s place in NBA history. Young later explained why the moment mattered to him.“That’s my guy, we know each other for a minute now,” Young said. “And so for me to be here in DC, for him having night like this, I am sure we’ll have nights like this in future for him. I show support, I show love, cuz he has this place rocking. I mean it’s only right we celebrate John.”Young also reflected on competing against Wall earlier in his career and the respect that came with it.“I think that’s the hard part about coming in as a rookie. You’re going against guys that you grew up watching,” he said. “As much as I was a fan of him, I needed to compete, and I knew he was going to come at me the same way.”The Wizards honored Wall with a full celebration that matched his impact on the franchise. The first 15,000 fans received a John Wall bobblehead, and his sons, Ace and Amir, served as honorary captains. Wall addressed the crowd and thanked the city that supported him through his rise.“First and foremost, I want to thank all y’all for coming out,” Wall said. He also expressed gratitude to the organization. “I want to thank the Wizards organization for giving me an opportunity to live out my dream to make it to the NBA.”Wall closed with words that defined his bond with Washington. “I never thought this was possible. I love y’all. This is my city. This is still my house. And I love y’all and thank y’all for the night.”Wall retired in August 2025 after nine seasons in Washington, where he became the franchise leader in assists and steals.",Trae Young wore John Wall’s No. 2 Wizards jersey while sitting on the bench as Washington hosted the Milwaukee Bucks.

NBA court safety talks between the league and the Cavaliers move forward



Luka Doncic injury reignites NBA court safety questions



Is Luka Doncic alright?



Luka Doncic’s visit to Cleveland took an unexpected turn Wednesday night. The game shifted the attention from basketball to player safety inside Rocket Arena. A frightening fall near the sideline left the Los Angeles Lakers star dealing with left ankle soreness. The incident has reportedly forced the NBA to confront a long-discussed structural concern tied to the Cavaliers’ court design.Within hours, league officials and the Cavaliers moved toward formal discussions, turning a near-miss involving one of the game’s biggest stars into a league-wide topic. Doncic walked out of the court and headed to the locker room, but returned later, assuring that he was alright. Still, many questioned the court, including Lakers head coach JJ Redick.The NBA and Cleveland Cavaliers are scheduled to discuss potential changes to Rocket Arena’s raised court following Luka Doncic’s fall, according to The Athletic. A league spokesperson confirmed the renewed dialogue, stating, “While improvements have been made to the arena floor over the years to address this issue, the NBA and the Cavaliers are revisiting the situation given the incident last night.”Cleveland remains the only NBA team with a court elevated roughly 10 inches above the rubber mat covering the hockey rink below.Floor seats sit on that rubber surface, creating a visible gap along the sideline. Doncic stepped backward into that opening while landing from a shot attempt.The Lakers became the second visiting team to file a formal complaint. The Miami Heat raised similar concerns in November 2023 after guard Dru Smith suffered a season-ending knee injury in the same area. The National Basketball Players Association has resumed discussions with the league, describing the setup as a player safety concern.Cavaliers officials maintain the court meets league standards. A team spokesperson said, “The basketball court layout and design at Rocket Arena is fully compliant with NBA rules and has been in place for [20-plus] years, with ongoing collaboration and regular evaluation between our organization, the league and independent flooring experts to support player safety and performance.”Coaches across the league echoed familiar concerns after Wednesday’s scare. Lakers coach JJ Redick did not hold back, saying, “It is absolutely a safety hazard. And I don't know why it's still like that. I don't. You know, you can lodge formal complaints. A lot of times you don't see any change when you lodge a formal complaint.”The issue stands out because most NBA arenas either place courts closer to the underlying surface or position courtside seats directly on the playing floor. Cleveland’s configuration leaves room for missteps, even if incidents remain rare.Doncic returned to the game after heading to the locker room and finished with 29 points, easing immediate fears. Afterward, he reflected on the moment, saying, “It wasn’t a great feeling, and, looking back at the video, I think I got a little bit lucky.”He remains questionable for Friday’s game in Washington due to ankle soreness. His availability will be monitored closely.",Luka Doncic's near-miss with the Cleveland Cavaliers turned attention to court safety.

Stefon Diggs highlights Terrell Williams return inspires Patriots ahead of Super Bowl

The New England Patriots are heading back to the Super Bowl, and this season has been about more than wins and stats. Behind the victories, the locker room has rallied around a story of resilience. Terrell Williams, the team’s defensive coordinator, battled prostate cancer earlier this season. His return to the sidelines for Super Bowl LX has inspired every player on the roster.The Patriots’ season was remarkable. After back-to-back 4-13 seasons, QB Drake Maye threw for 4,394 yards and 31 touchdowns, and the team went 9-0 on the road, a first in NFL history. But it was New England’s defense, shaped by Williams’ schemes, that carried them in the playoffs, including a 10-7 AFC Championship win over the Denver Broncos.Patriots WR Stefon Diggs spoke at Gillette Stadium about the impact of Williams’ comeback. He said, “This team has been through a lot. A lot of guys have had family issues, things happen, and health issues. Another road warrior. We have got a lot of love and respect for Coach T and his strength. "" WR further added, ""Even when we see him around the building, everybody is smiling. Everybody is hollering at him.""Terrell Williams, 51, was diagnosed with prostate cancer in September 2025.During his treatment, linebackers coach Zak Kuhr took over play-calling duties, but Williams remained involved in game planning and team meetings. His return for the Super Bowl adds both stability and inspiration to a defence that allowed just 26 points over three playoff games.Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel shared that defensive coordinator Terrell Williams will travel with the team to Santa Clara for the Super Bowl. He’s doing good,” HC said. “He’s excited about travelling with us. I appreciate you asking. Doing well, so we’re excited about having him.”As Williams undergoes treatment, he often stays with the team. And now that the legend is in good health and is about to make a trip out west, the players couldn't be more happier.The Patriots face the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl LX on February 7, 2026, in San Francisco. While the matchup promises fireworks, Williams’ return is the emotional core of the team. For New England, his presence is a reminder that resilience, unity, and determination define a season just as much as touchdowns and sacks.","New England Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel shared that defensive coordinator Terrell Williams will travel with the team to Santa Clara for the Super Bowl.

Why Kyle Tucker Would Have Fit Toronto Blue Jays’ Long-Term Plan

Toronto Blue Jays (Image Source - Getty Images)

What Each Side Would Have Gained

The Risks That Would Have Come With It

If Kyle Tucker had reached the open market instead of signing with the Los Angeles Dodgers in January 2026, the Toronto Blue Jays would likely have emerged as one of the most aggressive teams in pursuit.Tucker is one of the rare players who checks every box. He brings power without selling out his approach, plays strong defense in the outfield, and is still firmly in his prime. Players like that almost never become available, which is why his hypothetical free agency would have reshaped conversations across the league. Toronto, facing growing pressure after several playoff appearances that failed to produce a deep run, would have been well positioned to act.The Blue Jays have hovered on the edge of true contention for years. They’ve had talent, depth, and pitching, but the lineup has often lacked a single, game-altering presence who changes how opponents plan an entire series. Tucker fits that role cleanly. He’s not just another bat in the order; he’s the type of hitter who forces pitchers to work differently and reshapes how defenses align.Timing would have mattered as much as talent. With the Houston Astros managing payroll constraints and Tucker nearing the most expensive years of his career, the idea of him becoming available had already loosened the market.For Toronto, this would not have been about adding depth or chasing marginal gains. It would have been a direct attempt to raise the team’s ceiling and move from contender to legitimate title threat.Any discussion around Kyle Tucker begins with contract reality. Industry expectations suggest his next deal could comfortably exceed $400 million, a figure that would place him among baseball’s highest-paid players. For Houston, moving him before that point would have meant gaining young, controllable talent while avoiding a massive long-term obligation.Toronto, meanwhile, would have seen a rare opening. The organization has both the prospect depth and the competitive urgency to justify a major swing. While any deal would have required real sacrifice, either top prospects or players ready for everyday roles, the payoff would have been immediate. This would have been the type of move that defines an era rather than supplements it.From Toronto Blue Jays’ point of view, adding Kyle Tucker would have solved multiple problems at once. He offers consistent middle-of-the-order production, with a track record of strong averages, power, and run creation. That kind of reliability has been uneven in recent Blue Jays lineups, especially when games tighten late in the season.There’s also the matter of presence. Tucker carries star weight. His arrival would have sent a clear message to both the clubhouse and the fanbase that the front office was willing to push beyond comfort to chase a championship.For Tucker, Toronto would have represented a chance to step into a major market with a competitive roster already in place. The environment would have supported both performance and profile, while positioning him for the type of long-term contract his production suggests is coming.The cost would not have been light. Toronto would have needed to part with valuable future assets, potentially thinning out depth that matters over a long season. There’s also the reality of Tucker’s recent injury history, including time missed in 2024, which adds uncertainty to any long-term commitment.For Houston, moving on from a cornerstone player would have meant an immediate hit to star power and lineup balance. The success of such a move would hinge entirely on how quickly and effectively the return pieces developed.Tucker himself would have faced the pressure that comes with a new league, a demanding market, and heightened expectations. Toronto is not a quiet place to struggle, especially for a player brought in to change outcomes.Had Tucker not already committed to the Dodgers, Toronto would have been one of the clearest teams ready to move first and spend big. The fit made sense in terms of timing, roster construction, and competitive goals. While the risks would have been real on every side, so would the upside.Also read: MLB trade rumors: New York Mets exploring blockbuster move for $116.5 million Arizona Diamondbacks star following Jeff McNeil exit Deals like this don’t just alter a single roster.

Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

NEW DELHI: Former India men’s hockey team coach Michael Nobbs, who reintroduced Aussieslike aggression and counter-attacking styles of field play after the team had fallen into the rut of European defensive skill sets, passed away at his home in Melbourne on Thursday after losing a long-running battle with lung cancer, which was first detected in March 2020.Nobbs, who coached the Bharat Chettri-led men’s side at the 2012 London Olympics, was 72. Nobbs’ India coaching stint lasted from June 2011 to July 2013.Nobbs was a member of the Australian team at the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles. His subsequent transition to full-time coaching made him one of the most respected tacticians in world hockey.He focused on counter-attacking strategies inspired by Australian methods and relied on a scientific approach.

Jayden Daniels and his mother, Regina Jackson, spark outrage with a heartwarming clip



Regina Jackson has been a strong support to Jayden Daniels



Jayden Daniels, the 25 year old popular quarterback of the Washington Commanders, went through a series of injuries this year but he had his mother, Regina Jackson, by his side as she supported him through tough days.Over the last few years, Jayden Daniels has shown the world how he loves to pamper his mother, Regina Jackson, but this has raised eyebrows among fans. Now, a resurfaced clip of the two has sparked outrage and divided fans.A few hours ago, a heartwarming clip of Jayden Daniels celebrating his mother on Mother’s Day 2024, by taking her shopping at Neiman Marcus, sparked panic among fans.The clip might have been a collaboration that the Washington Commanders’ star player had with the brand. While the clip is itself heartwarming and shows a close bond between the two, fans are divided about it.A fan by the username @ShevyBoiMusic wrote, “That lady needs a husband, She thinks her son is her husband”, while another fan by the username @ogshavers posted, “This sh*t getting creepy.”A third fan by the username @kitfistokesherb wrote, “It’s cool that he loves his mom a lot but stop loving her in our face so much, dude.”However, neither Jayden Daniels nor his mother, Regina Jackson, has commented on the criticisms yet as they continue to remain silent.This isnt the first time that the popular mother son duo have been criticised for the close bond they share.Back in May 2025, Regina Jackson opened up her bond with Jayden Daniels on The Pivot podcast.Jayden Daniels’ mother said, “The thing is, he doesn’t know what he doesn’t know and he knows football and he does it very well… but he doesn’t know the business world,” she said. “He doesn’t know the predators or the vultures that could be out there.”Regina Jackson added, “So he feels very comfortable in knowing that not only am I educated and qualified to do it, I’m also his mom.”","A heartwarming clip of Jayden Daniels and his mother, Regina Jackson, has sparked outrage among fans.

Roman Reigns continues to define WWE dominance

Brock Lesnar and Cody Rhodes headline the money matchups

The WWE Royal Rumble 2026 is already poised to be one of the most exciting editions of the over-the-top rope classic in years. As WrestleMania 42 approaches, the men's Royal Rumble match should see a strong mix of current stars and legends from this generation. Many of the biggest names in WWE are on the cusp of battling one another for the right to headline WrestleMania, and fans around the globe have their eyes firmly trained on this year.This year goes beyond quelling championship aspirations, though, as the Rumble is designed to showcase WWE's biggest global draws and highest earners. Wrestlers like Roman Reigns, Brock Lesnar, and Cody Rhodes not only draw eyeballs into the ring, but they also represent the lowest-paid wrestlers in the company. It lends credibility to the event and also reiterates the bottom-line influence of WWE’s elite talent.As we move toward the Royal Rumble 2026, one of the biggest names in professional wrestling remains Roman Reigns. He, billed as the face of WWE for the better part of the last 10 years, still garners huge amounts of fan interest and television viewership. Any return to the Royal Rumble automatically makes that match a bigger deal, because every time a former Undisputed Champion sets foot in the ring, the title picture gets turned upside down.Financially, Roman Reigns stands among WWE’s elite. His estimated net worth is believed to be around $18 million, earned through long-term WWE contracts, merchandise sales, premium live event bonuses, and media appearances. Reigns’ ability to maintain star power while working a selective schedule has only increased his value to the company. If he advances deep into the Rumble match, it could signal another headline WrestleMania run.The Beast Incarnate himself remains the most well-built and bankable WWE talent in the company's long history. Lesnar is still a special attraction whenever he shows up, known for his explosive in-ring style and crossover fame from MMA. This is estimated to be in the range of $20 to $25 million, putting him among the richest WWE superstars ever. Even sporadic appearances create big news, which is why he's a major player in the Royal Rumble landscape.Fans can see that Cody Rhodes is all that WWE believes their contemporary victory. Rhodes restored his status as an A-level star and now occupies main-event territory as the top babyface. Estimates put his net worth at over $8 million, due to stable merchandising and high-end event revenues, along with WWE management's long-term faith in his booking. Again, he has a shot at the title after his Royal Rumble showing and is back in line for WrestleMania success.","The WWE Royal Rumble 2026 is poised to be one of the most exciting editions of the over-the-top rope classic in years.

What the Rolex agreement means for LIV Golf’s future

LIV Golf has secured a surprising partnership with luxury watch brand Rolex. The deal links one of the PGA Tour’s biggest sponsors with LIV Golf, but with clear limits. Rolex will not appear as a full on-course sponsor at LIV Golf events. Instead, the agreement focuses only on premium hospitality access. The move signals growing acceptance of LIV Golf while also showing that major brands remain cautious. According to reports shared by golf industry insiders, Rolex will not place its iconic clocks on LIV Golf courses.This is a major shift from its long-standing role on the PGA Tour, where Rolex branding is highly visible. The agreement allows Rolex customers to attend LIV Golf events through exclusive hospitality experiences. It does not include broadcast branding, on-course signage, or title sponsorship rights. This structure protects Rolex’s global image while still testing a relationship with LIV Golf. For LIV Golf, even a limited association with a $12 billion brand is seen as a major step forward. The league has recently retained top players and continues to push for Official World Golf Ranking status.The Rolex deal shows that LIV Golf is attracting interest from elite sponsors, even if cautiously.By focusing on hospitality rather than branding, Rolex avoids public alignment with the league’s ongoing disputes with traditional golf bodies. At the same time, LIV Golf gains validation by partnering with a luxury brand trusted across professional sports. Industry analysts note that this type of deal could open the door to similar partnerships. Other sponsors may follow with low-risk agreements before committing fully. For LIV Golf, this approach builds credibility without forcing brands into controversial exposure. It also strengthens LIV Golf’s appeal to high-end fans who value premium experiences.LIV Golf's contract with Rolex solidifies the assumption that LIV is on solid ground. This contract backs many LIV players like Rahm and DeChambeau to remain committed to LIV Golf for the long term. Other players, like Koepka, went back to how they played before LIV Golf. As this loyalty has been essential in keeping LIV Golf moving forward at such a crucial time, we know that if LIV Golf earns an Official World Golf Ranking, the commercial value of LIV Golf will skyrocket, and this may lead Rolex and others to increase their future sponsorship involvement. For now, Rolex and LIV Golf have a selective relationship regarding this partnership that is a good sign for LIV Golf's future. The Rolex limited partnership, combined with some of the professional golf world's previous reluctance to partner with LIV Golf, demonstrates how much progress LIV Golf is making in the professional game of golf. There is a lot of cautious optimism about how the major brands perceive LIV Golf in their respective sponsorship strategies.","LIV Golf has secured a surprising partnership with luxury watch brand Rolex.

Broncos QB Bo Nix fires back at Sean Payton for crossing a line on injury update,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/broncos-qb-bo-nix-fires-back-at-sean-payton-for-crossing-a-line-on-injury-update/articleshow/127777021.cms,"Image via IMAGN

What Sean Payton said about the injury

Bo Nix pushes back publicly

Denver Broncos quarterback Bo Nix has broken his silence after head coach Sean Payton made public comments about his ankle injury, turning a routine medical update into an uncomfortable public exchange.The disagreement comes days after the Broncos’ season ended in a narrow 10-7 loss to the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game. Nix missed the game after fracturing his ankle late in the Divisional Round win over the Buffalo Bills, an injury that required surgery and sidelined him at the worst possible moment.While addressing the media after the season-ending loss, Payton suggested that Nix’s ankle injury was not entirely unexpected. The Broncos coach said doctors found a condition that made the ankle “predisposed” to injury, adding that it was “not a matter of if, but when.”Payton also referenced Nix’s past ankle issues from his high school and college days, framing the injury as something that was likely to happen sooner or later. Though the comments appeared to be made in a matter-of-fact tone, they quickly drew attention around the league.Nix did not agree with that assessment and made his feelings clear when he met reporters later in the week.The 25-year-old quarterback directly contradicted Payton’s remarks, insisting there was no pre-existing condition.“Nothing was predisposed. Nothing was there originally,” Nix said. “It was just an unfortunate landing.”More importantly, Nix questioned why details of his medical and surgical history were discussed publicly at all. He said he did not believe that information should have been shared, especially when it was not fully accurate.“I don’t think he really should share how many surgeries I’ve had in the past,” Nix added, noting that his coach did not have the full details.The situation has drawn extra scrutiny because of the timing. Nix was unable to play in the biggest game of his career, watching from the sidelines as Denver’s Super Bowl hopes slipped away. Backup quarterback Jarrett Stidham struggled in difficult conditions, and the Broncos’ offense managed just seven points.In that context, Payton’s comments struck some as unnecessary, even if unintentional. For a franchise that sees Nix as its long-term quarterback, any hint of tension between player and coach is far from ideal.Nix has said he is on track for a full recovery, with a four-to-six-week rehab timeline and no lingering concerns. While this public disagreement has raised eyebrows, many around the league expect it to fade as the offseason progresses.",Denver Broncos quarterback Bo Nix has broken his silence after head coach Sean Payton made public comments about his ankle injury.

Sanju Samson or Ishan Kishan? | Greenstone Lobo predicts the ideal player for T20 World Cup

Virat Kohli's handle is back

The cause of the panic earlier

NEW DELHI: After hours of confusion, concern and meme-fuelled speculation on Friday morning, India's batting legend Virat Kohli ’s Instagram account is back online. India’s most-followed Instagram handle, which had suddenly disappeared earlier on Friday, reappeared without any official explanation from either the former India captain or Instagram, bringing relief to millions of cricket fans who had feared something was amiss.Kohli’s verified account — followed by over 274 million users — had vanished from searches and Instagram page, with fans encountering the familiar message: “This page isn’t available.” The unexplained blackout triggered widespread panic across social media, with supporters flooding platforms like X and Instagram in search of answers. As speculation snowballed, no clarification emerged from Kohli, his management team or Meta, leaving fans to fill the silence with theories, humour and concern.The sudden return of the account later in the day has eased nerves, but the lack of an official statement has kept the mystery alive. It remains unclear whether the disappearance was the result of a technical glitch, a temporary deactivation or a platform-related issue.During the brief outage, fans even turned to Kohli’s wife, actor Anushka Sharma, flooding her comment sections with anxious and playful messages asking about the cricketer’s missing account.Anushka, who has largely stayed away from the spotlight in recent months, did not respond publicly, consistent with the couple’s recent preference for privacy.Adding to the intrigue, Kohli’s brother Vikas Kohli’s Instagram account was also reported missing during the same period, further fuelling speculation. Meanwhile, Kohli’s account on X remained active throughout, though he did not address the Instagram episode there either.The blackout came at a time when Kohli has been in strong cricketing form, recently enjoying a productive run in international cricket and gearing up for the upcoming IPL 2026 season with Royal Challengers Bengaluru. His Instagram account, a major hub for brand collaborations, personal updates and fan engagement, is considered one of the most influential athlete profiles in the world.For now, the King is back on Instagram — but with silence from all sides, fans are still waiting for answers on what caused India’s biggest social media scare of the day.","Virat Kohli's Instagram account is back online after disappearing on Friday morning.

Shivam Dube press conference: On mindset shift, reading bowlers and dominating middle overs

Poll Do you believe Shivam Dube will significantly impact India's performance in the upcoming T20 World Cup? Yes, definitely Maybe, depends on form No, unlikely

It’s hard to find positives in a 50-run loss in a T20I game but the Indian team won’t be too unhappy with what transpired in the fourth T20I in Vizag. The 23-ball 65 by Shivam Dube after a top-order wobble was a reminder to opposition teams about the dynamite batter India will have up their sleeve in the middle order in the T20 World Cup starting next month.IPL watchers will know that teams are wary of using spin against Chennai Super Kings ’ Dube after the 10th over. In CSK, where the gentle giant has been playing since 2022, Dube has flourished in this role.Incidentally, Dube had made his T20I debut for India before he played for CSK. But in the 13 T20Is that he played before that as a middle-order batter who could bowl medium-pace, the left-hander failed to carve his niche. CSK first took note of him during an inconsequential IPL game in Abu Dhabi in 2021, when they had already qualified for a top-two finish.In that match, Dube was playing for Rajasthan Royals. Chasing 190, Dube came up with a 42-ball 64 which led to CSK’s defeat. MS Dhoni and CSK coach Stephen Fleming identified the talent that Dube had against spin and in the auctions for the 2022 edition, he was picked for Rs 4 crore.Still, Dube wasn’t a sure-fire selection. Before the IPL, five-time champions CSK had a training camp in Surat.During that camp, Dube’s over-boundaries, using his long levers against spin, were often beating MS Dhoni’s sixes by 20-30 metres. Some of those sixes even broke the window panes in the fourth-tier balconies of the stadium.That show convinced the management of his big-hitting abilities but Dube’s CSK stint hadn’t started on a happy note. He had given away 25 runs in the 19th over against LSG in Mumbai and had become a bit of a villain for the fans of the ‘Yellow Army’. But Dhoni stressed that bowling wasn’t the reason CSK had bought Dube and persisted with him purely as a batter.The temperamentally sound southpaw eventually announced himself with a 46-ball 95 against RCB in Mumbai, when he took down the likes of Wanindu Hasaranga and Glenn Maxwell. He hasn’t looked back since and despite several attempts by other franchises to lure him out of CSK, the team management has stuck with him, making him one of their highest-paid retainees for Rs 12 crore.While Dube has gone from strength to strength with his performances against spin, sometimes his technique against genuine pace has been a bit of a worry. The short ball has troubled him on and off but Dube has worked on it. These days, he is quite effective against medium-pacers, as was evident on Wednesday when he took on the likes of Zak Foulkes and Jacob Duffy.But during his four-year stint in CSK, one area that has been neglected a bit is his bowling. Due to the impact player rule, the think-tank hasn’t found the necessity to give him enough overs. But the Indian team management wants to use his bowling skills as well and in the Asia Cup final against Pakistan in Dubai last year, he was given the responsibility of opening the attack in spinfriendly conditions.Dube has developed a clever change of pace and the occasional wide yorker. One feels he isn’t too far behind with the ball to Nitish Reddy, who is being prepared as a back-up mediumpace allrounder for Hardik Pandya .",Shivam Dube has flourished in the middle order for Chennai Super Kings.

Shivam Dube press conference: On mindset shift, reading bowlers and dominating middle overs

Poll What do you think was the main reason for India's loss against New Zealand? Batting collapse Bowling performance Poor decision-making

VIZAG: Captain Suryakumar Yadav ’s decision to go with specialist bowler Arshdeep Singh in place of batter Ishan Kishan, who had suffered a niggle, didn’t produce the desired result in the fourth T20I against New Zealand on Wednesday. India suffered a 50-run loss at the ACA-VDCA Cricket Stadium chasing 216 but the captain was unperturbed, knowing that going in a batter short was a gamble. And, as he revealed in the post-match presentation, he wanted to put the team in that situation and see how it copes.“We purposely played six batters. We wanted to have five bowlers and challenge ourselves. We wanted to those who are part of the World Cup squad. We have been doing well batting first, we wanted us to see how we bat when we are two or three down chasing 180-200,” he said.Sanju Samson’s struggles continued, compounding his misery ahead of the World Cup but it was Shivam Dube who came good with a 23-ball 65, laced with three boundaries and seven sixes. He also raced to India’s third fastest fifty in 15 deliveries.The primary reason for Dube’s inclusion was to take down the opposition spinners and be the enforcer at the death.On Wednesday, he tore into Ish Sodhi for 29 in his third over — with three huge sixes and two fours — and then took on pacer Jacob Duffy, clearing the ropes twice to keep India in the hunt.Dube revealed that he has been working on his game against the pacers as well.“The match-ups are important. They (team management) want me to take on the spinners. That is my role, to get the strike rate high in the middle overs. But it is not just against spinners but fast bowlers as well. I know where my strength is,” he told reporters.Dube also felt that he is more mature now with more internationals under his belt. “I’m getting better with my mindset because I am batting in such situations. I’m bowling a lot now, thanks to Gauti bhai (coach Gautam Gambhir ) and Surya. They have given me bowling opportunities too. When you bowl, you become smarter. I am batting in that situation and I can think what the bowlers are planning,” he added. Since becoming an integral part of the team, the allrounder has been working on improving all aspects of the game.“I’m working hard to develop more skills. When you play matches regularly, that experience comes in handy. For me it is important to upgrade with each game. I try to be a little better, smarter with each game,” he said.Asked about his 15-ball fifty, he said, “I was trying to play the ball on merit. The kind of talk we have with captain and coach, we play the situation. When I see an opportunity to attack, I go for it. That is where I try to keep the momentum going.”Dube sent Mitchell Santner over midwicket for a six off the first ball he faced and the New Zealand skipper professed his admiration for Dube’s power-hitting skills.“I’ve seen him do that a lot. When the spinner comes on, he knows that that’s a good match-up for him. He’s going to take it on. If he’s going like that, it’s pretty tough to stop him,” said Santner.","Shivam Dube hit 23-ball 65, laced with three boundaries and seven sixes.

Lucknow doctors prise out bullet ‘wandering’ in 3-year-old’s brain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/in-rare-surgery-kgmu-docs-removebullet-wandering-in-3-yr-olds-brain/articleshow/127781620.cms,"Representative image





LUCKNOW: Doctors at King George's Medical University (KGMU) dealt with an extremely rare and complex case in which a bullet kept moving inside the brain of a three-year-old child since December 16. Lakshmi was playing on her rooftop in Lucknow's Indiranagar when a stray bullet hit her on the evening of Dec 16. She was first taken to a nearby private hospital and later referred to KGMU as her condition deteriorated.Dr Ankur Bajaj of KGMU's neurosurgery department, who operated on her, said the injury was caused by the bullet entering the head through the left frontal bone, the front part of the skull near the forehead. ""This is known as a penetrating head injury, where an object enters and travels into the brain,"" he said.The surgery was tricky as the bullet kept changing its location.A CT scan done at a private hospital about four and a half hours after the incident showed the bullet near the front surface of the brain. However, when the child was brought to KGMU the next day, a repeat CT scan done nearly 20 hours after the injury revealed that the bullet had moved deep into the basal region of the brain.""This movement was extremely dangerous as this area controls vital functions like breathing, movement and consciousness,"" said Dr Bajaj.Doctors feared damage to major blood vessels, which could cause life-threatening bleeding. To assess this risk, they planned a CT angiography, a special scan to study blood vessels.""However, to our surprise, the CT angiography done about 25 hours after the injury showed that the bullet had moved again, this time to the occipital region at the back of the brain, which controls vision,"" Dr Bajaj said.This confirmed that the bullet was migratory or ""wandering"" inside the brain, a phenomenon considered extremely rare worldwide, especially in such a young child.At admission, the child was drowsy and had weakness on the right side of the body, known as right-sided hemiparesis. As the bullet continued to shift position and neurological condition worsened, doctors decided to perform urgent surgery.Dr Bajaj along with Dr Anoop K Singh, Dr Ankan Basu and Dr Shraddha, under the guidance of Prof B K Ojha, head of neurosurgery, conducted the operation.One of the main challenges was the constantly changing position of the bullet. To overcome this, doctors used intraoperative fluoroscopy, which provides live X-ray imaging during surgery. ""This helped us locate the bullet in real time and remove it safely without damaging surrounding brain tissue,"" said Dr Bajaj.Anesthesia team led by Dr Monica Kohli and Dr Neelkamal ensured the child remained stable during the high-risk procedure.Post-surgery, the child showed clear improvement. ""The child is now more alert and can hold objects with the previously weak hand, indicating recovery of brain function,"" Dr Bajaj said.Prof Sonia Nityanand, vice-chancellor of KGMU, congratulated the medical team for successfully managing the rare case and praised their expertise and teamwork.The child's parents, who come from a poor family, thanked the doctors for the ""miracle that brought their girl back to them"".","Three-year-old Lakshmi was playing on her rooftop in Lucknow's Indiranagar when a stray bullet hit her on the evening of Dec 16.

NEW DELHI: A desperate phone call, a husband allegedly announcing a killing in real time and a brother forced to listen helplessly to his sister’s screams marked the chilling final moments of a 27-year-old Delhi Police SWAT commando who later died after being brutally assaulted at her west Delhi home.Kajal Chaudhary, posted with the Special Cell of Delhi Police and four months pregnant, was attacked at her rented residence in Mohan Garden on January 22.After battling for life for five days, she succumbed to her injuries at a Ghaziabad hospital on the morning of January 27.The family has accused Kajal’s husband, Ankur, a clerk with the Ministry of Defence posted in Delhi Cantt, and his relatives of prolonged torture and persistent dowry harassment, even during her pregnancy.Her father, Rakesh, alleged that the harassment began soon after the wedding. “We gave them a Bullet bike, gold jewellery and cash at the wedding, but they said our son would have got a car (had he married someone else). Later, my daughter even arranged a car, but they didn't stop harassing her. We couldn't even speak freely to her,” he said.Her mother said the family had spent around Rs 20 lakh on the marriage and had taken loans to meet the demands.“He (Ankur) had also taken Rs 5 lakh from her. She (Kajal) suffered a lot. I want justice. He is a monster,” she said.The horror of the assault unfolded over a phone call that Kajal’s brother, Nikhil, a constable posted at Parliament Street police station, was forced to witness.“He told me to put the call on recording, said it could be used as police evidence; (then) told me he was killing her. And then, I heard her screams,” Nikhil recalled, his voice trembling.According to Nikhil, the sequence began with a call from Ankur. “He called me and said, ‘Apni behen ko samjha le’ (Make your sister understand). I asked him to calm down and immediately called my sister,” he said.“She normally wouldn’t tell us much about what was happening, but that day she was sharing her ordeal. While we were speaking, he got angry that she was telling me things and snatched the phone from her,” Nikhil said.“Then he said to me, ‘Is call ko recording pe rakh, police evidence me kaam aayega. Main maar raha hoon teri behen ko. Police mera kuch nahi kar payegi’ (Put this call on recording, it will be useful as police evidence. I am killing your sister. Police won’t be able to do anything). Then I heard her screams. The call ended abruptly,” he said.Barely five minutes later, Nikhil’s phone rang again. “He (Ankur) said, ‘Ye mar gayi hai. Hospital aajao’ (She is dead. Come to the hospital). We rushed there with police personnel. He and his family were already present. When I saw my sister… not even an enemy kills someone like this,” he said.","Kajal Chaudhary, posted with the Special Cell of Delhi Police and four months pregnant, was attacked at her rented residence in Mohan Garden on January 22.

“COME RUB IT”: Devin Booker and Kendall Jenner openly flirting on Instagram and the internet is losing it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/come-rub-it-devin-booker-and-kendall-jenner-openly-flirting-on-instagram-and-the-internet-is-losing-it/articleshow/127785645.cms,"Image via X

Kendall Jenner and Devin Booker’s flirty IG exchange is peak chaotic energy











They first sparked romance rumors in 2020 and officially confirmed it on Valentine’s Day 2021.







The pair dated for about two years before splitting in June 2022, then briefly getting back together before splitting again later that year.







Sources reported they quietly ended things in November 2022 due to busy careers but stayed friendly.







Since then, sightings together and rumors of reconnecting have popped up more than once including reports they were “slowly navigating a restart” in early 2024 and spotted at public events together.







Stop scrolling. The internet moment of the week just went down in the comments section. NBA star Devin Booker slid into Kendall Jenner ’s latest post with a bold comment that’s got Twitter, losing it. “COME RUB IT.” And honestly? The context makes it even juicier.It all started when Kendall shared a promo clip for her Super Bowl 2026 Fanatics ad, a campaign where she playfully bet on the Patriots over the Seahawks and leaned into a running internet joke about a so‑called “Kardashian curse.”Devin Booker, her ex‑boyfriend and Phoenix Suns star, jumped into the comments with a tease:“I bet a million the Seahawks get that ring before you do @kendalljenner 🤗.”Kendall clapped back with:“🙄 how’s the ankle?” a reference to Booker’s recent sprained ankle.Then came the line no one saw coming, Devin responded with:“COME RUB IT.” 💀😭and now, absolute chaos.Here’s where this gets even more fascinating, Kendall and Devin’s relationship isn’t new tea, it’s years of shared moments, breakups, reunions, and internet speculation.So when Devin drops a flirty line like “COME RUB IT,” it isn’t just some random comment, it’s loaded with history, speculation, and a ton of fan energy.Of course the comment chain didn’t stay private for long. Fans immediately started shipping them again. Some are reading it as playful flirtation, others think it’s the first spark of a rekindled romance.And since Kendall’s ad literally pokes fun at her own dating history with athletes, this comment thread feels almost scripted for maximum chaos.","Kendall Jenner and Devin Booker’s flirty IG exchange is peak chaotic energy.

World’s oldest wooden tools found in Greece push early human technology history back,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/worlds-oldest-wooden-tools-found-in-greece-push-early-human-technology-history-back/articleshow/127776733.cms,"This undated image provided by Katerina Harvati shows a 430,000 year old wooden tool from Greece that was possibly used for digging.

Greece yields 430,000-year-old wooden tools ever used by humans

The wooden pieces show signs of careful handling

Wood complicates the usual picture of early tools

Humans and carnivores shared the same space

The significance lies in what survives, not what is claimed





Archaeologists working in southern Greece have identified wooden tools that appear to be the oldest of their kind ever found. The objects were recovered at the Marathousa 1 site in the Megalopolis Basin and dated to around 430,000 years ago. The findings were published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. For decades, early technology has been judged almost entirely by stone. Wood rarely survives long enough to be seen. These pieces do. Found alongside animal remains and simple stone artefacts, they suggest that early humans were shaping and using organic materials in ways that are usually invisible to archaeology. The discovery does not rewrite everything. It adds weight, quietly, to ideas that have long been difficult to prove.According to the study “Evidence for the earliest hominin use of wooden handheld tools found at Marathousa 1 (Greece)” , Marathousa 1 sits near what was once a lake edge. The ground stayed wet for long periods, slowing decay. That matters more than it sounds. In most sites of this age, wood disappears completely. Here, fragments remained long enough to be studied. Excavations have already shown repeated human presence, with stone flakes, worked bone, and butchered elephant remains.The wooden pieces were found within this spread of activity, not set apart from it.Two of the wooden finds show clear modification. One is an alder trunk, shaped along its length, with surface wear that suggests repeated use. Its size and form point towards digging or levering in soft ground. The second piece is far smaller, made from willow or poplar. It appears deliberately shaped, though its exact function is harder to pin down. Its scale alone stands out. Tools this small are rarely seen from such an early period.Stone lasts. Wood does not. That imbalance has shaped how early human behaviour is described. The Marathousa finds hint at a broader toolkit than stone alone suggests. Different types of wood were selected, which implies some awareness of material properties. That choice does not need to be framed as advanced thinking. It looks practical. Local. Grounded in what was nearby.A third wooden fragment showed deep markings that were not human-made. These were identified as claw marks from a large carnivore. Its presence alongside human-worked tools suggests overlap rather than separation. People and predators were moving through the same landscape, perhaps at different times, perhaps not. The evidence does not settle the question. It leaves it open.The tools do not point to sudden breakthroughs. They sit comfortably within a slow, uneven story of human adaptation. What matters is that they exist at all. Wooden tools were being made and used much earlier than the record usually allows us to see. Their survival here is unusual. Their use elsewhere was probably not. The ground at Marathousa held onto them. Long enough, it turns out, for a small adjustment to how early human life is understood.","Archaeologists working in southern Greece have identified wooden tools that appear to be the oldest of their kind ever found.

ISPL | Vicky Bhoir on bowling unity and fearless approach

MUMBAI: Sanat Sangwan has enjoyed a dream season in the Ranji Trophy and is currently the top run-getter, scoring 804 runs in seven matches at 73.09 with three centuries and three half-centuries. However, the 25-year-old would have been most satisfied with the ton he scored on Thursday, in his maiden first-class outing against Mumbai.Undeterred by wickets falling around him, the opener, playing in just his second season, slammed a gallant 118 (218b; 11x4, 2x6) on the opening day of their Ranji Trophy Group D tie here. However, his knock was overshadowed by Mumbai’s seasoned pacer Mohit Avasthi, who moved the ball around beautifully in helpful conditions and took 5/62 in 16.4 overs to bowl out Delhi for just 221 in 76.4 overs. At stumps, Mumbai were 13/1.They are already through to the knockouts while Delhi are out of the race for a KO berth.Mumbai players forced to wear masks due to pollution In the last few years, the Mumbai Cricket Association’s ground in Bandra-Kurla Complex has been the favoured venue for cricketers for home Ranji matches.However, pollution, plenty of dust and constant noise due to an under-construction building is now emerging as major irritants at this venue. On Thursday, three of Mumbai’s players — Sarfaraz Khan, his younger brother Musheer and off-spinning allrounder Himanshu Singh — were all forced to wear masks for around 30 minutes due to the pollution. BKC’s AQI was at 156, mentioned as ‘unhealthy’.",Mohit Avasthi takes his sixth five-wicket haul in first-class cricket.

Niagara Falls frozen in -20 degrees: How a record polar vortex turned the mighty waterfall into a surreal ice wonderland,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/niagara-falls-frozen-in-20-degrees-how-a-record-polar-vortex-turned-the-mighty-waterfall-into-a-surreal-ice-wonderland/articleshow/127643549.cms,"Source: X

How the polar vortex affected Niagara Falls



Partial freezing of the Niagara River



Niagara Falls: A natural wonder in winter and of cultural significance







A strong polar vortex moved across North America not long ago. Temperatures around Niagara Falls plunged below −20°C, far colder than usual. The mist from the waterfalls met the freezing air, and suddenly, ice began to coat everything. Cliffs, riverbanks, trees, rocks, and even sections of the Niagara River were layered with thick, glistening frozen sheets. Water still flowed, but the mist froze quickly in midair. Videos from locals show strange formations, icy spray patterns, rainbows catching the light, and a quiet, otherworldly feeling over the whole scene. The falls didn’t stop, but the world around them seemed paused.The vortex pushed Arctic air down. Mist from the falls, normally liquid for a short time even in winter, froze almost instantly. Ice built slowly on rocks and railings. The river itself started to harden in slow-moving areas along the shore. Water flowing and water frozen, side by side. Some patterns look like glass, reflecting the low sun. It is hard to tell if it is moving or still, and sometimes the edges glint with fleeting colours in the icy mist.The mist and spray from the waterfalls consist of small water droplets suspended in the air. In normal winter conditions, some of the water droplets in the mist and spray may freeze slowly on the rocks and other surfaces nearby.But when the temperature is below −20°C, the freezing process is very rapid. The water droplets in the mist and spray freeze instantly as soon as they come into contact with the cold surfaces. A frozen “shell” forms slowly around the edges of the waterfalls and the surrounding landscape. Pictures and videos show the beautiful ice formations, frozen sheets of spray, and ice sculptures formed as a result of the constant freezing process.Large sheets of ice formed where the river moves more slowly. Faster sections stayed liquid, giving a strange, uneven contrast. The river and the falls together seemed alive but muted, restrained. Ice thickened where it could, leaving gaps for flowing water. The interplay of frozen and moving water is not regular, not neat. It feels chaotic and quiet at the same time, like nature rehearsing, pausing, then moving on again.Niagara Falls, sitting on the US-Canada border, consists of Horseshoe Falls, American Falls, and Bridal Veil Falls. Millions of litres of water pour over the cliffs every second, sending up mist that usually hovers and drifts. In winter, that mist hardens. The falls are not silent, not still, but the icy surroundings transform the place into something uncanny. Visitors each year see a different face: green summers with boats, winters with frozen cliffs. Weather extremes like this vortex remind us that even the strongest, most familiar landscapes can change dramatically, showing a quieter, frozen side of a place that never truly sleeps.","Temperatures around Niagara Falls plunged below −20°C, far colder than usual.

Netizens react over empty theatres





Despite US President Donald Trump’s claims that the new documentary about his wife was “selling out fast”, opening night data from the film’s Boston screenings showed nearly empty theatres.There was also an apparent effort to buy an audience for the First Lady’s documentary, “Melania”, which chronicled her private life leading up to the 2025 inauguration.As early ticket sales appeared sluggish nationwide, a Craigslist advertisement found by producer Nate Gilbert offering free tickets plus $50 to anyone willing to sit through the film in Boston went viral, Axios reported.“Attend MELANIA documentary at any Boston area theatre during opening weekend (this upcoming weekend),” the Craigslist ad reads. “Free tickets + $50 per seat occupied.”“Must remain in seats for entirety of film.”The discovery of the ad followed reports that Melania was not selling tickets on its own merits.“Not a single ticket sold for the opening night of Melania at Boston’s largest theater,” Gilbert reported with screenshot evidence.Others checked their own local theatres and often found similar results, with either no or just a few seats sold.The results appeared to align with CNN polling analyst Harry Enten’s predictions that Melania would net between $1 million and $5 million. This was described as a substantial loss for Amazon, which paid $40 m for the rights to the film.Gilbert’s findings launched a trend on X as people looked up available theatre seats in their area. Retired Navy officer Travis Akers reported similar findings at a popular theatre in the Jacksonville area.The film was also reported to be performing poorly internationally. Journalist Jack Quann found 13 seats sold across two Dublin theatres.Tweet reading “As Melania Trump’s documentary #Melania is pulled from South Africa, and reports of slow uptake in the UK, I took a look at Irish ticket sales so far.

Choosing a New Bishop | Yes, Prime Minister | BBC Comedy Greats





In Yes Minister, when Jim Hacker finds out that Italian terrorists have access to British-made weapons, Sir Humphrey Appleby tries to mollify him by pointing out it’s not their department’s problem. British weapons in the hands of foreign terrorists were outside the Ministry of Administrative Affairs’ jurisdiction. Probably a Defence Ministry problem, or a Foreign Office problem, the unflappable bureaucrat points out, before a beleaguered Hacker hits back: “I am talking about good and evil.” This leads Sir Humphrey to point out that made it a “Church of England” problem.That quip, while hilarious, stands the test of time, because knowing the difference between good and evil is a heavy cross to bear for an institution created by a megalomaniac king who wanted a divorce.Now, the Church is in the news for getting its female Archbishop of Canterbury for the first time in its nearly 500-year-old history. In classic ecumenical tradition, her predecessor had to resign over an abuse scandal involving hundreds of boys. But why does England have a separate Church?It begins, inevitably, with Henry VIII, who married Catherine but couldn’t produce a male heir. The Pope refused to annul the marriage because Catherine was the aunt of Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor whose armies effectively controlled Rome — a man at whose snook the Pope could ill afford to cock.So, Henry decided it was time to do a Thanos and take matters into his own hands.The English Reformation followed. In 1534 Parliament passed the Act of Supremacy, one of the first instances of a government nationalising a foreign institution, which in this case was Roman Catholicism.From that moment on, the CoE was in the thick of things. Under James I and Charles I, it saw a fight between the clergy who wanted to go back to the Puritan basics and the royalists who wanted the pageantry and theatrics. Their fight was one of the inspirations for the High Sparrow arc in Game of Thrones, just like the Red Wedding was inspired by the Battle of the Roses.The Puritans won briefly.During the English Civil War, Oliver Cromwell put a break on the monarchy, named himself Lord Protector and banned all things fun, which instantly made the British nostalgic for the monarchy. During Cromwell’s time, the episcopal Church was effectively outlawed, and when Cromwell’s nepo kid failed to hold on to power, the church and crown returned with a vengeance.But the moment that really earned the Church its liturgical stripes was two books: the Book of Common Prayer and the King James Version of the Bible.In 1549, Archbishop Thomas Cranmer produced the first edition of the Book of Common Prayer. Before this, English worship followed Roman Catholic rites in Latin. Cranmer translated them into English and standardised them across the kingdom.This was the moment England became liturgically independent, taking Catholic structure and making it British, the theological equivalent of chicken tikka masala: foreign in origin but completely British.The Book of Common Prayer combined Protestant theology with Catholic ceremony to give a book whose phrases are still spoken across the world by English speakers, who might not be believers:The most famous is obviously peace in our time, which was uttered by Neville Chamberlain after the ill-fated Munich Agreement.Then came the King James Bible, which in time would become the most published book in the world, competing with the Little Red Book, Harry Potter and Don Quixote.Those two books gave England a way to worship independently of Rome while preserving much of the Catholic structure in English form.The CoE retained many of the traditions.Bishops still stood in a lineage traced back to the apostles. Baptism and Eucharist remained central. Vestments, altars, kneeling, and liturgical seasons stayed. The Mass was not reinterpreted. Cranmer rejected transubstantiation (bread and wine becoming blood and body) but preserved Communion as a sacred ritual. The choreography remained Catholic. The theology shifted Protestant. And some things were still hushed up.This hybrid identity became the Anglican formula: Catholic structure plus Protestant doctrine.Bishops, creeds, and hierarchy stayed. Papal supremacy and indulgences were swept under the rug.In the 18th and 19th centuries, the Church didn’t stand still. A religious revival led by preachers like John Wesley pushed the idea that faith should be personal and emotional, not just ceremonial. This movement energised ordinary believers and eventually gave rise to Methodism. A few decades later, another group inside the Church went in the opposite direction. The Oxford Movement argued that Anglicanism should reclaim its older Catholic-style rituals, emphasising tradition, ceremony, and sacred continuity.At the same time, the Church remained tightly bound to the British state. Bishops sat in Parliament, monarchs ruled as heads of the Church, and political leaders were expected to belong to it. Religion was not just private belief. It was built into the machinery of government.The 20th century dismantled that certainty. Conservatives accused secularism of creeping in. The British Empire slowly faded and the Church adapted. In 1994, women were ordained priests. By 2015, women bishops were approved. The LGBT+ movement remains a question, though. Priests are not allowed to solemnise same-sex marriages, but same-sex couples can receive prayers of blessing. Abuse scandals continued to expose institutional failures.Into this turbulence steps Sarah Mullally, the first woman to hold the office in nearly 1,400 years. Her background as a nurse and administrator suggests a leader shaped as much by systems management as theology.The appointment also highlights England’s constitutional theatre. The archbishop is formally appointed by King Charles III, relayed through Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has no theological role whatsoever. An atheist head of government advising a Christian monarch on a church appointment is the perfect embodiment of British satire.Reactions, as usual, were split. Many in Britain celebrated the progressive milestone. Conservative Anglican leaders around the world condemned it. The Vatican – which still doesn’t ordain female priests – put out a bland statement. The kind you give when you see your colleague get promoted.For Sarah Mullally, symbolism is the easy part. Governance is harder. She inherits a church facing three blunt pressures: decline, division, and credibility. Attendance continues to fall in an increasingly secular Britain, leaving the Church culturally visible but spiritually fragile. Internally, evangelical conservatives, Anglo-Catholic traditionalists, and liberal reformers coexist in permanent tension over gender, sexuality, and doctrine. Externally, safeguarding scandals have eroded moral authority and public trust.Perhaps the situation was best summed up by a septuagenarian Canterbury tour guide on her predecessors and his expectations: “Some of them have been very good, some of them have been pretty bad. Some of them have been very contentious, and some of them ended up murdered. I hope it doesn't happen to this one.” As British a sentiment as one can get.Of course, Henry VIII – based on what we know about him – would have been horrified knowing that a woman was now in charge of the Church he had created. Sir Humphrey would probably nod and say that he had always backed having a woman in charge. Or at least, an inter-departmental committee backed the general idea. Hacker would probably wonder if it could get him re-elected.All things considered, it’s hard not to smirk at the bathetic irony: an institution born because a man wanted to divorce his wife is now being led by a woman who will head one of the most influential Christian denominations in the world.","The Church is in the news for getting its female Archbishop of Canterbury for the first time in its nearly 500-year-old history.

Rwandan Archbishop Laurent Mbanda , chairman of GAFCON’s primates council, echoed this divide by asserting that Mullally’s support for same-sex marriage blessings, a position held by some provinces and her gender make it problematic for her to serve as a symbolic “first among equals” for Anglicans worldwide.

In Nigeria and other conservative provinces, some Anglican leaders have said the Church’s constitutional practice, which traditionally did not allow women to serve as bishops, is being compromised and that the Communion’s unity is at risk. Public discussions in social platforms show that some conservative congregants interpret the appointment as part of a broader ideological shift that undermines historic doctrine.

Bells rang as she took on the role of spiritual leader once held only by men and her pledge to champion unity and pastoral care resonated with many observers.However, while her appointment represents a historic advance in gender equality within global Christianity, it also exposed deep fractures within the worldwide Anglican Communion, from liberal provinces that celebrated the milestone to conservative branches that raised profound theological objections.In many parts of the Anglican world, Mullally’s appointment was welcomed as a long-overdue step toward equality and inclusion. Clergy and lay leaders from more progressive provinces applauded the Church of England for breaking the “stained-glass ceiling” and demonstrating that women can occupy the highest offices of spiritual leadership.Supporters point out that the Church of England first ordained female priests in 1994 and consecrated its first female bishop in 2015, a gradual arc of inclusion now culminating in Mullally’s leadership.Many advocates see her role as evidence that long-standing gender norms in church leadership are being reexamined and transformed.Even within traditionally conservative contexts, there were voices of hopeful affirmation. For example, Bishop Emily Onyango of Kenya argued that the appointment signaled a new dawn for the Church and called for peace and reconciliation across the Communion.Yet the reactions have not been universally positive:The Anglican Communion with roughly 100 million members globally has long struggled with internal theological disputes, especially on the status of women and LGBTQ+ inclusion. Mullally’s installation has brought these debates to the fore once again.Some observers say the appointment’s reaction illustrates how geographically and culturally diverse the Communion has become. In Western and Northern provinces, there is substantial support for expanding gender roles and ecclesiastical authority to women. In many African and Asian provinces, however, traditional interpretations of Scripture and ecclesial leadership still dominate.While the Archbishop of Canterbury is not a formal hierarchical head of the Communion, the global body has no central authority akin to the Pope in Catholicism, the role is widely regarded as a symbolic spiritual leader. That symbolic function is precisely what critics argue is now jeopardised by such a polarising appointment.Despite the disagreements, there are influential Anglican voices urging a path forward grounded in mutual respect and listening:As Dame Sarah Mullally prepares for her formal enthronement at Canterbury Cathedral in March 2026, the global Anglican Communion remains deeply engaged in its internal discourse over leadership, doctrine and identity. Her leadership will test whether the Anglican Communion, a body inherently broad and diverse, can embrace plurality without splintering further or whether her appointment will accelerate conversations about new structures for global Anglican unity.What is clear from the varied reactions, from jubilant progressives to worried conservatives, is that this historic moment has redefined conversations about faith, authority, and tradition across continents, cultures and congregations alike. The varied global response to Mullally’s appointment goes beyond church politics. It reflects wider societal discussions about gender equality in leadership roles, the interpretation of religious tradition in the modern age and how global institutions balance diversity with unity.As one member put it online, the appointment is “history in the making”, not just for the Church of England but for a global community wrestling with change.","Conservative Anglican groups have expressed strong objections to Mullally’s leadership, not only because she is a woman but also because of broader concerns over theological direction and biblical interpretation. Some conservative congregants interpret the appointment as part of a broader ideological shift that undermines historic doctrine. In Nigeria and other conservative provinces, some Anglican leaders have said the Church's constitutional practice, which traditionally did not allow women to serve as bishops, is being compromised.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127775115,imgsize-51608,width-400,resizemode-4/church-of-england-shatters-tradition-first-female-archbishop-sparks-global-anglican-divide.jpg"

Stonehenge mystery solved? Study reveals how 25-tonne stones reached the site in southern England,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/stonehenge-mystery-solved-study-reveals-how-25-tonne-stones-reached-the-site-in-southern-england/articleshow/127561744.cms,"Researchers uncovered the truth behind Stonehenge’s 25 tonne stones

Salisbury Plain shows no sign of ancient ice

Sarsens were local but still demanding

Bluestones point clearly to human effort

What the science changes and what it does not





Stonehenge, located on open chalk terrain in southern England, is identifiable but curiously unexplained. For decades, one practical question has hung over the site without being resolved. How did stones weighing hundreds of tonnes arrive here before wheels, metal tools, and written plans? A recent study done by geologists at Curtin University solidifies that disagreement. The researchers looked at small mineral grains in nearby river sediments to check if glaciers had transported the stones south during the Ice Age. The results indicate away from the ice and towards the people. The area surrounding Salisbury Plain has no chemical signs of glacial transit. Instead, sediments reflect local recycling. This lends weight to the hypothesis that Neolithic communities deliberately moved the stones over long distances on their own.The research “Detrital zircon–apatite fingerprinting challenges glacial transport of Stonehenge’s megaliths” focuses on detrital minerals, mainly zircon and apatite, found in streams that drain Salisbury Plain. These grains act as long-lived markers of where sediment has travelled. If glaciers had crossed the area, they would likely have left behind mineral signatures from Wales or northern Britain.That signal is absent. The zircon ages instead match rocks already known from southern England, suggesting the material has been recycled locally rather than dumped by ice. This matters because glacial transport has often been used as a convenient explanation. If ice sheets had carried the stones close to Stonehenge, human effort could be seen as minimal. The new data makes that position harder to hold.The study also reinforces a growing consensus among geomorphologists. There is little physical evidence that glaciers ever reached Salisbury Plain during the Pleistocene. No clear moraines, no consistent erratic trails, no buried till layers. While ice did extend far into Britain during earlier cold periods, its southern limits remain well north of the monument.Fine sediments can travel far beyond glaciers through meltwater. Large stones usually do not. The absence of glacial fingerprints in the surrounding sediment makes it unlikely that multi-tonne blocks arrived by chance.Not all of Stonehenge came from far away. The largest stones, the sarsens, were sourced from West Woods, about 25 kilometres to the north. That distance may sound modest, but the stones weigh around 25 tonnes each. Moving them would still have required planning, labour and time. The mineral analysis does not focus on sarsens directly, but it supports a broader pattern. Stonehenge was not constructed using random materials that happened to be located nearby. Its materials were selected and brought in with intent.The smaller bluestones tell a sharper story. Their geological fingerprints match outcrops in the Preseli Hills of west Wales, around 230 kilometres away. Some stones may have travelled by sea for part of that journey, others overland. Either way, the distances involved rule out casual movement. One stone stands out even more. The Altar Stone appears to come from the Orcadian Basin in northeast Scotland. If correct, that implies a journey of more than 700 kilometres. No known ice route explains this. Human organisation does.The study does not describe exactly how the stones were moved. Sledges, rollers and boats remain plausible tools. What it does change is the balance of probability. Stonehenge looks less like a monument finished by chance and more like one completed through sustained effort. There is no single moment where the mystery disappears. Instead, the space for easy answers narrows. The stones arrived because people brought them. That idea now sits more comfortably with the evidence, even if the work behind it remains only partly visible.","Researchers looked at small mineral grains in nearby river sediments to check if glaciers had transported the stones south during the Ice Age.

Dubai Police are taking community engagement to a new level by inviting UAE residents to capture the action at the upcoming UAE SWAT Challenge and win cash prizes. The move aims to blend high-adrenaline tactical competition with digital creativity and public participation. The announcement has quickly become one of the most talked-about local developments, especially among students, content creators and social media users across the Emirates.As a part of a new initiative called the SWAT Clip Award, Dubai Police will offer up to Dh30,000 (about $10,000) for the best short video made by residents during the event, which runs from February 7 to 11 at the Al Ruwayyah training grounds.The UAE SWAT Challenge is a high-profile international tactical competition organised by the Dubai Police General Command. Now in its seventh edition, this event attracts elite special tactical teams from around the world to compete across demanding scenarios, from assault and obstacle courses to officer rescue and tower challenges, testing teamwork, strategy and endurance.This year’s event has already drawn 114 teams from 48 countries, making it the largest edition yet and reflecting Dubai’s growing role as a global hub for police excellence and security cooperation.Unlike typical spectator events, the SWAT Clip Award is designed specifically to bring the community inside the action. Participants, especially students, are encouraged to submit 30- to 60-second creative videos showing anything from teamwork and tactical skills to cultural diversity and human values displayed during the challenge.Under the SWAT Clip Award -Additional cash rewards of up to Dh30,000 in total are on offer for the most compelling and well-crafted entries, making it a rare opportunity for residents to earn money while capturing a world-class event. Entrants must follow guidelines such as shooting in portrait mode (vertical), adhering to safety instructions at the venue and ensuring that content reflects the spirit of teamwork, discipline and fair competition. Drones are not allowed unless officially authorised.Officials say the competition is part of a broader strategy to foster closer ties between the police and the UAE community, especially young people who are active on platforms like Instagram, TikTok and YouTube. Brigadier Ali Al Mansouri, Director of the General Department of Community Happiness at Dubai Police, emphasized the SWAT Clip initiative’s goal of showcasing the professionalism of participating teams as well as “the human values that define the competition. ”By inviting residents to document the event, Dubai Police are tapping into a vibrant culture of mobile content creation, where authentic, resident-generated videos can boost awareness, pride and engagement far beyond traditional media coverage. This also enables the public to see elite policing in action and celebrate the discipline, courage and coordination that define special units.The UAE SWAT Challenge has a strong track record of global involvement. In 2025, it broke Guinness World Records for the number of participating nations and teams, underlining its reputation as one of the world’s most ambitious tactical competitions. The event combines practical tactical tests such as obstacle courses, hostage rescue simulations and tower challenges with opportunities for expert exchange between international police forces.Dubai Police also places a premium on professional benchmarking, with teams earning points across daily challenges leading to an overall champion trophy. By adding a public-facing video contest, organisers are broadening the appeal of the event beyond law enforcement circles to include students, creators, families and digital audiences. The initiative reflects how major sporting and tactical events can be amplified through community participation and social media storytelling.The response on social platforms has been enthusiastic, particularly among university students and young creators who see the SWAT Clip Award as a chance to combine creativity with real-world excitement. Many residents have already shared tips on filming mobile footage at large events, while social media groups are buzzing with suggestions on the best ways to capture striking angles, teamwork highlights and candid moments between competition heats.The reward has motivated some to plan storyboards, scout locations at the venue and prepare editing styles that underscore discipline, spirit and tactical precision. Overall, the challenge and its accompanying video contest are already shaping up to be a highlight of the UAE’s February event calendar, drawing not just elite police teams but also a growing network of creative residents and digital storytellers.The SWAT Clip Award demonstrates how law enforcement events can evolve into community-driven cultural moments, blending professional competition with creative expression. With cash prizes, international participation and high visibility, this initiative could set a precedent for how security agencies worldwide engage with the public in an increasingly interconnected digital landscape.As Dubai Police gear up for the event from February 7 to 11, residents and visitors alike are preparing to capture the action, tell their stories and potentially walk away with Dh30,000 in pocket, turning tactical excellence into public celebration and digital creativity.","Dubai Police offer residents up to Dh30,000 for best video at UAE SWAT Challenge.

World’s oldest man João Marinho Neto at 113 reveals the simple secret behind his remarkable longevity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/worlds-oldest-man-joo-marinho-neto-at-113-reveals-the-simple-secret-behind-his-remarkable-longevity/articleshow/127778594.cms,"World’s oldest man at 113 teaches lessons in simple living, connection, and longevity



Longevity secrets of Neto: Family, love, and companionship







João Marinho Neto, a man from Brazil, has done something very few ever manage. He just turned 113. Yes, 113. That makes him officially the world’s oldest living man. Born back in 1912, Neto has seen more than a century of change, progress, and astonishing human achievements. He’s lived through wars, inventions, social revolutions, and decades of human history. And he’s still here. Still smiling. Still surrounded by family, friends, and a community that admires him. People keep asking how he’s managed it. Experts say genetics matters. But Neto reportedly credits something simpler: love, family, daily routines, and a life filled with small joys. His story feels like a reminder. Life might be long, sure, but maybe it’s the people around you that really matter most.Neto’s 113th birthday wasn’t quiet. Not for him. His children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and even great-great-grandchildren gathered around. Pictures shared by Guinness World Records show him beaming, holding a cake. The room reportedly buzzed with laughter. It seems celebrations like this aren’t just about cake. They’re about connection. About feeling you matter. Neto himself has said that being around good people has kept him happy and healthy.It’s simple advice. But maybe simple is what works.As a child, Neto grew up on his family farm in Maranguape, Brazil. He helped with cattle, picked fruit, and learned the value of hard work early on. Experts say being active from a young age can help with a longer life. But Neto’s story isn’t just about exercise. It’s also about staying connected to the land, living close to nature, and learning discipline. His daily routines and simple habits seem to have played a big part in his long life. The farm shaped him not just his body, but the way he lived.When asked about his secret, Neto doesn’t mention diets or exercise. Just people. “Being surrounded by good people,” he reportedly said. His family clearly plays a huge role. Seven children, 22 grandchildren, 15 great-grandchildren, three great-great-grandchildren. It’s a big circle. A close-knit one. Experts suggest emotional support and strong relationships can improve both mental and physical health. Neto’s life seems to confirm that. Love, care, and companionship might just be as important as any medicine or superfood.At 113, Neto is now a historical figure. The 26th-oldest man ever recorded. Yet he stays humble. He enjoys small moments. A chat with family, a cup of coffee, birthday wishes. Interestingly, he isn’t the oldest person alive. That title belongs to Ethel Caterham, a 116-year-old Briton. Neto reportedly sent her a birthday message saying, “Ethel Feliz Aniversário.” Even at this age, he shows a spark of humour. Human connection, again. It appears this is what keeps him going.","João Marinho Neto, a man from Brazil, has done something very few ever manage. He just turned 113.

What do these giant dinosaur footprints reveal about prehistoric life

Why this dinosaur footprint discovery is so important





Researchers have found some of the biggest dinosaur footprints ever. They are so huge that an adult could curl up inside one without a problem. It’s wild to imagine, honestly. This kind of find really turns our old ideas about prehistoric life on its head.This ancient print was uncovered along the Dampier Peninsula in Western Australia and is given the title of “ Largest dinosaur footprint ” by Guinness World Records. They are embedded in fossil-rich sandstone that dates to the Early Cretaceous, which was roughly 130 million years ago.The site stands out because the prints aren’t just massive; they’re deep and come in all kinds of shapes, showing off the variety of dinosaurs that wandered through this part of northwest Australia. It’s more than just proof of some truly gigantic creatures. These tracks give us a real peek into the world of Gondwana, the ancient southern supercontinent that once included Australia.A sauropod footprint that’s about 1.7 meters long, so just over 5 and a half feet, was found in this site. That’s the largest dinosaur footprint anyone’s ever found. Researchers from the University of Queensland and James Cook University matched these giant tracks to sauropods, those long-necked, plant-munching giants that once roamed the Earth.A vertebrate palaeontologist at the University of Queensland put it simply: some tracks here are so huge, most people could actually fit inside one. The dinosaurs that left them probably stood about 5.3 to 5.5 meters tall at the hip. Even for dinosaurs, that’s seriously massive.These footprints sit in what people now like to call Australia’s own Jurassic Park. Along the coast where the Broome Sandstone stretches out, scientists have found over 150 tracks from at least 21 different kinds of dinosaurs. We’re talking big meat-eaters like theropods, two-legged plant-eaters called ornithopods, armoured dinosaurs known as thyreophorans, and quite a few sauropods too.This makes the site one of the most varied dinosaur tracksites you’ll find anywhere, and it gives Australia some of its best proof of dinosaur life from the Early Cretaceous.The Broome Sandstone itself is seriously ancient. It started as river delta mud and sand, then, ages later, it showed up along today’s shoreline. What’s really cool is that a lot of these tracks sit out in the intertidal zone. They only appear when the tide’s out, so the timing has to be just right. It’s this odd bit of geology that’s turned the place into a goldmine for palaeontologists.For the first time in Australia, researchers have found confirmed stegosaur footprints. Evidence that these dinosaurs once roamed here, even though nobody had spotted them in the fossil record before.These tracks back up earlier discoveries highlighted by National Geographic , which pointed out how massive the Kimberley prints are and how much they reveal about dinosaur life in ancient times. And it’s not just about size. These trackways tell us how these giants moved, how they lived, and how they fit into their world. Footprints like these freeze a brief moment from the distant past, letting scientists study actual dinosaur behaviour, not just their bones.It’s wild to think about, but it really drives home just how huge and lively the ancient world was. These fossil tracks aren’t just old marks in the ground; they’re snapshots of colossal sauropods, bustling herds, and prehistoric landscapes frozen in stone. If you find yourself on the coast of Western Australia when the tide goes out, you’re literally walking over one of the greatest dinosaur stories we’ve ever uncovered.","Researchers have found some of the biggest dinosaur footprints ever.

Qatar is set to experience unsettled weather at the start of the week, as strong northwesterly winds sweep across the country, raising dust levels, reducing visibility, and bringing a sharper drop in temperatures, the Qatar Meteorological Department has warned.According to the department, fresh to strong northwesterly winds are expected to affect most parts of Qatar on Sunday, January 25, and Monday, January 26. The winds, advancing from the northern Arabian Peninsula, are likely to create dusty conditions in several areas, which may at times lead to reduced horizontal visibility, particularly during periods of stronger gusts.The Qatar Meteorological Department also forecast a further fall in temperatures during this period, warning that residents may feel an increased sense of coldness, especially during the early morning and evening hours.Authorities have urged the public to remain cautious, particularly motorists who may be affected by poor visibility due to dust. Those heading outdoors are advised to take the changing weather conditions into account.Marine warnings will remain in effect around Qatar on both days, as strong winds are expected to impact sea conditions, making maritime activities more challenging during this period.","Strong winds will sweep Qatar on Sunday and Monday, bringing dust, low visibility, cooler temperatures.

The Happisburgh 800,000-year-old footprints mark the earliest human presence in northern Europe

Soft estuarine mud helped preserve the ancient footprints

Digital recording captured the footprints before they vanished

Foot size estimates suggest a mixed age group

The footprints align with evidence of Homo antecessor

Happisburgh sediments preserve a wider record of early life

The footprints offer a brief but direct human trace





A brief period of low tide along a tranquil coastline in eastern England revealed an uncommon sight in Europe. A series of human footprints emerged on a Norfolk beach, momentarily exposed by shifting sands and pressed into ancient mud. The impressions were fleeting and fragile, yet they were sufficiently distinct to be captured prior to the sea's return. The impressions were subsequently verified by archaeologists to be approximately 800,000 years old, making them the oldest human footprints ever discovered outside of Africa. The site, located in close proximity to the village of Happisburgh, provides direct evidence that early humans resided in a much northern region than had been previously believed. The discovery provides physical detail to a profound period of human history that is typically only known through scattered stone implements and bone fragments.The footprints were uncovered on the foreshore at Happisburgh on the Norfolk coast, an area already known for its early prehistoric remains. Researchers estimate the prints were made between one million and 780,000 years ago, during the Early Pleistocene.At that time, Britain was connected to mainland Europe by a land bridge, and the climate, while cooler than southern regions, could still support human groups.According to the research article “Hominin Footprints from Early Pleistocene Deposits at Happisburgh, UK” , the impressions include prints from adults and children, suggesting a small group rather than a single individual. Their size and shape fall within the range expected for early human species living in Europe at the time.Footprints rarely survive in the archaeological record. At Happisburgh, a specific set of conditions made preservation possible. The prints were formed in soft but stable estuarine mud, likely along the edge of a slow-moving river. Soon after being made, the surface was covered by layers of fine sediment, sealing the impressions before erosion could destroy them.Over hundreds of thousands of years, coastal processes buried and later re-exposed the surface. Modern coastal erosion finally brought the prints back into view, though only briefly.The footprints were visible for only a short time before waves and wind erased them. Archaeologists worked quickly, using multi-image photogrammetry to create detailed three-dimensional digital models. These models remain the only permanent record of the footprints.Through this method, researchers could identify heel marks, arches, and in one case, toe impressions. The orientation of the prints suggests the group was walking south across a muddy flat near the water’s edge.By measuring the length of the footprints, researchers estimated the individuals ranged from about one metre to nearly one point seven metres in height. This points to a group that included both children and adults.Such evidence is rare for this period. Early human fossils from Europe are extremely scarce, especially in Britain. The footprints provide information about body size, movement, and group behaviour that bones alone often cannot.No human fossils from this time period have been found in the UK. However, the footprints match the size range of Homo antecessor, a species identified from fossil remains in Atapuerca, Spain. Homo antecessor is currently the only known human species in western Europe from a similar age.While the species cannot be confirmed without skeletal remains, the footprints are consistent with what is known from southern Europe.The footprint surface sits within the Hill House Formation, a sequence of estuarine sands and silts laid down during a warm interglacial phase. These sediments have also yielded stone tools, animal remains, and plant evidence, building a picture of a landscape that early humans could inhabit.Together, these finds show that early humans were capable of surviving in northern environments far earlier than once assumed.Unlike tools or bones, footprints capture a moment rather than an object. At Happisburgh, that moment lasted only long enough to be recorded. The sea has since reclaimed the surface.What remains is a quiet record of people moving across a muddy shore, long before Britain was an island and long before history left written traces.","The 800,000-year-old footprints mark the earliest human presence in northern Europe.

You don’t need 15 funds; 4–6 well-chosen ones are enough for most investors.

Step 1: Start with one boringly good core fund

if you get your first fund right, you’re already 60–70 per cent of the way to a good portfolio.

Step 2: When to add a second core fund

but the second fund should be another pillar, not a clone.

Your SIP size has grown meaningfully.

Your total equity corpus is getting substantial.

You want to spread the manager or style risk a bit.

slightly different style

different structure

Step 3: Adding a satellite – but only after the core is steady

or a small-cap fund (for more aggressive investors),

or a specific strategy that you understand clearly.

the satellite must remain smaller than the core.

Step 4: The debt or hybrid layer – where real-life risk is managed

a short-duration or corporate bond fund for near-term goals

an equity savings fund,

or even a simple combination of equity and a high-quality debt fund.

The big enemy: duplication and overlap

Four flexi-cap funds topped the ranking in a given year.

Three aggressive hybrid funds, all run with similar mandates.

extra confusion about which SIP to stop or increase,

and zero real diversification.

Where do you have 3–4 funds doing the job of one?

Which funds are redundant because their role is already being played by a better one?

Is your equity–debt mix totally out of sync with your goals?

So what does a sensible 4–6 fund portfolio look like?

One or two core equity funds that together hold most of your equity money.

One or two satellite equity funds (or none) for a mild tilt.

One or two debt or hybrid funds to steady the ride and match shorter-term goals.

Four to six funds.

In one case, you know exactly what each fund is doing and why it exists.

In the other, you are basically hoping that if you throw enough paint on the wall, some of it will become “diversified.”

How to use this in your own portfolio

Identify your two strongest core equity funds.

Check whether you really need more core equity funds, or whether you can phase some out gradually.

See if your satellite funds are genuinely small and purposeful, or secretly running the show.

Look at your overall equity–debt split and compare it with your goals and time frames.

You need 4–6 calm, reliable team members who show up year after year.

The most common portfolio problem I see these days is not “too little choice”. It’s a fridge stuffed with leftovers.Open a typical investor’s portfolio, and you’ll see it: 14 equity funds, 3 hybrids, 2 ELSS, 1 random international fund bought after a YouTube video, and an NFO whose name nobody remembers. Half the SIPs are for ₹1,000. No one knows why each fund is there.Then they ask: “Is my portfolio diversified?”My honest answer: “Yes, it’s diversified. But mostly in confusion.”In this column, I want to walk you through the opposite way of doing things: starting with one good fund and growing a portfolio slowly, deliberately, like building a house brick by brick. This is also how we build model portfolios inside Value Research Fund Advisor (VRFA). We don’t begin with “how many funds can we add?” We start with “What is the minimum we can get away with?”Every solid portfolio begins with onethat can quietly do the heavy lifting for years.For most people, this is a broad, well-diversified fund: a good flexi-cap, a large-cap, or a simple index fund tracking a broad market. It should be the kind of fund that does not need much “watching”, does not chase fads, and owns a wide basket of companies.Say, an investor starts with a single flexi-cap fund, with a SIP of ₹10,000 per month. Over the next five years, this one fund alone grows to over ₹ 9 lakh.So, the idea is simple:Inside VRFA, this is exactly where we start when someone comes in with no investments or with a messy portfolio. We first identify or suggest a strong core fund that matches their goal and risk level. Only after this is in place do we even think of adding anything else.Very quickly, investors get itchy. As soon as the first fund does okay, the mind whispers: “Ab ek aur le lete hain.” That’s fine—There are good reasons to add a second core fund:What is not a good reason is: “This fund is on a ‘Top 10 Funds’ list this month, so let me add it.”A second core fund should either bring a(e.g., one fund is more large-cap oriented and the other has some mid-cap exposure) or a(e.g., pairing a flexi-cap with a large-and-mid-cap fund).If both your funds are flexi-cap funds from similar AMCs and hold the same top 20 stocks, then you don’t have two funds. You haveAt VRFA, when we see this kind of overlap, our system literally shows you the combined underlying holdings. Quite often, investors are shocked to see that their “five different funds” actually ownin slightly different proportions. That is not diversification. That is administrative clutter.Only after the core is in place—typically two good equity funds—should you think of adding a “satellite” fund.A satellite fund is like a side dish. It can make the meal more interesting, but you can’t live on it alone. In practice, this usually means:You add a satellite to tilt your portfolio, not to turn it upside down.Starting with two core equity funds that together form about 70-80 per cent of the total equity allocation, the investor adds one mid-cap fund with just 20-30 per cent allocation. Over 10-15 years, the core provides stability, while the mid-cap adds an extra kicker to long-term returns.The message is:If your mid- and small-cap funds become 60–70 per cent of your equity money, you are not “enhancing returns”; you are simply increasing the chances of losing sleep.Inside VRFA model portfolios, you’ll see this very clearly: for most investors, the core funds make up the bulk of the allocation. Satellites are small, carefully chosen, and sometimes absent altogether—especially for conservative or first-time equity investors.There is one more building block most investors ignore because it is not glamorous:If you are investing for goals 3-5 years away, or if you want to control how wild your ride is, part of your portfolio should be in safer assets.This can be:Think of this as the shock absorber of your portfolio. It doesn’t look exciting in good times, but it stops your long-term plan from collapsing when the market throws a tantrum.For a goal that is four years away, instead of putting 100 per cent in equity, an investor could use an equity savings fund, which typically keeps about 30 per cent in equity and the rest in debt and arbitrage. In March 2020, when the market fell 23 per cent, such a portfolio would likely have fallen far less, closer to 10 per cent.This is the difference between staying invested and panicking out.At VRFA, every recommendation starts with asset allocation by goal: how much should go into equity, how much into debt, and how that should change as the goal gets closer. Only after this is decided do we select specific funds to fill those buckets.Now we come back to the biggest disease in Indian portfolios:If you dig into the holdings, you’ll often find the same leading banks, IT companies, consumer stocks repeating everywhere.Instead of “five sources of return”, you’ve created:Inside VRFA, one of the first things we encourage subscribers to do is a “portfolio cleanup” using our model portfolios as a reference. You can literally open the recommended portfolio for your risk level and compare it with your own:Very often, the best “new investment” is not a new fund, butLet me put all this together. For a typical long-term investor, a clean, effective portfolio might look like this:That’s it.Not because you are lazy, but because you are disciplined.Compare that with the 15-fund portfolio:At VRFA, every model portfolio is built with this core–satellite thinking. We start by asking: “If this investor never touched their portfolio for the next 10–15 years and only kept investing regularly, would this mix give them a high chance of success?” Then we work backwards.If you’re reading this and your portfolio already looks like a museum of every fund ever launched, here is what I suggest:First, don’t panic. Cleaning a portfolio is not an emergency surgery. It’s more like decluttering a house.Second, line up your funds on a sheet of paper (or on a portfolio tracker):If you’re a VRFA subscriber, this process becomes much easier. You can match your portfolio to a model portfolio tailored to your risk profile and goals. You’ll often find that you don’t need more funds; you need fewer, better-chosen properly-sized funds.And if you’re not a subscriber yet, you can still borrow the idea: think in terms of roles, not “number of funds”. Every fund in your portfolio should be able to answer a simple question:“If I remove you, what important job will stop getting done?”If the honest answer is “nothing much”, then you’ve just found clutter.A solid portfolio is not built in one weekend. It grows from one good core fund into a small, well-organised team of funds, each doing its job. You don’t need 15 people shouting at once.That, in the long run, beats the noisiest “Top 10 Funds” list every single time.",You don’t need 15 funds; 4–6 well-chosen ones are enough for most investors. Every solid portfolio begins with one core equity fund that can quietly do the heavy lifting for years.
