Neeraj Chopra, World Champion & Olympic Champion | 'The Road Less Taken Part 2: Highs And Lows'

Road Less Taken Part 3: Higher. Faster. Stronger

PARIS: Neeraj Chopra wiped the sweat off his face and got up to leave. It had been a long day. Midnight was just round the corner. His press conference duties were over. He was spent physically and mentally.""The TV duties are still there Neeraj, for the Indian media,"" came the reminder. He could have said 'no' and walked away.He did not. He was willing to tell his Paris story one more time. Tricolour draped around his shoulders, he walked wearily towards the L entrance gate. The cameras were being set up there. He was there till 2.45 am, talking about things he has never spoken about before.One saw two faces of Neeraj Chopra here. One after the qualification race on Tuesday. He had aced it, topped it with a throw of 89.34m. He was relaxed, smiling when he came to the mixed zone. There was no hint of apprehension, anxiety or any discomfort. He did not reveal anything about the groin niggle that had started to bother him again, putting doubts in his mind.He said he had healed well and was excited to defend his title. There were no doubts anymore. He was in a comfort zone, secure. Well, he was surprised and annoyed by how things changed two days later at the Stade de France.After he fouled his first throw, he was still relaxed. Then came the bolt. He saw Nadeem Arshad 's javelin travelling in the air, like a dream. It kept going on and on. When it landed, Neeraj's body language changed. 92.97m! How was he going to catch up with that?""I have been in the 88-89m range for years now. But I know deep inside that I have 3-4m (more) in me. There is a big throw inside me,"" Neeraj said later.Neeraj tried to find that when his turn to throw came. Going back to the video footage one can see that he was tense after Nadeem's throw. He was backing himself to go for his biggest one ever. 2-3m more than ever.""I felt good on that second throw. I believe in my arm. Accha jhatka diya (it was a good throw). But at the back of my mind, I was worried about a foul. I always am these days. I was worried about my leg block due to my groin niggle,"" he revealed later.Neeraj managed 89.45m. It was good for a silver medal . So far. But his mind had been taken over by that Nadeem throw. He was tense, he was worried, and he was angry at himself. Neeraj and Nadeem have been throwing on the international circuit together since 2016. Nadeem had never beaten him before Thursday night. That rivalry was certainly playing on his mind.Neeraj kept changing his mark on the runway, try after try. It did not help. He failed to get another valid throw. After his fifth foul, he simply shrugged his shoulders and packed his bag.Silver it was, then. but for him it was simply not enough.""My congrats to Arshad. I've been competing with him since 2016 ( SAF Games , Guwahati). And this is the first time that he has won competing against me. Such is sport… we have to accept it, move on and resolve to work harder,"" Neeraj said.","Neeraj Chopra was beaten by Nadeem Arshad in the men's javelin final in Paris. The Indian threw 89.45m to win silver, his first defeat to the Pakistani. Chopra says he has 3-4m more in him and will work harder.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112417979,imgsize-43400,width-400,resizemode-4/112417979.jpg"

Aman

beats Cruz to clinch sixth medal for India

PARIS: Aman Sehrawat is just 21 but mature way beyond his age. He has been to hell and back.He lost both his parents when he was just 11 years old. His mother took her own life after battling mental illness for years. His father also died soon after. Aman battled depression and tried to take drugs to forget his pain.He was in a dark place. But his uncle Sudhir Sehrawat was a pillar of support. He backed his nephew to concentrate on his wrestling career , take his mind off negative thoughts. His grandfather Mangeram also motivated him.Inspired by Olympian Sushil Kumar 's exploits, Aman had joined Chhatrasal Stadium in Delhi two years before his father passed away. With his uncle holding his hand now, life changed. Aman found peace on the mat. He had a mission in life. He made steady progress, kept reaching new milestones and made newspaper headlines when he became the first Indian to win a gold medal at U-23 World Wrestling Championship .On Friday evening, at the Champs de Mars stadium, a makeshift arena right next to the Eiffel Tower, Aman took on Puerto Rico's Darian Cruz in the 57kg freestylebronze medal match, a weight category in which Ravi Dahiya had won silver for India in Tokyo.Aman dominated his seasoned 29-yearold rival, a three-time medallist at the Pan American Games. After an initial contest, he won comfortably at 13-5. The bronze medal was India's, the country's fifth medal at the Games here.In the first period, Cruz took the lead by grabbing Aman's left leg and pushing him out of the orange circle. 1-0. Aman tried hard to draw level and went up 2-1 soon as he pinned Cruz to the mat. Cruz returned the compliment to go 3-2 up.It was very close at this stage. But Aman started gaining confidence and started attacking more, lunging at Cruz's legs to get the crucial points. He managed to do that midway through the period, to get two points for a 4-3 lead. The Puerto Rican seemed to be tiring now and just before the hooter, Aman got a good grip, Cruz went down to avoid a takedown and Aman was 6-3 ahead.In the second period, Cruz came back determined and got two points. Aman was just a point ahead at 6-5 now. It could have gone either way, but Aman was not giving up. He took two points to go 8-5 ahead. There were just two minutes left for the final hooter. He was looking in control.At this point, Cruz opted for a break, pointing to his left knee. He was trying to catch his breath against the young Indian. After the medical assistance, Cruz was back on the mat, looking a bit tired. Aman saw that and went in for the kill. His strategy was simple. He attacked his rival by grabbing his leg, forcing him to go down and then got on top for two points.With a minute and 7 seconds to go, it was 10-5. With just 45 seconds left, it became 12-5. There was no way Cruz was coming back. Aman secured another point to emerge an easy winner and ran to his coach to celebrate his medal.Hailing from village Birohar in Haryana's Jhajjar district, Aman had a keen interest in mud wrestling as a kid. The move to the mat changed his life.The 21-year-old, the lone Indian in the men's section, had a good outing on Thursday here, posting two big wins to race through the pre-quarters and quarterfinals of the 57kg freestyle.In the quarterfinals, Sehrawat was up against Albania's Zelimkhan Abakarov. The verdict was 12-0 in the Indian's favour as he rattled up the points over the two periods. He had lost to Akabarov at the senior World Championships.Aman lost to his Japanese opponent in the semifinals but returned on Friday to fight for bronze. He was hungry, he was determined. He was the better wrestler.This medal would give some solace to India's wrestling contingent which was in a shock after Vinesh's disqualification. It came as a much-needed balm.","Aman Sehrawat is the first Indian to win a gold medal at U-23 World Wrestling Championship.

Despite seeking assistance, the support from his national federation was not forthcoming, placing Nadeem in a precarious position.Upon learning of Nadeem's dilemma, Chopra took an active step to aid his friend and competitor. Recognizing the importance of proper equipment for an athlete of Nadeem's calibre, Chopra publicly advocated for support to address the Pakistani athlete's equipment needs.""Arshad is a top javelin thrower, and I believe that the javelin makers will be more than happy to sponsor him and provide what he needs. This is a piece of advice from my side,"" Chopra said.Chopra's appeal was met with a positive response, enabling Nadeem to secure the necessary support and equipment. This intervention was pivotal for Nadeem, who went on to clinch Pakistan's first-ever individual Olympic gold medal in Paris with an impressive throw of 92.97 meters. Chopra, on the other hand, secured the silver medal, adding another medal to his illustrious career tally.Despite being fierce competitors on the field, they showcased the power of friendship and support that transcends borders.

He claimed silver in 2012, following in his footsteps, Yogeshwar Dutt (2012), Sakshi Malik (2016), Ravi Dahiya, and Bajrang Punia (2021) have successfully maintained this proud tradition.Aman's outstanding performance not only earned him a well-deserved medal but also contributed to India's overall medal count, bringing the nation one step closer to matching its impressive haul from the Tokyo Games, where Indian athletes secured a total of seven medals.Antim Panghal (53kg), Anshu Malik (57kg), and Nisha Dahiya (68kg) were unable to reach the medal rounds in their respective categories. Meanwhile, Vinesh Phogat (50kg) lost her chance at gold after being disqualified from the final for being overweight.Her disqualification sparked widespread outrage in the country, leading to a challenge in the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).

India, despite having more medals than Pakistan in the Paris Games, was placed 64th, with one silver and four bronze. This ranking disparity is solely attributed to the ranking system employed by the International Olympic Committee .The standard method for assessing countries' success at the Olympic Games is based on the number of gold medals won. A nation with a single gold medal would rank higher than one with 10 silver or bronze medals. The count of silver and bronze medals only becomes relevant when there is a tie between two nations in terms of gold medals won.In the men's javelin throw final, Arshad secured his country's first gold medal in four decades and set a new Olympic record with his remarkable throw. Prior to the Paris Games, where Arshad triumphed over India's javelin throw hero Neeraj Chopra, Pakistan had never won an individual Olympic gold medal.

But I knew the lines and lengths he was likely to bowl,"" Pollard said.""I just backed myself - if he bowled short, I was going across; if he went full, I was going to hit straight. He bowled three fuller balls, and they were right in my arc. At that point, I couldn't hold back, I had to go for maximums. But Rashid is a world-class bowler; we've played a lot against each other,"" he added.Pollard's performance not only secured a crucial victory for Southern Brave but also underscored his reputation as one of the most formidable hitters in the sport.","Kieron Pollard hit five consecutive sixes during The Hundred on Saturday.

Arshad Ayub and Venkatapathy Raju were bowling. They were very good and me and Sachin had a long partnership,"" news agency PTI quoted Vengsarkar as saying.Vengsarkar added that Tendulkar’s performance on the turning track hinted at his potential for a successful career in cricket.“He was going so well on a turning track. I thought he was going to go places and that is what happened,” he said.Vengsarkar, the former chairman of selectors, also dug out a nugget from that famous Ranji Trophy final between Mumbai and Haryana in 1991.“There was this match in 1991 against Haryana — the Ranji Trophy final — and the way he batted…we were chasing 355 and we were 22 for three wickets (34/3).“The way he played in that innings was absolutely brilliant. We could have won the game had he stayed there a couple of overs more,” said Vengsarkar, who made a valiant 139 while Tendulkar scored 96.In one of the most memorable Ranji Trophy finals, the domestic giants Mumbai lost the final by a mere two runs against Kapil Dev-led Haryana.Vengsarkar also remembered that former India skipper Sourav Ganguly, who made his ODI debut in January 1992, was initially picked as a ‘fourth seamer' during the tour of Australia.“On that tour he was selected as the fourth seamer and he was asked to go to the nets. After two deliveries, he said ‘I am not a bowler and I want to bat'.“Ganguly was told that he was picked as the fourth seamer. But he did not get opportunities on that tour. After a few years, he was picked for the tour of England,” he said.Vengsarkar also praised former India skipper and T20 World Cup-winning coach Rahul Dravid for the gradual improvement he made as a player.“Every batsman must improvise. You cannot bat in the first gear all the time. You have to bat in the second, third and the fourth gear. As the years passed by, Rahul improved tremendously and was one of the best batsmen in the world,” Vengsarkar said.The Mumbaikar also recalled VVS Laxman's 281 against Australia in Kolkata in 2001 was ‘important' as it changed India's mentality.“It was very important because India won against Australia.

We won the first Test match in South Africa in Centurion, and then we were playing in the second and third Test match. We have never won a series in South Africa, as you know. It was a really big opportunity for us to win that series. Some of our senior players were not there.""Dravid shared that several senior players, including Rohit Sharma , missed the series. Despite this, India managed to compete closely with the Proteas in both matches. However, South Africa ultimately limited India to low scores when it mattered most and comfortably chased down their targets.""Rohit Sharma was injured, and we didn't have some senior players in that series. But we were very close, and in both the Test matches--the second and the third test matches--in the third innings, we had a big opportunity. We could have set a decent score and won the game, but South Africa played well. They chased back in the fourth innings. So I would say that that was probably my lowest point in my coaching career--not being able to win that series in spite of being ahead,"" he added.Dravid had an impressive tenure as the coach of Team India , capping it off with an ICC T20 World Cup victory after a thrilling win over South Africa in June this year in Barbados.Prior to this, India finished as runners-up in the 50-over World Cup on home soil last year, after an impressive 10-match winning streak that ended with a loss to Australia. The team also secured the runner-up spot in the ICC World Test Championship, again to Australia, and claimed the 50-over Asia Cup title last year.","Rahul Dravid says defeat against South Africa in 2021-22 season was lowest point of his coaching career with the Men in Blue. South Africa staged a remarkable comeback in the following two Tests, clinching both matches by seven wickets.
