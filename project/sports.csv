Champions Trophy

SKY or Hardik? Suspense continues

MUMBAI: With India likely to express its inability to tour Pakistan for the Champions Trophy in February next year citing no government clearance for the tour, there could be interesting things in store at the International Cricket Council's (ICC) series of meetings from July 19-22 in Colombo.TOI has learnt that BCCI secretary Jay Shah is travelling to Colombo on Thursday for the meetings, which will conclude with the Annual General Meeting on July 22.While the agenda (TOI has a copy) of the AGM doesn't mention any discussion on the issue, the vexed matter is likely to be taken up by the boards of both India and Pakistan (set to be represented by Pakistan Cricket Board chief Mohsin Naqvi) in the 'any other business' category.The Champions Trophy will be held from February 19 to March 9. As per the PCB's proposed schedule, India are supposed to play all their three league matches in Lahore (February 20 vs Bangladesh, February 23 vs New Zealand & March 1 vs Pakistan). The semifinals will be held in Karachi (March 5) and Rawalpindi (March 6) while the final will be held in Lahore on March 9.However, if India refuse to go to Pakistan for the tournament, the ICC could be forced to mull the possibility of a hybrid model for the tournament, with India playing their matches in UAE or Sri Lanka. However, the PCB too is likely to come out with a strong response in that case.The BCCI secretary may also attend the India vs Pakistan Women's Asia Cup match in Dambulla on Friday.Meanwhile, the suspense over who would be India's next T20 captain-Hardik Pandya or Suryakumar Yadav-continued for another day, with the Indian team now likely to be picked on Thursday.It's learnt that in an online meeting on Tuesday, new head coach Gautam Gambhir and the selectors discussed a few things about Indian cricket, including the need to give Surya, the world's second ranked T20 batsman, the regular T20 captaincy - as TOI had reported on Wednesday - as Hardik was prone to breakdowns.However, no final decision was taken on the matter.","India likely to express its inability to tour Pakistan for the Champions Trophy in February next year citing no government clearance for the tour.

'Everyone's different…': What Sourav Ganguly learnt from Virender Sehwag about leadership with NatWest series victory,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/everyones-different-what-sourav-ganguly-learnt-from-virender-sehwag-about-leadership-with-natwest-series-victory/articleshow/111822170.cms,"NEW DELHI: It was on July 13, 2002 when Sourav Ganguly and his young team won the NatWest Trophy final against England, chasing down a steep target of 326 with three balls to spare at the famed Lord's cricket ground .Chasing 325, Virender Sehwag smashed a 49-ball 45, while Ganguly hit a 43-ball 60 in an opening stand of 106 in 14.3 overs.Now a video is doing the rounds on the internet, where Ganguly is addressing a small gathering at Lord's telling what he learned about leadership from his opening partner Virender Sehwag that day and how he became a better captain after the NatWest series win.Ganguly says, ""I'll tell you a story here, for me that was a very important part of leadership and I spoke to you about man management. It was Sehwag batting with me in the middle. We were chasing that night - 320 where I took my shirt off and I was very upset at lunch because England got 300-325 and in those days, this was about 2002, you very rarely chased 325, it was not like modern day cricket where you just keep hitting. The game has changed a lot.""Ganguly continues, ""So I walking down this long room at Lord's and Sehwag was whistling behind me , he is that sort of a person, I turned back, abused him and said 'ek toh 325 bana dete ho and you think it's a joke'. He walks past me and said. 'skip we're going to win this'. I said 'let's see'. So we went, we started very well, both of us. After 7 overs, we were about 70 for no loss. I was batting on 40 odd and Sehwag was also batting. SoRonnie Irani was bowling and I went up to Viru and said we've got a good start, I think we can get this total but don't get out. We've played the harder bowlers, there's a weaker bowler coming in, let's just keep taking 6-7 runs an over because that's what we need. He said 'yeah, yeah fine no problem.' So Ronnie runs up from this end, he hits the first ball over mid-off for four. So I was at the non-striker's end I went up to him, tapped and said 'good shot, so we've got 4 runs in the over, just keep rotating (the strike). He said 'yes yes no problem'. So he goes back to his end, the next ball Ronnie pitches it up, he hits it over the top over mid-on, one bounce four. So I again go up to him and said well played, well played, good shot, we've got 8, you can still take singles. He said 'yes, no problem, singles'. The next ball, Ronnie Irani pitches it up, he sits down and sweeps, right from the middle stump, it could have hit his pad, he was gone, it went for four, I did not go up to him. He did not even look at me because he understood. So he turned his face, took guard and batted again. The next ball he again hit him over covers for a four. So on five balls he hit five boundaries. And on the sixth ball he took a single and as he walking past me he said 'I've taken a single'. And this is happening in the middle, we got 22 runs that over, he smashed him, he was so good. I was furious at the other end because he did not listen to me.""Ganguly adds, ""I had two options, either I walk up in the middle and give him my piece of mind. So I took a couple of minutes, pulled myself back and I want up to him and said keep concentrating. I didn't tell him anything from thereon, he played an absolute blinder of a knock and we won. We finished the game, we won, and as I sat in this dressing room upstairs, he was sitting slightly far away from me, I kept thinking to myself, I said you know today you won this game because this gentleman at the other end just took the opposition bowler on. And what were you thinking of telling him? That be conservative, take a single, go to the next over, but he was one person who felt that he could hit him for 20 in that over and turned the game around. And I say this to all of you here because sometimes as a leader, when you work with different people, you have your own way of doing things. You have your own way of being successful and go and tell him, 'hey this is the way I think it's right, let's do it and we'll win that way. But there's this other person who's more talented, who's more gifted, who looks at things differently and probably has a better solution than you. And it was Sehwag that day who had a better solution than me. And it taught me a lot. We did win the game and it made me a better captain. And a couple of days later, I met him at breakfast and I said you know why did you do this? The first question he asked me 'Are you angry on me?' I said 'I was, I'm not anymore'. He said 'good'. I said I told you to take singles why did you hit him? He said 'I felt that was the best thing to do at that particular moment. That was the best thing I felt would win India the game at that particular moment.' And it was such a lesson for me on captaincy. I said I have a Sehwag who's different, I have a Dravid who's different, I have a Ganguly who's different and I have a Harbhajan Singh who's different. They can't play the same way. So if I have to be successful, I have to understand that they win cricket matches their way and I have to let them do that.""Ganguly continues, ""And I think a successful group, successful entrepreneur alongwith your aims and goals and objectives of wanting to be successful, don't forget this very simple line and solution in your journey is that everyone's different and you cannot make everyone play the same way or everyone work the same way. As long as he delivers for you, as a leader you need to have that capability of adjustment in you. And I say that when you manage individuals, you have to manage them differently. You cannot expect every individual to behave, react, work and do things the same way. That is very important in leadership.""Mohammad Kaif played a brilliant knock of 87 not out, he was well supported by Yuvraj Singh who scored 69 and both helped India script one of the most memorable wins in the history of the game.India were struggling at 146/5 when both Yuvraj and Kaif got together at the crease.The duo put on a partnership of 121 runs to give India a glimmer of hope in the match.Yuvraj was dismissed for 69 runs, but Kaif batted well, with tailenders, to give India a win in the final over by two wickets and with three balls to spare.Following the win, Ganguly had waived his T-shirt at the Lord's balcony - an image which is still fresh in the minds of all the cricket lovers in India.","Sourav Ganguly tells what he learned about leadership from his opening partner Virender Sehwag. Ganguly and his young team won the NatWest Trophy final against England, chasing down a steep target of 326 with three balls to spare at Lord's cricket ground.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111822160,imgsize-73518,width-400,resizemode-4/111822160.jpg"

As Rohit gears up for future cricketing commitments, this time in the US is likely to have provided him with fresh energy and cherished memories, reflecting his love for travel and new experiences.Rohit's achievements in T20Is are unmatched, as he is the only player to have scored five centuries in this format. His journey in T20Is started with the first-ever T20 World Cup in 2007, where he played a vital role in India's maiden title triumph. As a captain, he has also led India to their second T20 World Cup title, solidifying his position as one of the greatest players in the format's history.Gautam Gambhir , who is set to take over as the new head coach of the Indian team in the upcoming limited-overs Sri Lanka tour, has recently expressed his wish for all players, including the experienced trio of Virat Kohli, Jasprit Bumrah, and Rohit, to be available for selection.Following Gambhir's statement, there are reports suggesting that Rohit may make himself available for the upcoming three-match ODI series against Sri Lanka, which is scheduled to take place in August.Considering the limited number of ODI matches that India will play before the ICC Champions Trophy in 2025, Rohit may opt to participate in the ODI series against Sri Lanka to ensure that he remains in top form and contributes to the team's success in the 50-over format.Rohit, who led India to their second T20 World Cup triumph, was also part of MS Dhoni's team that won the inaugural edition of the tournament in 2007.","Rohit Sharma is enjoying a well-deserved break in the United States.

Are Gautam Gambhir and Jay Shah divided over India's T20I captaincy? Squad announcement likely today,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/are-gautam-gambhir-and-jay-shah-divided-over-indias-t20i-captaincy-squad-announcement-likely-today/articleshow/111823173.cms,"LIVE UPDATES:

The decision around who will be India's next T20I captain is the hottest topic on cricket's discussion boards across platforms and possibly the reason behind the delay in announcement of the white-ball squads for the tour of Sri Lanka beginning July 27.As per various reports, the BCCI was scheduled to announce the squads on Wednesday but because there was no consensus yet on whether Hardik Pandya or Suryakumar Yadav will led the team in T20Is, the announcement was delayed for another day and will reportedly happen on Thursday.Rohit Sharma announced his retirement from T20Is after India won the T20 World Cup under his captaincy last month. That left the BCCI to decide whether to bring Hardik back as skipper in the shortest format or let Surykumar Yadav, who replaced Hardik after his injury last year, to continue to lead the team in T20Is.Hardik was in rehab after injuring his ankle in the middle of the ODI World Cup last year and returned to competitive cricket only in the IPL earlier this year. In between that, Surya led India in the team's 4-1 T20I series win against Australia.Moreover, new coach Gautam Gambhir is reportedly apprehensive about Hardik's fitness as the allrounder has suffered injuries (back, ankle) in the recent past.Several reports also suggested that Gambhir had a robust meeting with BCCI secretary Jay Shah over a video call from Delhi, where they discussed the approach for the road ahead but couldn't reach a decision over T20I captaincy , with Gambhir in favour of Surya and Shah backing Hardik.Seniors like Rohit, Virat Kohli, Jasprit Bumrah are likely to be rested for the tour. However, a Cricbuzz report on Wednesday suggested that Rohit might make himself available for the three-match ODI series.The Sri Lanka tour will be Gambhir's first assignment as head coach after he replaced Rahul Dravid in the position at the conclusion of the T20 World Cup.The tour kicks off on July 27 with the first game of the three-match T20I series.","The BCCI was scheduled to announce the squads on Wednesday but because there was no consensus yet on whether Hardik Pandya or Suryakumar Yadav will led the team in T20Is, the announcement was delayed for another day.

Is Suryakumar better?

(All stats courtesy: Rajesh Kumar)

NEW DELHI: With Team India planning their strategies after their T20 World Cup 2024 victory and skipper Rohit Sharma 's retirement from T20Is, the discussion on the next captain is heating up.The two prominent candidates are Hardik Pandya and Suryakumar Yadav . However, recent reports indicate that Suryakumar may be preferred over Pandya. As per multiple reports, this preference arises mainly due to Pandya's inconsistent fitness record, which raises concerns about his suitability for long-term leadership.Sources reveal that both Gautam Gambhir , newly-appointed head coach, and T20 World Cup-winning captain Rohit Sharma favour Suryakumar for the captaincy role.It is also understood that Gambhir and chief selector Ajit Agarkar have already communicated this decision to Pandya.According to reports, Suryakumar will not only lead Team India in the upcoming T20I series against Sri Lanka, starting July 27, but will also be the Indian captain till the T20 World Cup 2026.In terms of Pandya's Indian Premier League ( IPL ) career, he debuted for Mumbai Indians in 2015. Pandya played 106 matches for Mumbai, scoring 1692 runs at an average of 25.63 with a strike rate of 152.43, including four fifties. For Gujarat Titans, he played 31 matches, scoring 833 runs at an average of 37.86 with a strike rate of 133.49, including six fifties.As a bowler, Pandya took 64 wickets in 137 matches with an average of 33.59. His best bowling figure was 3/17. As a captain, Pandya led in 45 matches, winning 26 with a winning percentage of 57.77. His captaincy performance, although decent with an IPL title with Gujarat Titans, hasn't overshadowed his fitness issues.On the other hand, Suryakumar's T20I record is impressive. Debuting in 2021, he has played 68 matches, scoring 2340 runs at an average of 43.33 and a strike rate of 167.74, including four centuries.

While chasing provides a clear target and allows for calculated risk-taking, setting a target comes with the inherent uncertainty of not knowing what constitutes a par score.""My mindset is just to play according to the merit of the ball. Sometimes you bat first or you bat second. Definitely, when you bat second, you have that score in front of you, and you can calculate your risks, and you can go for it.

The All India Football Federation ( AIFF ) has started contacting coaches who had applied for the national team vacancy and will start the interview process, based on the feedback it receives.According to an email sent out by acting general secretary M Satyanarayan, the AIFF is looking at several applications and needs additional details “to make an informed decision, before moving to the next stage of the selection process.”The details that the AIFF has sought includes: “Are you still interested in the job? What is the minimum package you are expecting in terms of monthly salary and other benefits? How soon can you take up the assignment, if selected? Any other information or demands you may have.”According to sources, emails have been sent to a dozen-odd coaches from the 291 who had applied with at least two Indian Super League (ISL) winning coaches – Manolo Marquez and Antonio Lopez Habas – among those who have been lined up for an interview. Park Hang-seo, the man who took Vietnam from no-hopers in 2017 to the quarterfinals of the AFC Asian Cup where they eventually lost by a solitary goal against Japan, has also been contacted.“There is growing feeling within the federation that the next national team coach has to be someone with good knowledge about Indian football,” a source told TOI on Wednesday. “Manolo and Habas have spent considerable time in India and will have an advantage in the selection process. Their success rate in India is good. The federation is only wary about salaries, given that it may have to compensate (former national team coach) Igor Stimac for unilaterally terminating the contract.”No coach has managed more games (110) in the ISL than Habas and he remains the most successful coach in the ISL as well. The Spaniard has won two ISL titles (one each with Atletico de Kolkata and ATK) and one League Shield (with Mohun Bagan last season) during his time in India.Manolo, on the other hand, took Hyderabad from the bottom in 2020 when he took charge of the team, to the ISL trophy in 2022, and has produced a significant number of players for the national team which includes big guns like Akash Mishra, Nikhil Poojary, Ashish Rai, Mohamed Yasir, Liston Colaco, Hitesh Sharma and Jay Gupta.He has managed 90 matches in the ISL, and except for his debut (2020-21), has challenged for the coveted Shield in three of his four seasons in India. While on debut he missed qualification by a whisker with Hyderabad, he finished second on the league table twice and third last season with FC Goa.After sacking Stimac for his failure to guide India to the third round of the FIFA World Cup qualifiers, despite an encouraging start, AIFF called for applications from coaches with minimum 10-15 years of experience at the elite youth and senior level.The federation received a total of 291 applications.","The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has started contacting coaches who had applied for the national team vacancy.

Jesin and Hira Mondol combination kept the Customs defence busy, but they failed to open the goal mouth.Customs too had their chance when Robi Hansda's free-kick narrowly missed the target.After a barren half-half, coach Geroge was forced to bring in PV Vishnu and Sayan Mukherjee to add more teeth to attack. But the Customs defence continued to frustrate them. They even managed to create chances with some effective counter-attacks.""We did create chances, but failed to convert those. That hurt us badly today but it happens in a game,"" George said after the game.In the day's other matches, Bhawanipore beat Rainbow AC 2-0 and George Telegraph defeated Eastern Railway 2-1.","East Bengal held goalless by Calcutta Customs in CFL Premier Division match at Naihati on Wednesday.

Following the match, Southgate indicated that he would take time to consider his future as the national team's manager.""As a proud Englishman, it has been the honour of my life to play for England and to manage England.

UEFA Euro 2024: Spain bask in bench strength,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/uefa-euro-2024/uefa-euro-2024-spain-bask-in-bench-strength/articleshow/111771032.cms,"A bold and beautiful Spain sailed over every hurdle that came in their way over the last one month. While they were taking teams apart across different cities of Germany, they were also breaking a few age-old perceptions that have become part and parcel of Spanish football .Since the turn of the century, and more specifically following the Leo Messi-Cristiano Ronaldo era, the modern-day consumer of world football had come to believe that there's nothing more to Spanish football than El Clasico.The last time there was a club-country double in European competitions was way back in 1988 when PSV Eindhoven and The Netherlands won the two titles. Real Madrid and Spain have done an encore 36 years later, but it can be safely said that these two titles are completely independent of each other.Yes, Real's Dani Carvajal had the captain's armband on when Spain finally won it, and Barcelona 's Lamine Yamal was the talisman who kept delivering the goods time and time again, but this victory wasn't just about the two elite-team players. There was a bit of Barca influence with Dani Olmo and Marc Cucurella both being products of the Catalan giants' youth set-up La Masia, but they have played all their football in other clubs of Spain and abroad.Let's look at the two scorers of Sunday - Nico Williams and Mikel Oyarzabal. Not many are aware that they play in opposing clubs of one of the most fiercely contested derbies in Europe - the Basque derby . While Nico is still a part of Athletic Bilbao (he may not be one at the end of the summer transfer window), Oyarzabal plays for Real Sociedad, one of the most consistent Spanish clubs which played in the Champions League this year. Add to them goalkeeper Unai Simon and defender Le Normand - both from the Basque region - and we have a team which is significantly different from the 2012 Euro winning side, which had six Barcelona and four Real players in the starting XI. Meanwhile, the man of the tournament Rodri, who now plays for Manchester City, is a Villarreal product, a team that most Manchester United fans would remember from that Europa final marathon tie-break loss in 2021.It's not just about the personnel. The current lot's style and approach is significantly different from that of both Real and Barca. This Spanish team does revel in possession, but it is not meaningless possession of Luis Enrique's 2022 World Cup team, that seemed a pale shadow of the tiki-taka masters of the earlier decade.The Spanish coach Luis de la Fuente - himself a Basque who played most of his football for Bilbao - understood very early that he doesn't have the quality of Xavi Hernandez, Iniesta and Sergio Busquets in his line-up to play the old tiki-taka style. Rather, the players have the zest and speed of a technically gifted lot which is ready to press high when required and launch lightning fast counters when that's the call of the hour. There has also been a shift in style with the fast wingers on two ends of the pitch calling the shots instead of million passes in the middle of the park with the hope of one breakthrough ball.This pragmatism and fluidity of approach with a group of players who don't have the ego of superstars, but the work ethic of world beaters, helped de la Fuente create a team for all seasons.Come next World Cup, four magnificent Barcelona youngsters - Pedri, Gavi, Fermin Lopez and Pau Cubarsi - should be in the mix and the red of La Roja could be the brightest colour in world football for a while.","The last time there was a club-country double in European competitions was way back in 1988 when PSV Eindhoven and The Netherlands won the two titles.

LONDON: Carlos Alcaraz took ownership of Wimbledon 's Centre Court in signature style. The 21-year-old was leaping into the air and slamming forehands one minute and getting down on the grass and picking up a volley off his shoelaces the next.He was all over the court, covering ground, corner to corner, baseline to net and back again without really breaking a sweat.The Spaniard thumped down serves at 136 mph and came up with feather light dropshots. Like a real estate mogul marking territory, he knew every blade of grass on the rectangle. ""I've never seen him serve that way, 136. I've never seen him serve that fast,"" Novak Djokovic marvelled.Alcaraz, just the second man in the Open Era to win his first four Grand Slam finals, Roger Federer won his first seven, is in a race with the record books. ""I've seen and heard all the stats,"" he said. ""I try not to think about it too much. It's a really great start to my career, but I have to keep going.""Alcaraz has Djokovic's 24 Grand Slams, Rafael Nadal 22 and Roger Federer 20 in his sights. That's the goal post he's aiming for. ""At the end of my career, I want to sit at the same table as the big guys. That's my dream right now,"" the two-time Wimbledon champion said. ""It doesn't matter if I already won four Grand Slams at the age of 21. If I don't keep going, it doesn't matter. I will try to keep winning and end my career with a lot of Grand Slam titles.""The world No. 3, who turns to the golf course to relax, reiterated the importance of building. Brick by brick. ""I'm happy with the work I'm doing with my team, I'm proud of myself, all the things that I'm doing great. It has been unbelievable, an amazing journey so far,"" said Alcaraz, whose long-time coach Juan Carlos Ferrero has been the conductor of his career.""I don't know what my limit is. I don't want to think about it,"" he said. ""I just want to keep enjoying my moment, just to keep dreaming. So, let's see if at the end of my career it's going to be 25, 30, 15 or four (Slams). I don't know.""Alcaraz, who had 21 forehand winners, and just 10 unforced errors off that flank in the final against Djokovic, picked on his weapon when asked where he could improve. ""I have to keep improving everything, I guess. My forehand, at this level I think it can be better. Every year it should be better,"" he said. ""I think my game in general can improve. I have to keep growing and keep improving.""Alcaraz, whose play appeared to have lost its edge in the second half of last year, stumbling in big matches, falling to Daniil Medvedev in the semifinals of the US Open, said he needed to grow up.""I learnt a lot from that match against Daniil in the US Open in 2023,"" he said. ""I had to be more mature in those situations. I gave up a little bit. I remember perfectly. I gave up a little bit in the second set after losing the first one. It is unacceptable playing in a Grand Slam. I knew that these things can't happen again.""""I'm here right now thanks to these kinds of situations that I learned from,"" he added. Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner , who between them have the season's first three majors covered, have powered a change of guard. That's not to say Djokovic is done, only that the top of the game has a whole different vibe now.""Being over there with Jannik, 21 years old and 22 years old in the top of the ranking, winning Grand Slams, I think it is good for tennis to have new faces winning the big things and fighting for the big tournaments,"" he said.

Maharashtra government

to make amends & announce reward to boost shuttler's morale before Paris Games

MUMBAI: Badminton player Chirag Shetty 's comments regarding Maharashtra government ignoring his achievements while rewarding cricketers from the state for winning the T20 World Cup have stirred up a hornet's nest.Chirag along with Satwiksairaj Rankireddy - the No.3 ranked men's doubles team in the world - played a crucial role in India winning their maiden Thomas Cup in 2022. Chirag, though, wasn't recognised for his effort. After seeing the cricketers being feted, the aggrieved shuttler told TOI on Sunday that ""if the state government can honour World Cup-winning stars, they should also honour him and treat other sports equally"".Besides the Thomas Cup success, Chirag has also won doubles gold at Asian Games , Commonwealth Games and bronze at World Championships. The 27-year-old Malad resident has now found support from prominent sportspersons of the city, who urged the state government to resurrect the situation by rewarding Chirag. Uday Pawar , coach and mentor of Chirag, felt that his ward's achievement is on par with that of cricketers and he should have been rewarded for it.Former India hockey captain MM Somaya said that he had sympathy for Chirag as ""winning the Thomas Cup is a truly historic achievement"". He went on to add that the state government can make amends by announcing a reward for him just before the Paris Olympics begin which will be good ""for his morale as well"".Pawar, a former Asian Games medallist and a prominent badminton coach in the city, said: ""I am not comparing sports but like the cricketers who have brought honour to Maharashtra, so has Chirag. I feel his achievement is on par (with the cricketers). A person who has brought honour to the state shouldn't be demanding but the state should recognise his efforts on its own.""He added that players shouldn't ask for recognition and instead the state government should have a mechanism in place where once they have achieved something of national significance, they should be rewarded.""I think the state's sports ministry should be more active. They should do their own homework and should be aware of who the top players from Maharashtra are. If they don't know about his/her achievement, then the ministry is not functioning properly. They should have people who will keep in touch with the respective associations from state and take updates on how their players are performing,"" said Pawar.Somaya said: ""I would fully agree with Chirag and I would quite understand his position. Since he was the only player from Maharashtra, he deserves the recognition. Need not be such a huge amount that they have given to cricketers but in some manner, he should be rewarded. He is seeking recognition from the state government which I think is only natural and I think it will be fair even if the state govt does it now. He is one of the key players from Maharashtra to participate in the Olympics and has a good chance of winning a medal with Satwik.""He also urged the state government to have a ""consistent policy"" to reward the performers from other sports as well. ""They should reward the players as soon as they know that someone from the state has achieved something big. It should be a standard process. A person shouldn't be applying for it. You should make a person feel a sense of pride when a state government recognises a player on their own,"" felt Somaya.","Badminton player Chirag Shetty's comments regarding Maharashtra government ignoring his achievements have stirred up a hornet's nest.
