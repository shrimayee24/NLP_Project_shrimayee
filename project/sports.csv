“Take his ball skills and quickness”: ESPN's Mel Kiper Jr. believes Travis Hunter would best fit for the Giants,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/take-his-ball-skills-and-quickness-espns-mel-kiper-jr-believes-travis-hunter-would-best-fit-for-the-giants/articleshow/118606391.cms,"Image via Getty Images

Mel Kiper Jr. Wants the New York Giants to select Travis Hunter

The NFL Combine is now underway, with teams assessing potential prospects to shape their franchises. Heisman Trophy winner Travis Hunter is a top prospect in the draft, likely to be a top-three selection. Hunter's impressive career at Jackson State and Colorado has led the Big 12 in receptions, touchdowns, interceptions, tackles, and passes broken up.Travis Hunter, a Colorado cornerback and wide receiver, is gaining attention for his versatility in the NFL. ESPN's Mel Kiper Jr. projects him as the third overall pick, potentially joining the New York Giants, sparked by his exceptional skills.""Hunter is my top-ranked prospect in the class, and though I currently see him as a receiver in the pros, he could also play cornerback for New York,"" Kiper wrote. ""He can make a massive impact on either side of the ball, and he'll likely see at least some time on both sides.”""Perhaps the Giants take his ball skills and quickness and drop him at receiver opposite Malik Nabers to form a solid supporting cast around whomever is under center. Perhaps they look at his elite instincts and finally land a true CB1. Either way, this pick would be clutch for a struggling Giants team.”Travis Hunter's dual capabilities could be beneficial for the Giants, as NFL analyst Sam Monson suggests he could serve as the team's top cornerback and wide receiver, complementing current standout Malik Nabers.The concept of an NFL two-way player is rare, but Hunter's talents have generated discussion among league executives and coaches. Tennessee Titans coach Brian Callahan views it as ""very realistic,"" with the possibility of Hunter starting as a cornerback before gradually assuming offensive responsibilities.Nevertheless, there are questions regarding the physical cost and the challenge of learning both positions. In spite of these issues, Hunter's unusual combination of ability and adaptability makes him a commodity, with the potential to redefine conventional positional roles in the league.With the draft approaching, the Giants' strategy is again the subject of debate. Instability at quarterback and potential desire for veterans Matthew Stafford or Sam Darnold create space for a utility-type addition like Hunter, who could serve in various capacities.Also Read: “An exceptional talent”: Travis Hunter already winning over NFL coaches and executives as a viable two-way player In short, Travis Hunter’s rare two-way skill set makes him one of the most intriguing prospects in the upcoming NFL Draft .

Travis Kelce has three hard-and-fast rules in his relationship with Taylor Swift

Travis Kelce, the 35-year-old Kansas City Chiefs player, allegedly has three hard-and-fast rules in his relationship with Taylor Swift, also 35. The two, who started dating over the summer of 2023, are frequently spotted together and have both attained tremendous success in their careers—Swift as one of the world's largest music icons and Kelce as a vital member of the Chiefs. Even with their great push, the Chiefs failed to reach the Super Bowl following a 40-22 defeat to the Philadelphia Eagles on February 9.The Kansas City Chiefs superstar Travis Kelce has three hard and fast rules when it comes to his relationship with singer Taylor Swift. Dating since summer 2023, the two are regularly spotted together and are a hot topic for fans and the media. Swift is among the world's leading musicians, and Kelce is an integral part of the Chiefs, who came up short of the Super Bowl after a 40-22 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles on February 9.According to the Life and Style Magazine, through MSN, Taylor Swift apparently has some 'rules' about how Kelce can stay in contact with her and whom the football player can socialize with during his free time.“They’ll be doing lots of texting and calling, too, but Taylor likes to see Travis in real time,” a source said. “She likes to know where he is and who he’s with. It’s not that she doesn’t trust him; she just wants to feel connected. Taylor loves Travis’ energy and spontaneity, but she doesn’t want him wasted at the bar with pals. He can celebrate his wins in style with her and their friends.”Being a high-level athlete, Travis Kelce probably does not have much of his free time spent in bars, considering the strenuous nature of his profession. Otherwise, when he is not training or on the field, he co-hosts the extremely popular New Heights podcast with his brother Jason Kelce, a retired NFL great. The podcast has attracted an enormous following and gives fans an inside look at football and the brothers' personal lives.The third rule in the relationship of Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift is one that is most argued about. The couple has reportedly agreed to not be seen with others of the opposite gender to avoid gossip and speculation. This ruling, though questionable, is probably a move to preserve their privacy and keep away from extra reinforcement from their respective professions.“Taylor’s been in this biz long enough to know what comes with being in the spotlight,” they added.The Chiefs star recently disclosed his relationship during an appearance on the Stephen A. Smith Show. “I’m enjoying all aspects of life,"" said Kelce. ""Me and Taylor are happy and I couldn’t be happier to enjoy that confidence off the field and all the support I could ever ask for at the stadium.""He added, “I think personally, the beauty of being in a very strong relationship is that you get that support to be able to come in and focus on your craft, focus on being the best version of you. I think I’m as focused as I’ve ever been on my job and being the best player that I could possibly be week in, week out for this team.""Also Read: “Enjoyed a quiet night”: Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift return to the spotlight following international getaway after Chiefs' Super Bowl loss","Travis Kelce, 35, and Taylor Swift, also 35, started dating over the summer of 2023.

What Sparked Anthony Edwards' Heated Shoving Match with Lakers' Jarred Vanderbilt?

now

The sweet symphony of squeaking sneakers and simmering rivalries. In the Lakers-Timberwolves clash at Crypto.com Arena delivered a spicy side dish alongside the hardwood action. Forget popcorn, we were served a full-blown shoving match between Minnesota’s golden boy, Anthony Edwards , and his former teammate, the Lakers ’ defensive dynamo, Jarred Vanderbilt . Think less ""friendly reunion"" and more ""awkward family dinner where someone spills the gravy.""The post-first-quarter buzzer brawl, resulting in technical fouls for both, wasn't just a fleeting moment of heat. It was a potential harbinger of doom for the Timberwolves . While things cooled down quickly, the damage was done. Edwards , already flirting with suspension, now sits precariously at 15 technical fouls – one measly whistle away from a mandatory sit-out.Let's break it down: a team already battling injuries, facing a Lakers squad hungry for playoff positioning (evidenced by their dominant 58-47 halftime lead), now risks losing its offensive linchpin. Edwards, averaging a blistering 27.5 points per game, is the engine that makes the Timberwolves roar. Without him, the offense could sputter like a vintage car running on fumes.Why is this so critical? With 22 regular-season games remaining, and a playoff berth on the horizon, the odds of Edwards picking up another technical are higher than a LeBron James dunk. Every contested call, every perceived slight, every passionate outburst becomes a potential landmine. The Lakers, smelling blood in the water, capitalized on the Timberwolves' internal turmoil, dominating the first half.The psychological impact cannot be understated. Knowing their star is walking a tightrope, the Timberwolves' focus might waver. Every possession becomes a pressure cooker. Can they afford Edwards' fiery spirit, or will it ultimately burn them? The Lakers, meanwhile, are likely relishing the potential advantage. They know a weakened Timberwolves team is easier prey.ALSO READ: LeBron James Celebrates After Beating Dallas Mavericks: What’s the Justin Timberlake Connection? This isn't just about fouls and suspensions. It's a narrative. It's drama. It's the kind of storyline that makes fans hold their breath, wondering if Edwards can keep his cool, or if the Timberwolves will pay the price for a moment of on-court chaos.","Anthony Edwards and Jarred Vanderbilt were involved in a post-first-quarter shoving match.

When and where to watch the Cleveland Cavaliers play tonight against the Boston Celtics (February 28, 2025)?

The Cleveland Cavaliers have received a significant boost ahead of their highly anticipated matchup against the Boston Celtics on Friday, February 28, with star guard Darius Garland declared fit to play. Garland, who was previously listed on the injury report with a hip issue, has been cleared and is expected to take the court at TD Garden for the 7:30 p.m. ET tip-off. Darius Garland ’s return comes at a crucial time for the Cleveland Cavaliers, who are enjoying a stellar season with a 48-10 record. The 24-year-old point guard has been a key contributor, averaging 18.9 points and 5.6 assists over the last 20 games. His ability to orchestrate the offense and knock down perimeter shots—averaging 2.5 three-pointers per game during that stretch—will be vital against a Celtics team known for its defensive prowess.The Celtics, sitting at 42-17, have their own injury concerns heading into the game. Jrue Holiday (finger), Jaylen Brown (thigh), and Luke Kornet (personal) are all listed as questionable, potentially leaving Boston shorthanded. Despite these uncertainties, the Celtics remain a formidable opponent, led by Jayson Tatum, who ranks seventh in the league with 26.6 points per game.Cleveland’s offense, which ranks second in the NBA with 122.9 points per game, will look to exploit any gaps in Boston’s defense. Donovan Mitchell , the Cavaliers’ leading scorer, has been in exceptional form, averaging 24.9 points over the last 20 games. With Darius Garland back in the lineup, the backcourt duo of Mitchell and Garland could prove to be a nightmare for the Celtics.Defensively, the Cavaliers have been solid, allowing just 111.2 points per game, good for 10th in the league. Jarrett Allen, who averages 10.3 rebounds per game, will be tasked with controlling the paint against Boston’s Kristaps Porzingis and Al Horford.Garland’s return not only bolsters the Cavaliers’ chances in this marquee matchup but also signals his readiness to contribute as the team gears up for the postseason. Fans can catch the action live on ESPN, NBCS-BOS, or FDSOH, or stream the game on Fubo, with regional restrictions potentially applying.Also read: Will Jayson Tatum play tonight against the Cleveland Cavaliers?

Damon Wayans Leaves Shaq In TEARS, Reacts To Luka’s Huge Game & Hilarious BPS vs WPS

Basketball and Hollywood have often crossed paths, but few friendships in the sports and entertainment world are as unique as the one between Damon Wayans .

So, I can remember going to the game and being like ‘Oh s**t, that’s Damon Wayans’, ‘Oh s**t, that’s Eddie Murphy’, ‘Oh s**t, that’s Tom Cruise’. I wanted to give them the joy that they gave me,” Shaq said.Shaq’s struggles at the free-throw line were certainly hilarious for Wayans. He was a regular at Lakers games and wasn’t shy about heckling O’Neal every time he missed a shot. “Damon was always there. And when I missed free throws, he’d give it to me…” the NBA Hall of Famer continued, adding, “So, whenever I would win, I would find out where my favorite people lived at, and I would just send them that as a token of my appreciation.”Instead of taking offense, Shaq found joy in the playful ribbing. In fact, he credits Wayans and his legendary comedic family for being a source of relief during the intense grind of an NBA season.O’Neal explained that, as a professional athlete, it was his job to entertain, just as actors and comedians do in Hollywood. Growing up watching stars like Wayans, Eddie Murphy, and Tom Cruise, he felt a deep respect for the people who brought him joy. Gifting memorabilia, including his championship rings, was his way of giving back.Beyond the courtside jokes, Shaq has maintained a close relationship with the entire Wayans family , crediting them with helping him escape the pressures of his basketball career.“The Wayans family was at the apex of making me laugh,” O’Neal said, explaining how their comedic genius provided much-needed distractions from the rigors of life in the NBA.Also Read: Shaq Wants Luka Doncic to Be Pettier: Is He Holding Back Against the Mavericks?

He was also perfect from the free-throw line, converting all 12 attempts.After the game, the Warriors took to X (formerly Twitter) to sum up the night in just five words: “The greatest show in sports.” It is indeed, if not the greatest, certainly one of the most dominant showdowns in the recent history of the NBA.Golden State’s acquisition of Jimmy Butler from the Miami Heat at the trade deadline was a move designed to bolster their postseason push. Since adding Butler, the Warriors have gone 7-1.While Butler had a quiet night against the Magic, scoring just five points on 1-of-7 shooting, his chemistry with the team is certainly remarkable.

""You're probably never going to see me on the ice again.""

""Instant retirement.""

""I don't like the word 'if'. We live today, we play, we move on."" says Alex Ovechkin about retiring after breaking Wayne Gretzky's record

""Do you follow the KHL? Your long-time teammate Ilya Kovalchuk, who returned to hockey at the age of 40?""

""I check the score periodically. Ilya is great. We talked to him recently. Getting ready for playoffs. I think this man, with his health and approach to business, can play until he is 50 years old. The most important thing is that he himself wants it.""

""Can you reach 50?""

""No!""

""Will you finish out your current contract in NHL, and that's it?""

""I think, yes.""

""And, if you don't manage to break Gretzky's goal record, won't you re-sign for the season?""

""I don't like the word 'if'. We live today, we play, we move on.""

""Of course, it (breaking Wayne Gretzky's record) matters. But, like I said, I'm not going to score 300 goals in two years. It's going to take five or six years. I have to be healthy enough to do that. I don't want to play just for that record. I want to be healthy, I want to have fun, I want to enjoy the moment when I'm on the ice.""

""Work, and everything will be fine. The most important thing is not showing off. Because when anyone shows off, it can come back to bite you in a big way.""

Isaiah Bond wants to erase Xavier Worthy and John Ross from the 40-yard dash record books

""I plan to run a 4.20, possibly 4.1,""

If Isaiah Bond runs a 4.1, the NFL world has a decision to make

Isaiah Bond isn’t guessing. He’s certain. The Texas wide receiver is stepping onto the turf at Lucas Oil Stadium on Saturday, fully expecting to walk away as the fastest player in NFL Scouting Combine history.Bond told reporters on Friday.That’s not just confidence. That’s a straight-up declaration. And considering Bond has already clocked a 4.23 before, it’s not empty talk. He’s not hoping—he’s expecting.Xavier Worthy barely had time to celebrate his record before Bond set his sights on it. Last year, Worthy—also a Texas wide receiver—shattered John Ross’ 4.22-second record with a 4.21 at the combine. A blink, a step, and history changed.Now? Bond is calling for a 4.20. Maybe even a 4.1.he said via Clarence Hill Jr. of All City DLLS.If he actually does it, he’s not just breaking a record—he’s redefining what’s possible. A 4.1 at the combine would be absurd. No one has ever done it, and frankly, most don’t believe it’s possible. But Bond does.Speed kills in the NFL. A record-breaking 40-yard dash could send Bond’s draft stock skyrocketing, even if he’s not currently projected as a top pick. If a 4.1 flashes on that timer, scouts and GMs are going to be scrambling.Fast receivers have gotten over-drafted before (hi, John Ross). But Bond isn’t just banking on speed. He’s betting on himself, knowing that if he backs up his talk, teams won’t be able to ignore him.It all comes down to Saturday. If Bond runs a 4.20? That’s history. If he runs a 4.1? That’s a different conversation. The kind that gets people paid.","Isaiah Bond says he'll break the 40-yard dash record on Saturday. The Texas wide receiver has already clocked a 4.23.

'IOA's decision undermines BFI's autonomy'

NEW DELHI: Echoing the sentiment of their fellow boxers, two of India's premier women boxers — Nikhat Zareen and Lovlina Borgohain — have called for expeditious elections in the Boxing Federation of India (BFI) and a swift resolution of the deadlock between the sport's governing body and Indian Olympic Association (IOA) over the formation of an ad-hoc committee. The boxers asserted that the ongoing stalemate has impacted their training regimen for important forthcoming championships.Two-time world champion Nikhat said that the boxers are ""clueless"" about their future, having been deprived of exposure trips and international competitions since the Paris Olympics in July-Aug last year. The 28-year-old from Nizamabad highlighted the federation's inability to conduct the elite women's Nationals, national camp and facilitate participation in the Strandja Memorial meet in Sofia.""Boxers shouldn't suffer because of the BFI's election issue. We don't know what the future has in store for us. All I have been doing is training at the Army Sports Institute (ASI) in Pune since Jan this year,"" Nikhat told TOI, ""This is an important year, with the World boxing championships in Liverpool in Sep and then the World Cup season finals in Nov in India. We (boxers) need certain clarity about the national camp, exposure trips and competitions abroad. We missed the Strandja meet where India has been a regular participant.""I would like the BFI to conduct its elections at the earliest, so that the new set of office-bearers can prepare the future roadmap, and the things can be streamlined,"" she added.Lovlina, the Tokyo Games bronze medallist, asserted that boxers should not bear consequences for circumstances beyond their control. ""As a boxer, our responsibility is to train well, represent the country and secure medals. All we require is a proper structure. There's a necessity to devise a comprehensive strategy regarding our training and competition for the future tournaments. Since the Paris Games, nothing substantial has happened in Indian boxing. It's time the boxers went out and competed,"" the three-time World Championships medallist stated.Nikhat, who resumed training after a three-month long injury lay-off following the Olympics, added that the administrative impasse has left the boxers a ""confused lot"", with respect on whose instructions to follow – BFI or the ad-hoc panel.""The BFI is saying something, ad-hoc committee is saying something. There are factions within the federation. Then, I suppose, there's a court case going on. I don't know what to do (in this situation). The only good news is that the IOC has granted (provisional) recognition to World Boxing.""World Boxing president Boris van der Vorst has written to IOA president PT Usha, stating that the formation of the ad-hoc committee by the latter ""undermines the BFI's autonomy"" and the decision is ""not fully justifiable"".Vorst said that the unfortunate situation in India ""is not a fruit of bad faith and (has been) influenced by those who have placed boxing in the difficult position to which World Boxing has fought so hard to crawl out of"".",Nikhat Zareen and Lovlina Borgohain have called for expeditious elections in the Boxing Federation of India (BFI) They also want a swift resolution of the deadlock between the sport's governing body and Indian Olympic Association (IOA) over the formation of an ad-hoc committee.

Things got intense regarding the Men’s Elimination Chamber on the go-home edition of SmackDown from the Scotiabank Arena. But the biggest highlight of that segment was Logan Paul playing with the emotions of the fans who thought John Cena had come back earlier than expected.The February 28th edition of Friday Night SmackDown in Toronto, Canada, saw an intense in-ring segment between all the qualified WWE superstars for the 2025 Men’s Elimination Chamber match. It began with Drew McIntyre interrupting a video package promoting John Cena’s last appearance inside the Elimination Chamber.He threw major shade at the Cenation Leader, labelling him as a ‘Hypocrite.’ Damien Priest came out and highlighted the fact that McIntyre’s obsession with CM Punk and ego costed him multiple opportunities in 2024. Seth Rollins was next to join the fray and this was followed by the arrival of CM Punk.The Best in the World took shots at all the men standing in front of him and John Cena, who was absent. Just at that moment, Cena’s music hit, and the crowd erupted in a loud cheer. But the excitement was quickly diffused with the arrival of Logan Paul, who trolled the fans in a big way. Paul laughed in the face of the WWE Universe, who were disappointed that it was not the Cenation Leader.On the other hand, The Maverick boosted about his own forthcoming victory and vowed to beat all the five former World Champions to head to WrestleMania for an Undisputed WWE Championship against Cody Rhodes. While John Cena was not present on SmackDown, he will be appearing tomorrow for the Elimination Chamber PLE as an in-ring competitor for the last time as part of his farewell tour.The Cenation Leader was the only WWE superstar in the match who declared his entry straight into the Elimination Chamber without going through a qualifying match.

Mason Taylor made other tight ends look unprepared at the NFL Combine drills

“Mason Taylor is clearly in a different tier than the other tight ends working out.”

Mason Taylor is the best blocker in this tight-end class and deserves a first-round discussion

Mason Taylor’s LSU Pro Day could lock in his spot as a first-round pick

""Every opportunity is an open door,""

""Every time a team wants to talk to you, it’s a blessing.""

Mason Taylor walked into the offseason as a second or third-round prospect. That might not be the case anymore. The LSU tight end has been stacking wins—first at the Reese’s Senior Bowl, where his blocking and receiving skills had scouts paying attention, and now at the NFL Combine, where he put on a clinic during on-field drills.Taylor didn’t participate in testing, but that didn’t matter. He looked sharper than anyone else in the drills, turning heads and forcing analysts to reconsider where he stands in this tight-end class.Harold Fannin Jr., Gunnar Helm, and Terrance Ferguson came into the Combine ranked ahead of Mason Taylor on some draft boards. That changed once the drills started.Rich Eisen and Daniel Jeremiah couldn’t stop talking about how smooth Taylor looked running the gauntlet drill. He made it look routine. Effortless.ESPN draft analyst Matt Miller didn’t hold back either.NFL draft analyst Jordan Reid also noted how comfortable Taylor looked, and at this point, the buzz is undeniable—Taylor belongs in the top tier of this class.Right now, most draft analysts have Tyler Warren and Colston Loveland ranked ahead of Mason Taylor. That’s mostly because those two were the focal points of their offenses. Taylor wasn’t. LSU’s offense revolved around its wide receivers, which means his numbers don’t tell the full story.But here’s what the numbers won’t show: Taylor is the best blocking tight end in this draft class. Period. He handles defenders like a lineman and still moves like a receiver.That’s a skill NFL teams value. Some of the best tight ends in the league aren’t just receivers—they’re complete players who can protect the quarterback and open up the run game. Taylor fits that mold better than anyone in this draft.Mason Taylor still has one more chance to prove himself before the draft. LSU’s Pro Day is coming up, and this time, he’ll participate in full testing. A solid 40-yard dash and strong athletic numbers could erase any doubt about his first-round potential.He doesn’t have the concerns that held back his father, Jason Taylor, or his uncle, Zach Thomas, when they were entering the league. He’s not undersized. He’s not overlooked. But he still carries the same mentality—nothing is guaranteed.Taylor said at the Combine.He’s handled every opportunity perfectly so far. One more, and Mason Taylor could hear his name called on Day 1 of the NFL Draft.","Mason Taylor put on a clinic during on-field drills at the NFL Combine.

NEW DELHI: Abhay Singh , popularly known as ' IIT Baba ', has alleged that he was assaulted during a news debate at a private channel’s studio in Noida on Friday, according to news agency PTI.In a complaint to the police, 'IIT Baba' claimed that a group of saffron-clad individuals entered the newsroom, misbehaved with him, and beat him with sticks.

John Tortorella bitterly condemned the referees for their decision during the Flyers vs Penguins game

The Philadelphia Flyers lost 5-4 to the Pittsburgh Penguins in an overtime game filled with controversy. A pivotal moment was during the second period when Flyers' forward Garnet Hathaway was checked into the boards by Penguins' player Boko Imama from behind, away from the puck. At first, Imama received a five-minute major penalty but later was reduced to a two-minute minor following a review. The ruling angered Flyers head coach John Tortorella , who bitterly condemned the referees for their decision.The Philadelphia Flyers lost 5-4 in overtime to the Pittsburgh Penguins, spearheaded by star player Sidney Crosby . The game was marred by a contentious incident that angered Flyers head coach John Tortorella, who did not mince words in condemning the NHL referees .The altercation occurred during the second period when Flyers forward Garnet Hathaway was checked from behind by Penguins player Boko Imama while he was not on the puck. The impact of the hit left Hathaway dazed, needing help to exit the ice. The referees initially called Imama a five-minute major penalty for interference, but upon further review, they reduced the call to a two-minute minor.This ruling did not sit well with Tortorella, who was clearly angered and outspoken about his opposition. He strongly disapproved of the refereeing, indicating that he believed the referees made a wrong call. The issue contributed another layer of friction to an already heated rivalry between the two clubs.“It’s probably one of the dirtiest hits I’ve seen in quite a while. That’s a dangerous, cheap hit,” Tortorella said in front of the reporters after game against the Penguins. The Flyers' head coach, as reported by Reuters, deemed the referees' decision to be a mistake and deemed the play to be dangerous.“The explanation was it was not a hit to the head on the hit, that he hit his head on the ice. The hit is why he hits his head on the ice. I believe we should be thinking about what really happened, and not get glued on a hit to head originally,” he added.Also Read: “He doesn’t quite have that same explosiveness”: Mike Johnson noted that Auston Matthews appears less sharp, likely due to fatigue rather than injury","Philadelphia Flyers lost 5-4 to the Pittsburgh Penguins in an overtime game filled with controversy.

BRIEF SCORES:

NAGPUR: Sachin Baby sunk to his knees after having miscued the slog sweep. Playing his 100th first-class game, the Kerala skipper had till then been concentration personified for 235 balls. That ill-fated shot on Day Three of the Ranji Trophy final at Jamtha Stadium on Friday, however, allowed Vidarbha the way back into the game. Just two short of his century, and with Kerala 56 adrift of Vidarbha's first-innings total, Baby (98; 235b, 10x4) attempted the uncharacteristic shot off left-arm spinner Parth Rekhade. He couldn't connect properly, and Karun Nair at deep midwicket promptly pouched the skier.As the Vidarbha players danced in celebration, Baby remained on his knees, the costly error of judgement having sunk in.After Baby's dismissal, Jalaj Saxena and the tail batted for 15.1 overs, scoring just 18 runs as Kerala were dismissed for 342. In between, Vidarbha's Harsh Dubey trapped Nidheesh MD LBW to enter the record books as the man to take the most wickets in a Ranji Trophy season.“Baby played a good knock. I think his plan was to hold one end. But a brain-fade moment resulted in his wicket. Definitely, that was a turning point for us as he was building a good partnership with Jalaj Saxena. Our plan was to stop the runs and wait for a bad shot,” Dubey said about Baby's dismissal.The end of Day Three saw Vidarbha earn a slender 37-run lead. The final, though, is far from over. Having Jalaj Saxena and Aditya Sarvate, spinners of high repute, Kerala will still be harbouring thoughts of plotting a Vidarbha collapse on a pitch assisting tweakers.Friday's action was all about two milestone men — Baby and Dubey — toiling hard under the harsh sun. Baby started the day with a boundary. Aditya Sarwate, who led the Kerala charge the other day, though, looked a bit edgy. Sarwate's 79-run knock (185b;10x4) ended when a Harsh Dubey ball rose sharply to hit the shoulder of his bat and lobbed up to close in fielder Danish Malewar.Vidarbha 379 in 123.1 overs lead Kerala (overnight 131/3 in 39 overs) 342 in 125 overs (Sachin Baby 98, Aditya Sarvate 79, Ahammed Imran 37, Mohammed Azharuddeen 34, Jalaj Saxena 28; Parth Rekhade 3-65, Harsh Dubey 3-88, Darshan Nalkande 3-52, Yash Thakur 1-83) by 37 runs.",Vidarbha earn a slender 37-run lead at the end of Day Three of the Ranji Trophy final at Jamtha Stadium.

Lewis Hamilton Embraces Criticism as Fuel for Ferrari Challenge



Lewis Hamilton has never been one to shy away from criticism. Instead, he has used it as a driving force to push himself forward. The seven-time world champion, now embarking on a fresh chapter with Ferrari , has made it clear that negative remarks, including those from former F1 figures like Eddie Jordan and Bernie Ecclestone, do not shake his resolve. On the final day of pre-season testing in Bahrain, Hamilton reiterated that such critiques only add to his motivation.Throughout his illustrious career, Hamilton has been no stranger to scrutiny. However, he remains unbothered, focusing instead on his personal growth and pursuit of excellence. ""In our sport, criticism is something that everyone receives,"" he acknowledged. ""I have probably received a lot more of it perhaps throughout my career but I just keep my head down, doing what I’m doing. I know that I’m growing each day, I’m bound to make mistakes, I’m only human but one thing that I’m proud of is I have a drive, a focus.""His ability to acknowledge mistakes and use setbacks as lessons has been a hallmark of his success. ""I’m able to admit when I’m wrong and I know that tomorrow I will work to be better and it really doesn’t matter to me some of the comments that have come up over my career... I use that as fuel,"" he added. This mindset will be crucial as he steps into a new era with Ferrari, leaving behind a 12-year tenure with Mercedes that saw him clinch six drivers' championships.Hamilton’s switch to Ferrari has generated immense anticipation, not just among fans but within the F1 paddock as well. The move comes at a time when Mercedes has struggled to adapt to the post-2022 regulations, while Red Bull, McLaren, and Ferrari have closed the gap at the front. Despite the challenges, Hamilton is approaching his debut season with the Italian team with renewed energy and confidence.Following the conclusion of three days of pre-season testing, Hamilton expressed a strong sense of optimism about the SF25. His gut feeling about the car and his new team’s operations is overwhelmingly positive. ""I would say this is the most positive feeling that I’ve had in a long time,"" he admitted. ""I feel like in this period of time we’ve built a really good foundation but everyone, you know these guys out there, look really, really quick, really competitive.""While the true pecking order will only be revealed once the racing begins, Hamilton remains encouraged by the hard work of his Ferrari colleagues. ""It looks very very close. We won’t know obviously until next week truly, exactly where we stand but we know that we’ve got work to do and everyone is just heads down and I’ve been really inspired and really encouraged by my colleagues,"" he stated.Also Read: Lewis Hamilton responds with class to Eddie Jordan's bold claim on Ferrari move being “suicidal” With the new season on the horizon, Hamilton’s hunger for an eighth world championship remains as strong as ever.

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.
