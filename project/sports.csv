Jade Cargill has been positioned as a top singles star since her return to WWE





Jade Cargill's time to become the top star of the women's division might be nearing soon. WWE made a huge signing back in 2023 when they acquired Jade Cargill, who left All Elite Wrestling to sign with the global juggernaut. She made her remarkable debut in the 2024 Women's Royal Rumble, and that night marked the beginning of her rise in the company. However, she has still not held a major singles title in the promotion. Yet, recent events and reports might be hinting that The Storm might be ready to take over the landscape.For her first year in WWE, Jade Cargill was aligned with The EST of WWE, Bianca Belair. The duo was showcased as a dominant duo who took the tag team division by storm. In doing so, Cargill and Belair became the two-time WWE Women's Tag Team Champions. The Storm's momentum was derailed after she was mysteriously attacked backstage and was written off television.The former TBS Champion returned to WWE at the 2025 Elimination Chamber PLE. She began a feud with Naomi, who was revealed to be her attacker. Their rivalry led to a captivating bout at WrestleMania 41. However, since that point onwards, WWE had been pushing Cargill as a singles star.On the SmackDown following Mania, she was put in a singles bout against the reigning WWE Women's Champion, Tiffany Stratton.While Jade Cargill has not clinched a one-on-one championship match yet and missed many opportunities, she delivered some exceptional in-ring performances. This has made her a star in her own right. Moreover, it has been reported by PWInsider that she is in line for a major push and a top match at the all-women's Premium Live Event coming up, WWE Evolution 2. Her opponent has been rumored to be Naomi, and the match is said to be a stipulation bout.Moreover, she is also taking part in the Queen of the Ring tournament, which would guarantee the winner a WWE Women's title match at SummerSlam 2025. With her incredible run so far, praise from backstage personnel, and multiple opportunities coming up, it seems that Cargill would be the next marquee star and hold major singles gold in the coming months.Also read: Rising WWE superstar reveals her personal boundaries being invaded by fans",Jade Cargill has been positioned as a top singles star since her return to WWE.

NFL Rumors: Cleveland Browns could trade Rookie QB Dillon Gabriel in strategic quarterback move,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/nfl-rumors-cleveland-browns-could-trade-rookie-qb-dillon-gabriel-in-strategic-quarterback-move/articleshow/121785459.cms,"Browns may trade rookie QB Dillon Gabriel to clear up roster (Image via: Getty Images)

Why Dillon Gabriel might be the odd man out





The Cleveland Browns are staring down one of the most intriguing quarterback dilemmas of the 2025 NFL offseason. With veteran names like Joe Flacco and Kenny Pickett already in the mix, and two freshly drafted prospects—Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders—added to the fold, the Browns are overloaded at the game’s most important position. And now, all signs point to one reality: someone’s got to go.While the Browns selected Dillon Gabriel nearly 50 picks ahead of Shedeur Sanders in this year’s draft, draft order doesn’t always translate to roster security. As camps approach, speculation is growing that Cleveland may look to trade Gabriel rather than risk exposing him to waivers where another team would likely scoop him up for nothing.The Browns' front office is reportedly weighing the possibility of flipping Gabriel in a pre-season deal. Doing so would not only free up a roster spot but also help recoup value for a player who may not crack the final depth chart. With most NFL teams desperate for even a serviceable backup, Gabriel could fetch interest from franchises looking to bolster their QB room.But there's more at play than just numbers. Gabriel brings a dual-threat edge that makes him appealing to modern offenses. However, Shedeur Sanders brings buzz, branding, and the undeniable “star power” that makes it harder for a team to move on from him regardless of draft position.Letting either rookie walk is risky. Both have developmental upside, and both could turn into long-term assets. But keeping four quarterbacks simply isn’t realistic in today’s NFL. Joe Flacco showed his value down the stretch last season, and Kenny Pickett still holds trade value of his own, though less than what a recent rookie might command.Also Read: Chiefs eye future beyond Travis Kelce with potential trade for Raiders’ Michael Mayer If the Browns don’t act fast, they risk losing one of their young QBs to waivers with nothing in return. Trading Gabriel could be a calculated move not just to maintain control, but to protect long-term flexibility in the quarterback room. The Browns have made quarterback mistakes before. This one, they can’t afford to screw up.","Cleveland Browns may trade rookie QB Dillon Gabriel to clear up roster. Gabriel selected nearly 50 picks ahead of Shedeur Sanders in this year’s draft.

A modern celebrity couple under the microscope of public and media pressure





In a decision that’s sparking conversation across the sports world, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce has reportedly delayed his return to team training following his attendance at a wedding celebration with global pop icon Taylor Swift . Instead of heading straight back to Kansas City, Kelce remained in Florida, choosing to extend his time with Swift after the couple’s recent public appearance at the high-profile event.While the offseason workouts are voluntary, Travis Kelce’s absence didn’t go unnoticed. In a league built on discipline and relentless preparation, even a brief deviation from routine draws attention—especially when it involves one of the NFL’s most visible stars and his relationship with one of the world’s most famous entertainers. This choice, though personal, mirrors a growing trend among elite athletes prioritizing mental wellness and personal milestones alongside their professional grind.Some fans have welcomed the move. “He’s earned the right to take time for himself. The man’s been an ironman for the Chiefs,” one supporter commented on X (formerly Twitter). Yet others question whether his continued focus on his high-profile relationship may begin to interfere with team cohesion and performance—especially as the Chiefs gear up to defend their Super Bowl title.Kelce and Swift are not just a couple; they’re a cultural moment. Every public appearance, comment, and decision feeds into a narrative that fans devour. Their relationship has fueled massive headlines, from luxury date nights to joint vacations, and now, Kelce’s extended break post-wedding. This latest episode adds to the speculation: how much will their bond influence Kelce’s football future?What does it mean to be a professional athlete today?

Aaron Rodgers opens up about his secret marriage , emotional return to the NFL, and why joining the Pittsburgh Steelers was bigger than football

From Secret vows to Steelers legacy — Aaron Rodgers begins his final chapter under the brightest spotlight yet





Aaron Rodgers stood before a sea of cameras in Pittsburgh, not with a chip on his shoulder or a need to prove anything—but with a sense of peace. The 41-year-old quarterback, now a Steeler, opened his first press conference of the 2025 NFL season with honesty, depth, and a surprising personal reveal. His decision to come back for a 21st NFL season wasn’t about silencing doubters. Instead, it was about something far more personal—he says it was the right move for his soul, and for a fresh start rooted in purpose.Aaron Rodgers made it clear that ego played no part in his move to Pittsburgh. “A lot of decisions that I’ve made over my career and life from strictly the ego, even if they turn out well, are always unfulfilling,” he said Tuesday after the Steelers’ first mandatory minicamp practice. “But the decisions made from the soul are usually pretty fulfilling. So this was a decision that was best for my soul.”The Steelers supported him throughout the offseason, especially as he navigated personal struggles—including health scares involving close friends and family members battling cancer. Rodgers said those situations “have improved a bit,” clearing the way for his NFL return.Key to that comeback was longtime Pittsburgh head coach Mike Tomlin, whom Rodgers credited for inspiring “some of the coolest conversations I’ve had in the game.”“It starts with Mike Tomlin,” Rodgers said. “I’ve been a fan of his for a long time. There’s a few iconic franchises in the NFL. I played for one of ‘em for 18 years. This is another one of those.”Aaron Rodgers also confirmed what many had speculated after spotting a wedding band on his hand—he recently got married. “A couple months ago,” he shared, offering no further details except a past mention of a woman named Brittani.With a new team, a new city, and a renewed sense of purpose, Rodgers is ready to lead the Steelers into a pivotal season—one that opens with a fitting showdown against the Jets in Week 1.Also Read: Los Angeles Rams’ 2025 offensive trio quietly emerging as one of the NFL’s most dangerous units","Aaron Rodgers opened his first press conference of the 2025 NFL season with honesty, depth, and a surprising personal reveal.

After days of unrelenting speculation, Vanessa Bryant took to Instagram Stories on Sunday, June 1, to put the rumors to rest. Her response wasn’t a press statement or a legal warning, it was a wild meme with a big middle finger to the internet trolls. The meme featured music icon Rihanna floating in water with a snorkel mask on her head, holding a drink, and flipping her middle finger.“Me protecting my peace, not pregnant & having fun all summer,” Vanessa Bryant wrote in the caption on her response to the online trolls who spread her pregnancy rumors about five years after her husband, Kobe Bryant ’s, untimely and devastating demise.It was clear, clever, and vintage Vanessa who shut down noise without saying a word about the origin of the gossip. No press release needed when you’ve got Rihanna energy with a direct middle finger gesture.The rumors had emerged out of nowhere, with some users pointing to photos allegedly showing a ""baby bump,"" though no timestamps or context were attached to those images. Vanessa hasn't been publicly linked to anyone romantically, and there’s been zero confirmation from her side—until now.In another Instagram Story later that evening, Vanessa shared a motivational quote that hinted at how she views the entire situation and what matters to her personally.“The only way to impress me, is by being a good person,” the quote read. “I don’t care what you have, what you wear, where you live, or what you drive. I just have deep respect for people with pure hearts and good intentions.”Adding one final touch to her trilogy of clapbacks, she posted another Rihanna meme, this one stating, “I’m not mean, I’m just not the one.”With the classic Rihanna memes, Vanessa showed that she is busy being a proud mom to her daughters while being the powerhouse of her business ventures. While she does not care about the rumor mill, her reaction explicitly showed that she is urging privacy.Vanessa Bryant, who shares four daughters with Kobe— Natalia, Bianka, Capri, and the late Gianna— has remained devoted to family and philanthropy. Most recently, she shared footage of a joyful family ski trip over the holidays, showing the tight-knit bond she maintains with her children.Vanessa and Kobe Bryant tied the knot in April 2001. Tragically, in January 2020, Kobe and their 13-year-old daughter Gianna lost their lives in a helicopter crash that also killed seven others. They were headed to Kobe’s Mamba Sports Academy for a youth basketball game when the accident occurred. Kobe was 41 at the time. The loss shook the sports world and left a lasting impact on fans, friends, and loved ones across the globe. Kobe has left a huge legacy to his name as well, he is considered one the of the elite NBA superstars of all time with astounding stats, records and intense playmaking abilities. His demise created a huge void in the NBA world as fans are still mourning his untimely passing.Since their passing, she’s kept their memory alive through meaningful business ventures and charitable work. Kobe launched the Mamba Sports Foundation in 2016, aiming to support young athletes. After his death, Vanessa renamed it the Mamba & Mambacita Sports Foundation in honor of both Kobe and Gianna. Today, the foundation helps underserved boys and girls in sports, pushing forward the mission they believed in. It's her way of carrying on their legacy with purpose and heart.Vanessa Bryant’s response was indeed witty and empowering as she hinted that she deserves privacy and reminded the world that while she may be a public figure, her peace and dignity aren’t up for debate, especially not over unfounded gossip.

Why WWE is holding off on the Draft

Was R-Truth's Release a Work? Ilja Dragunov Return Update, Gunther's First Challenger & More

Fans divided over format and timing





The 2025 WWE Draft may not be cancelled after all. While the annual roster shake-up traditionally follows WrestleMania in the spring, this year’s edition appears to be headed for a strategic shift - possibly to September, according to multiple reports.Sources including BodySlam.net and PWInsider suggest that WWE is considering moving the Draft to a post-SummerSlam window, aligning it with the company’s season premiere episodes of RAW and SmackDown. This move would allow ongoing storylines to reach natural conclusions over the summer, while also setting the stage for a refreshed television product in the fall.Mike Johnson of PWInsider confirmed that the Draft hasn't been scrapped, saying it's simply a matter of “where and when to do it.” The shift is reportedly part of WWE’s broader strategy under Triple H’s creative leadership, which has focused on long-term storytelling and smoother transitions between brands.The delay also appears to be influenced by recent NXT call-ups, many of whom are still finding their footing on the main roster. With WWE not in a rush to reshuffle its rosters, the focus has shifted to making sure these fresh faces get enough screen time before any major realignment occurs.Wrestling insider WrestleVotes echoed the sentiment in a Sportskeeda WrestleBinge Q&A, noting that “they want to do it... just a date has not popped up yet.” The message is clear: WWE is still committed to a draft this year, but is carefully choosing its moment.Fan response on social media has been mixed. While some are relieved the Draft is still on, others have questioned its relevance. One user wrote, “What’s the point? Talent go all over the 3 brands all the time.” Another commented, “Make sure people actually move brands this year. Last year barely anyone got drafted to a new brand.”Others are simply nostalgic for the days of the old Draft lottery machine, calling the current format “bland.” However, there’s also cautious optimism. “Good. SmackDown needs it,” one fan posted, while another added, “Better late than never.”If plans hold, the WWE Draft 2025 will follow SummerSlam in early August and land sometime in September, just in time for WWE’s fall season reset. Until then, fans will be watching closely to see who stays, who goes - and who surprises everyone.Also Read: WWE Hall of Famer predicts Ron Killings could win World Championship",WWE is reportedly considering moving the Draft to a post-SummerSlam window.

NEW DELHI: The stage is set for the much-anticipated World Test Championship (WTC) Final as Australia take on South Africa at the iconic Lord’s from June 11–15.While all eyes are on the cricketing contest between two top-class teams, questions have arisen around the possible outcomes — particularly in the event of a draw or rain-affected Test.If the WTC Final between Australia and South Africa ends in a draw or tie, the World Test Championship mace will be shared between the two finalists. This has been a standard regulation for the one-off WTC final since its inception in 2021.There is no additional tiebreaker like a Super Over in Test cricket. Unlike bilateral Test series, where a draw simply concludes the contest with no winner, this being a championship final means both teams will be crowned joint winners if no result is possible.Yes. The ICC has allocated June 16 as a reserve day, which will be used only if net playing time lost during the scheduled five days is not recovered via extended sessions. The sixth day can add up to a maximum of 90 overs if required.If the five scheduled days allow full innings and time for results — even with weather interruptions — and still end in a draw or tie, the reserve day won’t be activated.Alongside the prestigious mace, there is plenty of financial incentive.The ICC has significantly raised the prize money for the 2023–25 WTC cycle.This increase reflects the growing stature of the Test format’s showpiece event, with both Australia and South Africa eager to add not just silverware, but also a record paycheck.Australia, the defending champions, led by Pat Cummins , are eyeing a repeat after their dominant win over India in the 2023 final. Their squad, brimming with experience, includes star names like Steve Smith, Mitchell Starc, and Marnus Labuschagne.In contrast, South Africa are chasing history. Temba Bavuma’s men are looking to end a 27-year ICC trophy drought. Since winning the 1998 ICC KnockOut, South Africa have consistently faltered in knockout stages, earning the tag of ""chokers.""

""This comes shortly after Rohit announced his retirement from Test cricket in May, putting an end to widespread speculation about his future in the longest format of the game.The 38-year-old had a highly impactful second half of his Test career, amassing 4,301 runs in 67 matches, including 12 centuries and 18 fifties, at an average of 40.57.Rohit had led India to the World Test Championship final against Australia and had been at the helm during several key series — barring the recent inconsistent outings against New Zealand at home and the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia.Despite stepping away from the Test format, Rohit will continue to represent India in ODIs.“It’s been an absolute honor to represent my country in whites,” he shared in an emotional Instagram post. “Thank you for all the love and support over the years.”Rohit's form had dipped during the 2024–25 season, where he managed an average of just 10.93 in 11 innings across eight Tests. Overall, he concluded his Test career with 4,301 runs in 67 matches, maintaining an average of 40.57 and notching up 12 hundreds.He took over the Test captaincy from Virat Kohli in March 2022 and during his tenure led India to 12 wins, nine losses, and three draws. As skipper, he also scored 1,254 runs.His tenure, however, ended with two back-to-back series defeats — a historic 3-0 loss to New Zealand at home and a 4-1 defeat in Australia, which cost India a place in the 2025 World Test Championship final.On the brighter side, Rohit had recently led India to major titles — the 2025 ODI Champions Trophy and the 2024 T20 World Cup — before retiring from T20Is as well.

Aaron Judge teases Giancarlo Stanton after his minor league performance in New Jersey

Giancarlo Stanton’s return date still unclear, but Aaron Boone gives hope





Fans are excited to see Giancarlo Stanton back on the field, but his New York Yankees teammate Aaron Judge had something cheeky to say. Stanton is recovering from an injury and played his first rehab game recently. But it wasn’t just his performance that caught attention—it was Judge’s playful comment that stirred conversation.On Tuesday, June 4, 2025, Giancarlo Stanton had his first rehabilitation game with the Somerset Patriots in Bridgewater Township, New Jersey. Double-A affiliates of the New York Yankees are the Somerset Patriots. The 35-year-old was put on the injured list in March of this year and has been out since October 2024 with an elbow injury.Stanton had four plate appearances in the game against the Portland Sea Dogs (a minor league team of the Boston Red Sox). Walked in the third inning; grounded out in first at-bat. Then, he hit two strong singles that helped drive in three runs.One of those hits bounced off the center field fence and brought in two runs. The next at-bat added another RBI. He also played just ahead of top Yankees prospects George Lombard Jr.and Spencer Jones.After hearing about Stanton’s performance, Aaron Judge, the Yankees’ captain, made a funny remark: “Only singles?” His tone was light, but the message was clear—Judge is expecting big home runs from his teammate. This playful jab came just before Stanton’s next scheduled rehab appearance on Wednesday, June 5.Also Read: Aaron Judge Just Ended 2017 Andrew Benintendi Debate With One Legendary Statline Yankees manager Aaron Boone spoke after their 10-2 win against Kansas City on Tuesday. He said Stanton is improving fast but doesn’t have a fixed return date yet. Boone said, “Stanton just needs to feel ready. He’s already had many at-bats, even before starting his rehab games.”Boone added that Stanton’s physical recovery is going well and that he’s hitting the ball hard again. The final decision will be made by both the player and the team.Stanton last played in the 2024 World Series, where the Yankees lost to the Dodgers. He was their best hitter during that postseason, with seven home runs and 16 RBIs. With his return approaching, fans and teammates like Judge are keeping a close eye—expecting more than just singles.","Giancarlo Stanton has been out since October 2024 with an elbow injury.

The 2022 trade connection that sparked Juan Soto and MacKenzie Gore rivalry

Juan Soto's redemption moment ignites New York Mets' comeback against Washington Nationals





Juan Soto's dramatic home run celebration and intense stare-down of Washington Nationals pitcher MacKenzie Gore became the defining moment of Tuesday night's thrilling 10-inning contest at Citi Field. The New York Mets superstar's defiant gesture after launching a 373-foot solo blast wasn't just typical baseball theater—it stemmed from a deeply personal competitive rivalry rooted in a blockbuster 2022 trade that forever linked these two talented players. Soto's theatrical moment helped fuel the New York Mets' remarkable comeback victory, defeating the Washington Nationals 5-4 in extra innings before an electric home crowd.The Juan Soto and MacKenzie Gore rivalry goes back to the August 2022 blockbuster trade that rocked Major League Baseball. Soto was traded to the San Diego Padres, along with prospects CJ Abrams, Robert Hassell III, and James Wood, in exchange from the Washington Nationals. This deal gave the two players an unavoidable relationship, where each one is a symbol of what the other organisation gave up.MacKenzie Gore came into Tuesday night with 114 strikeouts, the most in all of Major League Baseball, and has firmly established himself as one of the best left-handed pitchers in the sport.The ace of the Washington Nationals had been crushing the opposing batters throughout the season, and his clash with Juan Soto was especially intriguing. Their initial meeting of the night Gore fanned Soto on three sliders in a row, which would be a prelude to the stunning comeback the latter would make in the third inning.Juan Soto responded in resounding style in the third inning, as he turned on a 2-2 slider against MacKenzie Gore and crushed it 373 feet to left-center field, giving him a solo home run. The explosion made the lead of the Washington Nationals 3-2 instantaneously, yet it was the reaction of Soto that drew the attention of everyone. The New York Mets' home run hitter exchanged words with Gore as he rounded the bases and that made the scene a pure drama in baseball style that awakened both benches and the audience.The standoff was not merely a case of normal baseball gamesmanship. Juan Soto had gone through a difficult May in which his batting average had dropped to .224, and he was being questioned on how he was adapting to life with the New York Mets after signing a record-breaking $765 million, 15-year deal. His latest explosion (eight base hits in four games, raising his average to .341 in his last 12 games) proved that he was back in All-Star form at the right time.The two players later played down the Exchange later, with Juan Soto saying they were just greeting each other and MacKenzie Gore accepting they have a competitive relationship. Nevertheless, the instant undoubtedly served as a further impetus to the New York Mets' ultimate win, as Soto had an RBI double and made an outstanding defensive catch in the right field to clinch the thrilling extra-inning victory.Also Read: Nationals' bat-retrieving dog Bruce gets major league call-up and fans can't wait for his MLB debut The victory marked another chapter in Juan Soto's remarkable first season with the New York Mets, as he continues justifying his massive contract while helping establish the team as legitimate contenders in the National League East division race.","Juan Soto's dramatic home run celebration and intense stare-down of Washington Nationals pitcher MacKenzie Gore became the defining moment of Tuesday night's thrilling 10-inning contest.

Braves need a better hitter at shortstop to improve their offense

Could a new player like Bo Bichette fix Atlanta’s shortstop problem





The Atlanta Braves began the 2025 season with dreams of winning the World Series. Now, their playoff chances have fallen from 93 percent to just 26 percent. The team isn’t hitting enough home runs, even with a strong lineup. With the trade deadline a month away, the Braves need to make changes. Swapping shortstop Nick Allen for a better hitter could help save their season.Nick Allen is a great defender, making 12 outs above average this season. His defense is one of the best in the National League, only behind Bobby Witt Jr. But, his hitting is a problem, with just a .228 batting average in 56 games. The Braves need more runs, and Allen’s stats show he struggles at the plate.His expected stats, like xwOBA and xBA, are very low, meaning he doesn’t help the team score. While his defense is amazing, the Braves need a shortstop who can hit better. A stronger hitter could boost the team’s offense and help them reach the playoffs. With the trade deadline coming soon, the Braves should find a new shortstop to fill this role on an immediate basis.Also Read: MLB insider claims Braves are risking long term future by refusing to trade Marcell Ozuna before deadline Recent posts on X mention Bo Bichette, a Toronto Blue Jays shortstop, as a possible trade target.Bichette is a free agent after this season and could be available if Toronto doesn’t make the playoffs. He’s hitting .269 with eight home runs and 38 RBIs in 66 games.His offense is much better than Allen’s, though his defense isn’t as strong. Bichette could be a great fit for the Braves, helping them score more runs. However, other teams also want him, and Toronto might keep him if they’re close to the playoffs.The Braves could also look at the 2025 MLB draft for a new shortstop. For now, they need to act fast to find a better-hitting shortstop before the trade deadline ends.","Atlanta Braves need a better hitter at shortstop to improve their offense.

'Nitish Kumar is a guy who can bowl that magic ball': India bowling coach Morne Morkel

Poll Who do you think should be the seam-bowling all-rounder for the Leeds Test? Nitish Reddy Shardul Thakur Both should play

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep. 6: Harish Thawani on cricket's TV market and the watershed moments





NEW DELHI: Morne Morkel , India's bowling coach, believes that while Nitish Reddy can deliver ""magical"" balls, the batting all-rounder needs to increase his bowling workload to enhance his overall contribution in the forthcoming five-Test England series.Having scored a Test century against Australia at the MCG during last year's 'Boxing Day' Test, Reddy is competing with the experienced Shardul Thakur for the seam-bowling all-rounder position in the playing XI.Following Reddy's 26.5 overs in two 'Tests' against England Lions, Morkel has ""challenged"" him to expand his bowling responsibilities.""I think he (Reddy) is skilful. He is a guy who can bowl that magical ball. So for him, it is about creating that consistency, and that's something we want to work on. It's important for his game as well,"" the former South African fast bowling great said on the sidelines of India's training session, as quoted by PTI.""I've had conversations with him where I've challenged him to bowl a bit more. I want to see the ball more in his hands. We all know what he can do with the bat. But for a team, if you can have those bowling options, especially in these conditions, I think he'll be one to be excited and compliment his bowling at that,"" said Morkel.When questioned about the selection between Reddy and Shardul Thakur for the Leeds Test, Morkel remained diplomatic: ""In terms of the balance, we've got very happy with that. But for us as a bowling unit, finding that gear that we're going to need in Test matches is going to be important.""Morkel expressed confidence in the comprehensive nature of India's squad selection.He highlighted the importance of regaining Test match fitness, noting the extended period without Test cricket and the specific challenges of English conditions.""I think in terms of that we cover, like you say, all the bases. But for us now, the key thing is to get Test match fit, ready, that sharpness, to get that back. We haven't played Test matches for a while now,"" he noted. ""In England, the conditions can suit you, and it's overcast, but still it's going to be good surfaces. I think we're going to be testing that.""The primary focus remains on ensuring players maintain their fitness for 90-over days, according to Morkel.Regarding the upcoming four-day warm-up match against India A, Morkel expressed keen interest in observing the players' performance.""I think that's one of the things that has impressed me so much in these two-day sessions we've had. The guys sort of stepped up by themselves. They've taken that ownership, that responsibility, and realising that it's going to be a tough tour,"" he added.""I think that's the pleasing thing as coaches, to see guys taking that leadership and ownership in practice.""He noted the demanding nature of English outfields and weather conditions, emphasising the importance of swift adaptation to match fitness requirements.Morkel expressed satisfaction with the players' initiative during training sessions.Regarding Jasprit Bumrah 's preparation, Morkel dismissed concerns about limited match practice. ""He (Bumrah) knows how to get himself ready. He knows how to prepare. And like you say, I was blown away to see the energy in the ball the last three days. So that's very exciting to see happy 'Boom',"" he added. ""I'm just happy his body is in good shape at the moment and we'll manage him with that.

Former Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) player AB de Villiers wrote an emotional letter on Instagram celebrating RCB's first-ever Indian Premier League (IPL) title win on June 3, 2023, at Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. The South African legend watched from the stands as RCB defeated Punjab Kings (PBKS) to end their 18-year wait for the trophy.De Villiers holds the position of RCB's second-highest run-scorer with 4,522 runs in 157 matches at an average of 41.10, including two centuries and 37 half-centuries at a strike rate of 158.33.""Dear RCB family, Last night was something words will never fully do justice to, but I will try, because the heart deserves to speak when it is full. As I walked into the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, the sun had already dipped below the skyline, but it felt like the red of RCB still lit up the horizon. A neutral venue, they said, but when I heard the roar, saw the jerseys, the flags, the faces painted with red and gold, I knew this was home. ""De Villiers mentioned that despite being in Western India, the atmosphere felt like their home ground M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru.""What I witnessed was not just a cricket match, but a culmination. A culmination of belief, heartbreaks, near misses, miracles, and an undying loyalty that no trophy, until now, had been able to reward. But last night, it happened. RCB, the team that became family to me, are the champions of the IPL. Well, it feels good to say that.""The former RCB star shared a special moment with Virat Kohli during the match. ""And then, as if the night hadn't already stirred every emotion, there was Virat, standing at long off, right in front of me. Our eyes met for a brief moment, and that was all it took. We did not need words. In that quiet exchange, everything was understood. The years, the near misses, the weight we had both carried for this dream. There were tears, yes, but more than that, there was a deep, unspoken knowing. We have shared countless innings, conversations, and battles together, but the words he spoke after the game, the way he acknowledged our journey, contributions, and shared memories, it touched a part of me that few things in this game ever have. That moment reminded me. It is not about the numbers.""Quiz: Who's that IPL player? De Villiers expressed pride in seeing young players like Rajat Patidar and Devdutt Padikkal succeed on the big stage.""To the RCB management, to the coaching staff, to the ever loyal fans, and to every single player who's worn this jersey, thank you for allowing me to be a part of this beautiful legacy. Even though I was not out there batting last night, a piece of my heart always will be. This title means more because of the journey that came before it, and for me, this will always be one of the greatest joys of my life. Seeing the team I love finally lift their trophy. With all my love, pride, and gratitude, you Mr. 360.""In the final match, RCB posted 190/9 in 20 overs after being put in to bat.

Poll Do you believe that celebrity relationships can remain low-key like Crosby and Leutner's? Yes, absolutely! Not really, it's hard to stay private

Sidney Crosby 15 years long relationship with girlfriend Kathy Leutner





NHL legend Sidney Crosby has not only guided the Pittsburgh Penguins to championship heights but has also established a quiet, solid, long-lasting relationship off the ice with long-time girlfriend American model Kathy Leutner. Though Sidney Crosby's on-ice accomplishments are well-documented, his love life has long been kept under wraps. Kathy Leutner has been his constant companion, regularly seen cheering him on at pivotal matches but never hankering for the limelight herself.The two began dating back in 2008 when they were introduced by common friends. Sidney Crosby was an NHL superstar by then, while Kathy Leutner was establishing a thriving modeling career for brands including Abercrombie & Fitch, Hollister, and Faviana. She was selected in 2011 to appear on Sports Illustrated's model search and was one of the very few women from her agency to receive an in-office interview with the editorial team. Kathy Leutner has been Sidney Crosby's rock since the start of his NHL career. They met when he was just 21 years old, in his third NHL season with the Pittsburgh Penguins. Kathy Leutner has been often seen at Sidney Crosby's hockey games, supporting him as a Team Canada and Pittsburgh Penguins player.Born in 1986 in Chantilly, Virginia, Kathryn A. Leutner is the daughter of John and Judith Leutner. She graduated from Chantilly High School in 2004 and was offered a partial athletic scholarship from James Madison University, a testament to her prowess in the sport. Despite her strong ties to athletics, modeling quickly took over. She was discovered at a mall near her hometown, just a year after graduating from high school, while shopping with her mother.Kathy began her modeling career in 2005 and got her big break in 2011 when she appeared in Sports Illustrated magazineLeutner once confessed in an initial interview that sports was her main focus, but the moment she entered the modeling world, she knew that this was what she was meant to do. Her dream came true when she started gracing the covers of Fitness Magazine and landing campaigns for big lifestyle brands.The couple is yet to make any announcements of marriage plans; their long-term relationship speaks of a connection much stronger than social media pronouncements or red carpet sightings. Despite their lack of public announcements about their future plans, fans wish for a potential engagement or wedding.Sidney Crosby and Kathy Leutner are arguably the sport's most low-key celebrity couple, but their almost two-decade relationship is telling. Where fame usually drowns out personal life, this couple shows us that true love doesn't require attention. While Crosby keeps working on building his NHL legacy, Leutner is his biggest fan, sitting quietly in the background while still playing an important role behind the scenes.Also Read: With Mike Sullivan gone and Dan Muse in, Sidney Crosby’s loyalty faces the ultimate test",Sidney Crosby and Kathy Leutner have been together for 15 years.

Jannik Sinner's Romantic Link to Michael Schumacher's Ex: What's Happening?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/international-sports/jannik-sinners-romantic-link-to-michael-schumachers-ex-whats-happening/articleshow/121781476.cms,"Image via Instagram/ Jannik Sinner

What drew the media attention towards Sinner’s private life





W hen tennis star Jannik Sinner took the court at the French Open this June, it wasn’t just his explosive backhand or fiery matches entering the headlines—it was his personal life. Rumors linking him romantically with Laila Hasanovic, who was previously linked to F1 racer Michael Schumacher , exploded alongside intense media scrutiny. While love stories in sports aren’t new, their presence during a Grand Slam adds a different beat to the athlete’s rhythm. Rather than focus on court stats or sponsorships, this piece explores how off-court relationships—real or rumored—shape the public perception and internal world of rising champions like Sinner in modern tennis.Across social platforms and tabloids, the chatter was quite loud. Fans worldwide speculated over the unlikely match: “F1 star Mick Schumacher’s model ex‑girlfriend sparks Jannik Sinner dating rumours as she watches his French Open final defeat”. Though the original Daily Mail story led the narrative, it’s essential to separate speculation from fact.According to Sinner’s Wikipedia page, the 23‑year‑old Italian—currently having lost the French Open to Alcaraz—was in a known relationship with athlete Anna Kalinskaya from June 2024 until their split in early May 2025.Kalinskaya herself, a Russian tennis pro, had confirmed on the French Open grounds that they were dating, maintaining they “keep everything very confidential. You know my confidentiality… I won’t say more”.Interestingly, the rumored connection to Laila Hasanovic overlaps with this timeline. But Sinner has not publicly confirmed any relationship beyond Kalinskaya. And while tabloids often spotlight these stories—especially during big tournaments—many athletes choose discretion in their private lives. Of course, what stands out is how quickly such rumors can influence fan attention and media framing. While Sinner geared up to launch his Jannik Sinner Foundation in April 2025 to empower youth through sport, the juxtaposition between philanthropic focus of the tennis star and dating rumours couldn’t be sharper.Jannik Sinner’s tennis has always spoken volumes—but his personal life, be it private or publicly speculated, adds resonance to his public persona. In a world where relationships can be headlines overnight, maintaining focus becomes both art and necessity. As Sinner continues to define himself—on court, off court, and through charity work—it’s worth remembering that every ace, every sponsorship, and every off-court headline is but one part of the story. Behind the rumors lies a human navigating pressure, success, and scrutiny—balancing love, legacy, and life with poise.","Tennis star Jannik Sinner has been linked to model Laila Hasanovic.

What the Los Angeles Lakers Give Up

The Bigger Picture for Los Angeles





Theface a crucial offseason after a playoff run that exposed their frontcourt weaknesses. With Anthony Davis now in Dallas, the team lacks a reliable center, making a trade for a star big man a top priority. One potential solution? A blockbuster deal for Utah Jazz forwardA hypothetical trade scenario by NBA writer Greg Swartz of Bleacher Report outlines how the Lakers could land Markkanen. Here’s the breakdown:- F Lauri Markkanen- F Rui Hachimura- G/F Dalton Knecht- PG Gabe Vincent- F Maxi Kleber- 2031 first-round pick (unprotected)Swartz explains the rationale behind the move: ""The Lakers will always be on the hunt for stars, yet are limited in trade assets after acquiring Luka Dončić at the deadline. Markkanen is probably the best level of player Los Angeles can reasonably acquire and would be a strong third option behind Dončić and LeBron James.""Lauri Markkanen brings versatility to the Los Angeles Lakers ’ lineup. Standing at 7 feet tall, he can play both forward positions and even fill in as a stretch center. His skill set addresses two major needs:- Scoring Boost: With a career average of 18.2 points per game, Markkanen provides reliable offense.- Frontcourt Depth: His ability to space the floor complements LeBron James and Luka Dončić However, durability concerns linger. Markkanen hasn’t played more than 60 games in the past two seasons, which could be a risk for the Lakers.The trade costs Los Angeles four rotation players and a future first-round pick. Here’s what they lose:- Rui Hachimura: A solid two-way forward.- Dalton Knecht: A promising young wing.- Gabe Vincent: A reliable backup guard.- Maxi Kleber: A veteran big with playoff experience.- 2031 first-round pick: The only available pick after the rescinded Charlotte Hornets deal.While the price is steep, the Lakers gain financial flexibility to pursue additional moves in free agency.This trade positions the Los Angeles Lakers to compete immediately while keeping their long-term options open. Lauri Markkanen’s arrival would solidify their frontcourt, giving them a much-needed third star alongside Dončić and James.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors might chase $36 million Chicago Bulls star to boster squad and improve Stephen Curry's title odds The offseason will reveal whether the front office pulls the trigger, but one thing is clear: the Lakers are hunting for upgrades, and Markkanen could be their best realistic target.","Los Angeles Lakers are eyeing a major trade for Utah Jazz forward Lauri Markkanen.

Virat Kohli retires from Test cricket after 14 years





NEW DELHI: Former India head coach Ravi Shastri got emotional on Wednesday while reflecting on Virat Kohli ’s retirement from Test cricket. Shastri, who shared a successful tenure with Kohli during his captaincy, witnessing several memorable series wins, said the star batter's exit could have been managed more thoughtfully.Kohli, who made his Test debut against the West Indies in 2011, announced his retirement from the longest format ahead of the England tour. He finishes with 9,230 runs at an average of 46.85 from 123 Tests, including 30 centuries and 31 fifties, making him India’s fourth-highest run-scorer in the format.""Virat has announced his retirement from Test matches, which is sad, you know, because he's a great player. A great player. It's only when you go that people truly realise how big a player you were. Stats don’t do justice — it’s about the way he carried himself, especially as an ambassador for Test match cricket, particularly overseas. The way he played at Lord’s, and how his team turned things around — it was unreal. And I’m glad I was a part of it,"" Shastri said this while speaking on Sony Sports Network’s program ‘Bharat Tum Chale Chalo: Kahani 21-22 Ki’.""I feel sad that he's gone the way he has — suddenly. I think it could have been handled better, maybe with more communication. If I had anything to do with it, I would’ve made him captain straight after Australia,"" he added.Kohli remains India’s most successful Test captain, having led the team to 40 wins in 68 matches. His tenure was defined by a strong pace attack, a commitment to fitness, and a combative brand of cricket that made India a dominant force across conditions.","Virat Kohli retires from Test cricket after 14 years as a player.

Poll Was it the right decision for Australia to promote Labuschagne to open the innings? Yes, it was a good strategy No, it was a poor choice

Bold prediction! Astrologer Greenstone Lobo picks winner of Australia vs South Africa WTC Final 2025





NEW DELHI: Australia’s premier batter Marnus Labuschagne once again faltered against a left-arm pacer, with his vulnerability laid bare in the World Test Championship final against South Africa at Lord's.Labuschagne, who was promoted to open the innings for the first time in his Test career by skipper Pat Cummins for the high-stakes encounter, failed to make an impact.He was dismissed for 17 by South Africa’s left-arm seamer Marco Jansen, who bowled from around the wicket and delivered a good length ball. Labuschagne, with tentative footwork, attempted a defensive prod but only managed to edge it to the wicketkeeper.Since 2022, Labuschagne has struggled notably against left-arm pace in the longest format. In that period, he has faced 271 balls from left-arm quicks, scoring just 104 runs and getting out six times — with half of those dismissals coming to deliveries bowled from both over and around the wicket.Earlier, South Africa captain Temba Bavuma won the toss and opted to bowl first in conditions that were expected to favour the fast bowlers.""We'll have a bowl first,"" said Bavuma at the toss. ""The surface looks a good one, with solid overhead conditions.""I'm happy. It's too late now for anything else. We've selected the best team for the conditions.""""It's (a) massive (occasion). I think all of us have some sort of allegiance to Lord's. It should be a spectacle of a game.""Australia captain Pat Cummins was unfazed by being put in to bat.""There's a few clouds but that's not unusual for England,"" he said. ""It's dry and might turn later in the match.""I don't think there's any extra pressure (as defending champions). We've been here before and won it. This week is about enjoying it.""",Marnus Labuschagne dismissed for 17 by South Africa's Marco Jansen. He was promoted to open the innings for the first time in his Test career.

Goldberg's final wrestling match will take place in WWE



“Goldberg is reportedly planned to return next week on Monday Night Raw.”

“Everyone was speculating that Seth Rollins was gonna do something with his briefcase, or that Goldberg was gonna show up to finally kick my ass.

n reality, when I was world champion the first time, all those big names stayed away from me—and for good reason.”





Goldberg's return for his final showdown might be coming sooner than expected.Goldberg is one of the most dominant names in professional wrestling. The WCW legend is set to put his in-ring career to an end in 2025 with a retirement match. While it was speculated to happen months ago, it did not take place due to some minor injury issues. However, with Goldberg recovering and knowing the date of his final match, the seeds could be planted for his feud in the coming week on Monday Night RAW.According to BodySlam.net’s Viper, Goldberg will be making his return to WWE on the upcoming edition of Monday Night RAW, taking place at the Resch Center in Green Bay, Wisconsin. He said,The WWE Hall of Famer made his first appearance for the Stamford-based promotion last year at the WWE Bad Blood Premium Live Event after a lengthy absence. He was sitting in the crowd and was called out by The Ring General, Gunther, and it led to the two superheavyweights almost coming to blows before WWE officials intervened.Since then, it has been highly rumored that Goldberg's final opponent will be Gunther. His final match was supposed to happen earlier; however, he was recovering from a stem cell procedure.Recently on the Car Cast podcast, the former WWE Universal Champion revealed that he was aware of the date of his retirement showdown.With this new update, speculation about Goldberg vs. Gunther has been further fueled. The former WCW superstar returning a week after Gunther defeated Jey Uso to win the World Heavyweight Championship could be a sign for their feud. Moreover, Gunther even namedropped post his title win on the Raw Recap show, saying,Should Goldberg make his comeback on RAW next week, it will be interesting to see if Gunther is indeed his final foe heading into his retirement match.Also read: From obsession to danger: 5 worst WWE superstar stalker incidents","Goldberg is set to put his in-ring career to an end in 2025 with a retirement match.

'Nitish Kumar is a guy who can bowl that magic ball': India bowling coach Morne Morkel





The opening day of the World Test Championship (WTC) Final between South Africa and Australia at Lord’s delivered high drama, exceptional bowling, and a historic statistical anomaly. Kagiso Rabada stole the show with a brilliant five-wicket haul, helping South Africa bowl out Australia for just 212. Marco Jansen provided strong support with three wickets.But Australia fought back hard in the final session. Mitchell Starc led their charge with two wickets, while Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood chipped in with one each to leave South Africa struggling at 43 for 4 at stumps.Day 1 also produced a bizarre moment never seen in 145 years of Test cricket in England. For the first time in 561 Tests on English soil, both teams' No. 1 batters were dismissed for zero in the first innings. Australia’s Usman Khawaja and South Africa’s Aiden Markram were the unfortunate pair.Rabada’s spell of 5 for 51 in 15.4 overs not only swung momentum in South Africa’s favour but also elevated his place in the history books. The 30-year-old overtook Allan Donald’s tally of 330 Test wickets, reaching 332 in 71 matches, becoming South Africa’s fourth-highest wicket-taker in the format.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Rabada became just the second bowler after Kyle Jamieson (2021 final vs India) to take a five-for in a WTC Final. He’s also the only South African after Jacques Kallis (1998 ICC Knockout Trophy final) to do so in an ICC tournament final.With 11 wickets in five ICC knockout matches at an average of 19.27, Rabada now sits third among South African wicket-takers in such games, tied with Shaun Pollock and Allan Donald, and behind Jacques Kallis (14).",South Africa bowled out Australia for just 212 on opening day of World Test Championship (WTC) Final.

While one was growing up, one's mother often lamented that if one spent as much time poring over textbooks as one did perusing the collective works of Frederick Forsyth, one might have amounted to something worth writing about—instead of writing about worthless things. Tautologies, masquerading as jokes aside, Britain too has long mastered the art of making its hypocrisy sound like high wit.TakeThere’s a hilarious episode where Jim Hacker and Sir Humphrey Appleby team up to pressurise adirector into pulling an embarrassing interview. Theman initially refuses—until Sir Humphrey gently reminds him that failure to cooperate might result in budget cuts and, more scandalously, the loss of seats at Wimbledon and Royal Ascot. They all then solemnly agree that while themustn’t appear to give in to government pressure, they won’t air the interview due to “security implications.”The brilliance of the scene lies in how comfortable the British—for all their lack of tastebuds—are with poking fun at the very institutions they hold dear. A taxpayer-funded broadcaster that can satirise both the government and itself without missing a beat.But—as brilliant as it is—is perhaps only thesecond greatest contribution to the literary arts.The top spot, without contest, belongs to a former Royal Air Force pilot with an eye for detail and a knack for turning geopolitical chaos into page-turning precision: Frederick Forsyth, who departed for Elysium on June 9.And here’s the kicker: Forsyth might never have become an author at all had it not been for the BBC.Fate—disguised as institutional cowardice—had to intervene so that he could stumble into his true dharma.The story goes that once his flying days were over, Forsyth joined, before moving on to the Beeb.However, disgusted bydenial of genocide – a custom in which the Albion has shown a lot of promise – during the Biafra War in Nigeria, Forsyth quit in disgust and started covering the war as a freelancer.However, freelancing, as every freelancer worth her salt will tell you, led to penury. Broke, and living on a friend’s sofa he wrote the first manuscript of the book that came to be known asostensibly within only 35 days.was initially rejected because it dealt with a rather sticky subject – the attempted murder of a very much alive Charles De Gaulle – not to mention that the cold, journalistic style of writing, lack of a traditional Herculean hero, overt detailing, and a plot whose ending was preordained.The rest as they say is history.sold over 10 million copies, become the inspiration for two movies, and a limited race-swapped limited series, but to reduce Forsyth’s legacy tois like calling Bob Dylan the poet who wrote Blowing in the Wind. It’s simply one arrow in a quiver full of masterpieces.Forsyth was a masterful storyteller, an author who brought a journalist’s eye-for-detail with a poet’s gift for storytelling without getting into the literary quagmire of a John Le Carre that could alienate those with more limited grasp of the King’s.In fact, today, it’s almost hard to explain to a generation that has grown up on C-Bag, Instagram reels or TikTok videos, the magic that Forsyth produced on his vintage Olympia typewriter (he used them till his death).His attention to detail was legendary and reading his novels wasn’t just a walk through a story but a tour through space-time, a history lesson more enthralling than anything in one’s textbook.Take one’s favouritewhere we move from The Battle of Britain to Vietnam to Milosevic’s Yugoslavia to an unnamed South American republic with dodgy leaders ending on the night of September 10, 2001 with a plot twist that would boggle your mind.In, we meet mercenaries with a plan that it’s almost a Cliff Notes on how to carry out aon an African nation. The fact that some mercenaries actually thought they were going to carry out an actual coup bears testimony to its hyperrealism.In, we see the future of Labour politics and Leftism in Britain which will ally with any force inimical to the Western order.In, Forsyth astutely predicts the rise of a Putin-like figure whose expansionist ways will become a threat to Europe if not stopped in time. Unfortunately, Forsyth’s protagonists only exist in the pages of novels whose effete real world versions pale in comparison. Today, as the world grapples with Putin trying to increase his sphere of influence, the book reads like a prophecy.Forsyth’s protagonists are a breed apart—neither the brooding intellectualism of Le Carré’s George Smiley nor the martini-drenched bravado of Ian Fleming’s James Bond. They are men of method, mission, and moral ambiguity—shaped more by bureaucracy and battlefield scars than by tuxedos or existential crises. Take Calvin Dexter, the tunnel rat turned avenger, who channels quiet rage into legal vigilantism, or Cat Shannon, a professional mercenary with a conscience honed in Africa’s cruel geopolitics. Jason Monk, ex-CIA and emotionally flayed by betrayal, stands at the cusp of East-West collapse in Icon.Then there’s Mike Martin, the SAS ghost who reappears across Forsyth’s work—first infiltrating Iraq in, then the Taliban inPaul Devereaux, the cold, calculating CIA man in, is the closest Forsyth comes to a Bond figure—minus the glamour, doubled on ruthlessness.Even the teenage hacker Luke Jennings inis a far cry from traditional spy fiction—a vulnerable savant weaponised by Adrian Weston, a spymaster who knows the game is rigged. They’re professionals in a bureaucratic wilderness, soldiers of shadow wars and moral compromise—proof that in Forsyth’s world, heroism is about precision, not panache.And inForsyth’s memoir is a debrief confirming the many things we already know and a few we didn’t like the fact that he did covert work for MI6, had a dalliance with an East Bloc spy and was part of back-channel talks to de-nuclearise post-Apartheid South Africa.Forsyth’s memoir is not a celebrity confessional—it’s a debrief. He writes of his time as a fighter pilot, his disillusionment with journalism during Biafra, and his covert work for MI6. He describes his writing method with the same precision as his fictional operatives.You finish the book understanding that Frederick Forsyth didn’t write thrillers. He lived them. Then redacted just enough to publish. And in that, Forsyth was a journalist through and through. And maybe reading his books was far more entertaining, if not useful, than reading one’s textbooks.","Forsyth was a masterful storyteller, an author who brought a journalist’s eye- for-detail with a poet's gift for storytelling without getting into the literary quagmire that could alienate those with more limited grasp of the King's King.

2025 highlights: Familiar faces and dramatic falls



Is it just madness or tradition





Every year on a steep hill in Gloucestershire, England, hundreds gather to chase a rolling 7-pound wheel of Double Gloucester cheese down a dangerously steep slope. Known as the Cooper’s Hill Cheese Rolling Contest, the event is chaotic, absurd, and completely thrilling. With participants tumbling, somersaulting, and crashing their way to the bottom, the headline “People sprint to catch a 7-pound wheel of cheese” is technically accurate, but it doesn’t quite capture the madness, tradition, and injuries that define this bizarre British spectacle. So, is it a good headline? That depends on what you’re hoping to convey.The Cheese Rolling Contest is an annual event held on Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth, Gloucestershire. Dating back at least two centuries, and possibly much longer, the race involves competitors hurtling down a 200-yard slope after a large wheel of cheese. The goal? Be the first to reach the bottom and claim the cheese as a prize. It sounds simple, but the event is notorious for its steep incline, dangerous tumbles, and frequent injuries.The hill is so steep that it's nearly impossible to stay upright. Most participants end up tumbling head over heels, colliding with each other or the ground.Gravity takes over quickly, and the cheese, reaching speeds of up to 70 mph, is almost never actually caught. Still, competitors willingly risk sprains, fractures, and concussions for a shot at glory and a round of cheese.This year, German YouTuber Tom Kopke claimed victory for the second year in a row. Shirtless and triumphant, he declared, “I risked my life for this. It’s my cheese. Back to back.” On the women’s side, Ava Sender Logan from London tumbled repeatedly but emerged victorious, saying, “It felt quite long coming down and then I hit my head. I’m fine.” Around them, spectators packed the woods and fences for a glimpse of the chaos.While the event may seem absurd to outsiders, for locals and returning participants, it’s a point of pride and cultural identity. Despite calls to regulate or cancel it over safety concerns, the contest continues to thrive, drawing international competitors and media attention. Volunteers, medics, and long-time residents treat it as an important local tradition","The Cheese Rolling Contest is an annual event held on Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth, Gloucestershire.

Trump sees opportunity in sport

Mexican fans uncertain on match travel

Canada, Mexico more able to stand up against Trump





A year out from the World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico, host city Los Angeles is engulfed in protests related to the deportation of Mexicans and other minorities. Meanwhile, an ever-shifting trade war threatens relations between the three hosts and a travel ban will likely prevent some fans from attending.While the whims of US President Donald Trump make predictions perilous, fans, players and national teams must already start to make plans for one of sport's biggest events, one secured in Trump's first term when relations between the three countries were much more harmonious.The ongoing protests are an immediate safety concern for the Club World Cup in the US, with European champions Paris Saint-Germain set to meet Atletico Madrid in LA on the tournament's opening day on June 15. LA will also host the first US game of the 2026 World Cup on June 12, a day after the tournament opens in Mexico.Trump's travel ban, which came in to effect on Monday, bars citizens of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen from entering the US. An exception was made for ""any athlete or member of an athletic team, including coaches, persons performing a necessary support role, and immediate relatives, traveling for the World Cup, Olympics, or other major sporting event as determined by the secretary of state"" but not for fans.Iran have already qualified for the World Cup, but currently fans would not be able to travel to support them in the US.The same is not yet true for citizens of Mexico and Canada. And for Andrew Zimbalist, professor emeritus in economics at Smith College in the US state of Massachusetts and author of ""Circus Maximus: The Economic Gamble Behind Hosting the Olympics and the World Cup,"" putting on a good show to burnish his own reputation is likely to be at the forefront of Trump's mind.""Mr. Trump has shown a willingness to make exceptions when there's pressure. And I think further that Trump cares. He's a sports fan. He cares about his international image. He cares about the attention that that will come to him when both the Club World Cup in 2025 and the real World Cup in 2026 happen. These are photo opportunities for Trump to bask in in the game's glory,"" he told DW, speaking ahead of the LA protests.Zimbalist added that with Trump, things can always change quickly.""There's a tremendous amount of tension and a tremendous amount of uncertainty about how Mr. Trump will behave, and we never know.""World Cup co-hosts Canada and Mexico were, along with China, the first countries targeted in the evolving tariff war that began soon after Trump took office. Zimbalist doesn't predict the uneasiness at the government level will have a significant impact on the tournament, arguing that there will be enough fans prepared to travel for games that any discouraged from doing so will not be noticeable. He also believes that the relatively new leaders in Mexico — Claudia Sheinbaum, elected in October 2024 — and Canada — Mark Carney, elected in March — will not allow their countries to become marginalized.""I think both with Carney in Canada and Sheinbaum in Mexico, that he has met his real enemy. These leaders are not bowing down to him, and they're both very, very smart, very well prepared, and at the moment, are popular in their countries. And so they have the latitude to take on Trump,"" said Zimbalist.Nevertheless, for Mexican fans in particular, traveling across the border to World Cup, or indeed Club World Cup games this month, in the US is a fraught business.""I don't feel afraid to go to the United States but it feels little bit like going to someone else's house where you are not welcome,"" said Alan, a Pachuca fan talking to DW ahead of his team's participation in the Club World Cup.Other Pachuca fans complained that significant visa processing delays, some up to two years, meant they would have been unable to travel to support their team even without the current safety concerns.""Appointments were delayed and then the president said that some Mexicans shouldn't go there, I think that has a big influence on why they're taking so long with the visas,"" said Axel.""I would feel a little unsafe around the police and everything government-related and that side of the United States.""While demand for, and interest in, the World Cup will be on a different level to the revamped Club World Cup, which has proved controversial in some quarters, and stands may see some foreign nationals from Canada and Mexico, it does seem like political relations will have some impact on fans — even if the stands will be full.While Canadians are not quite as central to the current events in LA, the US' northerly neighbours have been at loggerheads with the Trump administration. The US national anthem, ""The Star-Spangled Banner,"" has been booed at ice hockey games in Canada in recent months, and Carney's surprise election was partly ascribed to his willingness to take on Trump and his plan to make Canada the 51st state.""Having met with the owners of Canada over the course of the campaign in the last several months, it's not for sale. Won't be for sale, ever,"" Carney told Trump when the pair met in May in a meeting that was otherwise relatively cordial, despite clear tensions.For those hoping to plan a visit to, or participation in, the World Cup, judging the political mood — and the implications of changes in it — have become as important as waiting for results from qualifying.""I could see it happening along the way that if Sheinbaum becomes a little bit more aggressive than Trump wants her to be, or challenges some of Trump's immigration moves, that he would say: ""You know what? I might not let Mexico participate in the World Cup, or I might not let this happen or that happen.' So I can see threats like that, but I'd have to believe that they wouldn't be carried out,"" said Zimbalist, musing on what might play out in the next year.The Club World Cup, which starts Saturday and is hosted solely by the US, is perceived by some as a test of elements of the country's readiness to host the 026 World Cup. But any development or deterioration of relations between the three co-hosts will be critical to the success of next year's tournament.","World Cup co-hosts Canada and Mexico were, along with China, the first countries targeted in the evolving tariff war.

Rare Strawberry Moon and Lunar Standstill to Dazzle the Night Sky on June 10-11,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/rare-strawberry-moon-and-lunar-standstill-to-dazzle-the-night-sky-on-june-10-11/articleshow/121767967.cms,"Why it’s called the Strawberry Moon

What makes this year’s Moon special?

Best time and places to view





Stargazers across the United States are in for a visual treat as the annual ""strawberry moon"" graces the skies on the night of June 10.The Strawberry Moon isn’t pink, as the name suggests. This year’s phenomenon is special because it will coincide with a rare celestial event known as the Major Lunar Standstill, viewers won’t witness until 2043, according to the Weather Channel.The term ""strawberry moon"" dates back to Native American traditions, particularly those of the Algonquin tribes, who named the June full moon after the short harvesting season of wild strawberries in the north eastern United States. The name gained wider recognition in the 1930s through the Maine Farmer’s Almanac, which popularised various Native American lunar names, according to Newsweek.While the moon is unlikely to appear pink, it might adopt a soft orange tint during moonrise or moonset due to atmospheric scattering.This year’s event aligns with a major lunar standstill, a phenomenon in the moon’s 18.6-year cycle where it reaches its most extreme northern or southern point in the sky.This causes the full moon to rise and set at its lowest point on the horizon, offering a rare visual spectacle for night-sky enthusiasts.The strawberry moon will rise in the south eastern sky around dusk on Tuesday, June 10, and reach full illumination at 3:44 am. EST on June 11. The moon will appear opposite the sunrise and remain visible until dawn.For the best viewing experience, experts recommend heading to areas with minimal light pollution, such as rural regions, elevated locations, and open fields or waterfronts. Urban dwellers can try local parks or terraces with a clear eastern view.","The annual ""strawberry moon"" graces the skies on the night of June 10.

Viral video triggers criticism, but George Kittle calls it overblown



49ers’ unity evident amid offseason speculation





As the NFL offseason continues, a single route run by San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Deebo Samuel during minicamp has sparked widespread reaction online. A video showing Samuel’s seemingly slow movement during a drill quickly went viral, triggering criticism from fans and analysts. However, tight end George Kittle has publicly come to his teammate’s defence, calling the scrutiny unwarranted.The video, circulated by popular NFL pages on social media, led to questions about Samuel’s fitness and commitment—particularly with trade rumors surrounding the 28-year-old wideout.However, Kittle addressed the issue on the Sports Seriously podcast, stating that Samuel remains one of the league’s most unique and versatile threats. Kittle highlighted Samuel’s proven ability to play multiple roles across the offense and his unmatched yards-after-catch skills. “Debo is one of the most unique players in the NFL. He's one of the best guys with the ball in his hands,” he said, adding that isolated practice clips don’t reflect his actual game performance.While speculation linking Samuel to teams like the Patriots and Steelers continues to grow, Kittle’s comments reflect the internal support the wide receiver still commands.Despite some ambiguity in Samuel’s recent social media activity, the locker room stands firmly behind him.The episode also points to a broader trend—where offseason footage is often overanalyzed without context.
