“It's a fad”: Former NFL star Brett Favre expresses fear and concern for his future following his Parkinson's diagnosis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/its-a-fad-former-nfl-star-brett-favre-expresses-fear-and-concern-for-his-future-following-his-parkinsons-diagnosis/articleshow/117329159.cms,"Image via Getty Images

Brett Favre’s tough playing style results in ongoing health struggles

Brett Favre, the former NFL quarterback, has shared concerns about his health after being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement. He is also worried about the long-term effects of his football career, particularly regarding Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), a brain condition linked to repeated head injuries.Brett Favre, known for his bold playing style in the NFL, is now facing health challenges in retirement. His tendency to hold onto the ball and take hits helped him make key plays but may have contributed to the issues he's dealing with now.In a recent interview, 55-year-old Brett Favre, the Hall of Fame quarterback for the Green Bay Packers, shared the details of his Parkinson’s disease diagnosis. He had initially revealed this diagnosis during a congressional hearing on welfare reform in September 2024, making it a public matter. ""I have to admit, I thought the world was caving in on me. It was the end of the world,"" Favre told TMZ. ""I can't believe this, not me. I'm healthy, I'm very active, it doesn't happen to me.""Brett Favre has shared the intense fear that came with his Parkinson's disease diagnosis, stating in his interview, ""There's always the fear of what happens next... what's the next step?"" The ambiguity surrounding his condition has understandably caused distress as he faces the possible advancement of the disease, which can significantly affect his mobility, mental abilities, and overall well-being.Favre's fears have been further worsened by recent events in sports, especially the revelation that former NFL player Frank Wycheck had Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) at the time of his death. CTE, a brain disorder linked to repeated head injuries, has raised concerns among former players as the lasting effects of concussions become clearer.Wycheck’s case increased awareness of how repeated brain trauma can lead to serious cognitive and mental issues, deepening Favre's worries about the potential for CTE, along with his Parkinson’s diagnosis. ""It makes me wonder what the future brings for me,"" Favre said. ""I've already been diagnosed with Parkinson's. I often wonder-and I try not to, but I can't help it-what the future holds.""""I would think that every player that dies from here on out, if they have their brain tested, I'd say a high percentage would have CTE,"" Favre added. ""We're just really scraping the surface of how damaging head trauma can be.I think people now take it seriously, but there is still that 'Ah, you know' attitude, almost like it's a fad, but we know it's not.""Also Read: LSU QB Colin Hurley Hospitalized After Car Crash, Family Shares Positive Health Update Favre's candidness about his difficulties emphasizes the obstacles many retired athletes encounter as they grow older, dealing with both the physical and psychological impacts of their careers.","Brett Favre, the former NFL quarterback, has shared concerns about his health after being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.

Rinku a rare instance of cricketer marrying an active politician

Dubai International Stadium tour: India's base for Champions Trophy glory

VARANASI: T20 star Rinku Singh 's match has almost been fixed. The 27-year-old cricketer's family is in advanced talks for a matrimonial alliance between him and Priya Saroj , Samajwadi Party MP from UP's Machhlishahr, a reserved constituency.Saroj, 26, is the youngest woman MP in the present Lok Sabha. Her father, Tufani Saroj , a three-time LS MP who now represents Kerakat assembly seat (reserved) in the UP Vidhan Sabha, confirmed the development on Saturday.""Initial talks with Rinku Singh's family ended on a positive note and decisions on engagement and wedding dates will be decided after Priya and Rinku sit together following the forthcoming parliamentary session and T20I series (against England),"" he said.Tufani Saroj, who was in Aligarh on Thursday for discussions with Rinku's father, added, ""The father of one of Priya's friends was a cricketer. Rinku and Priya met through him. They have known each other for some time, and indicated that they would marry if their families consented.""Social media was abuzz with talk about Rinku and Priya's engagement on Friday, although both families made no comment on the issue. On Saturday, however, Tufani Saroj not only confirmed it but added that further talks would take place after the next parliamentary session ends on Feb 13. Since Rinku is busy too, with the series against England starting Jan 22, both families decided that plans would be finalised only when the two have time.While cricket and Bollywood have seen several matches, Rinku's would be a rare case of a cricketer marrying an active politician. Allrounder Ravindra Jadeja 's wife, Rivaba Solanki, is an MLA from Jamnagar (North). However, she joined BJP only in 2019, three years after her marriage, and was elected to the Gujarat assembly in 2022. While Rivaba has been frequently spotted cheering for Team India in stadiums, Jadeja had campaigned for her in the 2022 polls.Rinku represented UP in the under-16, under-19 and under-23 levels and piled up 953 runs in 10 Ranji Trophy matches in 2018–19. He shot into the limelight in April 2023 by hitting five sixes in the final over of a match against Gujarat Titans to help his team, Kolkata Knight Riders, successfully chase down 29 runs — the highest-ever chase in the last over in IPL's history. Incidentally, Rinku is considered to be a strong candidate for KKR's captaincy this year.Rinku's rise from humble origins to stardom has been hailed as one of the feel-good stories of Indian sports. He also had an impressive start to his international career. In Jan 2024, he and Rohit Sharma posted an unbeaten 190-run partnership, a world record for the 5th wicket in T20I. Rinku was also a reserve player in India's squad for the 2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup tournament. Priya Saroj had a sensational entry into politics by winning an LS election on an SP ticket at the age of 25.","Rinku Singh's family is in advanced talks for a matrimonial alliance with Priya Saroj.

India's squad for ICC Champions Trophy & England ODIs



NEW DELHI: India’s squad for the ICC Champions Trophy , scheduled to begin on February 19 in Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates, and for three-match ODI series against England was announced on Saturday.One of the major debating points was the omission of right-arm seamer Mohammed Siraj . Despite being a regular in India’s recent campaigns, Siraj has been left out of the 15-member squad, which includes Yashasvi Jaiswal earning his maiden ODI call-up.Captain Rohit Sharma explained the decision, citing the team’s need for specific skill sets in the bowling department.""We only wanted three seamers. It’s unfortunate that Siraj has to miss out. His effectiveness comes down when he’s not bowling with the new ball. We prioritised bowlers who can deliver with the new ball, be effective in the middle overs, and at the back end. With Jasprit Bumrah Mohammed Shami and Arshdeep Singh , we believe we have the right balance,"" Rohit said, in a presser to announce the squad in Mumbai.Adding to the intrigue, chief selector Ajit Agarkar revealed uncertainty around Jasprit Bumrah’s fitness, with the pacer potentially unavailable for the first two ODIs of the preceding England series. Harshit Rana has been named as a temporary replacement.""We’re awaiting updates on Jasprit Bumrah’s fitness from the BCCI medical team, expected in early February,"" Agarkar stated.Rohit reiterated the selection focus on versatility: ""With Bumrah’s status unclear, we needed bowlers who can perform across phases. Unfortunately, Siraj is more dependent on the new ball, which limits our options.""Siraj’s exclusion, alongside that of Sanju Samson, has raised eyebrows among fans and analysts, given Siraj’s consistent performances for India. The decision underscores India’s intent to focus on specific roles as they aim for success in the upcoming Champions Trophy.Rohit Sharma (C), Shubman Gill (VC), Yashasvi Jaiswal, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, Rishabh Pant (wk), KL Rahul (wk), Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Ravindra Jadeja, Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Shami, Arshdeep Singh* Harshit Rana has been chosen for the ODI series against England, with Bumrah's fitness concerns in mind.","Mohammed Siraj left out of India's squad for the ICC Champions Trophy.

Theare going up against the Detroit Pistons on January 18, 2025, but they’ll have to do so without one of their biggest stars,. The All-Star forward has been ruled out due to a lingering illness, leaving the Suns with a significant gap in their lineup as they fight to maintain momentum in a tightly contested season.Kevin Durant’s absence comes at a crucial juncture for the Phoenix Suns, who currently stand at 20-20 and are battling to stay competitive in the Western Conference. Durant has been a linchpin for the team, averaging 23.9 points, 5.3 rebounds, and 4.3 assists over his last 20 games. His ability to impact both ends of the court makes his unavailability a tough pill to swallow for the Suns, especially as they face a Pistons squad that sits just ahead of them at 21-20 in the standings. Kevin Durant ’s illness is the latest in a string of challenges for the Phoenix Suns, who are also monitoring the status of guard Bradley Beal. Beal, averaging 14.9 points and 2.8 assists this season, is listed as questionable due to an ankle issue. With Jusuf Nurkic already ruled out due to illness, the Suns’ depth will be tested once again.The Phoenix Suns have struggled to find consistency this season, with a -51 scoring differential reflecting their difficulties on defense. Allowing 114.2 points per game while scoring 112.9, they’ll need strong performances from Devin Booker, Tyus Jones, and other role players to compensate for Kevin Durant’s absence. Booker, who averages 19.7 points and 5.4 assists, has been their most reliable offensive weapon in recent weeks.Meanwhile, the Pistons face their own setback with standout guard Jaden Ivey sidelined by a leg injury.

The Golden State Warriors star Draymond Green has recently shared surprising comments about playing alongside Dennis Schroder. Green candidly praised Schroder's skills and adaptability pointing out the German guard’s playing style. Schroder has been in the spotlight due to his recent performances, but Green believes he has a lot to show, and his chemistry with his teammates has been commendable. Certainly, the Warriors are on a tough road as the team is attempting to reshuffle its roster with a game plan to revive its dominance.In a recent episode of The Draymond Green Show with Baron Davis, the Golden State Warriors star Draymond Green has showered praise for his teammate Dennis Schroder . “Man, I love playing with Dennis on our team,” Green said. The Warriors star player added that Schroder’s contribution to the team has been remarkable, “He brings a feistiness that we need at the guard spot. He brings a demeanor that we need, an alpha male that doesn’t hurt anyone.”Schroder has been in his A-game recently. During the Warriors' 121-113 win against the Memphis Grizzlies on January 4 at Chase Center, Schroder put his remarkable leadership skill on display.“[Schroder] said to me the other day in the Memphis game — I haven’t had a teammate say anything like that to me in years — he’s like, ‘Yo, yeah, keep talking to them. We at these boys. They ain’t cut like that.’ And I’m like, ‘You’re right, absolutely,’ ” Green continued. He’s like, ‘But you’re talking to the refs too much. Talk to the Grizzlies. We’re talking to them, get off [those] refs,’” he added.The 34-year-old went on to add, “And I came back in the second half locked in. After the game, I hit [Schröder] and said, ‘Yo, I appreciate you saying that to me because it locked me in on what I needed to be locked in on. I’ll be honest with you, not many people would say that to me; I’m thankful for that.’”Schroder is currently averaging 15.2 points per game this season, 2.6 rebounds, and 5.1 assists.As for Green, he missed time recently due to a back injury and illness. His absence has certainly impacted on the Warriors' performance. During his absence, Golden State went 1-2, including a frustrating loss to the Raptors and a thrilling win over the Timberwolves.

D’Angelo Russell has found his groove in Los Angeles, both on and off the court. As the former Lakers point guard joined the Brooklyn Nets following a trade, a lesser-known aspect of his time in LA has come to light. It was his subtle yet meaningful influence on rising star Austin Reaves . While Russell has changed his team after the trade, his influence on Reeves will be remembered by many, especially both the NBA star. Russell returned to the Crypto.com Arena but this time he was not in the Lakers jersey as he was in the rival team that faced a narrow defeat.The LA Lakers star Austin Reaves avoided a tough home-court defeat. While the Lakers secured a narrow win, Reaves credited D’Angelo Russell for his past guidance. The atmosphere at Crypto.com Arena was electric, unlike a typical regular-season game.Russell delivered a standout performance against his former team. He added 19 points, 8 assists, and 6 rebounds off the bench. Despite facing the loss, Russell’s gameplay sparked a response from LeBron James and Reaves. The former Laker nearly stole the win with a buzzer-beater attempt but faced defeat with just a shortage of 1 point as James and co. defended the home court with a 102-101 win over the Nets.“Man, it looked good. Not good for us, but the ball looked good in the air,” Reaves acknowledged Russell’s final shot in the game. “I’ve seen him make that shot a million times… fortunately it didn’t go,” he added during the post-game press talk.Reaves also acknowledged Russell’s role in helping him grow as a player and leader.The 28-year-old point guard holds years of experience and he did not hesitate to share valuable guidance to Reaves when he needed it most.“DLo really helped me with that when he got here… being drafted here being a young player he seen everything that you know I had been through where I was going through so when he got here he really taught me how to… grow and be better so I feel like that’s the main thing is just really you know continuing to grow as a leader,” Reaves said of Russell.Russell’s past in the Lakers’ locker room was not always smooth as he had to hit several bumps on the road. His first run began as a rookie, but it ended abruptly after just two seasons. During that time, an off-court incident with Nick Young created tension, straining his relationships with teammates. Despite his apology, reports suggested his peers kept their distance which led to isolation within the team.Also Read: D’Angelo Russell gushes over girlfriend Laura Ivaniukas' beach shoot on Instagram: “How could I complain?” Russell’s second stint wasn’t any easier.

"NBA HOFer Scottie Pippen criticizes LeBron James and Michael Jordan, dismisses GOAT debate in team sports: ""Neither of them are...""",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/nba-hofer-scottie-pippen-criticizes-lebron-james-and-michael-jordan-dismisses-goat-debate-in-team-sports-neither-of-them-are-/articleshow/117361888.cms,"Michael Jordan (left) and Scottie Pippen (right) (Image via LAPRESSE).

""I don’t think it exists in team sports.""

""When you ask who’s better, LeBron or Michael, you can’t ask me who’s the GOAT between LeBron and Michael. Neither one of them are GOATs; they both won differently, you can’t put them at the pinnacle,""

“And there’s no comparison to [LeBron],”

“None. So does that make him the greatest player to ever play the game? I’ll leave that up for debate because I don’t believe there’s a great player because our game’s a team game, and one player can’t do it.”

“There has been no one in the sport like 'Dr. J' ever since. Sorry, MJ (Michael Jordan). Sorry, Magic (Johnson). Sorry, LeBron (James).”

""Magic Johnson is closer to the Greatest of All Time than any other player,""

Scottie Pippen , a six-time NBA champion and Hall of Famer, has once again taken center stage in the basketball world with his views on the ever-popular ""Greatest of All Time"" (GOAT) debate. This time, Pippen made it clear that he doesn’t believe there is such a thing as a GOAT in team sports like basketball, a statement that challenges the ongoing conversations surrounding NBA legends such as Michael Jordan and LeBron James In a recent appearance on the ""PBD Podcast,"" Scottie Pippen asserted,He went on to explain why he feels the GOAT title is irrelevant in basketball, stressing that individual accomplishments cannot define greatness in a team-oriented game.Pippen said.For Scottie Pippen, the notion of greatness in basketball is rooted in teamwork, not individual feats. While both Michael Jordan and LeBron James are widely considered among the greatest to ever play, Pippen believes that no single player can fully capture the essence of a sport that relies so heavily on collaboration and support.Pippen continued.Scottie Pippen's comments come as part of his long-standing stance on the GOAT conversation, which he has addressed multiple times over the years. His perspective has evolved, with the basketball icon giving different answers when asked who holds the title of the GOAT. In 2023, during an appearance on the ""Gimme The Hot Sauce"" podcast, Pippen suggested that Julius Erving, also known as Dr. J, might deserve the GOAT title more than anyone. In his book ""Unguarded,"" Pippen further expressed his admiration for Erving, stating,Pippen's argument for Erving is rooted in his belief that Dr. J's influence on the game was unparalleled. However, while Erving holds a special place in Pippen's heart, the overall message is clear: Pippen believes the focus should shift from individual accolades to the collective achievements of teams. He has also made it clear that he doesn't believe there is any player who transcends the team aspect of the game to deserve the title of the GOAT.Another player who Scottie Pippen believes has a stronger claim to being the GOAT is Magic Johnson, particularly due to his leadership and the way he revolutionized the game during his career.Pippen stated, pointing to Johnson’s ability to lead his team to success, notably during his rookie year when he filled in as the starting center for the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA Finals when Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was injured.Also read: Today in LA Lakers History (Jan. 18): Jerry West's iconic buzzer-beater at the 1972 NBA All-Star Game In the end, Scottie Pippen’s stance on the GOAT debate serves as a reminder of the importance of teamwork in basketball and raises questions about how greatness should truly be measured in team sports.","Scottie Pippen believes there is no such thing as a ""Greatest of All Time"" in team sports like basketball. The six-time NBA champion also believes Magic Johnson is closer to being the GOAT than any other player. Pipper's comments come as part of his long-standing stance on the GOat conversation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117361893,imgsize-63578,width-400,resizemode-4/117361893.jpg"

Griezmann blows penalty

Barcelona were held to a 1-1 draw by Getafe in La Liga on Saturday, failing to make up ground on the top two teams in the Spanish title race.Jules Kounde gave Barcelona an early lead, but Mauro Arambarri equalised for Getafe in the first half, and the Catalans were unable to break down Jose Bordalas' well-organised team.The draw leaves Barcelona in third place, five points behind league leaders Atletico Madrid, who suffered a 1-0 defeat at Leganes earlier in the day.Despite winning the Spanish Super Cup last week and thrashing Real Betis in the Copa del Rey, suggesting a return to form after a slump in late 2024, Barcelona dropped two points on the road in their first league match of 2025 against 16th-placed Getafe.""It's not done yet, we still have some matches to play and as I said before, we will fight until the end,"" Flick told reporters.""Today it's one point more, not two points less. We missed (out on) two points, but we have to look forwards and make it better next time.""Flick fielded his strongest side in recent weeks, hoping to secure a result at Getafe, where Barcelona had failed to score in their previous four away visits.The Blaugrana ended that streak in the ninth minute when Kounde, who also scored in the midweek Copa del Rey win against Real Betis, was cleverly set up by Pedri and scored on the rebound after David Soria saved his initial effort.However, Barcelona faced the same difficulties they have often encountered at the Coliseum, with Getafe digging in and denying top scorer Robert Lewandowski any space.Getafe equalized in the 34th minute when Coba's shot was parried by Barcelona goalkeeper Inaki Pena, and Arambarri pounced to score.The hosts maintained their tight defensive setup in the second half, making life difficult for Barcelona.Raphinha missed a golden opportunity to win the game for Barca in the closing minutes, hitting the side netting from close range after being found by Lamine Yamal's cross.""It was a shame, the match, we had control of the game and with one chance they scored one goal against us, it's a shame,"" Kounde told Movistar.After the match, Barcelona defender Alejandro Balde reported being subjected to racist abuse from some home supporters during the first half.On Sunday, Spanish and European champions Real Madrid, currently second in La Liga, host Las Palmas with the aim of moving to the top of the table.In another surprise result, league leaders Atletico Madrid suffered a shock defeat at Leganes, ending their club record run of 15 consecutive victories.Matija Nastasic headed Leganes in front early in the second half, and Antoine Griezmann missed a late penalty, dragging his effort wide, as Atletico fell to their second league defeat of the season.""I thought we were low on energy, it wasn't enough from us,"" Atletico goalkeeper Jan Oblak told DAZN.""We'll keep our head up after (winning) 15 games, we lost this one and we have to keep going forwards... unfortunately the streak is over.""Leganes, 15th in the table, defended well to keep Atletico at bay in the first half, with Julian Alvarez and Griezmann hitting the woodwork.Nastasic's header from a corner put Leganes ahead early in the second half, and they protected their lead without much trouble until controversially conceding a penalty for a debatable handball by Sergio Gonzalez.Griezmann took responsibility from the spot but rolled his 90th-minute effort wide of the goal.Atletico must now regroup in the Champions League, where they aim to reach the knockout rounds, as they face Bayer Leverkusen on Tuesday.""They were 15 extraordinary games, I feel enormously proud at having set the (consecutive) winning record in Atletico's history,"" Atletico coach Diego Simeone told DAZN.""We have to accept that defeat is part of the game and prepare ourselves for Tuesday.""","Barcelona held to a 1-1 draw by Getafe in La Liga on Saturday. Jules Kounde gave Barcelona an early lead, but Mauro Arambarri equalised. Barcelona in third place, five points behind league leaders Atletico Madrid.

Should Patrick Mahomes Face NFL Punishment After Controversial Flop Against Texans?

NFL Fans Slam Patrick Mahomes for Flop in Chiefs’ Win Over Texans



The Kansas City Chiefs , led by Patrick Mahomes , secured their seventh consecutive trip to the AFC Championship Game with a 23-14 victory over the Houston Texans on Saturday. While the win reinforced their dominance in the playoffs, it also stirred significant controversy over officiating, casting a shadow over the game. The Chiefs will now host the winner of Sunday night's matchup between the Baltimore Ravens and Buffalo Bills at Arrowhead Stadium.The game was not without its contentious moments, as Mahomes benefited from multiple roughing-the-passer calls that left fans and analysts divided. Early in the first quarter, the Chiefs quarterback was awarded a 15-yard penalty following a questionable call involving Texans defensive end Will Anderson Jr. A similar scenario happened in the third quarter when another roughing call went in Mahomes’ favor, raising eyebrows among viewers and prompting heated discussions on social media.Perhaps the most debated moment occurred in the fourth quarter when Mahomes, while running along the sideline, appeared to take a dive after being pushed. Though the officials refrained from penalizing the Texans this time, the incident added fuel to calls for the NFL to introduce penalties for ""flopping"" to discourage players from embellishing contact.“Bad roughing calls happen. But this lasting image right here is unbecoming of the guy who is supposed to be the face of the sport,” wrote analyst Brett Kollmann in a post on X. “The league has to make flopping a foul or guys will just keep doing it. It’s not fair to defenders that QBs can have their cake and eat it too.”Referee Clay Martin defended the controversial decisions during the postgame press conference. Addressing the call against Anderson, Martin cited ""forcible contact to the face mask area"" as justification for the penalty. Similarly, Martin explained the roughing call against Texans linebacker Henry To'oTo'o, stating, ""When [Mahomes] slides, he is considered defenseless. The onus is on the defender. I had forcible contact there to the hairline, to the helmet.""Despite the explanations, many questioned the legitimacy of the calls, arguing they unfairly tilted the game in favor of Kansas City.Also Read: ""Disgraceful"": Fox Faces Intense Criticism After Cutting National Anthem Broadcast Before Commanders-Lions Game Texans players and staff did not hold back their frustration. Will Anderson Jr., who had been at the center of one of the controversial calls, remarked, “We knew it was going to be us against the refs going into this game.” Head coach DeMeco Ryans echoed Anderson’s sentiments, stating, “We knew going into this game, it was us versus everybody… the naysayers, the doubt, everybody we had to go up against today.”Despite the loss, the Texans have much to reflect on after finishing the season atop the AFC South with a 10-7 record. However, their back-to-back exits in the divisional round highlight the challenges they face in taking the next step.","The Kansas City Chiefs secured their seventh consecutive trip to the AFC Championship Game with a 23-14 victory over the Houston Texans.

misses out

What does the horoscope of struggling Prithvi Shaw say?

MUMBAI: Jasprit Bumrah was on Saturday named in India's squad for the Champions Trophy in spite of the premier pacer being advised complete rest for the time being. There is hope Bumrah can recover from his back injury in time for the ICC tournament, while another ace fast bowler who has been out for long, Mohammed Shami, has been reintegrated into the national fold. The veteran pacer, who missed the entire Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia due a swollen knee, was also included in the 15-man squad for the ODI event, just days after he was recalled for the T20I series at home against England.Talented opener Yashasvi Jaiswal , as expected, has also received his maiden ODI call-up. The names were announced by selection committee chairman Ajit Agarkar at a media conference which was delayed by almost two hours due to a the selection committee meeting at the Wankhede Stadium here.The same squad will play England in a three-game ODI series at home in Feb, with Harshit Rana coming in as a back-up for Bumrah.Bumrah had suffered back spasms during the recent Sydney Test against Australia but the Agarkar-led panel is not ready to give up on him yet. Agarkar, however, made it clear that Bumrah will only be considered for selection from the third match of the ODI series against England, in Ahmedabad on Feb 12. ""We are waiting to hear about his (Bumrah's) fitness, so Harshit Rana will be part of the One-Day squad against England right now. At the moment, I don't think Bumrah is likely to be fit for the first couple of games,"" Agarkar said.In a huge vote of confidence in his abilities and in a sign of assurance that he will play in the XI ahead of Jaiswal, opener Shubman Gill has been appointed as the vice-captain of the squad. The batter endured a poor run in the Tests in Australia, scoring 93 runs in three Tests @18.60.Surprisingly, the selectors have dropped pacer Mohammed Siraj, who took 20 wickets in the five Tests @31.15 Down Under. Terming Siraj's exclusion as ""unfortunate"", Rohit justified it by saying that the pacer's reduced impact with the old ball influenced the call.""Siraj's effectiveness comes down a little bit if he's not going to take the new ball. We discussed it at length, and we are only taking three seamers there (CT) because we wanted all the allrounders. It's an unfortunate thing that he (Siraj) has to miss out, but we had no option but to get the guys who can perform a certain role,"" he said.It's clear that India now prefer left-arm pacer Arshdeep over Siraj in their white-ball team. Rohit said that he had faith in Arshdeep and the seasoned Shami when it came to the bowling duties in the tournament.""Obviously, with Bumrah missing, we're not sure. We wanted Arshdeep to come and play that role of bowling at the back end and Shami, obviously we saw what he did with the new ball (in the World Cup 2023 and during the recent domestic matches),"" he said.""Arshdeep hasn't played a lot of ODIs but he's been around the whiteball circuit for a long time. I don't feel so uncomfortable saying that he's not experienced. He has bowled some tough overs in white-ball cricket. I definitely think he can handle that pressure and Shami is a stalwart of white-ball cricket and what he did recently in the (ODI) World Cup was superb to watch,"" he added.Shami is returning to the ODI setup for the first time since the 2023 World Cup. Amidst concerns about his knee, the pacer has done well in domestic matches across formats for Bengal this season.The India captain also explained the rationale behind selecting Bumrah despite the pacer's dicey fitness status. ""We're not sure about Bumrah, whether he's going to play or not. We wanted to pick a squad where we have options of both, somebody to bowl with the new ball and somebody to bowl at the back end,"" said Rohit.Meanwhile, the rise and rise of Yashasvi Jaiswal continues. The 23-year-old Mumbaikar's initiation into India's ODI squad was a no-brainer after he was one of the few bright spots to emerge from the tour of Australia. Showering praise on the dashing left-hander, Rohit said, ""Sometimes, I know it's very hard to ignore numbers but look at Jaiswal. We picked Jaiswal based on clearly what he's shown in the last 6-8 months. He's not played a single ODI, but we still picked him because of the potential that he's got,"" he said.There was no place in the squad for Karun Nair, who scored upwards of 700 runs in the Vijay Hazare Trophy recently, prompting the likes of Sachin Tendulkar to make supportive statements on social media. Asked why the 33-year-old Vidarbha captain had been left out, chief selector Agarkar explained that it was not possible to include him in a squad of 15 in the current situation.""It is tough. Those are really special performances (by him). Someone who averages 700-plus, 750-plus. We did have a chat (about Karun),"" Agarkar said.""But at the moment, to find a spot in this Indian team is very difficult for him. Look at the guys who have been picked in the side. All average well in excess of mid-40s. Unfortunately, you can't fit everyone in. It's a squad of 15. But those performances (like Karun) certainly make you take notice,"" Agarkar added.",Jasprit Bumrah named in India's squad for the Champions Trophy.

Aryna Sabalenka remains on track to secure an unprecedented third straight Australian Open title after a dominant victory over teenage sensation Mirra Andreeva in the fourth round on Sunday.The Belarusian world No. 5 showcased her formidable power and precision, dispatching the 17-year-old Russian 6-1, 6-2 in a mere 62 minutes on Rod Laver Arena , extending her winning streak at Melbourne Park to 18 matches.""I'm super happy to get through this difficult match in straight sets,"" said Sabalenka, who will face either Croatian 18th seed Donna Vekic or 27th seed Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova from Russia next.""She's so young but always playing great tennis , it's always tough battles against her.""Sabalenka had faced some challenges in her previous matches, dropping serve multiple times against Clara Tauson in the third round before prevailing 7-6 (7/5), 6-4.However, she encountered no such difficulties in the warmer conditions against Andreeva, racing through her first two service games without dropping a point and securing an early break for a 4-1 lead.""Previous days were such tough conditions, the ball was so heavy,"" said Sabalenka. ""The ball was flying like a rocket. I hope conditions are going to be the same till the end of the tournament.""Andreeva struggled to cope with Sabalenka's intensity and found herself pushed further back as the champion executed a delicate drop shot winner to extend her lead to 5-1. A stunning backhand pass sealed the first set for Sabalenka in just 24 minutes.The second set began in similar fashion, with Sabalenka breaking early to establish a 3-1 advantage.Andreeva displayed a glimpse of her potential by saving two break points in the following game and creating three of her own, but Sabalenka held firm and closed out the match convincingly.Sabalenka is now on the verge of a remarkable three-peat at the Australian Open, a feat last achieved by Martina Hingis 26 years ago and only accomplished by four other women in tennis history: Margaret Court, Evonne Goolagong, Steffi Graf, and Monica Seles.","Aryna Sabalenka beats Mirra Andreeva 6-1, 6-2 in fourth round of Australian Open.

NEW DELHI: The start was brilliant, but the end sombre. India’s top men’s doubles pair of Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty began their semifinal encounter against world No. 2 pair Nur Izzuddin and Goh Sze Fei like they would sweep away the Malaysians. But it was not to be.The in-form Malaysians held their nerve and forced the Indian duo to commit one error after the other. Slowly but surely, Nur and Goh tightened the noose and emerged 21-18, 21-14 winners in just 37 minutes. Satwik and Chirag had also lost in the semis in the season-opener Malaysia Open Super 1000 tournament in Kuala Lumpur last week.The third-seeded Malaysians will now face Malaysia Open champions Kim Won Ho and Seo Seung Jae of South Korea in the final. The Koreans defeated fifth seeds Aaron Chia and Soh Wooi Yik of Malaysia 22-20, 21-19. The KD Jadhav Indoor Hall in the Indira Gandhi Stadium was packed to the brim in anticipation of another strong showing by Satwik and Chirag.The world No. 9 combination began strongly and waas in control of the opening game, leading 15-12 at one point. But Nur and Goh kept their cool and resorted to a pressing game as Satwik and Chirag kept repeating mistakes at the net.Nur and Goh clinched seven straight points from there on, as a smash error from Satwik handed the Malaysians the first game. In the second game, the Indians lost eight of the first 10 points before a series of five consecutive points brought them back in the match.However, Nur and Goh were quick in attacking the serve of the Indian pair and scored a few quick points.Thereafter, Sat-Chi could not make a comeback as the Malaysians sealed the match with a perfect ballooning serve to the backline.“I think we should have closed out the first game. But credit to them, they were really good in the service situations, which we didn’t really expect because probably we didn’t prepare for it. Having said that, we should have been a little calmer during tense situations,” Chirag said after the match.On Sunday, Paris Olympics champion An-Se Young of South Korea will play Thailand’s Pornpawee Chochuwong in the women’s singles final, while the French duo of Thom Gicquel and Delphine Delrue will aim for their first Super 750 title against China’s second seeds Jiang Zhen Bang and Wei Ya Xin.In the women’s doubles final, Kim Hye Jeong and Kong Hee Yong of South Korea will face Japan’s Arisa Igarashi and Ayako Sakuramoto.In the women’s singles semifinal, Chocuwong beat Japan’s Tomoka Miyazaki of Japan 11-21, 24-22, 21-19, while Young won 21-19, 21-16 against Indonesia’s Gregoria Mariska Tunjung.",Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty lose to Nur Izzuddin and Goh Sze Fei.

In 2020, Shareef transferred to LSU, following in his father’s footsteps.Shareef’s basketball career was riddled with a set of issues like health problems, keeping him out of the game for quite some time. Shareef came back in his games but again, he went undrafted in the 2022 NBA Draft. Thankfully, he went straight into the Lakers' summer league to play. Later, he was able to take part and play in the G League , after following his basketball dreams.Shaq’s move to the Los Angeles Lakers in 1996 remains one of the most talked-about trades in NBA history.

Champions Trophy Squad: Chief selector Ajit Agarkar and skipper Rohit Sharma PC

NEW DELHI: BCCI chief selector Ajit Agarkar and captain Rohit Sharma addressed the media in Mumbai on Saturday to announce India’s squad for the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 . Among the key talking points was the omission of wicketkeeper-batter Sanju Samson from the team.Samson last represented India in the T20I series against South Africa in November last year, where he delivered two remarkable centuries. His exceptional form had sparked calls for his inclusion alongside KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant as a wicketkeeping option.However, Samson's absence from the Vijay Hazare Trophy , India’s premier 50-over domestic tournament, may have played a role in his exclusion from the Champions Trophy squad.Kerala Cricket Association (KCA) president Jayesh George criticised Samson for his approach, revealing that the batter had informed the association of his unavailability with just a 'one-line text'.Speaking about Samson’s absence, George said, “I am not sure if Samson missing the tournament was the reason he was excluded. The reason he was not added in the Vijay Hazare squad was because he sent a one-line text saying he would not be available for the 30-member preparatory camp. We were all of the impression that he would be leading the team since he is our white-ball captain and had led in the SMAT season as well.”“So we went ahead and announced the squad and later he sent a message stating he is available for selection. Be it Sanju Samson or any other player, KCA has a policy in place that needs to be respected. We all know that Sanju does not need a camp to come into the squad, but is the Kerala team one that he can come and represent only when he feels like? How did Samson reach the Indian team? It was only through the KCA. That doesn’t mean you turn up only when you feel like for the Kerala team,” George told MediaOne.Meanwhile, Samson has been named in the squad for the upcoming five-match T20I series against England, starting February 22. He is one of two wicketkeepers in the squad, alongside Dhruv Jurel.The series opener is scheduled for Wednesday at Eden Gardens in Kolkata.The second T20I will take place on January 25 at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai, followed by the third on January 28 at Niranjan Shah Stadium in Rajkot.The fourth game will be held on January 31 at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium in Pune, with the fifth and final T20I slated for February 2 at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai.","Sanju Samson omitted from India's squad for ICC Champions Trophy 2025.

Champions Trophy Squad: Chief selector Ajit Agarkar and skipper Rohit Sharma PC

NEW DELHI: During a press conference in Mumbai on Saturday, India captain Rohit Sharma and men's selection committee chairman Ajit Agarkar announced the 15-member squad for the upcoming Champions Trophy . Prior to the start of the conference, cameras captured a private conversation between Rohit and Agarkar, which later went viral on social media.In the footage, Rohit can be heard discussing new guidelines with Agarkar, mentioning an upcoming meeting with the BCCI secretary. The conversation also highlighted players' concerns about the guidelines.[Now I will have to sit with the secretary to discuss family, family matters, everyone is telling me],"" Rohit was recorded saying to Agarkar in the viral video.A 10-point guideline was recently released following India's series defeat to Australia earlier this month.One of the key points of contention in the policy document is a return to the old system, where families are allowed to join players only for 14 days on long tours. Any deviation from this would require approval from coach Gambhir.When Rohit was asked about the new guidelines, he responded, ""Who told you about these rules? Has it come from the official handle of the BCCI? Let it come officially."" However, Agarkar confirmed that an SOP had indeed been drafted.Agarkar was asked why, just six months after winning the T20 World Cup with the same set of players, the BCCI felt the need to introduce a travel policy document. Agarkar, who was also part of the review committee that discussed the Australia debacle, said, ""We'll probably talk about it endlessly if we keep going on.""He continued, ""I suppose every team has some rules in place. We've spoken about various things you see over the last few months where you can improve as a team, where you can get a bit closer as a team. It's not a school. It's not a punishment,"" he explained, attempting to rationalize the decision.""It's just (that) you have some rules in place and when you're playing for the national team, you just follow those rules. Again, these are mature individuals. They are superstars in their own rights in international sport.""Many former players have described these rules as long-standing, with Agarkar calling them protocols that must be followed when representing the national team.","A 10-point guideline was recently released following India's series defeat to Australia earlier this month.

NEW DELHI: The wait is finally over. India men's senior selection committee chaired by Ajit Agarkar will pick India's provisional squad for the upcoming Champions Trophy tomorrow (January 18) in Mumbai and they are set to face a happy headache while doing the same. While top-order is more or less clear, they need to find the right pieces for the middle-order puzzle. There are plenty of players in the mix for those 3-4 positions but Shreyas Iyer remains a no-brainer for the middle-overs period.With the right mix of caution and aggression, he has aced the 50-over game in the past and had a stellar 2023 ODI World Cup where he amassed 530 runs in 11 innings. The runs came at a healthy strike-rate and he hit two hundreds and three half-centuries during India's campaign. The right-hander had a turbulent little period where he lost out on an annual contract but bounced back in emphatic fashion during the IPL where he led KKR to the title.There were three ordinary outings against Sri Lanka in the ODIs but he rediscovered the touch during the domestic season where he made substantial contributions, across formats, for Mumbai. 452 runs in five First Class innings were followed by 345 runs in Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and 325 runs in five List A fixtures. He has the weight of runs behind him but more importantly has the game suited for the surfaces in Dubai. With spin expected to play a major role in the tournament, Iyer has what it takes to control the middle period of the game like he did during the 2023 ODI World Cup.He has time and again reiterated that he is not fussy about batting positions and that flexibility will certainly come good. The England ODIs will definitely help coach Gautam Gambhir and captain Rohit Sharma to finalise composition of their middle-order, and it will make a lot of sense if it revolves around Iyer.Yes, there are plenty of right-handers in the middle-order mix at the moment but India do have some flexible left-handers in the lower-order who they can seamlessly move around as per the match situation. Those movements were on display during the three ODIs vs Sri Lanka and it could well continue in the upcoming ODI assignments.Axar Patel or Ravindra Jadeja? Or both?India picked both the left-arm spin all-rounders for the T20 World Cup but only Axar played the Sri Lanka ODIs as Jadeja was rested. The selectors now need to take that tough call because Axar did exceedingly well in the T20 World Cup and looked good in the ODIs vs Sri Lanka too. Jadeja, on the other hand, last played an ODI back in November 2023.It now remains to be seen whether the management moves on from Jadeja or carries both. It will be very difficult to ignore Axar because he lends a lot of balance to the Playing XI with his all-round abilities.All the questions will be answered in a few hours' time as the men who matter will get in a huddle to pick the squad for the multi-nation tournament.",India men's senior selection committee will pick provisional squad for Champions Trophy.

David Miller lauds Lhuan-dre Pretorius after Paarl Royals beat MI Cape Town

Dinesh Karthik on Lhuan-dre Pretorius, start for Paarl Royals in SA20

Jasprit Bumrah injury: Where things stand with BOOM!

Lhuan-dre Pretorius may be living life in the fast lane at the Paarl Royals in the SA20 , but the teenager’s dad Abe is still picking up traffic fines.Pretorius has burst on the global cricket scene in spectacular fashion with the former South Africa U-19 star smashing two half-centuries in three matches to top the SA20 run-scorers list.He has surprised many with the maturity he’s shown at the crease. Unfazed at the prospect of facing up to the likes of Trent Boult, Kagiso Rabada, Marco Jansen and Ottniel Baartman.But Abe Pretorius - Lhuan-dre’s father - claims his son is still just a normal teen finding his way in the world.“I remember when Anrich Nortje bowled to him. He told me an interesting story: ‘Dad, I wasn’t scared of the ball. I was more scared of me running into him because I saw it on TV.’ He was never afraid. Pace never bothered him,” said the senior Pretorius.“But he’s still a baby. He’s only 18. He has a mustache. But his beard is soft. He's still a kid and sometimes I forget.“But he's also not a kid getting all the speed fines. The car is still in my name. It's crazy!”The Pretorius family have certainly been there to support Lhuan-dre and fellow South African schools prodigy Vihan - ‘he’s my baby and can do no wrong’ - cricket aspirations since they first picked up a cricket bat.Abe installed a training net at their home in Potchefstroom early on and since they stayed close to Senwes Park - home of the North West Dragons - would regularly take his sons there to train.Lhuan-dre, therefore, had the privilege of spending time with the likes of SA20 stars Bjorn Fortuin and Rassie van der Dussen from a very young age.“He always wanted to play the game. He was brought up next to the field at Senwes Park. So, I was privileged to have a hospitality suite there. And that’s where he met Bjorn and Rassie.“He always played with them or next to the field to see them playing. And that's what's so nice. He plays now with Bjorn. There's a bit of banter going on between them.”At this critical age parents can often become over-indulged with their children’s sporting careers, forcing them to train when they may no longer enjoy it.Abe was never confronted with this issue.“He lives for cricket. He YouTubes cricket every night. I don’t think he’s watched a cartoon ever in his life. From a young age, before any big game, he would wake me up at five.“And we had a net in our yard at the back. So I needed to throw to him before school. And when he gets picked up and then he's ready in the afternoon.“I think more waking him up for academics. He never wanted to study. That was a headache and we had to get a tutor to assist him.”Whilst it was almost the perfect childhood growing up in Potchefstroom, the major cricket-playing high schools are based in Johannesburg. That’s close to 120 kilometres away.It is common practice for young South African boys to leave their family homes at 12-13 years old after being afforded scholarships to attend these ivy-league schools as hostel boarders.But Abe was having none of it. Instead, he packed up and relocated the entire family to “The Big Smoke” - as Johannesburg is colloquially referred to - for Lhuan-dre to attend the prestigious St Stithians College - alma mater of Kagiso Rabada, Grant Elliot and a certain Kwena Maphaka.The latter is, of course, the same age as Lhuan-dre with their cricket journeys following an almost identical path. They played together at school, youth provincial Lions teams, SA U19, and now at the Royals.And according to Abe, it's Lhuan-dre, who kept wicket for most of this period, that knows how to inspire the tearaway rookie fast bowler.“Lhuan-dre knew just how to switch Kwena on. He would always go up to Kwena and whisper something in his ear, and Kwena would get spitting mad,” he said.“After that, Kwena would run through the teams. There are a lot of video clips of when they were at school together, especially when Lhuan-dre was keeping. They were a mean team.”With Lhuan-dre being a left-handed opening batter that keeps wicket, has Gunn & Moore as his bat sponsor, and also having an aversion to a prospective academic career, the comparisons with Proteas and Durban's Super Giants star Quinton de Kock were inevitable.But according to Abe, Lhuan-dre would not want it any other way, and is looking forward to the Royals’ first clash against the Super Giants at Kingsmead on Thursday, January 23.“He’s had a photo up of Quinny since he was very young. He’s still Quinny’s biggest fan. He simply loved Quinny.“Everything about him is Quinny. Yeah, I think you're going to see when they're going to play each other. It's going to be a challenge. I think he's going to be a star-struck!""Everything is happening at the speed of light for Pretorius right now. If he maintains this early season momentum through SA20 Season 3, it would not be far too to suggest that the powerful left-hander could come into the reckoning as a potential replacement at the Indian Premier League (IPL) in the near future.So, how does a father keep a teenager in check when the whole world suddenly wants to give him everything his heart has always desired?“I'm Afrikaans! That's all. He knows me. I don’t play.“I'm a mining oak and I'm Afrikaans. So, he'll know his way.“That's a cultural thing. He knows how it works. You stay humble.”",Lhuan-dre Pretorius has scored two half-centuries in three matches for Paarl Royals in the SA20. The 18-year-old has surprised many with the maturity he’s shown at the crease. Abe Pretorius says his son is still just a normal teen finding his way in the world.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117332449,imgsize-38972,width-400,resizemode-4/117332449.jpg"

Numbers elicit praise from likes of Sachin

NAGPUR: Ironic as it may sound, the buzzword in Indian cricket over the past weeks has been a non-cricketing term - PR. Fan wars on social media, ignited by the debacle in Australia, sparked debates on 'paid news' versus authenticity.With the debate still raging, a post on X went viral on social media on Thursday evening."" Karun Nair has a serious shot at making it to the Indian team if he can afford hiring a PR agency for a while,"" said the post.The witty remark struck a chord, highlighting the one element missing in Nair's arsenal - a robust social media presence. But in the Vijay Hazare Trophy , it wasn't PR that spoke for him; it was his bat, loud and clear.A total of 752 runs, at an unbelievable average of 752 was enough for Nair to trend on X. Social media has been abuzz, with many urging Indian selectors to draft Nair into the Indian squad for the forthcoming England ODI series and the Champions Trophy scheduled in Pakistan and Dubai.With an unstoppable 88* off just 44 balls on Thursday, Nair, who had been knocking on the selectors' door, almost broke it in the semifinal. Coming in to bat in the 35th over, the Vidarbha skipper unleashed his magic in the final 15 balls he played in the match, stacking up 55* runs. His ball-by-ball figures read 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 6, 6, 1, 6, 4, 0, 6, 4, 4, 6. He hit boundaries for fun and toyed with the field at will.Cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar lauded Nair's run on Friday. ""Scoring 752 runs in 7 innings with 5 centuries is nothing short of extraordinary, @karun126. Performances like these don't just happen, they come from immense focus and hard work. Keep going strong and make every opportunity count,"" he posted on X.Former Indian spinner Harbhajan Singh too was vocal on his Youtube channel, questioning the double standards of selectors. ""Different rules for different people… that shouldn't be the way. When Nair is scoring runs, you need to play him, right? He doesn't have tattoos, doesn't wear fancy clothes, is that the reason you're not picking him? Does he not work hard,"" he said.Some also drew comparisons of Nair's purple patch with that of VVS Laxman before the stylish batsman was re-drafted in the Indian squad. ""When Laxman made a comeback into the Indian team, he made a big statement with 1,400-odd runs. Nair's stupendous show should be enough for him to launch his comeback,"" a post read.Nair's super show has rewritten history books too. He now tops the list of most runs as a captain in the Vijay Hazare trophy. He is also set to finish as batsman with highest average in Vijay Hazare history.Prior to being dismissed for 112 against Uttar Pradesh, Nair had set a new List A record of scoring 542 runs without being dismissed, going past former New Zealand allrounder James Franklin","Vidarbha batsman Karun Nair scores 752 runs at an average of 752 in Vijay Hazare Trophy.

With this win, the Warriorz have climbed to the second spot on the points table.The Sharjah Warriorz chased down the target with 5 wickets and 11 deliveries to spare , despite facing a daunting chase of 202 runs. Captain Tim Southee praised Fernando's incredible performance, especially considering he had just arrived on the morning of the match.""To chase down a score like that and that innings from Fernando was incredible. To get off the plane in the morning and do that is special. Fernando was outstanding for us,"" Southee said.Southee acknowledged that there were areas for improvement, particularly in fielding and bowling, but he was pleased with the team's depth, as several players stepped up to perform despite some being sick.Coach JP Duminy echoed Southee's sentiments, emphasising the need to work on their fielding as a collective effort. He expressed the team's desire to excel in this aspect of the game.""Fielding is an area of our game that we can work on. We try to collectively put in a big effort in the field. So, that's something we want to work on and fielding is something we want to be better at for sure,"" Duminy said.Avishka Fernando, who scored a blistering 81 off just 27 deliveries, with 8 sixes and 6 fours, credited his success to focusing on his natural game and maintaining a positive mindset while chasing a formidable target. Fernando's knock was the fastest-ever 50 in the history of the ILT20 .""Focussing on my natural game and thank the lord for today's knock. The wicket was nice to bat today, the thoughts when chasing 200 was to be positive, it came naturally and thankful for that. I did not realise that I have broken the record for the fastest-ever 50.""Coach Duminy showered praise on Fernando, commending his confidence and ability to perform despite having just joined the team. He emphasised the importance of creating an environment where players feel at ease, which is something the Sharjah Warriorz strive for.""Just the mindset that he came in with, he got off the plane last night and got introduced to the team after that. And to have the confidence to arrive and play the way he did, shows, not only his character but also his ability. And just for him to feel at ease in our environment is something we (Sharjah Warriorz) strive for, but that was certainly one of the most special knocks we have seen,"" the coach added.Duminy revealed that the team talk at the halfway stage was light-hearted, focusing on the quality of the pitch and the need to play to their abilities. He emphasised that intent would never be lacking in their lineup and that consistency was the key moving forward.Sharjah Warriorz will face the MI Emirates in their next match at Sharjah on Sunday.",Sharjah Warriorz beat Dubai Capitals by five wickets.

We're a better outfit than the last two games: Super Giants coach Lance Klusener

Keep improving and play some better cricket: Sunrisers' Liam Dawson

Durban's Super Giants faced another setback in the ongoing SA20 League , suffering a 58-run loss to defending champions Sunrisers Eastern Cape at Kingsmead on Friday. The defeat marked their second consecutive loss at home, leaving head coach Lance Klusener visibly disappointed with his team's performance.""We have a proud record from last season playing at home, so this is absolutely disappointing,"" Klusener said after the match. ""I think we're a better outfit than how we turned out in the last two games. While the surfaces have been challenging, that's no excuse. We lacked the aggression to take the first punch, and when you're on the back foot, it's tough to recover.""The Sunrisers, who entered the match on the back of three consecutive losses, delivered a resounding comeback. Klusener credited their sharpness and determination. ""They came in with three losses, so for them to bounce back the way they did was outstanding. They were running well between the wickets, and we all know how well they field. Sometimes it's the small things that make the big difference.""The Super Giants' batting woes continued to be a concern, with the team failing to capitalise on starts. ""It's not about the batting quality; we have outstanding batters. The problem lies in not building partnerships or capitalising on starts. This evening that surface was tough to make a comeback against some quality spin,"" Klusener explained.Noor Ahmad was the standout performer for Super Giants, taking 4 for 25. Klusener praised his former Afghanistan players, Ahmad and Naveen-ul-Haq , the latter finishing with 1 for 44. ""Noor has been an outstanding performer for a few years now. He bowls at a good pace, making it tough to pick him through the air. That's his strength. Naveen is quality too - most wickets in T20s last year. It's great to see them both step up.""Looking ahead, Klusener emphasised the need for self-reflection. ""We need to focus on ourselves rather than worrying too much about the opposition. The way we batted, especially without building partnerships, needs to change. While our bowling is in a better place, we need to score more runs to be competitive,"" he said.Meanwhile, Sunrisers Eastern Cape finally broke their losing streak in the SA20 season with the big win. The defending champions, who had struggled in their first three matches, delivered a performance that Liam Dawson described as crucial for their campaign.""It was a very important win. We know how good they are, especially at home,"" Dawson remarked in the post-match press conference. ""They've got two quality spinners in Noor Ahmed and Keshav Maharaj. So we knew it was going to be tough coming here and getting a win. As a group, we’ve been honest with ourselves—we haven’t played to our potential at all yet in this tournament. This was a massive game for us, and we’re very, very happy to get the win.""Dawson highlighted the team’s resolve to use this victory as a turning point. ""Without doubt, we’d love this to be the catalyst for more winning performances and points on the board. We know we’ve been below our standards in the first three or four games. We’ve got to come back Sunday and try to produce another good performance against a very strong side,"" he said.Acknowledging the competitive nature of the SA20 League, Dawson stressed the need for continuous improvement. ""Every team is strong in this competition. We won’t take this win for granted at all. There’s a lot we need to improve on as a group. The focus is on keeping the momentum and playing better cricket,"" he added.",Durban's Super Giants lost 58-run to Sunrisers Eastern Cape at Kingsmead.

What does the horoscope of struggling Prithvi Shaw say?

Former India cricketer Aakash Chopra has expressed surprise over the BCCI 's decision to enforce mandatory travel rules for players, requiring them to travel together with the team for matches and practice sessions. Speaking on his YouTube channel, Chopra questioned the necessity of such a regulation and suggested it might have been introduced due to prior misuse.""Players cannot travel separately with families. All players are expected to travel with the team to and from matches and practice sessions. I am extremely surprised by this rule. Going for practice or the match is with the team only,"" Chopra said. ""This has been happening forever. If someone wants to practice more, they request the coach. But has someone been leaving early? Some abuse must have happened; that's why this rule is being enforced,"" he added.The BCCI's decision follows a review meeting held after India's 1-3 loss to Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, attended by captain Rohit Sharma , head coach Gautam Gambhir , and chief selector Ajit Agarkar Referencing recent incidents, Chopra clarified that isolated lapses, like Yashasvi Jaiswal reportedly arriving late to a session, do not reflect a widespread issue. ""I am pretty sure everyone wouldn't have been flouting the rule. Yashasvi Jaiswal couldn't reach recently, and he got punished for being late. That's a different story,"" he explained.Chopra also highlighted the importance of accountability for those who might have allowed exceptions in the past. ""If someone claims they don't need to travel with the team because they're staying elsewhere or it's their city, then whoever permitted this should be called out,"" he asserted.The new rule requires players seeking to travel separately to obtain permission from both the head coach and the chairman of selectors. While acknowledging that such regulations might feel overly strict, Chopra remarked, ""Such things are bound to happen if rules are abused.""",Aakash Chopra has expressed surprise over the BCCI's decision to enforce mandatory travel rules for players.

Dubai International Stadium tour: India's base for Champions Trophy glory

‘Gambhir trusts captain on the field’

MUMBAI: It's clear Indian captain Rohit Sharma has some serious reservations about certain clauses in the 10-point disciplinary guidelines prepared by the BCCI , which have come out in the media after a review meeting of India's dismal tour of Australia, and is set to discuss the issue with the Board secretary Devajit Saikia .Interestingly, while the guidelines, which include a 14-day limited window for the players' wives to be on a tour that is of a 45-day duration or longer, have clearly been made at the behest of head coach Gautam Gambhir and chief selector Ajit Agarkar , Rohit too was present in the review meeting for a long time.The BCCI has not officially announced the guidelines, but the 10-point diktat has already been published by the media.As Rohit sat beside chairman of selectors Ajit Agarkar before the start of the press conference to announce the Indian team for the ODI series against England and the Champions Trophy at the Wankhede Stadium on Saturday, he was heard telling his former Mumbai teammate: ""Ab mere ko baithna padega secretary ke saath. Family, wamily ka discuss karne ke liye, sab mere ko bol rahe hai yaar (I will have to discuss with the BCCI secretary about this (families on tour) issue. Everyone is asking me (to do so).""Rohit's comment wasn't on record, but it was caught on the microphone.When Rohit was asked about the BCCI's guidelines, he snapped back, ""Who told you about these rules? Has it come from the official handle of the BCCI? Let it come officially.""However, Agarkar confirmed that the BCCI had indeed drafted an SOP for the Dos and Don'ts on tour for Team India Asked what exactly changed in six months with the same set of players who won the T20 World Cup that BCCI needed stringent SOPs, the ex-India pacer explained, ""We'll probably talk about it endlessly if we keep going on. I suppose every team has some rules in place. We've spoken about various things you see over the last few months where you can improve as a team, where you can get a bit closer as a team. It's not a school. It's not a punishment.""It's just you have some rules in place and when you're playing for the national team you just follow those rules. Again, these are mature individuals. They are superstars in their own rights in international sport.""Agarkar said that many of these protocols for Team India were already in place, it's just that they were spelled out now.""But at the end of the day you're eventually representing your country. There are certain things that you just inherently follow as every team does. I think a lot of them have been in place. Maybe, we've spoken about it now and it's been put out, but a lot of them have been in place in any case. You keep on refining it as you go along eventually what suits the team, you want to try and do,"" he asserted.Rohit insisted that the India head coach had full trust on his leadership skills on the field and they were on the same page.""Both of us are very clear in what we want to do. I'm not going to sit here and discuss what goes behind every game tactically but it's very clear in my mind. Gambhir is somebody once we enter the field, he trusts what the captain is doing on the field. The basic talks that happen are only off the field, in the ground or maybe the changing room. ""But once we take the field it's all about what I do on the field. That's the kind of trust we have in each other and that's how it should be. That's about it,"" the Indian captain stressed.",Rohit Sharma has some serious reservations about the new BCCI disciplinary guidelines. Sharma is set to discuss the issue with the Board secretary Devajit Saikia. The guidelines include a 14-day limited window for the players' wives to be on a tour.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117356879,imgsize-31402,width-400,resizemode-4/117356879.jpg"

Delhi Ranji Squad for the next two matches:

What does the horoscope of struggling Prithvi Shaw say?

NEW DELHI: The suspense surrounding Virat Kohli 's availability for Delhi's upcoming Ranji Trophy matches has ended with the announcement of the team squad, excluding the India star.Kohli, who has been managing a persistent neck sprain, has been ruled out of the games against Saurashtra (January 23) and Railways (January 30).As reported earlier by TimesofIndia.com, Kohli has been carrying a niggle in his neck and even received an injection to address the issue . And thus, he will not be playing the upcoming Ranji matches for Delhi.A meeting of the Senior Men’s Selection Committee at the DDCA on January 17 finalised the 21-member squad, led by Ayush Badoni .Ayush Badoni (C), Sanat Sangwan, Arpit Rana, Yash Dhull, Rishabh Pant (w.k), Jonty Sidhu, Himmat Singh, Navdeep Saini, Money Grewal, Harsh Tyagi, Siddhant Sharma, Shivam Sharma, Pranav Rajvanshi (w.k), Vaibhav Kandpal, Mayank Gussain, Gagan Vats, Ayush Doseja, Rounak Waghela, Sumit Mathur, Rahul Gahlot, Jitesh Singh.In the ongoing Test cricket season, Kohli's form has been under scrutiny. The batting maestro, once considered invincible, has shown signs of vulnerability outside the off stump.After a promising century in Perth against the old Kookaburra ball, his performances Down Under declined sharply.Kohli managed an average of 22.47 in 2024 and only 23.75 across five Tests in Australia, with repeated dismissals on balls outside the fifth or sixth stump. His struggles highlight a potential technical issue that needs addressing, and playing domestic cricket could help him overcome the bad patch.Meanwhile, Delhi's Ranji squad shows promise, with Rishabh Pant as the designated wicketkeeper and the likes of Yash Dhull, Navdeep Saini, and Harsh Tyagi forming the core.","Virat Kohli ruled out of Delhi's next two Ranji Trophy matches.
