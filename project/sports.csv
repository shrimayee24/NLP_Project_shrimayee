Gautam Gambhir press conference: On Kohli, Rohit and dressing room

NEW DELHI: Former Australian captain Michael Clarke has expressed his strong support for Indian batting superstar Virat Kohli , stating that if he was captain he would ""fight with the team management"" to ensure Kohli remains in the squad despite his recent struggles in Test cricket.Clarke made these remarks on the Beyond23 Cricket podcast, where he discussed Kohli's form during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy and his overall importance to the Indian team.Clarke acknowledged that Kohli hadn't scored as many runs as he would have liked in his recent Test matches but emphasized the batter's immense talent and impact. ""It's Virat Kohli! This guy can make a double hundred tomorrow. He's that good a player. This guy could play, he should play until he's had enough. If he retires from Test cricket right now, there's only one team losing out, it's India,"" Clarke remarked.Kohli scored a century in the first Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy but struggled to make significant contributions in the subsequent matches. Despite this, Clarke stressed that he would back Kohli without hesitation. ""If I was captain of any team that Virat Kohli was in, even though I know he didn't make as many runs as he would have liked, I'm fighting for him to stay in my team,"" Clarke said.Also See: Champions Trophy 2025 The Indian batter's repeated dismissals outside off-stump during the series drew criticism from fans, with many recalling how Sachin Tendulkar famously avoided the cover drives during his iconic double hundred at the SCG. However, Clarke pointed out the fundamental differences between the two players.""Sachin was a different player to Virat Kohli. A lot of people during this Australian summer were saying Sachin did it in a Test match. He got out cover driving a couple of times and then let it go to make a 200 at the SCG. Sachin is a different player to Virat. Virat's greatest strength is bat on ball. He just plays it in a different way,"" Clarke explained.Also See: Champions Trophy Full Schedule Clarke's remarks highlight his belief in Kohli's enduring abilities and value to the Indian Test side, reinforcing the idea that Kohli's presence on the field is a significant asset despite a lean patch in form.","Former Australian captain Michael Clarke has expressed his strong support for Indian batting superstar Virat Kohli.

She also praised Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen for his work ethic and team spirit, urging other NFL players to learn from him. Bush misses the Buffalo community but appreciates her time there.

Rachel Bush Reacts to Florida Police's Viral 'Squatter' Arrest



Rachel Bush Praises Josh Allen, Fires Shots at NFL Players



""Things that have been 100% confirmed for me this year-simplicity is better, just play ball I don’t know why everyone isn’t taking notes from Buff on this. -hard work & camaraderie beats talent any day. - lastly what the guys started building 8 years ago in Buff can’t be replicated,"" Bush tweeted.

Reflecting on Buffalo and Family



""Of course! There is nothing like Buffalo and that is not a knock at anywhere else!"" Bush said. ""Because Miami is home and I love it here, we've also been to other places I enjoy too, but it's just the truth.

""When you spend 7 years somewhere building a culture and that team becomes your family, you won't be able to replace that ever. Change can sometimes be needed, it can be good because it really allows us to reflect on time and memories and appreciate them so much more.""

Wife to Miami Dolphins player Jordan Poyer , Rachel Bush has not hesitated over sharing her takes, especially over what is and should be highly topical. Of late, Rachel weighed in about a viral sensation on the state's police capturing a group referred to as 'squatters', a situation they received praise over. Apart from that, she also had something bold to tell the NFL player, Josh Allen , the Buffalo Bills quarterback during releasing some shots directed at others. Let's break down what she says!Rachel Bush wasn't going to stay silent when she saw Florida police arresting squatters in a viral video. On Monday, she reshared the post on X (formerly Twitter) with a simple but impactful message: ""As it should be in every state! Again, thank you Florida."" Her words showed strong support for the actions taken by the police, emphasizing that this kind of approach should be adopted everywhere.Soon enough, her tweet attracted attention and debate. For one who did not hesitate to say what was on her mind, it was but a moment before Bush proclaimed her position. She bluntly avowed, ""I stand with law enforcement and believe their actions were reasonable for the circumstances."". In doing so, she was underlining her affinity with the state's authorities but, at the same time, she was standing as a vocal exponent for the establishment of law and order in testing situations. There was no room left for any kind of ambiguity; her bold statement clearly spelled out where her loyalties lay.But Bush was also not interested only in Florida. In December, she created buzz when she also posted that she loved Josh Allen, a pretty bold statement for other NFLers. She said,Bush's words were far more than a passing compliment about Josh Allen's unimaginable dedication to the game. She praised him for how he wouldn't stop working to improve himself. This is the reason he has become what he is today-the relentless pursuit of improvement. But it wasn't just his individual performance that made a big impression on Bush; she also highlighted the positive, collaborative culture that he's helped create within the Buffalo Bills organization.In an Instagram Q&A, Bush expressed how much she misses Buffalo where her husband spent seven years before joining the Miami DolphinsRachel isn’t afraid to speak her mind. Whether she’s backing the Florida police or calling out an NFL player, she’s always stirring up conversation with her bold, unfiltered opinions. She keeps the dialogue alive with fiery takes that get people talking, especially when it’s about issues that really matter.Also read - “'It’s Not Fair to the Rams’ : Matthew Stafford’s Wife Slams NFL Over MNF Wild Card Scheduling""","Rachel Bush, wife to Miami Dolphins player Jordan Poyer, tweeted her support for Florida police's arrest of squatters.

NEW DELHI: Workload management is the need of the hour for players who feature in all formats in this modern-day era of cricket in an effort to keep them afresh and injury free. Jasprit Bumrah 's workload management is the most talked about topic these days since India's pace spearhead shouldered the significant burden in the recently-concluded Border-Gavaskar Trophy .The star India pacer finished the series as the leading wicket-taker with an incredible tally of 32 wickets though India lost the series 1-3 after the six-wicket defeat in the fifth Test at the SCG.The question now arises: what sparked the concerns over Bumrah's workload management? Anxiety swept through the Indian camp when Bumrah, after bowling 10 overs and taking two wickets, left the field with the physio during the second session.It was later revealed that a back spasm had ruled him out of bowling in the second innings, limiting his contribution to just batting.Bumrah bowled 151.2 overs (908 deliveries) in the five-match series against Australia, raising the question of whether this workload contributed to his injury.However, the numbers don't support this theory, as Bumrah's compatriot Mohammed Siraj and Aussie pacers Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc, bowled more overs than him. Still, the fact that Bumrah was unable to bowl in the second innings of the SCG Test cannot be overlooked.If stats are dug deeper, they reflect that this was not the first time that Bumrah has bowled over 150 overs for the first time.The 31-year-old pacer had bowled 157.1 overs during the 2018-19 tour of Australia, when India made history by securing their first-ever Test series win Down Under.In the 2024/25 Border-Gavaskar Trophy, Siraj led India's bowling charge, bowling the most overs in the series with 157.1. Bumrah followed closely with 151.2 overs, while Akash Deep contributed 77.5 overs. Ravindra Jadeja added 63 overs, and Harshit Rana, Nitish Reddy, and Washington Sundar bowled 45, 44, and 37 overs, respectively. Prasidh Krishna bowled 27 overs, and Ravinchadran Ashwin, who announced his retirement from international cricket, contributed 18 overs.In the 2020/21 Border-Gavaskar Trophy, Siraj bowled the most overs for India, delivering 134.2 overs in the series. Ravichandran Ashwin was close behind with 134.1 overs, while Bumrah bowled 117.4 overs. Other key contributors included Washington Sundar (49 overs), Shardul Thakur (43 overs), and Navdeep Saini (41.5 overs). Umesh Yadav, T Natarajan, and Ravindra Jadeja added 39.4, 38.2, and 37.3 overs, respectively, playing crucial roles in India's memorable series win.In the 2018/19 Border-Gavaskar Trophy, Bumrah bowled the most overs for India, with a total of 157.1. Mohammed Shami followed closely with 136.4 overs, while Ishant Sharma contributed 103 overs. Jadeja and Ashwin added 89 and 86.5 overs, respectively.

Dan Patrick on Tom Brady's 10-year Fox Sports broadcasting gig

Former SportsCenter anchor and host of The Dan Patrick Show, Dan Patrick, was concerned about Tom Brady two months into his 10-year Fox Sports broadcasting gig, calling the arrangement with the six-time Super Bowl winner ""problematic."" Patrick's warning was not designed to generate content for his listeners. The Las Vegas Raiders have indicated that Brady, who is a minority owner, will have a huge say in choosing the team's new head coach and the quarterback successor to the Aidan O'Connell, Gardner Minshew, quarterbacks room issue.Tom Brady's signing a 10-year deal with FOX to call NFL games on television led many to wonder if he'd ever coach again. Now that he's become a minority owner of the Las Vegas Raiders, a team needing a new coach and a plan for the future, assimilation into his new announcing gig only fuels more doubt about his future.Dan Patrick recently discussed the common rumor that Brady will jump ship after announcing the upcoming Super Bowl in New Orleans, highlighting the increasing frequency of such speculations on his Wednesday show. “I just see Brady as a one-and-done,"" he said. ""He does the Super Bowl, and he decides he’s going to be more involved with the Raiders. I just don’t see Tom sort of one foot in and one foot out with the Raiders. He’s too much of a competitor. And it’s one thing, you can compete in this business, like I compete with myself every day. We compete with ourselves each day, but this is different.”He added, “These are wins and losses with Tom. And creating something, building something. And I think that would probably intrigue him, as opposed to being a broadcaster. I mean, Tom can be at a certain level, and he knows that there’ll just be people who don’t like him just because he’s Tom Brady, or he beat their team, or whatever it might be.He continued, “Tom is competing against Tom. And I don’t know if he gets the same kind of adrenaline rush. Now, he will. When you do a playoff game, when you do a Super Bowl, Tom’s gonna be like, ‘Oh my God, that was awesome,’ but it’s still not that awesome of playing in it or you’re part of a team. He’s used to winning and losing,” said Patrick. “And if you get done with a show, only you decide if you’ve won or lost. ‘Hey, how did I sound?’ ‘Was that good?’ This is different with the Raiders.”Also Read: The iconic quarterback-coach duo of Tom Brady and Bill Belichick might reunite, this time with the Las Vegas Raiders Brady is expected to return for a second season on Fox, despite the potential stigma if he does all of his hype in one season. The $375 million deal, which reflects his competitive nature, is confusing as it doesn't apply the level of competition he is known for to the deal.","Former SportsCenter anchor and host of The Dan Patrick Show, Dan Patrick, was concerned about Tom Brady two months into his 10-year Fox Sports broadcasting gig.

NEW DELHI: Former India player and head coach Ravi Shastri suggests that Sam Konstas ' excessive verbal exchanges on the field stemmed from the young Australian batter's desire to make a strong impression in Test cricket.Konstas was at the center of a confrontation with star India pacer Jasprit Bumrah on the opening day of the fifth Test at SCG.As the day's play neared its end, Bumrah, eager to bowl one more over, faced resistance from the Australian players, who were attempting to waste time. This led to a heated exchange of words between Konstas and the Indian pacer.Konstas scored 113 runs in his first two Tests against India, with an average of 28.25, and impressed everyone with a dynamic 60 off 65 balls on his debut at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. He has also been named in Australia's squad for the upcoming Test tour of Sri Lanka, set to begin later this month in Galle.""I think it was more the exuberance of youth. He was like a cat on a hot tin roof. He wanted to announce himself straight away,"" Shastri told The ICC Review.""There was a lot of talk. He's someone who'll take the attack to the opposition. And he wanted to walk the talk. And he did that.""He flustered India, there's no doubt about that, in Melbourne. But my advice to him would be 'you've got talent, the focus should be on scoring runs more than anything else'. You focus on your strengths. You play the way you want.""Shastri also feels Konstas has to back his defensive game in his first overseas Test trip in Sri Lanka. ""I think the tour of Sri Lanka in many ways will help. Getting out of Australia, playing overseas, and then getting to learn a lot of other things and maturing,"" he said.Australia batting great Ricky Ponting believes that Konstas has a long journey ahead if he aims to establish himself as a Test opener. He added that playing two matches against India would have provided Konstas with valuable learning experiences.""I don't think he can survive as a Test opening batsman playing like that all the time. So he will learn a lot from the first couple of games that he played as a batsman, but just as an international sportsman as well, I think he'll learn a lot. It's a big stage and he really enjoyed it at the MCG.""""But I've seen this happen a lot with young players. They come in, they get overawed by everything a little bit, and it takes them a few games or a few series just to actually work out who they are and who they need to be successful international players,"" said Ponting on the ICC Review show.",Ravi Shastri says Sam Konstas'excessive verbal exchanges on the field stemmed from the young Australian batter's desire to make a strong impression in Test cricket.

After the debacle in Test matches in the last two series - losing to New Zealand and Australia - India shift their attention to limited overs cricket. India play five T20Is and three ODIs against England starting 22 January until 12 February. The series marks as India's preparations for the ICC Champions Trophy that gets underway on 19 February with India playing a day later in Dubai, UAE.India have not played the 50-over format since August last year when they finished second best to Sri Lanka. The three-match series finished 2-0 for the hosts. That series featured all seniors, including Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli.Rohit is certain to captain the side in the UAE and will have Jasprit Bumrah as his vice-captain, barring any major fitness concerns. White-ball specialists like Shreyas Iyer, Hardik Pandya and Arshdeep Singh will also be in the mix.India, two-time champions of the Champions Trophy , have been placed alongside Bangladesh, New Zealand and Pakistan in Group A in the Champions Trophy.Much of the discussion in the lead-up to the Champions Trophy has been on India's travel plans for hosts Pakistan. After India stated they will not be willing to travel to the neighbours for security reasons, a lengthy dialogue ensued between the two boards and the International Cricket Council (ICC).In the end, it was declared that the tournament will be played in a hybrid-model with India's matches, including the first semi-final and a potential final, to be played in Dubai. Rest of the matches will take place in Pakistan.Additionally, neither sides will travel to their neighbours for an ICC event until 2027.As TimesofIndia.com had reported , India men's cricket team's chairman of selectors Ajit Agarkar is due to begin discussions with head coach Gautam Gambhir in order to pick the squad.With the tournament starting on 19 February , team's need to pick their provisional 15-member squad by 12 January. However, they can make changes until 13 February.""All teams need to submit their provisional squads by January 12 but (are) allowed to make changes till February 13. It is up to the teams whether they want to announce the squad or not as the International Cricket Council (ICC) will release the submitted squads only on February 13,"" said an ICC official.To solidify plans and get some warm-up, all Champions Trophy-bound players are expected to play against England in the three ODIs on 6, 9, 12 February in Nagpur, Cuttack and Ahmedabad.The only exception to those plans could be Jasprit Bumrah. The seamer, who bowled 151.2 overs in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, picked up a back spasm in Sydney and was unable to bowl in the final innings of the series.As per medical officials, if it is indeed just back spasm, Bumrah should be fit in six weeks for the start of the Champions Trophy. If it is worse, like a Grade 1 stress fracture, the seamer would be out for some time.""It does depend on the final diagnosis of the injury. Back spasm is normally an orange light, it tells you that something worse could be in store and you need to stop at that point… Having suffered a lower back stress fracture earlier, Bumrah must have read the signs at the right time and decided to stop in Sydney,"" a former India Test bowler had told TOI ""Most likely, this time he felt a tightness in the upper back. The reports have gone to his surgeon, we should have the final results very soon. My hunch is he will be part of the first squad that will be announced for CT. After all, you can have an injury replacement later,"" the pacer added.Former India trainer Ramji Srinivasan said it can take up to one to six months of recovery if it is a Grade 1 to 3 injury.Ramji, though, was wary of putting Bumrah back into the bowling lineup with IPL to follow. Bumrah is a treasure and he should be handled with care. A CT is not the end of the world. If there is the slightest doubt, he shouldn't be in the squad. Five back-to-back Test matches isn't something he has ever played in his cricketing career,"" the trainer said.As per areport, Mohammed Shami is in contention for a spot in the England series and the Champions Trophy. The seamer was floated as a potential inclusion throughout the series in Australia but wasn't called up in the end.The report said NCA medical team has been keeping checks on Shami, who underwent surgery on his right heel last year. While it has healed, he experienced minor knee swelling.Recently, Shami has played a couple of Vijay Hazare Trophy matches for Bengal and played again in the pre-quarterfinal against Haryana on Thursday.In the match played in Baroda , Shami opened the bowling and took three wickets from his quota of 10 overs. The seamer accounted for the wickets of Himanshu Rana, Dinesh Bana and Anshul Kamboj to finish with figures of 3/61.",India play five T20Is and three ODIs against England starting 22 January until 12 February. The series marks as India's preparations for the ICC Champions Trophy that gets underway on 19 February with India playing a day later in Dubai. India have not played the 50-over format since August last year when they finished second best to Sri Lanka.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117078835,imgsize-237674,width-400,resizemode-4/117078835.jpg"

Former India batter Manoj Tiwary expressed his reservations about Gautam Gambhir 's suitability as the head coach of the Indian national cricket team. He believes Gambhir's expertise lies in mentoring IPL franchises, not leading the national side.India's recent struggles under Gambhir's coaching have fueled Tiwary's concerns. These include losing an ODI series to Sri Lanka for the first time in 27 years, suffering a 0-3 whitewash against New Zealand at home, and losing the Border-Gavaskar Trophy for the first time in a decade.India recently lost the Border-Gavaskar Trophy for the first time in a decade, and Tiwary, who once had a dressing room altercation with Gambhir during their IPL playing days, highlighted these setbacks since Gambhir's appointment as coach.""See, the results are there to be seen. Results don't lie. Numbers don't lie. The record speaks for itself,"" Tiwary told PTI in an interview.Tiwary, currently serving as the deputy sports minister in the West Bengal government, questioned Gambhir's coaching methods and lack of success with the Indian team.""He has not been able to carry on the good work which Rahul Dravid did.""It will take a lot of time for him to get on the track, or to winning ways. Because I don't see any experience behind his coaching the Indian team.""In Test cricket or in one-day series, I don't think he has any experience of coaching to be honest.""While acknowledging India's victories against Bangladesh across formats and a T20I series win against Sri Lanka under Gambhir's guidance, Tiwary maintained his stance. He believes that more experienced coaches like VVS Laxman and Sairaj Bahutule would have been better suited for the role.""I think VVS Laxman and Sairaj Bahutule... these guys were in line to be the next head coach. And these guys have been with the NCA for so many years. When Rahul Dravid was not available, the next coach was an automatic choice.""So, that process was getting followed. And in between how Gambhir came in, nobody knows. So, this result is bound to happen.""When someone who does not have any experience and he comes up and takes up the job... And knowing him, how aggressive he is as an individual in certain aspects, this result is bound to happen,"" Tiwary said.He reiterated his belief that appointing Gambhir based solely on his IPL results was a mistake.""So, the decision to appoint him as head coach, by just seeing (IPL) results, was wrong. In my opinion, it was not the right choice.""Tiwary also downplayed Gambhir's role in Kolkata Knight Riders' recent IPL success, particularly their third title win. He acknowledged Gambhir's contribution in motivating players like Andre Russell and Sunil Narine but emphasized the collective effort, including the role of coach Chandrakant Pandit.""Gambhir just had experience of mentoring KKR and Lucknow. He had no experience in coaching, that has not been an aspect with him. And when you don't have experience of coaching, then it becomes difficult for you to perform.""Speaking about Gambhir's involvement in a triumphant last season for KKR, Tiwary said, ""when players like Andre Russell and Sunil Narine were not performing well, obviously he gave them confidence. There is no doubt about that.""But you tell me, what did Chandrakant Pandit do as a coach then? So, you mean to say, all the players and Chandrakant Pandit had no role in KKR's turnaround.""",Manoj Tiwary questions Gautam Gambhir's suitability as India head coach.

Ryan Rickelton shares his ambitions after SA20 success

NEW DELHI: The opening game of SA20 Season 3 delivered fireworks as batter Dewald Brevis showcased his jaw-dropping power-hitting, setting the tone for MI Cape Town 's emphatic 97-run victory over defending champions Sunrisers Eastern Cape in Gqeberha on Thursday.Brevis, dubbed "" Baby AB "" for his resemblance to Proteas legend AB de Villiers, lit up the innings with a blistering 57 off just 29 balls, including a breathtaking no-look six that left fans and commentators in awe.Facing Beyers Swanepoel, Brevis cleared his front leg and unleashed a thunderous strike over wide long-on without even watching the ball's trajectory, on the first ball of the 13th over.The ball sailed out of the park, and Brevis wasn’t done yet—he followed it up with another towering six, this time an 82-metre shot over long-off.Watch:Opting to bat first, MI Cape Town overcame early setbacks with Reeza Hendricks (0) and Rassie van der Dussen (16) falling cheaply.The responsibility fell on Brevis, who combined calculated aggression with dazzling stroke play to anchor the innings. Contributions from Colin Ingram (22), Connor Esterhuizen (22), and a late blitz from Delano Potgieter (25 not out off 12) and George Linde (23 not out off 17) powered MI Cape Town to a challenging 174/7.In response, Sunrisers Eastern Cape crumbled under the pressure of the chase. Trent Boult set the tone with a fiery third over, claiming the scalps of Zak Crawley (12) and Tom Abell (0) off successive deliveries.READ ALSO: D elano Potgieter leads MI Cape Town to big opening win in SA20 against Sunrisers Eastern Cape The wickets kept tumbling as Delano Potgieter dismantled the Sunrisers Eastern Cape lineup with a stunning 5/10, including a three-wicket over.The Sunrisers were skittled out for just 77 runs, with no batter crossing the 20-run mark.

Jacques Kallis answers what makes SA20 special

Port Elizabeth: MI Cape Town caused the first upset of SA20 Season 3 with a commanding 97-run victory over defending champions Sunrisers Eastern Cape in the tournament opener at a sold out St George’s Park .The Orange Army had come out in their thousands to welcome home the back-to-back champions, but went back home disappointed as MICT delivered an inspired performance.Robin Peterson’s MICT outfit dominated all facets on the night with Dewald Brevis smashing 57 off just 29 balls (2x4; 6x6) to lift the visitors to 174/7 before Delano Potgieter and Trent Boult combined to dismiss the Sunrisers for just 77.“Special bowler, special guy (Potgieter). He has not bowled much in T20s in the last couple of years and he delivered (tonight). So happy for him and all about the way he has adjusted on this wicket,” MICT captain Rashid Khan said.Potgieter may have claimed the dreamlike career-best figures of 5/10, but it was the New Zealand international Boult (2/16) that set the tone with a superb new-ball spell that yielded a double-wicket maiden third over.The 35-year-old showed his world-class ability to swing the new ball back into the right-hander, which accounted for Sunrisers’ England Test opener Zak Crawley.Boult showed that he will be a major addition not only to the MICT squad, but also a wonderful asset to the league in its entirety.It was the first time that MICT had beaten the Sunrisers Eastern Cape in five attempts since the inception of SA20 two years ago.And it was only fitting that Brevis played a major role in the victory with the Rising Star delivering on his potential that was first seen in the competition opener at Newlands two seasons ago.The 21-year-old was in rousing form striking the ball cleanly from the outset. His first task was to take on the dual spin of Simon Harmer and Liam Dawson before launching successive straight sixes off seamer Beyers Swanepoel.One of Brevis’ half dozen sixes was caught one-handed in the crowd by Christopher Moolman, who became the first entrant into the 'Catch R2million' competition for Season 3 - winning Rs 90 lakhs (~ $105,600).“Brilliant start for us, that is the kind of start you want in such competitions. We had a couple of tough years and then the start … the way Brevis batted and then the way we finished, it was special,"" said Rashid in the presentation.“He is someone who can change the momentum at any time. He has that skill and ability. He has delivered in the past, it was a brilliant innings under pressure.“The way he hit the ball, it was amazing to see. In T20, you always need a good start, and someone like him (Boult), who had been doing it for a long time, that experience helps. That gave us a strong base and momentum,” he added.Although MICT lost Brevis heading into the final five overs, the momentum was maintained by Potgieter (25 not out, 12 balls) and George Linde (23 not out, 17 balls) with an unbroken 41-run partnership.The pair took 24 runs off Sunrisers’ Marco Jansen’s final over which swung the momentum in MICT’s favour which they never relinquished for the remainder of the evening.MICT will hope to maintain their winning momentum when they face Joburg Super Kings at the Wanderers on Saturday, while Sunrisers will look to bounce back against Paarl Royals at Boland Park.",MI Cape Town caused the first upset of SA20 Season 3 with a commanding 97-run victory over defending champions Sunrisers Eastern Cape.

Rahul's wicketkeeping fitness in question with Pant and Samson in fray; eyes also on spin attack, fitness of Bumrah and Shami

Poll Who Do You Think Is Better as a Wicketkeeper in the Champions Trophy? KL Rahul Rishabh Pant

NEW DELHI: When the national selectors and the Indian team management get together during the weekend to discuss the squad for the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy next month , one can expect tough debates over balancing the spin attack, finding the two wicketkeepers and keeping a close eye on the fitness of Mohammed Shami and Jasprit Bumrah TOI understands that the selectors will pick a team for the T20I home series against England separately before finalising the potential team for the subsequent ODI series against England and the Champions Trophy It may be safe to assume that there will be a very few changes in the T20 that played in South Africa in November.It is learnt that the players from the recently concluded Australia tour, who are certain to play in the Champions Trophy , will play directly in the three-match ODI series.The biggest challenge in front of the selectors is zeroing down on the wicketkeeping options followed by balancing the lower middle order with spinners who can bat well. KL Rahul had become the preferred wicketkeeper in ODIs during Rishabh Pant 's absence from international cricket. However, Rahul's fitness to keep wickets for longer periods became a cause of concern after the 2023 ODI World Cup.Rahul was sidelined from the game for a couple of months last year - his hamstring struggled to cope with the workload of wicketkeeping. Interestingly, Pant replaced him in the XI in the last ODI India played in Sri Lanka in August last year.Sources said Pant being a left-hander provides variety in the middle order. It will be interesting to see if the selectors go with Rahul if he doesn't keep wickets. Sources also said that Rahul may be rested to be in shape for Champions Trophy.That decision will influence the chances of Sanju Samson and Shreyas Iyer in the middle order. Samson hit a hundred in the last ODI he played for India in South Africa in December 2023.But that innings came at No. 3 when regular top order of Rohit Sharma Virat Kohli and Shubman Gill were rested for the series. It is understood that coach Gautam Gambhir is very fond of Samson and wants to use him in formats other than T20s.The selectors are very eager to get Yashashvi Jaiswal, who is yet to make his ODI debut, in the ODI team. So, it could come down to Samson or Jaiswal being picked as the reserve opener.Picking the spin attack for pitches in Dubai isn't going to be straightforward. The team management likes to have batting cushion down the order. This is where Ravindra Jadeja 's credentials will be assessed. Axar Patel has been the more consistent spin-bowling allrounder. Washington Sundar's consistency with his off-break is something Gambhir wants to invest more in.The clincher could be Kuldeep Yadav's fitness. It is learnt that he is recovering well from his left groin injury and started bowling at the National Cricket Academy. It will be interesting to see if the selectors are ready to take him directly to the Champions Trophy should he not be available for the ODI series at home.The selectors have also kept a close watch on Varun Chakravarthy's progress along with Ravi Bishnoi in the Vijay Hazare Trophy. If anything, Chakravarthy's mobility in the field for 50 overs and limited batting ability could hinder his chances.There's some concern over the fitness of pacers Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami. While the BCCI has chosen against divulging the nature of Bumrah's injury, Shami has been playing in the Vijay Hazare Trophy after having reported frequent instances of swollen knees while bowling in domestic cricket upon his return from a heel injury that kept him away from international cricket since the last ODI World Cup.Arshdeep Singh seems the only certain pacer to travel to Dubai with Mukesh Kumar, Harshit Rana and Prasidh Krishna all jostling for places.","Rahul's wicketkeeping fitness in question with Pant and Samson in fray. eyes also on spin attack, fitness of Bumrah and Shami. ToI understands that the selectors will pick a team for the T20I home series against England separately.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117102155,imgsize-40576,width-400,resizemode-4/117102155.jpg"

Shafali in the last two or three one-day series, she's not been part of the squad. Pratika (Rawal) in the last series has done really well in her absence, but definitely Shefali scored a lot of runs in domestic cricket, so she's definitely in the scheme of things,"" Mandhana said on the eve of the series opener in Rajkot.""I'm really happy that she went back and got those runs.""Mandhana emphasised the team's focus on utilizing available resources effectively. She highlighted the team's balanced composition and the capabilities of the players included in the squad.""As a team, we do not have to think what is not there because we want to go out there and have the positive mindset that we have a really balanced squad. The girls who have come in as well are really, really good.""We will not think about what is not there.""India's recent series against the West Indies, where they won the T20I series 2-1 and the ODI series 3-0, has instilled confidence in the team.""We had a good series against West Indies. 2-1 in the T20I series, 3-0 in the one-day series. Definitely the last series gives us a lot of confidence and different batters at different times got runs, and especially against the West Indies our bowling attack was at point.""So, hoping that we keep the form going.""The series against Ireland provides an opportunity for younger players to showcase their talent and contend for selection in the upcoming ODI World Cup, which India will host later this year. The absence of senior players like Harmanpreet and Renuka creates space for these younger players.""Renuka and Harman both have been really important members and they have played their part amazingly well. But of course, because they are rested, it's an opportunity for two of the other young girls.""Whoever will get the opportunity, I am sure they will try and grab it with both their hands,"" the skipper said.Although Ireland may not be considered a formidable opponent, the lack of familiarity with their playing style adds an element of intrigue to the series.""We haven't played much against Ireland. It's a new team almost. Of course, we keep on playing against Australia.""Mandhana expressed satisfaction with the diverse range of opponents India has faced recently, facilitated by the ICC Championship system.""The ICC Championship system gives us a chance to play all the teams in the three-year cycle. Ireland, we haven't played a lot of cricket against them but they have played some exciting cricket in the last one or two years.""Sometimes playing against a new opposition is always very exciting and I am sure that we won't look at them in any other way. As I said, for us, it's about going out and giving our best.""She added, ""Every time we get an opportunity, I think in the last four or five series in India, we've played on different conditions which is great for women's cricket. We're going to different venues. I think that is a challenge.""Mandhana also said the teams continues to strive towards becoming one of the best fielding sides in the world.""We have a fielding session every time. There's nothing like, oh, there's a concern area. That's our routine. As a team, we are really high on doing the routine stuff.""We are considering batting and bowling and third skill is fielding which is really important to do well as a team.""So, as much as we are trying to put efforts off the field, I'm happy that you're able to see it.

NEW DELHI: In the 2015-16 football season, a storm of unexpected events swept across England, rocking the entire world. At its heart was a team that had barely secured the Premier League promotion just a season earlier. Leicester City, a squad set up with low-profile names like Jamie Vardy, Riyad Mahrez, N'Golo Kanté, and their stoic captain Wes Morgan, was the epicentre.Operating on a shoestring budget in a cash-rich league, the Claudio Ranieri-led side lost only thrice in a 38-match season before lifting their maiden Premier League title, the top division of English football. With Leicester's name forever etched in history, Ranieri became the architect of this fairy tale that many once deemed unthinkable.Fast-forward a year, and halfway across the globe in India, chatters of a similar miracle were being heard. Much like Leicester, Aizawl FC — a club crowned champions of the I-League 2nd Division just a year earlier — were considered merely bystanders in the title race in India's top division ahead of the 2016/17 season.Under the guidance of a baby-faced Khalid Jamil , however, they shattered all expectations, losing only three games en route to lifting their historic maiden I-League title.""Winning the league in 2017 with Aizawl was the most memorable moment. We were an underrated team back then, so achieving that was truly special,"" goalkeeper Albino Gomes , who played an integral part in Aizwal's success that season, told TimesofIndia.com during an exclusive interaction.For Albino, however, one specific moment stood out above all: the penalty save that defined Aizawl’s 1-1 draw against Bengaluru FC in a title race that saw Aizawl finishing top with 37 points and Mohun Bagan runners-up with 36.""I saved a penalty from Sunil Chhetri in that match. If he had scored that penalty, we would have lost crucial points, and that might have cost us the league title,"" recalled Albino, who was awarded the Hero of the Match accolade that day for his game-changing save in the 55th minute.Now plying his trade for Indian Super League (ISL) club Jamshedpur FC, Albino Gomes initially never envisioned himself as a goalkeeper.""I actually went for the striker position in the school team,"" Gomes admitted with a chuckle. ""I was desperate to make it onto the team, but there were so many senior players ahead of me that I didn’t stand a chance as a striker. Then I noticed something — no one had taken up the goalkeeping spot. My coach stepped in, noticing that I was quite tall for my age, and suggested I give it a try. It felt like my only way to get on the pitch, so I decided to go for it. That’s how I started goalkeeping for my school team.""Reflecting on those formative years, Gomes is quick to acknowledge the impact of his school’s physical education teacher, Milind Sir, and a coach named Jerome on his journey as a goalkeeper.""In our school team, we had this one summer camp where they brought in a special coach from Bombay,"" he recalled. ""His name was Jerome, and he was Goan, he taught me the basics of goalkeeping. He helped mould me into a goalkeeper.""The footballing culture in Goa is rich and vibrant. Yet, during the months of December and January, around the time of New Year, Goa comes across as a different place.Amid the hustle of tourists roaming around to embrace the courteous charm in the air, the deep roots of its historic association with football may not always come to mind.Yet, Goa remains a state that has played 14 times in the final of the prestigious Santosh Trophy and lifted the title five times, not a bad number — given that they are the smallest state in India by area, covering 3,702 square kilometres of the nation's land.There are hundreds and thousands of stories across social media, stories of heroes rising from the sand and mud fields of Goa, as it resembles a machine still capable of producing prodigies of high calibre.""So basically, like every Goan, I played football when I was young. We played on the streets, in the mud grounds, on the sand grounds — everywhere,"" Albino Gomes reflected on his early days. ""From there, I started liking football, playing with my friends. Then, I joined the school team, and from there, I gained more interest in playing football. That’s when I started taking it seriously,"" he said.It wasn’t long before his talent was recognised.""After my school team, I joined Salgaocar FC. They picked me while I was playing for my school team. I spent around five to six years at the Salgaocar Academy. Many coaches there helped me, promoted me to the senior team, and gave me confidence. Training with the senior team and their goalkeeping coach helped me gain a lot of experience.""Despite Albino describing his journey as ""amazing"", it sometimes defies normalcy that he never got to play an official match for Salgaocar.""I didn’t play an official match for a while, but I got my chance to debut directly in the ISL. That’s where my journey really took off,"" Albino told TimesofIndia.com.In recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on goalkeepers not only stopping shots but also taking on the role of sweeper-keepers, playing from the back and distributing the ball with short passes.Opening up on the evolution of the sweeper-keeper culture in India, Albino opined, ""Many Spanish coaches have come to India, and they demand goalkeepers play with their feet and take on the role of a sweeper-keeper. This includes making decisions like passing the ball from one side to the other. If goalkeepers train and build confidence in this style during sessions, it can greatly benefit the team.""He continued to explain how the approach to training largely depends on the coach’s preferences: ""It all depends on the coach. Each coach has their own preferences. If they want a goalkeeper to play as a sweeper-keeper, they modify the training sessions accordingly. This helps the goalkeeper get comfortable with the team, know where the players are positioned, and improve passing accuracy. It’s all about what the coach demands and how the keeper adapts to it.""Interestingly, Gomes holds the record for saving the most number of penalties (4) in an ISL season. ""I focus entirely on the ball. Luck favours me too, I guess. My strength is waiting for the kicker to make their move before committing to a dive, whereas some keepers move before the ball is kicked,"" Gomes explained. ""My goalkeeping coach and the analysts send me videos, so I study every player who takes penalties to understand their tendencies.""Reflecting on his time with Kerala Blasters , the club he joined in 2020 and played for over two years, Albino Gomes spoke highly of the passionate fanbase, adding, ""I've been with Kerala Blaster. The fans there are amazing, and they still support me a lot. So I think that is a plus point.""""If you want to be a goalkeeper, you have to accept that mistakes will happen. If you make a mistake, you shouldn’t let it bring you down. Instead, you have to acknowledge it, work on improving, and come back the next day with the same mentality and confidence,"" Gomes, now an experienced campaigner, shared his mantra. ""I look for the mistakes I have made, talk to the coach, and try to correct them during the training sessions.""When asked about his future ambitions, Gomes expressed a strong desire to represent the national team, noting, ""I want to be in the national team because I've been there and I know how it feels. I have to get to the senior national team and I am working for that and hopefully, this season goes well. The coach will hopefully notice at the end of the season, let's see how it goes.""","Albino Gomes is a goalkeeper for Indian Super League (ISL) club Jamshedpur FC. He is from Goa, a state that has played 14 times in the final of the Santosh Trophy. Gomes won the I-League title with Aizawl FC in 2017. He was awarded Hero of the Match for his penalty save against Bengaluru FC.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117081223,imgsize-75896,width-400,resizemode-4/117081223.jpg"

Graham Potter has been appointed as West Ham's new manager, signing a two-and-a-half-year contract. This announcement came just a day after the club parted ways with their previous manager, Julen Lopetegui .The 49-year-old Potter has been out of work since his departure from Chelsea in April 2023. His tenure at Chelsea lasted only seven months, despite agreeing to a five-year contract. During this period, he managed 31 matches, securing 12 victories.West Ham currently sit in 14th place in the Premier League standings, seven points clear of the relegation zone. Lopetegui's time at the club resulted in six wins from 20 league matches.A heavy 4-1 defeat against Manchester City proved to be Lopetegui's final match, ultimately leading to his dismissal from the London club.""I am delighted to be here,"" said Potter.Potter expressed his careful consideration in selecting his next role, emphasizing the importance of finding the right fit for both himself and the club. He believes he has found that fit with West Ham United .""It was important to me that I waited for a job that felt right for me, and equally, that I was the right fit for the club I am joining. That is the feeling I have with West Ham United.""Potter's managerial journey began at Swedish club Östersund. He then experienced success with Swansea and Brighton before taking the helm at Chelsea.His first match in charge of West Ham will be an FA Cup third-round tie against Aston Villa on Friday. Subsequently, he will lead the team in Premier League matches against Fulham and Crystal Palace.Lopetegui's departure marks him as the fifth Premier League manager to lose their job this season. Other managers who have been dismissed include Erik ten Hag ( Manchester United ), Steve Cooper (Leicester City), Gary O'Neil (Wolverhampton Wanderers), and Russell Martin (Southampton).West Ham were among the Premier League's highest spenders during the summer transfer window, investing approximately £125 million ($155 million) in new players. These acquisitions included Max Kilman, Crysencio Summerville, and Niclas Füllkrug.Potter spoke positively about his interactions with the club's chairman and board, highlighting their shared vision and values.""My conversations with the chairman and the board have been very positive and constructive. We share the same values of hard work and high energy to create the solid foundations that can produce success. We are on the same wavelength in terms of what is needed in the short term and how we want to move the club forward in the medium to long term.""",Graham Potter has been appointed as West Ham's new manager.

By the time the 2026 FIFA World Cup begins, Brazil star Neymar will have reached 34 years of age; and while he is confident of the team's qualification, the veteran striker is also hopeful of making it to the squad for his last appearance in the prestigious tournament.In an interview with the CNN, Neymar said he won't leave any stone unturned to ensure that he is part of the team.""I know this will be my last World Cup, my last shot, my last chance and I will do everything I can to play in it,"" said Neymar.He has not made an international appearance for more than a year.Brazil's performance in the South American World Cup qualifiers has been below expectations so far, currently positioned fifth among 10 competing nations after completing 12 out of 18 rounds. The top six teams in the end qualify for the tournament.""I have a lot of faith in the team, in the players who are emerging, who are young,"" he said. ""We're not in a position where we would like to be. I think together we can achieve something very big. We have a year, a year-and-a-half to work, to do the right things to reach the World Cup.""Following his knee injury during Brazil's defeat to Uruguay in October 2023, Neymar underwent surgery that kept him sidelined for twelve months. He had participated in Brazil's initial four qualifying matches before the setback.Neymar made a brief comeback with Saudi Arabian side Al Hilal, appearing twice between October and November, but subsequently suffered a hamstring strain. Since then, he has remained inactive.""I want to be there (at the World Cup); I'm going to try to do my best, to work very hard so that I can be with the Brazilian team,"" he said.During the interview, Neymar also mentioned he won't rule out playing beside former Barcelona team-mates Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez at US club Inter Miami.""Obviously, playing again with Messi and Suarez would be incredible,"" Neymar, who also played with Messi at Paris Saint-Germain, said at an award ceremony in Dubai.""They are my friends. We still speak to each other. It would be interesting to revive this trio,"" he added.""I'm happy in Saudi Arabia, but who knows?

Sharp Yamal

Young starlets Gavi and Lamine Yamal fired Barcelona , without Dani Olmo after his licence to play was revoked, into the Spanish Super Cup final with a 2-0 win against Athletic Bilbao on Wednesday.Spanish playmaker Olmo was cleared to play again on a temporary basis before the game but the decision came too late for him or Pau Victor, in the same position, to feature against Copa del Rey winners Athletic.Gavi put Barcelona ahead from close range after 17 minutes and teenage winger Yamal netted the second early after the break.Spanish and European champions Real Madrid face cup runners-up Mallorca on Thursday in the second semi-final in Saudi Arabia, where the competition has been held for the past few years.""Athletic are a very physical team that make you run a lot, we suffered above all towards the end, but we were able to play well and we're very happy,"" Yamal told Movistar.The winger said Olmo and Victor were pleased to be allowed to play once more.""In the end you're nervous when you can't play and when you get news like that, you're very happy,"" added Yamal.Barca coach Hansi Flick hailed the decision from Spain's national sports council regarding Olmo and Victor.""The whole club is very happy for this right decision,"" said Flick, hoping to win his first silverware at the helm of Barca.""We wanted to show we are a team and we win also for them.""Barcelona, who qualified as La Liga runners-up, started brightly and Raphinha volleyed over from a fine Jules Kounde cross and forced Unai Simon into a good save with a free-kick.It was no surprise when the Catalans broke the deadlock with Alejandro Balde cutting the ball back for Gavi, playing in Olmo's attacking midfield role, to turn home for his first goal since suffering a severe knee injury last season.The 20-year-old pointed at an imaginary watch in his celebration, a nod to Olmo who regularly produces the same gesture after scoring.At the other end Inaki Williams dallied on the ball too long as Athletic's best attacking move of the first half broke down.Yamal, returning after an ankle problem, should have added Barcelona's second after Raphinha's shot was saved but the 17-year-old miscued an attempted lob.Wojciech Szczesny, on his second start in goal for Barcelona, made a good save to keep Inaki Williams at bay before the break.Barcelona doubled their lead early in the second half when Gavi slipped in Yamal who finished with aplomb.Veteran Polish forward Robert Lewandowski spurned a fine chance to add the third, firing off-target when well placed.Athletic coach Ernesto Valverde, who was sacked as Barcelona boss after a defeat at the same stadium in 2020, brought on Nico Williams to try and turn the game around.The Spain international, heavily linked with Barcelona in the summer, was not fit enough to start, but made a positive impact from the bench.The winger set up Oscar de Marcos to strike but the Athletic defender had strayed just offside and the goal was ruled out.Inaki Williams also had a goal ruled out for offside after Frenkie De Jong's poor back-pass took a slight deflection off Alvaro Djalo on its way to the Ghana international.""It's a shame given all the effort... but we have good things ahead of us and we have to continue,"" said Inaki Williams.Barcelona were able to book their place in Sunday's final, in which Olmo will be allowed to feature.""We don't care (who we face in the final), it will be hard and we want to win it, which is the important thing, and go back home with the trophy,"" said Yamal.",Barcelona beat Athletic Bilbao 2-0 in the Spanish Super Cup semi-final.

NEW DELHI: Goran Ivanisevic was the first wildcard to win Wimbledon , beating Patrick Rafter in a manic Monday final. It was 2001, and son Emanuel hadn’t been born yet. It’s 2025, and the Croatian teen with a heavy surname finds himself slugging it out on the practice courts of DLTA , having bowed out of the singles and doubles events of the Delhi ITF Juniors-J300 earlier this week.It is the start of the season, and there are many more frequent flyer miles to clock. “The plan is that I leave for Chandigarh (Friday). And after that, I will go to Kolkata and then back home in Zagreb, Croatia,” he chalked out his immediate plan.But he would rather be somewhere else. “Yesterday, I found out that I would get into the Australian Open juniors , but I didn’t know, so I’m here. That was pretty unfortunate. But I will try to catch Paris or Wimbledon or the US Open.” The 17-year-old knows he will attract attention wherever he goes, but he brushes that devil called pressure lightly off his shoulders. “I won’t say I was bothered, at first it was weird. But I got used to it, so it’s okay now,” he said.It was a toss-up between football and tennis when he was a kid — his father had famously signed a short-term contract at his hometown club of Hajduk Split after the Wimbledon triumph — but the decision was easy. “Of course, it’s mainly because of him and what he has done for the sport that I started playing tennis at four years of age. I was alright in football, but better in tennis. So at the age of 10, chose tennis, and then started playing professionally.”There are perks of having a famous father. Emanuel’s favourite player is Novak Djokovic . “I look up to Novak a lot because he is the best tennis player of all time,” he summoned the superlative. With Goran coaching Djokovic for six years, splitting mid-2024, Emanuel had plenty of time to learn from the 24-time Grand Slam champion. “I was with him in Dubai for the preparation last year, and he gave me a lot of tips. He spoke to me a lot about meditation, focus, eating habits,” he said.And did he follow up on the subjects? His leftie dad has been known to smash a racquet or two. “I think my mind is my biggest asset,” he pointed out. Mentally, they may move in different directions, but Emanuel is game on smashing a few down the middle. “I try to play similar to my dad’s style. Very aggressive with a strong serve. Pity there is not a lot of junior tournaments on grass, but I hope in the future that I will get the chance to play.”His father has already refrained from coaching him, citing the possibility of getting into too many fights. But the young one knows dad is only a call away.",Goran Ivanisevic was the first wildcard to win Wimbledon in 2001. His son Emanuel started playing tennis at the age of four.
