Bengals Allow Trey Hendrickson to Seek Trade Despite His Dominant Season





Protecting Joe Burrow: The Bengals’ Clear Priority

Fans React to the Bengals' Game-Changing Strategy

The Cincinnati Bengals are making waves in the NFL offseason, and the latest buzz has fans on edge — Trey Hendrickson , the team's defensive juggernaut, has been given the green light to explore trade options. It’s a move that's got everyone talking, as the Bengals seem to be weighing their defensive star’s future while keeping one eye firmly on Joe Burrow ’s protection.Trey Hendrickson has been nothing short of a game-changer for the Bengals' defense. Known for his relentless pass-rushing and league-leading sack numbers last season, Hendrickson was a cornerstone of Cincinnati’s defensive unit. When rumors of a potential trade began swirling, many dismissed them — after all, why would the Bengals part ways with a player of his caliber?But the unexpected happened. The team has now given Hendrickson permission to seek a trade, reportedly asking for a first-round pick in return. It’s a stunning shift that suggests the Bengals are open to reshaping their roster — but at what cost?The Bengals have long faced criticism for failing to adequately protect their franchise quarterback, with his injury history a constant concern. Recent free agency moves, including re-signing Joseph Ossai and adding linebacker Oren Burks, hint at a broader plan to balance both sides of the ball.This isn’t just about defense versus offense — it’s about ensuring Burrow stays upright and healthy for a shot at postseason glory. The Bengals appear willing to make bold moves if it means securing their QB's future.The move has sparked debate among fans and analysts alike. While some understand the logic — a healthy Burrow is essential for playoff dreams — others question the cost of letting a sack leader walk away.Naturally, fans are split. Social media is buzzing with takes, from those urging the team to keep their sack leader to others trusting the front office’s long-term vision.As the 2025 season looms, all eyes are on the Bengals’ next moveAlso read - Fans Rally Behind Tua Tagovailoa After 'Dad Bod' Yacht Photos Go Viral — 'Let the Man Relax",Trey Hendrickson has been given permission to seek a trade.

“Westbrook has proven he can play cleaner basketball and execute his role to perfection,”

The Los Angeles Lakers , despite not being the outright favorites in the Western Conference, remain strong contenders with stars like LeBron James and Luka Doncic leading the charge. After an impressive eight-game winning streak, the team’s record improved to 40-21 before stumbling against the Boston Celtics and Brooklyn Nets. As the offseason approaches, rumors are swirling about a potential reunion between LeBron James and a former MVP who could add depth to the Lakers’ roster.Russell Westbrook , the $7 million guard, is the name in question. Westbrook, who spent 11 seasons with the Oklahoma City Thunder and had brief stints with the Houston Rockets, Washington Wizards, and Los Angeles Lakers , could be on his way back to Los Angeles. His first tenure with the Lakers in 2021 was marked by high energy but also criticism for his inability to adapt to a winning style of play. Frequent turnovers and questionable decision-making led to his departure midway through the 2022-23 season.After being traded to the Utah Jazz and subsequently bought out, Russell Westbrook joined the Los Angeles Clippers before signing with the Denver Nuggets last offseason. In Denver, he embraced a reduced role, showcasing his ability to play cleaner basketball and excel as a role player. This season, the 36-year-old is averaging 12.9 points, 6.0 assists, and 5.0 rebounds per game while shooting 46.5% from the field.

Paul Goldschmidt opened up about his time at Cardinals

Paul Goldschmidt with Meredith Marakovits

""I loved it there. I’ve got nothing bad to say about the organization—the fans were amazing, everything was great. We had high expectations, just like we do here in New York. We wanted to win a World Series, and we didn’t do it, so that will always stick with me as a disappointment. But so many great memories and just a great time overall.""

Details into Paul Goldschmidt's impressive MLB career

It has been more than a decade since Paul Goldschmidt played in the league. Over his career, Goldschmidt has played with three teams. Currently signed with the New York Yankees , Goldschmidt was previously playing with the St. Louis Cardinals for six long seasons. Having played with the Cardinals for this long, Goldschmidt has had all sorts of experiences. While Goldschmidt does not have many complaints about his time at the Cardinals, he recently opened up about one part of his journey that he finds pretty disappointing.On Sunday, Paul Goldschmidt got the chance to be face-to-face with his former team, the St. Louis Cardinals, who ended up winning the Spring Training game against the New York Yankees by 6-5. Before Goldschmidt stepped on the field for Yankees vs Cardinals clash, he was interviewed by YES Network to talk about his strategy and gameplan for the Spring Training game.During one of the segments of the interview, Paul Goldschmidt revisited his time playing for the Cardinals. While Goldschmidt has no complaints about his time at the Cardinals, the first baseman was disappointed about just one thing. Moving further, Goldschmidt talked about it in detail, and said:Paul Goldschmidt started his MLB career with the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2009 when the team signed him for $95,000. In 2011, the Diamondbacks and Goldschmidt agreed upon a pre-arbitration agreement worth $414,000, followed by another pre-arbitration deal in 2012 worth $452,000.In 2013, Goldschmidt signed one more pre-arbitration deal with the Diamondbacks worth $500,000, followed by an extension worth $52 Million for 5 years.

Steve Kerr Explains Why He Told Jimmy Butler to Break NBA’s Unwritten Rule

Jimmy Butler’s Triple-Double Overshadowed by Controversial Shot

Jimmy Butler single handedly forces a shot clock violation

Gary Payton II Scores Career-High 26 Points to Lead Golden State Warriors to Victory

What should have been a straightforward win for the Warriors turned into a mess after the game. Jimmy Butler 's triple-double was overshadowed by a last-second shot that really upset the Portland Trail Blazers players — and it looked like it got under Butler's skin too. A video from after the game showed a tense moment between him and coach Steve Kerr , who later revealed he was the one who told Butler to take that shot. Here’s the whole story behind that unexpected twist.As the clock wound down in the Warriors' 130-120 win over the Portland Trail Blazers, Jimmy Butler was in a bit of a bind. With Golden State comfortably ahead and only a few ticks left, he had to choose between holding the ball or taking a shot. Usually, teams would just let the clock run out in these moments. But after a quick glance at Steve Kerr on the sideline, Butler decided to take an open jumper, which ruffled a few feathers among the Trail Blazers players.Footage from after the game showed Jimmy Butler frustrated during a brief but intense talk with Steve Kerr. Kerr later explained his reasoning, saying, “I told him, we don't do shot clock violations. If there’s a shot clock differential, we always shoot.” Kerr’s firm stance on this philosophy put Butler in a tricky situation, even though he seemed a little reluctant on the court.Butler had a standout performance that evening! He scored 15 points, pulled down 10 rebounds, and tallied 10 assists, marking his second triple-double this season and his first as a Warrior. His previous triple-double was on December 16 while he was with the Miami Heat. The Warriors are sitting pretty with a 12-1 record when Butler plays, highlighting his significant role in their success.While all this is happening, Stephen Curry keeps shining this season, hitting five 3-pointers and bringing his total to 251. This is his 11th season with 250+ threes, which is an NBA record. He’s just two 3-pointers away from being the first player to hit 4,000 career triples.Even with the fuss going on, the Warriors' depth was a key factor in their victory. Gary Payton II had an impressive night, scoring a career-high 26 points and tying his record with four 3-pointers. Buddy Hield also made his mark with six 3-pointers and 20 points, showing off the Warriors' strong offensive lineup.The arguments between Jimmy Butler and Steve Kerr after the game definitely caught some attention, but it doesn't take away from how well the Warriors played. With Stephen Curry on the verge of hitting a major milestone and Butler stepping up with his all-around skills, Golden State is proving they're a force to be reckoned with.Also Read - Shai Gilgeous-Alexander vs Nikola Jokic: Who Truly Deserves the 2025 NBA MVP?

Speaking on Cricbuzz, Karthik praised the veteran duo for their ability to rise to the occasion when it matters most.""They just know what it takes to do well in big matches.

NEW DELHI: Yuzvendra Chahal is set to return to Northamptonshire for the 2025 County Championship season after impressing during his stint with the club in 2024. The India leg-spinner’s new deal will see him join the squad from June—once his IPL 2025 commitments with the Punjab Kings are complete—and stay on until the end of the English season.Chahal will feature in both the County Championship and the One-Day Cup, with his first match expected to be on June 22 against Middlesex. In 2024, he made an immediate impact, taking five wickets on debut against Kent in the One-Day Cup and later delivering a sensational 9-99 against Derbyshire in the County Championship—a career-best performance.His contributions proved vital as Northamptonshire secured back-to-back wins against Derbyshire and Leicestershire, with Chahal finishing the season with 19 wickets at an average of 21 across just four first-class games.“I thoroughly enjoyed my time here last season, so I’m very happy to be coming back. There are some great people in that dressing room, and I can’t wait to be part of that again. We played some great cricket towards the back end of the season, so hopefully, we’re able to replicate that and big up some victories,” said Chahal.Despite not featuring for India since 2023, Chahal was part of the squad that won the 2024 Men’s T20 World Cup. His international experience, coupled with his county success, makes him a prized asset for Northamptonshire.New head coach Darren Lehmann shared his enthusiasm about Chahal’s return: “I’m really excited that one of the best leg spinners in the world is returning to Northamptonshire this season. He brings invaluable experience, and he’s an absolute gentleman who loves the game. Having him available from mid-June until the end of the season will be fantastic for us.”CEO Ray Payne echoed Lehmann’s sentiments, saying, “Yuzvendra was magnificent for us last year and played a crucial role in those back-to-back victories in September. Having him around last season was a pleasure; he’s a world-class operator and a wonderful person, so we’re all delighted to get him back for longer this season.”","Yuzvendra Chahal is set to return to Northamptonshire for the 2025 County Championship season.

Colin Cowherd draws surprising comparison between one superstar NFL quarterback and Donald Trump in bizarre analogy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/colin-cowherd-draws-surprising-comparison-between-one-superstar-nfl-quarterback-and-donald-trump-in-bizarre-analogy/articleshow/118987797.cms,"Credit: Getty Images

Colin Cowherd says Aaron Rodgers reminds him of Donald Trump — here’s why



NFL free agency is in full swing, with teams across the league reshaping their rosters, particularly at the quarterback position. Major moves have already been made — Sam Darnold has joined the Seattle Seahawks, Justin Fields has landed with the New York Jets , and Geno Smith has been traded to the Las Vegas Raiders. However, one notable name remains without a new home: Aaron Rodgers . Following his departure from the New York Jets, Rodgers is now a free agent, leaving fans and analysts speculating about his next move.Aaron Rodgers' uncertain future has stirred up intense discussion among sports commentators. On Wednesday's episode of ""The Herd,"" Fox Sports 1 analyst Colin Cowherd made headlines by comparing the four-time NFL MVP to former President Donald Trump — a comparison bound to create waves.“I think Aaron is a little like Trump, they give off the same energy that they receive,” Cowherd remarked to co-host Jason McIntyre. “I’ve known people who I wouldn’t think would get along with Trump, who have gotten along with Trump. If you give Trump a certain energy, you can get along. I think Aaron gives you the energy that you give him, and that’s his personality.”Cowherd’s comparison stems from Rodgers’ perceived polarizing nature, which has mirrored Trump’s divisive public persona. Both figures have cultivated loyal followings while simultaneously alienating others. Rodgers' outspoken stance on controversial issues, including his friendship with anti-vaxxer Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has added to this perception. Interestingly, RFK Jr. had reportedly considered Rodgers as his running mate for the 2024 presidential election — a proposal Rodgers turned down to remain focused on football.Rodgers’ time with the Jets unraveled during the 2024 season after he failed to return to peak form following his Achilles injury in 2023. The Jets' struggles on the field, combined with Rodgers’ perceived lack of accountability, seemingly convinced the organization that it was time for a fresh start. The team has since appointed a new general manager, a new head coach, and a new starting quarterback, signaling a clear desire to move forward without Rodgers.At 41 years old, Rodgers’ playing window is closing fast. His personality and history of turbulent exits — first from Green Bay and now from New York — have made potential suitors cautious. While Rodgers’ talent is undeniable, his strong personality and the potential for off-field drama could deter teams from taking a chance on him.Also Read: Texas judge grants protective order to woman who accused Chiefs’ WR Xavier Worthy of assault A decision on Rodgers’ future will likely need to be made soon, both by the quarterback himself and any interested teams.

How Aaron Ekblad’s suspension impacts Mathew Tkachuk’s timeline

The Florida Panthers received positive news about star player Matthew Tkachuk with his projected date of earlier return from his long-term groin injury. The Panthers now have a potential financial opportunity to recall Tkachuk before the playoffs because defenseman Aaron Ekblad received his 20-game suspension according to NHL insider Frank Seravalli.The 4 Nations Face-Off tournament left Mathew Tkachuk with a severe groin injury which required him to stay on injured reserve since February 8. Sports expert Chris Seravalli believes the suspension of Aaron Ekblad offers an opportunity for Mathew Tkachuk to return before his initially announced significant absence.A suspension of Ekblad for breaking NHL performance-enhancing substances rules allows Florida Panthers to remove his $7.5 million cap hit from their salary budget. Seravalli appeared on NHL Coast to Coast Prime to explain the potential benefits thatstered shift could provide to Tkachuk.""Now, the door has been opened with the 20-game suspension to Aaron Ekblad… His money comes off the books, and there’s a small window — potentially in the last week of the regular season — if all goes well, they could make the money work and get Matthew Tkachuk back on their cap.""If this scenario plays out, Tkachuk would have a brief stint in the regular season to regain his form before the Panthers begin their Stanley Cup defense .Florida’s general manager, Bill Zito, has remained cautious when discussing Tkachuk’s recovery, reiterating that his status is still uncertain. Earlier this month, he told NHL.com: ""We still have projection, diagnosis, and we have rehab. There is a course of action, but how and where and what manner of that progress from that rehab has yet to be determined.""Also Read: Dougie Hamilton injury update: The Devils’ defenseman is out for the season, playoff return uncertain The Panthers' Atlantic Division leadership position receives a major advantage from the possibility of Blake Tkachuk playing before the playoffs begin.

MUMBAI: Since its introduction, the IPL’s ‘Impact Player’ rule has stirred a hornet’s nest. Some have termed it ‘unfair’ while others think it will impede the supply line of all-rounders in Indian cricket. The Indian cricket board ( BCCI ) is unmoved, having decided to retain the rule at least till the 2027 IPL season.When it comes to the Women’s Premier League ( WPL ), though, the rule has been conspicuous by its absence, and Jemimah Rodrigues , for one, wants it to stay that way.“I’m not a massive fan of the ‘Impact Player’ rule,” the India and Delhi Capitals middle-order batter said, adding, “I like the rules we already have. This is how we play our international cricket as well and that’s what is going to help us there. It’s unfair to the bowlers when you do so well and towards the end, a proper batter comes in for the opposition.”The Capitals have made it to their third straight WPL final but the lack of game time may go against them, having not played since last Friday. Since travelling to Mumbai, however, the team is putting in the hard yards in the nets ahead of Saturday’s big final.Asked about the seven-day break, the DC vice-captain said, “It’s actually working for us. It has allowed us to have a lot of team-bonding sessions.”The Capitals haven’t played a game at the Brabourne Stadium but Jemimah said it wouldn’t matter. “Everyone in our team is familiar with the conditions and pitch here. We’ve been having good practice sessions on these off days. Honestly, after all the other pitches, Mumbai is like a batter’s dream. The outfield is fast. Time it in the gap, it’s a four.

SCORES:

MUMBAI: Nat Sciver-Brunt and Hayley Matthews have dug Mumbai Indians out of trouble on numerous occasions this season. On Thursday, they launched another of their rescue acts as MI went on to tame Gujarat Giants by 47 runs in the WPL Eliminator at the Brabourne Stadium.Chasing 214 for victory, the Giants innings had stuttered by the time the Powerplay concluded, being reduced to 46/3. The likes of Danielle Gibson, Phoebe Litchfield and Bharti Fulmali tried their best to propel them but MI made sure they didn’t run away with the contest. In the end, it was too big a mountain for Giants to scale as MI bowled them out for 166, recorded a 47-run win and set up the summit clash with Delhi Capitals on Saturday.Their total of 213 was MI’s highest in the history of the competition, eclipsing the 207/5 they had scored against the same opponents in the inaugural edition in 2023.Matthews’ 50-ball 77 was laced with 10 fours and three sixes and it pushed her to third in the top scorers’ list with 304 runs from nine games.Sciver-Brunt’s 77 came off 41 balls with the help of 10 fours and two sixes and she now sits on top of the pile with 493 runs. The duo’s 71-ball, 133-run part nership for the second wicket was their second 100-plus stand of the season. They had also put on a 133-run association against UP Warriorz, besides two 50-plus stands — 92 and 57 against UPW and Royal Challengers Bengaluru respectively.Skipper Harmanpreet Kaur then applied the finishing touches with her 11-ball 36 that included two fours and four huge sixes.While Giants had struggled in the field, MI, buoyed by the mammoth total, had a spring in their step. Matthews took a good catch at widish first slip to dismissed Beth Mooney while Sanskriti Gupta, Amanjot Kaur and Harmanpreet’s accurate throws found Harleen Deol, Gibson and Kashvee Gau tam short of the crease. On all three occasions, Yastika Bhatia dislodged the bails in a jiffy. Matthews also made an impact with the ball with figures of 3/31, which included the wicket of dangerous Fulmali towards the end of the match.Earlier, Bhatia was back in her opener’s role for Mumbai after Amelia Kerr failed to make an impact in the three innings she was promoted up the order.

But once settled they ripped into the Giants’ attack.Mumbai Indians 213/4 (Matthews 77, Sciver-Brunt 77; Gibson 2/40) beat Gujarat Giants 166 in 19.2 overs (Matthews 3/31) by 47 runs.",Mumbai Indians beat Gujarat Giants by 47 runs in WPL Eliminator.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Oliver Bearman Crashes Out of FP1 at the Australian Grand Prix, Norris Tops the Session



Oliver Bearman’s start to the 2025 Formula 1 season took a rough turn as the British rookie crashed out of the first free practice session (FP1) at the Australian Grand Prix. Despite the severity of the crash, Bearman was fortunately cleared by the medical staff at the track. However, his Haas VF-25 suffered significant damage, leaving the team with a race against time to prepare the car for the next session.With just over 20 minutes left in the session, Oliver Bearman lost control at Turns 9 and 10 after taking too much kerb. His car veered off into the gravel, oversteered upon re-entering the track, and ultimately collided with the wall. At the time of the crash, Bearman was sitting in 18th place, a position that reflected a challenging start to his debut F1 season.Before the session, Bearman had shared his excitement about testing the car on lower fuel levels for the first time. “I'm excited to see how the car behaves on lower fuel because due to a few issues and problems, I wasn't actually able to do that yet,” Bearman stated. “Going onto a new track, it's quite a different track to Bahrain and seeing how the car jumps onto this track and performance will be important.” He had also expressed hope that the car would respond well to the hot weather conditions in Melbourne, a stark contrast to the cooler temperatures in Bahrain.The crash resulted in damage to both the front and rear of the VF-25, putting Haas under pressure to repair the car before FP2. This marked Bearman’s first experience driving the car on soft tyres and low fuel levels, factors that may have contributed to the incident.Meanwhile, Lando Norris topped the session, setting a time of 1:17.252s for McLaren, finishing 0.149 seconds ahead of Carlos Sainz, who impressed in his Williams debut after switching from Ferrari. Charles Leclerc secured third for Ferrari, while Lewis Hamilton had a subdued start, finishing 12th in his first race weekend with Ferrari.

LAKERS at BUCKS | FULL GAME HIGHLIGHTS | March 13, 2025

The Los Angeles Lakers visited theon March 13, but without LeBron James, the team faced a devastating defeat as the Bucks secured a 126-106 win against the Lakers despite’s dominant 45-point showdown. The Lakers could not get past the strong defense of the home team at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, while the Bucks also showed their dominant offense beat the visitors by 20 points. Still, Doncic shined in his game. Here are the box stats highlights and more about the 26-year-old Lakers standout. Luka Doncic had a huge night on the court, putting up 45 points in 35 minutes and 40 seconds of play. He was aggressive on offense, making 14 of his 27 shots from the field.From beyond the arc, he knocked down 7 of his 13 three-point attempts. He hit 10 of his 12 attempts at the free-throw line.Further, the Slovenian star grabbed 11 rebounds. He also dished out 3 assists and contributed on defense with 2 steals and a block. However, turnovers were an issue, as he gave the ball away 6 times. He also committed 2 personal fouls.While Doncic was in his A-game against the Milwaukee Bucks, his individual performance could not bring the Lasker to the much-needed victory as the team struggled without veteran LeBron James . The Lakers fell short of 20 points and faced another crushing defeat.No other teammate of Doncic reached his height in the game. Of course, a few other stars put up stunning efforts to win, including Austin Reaves, who also had a strong outing, dropping 28 points and adding eight rebounds. But outside of Doncic and Reaves, the offense lacked consistency in the team. Gabe Vincent and Dorian Finney-Smith struggled, combining for just 5-of-18 shooting. With minimal contributions from the bench. Also, there was a lack of ball movement as they finished with only 18 assists, which proved costly for the visiting Lakers.On the other hand, Brook Lopez delivered an outstanding performance, scoring 23 points on near-perfect shooting for the Milwaukee Bucks.

Justin Gaethje wants to fight for the belt, but Justin Gaethje really doesn’t give a sh*t right now. I think Justin Gaethje is happy making the phenomenal amount of money that he is and just going out there and being able to be himself.” Bisping emphasized how other fighters like Arman Tsarukyan, Charles Oliveira and Justin Gaethje has an equal chance of facing Makhachev and went on to add, “It’s probably going to be, if you asked me to bet, I think Islam Makhachev vs. Ilia Topuria. Any of those guys – Arman, Charles, Justin – sure, they’d all be phenomenal fights and they’d all have a realistic chance of potentially beating Ilia Topuria. Granted, Ilia is special, but if he lost to them, there’s a massive market opportunity lost there, because Ilia vs. Islam – Ilia with the rise, Ilia still being in a lot of people’s minds the featherweight champion against the lightweight champion – there’s something there,”The English sports commentator believes that any match otherwise not ending in favor of Topuria will ultimately curb the excitement for a Topuria vs. Makhachev bout.“The public wouldn’t be quite still as invested. So I think they’re going to give him the title fight. I think Islam is going to take it. Granted, he wants a shot at becoming a two-weight champion, but he’s going to have to wait for a while because of Belal (Muhammad). So, in the meantime, you take out Ilia Topuria, which would be an absolutely blockbuster fight.”Also read: Jalin Turner “The Tarantula” Announces Retirement After UFC 313 Loss Against Ignacio Bahamondes Both Ilia Topuria and Islam Makhachev have conquered their respective divisions through their remarkable display of skills. Hence, a bout between the former featherweight and current lightweight champion will indeed be a spectacle to watch.","Michael Bisping believes that Ilia Topuria vs. Islam Makhachev would be a great fight for the UFC to bank on.

'I don't think that they had unfair advantage': Glenn McGrath on India's Champions Trophy matches at one venue,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/i-dont-think-that-they-had-unfair-advantage-glenn-mcgrath-on-indias-champions-trophy-matches-at-one-venue/articleshow/119000632.cms,"Glenn McGrath (TOI Photo)

Excerpts:

How should Bumrah be managed, given he has had his share of injuries?

How invaluable is Bumrah to India’s scheme of things?

Was Bumrah’s performance in Australia the best by a visiting bowler?

What do you make of India’s Champions Trophy triumph?

Did India have an unfair edge in the CT?

How do you look at India’s white-ball dominance? Can it be extended?

How can India become a bigger force in the longest format?

CHENNAI: Legendary Australia fast bowler Glenn McGrath has backed Jasprit Bumrah to make a strong comeback from his back injury, saying that the premier India pacer has to be “smart” about it as he is no longer young. Bumrah missed the Champions Trophy with a lower-back issue and is likely to be unavailable for the first few weeks of the IPL season . McGrath, the director of the MRF Pace Foundation here, also praised India for making the best use of the conditions during their CT triumph and asserted that they did not have an unfair advantage although they played all their matches at one venue.He puts more stress on his body than the other bowlers. He has found ways to manage it, but unfortunately not all the time. He has done it before (making a comeback from injury), he will know better than anyone (about) the recovery time, the time in the gym. He is not as young as he used to be, so he has to be smarter about what he does.He has to work even harder off the field. Being a fast bowler is like driving a car. If you do not top it up with fuel, you are going to run out of fuel sooner or later. My fuel tank was bigger than Jasprit’s because I did not bowl as quickly as him. These guys know how they work at their best. If India are under the pump, they need him.He is an experienced fast bowler and is one of the best in the world. He is unique. I take keen interest in Jasprit and the way he goes. The recent Australia-India Test series showed how important he is to India. If you take Bumrah out of that series, it could have been very one-sided. If he had been fit enough to bowl in the second innings of the last Test (Sydney), you never know. To play five Tests in a row is a massive ask and you have to look after him.The stats say that. Without a doubt, he was unplayable sometimes. It looked like he would get a wicket every over. I would not have minded playing on those pitches.They were the team to beat and they played well. Virat Kohli came back to form, as did the other guys. Australia had their chances in the semifinal, obviously we had a few of our bowlers who were out. The pitches took spin and India played well.It is the way it is. India does not travel to Pakistan anymore. There was only one other thing — the matches had to be played in Dubai. You have to give credit to India, they played to the conditions. They know how to play on spinning tracks. I do not think that they had an unfair advantage. It is like saying there is an unfair advantage if India play all their matches in India, if Australia play all their matches in Australia.Their IPL and T20 cricket has had a positive impact on one-day cricket. India are confident and they know their game well. It is important to protect Test cricket, but ODIs and World Cups are very important as well. India know the ODI game very well. It is a challenge for other teams to come over to India and play well. I like them to be challenged, but India are a quality team.They have quality players, there is no doubt about it. Test cricket needs India to be strong. They have got the batting lineup and the bowlers. They just need to make sure that their second-tier bowlers, who bowl around Bumrah, have the quality.",Glenn McGrath backs Jasprit Bumrah to make a strong comeback from back injury.

NEW DELHI: Bruno Fernandes delivered a sensational performance as Manchester United stormed into the Europa League quarter-finals with a 4-1 victory over Real Sociedad at Old Trafford, securing a 5-2 aggregate win.Fernandes opened the scoring from the penalty spot in the 10th minute and added another in the 50th, again from 12 yards, after converting in the 16th minute as well. Real Sociedad, reduced to 10 men following Jon Aramburu’s red card just after the hour mark, couldn’t hold off the pressure.Fernandes completed his hat-trick with a rifled finish in the 87th minute, and Diogo Dalot added a stoppage-time goal to seal the emphatic result. “We need to help him win titles, because he deserves it,” Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim told TNT Sports, praising his captain.He added, “It was a good performance. The physicality was there... Even without the sending-off, you felt that the team were going to win this game.” United will face Lyon in the next round.Tottenham Hotspur also progressed to the Europa League last eight after turning around a first-leg deficit to beat AZ Alkmaar 3-2 on aggregate. Wilson Odobert got the hosts level on aggregate with a 26th-minute strike, taking advantage of sloppy defending from the Dutch side.Three minutes into the second half, James Maddison fired in a composed finish to put Spurs 2-0 up on the night. Peer Koopmeiners brought AZ back into the tie after the hour mark, but Odobert’s second goal in the 74th minute secured a 3-1 win on the night and sent Tottenham through.“We’ve progressed, which is the main thing,” said Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou. “We played pretty well, I thought we were really in control of the game, but we were our own worst enemies at times. It got a bit nervy towards the end but we thoroughly deserved to progress.” Spurs will meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the quarter-finals.Meanwhile, Rangers pulled off a dramatic shootout win over Jose Mourinho’s Fenerbahce in the Europa Conference League. After a 3-1 defeat in Istanbul, the Turkish side fought back in Glasgow with two goals from Polish winger Sebastian Szymanski in the 45th and 73rd minutes, levelling the aggregate score at 3-3 and sending the tie to extra time.However, three missed penalties in the shootout saw Rangers advance 3-2. Mourinho was vocal in his frustration after the match. “We deserved to win over 90 minutes, we deserved to win after 120 minutes, we were the best team by far,” he said.“We did everything to win. The ref and the VAR decided that we should go to penalties. Congratulations to Rangers but I think my team deserves everything from me, from our supporters and even from Turkey as a country.” Rangers will face Athletic Bilbao next.Chelsea also secured their spot in the quarter-finals of the Europa Conference League with a narrow 1-0 home win over Copenhagen, finishing 3-1 on aggregate. Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall scored the only goal of the night 10 minutes into the second half at Stamford Bridge, ensuring progression for the Blues.Elsewhere, Athletic Bilbao staged a comeback to eliminate Roma 4-3 on aggregate, powered by a vital brace from Euro 2024 winner Nico Williams. Roma’s hopes were dented early by a red card to centre-half Mats Hummels. Lazio, however, had better fortunes, drawing 1-1 with Viktoria Plzen at home to progress 3-2 overall.In Frankfurt, Mario Goetze bagged a brace as Eintracht thrashed Ajax 4-1, completing a dominant 6-2 aggregate win. Lyon also impressed, smashing Romanian side FCSB 4-0 at home to seal a commanding 7-1 victory over two legs.Olympiakos edged Bodo/Glimt 2-1 in Athens, but the Norwegians advanced with a 4-2 aggregate margin. Fiorentina, runners-up in both 2023 and 2024, overturned a first-leg deficit to beat Panathinaikos 3-1 in Tuscany, securing a 5-4 win on aggregate.Finally, Celje of Slovenia advanced after a wild night in Switzerland against Lugano. Despite losing 5-4 to 10-man Lugano in regular time, Celje held their nerve in the penalty shootout to secure a place in the last eight.",Bruno Fernandes scores hat-trick as Manchester United beat Real Sociedad 4-1.

Madison Keys powered into the Indian Wells semifinals on Thursday, dismantling wild-card Belinda Bencic 6-1, 6-1 in just 65 minutes to notch her 16th straight victory. The fifth-seeded American, who claimed the Australian Open title earlier this year, now sets up a highly anticipated rematch with world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka . The two last met at Melbourne Park in January, where Keys defeated Sabalenka in a three-set battle, halting the Belarusian’s bid for a third straight title.Despite upsetting No. 4 seed Coco Gauff in the previous round, Bencic — a 28-year-old from Switzerland — had no answers for Keys’ relentless play.Elsewhere in the women’s draw, defending champion Iga Swiatek continued her dominant run in the California desert, advancing to her fourth straight semifinal at Indian Wells with a 6-3, 6-3 win over eighth-seeded Qinwen Zheng. Swiatek, the No. 2 seed and a five-time Grand Slam winner, is aiming to become the first woman to win the event three times. She’s riding a 10-match win streak at Indian Wells, having also lifted the trophy in 2022.Zheng, who had ended Swiatek’s 25-match winning streak at the Paris Olympics last year, couldn’t replicate that magic. Though she broke Swiatek twice and won six games — equaling the total games Swiatek had lost all tournament — the Polish star converted all five of her break points to seal the match.In the men’s draw, Daniil Medvedev battled past rising French talent Arthur Fils to reach the semifinals for a third straight year. The 29-year-old Russian, seeded fifth, came through a tense 6-4, 2-6, 7-6(7) win in two hours and 25 minutes. The third set featured a brief pause when swirling winds scattered debris across the court, but Medvedev stayed composed to close it out in a tiebreak.Meanwhile, 22-year-old Ben Shelton’s impressive run came to an end in the quarterfinals. He was the youngest American man to make it this far at Indian Wells since 2004, but Jack Draper of England halted his momentum with a 6-4, 7-5 win to book a semifinal spot.Also advancing were Holger Rune , who rallied for a 5-7, 6-0, 6-3 victory over Tallon Griekspoor to reach his first Indian Wells semifinal, and 16-year-old Mirra Andreeva, who defeated Elina Svitolina 7-5, 6-3 to secure a place in the women's last four.","Madison Keys defeated wild-card Belinda Bencic in straight sets to reach the semifinals at Indian Wells.

Champions Return: Rohit, Hardik, Shreyas, Gambhir return after India's title triumph

NEW DELHI: Pakistan cricket has once again found itself in the middle of controversy and chaos following its first-round exit from the Champions Trophy 2025 — a tournament they were hosting on home soil after 29 years.The disappointment has not only triggered fan outrage but also exposed deep divisions among past and present coaching figures. Mickey Arthur , who led Pakistan during one of their more successful white-ball phases, was brutally honest in his criticism. Speaking to talkSport, Arthur said, “I love this quote, to be brutally honest. Jason Gillespie is a wonderful coach, wonderful man. Pakistan cricket just continues to shoot itself in the foot. It is its worst enemy.”Arthur believes Pakistan had made the right moves by appointing Jason Gillespie and Gary Kirsten to helm the red-ball and white-ball squads, respectively.However, he expressed regret at the ongoing instability that continues to plague the system. “There are so many good players; they’ve got the resources now; there's so much young talent. They have incredible skill. And yet, it's still so chaotic. It's really disappointing to see.”In a sharp rebuttal to Aaqib Javed’s comments blaming Pakistan’s recent struggles on “too many changes”, Gillespie accused the newly appointed coach of trying to “undermine them” and even called Javed a “clown.”Arthur echoed those concerns, pointing to deeper issues in Pakistan’s cricketing structure. “They had got some really good coaches who could take them forward. But then that machine that works in Pakistan just keeps undermining, and agendas are driven in the media,” he said.ALSO SEE: Jason Gillespie calls Pakistan's Aaqib Javed a 'clown' “It's a jungle out there and I feel desperately sorry for Gary and Jason.

ICC defends protocol as controversy erupts over missing Pakistani representative

India win Champions Trophy title; Rohit Sharma confirms he's not retiring

Former Pakistan wicketkeeper-batter Kamran Akmal has stirred controversy with his blunt remarks regarding the absence of a representative from host nation Pakistan during the prize distribution ceremony of the recently concluded ICC Champions Trophy Akmal asserted that Pakistan did not ""deserve"" to have a representative on stage, citing the team's poor performance and lack of respect on the international stage.""The ICC showed us the mirror,"" Akmal said on his YouTube channel. ""The tournament's director (Sumair) was there. He was available, and why wasn't he in the ceremony? It is because we don't deserve to be there. We are not playing good cricket. Minow teams have shown us the mirror.""He further expressed his disappointment with the current state of Pakistan cricket, adding, ""No one discussed how Pakistan hosted the tournament. If we play such cricket, we will be treated like this. If you play for yourself, there will be no respect.""The controversy erupted when Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief executive and Champions Trophy tournament director Sumair Ahmad Syed, who was present at the venue in Dubai, was not invited on stage for the final presentation. India clinched the Champions Trophy title for the third time by defeating New Zealand by four wickets, but Pakistan's absence from the ceremonial proceedings drew widespread criticism back home.The PCB lodged a formal complaint with the International Cricket Council (ICC), calling the incident ""unacceptable.""

NEW DELHI: Carlos Alcaraz , the two-time defending champion, showcased his dominance at the ATP Indian Wells Masters on Wednesday. The world number three from Spain overcame the challenging windy conditions on Stadium Court to deliver a commanding performance against Grigor Dimitrov , defeating him 6-1, 6-1.Alcaraz's victory denied Dimitrov's bid to join Canadian Felix Auger-Aliassime as the only players to beat the Spaniard in three consecutive meetings. The Bulgarian had previously won their last two encounters, including the quarter-finals at the Miami Open last year.With his 50th ATP Masters 1000 match win, Alcaraz kept his hopes alive of joining Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic as the only men to win three consecutive Indian Wells titles.Having reached the fourth round without dropping a set, Alcaraz produced his most impressive performance of the tournament. Despite the swirling winds that caused ball kids to scramble after blowing trash, Alcaraz appeared supremely untroubled.He broke Dimitrov's serve to open the match and secured the first set with another break. Alcaraz didn't face a break point until the fifth game of the second set, but he overcame that challenge with an ace on Dimitrov's third break chance. Alcaraz then broke the Bulgarian's serve to take a 5-1 lead.Alcaraz sealed the victory in style, earning a match point with his sixth ace of the match and clinching the win with a forehand winner.

So that way I'm fortunate that they're very close to her, and she gets all the attention which is needed.""Humpy, two-time World Rapid Champion, became a chess Grandmaster in 2002 at the age of 15.At that time, she was the youngest woman to achieve the title, making him no stranger to medals or media glare — the most recent one after she was made the brand ambassador for the SOG Grandmaster Series.Life runs at a rapid pace when you are winning, in general. For Humpy, 2014 marked the start of a new journey — her marriage with Anvesh Dasari . A few years later, they were blessed with a baby girl, Ahana.Her commitment toward her child and family kept her away from the game for some time.""I still remember when I won the 2019 World Rapid Championship, I hadn't been playing for nearly one and a half years,"" Humpy says. ""I took a break in 2017 and started playing again around November or December 2018. When I came back to chess, practice and preparation were there, but I had become a much tougher person. You know, raising a child meant sleepless nights. I learned I'm even capable of doing the work without having a proper food. Earlier, that wasn't the case — if something went wrong, it would immediately affect my performance. But motherhood helped me adjust to all of that and made me mentally tougher.""Motherhood, for Humpy, was never a distraction as she continues to wear it not like a weight, but like armor.""I always feel motherhood is a strength. It cannot make you sidestep your profession,"" she accepts with a grin.As a child prodigy from Vijayawada, a small city in Andhra Pradesh, Humpy didn't have grand academies or training partners on call.What she had was a father looking after his child.Back then, it was Humpy's father who would help a budding chess star — someone who rarely showed interest in poring over dense books filled with opening theories or classic moves — as she prepared for upcoming tournaments.""I'm not a book reader at all. I'd love to read on a laptop or a tab, but not in books,"" she laughs. ""During my childhood, my dad used to do all the preparation — he would get those books, have them copied, and make separate bindings with the lines to play and all that. I was never into that kind of work. It was only after 2012 that I started preparing on my own. But by then, we were already used to laptops and software.""In a society that often romanticises maternal sacrifice into silence, here is a mother, who continues to redefine ambition, by not choosing between motherhood and mastery.As for her daughter, there is no checkmate path mapped out.""I never want to pressurise her,"" Humpy tells. ""For me, it's about letting her do what she enjoys, whatever profession she wants to pursue — it's fine. I just want her to grow up as a positive person. That's more important to me than which profession she chooses.""In a country now experiencing a chess renaissance, Koneru Humpy remains an epitome of calmness. ""As for staying calm under pressure, I think it comes naturally to me. Even as a child, I was like that. People often say they couldn't tell whether I won or lost a game because I always maintained the same calm,"" she adds.Behind her calm demeanour lies a strict routine: ""sleep early, wake up early, and that helps me stay composed and well-prepared"".""During tournaments, I prefer going for walks to get fresh air since we spend most of our time indoors. When I'm at home, I make sure to go to the gym every day to maintain physical fitness. Yoga is great, of course, but I personally enjoy more physical activity, especially because we sit for long hours while playing,"" she continues.The 37-year-old GM readies her bid for the Women's Grand Prix in Pune (April 13-24), Norway Chess (May 26-June 6), then the World Cup (July 5-29) in Georgia.""I think I definitely need to change my strategy for the World Cup because it's a knockout tournament. But I'll focus on that after I complete these two classical events—Norway Chess and the Grand Prix. Probably after Norway, I'll start preparing specifically for the knockout format. Yes, I need to do something different for that,"" says a mother on a mission.In a world with kids learning the Sicilian Defence before the alphabet, Koneru Humpy comes across as a pillar, a mother who seems reluctant to make motherhood her excuse.",Koneru Humpy is India's top-ranked woman in chess.
