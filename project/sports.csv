Taylor Swift Feels The Safest With Travis Kelce



Travis Kelce Has Upped The Security Of His Home For Taylor Swift



Taylor Swift is extremely concerned when it comes to her safety, which made her skip the Chiefs vs Browns game that happened yesterday as she only prefers to attend matches that happen at the Arrowhead Stadium, the home stadium of her boyfriend, Travis Kelce’s team. As per U.S. Sun, a source close to the couple has now revealed that Taylor is planning to move temporarily into Travis’ home in Kansas so that she can be with him as the team will enter playoffs next month.The source, according to U.S. Sun revealed, ""She will be going to Kansas City and staying there for some time during the next few weeks to be with Travis and show him love and support.”This is the same home of the Kansas City Chiefs’ tight end Travis Kelce that was burglarised in the month of October when Travis was away playing for his team, the Kansas City Chiefs. It was not just his home that was burglarised; his teammate and a close friend of his, Patrick Mahomes’ house was also burglarised just a few days later. Since then two more players’ in the NFL have been victims of such burglaries, this also includes the quarterback of the Cincinnati Bengals, Joe Burrow who recently suffered a home break in.Before this incident, as per many reports, a source close to Taylor and Travis had revealed that Taylor was pretty scared after one of her concerts in Vienna had to be cancelled because of a potential terror attack and now she only feels safe when she is with her boyfriend, the NFL star Travis. This also makes sense because now Taylor, who skips away games of the Kansas City Chiefs, is now planning to stay with Travis at his home that was burglarised just recently.Since Travis’ home was burglarised, according to various reports, Travis has put in extra effort to secure his home’s security especially so that Taylor can be at his home in peace. It seems like the burglary and the terror threat to Taylor’s concert has really shaken up the couple. Travis has used modern amenities to secure his home so that an incident like this does not repeat itself and Taylor as well as her belongings are all safe at Travis’ home.Also Read: Taylor Swift decides to miss the Browns game over safety concerns, continuing to attend Travis Kelce’s home games As per reports, Travis had reported valuables worth $100K were stolen from his house. Till now only one of his watches could be recovered by the authorities last month. There are no reports on what else could have been tracked by the authorities. The twin burglary was so shocking that both NBA and NFL had to issue warnings to its players since it was revealed there were international criminal gangs working who were constantly tracking players through their social media.As Taylor moves into Travis’ home for the upcoming matches of the Kansas City Chiefs, it is just another sign that speaks about how much Taylor trusts Travis and how deep they are in love with each other.","Travis Kelce's home was burglarised in October when Travis was away playing for his team, the Kansas City Chiefs.

"""Brady is an idiot"": Tom Brady faces criticism after blunder about David Akers during Steelers-Eagles broadcast",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/brady-is-an-idiot-tom-brady-faces-criticism-after-blunder-about-david-akers-during-steelers-eagles-broadcast/articleshow/116352031.cms,"Credit: Getty Images

Tom Brady’s Commentary Slip: Mistaking Jake Elliott for David Akers Sparks Fan Backlash



The legendary former quarterback-turned-broadcaster had that little occurrence during a game. Brady was commentating on the match between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Philadelphia Eagles when he called Eagles kicker Jake Elliott as David Akers. And that's where all the fingers were pointing at the former Patriot legend.During the clash of the Philadelphia Eagles and the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday, a slip of the tongue by FOX Sports broadcaster Tom Brady became the talk of the town among fans. For the seven-time Super Bowl champion, describing current Eagles kicker Jake Elliott as ""Akers"" by inadvertently confusing the 29-year-old with former Eagles kicker David Akers, who retired in 2013, was a shocker.The mix-up occurred when Brady remarked, “Akers has struggled this year,” before pausing to correct himself, saying, “Excuse me, Jake Elliott.” Play-by-play announcer Kevin Burkhardt chimed in humorously, saying, “Right team, you competed against Akers.” Brady acknowledged, adding, “I’ve had a lot against him, too. That’s the problem, these Philly kickers run together. Fortunately, I played ’em in too many big games and came up on the wrong end of it.”The remark pointed out the moment of the action where he brought the game with Elliott. The Eagles kicker, however, nailed a three-pointer only to have that penalty reversed because of an unnecessary roughness call against the Steelers. Well, Elliott later made up for it by nailing a 41-yarder in the drive.The incident highlights Brady's history with the Eagles. He faced them in Super Bowl as a New England Patriot: Super Bowl XXXIX, when his team won a close game, 24-21; and again in Super Bowl LII, when Jake Elliott and the Eagles won, 41-33, denying Brady and the Patriots' opportunity for yet another championship.Despite his success as a player, Brady’s broadcasting skills came under heavy criticism from fans following the mistake. One fan vented on social media, saying, “I'm so serious, get Tom Brady off any real broadcast team. This guy is awful.” Others joined in, highlighting what they perceived as a lack of preparation and attention to detail in his commentary.Also Read: ""I am truly sorry"": Brisbane Broncos star Ezra Mam apologizes after being fined and banned from driving following Drug-driving crash and guilty plea Some fans pointed out additional errors Brady made during the broadcast. “Listening to Brady, he keeps getting player timelines wrong. Said Akers earlier, now said he played against Minkah Fitzpatrick earlier in my career. Tom's 2x his age. Maybe too many hits to the head???” commented another fan.Another fan said, ""Brady is an idiot for calling Elliott Akers.""Have to say, those comments made by a Brady underscore the entire legacy of the two kickers. David Akers was a franchise stalwart within his time in Philadelphia. Last kicked as an Eagle in 2010. Jake Elliott is putting his stamp down as one of history's most reliable kickers in the league.Perhaps it would be excusable because of Brady's long history in the NFL and his numerous matches with Philadelphia. Yet, fans hope for perfection from the legendary quarterback, regardless of when or where he speaks or plays.","Tom Brady was commentating on the match between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Philadelphia Eagles when he called Eagles kicker Jake Elliott as David Akers.

WWE shares Cody Rhodes’ injury update



WWE has recently revealed their official updated diagnosis of Undisputed WWE Champion Cody Rhodes following the surprising attack of Kevin Owens at the historic return episode of Saturday Night's Main Event . After facing defeat and Rhodes retaining the championship, Owens launched a bone-crushing piledriver on the champion following a sneaky attack when he was celebrating his victory.Undisputed WWE Champion Cody Rhodes has been sidelined from the television by Kevin Owens as he launched a sneaky attack on the American Nightmare following his Saturday Night's Main Event win against the K.O.In a recent social media post on WWE’s official handles, it was revealed that Rhodes has been officially diagnosed with several critical conditions including axial compression of the cervical spine and a cervical strain with spasm. WWE has previously shared that he had cervical swelling but the new report confirmed that his injury is much more serious than previously thought.“BREAKING: Earlier today it was confirmed that @CodyRhodes suffered cervical swelling and was kept overnight at a local hospital for observation. While X-Rays were negative for a fracture, Rhodes has been officially diagnosed with axial compression of the cervical spine, as well as a cervical strain with spasm,” WWE wrote on X.It is unclear how long Rhodes will be away from television but his absence will have a significant impact on the highly anticipated Monday Night Raw’s debut on Netflix on January 6 which advertised Rhodes for the event.Owens, a former pal turned arch-nemesis of Rhodes, has been brutally vocal against the champion. His feud against the American Nightmare started after he teamed up with Roman Reigns to take down Bloodline 2.0. Owens was far from digesting Rhodes’ decision and after Bad Blood 2024 went off the air, he launched a devastating attack to kickstart their feud.Owens’ attack with a piledriver— a move that WWE has banned since 2000 due to high risk of neck injuries— has gotten widespread attention. It has been the talk of the town as Rhodes became the second WWE superstar and Owens’ enemy to be sent to the hospital. K.O. sent his long-time pal-turned-enemy Randy Orton in an ambulance before Rhodes.After the attack, Owens snatched the Winged Eagle title and was showing it off when WWE’s Chief Content Officer Triple H intervened in a confrontation. There was shoving and ssignificant pushing involved as The Game was seen very angry at Owens’ attack.Regardless, the attack has shown Owens’ heel turn to be more brutal and he will continue to do more harm to anyone on his path in the coming matches. And for Rhodes, it is fair to assume that he will take significant time off television to recover from the injury he sustained.",Undisputed WWE Champion Cody Rhodes has been sidelined from the television by Kevin Owens.

He was also a recipient of India’s prestigious Sangeet Natak Akademi Award , among other accolades, underscoring his enduring influence on Indian classical music and beyond.The maestro's passing has left a void in the world of music, but his extraordinary rhythms and melodies will continue to inspire generations.

WATCH THE CATCH

After dropping KL Rahul on his overnight score of 33, Steve Smith came up with a one-handed blinder in the slips to deny the Indian opener a well-deserved century after leading India's fight on day four of the Brisbane Test at the Gabba .Tuesday got off to a dramatic start when Rahul edged Pat Cummins on the first ball of the day but heaved a sigh of relief to see Smith dropping a sitter at second slip.It cost Australia as Rahul added another 51 runs to his and India's score before he tried to cut off-spinner Nathan Lyon off while rocking back on a length delivery and got a thick outside edge that looked like flying past Smith's outstretched right arm before it stuck in his palm.It ended Rahul's knock of 84 and his 67-run partnership with Ravindra Jadeja.India started the day at a precarious 51 for 4 in reply to Australia's first innings total of 445, which included centuries from Travis Head (152) and Smith (101).It soon became 74 for 5 after captain Rohit Sharma (10) fell early in the day, edging Cummins to wicketkeeper Alex Carey.Conditions at the Gabba remained overcast, and the first session on Tuesday saw rain interrupting play briefly.The five-Test Border Gavaskar Trophy is level at 1-1.",KL Rahul dropped by Steve Smith on 33 on day four of the Brisbane Test.

In the high-pressure crucible of the World Chess Championship , it wasn’t just the brilliance of D Gukesh ’s moves that left an indelible mark – it was his unwavering poise under tense situations that etched an unforgettable impression. The 18-year-old prodigy played not only with his mind but also with his heart, fighting every battle as though the board was a stage and he, the lead actor in a drama of unyielding resolve.Yet, it was his demeanour, as much as his daring, that caught the attention of those who observed him up close. Aleksandar Colovic, the Fair Play Officer of the blue-ribbon event tasked with ensuring the tournament’s integrity, noted that his job was made easier because of how well-behaved both Gukesh and former champion Ding Liren were.“They are very similar in many ways – both cultured and well-mannered. They both shook their legs when nervous, but in different ways. They were also very cooperative and kind. True gentlemen,” Aleksandar told TOI.In a world where chess geniuses often arrive wrapped in eccentricity, the Chennai teen has stood apart. Even in moments of extreme pressure, Gukesh maintained an aura of focus. Aleksandar, who observed every move with the precision of a hawk, quickly identified the quality that set Gukesh apart.“Actually, I was really impressed by Gukesh’s constant desire to put up a fight. I think Garry Kasparov or someone had said, ‘In a match between two players, the fighter always wins.’ Gukesh was the better fighter in this tournament. If you look at the games, when Ding was playing with the white pieces, he often avoided a fight. He wanted to be safe – wanted a draw.""But Gukesh wasn’t doing that. He took it to the extreme, avoiding a draw even in positions where he was objectively worse. This characteristic of being a true fighter, not shying away from a challenge, was the main difference that decided the champion,” said Aleksandar, a seasoned Fair Play Officer with extensive experience in events like the Grand Prix and the Candidates Tournament.After the victory, Gukesh praised his 32-year-old opponent, calling him a “true champion” and expressing his admiration. “I would also love to thank my opponent, Ding Liren. He is, in my eyes, a true champion, and we saw that despite a lot of pressure on him, he was able to put up a huge fight. I really admire you,” Gukesh said during the closing ceremony. This graciousness, especially at just 18, added to the impression of a young champion defined not only by his moves but also by his character.Meanwhile, Russian Chess Federation president Andrei Filatov has questioned the way Ding lost to Gukesh, calling for an investigation by FIDE . In response, Aleksandar remarked, “That blunder didn’t come out of nowhere. I mean, this was a long, gruelling game where Gukesh was pressing and pushing, while Ding just wanted the game to end. He was a few moves away, thinking nothing could go wrong, but then he messed up. After almost a month of constant pressure, people crack. That’s normal.”The officer’s role in the tournament was both challenging and rewarding, especially in an era where technology has blurred the lines of fair play. “Players were scanned before entering the play area, passing through different types of scanners to ensure they didn’t have any devices on them or their body. I also ensured no signals entered the glass cube. I really enjoyed it. I knew that maybe I’m becoming part of history here,” Aleksandar explained.","D Gukesh beat Ding Liren to win the World Chess Championship. The 18-year-old prodigy played not only with his mind but also with his heart. Aleksandar Colovic, the Fair Play Officer of the blue-ribbon event, noted that his job was made easier because of how well-behaved both players were.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116330003,imgsize-39352,width-400,resizemode-4/116330003.jpg"

To do it on live television and apologise takes some steel, and you heard it from the horse’s mouth. As far as I’m concerned, game over. People are entitled to make mistakes—we are all human—and in the heat of the moment, like you saw with the Siraj incident with Travis Head , sometimes, when you have a mic in your hand, things can happen. But to own up, to put your hand up and say, ‘I’m sorry if things have gone out of place,’ takes courage. She’s done it, so let’s move on.”Ravi Shastri’s supportive comments emphasised the need for understanding and forgiveness in such situations. His statement suggested that acknowledging and apologising for a mistake is a crucial step towards moving forward.The incident occurred on Sunday when Guha, responding to Brett Lee ’s praise of Jasprit Bumrah ’s bowling performance, referred to Bumrah as the “MVP—Most Valuable Primate.”Guha’s intention was to highlight Bumrah’s significant contributions as India’s leading bowler in a challenging match. However, the use of the word “primate” generated controversy.Guha subsequently issued an apology for her choice of words.“Yesterday in commentary, I used a word that can be interpreted in a number of different ways. I’d like to apologise for any offence caused. I set myself really high standards when it comes to empathy and respect for others,” said Guha.She clarified her intent and expressed regret for her phrasing.“If you listen to the full transcript, I only meant the highest praise for one of India’s greatest players—someone I admire greatly. I’m an advocate for equality and someone who has spent their career thinking about inclusion and understanding in the game,” she added.Guha further explained her background and stressed the absence of any malice in her comment. She also expressed hope that the incident would not overshadow the ongoing Test match.“I was trying to frame the enormity of his achievement and I’ve chosen the wrong word. For that, I am deeply sorry. As someone who is also of South Asian heritage, I hope people will recognise that there was no other intention or malice, and I hope this hasn’t overshadowed what has been a great Test match so far.

Mitchell Marsh pulled off a brilliant catch at gully off Mitchell Starc's bowling.""Leave your image in the dressing room,"" Gavaskar said on Star Sports.""Certain shots are dangerous at the start of your innings before you are set, and you don't have the measure of what the wicket is doing. Keep all those shots in your back pocket. Take them out when you are 30-40-50 not out, then can you get those shots again,"" Gavaskar said.""Not very good shot selection, you could say. It was a very good catch, so there was a little bit of bad luck as well over there. But he could have left that ball alone; it would have gone harmlessly to the wicketkeeper,"" he further added.Gavaskar also urged Virat Kohli to take inspiration from Sachin Tendulkar 's iconic 241 against Australia in Sydney in 2004, advising him to avoid playing the cover drive to overcome his ongoing struggles with deliveries outside the off-stump.""He (Kohli) only needs to look at his hero, Sachin Tendulkar. The way in which he (Tendulkar) had kept his patience and control on his off-side game, scoring those 241 runs at Sydney,"" Gavaskar told Star Sports.Kohli suffered yet another failure as Josh Hazlewood dismissed him for 3, leaving a struggling India at 51 for 4 at stumps on Day 3, trailing by 394 runs.",Former India captain Sunil Gavaskar voiced his anger over the shot selection of Shubman Gill in the first innings of the third Test in Brisbane.

India bowling coach Morne Morkel explains why India chose to bowl first in Brisbane

Here's how it looks:

The Brisbane weather forecast for Tuesday, December 17 , remains grim; but the focus of Indian batters will be on the ball rather than the skies overhead to show some teeth on the fourth day of the ongoing Gabba Test against Australia.India have their backs against the wall with the score reading 51 for 4 in reply to Australia's first-innings total of 445, thanks to centuries by Travis Head (152) and Steve Smith (101), and their 241-run partnership.If it wasn't for Jasprit Bumrah's brilliance, the visitors would have been staring at an even bigger deficit than the 394 runs they trail by at the end of third day.Bumrah continued his one-man show with figures of 6 for 76, but India's batting once again came a cropper. Barring KL Rahul's patient 33 not out, Yashasvi Jaiswal (4), Shubman Gill (1), Virat Kohli (3) and Rishabh Pant (9) failed to deliver the goods.At stumps on Monday, Rahul and Rohit (0*) were at the crease.Like on day one, rain curtailed play on the fourth day, limiting it to just 33.1 overs. And the forecast for Tuesday isn't any batter.According to the local weather department, there is a 90% chance of showers on December 14 in the morning and afternoon.The five-Test series currently stands at 1-1.India won the first Test in Perth by 295 runs, and the hosts drew level with a 10-wicket win in the pink-ball Test at Adelaide.","India have their backs against the wall with the score reading 51 for 4 in reply to Australia's first-innings total of 445.

CM Punk and Seth Rollins had a massive brawl on Raw



CM Punk and Seth Rollins ’ feud is on it has extended on the latest episode of Monday Night Raw . The new rivals have got into a massive fight in the game propelling the officials to break the brawl. The fight started after Punk kickstarted the latest episode of The Red Brand addressing Rollins and his previous encounter with The Visionary.It appears that CM Punk and Seth Rollins have always been ready to fight. When Punk returned to WWE after about a nine-year absence, Rollins was seen as frustrated and after a year of his return, The Visionary finally got his shot at the Best in the World. Punk kickstarted the Monday Night Raw episode of December 16 with a promo directed to Rollins.“I’m feeling a little low. I’m in a bit of a bad mood. It’s because, two weeks ago, in this ring, face-to-face, I told Seth Rollins, after he told me that spends a lot of time thinking about me, I told him that I don’t about him at all. And over the course of the last two weeks, while every waking hour wasn’t spent thinking about Seth Rollins, my mind wanders back to him from time to time. It’s put me in a bad mood. I’m mad because Seth is right,” Punk shared during his promo on Raw.Punk went on to mock Rollins, “And he’s going to tip toe out here, and clogs like the purple pie man from Porcupine Peak, dressed like Liberace, and no, for all of the sensitive people, calling him Liberace is not an insult, I happen to think that Liberace is cool as hell. The point I’m trying to make, Seth, if you want to interrupt me before I make it. Just because you wear Elton John sunglasses, it doesn’t make you Elton John. And just because you grew up idolizing me, putting on a pair of wrestling boots does not make you CM Punk.”The Second City Saint then called out Rollins for a confrontation and The Architect did not take long to come down. Joining the mocking game, Rollins said that he needs a new perspective on Punk, “let me see. No, no, even from way out here, you’re still an a*shole.”After a series of verbal spats, Rollins came down and had a massive brawl with Punk. A Punk and Rollins match has been long anticipated among fans. Following their brawl, WWE has confirmed that the duo, current nemesis, is set to fight in an important match at the highly anticipated Raw’s debut on Netflix on January 6. As they have a spot on the match card for the debut episode of the Red Brand, it would be interesting to see where their feud will lead next.Also Read: “It’s garbage”: CM Punk’s loud criticism of wrestlers using ‘moveset’ echoes his 3-year-old call","CM Punk and Seth Rollins had a massive brawl on Monday Night Raw.

Joel Embiid injury update: the Sixers star has been sidelined for another week



Philadelphia 76ers star center Joel Embiid will miss at least another week of basketball due to his recent sinus fracture. According to a new report, Embiid is now in a recovery process. The news confirmed that the Sixers star will be evaluated again in about a week on Tuesday. However, the head coach recently shared that his injury is not severe. His recovery timeline remains unclear at this moment and leaves NBA fans and the team hoping for a speedy recovery and return.Embiid suffered the injury during Philadelphia's 121-107 defeat to the Indiana Pacers. While trying to grab a rebound, Indiana’s Bennedict Mathurin accidentally struck Embiid in the face. In immediate pain, Embiid collapsed to the floor and had to leave the game shortly after. He did not return to the game which revealed the severity of the injury he sustained. Now, the latest reports suggest that Embiid will not make his comeback for a while as he is undergoing a recovery process.Recently, Philadelphia 76ers coach Nick Nurse shared his optimism on the recovery assuring fans while giving an update on his health. Nurse said, his recent sinus fracture is ""not nearly as severe"" as the two previous facial fractures sustained by the 2023 NBA Most Valuable Player in his career.Ahead of their game against the Hornets, Nurse said, “The only thing that I can compare it to, but I wasn’t here, but he certainly had those other ones that were a lot worse.” He went on to add, “It’s not nearly as severe as those two from what they tell me. So I guess that’s good because those were pretty tough — those two -- and they say it’s not as bad as that.” Nurse further stated, “Listen, it’s hard enough for him to get himself ready to go.”“The knee after the surgery and all that stuff is enough to focus on. This isn’t going to help his ability to condition. He’s going to have to recover from some of this stuff — the breathing isn’t going to be easy for a little bit, so obviously it makes it really difficult. ... He’s just going to have to deal with it. Hopefully he’s getting all of these little things out of the way so he can focus on his recovery of the knee and get back out there for a stretch of games.”The Sixers' star player has been injury-driven. Previously, head coach Nick Nurse shared that he is not certain if Embiid would require a protective mask upon his return.The big man has worn one in the past, during both the 2018 and 2022 playoffs, after recovering from orbital fractures. “I think that’s certainly a possibility. … Nobody’s told me that yet, whether it’s going to be a mask situation for sure,” Nurse said adding, “I think it’s really 50-50.”Embiid is averaging just 20.3 points per game for the 76ers. The sinus fracture adds yet another injury to the long list of injuries that have affected Embiid throughout his career.Also Read: Joel Embiid's injury woes as new setback sparks backlash from fans",Philadelphia 76ers star center Joel Embiid will miss at least another week of basketball due to his recent sinus fracture.

Virat Kohli is one of the greatest players ever: Mitch Marsh

Josh Hazlewood's participation in the remaining days of the Gabba Test is uncertain due to calf soreness. He bowled only one over before leaving the field on day four.Hazlewood's entry onto the field was delayed at the start of play. His bowling appeared laboured, with speeds barely reaching 131kph. His first ball was a wide long hop, readily dispatched by KL Rahul.During the subsequent drinks break, Hazlewood engaged in a discussion with skipper Pat Cummins, Steven Smith, and physio Nick Jones. Shortly after, he exited the field.“Josh Hazlewood reported calf awareness in this morning's warm-up,” a CA spokesperson said. “He will be taken for scans to assess the injury.”Australia, aiming for victory amidst intermittent rain delays, may need to rely heavily on Cummins, Mitchell Starc, and Nathan Lyon. Support from Mitchell Marsh, Travis Head, and Marnus Labuschagne will also be crucial.Enforcing the follow-on offers the best chance of victory for Australia. However, this strategy could strain Starc and Cummins, especially if Hazlewood's absence continues.Hazlewood's return to the side for this Test followed his recovery from a side strain that sidelined him in Adelaide for the second Test. A significant injury could pave the way once again for Scott Boland's return at the MCG on Boxing Day. That venue holds special significance for Boland, where he achieved a memorable 6 for 7 on debut against England in 2021-22.Cummins had previously hinted at Boland's potential involvement in the series.“[We told him] it's about preparing for the MCG because there's a good chance we might need you,” he said.“History suggests there's always some form of natural attrition throughout a Test series. A good thing [is], he's probably played a Test earlier in the series than he maybe thought. Showed that his standard's still super high. [It's] about trying to set him up for the last two Test matches.”Earlier in the year, Hazlewood experienced a mild calf strain. This injury prevented him from participating in T20Is against Scotland and England.Between the Adelaide and Brisbane Tests, Hazlewood expressed his frustration with the side strain. He revealed that the medical staff were exploring long-term solutions.“It's not necessarily your typical side strain, which I've had a couple in my career,” he said.“You're running into bowl and you just grab your hat and you're off and you're out for six weeks. It's not that sort of side strain. It's from sort of repetitive use. It's caused me a lot of trouble over the last few years, but [had] perfect prep this year, and played the Shield game and ticked all that off.”“I was very happy where I was and it still happened. So I was pretty annoyed there for a few days. There was plenty of meetings from CA's point of view [with] physios, doctors, all that stuff. So come up with a few options and see if we can stop it from happening again.”","Hazlewood bowled only one over before leaving the field on day four.

New Zealand secured a resounding victory against England in the third Test at Hamilton, winning by a massive 423 runs on the fourth day. This win provided a fitting farewell for Tim Southee in his last international match.England, having already secured the series win with victories in the first two Tests, were set a daunting target of 658 runs. They fell significantly short, being bowled out for 234 after lunch.England captain Ben Stokes, nursing a left hamstring injury from the previous day, did not bat in the second innings, accelerating the match's conclusion.England's resistance crumbled quickly in the final session. They lost their last three wickets in just 12 deliveries, adding only three runs to their total.Mitchell Santner, with figures of 4-85, was named Player of the Match for his crucial role in dismantling England's tail. This victory marked New Zealand's largest ever win by runs and inflicted England's fourth-worst defeat by runs in Test history.“It's obviously pleasing to finish in that fashion,” said New Zealand captain Tom Latham.Latham praised his team's adaptability after their earlier struggles in the series. He highlighted the significance of adjusting to the Hamilton pitch conditions.“We certainly knew we weren't quite at our best those first couple of games, but I think the way we came in here and were able to adapt to the surface was very pleasing.”Tim Southee, in his final Test innings, took two wickets, ending his international career with 391 Test wickets. This places him second on the all-time list for New Zealand, behind only Richard Hadlee. He didn't add to his six sixes hit on day three, finishing with 98 career sixes.“We're certainly leaving one of the greats behind, but I'm sure he's got a bright future ahead of him, whatever that may be,” Latham added.Despite the heavy defeat in the final Test, England's series victory remains a significant achievement. They became the first England team to win a Test series in New Zealand since 2008.Young batter Jacob Bethell continued to impress in his debut series, scoring his third half-century. He eventually fell for 76, becoming Southee's final Test wicket.Joe Root, a mainstay of the England batting lineup, contributed a half-century, scoring 54 before being dismissed by Santner.Harry Brook, who played a key role in England's earlier victories, could not replicate his success in the third Test. He scored only one run before being caught in the slips off Will O'Rourke's bowling.O'Rourke's delivery, which climbed sharply to find the edge, further cemented his reputation for extracting bounce and movement.Gus Atkinson provided some late entertainment with a brisk 43 off 41 balls. His innings included seven fours and a six.Atkinson's dismissal, caught in the deep off a mistimed shot, signalled the imminent end of the match.“We want to come out and win every game that we play,” said Stokes.Stokes acknowledged the disappointment of the heavy defeat but emphasised the importance of the series victory.“It's obviously disappointing as a team to finish like we have done but ... the first two test matches is where it really counted for us, and that's where we played our best cricket.”","New Zealand beat England by 423 runs in the third Test at Hamilton.

NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer Cheteshwar Pujara on Monday questioned Virat Kohli's technique against the new ball following his dismissal in the ongoing Gabba Test.Reflecting on the incident, Pujara noted that Kohli's approach may not be fully equipped to handle the challenges posed by fresh, moving deliveries.While speaking on Star Sports, Pujara explained that the lacklustre performance of India's top-order batters has contributed to Kohli's modest showing in the current Border-Gavaskar Trophy series.""We were discussing that he has been forced to play the new ball. He has gotten out whenever he has played the new ball. When he played the old ball, he scored a hundred in Perth. So that's also a very big point,"" Pujara said.""His technique is not made for the new ball. His batting should come after 10, 15 or 20 overs. If he plays the new ball, the bowlers are fresh, and their confidence is also high. When they get two wickets, the entire team is charged up. So when you come to bat at that stage, it's not easy,"" Pujara added.Kohli's brief stay in the middle yielded just three runs while India found themselves in a precarious position at 51/4 during their first innings on Day 3 of the third Test at Brisbane. Earlier in the day, the Australian side was dismissed for a total of 445 runsIn the first Test at Perth, while Yashasvi Jaiswal and KL Rahul forged an impressive 201-run opening stand, Kohli managed to notch up an unbeaten century. However, his performance in the remaining four innings has been underwhelming, with a total of just 26 runs, where he failed to reach double digits on three occasions.Pujara observed that despite Kohli's dedicated practice sessions in the nets, he has struggled to implement those techniques effectively on match days.""When the bowling is happening in just one area, on the fourth to sixth stump, and he is playing that and getting out, it's not a good thing. He understands that himself. We saw in the net session as well that he was leaving balls in that area, but that execution is not happening in the match,"" he said.The seasoned Indian batter suggested that Kohli requires a bigger mental adjustment than a technical one. Throughout the current series, all of Kohli's four dismissals have resulted in catches by the wicketkeeper or slip fielders. Josh Hazlewood has claimed his wicket twice, while Mitchell Starc and Scott Boland have each dismissed him once.""In the match, for some reason, he wants to leave the ball but is unable to, and the bat is going there. So he will have to stop himself. He will have to change his mindset. There is a technical part that you are playing a delivery outside off-stump. However, if you have to leave the same delivery, it's not a very big technical adjustment but he needs to make a bigger mental adjustment,"" Pujara said.",Former India cricketer Cheteshwar Pujara questions Virat Kohli's technique against the new ball.

Shubman Gill: 'We will treat it as a three-match Test series'

It was a frustrating morning of waiting in Brisbane as heavy downpour allowed very little cricket on the opening day of the third India-Australia Test in Brisbane. Only 13.2 overs were bowled and the fans got their umbrellas out, put the raincoats on but held on to their beer and enjoyed their Saturday morning, even if it was without any cricket.With the players rushing indoors, the gentleman on the live grill was aggressively dishing out the sausages to the thousands who had come for a big fat party!Amid all this, former Australia cricketer Matthew Hayden 's daughter was casually strolling in the corridor with very little cricket a dampener for her too. The 22-year-old, however, was still up for a chat on cricket and touched upon her love for India, the food and the spices.""I love India. I always heard a lot about India growing up from my dad, he still brings spices home. So I'd always be trying Indian food. I love a dal curry and a roti. Love your roti. Dad would always bring India home to us. So people would always say to me, you know, 'did you struggle at first with Indian food?' And I said, 'No, I love it',"" said Grace in a candid chat with TimesofIndia.com.Having watched a lot of cricket herself on the television, and even from the ground, she follows the circuit very closely and is a big fan of India wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant . It took her half a second to name Pant has her favourite cricketer from this Indian team and it was the youngster's return from the horrific car crash which continues to be an inspiration.""I think his comeback story has been sensational. We saw him go as the most expensive player in IPL history just recently. And yeah, we all saw the vision of the accident, and for him to come back and still start and even make this incredible team is just credit to him. The hard work, determination, mentally that would have been really tough to come back from.

He's definitely an inspiring player,"" says Grace.Pant is definitely a crowd favourite in this part of the world but the same can't be said about Mohammed Siraj. The seamer was constantly booed when he stood on top of his run-up today and even while the series has been a bit low-key on the onfield drama, the Travis Head-Siraj episode definitely injected some fire. Has the IPL, like the rain today, dampened the intensity between these two sides as compared to the years gone by?""I think because the IPL is around, these players are playing together more often.

India bowling coach Morne Morkel explains why India chose to bowl first in Brisbane

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli ’s repeated dismissals outside the off-stump in Australia are a sign of worry not only for the India batting legend but also for the team with the Border Gavaskar Trophy and a place in the World Test Championship (WTC) final on the line.In the third Test of the five-match series at the Gabba in Brisbane, Kohli was again dismissed caught behind while chasing a wide ball and nicking it to be caught by Alex Carey off Josh Hazlewood.Except his unbeaten hundred in the second innings of the Perth Test, all of Kohli’s dismissals in this series have been caught behind the wicket.Kohli's weakness against deliveries outside the off-stump is well documented, particularly early in his innings. This vulnerability has been exploited by bowlers across formats, especially in Test cricket.Kohli has a natural tendency to play expansive cover drives. This can lead to loose shots against balls that are wide and swinging or seaming away, and bowlers often exploit this by bowling a fourth- or fifth-stump line, drawing him into the drive.When Kohli is fresh at the crease, he is more susceptible to deliveries outside the off-stump. His eagerness to get going sometimes results in loose shots.Swing bowlers like James Anderson and Pat Cummins have often troubled him by moving the ball away late, forcing edges towards the slips or the wicketkeeper, when playing away from his body.Bowlers set him up with deliveries outside off, gradually increasing the challenge by varying lengths and movement. A well-placed fielder at gully or a third slip often supports this line of attack.It is here that Kohli can draw inspiration from Sachin Tendulkar ’s unbeaten 241 that the maestro played in Sydney during the 2003-04 tour.It was the last Test of the series, which was level at 1-1, and also the last Test for Aussie legend Steve Waugh. Tendulkar was yet to make a mark in the series and was getting dismissed caught behind the wicket before this marathon knock.Batting first, Aakash Chopra (45) and Virender Sehwag (72) set the stage for Tendulkar, who came up with a master stroke to baffle the Aussies. Tendulkar simply took the cover drive out of his game, refusing to score between mid-off and point and not getting lured by deliveries bowled outside his off-stump by the Aussie pacers. What Sachin showed at the SCG that day was a lesson in batting.In an exhibition of masterful batting that resulted in Tendulkar's third Test double-century and 32nd hundred, Tendulkar added 353 runs with another Australia tormentor VVS Laxman (178) as Brett Lee conceded 201 runs off 39.3 overs and India declared at a mammoth 705/7. Waugh had to bat out of his skin in the second innings to save the game for Australia.Tendulkar's approach in that innings was a masterclass in adapting to challenging conditions and overcoming personal vulnerabilities.The knock was a testament to his mental toughness and patience. By leaving balls outside off-stump and focusing on scoring in safer areas, he neutralized the Australian bowlers and frustrated their plans.Kohli, too, can bring similar patience and discipline to fix his troubles. Tendulkar played within his limitations, showing that adaptability and situational awareness are crucial to succeed in tough phases of a series.Kohli could take a leaf out of this by not allowing bowlers to dictate terms. Adjusting his technique and shot selection depending on the conditions and opposition plans would help him counter his weaknesses.Tendulkar's 241 not out wasn't just about eliminating errors, it was also about maximizing the time at the crease and wearing down the opposition. He displayed unmatched concentration for over 600 minutes, showing that great innings require sustained focus.Kohli, who thrives on long innings, could benefit from doubling down on his ability to bat for extended periods by cutting out risky shots when conditions demand.By following Tendulkar's Sydney approach, Kohli can rise above challenges to deliver match-winning performances in the toughest of conditions.In successful phases, Kohli has shown the ability to leave balls outside off, especially in Tests. His ability to curb his instincts makes him harder to dismiss this way.Though Kohli has worked on tightening his technique, particularly in challenging conditions like England and New Zealand, the bait outside the off-stump remains a constant test for him, as it does for many great batters.","Kohli's weakness against deliveries outside the off-stump is well documented. His eagerness to get going sometimes results in loose shots. Tendulkar played within his limitations, showing that adaptability and situational awareness are crucial to succeed in tough phases of a series.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116359292,imgsize-59512,width-400,resizemode-4/116359292.jpg"

Who could replace Rohit Sharma as Team India's captain in Tests?

NEW DELHI: Rohit Sharma has faced intense criticism following India's disappointing performance in the ongoing third Test against Australia at The Gabba.With Australia cruising at the moment, the pressure has continued to mount on the Indian captain, especially after a difficult Sunday, leaving fans frustrated and vocal about his decisions.India won the toss on Saturday and opted to field, a decision that has sparked widespread bitterness.Fans online were quick to express their dissatisfaction, with some arguing that India should have batted first instead of bowling on a pitch that allowed Australia’s openers to settle in comfortably.The frustration has boiled over, and numerous calls for Rohit's resignation have flooded social media platforms.One fan on X, formerly Twitter, expressed their dismay, writing, “He's just not meant for this job, he needs to accept it and resign immediately after this Test irrespective of the outcome of this match.”The sentiment was echoed by others, with another stating, “Rohit Sharma is on the verge of losing five consecutive Tests. We need to start a serious discussion about his captaincy now, and also sack Gambhir for the betterment of Indian cricket .”Rohit's leadership has been scrutinised during this match, with India struggling to capitalise on key moments in the field.The bowlers, such as Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj, have fought hard, but Australia’s top order, led by Travis Head and Steve Smith , has managed to dominate the proceedings.""Look, I mean, today, I thought Akash Deep bowled really well. He bowled his heart out, as did Siraj. You know, Siraj struggled with cramps early in the day, but for him to keep running in, especially late in the day, and deliver short balls and that new-ball spell was great to see,"" bowling coach Morne Morkel said at the end of Day 2.The Australian batters' ability to bat through 80 overs, with steady contributions from both Head and Smith, has only added to the mounting criticism of India's tactical decisions.As the match progresses, India are on the backfoot, and many fans are questioning whether Rohit can handle the mounting pressure.","Rohit Sharma has faced intense criticism following India's disappointing performance in the ongoing third Test against Australia at The Gabba.

NEW DELHI: Jasprit Bumrah continued his sensational run in international cricket in 2024, surpassing legendary all-rounder Kapil Dev in two significant bowling milestones, further cementing his reputation as India’s finest pacer in overseas conditions.On day two of the third Test against Australia in Brisbane, Bumrah stood as India’s lone warrior with the ball, dismantling the hosts’ batting order even as Steve Smith and Travis Head piled on the runs.He dismissed both centurions and ended the day with impressive figures of 5/72 in 25 overs, maintaining an economy rate of 2.90.Bumrah also accounted for the scalps of Usman Khawaja, Nathan McSweeney, and Mitchell Marsh.This marked Bumrah’s 10th five-wicket haul outside Asia, surpassing Kapil Dev’s record of nine. He has become the first Indian to so do.Bumrah now has three five-wicket hauls in Australia, three in South Africa, and two each in the West Indies and England. By comparison, Kapil recorded five in Australia and two each in England and the West Indies.In SENA (South Africa, England, New Zealand, and Australia) conditions, Bumrah has also eclipsed Kapil, registering his eighth five-wicket haul in these regions compared to Kapil's seven.Bumrah’s latest feat ties him with Australia captain Pat Cummins for the third-most five-wicket hauls in the ICC World Test Championship (nine each). Only Nathan Lyon (10) and Ravichandran Ashwin (11) are ahead.The 2024 calendar year has been nothing short of extraordinary for Bumrah. He is the leading wicket-taker in international cricket, with 73 dismissals in just 20 matches at an average of 13.78 and best figures of 6/45.

'Proper sleep helped us overcome jet leg'

NAVI MUMBAI: Buoyed after their 49-run win over West Indies in the opening T20I at the DY Patil Stadium , the Indian women's team is sweating over the fitness of their captain Harmanpreet Kaur ahead of the second WT20I at the same venue on Tuesday evening.While she scored an unbeaten 13 in India's total of 195 for four, Harman didn't come out to field as vice-captain Smriti Mandhana led the side.""She suffered a niggle on the knee while batting. However, it's a bit early to say that she will be ruled out of the second T20I,"" a source told TOI. At the post-match presentation ceremony, Mandhana said, ""She's doing fine. She is under the observation of the medical team.""Meanwhile, Titas Sadhu, who took 3-37 as India restricted West Indies to 146 for seven in the opening T20I, explained why the team didn't appear to be sluggish despite having travelled n early 7, 300 kilometres from Perth -the venue of their third and final ODI against Australia on Wednesday- to Mumbai. ""The fact that we landed here at night and we slept through the whole night properly, and so that kind of helped with the jet lag,"" Sandhu said.The DY Patil Stadium has been a lucky venue for Sadhu. On Jan 5 this year, the 20-year-old had taken 4/17 to skittle Australia out for 141 and star in India's thumping nine-wicket win over world champions in the first T20I of that series.Having played four out of her 10W20I matches at this venue has naturally helped the young seamer get accustomed to the conditions at a venue where bowling in the night, especially with so much of dew falling around, isn't an easy task.""I think DY Patil (Stadium's) is a very true wicket and whoever is able to bowl in the right areas, get some help out of the wicket. One of the best things was that we have played here before at the same time of the year, so we are accustomed.

'MCA had backed Shaw well'

MCA announces additional prize money for winning bunch

MUMBAI: It was a rebirth of Ajinkya Rahane that few saw coming.Shrugging off poor form in the Ranji Trophy for the past couple of seasons, the 36-year-old batsman was in the form of his life in the 2024-25 Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy in Bengaluru, smashing 469 runs in nine matches@58.62, including five half-centuries, scoring his runs at a fabulous strike rate of 164.56. Relieved of captaincy with the selectors asking Shreyas Iyer to lead the team in the tournament, Rahane batted freely, playing a stellar role in Mumbai's second SMAT triumph in the past three seasons.Opening the innings due to the team's requirement to do so, Rahane raised his game when it mattered the most has scored 98 off 56 balls in the must-win match vs Andhra, 84 off 45 balls in the quarterfinal against Vidarbha, 93 off 53 deliveries against Baroda in the semifinal, and 37 off 30 balls in the final vs Madhya Pradesh on Sunday at the Chinnaswamy Stadium, which Mumbai won by five wickets. In the process, he has also staked a claim to be the Kolkata Knight Riders ' captain for IPL-2025 .At a felicitation function organized by the Mumbai Cricket Association at its HQ at the Wankhede Stadium on Monday, Iyer showered praise on the veteran batsman's willingness to move up from the middle-order to the opening slot to cater to the team's requirement.""Rahane was ready to bite the bullet and he did it. And at the end of the tournament, he became the highest run-scorer, the Player of the Series. So, kudos to him,"" Iyer said, with head coach Omkar Salvi, MCA president Ajinkya Naik and other association officials sitting next to him.""Even though he knew that there were three-four openers in the team, he was okay to adjust. And then when Surya came in, we decided that he would open. So that transition from No 4 to open, some batsmen, they can't adapt that easily,"" Iyer added.When Rahane is in full flow, he's a delight to watch. ""The way he was batting. I mean, standing on the opposition end, the way he was smashing the ball, it was just pleasing to the eye,"" Iyer gushed.Iyer complimented Rahane for the way the senior batter contributed to the team despite losing his Mumbai T20 captaincy. ""Certainly, he has got immense experience we have seen over the years. More than that, I personally feel that he is a great team man. The amount of input he provides on the field and off the field is tremendous. Even on the field, you have to see how proactive he is throughout, running here and there. If the chips are down, he will be the first person to come and give you advice,"" Iyer said.Iyer was also highly impressed by Mumbai's next 'wonder kid,' the talented young allrounder Suryansh Shedge , who blasted explosive cameos at the No 6 spot, including a crucial 36 not out of just 15 balls in the final against MP, and pointed out to the 21-year-old's ""phenomenal work ethic"".""I personally feel, off the field, his (Shedge's) work ethic is phenomenal. That guy is always the first one to arrive at practice, asks a lot of questions. He wants to learn a lot. It's not that he is always satisfied with scoring runs. He has got a great attitude, his approach towards the game is brilliant and I feel that is what is going to take him ahead in the future,"" Iyer admired.Salvi revealed that the MCA was backing opener Prithvi Shaw , who was making a comeback into the side after being dropped from the Ranji Trophy, and the batter would ""peak at the right time.""""I think the association has backed him well. Even though he was not part of the Ranji Trophy, I think the association took care of his practice, his fitness. There were routines given to him for the three weeks to be followed. I think that was pretty much taken care of by the association and the coaches from the academy. We were all very involved in it. And I think he came over there, he took that effort, he did his hard yards over there,"" Salvi said.""And then he came over here in this format, from those preparations. I think he is building up well. I think he will peak at the right time/ That's what we expect,"" he added.Reflecting on what he had learnt from a year in which he experienced a rollercoaster ride-he lost his spot in the Indian team in the Test and T20 formats but captained KKR to the IPL triumph and Mumbai to the SMAT victory, Iyer said, ""The best learning I have got from all these things is to stay in the present. Enjoy the moment. Once I start to think about the future and the past, I am in a cluster.""""I somehow try to blame a certain person, him, whoever is involved. For me, I seek happiness when I am sitting right here talking to you. Stay in the present,"" he added.Meanwhile, MCA president Ajinkya Naik on Monday announced that the MCA will award additional prize money, matching the BCCI's prize money (Rs 80 lakhs) as a reward to the Mumbai team for winning the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy title in Bengaluru on Sunday.It means that the Mumbai team, which beat Madhya Pradesh by five wickets in the final at the Chinnaswamy Stadium, will get Rs 1.6 cr prize money in total after winning the title.In a year in which Mumbai have completed a hat-trick of titles-the Ranji Trophy at home in Mumbai in March, followed by the Irani Cup triumph in Lucknow in October and then the SMAT title in Bengaluru in December, the MCA has been generous in rewarding the winning bunch.","Mumbai batsman Ajinkya Rahane was named Player of the Series in the 2024-25 Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy.

Pace mainstay says bowling unit in transition, Siraj's 'fighter spirit' appreciated

TimesView The Indian top order has floundered again. It's worrying that the batters have displayed a uniform lack of discipline in their approach. Test cricket is hard and none, barring KL Rahul, have shown the will to grit it out. Thanks to rain, the Test can still be saved. But it cannot happen unless our millionaire cricketers from the world's richest board apply themselves to the task.

BRISBANE: India's vice-captain and fast-bowling ace Jasprit Bumrah has dispelled notions that a lack of support from the rest of the bowling lineup has hurt India on this tour and increased his own workload, saying that ""it's my job to help the others"" and that the team is in a state of ""transition"".After becoming only the second Indian fast bowler after Kapil Dev to take 50 wickets in Australia, Bumrah, whose 6/76 off 28 overs helped restrict a rampaging Australia's first-innings total to 445, said when asked about the issue, ""If I come across a problem, I look at how I can solve it, what I can do in this scenario rather than whining or complaining or pointing fingers.""I've been happy with the way the ball is coming out. We don't as a team point fingers at each other. We don't want to get into the situation where we are saying, 'You should do this, you should do that'. As a team, we're going through a transition where new players are coming here. It's not the easiest place to play cricket. As a bowling unit, we're in transition and it's my job to help the others. Everyone will learn through it, get better and eventually find different ways. This is the journey you'll have to go through,"" he said.Bumrah has been head and shoulders above the rest of India's pace lineup on this tour and is currently the leading wicket-taker across both teams, with 18 wickets from five innings at an average of 11.72 and strike rate of 27.33. Mitchell Starc , with 13 scalps, is a distant second, while the next best Indian pacer is Mohammed Siraj with 11 wickets (strike-rate 41.54).Siraj has been copping a lot of flak from the Aussie media following his bust-up with Travis Head in Adelaide and the crowds have taken to booing him whenever he is in action. Siraj also looked flat in Australia's first innings here, but Bumrah said the pacer was nursing a niggle and is in a good place mentally.""We had conversations before we came to Australia,"" Bumrah said of Siraj. ""When we came here in Perth, as well as the last Test, he looked in good spirits. He was bowling well and has picked up a few wickets.""Siraj, however, has seemed frazzled with all the negative attention and even had a brain fade when he swapped bails after a delivery to Labuschagne. ""In this game, I think I'll give him credit because he had a bit of a niggle but still kept on bowling. He knew if he didn't, the team would be under pressure. He's got a fighter spirit the team loves. You wanted to play Test cricket , you are doing that. Your family is proud of you. He's in a very good space, that is what I know of. I don't know what else is happening,"" Bumrah said.Bumrah himself has been nonpareil on this tour, and his stature as a once-in-generation fast-bowling phenomenon is growing by the day. At the Gabba, after creating some early inroads, he came back with the second new ball to take three wickets in 12 balls, drawing batters forward but not bowling driveable lengths, enabling him to find the edges with regularity.After bagging his 12th five-wicket haul in just his 43rd Test on Day 2, on Monday Bumrah added to his tally by getting Starc caught behind. ""It has been good so far,"" he said. ""I find different challenges interesting. Perth was different to Adelaide, and here (in Brisbane) the wicket is at a level and the run-up is low (at a lower level). In India, we're used to straight, level grounds, so it's different. I enjoy these challenges. I always look to find answers.""","India's vice-captain Jasprit Bumrah has dispelled notions that a lack of support from the rest of the bowling lineup has hurt India on this tour. He said that ""it's my job to help the others"" and that the team is in a state of ""transition"" Bumra is currently the leading wicket-taker across both teams, with 18 wickets.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116384373,imgsize-56734,width-400,resizemode-4/116384373.jpg"

On rain-hit day, Indian top order implodes yet again in face of relentless Aussie pace attack at The Gabba

KOHLI'S STRUGGLES CONTINUE

BRISBANE: India sank deeper into the mire as rain played havoc here on Monday.On a bizarre stop-start day which saw the covers being put on and removed eight times, a familiar script played out as the top order made some strange calls and collapsed with next to nothing on the board.In the limited 33.1 overs of play possible, Australia first consolidated their advantage, adding 40 runs in the morning to get to 445. Subsequently, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood did the rest with the new ball to leave India tottering at 51/4 from 17 overs faced.Only KL Rahul, who opened the innings again, played to the situation and adapted to the conditions, made an effort to blunt the new ball and ended the day batting on 33. Giving him company was the edgy and totally out-of-character Rohit Sharma , whose lack of runs compelled him to go down the order again.Australia's relentless pace attack induced silly errors from the other batters and raised the question whether India's Test-match batting is close to imploding on this tour. For Yashasvi Jaiswal and Virat Kohli , in particular, the Perth heroics will now seem a distant memory.India's first-innings collapses have been a constant feature of their last five Test campaigns across home and away conditions. They have crossed 200 only once, against New Zealand in Mumbai, and their highest first-innings total on this tour is the 180 in Adelaide. Will winning the toss and debatably opting to field first change the script here?Australia's top three had shown the way on the second day, but most of the Indian batters who got out seemed reluctant to see off the new ball, bide their time, leave on length and trust their defence. That India had to continuously walk off because of the rain and reapply themselves on this surface didn't help.The stoppages seemed to have made Jaiswal edgy even before India's openers walked out to the middle. He had lasted one ball against Starc in the first innings in Adelaide and was keen to rectify matters.Jaiswal was all padded up with his partner nowhere in sight, then decided to face some throwdowns later as the ground staff were getting the square and outfield ready for play. He was seen playing the flick, and a shot hit a videographer focused on Australia's huddle. Jaiswal immediately rushed to apologize.With the cushion of runs behind them, Australia began with four slips and a gully and one forward square leg. Jaiswal drove hard at the first ball, which was pitched up and swinging away from him, and the outside edge raced to the boundary. Off the second ball, an innocuous half volley, he unleashed an airy flick straight down Mitchell Marsh's throat at forward square leg.The nervous energy had scrambled Jaiswal's brain and he had lasted just one more delivery than Adelaide. This is the third time in five innings that Starc has now dismissed the left-hander, taking Jasiwal's average against left-arm pace down to 17.33 from 9 innings.Next in, Shubman Gill played out three balls from Starc before the bowler had him first ball of the third over, the batter needlessly going for the big drive to a fuller delivery outside off. The edge flew to the left of gully, and it was Marsh again with a fine take. Two loose shots, two soft dismissals, and in walked Virat Kohli.Kohli was beaten on the drive first ball from Starc, was lucky not to get an outside edge to the second ball, then inside-edged one shaping back and managed to get off the mark. He seemed eager to get going but Hazelwood's next over to him was a maiden, the batsman beaten by a fine inswinger third ball.A Hazlewood delivery subsequently strayed on the pads and fetched a single. Another quick single against Starc followed. So did an awkward nothing shot against a surprise short one, with Kohli failing to pull away and fending awkwardly.Next over first ball, Hazlewood baited him with a wider one. Kohli promptly chased after it and found only the edge to the 'keeper. Gone for three, a torrid 16-ball stay ending in all-too-predictable fashion and immediately setting off the alarm bells.Sunil Gavaskar, in the Channel 7 booth, said, ""If it was on the fourth stump I could understand. This was wide, on the seventh, eighth stump. There's no need to play that. He has such a strong bottom hand. He can play straight or towards mid-wicket. He needs to just stop playing towards off.""Others insisted a technical glitch may be to blame, with Kohli's bat coming in from second slip instead of the vertical, forcing the batter to shape up inside the line of the ball before searching for the delivery. Only Kohli will know why he took the bait, and what needs to be done to make amends.Since Jan 2020, he averages only 31.67 as compared to a career average of 54.5. This year Kohli has eight single digit scores, the joint-most in his career since a similar drought in 2014.By now India were in deep trouble at 22/3, and it wasn't to be Rishabh Pant to pull off the rescue act. Multiple rain stoppages later, Pat Cummins tore through Pant's awkward defence for the third time in this series.Only Rahul, who bided his time, played with a short backlift, did not chase the ball, cashed in only on genuine run-scoring opportunities and ended the day with a thunderous cover-drive off Starc, can save this Test now for India. Either Rahul, or the rain, which is expected again on the fourth day.","India's first-innings collapses have been a constant feature of their last five Test campaigns across home and away conditions.

South Africa captain Temba Bavuma will be absent from the opening ODI against Pakistan in Paarl on Tuesday.

These players, Bavuma, Markram, Tony de Zorzi, Tristan Stubbs, Ryan Rickelton, Marco Jansen, Keshav Maharaj , and Kagiso Rabada, are also expected to play key roles against Pakistan.The team management is particularly concerned about the fast bowlers due to recent injuries within the pace department.

Bangladesh's chief selector, Gazi Ashraf Hossain , has voiced his concerns regarding Litton Das 's recent performance dip in white-ball cricket. He suggested a potential break for the struggling batter if necessary.Litton's poor form was evident in the recent series against the West Indies. He only managed scores of 2, 4, and 0 in the three ODIs. His struggles continued into the T20I series, where he was dismissed for a duck in the first match, despite Bangladesh's narrow seven-run win.""We also understand that the team has high expectations from Litton, given his quality as a batter. However, he hasn't been as consistent in white-ball cricket. That's why we kept him out of the playing XI in a decisive match of a tournament,"" Cricbuzz quoted Ashraf as saying.Ashraf acknowledged the team's high expectations of Litton, given his batting prowess. However, his inconsistency in white-ball cricket led to his exclusion from a crucial match.""Currently, he is our T20 captain , and a series is ongoing. I think it's not the ideal time to delve deeply into these matters. But I can say that we are definitely concerned about the way he is getting out. If his batting needs any adjustments in the future, the coaches are there to help, or if he needs a break, that can be arranged. Alternatively, he might make a comeback in the next two matches,"" he added.Ashraf explained that the ongoing T20I series isn't the right time for in-depth analysis. Nevertheless, he expressed concern over Litton's dismissals and suggested potential coaching intervention or a break if required. He also acknowledged the possibility of Litton's return in the upcoming matches.Ashraf expressed surprise at Litton's captaincy appointment in the absence of the injured regular skipper, Najmul Hossain, despite his ongoing form slump.""The selection of the national team falls under our jurisdiction, but deciding who will captain the team is the board's prerogative. Whether it's a short-term or long-term decision, the board determines this based on the situation. That's what happened this time as well. After I joined, I was asked to recommend captains and vice-captains only for the 'A' team and the High-Performance team, not for the national team,"" said Ashraf.""As the chief of the selection panel under the board, I am speaking from my position, which comes with job responsibilities and ethics. Beyond that, I can't comment further at this moment. The board probably made a decision based on some short-term calculations. It's not like the board had many other options either, as several players were injured,"" he added.Speaking from his position as chief selector, Ashraf highlighted his responsibilities and ethical obligations. He refrained from further comment on the captaincy decision, suggesting it was based on short-term considerations and limited options due to player injuries.Ashraf also addressed the uncertainty surrounding Tamim Iqbal and Shakib Al Hasan 's participation in the Champions Trophy. Shakib has faced various challenges, including political issues hindering his entry into the country and scrutiny over his bowling action. He now requires clearance to bowl in international and domestic cricket.Tamim, meanwhile, has begun preparations for the upcoming Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) by participating in the ongoing National Cricket League (NCL) T20 tournament. He has already scored two half-centuries, indicating his readiness after a seven-month break from the game.""I don't have direct answers to certain questions. Regarding Shakib Al Hasan's issue, you are all already aware of it. I cannot provide any clear statements on that matter. The communication process with Shakib is through Cricket Operations. As for Tamim Iqbal, he has resumed playing, which is a ray of hope. I believe we'll know very soon whether he will be available or not. If he is, that's wonderful,"" said Ashraf.""This is a completely different issue compared to Shakib's. In Tamim's case, if someone withdraws themselves, as you know, there was a previous board with differing opinions and several issues. However, under this board, a positive aspect is that Tamim is returning to the field and preparing himself for a major tournament. We are in a position to discuss things with him.""The board and the selectors will sit together to find a solution. Tamim needs to improve his fitness further.

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli 's ongoing struggles with the bat became the huge talking point in cricketing circles with former players and experts weighing in on what it would take for the star India batter to overcome his weaknesses against deliveries outside the off-stump.Former India batter Aakash Chopra also talked about Kohli's perennial problem of getting dismissed on outside the off-stump deliveries. He mentioned that while Kohli had previously overcome this problem, it has resurfaced to trouble him once again.Kohli endured another failure when Josh Hazlewood had him caught behind for 3 on the third day of the third Test in Brisbane.""There is no doubt that there is a problem. It is well documented. The problem outside the off-stump comes repeatedly and starts troubling you. When he had problems on the England tour of 2014, he made changes in his batting, started taking a massive stride, and changed his stance as well,"" Chopra said on his YouTube channel.""He has changed his game a lot. However, towards the end of his career, the same problem is coming again. He commits a slight error of judgment against deliveries outside the off-stump and ends up playing them. In fact, it's not that only. He was surprised by a bouncer and then closed his bat early and almost got caught and bowled off a top edge,"" he added.Chopra also suggested that Kohli may need to avoid playing deliveries outside the off-stump, similar to how Sachin Tendulkar adapted his approach during the 2004 Sydney Test.""You obviously know that he is not at the top of his game. So what is the road ahead? I think there are two things. One, I remember the Sydney Test match after Sachin Tendulkar was repeatedly getting out to deliveries outside the off-stump. Can Virat Kohli do that? He will have to do that because if he keeps getting out like this, the vulnerability is exposed even more,"" he said.",Kohli endured another failure when Josh Hazlewood had him caught behind for 3 on the third day of the third Test in Brisbane.

Rome: Inter Milan are hot on the heels of Serie A leaders Atalanta after crushing Lazio 6-0 in Rome on Monday to demolish one of the division's form teams and send a message to the rest of the league.Reigning champions Inter came through what was supposed to be a tough test at the Stadio Olimpico with flying colours and are three points off the Scudetto pace with a game in hand.Simone Inzaghi's side sealed the points with goals equally distributed either side of half-time from Hakan Calhanoglu, Federico Dimarco, Nicolo Barella and Denzel Dumfries, before Carlos Augusto and Marcus Thuram completed the rout with two late strikes.""It's three-and-a-half years that these boys have given me this level of commitment and I'm proud to be their manager,"" said Inzaghi to DAZN.Inter have an Italian Cup tie with Udinese on Thursday and league fixtures against Como and Cagliari before jetting off to Saudi Arabia, where they face Atalanta in the semi-finals of the Italian Super Cup on January 2.""It's going to be complicated but I hope we put in the same effort and level of performance like the one tonight,"" added Inzaghi.An unexpectedly heavy defeat for Lazio, who came into Monday's showdown off the back of fine away wins at Napoli and Ajax, left them fifth and six points behind Atalanta.Inter statementIt also damaged any ideas of Lazio being dark horses for a first league title in a quarter of a century as Marco Baroni's side crumbled once Calhanoglu rammed home the penalty which opened the scoring in the 41st minute.""I'm sorry for our supporters and I take responsibility for the defeat. We played well for the first 40 minutes but then collapsed, we fell apart"" said Lazio coach Baroni.""We did things that you just can't do against a team like Inter and that means I didn't do a good enough job.""The awarding of Inter's spot-kick, for a Samuel Gigot handball following a VAR check, came just after Inter had had a goal chalked off for offside during the same penalty box melee and angered Lazio.And the hosts, who had been the better side in the opening half an hour, were punished for lax defending when Dimarco volleyed home a brilliant second four minutes later after sneaking in unmarked at the back post to meet Dumfries' pinpoint cross.Any hope of a second-half fightback was ended when Barella crashed in his third goal of the season from distance in the 51st minute and Dumfries capitalised on more poor Lazio defending two minutes later with a bullet header.Carlos Augusto then become the third Inter wing-back to score of the evening in the 77th minute when he expertly controlled Dimarco's pass to spin Adam Marusic and calmly slot home the fifth.Thuram's brilliant individual strike wasn't just a slap in the face for Lazio, it also made Inter Serie A's top scorers ahead of Atalanta and emphatically showed that they won't give up their title easily.","Inter Milan thrash Lazio 6-0 in Serie A.

Manchester City 's Phil Foden maintains that the players continue to support manager Pep Guardiola despite their recent loss to Manchester United , which prolonged their disappointing run.Following Sunday's 2-1 defeat to Manchester United at the Etihad Stadium, City has now lost eight of their last eleven matches across all competitions.City's defense, which has been a recurring issue in their decline, faltered in the final minutes, allowing United to score twice and further diminish the Premier League champions' chances of securing a fifth consecutive title.Currently in fifth place, City trails the league leaders, Liverpool, by nine points, with Liverpool having a game in hand. City has already suffered five league defeats this season, compared to just three throughout the entire previous season.After the game, Guardiola admitted, feeling the weight of the worst crisis of his managerial career, that he is ""not good enough.""Despite this, Foden affirms that the squad remains behind Guardiola, who recently signed a new two-year contract.“We are still nowhere near our level, but I still believe that we are playing good enough to get points and results,” he said.Foden believes City is playing well enough to earn points and achieve positive results, despite not reaching their full potential.He highlights the team's tendency to lose focus at crucial moments, emphasizing the need for sustained concentration throughout the entire match.“It's about remaining focused throughout the full 90 minutes, but we keep switching off at important times. We just need to get the focus right.” he said.He emphasizes the importance of unity, regrouping, and drawing confidence from past accomplishments. Foden underscores the team's continued faith in Guardiola's methods.“We stick together, regroup and believe in ourselves after what we've achieved in the past.” he said.“We keep believing in the process and the manager -- I'm sure if we do that we will get back to winning ways and get back to our level.” he said.City faces a crucial Premier League match against Aston Villa on Saturday, needing to rediscover their winning form.Foden admits to being perplexed by City's sudden downturn, noting the evident impact on team morale following the derby loss.“I can't put a finger on what's going on,” Foden said.He believes their performances have warranted better results but acknowledges a recurring pattern of missed opportunities. He stresses the importance of team cohesion during this challenging period.“I thought the performance was more than good enough to get the result, but we come out with no points, and it seems to be the same story at the moment. We just have to stick together.” he said.He acknowledges the current disappointment within the team but emphasizes the need to move forward.“The changing room is obviously going to be down and sad at the moment, but we can't dwell on this too much.” he said.Following the Villa match, City will host Everton on December 26th and then travel to Leicester for their final game of 2024.With the demanding festive season approaching, Foden urges his teammates to maintain their unity and resilience.“It's about keeping our mentality strong throughout the whole 90 minutes and we're not doing that at the moment,” he said.He calls for the team to display character and overcome this difficult period. Foden expresses optimism about City's ability to rebound and regain their previous form.“We have to go again and show character to come back from this blip.” he said.“It's not a time for moaning, it's about sticking together, remaining strong and going again. I'm positive we are going to come back.” he said.City's upcoming fixtures present a crucial opportunity for them to address their current slump and reclaim their position among the league's top contenders.","Manchester City lost 2-1 to Manchester United at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday.

Ruben Amorim achieved his most significant victory since joining Manchester United , possibly with a sense of relief after making a tough decision. He benched forwards Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho for ""selection"" reasons for the Manchester City match. The gamble proved successful with a 2-1 win, thanks to late goals from Bruno Fernandes and Amad Diallo .Since replacing Erik ten Hag , Amorim has been candid about the challenges at Old Trafford. The win against Manchester City shows his commitment to implementing changes at the 13th-placed club.Amorim has demonstrated a willingness to rotate players, even leaving out prominent names. However, dropping Rashford and Garnacho, two key attackers, from the entire squad was a bold move.Amorim cited ""selection"" as the reason before the Etihad game, with both players training at United's facilities that morning.“For me what is important is the performance in training, the performance in game, the way you dress, the way you eat, the way you engage with teammates and push teammates.”He later clarified it wasn't a disciplinary issue but hinted at expected standards.“Everything is important in our context, the beginning of something when we want to change a lot of things, when people in our club are losing their jobs. We have to put our standards really high, and for that they have to fight for their place in their team.”Amorim emphasized the importance of teamwork for achieving victory.“Today we proved we can leave anybody out of the squad and you can manage to win if you play together.”He stated that everything would be reset before United's next match against Tottenham in the League Cup quarter-finals.“Next week, next game, new life and they are fighting for the places.”Rashford posted a supportive message on social media after the win, while Garnacho remained silent.Rashford's future at the club is uncertain given his inconsistent performance since scoring 30 goals in the 2022/23 season. This isn't the first time the England forward has faced consequences for disciplinary issues.Garnacho, considered a promising talent, has also been inconsistent. His refusal to celebrate a goal against Leicester led to Fernandes suggesting that Garnacho felt fans had lost faith in him.Former United captain and Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville supported Amorim's decision, criticizing Rashford and Garnacho's work ethic.“They've both been poor on the pitch, that's a fact.”Neville highlighted Amorim's statement regarding the players' performance and engagement with teammates.“And Amorim said the selection issue was down to performance and engagement with teammates. That means if they've not been good in the group. That's why they weren't here.”Neville described Amorim's decision as bold and necessary for the club.“What he's done is made a bold call. What he has to do is shake this club to its core.”He emphasized the importance of Amorim building a team that fits his 3-4-3 formation.“He needs to make sure he's brutal with it, really brutal. And he's been brutal today.”Another former United captain turned TV pundit, Roy Keane , viewed Amorim's move as setting a precedent.“It's a big talking point because he's obviously seen things he doesn't like.”Keane acknowledged the players' poor performance as the reason for Amorim's decision.“But for us it's not a big surprise because both players have been poor and he has said enough is enough.”Keane saw this as a clear message from Amorim.“He is putting a marker down. Let's see how they react to it.”","Ruben Amorim benched Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho for Manchester United's 2-1 win over Manchester City.
