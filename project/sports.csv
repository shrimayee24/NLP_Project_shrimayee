Bangladesh seek T20 WC match shift from India after Mustafizur Rahman's IPL exit

A senior Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) official’s comment calling former captain Tamim Iqbal ""an Indian agent"" has drawn criticism from players in the country. Tamim, one of Bangladesh’s leading openers, had advised the BCB not to be driven by emotion while deciding on the national team’s participation in the T20 World Cup in India.Nazmul, chairman of the BCB finance committee, made the remark in a Facebook post.""This time, the people of Bangladesh witnessed, with their own eyes, the emergence of yet another proven Indian agent,"" he wrote.The post received immediate backlash from former and current cricketers, including Taskin Ahmed, Mominul Haque, and Taijul Islam.The Cricketers’ Welfare Association of Bangladesh (CWAB) also expressed concern.""A comment made by BCB director M Nazmul Islam regarding former national captain Tamim Iqbal has come to the attention of the Cricketers' Welfare Association of Bangladesh. We are stunned, shocked, and outraged by it. Such a remark by a board official about the most successful opener in Bangladesh's history, who represented the country for 16 years, is utterly condemnable.""""Not only because it concerns a player like Tamim, but such comments about any cricketer of the country are unacceptable and insulting to the entire cricketing community,"" the players’ body said in a statement.The 36-year-old Tamim played 70 Tests, 243 ODIs, and 78 T20 Internationals for Bangladesh.""We strongly protest against this comment. When a responsible board director makes such remarks on a public platform, it also raises serious questions about the code of conduct of board officials,"" CWAB said.""We have already submitted a protest letter to the BCB president, demanding a public apology from the concerned board director and that he be brought under accountability. We hope the BCB president will take appropriate action as soon as possible,"" the statement added.Bangladesh had written to the International Cricket Council requesting their T20 World Cup games be moved out of India after the BCCI asked IPL franchise Kolkata Knight Riders to release Mustafizur Rahman ahead of the 2026 edition.""Cricket is the life of Bangladesh. A recent comment surrounding a former national captain who has made a major contribution to the game has caused many to reflect,"" said pacer Taskin.""I believe that such remarks directed at a former cricketer of the country are not helpful in the interest of Bangladesh cricket. I hope the concerned authorities will consider the matter seriously and adopt a more responsible stance in the future,"" he added.In 2007, Tamim’s half-century had helped Bangladesh eliminate India from the ODI World Cup in the Caribbean.Former Bangladesh captain Mominul said Nazmul’s remarks were unacceptable.""The comment made by BCB director M Nazmul Islam regarding former national captain Tamim Iqbal is completely unacceptable and insulting to the country's cricketing community. Such behaviour towards a cricketer is in direct conflict with the board's responsibility and ethics,"" Mominul said.""A senior cricketer was not given even the minimum respect; instead, he was deliberately humiliated in public. Such remarks show a lack of even basic decorum regarding where and how to speak while holding such a high responsibility.""I strongly condemn this comment and firmly demand a public apology from the concerned director and that he be brought under accountability. I call upon the BCB to take swift and strict action,"" he added.","Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) official M Nazmul Islam called former captain Tamim Iqbal ""an Indian agent"" in a Facebook post.

2026 assembly elections: Survive or revive? Congress's alliance dilemma in states,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2026-assembly-elections-survive-or-revive-congresss-alliance-dilemma-in-states/articleshow/126451589.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Congress is gearing up for the latest round of electoral challenges in 2026. With assembly elections due in four key states - Assam, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu , and Kerala, as well as one Union Territory, Puducherry - there is a lot at stake for the grand old party. The Congress is the principal challenger to the ruling dispensation in Kerala and Assam, while in Tamil Nadu, it will try to win a second term along with its ally, the DMK.2025 was a disastrous year for the Congress electorally. It could not open its account in the Delhi assembly elections, while it was reduced to its lowest score in Bihar.So, will 2026 see a change in the electoral fortunes of the Congress? Well, it all depends on how the grand-old party negotiates with its “grand-old problems.”And one of the biggest problems of the Congress in recent times has been its dilemma over alliances. The party, which successfully ran two coalition governments at the Centre between 2004 and 2014, has been struggling to get its alliance arithmetic right ever since it was pushed out of the ‘centre’stage of Indian politics by the BJP in 2014.A string of electoral defeats and the simultaneous winning spree of the BJP forced the Congress to join hands with parties that were once its political opponents in several states.And this perhaps explains why the grand-old party struggles when it comes to forming alliances. While on the one hand, the Congress wants to use coalitions to stay politically relevant, on the other, it also does not want to cede much space to the regional partners to ensure that it does not lose its political ground and influence. Torn between these two objectives, the Congress often finds itself juggling between “bullying”, “blackmailing” and “bargaining” to stitch alliances.2026 is unlikely to be any different, as the initial developments show. In Tamil Nadu, the Congress seems to be flexing its muscles with the DMK, with which it has had a stable alliance for a very long time, but is not part of the state government.Congress MP Manickam Tagore had set the stage for this arm-twisting earlier this week when he said that alliances remain the political reality in Tamil Nadu and the time has come to move beyond seat-sharing and initiate discussions on the sharing of power.However, with his statement leading to speculations on the future of the alliance, Manickam Tagore was quick to do damage control and said: ""Tamil Nadu is an important state, and we all know that the INDIA alliance is a significant alliance, with Congress being a part of it and the DMK as its major partner. We have contested eight elections together, as the DMK is a long-term ally of Congress.""Tagore’s remark was the second time that a Tamil Nadu Congress leader had spoken of the party joining the state government. Months ago, Killiyoor MLA S Rajeshkumar had said that the party legislators and office bearers would urge the All India Congress Committee to persuade the DMK to accept ""coalition government"" and allot more seats to the party.So, is the Congress-DMK alliance really under strain? Or is the Congress trying to use pressure tactics to renegotiate its position within the alliance?The emergence of Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) under Vijay as the third regional player in the state’s politics has made the game of alliances in the state interesting.Vijay has had a growing political presence in Tamil Nadu politics and the public response to his meetings and rallies has been impressive. The TVK chief has made it clear that he will not join hands either with the “corrupt” DMK or the “communal” BJP.While the party has kept the alliance cards close to its chest, a comment by its national spokesperson Felix Gerald triggered speculations about its preferences.""The Congress and TVK are natural allies in terms of secularism and their stand against communalism. In that sense, we have always been natural partners. Rahul Gandhi and our leader are also friends,"" Gerald had said.Later, when senior Congress leader and head of the party's Data Analytics Unit, Praveen Chakravarty, met TVK leader Vijay, it added fuel to the fire. While Chakravarty called the meeting personal, it did little to help end the speculations.The Congress perhaps wants to use Vijay’s TVK to increase its bargaining power vis-a-vis the DMK. But it should be careful of the flip side of these pressure tactics.History is replete with instances when Congress has suffered due to its botched alliance experiments.The most recent example is Bihar, where the Congress and the RJD could not come to an agreement on seat sharing even after the date for filing of nominations for the first phase was over. The fallout of this was that when RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav went to file his nomination papers, no Congress leader was by his side. Though the allies did manage to come to an agreement eventually, it was perhaps too late for them to pose any real challenge to the NDA.In Madhya Pradesh, the Congress refused to give seats to the Samajwadi Party, leading to an open war of words between the two parties. SP chief Akhilesh Yadav had then reacted strongly to the Congress’s move. However, the two parties eventually managed to iron out differences and contested the 2024 Lok Sabha elections in alliance in Uttar Pradesh.In Delhi, the Congress and Arvind Kejriwal’s AAP have been in and out of alliance several times. While they contested the 2024 Lok Sabha elections together, in the last assembly elections, they went all out against each other. Analysis of the results later showed that Congress played a key role in the defeat of AAP at the hands of the BJP, facilitating its return to power.In Maharashtra, the Congress has walked out of the opposition alliance Maha Vikas Aghadi and is contesting the civic polls alone. This was after the Thackeray brothers decided to join hands for the BMC polls and also the NCP factions scripted a union of sorts.In West Bengal, which also goes to polls in a few months, the Congress and Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress are allies at the national level under the INDIA bloc, but are bitter political rivals in the state. The two parties have made several unsuccessful attempts to reach an understanding. The ruling Trinamool accuses the Congress, which has been literally wiped out in the state, of being unreasonable in its demand for seats. The Congress, on the other hand, argues that complete surrender to Trinamool would mean that the doors for the party’s possible revival in future are closed forever.Clearly, in many of these states, the Congress seems to be stuck between the devil and the deep sea in terms of its choices. The party’s first predicament is to decide if it wants an alliance or wants to contest alone to start the process of revival. Once it decides on an alliance, the priority shifts to safeguarding its long-term interests by not conceding too much to the regional partner. This often results in protracted bargaining, bullying and even blackmailing. And at the end of all this, more often than not, the Congress ends up having egg on its face.So, the question is: Has the Congress learnt its alliance lessons? Well, we will have answers in the next few months.","The Congress is gearing up for the latest round of electoral challenges in 2026.

Shashi Tharoor Praises Nehru’s Democracy Role, Admits 1962 Errors, Accuses BJP Of Blame Politics

NEW DELHI: Senior Congress leader and MP Shashi Tharoor on Thursday once again appeared to strike a balanced tone. While expressing respect for the country's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru , and calling him the founder of Indian democracy, Tharoor also said it was necessary to acknowledge Nehru's mistakes, adding that blaming him alone for India's problems is unjustified.Speaking at the fourth edition of the Kerala Legislative Assembly International Book Festival (KLIBF), Tharoor spoke on the BJP government's treatment of Nehru's legacy.""I am a fan of Jawaharlal Nehru, but not an uncritical fan. I greatly admire his mind and outlook, and I have deep respect for him, though I cannot support all his beliefs and policies 100%. Many of the things he did deserve the highest appreciation. Most importantly, it was Nehru who firmly established democracy in India... I would not say that they (the Modi government) are anti-democratic, but they are certainly anti-Nehru. Nehru has been turned into a convenient scapegoat,"" he said.Recalling the 1962 India–China war, the Thiruvananthapuram MP said, ""In some cases, their (Modi government's) criticism may have a basis. For instance, the 1962 defeat against China can partly be attributed to some of Nehru’s decisions.""He then turned his focus to the ruling BJP, adding, ""But what they do now is blame Nehru for everything, regardless of the issue.""In recent times, Tharoor's stance and political alignment have come under close scrutiny. Unlike many other party leaders, he does not always adhere to strict partyline statements, often appearing less comfortable with unquestioned loyalty to the Congress high command.Reflecting on his journey as a writer, Tharoor said his love for reading began in childhood due to asthma. With no television or mobile phones, books became his constant companions.He revealed that he wrote his first novel at a very young age, though it was later lost to an ink spillage. His biography of Sree Narayana Guru marks his 28th book.Tharoor also mentioned that while reading habits are declining globally, Kerala continues to lead in reading culture. He said he wrote ""The Great Indian Novel"" in 1989 as a satirical work, a genre that was largely absent in India at the time.Addressing the younger generation, Tharoor suggested that shorter books with fewer pages may be more appealing to readers who struggle to find time. He also fondly recalled his college days at St Stephen’s College, Delhi, remembering a stage production where he played Antony while filmmaker Mira Nair portrayed Cleopatra.","Senior Congress leader and MP Shashi Tharoor spoke at the fourth edition of the Kerala Legislative Assembly International Book Festival.

Shubman Gill press conference: Breaks silence on T20 World Cup snub, and more on his future

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli ’s presence in an Indian dressing room is often felt in moments that don’t make the highlights reel, and a small episode from India’s training camp in Vadodara has once again underlined that side of his leadership. Ahead of the opening ODI against New Zealand, a video surfaced on social media showing Kohli engaging with a local net bowler during an intense practice session, a clip that has quickly gone viral.The incident took place at the Kotambi Stadium on Saturday, January 10, where India were putting in the final touches before the three-match ODI series gets underway on Sunday. After an extended net session, Kohli paused to offer words of encouragement to the net bowler, later signing a cricket ball for him.The interaction came after a demanding practice routine in which Kohli and the net bowler spent close to an hour and a half facing Indian pacers, spinners and throw-down specialists. Fresh off appearances in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, the sessions were designed to replicate match-like pressure, and Kohli appeared fully invested in every detail.During the exchange, Kohli was heard delivering a pointed yet motivational message: “Agar maar padh bhi jaati hai to koi baat nahi, par conviction se, ki main wo ball daal raha hu jo mujhe daalna hai, main wo ball nahi daal raha jo batsman mujhse dalwa raha hai (Even if you get hit, it’s fine.But you should have the conviction that you are delivering a ball that you want to, not the one the batter wants you to bowl).”Kohli arrives into the ODI series in red-hot form.After scores of 77 and 131 in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, he looked sharp against both pace and spin, even though inconsistent bounce from throw-down specialists challenged him in the nets.Now a single-format international player, Kohli skipped Delhi’s third Vijay Hazare match to join the national squad.His recent numbers underline his momentum. Kohli was named Player of the Series against South Africa after scoring 302 runs in three matches at an average of 151. He scored two centuries in the series.Against New Zealand, his ODI record remains formidable, with 1,657 runs from 33 matches at an average of 55.23.","Video shows Virat Kohli engaging with a local net bowler during an intense practice session.

Micah Parsons return and impact on the Packers’ defense

Also Read:

Tonight, the Green Bay Packers will play the Chicago Bears in a high-stakes Wild Card game. The big issue leading up to the game has been whether or not Micah Parsons will be able to play. Sadly for Packers supporters, the answer is a clear noThe star linebacker will not play tonight after suffering a season-ending knee injury late in the regular season. The absence is a massive blow for Green Bay, who brought Parsons in specifically to make a difference in January football.Micah Parsons went down in Week 15 against the Denver Broncos with a non-contact knee injury while rushing the passer. An MRI later confirmed a torn ACL, immediately ruling him out for the remainder of the season, including the playoffs.Parsons underwent successful surgery on December 29 and has already begun the rehabilitation process. While the operation went as planned, the recovery timeline makes a return this postseason impossible.ACL injuries typically require a recovery period of eight to twelve months for NFL players, depending on progress and setbacks. Even in the best-case scenario, there was no realistic path for Parsons to return in time for a playoff game just weeks after surgery.As a result, the Packers will face the Bears without the defensive centerpiece who led the team in sacks and pressures during the regular season.The Green Bay Packers defense will miss Parsons a lot. He had 12.5 sacks in only 14 games this season and was always double-teamed, which gave his teammates chances. One of the main reasons Green Bay made the playoffs and had a good record was that he could interrupt plays without support from the blitz.Without him, the Packers will rely on a committee approach to generate pressure, leaning on rotational edge rushers and creative blitz packages. Defensive coordinator adjustments will be critical, especially against a division rival that knows Green Bay well.While tonight is off the table, the focus now shifts to the 2026 season. Parsons has publicly indicated that his goal is to be ready for the start of next year. If his rehab goes smoothly, a return around September is possible, though the team may choose to be cautious and ease him back early in the season.Green Bay will need to be sharp defensively against the Chicago Bears, particularly without their top pass rusher. Containing the Bears’ offense and winning key third-down situations will be tougher without Parsons’ elite edge presence.",The Green Bay Packers will play the Chicago Bears in a Wild Card game tonight.

How Boston Celtics are Managing Without Jayson Tatum

What to Expect Against San Antonio

Thewhen they face the San Antonio Spurs. Tatum remains sidelined as he continues to recover from surgery on his right Achilles.His absence has shaped much of Boston’s season. With no clear return date, the team has adjusted its approach and leaned on depth rather than waiting for its star to come back.Jayson Tatum tore his right Achilles during last season’s playoffs and had surgery in May 2025. Recovery from this injury usually takes nine to twelve months. That timeline places a possible return around late March 2026 at the earliest, though nothing has been confirmed.As of January 9, Tatum is officially listed as out for the Spurs game. Boston has made it clear that his rehab will not be rushed, even if it means missing most of the regular season.The Boston Celtics have stayed near the top of the Eastern Conference despite missing their leading scorer. Instead of relying on one player, the Celtics have spread the workload across the roster and focused on team defense and ball movement.Boston is not fully healthy. Josh Minott is questionable with a left ankle injury, and Chris Boucher is out due to illness. Even so, the Celtics have continued to compete by rotating players and keeping their game plan simple.The San Antonio Spurs face a Boston Celtics team that lacks Jayson Tatum’s scoring and wing defense but remains organized. Boston is likely to rely on outside shooting and disciplined defense to stay in control.San Antonio’s biggest edge comes inside. Victor Wembanyama gives the Spurs a clear size advantage, especially with Tatum unavailable. How Boston handles him in the paint could decide the game.Also read: NBA Player Props: Best Over and Under Picks to Target on Saturday (January 10, 2026) This matchup is less about star names and more about execution.

Stefon Diggs and Cardi B’s nonstop drama emerges as a growing Patriots distraction ahead of the NFL playoffs despite Drake Maye’s elite MVP form,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/stefon-diggs-and-cardi-bs-nonstop-drama-emerges-as-a-growing-patriots-distraction-ahead-of-the-nfl-playoffs-despite-drake-mayes-elite-mvp-form/articleshow/126404396.cms,"Stefon Diggs, Cardi B (Getty Images)

New England Patriots face growing Stefon Diggs distraction before playoffs

Update:

The New England Patriots are winning games again, but the noise around them refuses to fade quietly. Foxborough has always known how to handle pressure. What feels new is how often football headlines now compete with celebrity drama. Inside the building, optimism runs high around a second-year quarterback who already looks like the future of the franchise. Outside it, the conversation keeps drifting toward social media clips, relationship rumors, and tabloid-style chaos that threatens to pull attention away from the field.That contrast defines this Patriots season. On one end is the wholesome image of Drake Maye’s inner circle, led by Ann Michael Maye, whose viral moments feel harmless and community driven. On the other is a constant swirl around Stefon Diggs and his superstar partner Cardi B, a storyline that never seems to cool down for long. The disconnect tests the calm culture Mike Vrabel is trying to protect.The uncomfortable truth is that the New England Patriots need Stefon Diggs, even when the attention becomes exhausting. Strip away the drama and the numbers tell a blunt story. Diggs was the engine of the passing attack, finishing with 1,013 receiving yards. No other wide receiver came close. Kayshon Boutte trailed by 462 yards, while tight end Hunter Henry ranked second overall with 768.Without Diggs’ explosiveness, Drake Maye’s ceiling drops fast.That is why patience exists where it normally would not. If Stefon Diggs carried a lower profile, the tolerance would likely be gone already. But playoff football is ruthless, and Maye needs a receiver who can flip momentum in a single snap if the Patriots want a legitimate Super Bowl push.The latest Stefon Diggs and Cardi B episode arrived at the worst possible moment, just as the postseason began. The rap icon clapped back at Diggs’ most recent accuser, extending a pattern that has followed the team all year, even after the couple welcomed their newborn son in November. It makes for viral content, not ideal preparation for chasing a Lombardi Trophy.That context made the Patriots’ timing feel deliberate when they released a mic’d up sideline exchange.""I can throw some blocks if you need,"" Diggs quips.""You need to shut the f**k up,"" Vrabel retorts.The exchange came across as playful, almost reassuring. The message was clear. Stefon Diggs is engaged. Vrabel is in control. Rookie lineman Will Campbell later praised Vrabel’s ability to connect with different personalities, reinforcing the idea of unity.Still, even the strongest coaches grow weary of constant off-field noise. As the Chargers loom in the Wild Card round, the Patriots know one thing for certain. Talent wins games, but distractions have ended more than a few championship dreams. Whether this one proves manageable will define how far New England Patriots really goes.Stefon Diggs has received an updated court date ahead of the playoffs. According to court documents, his arraignment has been postponed to February 13. The original date for his strangulation and assault charges was scheduled for January 23.Also Read: John Harbaugh's future: 3 possible landing spots for former Ravens' coach","New England Patriots face growing Stefon Diggs distraction before playoffs.

But the fight never came. Now, KSI has shared the truth. He said he was offered $20 million and even $30 million to fight Jake Paul. Still, he said no.

Money was never the reason he stepped into the boxing ring.KSI said he has already done everything he wanted to do in boxing.

Victor Wembanyama's injury report vs Boston Celtics (January 10, 2026)

How Wemby's knee injury unfolded

What his return means for Spurs vs Celtics

Victor Wembanyama is expected to play tonight when the San Antonio Spurs face the Boston Celtics on January 10, 2026. The Spurs’ latest injury report lists the star center as available, clearing him after a brief absence caused by a left knee hyperextension earlier this month.This game matters for San Antonio. The team has struggled to find rhythm, and Wembanyama’s presence changes how they defend and score. With Boston bringing size and skill into Frost Bank Center, the Spurs will need their best player on the floor from the opening tip.The NBA injury report released on January 10 shows no restrictions for Victor Wembanyama against the Celtics. Earlier in the week, he was still listed as questionable, but that tag has now been removed.Coach Mitch Johnson said Wembanyama moved well during rehab and showed no issues after returning to game action. With no minutes limit in place, the Spurs are expected to rely on him heavily as they try to snap a losing stretch.Victor Wembanyama injured his left knee on New Year’s Eve during a rebound against the New York Knicks. He hyperextended the knee and left the game early. An MRI later confirmed there was no ligament damage, and the team labeled him day-to-day.San Antonio Spurs chose to sit him out against the Indiana Pacers and Portland Trail Blazers. The decision was precautionary, with the Spurs focused on avoiding long-term problems during a busy part of the schedule.He returned on January 6 against the Memphis Grizzlies under a minutes restriction. Coming off the bench, Wembanyama scored 30 points in limited time and looked comfortable moving, jumping, and landing. There were no setbacks after that performance.Without Victor Wembanyama, the Spurs struggle to protect the rim. Opponents shoot about 10 percent better near the basket when he is out. His length and timing make a clear difference.Boston is expected to test him early. Jayson Tatum and Kristaps Porzingis will look to attack the paint and force him into tough defensive decisions. Still, Wembanyama’s size and mobility give San Antonio a chance to hold its ground.Also read: NBA Player Props: Best Over and Under Picks to Target on Saturday (January 10, 2026) Fans at Frost Bank Center are expecting a strong showing, especially after his 30-point return.

Maxim Naumov honors Vadim Naumov and Evgenia Shishkova with emotional performance

Maxim Naumov stood on the ice Thursday night with tears in his eyes and a photo in his hands. The 24-year-old figure skater had just finished his routine at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships in St. Louis, Missouri. But this moment was bigger than scores. It was about his parents.Almost one year after losing them in a deadly Washington, D.C. plane crash, Maxim Naumov skated in their memory. As he waited for his score at the Enterprise Center, he held an old family picture of himself with his mother and father. When the numbers appeared, emotion took over.Maxim Naumov competed Thursday night at the U.S. Championships in St. Louis, where the nation’s top skaters are fighting not only for medals, but also for a chance to make Team USA for the 2026 Winter Olympics.After finishing his routine, Maxim Naumov stood quietly near the boards, holding a childhood photo of himself with his parents. When his score of 85.72 flashed on the screen, he covered his face and cried.For a moment, the crowd fell silent. Then came applause. His parents, Vadim Naumov and Evgenia Shishkova, were both former figure skaters.They were among the 67 people who died on January 29, 2025, when a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter collided mid-air with an American Airlines plane near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.After the crash, Maxim Naumov shared that his parents had changed flights at the last minute while returning from the 2025 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Wichita, Kansas.Thursday’s skate was not perfect, but it was powerful. Maxim Naumov briefly held first place before later dropping to fourth by the end of the night.Only three skaters will make the Olympic team, but he is still in the running and will compete again this weekend. Speaking after his performance, Maxim Naumov opened his heart about what keeps him going.“I mean, it’s the ultimate goal,” Maxim Naumov said when asked about the Olympics in Milan.“My parents and I, one of our last conversations, was exactly about that. It would mean the absolute world for me to do it,” he continued. “It’s what I think about first thing in the morning and when I shut my eyes.”The championship marks nearly one year since the crash that took his parents’ lives. That tragedy was the first major U.S. commercial passenger plane crash since 2009, according to federal aviation records.Since then, Maxim Naumov has stayed in the sport his parents loved. Friends in the skating world say he trains almost every day, keeping their memory close.On Thursday night, it showed. His skate was not just about jumps and spins. It was about love, loss, and a son still chasing the dream he once talked about with his mother and father.Also Read: Dana White Drops Bold Verdict On UFC’s Greatest Rivalry And It’s Not Khabib Nurmagomedov Vs Conor McGregor","Maxim Naumov skated in his parents' memory at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships.

Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman’s release from the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) squad for the IPL 2026 season has led to a dispute between the cricket boards of India and Bangladesh.Mustafizur, who was bought for Rs 9.20 crore at the auction last month, was released from the squad, a move that upset the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB).

Wasim Akram, Nikhil Chopra on the evolution of UAE Cricket during ILT20 Season 4

NEW DELHI: Wasim Akram stole the show during the Pakistan Super League ’s franchise auction on Thursday, turning the high-stakes bidding war into a moment of levity with his trademark wit.As the PSL officially added two new teams ahead of the 2026 season, Akram — who conducted the auction — kept the atmosphere light even as millions were at stake. At one point, spotting a hesitant bidder, the Pakistan great quipped: ""Balance toh khatam nahi ho gaya?"", drawing laughter from those present. Several journalists and social media users later identified the potential bidder as representatives of Jazz, Pakistan’s leading telecom service provider, who ultimately did not place a bid.The auction concluded with two successful bids, expanding the PSL to eight teams. OZ Developers, a real estate consortium, secured the Sialkot franchise for Rs 1.85 billion ($6.55 million/INR 58.38 crore), while US-based FKS Group won the Hyderabad team for Rs 1.75 billion ($6.2 million/INR 55.57 crore). Overall, the two franchises fetched $12.75 million (approximately INR 114 crore).The new teams will join the league when the next season begins on March 26.Multan Sultans, meanwhile, will be operated by the Pakistan Cricket Board for the upcoming season before being put up for sale after the PSL concludes in April.Former owner Ali Tareen, who had public differences with the PSL management, was eligible to bid but pulled out at the last moment from a pool of 10 approved bidders.Akram’s presence at the auction came amid recent debate sparked by his comments on league durations. Speaking at a PSL promotional event, the former fast bowler praised the league’s shorter window and took a swipe at longer tournaments.""The best thing about the league is that it is played for only about 34-35 days, maybe a little more next year. It's not like three months, like the other league. Bacchey bade ho jate hain, woh league khatam hi nahi hoti. Foreign players, when they come to Pakistan, prefer to be here for 35-40 days. More than that - two-and-a-half to three months - is a bit too long for everyone. Even I get bored,"" Akram said.He also cited Australia’s Big Bash League as an example of why shorter leagues work better.""Prime example is the BBL. They started off with two-and-a-half months. They realised after four or five years it wasn't working. Now their duration is about 40 days. That's it. That's the beauty of the PSL. Of course, the talent. Everybody overseas, when I talk to them, they talk about bowling in the IPL and other leagues. They say the PSL, as far as talent is concerned, is definitely No. 1 because we have quality, not quantity,"" he added.Akram’s comments triggered mixed reactions online, with many fans criticising the comparison — particularly given his long association with the Indian Premier League as both a coach and commentator.","Wasim Akram steals the show during the Pakistan Super League's franchise auction.

Dana White says Jon Jones and Daniel Cormier rivalry tops all others

Dana White has seen almost every big fight in UFC history. From wild press conferences to sold-out arenas, the UFC CEO has watched rivalries grow, explode, and change the sport. But when he was recently asked to name the greatest UFC rivalry ever, Dana White did not pick the famous feud between Khabib Nurmagomedov and Conor McGregor.Instead, Dana White said the rivalry that stands above all others is Jon Jones vs Daniel Cormier. He shared his thoughts while talking about past UFC moments, pointing to their long history of tension, real anger, and unforgettable scenes both inside and outside the cage.During a recent media conversation in the United States, Dana White was asked which rivalry meant the most to him as UFC president. His answer was quick and clear.“It would absolutely be those two,” Dana White said, speaking about Jon Jones and Daniel Cormier. Their rivalry began long before they ever touched gloves.They argued in interviews, exchanged sharp words at press events, and even had a heated moment at a hotel in Las Vegas that became one of the most replayed clips in UFC history.Their first fight happened at UFC 182 in January 2015, where Jon Jones beat Daniel Cormier by decision after five tough rounds.Two years later, they met again at UFC 214 in July 2017, where Daniel Cormier was knocked out. That result was later changed to a no-contest after a failed test.Dana White said moments like those are why their rivalry still stands out. “When you are there, you are not there for pictures,” Dana White explained.“You are there to make sure they do not touch. Once someone feels disrespected, things can move fast.”White made it clear that the emotion between Jon Jones and Daniel Cormier was always real, not forced. Even years after their last UFC fight, the rivalry is still alive.In late 2025, Jon Jones and Daniel Cormier appeared on a Russian reality television show, where old feelings came back.During filming, the two were seen arguing again. Daniel Cormier later claimed they even talked about the idea of a third match, possibly in wrestling or boxing.After the show, Jon Jones spoke publicly about the experience. He said he once hoped to fix things between them. But now, he feels their relationship may never change.Jon Jones explained that while there were small moments where they laughed, most of the time the tension stayed.He added that the rivalry has followed them for years and still feels personal. Fans reacted quickly online. Many said Dana White’s comments made sense.While Khabib Nurmagomedov vs Conor McGregor created huge global attention and led to chaos at UFC 229 in October 2018, some believe Jon Jones vs Daniel Cormier had a deeper, longer-lasting story.With both fighters now away from full-time competition, their feud remains one of the most talked-about in UFC history.And for Dana White, no rivalry has ever matched what Jon Jones and Daniel Cormier brought to the sport.Also Read: Ilia Topuria Speaks Out After Court Hearing And Gives Hopeful Update On Daughter With Giorgina Uzcategui Badell",Dana White says Jon Jones and Daniel Cormier rivalry tops all others.

Andy Reid and teammates say Travis Kelce’s energy has always been real

With Travis Kelce openly weighing retirement, the conversation around his future in Kansas City has shifted. It’s no longer just about what he can still do on the field. According to multiple Chiefs players and coaches speaking recently, Kelce’s importance to the franchise runs much deeper, rooted in the behind-the-scenes leadership that has defined his 13 seasons in Kansas City.Chiefs head coach Andy Reid has often described Kelce’s personality as big and expressive, once joking that he was a “wild pony” early in his career. But that energy, teammates say, has never faded or been performative.Defensive tackle Chris Jones recalled how Kelce set the tone at practice when Jones entered the league in 2016, dancing between reps and catching everything thrown his way. Jones said that energy was contagious and pushed others to match it, even in routine practices.One of the strongest examples of Kelce’s off-field impact comes from running back Clyde Edwards-Helaire, who has spoken openly about dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder related to gun violence earlier in his life.Edwards-Helaire said Kelce was one of the few teammates who consistently noticed when something was off and checked in with him during difficult moments. He described Kelce as someone who paid attention when others didn’t, not as a star player but as a trusted presence in the locker room.Kelce’s reach inside the Chiefs organization extends far beyond stars. Center Creed Humphrey credited him with carrying the cultural torch inside the locker room, while reserve linebacker Cole Christiansen shared how Kelce went out of his way to make him feel valued when he was named a game captain.Defensive lineman Malik Herring, who spent much of his rookie season rehabbing a torn ACL as an undrafted free agent, said Kelce regularly checked on him during rehab. Herring explained that attention from a franchise cornerstone helped him believe he belonged in the NFL.Kelce’s influence has also crossed team lines. Tight end Robert Tonyan previously said Kelce reached out to him with encouragement during a breakout season in Green Bay, a rare gesture in a league where competition often outweighs connection. Tonyan later joined the Chiefs and described Kelce as the same person off the field as he appears on it.When Kelce eventually steps away, Kansas City won’t just be replacing a tight end. Players and coaches have made it clear they’ll be losing a connector, someone who bridged position groups, experience levels, and personalities.His production can be measured. His presence cannot.Also read - Rashee Rice and Rubi Rose spark dating rumors after being spotted together at the gym","Travis Kelce is weighing his future with the Kansas City Chiefs.

Toronto’s Injury Concerns

Game Time and Outlook

when theface the Toronto Raptors on. The Celtics forward remains out as he continues to recover from an Achilles injury that has kept him off the floor for most of the season.There was no expectation of a return for this game, and Boston has confirmed his status as out. The team has adjusted to life without its top scorer and will rely on the same rotation that has carried them through recent weeks.Jayson Tatum suffered a torn Achilles during last season’s playoffs and underwent surgery in May 2025. Recovery from this type of injury usually takes nine to twelve months. That timeline puts any possible return closer to late March 2026, and even that remains uncertain.For Friday night at TD Garden, Tatum is unavailable. Josh Minott will also miss the game due to an ankle injury, further thinning Boston’s depth.Boston Celtics have stayed competitive despite losing its main offensive option. Jaylen Brown has taken over as the focal point and is averaging a career-high 30 points per game.The roster looks different after offseason trades involving Kristaps Porzingis and Jrue Holiday, but the current group has found consistency.The expected starting lineup includes Payton Pritchard, Derrick White, Brown, Sam Hauser, and Neemias Queta. The group has played with balance and has performed better than many expected before the season.Toronto enters the game with issues of its own. Jakob Poeltl is out with a back problem. Scottie Barnes is dealing with a knee injury, while Brandon Ingram is questionable because of a thumb issue.RJ Barrett is expected to lead the offense after a recent game against Charlotte, though he will face pressure from Boston’s perimeter defenders throughout the night.The game is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. ET and will air on Sportsnet.

Read David Ellison's full memo to employees here:

Team Paramount,

As we wrap up our first week back together in our LA and NY offices, I want to thank each of you for your dedication, professionalism, and teamwork. I know that returning to the office full-time has been an adjustment for many, and I truly appreciate the flexibility and commitment you've shown.

The positive energy and increased productivity that come from being together in-person are already evident, and it's great to see.

A special thank you to our RTO Task Force and all the teams involved for their hard work behind the scenes to prepare for our return and to ensure the transition was smooth and welcoming for everyone.

It's hard to believe we launched the new Paramount just five months ago, and in that short time we haven't just set a strategy — we've acted on it.

In the process, we've made real and meaningful progress against our North Star priorities. From day one, our goal has been clear: to transform Paramount for the future by championing great storytellers, investing in world-class technology, and making bold, thoughtful moves that position us to help define the next era of entertainment.

That's exactly what we've been doing — and it's what we'll continue to do together.

While the coming year will bring its share of challenges, it will also be exciting. We've set ambitious goals, and we're confident we have the strategy, the momentum, and — most importantly — the team to achieve them. Your expertise, resilience, and commitment give me tremendous confidence in what we can accomplish. I am grateful for your efforts and incredibly proud to work alongside you.

Thanks again for a great first week back together. Let's go!

Best,

David

Fortnite servers down: Here's why this major update is the reason,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/gaming/fortnite-servers-down-heres-why-this-major-update-is-the-reason/articleshow/126433892.cms,"Fortnite services that won’t be available during the downtime

Fortnite is getting a South Park update: What we know so far





Fortnite servers are now offline. The popular Epic Games title is experiencing downtime for scheduled maintenance as the v39.20 update rolls out. The official maintenance window is expected to run from 09:00 UTC to 11:00 UTC. Based on previous updates, the downtime typically lasts three to four hours, though Epic Games has not confirmed an exact end time.If the rollout follows past patterns, servers may come back online between 5:00 AM and 8:00 AM ET (6.30 PM IST), depending on how the deployment and post-maintenance checks progress. Players cannot access matchmaking or gameplay during the maintenance period. Fortnite was one of the most played games in 2025.While the servers are down for maintenance, players cannot use matchmaking to find games. All game modes will remain unavailable, and players will not be able to log in to the game's online services.Once Epic Games finishes installing the update, access to the game will return automatically. Players should be able to log in and play normally again.The upcoming update brings a South Park collaboration to the game. This includes new skins and items, a free Mini Pass connected to the event, and map changes that add Cartmanland and other new locations.The update also adds a five-player mode available for a limited time and removes the remaining Winterfest content.The new five-player mode will start in less than 24 hours and will stay in the game until February 5. The collaboration includes skins of South Park characters Cartman, Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Butters, who will wear special robot-style suits. The update also adds a new area, Cartmanland, and a ""Stick of Truth"" item players can find and use during matches.Many fans expected the five-player squad mode to arrive when Chapter 7 started, but Epic Games decided to launch it with this event instead. The update will be available to all players after a short server maintenance period.The update introduces a five-player squad mode called ""Quints"". It's not yet clear whether this larger team size will work across all game modes, such as Battle Royale, Zero Build, and Fortnite OG. Epic may be testing it to see how players react before making it permanent.The official trailer uses South Park's animation style. In it, the four main characters leave Butters sitting alone in a game lobby because he ""lowkey"" sucks at Fortnite. Wearing his Professor Chaos costume, Butters uses the Stick of Truth to turn the South Park school bus into a Battle Bus, bringing everyone into the Fortnite world. This prompts the group to add him as their fifth squad member, introducing the new Quints feature.Epic is making the Born in Chaos pass free, unlike previous mini passes, which charged. However, the South Park character skins won't be included in the pass and must be bought separately from the in-game shop. The event includes Towelie as a sidekick and a Cartmanland area with hidden surprises.This crossover comes after other recent Fortnite collaborations with Kill Bill, Kim Kardashian, and Percy Jackson.Epic Games will share full details of the update after the servers come back online. The company usually reopens servers shortly after maintenance ends, then posts on social media to let players know everything is working. Players can check official Fortnite channels for confirmation that the game is back up.Once the servers are online, all v39.20 content will be available immediately across all platforms.","Fortnite servers are offline for scheduled maintenance as the v39.20 update rolls out.

"Dream audaciously, for sky was never the limit, not for you, not for India: Shubhanshu Shukla",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/dream-audaciously-for-sky-was-never-the-limit-not-for-you-not-for-india-shubhanshu-shukla/articleshow/126461297.cms,"





PUNE: On his first evening back on Earth after returning from the International Space Station (ISS), Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla sat down to an entirely ordinary task - answering emails. After responding to a torrent of messages, he pushed his laptop aside, causing it to drop, instantly remembering of gravity.""That's when I realised how powerful the human mind is. It adapts to its surroundings. Space doesn't just transform the body. It rewires perception,"" he said, while sharing his journey to the ISS and back with a spellbound audience of children, teenagers and adults at the India Science Festival at IISER Pune on Saturday.Coming from a modest background, Shukla was commissioned into the IAF in 2006. His space mission marked India's return to human spaceflight 41 years after Rakesh Sharma's historic voyage in 1984. ""The next time won't take as long. We will launch from India, on an Indian rocket, in an Indian capsule and bring our astronaut back safely,"" he said.The audience watched in awe as Shukla showed visuals from space - the Earth's curved horizon glowing green due to oxygen atoms in the upper atmosphere, a brilliantly illuminated India coming into view, the sweep of the Himalayan range, flashes of purple lightning storms, a star-filled sky and finally, a radiant blue sunrise.""Beautiful, isn't it?"" he asked. ""Now imagine seeing this view 16 times every day. It changes how you look at everything,"" he said.Recounting the launch, Shukla said the experience shattered all preconceived notions. ""The moment the engines ignited, everything I thought I knew disappeared. The vibration was so intense that every bone in the body shook. In just eight-and-a-half minutes, we went from zero to 28,500km per hour,"" he said.On the affects of the extreme G-forces, he said: ""You can't inhale, only exhale. You breathe using your stomach. That's why years of training are essential before spaceflight.""Then, suddenly, the engines cut off and silence filled the cabin. The crew had entered microgravity. ""Your body lifts off the seat. Hands and legs float. We release a small toy to confirm weightlessness. That moment tells you. You're in space,"" he said.On his first day, Shukla found himself unable to cross a module because another astronaut was conducting an experiment in the centre. ""I didn't realise I could simply walk on the ceiling. That was the moment my mind truly understood space,"" he said.His body underwent dramatic changes too. Fluids shifted towards the head, his face became swollen, his movements slowed initially, muscles weakened, appetite diminished and his spine elongated - making him 6cm taller temporarily. ""Space presents us with problems humanity has never faced before. And learning to solve them helps us improve life on Earth,"" he said.Shukla admitted that life in space brought an unexpected sense of calm, and for a moment, he even wished he wouldn't have to return. The journey back, however, proved just as demanding as the launch. After days in microgravity, his body had forgotten how much effort it took simply to stand upright. Walking became difficult and it took days of rehabilitation before he could resume normal activities.He described the mission as only the beginning of India's human spaceflight ambitions. ""We have the Gaganyaan missions, plans for a space station and a targeted human landing on the Moon by 2040,"" he said. ""Who knows, one of you sitting here today could be the first Indian to walk on the Moon. So dream big. Dream audaciously. Because the sky was never the limit, not for me, not for you and not for India,"" he added as the hall erupted in thunderous applause.","Shubhanshu Shukla was commissioned into the IAF in 2006.

Nick Cassidy shares his plans after winning the Mexico City E-Prix

How Nick Cassidy’s win at Mexico City came through



Nick Cassidy has won the Mexico City E-Prix and may soon be going bald to fulfil a deal he made with his Citroen Racing teammate Jean-Eric Vergne. After taking third place in his debut race for Citroen Racing in Sao Paulo, the New Zealander won the much-anticipated Mexico City E-Prix on Saturday. He is aware of the trend of Mexico race winners also clinching the Formula E title and therefore promised to shave his head if he won at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez this time.Nick Cassidy’s win in Mexico is his fourth win in five consecutive Formula E races. The elated 31-year-old revealed after the race, “I made a deal with JEV [Jean-Eric Vergne] on Thursday that if I won, I’d shave my head. There’s a statistic that whoever wins this race wins the championship, so I wasn’t giving that one up. If we win the championship, I’ll shave my head anyway!”Cassidy showed immense courage by starting from 13th position and going on to beat polesitter Sebastien Buemi and all others to clinch his first win and second podium for Citroen Racing. Edoardo Mortara and Oliver Rowland finished second and third in the race, respectively.Speaking after winning the first race of the new year, Nick Cassidy said, “This is unbelievable! In front of all these amazing fans, this atmosphere is second to none in Formula E, so to get a win here with Citroen, what a dream start we’ve had. I’m just so happy for my team and thanks to them for believing in me, for bringing me in to be part of this project.I think there are some really cool times ahead. What a moment.”Nick Cassidy made the best use of Formula E's two 50kW, all-wheel-drive Attack Mode power boosts at the right time to win the race. Giving all the credit to his race engineer, he said, “I didn’t think until the last lap that we were okay. I was happy with P4 today, starting from P13. My radio was very much like, ‘Let’s secure a good result,’ but my engineer has always been making the right calls. This one is very much for him as it is for me and the whole team. It’s the team, the car, the package and the strategy that enabled us to win that race. You can’t win this race with a bad car.”As a result, Cassidy now leads the Drivers’ Standings with 40 points. Andretti’s Jake Dennis, who won the Round 1 race in Mexico, is in second with 36 points.Also read: Mexico City E-Prix 2026: Nick Cassidy storms to maiden Citroen Racing victory, Edoardo Mortara and Oliver Rowland join him on podium","Nick Cassidy has won the Mexico City E-Prix for Citroen Racing.

Twitch ban halts Drututt’s momentum as League of Legends season draws massive attention,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/twitch-ban-halts-drututts-momentum-as-league-of-legends-season-draws-massive-attention/articleshow/126460412.cms,"League of Legends streamer Drututt was hit with a seven-day Twitch ban just days after the new season launched. The suspension followed his use of a controversial hashtag, which he says was self-directed humor, not exclusionary. Fans are split over Twitch’s decision, especially as the ban disrupts his momentum during peak interest and a key competitive announcement.

Why the hashtag ban is dividing the League community





Just days into the new season of League of Legends, controversy has once again followed one of its most outspoken creators. Popular streamer Drututt found himself locked out of Twitch at the worst possible moment, right as fans were flooding streams to understand sweeping gameplay changes. The timing could not have been harsher, and the reason behind the ban has sparked fierce debate across the community.This is not unfamiliar territory for Drututt, whose confrontational humor and rule-testing style have often placed him under the platform’s microscope. Still, many viewers argue this latest suspension crossed into overreach. The ban landed shortly after he announced his role in a new competitive roster and while interest in his Challenger-level insights was peaking. For a creator whose content thrives on momentum, even a short absence carries weight.According to Drututt, the seven-day suspension stemmed from his use of the “NOWOMEN” hashtag during a stream. He insists the phrase was not aimed at anyone else but himself, paired with other self-deprecating tags while he played an off-meta ranged champion in the top lane. In his view, the joke centered on League culture and his own reputation, not exclusion or insult.Context has become the core of the argument. Supporters say Twitch failed to consider intent, while critics counter that moderation must prioritize impact over explanation. This clash highlights a larger issue that creators face when humor collides with automated enforcement.The ban also arrives as Drututt prepares for competition in the Northern League of Legends Championship, where his newly announced team, 4 Swines & a Bum, is set to debut. With fellow high-profile streamers involved, visibility matters. A temporary ban may not derail his career, but it does underline how fragile creator momentum can be.When the suspension is lifted, Drututt should come back to his loud and more observable than ever. It is not clear whether Twitch will change its strategy, but the debate on fairness, circumstances, and expression of creators is not diminishing.","League of Legends streamer Drututt was hit with a seven-day Twitch ban just days after the new season launched.

“Good and stable”: Konvy breaks silence after terrifying livestream shooting in New York City,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/good-and-stable-konvy-breaks-silence-after-terrifying-livestream-shooting-in-new-york-city/articleshow/126460313.cms,"Konvy spoke out after a frightening livestream shooting in New York City where six shots struck a vehicle he was in. Konvy was unharmed, but a friend was grazed and hospitalized before being declared stable. Fellow streamer Adin Ross confirmed the incident was real as Konvy later thanked supporters and expressed gratitude for everyone’s safety.

Konvy thanks God as friend recovers after shooting





An almost tragic live stream in New York City caused a shock to the online streaming community. What started as light entertainment, soon turned into a real life threat where shots were fired as the cameras continued to roll. The event shocked the audiences and brought new questions on security as producers keep losing the distinction between real life and live shows.For Konvy, the scare was deeply personal. The 22 year old streamer, whose real name is Steven Garcia, was inside a vehicle with friends when shots rang out in the Bronx. While he escaped unharmed, the gravity of the moment lingered long after the stream ended. Six bullets reportedly struck the vehicle, forcing everyone inside to duck for cover in seconds that felt far longer.The situation drew immediate attention from Adin Ross, who contacted Konvy during his own livestream. Ross made it clear that the incident was real and serious, telling his audience, “It got confirmed to me that it's real...I made sure to know it was real. It's a real situation, it's not no bullshit, it's not no fake shit, it's not no fucking script shit. This is real.”One of the passengers who sat next to Konvy, a man named JJ was wounded in the shooting and was subjected to hospital. The following day, Konvy provided an emotional update on X that shifted the priorities on fear to gratitude. He wrote, “I wanna thank God for keeping us protected thru out the whole situation my friend got grazed but he is good and stable 🙏🏼. I appreciate all the people checking up im tryna get back to everyone ❤️”The message resonated quickly. Fans flooded social media with support, leaving well wishes on JJ’s Instagram page and praising Konvy for speaking openly during a difficult moment.JJ did not personally comment on the incident, but the update provided some relief to the followers who were able to observe the events in real time.Other than the immediate shock, the shooting has provided a new impetus to the debate on the dangers streamers expose themselves to when they stream live in publicly accessible areas. In the case of Konvy, it seems that the experience has enhanced his sense of perspective. It was not a bravado that was in his words, but thanksgiving. In a digital world often driven by spectacle, this moment cut through with raw reality.Also Read: Did someone get shot during Konvy’s livestream?

Minea Pagni and Massimo explain how their relationship began and why they ignore online hate





Minea Pagni is speaking out after her love story took over social media and sparked loud debate online. The 22-year-old Italian influencer went viral after sharing posts about her marriage to her former high school teacher, Massimo, who is nearly 40 years older than her. The couple’s age gap shocked many people online. Some users accused Pagni of marrying for money. Others questioned how the relationship began. As the videos crossed millions of views, the comments turned harsh.Now, Pagni is answering back. In an interview with The New York Post, she made it clear that money had nothing to do with her decision. She said she married for love, respect, and shared values.“I married him for who he is, his mind, his values, and the way he loves,” Pagni told The New York Post. She also said she knew not everyone would agree, but she did not expect the reaction to be so strong. Despite the noise, Pagni says she stands by her choice and wants people to hear her side of the story.Pagni first met Massimo five years ago when he was her high school philosophy teacher. She shared on her Instagram account @diaryofminea that she had a small crush back then, but nothing ever happened.“I had a crush on him. Nothing ever happened,” she wrote. “Years later, we met again, as two adults, and that’s when love actually began.”The two ran into each other at a bookstore two years ago. They started talking, then dating. Last month, they got married. One video, posted around Christmas, showed the couple together and quickly went viral, crossing 16 million views.“Christmas feels a little sweeter this year,” Pagni wrote. “Maybe because I’m spending it with the man I once only dreamed about.”But not everyone was kind. Some comments accused her of chasing money. One user wrote, “Rent cannot be that high sis.”Pagni denied those claims in her interview with The New York Post. “Reducing a woman’s choices to money is one of the oldest and most unfair stereotypes,” she said.Another video, which reached 4 million views, showed old photos of them from 2010. That post also caused backlash. Some viewers even claimed Massimo wore an expensive Rolex watch.“He doesn’t own, wear, or even desire a Rolex,” Pagni told The New York Post. She said the watches he owns are meaningful gifts, not status symbols.Pagni also said her parents had concerns at first. Over time, they saw her happiness and supported her choice. She is now studying medicine and says Massimo fully supports her work and online storytelling.Also Read: Who Is Lifeismizzy?

Dogs build their vocabularies like toddlers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/dogs-build-their-vocabularies-like-toddlers/articleshow/126460559.cms,".





Basket the border collie seems to have a way with words. The 7-year-old dog, who resides on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, knows the names of at least 150 toys—""froggy,"" ""crayon box"" and ""Pop-Tart,"" among them—and can retrieve them on command.Basket built her vocabulary thanks to the dedicated efforts of one of her owners, Elle Baumgartel-Austin. She began the language lessons when Basket was a puppy. ""I would play with her, say the name of the toy—say the name of the toy a lot of times,"" Baumgartel-Austin said. She started with 10 toys, adding more as Basket mastered them.""There never seemed to be a limit,"" she said. ""It's basically like, how many toys could I feasibly store in my tiny apartment?""Now, in a new study, scientists have found that Basket, and other dogs that share her advanced word-learning ability, have a skill that puts them functionally on par with 18-month-old children: They can learn the names of new toys not only through direct instruction but also by eavesdropping on the conversations of their owners.Such sophisticated word learning appears to be rare among dogs, and recognizing the labels for specific objects is a far cry from acquiring language. But the study's findings add to evidence that the cognitive and social abilities that underpin certain kinds of language learning are not limited to humans—and highlight just how adept dogs are at reading human signals.""They're very good at picking up on these cues,"" said Shany Dror, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, and an author of the study.""They're so good that they can pick up on them equally well when the cues are directed to the dog or when they're directed to someone else.""The study, which Dror conducted at Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest, was published in the journal Science on Thursday.Although many dogs can understand simple commands, like ""sit"" or ""stay,"" picking up the names of specific objects -- a skill known as label learning—appears to be a much tougher task. Scientists do not fully understand why.But over the past two decades or so, scientists have identified a handful of outliers, canine prodigies that know the names for dozens or even hundreds of toys and can remember such labels for years. ""They accumulate these huge vocabularies,"" Dror said.Herding dogs—and, in particular, border collies—seem to have a particular knack for this kind of word learning, perhaps because breeders once favored animals that paid especially close attention to what their owners said and did. But even among these breeds, label learning appears to be rare.","Basket, a 7-year-old border collie, knows the names of at least 150 toys.
