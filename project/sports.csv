Carlos Alcaraz completed his post-match TV interviews after defeating Novak Djokovic 6-4, 7-6 (4), 6-2 in the U.S. Open semifinals on Friday.Before beginning the interviews, Alcaraz paused to check his phone for updates on Jannik Sinner's semifinal match against Felix Auger-Aliassime, which was still in its first set.Sinner later secured his place in the final with a 6-1, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory over Auger-Aliassime. This set up a historic US Open final between No. 1 Sinner and No. 2 Alcaraz, marking the first time two players will face each other in three consecutive Grand Slam finals in one season.""These two players are the best in the world right now,"" said Djokovic, a 24-time major champion.The duo has dominated men's tennis, splitting the past eight major trophies and claiming 10 of the past 13. Alcaraz currently holds five Slam titles, while Sinner has four.The upcoming final will also determine the No. 1 ranking, with President Donald Trump expected to attend.The rivalry between Alcaraz and Sinner has intensified throughout the year, with Alcaraz winning at the French Open in June and Sinner prevailing at Wimbledon in July.Sinner aims to become the first repeat men's champion in New York since Roger Federer's five consecutive victories from 2004 to 2008. He has reached five straight Grand Slam finals since his US Open appearance last year.Alcaraz has maintained a perfect record without dropping a set as he pursues his sixth major title and second at Flushing Meadows.Since April, Alcaraz has dominated with a 44-2 record, reaching finals in his last eight tour-level events.""It's something that I'm working on, just the consistency on the matches, on the tournaments, on the year, in general. Just not having up-and-downs in (a) match. Probably, I'm just getting mature, just getting to know myself much better, what I need on, off the court,"" the Spaniard said.Sinner's record against Alcaraz in 2024 stands at 1-6, while maintaining an impressive 109-4 record against all other opponents.""We have played quite a lot this year. So we know each other very well,"" Sinner said.Alcaraz had previously lost to Djokovic in their last two encounters - the Paris Olympics gold-medal final and the Australian Open quarterfinals. ""It's not easy playing against him, to be honest. I'm thinking about the legend; what he has achieved in his career. It's difficult not to think about it,"" Alcaraz added.Djokovic, at 38, showed signs of fatigue by the match's end. He reached semifinals in all four Slams this season but was eliminated each time, with three losses to either Alcaraz or Sinner.""It's frustrating on the court when you are not able to keep up with that level physically, but at the same time, it's something also expected, I guess. It comes with time and with age,"" the veteran admitted.""I still want to play ... (a) full Grand Slam season next year. Let's see whether that's going to happen or not, but ... Slams are Slams. They are just different from any other tournament. They are the pillars of our sport, the most important tournaments we have. But I do fancy my chances a bit more in best-of-three.""Despite leading 3-0 in the second set, Djokovic couldn't maintain his advantage against Alcaraz.""Today, I'd say, it wasn't the best level of the tournament for me, but I just kept a cool level (from) the beginning until the last point,"" he explained.Alcaraz appeared in a pink sleeveless shirt, sporting regrown hair after a recent buzz cut necessitated by his brother's failed attempt at being a barber.When asked about maintaining his new look if victorious on Sunday, Alcaraz responded: ""Even better.

Deion Sanders’ advice for Travis Hunter as a new dad



Travis Hunter embraces fatherhood and NFL dreams



Travis Hunter is stepping into fatherhood and the NFL at the same time, and one man who has been by his side throughout this journey is Deion Sanders. The Hall of Famer, who once recruited Hunter to Jackson State and later coached him at Colorado, recently shared heartfelt fatherly advice for the Jacksonville Jaguars rookie as he embraces life’s two biggest milestones — becoming a professional athlete and a dad.For Deion Sanders, Travis Hunter has always been more than a player. Their bond goes back to 2021 when Hunter, then the No. 1 recruit in the nation, shocked everyone by committing to Jackson State instead of a powerhouse like Florida State. He later followed Sanders to Colorado, where he won the 2024 Heisman Trophy as a two-way sensation. Through it all, Sanders played a fatherly role, especially during Hunter’s toughest moments.On the night Hunter lifted the Heisman, his biological father was absent due to legal troubles. Sanders stepped in, embracing the young star in what became one of the most emotional moments of Hunter’s career. Years later, when Sanders was quietly battling a bladder cancer scare and couldn’t attend Hunter’s wedding, the rookie showed up at his coach’s Texas ranch, standing by him as the two shared quiet moments fishing together.“Oh my god, I’m taking a deep breath because I love him to life — I love him like he’s my son,” Sanders said. “It’s funny when your son is now a father… it’s a beautiful thing.“The thing that I told him is let’s correct all the things that we think we didn’t receive as children and let’s do that in our fatherhood. No matter what happens, let’s make sure we are the best darn father that ever walked. That’s what I told him. I’m proud of him, I love him to life, and I miss him dearly.”It wasn’t coach-speak. It was a father figure speaking to someone he considers family. And Hunter will also be happy to get some off-field advice from Coach Prime.Travis Hunter, just 22, is now a husband and a father. He and his longtime girlfriend, Leanna Lenee, tied the knot earlier this year before welcoming their first child, a baby boy. In a heartfelt video titled “Dear Son…”, Hunter can be heard saying to his newborn, “Gotta be better than me.”The timing couldn’t be more symbolic. On September 7, Hunter will make his NFL debut when the Jaguars face the Carolina Panthers. It marks the start of two parallel journeys: one on the field as a top draft pick, and one at home as a father. With Sanders’ wisdom and his own determination, Hunter now carries two legacies — as a rising NFL star and as a dad committed to doing things right. Fans and critics will be watching Travis Hunter how he make his debut a dreamy one. he is ready to show what he is capable of and to prove that he is indeed a two-way player and rare.Hunter showcased his versatility in his regular-season debut, contributing on both offense and defense during Jacksonville’s 26-10 win over the Carolina Panthers on Sunday. ""I did my job,"" said Hunter, the No. 2 pick in the NFL draft. ""That was the main focus. I did what they asked me to do.

Aryna Sabalenka has been open about navigating personal tragedy while continuing to dominate the tennis world. Following the sudden passing of her ex-boyfriend, Konstantin Koltsov, in March 2024, the Belarusian star found support in a new relationship with Brazilian entrepreneur Georgios Frangulis. The two went public in spring 2024, and since then, he has become a familiar face courtside, cheering her on at major tournaments.Aryna Sabalenka admitted that her new relationship came during an incredibly difficult chapter in her life. She credited Georgios Frangulis with helping her focus on joy beyond the pressures of tennis.“There was a really tough period where I was really happy to have him by my side, always cheering me up, always making sure that we are doing some fun stuff,” Sabalenka told People. “But I make sure I kind of forget about tennis and focus on the good things and enjoy my life. Even when things are going wrong in my career. So yeah, he was my biggest support and yeah, really happy to have him by my side.”Their relationship became public when they were first pictured together in April 2024. Since then, Frangulis has been spotted regularly in her player’s box, including at her title run at the 2024 US Open.Born and raised in São Paulo, Brazil, to a Greek family originally from Thessaloniki, Frangulis pursued law at Fundação Armando Alvares Penteado but never became a lawyer. His passion was always in entrepreneurship. After graduating in 2014, he moved to the United States, first living in Miami and later in California.A spiritual person, Frangulis has spoken about how faith shaped his outlook. “I go to church a lot, talking to God does me good. I was influenced by both branches of the family. The spiritual side has always been important to me – as well as intuition,” he told Forbes Brazil.In 2016, Frangulis founded Oakberry, an açaí-based brand that has since expanded worldwide. Known for its bowls and smoothies, Oakberry now has hundreds of locations across more than 40 countries. By January 2024, Sabalenka herself became an ambassador for the brand, later launching her own signature bowl.“Most of the time I go for Oakberry bowl; I think it's healthy and a good thing to start your day,” Sabalenka said in an interview. “It has everything you [want]: protein, carbs, vitamins, fruit. It's like an energy bowl, so I feel ready to go after I have it.”Beyond business, Frangulis balances his entrepreneurial career with his passion for motorsports. He has raced in Porsche GT3 Cup Challenge events and the Porsche Mobil 1 Supercup, finding in racing both adrenaline and escape.Georgios Frangulis has a visible presence in Aryna Sabalenka’s careerWhile Oakberry has sponsored tennis tournaments before, Frangulis admitted the experience of sitting in Sabalenka’s box is far more intense. “The toughest part is being in the box. It’s one of the most stressful situations I’ve ever experienced,” he said.“I never say anything during matches. I try not to show too much emotion, because Aryna notices everything – what everyone is doing in the box. I just clap as loudly as I can and make sure she feels supported.”Also Read: Who is Naomi Osaka’s husband?

Through his visibility and approachable personality, Gretzky encouraged female players to dream big and pursue hockey at all levels. He frequently spoke about the importance of growing the game for everyone, emphasizing that passion and hard work could break barriers.Gretzky’s impact wasn’t limited to inspiration alone; his advocacy helped shift public perception of women’s hockey.

Thehave pulled off a blockbuster three-team trade designed to satisfy the competing timelines of two NBA superstars: Luka Doncic and LeBron James. The deal bringsto Los Angeles, giving the Lakers a much-needed big man to complement both James’ immediate championship aspirations and Doncic’s long-term potential. The trade also involves the Utah Jazz and the Miami Heat, with draft picks and key role players exchanged in a move that reshapes each team’s future.The proposed deal was outlined by Bleacher Report’s Andy Bailey and highlights how the Lakers aim to build a roster that balances short-term title hopes with long-term growth. As CBS Sports’ Jasmyn Wimbish noted, “Doncic being just 26 gives the Lakers a far longer timeline to build a championship-contending team, but that doesn’t mean they can slow down and take their time.”The Los Angeles Lakers face a delicate balancing act. LeBron James, now in the later stages of his career, is focused on competing for a championship before retirement. His camp, led by agent Rich Paul, has made it clear that James values “a realistic chance of winning it all.” At the same time, Luka Doncic, who is only 26, is pushing for a quicker rebuild rather than a slow, drawn-out process.LeBron’s priorities are clear. His agent told ESPN, “LeBron wants to compete for a championship.He knows the Lakers are building for the future. He understands that, but he values a realistic chance of winning it all.”Doncic, too, made his intentions known. He told Lakers president Rob Pelinka and coach JJ Redick in May that he isn’t interested in waiting and wants the team to build aggressively.The Lakers, stuck between these timelines, now hope that Lauri Markkanen’s arrival provides both a present threat and future opportunity.• Los Angeles Lakers• Utah Jazz• Miami Heat• Lauri Markkanen• Rui Hachimura• Austin Reaves• Gabe Vincent• Dalton Knecht• 2026 first-round pick• 2031 first-round pick• Terry Rozier• Rui Hachimura• Gabe Vincent• Dalton Knecht• 2026 first-round pick (from Lakers)• 2031 first-round pick (from Lakers)• 2031 first-round pick (from Heat)• Lauri Markkanen• Svi Mykhailiuk• Austin Reaves• Svi Mykhailiuk• Terry Rozier• 2031 first-round pick• Acquire Lauri Markkanen, a versatile forward-center who fits both James’ immediate title ambitions and Doncic’s long-term rebuilding timeline.• Gain cap space flexibility by offloading multiple players and draft assets.• Add a reliable lob threat and interior presence that Doncic has been pushing for.• Sacrifice depth by trading away multiple rotation players.• Give up valuable future draft capital.• Receive a collection of players to strengthen their bench and future prospects.• Acquire three first-round picks, including two from the Lakers, enhancing their long-term rebuild.• Lose a key contributor in Lauri Markkanen.• Part ways with Svi Mykhailiuk.• Add depth by picking up role players like Austin Reaves and Svi Mykhailiuk.• Lose Terry Rozier and a future first-round pick.For Luka Doncic, the trade ensures he has a weapon at the rim, solving a longstanding issue for his style of play. Though he remains focused on long-term success, this acquisition shows that the Lakers are committed to building a contender without unnecessary delays.For LeBron James, Markkanen’s presence addresses his need for a big man who can help him compete immediately. The trade signals that the Lakers are serious about giving him a legitimate shot at another title before he retires.As Jasmyn Wimbish wrote, “Doncic being just 26 gives the Lakers a far longer timeline to build a championship-contending team, but that doesn’t mean they can slow down and take their time.”This blockbuster trade is a calculated gamble that attempts to balance the Lakers’ dual priorities - present success with LeBron and future contention with Doncic. While it costs them depth and draft assets, it finally gives them a foundational piece in Lauri Markkanen.For the Jazz and Heat, the trade offers opportunities to rebuild and retool for the future, while the Lakers double down on immediate relevance.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers Explore Trade for $100 Million Brooklyn Nets Superstar; Austin Reaves as Key Asset?

The deal gives the Lakers a much-needed big man to complement LeBron James' immediate championship aspirations and Luka Doncic's long-term potential.

NEW DELHI: At a Grand Slam where fashion goes hand-in-hand with tennis, it was Aryna Sabalenka who had the last laugh at Flushing Meadows. More than that, she created a lasting impression on and off the court while it rained outside the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Queens, New York.On the court, she beat Amanda Anisimova 6-3, 7-6 (3) to successfully defend her US Open title. In the process, she pocketed her fourth Grand Slam title and 100th victory at majors.And at the trophy ceremony, the fashion supremacy kicked in as the Belarusian wore a metallic silver jacket, matching perfectly with the silver of the trophy she had received from 18-time major champion Chris Evert Sabalenka has four now, in comparison, including two at the US Open, winning back-to-back titles. No one had won two in a row at Flushing Meadows since Serena Williams in 2013-14. Before the tournament began, she was asked about this long run.""Wow, that's insane, you know, how unpredictable women's tennis is, right? Should we change it? Should we try at least to change it?"" said the 27-year-old, before adding, ""My thought is to change that.""And she changed that successfully on Saturday evening with the roof closed over Arthur Ashe Stadium.Despite what the scoreline suggests, it wasn't all smooth sailing as she would have liked. Sabalenka, who likes to express her feelings on court, and lets her box know in the process, started slowly as Anisimova forced her into the corner.And that is one position Sabalenka doesn't enjoy. She was shoved into that place during the French Open final loss to Coco Gauff, acknowledging how stressed she got against the American in Paris.This time, too, she was broken at 3-2 in the opening set and smacked the ball away in frustration.Instead, she won the next four games, as Anisimova's risk-reward game of winners to unforced errors tipped towards 13-15. Sabalenka converted all three of her break point chances, served better, returned better, kept the error rate down. In fact, she made three unforced errors in the first five games and made none in the next four.Then in the second set, the World No. 1 twice led by a break, served for the title at 5-4 and came within two points of closing it out. An overhead had her backpedalling, and the smash went flush into the middle of the net. Anisimova converted the break point, and the 24,000 fans were up on their feet.Was this going to be the breaking point for Sabalenka? And the turning point for New Jersey-born Anisimova? Not quite.About 15 minutes later, Sabalenka was on her knees, both her hands covering her face in jubilation, having just converted her third match point opportunity in the tiebreak.That her first major of the year, after two painful final losses to Americans, came in a tiebreak felt fitting. It extended her record to 21-1 in breakers this season, including 19 in a row, and underscored that the defeat to Gauff in Paris was a rare blip.“All those tough lessons (were) worth this one,” Sabalenka said. “I’m speechless right now.”“It’s been tough this year. In those finals, I was really terrible. But come on, it’s worth it, right? Thank you so much. I love you; you’re my family. Thank you to my boyfriend — without your support, I wouldn’t be able to make it,” she continued.As the silver jacket shimmered under the artificial Arthur Ashe lights, Sabalenka’s victory felt bigger than the previous three. It was the culmination of a season in which she turned lessons from painful defeats into fuel, and a reminder that women’s tennis, often accused of unpredictability, now has a figure who is setting the tone at the very top.Her brash energy on court, the roars, the clenched fist directed at her team are contrasts to the poise and flair she projects once the battle is over. Few athletes today blur the lines between raw emotion and refined spectacle quite like Sabalenka; and in New York, the stage rewards both.","Aryna Sabalenka beat Amanda Anisimova 6-3, 7-6 (3) to successfully defend her US Open title.

NHL Trade Rumors: Could trading Brandon Carlo be the Maple Leafs’ only path to a top-six forward?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-rumors-could-trading-brandon-carlo-be-the-maple-leafs-only-path-to-a-top-six-forward/articleshow/123746780.cms,"Brandon Carlo (Getty Images)

Brandon Carlo as a key trade asset and team cornerstone

The challenge of balancing the roster post-trade

The Toronto Maple Leafs are facing a difficult decision as they look to strengthen their forward group for a Stanley Cup run. Rumors suggest defenseman Brandon Carlo could be on the trade block, a move that could provide the team with a top-six scoring forward. While this approach may seem like “robbing Peter to pay Paul,” it reflects the modern NHL reality: acquiring elite offensive talent often requires moving a significant current asset.Carlo was brought in to anchor the Maple Leafs’ blue line, offering a steady presence and defensive balance alongside offensively-minded players like Morgan Rielly. His value league-wide is undeniable—a durable, right-shot defenseman in his prime is a coveted asset for any contender. As such, Carlo represents GM Brad Treliving’s most substantial leverage to pursue a game-changing forward. While depth options like Jack Roslovic exist, they don’t provide the kind of impact a true top-six forward can offer.Trading Carlo would solve one problem but immediately create another. His departure would leave a hole on the right side of the defense, requiring the Leafs to acquire a puck-moving, offensively capable defenseman to maintain balance.Pursuing a player like Erik Karlsson is a tantalizing idea, yet the logistics and financial implications make it a complex endeavor. Treliving would essentially need to orchestrate a multi-team, multi-player strategy to achieve both goals without compromising the team’s defensive core.Also Read: NHL Trade Rumors: Toronto Maple Leafs could part ways with Calle Jarnkrok and David Kampf For Leafs fans, this is a high-stakes puzzle: could trading Carlo finally provide the offensive spark the team needs, or is it too risky to gamble with a cornerstone defender? In the modern NHL, calculated risks like this often separate contenders from pretenders, and the Maple Leafs’ front office faces one of its most critical decisions of the season.","The Toronto Maple Leafs are facing a difficult decision as they look to strengthen their forward group for a Stanley Cup run.

Allen Lazard's absence shocks Jets fans

Trade rumors heat up with GM Omar Khan likely to act

New York Jets wide receiver Allen Lazard is among the higher-profile adjustments to the regular season Sunday, as the veteran wideout was made a healthy scratch before the team's opener against the Pittsburgh Steelers, an eyebrow-raiser considering his $44 million contract and his place as one of the top acquisitions of the Aaron Rodgers era. Now with Lazard's future up in the air, trade possibilities have started to pop up, and according to Pittsburgh Steelers General Manager Omar Khan , it seems he is looking for something better.Allen Lazard was a surprising absence from the Jets' Week 1 lineup as he was not on the injury report before the game. Acquired from the Seahawks, the 6-foot-5 wide receiver signed a four-year, $44 million deal after the Jets traded for him a month earlier in March 2023, but he has been unable to find his footing with the team.In two seasons, Lazard has caught just 60 passes for 841 yards and seven total touchdowns. Shoulder injury and competition for the No. 2 receiver job have added to the overall struggles of his performance. Although short on talent behind star receiver Garrett Wilson, Lazard was a healthy scratch for reasons not entirely apparent (unless the Jets were more than okay having the nevertheless) and ended up UKG that way.Also Read: NFL game tonight: List of all matches, start timings, when and where to watch and more The Jets made Allen Lazard a healthy scratch last week, and it raised questions about his future with the team. The Lazard situation is a byproduct of a new leadership regime, and Aaron Rodgers is no longer part of the franchise. Lazard's role has decreased, and his contract can be seen as well-paid. Audria is aware of this situation as it has rung the bell of Pittsburgh Steelers' General Manager Omar Khan, a master strategist with roster construction.With both changes and potential changes coming to the Steelers' receiving corps, it appears Khan is considering making a move for Lazard, reports Sayfaneh. With a veteran weapon no longer on the roster for the Steelers, it is possible Lazard could find a new home here to fill a bit of experience and depth within the wide receiver room.With the NFL trade landscape shifting, Allen Lazard will be an interesting case to see how the Jets handle it. But if the team does decide to part ways with the wide receiver, a trade would be the best for both sides, giving Lazard a fresh start while providing the Jets with more resources in other areas of need. Allen Lazard would make a difference in the Steelers' receiving game, adding stability to an offense that desperately needs it heading into the new season.","Allen Lazard was a healthy scratch for the New York Jets' opener against the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Christian McCaffrey’s status clarified before kickoff

What Christian McCaffrey’s return means for the 49ers and fantasy football

After a long wait, the San Francisco 49ers are finally enabling star running back Christian McCaffrey to suit up for real in Week 1 for a game against the Seattle Seahawks. Though a calf problem that arose late last week made McCaffrey questionable and sidelined him at practice this past Friday, several NFL insiders now say McCaffrey is ""good to go"" for Sunday.Couple that with reporting from notable voices like Adam Schefter and Ian Rapoport, and things look up as fans are left with hope that McCaffrey may play, providing a much-needed win for 49ers fans and fantasy managers across the land.The 49ers listed McCaffrey as limited in Thursday's practice before listing him as a non-practice participant on Friday, leaving him questionable for Week 1. Yet, updates on early Sunday morning from Adam Schefter of ESPN confirmed that McCaffrey would play. Sunday morning, the word from a source to Schefter was: ""He's good to go.""Jordan James is now listed as doubtful, and the team has not promoted any other running back from the practice squad, which could be seen as a vote of confidence that McCaffrey will be ready. However, caution remains. More than a few insiders, including Ian Rapoport, said it is all dependent on McCaffrey not suffering a setback, and that an official decision wouldn't be known until just ahead of the 1:05 p.m.PT kickoff.Also Read: Did Shilo Sanders land with an NFL team? Latest update on the ex-Colorado Buffaloes standout Having McCaffrey back, though, is a significant boost for San Francisco's offense. With the 2024 season interrupted by several injuries, Achilles, calf, and a season-ending knee injury, his arrival adds elite playmaking, but also a massive headache in managing his touches. The team still sees his value, but probably will closely track his reps to avoid overextending him.As far as fantasy football goes, McCaffrey is still a must-start if he plays. Even so, Adam Schefter noted that McCaffrey remains a top value in Week 1, which makes that struggle a little more theoretical playing out on a fantasy team as Brian Robinson Jr. and Isaac Guerendo carry little more than speculative upside in deeper formats.","San Francisco 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey was listed as questionable for Sunday's game against the Seattle Seahawks.

Williams eyes growth as Lions chase bigger dreams

Detroit’s high-octane wide receiver Jameson Williams has secured his long-term future, signing a three-year extension worth up to $83 million just hours before the Lions kick off their season in Green Bay. The deal rewards Williams for a breakout 2024 campaign and signals Detroit’s intent to keep its offensive core intact while contract talks with defensive star Aidan Hutchinson remain on hold.Williams’ new pact was finalized less than 24 hours before the Lions take on the Packers, according to sources. The 24-year-old wide receiver was entering the fourth year of his rookie contract, with a team option still in play. Instead, Detroit moved swiftly to tie him down through 2028, banking on his speed and evolving skill set as central pieces of John Morton’s revamped offense.NFL insider Jordan Schultz first broke news of the deal, which carries both security and incentives that could elevate Williams among the league’s top-paid receivers.Detroit traded up 20 slots to select Williams 12th overall out of Alabama in 2022, betting on his explosiveness despite his recovery from a college knee injury.After a gradual build, he came alive in 2024 — topping 1,000 yards for the first time, scoring seven receiving touchdowns, and even adding a rushing score as a creative wrinkle in Ben Johnson’s scheme.“I feel like the coaches are unlocking me in new ways,” Williams reflected this week at practice. “It’s not just deep shots anymore. I’m learning how to impact the game in more spots and I’ve locked in on every detail.”Williams’ deal pairs him long-term with All-Pro receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown, giving Detroit one of the NFL’s most dynamic receiver tandems. Under new offensive coordinator Morton, the Lions are expected to diversify Williams’ usage, making him more than just a vertical threat.Meanwhile, Hutchinson — the Pro Bowl pass rusher who grew up in Michigan — remains without a new deal despite positive talks. Sources suggest negotiations will resume later in the season, but no agreement is imminent.For Williams, the extension marks not just financial security but validation of his growth. He insists his offseason strides have made him a more complete weapon, and with Detroit returning most of its nucleus from last year’s playoff run, optimism runs high.“Everything we’ve built is leading to something special,” Williams said. “It’s going to be a fun season.”Also read: Who is Madison Beer?

NEW DELHI: South Africa suffered their heaviest defeat in One-Day International (ODI) cricket as England dismantled the tourists in record-breaking fashion at Southampton on Sunday. The hosts sealed a 342-run victory, the biggest in the history of men’s ODIs when batting first, eclipsing India’s 317-run triumph over Sri Lanka in 2023.Chasing a mammoth 415 for victory and a chance to avoid a whitewash in the three-match series, the Proteas crumbled under relentless pressure. Their innings lasted just 20.5 overs, producing only 72 runs — their second-lowest total in ODIs.The humiliation was narrowly short of their all-time low of 69, scored against Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground in 1993. It was also their fourth-lowest score against England and highlighted a stunning batting collapse.England’s dominance was set up earlier in the day by a sensational maiden century from Jacob Bethell and a destructive bowling spell from Jofra Archer.Bethell, aged 21 years and 319 days, announced himself on the international stage with a sparkling 110. He became the second-youngest man to score an ODI hundred for England, behind David Gower, who achieved the feat twice before turning 22.England piled on 414 for 5, their highest-ever total against South Africa in ODIs, surpassing their previous best of 399 for 9 at Bloemfontein in 2016.This marked the fourth time South Africa have conceded 400-plus runs in an ODI, a tally bettered only by West Indies (five times).England, meanwhile, have now crossed the 400-run mark seven times, with only South Africa (eight times) doing it more often.For South Africa, the defeat was especially painful given its timing.Just two weeks earlier, they had suffered what was then their biggest ODI loss, a 276-run thrashing at the hands of Australia in Mackay.Now, within 15 days, they have been on the receiving end of two of the seven heaviest defeats in men’s ODI history.Archer’s fiery pace ensured that any hopes of resistance from the Proteas were extinguished quickly. His early breakthroughs left South Africa reeling, and they never recovered from the collapse. The innings ended almost as quickly as it had begun, with just one ball separating this debacle from their shortest ODI innings ever — 83 all out in 20.4 overs against England in 2022 at Manchester.","England beat South Africa by 342 runs in One-Day International (ODI) cricket.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan sent out a strong statement ahead of the Asia Cup as Mohammad Nawaz’s hat-trick inspired a thumping 75-run victory over Afghanistan in the tri-series final in Sharjah on Sunday.Nawaz finished with career-best T20I figures of 5 for 19, dismantling Afghanistan for just 66 in 15.5 overs while defending a modest 142 on a challenging surface.Earlier, Afghan skipper Rashid Khan claimed 3 wickets to restrict Pakistan to 141 for 8 after they chose to bat first.Fakhar Zaman top-scored with 27, adding 49 runs for the second wicket with Saim Ayub (17).Nawaz chipped in with a 21-ball 25, while captain Salman Agha laboured to 24. Rashid removed Zaman in his opening over, before also dismissing Hasan Nawaz (15) and Agha, though the latter struck him for two sixes.The match turned decisively when Nawaz dismissed Darwish Rasooli and Azmatullah Omarzai off successive deliveries for ducks, before trapping Ibrahim Zadran (9) first ball of his next over to complete his hat-trick.In doing so, he became just the third Pakistani bowler after Faheem Ashraf and Mohammad Hasnain to claim a T20I hat-trick.Afghanistan’s batting collapsed in the chase, with only Rashid (17) and Sediqullah Atal (13) reaching double figures.Their total of 66 was their second-lowest in T20Is, behind the 56 all out against South Africa in last year’s World Cup semi-final.“We wanted to prepare in a way that helps us for the Asia Cup and we’ve done that,” said Pakistan captain Salman Agha. “We’ve been doing really well since the Bangladesh series at home.

Divya Deshmukh vs Bassem Amin (Divya with the black pieces)

Relief after first win at

Grand Swiss 2025

NEW DELHI: “With great power comes great responsibility”: Uncle Ben’s wisdom from Spider-Man feels apt when looking at Divya Deshmukh these days. Barely out of her teens, the Nagpur-born has already checked off Olympiad golds, the World Junior Girls’ crown, Asian championship glory, and, most recently, the prestigious Women’s World Cup.Riding that wave, Divya took the bold call to skip the Women’s Grand Swiss, choosing instead to test herself in the open section against the world’s elite.But the start was far from smooth. A first-round loss to her mentor, GM Abhimanyu Puranik, followed by two hard-fought draws, raised whispers of whether she actually possesses the ""great power"" to strike in this field.The 19-year-old, though, had the calm answer: “Even if I lose all the rounds, I think I will be fine if I learn.”On Sunday, she had more than just learning.Divya, rated 2478, stunned Africa No. 1 GM Bassem Amin, rated 2636, with the black pieces, registering her maiden win in the open section and becoming the Player of the Day at the Grand Swiss in Samarkand, Uzbekistan.Facing Amin’s king’s pawn opening, Divya responded with the Sicilian Defence, steering the battle into the sharp Nyezhmetdinov-Rossolimo Attack territory.The Egyptian pressed early, but as the game wore on, the momentum began shifting.In her post-game chat, Divya admitted the opening wasn’t smooth sailing: “I feel quite good. I think the opening was quite a rough start for me, so I’m happy that I managed to recover. Of course, he put so much pressure on me. He’s the best in Africa, and he’s quite strong. So it was quite a tough game.”The turning point arrived when Amin opted for the aggressive 24. Ng5.Divya recalled the moment vividly: “After a rough start, I think this is the moment where I got my chances. If he played Bg7, it would still be sort of equal. But after Ng5, I felt more in control because I saw this idea with f4. Engine does not like it, but it felt like I could put pressure. Also, his bishop on c2 was weak, and I wanted to go Qg6 with ideas on the kingside.”After the sequence 27.Bf6 Qg6 28.Bxg7+ Qxg7, the balance shifted. Divya described it with trademark candour: “I think after this point, I started gaining a bit of the initiative, since all my pieces are fine. This knight; it’s so ugly, but it’s doing its job.”Divya admitted she wasn’t flawless in conversion: “I was trying to capture all the pawns and just get my knight into activity. And I missed Rc3 and this counterplay. But I think, okay, definitely could have been a much more accurate game, but with our time ticking down, I think it was fine. And I’m proud of this move (33...Rxg4).”That rook sacrifice on the kingside proved decisive, tilting the game firmly in her favour.The bold exchange sac forced Amin onto the back foot. With his king under fire and counterplay limited, Divya calmly converted: “We were both playing on seconds, so it was quite tough. But I’m just glad that I managed to find the victory. After this (39...Qg5), I realised I just had to play a solid move and it would be okay. There were also a lot of threats in the air, like Rf5, h5, Bh5, so I think it was simply gone for him.”“The win is quite a relief, honestly, because I was wondering when my first victory would come,” Divya admitted.“The first game was tough, but I definitely learned a lot. I think it also helped me in my other games because I just had to calculate so much in the first game. That training helped me today.”Asked about the secret to her run of breakthroughs, she commented: “Tough to pinpoint one, but my year started off quite rocky. I think in an overall trajectory, failure is the reason for success.”From a “rocky” campaign in the Challengers section of Wijk aan Zee to clinching her first win in the open section of the Grand Swiss, Divya has indeed come a long way. But her rise is anything but sudden.“She just has that instinct. And I feel her play has become much more refined. Her weaknesses aren’t as visible as before, and she’s clearly putting in the work,” Puranik, who was one of Divya's seconds during the title-winning FIDE Women's World Cup, told TimesofIndia.com.“I don’t think it was about any specific preparation after the Wijk aan Zee event. It was more of an incremental build-up; she kept working consistently, and then the results showed. It might have looked like a sudden change, but she had been putting in the effort all along. Mentally, I think she was in the perfect space during the World Cup. As a sportsperson, when you feel that rhythm, it all clicks, the balance between skill and mindset. She truly found that balance, and everything came together beautifully. It was amazing to witness.”","Divya Deshmukh, rated 2478, stunned Africa No. 1 GM Bassem Amin, rated 2636, with the black pieces. The 19-year-old registered her maiden win in the open section and became the Player of the Day at the Grand Swiss in Samarkand.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123756920,imgsize-67294,width-400,resizemode-4/divya-deshmukh-fide-photo-1.jpg"

Around 11 a.m., police responded to the scene of the shooting incident, at the Paragon Apartment Complex located on Larsen Road in Jackson Township, where a woman was found unconscious.Authorities further revealed that they discovered her unconscious body. They also said that she was shot many times and that she was ""lying near the exit of the apartment complex."" According to a statement from Ocean County Prosecutor Bradley Billhimer, Shaquille Green of Jackson Township has been charged with murder , unlawful possession of a weapon, and unlawful possession of a firearm in connection with the death of Toraya Reid.The prosecutor's office further said.""A subsequent investigation by the Ocean County Prosecutor’s Office Major Crime Unit, Jackson Township Police Department, and Ocean County Sheriff’s Office Crime Scene Investigation Unit, identified Green – who has been in a dating relationship with Ms. Reid – as the individual responsible for her death.""Green was arrested after being seen ""running on North New Prospect Road"".Green and Toraya Reid had been in ""a dating relationship,"" according to Billhimer.

Reid is starting his seventh season with the Timberwolves, who signed him as an undrafted free agent in 2019. Training camp starts on September 29. Since then, he has grown into Minnesota's sixth man and a starting-level player.Due to his play on the court and his philanthropic efforts away from the court, Naz Reid is a popular figure in Minnesota. He signed with the NBA in 2019 as an undrafted free agent and made himself an immediate contributor to the Timberwolves' young core.Last year, when the Wolves advanced to their second straight Western Conference finals, he put up 14.2 points and 6.0 rebounds and was named Sixth Man of the Year in 2024. This August, he agreed to stay in Minnesota for another five years at a cost of $125 million. However, currently, he is dealing with a lot following the tragic demise of his sister.Also read: Where does Johnny Juzang hail from?

Connor McDavid is taking a measured approach to contract negotiations

As the Edmonton Oilers prepare for the 2025-26 NHL season, captain Connor McDavid is approaching the new campaign with renewed focus and determination. After a season that didn’t fully meet his own standards, McDavid is intent on pushing his game to new heights, leading the team, and setting a championship culture from the start.Despite an already stellar career, including two Stanley Cup Finals appearances, over 700 NHL games, and 14 major NHL awards, Connor McDavid admitted last season fell short of his expectations. His 100-point campaign in 67 games, while impressive, was the lowest output in five years. Now, he is focused on balancing his natural playmaking with a more assertive offensive approach.“I have times where I get the puck in good spots and I'm thinking, ‘What's the next play?’ When I should be thinking, ‘I'm going to score here, I'm going to shoot, or I'm going to take this to the net,’” McDavid explained.

Micah Parsons opens up about Cowboys turmoil



Micah Parsons embraced by Packers and thriving instantly



Micah Parsons’ turbulent offseason with the Dallas Cowboys has ended in a fresh start that feels like destiny. The All-Pro pass rusher, once the cornerstone of the Cowboys’ defense, now wears green and gold after being traded to the Green Bay Packers—a move that is already reshaping the NFC North. And for the first time in months, Parsons says he finally feels free.Parsons never hid his frustration with the way his contract situation unraveled in Dallas. Despite being the franchise’s most dominant defender, he endured months of silence from ownership, endured public jabs from Jerry Jones about his health, and even swallowed pride to return in hopes of re-signing with the team he called his “dream.” Instead, the Cowboys dealt him away for two first-round picks and veteran Kenny Clark.“These last six months was super draining, super toxic for everyone,"" Parsons admitted after Green Bay’s win over Detroit. ""It's something that I don't think no player should have to go through. The fact that I was traded a week before the season was really outrageous and rough.”That brutal honesty painted a stark picture of dysfunction in Dallas. The Cowboys’ handling of Parsons not only cost them a generational talent but also exposed cracks in the way the franchise prioritizes finances over field dominance.In Green Bay, Parsons has already felt the complete opposite. His new teammates let him run out of the tunnel last on debut Sunday, and the Lambeau crowd roared with approval. That warm welcome set the tone for what’s quickly becoming a mutually beneficial relationship.“These guys embraced me. They believe in my talents,"" Parsons said. ""I’m just gonna give these guys everything I have because I know what’s at stake.”On the field, his presence was undeniable. In just 29 snaps, he forced an interception, recorded a statement sack, and drew constant double teams that opened lanes for his teammates. The Packers’ defense held a Lions offense—one that dominated the NFC North last season—to just 2.1 yards per carry.It’s the kind of impact elite players bring instantly, and it underscores why great organizations invest in them, rather than alienate them. While the Cowboys scramble to justify their decision, the Packers look revitalized with a defensive anchor capable of flipping their season’s trajectory.Parsons’ message was clear: he has moved on, he feels valued, and he intends to repay the faith Green Bay has shown. For the Cowboys, it’s déjà vu. For the Packers, it may just be the start of something special.Also Read: Josh Allen admits unusual pregame habit but never skips his date night with wife Hailee Steinfeld before Bills games","Micah Parsons was traded from the Dallas Cowboys to the Green Bay Packers.

How Derrick Henry is chasing NFL legends

King Henry ’s career and future milestones



Baltimore Ravens running back Derrick Henry added another historic milestone to his legendary career. On a 30-yard run in the second quarter of Sunday night’s season opener against the Buffalo Bills, Henry scored his 107th career rushing touchdown, moving past Hall of Famer Jim Brown and claiming sole possession of sixth place on the NFL’s all-time rushing touchdown list.Before the game, Henry and Brown were tied at 106 career rushing touchdowns, each standing at sixth all time. Now 31 years old and in his second season with the Ravens after eight seasons with the Tennessee Titans, Henry is closing in on another NFL icon: Walter Payton.The Chicago Bears legend finished his career with 110 rushing TDs, just three ahead of Henry’s current total. While Brown reached 106 TDs in 118 games, Henry achieved the same milestone in 136 games, and his next milestone could come faster than Payton’s pace, who reached 110 in 190 games.Henry’s season opener also marked another achievement: he moved up the all-time rushing yards leaderboard, surpassing Steven Jackson for 18th place with 11,438 career yards. Averaging 1,428 yards per 17-game season, Henry is on track to become just the 17th player in NFL history to surpass 12,000 career rushing yards by midseason.A five-time Pro Bowler and two-time rushing champion, Henry has consistently dominated the league, tying for the rushing touchdown lead three times in his career, including last season with 16 scores. “King Henry” has already etched his name among the NFL greats, and Sunday’s performance is a reminder that more historic benchmarks could be on the horizon this season.Also Read: Who is Dorian Strong?

Why Buffalo is getting a new stadium and what to expect

A new chapter for the Bills and their fans

The Buffalo Bills enter the 2025-26 NFL season with renewed energy, backed by one of the most passionate fanbases in the league. Known as Bills Mafia, these fans are famous for their loyalty, loud game-day traditions, and unwavering support, especially at home. While the team opens the season against the Baltimore Ravens in Orchard Park, the excitement surrounding the franchise isn’t just on the field—it extends to the promise of a new stadium.Construction on the New Highmark Stadium began in June 2023 and is scheduled to open for the 2026 season. The $2.2 billion venue aims to deliver a more intimate, fan-focused experience compared to the current stadium. According to sources, the smaller footprint will allow fans to feel closer to the action while still maintaining the iconic energy of Bills Mafia.Unlike fully enclosed stadiums, the new venue will be open-air but feature a 360-degree canopy covering about 65% of the seating. The canopy includes a snow melt system designed to prevent accumulation during heavy snowfall, ensuring that games remain playable even in harsh Buffalo winters. Additionally, the field will be heated, keeping the turf safe and playable late into the season.The team entered the season following a 13-4 campaign in 2024, clinching their fifth consecutive AFC East title and making it to the AFC Championship Game. With Josh Allen coming off an MVP season, the Bills aim to build on past success while looking forward to the opening of their new stadium. The combination of elite on-field talent and a modern, fan-first venue promises an exciting future for the franchise and the dedicated Bills Mafia community.Also Read: Who is Dorian Strong?

Josh Allen’s game day rituals keep him grounded



Hailee Steinfeld’s quiet support and Josh Allen’s QB dinners



Few NFL players carry the weight of expectation like Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen . Coming off a whirlwind offseason that included marrying actress Hailee Steinfeld , honeymooning in Hawaii, and inking a record-setting six-year, $330 million deal, Allen enters his eighth season with one mission still driving him: bringing Buffalo its first Super Bowl championship.Despite his superstar status, Allen leans on simple traditions to find balance. One of them is a weekly date night with Hailee Steinfeld at Mangia, a cozy Italian spot in Buffalo. “When I’m staying in Buffalo, typically, me and my wife have a little routine of eating at little Italian spot called Mangia,” Allen shared. “So we keep it pretty similar, keep it pretty much the same here.”On the road, his meals are less predictable but just as intentional. “It’s a rotating thing,” he explained. “I think based on where we play… it’s pasta, or some fried rice and chicken, that’s probably my go-to.”Interestingly, Allen admits he still throws up before games, a nervous habit that hasn’t left him even as one of the league’s most dominant quarterbacks. Yet, with his refined conditioning and diet changes, the 29-year-old insists he’s in the best shape of his career.While Allen prepares on the field, Steinfeld quietly shows her support in the stands.She avoids the spotlight, rarely appearing on jumbotrons or posting from games. Instead, she showcases her style elsewhere, writing in Beau Society, “On game days, I usually keep it to jeans, a t-shirt, and a hat… finding special pieces to pull out for the pure celebration that is a Sunday at Highmark Stadium.”Allen also nurtures camaraderie with teammates through his weekly dinners with backup Mitch Trubisky and practice-squad quarterback Shane Buechele. “It’s something to look forward to at the end of the week,” Allen said. “We get to ask each other questions and continue to learn more about each other.”As the Bills chase history this season, Allen’s mix of personal stability, tight-knit traditions, and relentless drive may prove to be the winning formula Buffalo has long awaited.Also Read: Watch: Lions rookie Isaac TeSlaa delivers insane one-handed touchdown catch in Week 1 thriller against Green Bay Packers","Josh Allen and wife Hailee Steinfeld have a weekly date night at Mangia in Buffalo.

Who is Dorian Strong and what is his background?

Why is Dorian Strong starting in Week 1 and what to watch for?

Buffalo Bills fans are about to see a new face in the secondary. Sixth-round rookie Dorian Strong will start against the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday Night Football, stepping into a high-pressure role earlier than many expected. With veteran Tre’Davious White sidelined by a leg injury and first-round pick Maxwell Hairston on injured reserve, Strong will line up opposite Christian Benford, tasked with defending one of the NFL ’s most dynamic quarterbacks, Lamar Jackson , under the national spotlight.Dorian Strong played five seasons at Virginia Tech, appearing in 53 games and earning All-ACC honors twice. Over his college career, he tallied 112 tackles, seven interceptions, three forced fumbles, and 28 passes defended. Despite a 2022 injury setback, Strong bounced back to start all 25 games across 2023 and 2024, showcasing durability and consistency.At 6-foot-1 and 185 pounds, Strong is known for his length, instincts, and ability to read routes in zone coverage. NFL.com projected him as a potential fourth-round pick, praising his ball skills and feel for receivers. Yet, he slipped to the sixth round, with the Bills selecting him at No.177 overall, behind first-rounder Maxwell Hairston and fifth-rounder Jordan Hancock.Buffalo’s cornerback depth has been tested early this season. With White out, Hairston on IR, and Hancock still developing, Strong earned the unexpected nod in primetime. Sunday’s game will not only test his skills but could also define his role in the Bills’ secondary moving forward.Also Read: Watch: Lions rookie Isaac TeSlaa delivers insane one-handed touchdown catch in Week 1 thriller against Green Bay Packers Fans and analysts will be watching closely to see how Strong handles this baptism by fire.

Tyreek Hill’s injury raises concerns as Dolphins struggle in blowout loss to Colts

Injury adds to Dolphins’ mounting troubles

The Miami Dolphins endured a tough night in Indianapolis on Sunday, suffering a dismal first half that saw them shut out entirely while quarterback Tua Tagovailoa threw two interceptions. To make matters worse, star wide receiver Tyreek Hill appeared to sustain a potential injury, fueling speculation amid an already catastrophic game.The troubling moment came in the third quarter when Tyreek Hill, already Miami’s leading receiver with 40 yards on four catches, was tackled by Colts’ cornerback Charvarius Ward on a routine 4-yard catch. After the hit, Hill requested to exit the field and entered the medical tent. The reason for his discomfort was not immediately clear, sparking concern among Dolphins fans and analysts alike.Hill spent several minutes in the blue medical tent before returning to the sideline, though notably without his helmet in hand. He sat with other Dolphins receivers, observing the game as the Colts’ offense continued to dominate. His presence on the sideline without actively rejoining the game suggested he was not fully cleared to return to play, intensifying worries about his health.The injury update comes at an already dire time for Miami. The team failed to score in the first half and struggled to find any offensive rhythm against the Colts’ defensive onslaught. With Tua Tagovailoa’s two interceptions contributing to a mounting deficit, the Dolphins’ offensive struggles were on full display.Tyreek Hill’s condition remains a key concern as the Dolphins attempt to regroup for the next matchup. Given Hill’s role as one of the team’s offensive pillars, his potential absence or limited performance could have major repercussions for Miami’s playoff hopes. As of now, no official diagnosis has been released, but fans will be closely monitoring updates in the coming days.Also Read: Xavier Worthy’s injury leaves Chiefs searching, and one free agent WR stands out as the clear solution Miami’s focus now shifts toward assessing Hill’s health while trying to recover from a nightmarish performance that further deepens their early-season woes.","Tyreek Hill was tackled by Colts' cornerback Charvarius Ward on a routine 4-yard catch.

Incident highlights need for respectful fan behavior

Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson became the center of a tense sideline moment during Sunday Night Football after a Buffalo Bills fan struck him on the helmet. The dramatic episode drew attention to the fine line between fan enthusiasm and player safety. Jackson’s instinctive response, combined with his on-field composure, captured both the danger and emotion of live NFL action.The confrontation happened shortly after Ravens wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins hauled in a spectacular one-handed touchdown. As Jackson and Hopkins celebrated near the front row, a fan in a red Bills jersey reached over and struck both players on the helmet. Jackson, startled but composed, shoved the fan back into his seat. Video footage quickly went viral, sparking debate about player safety and fan behavior.Many commentators and fans pointed out that no spectator should touch a player, and Jackson’s reaction was a natural defense. Analysts emphasized the importance of player safety and how quickly celebrations can turn into dangerous situations when fans cross the line.While Jackson faced no penalties, the fan was ejected for violating NFL rules against physical contact with players.The swift removal highlighted the league’s commitment to safety and raised broader questions about how stadiums manage highly charged moments. Analysts suggested that stronger security measures and clearer consequences could prevent similar incidents in future games.Despite the sideline tension, the game itself remained fiercely competitive. Buffalo quarterback Josh Allen led a late-game rally to edge out the Ravens 41–40. The high-octane matchup showcased both teams’ resilience and set the tone for an exciting NFL season, with Jackson demonstrating why he remains one of the league’s premier dual-threat quarterbacks.The episode was a reminder of the importance of maintaining boundaries between fans and players.

A'ja Wilson ’s record-breaking night pushes MVP case further



Chicago Sky’s struggles overshadow Angel Reese's absence



The Las Vegas Aces extended their dominance on Sunday night, defeating the Chicago Sky 80-66 and notching their 15th consecutive victory. The win also carried historic weight. A’ja Wilson delivered another commanding performance with 31 points and 11 rebounds, setting a new WNBA record by surpassing Jewell Loyd and Maya Moore for the most 30-point games in a single season with 13.A'ja Wilson, a three-time league MVP, showed her dominance on the court. She scored early and often, finishing 12-of-20 from the field while adding four steals and three blocks on the defensive end. Her ability to dominate on both sides of the floor showed why she has become the frontrunner in the MVP race. In fact, oddsmakers recently shifted the betting line dramatically in her favor, reflecting just how unstoppable she’s been down the stretch.It was Wilson’s third straight 30-point game and her 10th 30-point double-double of the season. With just two regular-season games left, Las Vegas remains tied with the Atlanta Dream for the No. 2 seed, though they hold the tiebreaker thanks to a perfect 3-0 record against Atlanta.Her teammates also delivered when needed. Jackie Young added 20 points, nine assists, and five rebounds in an efficient performance, while Chelsea Gray chipped in 13 points and kept the offense flowing.The trio once again showcased why the Aces are considered one of the league’s most dangerous units.Chicago, meanwhile, couldn’t keep pace despite having five players in double figures. Michaela Onyenwere and Kamilla Cardoso each contributed, but the Sky’s 19 turnovers proved costly. The absence of Angel Reese only compounded the team’s difficulties. Suspended for the first half due to comments deemed “detrimental to the team” and later sidelined with a back injury, the rookie standout never had a chance to make her impact felt.For Las Vegas, the result was another reminder that their title defense is well within reach. The Aces will face the Sky again on Tuesday before wrapping up their regular season against the Los Angeles Sparks.

Poll Do you believe Suryakumar Yadav can regain his form as a captain in the Asia Cup? Yes, he has the potential. No, the pressure will be too much.

Suryakumar Yadav

Gautam Gambhir, Suryakumar Yadav

When the new poster boy of Indian cricket, Shubman Gill, was appointed vice-captain of the T20 team, it generated a positive buzz. For Suryakumar Yadav, though, the announcement carried a very different message: the selectors may have just put him on notice.Harsh? Perhaps. Unfair? Maybe. After all, this is a man with a winning percentage nearing 80 as captain. But when the chairman of selectors, Ajit Agarkar, announced the Asia Cup squad last month, the message coming out of BCCI ’s ivory tower was unmistakable: a captain’s job isn’t just about winning series — the runs need to flow from his own bat.As captain, Surya featured in 22 matches, scoring 558 runs at an average of 26.57, with one century and four half-centuries. Those numbers pale in comparison to his blistering form before the captaincy crown weighed heavily on his head. Back then, in 61 games, free of leadership duties, he plundered 2,040 runs at an eye-popping average of 43.40, studded with three centuries and 17 fifties.Since that attractive 75 against Bangladesh in Hyderabad last Oct, the runs dried up. The five-match England series at home was a personal low point where he scored 28 with a highest of 21 and a couple of ducks to rub salt into the wounds.The whispers ahead of the Asia Cup selection were that Surya was told in no uncertain terms — fix your batting first.“His numbers dropping (while leading India) is a worry,” says former India opener Wasim Jaffer, who captained Surya in his early days in First-Class cricket with Mumbai.“Him not getting the runs is a concern. In the last few internationals he played, he was looking to score mostly behind square on the leg side. His shot selection was not up to the mark. But he has since worked on his game, and as we saw, he was a completely different player in the IPL. He started scoring on the offside as well. When Surya plays shots all around the wicket, there’s not much the bowlers can do. He is very dangerous. Then there isn’t margin for the bowlers. He has done well in the IPL; hopefully, that should continue.”The numbers back Jaffer’s words. Last season, Surya was in vintage mode — 717 runs in 16 innings at a sizzling strike rate of 168.But the Asia Cup is a different beast. It brings its own pressures — multiple teams, high stakes, and a captain’s plate overflowing with responsibility. For Surya, the challenge isn’t just about getting the batting order right or nailing the team combination. It’s about setting the tone while batting at whatever number he chooses to and proving he can still own the stage.Yet, there’s another subplot to deal with. There will be four captains in the XI, counting Surya. Hardik Pandya and Jasprit Bumrah have led India before. Gill, evidently, is being groomed for future leadership. Could this be a recipe for confusion? Jaffer doesn’t think so.“Every tour, every series, you have a vice-captain. It doesn’t mean the captain is under threat,” he says. “Selectors have made it clear — Bumrah can’t play every series, so he’s out. Hardik? They’re not looking at him for now. That leaves Shubman and maybe Shreyas when he’s back.“On the contrary, experienced heads like Hardik, Bumrah, and Shubman will only help in crunch moments. But at the end of the day, Surya must make the tough calls.” For a man who redefined T20 batting with his audacious stroke play, the question now is whether he can find his magic under the weight of expectation. The Asia Cup isn’t just another tournament for Suryakumar Yadav. It’s an exam — and the world is waiting to see if SKY emerges from the shadow of doubts.“Every tournament has its own challenges,” Jaffer explains. “This is a multi-nation cup. Before this, it was just bilateral series. India bounced back well to win the series after losing matches to South Africa and England. It’s not that he hasn’t been under pressure before, but this will be different. Knowing him, he won’t overthink. He’ll deal with it.”Jaffer believes Surya’s personality makes him suited for the role. “He’s done this job for a while now. He’s comfortable at this level. He’s a good communicator and gets the message across.”",Suryakumar Yadav has struggled to find his best form as India's T20 captain. The 27-year-old scored 558 runs at an average of 26.57 in 22 matches as captain.
