Anna Kournikova, 44, reveals pregnancy with Enrique Iglesias after health scare

Anna Kournikova and Enrique Iglesias’ family life in Miami

“It was just meant to be sweet in the moment. I honestly didn’t mean to confuse people.

I thought it’d be easier for the audience to understand than if I said ‘my girl.’”

“I’ve never really thought marriage would make a difference. Maybe it’s because I come from divorced parents, but I don’t think you love someone more because of a piece of paper.”

Former tennis star Anna Kournikova, 44, is pregnant with her fourth child with long-time partner, singer Enrique Iglesias, 50. The news was reported on Thursday by Spanish magazine Hola, which said that the Russian athlete is already halfway through her pregnancy and “everything is going well. ” This comes only months after she was spotted in a wheelchair in Miami, wearing a protective boot, sparking concern about her health.The couple, who have been together since 2001, already share three children- twins Lucy and Nicholas, both 7, and their younger daughter Mary, who is 5.Anna Kournikova was last photographed in early August in Miami, where she was seen taking her children to martial arts classes, a rare public outing that reassured fans after earlier health concerns.Anna Kournikova retired from professional tennis in 2003 at just 21 after repeated injuries to her back and feet. Her health history made the sight of her in a wheelchair in January this year especially worrying for fans. She was seen at Bal Harbour Mall in Miami, wearing an orthopedic boot, but later appeared to recover well.Anna Kournikova and Iglesias have built a private family life in Miami, where the Spanish singer has lived since the late 1990s. The couple first met in 2001 when Kournikova appeared in Enrique Iglesias’s music video for his hit single Escape. Although they have been together for over two decades, they have never confirmed if they are married. Iglesias once explained in 2012:He also shared his views on marriage, saying:The couple recently expanded their property portfolio in Miami by purchasing a five-bedroom home in Bay Point for $6.5 million, according to the Miami Herald.Also Read: “No Room For Emotions”: Novak Djokovic Reveals How Athlete Stereotypes Hurt His Relationship With Wife Jelena While Enrique Iglesias continues touring worldwide, Kournikova has kept a very low profile.

Givani Smith joins Hurricanes on a professional try-out contract



Hurricanes seek depth to finally overcome Eastern Conference Final struggles



The Carolina Hurricanes are turning to an unlikely source as they prepare for a season that could define their future. After falling to the Florida Panthers in the Eastern Conference Final, Carolina is determined to find answers. One of those answers could come from a familiar face in Florida, as the Canes announced professional try-out deals with forward Givani Smith and defenseman Oliver Kylington ahead of training camp.The most intriguing signing for Hurricanes fans is Givani Smith. Once a teammate of Matthew Tkachuk during his stint with the Florida Panthers, Smith now finds himself battling for relevance in Raleigh. His path to this moment has been anything but steady. Drafted 46th overall by the Detroit Red Wings in 2016, Smith debuted in the NHL during the 2019–20 season, scoring two goals and adding an assist in 21 games.His time in Detroit eventually led to a trade to the Panthers in 2022, where he struggled to cement a role on a deep roster. Though part of the group that made a magical run to the Stanley Cup Final in 2023, Smith played just a single postseason game and failed to register a point. Since then, he has become a journeyman, making stops with the Sharks, Avalanche, and Flyers. Now, Carolina presents a last-chance window for the 26-year-old forward to prove his worth.For Carolina, the motivation behind these signings is no mystery. The franchise has repeatedly stumbled at the same hurdle, winning just one of its last 17 games in the Eastern Conference Final. The addition of Smith offers grit and a physical edge, while Kylington provides a potential boost to the blue line with his experience from Calgary, Colorado, and Anaheim.The message is clear: the Hurricanes are willing to take risks if it means breaking their postseason curse. Smith may not be the star that headlines the lineup, but his hunger to stick in the NHL could align perfectly with a Carolina squad desperate to climb over its long-standing wall.Also Read: Edmonton Oilers captain Connor McDavid appears destined for maximum deal as analyst reveals extension proof",Carolina Hurricanes announce professional try-out deals with Givani Smith and Oliver Kylington.

Fans furious at Connor Bedard’s ranking while defending other rising stars

Connor Bedard’s growth and Blackhawks’ hopes for their franchise star

The NHL Network’s latest list ranking the top 25 players under 25 years old has set social media ablaze, with Chicago Blackhawks star Connor Bedard at the center of the debate. Despite being touted as one of the league’s brightest young talents, Bedard landed in the eighth spot—far lower than many fans expected.The list placed Buffalo Sabres defenseman Rasmus Dahlin, New Jersey Devils forward Jack Hughes, and Ottawa Senators’ Tim Stutzle in the top three. But for many hockey fans, it was Bedard’s ranking that felt most disrespectful.“The Connor Bedard hate is hilarious. No chance he’s 8th hahahaha,” one fan wrote on X, echoing the sentiment of many others who felt the 2023 first overall pick should have been higher. Another fan blasted the list as an “absolute joke,” while others argued players like Lucas Raymond and Matvei Michkov were also undervalued.Not all reactions, however, defended Bedard. Some fans argued that his résumé didn’t yet justify a higher placement. “Based off what? Lol. What has Bedard done? Lucas Raymond will make you pay for your sins,” one user wrote, pointing out the small sample size of his NHL career.Since entering the league, Bedard has recorded 128 points in 150 games—a solid start for a 19-year-old forward leading a rebuilding Chicago team.NHL insider Frank Seravalli revealed that Bedard has been working on his skating and angling, while also developing a “shoot-first mentality” with a release he ranked second only to Auston Matthews.Also Read: Connor Bedard’s contract extension could wait until 2026 despite Frank Nazar’s $46M deal, says NHL analyst Bedard is now entering the final year of his entry-level contract, and the Blackhawks will likely push to lock him into a long-term extension.

NHL Trade Rumors: $81.5M star Artemi Panarin may face trade if Rangers miss postseason,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-rumors-81-5m-star-artemi-panarin-may-face-trade-if-rangers-miss-postseason/articleshow/123558875.cms,"Artemi Panarin (Getty Images)

Rangers face difficult decision with Artemi Panarin ’s contract and performance

New NHL Offseason Rumors | Insider Notebook 🏒

A possible extension could reshape New York’s roster core

Artemi Panarin has been the face of the New York Rangers since arriving in 2019 on a seven-year, $81.5 million contract. But as the superstar forward enters the final year of that deal, his future in New York is far from guaranteed. NHL insider Frank Seravalli suggested that if the Rangers fail to reach the postseason in 2025-26, management could be forced to put their highest-paid player on the trade block.Now 34, Artemi Panarin is not expected to command the same $11.6 million AAV he currently carries, though his offensive pedigree still makes him one of the league’s elite. Just last season, he came off a 120-point campaign with 49 goals, proving he can still dominate. However, his most recent year was a step back, with 89 points and a -9 rating — his lowest output in a full season as a Ranger.That inconsistency has fueled speculation about his long-term role. Seravalli explained the situation bluntly: “I could for sure see that happening if the New York Rangers are out. But I’m going to tell you this, I don’t think the Rangers are going to be out. I have the Rangers as a playoff team.”Cap space will play a major role in the Rangers’ decision. With just under $30 million projected for 2026, re-signing Panarin to a double-digit AAV extension would commit the team to a veteran-heavy top six.Alongside Mika Zibanejad, Vincent Trocheck, and J.T. Miller — all in their 30s with multiple years left on their contracts — New York would be doubling down on experience over youth.Seravalli believes that outcome remains likely if Panarin produces. “I’ve got lots of faith in Artemi Panarin, and I think there’s a deal on the table that makes sense for both sides or will be at some point during this upcoming season,” he said.Also Read: Winnipeg Jets captain Adam Lowry shocks fans with stunning recovery from hip surgery ahead of schedule For now, Panarin’s performance may determine whether the Rangers build around him once more — or cash in on his value before time runs out.","Rangers face difficult decision with Artemi Panarin ’s contract and performance.

Former Maple Leafs forward brutally questions Golden Knights star’s NHL ranking with surprising “not like won the masters” jab,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/former-maple-leafs-forward-brutally-questions-golden-knights-stars-nhl-ranking-with-surprising-not-like-won-the-masters-jab/articleshow/123569639.cms,"Ex-Leafs forward downplays Golden Knights star’s ranking, sparking heated debate among NHL fans and analysts alike

Is Jack Eichel overrated despite his Stanley Cup win?



Looking ahead: Eichel’s legacy on the line



The Vegas Golden Knights have leaned heavily on Jack Eichel since acquiring him in 2021, and he hasn’t disappointed. With a career-best 94 points in 77 games last season and a central role in securing the 2023 Stanley Cup, Eichel’s impact is undeniable. Yet, his recent placement in NHL Network’s top-20 centers list has stirred controversy, leaving fans and analysts questioning whether his ranking reflects reality or reputation.When the rankings placed Connor McDavid , Nathan MacKinnon, Leon Draisaitl, Aleksander Barkov, and Sidney Crosby in the top five, many expected Eichel to be close behind. Instead, his lower-than-anticipated position triggered debate. Former Toronto Maple Leafs forward Jay Rosehill, speaking on Leafs Morning Take, was particularly candid. He argued that context matters more than pure numbers when evaluating Eichel’s status.Rosehill remarked, “The one guy I looked at is Jack Eichel. I understand he’s got a cup, but it’s not like he won the Masters, like it was a purely individual effort.” In his view, Eichel benefited from being part of a well-constructed Vegas roster, rather than carrying the team singlehandedly. He added that not every player with a championship ring automatically deserves to be elevated into the sport’s pantheon.Still, Rosehill admitted that Eichel’s production places him among the NHL’s best forwards, even if he stops short of generational status. With mid-90s points last season and the potential to break the 100-point barrier, Eichel remains an elite offensive force—just perhaps not on the same tier as legends like Crosby or Draisaitl.The coming seasons may be decisive in shaping how Eichel is remembered. His current trajectory suggests he’ll remain a cornerstone for the Golden Knights, but the question lingers—can he transcend being “a piece of it” and build a legacy as one of the league’s most dominant individual talents?With a possible mega-contract extension looming next summer, the spotlight on Eichel will only intensify. For now, his blend of skill, consistency, and championship pedigree keeps him firmly in the conversation, even if opinions differ on just how high he belongs in the NHL hierarchy.Also Read: Edmonton Oilers captain Connor McDavid appears destined for maximum deal as analyst reveals extension proof",Jack Eichel's ranking in NHL Network's top-20 centers list has stirred controversy.

Connor McDavid prioritizes patience and perspective

Edmonton’s confidence in their captain’s future

The future of Connor McDavid , widely considered the best player in hockey today, has been a constant source of speculation in Edmonton and across the NHL. With just one season left on his current eight-year, $100 million contract, fans and analysts alike have wondered if the Oilers captain is prepared to lock in his long-term future or test the waters of free agency. This week, McDavid addressed those questions directly, offering insight into why he isn’t in a hurry to make a decision.Speaking to reporters, Connor McDavid emphasized that his approach hasn’t changed since the summer. “I said at the end of June, I had every intention to take my time with it, and I still feel the same way,” he explained. “I’ll take my time and go through everything with my family, my agent, and everybody involved.”While his next deal will likely reshape the league financially, McDavid stressed that his focus remains on winning. “I have every intention to win in Edmonton,” he said. “That’s my only focus, maybe next to winning a gold medal with Canada. But that is my intention: to win there.”Despite the uncertainty, Oilers leadership remains optimistic. Jeff Jackson, the team’s CEO of hockey operations and McDavid’s former agent, downplayed concerns of a prolonged saga.“He has another year. He loves playing in Edmonton… It’s not going to be a long negotiation,” Jackson said on The Sheet with Jeff Marek Podcast.With training camp set to open on September 17 and the season beginning October 8 against rival Calgary, McDavid is determined to keep the focus on hockey. “All options are on the table, really,” he said. “We’re going through it slowly.”Also Read: Amid contract deadline Connor McDavid and Lauren Kyle spark buzz as they take a private jet back to Edmonton","The future of Connor McDavid has been a constant source of speculation in Edmonton and across the NHL.

“I think Mason has a unique combination of size, skill, and strength,” Botterill told NHL.com. “He works well down in the corners and around the net.”

Dallas Stars goalie Jake Oettinger has spoken for the first time since his close friend Mason Marchment was traded to the Seattle Kraken in June 2025.

For him, it felt like losing family.Oettinger told NHL insider Sam Nestler earlier this week. “That’s one you never really get over. Just as good as it gets as a guy and a teammate.”Two draft picks were exchanged by the Dallas Stars on June 25, 2025, for Mason Marchment to the Kraken: a fourth-round pick in 2025 and Mason Marchment, who had just finished a great season with Dallas, with 25 assists, 22 goals, 47 points, and a +15 rating, was picked in the third round in 2026.Jake Oettinger claims that family ties rather than only hockey were the most difficult component.

Multiple overdoses and concerns about prescribed treatments

A complicated man who left his mark on the NFL



Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay, who passed away in May at the age of 65, spent much of his final years battling addiction behind the scenes. While fans knew him as one of the NFL ’s most outspoken and passionate owners, a new report from The Washington Post sheds light on the troubling private struggles that marked his last chapter.Irsay, who had long been candid about his history with substance abuse, reportedly suffered at least three overdoses in the final five years of his life. According to the report, his addiction specialist, Dr. Harry Haroutunian, prescribed him significant amounts of opioids and ketamine as part of a treatment plan. Sources revealed that Irsay had been given more than 200 opioid pills shortly before two overdoses in December 2023.One of those incidents occurred at Irsay’s Carmel, Indiana home, where first responders found him unresponsive on a bathroom floor. He was revived after receiving Narcan, a life-saving opioid antagonist. Less than two weeks later, he reportedly overdosed again at a Miami resort. Another episode took place in 2020 while vacationing in Turks and Caicos, requiring hospitalization.Haroutunian defended his approach, saying, “I dedicated 18 months of my life to try to care for him … as a brother.We did everything we could to make him as comfortable as possible.” Still, several people close to Irsay questioned whether the treatments were helping or enabling his relapses.Irsay’s official cause of death was cardiac arrest caused by acute pneumonia, but his long battle with addiction overshadowed his final years. In a candid 2023 interview with HBO’s Real Sports, he admitted he had been to rehab “at least 15 times” and even once overdosed while trying to detox on his own.Also Read: “Dear Son..."": Travis Hunter welcomes baby boy with wife Leanna in emotional surprise for fans everywhere amidst all breakup rumors Despite his personal struggles, Irsay’s contributions to the NFL remain significant.

Engagement joy collides with questions about Travis Kelce’s retirement

The engagement of pop superstar Taylor Swift and Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce was bound to be a headline-grabber, but the announcement has gone far beyond romance. Within hours of Swift sharing dreamy photos of Kelce on one knee in a flower-filled garden, their personal milestone had transformed into a global entertainment and sports storyline.The entertainment-sports crossover has reached new levels, with betting markets quickly posting odds on who might stand alongside the couple during their big day. Unsurprisingly, Jason Kelce, Travis’s older brother and former Philadelphia Eagles center, is the overwhelming favorite to serve as best man at -5000. His close bond with Travis, from their “New Heights” podcast to their historic Super Bowl clash in 2023, makes him the obvious choice.Swift’s bridal party has sparked even more intrigue. Childhood best friend Abigail Anderson Lucier leads the maid of honor betting line at +350, followed by model Martha Hunt (+400) and fashion star Karlie Kloss (+500). Pop icon Selena Gomez is also listed at +500, adding fuel to fan speculation that her appearance could turn the wedding into a true cultural spectacle.The betting doesn’t stop at the aisle. Novelty wagers already extend to when the couple might start a family and whether Swift will finally accept the NFL’s repeated offers to headline the Super Bowl halftime show, a stage she has famously declined in the past.Amid the excitement, Chiefs fans can’t ignore a more sobering reality—Kelce’s NFL future. Now 35 and entering his 13th season, his production dipped in 2024, culminating in a quiet performance during the Super Bowl loss to the Eagles.

Tom Brady’s shock at Gisele Bündchen’s announcement

From surprise to acceptance and focus on family

Celebrity breakups often come with unexpected turns, and the split between Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen was no exception. Two years after finalizing their divorce in 2022, the supermodel surprised fans and her ex-husband alike when news broke in October 2024 that she was expecting her first child with Brazilian jiu-jitsu trainer Joaquim Valente.According to Page Six, Brady was caught off guard when Bündchen personally told him about the pregnancy. An insider revealed, “Tom knew that things were serious between Gisele and Joaquim but he never imagined they would be having a child together… So when Gisele broke the news to him he was stunned, to say the least.”The former NFL quarterback, who shares two children—Benjamin and Vivian—with Bündchen, reportedly needed time to process the development. He is also father to Jack, his eldest son with actress Bridget Moynahan.Despite the initial shock, Brady’s outlook softened quickly. The same source noted, “After the initial shock wore off, he’s grown used to the idea and he’s happy for Gisele. At the end of the day, Tom’s sole focus is on his children and his career. What Gisele decides to do with her own life is really none of his business.”Reports at the time revealed that Bündchen, then 44, was already several months along and preparing for a home birth.She and Valente, who began dating in mid-2023, even chose to wait until the delivery to learn the baby’s sex.Also Read: “Playing pity party”: Fans accuse Gisele Bündchen of ‘playing victim’ after crying over Tom Brady divorce Looking back, the news underscored how Brady and Bündchen were moving into separate but fulfilling lives.

Engagement puts spotlight on Taylor Swift’s fortune and celebrity parallels

The engagement of Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce and global superstar Taylor Swift has captivated fans far beyond football, but the fairytale moment also carries weighty implications for Kelce’s future in the NFL. At 35 and entering the last year of his contract, questions are growing louder about whether this will be his final season.NFL veteran analyst Pete Prisco didn’t hold back when evaluating where Kelce stands at this stage. “He is in the final year of his deal. He is coming to the end of his career... And he wasn't that good last year, but he seemed to be refocused this off season,” Prisco said on CBS Sports.He even noted that Kelce “almost looked lean at times” in 2024, lacking his trademark explosiveness, though preseason flashes with Patrick Mahomes have reassured fans that the connection is still intact.Kelce’s playoff dip last year — just 175 receiving yards, his lowest since 2018 — fueled the narrative that age may finally be catching up. Still, his reported renewed commitment in the gym and offseason preparation suggests he’s eager to write one last chapter worthy of his Hall of Fame résumé.Beyond football, Kelce’s engagement has triggered cultural comparisons to one of the most famous athlete-celebrity marriages of the past: Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen.Analyst Chris Hassel quipped, “That’s chump change for Taylor. I mean, it’s like Tom Brady with his wife. She was making more too.”With Swift’s billion-dollar empire dwarfing Kelce’s $17 million annual salary, even Prisco joked that Kelce had “married up.” But just like Brady and Bündchen, the fascination lies not in the money but in the intersection of sports greatness and pop culture royalty.Also Read: Taylor Swift proves the number 13 is her destiny as she gets engaged to her 13th boyfriend Travis Kelce For Chiefs fans, however, the bigger question is whether Kelce’s walk down the aisle will also lead to his walk away from the game.","Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift's engagement has captivated fans far beyond football.

Jacksonville Jaguars rookie cornerback Travis Hunter may be preparing for his first NFL season, but much of the talk around him this offseason hasn’t been about football. Instead, social media chatter around Hunter’s personal life – specifically his relationship with Leanna Lenee – has taken center stage. Online trolling exploded in recent weeks, with many fans questioning Lenee’s intentions and loyalty. The backlash grew intense enough that Lenee acknowledged how deeply the negativity affected her mental health. Despite the noise, she never left Hunter’s side.Amid all the drama, Travis Hunter’s mother, Ferrante Edmonds, showed why she’s been a pillar of strength in his life. Known for her loyalty and support, Edmonds didn’t jump into the controversy – but she didn’t stay completely silent either. She posted a simple but loving message to her son, that read, “I love you, baby @db3_tip, on to the next level. I’m so proud of you.”When the online heat ramped up, Edmonds had said, “Everything that is said doesn’t need to be addressed.” In another post, she doubled down on the idea of protecting peace, “Until it’s done. Tell no one.” In today’s online-first world, where every move is documented and shared, Edmonds’ message struck a chord with fans.She urged her son – and others – to guard their blessings, stay grounded and let actions speak louder than words.While most couples might clap back, Hunter and Lenee reacted with something more powerful. They welcomed a baby boy – turning a wave of hate into a season of joy. In a heartfelt message announcing the birth, Lenee shared, “He was crying, he was perfect.” She called the moment a “wave of peace” that made everything else fade away.Jacksonville Jaguars rookie and Heisman Trophy winner Travis Hunter and his wife, Leanna Lenee, quietly announced the arrival of their first child – a baby boy – in a heartfelt YouTube video titled “Dear Son…”, on August 27.

Beyond the money: Ja’Marr Chase and Tee Higgins share a rare bond off the field

Why the Bengals believe this duo changes everything

The NFL may be shifting back toward run-heavy offenses, but in Cincinnati, the Bengals are doubling down on the passing game—and on the dynamic duo of Ja’Marr Chase and Tee Higgins. Both wideouts inked massive extensions earlier this year, with Chase signing a four-year, $161 million deal and Higgins landing $115 million over four years. Together, they now form the highest-paid wide receiver tandem in league history.What makes this partnership unique isn’t just their talent, but the relationship they’ve built beyond football. From shopping for exotic cars in Florida to hosting “Taco Tuesday” gatherings for teammates, Chase and Higgins embody a chemistry that’s shaping the Bengals’ locker room culture. Higgins, who jokes about turning a wall in his new Florida home into a jellyfish tank, and Chase, who admits he’s tired of being asked to perform the Griddy, share a friendship rooted in honesty and accountability.Higgins recalls a moment when Chase mistakenly set up a play that left him blindsided. Chase didn’t sugarcoat it, walking over to say simply, “S---. My f---ing bad, bro.” For both players, that honesty became a building block for trust—a rare trait in a position group often plagued by ego.On the field, their impact is undeniable. Chase’s ability to command double coverage opens lanes for Higgins, while Higgins’ presence prevents defenses from focusing solely on Chase. As offensive coordinator Dan Pitcher noted, “Literally any time Ja’Marr makes a play against single coverage you can make a case that he’s only seeing single coverage because Tee is also on the field.”Also Read: “People don’t appreciate”: Greg Olsen sparks debate with bold defense of Aaron Rodgers after failed Jets stint The NFL may be leaning back toward the ground game, but the Bengals are betting that the Chase-Higgins connection—equal parts production and unselfishness—can carry them past Kansas City and toward a Super Bowl",Ja’Marr Chase and Tee Higgins are the highest-paid wide receiver tandem in league history.

MUMBAI: Cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar 's annual party, postponed after being initially planned in May because of a war-like situation between India and neighbours Pakistan, finally happened at the Mumbai Cricket Association's Bandra-Kurla Complex Recreation Club on Sunday night. Incidentally, it turned out to be the same day when India's Test batting stalwart Cheteshwar Pujara announced his retirement from cricket.Just a day earlier (on August 23), Gavaskar and former ICC, BCCI , and MCA president Sharad Pawar had unveiled a statue of himself at the entrance of the MCA's Sharad Pawar Cricket Museum.Gavaskar's fierce patriotism came to the fore when the invitation card for the party itself mentioned that the event was being held to ""celebrate the success of Operation Sindoor and the performance of the Indian cricket team in England, which has won the hearts of all Indians."" Operation Sindoor was India's substantial response to Pakistan in the wake of the Pahalgam attacks on April 22. While led by a young, debutant captain in Shubman Gill, India, against all expectations, drew a hard-fought series against England 2-2 while playing some thoroughly entertaining and magnificent cricket.On the occasion, Gavaskar didn't forget to remember his old childhood friends who had departed and were a regular feature at his annual event.At the entrance of the hall, Gavaskar remembered all his childhood friends and former Mumbai teammates Milind Rege, Ehsan Hakim, Vijay Karkhanis, Padmakar Shivalkar, Abdul Ismail and his India teammate Dilip Doshi, with their names inscribed on miniature bats.Present on the occasion was former India captain Nari Contractor, who is 91 now. However, three other cricketers of yesteryear who are all in their 90s — ex-India allrounder Chandu Borde, ex-India ‘keeper Chandu Patankar, and former Rajasthan leg-spinner Chandu Joshi — couldn’t make it due to health reasons. Apparently, Joshi started off from Pune for the party, but had to return from Lonavala as he wasn’t feeling well.The guests at the do included Dilip Vengsarkar, India's 1983 World Cup heroes Sandeep Patil and Balwinder Singh Sandhu, former India wicketkeeper and ex-Kolkata Knight Riders and current Madhya Pradesh head coach Chandrakant Pandit, ex-India players Pravin Amre, Raju Kulkarni, Yajurvindra Singh Bilkha and Jatin Paranjape. Ex-India seamer-turned-commentator Irfan Pathan's presence attracted eyeballs too.In a video message, Gavaskar said, “What a wonderful last 10 days it has been! On August 15, which was our 78th Independence Day, it also happened to be my mother's 100th birth anniversary. Our family got together, it was such a fun evening. I'm pretty certain that my parents, my mother, looking from the heavens above, would have also had fun seeing practically the whole family get together to celebrate her 100th birthday. ”“And then a few days later, my statue was unveiled at the Wankhede Stadium, something which I had not even dreamt of when I started playing cricket in the Bhagirathi buildings. And the day after that, we got together to celebrate Operation Sindoor and the young Indian team's performance in England. It was the annual get-together that I generally have for all those whom I have played with right from school, college, club, and Ranji Trophy level, so it was also such a wonderful evening. I can't be thankful enough to God almighty to have the opportunity to have a get-together and celebrate all three occasions with all my family and friends. Normally, it is Milind and Anil Joshi (Gavaskar’s old friend) who organise everything, but this time I’m thankful to Anil for organising the party. We missed Milind Rege, Abdul bhai Ismail, my skipper ‘Papa’ Karkhanis, ‘Paddy’ Shivalkar, and Dilip Doshi. We also missed some others who couldn’t make it.”As usual, Gavaskar's party didn't have any speeches or loud music, just some precious anecdotes that went perfectly with the alcohol and some highly delicious food that was served right through the evening.",Cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar held his annual party on Sunday night.

NEW DELHI: Every bowler - spinner or pacer - remembers his first wicket. For Delhi quick Prince Yadav, the answer comes instantly: Travis Head. The Lucknow Super Giants pacer marked his maiden IPL scalp with a searing yorker that shattered the Sunrisers Hyderabad opener’s stumps. Arms raised to the sky, Yadav soaked in a night he will never forget - with the butterflies lasting till morning.He sprinted towards his captain Rishabh Pant, exchanged high-fives, and hugged him, while the team mentor applauded from the dugout.The 23-year-old pacer from Delhi featured in six matches in IPL 2025 and took three wickets – Travis Head (SRH), Nehal Wadhera (Punjab Kings), and Will Jacks (Mumbai Indians). Interestingly, all three dismissals came via bowled.Prince, who first came into the spotlight during last year's Delhi Premier League, earned his IPL contract on the back of his strong performances. He credits Rishabh Pant for playing a key role in his journey.""Rishabh Pant always guided me. He often told me that in pressure situations, you should never let the pressure get to you and must always find a way out. The quicker you learn to handle pressure, the faster you will grow,"" Prince told TimesofIndia.com.""Whenever I felt doubt or pressure at any point, I would talk to him and he would immediately clear it for me. He knows how to bounce back. Even if he wasn't performing at times, he never let it affect the team or himself. He kept the same bonding with everyone, the same energy, and always stayed positive,"" he said.Prince had a strong debut season in the Delhi Premier League, where he made the new ball talk and showcased his yorkers, finishing with 13 wickets in 10 innings in 2024. He followed it up with another fine run, emerging as Delhi's leading wicket-taker in the 2024-25 Vijay Hazare Trophy with 11 wickets in six matches at an average of 22.On the back of these performances, Lucknow Super Giants secured his services at his base price of Rs 30 lakh in the 2025 IPL auction.""Every day we wake up to learn something new. Recently, I got to learn a lot from Rishabh bhai. My first interaction with him was during the first match of Purani Dilli 6, where he was the captain. After the match, I spent almost the whole night sitting with him. I learnt many things from that experience. He was quite impressed with me, and later I got more opportunities,"" Prince recalled.""Two or three franchises had called me for trials, but LSG picked me. My trials went well almost everywhere, but the support I got from LSG was immense. I had been a net bowler with them earlier, and that helped me a lot.""When I started taking wickets, I got a contract worth 30 lakh, which was a big step. Vijay Dahiya sir, who was part of the LSG support staff as assistant coach, also guided me a lot,"" he said.""Zaheer sir has always backed me and taught me valuable lessons. Even as a net bowler, I bowled to almost all the players, and this year, as part of the main squad, I bowled to everyone in matches too. I even managed to dismiss some big names,"" the fast bowler added.Prince also draws inspiration from South African pace legend Dale Steyn.""When I was very young, my favourite bowler was Brett Lee, but later Dale Steyn became my idol. I loved his aggression. I haven't met him yet, but I would love to meet him someday and take bowling tips from him,"" Prince said.",Prince Yadav took three wickets in IPL 2025 for Lucknow Super Giants.

Former New Zealand pacer Neil Wagner has opened up about one of the defining contests of his career — the 2014 Auckland Test against India — where he exposed Virat Kohli ’s early struggles with the short ball but admitted that MS Dhoni appeared to have decoded his tactics.Speaking on the Red Inker Cricket Podcast, Wagner, now 39, revealed how a flat yet lively Eden Park surface gave him the chance to unsettle Kohli.""This Test match, I remember the wicket being quite flat, but there was a bit of pace and bounce. Eden Park is quite small on the straight, but the square boundaries there are pockets that are helpful. I remember bowling a couple of bouncers and how they played it, and particularly [Virat] Kohli looked a bit unsettled. He didn't know if he should take it on or not and how to play,"" Wagner recalled.Explaining the dismissal, Wagner said: ""The idea was trying to go cross and outside eyeline. He (Kohli) tried to pull it in front of square because there's protection out. Him trying to pull it in front of square, he just got a toe end on it and it carried through to BJ Watling. He got a bottom edge on it and it created a bit of a mode.""India were chasing 407 in the fourth innings, with Kohli scoring a fighting 67 and Dhoni later steadying the chase alongside Ravindra Jadeja . At 268/5, India even threatened to pull off a famous win.But Wagner struck again.""Then Dhoni and Jadeja looked like they were going to chase it down and play a phenomenal innings.

Paris Olympics 2024: Neeraj Chopra Wins Silver, Pak's Arshad Nadeem Breaks Record | 'Also Our Son'

Two-time Olympic medallist Neeraj Chopra had to settle for a runner-up finish in the Diamond League Final for the third year in a row as Germany’s Julian Weber produced a commanding performance to win his maiden title with two massive 90m-plus throws in Zurich on Thursday.Weber lit up the event with a season world-leading 91.57m effort, also his personal best, coming in the second round. He had already set the tone with 91.37m in his opening attempt, and from there it was a one-man show. None of his rivals came close to the German, whose five legal throws all went beyond 83m, underlining his dominance in the seven-man field.Chopra, meanwhile, had an uncharacteristically modest series. The 27-year-old Indian began with 84.35m and then slipped with efforts of 82m and a foul. At the halfway stage, he was placed third behind Trinidad and Tobago’s Keshorn Walcott. Two more fouls followed before he salvaged his night with a final-round 85.01m to snatch back second place, edging Walcott by just six centimeters. Defending champion Anderson Peters of Grenada finished fourth with 82.06m.“This was not too bad,” Chopra reflected after the event. “We are getting close to the world championships, so I still need to throw a little further.A few things went well, a few things did not. But I am very happy for Julian – he managed to throw really far. Showing 91m was really good.”The modest return was a rare off-day for Chopra, who has made a habit of breaching the 88m mark in recent seasons and famously crossed the 90m barrier earlier this year in Doha. He acknowledged that the focus now shifts to Tokyo, where he will defend his world title next month. “At major championships, the gold is more important than the far throws. So I will try my best to win the medal,” he said.For Weber, it was another breakthrough in a season where he has already thrown over 90m three times, including his 91.06m effort in Doha in May. Thursday’s win also gave him a 3-1 edge over Chopra in head-to-head contests this season, although the Indian still holds a dominant 15-5 overall record.Chopra has not finished outside the top two in any competition since June 2021. But on the biggest Diamond League stage, Weber’s night of brilliance ensured the Indian star had to settle for second best yet again.",Two-time Olympic medallist Neeraj Chopra had to settle for a runner-up finish in the Diamond League Final for the third year in a row.

Poll Is it more important for a fast bowler to focus on speed or accuracy? Speed Accuracy Both are equally important

Bengaluru: Mohammed Shami is barely a week away from his 35th birthday and much slower than he once was, but the fire within hasn’t dimmed. Neither has the tenacity to fight. With several of his illustrious teammates having called it a day in recent times, Shami has received many not-so-subtle hints to walk off into the sunset.But the premier fast bowler isn’t throwing in the towel just yet, and as he reiterated just a couple of days ago, “The day I get bored, I will leave. You don’t pick me, don’t play me, I don’t care. But I will keep working hard.”Arguably one of India’s finest pace-bowling exponents, Shami has his focus set on the 2027 50-over World Cup. Mentally, he is all there. The question is, will his body hold up? His last appearance in the ODI format, after all, was in the Champions Trophy final in Dubai in March earlier this year.Playing in his first competitive red-ball game since Nov 2024, the Bengal pacer was slow but not rusty in the Duleep Trophy tie between East and North Zone at the BCCI Centre of Excellence here on Thursday. He bowled 17 overs spread over four spells, focusing more on accuracy rather than speed, on a surface that offered considerable bounce but little seam movement.He was effective but not incisive, looking primarily to test his injury-ravaged body.In his first spell of five overs, his inswingers from good length troubled the right-handers — openers Shubham Khajuria and Ankit Kumar, in particular — while his next spell of three overs was rather uneventful, barring a few edges towards fine leg.Post lunch, Shami switched ends and gears. He appeared to have assessed the conditions to his satisfaction, and his third spell of 4-2-9-0 was his best of the day. Shami was more probing, as he tempted Ayush Badoni and Yash Dhull in the corridor outside off. He finally struck late in the day with a delivery that sent back Sahil Lotra.Shami continued the probing line and in the 70th over, Lotra offered a thick edge to wicketkeeper Kumar Kushagra. The catch was redemption for Kushagra, who had earlier dropped Kanhaiya Wadhwan off Shami. With rain ensuring an early end, it will be interesting to see how Shami and his new-ball partner Mukesh Kumar , who went out for nine overs due to a niggle, fare on a moist surface.","Mohammed Shami was slow but not rusty in the Duleep Trophy tie between East and North Zone.

Poll Who do you think will win the Asia Cup opener between India and China? India China It's going to be a draw

Rajgir: For nearly half-an-hour, the Indian men’s hockey team waited on the turf under the hot afternoon sun unable to begin their practice session as their sticks were getting checked by the officials as is the norm ahead of a tournament.Safe to say it wasn’t something that they enjoyed doing but it certainly helped them get accustomed to the conditions because they will play the Asia Cup opener against China at 3pm at Rajgir Sports here on Friday.While on paper, India will be the overwhelming favourites, China won’t make it easy for them with Dutchman Michel van den Heuvel as their coach. He has previously coached the Dutch men’s national team, Pakistan men’s team and, very recently, was the coach of the Belgian men’s national team till the Paris Olympics.China have also brought in former India coach Roelant Oltmans into their setup and the Dutch duo will surely have something up their sleeves to trouble the Indians.India, though, are ranked seventh in the world and have dominated the Asian tournaments in recent years. They won the Asian Champions Trophy twice in a row and, playing with a junior side, finished third in the last Asia Cup. They also won the Asian Games in 2023.However, India are coming into the tournament after a terrible outing in the European leg of the FIH Pro League where they lost seven matches in a row. But after that the team regrouped, trained together in Bengaluru for six weeks and coach Craig Fulton sounded quite happy about how it turned out.“We had a really good training camp. We had a lot of good meetings about it. We put a lot of emphasis on tactics in terms of how to get more balls into the 25 (yards), more balls into the D to create more scoring chances which then would help us be a bit more effective on the scoreboard and obviously defending,” said the coach during a press conference here on Thursday.To assess themselves and to get the necessary match practice ahead of this tournament, the Indian team then went to Australia where they played four games against the hosts and Fulton believes it was just the right kind of preparation.“It was competitive. We were focusing on all the tactical things that I discussed previously. We also wanted to get the players up to speed against a really strong opposition and a strong running team. Because with Asian hockey, it’s also man-to-man and you need a lot of good running skills,” he added.Meanwhile, captain Harmanpreet Singh , who missed a few games in Europe due to injury, sounded quite confident ahead of the event. Not only was he free flowing during the press conference but also during the practice session where he worked on his drag flicks, with Jugraj Singh by his side, and was on target on most of the occasions.The fans, who are expected to turn up in numbers on Friday, will surely love to hear this and will be eager to see it, too, on Friday when the hosts begin their campaign.Meanwhile, the opening match of the day will see Malaysia take on Bangladesh, followed by the match between defending champions South Korea and Chinese Taipei. Japan and Kazakhstan will then face off in the third game before the big match.","India take on China in the Asia Cup opener at Rajgir Sports on Friday.

Doris Burke stays with ESPN despite sudden demotion

Doris Burke made history with ESPN’s No. 1 NBA commentary team

Doris Burke has been demoted by ESPN in a sudden move that was allegedly called for by Executive Vice President Mike McQuade. She will no longer be with the ESPN No. 1 team, but will work with Dave Pasch on the No. 2 team instead. This sudden change has come as a surprise to many, as Burke had been working in the role since 2023. So the sudden change, to bring in Tim Legler, has caught the eye of many in the world of sports.Doris Burke gained a lot of recognition when she started in the role of an analyst for the NBA Finals back in 2023. She continued in that role alongside long-time play-by-play announcer Mike Breen and former NBA star Richard Jefferson until the 2025 finals. But as recent reports emerged, it seems like her time with the ESPN No. 1 has come to an end.But she is not going to leave ESPN, at least not yet. Instead, she will be working in a similar capacity on a “regular” basis alongside Dave Pasch on the No. 2 team. Back in June, a report from The Athletic, which was the first to report on this sudden demotion, had previously revealed that Burke’s position on the ESPN team was in jeopardy.Now, two months since then, it seems to have come true. But she has decided to stay with the company, even if it’s in a demoted capacity, having signed a multi-year contract extension.Doris Burke made history in the world of sports as the first woman to serve as a game analyst during a championship finals in 2023, when she joined ESPN’s No. 1 NBA commentary team. Working in one of the four major North American professional men's sports leagues - the National Basketball League aka NBA - Burke became the top woman in the sports analyst field.From beginning her career in radio to working her way through the grassroots level in ESPN to becoming the top female analyst in the NBA, Burke showed that with grit and determination, one can achieve anything. And though this demotion has surprised many, her staying on with the team at ESPN shows that she knows how to hold her place, even amid some turbulence.Also Read: Dwyane Wade gives a “shoutout to Michael Beasley"" - Not in NBA anymore, but still taking the basketball by storm","Doris Burke has been demoted by ESPN in a sudden move that was allegedly called for by Executive Vice President Mike McQuade.

“JuJu is a great young man,”

“He’s very talented. He just had some bad luck, and I hope he can turn things around with a change of scenery.”

JuJu Brents has a new team. On Wednesday, August 27, 2025, the Miami Dolphins claimed former Indianapolis Colts cornerback JuJu Brents off waivers. The Indianapolis Colts released him one day after reducing their squad to 53 players. A second-round selection in 2023, Brents graduated from Warren Central High School and grew up in Indianapolis. With one interception and 50 tackles, he appeared in just 11 games for the Colts. He now has a second chance in Miami.JuJu Brents will join a Dolphins defense that has been reshaping its secondary this summer. Miami recently cut Isaiah Johnson to make room for Brents and brought in seasoned cornerback Rasul Douglas.At 6-foot-3, Brents provides plenty of size and length at the position that helped him find success at Kansas State prior to his draft into the NFL.Although injuries hampered his development in Indianapolis, the Dolphins see Brents as a player with upside who may push for snaps this season.His presence could give defensive coordinator Anthony Weaver more possibilities in various coverage schemes and depth behind already established starters.JuJu Brents faced a tough stretch with the Colts. He lost nearly all of 2024 because of a knee injury and missed training camp this year with a hamstring issue.Colts general manager Chris Ballard spoke about the move on Wednesday.Ballard said.That change will come quickly.

Dallas Stars’ Thomas Harley’s breakout season positions him for massive NHL contract extension payday

Dallas Stars weigh contract ceiling for Thomas Harley and long-term NHL salary cap implications

Empty Netters,

Thomas Harley’s rise on the Dallas Stars’ blue line has quickly made him one of the NHL’s most intriguing young defensemen to watch heading into the 2025–26 season. After a breakout campaign where he filled in seamlessly for Miro Heiskanen, Harley has positioned himself as a cornerstone in Dallas, and according to insiders, he’s now on track for a massive contract extension that could reshape the team’s salary cap picture.The 24-year-old defenseman is entering the final year of his two-year, $4 million deal and has established himself as a vital part of the Stars’ top four. Last season, Harley recorded 16 goals and 34 assists for 50 points in 78 games, while adding 14 points in 18 playoff contests.Harley’s ability to step up during Heiskanen’s injury absence highlighted his growing importance to Dallas. His strong play even earned him recognition from Hockey Canada, where he was added to the 4 Nations roster as a late injury replacement. With the 2026 Winter Olympics on the horizon, Harley has a realistic chance of representing Team Canada, which would only boost his stock further.On a recent episode ofinsider Jeff Marek revealed that the Stars are using Miro Heiskanen’s $8.45 million contract as the ceiling for Harley’s future deal. That figure reflects Dallas’ commitment to keeping Heiskanen as the franchise’s defensive anchor, but also suggests Harley could earn a salary close to that mark depending on his performance this season.For Dallas, the challenge will be balancing Harley’s well-deserved raise with existing commitments to stars like Jason Robertson, Roope Hintz, and Jake Oettinger. Harley’s continued development ensures he will command a significant payday, and how the Stars structure his extension will be pivotal for their long-term salary cap strategy.Thomas Harley has gone from a promising first-round pick to a cornerstone defenseman in Dallas, and his next contract could reflect that transformation. With his breakout year behind him and a pivotal season ahead, Harley is not only strengthening the Stars’ blue line but also positioning himself as one of the league’s most notable contract extension candidates. Dallas now faces the task of rewarding Harley while preserving the cap flexibility needed to stay in contention.Also Read: Edmonton Oilers’ Connor McDavid crowned highest-rated player in NHL 26 by EA Sports","Dallas Stars’ Thomas Harley’s breakout season positions him for massive NHL contract extension payday.

NBA pro Russell Westbrook, is allegedly not likely to sign with the Sacramento Kings. It was thought to be his only possible destination. Nevertheless, this might leave him without a team to begin the new season. Given that stars like Malik Monk and DeMar DeRozan were both on the trade market, there have also been rumors that the team is shopping for a few of their own players. The news went viral after Sam Amick of The Athletic and NBA insider Jake Fischer gave their opinion on the same. Russell Westbrook , the NBA MVP, hit free agency in June after turning down the Denver Nuggets' $3.5 million player option. Little progress has been made on a possible deal for the future Hall of Famer since then.Sacramento Kings have been mentioned repeatedly as a possible destination, but Sam Amick of The Athletic recently claimed that the team is unlikely to pursue him until it moves another guard. Hence, the former NBA MVP is currently having a difficult offseason.In a report published on Thursday, the journalist further wrote:“More specifically, the odds of a Russell Westbrook signing go up if they know they’re completely out on Kuminga (though they aren’t expected to make that move unless they can free up rotation space by trading a guard).""Moreover, if not with the Sacramento Kings , it's possible that Russell Westbrook will start the season unsigned, according to a recent report by NBA source Jake Fischer. He then said;“We are still waiting to see what other moves could come in Sacramento before the Kings try to bring in Russell Westbrook… And that’s been the one home all along that we really have looked at for Russell Westbrook. And that is still the home I heard earlier this week for Russell Westbrook — if he’s gonna be in the NBA at all, honestly.”Additionally, it's impossible to predict where Russell Westbrook will wind up, or whether he will sign a contract prior to the season beginning.Russell Westbrook might be able to get the space he needs if Malik Monk leaves. According to reports, Sacramento Kings had intended for him to support newcomer Dennis Schroder by playing as the sixth man on the bench if a deal were to be reached.He is still among the best guards available in free agency. He averaged 13.3 points, 4.9 rebounds, and 6.1 assists per game in 75 games during his one and only season with Denver Nuggets in 2024-25. He has become one of the league's finest reserve players once he eventually accepted a spot off the bench a few seasons ago.He has also received votes for the NBA's Sixth Man of the Year award in each of the previous three seasons. Even though Westbrook's MVP-winning days in Oklahoma City are long gone, he can still make a valuable contribution to many of the league's competitive teams.Also read: Is Malik Monk leaving The Sacramento Kings?

Seth Curry’s search for NBA future after Charlotte Hornets season

Damion Lee’s overseas move puts more attention on Seth Curry

Also Read:

The Curry family is once again in the basketball spotlight. While Stephen Curry’s career with the Golden State Warriors is set in stone, questions surround the future of his younger brother, Seth Curry, and his brother-in-law, Damion Lee. One has taken a surprising step overseas, and the other is waiting for the right NBA call. The family’s next moves could shape their legacy in unexpected ways.Seth Curry, the 35-year-old brother of Stephen Curry, finished the 2023–24 season with the Charlotte Hornets. His playing time was limited, but he showed his sharp shooting touch again. He led the league in three-point accuracy, making almost 46% of his shots from deep. This skill keeps him valuable even in the later years of his career.In August 2024, reports from The Athletic’s James L. Edwards confirmed that the New York Knicks are keeping an eye on him. The Knicks have one roster place left. A veteran contract could allow Seth Curry to play minutes behind Mikal Bridges while adding more shooting depth.The Golden State Warriors are also linked to Seth Curry. They have been quiet in free agency because of the contract situation of Jonathan Kuminga.But Seth Curry could be a natural fit if the Warriors decide to strengthen their bench. His shooting style matches the Warriors’ system, which has always valued spacing and quick scoring.Stephen Curry, Draymond Green, and Jimmy Butler remain the Warriors’ core players. All are moving into the later stage of their careers. The team needs steady role players. Seth Curry, with 11 seasons behind him, can bring both experience and reliability. His style does not demand the spotlight, which is what the Warriors often look for in supporting players.While another Curry family member has already made a difficult decision, Seth Curry is still waiting for his NBA future. Damion Lee, Stephen Curry's brother-in-law, signed with Hapoel Tel Aviv in the Israeli Basketball Premier League in July 2024. Although in a battle to play for the Phoenix Suns, he had been with the team.Discussing the move in Israel, Damion Lee remarked that it was not a simple step. “This was among the most difficult decisions I had ever made, yet I wanted to continue playing. Still, I believe I have much left to offer on the court,"" he said.His move has shifted the spotlight even more onto Seth Curry. Unlike Lee, Seth Curry is still being considered by NBA teams. Reports from ESPN in August 2024 noted that his shooting ability continues to make him valuable for franchises like the Warriors.Stephen Curry has already demonstrated that having family on the roster does not impact team chemistry. He played alongside Damion Lee during several seasons without issues. Many believe a pairing with Seth Curry would be no different.

The New York Rangers' star, Artemi Panarin, is once again making headlines in the NHL trade rumors, with increasing speculation that his future in New York Rangers might depend on how the team performs in the upcoming playoffs.Even though Panarin is one of the league's most promising forwards, it is speculated that the Rangers might miss a significant NHL playoff run this year. This has sparked doubts about whether management might consider trading their top scorer before he becomes an unrestricted free agent. Meanwhile, let’s take a look at the top three trade decisions for Artemi Panarin, in case the Rangers miss the deep NHL playoff run. The Pittsburgh Penguins are currently in the trade talks surrounding Artemi Panarin as they work on reshaping their roster around their captain, Sidney Crosby. There’s buzz that they might move some veterans like Evgeni Malkin and Erik Karlsson to create some much-needed cap space, which could open the door for a big opportunity to enter a top-tier forward player. For Panarin, the opportunity to play alongside Crosby would be enticing and good for his career too.Another NHL team that may be considered is the Detroit Red Wings, which appears to be one major piece away from leaping into serious playoff contention. The Red Wings boast a promising roster led by captain Dylan Larkin along with rising star Lucas Raymond. Meanwhile, adding Panarin to the mix could transform their top line into one of the league’s most dangerous units.What makes Detroit especially appealing is its financial flexibility. With ample cap space and a front office willing to accelerate the rebuild, the Red Wings could realistically afford Panarin’s hefty contract, and it would help Panarin too for his career.Another team believed to be in the mix is the Boston Bruins . Despite undergoing a difficult phase, the Bruins continue to remain competitive. The credit goes to the brilliance of David Pastrnak, the defensive leadership of Charlie McAvoy, and the steady presence of goaltender Jeremy Swayman.As per reports, Boston has always been recognized for its tough, well-rounded style of play, but bringing in Panarin would add a top-tier playmaker who can spark immediate offense, and with Panarin’s effort on the team, they might be back into the championship race.","Artemi Panarin is once again making headlines in the NHL trade rumors.

'Never Dreamt of This...': Rohit Sharma's BIG CONFESSION After Retirement From Test Cricket

What is the Bronco Test?

Former India cricketer Manoj Tiwary has made a striking claim about the introduction of the Bronco Test in Indian cricket, suggesting it could be aimed at keeping Rohit Sharma out of the team. The new fitness benchmark, implemented under India’s strength and conditioning coach Adrian Le Roux, adds to the existing Yo-Yo and 2-kilometre time trial tests that players must meet.Speaking to Crictracker, Tiwary raised questions about the timing and purpose of the test, particularly as India prepares for a transitional phase ahead of the 2027 World Cup. ""I think it will be very difficult to keep Virat Kohli out of the plans for the 2027 World Cup, but I have doubts about Rohit Sharma. I believe the Bronco Test has been introduced for players like him. It seems designed to make it difficult for some senior players to stay in the team,"" Tiwary said.Tiwary also highlighted that Rohit could struggle to re-enter the ODI setup if his fitness standards are not up to the mark. He questioned why the test was introduced at this particular time rather than at the start of the new head coach’s tenure. ""Why now? Who decided to bring in the Bronco Test? It is hard to say, but the observation is that players like Rohit will find it challenging if they do not work hard on their fitness,"" he added.Drawing parallels with past phases in Indian cricket, Tiwary said similar fitness benchmarks have previously sidelined senior players. ""When legends like Gambhir, Sehwag, and Yuvraj were performing well, the Yo-Yo Test was introduced after the 2011 World Cup. Fitness standards have often been used to shape team selection,"" he explained.The Bronco Test is an endurance-focused fitness challenge commonly used in sports like rugby. Unlike the Yo-Yo Test, which allows short recovery breaks, the Bronco Test requires players to complete continuous shuttle runs of 20 metres, 40 metres, and 60 metres, repeated five times without a pause, covering a total of 1,200 metres. Top-level Indian cricketers are expected to complete it in around six minutes.For context, the Yo-Yo Test is a 20-metre shuttle run with increasing speed and ten-second recovery intervals, with a minimum pass mark of 17.1. The 2-kilometre time trial requires fast bowlers to finish in 8 minutes 15 seconds and batters, spinners, and wicketkeepers in 8 minutes 30 seconds.The decision to implement the Bronco Test reportedly followed concerns over endurance levels during India’s recent five-Test tour of England. Among the fast bowlers, only Mohammed Siraj managed to play all five matches, highlighting potential gaps in fitness.",Former India cricketer Manoj Tiwary questions the purpose of the Bronco Test.

Simone Biles reflects on mental strength required to compete alone at the highest level

Coco Gauff struggles with seven double faults but shows resilience against Donna Vekic

Coco Gauff's second-round match at the U.S. Open kept fans on the edge of their seats. With her serving troubles and nail-biting rallies, it appeared the American star could break under pressure. However, an unexpected presence in the audience changed the game. A powerful message from a seven-time Olympic champion triggered a shift, hinting at a comeback that would have everyone talking.With all the drama happening on the court, one celebrity guest shone brighter than the rest: Simone Biles, the most decorated gymnast of all time with seven Olympic gold medals. Fresh off a vacation in Australia, Biles made a beeline for the US Open just to see Gauff play. During a mid-match chat with ESPN—while the game took a break—Biles told the host why she was there. She responded instantly, ""Obviously Coco, I mean she’s incredible, amazing, and it’s like once in a lifetime opportunity, so it’s just such a privilege to watch her on home soil. ""The discussion rapidly moved to Gauff's recent struggles, such as her coaching change and her attempts to improve her serve during the tournament. The ESPN host threw out a sharp question: ""She’s had to show a lot of mental strength over the last week. She made a coaching change. She’s actively trying to change her serve in the biggest tournament of the calendar year. For someone like you who has competed in individual competition at the highest level for so many years, what kind of mental strength does that take when you have to rely on yourself and no one else on the court or floor?""Biles, drawing from her own experiences with mental health struggles during the 2020 Tokyo Olympics (delayed to 2021), responded thoughtfully: ""No, definitely.As she gets older and matures, and now she’s an adult, she gets to make these types of decisions that are best for her career. So I’m supportive 100% because I know what that’s like. To see her take ownership of her career, of the court, and all of that is just amazing to watch. "" She also praised Gauff's character, adding, ""Her grace and humility. She is amazing on and off the court, and I think that says a lot about who she is as a person, so it’s so exciting to watch that in person.""The second-round showdown at Arthur Ashe Stadium was quite the thrill from the get-go. Gauff and Vekic were going back and forth in a closely fought first set, with neither player able to take a significant lead. Gauff struggled with her serve, tallying up seven double faults in that set alone, which added up to eight for the match as per the match reports. The drama peaked at 4-4 when Vekic managed to break Gauff's serve, putting the American on the edge of losing the set.At that moment, Gauff's feelings just spilled over. Sitting on the sidelines during the break, she hid her face in a towel and cried openly, her frustration clear to the full crowd and fans watching around the globe.Famous tennis reporter José Morgado shared the powerful moment on X, posting, ""Gauff crying as she drops serve at 4-4..."" MacMillan, her new coach, looked on with a mix of concern and disappointment, but Gauff later described the breakdown as a turning point. In her on-court interview after the match, she told ESPN's Mary Joe Fernandez, ""That first set was tough for me. But you guys stayed cheering for me. So, I really- Thank you, guys. ""Rather than throwing her off course, the moment appeared to relieve all the built-up pressure. Gauff took a short bathroom break to splash water on her face and reset her mind. She came back with a renewed focus, breaking back to force a tiebreaker.In the tiebreak, she narrowly defeated Vekic 7-5, securing the set after a challenging 1 hour and 10 minutes. The second set was a different tale—Gauff was in charge, making just one double fault, holding serve the whole time, and breaking Vekic twice to win 6-2. The final score: 7-6 (5), 6-2, sending Gauff to the third round.Also Read: Hulk Hogan, Malcolm-Jamal, Ozzy Osbourne, and other beloved celebrities we lost this week With this hard-fought win, Gauff advanced to the third round to face Poland's Magdalena Fręch on August 30, 2025.

The gymnast's heartfelt message about mental strength and ownership not only sparked Gauff's immediate comeback but also highlighted the power of solidarity among female athletes facing similar pressures.","Coco Gauff struggled with her serve in her second-round match at the U.S. Open.

TNA Wrestling has released never-before-seen footage of Hulk Hogan ’s last in-ring performance, giving fans a rare chance to watch history unfold. The full match, which originally took place during a live event in 2012, features Hogan teaming with Sting and James Storm against Bully Ray, Kurt Angle, and Bobby Roode. The video now serves as the final glimpse of the legendary wrestler in action, just weeks after his passing at age 71.Hulk Hogan’s last professional wrestling match happened on January 26, 2012, during TNA’s live tour of the United Kingdom. He joined forces with Sting and James Storm to take on Bully Ray, Kurt Angle, and Bobby Roode in a six-man tag match that had the crowd roaring throughout. TNA Wrestling promoted the newly released footage as “an epic IMPACT Wrestling Tour showdown that’s never been televised before.”The contest had everything fans expected from a lineup stacked with wrestling icons— near falls, heated brawls, and the type of star power that only Hogan and Sting could deliver together. While Hogan had officially retired later that year, this UK match is now confirmed as his last professional performance inside the ring.Hogan’s final televised match, however, came earlier at Bound For Glory 2011 against longtime rival Sting in Philadelphia.That battle, billed as a fight for control of the company, ended with Sting defeating Hogan in dramatic fashion. After the match, Hogan turned babyface.Hogan first joined TNA in 2009 alongside Eric Bischoff, where he quickly became a central figure in storylines. He played a key role in the infamous “Immortal” faction, which turned him heel for the first time since his WCW days. His run in TNA may not have reached the mainstream visibility of his WWE and WCW eras, but moments like the 2011 showdown with Sting and this newly surfaced 2012 six-man tag added depth to his legacy.Outside of TNA, Hogan’s wrestling career is filled with milestones that defined generations of fans. He headlined WrestleMania eight times, won the WWE Championship six times, and was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame twice— once individually in 2005 and again in 2020 as part of the nWo. His charisma and larger-than-life persona turned wrestling into a pop culture phenomenon during the height of Hulkamania in the 1980s.Hogan passed away on July 24, 2024, from cardiac arrest at his Florida home.Also Read: ""Wanted to be the first guy to do both"": Roman Reigns promises to continue in WWE along with Hollywood","TNA Wrestling has released never-before-seen footage of Hulk Hogan’s last in- ring performance.

Hat-trick of national titles for Anahat

: The motley crowd inside the squash hall of the Major Dhyan Chand National Stadium on Thursday was firmly rooting for top seed Abhay Singh to add another national title to his kitty.

He (Abhay) has had a good year as well. So today was more of a mental battle. I just had to stay in the rallies and keep pushing. That was the difference,” Velavan told TOI after the match. “I was just focusing on every point. I didn't focus on the outcome or anything peripheral. All I tried to focus on was what I could control and just give everything for the point I was playing,"" he added.Velavan is renowned for his aggressive, attacking style, marked by agility and precision. On the court, he combines quick footwork with powerful, well-placed shots. His left-handed play offers a distinct edge, allowing him to exploit unusual angles which keep opponents guessing.

From football playbooks to NASCAR checkered flags, Gibbs reinvented winning

The rare sponsorship story that shows Gibbs’ culture of loyalty

Why Denny Hamlin’s two decades with Gibbs define racing loyalty

A legacy that goes beyond trophies and lives in lasting loyalty

Youth For Tomorrow

Joe Gibbs has been called a mastermind, a strategist, even a genius. But the truest measure of his legacy is not just the Super Bowls or the NASCAR titles. It is the loyalty he inspired — from quarterbacks and pit crews to billion-dollar sponsors — that made him the rare architect of dynasties across two very different worlds.When Gibbs took over Washington’s NFL team in 1981, few expected greatness. His debut season opened with five painful defeats. Yet, instead of folding, he rallied his men, rewrote the playbook, and built a team that refused to quit. In just two years, he was hoisting the Lombardi Trophy.What set him apart was not only strategy but connection. Over 16 seasons, he won three Super Bowls — each with a different quarterback. “Coach Gibbs made you believe you could be the one,” former players often recall. That belief turned ordinary men into champions and a city into believers.In 1992, Gibbs walked away from the NFL spotlight to chase an untested dream: NASCAR ownership. He had never driven competitively, never run a team. But he knew how to build trust. With Interstate Batteries backing him, Joe Gibbs Racing was born.Just a year later, Dale Jarrett gave the team its first Daytona 500 win.More victories followed, but what endured was the culture Gibbs planted. He didn’t run garages like factories — he ran them like families. “You felt like you were building something that mattered,” one crew member reflected. That sense of belonging became JGR’s fuel.Modern sports sponsorships are notoriously fleeting. Yet, Gibbs forged one of the longest partnerships in NASCAR history. Interstate Batteries, his very first backer, is still with JGR more than 30 years later.“Joe Gibbs Racing gave Interstate Batteries national recognition,” company leaders often say, but the truth runs deeper: Gibbs gave them trust. In an era of quick exits and shifting allegiances, his ability to nurture loyalty turned business deals into lifelong bonds.The loyalty story finds its purest expression in Denny Hamlin. Signed by Gibbs as a young driver, Hamlin has now spent 20 years under the same banner — an eternity in modern racing. This July, he extended that bond with a new multi-year contract.“It is just really special when you think about everything we’ve experienced over the past 20 years,” Gibbs said when the deal was announced. In Hamlin’s 58 Cup wins and three Daytona 500 triumphs lies a simple truth: loyalty, not just speed, wins championships.Gibbs is the only man enshrined in both the Pro Football Hall of Fame and the NASCAR Hall of Fame. But beyond the plaques, what makes him timeless is the culture he built. Whether on the gridiron or at the track, he created families — not factories, believers — not just employees.And that is the secret: trophies tarnish, records fall, but loyalty lasts. Joe Gibbs didn’t just master two sports. He mastered the art of keeping people together.Also read: Māori All Black Shane Christie passes away at 39, rocking rugby and reigniting the concussion crisis debate Beyond sports, Joe Gibbs also foundedin 1986, a nonprofit home for at-risk children in Virginia, showing his commitment to building futures off the field and track.","Gibbs is the only man enshrined in both the Pro Football Hall of Fame and the NASCAR Hall of fame.
