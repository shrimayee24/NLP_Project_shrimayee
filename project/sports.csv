This gesture further strengthened the bond between the two nations.The two countries’ cricketing rivalry was recently showcased in the ICC Champions Trophy Final in Dubai, where India defeated New Zealand.

INTRODUCTION OF THE ‘SECOND BALL’ RULE

IMPACT PLAYER RULE TO STAY

DRS FOR HEIGHT AND OFF-SIDE WIDES

NEW DELHI: Over the years, the Indian Premier League (IPL) has introduced several innovative rules, such as strategic timeouts and the Impact Player rule, to enhance the excitement of the tournament. With IPL 2025 set to begin, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has introduced a few more changes while retaining some existing rules.Bowlers will once again be allowed to use saliva on the ball in IPL 2025.This decision was made after discussions with captains from all 10 teams, with the majority supporting the move.The saliva ban was originally imposed as a health and safety measure during the COVID-19 pandemic, but with the restrictions now lifted, bowlers can resume the practice.A significant new rule—the ‘Second Ball’ rule—will be implemented in IPL 2025 to counter the effects of dew in night matches.Dew often hampers bowlers' ability to grip the ball, providing batters with an undue advantage, particularly during run chases.To address this, umpires will assess the condition of the ball after the 11th over of the second innings.If excessive dew is detected, the bowling team will be allowed to use a new ball. This rule, however, will not apply to afternoon matches.The Impact Player rule, introduced in previous editions, will continue in IPL 2025.This rule allows teams to substitute one player during a match, providing more opportunities for uncapped players who might not otherwise get a chance to play.The Decision Review System (DRS) will now include referrals for height-based no-balls and wides outside the off-stump. With the use of Hawk-Eye technology and ball tracking, umpires will have additional support in making accurate decisions.","IPL 2025 has been announced by the Board of Control for Cricket in India.

Meredith Gaudreau on the beauty of ordinary moments

Meredith Gaudreau shares special Johnny Hockey stories with Julie & Cat | Episode 9

Johnny Gaudreau was known for many things—his incredible skill on the ice, his warm personality, and his deep devotion as a husband and father. Even now, seven months after his passing, his passion and spirit remain alive in the hearts of those who loved him, especially his wife, Meredith Gaudreau . A glimpse at their social media pages shows just how much energy and joy he brought into every moment.Johnny and Meredith Gaudreau were together for years, sharing countless milestones—getting engaged, getting married, welcoming their two children—all alongside the excitement of his hockey career. But in a recent appearance on the Never Offside with Julie & Cat podcast, Meredith reflected not just on those big moments but also on the simple, everyday memories that made their time together so special.“I mean, this is like so weird. I love watching Deal or No Deal. I love it; it’s like my favorite show in the world. I don’t know why.I think I mean I don’t want to like end on a dark note, but I was like I was having a hard time watching like all the new stuff without John ’cause like that was our thing, and then but we watched Deal or No Deal all the time. I don’t know why, like, we have like this weird streaming television, and there’s, like, a Deal or No Deal channel, and I just watch it, and I’m, like, mesmerized by it. Like, I can’t get enough of it. It is so weird, but I have to be honest; that’s what I’m watching.”Johnny Gaudreau had no way of knowing just how much his decision to move would mean for his wife and children. He made the choice on his own, wanting to relocate the family closer to other players’ families so that his wife, Meredith, would have a strong support system during the long stretches when he was away for NHL games.Talking about this decision, Meredith said, “We’re like this weird team that we all live in one neighborhood like it’s just boom boom boom, like teammate after teammate, and I’m so thankful for that now, obviously, but we have such a good group.”Also Read: ""The compete was not there”: Former NHL coach blasts New York Rangers’ playoff chances, calls out team for horrific performance Meredith Gaudreau shared how Boone Jenner has become ""Uncle Boone"" to her kids, even dressing as Donald Duck for baby Johnny’s first birthday.

Travis Kelce Opens Up About Childhood Struggles with Weight on ‘New Heights’



Record-Breaking Signings, March Madness Mayhem & A Severance Waffle Party with Ben Stiller | Ep 130

Kansas City Chiefs’ star Travis Kelce recently shared a candid revelation about his childhood struggles with weight during the latest episode of New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce. The episode, released on Wednesday, March 19, featured actor Ben Stiller as a guest, leading to an unexpected yet insightful conversation about body image and growing up.During the episode, Stiller brought up his 1995 comedy Heavyweights, which tells the story of overweight children who are lured into a fitness camp run by a “psycho ex-fitness instructor.” The film’s theme struck a personal chord with Travis, who admitted that he could relate to the kids in the movie.“I was a heavyweight growing up,” Travis admitted to Stiller. He then added a humorous twist, saying, ""Jason, he didn't get fat until he went to office. We switched places growing up. So Jason is more newly founded into it."" His older brother Jason, 37, quickly clarified, ""He was chubby, I wouldn't say he was fat.""Travis, 35, then opened up about the root of his childhood weight issues. “I think I was dealing with my love for honey buns,” he said with a laugh. His lighthearted yet honest comment gave insight into how food, particularly sugary snacks, contributed to his weight struggles as a kid.The conversation took a nostalgic turn when Travis reflected on how Heavyweights resonated with him as a child. “I saw Heavyweights and was like, ‘Oh, man. If there's a camp out there like that, I wanna go to it.’” He added, “Just kids that can be fat together and hide candy in their beds.” His candid admission highlighted how the movie’s plot mirrored his own experience growing up.Travis also hinted at the deeper emotional aspect of his childhood, suggesting that the movie’s theme of not living up to expectations as the younger sibling felt very familiar. ""Kids that never really lived up to the excellence of their brother and just the expectations that their parents set for themselves,"" he remarked.The New Heights podcast has been gaining attention for its mix of humor and revealing conversations. Just last week, Jason Sudeikis appeared on the show and dropped some interesting news about Ted Lasso, adding to the show’s growing appeal. With Ben Stiller’s appearance, the podcast once again struck a balance between comedy and authenticity, allowing Travis to share a vulnerable side that fans rarely see.Travis’s revelation about his childhood weight struggles adds another layer to his public image. Known for his athleticism and larger-than-life persona on the field, hearing him speak openly about personal insecurities makes him more relatable. Despite his success as a three-time Super Bowl champion and his high-profile relationship with Taylor Swift, it’s refreshing to see that Kelce isn’t afraid to show his human side.Also Read: Jason Kelce sparks debate by saying NBA players are superior athletes to NFL stars on New Heights This lighthearted yet honest chat shows that even the most successful people have their share of childhood struggles — and for Travis, it seems like honey buns and hidden candy were part of the journey.","Travis Kelce opened up about his childhood struggles with weight on the latest episode of New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce.

Why the Lakers Could Land Kennard

Luka Doncic of the Los Angeles Lakers (Image via Getty)

Financial Flexibility: Kennard’s relatively low salary demands make him an affordable target for the Lakers Proven Track Record: His consistent shooting numbers demonstrate his ability to contribute immediately Fit with Superstars: Kennard’s skill set complements the playstyles of Doncic and James, making him a valuable addition.

“We’ll see if the magical negotiating tactics that allowed Pelinka to pry Luka away from the Mavs can get to work snagging Kennard away from what will be multiple suitors.”

Theare reportedly setting their sights on adding sharpshooters this offseason, and one name that has emerged as a potential target is. This player could be a key addition to the Lakers’ roster as they aim to build a competitive team around their superstar duo of Luka Doncic and LeBron James Luke Kennard, a six-foot-five shooting guard of the Memphis Grizzlies , has built a reputation as one of the league’s most reliable three-point shooters. This season, he’s shooting an impressive 44.6% from beyond the arc, maintaining a career average of 43.9%. His ability to stretch the floor and knock down shots consistently makes him an ideal fit for the Los Angeles Lakers, who are prioritizing floor spacers to complement their star players.Luke Kennard’s affordability is another factor that makes him an attractive option for the Lakers. Currently earning $9.3 million in the final year of his contract, Kennard has never made more than $15 million annually. This financial flexibility is crucial for the Los Angeles Lakers, who are managing significant salary commitments to Doncic and James.As Colin Keane of the Sporting News notes:Luke Kennard’s NBA journey began when he was drafted by the Detroit Pistons in 2017. After spending two and a half seasons in Detroit, he was traded to the LA Clippers, where he continued to showcase his shooting prowess. In 2022, he was traded to the Memphis Grizzlies, where he has become a key contributor.Now, as an upcoming unrestricted free agent, Kennard is expected to draw interest from multiple teams, including the Los Angeles Lakers. The Grizzlies will likely attempt to retain him, but the Lakers’ front office, led by GM Rob Pelinka, is known for its strategic negotiating tactics.The Los Angeles Lakers ’ offseason strategy revolves around adding cost-effective shooters who can thrive alongside their star players. Kennard’s skill set aligns perfectly with this vision. His ability to knock down threes at a high clip would provide much-needed spacing for Doncic and James, allowing them to operate more effectively on the court.The Lakers' desire to assemble a team with a variety of players is further demonstrated by their interest in Kennard. Dalton Knecht, a rookie shooter, was traded away earlier this season, but Pelinka was able to reverse the transaction and keep him. Knecht's future with the squad is still up in the air, though, which highlights the necessity for dependable shooters like Kennard.While Luke Kennard’s fit with the Lakers is undeniable, the team will face competition from other suitors. The Grizzlies are expected to make a strong push to retain him, and other teams in need of shooting could also enter the fray.However, Pelinka’s track record of successful negotiations, including the acquisition of Luka Doncic , gives the Lakers a fighting chance. As Keane points out:The Los Angeles Lakers’ pursuit of Luke Kennard shows their commitment to building a roster capable of competing at the highest level. His shooting, affordability, and fit with the team’s stars make him a prime target for the upcoming offseason. While challenges remain, the Los Angeles Lakers’ front office has proven its ability to pull off significant moves in the past.Also read: How the Los Angeles Lakers Transformed Into a True Title Contender Ahead of the Playoffs As the offseason approaches, all eyes will be on Rob Pelinka and the Lakers to see if they can successfully lure Kennard away from Memphis and bolster their roster for a championship run.","Luke Kennard is a six-foot-five shooting guard of the Memphis Grizzlies.

After going unsold at the mega auction, all-rounder Shardul Thakur is all set to sign an Indian Premier League IPL ) contract with Lucknow Super Giants (LSG). Thakur has been with the side since their preparations for the 2025 season got underway and will be replacing injured Mohsin Khan in the Rishabh Pant-led squad.The official announcement is yet to be made but it's learnt that Thakur has been informed about the decision and will be travelling with the side to Visakhapatnam for their season opener vs Delhi Capitals.Mohsin picked up an ACL injury which has impaired him from featuring in any cricket for the last three months, and then had a calf strain when he resumed bowling in the LSG nets. With their core group of seamers still recovering at the Board of Control for Cricket in India's (BCCI) Centre of Excellence (CoE), the management was forced to take the call on an injury replacement.The India-heavy pace attack features Akash Deep, Avesh Khan and Mayank Yadav but all are yet to join the IPL franchise. While Akash Deep and Mayank are at the CoE, Avesh still hasn't linked up with the squad after recovering from the knee injury. As far as pace sensation Mayank is concerned, he has started bowling at reduced intensity in the nets but is far from attaining match fitness.From side strain to hamstring to issue in the left side of the back and now the right side, the youngster's body has gone through a lot and he is yet to play a competitive fixture since October last year. Even if the 22-year-old gets an all-clear from the CoE to join his IPL side, it will be nothing short of a miracle if he lasts the distance.The LSG camp is yet to give details of their seamers' injuries and mentor Zaheer Khan insisted that they will follow a dynamic approach this season.""The situation is dynamic for some of our players due to injuries. But it’s time that we look for positives and adopt things to tackle the situation amicably. Some players are at the National Cricket Academy and others are spending time with their physios. Right now, it will not be right to say anything about this. The situation will be dynamic this season,” Zaheer said in a media interaction.In absence of their core seamers, Shardul will now be leading the pack as he is the most experienced bowler in the set-up. Shamar Joseph is the only overseas seamer in the LSG squad which also features youngsters like Rajvardhan Hangargekar and Prince Yadav. While the spin department wears a settled look, the same can't be said about the quicks.","Shardul Thakur is set to sign an IPL contract with Lucknow Super Giants.

NEW DELHI: Lucknow Super Giants ' (LSG) team mentor Zaheer Khan has set the tone for his team's upcoming Indian Premier League (IPL) season, promising an aggressive and fearless brand of cricket under the leadership of new captain Rishabh Pant Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, the former Indian seamer emphasised the team's intent to take the game head-on, reflecting the leadership style of their newly appointed skipper.""You will see a fearless approach from this team,"" Zaheer stated, highlighting the mindset LSG aims to bring to the tournament.Addressing concerns over injuries, Zaheer dismissed any negativity, pointing to Pant's resilience as a key factor in shaping the team's attitude.""We are not talking about injuries. The captain himself has faced similar challenges, but he has a very positive outlook. The way he approaches the game, the way he puts pressure on the bowlers--you will see LSG play in that manner because the leader sets the tone,"" he said.Pant has been entrusted with leading the franchise this season. Zaheer expressed confidence in his ability to guide the team forward.""We have a very good captain who has been appointed this year to take the team forward. There is a lot of hope from him,"" he noted.Pant's IPL journey with LSG could not be more poetic as he would start off his campaign as LSG's skipper against his former side Delhi Capitals at Visakhapatnam on March 24.Pant has represented Delhi Capitals (DC) for his entire IPL career since 2016, scoring 3,284 runs in 110 matches at an average of 35.31, with a century and 18 fifties. He was appointed as the team's captain in 2021 and led them to playoffs in the same season. He was let go by the franchise in 2024 ahead of the mega auction and became the league's most expensive player ever at Rs 27 crore, bought by LSG, who later appointed him as captain in January.While there are speculations over his batting position, one thing is for sure: Pant fans are in for a thrilling ride!Pant was also a part of India's ICC Champions Trophy-winning team recently; however, he did not get to play a match.

On CSK’s batting order...

CHENNAI: When it comes to choosing an all-time IPL XI, it is impossible to keep Suresh Raina out of it. The left-hander was an integral part of four title wins for Chennai Super Kings and made the No. 3 spot in the franchise his own for more than a decade.During an interaction facilitated by IPL’s official broadcaster JioStar, Raina spoke about CSK’s chances, what makes Shreyas Iyer a great T20 captain, Rishabh Pant’s tough challenge at Lucknow Super Giants and a lot more.Iyer can change their fortunes with the help of Ponting and a lot of great batters around him. Iyer’s batting has been phenomenal. He has the captaincy skills; he has won the IPL. I will be keen to see the way he can change Punjab’s fortunes. I have seen Ponting; he is strong with his planning and he is intense.If you look at his captaincy, he is cheerful and innovative. He has calmness and he is an astute leader. I want him to bat at No. 3 but if I look at their squad, I think he will bat at No. 4. Probably, he can play the role of a finisher for LSG. His IPL season could change his T20 fortunes.Some of their bowlers like Mayank Yadav, Mohsin Khan and Avesh Khan are injured. The attack does not have experience. It is important to have a quality fast bowler to qualify for the playoffs. Pant is going into the IPL without a quality fast bowler and has a lot of homework to do. But Zaheer Khan (mentor) has heaps of experience and will gel well with Pant.Everyone talks about his fitness and wicketkeeping, but not many talk about how much power he generates from his backlift. He goes to Chennai one month before the start of the tournament. He bats for three to four hours every day and does match simulation.The spin department is very good. Ravichandran Ashwin is a local boy. He would want to finish well at CSK. He can bowl in different situations. Ravindra Jadeja is good in all three departments and then there is Noor Ahmad. While Jadeja can contain runs and create pressure at one end, Noor will bring quality and provide the breakthroughs. Foreign batters will have a challenge playing in Chennai, so the Indian batters will have to do most of the work.Rachin Ravindra has been in very good form. Having him with Ruturaj Gaikwad, it becomes easier when they play in Chennai. We will have to see who they are going to play in the middle order – Rahul Tripathi, Deepak Hooda or Vijay Shankar. The batters have to spend time on the Chennai pitches, especially in the 7-to-11-over period.",Suresh Raina says Punjab Kings captain Shreyas Iyer is a great T20 captain.

Alex Ovechkin breaks yet another NHL record with historic 35-goal season

Washington Capitals captain Alex Ovechkin maintains his position as a legendary goal-scorer throughout the history of the NHL. During Thursday night's 3-2 win against Philadelphia Ovechkin accomplished two remarkable achievements that reflected his greatness in the league.Alex Ovechkin broke the league record by scoring his first goal of the game against the Flyers thus achieving 35 goals in his 15th NHL season. ESPN 's SportsCenter used social media to showcase Ovechkin's outstanding accomplishment for breaking the NHL's record of scoring 35 goals during 15 seasons.Between his 39 years of age the sniper has extended his streak past multiple elite hockey scorers who have brought unmatched sustained excellence to the sport. Ovechkin's exceptional year-to-year performance established him as one of hockey's most intimidating offensive talents of all time.Ovechkin's continual efforts to break Wayne Gretzky's 894-goal record stands as the biggest story within NHL hockey today. Every game now brings Ovechkin closer to equaling the all-time record after he scored his latest goal that left him seven goals shy of the milestone.The Russian captain Ovechkin has gone on an impressive goal-scoring run in March where he achieved five goals and 10 points across his last 10 matches combined with a current three-game scoring streak. Ovechkin demonstrates exceptional goal-scoring prowess against the Flyers because he has netted 52 times in 78 games against them which ranks second among his targets after his 56-goal record against the Winnipeg Jets/Atlanta Thrashers.In his thirteen-year NHL All-Star career Ovechkin has won the Hart Memorial Trophy three times and established an era of spectacular goal-scoring excellence upon his league entry in 2005. Throughout his career Ovechkin has established a unique goal-scoring ability which he presented in each of his nine seasons with fifty or more goals.Also Read: “The greatest criminal”: Dominik Hasek slams Donald Trump for using Hockey to whitewash serious global crimes by Russia The hockey community counts down to each next goal of Ovechkin while he creates a historical legacy that people will remember through many generations.",Alex Ovechkin broke the league record by scoring his first goal of the game against the Flyers thus achieving 35 goals in his 15th NHL season.

ANDRE RUSSELL:

The IPL has been the grand stage for some of the greatest modern-day cricketers to showcase their prowess. However, all good things must come to an end. Could this be the final IPL season for some of those legends who dazzled us over the years? TOI gazes into the crystal ball.He has led the Mumbai Indians to five IPL titles. However, Rohit Sharma, the IPL batsman, has been somewhat underwhelming in recent years. In IPL-2024, free from the pressures of MI captaincy, the 37-year-old showed glimpses of his vintage best with 417 runs in 14 matches at an average of 32.07 and a strike rate of 150.00. Having already bid farewell to T20 internationals after lifting the T20 World Cup, will Rohit look to exit the IPL in similar fashion?‘King’ Kohli had a phenomenal IPL last season, amassing 741 runs in 15 matches at an average of 61.75, including one century and five fifties. His sharp fielding further added to his impact, but RCB once again fell short of clinching the title. The one thing missing from his glittering resume is an IPL trophy. Kohli announced his T20I retirement last year, but playing under Rajat Patidar’s captaincy, he would be eager to light up the IPL — perhaps for one last time.For the past few seasons, speculation about MS Dhoni’s IPL future has been a recurring theme. Yet, despite the intrigue, the legendary former India captain has shown no signs of walking away from Chennai Super Kings as a player. After a nagging knee issue that required surgery after IPL 2023, Dhoni has tweaked his role, coming into bat in the final overs and making a significant impact. Last season, he smashed 161 runs in 14 matches at an average of 53.66, boasting a staggering strike rate of 220.54. At 43, will ‘Thala’ finally bid farewell to the IPL? Recognizing his immense value to the league and CSK, the BCCI adjusted retention rules, allowing him to stay an ‘uncapped’ player. What could prove the perfect farewell for one of cricket’s greatest finishers? A title-winning six for CSK, nothing less.He may have last played a Test match in Feb 2021, but the South African continues to shine in the IPL. He delivered strong performances for Royal Challengers Bengaluru as their captain, but now faces a new challenge this season, having joined Delhi Capitals as Axar Patel’s deputy. The 40-year-old had a solid IPL 2024 campaign, scoring 438 runs in 15 matches at an average of 29.20, with four fifties. While his experience will be invaluable for Axar, and his explosive starts at the top will be crucial for DC’s campaign, will the former SA skipper conclude his IPL journey with a maiden title for Delhi Capitals?Initially renowned for his deceptive knuckleball, Sunil Narine has evolved into a dynamic allrounder. Last season, he excelled as an explosive opener, amassing 488 runs in 15 matches at an average of 34.85, including three fifties and a maiden IPL century. His partnership with Phil Salt at the top was key to Kolkata Knight Riders’ title win. With the ball, Narine had one of his best IPL seasons, taking 17 wickets at 6.69. At 36, will the T20 West Indian great aim for title before bidding farewell, marking the end of an era for KKR, and the IPL?Like Narine, Russell shares a deep connection with KKR. Once known as a six-hitting powerhouse, Russell struggled with injuries in recent years. Last season, though, the West Indian allrounder returned to his ways of old, taking 19 wickets at 15.52 while also scoring 222 runs at a blistering 185.00—a vintage 25-ball 64 against Sunrisers Hyderabad which featured seven sixes being the standout performance","Virat Kohli had a phenomenal IPL last season, amassing 741 runs in 15 matches at an average of 61.75.

Isack Hadjar’s F1 Debut Ends in Heartbreak but Earns Support from Lewis Hamilton



Lewis Hamilton’s dad consoling emotional Isack Hadjar after crash #ausgp #australiangp #f1shorts #f1

Isack Hadjar ’s much-anticipated Formula 1 debut at the Australian Grand Prix took an unfortunate turn before it even truly began. The young Frenchman, who had been eagerly awaiting his first competitive outing at the pinnacle of motorsport, found himself out of the race before completing a single lap. Wet conditions at Albert Park proved to be unforgiving as he lost control of his Racing Bulls car on the formation lap, spinning into the barrier at the very first corner.The 20-year-old was visibly devastated, keeping his helmet on as he walked back to the paddock. However, amid the heartbreak, Hadjar found comfort in an unexpected moment with Anthony Hamilton, father of seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton . The veteran racer’s father reminded Hadjar of a similar incident from Lewis’s career.“He said it reminded him of Lewis parking the car at pit entry in Shanghai,” Hadjar shared, reflecting on the encounter. “It was a nice moment, sharing time with someone like Anthony as well—obviously, the dad of my idol.”Hadjar’s emotions were soon lifted further when Lewis Hamilton himself reached out to offer words of encouragement. The Ferrari driver, despite enduring his own struggles during the race, made it a point to support the rookie.“So that was quite a special moment. And indeed, Lewis sent me a message later that day. Really classy guys,” Hadjar revealed.Hamilton, who had spoken to Hadjar before the race, understood exactly what the young driver was going through. Recalling his own difficult moments in F1, Hamilton emphasized the importance of having a support system during such low points.“I’d spoken to him just before on the drivers’ parade, he’s such a nice lad,” Hamilton said. “I just said to him, make sure you enjoyed the race and not to put too much pressure on yourself.“And I said, ‘Take a picture, because it’s my first race with Ferrari and your first race,’ so he took a selfie.“Then obviously [he] had the off on the formation lap, which I knew would be tough. I’ve been there, I know how painful it is. In those moments, you feel like you’re not only disappointed in yourself but you feel all eyes are on you, and everyone is judging you.”Hamilton highlighted that moments like these could be overwhelming for any driver, particularly for a rookie making his debut on one of the biggest stages in motorsport.While the Hamiltons offered support, Red Bull advisor Helmut Marko had a far less sympathetic reaction. Known for his tough approach with Red Bull’s junior drivers, Marko was unimpressed with Hadjar’s emotional reaction after the crash.“Isack Hadjar did a little bit of crying after his crash. That was a bit embarrassing,” Marko stated.Hadjar, however, took the comment in stride, acknowledging his own feelings about the situation.“I found it embarrassing myself. You know Helmut. I had him on the phone a day later. It’s all good. I’ve known him for a few years now,” Hadjar responded.Also Read: How Eddie Jordan, Michael Schumacher’s first boss was banned from visiting him after his tragic skiing accident Despite the disappointment of his debut, Hadjar was overwhelmed by the outpouring of support from fans and fellow drivers.

HYDERABAD: The previous edition of the Indian Premier League ( IPL ) has set new benchmarks in team totals and the new season, beginning Saturday, will breach new marks this season, said G Hanuma Vihari.When Sunrisers Hyderabad posted the highest total of 287 (vs RCB), there was talk of teams breaching the 300-run mark. The former India player said he would not be surprised if SRH achieve the feat because they have an explosive batting line-up.“Sunrisers have strengthened their strong batting order by including Ishan Kishan at No.3. With openers — Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma — giving great starts and Heinrich Klaasen and Nitish Reddy in the line-up, they can reach the 300-run total. On a good batting wicket and with small boundaries, that total is possible,” said Vihari who would be on the commentary panel for JioStar.He also tipped SRH, runners-up last season, to make the title round again this year along with Punjab Kings, who he reckons, have all bases covered.“Sunrisers have set a new benchmark. Credit to the captain, coach and team management for the freedom they have given to the team. I am sure they will continue in the same vein this season as well,” he added.“Punjab look solid. (Shreyas) Iyer is an IPL-winning captain and Ricky Ponting is a great coach. With Glenn Maxwell, Josh Inglis and Marcus Stoinis, their batting looks sound. I feel SRH and Punjab will make it to the final,” he predicted.The 31-year-old also said that Nitish Kumar Reddy will be under the scanner.“He had a great season and made his debut for the country and had a great Australia tour with a century in the Melbourne Test. He also made his debut for India in T20s. So there will be expectations from the franchise and fans as well. He is just 21 and it will be interesting to see how he handles pressure. If he scores runs this season, there will be no stopping him for the next 10 years,” he added.Vihari also said Harshal Patel would be a good replacement for “yorker specialist” T Natarajan and that they also plugged the gap in spin department by roping in Adam Zampa and Rahul Chahar.","Sunrisers Hyderabad posted the highest total of 287 (vs RCB) in last season's IPL. G Hanuma Vihari said he would not be surprised if SRH achieve the feat. He also tipped SRH, runners-up last season, to make the title round again.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119282710,imgsize-71666,width-400,resizemode-4/119282710.jpg"

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Los Angeles Lakers’ strategy for Bronny James: Why a hybrid approach could shape his future



The Lakers are taking things slow with Bronny James , finding a balance between NBA minutes and G League reps to help him develop at the right pace. Some argue he’d improve faster with a full season in the G League, but the Lakers see value in getting him some NBA action—even if it’s in smaller doses. While he’s not making a huge impact at the highest level yet, head coach JJ Redick believes his game is already showing real progress. Bronny James has bounced between the Lakers and their G League affiliate, the South Bay Lakers, playing in 16 developmental league games so far. A full G League season might have sped up his growth, but the Lakers prefer a hybrid approach—giving him meaningful minutes in South Bay while also letting him experience NBA competition firsthand.Lakers head coach JJ Redick has kept a close eye on Bronny’s development and recently shared his thoughts with The Athletic’s Joe Vardon. According to Redick, one aspect of Bronny’s game has seen noticeable improvement:“His biggest area of improvement is probably his playmaking, and I don’t just mean that in terms of passing, but just his ability to play on and off the ball as a decision-maker—either a scorer or a passer.”That progress was on display in a recent game against the Denver Nuggets, where Bronny played a career-high 16 minutes. His stat line—five points, two rebounds, and a steal—didn’t jump off the page, but his decision-making and confidence on the floor stood out.From G League to NBA: How Bronny James is gaining confidence and experienceDespite bouncing between leagues, Bronny sees the value in getting some NBA minutes early on. He recently reflected on his progress and how it’s shaping his mindset.“I definitely think I’ve improved, not only as a player, but just having a different mindset as a player to go out and play my game and play the game that I know how to play,” Bronny said. “I feel really good about it—I see the progress.”While some believe he should have spent the entire season in the G League, the Lakers’ plan is about long-term development. By giving him controlled opportunities on the NBA stage, they’re ensuring he gets valuable experience without being thrown into the deep end too soon.The Lakers are playing the long game with Bronny, focusing on steady progress rather than immediate impact. His improved playmaking and decision-making haven’t gone unnoticed, and while he’s not a difference-maker just yet, the foundation is being laid for future success.Also Read: Gilbert Arenas backs LeBron James' son Bronny James as a top 5 Rookie of the Year contender: “Give Him Minutes, He’ll Shine!” For now, the Lakers are sticking to their dual-track development plan, letting Bronny gain experience in both the NBA and the G League.

Building or curating a team of legends has always been a fantasy for most fans across team sports. When it comes to cricket , the dopamine rush that the sport’s consumers in the subcontinent get is simply irresistible. As India’s great summer carnival, the IPL, turns 18, TOI dons the avatar of super selector and curates an all-star IPL XI . Debate, troll, comment, rage if a player you loved did not make it. But most importantly, engage. Here goes...The 2024 T20 WC-winning India skipper is the opener and vicecaptain. Savage in the powerplay, courtesy of his disgust for stat-padding and romance for impact, the Hitman can blaze away to rapid starts, putting the best bowlers under pressure. Six IPL titles, five of them as skipper, put him in a league of his own. Still the only player to have a hat-trick and a century to his name in the IPL.The brand ambassador of T20 cricket. Fans are probably still picking up cricket balls at Cubbon Park in Bengaluru which the West Indian superstar hit out of the Chinnaswamy in 2013 while scoring his 175 not out vs Pune Warriors. Can complement Rohit’s coolness with quintessential Jamaican swag. Can also bowl fastish off-spinning yorkers that are awkward to hit. The Gayle Gangnam can entertain crowds if there is a dull passage of play.The only player who has played for one team right through the IPL. Kohli is the heart, mind, and soul of the franchise and managed to achieve mind-boggling consistency in a format in which you cannot be consistent. His 973 runs in a season in 2016 is still a record. Deceptively quick across the turf, he is plus 10 in the field every time he wears the red jersey. And No. 18 is the theme for this year.Can anchor, be explosive, bowl, field, and can run the fielders ragged by converting ones into twos. Few left-handers have been so versatile and offered so much utility to a team. One of the engine rooms of CSK’s title triumphs in 2010, 2011, and 2018. His inside-out shot over cover and the mow over mid-wicket and the diving leap to get into the crease deserve to be patented.There is a new synonym in law textbooks in Bengaluru for the word jailbreak: ABDed. The South African great starred in twice as many heists for RCB as the number of vehicles at peak hour on MG Road. Scooping Dale Steyn’s 150 kmph yorker for six in 2012 is the shot of the IPL across all editions. Throw in his gravity-defying catches and his ability to keep wickets, ABD is a lock in at No. 5.The presence of India’s most loved and celebrated captain with the most storied six to win the 2011 World Cup ensures that Chennai Super Kings never have to play an away game. ‘Yellove’ bearing No. 7 is the colour in the stands every time Thala walks in. Thanks to him, 10-ball cameos are in. Five IPL crowns as captain, mentoring bowlers from behind the stumps, and electric and efficient hands make Dhoni the brightest star among the All Star XI.MI’s miracle worker. Since he made his debut in 2010, no foreign player in the franchise received as much love as the Trinidadian. Be it acing impossible chases or plucking one-handed impossible catches, Polly, as he is affectionately called, is the heartbeat of the franchise. When he was let go in 2023, he had offers from other teams but chose to remain with MI as batting coach. Provided amazing theatre too, most notably by bowling with tape on his mouth when it was alleged that he was sledging batters.Bleach, bling, sling. Ma-Ling-AA MaLing-AA! The chants at CCI and Wankhede when this Sri Lankan took the ball made for a surreal experience. Skipper Rohit looked for him every time he needed a wicket or needed to squeeze batters with a tight over.

Did an expert job as Jasprit Bumrah’s mentor.Deception, skill, striking prowess, ability to bowl dry. How can one man be blessed with so many qualities? Jasprit Bumrah and his 24 balls have been used by MI skippers as carefully as a pensioner uses his funds.

When he and Malinga were at their peak and fit, rival teams actually had only 12 overs out of 20 to score.The powerplay banker.

An attacking legspinner, he formed the core of the RCB bowling line-up for seven years and was never afraid to toss the ball even on the smallish field at Chinnaswamy.

KOLKATA: From being almost unsold to assuming the defending champions’ captaincy, Ajinkya Rahane ’s leap has been of more than just faith. Even though Kolkata Knight Riders would have felt they hit a jackpot when Rahane ended up as the best player in the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 (SMAT) tournament, the veteran might have been more relieved than happy.One of the few players who have remained in the IPL since its inception, he almost missed the bus this time. If the IPL auction provided him a lifeline, SMAT gave him a new lease of life. Having accumulated 432 runs at a strike rate of almost 170, the batter who had gathered the red-ball tag like moss on decaying wood, had once again established his T20 credentials.Less than a month prior to that, KKR had pouched Rahane for his base price of Rs 1.5 crore, that too on a second calling. With Shreyas Iyer gone to Punjab Kings, KKR were perhaps hunting for a captain when the unsold Rahane was brought back under the hammer.The 36-year-old Rahane will also be expected to groom Venkatesh Iyer, six years younger and Rs 22.25 crore costlier, for his shoes. So far, Rahane and Iyer have shared the spotlight almost equally.“Have nothing to prove” and “Living in the moment” have been Rahane’s take since he accepted the KKR captaincy, but that cannot take away the hurt he would have endured when Rajasthan Royals removed him from the post middway in 2019. Rahane exuded confidence at a KKR event on Wednesday, when the team was introduced to the fans in a grand manner.“Great to be back, an honour to lead,” the skipper said, typically in a few words. “We have prepared well, and I am happy that everyone (in the team) is on the same page.”Head coach Chandrakant Pandit echoed Rahane’s sentiment. “It was a special moment to win the trophy (last year),” he said.Having been overshadowed by Gautam Gambhir last year, the coach is looking ahead to a new season, with some help from mentor Dwyane Bravo. The West Indian in his inimitable way, endorsed Rahane, saying that KKR is ready for another campaign.“KKR know how to win a championship, now the idea is to defend one,” said Bravo.Rahane has led 25 times in IPL, 23 of them being with the Royals, although his captaincy record in this tournament is not too flattering, having won only nine games. But the big question remains. Is batter Rahane’s place in the playing XI guaranteed? The issue is up in the air, but as long as he lets his bat do the talking, Rahane will be there. If not, Iyer is always there.","Kolkata Knight Riders captain Ajinkya Rahane won Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 tournament. The 36-year-old was almost unsold at the IPL auction.

He believes that this move will aid bowlers in finding reverse swing, even in conditions that are not conducive to it.""It's very good for bowlers. It's excellent news for us bowlers because when the ball is not doing anything, applying saliva on the ball will increase the chances of finding some reverse swing,"" Siraj told PTI.""It sometimes aids reverse swing because scrubbing the ball against the shirt will not help (to get reverse swing). But using saliva on the ball will help in maintaining (the shine on one side), and it is important.""Siraj, who has joined the Gujarat Titans for the upcoming season, is excited to play under the captaincy of Shubman Gill , whom he considers a ""bowler's captain.""""It's a good feeling to join Gujarat ahead of the new season. Yeah, it was a bit emotional for me to leave RCB because Virat bhai had supported me a lot in tough times, but we have a fantastic team here under Gill. If you talk about Gill, then he is a bowler's captain. He never tries to stop you from trying something new or hinder your plans. We have made our Test debut together (vs Australia in 2020) and we share a very good personal rapport too,"" he said.The Gujarat Titans boast a formidable bowling lineup, including Kagiso Rabada , Rashid Khan, Ishant Sharma, and Gerald Coetzee. Siraj views this as a positive factor, as it fosters healthy competition and eases the burden on individual bowlers.""It is actually a great thing because it is such an experienced line-up and will foster some healthy competition, which is good for the team. These bowlers do not require much guidance and they know their plans. So in that sense, it's a blessing to have such bowlers in a competition like IPL because we have all kinds of bowlers, who have ticked all the right areas,"" he noted.Despite missing out on recent international assignments, Siraj remains focused on his performance in the IPL and is not overly concerned about selection for the national team.""Look, selection is not in my hands. I have only a cricket ball in my hands and I wanted to do as much as I can with that. I don't want to put pressure on myself thinking about selection, as I want to focus on my performance. Yeah aș a player, it remains in the back of your mind that there is a tour of England and the Asia Cup but I don't really seriously think about it, as my focus is on IPL and doing well for Gujarat Titans and helping them win another IPL title,"" he remarked.Siraj is looking forward to working with Ashish Nehra , the Gujarat Titans' coach, and learning from his vast experience as a fast bowler.""As a fast bowler, Ashu bhai has done a lot for Indian cricket, he was a genuine match winner for the country.

NEW DELHI: As the countdown to 2025 edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) begins, the buzz is all about fresh rivalries, big hits, and title dreams. But beneath the glitz and glam, the IPL has also served up some heated moments that reminded everyone.Here, TimesofIndia.com takes a look at five unforgettable instances when IPL players let the pressure -- or passion -- get the better of them:The most infamous moment in IPL history came in its very first season. After a match between Mumbai Indians and Kings XI Punjab, Harbhajan Singh allegedly slapped Sreesanth during the post-match handshake.The visuals of a teary-eyed Sreesanth went viral, and Bhajji was handed a season-long suspension. It set the tone, with the incident getting labelled as the infamous ""Slapgate"".Two intense competitors, one heated rivalry. In 2013, a fiery on-field exchange between Kohli and Gambhir during an RCB vs KKR clash nearly came to blows.A decade later in IPL 2023, they clashed again -- this time when Gambhir (mentor of LSG at that time) and Kohli exchanged heated words post-match. Cooler heads had to intervene both times, but the fire between these two continues to smoulder.In a charged face-off between MI and RCB, Starc bowled a bouncer and exchanged words with Pollard. What followed was pure chaos -- Starc ran in aggressively again, and Pollard pulled away last second, only to fling his bat in Starc’s direction in anger.It was a rare moment of Pollard losing composure, and both players were fined heavily.Cool. Calm. Composed. That’s MS Dhoni, right? Well, almost always. But in a 2019 game against Rajasthan Royals, even Dhoni reached boiling point.Unhappy with a no-ball call reversal during CSK's tense chase, he stormed onto the field mid-over to confront the umpires — a rare and shocking outburst from Captain Cool that stunned fans and pundits alike.In one of the most dramatic finishes in IPL history, Mumbai Indians faced Rajasthan Royals in a virtual knockout in 2014, needing to chase down a daunting 190 in just 14.3 overs to qualify for the playoffs. What followed was pure chaos -- MI pulled off the near-impossible thanks to an Aditya Tare six off the final ball that sealed their qualification on net run rate.But beyond the math and madness, it was the sight of the ever-composed Rahul Dravid -- sitting in the RR dugout -- furiously hurling his cap to the ground that captured the emotional toll of the moment. For fans, it was a rare glimpse of The Wall cracking under pressure.These incidents, though controversial, are a reminder that the IPL is more than just big sixes and colourful jerseys. With reputations on the line, national teammates turning into franchise rivals, and every run, wicket, and decision scrutinised -- tempers can and do flare.","The countdown to 2025 edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) begins.

NEW DELHI: India all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy shared how a light-hearted dressing room banter with Virat Kohli led to him receiving a special gift from the former India captain— a pair of shoes that he later wore while scoring his maiden Test century against Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG).“Back in the locker room, he (Kohli) once asked Sarfaraz (Khan), ‘Sarfu, tera size kya hai?’ (Sarfaraz, what’s your shoe size?), and he said, ‘Nine.’ Then he turned to me, and I thought, ‘Oh my god, I have to guess this correctly,’ because even if they weren’t my size, I really wanted his shoes. I said, ‘10,’ and he gave them to me. In the next match, I wore those shoes and scored a hundred!"" Reddy recalled during a podcast on PUMA’s YouTube channel on Thursday.After reaching his first Test hundred in 171 balls at the MCG, Nitish revealed that his eyes were searching for his father, Mutyalu, who was in the stands alongside his mother, sister, and uncle, among the 80,000-odd spectators.“Everyone in the dressing room came up and congratulated me, but I was just looking for one guy—hoping he’d come and talk to me.“When Virat bhai (Kohli) finally walked up and told me I had played a wonderful game, that moment itself was special for me. I was also scanning the stands for my father but couldn’t find him. Later, I saw on the screen that he was crying.”Nitish also shared a fun moment from the Test series in Australia when his Sunrisers Hyderabad teammate Travis Head tried to distract him with some playful sledging.“Travis came up to me and said, ‘Nitish, where are you going to party tonight?’—knowing fully well that I wouldn’t.“Then he went on, ‘Australia is such a great place. Melbourne is an amazing city, you have to go out and chill.’ He was just trying to distract me. I just told him, ‘Okay, Travis, one day we’ll both go and party!’ During another match, he was fielding at short leg and warned me, ‘Nitish, if you hit me, I’ll hit you when you bowl!’” he said.Nitish will next play for Sunrisers Hyderabad in IPL 2025 and spoke about how difficult it was to turn down other franchises in order to stay with a team he considers home.“To be honest, I got some offers. But SRH is one team which I can really connect with. Like, it’s a home team for me. It feels like you’re representing your home team and want to make a wonderful impact in that team.“I just want to perform well and bring that cup back to SRH, and they have shown absolute faith in me. I felt that it’s my time when I have to show faith and regive trust in me to them. Some conversations were going on to get me in the auction from other franchises. My answer was that I always wanted to play for SRH, but it was not an easy no to say to everyone.“When I play for the team, whenever someone comes to talk to me in Telugu, they take me as kind of their own brother. Like, someone known to them is playing for their home team. Obviously, Orange Army, that thing is huge and they support really well. The number of people who come and support us in the stadium, it's massive. When those orange flags came in the Orange stadium, we really love that energy,” he concluded.",India all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy shared how a light-hearted dressing room banter with Virat Kohli led to him receiving a special gift from the former India captain.

NEW DELHI: As we gear up for another exhilarating edition of the Indian Premier League IPL ), it's the perfect time to take a nostalgic walk down memory lane.The IPL, a tournament that redefined the cricketing landscape, has been a goldmine of drama, thrills, and unforgettable moments, especially during its formative years.From 2008 to 2016, the first nine seasons gave fans everything from last-ball finishes to controversies that lit up headlines. And at TimesofIndia.com today, we take a deep dive into those defining moments.The IPL couldn’t have asked for a better opening act in its inaugural season. Brendon McCullum, donning the golden-and-black Kolkata Knight Riders jersey, launched the league in style with a jaw-dropping 158 not out off 73 balls at the Chinnaswamy Stadium against Royal Challengers Bengaluru (formerly Royal Challengers Bangalore).RCB were stunned, fans were hooked, and the world sat up and took notice.

Indian pacer Mohammed Siraj emerged as a fan favourite at Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) after joining the franchise in 2018, developing a strong bond with Virat Kohli . While Siraj faced his fair share of challenges early on, he made a strong comeback under Kohli's guidance. However, Siraj's seven-year stint at RCB recently came to an end after he was signed by Gujarat Titans (GT) for Rs 12.25 crore in the IPL 2025 player auction.""I felt emotional after leaving RCB. Virat bhai has played a major role in my career. He backed and supported me a lot when I was in a tough situation in 2018-19, choosing to retain me. After that, my performances improved, and my career graph went up. GT will face RCB on April 2, and I am looking forward to it,"" Siraj said in a pre-season press conference. The Indian pacer picked up 83 wickets in 87 matches for RCB, finishing as the franchise's third-highest wicket-taker.Siraj was also asked about his opinion on the Impact Player rule in the IPL, which has received mixed reactions from the cricketing fraternity. ""As a bowler, I feel the rule is unfair. Earlier, taking an early wicket or two used to shift the momentum in favor of the bowling side. Now, even after an early breakthrough, batters continue to hit fours and sixes. The wickets are flat, and the dew factor also comes into play, making it very difficult for bowlers,"" he stated.The GT pacer was recently in the spotlight after Team India captain Rohit Sharma pointed out his reduced effectiveness as the ball older. Siraj was also left out of India's squad for the Champions Trophy 2025 .""I have taken the most wickets with the old ball in the past year among the world's ten fastest bowlers. My economy rate is also low. The numbers speak for themselves—I have performed well with both the new and old ball,"" he said.","Mohammed Siraj joined Gujarat Titans in the IPL 2025 player auction.

SALIVA BAN LIFTED

IPL: How will GT, LSG, DC, PBKS, RR fare? Greenstone Lobo predicts

NEW DELHI: The Indian Premier League (IPL) has introduced several new rules over the years, including strategic timeouts and the Impact Player rule. Now, the tournament is set to implement another innovation in IPL 2025 – the ‘Second Ball’ rule.The ‘Second Ball’ rule has been introduced to counter the impact of dew in night matches. Dew makes it difficult for bowlers to grip the ball, giving batters a significant advantage, especially during run chases. To address this issue, the IPL has introduced a provision allowing the use of a second ball in night games.Under this rule, on-field umpires will assess the condition of the ball after the 11th over of the second innings. If excessive dew is detected, the bowling team will be permitted to use a new ball.This rule aims to provide bowlers with a fairer playing field in dewy conditions.The ‘Second Ball’ rule will not be applicable in afternoon matches.The BCCI also lifted the ban on use of saliva on the ball in the upcoming Indian Premier League after a majority of captains agreed to its proposal, making it the first major cricket competition to do away with the restriction that was a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic.The decision was taken at the captains' meeting in Mumbai ahead of the league starting on Saturday.""The saliva ban has been lifted. Majority of captains were in favour of the move. Some had reservations about the re-introduction, some sat on the fence but majority of them supported the move,"" a top BCCI official told PTI.The International Cricket Council (ICC) had banned the age-old practice of applying saliva to shine the ball as a precautionary measure during the COVID-19 pandemic, during which health practitioners advocated strict hygiene protocols and physical distancing.In 2022, the world body made the ban permanent.The IPL too included the ICC ban in its playing conditions in the aftermath of the pandemic but its guidelines are outside the purview of the sport's governing body.With the development on Thursday, the IPL became the first major cricketing event to re-introduce saliva's use after the pandemic.","The Indian Premier League (IPL) has introduced several new rules over the years, including strategic timeouts and the Impact Player rule.
