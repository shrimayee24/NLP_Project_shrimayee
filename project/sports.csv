San Antonio Spurs injury report for the game against the Memphis Grizzlies (February 3, 2025)



When and where to watch the game between the San Antonio Spurs and the Memphis Grizzlies (February 3, 2025)?



Thewill be without their star point guard,, as they prepare to face the San Antonio Spurs on Monday, February 3. Morant has been ruled out due to a shoulder injury, adding to the Grizzlies’ growing list of absences.Alongside Ja Morant, the Grizzlies will be without Cam Spencer (thumb), Marcus Smart (finger), and Vince Williams Jr. (ankle). This leaves Memphis significantly shorthanded as they look to maintain their strong form. The team currently holds a 33-16 record and sits near the top of the Western Conference standings.Despite these setbacks, the Grizzlies have continued to perform at a high level. Jaren Jackson Jr. has emerged as the team’s leading scorer over the past 20 games, averaging 25.3 points, 6.6 rebounds, and 3.1 assists per contest. Desmond Bane has also been a key contributor, posting 20.3 points and 6 assists per game. Ja Morant ’s absence is a significant blow for Memphis, as he is a crucial playmaker and offensive leader. The Grizzlies are currently the highest-scoring team in the NBA, averaging 123.4 points per game. However, their defensive struggles—allowing 115.7 points per game (23rd in the league)—could be further exposed without Morant’s presence.In Morant’s absence, the team will likely lean more on Jackson Jr. and Bane to handle the scoring load. Luke Kennard, who is averaging 11.9 points and 3.9 assists per game, may also see an increased role.On the Spurs’ side, the only player listed on the injury report is rookie sensation Victor Wembanyama , who is questionable with an illness. Wembanyama has been a dominant force, averaging 24.4 points, 11 rebounds, and 4.3 blocks per game over the last 20 contests. His availability will be a crucial factor in San Antonio’s chances against a depleted Grizzlies squad.Also read: Will Chet Holmgren play tonight against the Milwaukee Bucks?

Controversy Surrounding Jey Uso Before the Royal Rumble

WWE’s Strategy Moving Forward

The 2025 Royal Rumble was one of the most talked about events in recent WWE history, and not just because of the in-ring action. Jey Uso ’s victory was overshadowed by off-screen controversy, as rumors of an alleged affair with NXT star Jaida Parker had been circulating in the weeks leading up to the event. However, despite the speculation and media scrutiny, Uso delivered a career-defining performance, eliminating John Cena to secure his spot in the main event of WrestleMania 41.The rumors began when a video surfaced in mid-2023, reportedly showing Uso and Parker in the background of a clip shared by fellow wrestler Indi Hartwell. Though there was no concrete evidence of wrongdoing, fans quickly speculated about a possible affair. Neither Uso, who is married to Takecia Travis, nor Parker addressed the claims, but the controversy remained a hot topic in WWE circles. Some media outlets even debated whether the distraction played a role in Uso’s past world title losses.Despite the off-screen drama, Uso entered the Royal Rumble determined to prove himself. Having transitioned from a tag team specialist to a legitimate singles competitor, he faced immense pressure to deliver. His performance was nothing short of spectacular, as he overcame several top WWE superstars before eliminating John Cena in a shocking conclusion.The elimination of Cena not only cemented Uso’s victory but also symbolized his rise to main-event status. It was a statement that, regardless of the rumors, he was ready to headline WrestleMania. Analysts noted that he remained composed throughout the match, showing no signs that the controversy had affected his focus.WWE has a long history of incorporating real-life controversies into storylines, and Uso’s situation may be no different. His Royal Rumble victory could serve as a catalyst for further character development, possibly leading to high-stakes rivalries ahead of WrestleMania. Whether WWE directly addresses the rumors or keeps them in the background remains to be seen.With a championship match at WrestleMania 41 now guaranteed, all eyes will be on Uso to see how he handles the road ahead—both inside and outside the ring.","Jey Uso eliminated John Cena to secure his spot in the main event of WrestleMania 41.

San Antonio Spurs vs Memphis Grizzlies: Prediction

The San Antonio Spurs will visit the Memphis Grizzlies at the FedExForum in what will be their third meeting of the 2024/25 season. A few hours ahead of this game, the Spurs traded for De'Aaron Fox and now look like a new team. It'll be interesting to see if this gigantic trade will help the Spurs grab their first win of the season against the Grizzlies.Continue reading to see betting tips and our prediction for tonight's match.- Moneyline: Spurs (+215) vs Grizzlies (-260)- Spread: Spurs (+6.5) vs Grizzlies (-6.5)- Total (O/U): Spurs -110 (O 241.5) vs Grizzlies -110 (U 241.5)(Note: Odds are correct at the time of writing and likely to change.)- Victor Wembanyama’s points and rebounds props stand at 23.5 and 11.5, respectively. However, last time around, Wembanyama was shut down by the Grizzlies and only managed to score 10 points. While he could easily reach his rebound prop, it wouldn’t be surprising if Wemby is held under 23 points tonight.- Bookmakers expect Chris Paul to surpass his assists prop of 7.5. However, Paul is averaging 5.5 assists against the Grizzlies this season and Wembanyama might not suit up for tonight’s game. So, it would be smart to bet on Paul not reaching his assists prop of 7.5.The San Antonio Spurs are not having a good season so far and are currently 12th in the Western Conference. The team has also lost seven out of its last 10 games. However, the Spurs have recently traded for De’Aaron Fox and look much stronger now. While the old Spurs would’ve looked like underdogs against the Grizzlies, the new-look Spurs seem like they might be able to put up a fight, at least on paper.While the Spurs are looking stronger now, the Grizzlies still look better. The team has now captured the second seed in the West and is inching closer to the OKC Thunder. It’s hard to imagine the Spurs winning tonight’s match with the Grizzlies being in such fine form. However, it will sure be interesting to see how Victor Wembanyama and De'Aaron Fox mesh together. If they click, we could be in for quite a night of basketball.Our prediction: The Grizzlies will winALSO READ: San Antonio Spurs vs Memphis Grizzlies (02/03): Starting five, injury report, start time, how to watch, and more Who do you think will come out on top when the Memphis Grizzlies host the San Antonio Spurs tonight?

Milwaukee Bucks injury report for the game against the OKC Thunder (February 3, 2025)



When and where to watch the game between the Milwaukee Bucks and the OKC Thunder?



’s rising starwill not play in the team’s upcoming matchup against the Milwaukee Bucks due to a hip injury. The highly anticipated clash, set for Monday, February 3, at the Paycom Center, will see the Western Conference powerhouse navigate multiple absences as they continue their strong season. Chet Holmgren ’s absence adds to an already extensive injury list for the Oklahoma City Thunder, who enter the game with a league-best 38-9 record. Alongside the talented big man, Oklahoma City will also be without Ajay Mitchell (toe) and Nikola Topic, who is sidelined for the season with an ACL injury. The status of key players Alex Caruso (ankle), Jalen Williams (wrist), and Cason Wallace (shoulder) remains uncertain, as all are listed as questionable.Despite these setbacks, the Oklahoma City Thunder have relied heavily on Shai Gilgeous-Alexander’s MVP-level performance. The star guard is averaging 33.8 points per game over the last 20 contests and continues to lead Oklahoma City’s offensive charge. With Chet Holmgren out, additional scoring and defensive responsibilities will likely fall on Isaiah Hartenstein, Aaron Wiggins, and the rest of the supporting cast.Milwaukee, currently holding a 26-21 record, faces its own injury challenges. Damian Lillard (groin) and Gary Trent Jr. (hip) are both probable for the game, while Bobby Portis is ruled out due to personal reasons. The Bucks will continue to lean on two-time MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo, who is averaging 25.9 points and 11.1 rebounds per game over his last 20 appearances.Chet Holmgren, in his rookie season, has been a crucial piece for Oklahoma City , providing rim protection, rebounding, and offensive versatility. His absence will test the team’s depth, particularly against a Bucks squad known for its interior presence with Antetokounmpo and Brook Lopez.The Oklahoma City Thunder currently lead the NBA in defensive efficiency, allowing just 104.7 points per game. However, missing Chet Holmgren could create challenges in containing Milwaukee’s inside attack. With Jalen Williams and Caruso’s availability still in question, Oklahoma City’s defensive rotations could see significant adjustments.Holmgren's health will continue to be a major plot point as the Thunder contend for the top spot in the Western Conference. Even though his hip injury is not expected to be permanent, Oklahoma City's hopes of winning a title may depend on his availability going forward.Also read: Will Giannis Antetokounmpo play tonight against the OKC Thunder?

We are waiting on his fitness and will know his status in early February from the medical team. We'll probably find out a bit more around that time, what exactly, and with regards to what his medical condition is, I'm sure BCCI might just put something out, from the physio itself,"" Agarkar had said.The selectors have little over a week to take a call on Bumrah as they would need to confirm the final 15-member squad for the Champions Trophy to the International Cricket Council (ICC). Harshit Rana , named in the squad for England ODIs, could come in should Bumrah not get the green light.Rohit Sharma & Co. have already started preparations for the ICC event as they have a short camp in Nagpur before the three-ODI series versus England gets underway.Men in Blue are then likely to leave for Dubai on February 15 and will camp there for the entire tournament.

""Their one-day cricket over the last little bit has been absolutely outstanding. We know they're not always the most predictable team in those big tournaments, but they seem like they've sorted things out a little bit.""Pakistan won the last edition of the Champions Trophy in 2017, when they defeated India in the final.The tournament will run from February 19 to March 9 in hybrid format, beginning with the match between hosts Pakistan and New Zealand in Karachi.While Lahore, Karachi and Rawalpindi will host matches in Pakistan, India will play all their games in Dubai as part of an agreement between the ICC, the Pakistan Cricket Board and the Board of Control for Cricket in India.The 2013 winners India, who refused to travel to Pakistan for the tournament, will take on the archrivals in their group fixture on February 23 in Dubai.",Champions Trophy returns to ICC calendar for first time since 2017.

Myles Garrett Trade Request: Myles Garrett Drops a Bombshell: Requests Trade from Browns to Chase Super Bowl Glory!,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/myles-garrett-drops-a-bombshell-requests-trade-from-browns-to-chase-super-bowl-glory/articleshow/117895484.cms,"Credit - AP

Myles Garrett's Official Statement: The Heartfelt Decision Behind His Departure



""This is one of the toughest decisions of my life,"" Garrett admitted. ""But I can't settle. I want to win, and I need to put myself in the best position to do that.""

Myles Garrett’s Growing Frustration with the Browns’ Struggles

What Happens Next? Trade Talks & Possible Destinations

The biggest question now is: Where will he land?

Might be playing on a Super Bowl contender that needs that final piece to dominate on the defensive side of the ball?

Will the Browns buck up and await mending, or hold to their defensive ace?

Or do these events constitute the start of a massive rumble in Northeast Ohio?

Myles Garrett has been the heart and soul of the Cleveland Browns ' defense for nearly a decade—a relentless pass rusher, a locker-room leader, and a player who gave everything to the franchise. But after eight seasons, Garrett has made the toughest decision of his career: he wants out. His goal? To finally compete for a Super Bowl.This is not just another trade request; it is the exit of a generational talent, and it marks a major shift in the future of the Browns.On February 3, 2025, Garrett took to social media to confirm what many had been speculating—his time in Cleveland was coming to an end. It wasn't an easy choice, but the frustration of years spent on a team that couldn't get over the hump had taken its toll.It was a heart-wrenching statement for Browns fans, many of whom would have loved him to be their centerpiece. For Garrett, though, it was no longer about personal success. He wanted what every elite player dreams of: a shot at the Lombardi Trophy.The Browns' 2024 season was simply disastrous. With a 3-14 record, last in the AFC North, and not much of an obvious way forward, it would have been tough for Garrett to envision a long-term future in Cleveland. And even with his own dominating season—14 sacks and a Defensive Player of the Year nomination—it just wasn't good enough.For years, Garrett remained loyal, believing the Browns could turn things around. But after another losing season, he had to face reality: the rebuild was going to take time, and at 29 years old, he wasn't willing to wait any longer.The Browns are saying they aren't actively shopping Garrett, but with the star defender pushing for a move, the pressure is mounting. A player of his caliber doesn't hit the trade market often, and teams in win-now mode will be lining up with offers.This could mean a massive return in draft picks and young talent for Cleveland, speeding up their rebuild. Yet losing a player of Garrett's caliber would be a devastating blow to Cleveland's defense.Well, one thing is for certain—Myles Garrett's desire to be moved is one of the biggest trade requests of an NFL offseason; wherever he reports next, look for the world to be observing.Also read - Terrell Owens Joins the ‘NFL Is RIGGED’ Club, Says League Is FIXED for Mahomes & the Chiefs!","Cleveland Browns star Myles Garrett announced he is leaving the team.

Brett Favre believes he was staged unfairly by ESPN and NFL Films

Mark Gastineau was the one to challenge Brett Favre in December 2023 regarding Michael Strahan's sack of Green Bay Packers legend. In the last game of the 2001 season, Favre, New York Giants legend, fell on the field and then was tackled by Strahan to set a record that was later tied by T.J. Watt. Gastineau charged Favre with taking a dive.Mark Gastineau met Favre at a memorabilia event last year, saying that Favre had ""hurt"" him and that he was going to ""take my sack back"" in a heated exchange. The confrontation was featured in ESPN 's 30 for 30, ""New York Sack Exchange;"" not coincidentally, Favre said he believes the meeting had been planned by ""ESPN and/or NFL Films .""Brett Favre, a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame and quarterback, finds himself entangled in a controversy which, according to him, was a well-thought-out plan. Favre has been defending an exchange with former Jets pass rusher Mark Gastineau over the all-time single-season sack record which, according to him, was staged unfairly by ESPN and NFL Films.Gastineau stood up against Favre for sliding on the final play of the 2001 season where Michael Strahan got his record-breaking 22.5th sack. However, in Favre's view, the entire situation was manipulated to create drama. ""I feel like I was set up,"" the Green Bay Packers legend said. ""I was under the impression that it was just a conversation, not an ambush.”Gastineau, who previously held the NFL record for two decades, expressed frustration over a significant flaw in the sport's history. It shouldn't have happened that way,"" Gastineau reportedly told Favre. Favre, however, stands by his actions, insisting that his play wasn't premeditated. ""I wasn't thinking about records- I was thinking about getting out of there in one piece,"" he explained.The former NFL legend has maintained a close friendship with Donald Trump, frequently attending rallies and playing golf together, and expressed joy upon Trump's return to power. ""I just want to congratulate President @realDonaldTrump on taking office today,"" Favre posted to Twitter on January 20. ""He's been a good friend. ""And I think he will help mend fences and turn the country around - not just for some people, but everyone.

Golden State Warriors looking to make a major trade before trade deadline (Image via Getty)

The Los Angeles Lakers shook the NBA world on Sunday with a blockbuster trade, sending Anthony Davis to the Dallas Mavericks in a daring three-team deal involving the Utah Jazz. This monumental trade stunned everyone, but themight be poised to steal the spotlight before the February 6 trade deadline with a bold move that could reshape the league.According to The Stein Line’s Jake Fischer , sources indicate that the Golden State Warriors ' decision-makers are exploring the possibility of acquiring two of the NBA’s biggest stars—LeBron James and Kevin Durant .Fischer reported.While this trade seems like a long shot, it’s not out of the realm of possibility. The challenge lies in salary-matching and asset valuation, but the Golden State Warriors have a history of making big moves that defy expectations. Acquiring Kevin Durant and LeBron James would be a masterstroke that could elevate the franchise’s championship prospects, although it would come at a hefty cost, both in terms of future assets and roster adjustments.Kevin Durant, who has already played alongside Golden State Warriors’ star Stephen Curry, has proven chemistry with the two-time MVP. Together, they won two championships (2016-2019) under coach Steve Kerr. However, the pairing of Curry with LeBron James has never been realized in an official NBA game. James, a four-time NBA champion, has only had the opportunity to witness Curry’s brilliance in NBA All-Star contests and Olympic events, but never as a teammate.The thought of Curry, Kevin Durant , and James sharing the same court is an exciting prospect. Curry’s unparalleled shooting, Durant’s versatile scoring, and LeBron James’ ability to dominate the offense while facilitating for teammates could form an unstoppable trio. This combination would not only be a force on the court but would certainly draw fans from across the globe, further solidifying the Golden State Warriors as a powerhouse in the NBA.However, it’s important to note that this bold pursuit may not be the most realistic option for the Warriors. A trade of this magnitude would require the team to sacrifice future assets and potentially mortgage their long-term success. With the trade deadline looming, the Warriors may ultimately explore more pragmatic moves to strengthen their roster, but the idea of uniting these three superstars is undeniably tantalizing for Warriors fans.Also read: NBA Trade Rumor: Los Angeles Lakers eye blockbuster 3-way trade for $151 million star trio after shocking Anthony Davis move It's unclear if the Warriors will be able to make a big move that mirrors the Lakers' unexpected transaction as the trade deadline draws near.

Dom DiSandro, better known as "" Big Dom ,"" is a towering presence both on and off the field at Lincoln Financial Field . As the senior advisor to the general manager, chief security officer , and game day operations expert, DiSandro plays a crucial role in the Eagles' success.

With 26 seasons under his belt, ""Big Dom"" is integral to the team's operation.As the Philadelphia Eagles gear up for their Super Bowl LIX clash against the Kansas City Chiefs, all eyes are on the players and coaches. However, amidst the frenzy of media day, a less expected star emerged: the Eagles’ Chief Security Officer, Dom DiSandro, affectionately known as ""Big Dom"" among the Philly faithful.During his appearance at the podium, Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni couldn't help but sing DiSandro’s praises, emphasizing the integral role Big Dom plays within the team. “Nobody does their job better in the National Football League than Big Dom does his,” Sirianni stated. His admiration for DiSandro went beyond simple respect. “He’s awesome. He truly just wants to help other people. That’s just an unbelievable quality to have that makes him special.""Sirianni continued, highlighting how deeply Big Dom is loved by the players and staff. “You can hear it from all of our players of what they think about Dom.

How India T20 opener

- who scored a blazing 54-ball 135 against England at

Wankhede Stadium

on Sunday - found his zone

MUMBAI: Nairobi. 1996. Afridi. 37-ball 100. Whenever you thought about fast tons, only the charismatic Pathan's blitz vs Sri Lanka flashed before your eyes. Even though the knock wasn't televised in India. Even though AB de Villiers bettered it by six balls in 2015.Now, Indian fans too can lay claim to another special 37-ball 100 that deserves its place in folklore for the quality of the attack it came against and the purity of the ball striking. Abhishek Sharma's 54-ball 135 vs England in the fifth T20I at Wankhede Stadium on Sunday.Mumbai's throbbing cricketing epicentre was as loud as a Coldplay concert as it screamed in chorus, ""Abhi-Shek, Abhi-Shek"" to endorse the above sentiment.While he stopped enroute to the dug-out, turned around and acknowledged the crowd, after the game, he would have been eager to log in to his social media feed to find appreciation from his mentor, Yuvraj Singh And there it was. ""Well played @IamAbhiSharma4! That's where I want to see you! Proud of you,"" read the post by Yuvraj on 'X'.Like father Yograj, Yuvraj has showered Abhishek with some tough love since taking him under his wing post the pandemic. He has told the media and fans not to expect him to don India colours after just one brilliant season in IPL or Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy (SMAT).While training him in different cities of India at God-forsaken hours on different pitches and simulating varied match situations, Yuvraj drilled it into Abhishek's head that he must bat deep and not be satisfied by pretty 30s and 40s.""Probably he should be happy today. He's always wanted me to bat into the 15th, and 20th over. I've tried to implement that,"" said Abhishek after the game.The transformation in Abhishek's batting where he married carnage and consistency, despite playing a high-risk, high reward game, came since the start of the Syed Mushtaq Ali 2023-2024 tournament where he was second on the run-scoring charts with 485 runs at a strike rate of 192.46 in Punjab's victorious campaign.Chats and net sessions with legendary West Indian Brian Lara, who was coach of the Sunrisers Hyderabad during the 2023 IPL, helped too. ""I worked hard ahead of that season and when I saw the results, I thought I should back myself and express myself,"" Abhishek told reporters.""I practised a lot of match scenarios in open nets. Lara had told me one thing - just play your shots but make sure that you don't get out. I had that in mind. I felt I could hit shots off the first or second ball as well. When you are young, you don't explore much, but I did that and realised I could play with more intent and help the team,"" he added.Intent is something Abhishek thrives on. He scored 255 runs in the SMAT this season at a strike-rate of 216 including a 28-ball ton. In last-year's IPL, opening with one of his idols, Travis Head , he slammed 484 runs at a strike-rate of 204.21. In 17 games for India, his 535 runs have come @193.84.Did the fastest 100 by an Indian record enter his head as he was on 94 off 32 and hitting sixes for fun? ""I was in a zone where I was just reacting to the ball. I didn't even know my score,"" Abhishek explained and credited Indian skipper Suryakumar Yadav for the ton. ""I just asked Surya paaji' what do you think?'. He said 'A wicket has just fallen. You can take a couple of balls.' That helped. I didn't realise I was going to hit the fastest hundred.""India play 13 more T20Is this year, but none before Aug. Abhishek will have competition for the opening slot from his India U-19 and Punjab teammate Shubman Gill and Yashasvi Jaiswal.How timely was this ton then? Abhishek's response was politically correct. ""There has never been competition among us - we are playing together since U-16s.There was just one dream - to play for India. The three of us are playing now. There is no better feeling.""",Abhishek Sharma scored 54-ball 135 against England at Wankhede Stadium. India T20 opener has scored 535 runs in 17 games for India. He scored 255 runs in the SMAT this season at a strike-rate of 216 including a 28-ball ton.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117899139,imgsize-72570,width-400,resizemode-4/117899139.jpg"

Gulbadin Naib played up to his reputation as one of the top all-rounders by hitting an outstanding undefeated fifty-five, and Qais Ahmad was outstanding for the Capitals, finishing with a fantastic spell of four for twenty-five.The victory completes a remarkable comeback for the Capitals, who had only won one of their first four games of the season before rallying to win four of their next five games and take second place in the standings.Now, on February 5, the Dubai Capitals will play Qualifier 1 against the same opponents, the Desert Vipers, while on February 6, MI Emirates will play Sharjah Warriorz in the Eliminator.

He nailed David Payne for a maximum, ending his blitzkrieg, but the Englishman caught him behind the very next delivery.The Capitals reached 50/1 at the end of the powerplay after Naib entered to bat at a deficit of one and immediately made his intentions known by clobbering Sam Curran for an incredible four. Wanindu Hasaranga let up just six runs in his next two overs, threatening to halt the Capitals' momentum, but the batters found the boundaries when they needed them most, coasting to 76/1 at the end of ten overs.Naib tried his luck in the eleventh over, but the Capitals were still well ahead of the needed run rate. Both top edges went past the boundary lines after he mistimed two shots. Hope skied a slow ball, giving the Vipers a great chance to cause some damage, but the catch was dropped, and the two quickly reached the 50-run mark for the second wicket.Khuzaima Tanveer was thrashed for 12 runs in the 14th over as the Capitals dominated, but Hasaranga returned to conclude his term with another tight over, giving up only four runs. They were well in control of the chase and only needed 26 runs from the last six overs.To reach 50 off just 29 deliveries, Naib hit Tanveer for a maximum over deep midwicket. Naib was dropped again on the following ball, demonstrating the Vipers' ongoing poor fielding.Soon after, Hope led the Capitals to a decisive nine-wicket victory with a brilliant pull shot that brought him up to his fourth 50 of the tournament.","Dubai Capitals beat Desert Vipers by nine wickets in ILT20.

I would say it was all possible because of the efforts I put in the practice, the backing I got from the coaches and the captain when I was not getting the runs or not bowling well,"" Abhishek said in the post-match press meet.""All these things calculate (work out well) at the end and I had the belief that on my day, I will play an innings like this,"" he said.Also See: ICC Champions Trophy 2025 Abhishek said he enjoyed using the pace of the England pacers as well as hitting their leg-spinner Adil Rashid for a cumulative 13 sixes.""I do not remember half of them now to be honest,"" he quipped.""But the way I used the pace of the bowlers over covers or even against Adil Rashid… it felt good. I try to generate the match scenarios in nets and use the bowlers the way I am going to face in the match,"" Abhishek said.The 24-year-old said his particular celebrations after reaching his second T20I century were intended for his family and thanked India great Yuvraj Singh for his support during the journey.""My mother and sister are here for the match and when your parents are here and you play an innings like that in front of them, it makes you feel happy and proud for being able to share such a moment,"" he said.The batter claimed that there is no sense of rivalry or fear amongst between other contenders, such as Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill Also See: Champions Trophy Schedule 2025 ""I met Jaiswal and Shubman yesterday (on Saturday).

NEW DELHI: India's newest power-hitter, Abhishek Sharma , has learned early on that self-belief and fearlessness are crucial to increasing the likelihood of a favorable outcome in a sport as unpredictable as T20 cricket , where a batter is destined for more failures than successes.The Punjab batsman hasn't been on the international scene for a full year yet, but he came with great potential in domestic cricket, including a 2024 IPL title with Sunrisers Hyderabad .However, Abhishek, who is only 24, has started to threaten records that others took years to accomplish.In just his second match, he achieved his first T20I century, which was the third-fastest for any Indian at 46 balls. His second T20I century against England on Sunday was the second-fastest of any Indian (37 balls).He also claimed the joint-fastest century for any Indian in the coveted Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy with a brilliant 28-ball century.Also See: 2025 Champions Trophy One could wonder, ""What is the secret to such towering success at such a young age?"" Abhishek, who grew up playing in the opening slot for Punjab with Shubman Gill, has an easy response.It's difficult to overlook Yuvraj Singh 's influence on Abhishek's success, but to his credit, he has returned the favor on the field by doing all the legendary Indian all-rounder has asked him to do during their innumerable sessions in various setups over the past few years.""The focus was very much clear (during practice). Yuvi Paaji put all these things in my mind three or four years back,"" Abhishek told the media after his 54-ball 135 (13x6s, 7x4s) became the highest individual total by an Indian in T20Is, surpassing his friend Gill (126 off 63 balls in 2023).""Yuvi paaji was the one to believe in me, and when someone like Yuvraj Singh is telling you that you are going to play for the country and you are going to win the games, obviously you try to think that 'okay I will play for India and I will do my best',"" he said.Also See: ICC Champions Trophy Schedule 2025 ""They (Yuvraj and Punjab coach Wasim Jaffer) have played a major role in my cricketing career and they are going to continue doing that. But as I have said before, it is all because of him (Yuvraj),"" he said.A young cricket player's self-doubt and concerns are normal, but Abhishek's success story shows that trusting well-wishers can help you deal with those issues. The Indian team management is another component of this support system.""Because of the way he (Yuvraj) has treated me in the past and (during) every innings, he is someone who is always there for me,"" said Abhishek, who made 484 runs in 16 IPL matches in 2024 at a strike rate of 204.21 with three fifties.""He is the one guy I have always listened to and I think he knows better than me so I believe that,"" he added.According to Abhishek, it also helps that the team management gave him the confidence to give it his all and not worry about failing.""I didn't do well in few matches before this series and when your captain and coach tell you that 'you have to play like this and we are backing you, and we will be there for you always', as a youngster, that is the biggest motivation, I would say,"" he said.""In South Africa, I remember Hardik (Pandya) Paaji and Surya (Suryakumar Yadav) Paaji telling me that you will 100 per cent make some runs, but just believe in yourself'.""""In this series, obviously, Gauti ( Gautam Gambhir ) Paaji came back and then Surya Paaji. I feel really grateful that the way they believe in me. That's not normal for any player because that's the biggest motivation I would say for any young cricketer,"" he said.Then there was Brian Lara , who thinks highly of him and gave him a suggestion that significantly altered his strategy. He scored 485 runs at 48.50 in 10 games, including two hundreds and three fifties, to dominate the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy 2023-24. His runs came at a strike rate of 192.46.""I practiced a lot of match scenarios. I did a lot of open nets. But there was one thing in my mind that Brian Lara had (once) told me, 'play your shots but make sure you don't get out'.""I used to be careful that I won't get out to any bowler. That really helped me in these few years,"" he said.Even though he has demonstrated remarkable potential in a very unpredictable format, Abhishek is aware of his potential to set or shatter records, like Yuvraj's six sixes in an over.""I don't think that record can be broken anytime soon. I don't know if it can be broken at all. But if you consciously think about it while going in, then it won't happen,"" he said.""I think when you play your normal game, there are situations where you are in a zone and able to execute. I had asked Yuvi Paaji as well. He did not have any such plan of hitting six sixes but it happens when you are on the spot in such a zone,"" Abhishek added.","India's newest power-hitter, Abhishek Sharma, has learned early on that self- belief and fearlessness are crucial to increasing the likelihood of a favorable outcome.

Will Rohit Sharma win another ICC trophy? Here's what the horoscope says

Astrologer Greenstone Lobo has weighed in on India’s chances of winning the 2025 Champions Trophy , stating that the team is a strong contender, but there are challenges ahead, with some international captains posing a significant threat.Lobo delves into the horoscopes of key figures, including India’s captain Rohit Sharma and coach Gautam Gambhir, to predict the outcome. Starting with Rohit Sharma, Lobo notes that while Rohit’s chart shows some remarkable planetary alignments, it also reflects a history of both triumphs and setbacks.“Rohit Sharma has a very interesting horoscope. His Uranus and Neptune are exalted, which brings immense potential, but his Pluto is debilitated, creating a dichotomy of successes and failures,"" Lobo explains. This astrological tug-of-war has seen Rohit lead India to major victories, such as winning the 2024 T20 World Cup, but also disappointing losses like the 2023 World Cup final and India’s historic 3-0 defeat to New Zealand in the Test series.Looking at the global landscape, Lobo identifies several potential threats to India’s Champions Trophy aspirations. Among them is Pat Cummins, Australia’s captain, whose horoscope shows strong signs of success, given his impressive career and team’s past victories. “Pat Cummins’ chart is phenomenal. His team has diluted their karmic energy through multiple tournament wins, making them formidable contenders,” he says.However, Lobo sees a window of opportunity for India to seize the title. He compares Rohit to footballing legends like Leo Messi, who achieved success later in his career after many tournament wins with his club. “Rohit’s karmic energy has been diluted due to numerous club victories like his five IPL titles. But this Champions Trophy is not as significant as a World Cup, making it more likely for Rohit to capture this title,"" Lobo suggests.Lobo also highlights that Rohit’s horoscope is currently aligned in a way that strengthens India’s chances, as Uranus is transiting at the same degree as it was at the time of his birth, suggesting a peak opportunity to beat rivals and win. “This alignment shows that India has the highest chances to win the Champions Trophy,” he concludes.While the competition will be fierce, Lobo’s astrological insight points to India having a solid shot, with the final stages of the tournament likely to reveal more about their fate.","Astrologer Greenstone Lobo has weighed in on India's chances of winning the 2025 Champions Trophy.

NEW DELHI: India's head coach, Gautam Gambhir , praised his team for using ""high-risk, high-reward cricket"" to win the series against England 4-1 while laying out the plan to routinely score 250-plus runs in Twenty20 Internationals.The previous three Twenty20 Internationals between India and England demonstrated the country's philosophy of playing aggressive cricket regardless of the circumstances.England pacer Saqib Mahmood destroyed India in Pune by taking three wickets and adding a maiden in the second over.India's batsmen maintained the pressure and assaulted the English bowlers to finish their innings with a valiant score of 181/9, which was too much for the tourists to handle.Also See: ICC Champions Trophy 2025 Despite wickets falling from the other end on Sunday in Mumbai, Abhishek Sharma went all guns blazing, leading the hosts to a record-breaking 247/9, which is India's fourth-highest total in the format.""That's the kind of T20 cricket we want to play. We don't want to fear losing a game of cricket. We want to play high-risk, high-reward cricket and these guys have adopted that ideology, that policy really well. And I think the ideology of this T20 team is based on selflessness and fearlessness. And I think in the last six months, these guys have done it day in, day out,"" Gambhir told the host broadcaster.""We want to try and get to 250-260 regularly. And in trying to do that, there'll be games where we'll get bundled out for 120-130. And that is what T20 cricket is all about. And unless and until you don't play that high-risk cricket, you won't get those big rewards as well. Most importantly, I think we're on the right track. Come those big tournaments, we want to still continue playing this way, and we don't want to fear losing anything,"" he added.The failure of England to understand Varun Chakravarthy 's spin was a major factor in India's victory. The English batsmen were still baffled by the Indian mystery spinner.With a staggering 14 wickets at an average of 9.85 and an economy rate of 7.66, he concluded the series at the top of the wicket-taking rankings.""I think his transformation from IPL to international T20 cricket has been phenomenal. And this series was probably the benchmark as well because England is a high-quality side. They've got some really quality cricketers and the kind of surfaces we've played on - I think they were fantastic batting wickets, and the way he's bowled those tough overs has been phenomenal,"" Gambhir said of Varun.","India's head coach, Gautam Gambhir, praised his team for using ""high-risk, high- reward cricket"" to win the series against England 4-1. The previous three Twenty20 Internationals between India and England demonstrated the country's philosophy of playing aggressive cricket regardless of the circumstances.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117874639,imgsize-48994,width-400,resizemode-4/117874639.jpg"
Ranji Trophy: Mumbai get Surya and Dube boost for quarterfinal vs Haryana,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/ranji-trophy-mumbai-get-surya-and-dube-boost-for-quarterfinal-vs-haryana/articleshow/117900047.cms,"The Squad:

MUMBAI: In a major boost for the defending champions, India's T20 captain Suryakumar Yadav , currently struggling for form though, and allrounder Shivam Dube , on Monday, were included in Mumbai's 18-man squad for the Ranji Trophy quarterfinal against Haryana at the Chaudhary Bansi Lal Cricket Stadium in Lahli, which will be played from February 8.However, Mumbai chief selector Sanjay Patil asserted that both SKY and Dube will have to pull in their weight in the match, in the light of Mumbai's shocking defeat against Jammu & Kashmir in the league phase despite the presence of as many as six India players in the XI, which even put their qualification for the knockouts at risk till they beat Meghalaya in their last league game at the BKC in Mumbai. They got through because J&K defeated Baroda.""I'm very clear on this. Considering our defeat against J&K, which came despite the presence of six India cricketers in our lineup, which was very disappointing, I want both SKY and Dube not to just participate in this Ranji Trophy knockout match, but perform well, and contribute to Mumbai's victory,"" Patil told TOI.""I'm still upset at the J&K defeat, which I feel was our worst-ever. To accommodate the India players in that match, we had to deprive a few talented youngsters (like opener Ayush Mhatre). Mumbai needs players who can perform and make the side win games, something which was missing in that match. The India players need to realise it's not just about being 'available' for that game. The culture of Mumbai cricket has always been about giving your 100% when you are playing for Mumbai,"" he stressed.
