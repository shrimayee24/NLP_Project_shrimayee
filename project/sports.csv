Nestor Cortes immediate impact of elbow strain

Nestor Cortes's injury history and future outlook

The Milwaukee Brewers issued a statement declaring that Nestor Cortes, their starting pitcher, has been put on the 15-day injured list owing to a strain in his left elbow flexor. The move questions the depth of the pitching staff and also Nestor Cortes' health, more so considering the history of similar injuries.The Brewers put left-hander Nestor Cortes on the 15-day injured list on April 6, 2025, because of a left elbow flexor strain . It is the second time in eight months that Nestor Cortes has suffered this specific injury; he was previously out due to the same reason playing for the New York Yankees in September 2024. Despite that, he was available again in time to serve during the World Series.Nestor Cortes has had a rollercoaster ride of a season in terms of ups and downs. He miserably failed in his debut for the Brewers, giving up eight runs, five of which were home runs, over two innings against his old team, the Yankees. He returned with vengeance in his second appearance, throwing six shutout innings and taking the Brewers to a nail-biting 1-0 win against the Cincinnati Reds.Nestor Cortes' chronic elbow problem is concerning. His previous IL stint back in September of 2024 was also attributed to the same flexor strain. Even in light of all these, Brewers assistant GM Matt Kleine sounded optimistic by describing the current injury as unlikely to be a ""long-term issue.""During his career, Cortes has recorded 34-22 with a 3.88 ERA in 137 games. The Brewers bullpen has been significantly damaged by the early injury troubles of the season. Nestor Cortes is the seventh rotation starter to have gone onto the injured list, proving the team's ongoing issue of keeping healthy in the rotation.While the Brewers endure these missteps, attention will be given to their roster and seeing that guys like Cortes are given whatever care they must have to again get back into top form. Team officials, along with the fans, will be watching eagerly for his comeback, hoping he can come back swiftly and fully in action on the mound.Also Read: “Going To Learn A Lot”: Brewers’ Nestor Cortes Reflects On Tough Game Against New York Yankees",Nestor Cortes has been put on the 15-day injured list with a left elbow flexor strain.

Awkward, cringeworthy handshake between Anastasia Shubskaya and Gary Bettman

One of the most compelling narratives in the NHL right now is Alex Ovechkin’s pursuit of Wayne Gretzky’s all-time goal record. On Wednesday night, despite the Washington Capitals falling 5-1 to the Carolina Hurricanes, Ovechkin was the lone bright spot for his team. The 39-year-old sniper unleashed a powerful shot from the high slot in the second period, beating goaltender Frederik Andersen and notching the 892nd goal of his storied career. Alex Ovechkin's wife shared a celebratory high-five with Capitals owner Ted Leonsis and then attempted to include NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman in the momentAlex Ovechkin, a 13-time NHL All-Star and three-time Hart Trophy winner, continues to edge closer to one of the greatest milestones in hockey history.

Players responded with cheers to Wayne Gretzky’s speech

During the 4 Nations Face-Off final in February 2025, hockey legend Wayne Gretzky gave a heartfelt locker room speech to Team Canada. His wife, Janet Gretzky, shared a video on Instagram showing Wayne shaking hands with team captain Sidney Crosby before addressing the players.In the speech, Wayne Gretzky announced the starting lineup and fired up the team with words about pride, teamwork, and representing their country. The moment sparked loud cheers from the players, showing how much his presence meant.""First of all, congratulations. You made the hockey world proud, ex-players, and of course the country, so good for you guys. It's been fun to watch,"" Gretzky said. ""I know you give up a lot of time to do these kinds of things, but nothing is more fun than playing for the country. So I wish you guys good luck tonight.”Canada went on to win the final in dramatic fashion—beating the USA 3-2 in overtime, with Connor McDavid scoring the winning goal. After the game, Gretzky gave each player a red “Be Great” cap as a personal gesture of encouragement.Though many fans celebrated his role, some criticized him for not wearing a Team Canada jersey and being too friendly with the American team. These reactions were fueled by his past ties with former U.S. President Donald Trump.Donald Trump’s tariffs and remarks about Canada becoming the 51st state have strained U.S.-Canada relations. This week, NHL legend Dominik Hasek criticized Wayne Gretzky’s perceived closeness to Trump, questioning his loyalty to Canada in light of recent events.“It is not surprising to me that Canadian people are asking about the attitude of a man who is a Canadian icon. To be honest, I am also interested in his attitude. He must know best why he does not express himself on this. Be sure to ask him.”Wayne Gretzky has been under fire from some Canadians over his perceived friendship with Donald Trump.

SRH vs GT IPL 2025, Hyderabad weather prediction

Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) face Gujarat Titans (GT) at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad today, desperate to halt a three-match losing streak.Despite an explosive 286-run start to the IPL season, SRH’s all-out attacking approach has backfired, with scores of 190, 163, and 120 in the subsequent games.Their batting stars, including Travis Head, Ishan Kishan, and Heinrich Klaasen, have failed to deliver consistently, and the bowling unit — led by skipper Pat Cummins — has struggled, with high economy rates and no bowler completing four overs in every match.Also See: GT vs SRH Live Score, IPL 2025 Currently at the bottom of the points table, SRH risk slipping out of playoff contention.In contrast, the Gujarat Titans are gaining momentum, buoyed by a big win over RCB. With a strong top order of Gill, Sudharsan and Buttler, and finishers like Rutherford and Tewatia, they look balanced.While Rabada’s absence is a blow, options like Coetzee or Phillips could fill the gap. Titans also boast a more disciplined bowling attack, giving them an edge.Hyderabad’s red soil pitch promises bounce and carry, but it slows as the ball ages. Despite average boundaries (69m, 67m, 79m), on average 24 sixes are hit per game. It’s a dry, grassless, firm surface. Batting first is ideal, as past matches saw 200+ totals in all innings.Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Ishan Kishan, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen (wk), Aniket Verma, Abhinav Manohar, Pat Cummins (c), Simarjeet Singh, Harshal Patel, Mohammed Shami– Zeeshan Ansari/Adam ZampaSai Sudharsan, Shubman Gill (c), Jos Buttler (wk), Shahrukh Khan, Rahul Tewatia, Arshad Khan, Rashid Khan, Ravisrinivasan Sai Kishore, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Ishant Sharma– Sherfane Rutherford/Washington SundarPat Cummins (c), Ishan Kishan (wk), Atharva Taide, Abhinav Manohar, Aniket Verma, Sachin Baby, Heinrich Klaasen, Travis Head, Harshal Patel, Kamindu Mendis, Wiaan Mulder, Abhishek Sharma, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Mohammed Shami, Rahul Chahar, Adam Zampa, Simarjeet Singh, Zeeshan Ansari, Jaydev Unadkat and Eshan Malinga.Shubman Gill (C), Jos Buttler, B.

A rainy race day on the cards at the Japanese Grand Prix

After Australia, another wet and wild race is on the cards at the Japanese Grand Prix on Sunday. Red Bull’s Max Verstappen secured pole position on Saturday, setting the stage for the final race at Suzuka. According to the weather forecast, there are chances of rain during the race, which has made his fans even more confident about his victory. However, it's difficult to predict what will happen at the Suzuka Circuit , as it’s not just Verstappen in the race—McLaren’s Lando Norris is also a strong contender and is high on confidence after winning the rain-affected race in Melbourne.The race will start at 2 p.m. local time. It will take place over 53 laps of the 5.807-kilometre Suzuka Circuit and is expected to last around 2 hours.According to the weather forecast shared by the FIA, showers are likely in the morning, which could dampen the dry grass. The temperature is expected to be higher than on the first two days, hovering around 17 degrees Celsius. After the morning showers, it may become a bit cloudy, with slightly reduced chances of rain during the race. However, the timing of the rain is unpredictable, and track conditions could fluctuate between wet and dry throughout the day.The storm and rain in Australia had overturned race strategies for many, resulting in multiple incidents and crashes on the wet track. In Japan, there's more to worry about than just the track. The frequent grass fires during practice sessions and qualifying race left drivers frustrated due to multiple red flags and the loss of precious time. Drivers may lose sleep over the weather prediction for Sunday, but many Formula 1 fans are expecting a more unpredictable and exciting race.As the official X (formerly Twitter) handle of Formula 1 asked the fans, “Anyone packed an umbrella?” many expressed their desire to see a wet race. One fan tweeted, “That would make things interesting.” Another wrote, “I would actually like to see a wet race. More chances to see Max coming out on top.” “Oh, exciting... Australia repeat?” asked a fan. One fan also said sarcastically, “At least the grass won’t burn.” Another comment read, “What’s with F1 scheduling races on every rainy weekend? Get it together, FIA.”Also Read: Grass Fires at the Japanese Grand Prix: Causes, concerns and why current efforts aren't enough Many, including Lewis Hamilton and Oscar Piastri, struggled in the rain-hit season opener in Melbourne.

The way he handles pressure situations, he stays calm there too. I also want to do that,” he said.Approximately five years ago, during open trials conducted by the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) for the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, Rathi faced a pivotal moment.After delivering a ball that was dispatched out of the ground by an established IPL player, he sought a replacement ball but was instead sidelined for the remainder of the trials, ultimately not making the shortlist.Undeterred by this setback, Rathi resolved to refine his bowling skills, focusing intensely on minimizing runs conceded. He immersed himself in local club and corporate matches around Delhi-NCR, where maintaining an economical bowling rate was crucial for continued selection and match fees.Emulating Narine, Rathi transformed his bowling style to prioritise accuracy and control, aiming to prevent boundaries and earn recognition for his disciplined approach.This dedication bore fruit when the Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) recognized his potential and included him in their squad for IPL 2025.

Jos Buttler Exclusive Interview: I owe Jayawardene for letting me open in T20

Saturday served up a doubleheader delight for IPL fans. In the opening clash, Delhi Capitals extended their unbeaten streak in IPL 2025 with a 25-run victory over five-time champions Chennai Super Kings at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Later in the evening, Rajasthan Royals produced a dominant performance, thrashing Punjab Kings by 50 runs at the Maharaja Yadavindra Singh International Cricket Stadium.Delhi Capitals climbed to the top of the IPL 2025 points table with a historic win at Chepauk, their first victory at the venue since 2010. Powered by a classy 77 from KL Rahul, who opened in place of the injured Faf du Plessis, DC posted a competitive 183/6. Chennai Super Kings, despite a valiant unbeaten 69 from Vijay Shankar, managed only 158/5 in response, handing Delhi a 25-run win.DC’s bowlers executed their plans to perfection on a surface that didn’t allow free stroke-play. Vipraj Nigam impressed with figures of 2/27, while the rest of the bowling unit chipped in, barring Mohit Sharma and Axar Patel.Mukesh Kumar gave DC the ideal start, removing Rachin Ravindra with a return catch off a leading edge. Mitchell Starc then trapped Ruturaj Gaikwad with a short ball that was pulled straight to deep square leg. Nigam joined the party by dismissing Devon Conway, and CSK’s powerplay ended at a shaky 46/3.With the pitch slowing down, DC kept Shivam Dube and Shankar in check. Dube eventually fell for 18 to Nigam, and Kuldeep Yadav struck with a googly to trap Ravindra Jadeja leg-before for two. Though Shankar was given a few lifelines—two dropped chances and a missed lbw—he broke a 28-ball boundary drought with a couple of crisp shots, bringing up his fifty off 43 balls.MS Dhoni, playing in front of his family, provided late fireworks with an unbeaten 30 off 26 balls, but the target proved too much as CSK suffered their second consecutive home loss. Yashasvi Jaiswal returned to form in style, scoring a fluent 67 to lead Rajasthan Royals to a commanding 50-run win over Punjab Kings at the Maharaja Yadavindra Singh International Cricket Stadium in Mullanpur.Jaiswal, who had struggled in his first three outings, struck three fours and five sixes in his 45-ball knock, sharing an 89-run opening stand with skipper Sanju Samson (38). Riyan Parag (43* off 25) and Shimron Hetmyer (20) provided the finishing touches as RR posted a daunting 205/4—the first 200-plus total at the venue in six matches.In reply, Punjab never recovered from the double blow inflicted by Jofra Archer in the first over. Archer dismissed Priyansh Arya with the first ball of the innings and sent back captain Shreyas Iyer with the last, finishing with 3/25.Despite a counterattacking 62 off 41 balls from Nehal Wadhera and a brisk 30 from Glenn Maxwell, Punjab’s chase crumbled. The pair added 88 runs before Maheesh Theekshana dismissed Maxwell, and Wanindu Hasaranga struck the next ball to remove Wadhera. Punjab eventually finished on 155/9, suffering their first loss of the season.","Delhi Capitals climb to the top of the IPL 2025 points table with a historic win at Chepauk.

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings ' lack of urgency in a tricky chase cost them dearly as they slumped to a 25-run defeat against Delhi Capitals in their Indian Premier League 2025 clash at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Saturday.Chasing 184, CSK were reeling at 74/5 in 10.4 overs when MS Dhoni walked in — his earliest entry in a full 20-over match since 2023. With 110 needed off 56 balls, he joined Vijay Shankar , who was on 24 off 23. The stage was set for a counterattack, but what followed was a sluggish and baffling passage of play.Despite their reputation as big-hitters, Dhoni and Shankar crawled to just 32 runs in the next 4.2 overs. Shankar eventually brought up his fifty in the 17th over off 43 balls — the slowest half-century of the season. Alarmingly, CSK now account for three of the four slowest fifties in IPL 2025 , raising concerns over the intent of their batters.Also See: SRH vs GT, IPL Live Score Dhoni, too, endured a forgettable outing. His first boundary — a six off Mukesh Kumar — came off the 19th ball he faced, the slowest any batter has taken to hit a boundary in this season. Though the duo added an unbeaten 84-run partnership, it came in 9.2 overs — far too passive to make an impact.Earlier, KL Rahul anchored Delhi’s innings with a classy 77 off 51 balls to take them to 183/6. With this win, DC remain unbeaten while CSK’s stuttering campaign continues.","Chennai Super Kings lost by 25 runs to Delhi Capitals in IPL 2025 clash.

When will CSK legend MS Dhoni retire from IPL? Astrologer Greenstone Lobo predicts

NEW DELHI: MS Dhoni ’s remarkable knack for reading a batter or bowler’s body language, devising a plan on the spot, and delivering game-changing results is no secret. From sharp stump-mic instructions like ""idhar daal,"" ""seedha daal,"" or ""off stump pe rakhna,"" Dhoni’s voice was a constant guide for his bowlers during his captaincy days.The former India skipper often got under the skin of his bowlers — not hesitating to scold them, deliver fiery pep talks, and on occasions, hand out a rare ""shabaash."" One of the many Indian bowlers to have experienced Dhoni's sharp cricketing mind firsthand is Yuzvendra Chahal The leg-spinner has been on the receiving end of Mahi’s tough love on multiple occasions but he credits a large part of his success to the wisdom and guidance of the legendary wicketkeeper.Punjab Kings , with two wins and one loss in their three matches so far, are gearing up to take on Chennai Super Kings next on Tuesday. And Yuzvendra Chahal can’t wait for the opportunity to meet and bowl to ‘Mahi bhai’ once again.The veteran leg-spinner, currently playing for Punjab Kings in IPL 2025 , remains the highest wicket-taker in the tournament’s history at 34 years of age.“Mahi bhai has watched me bowl from behind the stumps for years. He knows how I bowl, what I think, and what I’m likely to do. I can read — maybe 2 or 3 percent — of what Mahi bhai is thinking. I know the kind of situations he comes in to bat. If he walks in between overs 1–10, we know we have to attack. But if he comes in the later stages of the match, we understand exactly what he’ll try to do. We plan accordingly,"" Chahal said.""You can’t give him an easy ball — if you do, he’ll send it out of the park,"" the leg-spinner added.In his 163-match IPL career, Chahal has represented Mumbai Indians (2011–2013), Royal Challengers Bangalore (2014–2021), Rajasthan Royals (2022–2024), and is currently playing for Punjab Kings under the leadership of Shreyas Iyer.Over the years, Chahal has bowled under the captaincy of Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Sanju Samson, and now Iyer. When asked under whose leadership he enjoyed the most freedom while bowling, Chahal said: “Every captain I’ve played under has given me freedom, whether for India or in the IPL. A bowler always has a plan, and when you share it confidently with your captain, it makes a difference. I’ve had complete freedom under every captain I’ve played for.""""Last year, I played for Rajasthan Royals and that’s where I learned the art of bowling at the death. Before that, I had never bowled in the death overs. When you move to a new team, you pick up new skills,"" said Chahal on JioHotstar Press Room with Punjab Kings.On playing under Iyer, the leggie explained why he is enjoying the stint with PBKS.“I know Shreyas really well — he’s a good friend of mine. He gives you a lot of freedom. You can approach him at any time. He’s very calm. It’s not like if the opposition is scoring runs, he’ll panic — he remains composed. He listens to everyone, he’s very open-minded, and I’m really enjoying playing under his captaincy,” he said.Chahal last featured in an international match in 2023, a T20I against West Indies at Lauderhill. Since then, the leg-spinner has been out of the national setup. He once formed a formidable spin duo with left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav — a partnership famously dubbed ‘KulCha’ by fans and cricketers alike.When asked about a potential comeback and the iconic pairing, Chahal, who has claimed 121 wickets in 72 ODIs and 96 in 80 T20Is, said: “I have fond memories of the term ‘Kul-Cha’ and my partnership with Kuldeep (Yadav). That bond will always remain special.""""Kuldeep is doing so well right now — I’m really happy for him. He’s the best. In my eyes, he’s the No. 1 wrist-spinner in the world. Right now, it’s the IPL. We’ll see what the future holds,” he said.","Yuzvendra Chahal is currently playing for Punjab Kings in IPL 2025.

Stephen Curry has been the talk of the town as the Golden State Warriors star only scored 3 points in their devastating 106-96 loss against the Houston Rockets on April 6 at the Chase Center in San Francisco. The Warriors struggled despite their all-powerful stars in the roster, including Curry alongside Jimmy Bulter, Draymond Green , and Buddy Hield. Curry’s 3-point performance has gained a lot of buzz online as it became the center of a huge discussion.Stephen Curry surprised the NBA fans as the Warriors' standout star only scored 3 points in his latest performance against the Houston Rockets.Curry had a surprisingly off night, struggling to find his rhythm in Golden State's latest outing. He played over 32 minutes, while the Warriors' star guard managed only 1 field goal on 10 attempts, shooting a mere 10% from the field.His 1-for-8 performance from beyond the arc was even more uncharacteristic. Despite his shooting woes, Curry still found ways to contribute. He dished out 8 assists. However, with 4 turnovers and only 2 total rebounds, it was clear the night wasn’t going in his favor. Adding to the challenge, Curry didn’t attempt a single free throw.Curry’s performance was a far cry from his usual output as he finished the game with just 3 points and a -4 plus/minus. For fans, off nights are rare for the two-time MVP which cased a huge discussion online.Anthony Slater of The Athletic wrote, “Steph Curry: three points, 1/10 FG, four turnovers. Went from his most torrid four-night stretch of the season to possibly his worst game. Warriors waving white flag. They'll lose to Rockets and fall back into play-in danger.”Still, Curry’s history-making streak continued. He added another major milestone to his legendary career. In the first quarter of the Golden State Warriors' matchup against the Rockets, Curry passed Hall of Famer Reggie Miller to claim 24th place on the NBA’s all-time scoring list, surpassing Miller’s mark of 25,279 points.The Warriors' official X account celebrated the moment with a fitting tribute: ""Making waves ⚡️ Stephen Curry has passed Reggie Miller for 24th on the NBA’s all-time scoring list.""The next name on Curry’s climb is Alex English.

What Ashwin said?

Former India spinner R Ashwin has made it clear that going forward, he won't be covering any Chennai Super Kings ' (CSK) matches on his YouTube channel in the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL).In one of CSK's matches, former South Africa and Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) analyst Prasanna Agoram was seen questioning the franchise's decision to play Afghanistan spinner Noor Ahmad over veterans like R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja. The video was later taken down, but it sparked controversy.Following CSK's 25-run loss to Delhi Capitals at Chepauk, head coach Stephen Fleming called the matter ""irrelevant.""""I have no idea. I didn't even know he had a channel, so I don't know that stuff. That's irrelevant.""On Sunday, an admin note was posted on Ashwin's YouTube channel, stating that they will skip covering CSK's games.""Given the nature of the discussions on this forum over the last week, we want to be mindful of how things can be interpreted and have chosen to step away from covering CSK games, both previews and reviews, for the rest of this season,"" read the statement.""We value the diversity of perspectives that come through on our shows and remain committed to ensuring the conversation stays true to the integrity and purpose of the platform we’ve established.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

In a unique farewell , a 55-year-old man was laid to rest in a Snickers-themed coffin , an idea he had often joked about in life and ensured was included in his will.According to a report from SWNS, Paul Broome , from England, was known for his sharp wit and mischievous sense of humour. His family honoured his final wish by commissioning a custom-made casket resembling the iconic chocolate bar.

Gully To Glory: Ramandeep Singh's journey from Chandigarh to Team India via KKR

Kolkata Knight Riders batter Rinku Singh revealed the significance behind his tattoos during an episode of 'Knight Bite' on Sunday, particularly highlighting the one that reads ""God's Plan, Beautifully Done"" with a clock showing 2:20 - the moment his life transformed when KKR selected him in 2018.""When I was picked by KKR in 2018 for Rs 80 lakhs, that amount was huge for me and my family. We did not have much money before that. My family's life changed completely. My siblings' marriages became easier, and we even bought a house with that money,"" Singh shared.""That is why I got this tattoo with the family written here. It was exactly 2:21 or 2:20 when I was picked, and everything changed from that moment,"" he added while discussing the tattoo that represents his connection with the Kolkata franchise.Singh's initial three years with KKR saw limited playing time, but he emerged in the 2022 season with 174 runs at an average of 34.80 and a strike rate exceeding 148.His career-defining moment came in the 2023 season when he hit five consecutive sixes against Gujarat Titans' Yash Dayal in the final over, successfully chasing 205 runs in Ahmedabad.The 2023 season proved exceptional for Singh as he accumulated 474 runs in 14 matches, maintaining an average of 59.25 and a strike rate of 149.53, including four half-centuries.His performances led to his India debut, and he has since played two ODIs, scoring 55 runs. In T20 internationals, he has amassed 546 runs in 33 matches at an average of 42.00 and a strike rate above 161.Singh was part of India's T20 World Cup-winning squad as a reserve player last year. He later secured his first IPL title with KKR, contributing 168 runs in 11 innings at a strike rate of 148.67.In the current IPL 2025 season, Rinku has scored 61 runs in four matches at an average of 30.50 and a strike rate over 148, with his highest score being 32 not out.His next match is scheduled against Lucknow Super Giants at Eden Gardens, Kolkata, on Tuesday, with KKR currently positioned fifth in the points table after winning two and losing two matches.","Kolkata Knight Riders batter Rinku Singh reveals significance behind his tattoos.

Poll Which Was The Game-Changer In The DC vs CSK Clash? Early Wickets In The Powerplay KL Rahul’s Anchor Knock

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep. 2: GroupM's Vinit Karnik on IPL's growth and emerging sports

NEW DELHI: KL Rahul played a sublime knock under pressure to steer Delhi Capitals to their third straight victory in the Indian Premier League 2025, defeating Chennai Super Kings by 25 runs at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Saturday. With this win, DC not only extended their unbeaten streak this season but also scripted their first win at Chepauk in 15 years.The foundation of Delhi’s 183/6 was built on Rahul’s elegant yet powerful 77 off 51 deliveries. Mixing finesse with brute force, the stylish right-hander struck six boundaries and three sixes, anchoring the innings masterfully. Despite a shaky start — losing Jake Fraser-McGurk early to Khaleel Ahmed — Delhi recovered through Abishek Porel’s brisk 33 off 20 and a steady middle-order partnership between Rahul and Sameer Rizvi (20).While Tristan Stubbs added a quickfire 24 not out at the end, Matheesha Pathirana’s tidy final over ensured CSK restricted DC from posting a bigger total.In reply, CSK stumbled early in their chase. Ruturaj Gaikwad, Rachin Ravindra and Devon Conway fell inside the powerplay, with Mitchell Starc, Mukesh Kumar and young spinner Vipraj Nigam (2/27) denting the top order. At 41/3, CSK were always chasing the game.Vijay Shankar fought hard with a well-made 69 not out, and MS Dhoni remained unbeaten on 30, but the asking rate kept climbing. With the pitch offering grip and Delhi’s bowlers maintaining discipline, Chennai managed only 158/5 in their 20 overs.Earlier, DC captain Axar Patel’s cameo (21 off 14) and his six off Jadeja hinted at a flourish, but he too fell after getting set. Rahul, meanwhile, held one end firmly and reached his 38th IPL fifty in style. His knock not only stabilised DC’s innings but also allowed others to play freely around him.With three wins in three games, Delhi Capitals look like early title contenders. For CSK, however, the loss marks a worrying trend, with questions looming over their inconsistent top order and inability to control games at home.",Delhi Capitals beat Chennai Super Kings by 25 runs at the MA Chidambaram Stadium.

IPL: Fleming admits batting woes after CSK's third straight defeat

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings (CSK) head coach Stephen Fleming has responded sharply to criticism directed at his team on Ravichandran Ashwin’s YouTube channel after their defeat to Delhi Capitals (DC) on Saturday.In a post-match press conference, Fleming appeared surprised when asked about the remarks, admitting he didn’t even know Ashwin had a YouTube channel.The controversy arose after a video featuring former RCB analyst Prasanna Agoram, popularly known as Pdogg, aired on Ashwin’s channel.During the episode, Pdogg questioned CSK's decision to play Afghanistan spinner Noor Ahmad over veterans like Ravindra Jadeja and Ashwin himself. The video was later taken down, sparking curiosity and speculation among fans and the media.When asked about the criticism, Fleming responded with calm dismissal: “I have no idea. I didn’t even know he had a channel, so I don’t follow that stuff. That’s irrelevant.”The incident comes at a tough time for CSK, who suffered their third consecutive loss in IPL 2025 after going down to Delhi Capitals (DC) by 25 runs at Chepauk — their first defeat to DC at home in 15 years.With this victory, DC topped the points table, while CSK find themselves under pressure in the mid-table shuffle.Despite a solid start by DC, thanks to KL Rahul’s composed 77 and some finishing firepower from Tristan Stubbs, CSK faltered in the chase.Star players like Devon Conway, Shivam Dube, and Jadeja failed to convert, while MS Dhoni’s late cameo couldn’t turn the tide.As questions swirl around CSK’s team selection and performance, Fleming’s dismissive stance signals the team’s intent to stay focused on the field -- not the noise off it.",Stephen Fleming responds sharply to criticism directed at his team on Ravichandran Ashwin’s YouTube channel.

NEW DELHI: Skipper Shubman Gill led from the front with a composed unbeaten half-century, while Mohammed Siraj delivered a fiery spell to guide Gujarat Titans to a dominant seven-wicket win over Sunrisers Hyderabad in their IPL 2025 clash at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium on Sunday.Chasing a modest target of 153, Gujarat comfortably crossed the finish line with 20 balls to spare, thanks to Gill’s sublime 61 not out off 43 balls and a blistering cameo by Sherfane Rutherford (35* off 16 balls). However, it was Siraj’s stunning figures of 4/17 that laid the foundation for the victory.Put in to bowl first, the Titans restricted Hyderabad to 152/8. Siraj rattled the SRH top order, removing both openers Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma cheaply. Head (8) was caught at mid-wicket by Sai Sudharsan, while Abhishek holed out to mid-on, continuing SRH’s woes at the top.Siraj returned later to claim two more wickets, finishing with match-winning figures. He was ably supported by R Sai Kishore (2/24) and Prasidh Krishna (2/25), who exploited the sluggish pitch expertly. Despite a 50-run stand between Nitish Kumar Reddy (31) and Heinrich Klaasen (27), SRH never really gained momentum. Both batters fell to Sai Kishore in quick succession, as the hosts collapsed from 105/4.In reply, Gujarat were jolted early as Mohammed Shami and Pat Cummins reduced them to 16/2. B Sai Sudharsan (5) was caught off Shami, while Jos Buttler departed for a duck off Cummins.However, Gill and Washington Sundar , promoted to No. 4, steadied the ship with a crucial 90-run third-wicket stand. Sundar played aggressively, hammering 49 off just 29 balls, including two sixes and four boundaries in a single over from Simarjeet Singh, which released the pressure.Gill reached his fifty in 36 balls, anchoring the chase with poise. Sundar fell just one short of a well-deserved half-century, but Rutherford’s explosive finishing ensured GT wrapped up the win without a hiccup.With this victory, Gujarat Titans climbed to second place on the points table, while Sunrisers Hyderabad languish at the bottom, suffering their fourth loss in five games.",Gujarat Titans beat Sunrisers Hyderabad by seven wickets in IPL 2025 clash.

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep. 2: GroupM's Vinit Karnik on IPL's growth and emerging sports

Once hailed as Indian cricket’s ultimate ‘finisher’, MS Dhoni is under increasing pressure in IPL 2025 after failing to make an impact with the bat for the third consecutive match. Chennai Super Kings , the five-time IPL champions, began their season with a narrow win over Mumbai Indians but have since stumbled with three back-to-back losses while chasing — against Royal Challengers Bengaluru, Rajasthan Royals, and Delhi Capitals — leaving them at ninth place on the points table.Although Dhoni continues to be sharp behind the stumps, his strike rate has seen a significant dip — down to 138.18 from a remarkable 220.55 in the previous season. His inability to find boundaries consistently has been a cause of concern, especially in high-pressure chases.Former Pakistan captain and wicketkeeper Rashid Latif didn’t hold back in his assessment, suggesting Dhoni should have stepped away from the game some time ago.“He should have left a long while back, a wicket-keeper's age is usually 35, I am an example of this. If I was on TV then I am a performer and when I don’t do it at a high level then my reputation will come down. Even if you have done it for 15 years, the younger generations will not be impressed,” Latif said.He further questioned CSK ’s decision to persist with Dhoni, saying: “His playing did not benefit his team in 2019 (ODI World Cup) as well, they should have understood then. If you are choosing the team over one player then it is unfair to the game which is why they are getting trolled.“I saw 2-3 games and the crowd gets very loud but CSK need points right now, they are at the bottom of the table and if the reason is only one or two players then you should realise the need of the hour,” Latif told IANS.Amid swirling speculation over Dhoni’s potential retirement, CSK head coach Stephen Fleming declined to weigh in after the team’s loss to Delhi.“No, that's not my role to put an end to it. I have no idea. I'm just enjoying working with him still. He's still going strong. I don't even ask these days. You are the ones who ask,” Fleming said in the post-match press conference.","MS Dhoni is under increasing pressure in IPL 2025 after failing to make an impact with the bat for the third consecutive match.

NEW DELHI: Sunrisers Hyderabad ’s star openers Abhishek Sharma and Travis Head endured another disappointing outing with the bat, falling cheaply against Gujarat Titans in their IPL 2025 clash at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad.Abhishek, who began aggressively with four crisp boundaries, looked in fine touch, while Head also found the fence twice early on. The duo appeared poised to provide a solid platform for SRH.However, Mohammed Siraj had other plans.The fiery pacer struck early, removing Head in the very first over. Abhishek followed soon after, falling to Siraj in the fifth over, as both openers departed inside the Powerplay.Also See: IPL Live Score, SRH vs GT Their early dismissals didn’t sit well with Sunrisers Hyderabad owner Kavya Maran , who was seen visibly frustrated in the stands, gesturing and murmuring in disappointment.Siraj claimed 4-17 to restrict Sunrisers Hyderabad to 152/8 in 20 overs.Invited to bat first, Travis Head struck two consecutive fours off Siraj before the pacer dismissed him on the final ball of the opening over.Ishan Kishan and Abhishek Sharma struggled to score freely in the powerplay overs as the pair only added 29 runs for the second wicket before the latter was sent back to the pavilion by Siraj in the fifth over.After losing both their openers early, Hyderabad were 45/2 after the end of the powerplay, their second-lowest in nine innings since 2024.Kishan, who had spent a decent time on the crease, couldn't capitalise on the start and was picked by Prasidh Krishna for 17 in the eighth over.Meanwhile, Nitish Kumar Reddy and Heinrich Klaasen gave some respite to Hyderabad's struggling innings as the duo kept on rotating strikes against Rashid Khan and Sai Kishore in the middle overs. The duo amassed a 50-run stand for the fourth wicket before Kishore got the better of both batters in successive overs. Klaasen departed after scoring 27 including a six and two fours while Nitish scored 34-ball 31.Sunrisers Hyderabad's hope for a late flourish in the death overs also hit a blow when Krishna put an end to Kamindu Mendis' (1) five-ball stay at the crease, leaving them for 120/6 after 17 overs.In the next over, Siraj, bowling his final over of the spell, showcased exceptional death bowling skills and clinched the scalps of Aniket Verma (18) and Simarjeet Singh (0) to complete his four-fer.
