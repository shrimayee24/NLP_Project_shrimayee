Hailee Steinfeld flexes her fitness grind in latest photos before Bills’ big year



Hailee Steinfeld embraces balance by letting go of guilt and finding joy in her wellness journey



While Josh Allen ramps up intensity in his second week of training camp with the Buffalo Bills, his wife Hailee Steinfeld is quietly building her own routine — one rooted not in football, but in fitness, mindfulness, and discipline. The Oscar-nominated actress, who stunned fans in three elegant gowns during their wedding weekend at the picturesque San Ysidro Ranch, has been making wellness a personal priority off the red carpet.Even with a demanding schedule, Hailee Steinfeld remains deeply committed to taking care of her body and mind. In her recent Beau Society newsletter, she described emerging from a whirlwind trip to New York City, yet still ensuring her workouts weren’t sacrificed. “I work out to stay fit, but it's almost the last reason I do it anymore,” she wrote candidly. “I love it because it's the only time of day that I can check out entirely. ”Her approach isn't simply about staying camera-ready — it’s about emotional resilience and self-care. The 28-year-old actress, who starred in Sinners, emphasized the mental clarity her workouts provide. “We often work out early so we finish before the rush of the day sets in.But I feel like I've gotten to that place where I move for my mental health.”Her commitment has been supported, both emotionally and physically, by her father Pete Steinfeld — a personal trainer and a key figure in her health journey. In Beau Society’s August 1 issue, titled “The Movement Issue,” Pete was interviewed, offering insight into their shared passion. Hailee wrote, “I never get tired of hearing my dad talk about the thing he loves most in this world: wellbeing.”Hailee Steinfeld also opened up about her past struggles with body image and the guilt that used to accompany indulging in snacks with friends. That mindset has shifted with wisdom and time. “I don't do that anymore because I enjoy sweets and snacks, and the company,” she admitted. But a quote from her father helped anchor this change: “You can't change your body overnight, and you can't mess it up overnight either.”That philosophy — one of balance, consistency, and kindness toward oneself — now defines her outlook. As Josh Allen pursues greatness on the gridiron, Steinfeld is quietly setting her own example of strength: one that doesn’t always show up on a scoreboard, but matters just as much.Also Read: Deion Sanders kept his cancer battle quiet - Brett Favre calls him a true fighter after finding out: ""He's a grinder""","Hailee Steinfeld has been making wellness a personal priority off the red carpet.

For the first time in the history of the event, SummerSlam is a two-night show, and Night 1 saw an audience of 53,161 inside the arena. There were six matches set for the night, and each one had the fans cheering for their favorites.From chants of The OTC to boos for Logan Paul and of course, the main event of the night - CM Punk vs. GUNTHER that everyone was waiting for, the first night of the 38th edition of SummerSlam was a resounding success. With Cardi B hosting the big event, it started off with a bang. And now let's take a look at all the winners and top performers of the night.The opening match of the night was a tag team match between Roman Reigns and Jey Uso , who faced off against Bron Breakker and Bronson Reed. All hell broke loose from the very beginning, as the four opponents were at each other's throats as soon as the bell rang. Reigns missed a chunk of the action at the beginning, before he finally got tagged in. The match ran for over 21 minutes, with Reigns and Uso emerging as the winners.Raquel Rodriguez and Roxanne Perez vs. Charlotte Flair and Alexa Bliss was going to be an explosion of power-packed performance from the very beginning. Bliss and Flair were always the crowd favorite with their reluctant partnership act, and though the Judgment Day duo had a lot of power in them, it wasn't enough to overcome the veterans. The match ended with Charlotte Flair and Alexa Bliss becoming the new WWE Women's Tag Team champions.The first singles match of the night saw Sami Zayn and Karrion Kross come up against each other once again. The tides kept shifting from one side to another for the whole time. And of course, it wouldn't be complete without Scarlett trying to interfere for her partner, this time with a steel pipe, and then distracting the referee. But in this match-up, Zayn managed to take the win over Kross once again after a Helluva Kick to his opponent. Tiffany Stratton vs. Jade Cargill was the shortest match of the night, running for just a little over seven minutes. But both women kept the momentum of the night going with their powerful performances. The current Queen of the Ring challenged Stratton for her title belt, who has yet to lose a match this year. And Stratton showed Cargill why she is the reigning champion, as she managed to retain her belt after yet another title defense.This fight began even before the bell rang, when Logan Paul punched Jelly Roll, leading to a heated exchange between all four wrestlers. The fight was heated, with each one of them trying to gain the upper hand. Roll was almost led off the stage by officials after a splash by Paul turned way too much for the celebrity wrestler. But he came in to help his partner, Randy Orton . Unfortunately, it didn't work for long, and a Claymore Kick from Drew McIntyre and a Fall From Grace frogsplash from Paul, the match ended with Roll taking the pin.The main event of SummerSlam Night 1 saw CM Punk and GUNTHER come face to face for the third title match of the night. With the World Heavyweight Championship title on the line, GUNTHER was not going to have Punk take it away from him that easily. The match continued for more than 30 minutes before CM Punk finally emerged as the winner and the new World Heavyweight Champion of WWE.His emotions after getting the title belt and the tears spoke more than any words could. But the night is yet to end, as Seth Rollins walks in with Paul Heyman, who still has his Money in the Bank briefcase. But Rollins is injured, right? Well, not anymore, as he rushes in after throwing away his crutches and taking off his leg brace, and finally cashes in his MITB briefcase.It was too easy to pin an exhausted Punk, and ladies and gentlemen, Seth Rollins is now the newest World Heavyweight Champion of WWE. The Ruse of the Century indeed. Paul Heyman looks ecstatic, and that's curtains for Night 1 of SummerSlam 2025.Also Read: WWE SummerSlam 2025 (August 02, 2025) Results: Seth Rollins destroys CM Punk's dreams pulling huge ruse to win the World title","Night 1 of WWE SummerSlam 2025, held at the MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey saw an electric crowd.

In what stretched over 30 minutes, the main event between CM Punk and Gunther for the World Heavyweight Championship delivered big time. Moreover, ‘The Best in the World’ clinched his first world title in over 12 years in the WWE . However, that celebration did not last long as a returning Seth Rollins pulled off yet another heist of the century to capture the crown after cashing in his Money in the Bank contract on a battered Punk right after his hellacious war with the Austrian juggernaut. Talk about being the ultimate party popper!For those unaware, Rollins reportedly injured his right knee during a match against LA Knight at Saturday Night’s Main Event. While attempting a Lion sault off the second rope, Rollins landed awkwardly on his feet and immediately clutched his leg in visible pain. He quickly retreated to the corner, where he spoke with the referee, Paul Heyman, and the ringside doctor.An improvised finish followed, and Knight capitalized, picking up the win with a BFT moments later. In the days that followed, Rollins was seen wearing a knee brace at Evolution 2, and Triple H even gave a bleak update on his condition. But as it turns out, it was all part of a grand deception.As Punk struggled to recover after his grueling match, the arena exploded when Rollins’ music hit, sending a jolt through the crowd. Still appearing on crutches, it seemed the threat was minimal. But in a jaw-dropping twist, ‘The Visionary’ tossed the crutches aside, sprinted down the ramp with his Money in the Bank briefcase, and targeted a stunned Punk.Wasting no time, Rollins cashed in his contract on the war-torn Punk.A flurry of trademark offense followed, ending with brutal shots from the briefcase and a devastating stomp. Seconds later, the referee counted three, and just like that, Rollins was the new World Heavyweight Champion.The shocking moment drew instant comparisons to his unforgettable “Heist of the Century” at WrestleMania 31, once again proving that when the stakes are sky-high, Seth Rollins always finds a way to steal the spotlight.Apart from the Rollins shocker, Punk and Gunther stole the show in an instant classic. Gunther dominated early with powerful strikes and submission attempts, nearly finishing Punk multiple times. Punk showed resilience, countering a sharpshooter into a Figure Four and surviving a series of punishing powerbombs, lariats, and a top-rope frog splash.After a brutal fall through the announce table left Gunther bloodied, Punk mounted a comeback. He unloaded a flurry of offense with punches, a running knee, a clothesline, and an elbow drop. Gunther then locked in a sleeper, but Punk broke free, hit a GTS that barely fazed Gunther, then delivered a second to finally put him away.Also read: WWE SummerSlam 2025 Night 1 Quick Highlights: List of All Winners, Top Performers, and More In a hard-fought battle, Punk overcame the odds, dethroned the dominant Gunther, and reasserted himself as the top star on Raw.

Connor McDavid’s next deal could be historic, but it comes with conditions



Loyalty now, but exit still on the table



FAQs:



1. Why were Connor McDavid's contract talks delayed?

2. Is Connor McDavid committed to staying in Edmonton long-term?

3. What makes Connor McDavid’s next contract so significant?

After weeks of mounting speculation, Connor McDavid is reportedly ready to open contract discussions with the Edmonton Oilers. This long-anticipated move comes after a brief silence that sparked rumors of a possible exit. However, recent developments suggest the franchise’s cornerstone is still committed - for now. The reigning best player in the NHL may stay loyal to Edmonton, but the fine print of his next deal could shape the future of both McDavid and the team.Connor McDavid isn’t just negotiating any contract- he’s expected to ink a deal that would make him the highest-paid player in NHL history. NHL insider Frank Seravalli weighed in, noting, “I don’t think $20 million is unreasonable given what he provides and how significant of an impact he has as the best player in the world. If I were looking at the Connor McDavid situation, as best I can handicap it at this point in time, my guess is somewhere between $16 and $17.5 million in AAV. Those are just ballparks. That’s the best that I can glean at this moment in time.” Seravalli estimates the ballpark figure to be between $16 million and $17.5 million in average annual value (AAV).Yet, despite the optimism surrounding a massive contract, it’s not just about the money.McDavid is likely weighing more than just figures—he’s considering legacy. The Oilers have repeatedly fallen short of lifting the Stanley Cup, including a bitter playoff exit to the Florida Panthers last season. If that trend continues, the superstar’s patience might wear thin.While rumors about Connor McDavid potentially heading to the Toronto Maple Leafs made waves recently, those talks have cooled. He remains expected to sign an extension with Edmonton. However, Seravalli provided a warning rooted in McDavid’s immense leverage: “If he decides after four years or three years or whatever that the Edmonton Oilers aren’t getting it done...the best player in the world just raises his hand and says: ‘I want out. ’”This isn’t just hypothetical. McDavid has been eligible to extend his contract since July 1, but personal matters reportedly delayed the process. Now, discussions are finally set to commence—but for how long will Edmonton be enough? The specter of a late-career switch, especially to his hometown Maple Leafs, still looms.The Oilers need more than just a signature. They need to prove to McDavid that Edmonton is where champions are made. Because if the promise of the Stanley Cup continues to fade, even the most loyal star might look elsewhere for glory. However, no matter to what extent trade rumors appear, it is Connor McDavid, who will decide his future. Will he become the highest paid player in league? Fans and critics will be watching very closely.Contract discussions were delayed due to personal matters, but they are now expected to begin soon.He is expected to sign an extension, but could leave if the Oilers fail to deliver results in the coming years.His upcoming deal is projected to make him the highest-paid player in NHL history, reflecting his elite impact on the game.Also Read: Without Mitch Marner, can Auston Matthews still carry the Maple Leafs to a Stanley Cup?","Connor McDavid is reportedly ready to open contract discussions with the Edmonton Oilers.

Trade demand from Micah Parsons met with strong six-word response from Jerry Jones



What happens next for Dallas and their star defender?



The Dallas Cowboys are once again the center of offseason chaos, and this time, it’s their defensive star, Micah Parsons, stirring the storm. Amid ongoing frustration over stalled contract talks, the two-time All-Pro linebacker formally requested a trade—sending a clear message that patience has run out. But just as quickly, team owner Jerry Jones stepped in to calm the rising tension, insisting there’s no reason to panic.When Parsons released a strongly worded statement on Friday—publicly acknowledging a March meeting with Jones that pivoted from leadership to contract talk—things got real. He noted that while he deferred discussions to his agent, the Cowboys had failed to respond with any negotiations. That, it seems, was the breaking point.“I would say to our fans, don’t lose any sleep over this,” Jones told reporters at training camp on Saturday, via Nick Harris of the Star-Telegram. His response, though brief, was aimed at cooling the emotional wave sweeping Cowboys Nation. Jones doubled down, saying he still isn’t considering a trade, despite the very public fallout.What’s unfolding is not unfamiliar territory in the NFL . Trade demands have become a modern leverage tactic, especially for elite players wanting long-term security.But for Cowboys fans, the revolving door of media spectacles can feel like a never-ending carousel.Parsons isn’t just any player either—he’s the cornerstone of the Cowboys' defense. With 52.5 career sacks in four seasons and a league-tied fifth-best 12 sacks last year, his production is nothing short of elite. Losing a player of his caliber isn’t an option, and Jones knows it.Although Jones insists there's no cause for concern, the fact remains that Parsons has officially put the team on notice. And while Jones pointed out, “Micah took it off the table” when asked about the March discussion, the clock is now ticking louder than ever.If recent NFL history is any guide, this story likely ends with Parsons getting the massive deal he desires. But until ink meets paper, fans might find it hard to sleep easy—despite Jones’ reassuring words. The Cowboys may not be trading Parsons, but the tension? That’s here to stay.Also Read: Josh Allen ditches Tom Brady’s mindset as he embraces Hailee Steinfeld and a family-first lifestyle","Dallas Cowboys linebacker Micah Parsons formally requested a trade on Friday.

When the NFL season returns, the spotlight will inevitably land on Josh Allen. But this time, the Buffalo Bills quarterback isn’t interested in being the next Tom Brady—or being trapped by the same win-at-all-costs narrative. As expectations mount for a Bills team still searching for its first Super Bowl, Allen is rewriting what success looks like—and it starts with finding happiness off the field.I n a revealing conversation with CBS Sports, Allen opened up about how his personal and professional outlook has evolved. Surprisingly, it wasn’t a football legend who sparked this change—it was golf's world number one, Scottie Scheffler.""Scottie Scheffler had that really good interview before The Open that spoke a lot to me, and I really appreciate him sharing those words,"" Allen shared. Scheffler’s perspective—that life outside the game matters more than the trophies—hit home for Allen, who admitted he’s often wrestled with the emotional rollercoaster of professional sports.""It's maddening,"" Allen said of the effort-versus-results paradox in the NFL.""But at the same time, it helps put things in perspective about what matters in your life, and you figure out what that is fairly quickly.""That clarity has helped Allen detach from fleeting accolades. Whether it's an MVP award or a historic playoff run, he’s learned not to measure self-worth by what’s handed out on stage.""It's kind of crazy where you're coming out here and doing everything you can for a quick enjoyment of it, and then you're on to the next,"" he explained. ""It's like the MVP award. I don't look back and think about that night... I'm so moved on to trying to help this team win football games this year.""Allen’s evolved philosophy is already resonating in the Bills' locker room. Rather than focusing solely on the elusive Super Bowl title, he's fostering a culture centered around camaraderie and commitment.""For sure, and going out there and playing free, and the main thing we always preach here is playing for each other and putting your best stuff out there,"" Allen emphasized.His mindset doesn’t mean the fire to win is gone—it means the journey matters just as much as the destination. Allen understands that the true victory lies in building relationships, lifting teammates, and enjoying every step, regardless of the scoreboard.And maybe, just maybe, that’s how lasting legacies are really made.Also Read: Hailee Steinfeld's latest workout photos break the internet as Josh Allen returns to Bills camp","Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen wants to create a legacy that values people over pressure.

Over the past year, he’s faced a wave of online criticism — not for his performance, but for always having his mom, Regina Jackson, by his side. While some call it overprotective, Daniels sees something else entirely: unconditional love. And rather than distance himself, he’s standing tall beside her — not just as her son, but as a grown man who knows the value of her presence.While social media trolls continue to poke fun at Regina Jackson’s ever-present role in Daniels’ life — including viral moments like her third-wheeling on a dinner date or the now-famous Juju Watkins “vibe-killer” episode — Daniels doesn’t see her involvement as intrusive. He sees it as essential.“She’s a mom first. She’s always going to be there to uplift me. But if I’m doing wrong, she’s going to let me know. So, even though I’m 24 years old, I’m still a grown man, but I still gotta listen to my mom at some point,” Daniels said in an interview with the NFL Network.Rather than resenting her vigilance, Daniels appreciates it. Regina knows the risks that come with being a rising NFL star — from unwanted attention to possible exploitation — and she’s not about to sit back and watch her son be vulnerable.The criticism labeling her as a “helicopter parent” only underscores the double standards placed on protective mothers in the public eye.And while internet comedians have their laughs, Daniels continues to grow both as a player and a person, rooted in the firm guidance of his mother.Regina Jackson wasn’t just present during the interview — she was beaming nearby, proud of the man her son has become. “I’m very proud of him. The athlete, and the man you guys see… You always need your mommas around,” she said, capturing what many often forget — family is often the cornerstone of greatness.Research supports the value of this kind of parent-child bond. Sons raised with emotional support from their mothers often exhibit stronger decision-making, healthier relationships, and better mental health. Daniels is a living testament to that. Calm under pressure, focused, and respectful, he’s proving that emotional security isn't a liability — it's a competitive edge.In a world quick to judge, Daniels reminds us that sometimes, strength comes from knowing who you can always count on — even if it’s your mom sitting beside you during dinner.Also Read: Hailee Steinfeld's latest workout photos break the internet as Josh Allen returns to Bills camp","Jayden Daniels has faced criticism for always having his mom, Regina Jackson, by his side.

Ciara and Russell Wilson share playful argument on podcast that fans can’t stop talking about

Power couple gives back with second 'Why Not You' Center opening in Atlanta

NFL star Russell Wilson and Grammy-winning singer Ciara continue to show fans that their bond goes far beyond fame and red carpets. From tender moments to philanthropic milestones, the couple has become a beacon of love, laughter, and purpose. Their most recent lighthearted exchange—caught during Ciara’s appearance on the Pour Minds podcast—offers a glimpse into their endearing chemistry.While discussing relationship dynamics on Pour Minds, Ciara was interrupted mid-chat by a phone call from none other than her husband, Russell Wilson. A podcast staffer jokingly announced, “Sorry ladies, I was told to tell you, daddy’s calling,” prompting laughter.Without hesitation, Ciara answered and told Russ, “Hi baby! She was talking about when we argue, I get quiet.” To which Wilson playfully responded, “And I get loud.” The candid exchange left listeners swooning and laughing, reinforcing their reputation as one of the NFL’s most relatable couples.Ciara also recalled their first meeting at a 2015 University of Wisconsin basketball game: “He was talking to me, and the words were going over my head.I was like, oh my gosh, he’s so beautiful.” That moment, she said, felt divinely orchestrated: “Like, that was God.”Beyond the playful banter, the couple is deeply committed to giving back. In late July, they opened their second Why Not You Center in Atlanta in partnership with Boys & Girls Clubs. The center aims to empower underserved youth through wellness, arts, education, and cultural programs.“We’re doing it,” Ciara posted on Instagram, alongside a heartfelt video capturing the opening. Their first center launched earlier this year in Pittsburgh, aligning with the foundation’s mission to “empower today’s youth to lead with a why not you attitude.”Also Read: ""We are on a mission"": Ciara and Russell Wilson launch Atlanta initiative, tease next big move in New York Whether through fun-loving podcast moments or life-changing initiatives, Russell and Ciara continue proving they’re not just a power couple in sports and music—but in purpose, too.","Ciara and Russell Wilson share playful argument on podcast that fans can’t stop talking about.

Angela Price breaks silence on Sydney Sweeney’s ‘good jeans’ ad backlash

Angela defends American Eagle’s history of diversity



Angela Price, wife of NHL star Carey Price, is weighing in on the backlash surrounding Sydney Sweeney’s American Eagle ad. As critics slam the campaign for promoting unrealistic beauty standards, Angela offers a grounded take—calling Sweeney “incredibly attractive” and defending the brand’s history of inclusivity from her own personal experience.Carey Price’s wife, Angela Price, isn’t one to shy away from hot-button topics—and her latest Instagram Q&A proves just that. As social media continues to debate Sydney Sweeney’s American Eagle billboard that plays on the phrase “good jeans” (a pun that critics say sexualizes and objectifies the actress), Angela chimed in with her own surprisingly grounded take.“When I first saw it, I thought, ‘Yeah, she definitely has great genes because she’s incredibly attractive,’” Angela wrote. “But hey, that’s just my two cents from someone who likes to keep it real and sensible.”Angela’s response stood out for its calm, measured tone at a time when the ad has become a cultural flashpoint. Critics claim it sends the wrong message by focusing too heavily on appearance and idealized beauty standards. Others have even called it racially insensitive. But Angela—who used to work with American Eagle herself—pushed back on that narrative.“I have a soft spot for the AE brand; I spent a good part of my youth working with them,” she said. “If you check out their past ads, they showcase people of all shapes, sizes, ethnicities, and support diverse groups.”That quiet endorsement of the brand comes amid a social media firestorm, where people are accusing American Eagle of promoting a narrow definition of beauty. The brand, however, maintains the ad was never about anything other than denim: “Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans” is and always was about the jeans. Her jeans.

Nazem Kadri reacts to being erased from Hockey Canada ’s Olympic invite list

At 34 years old, veteran forward Nazem Kadri was baffled by his snub from Team Canada's 92-player orientation camp for the 2026 Winter Olympics. The exclusion of the Stanley Cup champion, who has garnered 710 points in 985 NHL games over 16 seasons, has provoked spirited commentary, especially since the list includes several younger players.Nazem Kadri's recent career challenges extend beyond his professional disappointment. The veteran hockey center, a Stanley Cup champion with the Colorado Avalanche, now faces the twin hurdles of being overlooked for a national team opportunity and combating his team's struggles.The announcement of Canada's massive 92-player roster for the Olympic camp was an event to celebrate for many, including Sidney Crosby, who was among the first six players named to the team. “I know how much pride comes with wearing the Maple Leaf on the international stage,” he uttered, expressing his excitement.The decision by Hockey Canada to leave Kadri off the list for their August camp has sensibly left him stunned. The news was disclosed to the public through an Instagram post from TSN, which shared that “Hockey Canada has invited 92 players from its men’s, women’s and para hockey teams to attend its National Teams Orientation Camp, set for Aug.26-28 in Calgary.”Kadri's visible confusion was made clear when he commented “???” on the post. His bafflement is justified, as he has a Stanley Cup victory and several high-scoring seasons to his name. His dismissal is particularly complicating given that the list includes multiple players who have yet to win the trophy.This snub adds to the existing pressures on the Calgary Flames star, who is also currently the subject of several trade rumors, with potential moves to teams like the Montreal Canadiens or New Jersey Devils being speculated.Also Read: Connor McDavid to the Maple Leafs?

Anaheim Ducks TRADING Mason McTavish To The Montreal Canadiens? | NHL Trade Rumours

Canadiens need a solution, and Mason McTavish fits the mold



The NHL offseason buzz has taken a sharp turn toward Anaheim Ducks center Mason McTavish. With trade talks heating up, the 22-year-old forward’s name has increasingly surfaced as a prime target, and few destinations make more sense than the Montreal Canadiens. A playoff return in 2025 reignited belief in Montreal, but to keep pace, the team knows it must address lingering holes, especially down the middle.Selected third overall in 2021, McTavish had his breakout moment last season. His stat line—22 goals and 52 points in 76 games—was not just impressive, but also a sign of what’s to come. He logged a career-high average ice time of 16:52, carrying top-six responsibilities with poise. And yet, despite Anaheim holding over $21 million in cap space, McTavish remains unsigned as a restricted free agent, opening the door for trade speculation.""I am not sure if he will move eventually, but I am very curious to see what happens with Mason McTavish with the Anaheim Ducks,"" shared Daily Faceoff’s Anthony DiMarco. “If there is an eventual path to McTavish being moved, you can be sure that there will be no shortage of teams waiting in line to inquire about his services.”Anaheim GM Pat Verbeek has already been busy reshaping his roster, including dealing veteran goaltender John Gibson. His push to reach the Stanley Cup Playoffs in 2026 could spark a “hockey trade”—moving a young piece like McTavish to bring back immediate-impact talent.Montreal, meanwhile, is seeking stability behind captain Nick Suzuki. While Suzuki enjoyed a breakout campaign (30 goals, 59 assists), the drop-off behind him at center has been glaring. According to The Fourth Period’s David Pagnotta, the Canadiens are one of four teams seriously interested in McTavish—and it’s clear why.The Ontario native not only outproduced every other Canadiens center not named Suzuki, but he also carried more responsibility and showed signs of elite upside. Adding McTavish would instantly give Montreal a foundation for the future—a one-two punch of Suzuki and McTavish that could anchor the franchise for the next decade.Financially, the Canadiens are in a strong position to make it happen. A $7–8 million deal fits within their cap space, and trade assets like Patrick Laine or Mike Matheson could be enough to make the trade work.If Montreal truly aims to cement itself as a long-term contender, pulling the trigger on McTavish may not just be a smart move— it might be essential.Also Read: Edmonton Oilers consider major trade while Connor McDavid’s contract clock continues to tick","Montreal Canadiens eye Mason McTavish in bid to build a formidable one-two center punch.

“Foregone Conclusion”—But Pressure Comes Next

Praise for Luka’s Offseason Shape—But a Warning Follows

A New Chapter in Lakers Leadership

’s three-year, $165 million extension with thesent shockwaves through the NBA world. But few reactions were as compelling—or as critical—as that of ESPN’s. Known for his sharp opinions and no-nonsense delivery, Smith offered a nuanced take on the Lakers’ decision to secure their future around the 25-year-old Slovenian star. Stephen A. Smith began by saying the extension was hardly a surprise. “I think it was a foregone conclusion. I think anybody with sense knew it was going to come down to this,” he stated, pointing to the allure of the Lakers’ legacy and the inevitability of locking in a superstar like Luka Doncic long-term. From Smith’s perspective, the Lakers made the obvious choice to build their post-LeBron James era around a generational talent. For Doncic, it’s an opportunity to step onto a global stage few franchises can offer.Yet, Stephen A. Smith was quick to caution that this extension comes with sky-high expectations. Wearing the purple and gold, he said, is about more than talent—it’s about meeting the weight of legacy.Stephen A. gave credit where it’s due, acknowledging Luka Doncic ’s improved fitness.“When you see him having lost this weight, you get excited,” he said. A leaner Luka brings not just better mobility, but the potential for increased defensive presence and off-ball movement.Still, Stephen A. Smith wasn’t letting go of his signature skepticism: “There’s a difference between getting in shape in the offseason and staying in shape during the season… That’s where it’s going to really, really show.”He emphasized that Luka Doncic’s ability to sustain this transformation over the full NBA grind remains unproven. The Hollywood appearances and magazine spreads may draw attention, but the real test will be consistency—something Smith feels Doncic hasn’t mastered yet.Beyond the stats, Smith’s focus shifted to leadership and legacy. He reminded fans that being a Laker comes with intense media attention and constant comparisons to legends of the past. It’s a stage that amplifies both greatness and shortcomings.Luka Doncic, Stephen A. Smith said, must now grow as a leader. This extension isn’t just about points and highlights—it’s about stepping into a role that demands responsibility, vocal leadership, and the maturity to guide a team through the highs and lows of a season.Stephen A. Smith’s reaction to Luka Doncic’s contract extension strikes a familiar balance: enthusiasm tempered with realism. While he sees tremendous potential in the deal, he’s clear that the Lakers’ gamble on Doncic will only pay off if the star embraces everything that comes with the jersey—from conditioning and defense to leadership and championship expectations.Also read: Rob Pelinka Reflects on Luka Doncic Trade and Contract Extension: A Franchise-Defining Gamble That Paid Off “Let’s see what the brother does now,” Smith concluded.

Why Reaves Could Be on the Block

Factors Supporting a Potential Trade

As Luka Doncic gears up for his first full season with the, the franchise appears poised to make bold decisions in pursuit of an 18th NBA title. One of those decisions could involve parting ways with rising star Austin Reaves.The 26-year-old Doncic has quickly become the centerpiece of the Lakers’ future, and his influence was evident in the team’s major offseason moves. His presence played a key role in landing both Marcus Smart and Deandre Ayton - two players expected to play significant roles in the 2025–26 campaign.Now, with a win-now mindset guiding the franchise, the Lakers are evaluating every asset on their roster. That includes 26-year-old Austin Reaves, who, despite deliveringhis best season yet, may not fit seamlessly alongside Doncic in the long run.Reaves averaged a career-high in nearly every major statistical category last season, emerging as a fringe All-Star.However, his evolution into a ball-dominant tertiary option has occasionally taken possessions away from Doncic - an issue that could grow as the team solidifies its identity around the Slovenian star.Maxwell Ogden of FanSided argued that Reaves’ development may soon become a luxury the Lakers can no longer afford: “If Reaves can’t take the next step and justify the nine-figure contract he’s likely to sign in 2026, then the Lakers need to trade him by the February deadline,” Ogden wrote.“It’s unfair on some levels, but Doncic is looking to win now, and Reaves is their most tradable asset.”Despite being undrafted, Reaves has elevated his game to the verge of All-Star status. Yet, his skill set - while impressive - is starting to overlap with Doncic’s responsibilities as the primary initiator.• Redundant Play Styles: Both Reaves and Doncic operate best with the ball in their hands.• Future Contract Concerns: Reaves is expected to command a nine-figure extension by 2026.• Roster Flexibility: Trading Reaves could help the Lakers acquire a better stylistic fit or multiple rotational pieces.• Doncic’s Timeline: Every move now hinges on delivering a title while Doncic is in his prime.Ogden emphasized that Reaves’ value might be the key to fulfilling Doncic’s expectations: “Reaves is the player and contract who will ultimately decide if the Lakers can honor Doncic’s request to win now.”Reaves may have more room to blossom as a lead guard elsewhere, potentially even earning an All-Star nod on a team built around him. For the Lakers, though, the priority is clear: build the best possible supporting cast around Doncic. And that might mean making tough calls - even if it involves letting go of a fan favorite and breakout performer.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors Potentially Eyeing $3,303,711 Charlotte Hornets Star as Potential Backcourt Addition As February’s trade deadline approaches, all eyes will be on Los Angeles to see whether the franchise pulls the trigger on a deal that could define their championship trajectory.","Austin Reaves averaged a career-high in nearly every major statistical category last season.

The landmark came during Day 3 of the fifth and final Test against England at The Oval, as Jadeja continued his prolific run with the bat in the series.The 36-year-old surpassed the previous Indian record of 474 runs at that position, held by VVS Laxman against West Indies in 2002.

Yashasvi Jaiswal press conference: Message from Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli help, support from Gambhir

Poll Who do you think will win the final Test at The Oval? India England It's too close to call I don't follow cricket

The fifth and final Test at The Oval between India and England saw its share of tension, drama, and viral moments. One such moment came late on Day 3 when Zak Crawley once again tried to disrupt rhythm: only this time, Shubman Gill wasn’t biting.During the 13th over of England's chase of 374, Crawley was seen backing away as Mohammed Siraj charged in, attempting to delay the bowler's momentum.On one such occasion, Shubman Gill, standing in the slip cordon, offered only a sly smile, markedly different from his fiery reaction earlier in the series when he had told Crawley to ""grow some f***ing balls"" on the stump mic for similar antics during the Lord's Test.This time, Gill didn’t rise to the bait. But Siraj had the perfect response three balls later.Watch:On the final delivery of the day, Siraj pulled off a stunning setup.After planting the idea of a short ball with the field, he unleashed a late, dipping yorker that snuck under Crawley’s bat and shattered his stumps.Crawley was completely undone, his footwork static, his reaction too late. Siraj’s celebration was emphatic, arms wide and roaring toward the dressing room.A big breakthrough just before stumps.It was a vital strike, as England had cautiously moved to 50 without loss before that wicket. Crawley departed for 14 off 36 balls, with two boundaries, while Ben Duckett remained unbeaten on 34.Earlier in the day, India posted a commanding 396 in their second innings, with Yashasvi Jaiswal scoring a fluent 118. Akash Deep’s unexpected 66 and solid fifties from Jadeja and Sundar helped India set England a daunting target of 374.At stumps on Day 3, England still need 324 runs with eight wickets in hand; and without injured Chris Woakes, who is unable to bat, the task has become significantly steeper.","Zak Crawley was bowled by Mohammed Siraj in the 13th over of England's chase of 374.

England (Playing XI):

England's veteran batter Joe Root added another major milestone to his incredible Test career on Day 2 of the fifth Test against India at The Oval. With his 29-run knock, Root went past Sachin Tendulkar to become the third-highest run-scorer in home Tests.Root now has 7,220 runs in England, surpassing Tendulkar’s 7,216 runs in India. Only Ricky Ponting (7,578 in Australia) and Mahela Jayawardene (7,167 in Sri Lanka) remain ahead of Root among the top home Test run-scorers.The former England captain also crossed 2,000 Test runs against India at home, joining an elite list. Only Don Bradman has more runs against a single opponent in home Tests — 2,354 against England. Root’s consistent run-scoring against India continues to be a major factor in this long-standing rivalry.However, his stay on Friday was cut short by Mohammed Siraj in the 33rd over. Root, who looked in control for much of his innings, was dismissed for 29. Siraj bowled a fuller delivery that straightened slightly, sneaking past Root’s inside edge to crash into the stumps.At the time of his dismissal, England were 175/4 in 33 overs, still trailing India’s first-innings total of 224.Root’s brief knock still had enough impact to push him above some of the game's greats.Yashasvi Jaiswal, KL Rahul, Sai Sudharsan, Shubman Gill(c), Karun Nair, Ravindra Jadeja, Dhruv Jurel(w), Washington Sundar, Akash Deep, Prasidh Krishna, Mohammed SirajZak Crawley, Ben Duckett, Ollie Pope(c), Joe Root, Harry Brook, Jacob Bethell, Jamie Smith(w), Chris Woakes, Gus Atkinson, Jamie Overton, Josh Tongue","Joe Root becomes third-highest run-scorer in home Tests with 7,220 runs in England.

Poll How confident are you in CSK's chances for IPL 2026 after the mini-revival? Very confident Somewhat confident Not confident at all

Five-time IPL champions Chennai Super Kings find themselves in unfamiliar territory after failing to make the playoffs in back-to-back seasons for the first time.CSK made a torrid start to their IPL 2025 campaign before three mid-season injury replacements – Ayush Mhatre, Dewald Brevis and Urvil Patel – showed that there is light at the end of the tunnel. The mini-revival towards the end of the season has provided optimism to former captain MS Dhoni, who remarked that the Super Kings batting line-up is “sorted” for the next edition.“I would not say that we slacked off but there were certain holes that we needed to plug. In the second half of the tournament, we were worried about our batting order; you know that people do bat at different positions. But I think that our batting order is quite sorted now,” Dhoni said at an event organised by Maxivision Super Speciality Eye Hospital here on Saturday. While CSK have the option to retain Ayush, Brevis and Urvil, they will welcome back regular skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad after missing him for a majority of IPL 2025 due to injury.“Rutu will be coming back, so we are quite sorted. A small (mini) auction will be coming up in December. There are some holes and we will try to plug those. We have to be at our best at the start of the tournament and use the resources in the best possible manner,” added Dhoni, the captain who led them to each of their five IPL trophies.While the 44-year-old did not disclose whether he will return as a player next season, Dhoni, on a lighter note, said that he has been told his eyes are good enough to play competitive cricket for five more years.“I just got a tick mark that I can play cricket for the next five years. But the catch is that I have been given clearance only for eyesight. I need clearance for my body as well. I cannot play cricket just with my eyes (laughs).”Dhoni also stressed that CSK cannot rely on past glory.“You always have to be at your best. It is not about what you have done in the past 15 or 16 years. The next year you turn up again, you have to start from there. Nobody respects what you did in the past,” said Dhoni.","CSK made a torrid start to their IPL 2025 campaign before three mid-season injury replacements – Ayush Mhatre, Dewald Brevis and Urvil Patel.

Poll Do you believe that representation of women in sports is important? Absolutely! Somewhat important. Not really.

Having just signed for Greek basketball club Esperides Kallitheas, Harsimran ‘Honey’ Kaur Dhami is set to become the first Indian female to play professional basketball in Europe. In a sport where statistics make for hot discussion, she must like the sound of that stat.“I mean, who wouldn’t?” she replies with a chuckle in a telephonic chat with TOI . “Like, it’s definitely great to hear. I always wanted to do that. But at the same time, it’s a lot of pressure to kind of carry because you’re really just representing your whole country. I wouldn’t want anyone else to have that pressure but me, I think that’s definitely just all the work that I put in.”Pressure, however, is something the 22-year-old Honey has learnt to accept over the years. It’s something she was trained, and trained hard to endure by a father, who, in her own words, didn’t treat her “like a daughter”, right from her introduction to basketball as a 7-year-old.“Growing up in the small town Kapurthala in Punjab, there was not really a woman’s team anywhere. So it’s just watching my dad every day, because he used to play basketball.So he would go to practice every day and I would just go with him, stand by the pool and just watch him play.”Considering it to be a “weird game” at first, curiosity got the better of the innocent 7-year-old girl and she soon prodded her father, and asked if she could join him and his group. It was not exactly an ideal beginning. “I’m playing with these 40-yearold, 35-year old dudes and they’re like beating me up and I’m thinking, ‘this is not for me, what is this? what am I doing’? And my dad would go, ‘just put the ball in the hoop’.It was simply the first of many sporting lessons Sukhdev Singh Dhami would go on to teach his daughter.Excited as she is about starting a new chapter of this inspiring story in Greece, Honey remains in pursuit of a bigger goal.“The job is not done yet. Like, I haven’t touched the WNBA yet. I know it’s a big deal to be Europe’s first Indian female player, but I think it would be an even, even, even, even bigger deal if I became the first Indian to ever play WNBA.”",Harsimran ‘Honey’ Kaur Dhami is set to become the first Indian female to play professional basketball in Europe.

India vs England, 5th Test Day 3: Why Shubman Gill holds key, Jazball vs Bazball!

‘Full of admiration for Root’

Poll Do you believe Shubman Gill is a future superstar of cricket? Yes, absolutely! Maybe, time will tell. No, he won't reach that level.

‘Excited and looking forward to The Hundred’

(Watch The Hundred 2025 (Men’s) — London Spirit vs Oval Invincibles on August 5, 2025 from 11pm IST live on Sony Sports Ten 1 SD & HD.

Taking on the responsibility of captaincy for the first time can weigh heavily on any young cricketer, but Shubman Gill has embraced the role with composure and let his bat do the talking, feels New Zealand batting talisman Kane Williamson Without showing signs of pressure, Gill has led from the front, piling on runs in the ongoing India-England series and proving his class yet again. “Shubman is an incredible, world-class player, as he has shown in this series. It has been great to see him go out and play well. He is already a superstar and is going to be there for some time, doing some incredible things in the game,” Williamson, who will lead London Spirit in ‘The Hundred’, told TOI .Taking over the No. 4 spot from Virat Kohli is not an easy task. yet Gill seems to have stepped into that role with confidence. “On most occasions, when he walks out to the crease, filling the shoes of Virat is not something that can be done. But Shubman is someone who paves his own way and has his own style. He has a huge amount of belief in his ability and what he can do,” Williamson added.While the No. 4 spot has been firmly established, the No.3 position continues to be a work in progress. Sai Sudharsan and Karun Nair have had limited opportunities there but are yet to cement their place. “I have seen more of Sai Sudarshan in the IPL. He is an amazing player. We see how he adjusts his game to different formats. He has a wonderful technique and a great temperament. He is a real student of the game. It is great to see him get that exposure at the Test level and it is one of the most challenging places to play. I think it is going to be amazing for his game and himself moving forward as a player.“Karun is obviously a real quality player. There are always these sorts of decisions you have to make at the international level when there are so many talented players.” Joe Root is steadily closing in on Sachin Tendulkar’s alltime record for the highest Test runs, showcasing remarkable consistency throughout his career. “It is an incredible achievement, what he has done in the game to date. Let alone the opportunity to become the all-time run-scorer — longevity, consistency, not just consistency but consistently being the best. He has managed to maintain that level for so long. Not only that, he has done it in a way that has always been about the team. Full of admiration for the way he does it,” Williamson said.Williamson will be playing in The Hundred for the first time. London Spirit failed to progress to the playoff stage in the previous two editions but the addition of Williamson could help change their fortunes. “I’m excited and looking forward to the tournament. We have a strong squad like the other teams. We have a number of players in the England Test side, and they have been quite busy. The team has joined up today (Saturday) and we will start the preparations. ”","Shubman Gill has led from the front in the ongoing India-England series.

Cricket fans at The Oval witnessed a lighthearted moment on Day 3 of the fifth and final Test between India and England when Ravindra Jadeja politely asked a spectator to change his t-shirt mid-match.The moment unfolded while Jadeja was batting, only to be distracted by a fan seated behind the bowler’s arm wearing a bright red t-shirt.The colour seemed to interfere with Jadeja’s sightline, a common issue for players when trying to focus on the ball coming out of the bowler’s hand.Rather than create a scene, Jadeja simply informed the on-field umpire about the problem. After security personnel and match officials approached the individual, he eventually agreed to change his t-shirt.Instead of moving, the spectator gamely switched into a grey t-shirt right then and there, drawing cheers from the crowd.Watch:Jadeja gave him a thumbs-up and a grin, diffusing the situation with trademark charm.The incident, caught on camera, quickly went viral, with social media hailing it as yet another reason to love Jadeja’s on-field personality.On the cricketing front, India finished Day 3 in a dominant position. Yashasvi Jaiswal starred with a composed 118, while Akash Deep impressed with a maiden Test fifty, scoring 66 and adding crucial lower-order runs. Washington Sundar provided a late-innings blitz, including three sixes in five balls, propelling India to a second-innings total of 396.England’s response began steadily, with Crawley and Duckett putting up a 50-run stand. But Mohammed Siraj broke through on the final ball of the day, clean bowling Crawley for 14 with a deadly yorker.At stumps, England were 50/1, needing another 324 runs for victory with two days to go—an uphill battle against a confident Indian side. But amidst the serious contest, Jadeja’s fan interaction was a timely reminder of the joy cricket can bring.","Ravindra Jadeja politely asked a spectator to change his t-shirt mid-match.

Drew McIntyre Labels CM Punk’s SummerSlam Heartbreak as “Karma”

Drew McIntyre Finally Wins Big at SummerSlam 2025

People say revenge is a dish best served cold, but sometimes, one doesn’t even need to be directly involved to savor it. Just ask Drew McIntyre. At SummerSlam 2025, CM Punk defeated Gunther in an instant classic to capture the World Heavyweight Championship in the main event of Night One. But before he could celebrate, Seth Rollins made a shocking return, faking a knee injury all along and then cashing in his Money in the Bank briefcase to steal the title and close the night in stunning fashion.And watching it all unfold from afar was ‘The Scottish Psychopath’, who seemed to relish every second of Punk’s heartbreak. For McIntyre, seeing his former rival’s dream crumble was a satisfying moment of revenge, and that too without ever lifting a finger.During the SummerSlam post-show, Cathy Kelley caught up with a very satisfied Drew McIntyre, who couldn’t hide the grin on his face as he reacted to CM Punk’s crushing loss.""Okay, I’m gonna have to say something about this. Karma’s a hell of a thing. I’ve been watching what’s gone on Raw with Seth (Rollins). Seth and I, professional rivals. Not like (CM) Punk and I. Seth has done exactly to Punk what Punk did to me, and tonight was the cherry on top.Congratulations Seth. You deserve it, and karma is indeed a biatch.""For the unversed, just rewind to WrestleMania 40. It was the night that McIntyre captured the World Heavyweight title from Rollins in a brutal encounter. In addition, an injured Punk served as the special commentator for the bout. And after his victory, the Scot tried to get in Punk’s face and mock him.However, that proved to be a big mistake as Punk attacked McIntyre, which led Damian Priest to cash in his Money in the Bank contract and end McIntyre’s reign in under 6 minutes at The Show of Shows. Punk and the Scot then went on to have a trilogy of matches in one of the most personal rivalries in recent memory.Drew McIntyre and Logan Paul scored a big win on Night 1 of WWE SummerSlam, defeating country music star Jelly Roll and future WWE Hall of Famer Randy Orton in a high-energy tag team match on Saturday.The bout delivered several highlight-reel moments, none bigger than when Paul launched himself off the top turnbuckle and crashed through the announce table onto Jelly Roll, drawing a huge reaction from the crowd.
