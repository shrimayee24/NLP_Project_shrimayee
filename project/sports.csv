The match, which drew hundreds of fans eager to witness the ICC Women’s World Cup clash, was the final fixture of the tournament scheduled in the city.“We had received a complaint from the security manager of the Australian team stating that two female players had faced inappropriate behaviour while walking to a cafe from their hotel on Thursday morning.

He was produced before the court and sent to jail on Saturday,” additional DCP (crime branch) Rajesh Dandotiya said.A total of five matches, including the Australia-South Africa clash on Saturday, have been held at the Holkar Stadium here and many of the teams have stayed at the same hotel. Following Simmons’ complaint, lodged at MIG police station late on Thursday evening, an FIR was registered under Sections 74 and 78 of the BNS for assault or criminal force on a woman with intent to outrage her modesty and stalking.According to the FIR, the incident took place around 11am when the two players had stepped out of the hotel to visit a nearby café after informing Simmons.“At approximately 11am, two players advised me they were leaving the hotel to go to a cafe. They were planning to walk to the cafe and I had no concerns with this as they had previously been to the cafe as have several members of the Australian team,” Simmons mentioned in the FIR.“I received a live location notification from one of the players on my mobile phone at 11.08am. This message signifies an emergency distress signal to me from a player to advise they may need assistance.

He again came behind another player and touched her inappropriately before he drove off,” the FIR said.The incident took place in Indore’s MIG area, primarily a marketplace, between their hotel and the café in Saket.Simmons said that the player texted him, “Hey SoS, just sending you my live location... there’s a guy following us trying to grab us.”The man was described as around 30 years old, wearing a white shirt and black cap, and riding a black motorcycle without a helmet.The team’s liaison officers were informed and directed to go to the location to assist the players. A police patrol unit later reached the spot and escorted the cricketers back to their hotel. The complaint stated that the player later messaged again, informing Simmons that local police had arrived and helped them return safely.“I received a further message stating that a nice man in a suit in a car stopped and asked if we were alright and stated that he rang police with the guy’s bike number,” Simmons mentioned in the FIR.Ayush Jain, owner of the café, which is about 5km from the hotel the Australian team was staying in, told TOI, “Many of the Australian team members have been visiting our café in groups of threefour ever since they reached Indore on Oct 17. Nobody in the neighbourhood knew their identity, except us, since the café is thronged by many foreigners who check into nearby hotels.Meanwhile, Madhya Pradesh Cricket Association (MPCA) on Saturday said it is examining “whether the players had sought security cover for the movement outside the hotel.”“The Australian team has a security officer appointed by Cricket Australia along with two security officers appointed by BCCI and the local police.

NEW DELHI: Opener Rohit Sharma struck an unbeaten century, Virat Kohli made a fighting half-century, and pacer Harshit Rana grabbed four wickets as India defeated Australia by nine wickets in the third and final ODI on Saturday, though they lost the series 1-2.Rana’s brilliant spell of 4/39 helped bowl Australia out for 236 in 46.4 overs, setting the stage for a dominant Indian chase.

Rohit was named both Player of the Match and Player of the Series for scoring 202 runs across three games.The two sides will now clash in a five-match T20I series, beginning October 29.","India defeated Australia by nine wickets in the third and final ODI on Saturday.

Months later, her expanding business empire remains one of Edmonton’s most exciting lifestyle stories.Lauren Kyle unveiled her innovative concept Trove Living earlier this year, combining a modern furniture showroom, her interior design offices under Kyle & Co, and a cozy social hub called Bar Trove.

Nick Mangold, the beloved center for the New York Jets, has passed away at 41 from complications related to chronic kidney disease. His death comes just days after he shared publicly that he was on dialysis and searching for a kidney donor. Mangold spent his entire 11-year NFL career with the Jets and was known for his toughness, leadership, and consistency on the field.Nick Mangold spent 11 years as a cornerstone of the New York Jets’ offensive line and earned well for his efforts. In 2010, he signed a seven-year contract extension worth $55 million, making him the highest-paid center in the NFL at the time. The deal included $22 million guaranteed, plus $22.5 million in injury protection, showing just how much the team relied on him. By 2025, his net worth was estimated at about $5.42 million. This includes his NFL salaries, bonuses, and other earnings. While exact numbers can vary, it’s clear that Mangold achieved both football success and financial stability over his career.Mangold was picked in the first round out of Ohio State in 2006 and quickly became the Jets’ starting center. Over his 11-year career, he started 164 of 176 games and barely missed any in his first 10 seasons – an impressive feat for an offensive lineman.He made seven Pro Bowls, was named first-team All-Pro twice, and played a big part in the Jets’ playoff runs in 2009 and 2010. He teamed up with left tackle D’Brickashaw Ferguson to form the famous “Nick & Brick” duo. Together, they anchored the offensive line and helped guide rookie quarterback Mark Sanchez during those playoff seasons.Jets owner Woody Johnson said, “Nick was more than a legendary center. He was the heartbeat of our offensive line for a decade and a beloved teammate whose leadership and toughness defined an era of Jets football. Off the field, Nick's wit, warmth, and unwavering loyalty made him a cherished member of our extended Jets family.”After retiring in 2017, Mangold stayed involved in football by coaching at Delbarton High School in New Jersey. “You get to mold boys into men and teach the game of football — but also teach them a little bit about life as you go along,” he said in a 2024 interview. In October 2025, he shared that he had been living with a rare genetic kidney disorder since 2006. He was on dialysis and urgently looking for a kidney donor, since no one in his family had a matching blood type. Sadly, a donor was not found in time. Mangold was inducted into the Jets Ring of Honor in 2022 and was also considered for the Pro Football Hall of Fame. His influence went far beyond the field, leaving a lasting mark on the team and fans alike.He is survived by his wife, Jenny, and their four children – Matthew, Eloise, Thomas, and Charlotte.","Nick Mangold spent 11 years as a cornerstone of the New York Jets’ offensive line and earned well for his efforts.

Anthony Edwards exits after just three minutes and eight seconds in Timberwolves ’ home opener

Minnesota Timberwolves confirms Anthony Edwards’ hamstring tightness

Immediate impact of Anthony Edward's injury on Minnesota Timberwolves' game plan

The Minnesota Timberwolves started their home opener with great expectations, but it quickly turned into a moment of concern. Anthony Edwards , the team’s promising star, went out early after what appeared to be a standard play. His unexpected exit quieted the audience and shifted the focus from the game’s score to the uncertain future of their main player.In an unexpected turn of events at the Minnesota Timberwolves' home opener at Target Center, superstar guard Anthony Edwards had to leave the game against the Indiana Pacers just three minutes and eight seconds into the first quarter on Sunday, October 26, 2025.The 24-year-old All-NBA player Edwards had to leave the game after experiencing tightness in his right hamstring while finishing a layup. At the point he exited, with 8:53 still on the clock in the quarter, the Timberwolves were leading the Pacers 13-5.After the play, Edwards didn't appear to be in distress right away. He added an extra deceleration step on the layup that looked a little awkward, but he didn't grab his leg or show any visible reaction immediately.Instead, he walked off the court in a relaxed way during the following timeout and made his way straight to the locker room for evaluation.In his limited time on the floor, Edwards put up five points, featuring an early three-pointer and the layup that came right before the injury, along with one rebound.Bones Hyland, the seasoned guard who joined Minnesota in the offseason, promptly checked into the game to fill in for Edwards, helping the Timberwolves sustain their early momentum.The Timberwolves' PR team swiftly shared an update on their official X account, @Twolves_PR, saying, ""Anthony Edwards (Right Hamstring Tightness) will NOT return to tonight’s game."" This update came right after Edwards' departure, at about 8:05 p.m. ET during the live airing on NBA TV and Bally Sports North. The team referred to the problem as ""hamstring tightness,"" a usual soft-tissue issue that often requires caution to steer clear of more severe strains.Timberwolves head coach Chris Finch and the medical staff had no immediate comments during the game, as the focus was on evaluating Edwards in the locker room. ESPN's broadcast mentioned that the team quickly decided to rule him out for the rest of the game, underlining the importance of looking after their franchise star early in the season.With Edwards out, the Minnesota Timberwolves relied on their depth to get through the rest of the game against the Indiana Pacers. Hyland, making his first significant appearance with Minnesota, brought some scoring energy off the bench, while key players like Julius Randle and Rudy Gobert held down the frontcourt.This setback hits Minnesota at a tricky moment, as they currently lead the Western Conference with a 2-1 record following a solid start. If Edwards is out for a while, it could throw off the chemistry they've developed with his exciting playmaking, especially as they bring in new players like Randle and Hyland.Anthony Edwards leaving felt like a quick halt to Minnesota’s initial flow. His vibe usually sets the pace for the Timberwolves, and losing that energy so soon really challenges their stability. Now, the team has a chance to show how much they’ve developed beyond just one star player. Whether they find their footing or trip up will show just how prepared they are to compete.Also Read: Ausar Thompson dominates with tenacity and scoring as Pistons outlast physical Rockets squad","Minnesota Timberwolves star Anthony Edwards left the game after just three minutes and eight seconds.

From Cleveland postseason experience to Baltimore’s dugout: Albernaz brings a winning approach to a team in need of a spark

From behind the plate to the dugout, Albernaz’s journey as a former catcher shapes how he manages and connects with players

Facing the challenge ahead in restoring Baltimore’s lost momentum after a difficult 2024 season

The Baltimore Orioles are reportedly turning a new page. The franchise is in the final stages of hiring Craig Albernaz as its next manager, according to ESPN’s Jeff Passan. The 42-year-old would replace Brandon Scott Hyde, who was dismissed in May during his seventh season with the team. Albernaz’s potential appointment comes at a crucial moment for Baltimore, a club that soared to 101 wins in 2023 but stumbled to a disappointing 75-87 finish this year.Albernaz comes with a reputation for leadership, stability, and development. He most recently served as associate manager for the Cleveland Guardians, helping guide the team to back-to-back postseason appearances. Cleveland finished 88-74 in 2024, a record that reflected his influence in nurturing young talent and maintaining consistency, even though they fell short in the first round of the playoffs.Before Cleveland, he was a bullpen coach and hitting instructor for the San Francisco Giants, where his analytical approach and calm leadership earned respect from players. He also spent years in the Tampa Bay Rays’ farm system, shaping minor league prospects and building a foundation that now aligns with Baltimore’s youth-focused rebuild.A Massachusetts native, Albernaz spent nine seasons as a minor league catcher within the Rays and Detroit Tigers organizations, reaching as high as Triple-A.While he never played in the majors, his time behind the plate gave him a unique perspective on the game — patient, observant, and focused on strategy and communication.Those who know him describe his coaching style as “detailed but human,” blending data-driven decisions with emotional intelligence. If the Orioles finalize his hiring, it would mark his first managerial role in Major League Baseball, a testament to years of preparation, persistence, and earned credibility.Brandon Scott Hyde’s firing marked the end of a turbulent chapter for the Orioles. Once named AL Manager of the Year in 2023, Hyde oversaw a meteoric rise that this season fell apart with a 15–28 start. Interim manager Tony Mansolino took over but could not turn the team’s fortunes around. Orioles president Mike Elias later confirmed that while Mansolino was “a real candidate,” the team opted for a new direction.That new direction now appears to point toward Albernaz — a coach known for connecting with players, instilling discipline, and maximizing potential. Baltimore hopes he can restore confidence, spark consistency, and lead the team back into postseason contention.Also read: How Blue Jays catcher Alejandro Kirk is silently dominating the World Series despite his unconventional height and powerful build",Craig Albernaz is in the final stages of being named the Baltimore Orioles' next manager.

Cam Skattebo’s breakout season takes a devastating turn

Giants facing another offensive blow amid tough season

What’s next: awaiting scans and official diagnosis

New York Giants rookie running back Cam Skattebo went from rising star to a heartbreaking scene on Sunday afternoon. During the Giants’ Week 8 clash with the Philadelphia Eagles, the 23-year-old suffered a gruesome-looking leg injury that left fans stunned and teammates surrounding him in silence. The cart, the air cast, and the emotion on Skattebo’s face said it all, this wasn’t just another knock. Here’s everything that went down, what’s known so far, and what it means for both the Giants and their promising rookie.Until today, Skattebo had been one of the brightest spots in an otherwise up-and-down season for the New York Giants. Drafted in the fourth round out of Arizona State, he’d quickly earned a role in the Giants’ offense with his burst, balance, and pass-catching versatility. Many saw him as the kind of underdog who could reshape New York’s run game.But midway through the second quarter against the Eagles, things went south fast. Skattebo caught a short pass, tried to cut upfield, and his right leg twisted awkwardly as he was tackled. He immediately grabbed his ankle in pain and the reaction from players nearby told you it was bad.Trainers rushed in as Skattebo stayed down, clearly unable to put weight on his leg.Within moments, they brought out an air cast, one of those dreaded sights that usually signals a serious injury. Fans at Lincoln Financial Field stood in respectful silence as Skattebo was loaded onto the cart, surrounded by concerned teammates.According to reports, Skattebo was officially ruled out for the remainder of the game, and the Giants later confirmed it was a right leg injury. Early visuals suggest potential ankle or lower-leg damage, though no official diagnosis has been shared yet.For the Giants, this couldn’t come at a worse time. The team has already been battling inconsistency and injuries, and Skattebo had been one of the few reliable spark plugs in their offense. His ability to run, block, and make plays after contact made him a dual-threat weapon in a system still searching for rhythm.With Skattebo sidelined, the Giants will likely turn to Devin Singletary and Tyrone Tracy Jr. to fill the gap but replacing the rookie’s energy and explosiveness won’t be easy.As of Sunday night, the Giants haven’t released full details about the nature or severity of Skattebo’s injury. Given the air cast and how his ankle appeared to bend unnaturally, early speculation points toward a fracture or major sprain either way, a potentially extended absence.Fans and analysts alike are anxiously awaiting updates from head coach Brian Daboll and the team’s medical staff. If the injury requires surgery, Skattebo’s promising rookie season could be over before November even begins.Also read - Madison Beer dethrones Taylor Swift as Spotify’s fastest-growing female artist — gains 430K listeners in one day","New York Giants rookie running back Cam Skattebo suffered a gruesome leg injury against the Philadelphia Eagles.

The two-time MVP remains listed as probable with a left great toe sprain, an issue that has lingered since last week. However, the “Greek Freak” already played through the same injury in the Bucks’ previous outing, proving once again that pain is no obstacle when he’s locked in and leading his team.According to the official NBA injury report, Giannis Antetokounmpo continues to deal with the toe sprain that limited his practice sessions over the weekend. Still, he looked every bit like his dominant self in Friday’s victory over the Toronto Raptors, where he recorded 31 points, 20 rebounds, and seven assists - marking his seventh career game with that remarkable stat line or better.Head coach Doc Rivers and the Bucks’ medical team are reportedly keeping a close eye on Giannis Antetokounmpo’s workload, particularly this early in the season. Even so, all signs indicate that Milwaukee’s franchise cornerstone will take the court tonight unless an unexpected setback occurs during warmups. His availability gives the Bucks a significant boost as they aim to remain unbeaten.The Milwaukee Bucks ’ injury concerns don’t end with their superstar forward. Kyle Kuzma, who twisted his left ankle late in Friday’s contest, has been downgraded to doubtful after early optimism that he might play.Kevin Porter Jr. continues to sit out due to the same ankle issue that’s kept him sidelined since opening night, while Cole Anthony has been listed as questionable because of a non-COVID illness.Should Kuzma and Porter remain inactive, Milwaukee may turn to depth players like Myles Turner, Ryan Rollins, and Malik Beasley to carry more of the offensive load. That could also mean more responsibility for the bench unit if Giannis Antetokounmpo’s minutes are carefully managed. The Bucks are currently 2-0 and have looked impressive on both ends of the floor, but their rotation depth will be tested in this matchup.The Cavaliers, entering the game with a 1-1 record, will look to build on their recent win over the Brooklyn Nets after dropping their season opener against the New York Knicks. Donovan Mitchell and Evan Mobley have been the focal points of the team’s attack, but the absence of Darius Garland and Max Strus could impact their rhythm and shot creation against a disciplined Milwaukee defense.With the Cavs trying to find their footing early in the season and the Bucks chasing their third consecutive win, tonight’s game presents an intriguing early test for both squads. It’s a matchup that pits Milwaukee’s established chemistry and championship experience against Cleveland’s youthful energy and home-court advantage.Also read: Milwaukee Bucks vs Cleveland Cavaliers regular season game injury report: Who's playing, who's out, and more (October 26, 2025) Everything points to Giannis Antetokounmpo taking the floor tonight against the Cleveland Cavaliers, continuing his stellar start to the 2025-26 campaign despite dealing with a nagging toe injury.

Uncertainty grows in Boston as their star player’s comeback remains unclear

Exploring Jayson Tatum’s slow and steady road to recovery

The 2025–26 NBA season officially began on Tuesday. Like many other matches, fans were eager for the Bolton Celtics vs. Detroit Pistons game. On October 26 at 3:30 p.m. ET, the Pistons will host the Celtics at the Little Caesars Arena in Detroit. The main concern now is whether Jayson Tatum, a star for the Boston Celtics, will be playing tonight. The short answer is no. Tatum's Achilles injury is still not fully healed.Without several key players, the Boston Celtics might be hoping for their first victory of the year. However, ESPN's Shams Charania stated on the Pat McAfee Show that Jayson Tatum had been declared out for the 2025–2026 season. This is due to his Achilles' recovery. He tore his Achilles tendon during the playoffs last spring.Hence, Boston may be without Jaylen Brown and new reserve centre Luka Garza in addition to Jayson Tatum . Tatum, meanwhile, is eager to participate in the game as soon as possible. Only five months after rupturing his right Achilles tendon, he hasn't put a lot of pressure on himself.Tatum said at Boston Celtics' media day on September 30:""No pressure. No pressure to return back any sooner than when I'm 100 percent healthy.No pressure from [Celtics president of basketball operations] Brad [Stevens], [coach] Joe [Mazzulla], the team, the organization. The most important thing is that I'm 100 percent recovered and healthy whenever I come back.""The All-Star appeared game-ready as he took the dais to answer questions from the media. He further said:""Today is cool.. I think tomorrow will be tough with practice starting out. I won't be able to be out there.""For a club that underwent an offseason revamp, expectations are far lower this season. Hence, for a really long time, Jaylen Brown , led the club without Tatum. However, Brown didn’t think that Tatum's absence required him to change his style of play all that much. He said during the same media day:""I'm going to approach it the same way I've always approached it.. Obviously, I'm going to have more responsibility with Jayson not being here. But also gives a chance for other guys to step up. Empowering other guys. Trusting your teammates more. Trying to accelerate guys' learning curves. And play some good basketball. I think that's what people want to see.""In May 2025, while playing the New York Knicks in a playoff game, Jayson Tatum tore his right Achilles tendon. He is currently undergoing a strict rehabilitation procedure after having surgery to fix the injuries.He is anticipated to miss a large amount of the upcoming 2025–26 season, but there is hope that he could return in February or March 2026. The Celtics initially did not specify a schedule for his comeback. Nevertheless, Tatum has resumed light basketball workouts as part of his six-day-per-week rehab program, though he would not disclose his precise recovery status.Along with fellow NBA players Tyrese Haliburton , Damian Lillard, and Dejounte Murray, who are all recovering from Achilles tendon operations, Tatum stated that he has also received help in preserving his mental health through the ""Achilles group chat"" he participates in.It has helped Tatum put his recovery into perspective and in acknowledging both minor and major accomplishments, such as getting off one crutch, then another, and then walking for the first time.Also read: ""Career flashed before my eyes’: Jayson Tatum opens up on Achilles tear as Boston Celtics await his return",The 2025–26 NBA season officially began on Tuesday.

What to Expect from the Matchup

will suit up and play tonight as thetake on the Milwaukee Bucks on October 26, 2025, at Rocket Arena. The Cavaliers’ All-Star guard continues to be the focal point of the team’s offense, especially as Cleveland navigates through multiple absences to key players like Darius Garland and Max Strus. Donovan Mitchell comes into tonight’s contest in peak form, showing no signs of slowing down after two explosive outings to open the 2025–26 NBA season. Following a 31-point performance in the opener against the New York Knicks, he delivered another standout showing with 35 points in Friday’s 131–124 victory over the Brooklyn Nets. With Garland still sidelined, the Cleveland Cavaliers have leaned heavily on Mitchell’s scoring and playmaking abilities - and he has responded with remarkable consistency.The team’s official report from October 26 confirmed that Mitchell is fully healthy and without any injury designation. The 28-year-old guard has averaged over 33 points per game through Cleveland’s first two matchups, demonstrating elite shooting efficiency and a renewed focus on quick offensive execution. Donovan Mitchell’s confidence and rhythm make him one of the league’s most dangerous offensive threats heading into this marquee matchup against Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Bucks.Cleveland Cavaliers continues to be short-handed as several rotation players remain sidelined.• Darius Garland (left toe injury) – Out• Max Strus (left foot fracture) – Out• De’Andre Hunter (knee soreness) – Questionable but nearing a returnDespite those setbacks, the Cavaliers have found steady production from their frontcourt. Jarrett Allen posted a 22-point, 11-rebound double-double against Brooklyn, while Evan Mobley continues to anchor the defense and rebound effectively. Through two games, Cleveland sits at 1–1 on the season, averaging just over 120 points per game. However, their defense remains a concern, allowing opponents to score 121.5 points on average.The Bucks enter the game dealing with injuries of their own but expect their MVP to be on the court. Giannis Antetokounmpo (left great toe sprain) – Probable and expected to play• Kevin Porter Jr. (ankle sprain) – Out• Kyle Kuzma (ankle sprain) – Doubtful• Cole Anthony (non-COVID illness) – QuestionableMilwaukee remains one of the league’s most potent offenses, averaging an impressive 127.5 points per game. Giannis continues to dominate on both ends, recently notching a 31-point, 20-rebound performance against the Toronto Raptors. Even with some players sidelined, the Bucks’ offensive depth and transition game keep them a constant threat.With Donovan Mitchell in top form, the Cleveland Cavaliers are expected to capitalize on Milwaukee’s weakened backcourt depth. His ability to create shots under pressure and control the game’s tempo could be the key to Cleveland’s success. The absence of Garland means Mitchell will shoulder much of the offensive initiation once again, likely attacking early to exploit mismatches.On the other end, Giannis will look to apply his trademark pressure inside the paint, forcing the Cavaliers’ big men - Allen and Mobley - into constant defensive adjustments. This dynamic could set the stage for a high-scoring, fast-paced contest between two of the Eastern Conference’s elite stars.Cleveland Cavaliers fans have reason to be optimistic: Donovan Mitchell is fully active and ready to play. After back-to-back 30-plus point performances, he has shown no lingering effects from the minor cramping issue he experienced in the season opener. Cleveland will rely heavily on his offensive spark to keep pace with Milwaukee’s relentless attack.Also read: Milwaukee Bucks vs Cleveland Cavaliers regular season game injury report: Who's playing, who's out, and more (October 26, 2025) With the Bucks entering the game undefeated at 2–0 and the Cavaliers sitting at 1–1, tonight’s clash promises intensity, star power, and early-season excitement as both teams look to make a statement in the East.","Cleveland Cavaliers take on the Milwaukee Bucks on October 26, 2025, at Rocket Arena.

Poll Should Karun Nair be given another chance in the national team? Yes, he deserves another chance No, he should focus on domestic cricket

A month ago, on September 25 to be precise, when the Indian team was picked for the home Test series against West Indies, Karun Nair was back to square one. After a couple of stirring domestic seasons, his Test career got a second wind when he was picked for the tour of England after a seven-year hiatus. His returns during the series were a modest 205 runs.According to BCCI chief selector Ajit Agarkar , they ‘expected a little bit more’ from him in England. After the West Indies series snub, another blow awaited the 33-year-old, as he failed to make the India ‘A’ cut for the forthcoming two-match red-ball series against South Africa ‘A’ at home.Karun’s India recall was on the strength of the 1,553 runs he scored in the Ranji Trophy in the previous two seasons for Vidarbha. The 33-year-old is disappointed but far from done. He is back to doing what he knows best – piling on the runs. After scoring 73 and 8 against Saurashtra in the season-opener, Karun crafted an unbeaten 174 against Goa here on Sunday.Speaking after his innings, which he could not convert into a double hundred as he ran out of partners, Karun said, “There are certain goals that I’ve set for myself, which I wouldn’t want to talk about. But other than that, the primary goal would be to win games for the team.”The middle-order batter did not hide his disappointment at being ignored by the national selectors. “It’s quite disappointing (being dropped), but I know that I deserve to be there after the last two years (of domestic cricket) I’ve had. People might have their own opinions, but personally, my opinion is that I deserve a lot better.”While Karun did not address the issue of communication from the team management, he revealed, “Few individuals in the team have had good conversations with me about how they feel and that’s about it.”Karun is determined not to give up. “All I can do is keep scoring runs, that’s my job. There’s nothing much for me to say. I just keep telling myself that I deserve more than a series. That’s all I can tell myself, and not let that get into my head. All I want to do is to play for the country. That’s the only target. If you’re not able to do that, the next thing would be to try and win games for the side I'm playing for,” he added.","Karun Nair scored 174 not out against Goa in the Ranji Trophy on Sunday. The 33-year-old was dropped from the India team for the Test series against West Indies. The Karnataka batsman has scored 1,553 runs in the previous two seasons for Vidarbha.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124838254,imgsize-155974,width-400,resizemode-4/ranji-trophy-karnataka-vs-saurashtra.jpg"

India vs Australia: Virat Kohli & Rohit Sharma rewrite history at SCG

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma ’s arrival at the crease during the third and final ODI at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Saturday was met with a mix of awe, nostalgia, and emotion. It wasn’t just Indian fans who were captivated — even the Australian crowd and commentators were moved by what could be the legendary duo’s final outing together on Australian soil.“Standby, because while the skipper is departing, the king is about to arrive for the very last time on Australian shores in Indian colours. Ladies and gentlemen… here he is, Virat Kohli,” said Adam White on SEN Cricket.“As you'd expect, as we always see, he marches out with purpose. Arguably the best one-day record in the history of the game.”Trent Copeland added, “You got to pinch yourself occasionally, don't you Whitey? That we're here for this moment. This guy has been at the centre of seismic shifts in cricket. Unquestionably the best one-day record.”Rohit Sharma (121 not out) continued his fine form from Adelaide, producing an even more flawless knock to register his 33rd ODI hundred. The former India skipper now sits third on the list of most centuries in the format, behind Kohli (51) and Sachin Tendulkar (49).Kohli, after back-to-back ducks in the first two ODIs, bounced back with an unbeaten 74. As the two walked back to the pavilion following India’s nine-wicket victory, the SCG crowd erupted in applause — and an emotional Australian commentator was even seen in tears. The video quickly went viral on social media.Kohli’s knock also helped him surpass Kumar Sangakkara to become the second-highest run-scorer in men’s ODI history, with 14,255 runs in 305 matches — trailing only Sachin Tendulkar.","Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma’s arrival at the crease during the third and final ODI at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Saturday was met with a mix of awe, nostalgia, and emotion.

Atul Wassan criticises Congress leader Shama Mohamed for comments on Sarfaraz Khan

NEW DELHI: Sarfaraz Khan , a consistent performer in domestic red-ball cricket, endured a disappointing outing in Mumbai’s recent Ranji Trophy match against Chhattisgarh, managing just one run. The 26-year-old middle-order batter, widely backed by fans and pundits for national selection, had recently been overlooked for the India A squad against South Africa A, prompting surprise and debate.On a seamer-friendly Bandra-Kurla Complex pitch, Sarfaraz was dismissed by Chhattisgarh’s left-arm spinner Aditya Sarwate after facing only six deliveries.After the dismissal, Sarfaraz shared an Instagram Stories post showing his TV screen playing the song Restart from the movie 12th Fail, with his India Test cap and Mumbai cap visible behind the television.This came after a relatively better performance in his previous Ranji outing against Jammu & Kashmir in Srinagar, where he scored 42 and 32, marking a return from injury.Mumbai captain Shardul Thakur defended Khan’s international prospects despite his India A omission.“Nowadays, for the India A side they look at boys, who they want to prepare for international cricket. Sarfaraz doesn’t need India A games to play international cricket. If he gets back to scoring again, he can straightaway go and play Test series too,” he said.“He is coming from an injury lay-off. But before that, he scored two or three centuries in the Buchi Babu Trophy.Coming back against J&K, he had a nice 40 (42). It was very unfortunate to have been run out. But for him, I don’t think playing India A is important. He is a senior pro and whenever we put him in there in the 22 yards, he is someone who always delivers in crunch situations,” Thakur added.Thakur also praised Sarfaraz's ability under pressure: “He has big scores of 200-250s and those innings have come when the team was two or three down quite early. To play that kind of innings under pressure, you have to have something special. He is one of the special players who never disappoints. Regardless of which number he bats, I think he will deliver.”","Sarfaraz Khan endured a disappointing outing in Mumbai’s recent Ranji Trophy match against Chhattisgarh, managing just one run.

Poll How impressed are you with Harshit Rana's performance in the recent ODI series? Very Impressed Somewhat Impressed Not Impressed Neutral

Harshit Rana has emerged as one of the standout performers in the recent ODI series in Australia, delivering crucial breakthroughs and showcasing calm under pressure. The speedster picked up six wickets in the series, including a four for 39 in the final ODI at the Sydney Cricket Ground.Speaking to teammate Washington Sundar , Rana reflected on how his experience from last year’s debut Down Under helped him plan his bowling and execute game-changing spell in the third ODI.“Obviously, it's a really blessed feeling for me,” said Harshit. “I never thought that I would come here again. I made my debut here for India a year ago. I can't describe that feeling but I'm very happy.”Rana admitted that his previous experience in Australia helped him understand the conditions and plan his lengths. “I feel like it really helped me a lot because when I was here a year ago, it was new for me to come to Australia. But I came again here. It was in my mind which length I should bowl. I think that helped me a lot because I had an idea on which lengths I should hit.”Sundar praised Harshit for his persistence and smart bowling. “For all of us, it was great to see you run in really hard, spell after spell, bowling your heart out and getting those crucial wickets.Obviously, the difference was getting them for about 30 runs lesser. And it made a lot of difference to the game. The way you used your brains, especially after 35 overs, was amazing.”Harshit, in turn, asked Sundar what made the difference this series compared to previous outings. Sundar explained: “I’ve played in Australia before, so I know what to expect from the wickets and the conditions. I just did a little bit of homework, and I think I did the homework a lot better than in the past. So I think it all worked well for me.”Rana also acknowledged the challenges of bowling on spin-unfriendly wickets. “The wickets were not that spin friendly. It was not easy to bowl on these wickets. But it’s always a challenge no matter where we’re playing. I saw it as an opportunity. It’s fun to work really hard, especially bowling in such conditions where you get a little bounce, and sometimes it skids through and surprises the batsmen. So it’s always fun to play cricket in Australia,” he said.When asked about his favorite wicket of the match, Harshit revealed the Owen dismissal: “I would say that's the Owen wicket. Before I was going to bowl to Owen, Shubman said to me, ‘keep slip.’ I said no, I don't want a slip. But Rohit Bhai said, ‘Aye slip rakh na (keep a slip).’ So he went to slip, and the first ball went there. I was like, thank God.”","Harshit Rana has emerged as one of the standout performers in the recent ODI series in Australia.

Indian captain Rohit Sharma is well-known for his forgetfulness, a trait his teammates have often highlighted. On Saturday, Rohit hit a magnificent 121 while Kohli produced a 74-run knock in India’s victory.But after the match, while shaking hands with the opposition players, Rohit forgot to remove his helmet.He then asked sidearm thrower Dayananda Garani for his cap, while watching his Team India teammates, including Shubman Gill and KL Rahul , burst into laughter.Garani handed the cap to Rohit, who wore it and finally removed his helmet and went for the post-match presentation.Rohit Sharma has always cherished playing in Australia, and after a challenging ODI series against the old rivals, the former captain admitted on Saturday that there might not be another trip for him.""Always love coming here and playing here.

Why the Cowboys turned to Joe Milton as Dak Prescott sits out — full breakdown of the decision,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/why-the-cowboys-turned-to-joe-milton-as-dak-prescott-sits-out-full-breakdown-of-the-decision/articleshow/124837159.cms,"Why Dak Prescott Wasn’t on the Field in the Fourth Quarter as Joe Milton Took Over for Cowboys (AP Photos)

Joe Milton takes over as Dak Prescott rests late in blowout loss



Prescott’s struggles and Cowboys’ next steps after Denver defeat



The Dallas Cowboys’ Week 8 matchup against the Denver Broncos didn’t end the way fans expected. As the game wound down, starting quarterback Dak Prescott was nowhere to be seen on the field. Instead, Joe Milton III stepped in, making his regular-season debut under center. The change sparked plenty of curiosity—but not controversy—as Dallas aimed to protect its starter in a tough loss.Dak Prescott wasn’t injured or benched out of frustration. The Cowboys simply decided to pull him with about seven minutes left in the game, trailing 44-17. Head coach Brian Schottenheimer made the call to protect his quarterback from further hits against Denver’s aggressive defense. Prescott had been under heavy pressure all afternoon, completing 19 of 31 passes for 188 yards with no touchdowns and two interceptions.In contrast, Joe Milton brought a spark in limited action. The rookie, who joined Dallas in the offseason via a trade from the New England Patriots, replaced Cooper Rush as the team’s backup quarterback. On his first drive, Milton showed off his trademark arm strength, delivering a perfect 35-yard touchdown strike to Jalen Tolbert. It was a small glimpse of what the young quarterback can offer. Milton finished the day completing three of four passes for 58 yards and a touchdown, even leading one more drive before the clock ran out.“There has never been a question about Milton’s arm strength,” analysts have said. “If he ever starts, his consistency will be more in question.” But on Sunday, Milton certainly made an impression.The loss dropped Dallas to 3-4-1 on the season, while Denver improved to 6-2, remaining perfect at home. Broncos quarterback Bo Nix outshined Prescott, going 19-for-29 for 247 yards and four touchdowns. Despite Prescott’s efforts to connect with receivers George Pickens and CeeDee Lamb—who combined for 14 receptions—Dallas couldn’t find the end zone through the air.Looking ahead, the Cowboys will host the Arizona Cardinals next week at AT&T Stadium. For Dallas to bounce back, Prescott must find better rhythm, and the offensive line has to do a stronger job of keeping him upright. The Cowboys still believe in their playoff chances, but it’s clear Prescott and company have some serious regrouping to do before then.Also Read: Jake Ferguson’s fiancée Haley Cavinder delights fans with perfect touchdown celebration reenactments for National Tight End Day","Joe Milton III made his regular-season debut under center for the Dallas Cowboys.

First-year head coach Kellen Moore benched struggling quarterback Spencer Rattler for Tyler Shough, but the offensive woes persisted. Despite a strong defensive effort, the offense failed to capitalize on opportunities, leaving the Saints' season in jeopardy.

Spencer Rattler ’s rocky outing pushes Moore to a long-awaited decision

Tyler Shough enters to cheers, but execution still falters



The New Orleans Saints stepped into Week 8 hoping for relief, redemption, or at least a first down without the chorus of boos. Instead, the Caesars Superdome crowd watched a season already wobbling on thin legs nearly collapse. Spencer Rattler’s early struggles pushed first-year head coach Kellen Moore to make a move many fans had been begging for: a quarterback change. But even that couldn’t save a 23-3 defeat to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers that dropped New Orleans to 1-7.After backing the former Oklahoma and South Carolina standout through weeks of inconsistency and turnovers, Moore finally reached his breaking point. Roughly 15 minutes before the switch, fans roared their disapproval as the offense trudged off the field empty-handed once again.That frustration only intensified after Rattler fumbled on the opening drive and later threw a costly pick-six inside his own 10-yard line, as Buccaneers linebacker Anthony Nelson snatched the ball “to the house for an easy score.”Though Rattler completed 15 of 21 passes for 136 yards, the efficiency was cosmetic. The Saints crossed midfield four times with him under center and scored just once. A penalty-filled, time-wasting three-and-out early in the second half sealed his fate.When Louisville product Tyler Shough’s face flashed on the video board, fans finally had a reason to raise their voices. It was the loudest the Dome had sounded all afternoon. Yet hope soon gave way to a familiar reality. Shough finished 17-of-30 for 128 yards with an interception that slipped through Chris Olave’s grasp. The offense still couldn’t finish drives, still couldn’t capitalize on opportunities, and still couldn’t match even a modest Tampa Bay attack led by Baker Mayfield.The Saints defense deserved a different ending. Chase Young and company delivered four straight goal-line stops, three sacks on Mayfield, and a forced fumble inside Tampa territory. They gave the team life; the offense simply refused to accept it.As New Orleans looks ahead to the Los Angeles Rams, Moore now faces a defining choice. If he sticks with Shough, fans will see whether change can finally bring a spark. Because this season, now teetering dangerously, is rapidly running out of second chances.Also Read: Bo Nix at the center of Denver’s trade strategy as Denver Broncos hunt for proven receivers","The New Orleans Saints lost 23-3 to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, dropping their record to 1-7.

A marriage built on privacy, purpose, and team mentality

Jonathan Taylor has become one of the brightest stars in the NFL , but behind the Indianapolis Colts running back’s success is someone who has supported him since long before the stadium lights and roaring crowds. His wife, Ayanna Chapman, isn’t just known as the woman cheering in the stands. She is a former collegiate athlete, a scholar, and the grounding force in Taylor’s life.Long before she became Mrs. Taylor, Ayanna Chapman built her own winning reputation. Raised in Salem, New Jersey, she shined across multiple sports including field hockey, basketball, and track. Her senior season at Salem High ended with a stellar 12–2 record and an undefeated stretch in conference games that secured a championship. The heart she showed on the field translated just as strongly in the classroom, graduating with a remarkable 4.28 GPA and earning National Honor Society honors.Her path then led to Ball State University where she majored in political science and played field hockey as a back and midfielder. Even though her college career didn’t continue at the professional level, those years cemented the qualities that define her today: dedication, discipline, and a deep love for family.Jonathan Taylor and Ayanna Chapman’s relationship could be the script of a romance film.

A veteran pass catcher could accelerate Bo Nix ’s rise and balance Denver’s offensive identity

The Denver Broncos have turned the AFC West into a plot twist nobody saw coming. Sitting on top of the division and armed with a defense that plays like it’s fueled by rocket fuel and stubborn pride, the franchise believes the moment to push for something bigger is now. And that means help for rookie quarterback Bo Nix is priority number one.Denver’s defense has been the heartbeat of its strong start, shutting down big-name opponents and keeping pressure off the offense when needed. But as the second half of the season looms, the Broncos know that holding off the Chiefs and Chargers won’t be easy. Even elite defenses eventually need someone to put the ball in the end zone.Enter the trade deadline.According to ESPN insider Adam Schefter, Denver is among the most active teams hunting for wide receiver help. “The three teams that appear to be most aggressively pursuing a wide receiver before the deadline are the Pittsburgh Steelers, Buffalo Bills, and Denver Broncos, according to sources,” Schefter stated.Courtland Sutton has been a steady WR1, but the supporting cast remains a collection of developing talent.Youngsters Troy Franklin and Marvin Mims have flashed promise like lightning on a summer night, but flashes aren’t the same as reliability in high-pressure divisional battles.With rookie Pat Bryant still adjusting to NFL speed and defenses quickly learning how to pressure Nix, a proven route runner could be the missing puzzle piece. Rashid Shaheed, one of the names tied to Denver, brings speed and savvy that would immediately lift the Broncos’ passing ceiling.Denver is also reportedly exploring tight end upgrades, signaling a broader offensive makeover. This isn’t a team tinkering at the edges. It’s a franchise looking to kick down the door to contender status.The vision is simple: complement an already dominant defense with firepower that forces opponents to sweat every drive. A strengthened receiver corps could turn Bo Nix’s promising start into a rookie campaign worthy of January football glory.If the Broncos land their target, the AFC West race might look a lot different by the time the dust settles on deadline day.Also Read: “Worst sculpture made of an athlete”: Tom Brady reignites war with Cristiano Ronaldo fans after mocking his disastrous statue","The Denver Broncos are aggressively pursuing wide receiver help before the trade deadline.
