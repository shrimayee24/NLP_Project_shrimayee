NEW DELHI: Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren on Tuesday penned a heartfelt tribute to his father and Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) founder Shibu Soren, following his death at the age of 81, calling it the ""most toughest time of his life. ""Shibu Soren, popularly known as ‘Dishom Guru’, was a towering figure in Indian tribal politics and played a key role in the movement for Jharkhand’s statehood.He passed away on Monday at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in New Delhi after a prolonged illness.Sharing a post on X, Soren described the immense personal and public loss, stating that beyond losing a father, Jharkhand has lost a crucial leader.""I am going through the toughest days of my life. Not only has the shadow of a father been taken from me, but a pillar of Jharkhand's soul has departed,"" Hemant Soren posted on X.""I didn't just call him 'Baba,' He was my guide, the root of my thoughts, and that forest-like shade that protected thousands and lakhs of Jharkhandis from the scorching sun and injustice,"" he continued.Recalling his father's humble beginnings, he said that his father was, ""born in that small house in Nemra village, where there was poverty, there was hunger, but there was courage.In his childhood, he lost his father. The exploitation of the landlords gave him a fire that made him a fighter for his entire life.""The Jharkhand CM further reflected on how his father led not through words alone but by living the struggles of the people.""I have seen him tilling the fields, sitting among the people, not just giving speeches, but living the sorrows of the people,"" he said.Explaining the origin of the title 'Dishom Guru', Hemant shared a childhood memory saying, ""In my childhood, when I asked him, 'Baba, why do people call you Dishom Guru?' He would smile and say: 'Because, son, I only understood their pain and made their fight my own.'""""That title was not written in any book, nor was it given by Parliament. It came from the hearts of Jharkhand's people,"" Soren added.He also explained the meaning behind the name: ""'Dishom' means society, 'Guru' means the one who shows the way.""He also praised his father's fearless commitment to justice, saying that he was not afraid of ""taking on the mightiest of the mighty.""""I was scared, but Baba was never afraid. He would say: 'If standing against injustice is a crime, then I will be guilty again and again.' No book can explain Baba's struggle. It was in his sweat, in his voice, and in the cracked heels covered by his sandals,"" Hemant said.He recalled his father's humility even after Jharkhand achieved statehood. ""When Jharkhand became a state, His dream came true, but he never considered power an achievement. He said: ""This state is not a throne for me, It is the identity of my people.""Hemant ended his note by acknowledging his father's fighting spirit, stating that his presence would continue in every aspect of Jharkhand's existence.""The dream you saw is now my promise. I will not let Jharkhand bow down; I will not let your name fade away. Your struggle will not remain incomplete. Baba, now you rest. You have fulfilled your duty. Now we must walk in your footsteps. Jharkhand will remain indebted to you. I, your son, will keep your promise,"" the CM noted.Shibu Soren leaves behind a legacy of struggle, sacrifice, and unwavering dedication to the cause of tribal empowerment in India. The emotional tribute came, as leaders across the political spectrum paid their respects to a the veteran leader.The final rites of the three-time Jharkhand chief minister will take place in Jharkhand on Tuesday.","Shibu Soren, popularly known as ‘Dishom Guru’, was a towering figure in Indian tribal politics. He played a key role in the movement for Jharkhand’s statehood.

"IND vs ENG Test: 'In today's day and age...' – R Ashwin slams Shubman Gill, Gautam Gambhir for 'lack of game awareness'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-tour-of-england/ind-vs-eng-test-in-todays-day-and-age-r-ashwin-slams-shubman-gill-gautam-gambhir-for-lack-of-game-awareness/articleshow/123085619.cms,"India head coach Gautam Gambhir (left) and Shubman Gill during a nets session at the Kia Oval, London, Wednesday July 30, 2025.

IND vs ENG: Gautam Gambhir loses cool during heated exchange with ground staff at The Oval ahead of 5th Test

Poll Do you agree with R Ashwin's criticism of Shubman Gill's captaincy? Yes, he lacks experience. No, he will improve over time. Partially, he needs to adapt. Not sure.

Former India off-spinner R Ashwin has slammed captain Shubman Gill and coach Gautam Gambhir for a ""lack of game awareness"" in the ongoing Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy.Bad light and subsequent rain forced stumps to be called early on Day 4 of the fifth Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy Test at The Oval on Sunday. With the stage set for a thrilling Day 5, England need just 35 more runs to win, while India require four wickets for a miraculous victory.""Coming back to the topic of spinners not being used, I have felt in this series that there has been a lack of game awareness and, in many ways, our tactical acumen — both on and off the field. This is the main reason why England are ahead in this series and India are behind. We haven't been the sharpest,” Ashwin said on his YouTube channel Ash Ki Baat.“I feel Shubman Gill will get much better as a captain. He will learn. But sometimes, if you feel that you can play spin really well, you might not bring spinners into the attack. And when you miss the right moment to introduce spinners in these conditions, they become a defensive option,” he added.Rain forcing the match into the fifth day means every Test of the riveting five-match series has now gone into the final day. England looked all set to complete the chase of 374 on Day 4, thanks to Joe Root hitting his 39th Test century — 105 off 152 balls — paying a fitting tribute to Graham Thorpe.His fellow Yorkshireman Harry Brook struck a stunning 111 off 98 balls — his tenth century in the longer format — and made the most of a crucial reprieve on 19, dropped by Mohammed Siraj. Root and Brook shared a brilliant counter-attacking stand of 195 runs, giving England real hope of completing their second-highest run chase of all time — and the highest ever at The Oval.“When Harry Brook started taking it on, after 20 runs, you could have brought on the spinner to choke the run flow. From the other end, a pacer could have bowled. With all this in mind, Washington Sundar could have been introduced earlier into the attack,” Ashwin said.“Making these mistakes creates a huge gap. We don’t know whether the message is going from outside to the middle. We don’t know what’s being discussed in the dressing room. But in today’s day and age, these mistakes can definitely be avoided,” he added.","Former India off-spinner R Ashwin has slammed captain Shubman Gill and coach Gautam Gambhir for a ""lack of game awareness"" in the ongoing Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy.

The August 4th episode of Monday Night RAW was going to see the aftermath of the Biggest Party of the Summer, and that is exactly what fans got. From Seth Rollins and his faction - Oracle, Paul Heyman and his crew, Bronson Reed and Bron Breakker, to a face that had taken a backseat for a while - tonight's episode has a lot going onFor the show in Center in Brooklyn, New York, appearances by new WWE World Heavyweight Champion Seth Rollins, WWE Women’s Intercontinental Champion Becky Lynch, and WWE Women’s Tag-Team Champions from SmackDown, Alexa Bliss & Charlotte Flair, are already set. As is the case with the rematch between Rusev and Sheamus, which is going to take place as well. Let's see what the aftermath of the SummerSlam episode has in store for us.The episode started with Seth Rollins and his faction walking onto the stage, with the former holding on to his brand-new WWE World Heavyweight Championship belt. Rollins addressed the crowd, gloating about his win. But while this was going on, none other than LA Knight showed up, mocking the others for what happened at SummerSlam.There was a bit of back and forth before Rollins decided he wasn't going to just stand there and listen. He walked out of the ring with his crew, leaving a smirking LA KNIGHT behind. And just when we thought this was done, the RAW General Manager walked in and announced that Rollins would have to pay the price for cheating and defend his title against Knight later tonight.Backstage, Dominik Mysterio - who is walking alongside his Judgment Day stablemates encounters Dragon Lee, and after a confrontation, they have a match set for later tonight.The opening match for tonight saw Rusev and Sheamus come together for a chaotic fight. It was intense from the beginning, as both men wanted this rematch to assert their dominance over the other. The match, though, ended in a draw after a Double Count Out. But both men were unwilling to let go of each other until the very end, and even then, the two continued until officials had to break them up before things could escalate even further.The next match of the night is Penta vs. Grayson Waller, and as soon as the bell rings, they both are ready. Grayson Waller starts off by shoving Penta, while the latter goes for a waist-lock. The audience sees them trading knees before hitting a double clothesline. Penta then goes for a handspring followed by a Mexican Destroyer, and finally with a corkscrew flip piledriver, Penta gets a pin and win.As the current winners of the WWE Women's Tag Team Championship, Charlotte Flair and Alexa Bliss , walk in together to celebrate their victory. But soon enough, the Judgment Day duo of Raquel Rodriguez and Roxanne Perez interrupt to challenge the Alliance of Convenience. They get the permission from Pearce for an official fight, but Flair and Bliss make quick work of their opponents. And after Bliss hits a Sister Abigail on Perez, it's an easy win to retain their championship.Backstage, Iyo Sky is seen chatting with the Kabuki Warriors in Japanese before Rhea Ripley comes in, asking to talk to her. She said she knows Iyo went to Adam Pearce to get a singles rematch, and Iyo reminds her that she wasn't the one who got pinned. To this, Ripley said nothing would make her happier than Iyo beating Naomi in a singles match so that Mami can come for Iyo herself. Iyo just answers cheekily that she would never be able to beat her before walking away.Elsewhere, Bayley is seen waiting for Lyra Valkyria, who essentially lost the match against Becky Lynch at Summerslam after getting knocked off by Bayley. The latter tries to apologize, but Valkyria is having none of it and walks off without saying more.Dominik Mysterio goes for the first hit, but it's Dragon Lee who seems to have more power in this fight. But don't underestimate Dirty Dom, who chokes Lee on the middle rope and goes for a 619. Though Lee dodged that and almost gained the upper hand on his opponent, the appearance of not one but three El Grande Americanos led him to be confused, and taking advantage of this confusion, Mysterio got his pin and win. Becky Lynch comes in after her win against Lyra Valkyria at SummerSlam to address the audience, saying she is open to new competition. And just then a familiar music plays and in walks Nikki Bella. They exchange a couple of jabs, as Nikki calls Lynch a disappointment. Lynch finally had had enough of the Hall of Famer, and walked off the stage, but not before sucker punching Bella.Backstage, Naomi was interviewed about her big win at Summerslam, where she revealed that next week, she has a one-on-one fight with Iyo Sky. Just then, Stephanie Vaquer comes in to remind Naomi that Vaquer will be challenging a title at Clash in Paris, no matter who is holding the belt. Naomi says it will be her.Elsewhere, Becky Lynch, after her confrontation on stage with Nikki Bella, encounters Natalya and her Alpha Academy. Natalya challenges The Man for a match, and though she accepts, it's not against Neidhart but Maxxine Dupri.Finally, the stage is set for the last match of the night - Seth Rollins vs. LA Knight. After challenging the current and brand new World Heavyweight Champion, Seth Rollins, and having the fight made official by RAW GM, Adam Pearce, Knight is finally on stage to face his opponent. It's pretty intense from the beginning, and Rollins looks like he is in control of the situation. Knight is taking on hits, and would have taken more if CM Punk had not jumped the barricade to attack The Visionary.Everyone is here, The Vision attacks CM Punk for attacking Rollins as Bron Breakker comes running in like a bull to hit Punk with a Spear. LA Knight is also hit in the process. The Vision are the winners of the night, but oh well! None other than Roman Reigns is here. He takes out both Bronson Reed and Breakker as Rollins watches from inside the ring. It doesn't take long for The Vision to destroy Reigns though, while Heyman watches from the sideline with satisfaction. The night comes to an end.Also Read: WWE Summerslam 2025 Night 2 (Aug 3, 2025) Quick Highlights: List of All Winners, Top Performers, and More","The August 4th episode of Monday Night RAW was going to see the aftermath of the Biggest Party of the Summer, and that is exactly what fans got.

Brock Lesnar returns to WWE at SummerSlam 2025



Undisputed WWE Championship, Street Fight: John Cena vs. Cody Rhodes was action-packed



Brock Lesnar has been a topic of discussion before every main event in WWE , amid his absence, with speculation of his return to the roster always imminent. Now, the Beast has ended all the speculation once and for all, as he made his big return to the company to deliver an F5 to John Cena , teasing a future fight between the two WWE veterans.In a shocking twist at the end of WWE SummerSlam 2025 – Night 2, Brock Lesnar made his thunderous return to WWE, ending months of speculation about his future. Just moments after Cody Rhodes defeated John Cena in a brutal, action-packed Street Fight to win the Undisputed WWE Championship, Lesnar stormed the scene. He circled the ring like a predator before hoisting Cena onto his shoulders and planting him with a devastating F5.For nearly a year, Lesnar had been absent from WWE programming, fueling rumors about retirement or a possible departure. His name had surfaced in the Janel Grant lawsuit involving Vince McMahon, leading WWE’s top legal brass to pull him from television. As reported by Dave Meltzer, the decision came “at the highest level of the company’s legal department” (per wrestlingnews.co). But with his appearance at MetLife Stadium on August 4, Lesnar reignited his long-time rivalry targeting Cena.The crowd erupted in disbelief as Lesnar's music hit.Cena, still recovering from his emotional torch-passing moment with Rhodes, didn’t see it coming. Lesnar's F5 was a challenge thrown at WWE legend’s legacy.SummerSlam 2025’s second night was already stacked with six championship matches, and the main event did not disappoint. Cody Rhodes and John Cena delivered a violent masterpiece of near-falls, finishers, and raw emotion. Cena used crutches from NBA star Tyrese Haliburton as weapons. Rhodes answered with classic Dusty-style offense, including the Bionic Elbow. Tables shattered. Steel steps flew. Fans were on the edge of their seats when Cena countered a title shot attempt and nearly sealed it with a super AA.But in the end, it was Rhodes who overcame the odds, surviving multiple Attitude Adjustments and finally hitting a flying Cross Rhodes through a table for the pin. Cena, in a rare display of humility, handed over the title and whispered heartfelt words to the new champion.Also Read: WWE SummerSlam 2025 crowd turns hostile as camera caught wild fight between women breaks out during Night Two As fans thought the night had reached its emotional peak, Lesnar's return altered the narrative. “The Beast” didn’t need words, as with his silence, the F5 said it all.

Public relations risk keeps teams like Oilers away from Carter Hart amid unresolved eligibility

The NHL future of Carter Hart remains shrouded in uncertainty, even after his acquittal in the high-profile Hockey Canada sexual assault case. While fans continue to debate whether the former Philadelphia Flyers goalie deserves another shot on the ice, NHL insider Elliotte Friedman has strongly advised against making any assumptions.Five members of Canada’s 2018 world junior hockey team were found not guilty of sexual assault, ending months-long trial that has garnered national attention since it began in April. Michael McLeod, Carter Hart, Alex Formenton, Dillon Dubé and Cal Foote were acquitted of all charges by Ontario Superior Court Justice Maria Carroccia.Speaking on his 32 Thoughts podcast, Elliotte Friedman addressed the growing speculation around Hart’s potential return to the league. Despite being found not guilty along with four other players in the 2018 Hockey Canada case, Hart’s status remains unresolved in the eyes of the NHL.“I think it is really irresponsible to speculate until we have a legal ruling on this,” Friedman said. “I don’t think anything more needs to be said about that until we know if they're eligible to play. I just don't think it's smart to speculate on where they could play.”The NHL has made it clear that acquittal does not equate to reinstatement.The league released a statement acknowledging that the players’ behavior—though not criminally punishable—was still “very disturbing” and “unacceptable.” The league added that it would be “reviewing and considering the judge's findings” before making any decisions about eligibility.While Hart is technically an unrestricted free agent, teams are hesitant. Analyst Avry Lewis-McDougall shut down rumors linking Hart to the Edmonton Oilers during the Fanatics View Hockey Show, stating bluntly: “It’s a hard no.” He cited both the unresolved nature of Hart’s status and the inevitable media firestorm.“Teams don’t want the PR headache,” he said. “You should be looking at somebody you can bring in with less baggage.”With the Oilers needing a reliable goalie after two consecutive Stanley Cup Final losses, Lewis-McDougall emphasized that Hart’s off-ice issues make him an unsuitable option—even if he’s cleared to return.For now, Carter Hart’s road back to the NHL remains a legal, ethical, and reputational maze.Also Read: “Keep it real and sensible”: Carey Price’s wife Angela responds to Sydney Sweeney’s American Eagle ad backlash","NHL insider Elliotte Friedman says it's 'irresponsible' to speculate on Carter Hart's future.

Michael Jordan still respected by LeBron James, despite GOAT talk

A surprising idea involving two of basketball's biggest legends - LeBron James and Michael Jordan - has sparked interest online. Fans of both players have argued for years about who is the greatest of all time. Now, a new idea has brought the debate back in a fun way. But things didn’t turn out the way people expected.On August 2, YouTuber Jimmy Donaldson, also called Mr. Beast, shared a fun idea during a live video. He said, “What if we got LeBron James and Michael Jordan to play 1-on-1, but we make it harder for LeBron somehow?” He was talking casually with fans. He compared it to a video where soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo played a fan for $1 million.The clip spread fast on social media like X and Instagram. Fans started thinking about how that match could look. Mr. Beast also said it would never really happen. He added, “They would never do it, but imagine if we could.”Michael Jordan is now 62 years old. He retired in 2003 after playing with the Washington Wizards. LeBron James is 40. He just finished his 22nd season with the Los Angeles Lakers. In June 2025, he was picked for the All-NBA Second Team.This age gap of 22 years is likely why Mr. Beast suggested a handicap-like using only one hand or playing barefoot-for LeBron James.LeBron James, who is preparing for the 2025-2026 NBA season, has never directly called himself the GOAT. But after winning four championships, being selected to 20 All-Star games, and leading in career scoring, many believe his resume stands above the rest.Michael Jordan’s fans argue that his perfect 6–0 record in the NBA Finals makes him the true GOAT. The debate has no official answer, and both players have spoken highly of each other in public. In 2020, LeBron told ESPN, “I grew up watching Michael. He made me love the game. I’ll always respect him.”Mr. Beast’s idea will probably never become a real game. But many people enjoyed thinking about a one-on-one match between the two famous players. He talked about it first on August 2 during his live video. So far, neither LeBron James nor Michael Jordan has said anything about it.","YouTuber Jimmy Donaldson, also called Mr. Beast, shared a fun idea during a live video.

Source: X

What did Randi Mahomes say about Patrick Mahomes' injuries?

Some of the NFL’s most promising players have often lost good months from their peak seasons due to injuries; even a minor injury can keep an NFL player away for at least a couple of weeks, during which they can miss matches. In certain cases, a long-term injury can throw a player’s career into question and often brings his position within a team into question.Recently, Randi Mahomes, Patrick Mahomes’ mom opened up about the anxieties she experiences around not just her son’s health but also that of the players in his team Kansas City Chiefs. In 2022, Mahomes suffered an ankle sprain in the AFC Divisional Round matchup against the Jacksonville Jaguars and suffered a high ankle sprain in 2024. However, none of his injuries have been big enough to take a major toll on his career or performance.Randi recently spoke about her feelings in a video. “Let me tell you as a mom, still to this day, it’s hard for me to watch the football games completely. I’m pacing and I’m playing with grandkids. I’m doing anything I can do not to just focus on every single play because it is a fear that I have. I don’t normally like speak about it, but at the same time, I keep thinking it will get easier to watch,” she said.She further added, “We had injuries. So it’s something that I always tell to like -Focus on your body, listen to your body. Listen to your coaches and doctors. Also, football is a contact sport, and it’s something that I’ve accepted.”Patrick Mahomes has a history of fighting through injuries. The quarterback suffered an ankle injury during the Monday Night Football clash against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in November. Coach Andy Reid told Mahomes he was taking him out of the game. Mahomes said he felt pain in his ankle when he planted his left foot on the slippery tuft. However, Mahomes stood his ground and returned and was able to bounce back fairly quickly.","Randi Mahomes, Patrick Mahomes’ mom opened up about the anxieties she experiences around not just her son’s health but also that of the players in his team Kansas City Chiefs.

From trade demands to GIFs — how the standoff spiralled online

Why Jerry Jones believes losing leverage is worse than losing Micah Parsons

Dez Bryant erupts, fans protest, but Jerry Jones stays silent

What this means for the future of player power

For Jerry Jones, the Micah Parsons standoff isn’t just a contract dispute — it’s a defining moment in his reign as the most hands-on owner in American sports. The 82-year-old Cowboys patriarch is once again locking horns with a superstar over money, control, and principle. But insiders say this time feels different — and far more personal. Jones isn’t just trying to win a deal; he’s trying to defend the Cowboy way.According to USA TODAY Sports, Micah Parsons has already delivered his message to the top: “I no longer want to be here.” The All-Pro linebacker’s frustration stems from Jones freezing out his agent and dragging out contract talks, despite Parsons seeking a deal worth $35 million annually. While his camp waits, the linebacker dropped a cryptic “One Last Time” GIF on social media — and sparked a media firestorm Dallas hasn’t seen since the Dez Bryant days.Sources say Jones has made one thing clear to his inner circle: “We’re not trading Micah Parsons — period.” It’s the same no-nonsense approach he took during Emmitt Smith’s 1993 holdout, only this time, social media and public opinion are louder. “If I pay Micah that money,” he reportedly argued, “then I have to pay CeeDee [Lamb] and others too.”The billionaire sees this as more than cap math — it’s about who sets the rules in Dallas.When Jones publicly referenced former stars like Dez Bryant to justify his position, the fallout was immediate. “I’m about to expose the unfair s**t… Don’t gaslight me,” Bryant wrote on X. Meanwhile, fan protests outside training camp have erupted under the hashtag #PayParsons. Yet Jones hasn’t blinked. Multiple sources say he told staff, “If Micah misses camp, fine. I’m not backing down.” His gamble? That time — and pressure — will wear Parsons down.As the NFL enters a new era of player branding, media leverage, and agent-driven negotiations, Jones’ playbook is being tested. In a league where top stars double as global influencer-assets, holding the line could cost the Cowboys far more than stats. But for Jones, this is about legacy, not just leverage. “I won’t be strong-armed,” he reportedly said. That’s the message from the top of Cowboys Nation — and it’s one that could reshape the locker room, the fanbase, and the season ahead.Also read: Dez Bryant drops bombshell Nicki Minaj tease in explosive Jerry Jones feud — NFL and Barbz fans go wild","Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones is locked in a contract dispute with linebacker Micah Parsons.

Golden State Warriors reached three other players while stalemating Jonathan Kuminga

The Golden State Warriors and Jonathan Kuminga, a restricted free agent, are still at odds. His contract demands have caused their negotiations to stall for more than a month. However, analyst Shannon Sharpe contended that coach Steve Kerr's lack of faith in Kuminga is the primary reason for his wish to leave in the first place. During those four seasons with the Warriors, Kuminga believes his career has been hampered.In order to maximize wins, Warriors coach Steve Kerr justified his decision to limit Jonathan Kuminga's playoff playing time in favor of veterans like Draymond Green, Jimmy Butler, and Stephen Curry. After Curry's hamstring injury, Kerr only expanded Kuminga's role. However, he openly questioned the forward's suitability, calling his style ""ball-dominant"" even though Kuminga averaged an outstanding 24.3 points on 55.4% shooting in his final four playoff games.On the ""Nightcap"" podcast, analyst Shannon Sharpe identified Kerr's handling as the main cause of Kuminga's annoyance, arguing that it has encouraged the young to pursue a trade. Sharpe's perspective supports ESPN's Shams Charania's assertion that Kuminga views Sacramento as an opportunity to gain more respect and career control.The 2021 No. 7 pick is seeking an annual salary of approximately $30 million, while the Warriors have offered a two-year, $45 million deal, which he rejected, according to ESPN’s Shams Charania.Frustrated, Kuminga is now exploring sign-and-trade options, with a strong interest in joining the Sacramento Kings, who are offering a starting role, per ESPN’s Marc J. Spears. However, no trade proposal has yet satisfied Golden State’s expectations, prolonging the impasse.The Golden State Warriors have allegedly signed verbal commitments with Al Horford, Gary Payton II, and De'Anthony Melton during free agency, as per recent news. The signings are expected to strengthen the team's defense, offense, as well as bench depth, supporting their postseason ambitions. But the signings are not possible until the Warriors finalize the contract with forward Jonathan Kuminga, whose future is still in doubt.This issue is a major challenge. The team must deal with Kuminga's contract before they can officially sign the new players. The delay affects the Warriors' salary cap flexibility and roster planning, putting their summer strategy on hold. The possible additions of Horford, Payton, and Melton indicate a strong effort to improve the team. However, Kuminga’s unresolved status is still a key factor in determining the team’s short-term and long-term future.Also read:","The Golden State Warriors and Jonathan Kuminga, a restricted free agent, are still at odds.

According to reports, Jonathan Kuminga won't be leaving the Golden State Warriors this offseason. One of the most prominent stories in the NBA this summer has been the restricted free agency. In order to secure a bigger position, he has been seeking a contract worth at least $25 million every season. However, Tim Kawakami of the San Francisco Standard reported that the NBA icon will be on the Golden State Warriors' roster to start the season and that the franchise has no plans to trade him this summer.Jonathan Kuminga, a restricted free agent who has yet to sign, has put the Golden State Warriors in a difficult position this offseason . Due to the team's ability to tie up their funds in order to simply match the offer, other teams have been hesitant to make the NBA player a big deal.The notion of a sign-and-trade has surfaced in recent weeks as most teams no longer have the budget capacity to sign the young forward outright. However, it seems like everything is at a halt and there has been no talk about it. As the summer wears on, Jonathan Kuminga's desire to leave the team is beginning to lose its appeal.Tim Kawakami further claimed that the G.S. Warriors are hesitant to sell the player this summer. Although he had been insisting on a trade out the door, it appears like the two parties will eventually reach a decision. The NBA forward has two options for returning to the G.S.Warriors, according to Kawakami.He can either accept the team's offer or accept Golden State's $7.9 million that the team extended to him. He further wrote:“But several sources have indicated that the Warriors have been unenthusiastic about the general idea of a Kuminga sign-and-trade from the outset. The broad context is that Joe Lacob remains a fan of Kuminga’s and is determined to either keep the 22-year-old on the roster or get real value in return. And he’s willing to wait it out.”Although Jonathan Kuminga and the team have stated their desire to split ways this summer, he will undoubtedly remain with Golden State Warriors if they are unable to locate a sign-and-trade alternative that suits them. Additionally, according to reports, he hasn't yet received an offer from his existing team that he likes.Also read: Jonathan Kuminga rejects Golden State Warriors’ $45M offer amid ongoing restricted free agency talks",Jonathan Kuminga is a restricted free agent who has yet to sign with a team.

Not only did he highlight his trademark physicality and defensive role, but Jack Berglund also laid to rest the one question mark on his resume: his offensive ceiling.Philadelphia Flyers prospect posted five goals and two assists in five games, with three even-strength and two power-play scores. He started the tournament with a glove-side right circle bullet off Team USA Blue and finished his showcase career with a power play tip against Finland, a game in which tension was running high and Jack Berglund was involved in numerous scrums.Jack Berglund wasn't the only Philadelphia Flyers forward prospect to impress at the Summer Showcase. Heikki Ruohonen was often matched up against Jack Berglund in the series with Sweden and played equally well on offense and defense. His sole score was in the closing game against Sweden when he scored an opening-minute, sharp-angle goal. Finland lost, but Ruohonen had exhibited the poise, IQ, and adaptability that made him a 2025 World Junior Championship sensation.Heikki Ruohonen's development continues to amaze Flyers developmental personnel, particularly now that he soon will start his NCAA career.Also read: Who is Devon Levi?

Pittsburgh Penguins connection puts Toronto Maple Leafs' Nick Robertson firmly on NHL trade radar

“He’s a guy people are watching closely. There’s interest, it just depends on fit and what Toronto is looking for in return,”

Columbus Blue Jackets trade idea gains traction, but deal needs more from Toronto Maple Leafs to move Nick Robertson

Despite avoiding arbitration and signing a fresh one-year, $1.825 million contract with the Toronto Maple Leafs, Nick Robertson’s name remains in the NHL trade rumor mill. As per Elliotte Friedman on the, both the Pittsburgh Penguins and Columbus Blue Jackets are keeping tabs on the 23-year-old winger, whose future in Toronto remains uncertain due to the team’s crowded forward group, ongoing cap challenges, and questions surrounding his long-term role and development within the organization’s current competitive window.Friedman highlighted the Pittsburgh Penguins as a logical suitor for Robertson, mainly due to team president Kyle Dubas, formerly Toronto’s GM and the executive who originally drafted Robertson in 2019. While Robertson is signed for the upcoming season, Friedman noted that Toronto is still looking to make at least one more move to address its cap situation and forward surplus.Friedman said.Given Pittsburgh’s need to inject youth into its aging roster and Dubas’s familiarity with Robertson’s upside, a deal could make sense for both sides, especially if Toronto seeks depth or defensive reinforcement in return.Robertson has also been loosely linked to the Columbus Blue Jackets, with fans and insiders suggesting a possible one-for-one swap involving winger Yegor Chinakhov. While Chinakhov has requested a trade and possesses top-six potential, Friedman noted the Leafs would likely need to sweeten the deal, as a straight swap doesn’t currently interest Columbus.Chinakhov, 23, scored seven goals in 30 games last season and remains a developing asset. Friedman emphasized that Leafs GM Brad Treliving is actively exploring trade possibilities and may look for a more balanced return if Robertson is moved.Adding intrigue, Toronto remains linked to unsigned free agent Jack Roslovic, who coincidentally finished last season with Columbus and is drawing interest from at least five NHL teams. While unrelated directly to Robertson, any forward addition would further crowd Toronto’s depth chart.Whether it's the Penguins or Blue Jackets, Nick Robertson’s situation with the Toronto Maple Leafs is far from settled. With trade buzz intensifying and roster changes still likely, the winger’s future will be one to monitor closely as the 2025–26 season approaches.Also Read: Toronto Maple Leafs re-sign Nicholas Robertson to one-year, $1.825M contract to avoid arbitration","Nick Robertson avoided arbitration and signed a fresh one-year, $1.825 million contract with the Toronto Maple Leafs.

LTIR could impact Panthers roster and cap flexibility

Florida Panthers forward Matthew Tkachuk has never been one to back down from a challenge—and during the 2025 NHL Playoffs, he proved just how far he’d go to help his team win. Despite nursing a torn adductor muscle and a sports hernia, the 27-year-old powered through the postseason with sheer grit.Following the Panthers’ Stanley Cup win, all eyes turned to Tkachuk’s health. With surgery still pending, Sportsnet’s Elliotte Friedman shared a blunt assessment during his 32 Thoughts podcast: “I think we’re gonna find out at some point here that Tkachuk will miss the start of the season.” He added, “I think he’ll be back in time for the Olympics… and it was always going to be set up that way.”The 2026 Winter Olympics in Milano-Cortina are fast approaching, and Team USA will be banking on Tkachuk’s return by February. But this optimistic projection hinges on the timeline of his surgery—one that’s already been delayed due to his July 19 wedding to longtime partner Ellie Connell.NHL insider Evan Renaerts added fuel to the speculation, revealing that “Matthew Tkachuk has not yet undergone the surgery.” The delayed procedure could land him on Long-Term Injured Reserve (LTIR), a move that carries both risk and reward.While Tkachuk’s absence would be a blow to the Panthers’ early season form, his $9.5 million cap hit on LTIR could free up space to retain key depth players like Evan Rodrigues.The Panthers, currently $3 million over the salary cap, could benefit in the short term—but it’s a gamble. If the injury sidelines Tkachuk longer than expected, it not only jeopardizes Florida’s momentum but also threatens Team USA’s Olympic medal hopes.Also Read: Connor McDavid Trade Bombshell to the Bruins: NHL insiders say it could guarantee a Stanley Cup win Fans and analysts alike are left asking: is the chase for Olympic gold worth risking long-term health and a crucial NHL season?",Matthew Tkachuk has not yet undergone surgery for a torn adductor muscle and sports hernia.

With Jayson Tatum sidelined due to an Achilles injury and multiple key departures from the frontcourt, the team is facing a depth crisis at center - potentially opening the door for former San Antonio Spurs big man Boston Celtics ’ 2024 championship-winning frontcourt has been dismantled in the past few months:• Kristaps Porzingis was moved in a cost-cutting trade.• Veteran Al Horford is unlikely to return.• Luke Kornet signed with the San Antonio Spurs in free agency.The current replacements - Neemias Queta, Luka Garza, and Xavier Tillman - have limited experience in extended starting roles, raising concerns about the team’s rim protection and rebounding.Charles Bassey, entering his fifth NBA season, has emerged as a potential solution after impressing during the Summer League. Across three games, he posted:According to Noa Dalzell of CelticsBlog, “It remains to be seen whether the Celtics end up having the cap space, or sufficient interest, to sign Charles Bassey. But, contrary to previous reports, sources say Bassey is currently not planning on playing in Europe next season.And, Boston is a destination he is particularly fond of.”The Boston Celtics currently have one open roster spot, but signing Bassey would push them over the NBA’s second apron - a tax threshold the team has worked to avoid. The front office moved Porzingis and Jrue Holiday partly to maintain financial flexibility, but further moves may be needed.One possible route is a cost-cutting trade involving Anfernee Simons, which could free up the space needed to bring Charles Bassey aboard.While Bassey has garnered attention from overseas clubs, his preference is to remain in the NBA. His familiarity with Boston’s system from the Summer League, coupled with the team’s immediate need for size and defensive presence, makes this a mutually beneficial possibility - if the financial puzzle can be solved.Also read: Los Angeles Lakers’ Luka Doncic Could Be Headed Toward Historic $418 Million Deal After Massive Extension If Boston clears the cap space, Bassey’s combination of rebounding, shot-blocking, and energy off the bench could bolster a thin frontcourt.

Risks the Lakers Are Willing to Take

What This Means for the Future of NBA Contracts

Themay have just secured their future - and possibly set the stage for the most lucrative contract in sports history - by locking in Luka Doncic as the face of the franchise. Fresh off signing a three-year, $165 million extension, Doncic is now on track to become eligible for a record-shattering five-year, $418 million payday in just a few years.When the Los Angeles Lakers pulled off a stunning midseason trade for Doncic last February, it sent shockwaves through the NBA. It was the franchise’s most ambitious move since signing LeBron James . In his first 28 games wearing purple and gold, Doncic averaged 28.2 points, 8.1 rebounds, and 7.5 assists - instantly proving he was more than just a marquee acquisition. Fans quickly embraced him as the team’s next superstar leader.On August 2, 2025, Lakers President Rob Pelinka announced Luka Doncic’s three-year, $165 million extension, complete with a player option for 2028. This structure allows him to become a free agent after his tenth NBA season.“This is just the beginning,” Pelinka said. Doncic echoed the optimism, saying he was excited to build something special in Los Angeles.The celebration was pure Hollywood—Lakers staff threw a surprise Las Vegas party for Doncic, featuring his favorite band, the Backstreet Boys, creating a viral moment among fans.The extension was carefully designed. By choosing a two-plus-one format—two guaranteed years plus a player option—Luka Doncic aligns his free agency with eligibility for the NBA’s 10-year veteran maximum contract.With salary cap projections pointing upward, that next deal could reach $418 million over five years, making him the first NBA player to earn close to $80 million in a single season and nearly $1 million per game in its final year.When Luka Doncic becomes a 10-year veteran, he’ll also be eligible to negotiate a full no-trade clause—a rare privilege in the NBA. This would give him complete control over his future and ensure the Los Angeles Lakers remain his team unless he decides otherwise. For Los Angeles, it’s a commitment to building their identity entirely around him in the post-LeBron era.Of course, the plan carries risks. Doncic must stay healthy and maintain elite production for the next three years to command such a historic deal. But if everything goes right, the payoff is enormous—both in championships and in cementing his place as one of the league’s most marketable global stars. Reactions From LeBron James and Laker NationLeBron James welcomed the extension with a personal FaceTime call, telling Luka Doncic, “Luka has been my favorite player in the NBA for a while now.” Fans have flooded social media with excitement, envisioning a new era of “Showtime” basketball led by Doncic.If Doncic’s projected mega-deal becomes reality, it could set a new benchmark for superstar contracts across the NBA. The ripple effects could reshape free agency negotiations and redefine what’s possible for elite athlete earnings.Also read: Why Los Angeles Lakers’ $16 Million Gamble on Deandre Ayton Could Be the Key to a Championship Run My Verdict on the Contract: The Start of a New Lakers Dynasty?The Los Angeles Lakers’ decision to secure Luka Doncic wasn’t just about the present—it was about building a long-term path toward dominance.

The’ dream of pairingwith Stephen Curry and Jimmy Butlerisn’t dead yet. According to a fresh update from NBA insider Shams Charania, the two-time MVP has not made a final decision about his future in Milwaukee, keeping trade rumors alive across the league.The Golden State Warriors have been closely monitoring situations around the league where stars might become available. They reportedly did the same when Jimmy Butler sought a way out of Miami, aiming to maintain roster and cap flexibility in case an elite player wanted to join their championship core.Giannis, who averaged over 30 points per game last season, has long been one of the most coveted names in Warriors trade discussions. The team has been linked to the Milwaukee Bucks star for years, though no deal has materialized.In a recent ESPN report, Charania shared the latest on Giannis’ offseason mindset: “Sources tell me there is nothing set in stone about whether Giannis Antetokounmpo wants to stay in Milwaukee or whether he wants to leave elsewhere. He’s been evaluating his future this entire offseason. I reported… he’s open-minded about whether his best fit is in Milwaukee or is it a trade elsewhere. That process has been continuing.”This statement confirms what many in the NBA have suspected - Giannis is weighing his options, leaving a narrow but real window for teams like the Golden State Warriors to make a move.While the possibility exists, it remains unlikely unless Giannis specifically names Golden State as his preferred destination. Multiple franchises could potentially outbid the Warriors with more attractive assets.Possible reasons why a deal would be difficult for Golden State:• Limited high-value draft picks compared to rebuilding teams• Established stars like Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green are unlikely trade pieces• Competitive offers from other contenders or rebuilding teams with young talentDespite the long odds, the Golden State Warriors may continue to keep their cap sheet and roster flexible. The organization understands that landing a player of Giannis’ caliber could transform their championship window and extend Stephen Curry ’s prime.Also read: Why Los Angeles Lakers are Urged to Target $109 Million Golden State Warriors Superstar After Luka Doncic Contract Extension For Golden State, the calculus is simple - even a slim chance at Giannis Antetokounmpo is worth preserving flexibility.

We’ll see where that goes.”But if Allen’s playing status was uncertain, his emotional connection with the fans—especially the youngest ones—was crystal clear.After every practice, Allen is typically swarmed by fans hoping for a selfie or autograph.Although time limits prevent him from reaching everyone, he always tries to prioritize children. That commitment came full circle on Monday when he found himself grinning ear to ear after spotting two young, familiar faces.Annabella, 10, and Blake, 12—two Champion kids from Oishei Children’s Hospital—surprised Allen during the post-practice session. And this time, it was Allen who turned into the excited fan.The encounter wasn’t random. Allen has had a deep bond with the hospital, having created the Patricia Allen Fund in memory of his grandmother. The kids had also worked closely with Allen last season, helping to design his custom cleats for the NFL’s ""My Cause, My Cleats"" campaign.Seeing them again was clearly a highlight for the reigning MVP. After taking selfies and signing posters, Annabella beamed and yelled into the mic, “Go Bills! Thank you for everything!”In a sport often dominated by stats and scores, moments like these remind us why players like Josh Allen stand out—not just for their talent, but for their heart.Also Read: Bill Simmons throws cold water on Tom Brady and Sofia Vergara marriage rumors as social media frenzy cools down","Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen surprised by two special young fans.

Bill Simmons casts doubt on Tom Brady and Sofia Vergara romance

“Is This Real?” NFL Questions and Summer Scuttlebutt With Dianna Russini | The Bill Simmons Podcast

Eyewitnesses and insiders say there was “zero spark” at celebrity yacht party



Sofia Vergara's Ibiza outings and Tom Brady’s summer travels suggest separate paths

Rumors of a budding romance between Tom Brady and Sofía Vergara have captured headlines, but sports media veteran Bill Simmons isn’t buying the hype. On his podcast, Simmons shared his doubts about any serious connection, calling it early-stage speculation and questioning whether there’s real chemistry behind the celebrity buzz.Speculation around a potential whirlwind romance between NFL legend Tom Brady and Modern Family star Sofía Vergara continues to swirl, but not everyone is buying the buzz. Sports media icon Bill Simmons shared his unfiltered take on the rumored couple during the latest episode of The Bill Simmons Podcast, stating plainly, “I don’t think it’s worked. I don’t think they’re getting engaged. I think they’re in the early stages. ”The comments came just 26 days after tabloids erupted with reports that Brady and Vergara had sparked a “summer fling,” thanks to viral yacht photos from early July. But despite the buzz, Simmons’ skepticism mirrors growing doubts about the legitimacy of the relationship.The viral Brady-Vergara yacht moment that fueled speculation may not have been as intimate as it appeared. Eyewitnesses told Yahoo Sports that the two barely interacted, much less exchanged numbers.Celebrity columnist Rob Shuter quoted insiders who confirmed the lack of chemistry: “It was simply two celebrities at the same table.”Adding to the confusion, a tabloid rumor alleging that Brady dismissed Vergara for being “too old” was swiftly shot down. In a statement issued via E! Online, Brady’s rep called the story “pure fiction.”Post-divorce, both stars have led high-profile but distinct lives. Brady has been busy co-parenting, globe-trotting with his kids, and deepening his involvement in sports ownership, business ventures, and a new broadcasting career with Fox. He’s also set to be honored with a 12-foot statue at Gillette Stadium on August 9—a massive moment in his post-playing legacy.Meanwhile, Sofía Vergara has been spotted with businessman Douglas Chabbott, attending concerts in Ibiza and celebrating her birthday surrounded by friends, not NFL icons.Also Read: “Gisele is a bit hot-headed”: Insiders blow the lid off Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen’s toxic marriage While the rumors made headlines, Bill Simmons may have nailed what most are now thinking: the Brady-Vergara buzz may have been more flash than flame.","Bill Simmons says he doesn't think Tom Brady and Sofia Vergara are engaged.

Former England captain Graham Gooch believes the intense five-match Test series between India and England is crucial for the future of Test cricket, while expressing concerns about the format's sustainability if it remains dominated by just the ""big three"" nations - India, England, and Australia. Speaking on the sidelines of the fifth Test in London, the 72-year-old cricket legend emphasized the need for the ICC to support financially weaker cricket nations to ensure Test cricket's survival beyond the major powers.The current trend shows most Test cricket being played between India, England, and Australia in five-match series, while financially weaker nations like West Indies, South Africa, and New Zealand typically participate in shorter two or three-match series.""I think the ICC needs to look at Test cricket and need to look at how they can support the less financially well-off countries. I won't say smaller countries, but less financially (well off),"" Gooch told PTI.""Because you've got to preserve Test cricket. You can't just play three teams. If other teams, like New Zealand, West Indies, South Africa, play less and less Test cricket, no one will have anyone to play against.So they've got to support the game on a whole,"" said Gooch, who scored 8900 Test runs for England.Gooch praised the quality of cricket displayed in the current India-England series, noting its importance for the Test format."" It's been an amazing series and really, really good for Test Cricket. Because we know that franchise cricket is all over the place in the world and Test cricket is under pressure,"" Gooch stated.Despite the retirements of veteran players Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli , Gooch expressed confidence in India's new generation of cricketers.""Look, one door closes, another one opens. You can't expect, great players or any players to play on forever. There is a time when they decide that they've had enough or come to retirement or whatever. Those two players you mentioned, have been wonderful servants for India and for our great game. It's time for other people to step in. I think the young Indian players have done brilliantly,"" he remarked.Gooch particularly praised Indian captain Shubman Gill , who has scored 754 runs in the series, approaching Sunil Gavaskar's all-time Indian record.""The captain's an outstanding player. I think his technique is superb. His concentration and his temperament over this series has been brilliant. You've got to remember that your job, or his job, is to score runs. He's not put in the team just to be captain. He's in the team to score runs,"" Gooch commented.The former England captain addressed England's dependence on Ben Stokes , whose absence in the final Test affected the team's bowling capabilities.""Stokes, to me, has been a phenomenon this season. I mean, he's a key player for England because he balances the side. If he doesn't play, England have to go a batsman down. And if they go a batsman down, we're not good enough to have four bowlers. We need five bowlers. To have a four-bowler bowling attack, in my opinion, you need two world-class bowlers. And England don't have that at the moment,"" he explained.Gooch drew parallels between Stokes and India's Mohammed Siraj for their dedicated bowling performances.""Siraj, I've got a lot of time for him. Very passionate, puts it in every time. And Ben Stokes is a similar sort of character. When he walks across the white line, he empties the tank. You understand what I mean by that. He doesn't leave anything behind. He gives it everything,"" Gooch said.Regarding the on-field tensions during the series, Gooch viewed them as natural outcomes of competitive cricket.""There's a lot of passion in international cricket when you're playing against a country, when the series is very competitive and very tight. And sometimes, tempers flare a little bit and things are said that maybe you regret. But, it all happens in the spur of the moment. And I think it's two teams going very hard at each other and trying to win the game.
