After England, Bangladesh marks your second Test series. How has the experience been so far?

You took a wicket off a no ball in your debut, but then went on to claim three wickets. Was it Rohit Sharma’s encouragement that motivated you during that time?

How challenging is it for a bowler to bounce back, especially after conceding a wicket due to a no ball?

Can you share the story of receiving a bat from Virat Kohli?

You’ve stepped in for Shami in the squad. Does replacing a senior player add extra pressure for you?

You’ve had the opportunity to share nets with Bumrah. What was that experience like?

How did you develop the art of reading batsmen?

NEW DELHI: Akash Deep was in his hotel room in Chennai during the opening Test against Bangladesh when he heard a knock on the door. To his surprise, it was Virat Kohli standing outside. The Indian batting star walked in, carrying a brand-new bat. “Bat chaiye kya tujhe?” (Do you need a bat?), Virat asked Akash.Taken aback by the unexpected gesture, Akash nodded eagerly, grateful for the precious gift.Handing over the bat, Virat said, “Yeh le, rakh le yeh bat.”Overwhelmed, Akash immediately took out a pen, requested an autograph on the bat, and gave Virat a hug.“I will never play with that bat. It’s a huge gift from Virat bhaiya, and I will keep it as a souvenir,” an elated Akash toldin an exclusive interview.The 27-year-old from Sasaram has been impressive in his brief Test career so far. He made his debut against England in Ranchi earlier this year, claiming three wickets in the match. In his second Test, Akash once again delivered, picking up two wickets against Bangladesh.caught up with Akash in an exclusive interview, where he spoke about the ongoing India-Bangladesh series, receiving the bat from Virat Kohli, his rapport with captain Rohit Sharma , sharing the nets with Jasprit Bumrah , and much more.The experience has been excellent so far. I have learned a lot. As a fast bowler, you need to adapt to any condition and situation, and that's how you learn. I decided to bowl the way I have been bowling; I didn't want to experiment or change anything. As fast bowlers, we need to assess the conditions and analyze the batsmen, and that’s what I do during the match. My focus is always on the batsman. I don't put extra burden on myself because it leads to pressure. I just try to stick to the basics and focus on the team's plans.India is not a team that adjusts its plans according to the opposition. They play with the same plan against any opponent. India always dominates. It doesn't matter whether they are facing England, New Zealand, Australia, or Bangladesh. We just want to go out and play cricket, no matter who we are playing against.I always say it is a matter of good fortune and luck to play under Rohit bhaiya. I consider myself lucky to play under him. He is a different kind of captain; I have never seen a captain like him. He is the best captain I have played under. He is just a cool and calm person. He keeps things so simple and easy for every player, not just for me. You will be amazed at how a player of Rohit's stature deals with a youngster like a friend and brother.I didn't feel bad at all when I took a wicket that was given as a no ball. What made me feel worse was that Zak Crawley hammered Siraj for 19 runs after two overs. I felt bad because my no ball allowed him to score those runs. But I had a belief that I would get him out; I had some plans in my mind. I eventually got rid of Crawley. I knew I would dismiss him, and I was confident. When I dismissed him, I felt so relieved and happy at the same time.Rohit bhaiya came forward and motivated me after that no ball. He said, 'Aage badh, hota rehta hai.' He asked me to leave that no ball behind and move forward. But as a bowler, you don't forget such incidents.Virat bhaiya ne khud se bat diya tha [Virat bhaiya himself gave me the bat]. He must have observed something about my batting. I didn't ask for it; he came to me and asked, 'Bat chaiye kya tujhe?' Who wouldn’t want a bat from Virat bhaiya? He is a legend. I was very happy to hear his words and wanted that bat. He asked me what kind of bat I use while batting, and I just smiled—I didn't have words. Then he said, 'Yeh le, rakh le yeh bat.' I will never play with that bat; it is a big gift from Virat bhaiya, and I will keep it as a souvenir on the wall of my room. I even got his autograph on the bat.Responsibility—that's what I feel in the absence of a veteran bowler. He has done a lot for the country, and it feels great to play in the place of such a great bowler. Fulfilling that role and performing is a big challenge, and I feel that responsibility. I want to repay the trust that the management, captain, seniors, and coaches have shown in me. I just want to follow the process, bowl in good areas, and take wickets for my team.I regularly talk to him and observe his bowling. Woh bilkul alag hain; bhagwan ne unhe alag hi banaya hai. I take a lot of tips from him and have learned a lot. I discussed 'mindset' with him and once asked him about the mindset while bowling to a particular batsman. He provided me with valuable tips and answers to my query.He is such a knowledgeable person, and that reflects in his bowling. His ability to read a batter before he bowls is amazing. He is a gifted bowler, and it’s not easy to follow in his footsteps.Every batsman plays in a different zone. His mindset will vary depending on when he plays, changing session by session and day by day. For example, a batsman may have an A mindset on Day 1 and a B mindset on Day 2. As bowlers, we need to keep track of that, analyze it, and bowl accordingly, because he is also analyzing us. After bowling three or four overs to him, we start to notice the mistakes he is making, and then I adjust my variations accordingly.In red ball cricket, I always focus on taking the batsman out of his comfort zone. I don’t bowl in areas where he is comfortable; I try to make him uncomfortable and force him into making a mistake. This is what I have learned in my career, especially in red ball cricket, so far.","Akash Deep made his Test debut against England in Ranchi earlier this year.

Bangladesh

found out the hard way

Will Kuldeep get a go?

CHENNAI: They are 17 going on 18, and the sound of music in the India camp is getting sweeter by the day.Barring Virat Kohli , R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja , none of the Indian players in the current set-up know what it is to lose a Test series at home.India have won 17 consecutive series since the loss to England in 2012, a phenomenal record.Even the opposition teams know they are virtually fighting a losing battle.In every conversation that the Bangladeshi players or support-staff had with the media over the last few days, the refrain was: ""Yes, we won in Pakistan, but Team India is a different kettle of fish.""Rohit wants to seal the World Test Championship Final berth before they leave for Australia and the first hurdle has been cleared with a resounding 280-run win against Bangladesh at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Sunday.Not just the margin of victory, it's the aura of this team playing at home that is quite incredible. It seems as if they want to increase the degree of difficulty themselves so that the team can be tested before the Australia series.In Chennai, they chose not to play on their favoured black-soil pitch despite having the best spin troika in the world. A red-soil pitch with decent bounce seemed good preparation for Australia and after being reduced to 144/6, the batting prowess of the two bowling allrounders Ashwin and Jadeja once again underlined India's depth.Virtually every box was ticked in Chennai barring two back-to-back low scores by the two superstars of Indian batting - Virat Kohli and Rohit. But all the others got runs and the five bowlers did what was expected of them.""It was a great result, looking at what lies ahead. We were playing after a while but were in touch with the game. It was important that we work as a group and that's what happened here as we got the win,"" Rohit said.There's hardly a grey area to worry about and it will be interesting to see what India's gameplan is for the Kanpur Test starting on Friday. There's a theory that Jasprit Bumrah shouldn't be overworked before Australia, but he has bowled only 21 overs in the first Test and there's no reason to rest him in Kanpur.If it is a black-soil pitch at the Green Park, there is a possibility that left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav will get a go. He was in magnificent form in the last Test series against England at home and can be a genuine wicket-taking option in Australia. If there's a chance of the ball turning a bit, the spinner should an ideal candidate in place of Akash Deep.Not that there's any reason to drop the Bengal pacer. He got two important wickets in the first innings and looked good with the new ball but the Indian team management should look to keep Kuldeep's morale high.","India have won 17 consecutive series since the loss to England in 2012.

Are Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli past their 'prime'?

NEW DELHI: Former Indian cricket captain Kapil Dev , famous for leading India to its first World Cup victory in 1983, believes a cricketer's prime years are between ages 26 and 34. Fitness then determines how long they can stay at the top.This insight is particularly relevant for celebrated players like Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli . Both have exceeded this age range. Kohli, turning 36 in November, and Rohit, who turned 37 in April, have retired from T20Is after their successful T20 World Cup campaign but remain active in other formats.Kapil shared his views on MyKhel, saying, ""In my opinion, the period between 26 and 34 years is your prime and thereafter the fitness of the players will ensure their longevity.""Kapil himself retired at 35 after an illustrious career, playing 131 Tests and 225 ODIs. He bagged 434 and 253 wickets in each format, respectively. He also had notable batting stats with 5248 runs in Tests and 3783 in ODIs.However, Kapil emphasized that retirement is a personal choice. He feels that as long as players maintain their fitness and enjoy the game, they should continue.He noted, "" Ravi Shastri retired at a very early age while Sachin Tendulkar had a longer stint. So it is completely up to the individual to decide their ways of life. My way of thinking is to stay fit and keep playing as long as you are enjoying the game.""Kapil's perspective sheds light on the career trajectories of modern players. He offers a guideline, yet acknowledges personal decisions.As Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli navigate their post-prime years, Kapil Dev's philosophy provides them, and fans, a framework for understanding their future career decisions.","Kapil Dev believes a cricketer's prime years are between ages 26 and 34.

He said, ""Look, I think every team has one or two of those players who can take the game on. We have Travis Head and Mitchell Marsh. I think with those guys, you know they're going to be aggressive.

That's just a part of who he is. We've become accustomed to it nowadays because some of those ridiculous shots are a bit more common.""He also emphasized Pant’s influence in the previous series against Australia, adding, ""He is someone who has had a big influence on a couple of series. Got to try to keep him quiet.""With both teams in form and preparing, the series promises intense competition.","Australian captain Pat Cummins highlights need to contain Indian wicketkeeper- batter Rishabh Pant.

"In Olympic year, India's big gold",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/chess/in-olympic-year-indias-big-gold/articleshow/113615980.cms,"TOI looks at some of the takeaways from the

Chess Olympiad

Honesty personified:

Divya's rise:

The New India:

Busting Swiss League myth:

The colours of domination:

Body language:

Carlsen skips again:

Make it count:

Gukesh 's striking form on the top board was easily the chess story of the Olympiad. He was the most sought-after player for selfies as players from other countries looked at him in awe at the closing ceremony.Yes, you can score 9/11 at a club-level tournament. Or even at a Closed IM event. But not at the Olympiad, not on the top board.It is not a surprise then that Gukesh's rating performance of Elo 3056 was surpassed only once in the history of chess - by Fabiano Caruana (3098) in the Sinquefield Cup 10 years ago. Vladimir Kramnik at his Olympiad debut in 1992 had amassed 8.5/9. But that was on the reserve board.The World Championship challenger is now debt free: Gukesh said at a press conference, ""This is a special win (team gold) for me because we came so close last time. And I had a personal debt to pay back. We could say that last time we could not win the team gold because of my mistake. Now, I think I have proved that it was just an accident and that I'm capable of more (good performances).""Gukesh pressed for win in the penultimate round against Nodirbek Abdusattorov of Uzbekistan in 2022 and went on to lose when a draw would have kept India in the hunt. His loss had cost India one match-point. Now, with two Olympiad gold in the bag, Gukesh looks ready and sharp for the World Ch'ship match against Ding Liren from Nov 25 in Singapore.Gukesh was asked at a FIDE conference what he rates higher: his Candidates victory that gave him a shot at the World crown, the Olympiad individual gold on the top board or the Olympiad team gold? He picked the Candidates win. Not surprising, because chess is an individual sport.With heavy scoring on the women's third board, Divya Deshmukh cemented her position as world No. 1 among junior girls (U-20) with a live rating of 2500-plus. She values the team gold more because rating can be increased any time! Former seven-time National champion Praveen Thipsay said, ""Divya's aim should be to become the women's world champion in two years.""When you are in the running for the team gold, the individual medal doesn't matter much. The Indian players experienced that, underlining how times have changed. In the 1990 Novi Sad Olympiad, Dibyendu Barua was in the running for the medal on the second board. The team decided to rest him for two of the last three rounds because the defeats would have hampered his prospects for an individual board prize. Barua was coach of the men's team this time.Men's team captain Srinath said India's 3.5-0.5 over Serbia in the fourth round indicated that this team was setting up well for a special performance. In the process, the team underlined that the randomness of Swiss League format (the pairings, timing of slipup etc) is no hindrance.Because if you win almost every match, you are relieved from contemplating on the fairness of final standings vis-a-vis real performance.When China had won the Olympiad gold in 2014, they too had lost just one game like India. But they had scored just 20 game wins. India scored 27 wins in 44 games. Still, India's performance may not count as the most flawless Olympiad performance ever. The 1968 and 1974 USSR teams did not lose a single game en route to their gold medals, playing 74 and 88 games respectively. Anand told Revsportz: ""During that time, the gap between the Soviets and others was that much bigger. But here the Indian players have outperformed their opponents who are in the similar rating bracket with comparable strength.""Judit Polgar observed the body language of this young men's Indian team. ""It was clear in India in 2022 that the new generation of boys is going to take over,"" she told Chessbase India stream. ""They were the big candidates to take the gold medal. The way the Indian boys were seated on their boards, it appeared that expectations motivated them more than putting them under pressure.""World No. 1 Magnus Carlsen had skipped the 11th and last round and the prize distribution ceremony at the last Olympiad in Mamallapuarm two years ago. He repeated that act in Budapest on Sunday. Of course, finishing 14th despite being seeded sixth must be a big pain for a high-flier like Carlsen. But the 33-year-old won the bronze medal on the top board with six points in eight games and a rating performance of 2810. FIDE uploaded the podium photo cropping the vacant bronze medal space. Carlsen's wish of keeping Russia and Belarus banned from team events in chess was honoured. Kyrgyzstan had put a proposal in the FIDE congress to lift the ban which was shot down.D Harika was pregnant when she played in the last Olympiad. Being both mother and player is far more challenging, but she said that the dual responsibility works as motivation too. ""If you have left your baby back in India, you better make it count.""",Gukesh was the most sought-after player for selfies as players from other countries looked at him in awe at the closing ceremony.

India Vs Pakistan: 'Tumhari wicket toh main hi lunga...': When Sachin Tendulkar walked the talk and dismissed Moin Khan in Multan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/tumhari-wicket-toh-main-hi-lunga-when-sachin-tendulkar-walked-the-talk-and-dismissed-moin-khan-in-multan/articleshow/113590151.cms,"Tumhari wicket toh main hi lunga

NEW DELHI: Sachin Tendulkar was primarily known for his incredible batting, but his bowling was an underrated aspect of his game. Although he wasn't a frontline bowler, he contributed significantly as a part-time bowler.Tendulkar was known for his versatility, as he could bowl medium pace, off-spin, and leg-spin, which made him a useful option for breaking partnerships or providing relief to the main bowlers.In Test cricket, Tendulkar took 46 wickets in 200 matches. While his role was more limited in Tests, he often broke important partnerships. His best figures in Tests were 3/10.When India toured Pakistan in 2004, they played the first Test in Multan. This match is historically significant as it was the game where Virender Sehwag scored his iconic 309, making him the first Indian to score a triple century in Test cricket, earning the venue the nickname ""Multan ka Sultan.""The Multan Test is also remembered for captain Rahul Dravid declaring the Indian innings when Tendulkar was on 194. But that's a different story.After India had declared their first innings at 675/5, Pakistan were 5 wickets down in their 1st innings and Abdul Razzaq and Moin Khan were leading the hosts' resistance. Tendulkar was bowling the last over of Day 3.Before the game, Sachin had challenged Moin saying, """" (I will take your wicket for sure). Playing mind games, Sachin deliberately moved fielders 2 to 3 steps back so that Razzaq could take a single and Moin could come on strike.And lo behold! Moin, who was extremely nervous at the crease, was clean bowled on the last ball of the over as Tendulkar bowled a brilliant googly to flummox Moin as the ball went between his legs to castle into the stumps.A stunned Moin Khan walked back to the pavilion as India ended the day perfectly and went on to win the Test by an innings and 52 runs.Watch the dismissal here:Though Tendulkar wasn't a regular bowler, he played a significant role in India's bowling strategy, often providing crucial wickets and handy overs.Tendulkar's knack for breaking partnerships earned him the title of ""golden arm,"" and captains often turned to him when they needed breakthroughs.","Sachin Tendulkar's bowling was an underrated aspect of his game.

snares three as India thump Bangladesh by 280 runs

CHENNAI: In a few years' time, when we will look back at the India vs Bangladesh Test at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in the September of 2024, we will remember it as the 'Ashwin Test'.From the second session of the first day to the time when India wrapped it up in the first session of Day 4, it was Ashwin all the way.A century on Day 1, his 37th five-wicket haul to equal Shane Warne , another Man of the Match award, his father, wife, kids, former coaches and many friends in the galleries, the stage might have been incredibly tempting for the 38-year-old to announce that it was his last at his beloved home ground.He didn't. ""Who knows if this was my Chepauk swansong in Tests? But if it was, what a swansong it was,"" Ashwin left it open-ended, soaking in all the adulation after another match-winning spell of 6-88 as India won the Test by 280 runs to go 1-0 up. When the fourth day started, the result of the Test was never in doubt. The challenge for India was to wrap it up as early as possible before the team leaves for Kanpur in the search of the second of their four wins that will book them aWorld Test Championship Final berth.One felt that on a tired pitch here on Day 4, captain Rohit Sharma might bring Ashwin and his spin twin Ravindra Jadeja into action right from the start. But he waited, allowed the effect of the roller to wear off, and let the Bangladeshi batters Najmul Hossain Shanto and Shakib Al Hasan get used to the pace of the quick bowlers.Just when it seemed the two lefthanders might just stretch the game a bit, Ashwin and Jadeja were brought in. Ashwin, coming in from round the wicket and bowling with a 5-4 offside field to the left-hander, chose to take the middle-stump line rather than off. It took the cut and the reverse sweep out of the equation and the master offie was looking to bowl a little slow through the air, to get maximum purchase out of a pitch which hadn't shaped up into a vicious turner.The skill of the bowler had to come into play and that's exactly what happened when Ashwin induced an inside-edge off Shakib's bat and the forward short-leg fielder completed a good catch diving to his left.That was the beginning of the end as Ashwin and Jadeja looked more and more dangerous. Litton Das, a super success in Pakistan recently for Bangladesh, didn't have the quality to deal with the spin duo and Jadeja (3 58) sent him back.The ball pitched on the middle and turned just a little bit and the edge was a regulation at slip. At this point, the only point of interest was whether Bangladesh captain Shanto (82) could complete his century. But with wickets falling at the other end, the left-hander who had batted with a lot of belief till then, tried a big shot against Jadeja and gave his wicket away.Jadeja, though, was made to wait for his milestone 300th wicket, stopping at 299, when he had the last man Hasan Mahmud bowled 15 minutes before lunch. In a way, it was fitting as well, because Jadeja was equally instrumental in this win, scoring 86 with Ashwin, taking the two big wickets in the first innings, and now, finishing things off in a hurry, the way he has been doing on Indian soil over the years.""Jadeja is such an inspirational story…My admiration for Jadeja keeps on increasing as I realize I will never be able to beat him,"" Ashwin paid his comrade the ultimate compliment as India truly looked like a happy family.",India beat Bangladesh by 280 runs to go 1-0 up in the Test. Ravindra Jadeja takes his 300th Test wicket. Ashwin takes 6-88 to equal Shane Warne's record of 37 wickets.

Ravindra Jadeja: Master of subtle brilliance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/bangladesh-in-india/ravindra-jadeja-master-of-subtle-brilliance/articleshow/113598937.cms,"NEW DELHI: Playing alongside Ravichandran Ashwin can be a challenge for any bowler, even for a standout like Ravindra Jadeja With Jadeja on the brink of joining the elite group of cricketers with 300 wickets and 3000 runs in Test cricket, reaching 299 wickets and 3122 runs, the achievement speaks volumes.Only ten players in the history of cricket have attained this milestone, with Kapil Dev and Ashwin being the only other Indians.Notable legends such as Gary Sobers and Jacques Kallis are absent from this list.Jadeja's name rarely gets mentioned alongside these all-rounders. And his low-profile approach is a key reason.Unlike Ashwin, who frequently talks about his skills in press meets or on his YouTube channel, Jadeja prefers to operate quietly, much like a stealth fighter jet.In high-pressure situations, Jadeja's fighting instincts shine through. During the first Test against Bangladesh, where India triumphed by 280 runs, Jadeja and Ashwin's partnership was crucial in the first innings. From 144 for six, they took the score to 376 with a 199-run stand for the seventh wicket. Jadeja scored 86, but the spotlight was on Ashwin's century.Jadeja's contribution of five wickets in that match was overshadowed by Ashwin's six-wicket haul in the second innings.While Ashwin received much praise for his tactical approach against Shakib Al Hasan, Jadeja's efforts to dismiss Litton Das went largely unnoticed.Jadeja excels through his competitive spirit rather than artistic flair. His all-round efforts often end up as a footnote, recognized only by keen observers.Ashwin acknowledged Jadeja's importance. ""He's been a very inspirational story. Sometimes, when you're in the race along with your co-cricketers, you want to get ahead of one another. And then you slowly start admiring one another.""Now, that admiration has gone one step higher, knowing that I can never beat Jadeja. So, I'm comfortable in my skin, but totally inspired by what he's done,"" Ashwin had said after the first Test.Since 2012, Jadeja and Ashwin have played 45 home Tests together, winning 34, losing three, and drawing eight. In these matches, Jadeja has taken 218 wickets, while Ashwin has claimed 263.""It can be safely said that, they feed on each other's presence. I would say Ashwin has benefitted slightly more by the presence of Jadeja, because he hardly gives anything to batsmen. Even on flat wickets, batters struggle against him because of his control.""So, at times, they are forced to take risks against Ashwin or other bowlers. But who are those other bowlers – Bumrah and Shami. So, for visiting batters it is a really no-hope situation, the pressure is continuous on them,"" a former India left-arm spinner told PTI.""He is quite selfless too in what he does. He hardly gives big interviews or tussle for any positions. I don't even know whether he likes all the hype around. He seems a contended person, happy in just contributing to the team,"" he added.After the Chepauk Test, while others were celebrating and speaking to broadcasters, Jadeja stood near the boundary, tossing a red-ball and staring at the ground, likely contemplating strategies for the next Test.","Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja have played 45 home Tests together.

The UEFA Champions League is celebrated for its exhilarating football and moments of individual brilliance. However, with the pressure and intensity of the competition comes heightened emotions, leading to disciplinary actions. While many players have been cautioned in the heat of battle, a select few have accumulated the most red cards in the tournament’s history.Here's a look at the top five players who were shown red more often than any others in the Champions League:Sergio Ramos, the Real Madrid icon, is widely regarded as one of the best defenders of his generation. Known for his leadership and aggression, Ramos often found himself on the wrong side of referees. His four red cards reflect his fearless, sometimes reckless, defending style that made him both a hero and a villain on the pitch.Zlatan Ibrahimovic, a striker with flair and confidence, earned a reputation not only for his stunning goals but also for his fiery temperament. The Swede's confrontational nature on the field saw him receive four red cards in the Champions League, showcasing that his passion sometimes boiled over into clashes with referees and opponents alike.Nicknamed ""The Pitbull,"" Edgar Davids was renowned for his aggressive, combative style of play in midfield. His fearsome tackling and relentless pressing earned him four red cards in the Champions League. While his physicality intimidated opponents, it also led to multiple dismissals, cementing his legacy as a no-nonsense player.Patrick Vieira, one of the finest central midfielders of his era, was celebrated for his imposing physical presence and leadership. However, his passion often led to disciplinary trouble. His three red cards in the Champions League are a testament to his confrontational style and the fine line he walked between controlled aggression and ill-discipline.Arturo Vidal is known for his fierce competitiveness and combative play in midfield. His ""warrior"" mentality has earned him a reputation as one of the most aggressive players in world football. However, his hard tackles and confrontational attitude led to three red cards in the Champions League, making him a regular target for referees.","The UEFA Champions League is celebrated for its exhilarating football and moments of individual brilliance.

We are going to play Mohun Bagan, in their field, again. We know they are waiting for us around the corner. They want revenge. And that is motivation.

Imran Khan should get to next level: Khalid Jamil,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/imran-khan-should-get-to-next-level-khalid-jamil/articleshow/113576072.cms,"KOLKATA: Jamshedpur FC coach Khalid Jamil was more than pleased with the performance of Imran Khan who had an incredible Indian Super League (ISL) game against Mumbai City FC at JRD Tata Sports Complex in Jamshedpur on Saturday.Imran, who got a call up to the Indian team early this year, had quite a remarkable outing with the Men of Steel last season and he has continued from where he left off, this season too.On Saturday, playing against the defending champions and one of the favourites this season, too, the footballer from Manipur was a livewire on the right wing and made Sahil Panwar ’s life quite difficult.After making some lovely runs early on, it was finally in the 36th minute that he made a decisive move. Imran played a dummy, and then dropped his shoulders to get past Panwar before releasing a cross towards the centre with his left foot from outside the box. It was inch perfect and all Jordan Murray had to do was jump up and redirect the ball towards the goal, and he obliged.About four minutes later, the Maniouri winger delivered another cross near the middle from much further out. This time it was for Javier Siverio but the Spaniard’s header was saved by Mumbai goalkeeper Phurba Lachenpa.However, within a couple of minutes he forced Panwar for a foul on him that earned the Mumbai player a yellow and helped Jamshedpur win a free-kick. It was well outside the box but at a good position. AndJavi Hernandez had no trouble in scoring directly from it.Any coach would have been proud of such a performance and speaking after the game which the hosts won 3-2, Jamil said, “Imran is doing well. He is experienced and he knows better. He’s making good deliveries. He now should just maintain his form and try to get to the next level.”The coach, however, added, “He could have done better at times.”As for the overall performance, Jamil said, “We worked very hard and that’s why we got the result. We must keep the same spirit. We should now think of the next game.”The coach, meanwhile, made only one change to the starting eleven from the last match by bringing in Murray and it was quite a masterstroke.Murray, who scored the winner in the last game against FC Goa, not only gave Jamshedpur the lead but also played a part in the third goal.Speaking of the change, Jamil added, “We needed an early goal, so played Jordan Murray from the beginning to give support to Javier Siverio and Javi Hernández.”Hopefully the trio will be able to carry on their good show even in the next game which will be away to Odisha FC coming Saturday.Also all eyes will be on Imran, who will hope to deliver once again and maybe then get a chance to play for the national team sometime in the future.","Imran Khan had an incredible Indian Super League (ISL) game against Mumbai City FC at JRD Tata Sports Complex in Jamshedpur on Saturday.

""The tour goes on without you. We need to do something about it. It's not an easy solution, but a solution which needs to be made.""Alcaraz and Zverev have a packed schedule ahead, with their seasons extending until the Davis Cup Finals in Spain, which will be held in late November.The upcoming 2025 season is set to kick off on December 27, with the United Cup tournament taking place in Australia.","Carlos Alcaraz says the tennis calendar is ""going to kill us"" in some way.

If you win, you will get this much as a bonus, and if the team wins this much extra.""The committee then decided to authorize the captain to discuss it with the player.""Rajpal refused to comment on the matter but another member of the executive committee who attended the meeting confirmed, without revealing details, that Nagal's request was agreed to.An AITA source familiar with the subject said, ""It ($50,000) is roughly Rs. 40-45 lakh for two ties in a year. So essentially, he has asked for Rs. 20 lakh per tie, which I think is fine. A (No. 1) player gets anywhere around Rs. 7 to 12 lakhs at the moment.""As a standalone figure it might seem exorbitant, but to put it in perspective, a player earned $100,000 simply for turning up in the singles first round at the US Open this year. At the French Open, a first-round appearance made a player richer by 73,000-euros.It is also understood that Nagal had requested for a change in support staff attached to the Indian Davis Cup team. It is not clear whether he wanted both Rajpal (as captain by Mahesh Bhupathi) and Zeeshan Ali (as coach by Somdev Devvarman ) to be replaced, or only the latter. Devvarman is Nagal's mentor.The AITA subsequently appointed Ashutosh Singh as coach after Ali resigned.Nagal issued a detailed statement on the subject while also responding to the attack from the AITA that he skipped the Stockholm sojourn despite being fit.""It was a difficult decision to withdraw from the Davis Cup, as playing for the national team is a moment I cherish deeply. However, after consulting with my medical team, it became clear that competing while carrying an injury could not only jeopardize my health but also adversely impact the team’s chances,"" said Nagal, who on Thursday pulled out of the ATP 250 event in Hangzhou.""In professional sports, injury management is a complex science. Sometimes, just a few days of rest and targeted rehabilitation can make the difference between aggravating an injury and being fit to play again.""Regarding compensation, I want to clarify that it is standard practice in professional sports for athletes to be compensated for their participation in events, even when representing their country.""This is not about personal gain. My discussions with AITA and the Davis Cup Captain are confidential and I would not like to indulge in any speculation about this.""","Sumit Nagal had asked to be paid $50,000 a year for playing Davis Cup.
