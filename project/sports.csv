35-year-old cricketer dies of cardiac arrest during match,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/35-year-old-cricketer-dies-of-cardiac-arrest-during-match/articleshow/115787465.cms,"CHHATRAPATI SAMBHAJINAGAR: A 35-year-old professional cricketer, Imran Patel, died of a massive cardiac arrest during a match in Pune Wednesday night. Patel had entered the pitch at Garware Stadium as opening batsman for the league match. After a few overs he complained to the umpires of pain in his left arm and chest. The discussion was brief and he was walking back to the pavilion when he collapsed. The events were caught on camera as the match was being streamed live. Patel was rushed to hospital where doctors declared him dead.“He didn’t have history of any medical condition,” said Naseer Khan, another cricketer. “He was in good physical condition. In fact, he was an allrounder who loved the game. We’re all still in shock.”Patel leaves behind a wife and three daughters, the youngest only four months old. A massive crowd turned up for his last rites near Maulana Azad College late on Wednesday. Patel owned a cricket team, had a real-estate business and ran a juice shop. His death was hauntingly similar to that of cricketer Habib Shaikh’s who also died while playing a match, on Sept 7 in Pune. Habib was a diabetic.","Imran Patel, 35, died of a massive cardiac arrest during a match in Pune Wednesday night.

World Chess Championship: Gukesh gets early wakeup call as Ding Liren takes exciting win in Game 1,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/chess/world-chess-championship-gukesh-gets-early-wakeup-call-as-ding-liren-takes-exciting-win-in-game-1/articleshow/115686808.cms,"D Gukesh and Ding Liren during game one of the WCC on Monday.

THE MOVES:

D Gukesh was ready to pounce, but he was not fully prepared for the counter-attack.Reigning world champion Ding Liren , 32, gave the 18-year-old Indian challenger a 'wake up and smell the coffee' moment in the opening battle of the 14-game World Chess Championship match in Singapore on Monday.The world No. 23 Chinese, who had accepted that he was an underdog, won in 42 moves of French defense Steinitz variation against an opponent who is world No. 5 and in red-hot form.It was a nervy contest, rich in nuances and high on spirit. For almost five hours, the followers were glued to their gadgets and apparently so was Ding, supposedly recovering from mental cobwebs. In the process, it was Gukesh's turn to get trapped.The winless run of 300-plus days didn't stop Ding from scoring his third career classical win against Gukesh - and all of them have come with black pieces. Gukesh is yet to score a classical win against the Asian giant and if he wants to avoid tiebreaks of shorter time controls, he has to win at least twice now to seal the deal. Gukesh did not make any dramatic mistakes or blunders; but there were oversights. Ding was more accurate and alert and raised the bar with good moves that his younger opponent didn't envisage at clutch moments.Once a regular opening, the French defense became extremely rare at the World Championship level since the 1978 Match onwards. And Ding last tried it against Nepo last year in the seventh game, also with black, and lost it. But this specific line - Classical Steinitz variation (named after the first ever world champion) was the first occurrence at this stage.Only one pawn and a knight were off the board till the 25th move as the players tried to wrest control. Though Ding castled late (31st move), his two knight moves (18..Nb2 and 32..Nd3) had precision written all over. Ding acknowledged it was a great win, but he was lucky too. ""I was worse out of the opening but overall, I played well. I thought he (Gukesh) might get nervous at the start of the match and hence I tried to play something unusual that I have not tried recently. And it worked to perfection.""Gukesh accepted that it's not a great start in his bid to become the youngest monarch of the sport. ""All depended on alertness,"" he said at the press conference later. ""I made a tactical oversight (GM and commentator Judit Polgar thought the mistakes were strategic). It can happen. I expected nothing else but the best version of Ding. Now, it gets more exciting since I am trailing.""Saying that he was playing on his own (out of the book) after Ding's 10th move that led to his first long thought, with stretched for almost 21 minutes, the Indian emphasised that his gameplan for the remaining contest won't change much. He intends to play with good energy and according to the positions and not be ultra-defensive.For the first 10 moves, Gukesh took just 90 seconds and Ding almost 50 minutes - the pawn move needing 28 minutes and a queen-push a further 15. But 12 moves later, Ding had the clock advantage (29 mins in hand for 28 moves to Gukesh's 24). And finally, it led to Gukesh needing to make seven moves in 45 seconds to reach the 40-move mark.1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.e5 Nfd7 5.f4 c5 6.Nce2 Nc6 7.c3 a5 8.Nf3 a4 9.Be3 Be7 10.g4 Qa5 11.Bg2 a3 12.b3 cxd4 13.b4 Qc7 14.Nexd4 Nb6 15.0-0 Nc4 16.Bf2 Bd7 17.Qe2 Nxd4 18.Nxd4 Nb2 19.Qe3 Rc8 20.Rac1 Qc4 21.f5 Qd3 22.Qe1 Bg5 23.Rc2 Rc4 24.h4 Bf4 25.Qb1 Rxc3 26.Rxc3 Qxc3 27.fxe6 fxe6 28.Ne2 Qxe5 29.Nxf4 Qxf4 30.Qc2 Qc4 31.Qd2 0-0 32.Bd4 Nd3 33.Qe3 Rxf1+ 34.Bxf1 e5 35.Bxe5 Qxg4+ 36.Bg2 Bf5 37.Bg3 Be4 38.Kh2 h6 39.Bh3 Qd1 40.Bd6 Qc2+ 41.Kg3 Qxa2 42.Be6+ Kh8 white resigned.","Reigning world champion Ding Liren gave the 18-year-old Indian challenger a 'wake up and smell the coffee' moment in the opening battle of the 14-game World Chess Championship match in Singapore on Monday.

Ghazanfar Comparisons

' New Addition: Not Just a Bowler

NEW DELHI: It has been just over a month since India A had to suffer a crushing defeat in the semi-final of the ACC Men's T20 Emerging Teams Asia Cup 2024 at the hands of Afghanistan A , the eventual winner of the tournament.The match saw Tilak Varma's team get knocked out of the tournament after a sensational opening spell from Allah Ghazanfar , who took the key wickets of openers Prabhsimran Singh and Abhishek Sharma, dealing a blow to India's hopes of lifting the trophy.Fast forward to today, and Ghazanfar is set to share the dressing room with India's top stars like Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya , and Rohit Sharma . The 18-year-old spinner has been snapped up by Mumbai Indians for Rs 4.8 crore at the IPL 2025 mega auction, marking the beginning of an exciting new chapter in his cricketing career.Raees Ahmadzai, the coach who was in the Afghanistan A dug-out as Ghazanfar rattled India and then became Man of the Match in the final against Sri Lanka, spoke exclusively to TimesofIndia.com about the rising star in Afghanistan cricket .""Allah Ghazanfar was with me during the Asia Cup in Oman, and he truly deserves to play in the IPL,"" Ahmadzai said. ""The way he bowled, you could see he's enjoying his cricket. He's a confident young guy who loves challenges. He wants to achieve something significant in life. I remember during the tournament, he told me, ‘I want to bowl the first over, and I will get them out.' And he did exactly that.”Ahmadzai went on to describe Ghazanfar as an ""easygoing"" player who works to improve his skillset every day. ""He's a good batter as well. While he needs to work on his fielding—he's not a bad fielder, but there's room for improvement—he's a very good bowler who can also hit big shots when given the chance,"" he added while mentioning Ghazanfar's impressive 31 not out from 15 balls against South Africa in a recent ODI.Ghazanfar's bowling statistics have already caught the attention of many, including his coach. Ghazanfar has maintained a superior T20 economy rate (5.71) compared to renowned spinners Rashid Khan (6.48) and Mujeeb Ur Rahman (6.76), both of whom have been stalwarts for Afghanistan in the shortest format.Additionally, Ghazanfar has a better bowling average (18.15) and strike rate (12.20) than Rashid and Mujeeb. Rashid's bowling strike rate stands at 16.70, while Mujeeb's is 21.10. These impressive numbers reflect his potential, especially considering that he is just starting out in his career.""He has a really good variety in his bowling,"" Ahmadzai noted. ""I can recall a match against Sri Lanka in the Emerging Asia Cup, where their captain was Nuwanidu Fernando. The night before, we had planned how to bowl to him, and the next day, Ghazanfar executed it perfectly. The batter thought he was an off-spinner, so we brought mid-on up and sent mid-off back during the powerplay. The batsman must have thought, 'What kind of stupid planning is this for an off-break bowler?' What he didn't know was that Ghazanfar's delivery would pitch and turn away, just like a leg-break. The batter tried stepping out to play it over mid-on but ended up getting stumped. This shows how well Ghazanfar reads the batsman.""Ghazanfar's journey to becoming a spinner has an interesting backstory. Ahmadzai revealed that Ghazanfar originally started as a fast bowler before coach Rozi Khan noticed his potential and suggested a switch to spin bowling due to his strong, muscular arms and ability to land the ball consistently in the right areas.“He played all his academy cricket in Kabul, and that's where his transition to spin bowling happened. During the Emerging Teams Asia Cup, I spoke to him and told him, 'Brother, you don't need to try too many different things. And you don't have to aim to take a wicket on every ball. The better your economy rate, the more your confidence will grow,'” Ahmadzai added.Despite being at the start of his career, Ghazanfar has already been compared to Afghanistan's two best-known spinners, Mujeeb Ur Rahman and Rashid Khan. However, former Afghan cricketer Ahmadzai sees Ghazanfar's bowling action somewhat similar to India's Varun Chakravarthy.""Mujeeb has his own class. He's been outstanding in such a fast-paced game. He's become a role model for many. But the actions of Ghazanfar and Varun Chakravarthy are almost similar. What sets them apart is how they vary their approach—sometimes coming close to the wicket, other times wide of the crease. This versatility helps him plan his deliveries based on the batsman's movements,” Ahmadzai explained.Ahmadzai also hinted at Ghazanfar's potential role in the Mumbai Indians setup, suggesting that the young bowler could open the innings with the new ball.""He is a proper bowler. When the need arises, he can hit the ball. But he's not just a slogger who hits only around mid-on or mid-wicket. He can hit extra cover, over mid-off, straight down the ground, and even hit spinners down the wicket. His main focus should be on bowling, and calling him an all-rounder at this stage wouldn't be appropriate,"" he concluded.","Allah Ghazanfar has been snapped up by Mumbai Indians for Rs 4.8 crore at the IPL 2025 mega auction. The 18-year-old spinner is set to share the dressing room with India's top stars like Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya, and Rohit Sharma. He started as a fast bowler before his coach noticed his potential and suggested a switch to spin.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115778192,imgsize-40546,width-400,resizemode-4/115778192.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Adding to the five core players retained ahead of the two-day Indian Premier League (IPL) auction , the Mumbai Indians (MI) came up with a good effort to put together a 23-member squad in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.Going in with a thin purse of INR 45 crore, MI made some strategic buys in the form of spinners Mitchell Santner and Karn Sharma besides investing big in veteran New Zealand pacer Trent Boult and uncapped allrounder Naman Dhir.MI had exhausted INR 75 crore from their total purse of INR 120 crore in retaining Rohit Sharma, Jasprit Bumrah, Suryakumar Yadav, Hardik Pandya, and Tilak Varma.During the auction, the team addressed specific requirements, particularly bolstering their bowling department, which showed in the costly acquisition of Deepak Chahar for INR 9.25 crore, besides Boult.",Rishabh Pant becomes most expensive IPL player after he goes to LSG for Rs 27 crore at IPL auction.

NEW DELHI: With trusted lieutenant Virat Kohli once again headlining the Royal Challengers Bengaluru's (RCB) new 22-member squad, the team will launch another attempt next year to win the elusive Indian Premier League (IPL) title.The team's think-tank pieced together the new squad during the two-day IPL mega auction held in Jeddah on November 24-25. RCB maintained their core by retaining three crucial players before the auction -- Kohli, Rajat Patidar and Yash Dayal -- and were left with Rs 83 crore for shopping in the Saudi Arabian port city.The franchise strengthened their batting lineup through significant acquisitions at the auction, securing all-rounder Liam Livingstone and wicketkeeper-batter Phil Salt. They also spent big to acquire Indian wicketkeeper Jitesh Sharma.RCB shelled out a big amount to get the services of Australian fast bowler Josh Hazlewood as the leader of their pace attack alongside swing bowler Bhuvneshwar Kumar.While the team will decide its new captain in due course, there are reports that Kohli might return to lead the side once again.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru will launch another 22-member team next year to win the elusive Indian Premier League next year.

NEW DELHI: The two-day Indian Premier League (IPL) auction concluded in the port city of Jeddah in Saudi Arabia on November 25, with Rishabh Pant emerging as the costliest buy, breaking the record of biggest price tag with a pay-cheque of a staggering Rs 27 crore from the Lucknow Super Giants (LSG).Batter Shreyas Iyer came a close second with a bid of Rs 26.75 crore, shelled out by the Punjab Kings.Rishabh Pant, who was not retained by Delhi Capitals (DC) and is currently playing the Test series in Australia, was bought by the LSG after an intense bidding war with Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) and Delhi -- taking his base-price of Rs 2 crore to a record rise. It will be the first time that Pant will move out of his hometown Delhi to play for another IPL side, and it required LSG to empty their pockets, breaking the record set by Australian pacer Mitchell Starc last year with his Rs 24.75 crore bid from Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR). In all likelihood, Pant will lead the LSG side, especially because KL Rahul is no longer with the Lucknow team.Shreyas Iyer took home a whopping Rs 26.75 crore pay-cheque from Punjab. Released by KKR ahead of the auction, Iyer had led the franchise to their third IPL title in 2024, after missing the entire 2023 season due to a back injury. However, he was still not retained by Kolkata. The 29-year-old was originally bought by KKR for Rs 12.25 crore in 2022, taking on the role of captain following seven seasons with Delhi Capitals. Punjab, who were also looking for a marquee player to lead the side, might appoint him as their skipper for the 2025 season.Venkatesh Iyer turned out to be a surprise star at the IPL 2025 mega auction, with reigning champions KKR splashing a massive Rs 23.75 crore to bring him back into the fold. The left-handed Iyer was not retained by KKR ahead of the auction. Iyer entered the auction with a base price of Rs 2 crore, with KKR making the first move for the star performer of their title-winning run in the last edition and eventually winning the bid after an intense battle with Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB).England white-ball captain Jos Buttler laughed his way to the bank as he raked in a jaw-dropping Rs 15.75 crore from 2022 champions Gujarat Titans (GT). After an intense three-way bidding war, GT secured the services of the England superstar for a whopping price. Buttler, who was not retained by Rajasthan Royals ahead of the auction, was part of the franchise for the last seven editions. Before joining Royals in 2018, Buttler had represented Mumbai Indians in 2016 and 2017 editions. Buttler also brings with him valuable experience and leadership qualities.KL Rahul was part of the marquee list at the auction and had a base price of Rs. 2 crore. He had entered the IPL auction after not being retained by LSG despite being their captain last season. Rahul has been a vital asset for multiple franchises over the years, including the Lucknow, Kings XI Punjab (now Punjab Kings), Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Sunrisers Hyderabad. With Pant no longer with DC, Rahul is the most likely candidate to lead the Delhi team in the 2025 season.Rajasthan Royals (RR) snapped up England pacer Jofra Archer for Rs 12.50 crore. The Royals, known for their strategic picks, brought back Archer, adding a world-class bowler to their roster. Archer, who played his last IPL season in 2020, was added back to the shortlist three days before the auction. The right-arm pacer made his comeback this summer after a lengthy injury layoff, featuring in England's white-ball series against Pakistan, Australia and the West Indies, as well as the T20 World Cup.MI bagged veteran New Zealand pacer Trent Boult, known for his early strikes with the new ball, for Rs 12.50 crore. The move will reunite the Kiwi left-arm pacer, who took 16 wickets in last IPL season but was still released by Rajasthan, will reunite with India’s ace fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah at MI. The pair was instrumental in Mumbai's title-winning campaign in 2020. It was their fifth and last crown. Overall, Boult has represented as many as five teams: Sunrisers Hyderabad, Kolkata Knight Riders, Delhi Capitals, Mumbai Indians and Rajasthan Royals in the cash-rich league.Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) has successfully re-acquired the Australian right-arm pacer Josh Hazlewood for Rs 12.5 crore. Having previously contributed to RCB's impressive 2021 season, Hazlewood is set to lead their pace attack once again. His proven skills in generating bounce and movement will significantly enhance RCB's fast-bowling department.Ishan Kishan will be turning up for a new franchise in the IPL as the youngster was sold to SRH for Rs 11.25 crore, which is 26% less than Rs 15.25 crore MI paid to buy him in the 2022 auction. Mumbai started the bidding for Kishan at his pace price of Rs 2 crore but didn't go beyond Rs 3.20 crore. Delhi Capitals, looking for a wicketkeeper-batter after Rishabh Pant wasn't retained, were in an intense bidding war with Punjab Kings before SRH joined the action late and got his services.Chennai Super Kings secured Afghanistan's young talent Noor Ahmad for Rs 10 crore after a fierce bidding contest ensued between Mumbai Indians and Chennai for the left-arm Afghanistan spinner's services. Initially acquired by CSK for Rs 5 crore, Ahmad's price doubled when GT's attempt to get him with the 'Right to Match' card was thwarted by CSK's elevated bid of Rs 10 crore. Chennai's acquisition of Ravichandran Ashwin, the retention of Ravindra Jadeja from IPL 2024 and the addition of Ahmad has established a formidable spin-bowling unit that appears well-suited to their home-ground conditions.","Indian Premier League (IPL) auction concluded in Jeddah in Saudi Arabia on November 25. Rishabh Pant broke the record of biggest price tag with a pay- cheque of a staggering Rs 27 crore from the Lucknow Super Giants. Shreyas Iyer came a close second with a bid of Rs 26.75 crore, shelled out by the Punjab Kings.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115684676,imgsize-63190,width-400,resizemode-4/115684676.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings (CSK), the five-time IPL champions, have strategically built a well-rounded and dynamic squad for the IPL 2025 season , blending seasoned campaigners with emerging talent. The retention of core players like Ruturaj Gaikwad, Ravindra Jadeja, and MS Dhoni highlights CSK’s commitment to stability and experience.Having retained the core of their team for 2025 and beyond, CSK brought back Ravichandran Ashwin after 10 seasons at the IPL Auction in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and reunited him with Ravindra Jadeja. They also bolstered their spin attack and created backup in the form of Noor Ahmed.The five-time IPL champions also signed players who have the experience in domestic cricket but their IPL careers haven't created headlines in the years gone by. That list includes Rahul Tripathi, Vijay Shankar, Kamlesh Nagarkoti, Deepak Hooda and Shreyas Gopal.Out of the total purse of Rs 120 crore, which each franchise had before retaining players, CSK spent Rs 65 crore to retain five players, including the uncapped MS Dhoni (Rs 4 crore).The re-introduction of a rule in the IPL Player Regulations allowed CSK to retain Dhoni. The rule states that any player who hasn't played international cricket for five years or hasn't had a central contract for that period is considered uncapped.""I think we have got a well-balanced side. Good mix of experience and some exciting young players. The auction can ebb and flow. Sometimes you have got to hold your nerve,"" said the CSK head coach Stephen Fleming.Rs 119.95 crore","Chennai Super Kings IPL 2025 Squad: Batters, Wicketkeepers, Allrounders, Bowlers.

NET SALARY:

NEW DELHI: Rishabh Pant shattered records at the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 mega auction in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, becoming the highest-paid player in the league's history. The Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) secured the dynamic wicketkeeper-batter for an unprecedented Rs 27 crore.Pant's previous franchise Delhi Capitals attempted to retain their star player by exercising the Right to Match (RTM) card at Rs 20.75 crore. However, LSG’s aggressive bid of Rs 27 crore forced Delhi Capitals to step back, sealing Pant’s move to the Lucknow-based franchise.Pant’s record-breaking contract caps off a remarkable comeback story. After surviving a near-fatal car accident in 2022 and undergoing extensive rehabilitation, he returned to international cricket with a renewed focus for the 2024 season of the IPL.Now, Pant is expected to lead LSG as captain in the upcoming IPL 2025 season, which is scheduled to begin on March 14.While Rs 27 crore headlines Pant’s historic contract, the actual net payout will be a different story due to tax implications.Lucknow have committed Rs 27 crore per season for Pant's services with the team. The Indian government will claim Rs 8.1 crore in tax (30%) from his total contract value. This leaves Pant with a net salary of Rs 18.9 crore per season from his IPL team.Speaking about Rishabh Pant's move to LSG, former India player Robin Uthappa opined, “I think the fact that Shreyas was bid for by Punjab Kings was a planned thing, because even if they didn’t go for him, because they had the luxury of having such a big bank, they could have gotten Pant for a little less. I think there was communication where Rishabh really wanted to move on from everything that was DC in the past and go on to other things in life and I think that is why there was less interest from Ponting and Punjab Kings for Pant and more interest in Shreyas.”Another ex-India player, Mohammad Kaif, said, ""With Rishabh Pant joining LSG, the team has gained both a strong brand value and a recognisable face—an essential factor for any franchise. While LSG do not have many big names apart from Pooran, Pant’s presence will significantly benefit them. The decision to jump from ₹21 crore to ₹27 crore was aggressive, but it’s a move that seems justified. They now have an Indian captain, and securing Rishabh Pant at ₹27 crore is a worthwhile deal for LSG.""Rs 27 crore (per season)Rs 8.1 crore (as per Indian government regulations)Rs 18.9 crore (per season).","Rishabh Pant becomes most expensive IPL player after he goes to LSG for Rs 27 crore.

Rishabh Pant became the most expensive player at IPL 2025 Auction and in the history of the league after the flashy left-handed wicketkeeper-batter was acquired by Lucknow Super Giants for Rs 27 crore. Pant became LSG's obvious choice as team leader as they broke bank for his credentials.Shreyas Iyer had become the most expensive IPL player for a brief period when Punjab Kings spent Rs 26.75 crore on him. He had played his cricket for defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders last season and led them to the title.While Pant and Shreyas were expected to draw big bids after not being retained by their respective franchises, the third biggest bid of the IPL 2025 Auction came out of nowhere. KKR broke bank for one of their own in the form of Venkatesh Iyer, bringing him for Rs 23.75 crore.Another notable signing over the two-day IPL Auction was that of 13-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi. From a base price of Rs 30 lakh, the teenager went to Rajasthan Royals for Rs 1.10 crore in a deal that captured the attention of many.Out of the national team setup for over two years, Bhuvneshwar Kumar’s experience found high demand among IPL franchises, with Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) securing his services for Rs 10.75 crore on Monday.The second day of the mega auction turned out to be lucrative for several Indian pacers, while some big names, including Shardul Thakur, Prithvi Shaw, Ajinkya Rahane, Kane Williamson, and Glenn Phillips, went unsold.Set to turn 35 before the start of the next IPL season, Bhuvneshwar boasts an impressive record of 300 wickets in 287 T20 matches with an economy rate under eight.Other notable deals included Deepak Chahar, who fetched Rs 9.25 crore from Mumbai Indians despite his injury history, and Mukesh Kumar, retained by Delhi Capitals for Rs 8 crore through the RTM card. Lucknow Super Giants also invested heavily, signing Test pacer Akash Deep for Rs 8 crore.Among the all-rounders, Krunal Pandya earned Rs 5.75 crore from RCB, who were in need of an experienced spin-bowling all-rounder. Rajasthan Royals made significant bids for Tushar Deshpande (Rs 6.50 crore) and Nitish Rana (Rs 4.20 crore), while Delhi Capitals secured former RCB skipper Faf du Plessis at a bargain base price of Rs 2 crore. Gujarat Titans acquired Washington Sundar for Rs 3.20 crore in another smart move.The scarcity of quality Indian seam-bowling all-rounders worked in favor of South Africa’s Marco Jansen, who secured a Rs 7 crore deal with Punjab Kings. Also making a major gain was veteran New Zealand pacer Trent Boult who was bought by Mumbai Indians for Rs 12.5 crore -- highlighting the demand for quality fast bowlers.Meanwhile, the auction reflected the high demand for Indian talent despite the limited options, ensuring lucrative deals for even fringe players.On Sunday, the first day of the auction, most of the high-profile names raked in the moolah as the franchises virtually emptied their pockets to bag the priority players in their respective shortlist.Led by Rs 27 crore Lucknow Super Giants spent to buy star wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant, the sum of money splurged by the franchises came to a whopping INR 467.95 crore.Pant edged past Shreyas Iyer, who fetched Rs 26.75 crore from Punjab Kings, as teams went all out for marquee Indian stars. Venkatesh Iyer took home a whopping Rs 23.75 crore from KKR.A total of 84 players from the roster of 577 were presented on the opening day at the Abadi Al Johar Arena. Out of these 68 got sold, while four were retained through the Right-to-Match card.Among other big buys, leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal attracted Rs 18 crore from Punjab Kings, who also used the Right-to-Match card to bring back paceman Arshdeep Singh for Rs 18 crore. KL Rahul was picked up by Delhi Capitals for Rs 14 crore.Meanwhile, the BCCI has taken a significant step by announcing the schedules for the IPL for the next three seasons. This is a departure from the usual practice of releasing schedules closer to the tournament.The 2025 IPL will commence on March 14 and conclude on May 25.The IPL Auction 2025 showcased a dramatic and competitive bidding war, with several franchises securing high-profile talent to strengthen their squads for the upcoming season. The second day saw Indian pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar topping the chart with a hefty price of INR 10.75 crore, reflecting the high demand for experienced fast bowlers despite his long absence from the national team. This influx of Indian talent demonstrates how IPL franchises value local players, often resulting in hefty bids even for those not part of the national setup.Franchises made smart moves by picking up key players based on specific team needs. Deepak Chahar, for example, fetched Rs 9.25 crore despite a history of injuries, highlighting the increasing reliance on proven seamers. Meanwhile, Mumbai Indians, who often make shrewd investments, secured both Mukesh Chahar and Deepak Chahar, bolstering their pace attack for IPL 2025. Lucknow Super Giants also impressed with strategic buys like Akash Deep, further reinforcing their depth in bowling.Notably, there was also a surge in the prices of all-rounders like Krunal Pandya (Rs 5.75 crore) and Washington Sundar (Rs 3.20 crore), whose versatility adds immense value to their respective teams. This indicates that franchises are looking for players who can contribute with both bat and ball, especially in the high-pressure, multifaceted environment of the IPL.The auction was also marked by some surprising omissions. Players like Shardul Thakur, Prithvi Shaw, Ajinkya Rahane, and Kane Williamson, who are usually regarded as top performers, went unsold, pointing to the shifting dynamics of IPL team strategies. While these players' exclusion may have shocked fans, it underlined the intense competition for spots and the changing nature of what franchises are looking for in their squads.Overall, the 2025 auction was a testament to the evolving nature of IPL strategies—teams focused on a mix of experience, youth, and flexibility. As the season nears, fans can look forward to an exciting and unpredictable tournament, with new combinations and fresh talent ready to light up the IPL stage.","Bhuvneshwar Kumar, out of India's national team for two years, fetched a hefty Rs 10.75 crore from RCB in the IPL 2025 auction. Deepak Chahar and Mukesh Kumar also secured lucrative deals. Rishabh Pant became the most expensive player on Day 1, going to LSG for Rs 27 crore.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115654073,imgsize-87934,width-400,resizemode-4/115654073.jpg"
Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Sunil Gavaskar: 'KL Rahul will bat at...'Gavaskar on India XI for Adelaide Test,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-australia/kl-rahul-will-bat-at-sunil-gavaskar-on-india-xi-for-adelaide-test/articleshow/115787086.cms,"Where will KL Rahul bat when Rohit Sharma returns to Playing XI for Adelaide Test

NEW DELHI: Former India batting legend Sunil Gavaskar is of the opinion that India will make at least two changes for the day-night Adelaide Test against Australia that starts from December 6.After the stupendous victory in the first Test against Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy , India is scheduled to play a two-day warm-up match against Prime Ministers XI at the Manuka Oval in the Australian capital of Canberra from Saturday.The pink ball warm-up match in Canberra is of utmost importance for India as it will be the only practice game they will get to play ahead of the day-night second Test in Adelaide.And it will be also the first game for captain Rohit Sharma on this trip to Australia as he missed the first Test in Perth due to the birth of his son.Talking to 7Cricket, Gavaskar said, ""I think there will be two changes for sure, both Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill coming back into the 11.""Young Devdutt Padikkal is set to be replaced by returning captain Rohit Sharma in the Indian playing XI for the second Test in Adelaide.Everyone will be intrigued by KL Rahul 's batting position in the pink ball warm-up match in Canberra.Rahul might be positioned at number three instead of Padikkal, depending on whether the injured Gill recovers in time for the game.Gill missed the first Test match and has not yet begun batting in the nets after suffering a hairline fracture during the intra-squad match at the WACA.Gavaskar continues, ""My feeling is that the batting order will change. Where Rohit Sharma will replace Rahul, Shubman Gill will bat at three, Padikkal and Jurel will go out of the team, Rahul will bat at six.""At the Adelaide Oval, spin bowling might be the only tactical change made to the starting lineup.In Perth, Washington Sundar was selected ahead of the two veteran spinners, Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja.Before the 36-all-out occurred in the December 2020 Pink Ball Test in Adelaide, Ashwin handed India the lead in the first innings with statistics of 4 for 45, including a brilliant dismissal of Steven Smith.However, based on their recent performance in the nets, Ashwin, Jadeja, and Washington don't now provide much of a choice. Additionally, batting becomes crucial in Pink Ball Tests because the spinners aren't used as often.Gavaskar concludes, ""And one other change that could happen is that Jadeja comes in place of Washington Sundar.""India's success in overseas Test matches has been mostly attributed to Jadeja's batting, although Washington, a left-hander, has also performed admirably in Test matches. In Perth, he helped India surpass the 500-run mark with an 89-run partnership with Virat Kohli",Sunil Gavaskar believes India will make at least two changes for Adelaide Test. India will play a two-day warm-up match against Prime Ministers XI in Canberra. Young Devdutt Padikkal is set to be replaced by returning captain Rohit Sharma.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115786498,imgsize-52914,width-400,resizemode-4/115786498.jpg"

NEW DELHI: India swept past Australia for a dominant 295-run win in the first Test in Perth last Monday, wrapping up the match with more than a day to spare.The visitors came into the opening match under pressure after their first home series loss in 12 years, against New Zealand, defeated 0-3.But the Jasprit Bumrah-led side shrugged that off to dominate in Perth with a commanding 295-run triumph.Former Pakistan cricketer, captain and arguably the greatest fast bowler in the history of cricket, Wasim Akram is nowadays is commentating on the Border-Gavaskar Trophy for the Test series between India and Australia.Star Sports, the official broadcaster of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series in India, shared a video of Akram lauding India to for their emphatic victory in the first Test in Perth.Akram says, ""Had never thought that India would win by 295 runs, it's a very big achievement by Team India. And it's not just a win for the Indian cricket team but a victory for the entire Indian cricket fraternity. The team is full of confidence, that they we can defeat anybody, anywhere.""A key positive for India was the batting exploits of Yashasvi Jaiswal and a return to form for Virat Kohli , with both smashing centuries.But it was their bowling unit that put India on the road to victory by dismissing the hosts for 104 in the first innings.Bumrah stood in as captain for Rohit Sharma , who missed the opener due to the birth of his second child..Akram adds, ""This is the first time that I have seen an Asian team play and win like this in Perth in 40 years, except India. And the manner in which they have won, so convincingly, one-sided, there has been no problem. India's batting in the second innings after their first innings debacle is just incredible. I have never seen an Asian team perform like this, so well done Team India and of course the people who have been involved in Indian cricket for so many years, congratulations to all.""Leading from the front, pace spearhead Bumrah made the team bounce back with a match haul of eight wickets after India were bundled out for 150 in the first innings.Bumrah helped bowl out Australia for 104 and then 238 in their chase of 534 to lead the five-match series 1-0.Rohit is set to lead the team in the second Test in Adelaide, starting December 6.",India beat Australia by 295 runs in the first Test in Perth. Jasprit Bumrah took eight wickets for the visitors. India lead the five-match series 1-0. The second Test takes place in Adelaide on December 6.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115787532,imgsize-67238,width-400,resizemode-4/115787532.jpg"

Royal Challengers Bengaluru Auction Review: RCB had an excellent auction and have covered most bases

IPL Auction: Rajasthan Royals make Vaibhav Suryavanshi youngest IPL crorepati

NEW DELHI: Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) appear set for a fresh chapter under Virat Kohli 's leadership in the 2025 IPL season, with the franchise assembling a strong 22-member squad during the recent auction in Jeddah. Kohli, who previously captained the side from 2013 to 2021, is poised to return as captain following discussions with the management as reported earlier by TimeofIndia.com.Kohli's leadership tenure saw RCB make the playoffs four times and come tantalizingly close to winning the title in 2016. The prospect of him leading the franchise again has reignited hope among fans eager for their team to secure a maiden IPL title. Former RCB icon AB de Villiers also hinted at Kohli’s return to captaincy while expressing optimism about the squad.""I don't think it has been confirmed yet, but he will be the captain, I think, looking at the squad,"" de Villiers said on his YouTube channel.The franchise made some calculated moves at the two-day auction, including acquiring Australian pacer Josh Hazlewood for Rs 12.50 crore, the highest among their buys. They also bid for marquee players like Rishabh Pant and KL Rahul but stayed within limits, reflecting their confidence in Kohli's return as skipper. Notably, the team did not pursue a reunion with former captain Faf du Plessis, opting instead to focus on building depth and balance.De Villiers lauded RCB’s strategy, especially in forming a formidable pace attack with Hazlewood, Bhuvneshwar Kumar , and Lungi Ngidi in the fold. ""We got Bhuvneshwar Kumar, happy with Josh Hazlewood. Rabada was close, but at least we got Ngidi. He’s got a wonderful slower ball. If he is in form and fit, he is a force to be reckoned with,"" he said.However, the South African great pointed out the lack of a match-winning spinner who can turn the ball both ways, a potential gap in the squad. ""We missed out on Ravichandran Ashwin . CSK got him, but it’s good to see him back in yellow. I feel we are missing a wrist spinner who can turn it both ways. We need it, especially during away games.""De Villiers suggested that RCB might look at the list of unsold players to address this shortfall. Alternatively, he proposed a mid-season transfer window as a way to bolster the squad. ""I wish the IPL and the BCCI would bring in a transfer window. Halfway through the tournament, you could make transfers or pick up players from the unsold list. It’s something to think about,"" he added.RCB’s squad now comprises 19 auction buys and three retained players. The franchise, still seeking its first IPL title, will hope Kohli’s return to captaincy and the newly assembled squad can finally end their long-standing wait for glory.","Virat Kohli poised to return as captain of Royal Challengers Bengaluru.

Most nineties in Test cricket:

On the opening day of the first New Zealand vs England Test at Christchurch, Kane Williamson was dismissed for 93 in what proved to be a dramatic five-wicket final session. It left hosts New Zealand at 319/8 after Day 1 in Christchurch on Thursday.New Zealand went into the tea break at a healthy 193/3 and slumped to 252/7 before Glenn Phillips (41 not out) and Matt Henry (18) stopped the collapse with a spirited 46-run stand for the eighth wicket.Shoaib Bashir, the only specialist spinner in the Test across both sides, was England's chief destroyer with 4/69.Williamson looked set for a century after joining Tom Latham in the middle when they lost opener Devon Conway in the second over. He played 14 balls before getting off the mark and went on to build 50-run partnerships with Latham, Rachin Ravindra and Daryl Mitchell.Williamson's push towards a ton was undone when attempting a cut shot that went to Zac Crawley at point to give Gus Atkinson his second wicket.This was the 14th time Williamson had beendismissed in the nineties in international cricket . He joined AB De Villiers and Rahul Dravid with 14 dismissals each in the nineties. The list, though, is led by Sachin Tendulkar who was dismissed 28 times while batting in the nineties.Speaking about the surface, Williamson said, ""It's a good, fair surface. On a surface like that you ride a bit of luck and I played and missed a bit, that's just the nature of the beast.""Basid, who made the difference from an England perspective, spoke about the feeling of bowling to Willaimson , ""Obviously he's a world class player and for me, bowling to someone like him, I was just in awe watching Kane Williamson bat,"" he said.""I bowled plenty of bad balls out there but I was still kept on and that shows how much faith they (management) have in me.""Sachin Tendulkar - 28Kane Williamson - 14AB de Villiers - 14Rahul Dravid - 14Jacques Kallis - 13Steve Waugh - 10Rahul Dravid - 10Sachin Tendulkar - 10Michael Slater - 9Alvin Kallicharran - 8",Kane Williamson dismissed for 93 on Day 1 of the first Test against England.

After his impressive Test debut at Perth's Optus Stadium, the 21-year-old is being touted as a 'rare' bowling allrounder for India

HYDERABAD: India's summer in Australia has gotten off on a surprisingly high note. What was being forecast as a tour without end, where the team would be forever looking lost and groping for answers, writing epitaphs for those careers cruelly ended, it instead culminated in a famous 295-run hammering of the home side in Perth.Have those dark pre-departure clouds suddenly disappeared, taking all the doubt with it? As the team lines up in Canberra in preparation of the pink-ball Test (in Adelaide, from Dec 6), there now emerges a scenario which you wouldn't exactly call a problem of plenty, but a situation any team would be happy to be in. Whom to drop, who to fit in, whom to shuffle up or down the order - all since regular captain Rohit Sharma has returned and staked claim to his spot.Suddenly, Team India has options. And in all this, there's Nitish Reddy , a 21-year-old allrounder whose stock has risen faster than the Australians can master saying Visakhapatnam. It took a little over a month from the Andhra boy's heady 34-ball 74 in the T20I against Bangladesh in Delhi to making his Test debut in Perth. Suddenly, he's being touted as a 'rare' bowling allrounder for India.Nitish acquitted himself well in Perth - top scorer with 41 in India's first innings - and came in for praise from stand-in skipper Jasprit Bumrah for his fearless attitude. ""If you are scared, then your fear will not go away. So, that is a very positive sign that they are not afraid,"" he said of debutants Nitish and Harshit Rana . As India flexes on this tour Down Under , the mantle of the fast-bowling allrounder gains importance and so does Nitish's role.Nitish carries shades of the Hardik Pandya template that he would love to emulate and yet avoid at the same time. Hardik's initial brilliance both with bat and ball was a captain's dream, but he seemed to lack the hunger to keep it going once things got tougher with injuries creeping in. Just 11 Tests old, while he played a brief but crucial role in India becoming this spunky Test unit, injuries and a general disinterest in pursuing the red-ball game meant that Pandya was a promise cut short.To repose faith in the team management, Nitish needs to work on his bowling. ""With regards to his batting, there is no doubt he is there. He is a brilliant fielder as well. I feel he is an all-format player,"" MSK Prasad told TOI from the US, adding, ""In bowling, he must improve…""Nitish seemed to be aware of this, when he spoke with the excitement of a teenager about the pitches in Australia. ""When I am practising my bowling, I am just enjoying the bounce the ball's getting here (Down Under) and adjusting accordingly. Hitting that five-six metre length is quite good in Australia, as back in India you need to hit that six-metre length for good length balls,"" he had said as member of the India A side, prior to the tour game in Mackay.Prasad, the former India chief selector, can take some credit for Nitish's rise. Few had heard of the cricketer before his Delhi T20I innings.It's a long way from the ACA-VDCA Academy in Visakhapatnam, where Nitish started playing at the age of six. ""We used to travel 30 km from Gajuwaka to Port Stadium at 5 am each day. It was possible because of my wife Manasa who used to get everything ready before time. She supported us despite not knowing anything about the game,"" remembered father, Mutyala Reddy.The sacrifices have yielded fruit, and the new calling card is a far cry from the look a worried father sported when he escorted Nitish to an awards ceremony in Hyderabad. It was here that Nitish was adjudged the Most Promising Youngster in 2018-19, and the seeds for the future were sown.Reddy senior also credited Prasad, who enrolled Nitish in the Andhra Cricket Association's (ACA) U-14 academy in Kadapa, where he was overseen by coaches Madhusudan Reddy and N. Srinivasa Rao. ""We used to visit him regularly when he was in Kadapa, but once he started performing consistently, he was moved to Vizianagaram, where coaches CD Thomson and Vikram played a key role,"" remembered Mutyala.""I am happy that I could spot him at a very young age,"" said Prasad, ""He was fast-tracked and the role he was given, he did it to perfection. The selectors and team management reposed faith in him and he delivered. He never looked like he was playing his first match,"" he added. Prasad expressed happiness that the ACA academies have started yielding fruit in men's cricket.Nitish's father had to leave a steady job with Hindustan Zinc Ltd. in Visakhapatnam as he was transferred to Udaipur. Instead, he heeded the call of coaches Kangani Kumaraswamy and A Krishna Rao as it would've affected Nitish's training. He opted for early retirement instead. ""We struggled financially after I left the job. It was tough to manage the family. We sailed through with our savings, but we made sure Nitish got all the support,"" he told TOI. Maybe it is that struggle that gives Nitish the fearlessness, the one that Bumrah noticed and appreciated.Nitish aggregated 1,237 in the Vijay Merchant Trophy in 2017-18 - the highest that season. It got him the BCCI's best U-16 cricketer award.Covid-19 was a dampener, though. Nitish did not make any state team in 2019. But he did not stop training.Chennai Super Kings took him as a net bowler for the IPL season 2021 and the following year, he was acquired by Sunrisers Hyderabad . He had a breakthrough season with last year's runners-up SRH. With 303 runs, including two fifties, he won the Emerging Player of the year award and was named in the Indian T20 team for the tour of Zimbabwe.However, a niggle made sure it was not to be. But he made the opportunity count when handed the India cap in the T20I series against Bangladesh earlier this season. The rest, we know, how it all unfolded.",Nitish Kumar Reddy made his Test debut for India against Australia in Perth. The 21-year-old is being touted as a 'rare' bowling allrounder for India.

Chicago Bears head coach Matt Eberflus defended his handling of the final seconds of the game against the Detroit Lions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/chicago-bears-head-coach-matt-eberflus-defended-his-handling-of-the-final-seconds-of-the-game-against-the-detroit-lions/articleshow/115789718.cms,"Image via Getty Images

Matt Eberflus explained his decision not to call a timeout at the end of the game in the final seconds

Chicago Bears star Keenan Allen criticized head coach Matt Eberflus after the team's loss to the Detroit Lions . The Bears were a few yards outside of field goal range on third down, failing to use a timeout or gain a few yards for their kicker to tie the game. QB Caleb Williams took over 30 seconds to get a play off, which was the last play of the game.Eberflus had 36 seconds to call a timeout, but he did not do so, allowing his quarterback to try to catch the ball. The clock would have run out if the catch had been made, leaving everyone confused about their plan. Despite the heat coming his way, Eberflus defended his handling of the final seconds of the game. When asked why he did not call a timeout to try to salvage the play, Eberflus said he felt he did things the right way.Chicago managed to score three points in the second half, thanks to strong performances from Williams and his receivers Allen and DJ Moore. After the game, Allen told reporters, ""I feel like we did enough as players to win the game."" Rumors suggest that Eberflus may be fired at the end of the season, with quotes appearing damning for his future.Head coach Matt Eberflus explained his decision not to call a timeout at the end of the game in the final seconds, in which he said he thought he did everything right despite the heat. He said, ""You know, and then we're there at second and 20. You know, take the sack right there. And, you know, so we're at 36 seconds right there. And our hope was because it was third going into fourth that we would re-rack that play at 18 seconds, throw it inbounds, get it into the field goal range, and then call the timeout. And that's where it was. And that was our decision-making process on that.”He further added, ""Again, we were outside the field goal range, you know, so we needed to get a few more yards in as close as we can get. And then we're going to call timeout. And that's why we held that last timeout at the end of the game. So like I said, disappointing for the players. They put a lot of work in in a short week and put themselves in position to win that game. So with that, I'll take questions.”Also Read: Will Demarcus Robinson play against the Saints this Sunday after arrest on DUI suspicion?

Goa exploit Blasters' defensive frailties to eke out a 1-0 victory,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/goa-exploit-blasters-defensive-frailties-to-eke-out-a-1-0-victory/articleshow/115789736.cms,"KOCHI: Kerala Blasters once again paid a heavy price for their defensive mistakes as they slumped to a 0-1 defeat against FC Goa in the Indian Super League match at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium here on Thursday.The decisive moment of the game came in the 40th minute when Boris Singh capitalised on goalkeeper Sachin Suresh 's lack of alertness and agility to score the all-important goal. The defeat was particularly concerning for the home fans as the visitors secured their victory despite limited playing time from their key players-Armando Sadiku, Borja Herrera, and Udanta Singh-who spent less than 20 minutes on the pitch.The victory propelled FC Goa to fifth spot in ISL standings with 15 points from nine games, while Blasters are stuck in ninth place with 11 points.Goa dictated the opening exchanges but waited almost until half-time to break the deadlock. Boris marched forward on the right flank and, as he approached closer to the box, unleashed a shot from a narrow angle. However, Blasters' goalkeeper Sachin not only failed to parry the ball away but saw it deflect off his hand and land in the goal, much to the dismay of his teammates and local fans.While Sachin's mistake led to the goal, the responsibility extends beyond him. The defensive lapses evident from the beginning of the match played a crucial role in Blasters conceding. Boris exploited a substantial gap on the right flank, which emerged when Blasters' left wing-back Naocha Singh advanced forward. Midfielder Freddy Lallawmawma, tasked with covering this space, couldn't track Boris' run and allowed him the chance to unleash a shot from close to the box.In the 57th minute, Blasters' coach Mikael Stahre made a triple substitution, bringing in Korou Singh, Kwame Peprah, and Sandeep Singh to replace Pritam Kotal, Jesus Jimenez, and Rahul KP respectively. These changes proved beneficial and provided Blasters with renewed momentum. The partnership between Peprah and Korou on the right wing proved effective, as the duo generated numerous attacking possibilities in the Goa penalty area. However, a goal eluded the hosts.In the 81st minute, Blasters nearly equalised from Luna's freekick. His excellent strike targeted the top right-hand corner of the goal, but Goa's goalkeeper Hrithik Tiwari made an outstanding save. The closing minutes saw intense pressure from Blasters, but the Goa defence held firm. Their best opportunity came in the final minute of added-on time when Luna's precise header found Sandeep Singh inside Goa's box. However, his execution was poor, and the ball missed the target.",Boris Singh capitalised on goalkeeper Sachin Suresh's lack of alertness and agility to score the all-important goal. The victory propelled FC Goa to fifth spot in ISL standings with 15 points from nine games. Blasters are stuck in ninth place with 11 points.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115789725,imgsize-103546,width-400,resizemode-4/115789725.jpg"

Jasprit Bumrah compared to Indian great Kapil Dev

NEW DELHI: The Australian media has been heavily promoting the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series, with a particular focus on Virat Kohli , given his immense popularity and fan following in the country.India are scheduled to face Australia in a Pink Ball Test in Adelaide on December 6, following a two-day warm-up match in Canberra against the Prime Minister's XI.During an interview with ABC Sports, several Australian players were asked which Indian player they would like to have in their Test team.While there was no one advocating for Team India skipper Rohit Sharma , Nathan Lyon, Mitchell Marsh , and Alex Carey unanimously expressed their desire to have Virat Kohli in their batting lineup, acknowledging his exceptional batting acumen and the added strength he would bring to their team.Glenn Maxwell, who has played alongside Kohli in the Indian Premier League (IPL) for Royal Challengers Bengaluru, highlighted Kohli's consistent and outstanding performances against Australia across formats.""Well, it's probably hard to get past my RCB teammate. Virat. That's gonna be a popular answer. I don't really care what he does against other nations. But it seems like every time against Australia, he grows a couple of inches and just brings his best performances. He'll be hard work this summer,"" said Maxwell.While Kohli was the popular choice among most Australian players, Steve Smith and Travis Head opted for Jasprit Bumrah , the Indian pace spearhead.Head's reasoning was straightforward – he would prefer not to face Bumrah's formidable bowling skills. ""Bumrah. Don't have to face him,"" added the destructive Australian opener.However, Australian captain Pat Cummins provided a lighthearted and cheeky response, choosing neither Kohli nor Bumrah, much to the amusement of the interviewer.",Several Australian players were asked which Indian player they would like to have in their Test team.

NEW DELHI: Prithvi Shaw faced a major setback at the IPL 2025 mega auction as the opening batter went unsold, with no franchises showing interest in acquiring him.Shaw's struggles with form and fitness have significantly impacted his value, leading to his exclusion from the bidding process.This development marks a significant blow to Shaw's efforts to reignite his career, especially after being released by Delhi Capitals ahead of the auction. With this disappointment, questions loom over Shaw's future in both the IPL and international cricket.In a podcast, Shaw's former coach Jwala Singh explained the reason for the batter's downfall and why he remained unsold at the IPL auction in Jeddah.On being asked by the host that why Shaw disappeared from the scene even though he was extremely talented, Jwala Singh said, ""Prithvi came to me in 2015 and was with me for three years. And when he came he had not played Mumbai Under-16 matches and his father asked me to guide him. Then in next year, he played the Under-19 Cooch Behar Trophy and scored big in selection matches. And I worked very hard on him. Basically he was talented from the beginning, I will not take full credit because many coaches have worked for him, but at that time it was only me. I was excited when he played the Under-19 World Cup because he was my first student to do so. Before leaving for the Under-19 World Cup, he had celebrated his birthday with me. But after that I have not seen him, that was 2017, we are in 2024, I have not seen him, he has not come to me.""On being again asked by the host that when Shaw was emerging on the scene he was compared to legends like Brian Lara Sachin Tendulkar , he made a hundred on Test and then started his problems with the incoming delivery and that grew so much that there are questions raised about his weight, confidence, attitude, so what has Yashasvi Jaiswal done that Shaw couldn't do because both were equally talented?Jwala Singh, who was also the coach of Yashasvi Jaiswal, replies, ""I think the process, which we call work ethic, so I feel if you are talented, talent is just a seed, to make it a tree, consistency is very important in that journey and that consistency comes from your lifestyle, your work ethic and discipline, so what I feel is that consistency is not with him. One can make great start which he did but to stay at the top in international cricket, one has to improve his game all the time. Even Sachin Tendulkar refined his game consistently, fine-tuned his game, worked on his fitness and mental toughness. So I feel a player goes off track only if he gets away from the process. You will not fall back if your process and work ethic is fine, so I feel players fail because of that. As far as Yashasvi is concerned, is work ethic is superb, he really works hard and he knows what to do. That is the main difference.""Following disappointing performances in the first two rounds of the 2024 Ranji Trophy, Shaw was dropped from Mumbai's squad for the third round.Reports indicate that the decision was influenced not just by his poor form but also by disciplinary concerns, including missed training sessions, adding to his struggles.Shaw's journey has been a rollercoaster of highs and lows. In 2018, he was named by the ICC as one of the top five breakout stars in men's cricket, showcasing immense potential.However, his career hit a stumbling block in 2019 when he received a doping ban from the BCCI, ruling him out of action until November that year.","Prithvi Shaw, base price Rs 75 lakh, failed to attract a bid at IPL 2025 mega auction.

CHENNAI: With nerves running high, Vijay Shankar couldn't bring himself to watch the IPL mega auction. It wasn't until a call from his wife that he found out he was returning to Chennai Super Kings . Having spent two formative years with the franchise, an evolved Vijay Shankar is back where it all began for him, after a decade.In an interview with TOI, Vijay Shankar, who was purchased for 1.20 crore, said he was glad to find out that his former team, Gujarat Titans , and CSK were battling for him.""To be very honest, I didn't watch the auction at all, especially when my name popped up. I didn't see it because, as players, it's very difficult to just sit and watch what's happening there. My wife called me and congratulated me that I got picked by CSK-that's when I knew,"" he said.""I made my IPL debut with CSK 10 years ago. I might have played just one game, but the two years that I was part of that franchise were filled with a lot of learnings. I felt happy being part of CSK, and then to get back after 10 years, it's great.""For someone who has played cricket in Tamil Nadu for so many years and has been a consistent performer across all formats, he said the homecoming is very special and he is eager to step onto the MA Chidambaram stadium, where he still ""gets butterflies in the stomach"".""For every TN cricketer, I'm sure their first dream would have been to enter Chepauk and play a match there. During my under-14 tournaments, we used to go practise at the Chepauk 'B' ground, and after that, we would just go and have a look at the stadium. The aura it has is something unbelievable. So from that to playing for CSK or against CSK in the last few years, it was very special. It's very hard to explain that feeling.""The 33-year-old all-rounder, who also bowls medium pace, said he is flexible to bat at any position and bowl whenever the team needs him. ""I always see myself and my role as someone who goes in and does what the team needs in that situation because I always feel like I can adapt to it quickly. It's both my strength and weakness - to be able to adapt to different situations or conditions. If you see in all the IPL matches that I've played, I have batted in almost every position, from three to eight. I also feel that, in cricket right now, if you're not a top-three batter, then you should be really versatile.""And even in terms of my bowling, I'll always keep bowling, whether they give me the ball or not. If you see my bowling, I haven't bowled regularly even for TN, but whenever the team needs me to bowl, I'll always be there. It has always been like that. So again, it's a very difficult space to be in because you don't know whether you're going to bowl or what's going to happen, but you have to keep preparing for that. In the last two years, there wouldn't have been a single practice session where I didn't bowl in the nets,"" Vijay Shankar said.Speaking about MS Dhoni , Vijay Shankar, who has shared the dressing room with the legendary wicketkeeper-batter quite a few times, said: ""Ever since I started playing, Mahi bhai has been a great example - the way a leader should be, how one should carry himself on the field...We've all looked up to him.""Vijay Shankar said the past three seasons with Gujarat Titans was a big learning curve for him. ""I feel GT is one of the very special teams because of the way they handled every individual. It was very good. The way (coach) Ashish Nehra and the support staff managed everyone was incredible. I think they were able to take care of every player, and even net bowlers were treated equally in the team. The amount of time that we get to practise there was huge, and as players, when you train that much, you're always ready to go in and do whatever the team needs.""",Vijay Shankar was bought by Chennai Super Kings for 1.20 crore. The 33-year-old made his IPL debut with CSK 10 years ago.

He is always hungry for runs and it makes him different from the others. I think he is an all-format player. He can play equally well in Tests as well as in the limited-over versions,"" said Chopra during an event on Thursday.Jaiswal lit up Perth in his maiden Test on Australian soil, hammering a glorious 161 in the second innings. The dashing opener's heroics were pivotal in securing a 1-0 lead for India in the five-match Border-Gavaskar Trophy series.""In a nutshell his scores of 0 and 161 in Perth explains his life. You can call his journey from zero to hero. When he came to Mumbai from a small town Bhadohi (Uttar Pradesh), he was zero. But over the years his relentless hard work with desire to succeed made him a hero. He is just 22 and with age on his side, he is poised to become one of the greatest batsmen of the world,"" said Chopra.The Delhi-based cricketer played just 10 Test matches but one of the highlights of his career was doing well in the 2003 series in Australia. He scored 186 runs in four Tests to help India draw the series 1-1.Regular captain Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill are slated to make comeback in the second Test starting in Adelaide on December 6 and it means KL Rahul , who has done well in Perth, will have to come down the order.""When your name is Rahul, you are supposed to bat at any order. Rahul Dravid had done it before and now it is the turn of KL Rahul. I believe he will have to bat at No. 6 in the second Test where he batted most of his career. The momentum is with the Indian team after winning the opening Test quite convincingly. I am sure India will retain the BGT with their all-round performance,"" said Chopra.The 47-year-old feels next year's Champions Trophy, scheduled to be played in Pakistan, can't happen without India's participation. After India refused to travel to Pakistan, the ICC Champions Trophy 's future hangs in balance with the final call regarding its schedule to be made in the ICC board meeting on Friday.""The right choice should be made, and it is beyond our understanding what would be the right call. India's travel to Pakistan is not decided by the BCCI but by the Indian government. If they have decided not to travel to Pakistan, then it is completely right.

Amarnath highlighted Kohli’s unwavering commitment, both as a batter and a team player, which makes him a joy to watch.Amarnath, one of the finest all-rounders of his era and a key player in India’s 1983 World Cup triumph, encouraged young cricketers to take inspiration from Kohli.""The person I really enjoy watching and admire is Virat Kohli,"" Legendary Indian all-rounder Amarnath said at the launch of his book: 'Fearless: A Memoir'. The book launch was graced by External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar ""The way he plays, the kind of passion he has been showing over a period of time, and the way he has been playing and performing, it is brilliant. I think youngsters have a lot to learn from him.""Amarnath, 74, expressed his delight at the stellar performance of young opener Yashasvi Jaiswal , who scored a magnificent century in the first Test against Australia in Perth, playing a crucial role in India’s memorable victory.""I am very pleased for any youngster to come and do well because we all start as young, because when you get an opportunity, you have to grab it with both hands, which they have done, and Jaiswal especially.""If you see his record, it's unbelievable, he has been very consistent, I hope this form continues and he is a very positive player which I like. Because one failure, it doesn't make you bad, but if you have the talent, I am sure things will only get better with time.""When asked if captain Rohit Sharma should open the batting in the Adelaide Test, he said, ""I am sure they will work it, they are in the middle of things. I don't think they require any opinions from anybody, they know how to go about it.""They are all experienced players and they understand the situation and the combinations and all that, so I am sure they will work it out,"" said the Indian batting great .Amarnath, who amassed 4,378 runs in 69 Tests and 1,924 runs in 85 ODIs during his career from 1969 to 1989, declined to draw comparisons between the iconic 1983 World Cup-winning team and the current Indian side, emphasizing that each era has its own unique challenges and achievements.""The format is different altogether, in 1983 we were playing 60 overs of a shorter version and this is a Test series we are playing. But there is a lot of talent in this team. Experience also counts.""So I think it is a mixture of youth and experience like our 1983 team. I am very pleased with the way they are playing, but I think one game is over, I am sure they will forget about it and they will look forward to the season.""",Former Indian cricketer Mohinder Amarnath has expressed his admiration for batting maestro Virat Kohli. The 74-year-old praised the passion and energy Kohli brings to the game. He also expressed his delight at the stellar performance of young opener Yashasvi Jaiswal.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115779116,imgsize-59864,width-400,resizemode-4/115779116.jpg"
