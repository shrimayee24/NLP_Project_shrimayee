IND vs AUS: Rohit Sharma dropped! Exclusive visuals of his last session with India Test team

The Australian cricket team erupted in joy after what seemed to be an astonishing team catch off Virat Kohli ’s first ball on the opening day of the fifth Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground.However, third umpire Joel Wilson ruled it not out.Kohli edged the ball to Steve Smith in the slips, who dived low to his right and managed to pop the ball up, allowing Marnus Labuschagne to take the catch.Despite this, the decision was overturned by Wilson, as it appeared that the ball had grazed the ground after Smith’s attempt.This ruling has sparked considerable debate among fans and experts alike.Former Australia opener and coach Justin Langer believes Kohli was out. “From what I have seen there, that makes it more obvious to me that should have been out. Steve Smith had his fingers (underneath the ball), and you could see he was flicking the ball up, it was brilliant what he did,” he said on 7 Cricket.“He had his fingers under the ball, he flicked it up deliberately and in my opinion that’s out.”Ricky Ponting agreed with Langer.“As far as I was concerned, if (the ball) had’ve come out of (Smith’s) hand, he wouldn’t have been able to scoop it up,” he said on 7 Cricket.“I think his fingers are clearly underneath the ball … look where his pointer figure is there, it’s still underneath the ball.”Former Test umpire Simon Taufel on Channel 7 explained why the Virat Kohli first-ball review was hard to judge.“I think you described it very well when you said that depending upon which side of the fence you sit on you could probably build a case for either decision to be given,” he said.“Listening to Joel Wilson’s language there, where he said the fingers were underneath the ball and then he’s seen it roll on to the ground, by his own language he is telling us that he believes he’s seeing that ball on the ground.“So, there are two things that the TV umpire here is looking for. One is fingers underneath the ball. He was satisfied there. But then he believes through those pictures that he’s clearly seen the ball on the ground.“And here’s the challenge, slowing it right down with slow-mo. Play it at real speed and it looks pretty good.“I can certainly understand what the third umpire’s done there. He believes he’s seen the ball on the ground and called it way he’s seen it. Normally the ICC protocol on fair catches is if you see the fingers underneath the ball, that’s good to maintain a fair catch.“But here’s the problem: the on-field umpire’s no longer have the soft signal and make the decision, it’s purely in the hands of the television umpire now.”Mark Waugh, in commentary for Fox, also felt it was out.“Virat Kohli will breath a huge sigh of relief, Australian fans will feel they’ve been robbed, Indian fans (it’s) desperate relief,” Isa Guha said on Fox Cricket.Mark Waugh believes the finger was underneath the ball when it touched the turf.“It would’ve been a great catch … I think it was … he’s not happy,” he said.“You see his right finger just underneath it … I think he’s got away with one there Kohli.”Former Australian greater Allan Border was unsure. “Those ones looks so close, it’s hard to tell,” he said.Ex-India allrounder Irfan Pathan said Kohli was rightly given not out.“Virat Kohli was not out which was rightly called NOT OUT. will explain during the break,” Pathan wrote on X.","Virat Kohli edged the ball to Steve Smith in the slips, who dived low to his right and managed to pop the ball up, allowing Marnus Labuschagne to take the catch.

Travis Kelce’s Expression For Taylor Swift Has Sent Fans In A Frenzy



Taylor Swift And Travis Kelce Have Always Been There For Each Other



Travis Kelce and his older brother Jason Kelce recently hosted the popular basketball player Caitlin Clark on their very popular New Heights podcast. As the trio engaged in a discussion about sports and life, Clark revealed that her mother is “obsessed” with Travis’ girlfriend, Taylor. While she narrated her mother’s “obsession”, fans noticed something different about Travis’ expression and it sent the whole Taylor fandom into a frenzy.The more and more Clark talked about going to Taylor’s Eras tour with her mom in Indianapolis, Travis was seen blushing and smiling ear to ear. It seemed very evident that Travis could not stop gushing as another athlete spoke about how great Taylor is at what she does.While Travis has anyway been certified as a “green flag” by the fans of Travis’ girlfriend, it looked like this sealed the deal for the fans. Fans have now named this smile of Travis’ whenever Taylor is around or is mentioned as “The Taysmile .”This is not the first time though that Travis has been sported with this “Taysmile.” Fans have noticed that whenever Travis is around Taylor or hanging out with her or someone praises her, Travis just can't control himself from smiling ear to ear.Travis seemed like one excited and proud boyfriend as Clark goes on to describe how Taylor’s Eras Tour was a memorable experience for her that she enjoyed with her cousins and family. She also described that Taylor’s Eras Tour concert in Indianapolis was held so close to her home that on Day 3 of the event, she enjoyed it from her balcony.Travis and Taylor have always seemed to support each other’s careers. While Taylor was still performing for her Eras Tour concerts, she would make time for Travis and fly to watch him play and cheer him on. Similarly, Travis managed his commitments towards his NFL team, the Kansas City Chiefs, and attended Taylor’s Eras Tour concert whenever he could take out some time from his matches.Their families have also been pretty involved in their relationship. Taylor’s parents have been spotted quite often cheering on Travis as he takes the field for the Kansas City Chiefs. Similarly, Travis’ family has also gone and attended Taylor’s Eras Tour concerts whenever it got too much for Travis to manage both his commitment towards his team and attending Taylor’s concerts.While Travis is supposed to skip tomorrow’s match against the Denver Broncos and will be directly seen playing in the playoffs, Taylor too has taken a break in her career. Taylor’s fans are now waiting for her to announce her next project but it does not look like she will do it soon. She is enjoying her time in New York City with Travis Kelce and will probably announce her next move in her career within the first half of this year. Fans are waiting for an update from Taylor Swift.Also Read: Chiefs' TE Travis Kelce’s girlfriend, Taylor Swift, makes waves in Canada, leaving an unexpected mark on the economy and culture","Travis Kelce and his older brother Jason Kelce recently hosted the popular basketball player Caitlin Clark on their very popular New Heights podcast.

Patrick Mahomes’ Mother, Randi Martin’s Cryptic Post On Instagram



Patrick Mahomes Has Played Pretty Well This Season



The quarterback of the Kansas City Chiefs and the NFL star, Patrick Mahomes is professionally and personally on cloud nine. His team, the Kansas City Chiefs, have made it to the playoffs and his wife, Brittany Mahomes, is due to give birth to their third child. But his family has been dealing with his grandfather’s health issues and Patrick’s mother has dropped another cryptic post on her Instagram story that has fans worried.Recently, Patrick’s mother, Randi Martin, took to her Instagram story and shared a post that said, “Sometimes the most powerful prayer is God, I trust you.” Patrick’s mother’s caption on the story read as, “Trust in the Lord”. While it is not known what she is indicating at, she had recently asked her followers to pray for her father’s health. This is also the second post in a row where she has mentioned about the power of prayers.Patrick’s grandfather, Randy Martin, has not been doing well for a couple of months now. A few days ago she had posted a selfie with her father and asked her followers to pray for him. While the family and the NFL star, Patrick Mahomes, have maintained silence over what actually happened to Patrick’s grandfather, Randy Martin, Patrick’s mother has been pretty active with how her father has been doing.This all began in the month of September last year when Patrick’s mother, Randi Martin, had first appealed to her fans to send prayers for her father since he was hospitalised back then. Later in November, Randi Martin updated her fans with pictures from the Mahomes family’s Thanksgiving celebrations. While Patrick Mahomes, his wife Brittany Mahomes and their two children, Sterling and Bronze, were missing from the pictures Randi shared on her Instagram, fans were quick to spot the presence of Patrick’s grandfather in the pictures.Patrick’s maternal grandfather looked healthy in the pictures from the Mahomes’ family’s Thanksgiving celebrations as he posed happily with his family. After that there has been no update from the Mahomes family regarding the well being of Patrick’s maternal grandfather, Randy Martin, until Patrick’s mother recently asked her followers to pray for her father.Patrick Mahomes has performed exceptionally well in the 2024 NFL season. After defeating the Pittsburgh Steelers on the Christmas Day games, as per sources, the head coach of the Kansas City Chiefs had allowed Patrick to go on a break before the playoffs so that he would come back well prepared.This also gave the time to Patrick to recharge and spend some quality time with his pregnant wife, Brittany Mahomes, and their two toddlers, Sterling and Bronze. Patrick and Brittany will be welcoming their third child shortly as stated by Patrick in an interview last week.Also Read: Unnamed man’s 'inappropriate' dance with Travis Hunter’s fiancée turns him into an overnight sensation as Travis and his fiancée stay silent amid hate","NFL star, Patrick Mahomes’ mother, Randi Martin, has shared a cryptic post on her Instagram story.

Poll Who would you like to see as a captain in Test Cricket? Jasprit Bumrah Rohit Sharma

NEW DELHI: The heated exchange between Jasprit Bumrah and Sam Konstas on the first day of the fifth Test at the SCG became a big talking point in the cricketing circles on Friday.India captain Rohit Sharma , who stood down from the match owing to poor form, spoke on the issue and slammed the young Aussie opener for his conduct on the field, stating that unnecessary banter is unbecoming of players.""Our boys, till they're calm, will remain calm. If you keep poking them, not everyone is going to remain calm. Cricket khelo, yeh faaltu ke cheeze, bol bachchan karna, shobha nahi dete (Play cricket and these meaningless stuff and unnecessary banter doesn't suit you.) Our boys are classy. We focus on what our job is and work towards it,"" said Rohit while speaking to Star Sports.Speaking on Channel 7, former Australia captain Ricky Ponting also criticised Konstas for his altercation with Bumrah.""One guy you don't want to upset is Jasprit Bumrah. The way he's bowled and the fact he has got Khawaja out five times in the series. I didn't like Konstas getting involved. That was not his battle to fight. It was between Khawaja and Bumrah.""The incident occurred when Australian opener Usman Khawaja delayed Bumrah's delivery, signaling that he wasn't ready to take strike just as Bumrah began his run-up. Adding to the tension, Konstas intervened, gesturing at Bumrah to stop.""What's the problem?"" Bumrah was heard asking Konstas as the two players approached each other in a confrontational manner. The on-field umpire quickly stepped in to diffuse the situation and separated the two.Bumrah, however, had the final word moments later. On the very next delivery, he dismissed Khawaja with a full-length ball that induced an outside edge, neatly taken by KL Rahul in the slips.Rather than celebrating the wicket, Bumrah turned to Konstas and delivered an icy death stare, adding another layer of intensity to the SCG showdown.",Jasprit Bumrah and Sam Konstas involved in heated exchange on first day of fifth Test at the SCG.

Cam Newton bashed Eric Dickerson's views on Philadelphia Eagles star Saquon Barkley

No RECORD, No PAYDAY!! The High-Stakes NFL Contracts & Incentives

Cam Newton bashed Eric Dickerson 's views on Philadelphia Eagles star Saquon Barkley , who previously showed disinterest in the Eagles' RB's record-breaking single-season rushing yards. Hall of Fame Dickerson admitted that he is not supporting Barkley to break his 2,105-yard single-season rushing record which has remained unchallenged since 1984's glory days. He is going to make history by playing a high-stakes match against his former team. However, his cold-shouldered stance has sparked a heated debate about the responsibility of sports legends to ""pass the torch.""Cam Newton has criticized Eric Dickerson's comments about Saquon Barkley, who previously expressed his skepticism about the Eagles RB's ability to break his single-season rushing yards record. Dickerson argued that if Barkley broke the record, it would be in 17 games, not 16.Newton said, “We got to stop being haters.” Taking to his ‘4th&1 show,’ the former quarterback said, “Eric Dickerson, come on bro. That’s almost like gatekeeping a little bit. Come on bro, we know you did it in lesser games.”The chances of Barkley breaking his single-season record of 2,105 rushing yards are slim as he needs only 101 yards against a struggling Giants run defense. This may dash the Eagles' dream of hoisting a second Super Bowl trophy, which would have been a beautiful sight for fans. Nevertheless, Dickerson can sleep peacefully.ESPN NFL insider Adam Schefter predicts that Barkley's suitability for Sunday's game is highly unlikely, expressing skepticism that the Eagles would risk their prized running back with a Super Bowl run on the horizon. “I’d be floored if Saquon Barkley is on the field this weekend,” Schefter said. The Eagles, locked into the NFC’s No. 2 seed, have little to gain by playing Barkley and everything to lose if he gets injured ahead of the playoffs.The playoffs would require a healthy and rested quarterback Aaron Barkley for the Eagles, which is considered the best team Philadelphia has had in years. On paper, the Eagles look very good both on offense and defense, but rested Barkley enough in the fourth quarters to accumulate those extra yards much earlier into the season.Also Read: Lions WR Amon-Ra St. Brown has voiced his frustrations with the NFL's current playoff seeding system, suggesting potential modifications Barkley's opportunity to break the record is slim, but a Super Bowl appearance would be a big disappointment for both the Eagles and the team. If Barkley succeeds, his name will go down in NFL history forever, and he will be immortal. Head coach Nick Sirianni might not play him for long periods of time with the playoffs fast approaching.","Cam Newton bashed Eric Dickerson's views on Philadelphia Eagles star Saquon Barkley.

They formed one of the best high school basketball teams ever, and their family became recognized for their basketball skills. Right now, LiAngelo is not playing basketball. He played for the Greensboro Swarm in the NBA G League in the 2021-22 and 2022-23 seasons. Most recently, he joined Astros de Jalisco in Mexico.But LiAngelo isn't just focused on basketball.

The song even caught the attention of Shareef O'Neal , the son of NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal , who praised the song. LiAngelo is showing that he has a lot of talent outside of basketball and is excited to see where his music career takes him. Even though he is not playing basketball at the moment, he is still making moves and gaining attention in the music world.Shareef O'Neal, like LiAngelo Ball, has spent time in the NBA G League and worked hard to build his basketball career. He also played for the LA Lakers during the Summer League. In the 2022-23 season, O'Neal played for the G League Ignite, where he scored an average of 5.6 points and grabbed 3.1 rebounds per game in 20 games.

After the song was released and received positive feedback from fans, Lonzo took to X to express his love for the track.

Poll Who’s More Consistent Across Formats for Australia? Pat Cummins Mitchell Starc

IND vs AUS: Prasidh Krishna on Jasprit Bumrah, Virat Kohli captaincy, mood in team and more

NEW DELHI: The hearts of hundreds of thousands, glued to television screens, stopped for a moment when visuals showed India's talisman, Jasprit Bumrah , in a black SUV heading for scans on Saturday.While his return to the ground after completing the necessary scans was met with optimism, it remains uncertain whether Bumrah, believed to be carrying a back spasm, is fit enough to play a role as the series approaches its conclusion.Beyond Bumrah's awe-inspiring performances, his workload has drawn significant attention from cricket observers. In the Border-Gavaskar Trophy 2024/25 , there hasn’t been a single day where Bumrah hasn’t made an impact, whether with the bat or ball.With 860 deliveries and 31 wickets in just five Tests of the series, Bumrah has been instrumental to India's success in this series.However, having put in his relentless efforts and overs bowled, he doesn’t rank among the top two most efficient workhorses of the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy.To be more precise, Australia’s skipper Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc have both bowled more deliveries and spent more time at the crease while batting than Jasprit Bumrah in this BGT.If we dive deep into the numbers, Cummins has scored 159 runs off 251 balls so far, while Starc has amassed 97 runs from 247 balls. In comparison, Bumrah has contributed 42 runs off 87 balls.With the ball, Starc and Cummins have bowled 153.2 (920 balls) and 163 (978 balls) overs, respectively, with Bumrah completing 151.2 overs (908 balls) so far in this BGT.Though, Bumrah has been the most lethal with 31 scalps, followed by Cummins's 23 wickets and Starc's 18 thus far.With a back spasm understood to have forced Bumrah's scans, it remains unclear whether he will take the field tomorrow as India ended the day at 141/6, holding a lead of 145 runs.ALSO SEE: Jasprit Bumrah update: 'Okay' to bat but decision on bowling to be taken on Sunday morning","Jasprit Bumrah has been instrumental to India's success in this series.

LA Knight Reflects on Unfulfilled NXT Faction Idea

LA Knight , one of WWE's most electrifying performers, recently revealed a unique faction idea he pitched while still in NXT . In a recent interview, the WWE SmackDown star discussed his vision for a group inspired by the popular TV show, The Walking Dead: The Saviors.Speaking with WittyWhitter , Knight explained that he envisioned a faction inspired by the popular television show The Walking Dead. In his concept, a charismatic leader would bring together a group of talented individuals, elevating them to prominence within NXT.""I had thought about this before, actually. I pitched this a few years ago, where i was like, I kind of want guys who are almost downtrodden, who have a lot of potential, but haven't really been used necessarily to the top of the potential. I don't know who those would be now, I think I had names years ago when I was in NXT because I almost wanted to have this... you could say cult. But I was almost thinking of, this was back thinking about like The Walking Dead, like The Saviors or something. One guy at the front, and then there's a lot of guys who are just like, 'all right, wait, this guy is going to be able to get me what I want. I will do anything for him.' Kind of an idea. Other than that, I haven't really put much thought into it, but I mean, if you were going to do like a big three, Miami Heat LeBron super team or something like that, you know, probably, I don't know, me and Cody and Roman or something.""Knight recently made headlines for a minor car accident before a WWE live event in Baltimore. Despite the fender bender, he still managed to deliver a captivating performance, showcasing his dedication to the craft.

India will not play the World Test Championship ( WTC ) Final for the third time in a row after losing the fifth and final Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia. Desperately needing a win to keep slim hopes alive, Australia won by 6-wickets in Sydney to shatter those chances. Instead, the Pat Cummins-led side confirmed their place in the final for a second-time in a row.The reigning champions Australia will face South Africa in the WTC Final from 11-15 June, 2025 at Lord's. It will be the first time that Lord's will be used for the WTC Final, with Southampton the venue for the first edition (2021) and The Oval the venue for the second edition (2023), which were won by New Zealand and Australia, respectively.At the resumption of the fifth Test, Australia were second in the standings on 61.46 percentage points while India were third on 52.78. The win maintained Australia in the second place, on 63.73 rating points. Meanwhile, India, too, remained third but conceded points, dropping to 50.00.It has been a massive free-fall for the Indian cricket team since mid-October. As they prepared to host New Zealand, India had their fate firmly in their grasp. A whitewash and they would qualify for the WTC Final even before setting foot in Australia. However, India were blanked 0-3 with Ajaz Patel (15 wickets) and Mitchell Santner (13 wickets) proving decisive for the visitors.During this tour of Australia, India started confidently, winning the opening Test in Perth by 295 runs. But have struggled to put runs on board in the subsequent four Tests to lose the series 3-1.Australia won the pink-ball Test by 10-wickets, the fourth Test at MCG by 184 runs and finally the SCG Test by 6-wickets with the Test at Gabba drawn due to consistent rain.","India will not play the World Test Championship ( WTC ) Final for the third time in a row after losing the fifth and final Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia.

Panaji: The question was expected and Manolo Marquez had a ready answer.Asked for his opinion on Brison Fernandes , the first Indian player to score a brace in consecutive matches in the Indian Super League (ISL), the FC Goa coach asked reporters to refer to his press conferences from last season.“The best Indian player that I trained in my four seasons (here in India), this was my sentence during press conferences (last season),” Manolo said after the 4-2 win against Odisha FC in Bhubaneswar on Saturday. “But why was he not playing (regularly). Because the coach is bad? Or because now he’s a top professional. Brison is now a real player.“He’s taking care of rest, food, and entering the pitch knowing perfectly what he has to do in attack, in defence. Football is not only in attack. Previously, we were expecting that Brison will receive the ball and can do something. Now he’s scoring goals and (also) working a lot for the team. I am very, very happy because he's a great guy, and I think that everyone in Goa can be very satisfied with him.”Goa secured an important win against Odisha, their sixth in the last seven matches. That his side could win against Sergio Lobera’s, who have maintained an impressive home record in Bhubaneswar, Manolo was pleased with the result.“I think it's the second defeat in the last two seasons, only Chennaiyin FC were able to win here. I feel that we didn't play a very good first half, it was very equal, similar, but it's the second goal, Udanta (Singh) finished in the first half, and the third goal, when they were trying to equalise the game. I think the third goal practically killed the game, because we scored the fourth and we could score more goals, but it's normal (to concede). When you are losing, you have to risk,” said Manolo.Goa face Hyderabad at home in their next match on Jan 8.

IND vs AUS: Prasidh Krishna on Jasprit Bumrah, Virat Kohli captaincy, mood in team and more

IND vs AUS: Rishabh Pant on dropped Rohit Sharma, criticism, Jasprit Bumrah

SYDNEY : Magic and madness held sway at the SCG on Saturday. Day 2 played out in reels as both teams hurtled from disaster to deliverance and back again. Fifteen wickets fell on what could turn out to be the penultimate day of this captivating series.First off, Jasprit Bumrah, the gift that has kept on giving, hobbled out with back spasms. That resulted in the biggest surprise of the day as India’s support cast of pacers, instead of wilting, rose to the task and delivered their best performance of the tour.Resuming their first innings at 9/1, Australia found themselves 39/4 in no time. Marnus Labuschagne nicked and refused to walk until prompted by the third umpire. Everyone else found lateral movement, Mohammed Siraj found swing. He got rid of the impetuous Sam Konstas, then the formidable Travis Head, and celebrated as if possessed by the gremlins in the unreadable pitch.Prasidh Krishna (3/42 off 15 overs) recovered from an initial hammering at the hands of Steve Smith, settled on his length and stopped Australia’s talisman five short of the 10,000-run mark at the stroke of lunch. Even Nitish Kumar Reddy chipped in with some decisive strikes.The 31-year-old debutant Beau Webster (57 off 105 balls; 5x4) displayed impeccable footwork and a measured approach to score the first half-century of the game and push Mitchell Marsh’s Test prospects in deep freeze for the time being. Yet, Australia fell four short of India’s first-innings score of 185.India, suitably chastised after their batters plodded their way through the first innings, made a U-turn and decided to go for the jugular. Yashasvi Jaiswal set the tone. Rishabh Pant (61 off 33; 6x4, 4x6) then brought the house down by scoring the second-fastest Test fifty by an Indian off 29 balls, failing to equal his own record by one ball.Unlike Day One, Pant freed his mind. The rest followed. In the first innings, he had been circumspect, under pressure to knuckle down after a series of missteps in the earlier Test. By misfortune or circumstance, he had unleashed his inner Cheteshwar Pujara, taken multiple blows on the body and patted back juicy half volleys. And, he had still walked out looking ordinary.There were reparations to be made. On Day Two, he was fury unleashed, a whirling dervish on the SCG stage announcing his elemental genius with childish glee. His batting left the 47,257-strong crowd breathless. On his first ball, Pant charged at the fearsome Scott Boland (4/42 off 13 overs) and sent the ball soaring for six, then nonchalantly fist-pumped his partner at the other end, Shubman Gill, who looked on in amazement.Pat Cummins was flicked for four and Pant was away. He took a particular liking to Webster, the relative weak link in the strong Aussie attack, and unleashed the disbalanced pull which has become a trademark.The 22nd over of the innings was peak Pant. Mitchell Starc — whose 147 kph thunderbolts had left large black bruises on Pant’s body on Friday — was hit for two consecutive sixes between the midwicket and square leg area. A century here and India could dream of walking away with the game. Instead, just as suddenly, like all things Pant, the spell broke. The drinks break happened, of all things, yanking him out of the zone.The canny Cummins was waiting immediately, having decided to switch to T20 lines. The first ball jagged back slightly in the corridor of uncertainty. Pant refused to take the bait. The next delivery was a no-brainer, short, wide, asking to be hit. Pant unfurled his bat and only managed an edge. The spark was gone. India were back to looking like an ordinary batting side.“It’s a lot of risk but that’s the way the game is played today,” Prasidh Krishna would muse later about Pant’s innings.In between, Gill did his Test game no justice by charging down to Webster and paying the price. And Kohli? What of Kohli? He flirted with the sixth stump line again, was jilted again, and left heartbroken and fuming at his own frailties. Possibly this was his last innings on Australian soil, a master leaving the arena sans his superpowers. There were some jeers and boos too.Pant’s cameo may not be enough for India to pull through, for they took stumps only 145 runs ahead, with Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar left to do some serious stonewalling on Day Three. It may not be an easy task, for the pitch may play evil wizard in Sunday’s tale and dictate proceedings.Australia coach Andrew McDonald, however, tried to play down its role.“Has the wicket favoured the bowlers a little more than what we expected and the ground staff expected? There’s no doubt about that but it’s made for interesting cricket,” he said. “Low-scoring games like these, they just heighten the pressure. There’s a long way still to go.”Prasidh Krishna, who reaped the benefits of bowling on this surface, said, “It’s getting difficult in some areas, it’s keeping low, but sometimes there’s enough bounce for us to be in the game and look for those edges.”More than the pitch, this series has been all about Bumrah. If India’s standin captain is not available to bowl anymore in this game, it could be advantage Australia on judgement day.","Jasprit Bumrah hobbled out with back spasms. India's support cast of pacers, instead of wilting, rose to the task and delivered their best performance of the tour.

IND vs AUS: Rishabh Pant on dropped Rohit Sharma, criticism, Jasprit Bumrah

SYDNEY: India's out of form Test and ODI captain Rohit Sharma has cleared the air on the decision to miss the fifth Test against Australia, insisting that he took the call on his own, in the team’s interest, and he has not called time on his Test career.“This is not a retirement decision, nor am I stepping aside from the game. I stood down from this Test because the bat isn’t talking. There’s no guarantee I won’t get the runs two or five months later. We’ve seen it a lot in cricket. I believe things will change. At the same time, I’ve to be realistic as well,” Rohit told Star Sports in an interview on Saturday.“It was a difficult decision, but if you keep everything in mind, this was a sensible decision. I’m not thinking too far. Right now, what does the team need? That’s what I was thinking. Nothing else,” he added.“If there’s someone with a mic, laptop or a pen, what they say doesn’t change our lives. We’ve played this game for so long. These people cannot decide when we go, when we shouldn’t play, when we should sit outside or when I should captain. I’m sensible, mature, a father of two. I have some idea about what I want in life.”Intrigue has surrounded Rohit’s decision, since it is unprecedented for an Indian cricket captain to opt out because of bad form. A captain usually walks into the side, but a day before the Test, head coach Gautam Gambhir refused to confirm whether Rohit would play, raising eyebrows. BCCI too did not make the decision official, spurring intense speculation.Doubts have subsequently been raised about Rohit’s future as an active international cricketer because of his age and the steep decline in batting form, which he has cited as the reason for stepping down. There have also been suggestions he was nudged by Gambhir and selection committee chief Ajit Agarkar to opt out of this all-important Test, which India need to win to retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.Rohit, however, said he had taken the call on his own.“I made this decision after coming here (Sydney). We had only two days (three) between the matches...I didn’t want to have this chat with the selector and coach. But it was in my mind that I’m trying my best, I’m not getting the runs. I’ve to accept it and get myself out of the way,"" said Rohit.“The chat I had with the coach and selector was very simple. My bat is not talking. I’m not in form. This is an important match and we need players in form. As it is, the boys are not in great form. We can’t carry out-of-form players. That’s why I thought I should tell the coach and the selector what’s on my mind. They backed my decision. They said you have been playing for so many years, you’re the best judge of what you’re doing.”Rohit averages 10.9 in his last 15 Test innings, with a highest of 52 and 10 singledigit scores. He has also lost five of his last six Tests as captain. In Australia the streak has continued, but there have been other complications.India won the first Test in Perth under Bumrah’s captaincy since Rohit was on paternity leave, with the opening combination of KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal making match-winning contributions. On his return, Rohit shifted to the middle-order, failed to rediscover form and subsequently made an attempt to reclaim his opening slot by dropping regular No. 3 Shubman Gill.These and some other changes made to accommodate Rohit upset the balance of the side, which subsequently lost in Adelaide and Melbourne and was saved by rain in Brisbane.“It’s very, very tough,” Rohit said on having to sit out. “I’ve come from so far away. Have I come to sit outside? I want to play and win the game for my team. From the first time I came to the dressing room in 2007, it’s been all about the team. Sometimes you need to understand what the team needs. If you don’t put the team in front, it’s of no use.”India’s next Test assignment is in the middle of this year, but Rohit is expected to lead the team in the Champions Trophy in February, to be played in the ODI format in more batting-friendly conditions.","Rohit Sharma says he took the call to miss the fifth Test against Australia on his own. India need to win the Test to retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

As the match ended, cricket memes went viral on social media platforms. Here are some of the viral memes that just capture the emotion/sadness of Indian Cricket fans.

Record number of spectators

Australia clinched a thrilling 184-run victory over India in a dramatic final session of the fourth Test in Melbourne, taking a 2-1 lead in the five-match series. India, needing 340 to win, collapsed to 155 all out, losing their last seven wickets for just 34 runs in 20.3 overs. India appeared to be heading for a draw after Yashasvi Jaiswal (84) and Rishabh Pant (30) steered them to 112-3 at tea. However, Pant's dismissal, attempting a six off Travis Head, triggered a batting collapse.Controversy arose with Jaiswal's dismissal. Initially given not out to a caught-behind appeal, the TV umpire overturned the decision based on visual evidence of the ball changing direction, despite the absence of audible noise. Jasprit Bumrah was exceptional for India, taking 5-57 in the second innings and nine wickets in the match. He had reduced Australia to 91-6 at one stage, a lead of less than 200.The match set a record attendance for cricket in Australia, with 373,591 spectators. Head described the atmosphere as inspiring and hailed the match as one of the best he has been involved in. India now needs to win the final Test in Sydney to level the series and retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy .","Australia beat India by 184 runs in the fourth Test in Melbourne.

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli is renowned for his dynamic and passionate engagement with the crowd, which has become an integral part of his persona both on and off the field.The former Indian captain often teases the crowd during matches, adding an element of entertainment to the game. His ability to interact and sometimes lightheartedly provoke the fans has made him a crowd favorite.Kohli is famous for his ""finger on the lips"" gesture to silence rival fans after performing well, such as hitting a crucial boundary or taking a big wicket.

It occurred during Australia's tour of South Africa in March 2018 during the third Test match in Cape Town.During the match, Cameron Bancroft , an Australian player, was caught on camera using a piece of sandpaper to tamper with the cricket ball in an attempt to alter its condition and gain reverse swing for the bowlers. The footage showed Bancroft rubbing the ball with sandpaper and then attempting to hide it in his trousers when he realized he was being filmed by the cameras.Steve Smith, then the captain of the Australian team, admitted in a press conference that the leadership group had devised the plan to tamper with the ball.Smith confessed to being aware of the plan but did not intervene to stop it, acknowledging his failure as a leader and was banned from international and domestic cricket for 12 months and stripped of his captaincy.Smith broke down in a tearful press conference, expressing remorse and taking full responsibility for his actions and the incident tarnished Smith's image, despite his status as one of the greatest batsmen of his generation.","Virat Kohli is renowned for his dynamic and passionate engagement with the crowd.

NEW DELHI: The Indian dressing room was all smiles as Prasidh Krishna let the ball do the talking when Australia began their chase on Day 3 of the fifth Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground.In the absence of Jasprit Bumrah, Prasidh stepped up and delivered just as Bumrah is known to — making crucial early breakthroughs for his team.The Karnataka pacer dismissed Sam Konstas (22), Marnus Labuschagne (6), and Steve Smith (4) in quick succession. However, Bumrah's absence due to back spasms looms large, as India are without a third specialist pacer.Prasidh's dismissal of Labuschagne was followed by a significant scalp—Steve Smith, who fell just one run short of reaching 10,000 Test runs. Prasidh bowled a sharp, rising delivery that Smith awkwardly fended to gully, where Yashasvi Jaiswal dived forward to complete a brilliant catch.The stunning effort from Jaiswal charged up Rohit Sharma , who was seen leaping out of his seat in celebration in the dressing room.Meanwhile, Rohit, addressing retirement rumors on Saturday, clarified his decision to step aside for theSCG Test .""I have not retired. I stood down, that is what I would say. Basically, the chat that I had with the coach and the selector was very simple. That I am not able to score runs, there is no form, it is an important match, and we need a player with form. As it is, in our batting, the form of the boys is not that good,"" Rohit told Star Sports.""So you cannot carry a lot of out-of-form players in the team. This simple thing was going on in my mind. I am not going anywhere. That is why I wanted to tell the coach and the selector that this is what is going on in my mind.""They backed my decision. They said that you have been playing for so many years. You know what you are doing. So for me, it was difficult to take this decision.

NEW DELHI: If the opening day of the fifth Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground was dramatic, Day 2 brought even more high-octane action. After bowling out India for a modest 185 on a grassy SCG pitch, Australia found themselves in trouble at the start of their first innings.

Another controversy erupted early on the first morning of the fifth Test between India and Australia in Sydney when a relay catch involving Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne off Virat Kohli 's bat was ruled by the third umpire as not legitimate.With Indian openers KL Rahul (4) and Yashasvi Jaiswal (10) dismissed early, India were 17 for 2 when Kohli came in to bat and edged the first ball he faced from Scott Boland to the slips, where the Aussie players claimed the relay catch between Smith and Labuschagne.Diving low to his right, Smith believed to have got his fingers underneath the ball before lobbing it in the air for Labuschagne to complete the catch. The decision was referred by the on-field umpires for review, and the third umpire ruled that the ball grazed the ground before Smith lobbed it back up.Talking to Fox Cricket at the lunch break, Smith said he has no doubt that it was a clean catch, but they have to accept the decision taken by the match officials.""Did you get your hand underneath that ball?"" former England player turned commentator Isa Guha asked Smith?""100%, no denying it whatsoever. But the umpires made the decision, and we move on,"" replied Smith.After replays were shown on the giant screen and the third umpire announced his view, Kohli was seen shaking his head with a wry smile on his face.India went to lunch at a shaky 57 for 3, losing Shubman Gill (20) off the last ball delivered by off-spinner Nathan Lyon before the break, leaving Kohli on the crease at 20 not out. He was joined by Rishabh Pant post lunch.Earlier, India left captain Rohit Sharma out of the eleven, with Jasprit Bumrah doing the leadership duty and chose to bat first after winning the toss.India made two changes to their team. Shubman Gill took Rohit's place, while Prasidh Krishna came in for fellow pacer Akash Deep who is out with a back injury.","Third umpire rules Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne's relay catch off Virat Kohli not legitimate.

Sydney: ""We're going to have a look at the wicket and finalise it tomorrow."" ""As I just said, we're going to have a look at the wicket and announce playing 11 tomorrow.""India head coach Gautam Gambhir responded when he was quizzed about the playing XI on eve of the fifth and final Test in Sydney.It was a typical response but what spiced up proceedings was the fact that he was categorically asked about Rohit Sharma 's participation at Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG). Not once, but twice.The response remained the same, even the words to a degree, and certainly raised quite a few eyebrows in the media room. It was Gambhir's first interaction with the media in Australia as the coach mysteriously stayed away after the pre-departure address back in November.He was back in the hot seat at a time when a lot of questions were being raised about the environment in the dressing room, knee-jerk reactions while selecting the XI and the defeat in Melbourne which came after a debatable call to benchThe No. 3 was benched to accommodate Rohit back at top of the order but it didn't work out as the Indian captain's lean patch continued and India were outplayed in the Boxing Day Test.Gambhir was constantly asked about the transition, discussions with senior players and he maintained that ""Indian cricket is in safe hands"" while emphasising the importance of ""honesty"".There was a lot of straight talk during the interaction which lasted a little over ten minutes but it was the sequence of events which followed that added to intrigue of India's last practice session of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy .Moments after finishing the presser, Gambhir engaged in a long conversation with Jasprit Bumrah near the change room as the rest of the lot played foot-volley. Once the warm-up was complete, the head coach made his way to the ground and had a chat with Shubman Gill, who was doing fielding drills at that time with coach T Dilip and Washington Sundar. A short chat was followed by a fist pump, pat on the back and soon Bumrah joined and gave Gill a handshake.The youngster, who was dropped for the Boxing Day Test, continued with more close-in catching drills as the likes of Virat Kohli, Rishabh Pant, KL Rahul, Nitish K Reddy and Yashasvi Jaiswal did some slip-catching. All this while Rohit stood away from the group and didn't participate in the catching drills, which he was very active in before the Melbourne fixture, and was one of the last players to leave the ground as rest of the batters made their way to the nets.Kohli, KL Rahul, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Ravindra Jadeja got the session underway and Rohit, still in his training shorts and sweatshirt, had a long chat with Washington Sundar outside the dressing room.Sundar left and then it was Gill's turn to speak to the skipper and this time they had Bumrah for company too. When the mini-conference was over, all players were sweating it out but Rohit was nowhere to be seen.Kohli, Jaiswal, KL, Jadeja and now Gill too were swapping nets as they continued to face the likes of Sundar, Reddy, Prasidh Krishna, Harshit Rana and a lot of side-arm.The action continued before Rohit finally made an appearance and stood in a corner chatting with video analyst Hari before starting a long, light-hearted chat with Bumrah. The seamer had a ball in his hand and the two cracked plenty of jokes but Rohit didn't look in the mood to have a hit.Players started to leave the area and Rohit exited too, adding to the curiosity of the travelling media contingent. He, however, returned in a few minutes with the batting gear on and had a small hit before India wrapped up their final session of the tour.It wasn't a usual net session as Rohit remains very chatty in the middle and has never stood in a corner, away from all the action. Thursday, however, was different and felt different. Even as the public announcer practiced the names of skippers of the two teams in the main ground, Rohit gave enough hints that he wasn't going to be one for the New Year Test. He has been for quite some time now and it wasn't a surprise that he has been dropped for the final game of the series.All signs in the nets pointed in only one direction and that was Rohit making way for Gill. The coach maintained that the call will be taken on the morning of the match but Rohit's last Test in whites has certainly happened at the Melbourne Cricket Ground and like most stalwarts, he signed off without a farewell match.","India head coach Gautam Gambhir was quizzed about the playing XI on eve of the fifth and final Test in Sydney.

I remember my first Test tour to India, I didn't play in any of the two Tests, but we were sitting there in the second Test in Bangalore (Bengaluru) and Sachin Tendulkar was playing, he had scored some runs and he was coming close to a hundred and all of a sudden Bangalore's stadium was full and louder, more than anything I had ever experienced in cricket. He got to his hundred, they all went nuts and then disappeared. And then he got close to 200, they all came back and it got louder, he got 200, it was loud again and they all disappeared. In terms of some of those big name players, it is extremely loud.""Tendulkar's records, including being the first to score 100 international centuries and amassing over 34,000 international runs, have cemented his legacy, making him an idol for aspiring cricketers worldwide.Tendulkar is admired not only by fans but also by fellow cricketers, athletes, and celebrities, who often express their respect for his skill and demeanor.Sachin's fan base is not just about numbers; it's about the deep emotional connection people feel with him.

NEW DELHI: Due to fewer appearances for the nation due to the presence of the first-choice, more experienced pace trio of captain Pat Cummins Mitchell Starc , and Josh Hazlewood , former Australian pacer Brett Lee praised fiery pacer Scott Boland , referring to him as ""Mr Consistent"" and drawing comparisons to former Australian spinner Stuart MacGill Despite a strong start by openers Yashasvi Jaiswal and KL Rahul in the second innings, India lost quick wickets and finished the day at 141/6, with a 145-run lead and little batting firepower remaining. Boland continued to haunt the Indian team with his accurate line and lengths, taking four wickets.Lee discussed Boland with the media on Saturday in Sydney.""He is a freak. He is good everywhere. He is good here because the wicket suits him. Boland is Mr Consistent. His action makes him good, his consistency, his temperament. And he's under the radar. He is literally the world's nicest guy, he does not ask for the accolades, and he catches people off guard.""However, Lee believes that due to their accomplishments for the squad, the renowned Australian pace trio will always be the team's first choice.""My gut says you have to pick those three (Cummins, Starc, Hazlewood) guys every day of the week,"" he said.""They have achieved so much. Starc and Cummins are obviously playing now because they are fully fit but if Hazlewood gets his fitness back and is ready to play, unfortunately you have to go with Josh Hazlewood, and when I say unfortunately, unfortunately for Scott Boland. A fit Josh Hazlewood gets into any Test line-up, in my opinion,"" he added.Boland's predicament was likened to that of former spinner MacGill, who, in spite of his skill as a spinner, was only able to play 44 Test matches for Australia because of the presence of the renowned Shane Warne , taking 208 wickets at an average of 29.02 during his career.""It's a bit like MacGill and Warne, that is probably the best analogy I could say,"" said Lee.","Former Australian pacer Brett Lee praised fiery pacer Scott Boland.

Former Indian all-rounder Sanjay Bangar praised Rishabh Pant 's dynamic fifty against Australia in Sydney. He believes Pant's courageous performance gives India a chance to win the Test and draw the series.Pant reached his half-century in only 29 balls on day two of the fifth Test. This fifty followed a series of promising starts in four Test matches that unfortunately remained unconverted. He was eventually dismissed by Australian captain Pat Cummins . India finished the day at 141/6, leading by 145 runs.Bangar, speaking on Star Sports, commended Pant for effectively handling Mitchell Starc 's swing and Scott Boland's consistent line and length.""The kind of bravery that Rishabh Pant portrayed with his bat, that is the only reason I think that India is in a position where we are still thinking that we can win this match. If you keep this innings aside, the way he played, the calculative risks that he took, the way he played those shots, because Mitchell Starc's deliveries swing in when the ball gets a bit old so he played the shots towards the square-leg. Scott Boland who hits the length, he stepped out and played him, where there was no fielder in the point region he played those cut shots.""Bangar described Pant's innings as ""composed."" He admired Pant's adaptability, contrasting this innings with his first-innings performance of 40 runs from 98 balls, which included enduring several body blows.""So it was quite a composed innings, it was not that he came out and started playing shots without even thinking anything about it. When he plays like this, he has shown that he is quite diverse and you also expect that when a player has played 40-45 test matches, the way he played in the first innings where he took those blows on his body, sometimes you will have to play like that and you'll have to respect the conditions. And today situation of the match was such that a strategy a was put in place where he played counter-attacking innings and it is quite pleasant to watch when he plays those counter-attacking innings,"" he concluded.Pant's first-innings knock included three fours and a six. He demonstrated resilience and a willingness to absorb physical impact for the team's cause. In contrast, his second-innings approach was marked by calculated aggression and an opportunistic exploitation of scoring opportunities.Pant's performance throughout the Border-Gavaskar Trophy has been below his usual high standards. He has accumulated 255 runs in nine innings across five matches, averaging 28.33 with a strike rate of 59.02.","Former Indian all-rounder Sanjay Bangar praised Rishabh Pant's dynamic fifty against Australia in Sydney.

City turned corner?

Arsenal blew a chance to make up significant ground on Premier League leaders Liverpool on Saturday with a frustrating draw at Brighton as Manchester City pummelled West Ham 4-1.In-form Newcastle inflicted another painful defeat on Ange Postecoglou's struggling Tottenham and Chelsea's recent woes continued with a 1-1 draw at Crystal Palace.Mikel Arteta's Arsenal, Premier League runners-up over the past two seasons, travelled to the south coast hunting a fourth straight league win in the evening kick-off.Seventeen-year-old Ethan Nwaneri, in for the injured Bukayo Saka, scored a first-half goal to put them on course for a vital three points.But after being felled by an accidental headbutt from William Saliba, stand-in Seagulls captain Joao Pedro fired home from the spot in the 61st minute.The 1-1 draw means the second-placed Gunners are five points behind Liverpool, having played two games more, with Arne Slot's in-form leaders hosting crisis-hit Manchester United on Sunday.Arteta said his team had under-performed in the second half, failing to build momentum, adding that the penalty award was ""bizarre"".""We are really disappointed with the decision that leads to the goal because I have never seen something like this in my life,"" the Spaniard told the BBC.""He (Saliba) touches the ball as well.""Manchester City's win at home against West Ham means they have now won successive matches for the first time since October and Pep Guardiola will hope they are back on track after a horror run of one victory in 13 games in all competitions.The defending champions took an early lead through a Vladimir Coufal own goal and two goals from Erling Haaland put City in total command.Phil Foden made it 4-0 before Niclas Fullkrug grabbed a consolation for Julen Lopetegui's men, who suffered a 5-0 mauling by Liverpool last week.Despite their shocking run, sixth-placed City are just two points behind Chelsea, in fourth, but Guardiola said his team were still not back in the groove.""I'm very pleased for the result but you cannot ask me if the old City is back,"" he said. ""If you saw the game, we are not.""You saw many times during the years what we have done with the opponents.""In the early kick-off, Newcastle came from behind to clinch a fifth straight Premier League win and heap more misery on injury-hit Spurs.The home side went ahead in the fourth minute through Dominic Solanke.Newcastle levelled two minutes later when Anthony Gordon arrowed an effort into the bottom corner, but Postecoglou stood in disbelief on the touchline looking at referee Andrew Madley after Joelinton intercepted Lucas Bergvall's pass with his hand in the build-up.VAR deemed Joelinton's arm to be in a natural position and the contact to be accidental.In-form Alexander Isak scored what turned out to be the winner towards the end of the first period.The 2-1 victory, watched by new England manager Thomas Tuchel, leaves Newcastle in fifth spot, which may yet prove enough to secure a place in the Champions League next season.But Spurs have slumped to 12th in the table after five defeats in seven matches.Postecoglou said he was proud of his players but was the ""angriest I think I have ever been in my career"".""I think it's clear,"" said the Australian. ""Now whether people agree with me or not whether it wasn't handball or it was accidental, I'm just not interested in any of that discussion.""I know what everyone wants me to say, but all I'll say is that on any other day, on a fair and even playing ground, we would have won that game. Simple as that.""Enzo Maresca's Chelsea were breathing down Liverpool's necks just two weeks ago but have taken just two points from four games over the festive period.The prolific Cole Palmer gave the visitors a first-half lead, but they could not capitalise on their possession and Jean-Philippe Mateta levelled in the 82nd minute.Aston Villa beat relegation-threatened Leicester 2-1 at home, with goals from Ross Barkley and Leon Bailey.Brentford recorded their first league win on the road this season, smashing hapless Southampton 5-0, and Bournemouth beat Everton 1-0.",Arsenal blow chance to make up significant ground on Premier League leaders Liverpool.
