RCB vs GT IPL 2025, Bengaluru weather prediction

Royal Challengers Bengaluru ( RCB ) will open their home account at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium tonight (April 2) against Gujarat Titans ( GT ).Though the Women’s Premier League (WPL) wrapped up three weeks ago, the ongoing heat and dryness have left the pitches looking browner than usual.RCB, coming off two consecutive wins to start the season, won’t mind this. Such a start has only occurred for the team twice before, in 2014 and 2021.In previous seasons, this notion of no home advantage could have affected RCB. However, this time may be different. Last year, they made a remarkable run to the playoffs, winning three out of their last six games at home consecutively.Also See: RCB vs GT, IPL Live Score 2025 Against the raucous crowd support for RCB, GT will need to explore various combinations. Should Jos Buttler open alongside Shubman Gill to enhance their powerplay?With David Miller not retained and Rahul Tewatia not in his prime hitting form, they risk over-relying on their top order. However, their bowling attack has the potential to deliver. Prasidh Krishna returns home, having played for Karnataka, and Mohammed Siraj returns to a venue that was his IPL home for seven years.Teams haven't dealt with much dew in the last two days. Regarding the pitch, Mo Bobat, RCB's director, anticipates a “typical Bengaluru pitch” that should produce plenty of runs.Notably, the 200-run mark wasn't surpassed in any of the seven knockout matches of the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20s held here in December. The same trend was observed in the seven WPL games, where spinners managed to take advantage of the surface.Royal Challengers Bengaluru probable XI: Virat Kohli, Phil Salt, Devdutt Padikkal, Rajat Patidar (c), Liam Livingstone, Jitesh Sharma (wk), Tim David, Krunal Pandya, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Josh Hazlewood, Yash Dayal.Impact Player: Suyash SharmaGujarat Titans probably XI: Shubman Gill (c), Jos Buttler (wk), Sai Sudharsan, Shahrukh Khan, Sherfane Rutherford, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Kagiso Rabada, R Sai Kishore, Mohammad Siraj, Prasidh Krishna.Impact Player: Ishant SharmaRoyal Challengers Bengaluru squad: Philip Salt, Virat Kohli, Devdutt Padikkal, Rajat Patidar(c), Liam Livingstone, Jitesh Sharma(w), Tim David, Krunal Pandya, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Josh Hazlewood, Yash Dayal, Suyash Sharma, Rasikh Dar Salam, Manoj Bhandage, Jacob Bethell, Swapnil Singh, Abhinandan Singh, Romario Shepherd, Lungi Ngidi, Nuwan Thushara, Mohit Rathee, Swastik Chikara.Gujarat Titans squad: Sai Sudharsan, Shubman Gill(c), Jos Buttler(w), Shahrukh Khan, Sherfane Rutherford, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Kagiso Rabada, Ravisrinivasan Sai Kishore, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Ishant Sharma, Washington Sundar, Glenn Phillips, Anuj Rawat, Mahipal Lomror, Arshad Khan, Jayant Yadav, Nishant Sindhu, Kulwant Khejroliya, Gerald Coetzee, Manav Suthar, Kumar Kushagra, Gurnoor Brar, Karim Janat.Matches played: 5Royal Challengers Bengaluru won: 3Gujarat Titans won: 2Last match: Royal Challengers Bengaluru won by 9 wickets (2024)RCB have three wins out of five against GT but their record at home isn't the best.

Bret Hart , one of the most celebrated WWE heavyweight wrestlers of all time, is often regarded as an idol for wrestlers who reign in the ring currently. The WWE legend has recently grabbed eyeballs after he took a jibe at Hulk Hogan 's wrestling legacy and his impact on modern-day wrestlers.It is true that many wrestlers in the world today in the world of professional wrestling consider Hart as one of the major influences on their career. But, Hart believes that Hulk Hogan does not have much to contribute to today's generation.Hulk Hogan has been in the news recently after his wife, Linda Hogan, opened up about their broken marriage and how they had to separate due to infidelity, abuse, and family rift. The former WWE star has garnered everyone’s attention again after Hart drew a comparison between them.There was a time when Bret Hart and Hulk Hogan stood across each other inside the ring, challenging themselves to a bout. However, it seems that tensions are still flaring between the two veterans related to their in-ring legacy and ego. Let's take a look at Bert Hart's full statement and his take on Hulk Hogan's legacy.After Bret Hart commented on Hulk Hogan ’s wrestling legacy and that it has no impact on today’s generation, tension flared up between the two WWE icons. Hart spoke about it while responding to CM Punk ’s comments, who happens to be a massive fan of the star, on,” which aired on Tuesday, April 2, 2025.In the show, Punk explained why Hart is wrestling's equivalent to Wayne Gretzky’s contribution in hockey or what Michael Jordan was to basketball, which ignited a comparison from Hart between himself and Hogan.This statement led Bret Hart to comment on Hulk Hogan’s legacy and take a jibe at him. Bret stated, “I heard something a few months ago where Hulk Hogan was talking about me, and he said, the problem with Bret Hart is that he does think he was the greatest wrestler of all time.”He further added, ""I remember thinking about that, and going, hmm. Yeah, maybe. That might be the most truthful thing he's ever said.”Bret Hart next went on to say, “Then I think when you watch a lot of the wrestlers today, you don't see anybody imitating Hulk Hogan or Ultimate Warrior. You see a lot of wrestlers today really trying their best to capture my style, or some of the guys that I worked with, like-Dynamite Kid, or Curt Hennig, my brother Owen, and stuff like them. Yeah, they're wrestling my style, and that's the biggest compliment I can get from today's generation.”Bret Hart, in the interview, asserted that the young generation of wrestlers is following his style today, including talents like Dynamite Kid, Curt Hennig, and Owen Hart. He believes that not everybody is imitating Hulk Hogan's style nowadays.This is not the first time Hart has engaged in a professional feud with Hulk Hogan. The long-standing issue between Hart and Hogan date back to 1993's WWE WrestleMania 9. However, the two did manage to work together during Hart’s largely forgettable run in WCW in the late 1990s.Bret Hart was last seen on WWE RAW on September 9, 2024, in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, where he returned to the ring and addressed the fans about the importance of the location and his pride in being a Canadian champion.","Bret Hart is one of the most celebrated WWE heavyweight wrestlers of all time.

NEW DELHI: Rohit Sharma shared insights on how his role has evolved over the years within the Mumbai Indians setup, from adapting to new responsibilities to leading the team to multiple titles. He acknowledged that while a lot has changed since he started, his passion and desire to win games and trophies for the franchise remain the same.Rohit has endured his worst IPL start since 2020.

Jalen Brunson’s New York Knicks comeback could be just days away



Jalen Brunson focused on long-term health



New York Knicks finding ways to win without Jalen Brunson



The New York Knicks have been navigating a crucial stretch without their star point guard, Jalen Brunson, who has been sidelined with a right ankle sprain since March 6. Despite missing 13 consecutive games, the team has stayed competitive, posting an 8-5 record in his absence. However, with the postseason rapidly approaching, the focus has shifted to when Brunson will be back on the floor to lead the Knicks in their playoff push . Jalen Brunson ’s return seems to be right around the corner, according to New York Knicks insider Ian Begley. After the team’s 105-91 win over the Philadelphia 76ers on Tuesday, Begley said a Thursday game in Cleveland is probably too soon, but the weekend? That’s looking much more likely.“Jalen Brunson, still working his way back, I think it’s a long shot for him to play at Cleveland the next game. But they have a couple of days off, then they go to Atlanta on Saturday. They’re home against Phoenix on Sunday,” Begley reported. “I think based on the trajectory and everything that’s gone on here, the weekend is a realistic landing spot for Brunson and his return,” Begly said, ""that Atlanta game, that Phoenix game. I think if everything continues to pace with his rehab, that’s the place where you’re looking for Brunson to be back on the court.""The Knicks have two big games this weekend—Saturday in Atlanta and Sunday at home against Phoenix—and that’s when Brunson could finally make his return. With playoff positioning still up for grabs, getting him back now would be huge for New York.Brunson isn’t rushing back just to get on the court—his focus is on being fully ready for the playoffs. Speaking before the Knicks faced the Trail Blazers, he made it clear that health comes first, especially with the intensity of the postseason ahead.“Realistically, I'm hoping to play before the playoffs,” Brunson said. ""It's good for me to get some game reps before we go into that type of stretch run, but the most important thing is trying to be 100 percent healthy.""Brunson is back to basketball activities—sprinting, cutting, and testing his ankle—but he’s not rushing. He’s working with the Knicks’ medical staff to make sure he returns at the right moment.“We’re going to communicate,” Brunson explained. “I never want to put [the medical team] in a position where I’m making the decisions because it’s honestly a team thing. But when I know it's something minor and I know I can play through it, I can play through it.”He added, “I just want to make sure we're on the same page. We’ve been on the same page for the past couple of weeks, and so we're going to continue to progress that way.”The Knicks have managed without Brunson, thanks in part to Landry Shamet . He hit six threes in the win over the Sixers and is averaging 10.3 points on 45% shooting from deep over the last four games.Mitchell Robinson looked strong in his first start of the season Tuesday, posting 14 points, 14 rebounds, and two blocks. After nearly 10 months recovering from ankle surgery, his return is a big lift for the Knicks' defense.Coach Tom Thibodeau credited the team for stepping up, emphasizing that replacing Brunson isn’t a one-man job.“We’ve said this all along – you’re not going to replace Jalen individually,” Thibodeau said. “You have to do it collectively, and I think we’ve done that.”Brunson, while grateful for his teammates’ efforts, is eager to be back.“There have been nights where obviously we didn’t perform well as a team, but then the next day they respond. That’s all we can focus on,” he said. “It sucks. It’s not fun. I really wish I was out there.”Also Read: “Our business is a piece of sh*t”: Michael Wilbon criticizes ESPN and Stephen A.

If everything stays on track, he’ll be back just in time to guide them into the postseason.","Jalen Brunson has been sidelined with a right ankle sprain since March 6.

England's Jos Buttler delivered a match-winning performance with an unbeaten 73 off 39 balls, guiding Gujarat Titans (GT) to a commanding 8-wicket victory over Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) in their IPL 2025 clash on Wednesday.Chasing 170, Gujarat Titans relied on a 75-run second-wicket stand between Buttler and Sai Sudharsan (49 off 36) to overhaul the target with 13 balls to spare at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium.RCB, batting first after Gujarat opted to bowl, struggled against Mohammed Siraj’s impressive spell of 3/19 in four overs. Despite Liam Livingstone’s 54 off 40 balls, RCB could only muster 169/8 in 20 overs.The hosts suffered an early setback when Virat Kohli (7) fell cheaply, caught at deep square leg off Arshad Khan. Siraj then dismantled the top order, dismissing Devdutt Padikkal (4) and Phil Salt (14) in quick succession.With RCB at 42/4, Livingstone and Jitesh Sharma (33 off 21) stitched together a crucial 52-run stand. However, Sai Kishore (2/22) dismissed Jitesh and later sent back Krunal Pandya (5), keeping RCB under pressure.Livingstone fought back, smashing five sixes -- all off Rashid Khan -- but his luck eventually ran out as Siraj dismissed him. Tim David’s quickfire 32 off 18 balls added some late runs, but RCB’s total still seemed below par.Chasing 170, GT started cautiously as Bhuvneshwar Kumar removed skipper Shubman Gill (14) in the fifth over. However, Sudharsan and Buttler stabilized the innings with regular boundaries, shifting the momentum in Gujarat’s favor.Though Josh Hazlewood (1/31) dismissed Sudharsan before he could reach his fifty, Buttler remained composed. Paired with *Sherfane Rutherford (30 off 18)**, he ensured a smooth finish, stitching an unbeaten 63-run stand.Buttler’s five fours and six sixes, including a stunning reverse ramp over the wicketkeeper, kept GT ahead. Rutherford sealed the victory with a six, completing a dominant performance in Gujarat’s third match of the season.",Gujarat Titans beat Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) by eight wickets. England's Jos Buttler scored 73 off 39 balls to guide GT to victory.

Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) has undergone a major transformation for the IPL 2025, with a revamped squad following the auction at the Abadi Al Johar Arena in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The franchise, still looking for its elusive maiden title, is banking on a combination of fresh faces, experienced talent, and new leadership to break their trophy drought this season.Under the leadership of Rajat Patidar, who has been appointed as the new captain, RCB is determined to rewrite their history and clinch the title that has slipped through their fingers multiple times. The season kicks off with back-to-back wins against Kolkata Knight Riders and Chennai Super Kings. The buzz around their revamped squad has added to the anticipation.RCB's management made some bold moves at the auction to strengthen both their batting and bowling units. The team retained their core players, with Virat Kohli, Rajat Patidar, and Yash Dayal staying put. This strategic decision allowed them to spend significantly and bolster their ranks. With the second-largest purse among the ten IPL franchises, RCB was well-positioned to make big-ticket signings.Notably, RCB splurged on several high-profile players, bringing in the versatile all-rounder Liam Livingstone for ₹8.75 crore, wicketkeeper-batter Phil Salt for ₹11.50 crore, and Indian wicketkeeper Jitesh Sharma for ₹11 crore. These signings have strengthened their batting depth considerably, offering flexibility in both attack and defence.In the bowling department, RCB made strategic acquisitions to add experience and firepower. Australian pacer Josh Hazelwood returned to RCB for ₹12.50 crore, bringing valuable leadership to the pace attack. Alongside him, Bhuvneshwar Kumar was signed for ₹10.75 crore, adding another layer of skill and experience. To complement their fast bowling attack, RCB also secured young Indian spinner Suyash Sharma for ₹2.60 crore, rounding out their bowling resources with depth and variety.Andy Flower, RCB's director of cricket, expressed satisfaction with the squad's construction, emphasising the importance of balance in both the batting and bowling departments. ""It was really great to get Bhuvi today. That level of skill, along with Krunal’s capabilities, will complement Hazelwood's return to RCB. His experience will be invaluable. Yash Dayal showed his potential last year, and we also have Rasikh, who is competing for a spot,"" Flower remarked. ""We’re thrilled with the skill we’ve secured, especially with the level of expertise we’ve added to the squad. We’re feeling very positive about where we stand at the moment.""RCB will be hoping that the infusion of fresh talent, a new captain, and an all-around stronger squad will propel them to their first-ever IPL title in 2025.With an exciting squad at their disposal, RCB is ready to embark on what promises to be an electrifying IPL 2025 season. The stage is set, and all eyes will be on the team as they chase their dream of lifting the coveted IPL trophy.","Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) has undergone a major transformation for the IPL 2025, with a revamped squad following the auction at the Abadi Al Johar Arena in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan’s leg-spinner Abrar Ahmed has found himself in the spotlight once again -- this time not for his bowling but for a light-hearted confrontation with a fan following a controversial send-off to India’s Shubman Gill during the ICC Champions Trophy 2025.In a viral video circulating on social media, a passionate fan confronted Abrar during Pakistan’s series against New Zealand, questioning his antics against Gill.Watch:The incident occurred when Pakistan was facing New Zealand in the second ODI at Seddon Park.Also See: IPL Live Score, RCB vs GT A female fan confronted Abrar Ahmed -- who was not in the playing XI -- on the sidelines of the match, questioning his controversial send-off to Shubman Gill. ""What were you signaling to Shubman Gill?"" she demanded.Though the words weren’t clearly audible in the clip, Abrar’s awkward reaction and nervous smile indicated he was caught off guard.This confrontation stemmed from an intense moment in the India vs Pakistan clash in the Champions Trophy group stage.During that match, Abrar produced a stunning leg-break to castle a well-set Shubman Gill for 46. However, it was his animated send-off, gesturing Gill to walk off that sparked controversy among Indian fans.Virat Kohli, at the non-striker’s end, was visibly surprised by the dismissal and the send-off.While Abrar celebrated, social media erupted, with memes and jokes mocking the Pakistani spinner for his over-the-top reaction.Many fans felt his behavior was unnecessary, especially since India comfortably chased down Pakistan’s 241-run total, thanks to Kohli’s brilliant unbeaten century (100 not out off 111 balls).Meanwhile, Pakistan’s form in ODIs hasn’t been promising. Against New Zealand, they suffered an 84-run defeat, handing the Kiwis an unassailable 2-0 series lead.Pakistan’s top order collapsed, with Babar Azam (1), Abdullah Shafique (1), and Imam-ul-Haq (3) falling inside six overs.A valiant half-century from Naseem Shah and a fighting knock from Faheem Ashraf weren’t enough to save them from yet another defeat.","Pakistan leg-spinner Abrar Ahmed in spotlight for light-hearted confrontation with fan.

IPL | Punjab Kings' Suryansh Shedge: From playing under Shreyas to dreaming of meeting Kohli

Nehal Wadhera made an unexpected, but impactful, debut for Punjab Kings , scoring an unbeaten 43 off 25 balls to help secure an eight-wicket victory over Lucknow Super Giants in an Indian Premier League match in Lucknow on Tuesday (April 1). The left-handed batter's performance, which included three boundaries and four sixes, was particularly noteworthy as he was informed about his selection just moments before the game.""I didn't know I would be playing. I only brought one kit because I was sure I wouldn't be in the XI. Normally, I carry two--one for batting and another for fielding. I even came in full sleeves,"" Wadhera revealed in the post-match press conference.""Sometimes, things work in your favour. If I had known earlier, I might have overthought it...this was one of those days when I was lucky that I did not know that I would be playing, and it turned out to be lucky for me,"" he added.""Ricky (Ponting) came up to me and said, 'If we bowl first, you'll be in the eleven.' I was a bit surprised and kept thinking, 'How can I be in the XI just because we're bowling first?' I thought maybe he made a mistake,"" Wadhera recalled.""Once the playing XI was announced, I realized I was in. That's why I only started warming up around the 11th or 12th over, knowing I might have to field,"" he noted.Lucknow Super Giants, batting first, struggled early at 35/3 but managed to post a competitive total thanks to Nicholas Pooran's 44 off 30 balls and Ayush Badoni's 41 off 33 balls. Abdul Samad contributed with a quick 27 off 12 balls.Arshdeep Singh was the standout bowler for Punjab Kings, taking three wickets for 43 runs. Marco Jansen, Lockie Ferguson, Glenn Maxwell, and Yuzvendra Chahal also picked up wickets.In the chase, Punjab Kings lost Priyansh Arya early for 8 runs. However, Prabhsimran Singh's explosive 69 off 34 balls, along with captain Shreyas Iyer 's unbeaten 52 off 30 balls and Wadhera's 43 not out, guided the team to victory with 22 balls remaining.Digvesh Rathi's bowling effort of 2/30 in four overs for Lucknow Super Giants proved insufficient to defend their total.The victory propelled Punjab Kings to the second position in the points table with two wins in two matches, while Lucknow Super Giants dropped to sixth place with one win and two losses.","Nehal Wadhera made an unexpected, but impactful, debut for Punjab Kings.

Mumbai: In a massive development, India's Test opener Yashasvi Jaiswal has decided to quit Mumbai and move to Goa. The 23-year-old will captain Goa in the 2025-26 season.On Wednesday, Jaiswal wrote an email to the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) seeking a No Objection Certificate (NOC) to change his cricket state team from Mumbai to Goa from the next season onwards. The MCA subsequently granted him the NOC.“He wrote an e-mail to us, seeking an NOC from the MCA to represent Goa next season. We’ve accepted his request,” Abhay Hadap MCA secretary told TOI.In his email to the MCA seeking transfer to Goa from Mumbai, Jaiswal communicated, ""I have had the privilege of representing Mumbai in domestic cricket and have immensely benefited from the opportunities provided by the association. However, after careful consideration of my career aspirations and personal circumstances, I have decided to seek a transfer to Goa to continue my domestic cricket journey. I assure you that this decision is made in good faith and with due respect to the association that has supported my development. I am willing to comply with all necessary formalities as per the BCCI’s player transfer regulations and will ensure a smooth transition.""""Thank you for your support and guidance throughout my time with Mumbai. I sincerely appreciate all the opportunities given to me and hope to maintain a positive relationship with the association in the future.""Also See: IPL Live Score, RCB vs GT Meanwhile, BCCI joint secretary Rohan Desai, who was the secretary of the Goa Cricket Association till recently, told TOI, “It’s a great development for Goan cricket. Goa’s cricketers, especially the youngsters, will get to learn a lot from Jaiswal , who is a part of India’s Test team. It’s a blessing in disguise that a player of his stature will be a part of Goa’s dressing room. It’s a good decision by the GCA management, especially Shambha Desai, the secretary of the GCA to include Yashasvi in the squad. I’m looking forward to an exciting season for Goa.”Jaiswal made his first-class debut for Mumbai at the Wankhede Stadium in January 2019 against Chhattisgarh in a Ranji Trophy match, and has scored a majority of his 3712 first-class runs, including 12 hundreds and 12 fifties, in 36 matches for Mumbai. It was his sizzling performances for Mumbai that brought the dashing left-hander into the national reckoning.In October 2019, Jaiswal became the youngest man to hit a one-day double century, when, at the age of just 17, he smashed 203 off 154 balls against Jharkhand in the Vijay Hazare Trophy. In June 2022, the left-hander stroked twin hundreds (100 & 181) against Uttar Pradesh in the Ranji Trophy, and didn’t look back.In recent years, Mumbai players like Arjun Tendulkar, Siddhesh Lad, Kshemal Waingankar and Eknath Kerkar have played for Goa.After the BCCI’s directive to the players to turn out for their state teams in domestic cricket, Jaiswal played in a Ranji Trophy match for Mumbai in the Ranji Trophy in the 2024-25 season, scoring 4 & 26 in the five-wicket defeat to Jammu & Kashmir at the MCA ground in BKC in Mumbai in Jan this year. Left out of India’s Champions Trophy squad but included in the list of non-travelling substitutes, the left-hander was drafted into the Mumbai Ranji squad ahead of their semifinal clash with Vidarbha in Nagpur on February 17. However, he had to pull out of the match just a day before the game due to pain in his ankle.Even though he belongs to the Bhadohi village in Uttar Pradesh, Jaiswal has a deep emotional connection with Mumbai, where he has played all his cricket till now in life. As a kid, he used to sleep in the Muslim United SC tent at the Azad Maidan and sometimes sell panipuris in the evening to make a living, before his childhood coach/mentor Jwala Singh took him to his home in Santa Cruz. In 2015, former India skipper Dilip Vengsarkar took Jaiswal to the UK for an exposure tour with his academy team. Jaiswal first attracted attention by making huge scores for the Rizvi Springfield School in the Harris Shield (inter-school competition for Under-16), and then did well for the Mumbai Under-16, Under-19 and Under-23 teams, before being picked for the Mumbai senior team.Jaiswal has currently been struggling for form while playing for the Rajasthan Royals in IPL-2025, where he has managed to score only 34 runs in three matches@11.33, with a strike rate of 106.25. The youngster was one of the standout performers for India in the 2024-25 Border-Gavaskar Trophy, where he scored 391 runs in five Tests@43.44, with one century and two half-centuries.",India's Test opener Yashasvi Jaiswal has decided to quit Mumbai and move to Goa.

He has also represented Mumbai in 28 T20s, scoring 648 runs at a strike-rate of 136.42.Several Mumbai players, including Arjun Tendulkar, Siddhesh Lad, Eknath Kerkar and Kshemal Waingankar have previously represented Goa. Other prominent Mumbai players who left the association to play for other sides include Sarfaraz Khan (played for UP before coming back), Munaf Patel (to Maharashtra), Sairaj Bahutule (to Maharashtra), Amol Muzumdar (to Assam) and Wasim Jaffer (to Vidarbha).Following BCCI’s directive for players to participate in domestic cricket, Jaiswal played for Mumbai in the 2024- 25 Ranji Trophy, scoring 4 & 26 in their loss to Jammu & Kashmir in January. Though selected as a non-travelling substitute in the team for the Champions Trophy, he was included in Mumbai’s Ranji squad for their semifinal against Vidarbha in Nagpur on Feb 17. However, an ankle injury prevented his participation.Despite his origins in Bhadohi, Uttar Pradesh, Jaiswal shares a strong connection with Mumbai. During his early days, he resided in the Muslim United SC tent at Azad Maidan before coach Jwala Singh provided him with an accommodation.Currently, Jaiswal is going through a lean run in IPL 2025 with Rajasthan Royals, managing only 34 runs in three matches so far. However, he performed admirably in the 2024-25 Border Gavaskar Trophy in Australia, logging 391 runs in five Tests at an average of 43.44, including one century and two half-centuries.",India's Test opener Yashasvi Jaiswal has left the cricket fraternity stunned with his decision to switch from Mumbai to Goa.

Christian Horner’s texting scandal left Red Bull in disarray, McLaren took full advantage, says Zak Brown



""No Love Lost"": Why Zak Brown Stands Against Christian Horner

Red Bull President Christian Horner Accused of Misconduct via Leaked Texts: Will Formula 1 Respond?

Formula 1 thrives on speed, strategy, and, at times, political warfare. The 2024 season started with an explosive controversy surrounding Red Bull’s team principal, Christian Horner . Just a day after he had been cleared of allegations of inappropriate behavior, an anonymous email surfaced, throwing the scandal back into the spotlight. The timing, coming right before the season’s first race in Bahrain, sent shockwaves through the paddock, raising questions about Horner’s future and Red Bull’s stability.The email, sent to over 100 senior figures in F1, contained a link to a Google Drive with alleged evidence related to the investigation. Though Red Bull’s internal probe had exonerated Horner, doubts lingered, and rivals saw an opportunity to capitalize on the disruption. One of the most vocal critics was McLaren’s CEO, Zak Brown, who not only questioned Red Bull’s handling of the issue but also acknowledged the competitive advantage his team gained from the turmoil.For Brown, the controversy surrounding Horner wasn’t just a scandal; it was an opening. McLaren, looking to reclaim its former glory, saw Red Bull’s internal unrest as a chance to destabilize their fiercest competitor. “Our sport, perhaps more than others, has a highly competitive and political aspect,” Brown told the TechStuff podcast. He candidly admitted that McLaren “absolutely” received “an unexpected advantage” from Red Bull’s distractions.Brown further explained the intricate dynamics of F1, where off-track strategies play as much of a role as the performance on the circuit. “The goal is to make ourselves as fast as possible, but there’s also a strategy of destabilizing the competition,” he said. “If you can generate some instability in rival teams – and it doesn’t always work in our favor – it can slow them down while we focus on speeding up.”While McLaren worked behind the scenes to strengthen its own campaign, Red Bull remained entangled in controversy. The continued speculation and scrutiny over Horner’s leadership placed the Milton Keynes-based outfit on the back foot. Brown, who had previously emphasized the importance of transparency in the investigation, remained vocal about Red Bull’s handling of the situation.“They need to handle it swiftly because I don't believe these are the type of headlines that Formula 1 wants or needs at this time,” Brown had remarked when the allegations first emerged. His comments reflected a broader sentiment within the F1 community that Red Bull’s lack of public clarity on the matter had only fueled further uncertainty.Despite Horner being cleared of any wrongdoing by an independent lawyer, skepticism persisted. Brown and other team bosses continued to question whether Red Bull had provided full transparency regarding the investigation. “I've read this statement. I think, from what I've seen, there continues to be a lot of rumors, speculation, and questions,” Brown stated, urging F1’s governing body to ensure accountability.Ultimately, McLaren emerged as the biggest beneficiary of Red Bull’s struggles. With a focused and stable team, they capitalized on their rivals’ distractions, securing their first Constructors’ Championship since 1998. Meanwhile, Red Bull, which had dominated the previous seasons, slipped to third place.Also Read: Could Sergio Perez be back in F1?

In the high-stakes world of motorsport, success isn’t just about who has the fastest car—it’s also about who can navigate the political and psychological battles off the track. McLaren, under Brown’s leadership, mastered that art in 2024, turning Red Bull’s misfortune into a historic victory.","Christian Horner’s texting scandal left Red Bull in disarray, says Zak Brown.

“Still work to be done”: Rangers’ Jack Leiter's solid start cut short due to blister,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/still-work-to-be-done-rangers-jack-leiters-solid-start-cut-short-due-to-blister/articleshow/119927057.cms,"Rangers’ Jack Leiter's solid start cut short due to blister (Image Source: Leiter/Instagram)

Rangers’ Jack Leiter talks about facing Gavin Lux

“That part of the game is not really a time to get fired up, because there's still work to be done, it was only like the fourth inning, but, yeah, there was a man on third, Elly always causes problems and Lux was putting together a tough at-bat. Those long at-bats, when they finish in a punchout, it's always nice.”

“It’s pitchability, That’s what you’re seeing. He’s not trying to bull his way through lineups. He's throwing strikes. He is not putting guys on base. He's pounding the strike zone, not beating himself. It's a very, very competitive game. When you start putting guys on, you start beating yourself a little bit. He's not doing that.”

Jack Leiter’s stunning game shall be remembered

“He just looks like he's confident on the mound, he looks like he trusts all his stuff. He's throwing his heater where he wants to. He's getting ahead of guys. That’s the biggest difference. He's hitting corners, he's making nasty pitches, and I think he just trusts all his stuff.”

It was a tough fight between the Texas Rangers and Cincinnati Reds , when pitcher Jack Leiter had to face Gavin Lux .

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Taylor Makar’s journey: From NCAA standout to professional hockey



Fans react: Is Taylor Makar’s signing a case of NHL nepotism?

The Colorado Avalanche made headlines on Monday by signing Taylor Makar, the younger brother of star defenseman Cale Makar, to a one-year entry-level contract. While Taylor will begin his professional career in the AHL with the Colorado Eagles, the move has sparked debate among hockey fans, with many questioning whether his signing was driven by talent or family ties.Taylor Makar, 24, was a seventh-round pick in the 2021 NHL Draft. He recently wrapped up his senior season at the University of Maine, where he posted an impressive 30 points (18 goals, 12 assists) in 38 games. His college career ended with a 5–1 loss to Penn State in the NCAA tournament, eliminating Maine from the Frozen Four. Despite this setback, the Avalanche saw potential in him, offering him a chance to prove himself at the professional level.Meanwhile, his older brother, Cale Makar, remains one of the NHL’s elite defensemen, leading all blueliners with 85 points in 75 games this season. His presence in Colorado makes the signing even more scrutinized.As soon as the Avalanche announced the signing on social media, fans were quick to question whether Taylor Makar’s family connection played a role in his contract. Many users on X (formerly Twitter) posted sarcastic or skeptical comments.“Any relation?” asked @PooseUnpooses, while @gohabsgo69010 echoed, “Is that Cale’s brother?” These responses were soon followed by more direct accusations. “Nepotism at its finest!” wrote @fksambennett. Another fan, @Matapumo, simply stated, “Nepotism is craaaaazy.”Some even speculated that Cale Makar had a direct hand in his brother’s signing. “Nice of Cale to make this happen…” wrote @srasuchak, while @nzamora86 noted, “Should be helpful having his brother so close to him.”While skepticism is natural, Taylor Makar’s stats show he has potential. Although he was not a high draft pick, his college performance demonstrated strong offensive skills. Whether he can transition successfully to professional hockey remains to be seen.Also Read: Who Is Taylor Makar?

Bravo plays down pitch issue Kolkata

NEW DELHI: The absence of any discernible ‘home advantage’ has become a talking point in the early stages of the Indian Premier League IPL ) season. Barely two weeks in, there is growing discontent among franchises over local curators not preparing pitches according to the host team’s strengths.On Tuesday evening, Lucknow Super Giants mentor Zaheer Khan caustically remarked that the pitch at the Ekana Stadium looked as if it had been prepared by a “curator from Punjab”. The pitch offered decent seam movement that made it tough for the LSG top order to get going up. The surface was also not suited to the team’s bowling strengths.“What was a little disappointing for me here, considering it’s a home game, and you know, in IPL you’ve seen how teams have looked at taking a little bit of home advantage, you know,” Zaheer said after his team lost in a one-sided contest against Punjab Kings.“From that point of view, you’ve seen the curator is not really thinking that it’s a home game. I think maybe it looked like, you know, it was (the) Punjab curator out here,” he added.There have also been reports of Kolkata Knight Riders demanding a pitch with more assistance for spinners at the Eden Gardens. TOI understands that the Delhi Capitals management too was not happy with the BCCI curator overseeing preparation in their first two home matches in Vizag.The issue has set BCCI and IPL franchises on a collision course.The Delhi Capitals management was clearly informed by BCCI that the authority to make pitches lay with the designated board curator. BCCI guidelines clearly state that franchises and players must not have any say in the preparation of pitches. BCCI’s clear instruction to curators for the IPL is to prepare pitches that don’t offer excessive seam or spin.Having said that, franchises have often worked in tandem with state associations to create a team best suited to local conditions. In 2019, the pitch in Chennai aided excessive turn, which resulted in BCCI deploying neutral curators at venues. The board may now consider deploying neutral curators if teams demand altering the nature of ‘home’ pitches.“The pitches have been good so far. Hence, they may be asking for pitches that have more help for bowlers. But there needs to be better communication between the franchise and the curators. It can’t happen within a week of the IPL season,” a BCCI source said.Sourav Ganguly, who was director of the Delhi Capitals last year, had made regular visits in the preceding year to understand the nature of pitches and work with DDCA. It resulted in the Kotla pitch producing high scores during the 2023 World Cup and IPL 2024.“As far as Lucknow is considered, the square needs to be relaid to alter the basic nature of the pitch, which is intrinsically slow in nature. According to BCCI guidelines, it needs to have a good grass cover to sustain itself through the tournament. Same goes for all other venues,” the source said.Zaheer, meanwhile, said the team will try to “figure out” the pitch in upcoming games.“That (pitch) is something we’ll figure out. It’s a new set-up for me, but I hope that this is the first and the last game when it comes to that (disappointment with the surface),” Khan said, adding: “That’s the nature of IPL, isn’t it? You will be on the go, you’ll be playing home games, away games. It was the first home game for us for this season, so yes, there were a lot of expectations and hopes. Punjab did outplay us.”LSG’s frontline pacers like Akash Deep and Mayank Yadav are grappling with injuries. Zaheer pointed out that the team only had a set of young players like Digvesh Rathi, Prince Yadav and Shahbaz Ahmed to fall back on.The Ajinkya Rahane-led side has been clamouring for more assistance from the surface and this is a match they would desperately want to win.The wicket here came under the limelight in controversial fashion after the home side suffered a defeat in the opening game, with the curator even having to publicly defend his methods of preparation. However, team mentor Dwayne Bravo downplayed the pitch issue.“I don’t know much about pitches,” he said. “For me, it’s always the team which plays best on the day, wins.

Poor bowling in Powerplay too

KOLKATA: In a repeat of last year’s Indian Premier League (IPL) title clash, the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) will lock horns with Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) at the Eden Gardens here on Thursday. But it has been a harsh reality check for both sides after the IPL mega auction as they have failed to replicate last year’s success so far.With two losses each in the first three games, KKR and SRH find themselves languishing at the bottom half of the points table. It’s still early days and there’s no immediate need to press the panic button, but both sides will be desperate to get their campaign back on track sooner than later.For that to happen, both teams need to get their opening acts right.Much of KKR and SRH’s success in the last season can be attributed to their openers. The sides feature prominently among IPL’s all-time highest Powerplay scorers. While SRH occupy the top two slots, putting up 125/0 (vs DC in 2024) and 107/0 (vs LSG in 2024), KKR are third with a score of 105/0 vs RCB in 2017.Gautam Gambhir pushing Sunil Narine up the order put the wind in KKR’s sails after they tried out as many as 14 different opening combinations across the 2022-23 seasons. After last year’s auction, though, KKR got a new opening duo, with Quinton de Kock replacing Phil Salt as Narine’s partner.Although Narine got 44 in the first match and De Kock hit 97 in the team’s winning cause against Rajasthan Royals, KKR have failed to put their rivals under scoreboard pressure, with scores of 60/1, 40/0 and 41/4 in three games -- the season’s lowest first-innings Powerplay scores.Last year the KKR’s opening pair was so dominant and the middle-order so consistent that they didn’t have to rely on finishers in most of their matches. No wonder Knights’ rising star Rinku Singh got to play only 113 balls last season when KKR lost only thrice.SRH began from where they left last year getting 94/1 in the Powerplay against Rajasthan Royals in their opening match at home. But since then, they have been left searching for that impactful start getting 62/2 and 58/4 in the next two games.The Orange Army has also lost regular wickets (seven so far), much like KKR, who had lost five wickets in the first six overs, which halted their progress. Although Travis Head looked dangerous at times, youngster Abhishek Sharma is yet to fire.With big-hitters like Ishan Kishan and Henrick Klaasen to follow, a brisk start can set the tone for SRH batters to take the game away from any opposition.To make matters worse, both the sides have failed to make early inroads while bowling too. They have allowed their oppositions to get off the block fast and thus lost control of proceedings.KKR bowlers have conceded 80, 54 and 65 runs while managing just two wickets in the first six overs, SRH bowlers too have proved expensive -- giving away 77, 77 and 52 runs, claiming four wickets.It’s time to get the right start in both the departments now.",Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) and Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) meet in repeat of last year's title clash. Both sides have failed to replicate last year’s success so far.

IPL 2025 | Kagiso Rabada: 'Even a No. 10 can hit a six... there's no mystery anymore'

NEW DELHI: When Jos Buttler gets going, the opposition is left searching for answers. Scoop, reverse scoop, pull, straight drive, cut, flick—every shot in the book was on display as he dismantled Royal Challengers Bengaluru. Gujarat Titans stormed to an eight-wicket victory, riding on Buttler’s batting masterclass.The Englishman dictated the chase with a blistering 73 off just 39 balls at a strike rate of 187.18. His knock, studded with nine boundaries and three sixes, left the RCB bowlers clueless.After the early dismissal of Shubman Gill, Buttler and Sai Sudharsan stitched a crucial 75-run partnership. Sudharsan contributed a steady 49 off 36 balls, ensuring GT stayed on course. Once Sudharsan fell, Buttler pressed the accelerator, taking GT home with 13 balls to spare and stamping his authority on the chase.Earlier, RCB struggled to find rhythm, posting 169/8 in 20 overs. Their innings never really took off, as GT’s bowlers struck at regular intervals. The early dismissals of Virat Kohli (7) and Devdutt Padikkal (4) put them on the back foot. Phil Salt (14) and Rajat Patidar (12) also failed to capitalize, leaving RCB tottering at 42/4 inside six overs. Liam Livingstone offered some resistance, smashing 54 off 40 balls, including five fours and three sixes. Jitesh Sharma (33 off 21) provided a quick cameo, but GT’s bowlers kept the pressure on. Sai Kishore (2/22) and Mohammed Siraj (3/19) were outstanding, never allowing RCB to settle. Tim David’s brisk 32 off 18 lifted RCB to 169, but it was always going to be a tough total to defend.In response, GT started cautiously, with Gill departing for 14. However, Buttler and Sudharsan took control, finding regular boundaries to keep the chase on track. After Sudharsan’s dismissal, Sherfane Rutherford (30* off 18) joined Buttler, and their unbeaten 63-run stand sealed the win in style.With this victory, GT climbed to fourth place in the points table, while RCB slipped to third, facing another setback in their campaign.",Gujarat Titans beat Royal Challengers Bengaluru by eight wickets.

NEW DELHI: A moment of concern gripped fans during the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) vs Gujarat Titans (GT) IPL 2025 clash when star batter Virat Kohli injured his finger while fielding at deep mid-wicket.The incident occurred in the 12th over of Gujarat Titans' chase when Sai Sudharsan swept a delivery from Krunal Pandya with brute force.Kohli attempted to stop the ball, but it skidded awkwardly and struck his right hand before rolling to the boundary.As the ball raced away, Kohli immediately dropped to his knees, clutching his injured finger. The stadium fell into momentary silence as RCB’s medical staff rushed onto the field.After a quick on-field assessment, Kohli was able to continue, but he looked uncomfortable, flexing his fingers frequently.While the extent of the knock remains unclear, fans will be hoping it does not affect his performances in the remainder of the tournament.Earlier, RCB had a tough start to their innings after being put in to bat, with Kohli himself falling early for 7 off 6 balls, courtesy of Arshad Khan.Mohammed Siraj (3/19) spearheaded GT’s attack, dismantling RCB’s top order as the home side slumped to 42/4 in 6.2 overs.However, Liam Livingstone (54 off 40), Jitesh Sharma (33 off 21), and Tim David (32 off 18) mounted a spirited comeback, guiding RCB to a competitive 169/8. Livingstone’s late blitz, including three sixes off Rashid Khan in one over, proved crucial in giving RCB a respectable total.With RCB already dealing with an inconsistent season, Kohli’s injury could be a major setback.His form and fitness remain crucial for the team’s success.

New Zealand's 84-run win over Pakistan in the second ODI in Hamilton on Tuesday gave the hosts an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series, thanks to wicketkeeper-batter Mitchell Hay 's unbeaten 99 and a five-wicket haul by pacer Ben Sears .Hay was unlucky to miss a century by just a solitary run, but his 78-ball blitz helped New Zealand put up a challenging 292 for 8 on the board, after which Sears led the bowling charge with a spell of 5 for 59 that saw Pakistan getting bowled out for 208 in 41.2 overs.New Zealand had won the first ODI by 73 runs.Hay's knock rescued the Kiwis from a mid-innings bother, as the wicketkeeper-batter struck 7 fours and as many sixes, having arrived at the crease when New Zealand were at a precarious 132 for 5 in the 27th over.Pakistan's response faltered early when Will O'Rourke had Abdullah Shafique (1) caught at first slip in the third over, followed by Babar Azam (1) being caught at second slip off Jacob Duffy in the subsequent over.In his next over, Duffy claimed Imam-ul-Haq's (3) wicket. Pakistan were 9 for 3 in the sixth over and Sears made it worse for the visitors, dismissing both Salman Agha (9) and Mohammad Rizwan (5) in his first over to make it 32 for 5 in 12 overs.Tayyab Tahir (13) and Faheem Ashraf collaborated for a 33-run sixth-wicket partnership before Tahir was sent back by Nathan Smith. After Haris Rauf retired hurt on 3, his concussion substitute Naseem Shah joined Ashraf to build a 60-run stand.Both scored their maiden half-centuries, with Ashraf accumulating 73 from 80 balls while Naseem contributed 51 off 44 deliveries.Earlier, under overcast conditions and with a green-tinged pitch favouring bowling, Pakistan captain Rizwan elected to field after winning the toss. But Nick Kelly and Rhys Mariu started confidently despite their lack of experience.Their partnership reached 54 runs before Kelly, playing just his second international match, edged Rauf to be caught behind for 31, including 4 fours and 2 sixes.Making his first appearance, Mariu departed for 18 runs from 25 deliveries, offering a simple catch to Azam at mid-off from Wasim's first over.The bowling pair of Wasim and Rauf restricted the run flow effectively, with Henry Nicholls and Daryl Mitchell requiring until the 16th over to help New Zealand reach 100.When spin was introduced, Mitchell's innings concluded at 18 runs as Rizwan completed a stumping off Sufiyan Muqeem's delivery. Nicholls followed in the subsequent over, departing for 22.Bracewell and Abbas managed a modest 30-run partnership spanning 10 overs before Wasim dismissed Bracewell, who was caught behind after scoring 17.Abbas, who was born in Pakistan, formed a steady partnership of 77 runs with Hay, until he departed after scoring 41.Among the Pakistan bowlers, Muqeem delivered the best performance with figures of 2 for 33, while Wasim finished with 2 for 78.",New Zealand beat Pakistan by 84 runs to take 2-0 lead in three-match series.

IPL 2025 | Kagiso Rabada: 'Even a No. 10 can hit a six... there's no mystery anymore'

NEW DELHI: The Rs 27 crore tag seems to be continuously haunting star wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant . With two defeats in three matches, Lucknow Super Giants are already under fire, and Pant is bearing the brunt. The LSG captain's repeated failures in IPL 2025—both with the bat and in leadership—have become a hot topic.LSG have two points from three games and are sixth in the points table. Pant has scored 0 against Delhi Capitals, 15 against Sunrisers Hyderabad, and 2 against Punjab Kings , and his poor form has put him under immense pressure.Former India spinner Harbhajan Singh has suggested that LSG find a solution as soon as possible to address their Pant conundrum. Harbhajan termed Pant a ""huge shock"" for the LSG side.""Rishabh Pant wasn't able to do much. His bat has been quiet. They will have to do something about him getting out early. He has been a big shock for the team,"" he said on his YouTube channel.Also See: RCB vs GT, IPL 2025 Live Score Barring Nicholas Pooran's 44 and Ayush Badoni 's 41, LSG batters struggled in the match against Punjab Kings.LSG were restricted to 171/7, thanks to Arshdeep Singh's three-wicket burst, and their bowlers failed to stop Punjab Kings batters during the chase. Punjab Kings reached the target with ease in just 16.2 overs.Half-centuries from Shreyas Iyer and Prabhsimran Singh helped Punjab Kings secure their second consecutive victory in the competition.""LSG got stuck. After losing the toss, they didn't score many runs and disappointed themselves. Nicholas Pooran played brilliantly, but he was trapped by Yuzvendra Chahal. So when Pooran got out, LSG's back was pretty much broken. Ayush Badoni and Abdul Samad provided some fireworks towards the end and got them to a total that was worth fighting for, but very tough to defend given just how strong Punjab's batting is,"" added Harbhajan.",Rishabh Pant has scored just two runs in three matches for Lucknow Super Giants.

After a perfect start of 2/2 wins, led from the front by their new captain Shreyas Iyer , there's no doubt now that the Punjab Kings played a masterstroke by acquiring the service of Shreyas at the IPL mega auction last November. The INR 26.75 crore they spent on the batter could well prove to be worth every penny. However, there's still a long way to go, but the team's new coach Ricky Ponting has full faith in Shreyas, who the Australian calls ' Rolls Royce '.Punjab defeated Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) by eight wickets on Monday to build on their 11-run opening win of the season against Gujarat Titans. In both the victories, Shreyas played a key role, scoring 97 not out off 42 balls against Lucknow and a 30-ball 52 not out against Gujarat.After the win on Monday, Ponting praised Shreyas for his consistency, comparing his control and finesse on the crease to the luxury car 'Rolls Royce'.""Skipper (Iyer) did it easy again. Rolls-Royce just stayed in third gear for most of the day. Didn't have to go any harder than that. Just steers the ship home. You haven't got an average yet,"" Ponting said about the Punjab skipper, who is yet to be dismissed.The Australian legend emphasised the importance of sustained dedication from his team members throughout the demanding season that lasts over two months. The final is scheduled for May 25.""Let's not take anything for granted with anything we're doing. Our attitudes have been spot on. We're just starting to scratch the surface. So let's keep working hard together as a family, as one. And we're going to get better every day,"" he added.The Punjab Kings bowlers demonstrated exceptional control from the beginning, which proved instrumental in restricting the hosts. Ponting acknowledged that this disciplined bowling approach was a crucial factor in determining the match's outcome.""Bowling first today, Arshdeep's (Singh) first over goes for three, Lockie (Ferguson) backs it up with an over, goes for four (runs). Two overs in the powerplay 1 for 7. We get through the powerplay, 3 for 35. Four of the overs in power play only went for 13 runs. So in the fifth over, Maxi (Glenn Maxwell) comes on and then on the back of that, Marco (Jansen). So, Marco bowls the sixth over. He absolutely means it. He ended up with the big wicket of David Miller,"" Ponting recalled, praising the team's focus.""The pleasing thing for me about a lot of the things that are happening around the group, it's when guys are coming in and playing their first game or getting their first opportunity; Lockie was the same today,"" Ponting analysed.Punjab's chase was spearheaded by opener Prabhsimran Singh, who deflated the LSG bowlers with a flurry of boundaries and ended up scoring 69 off 34 balls, including 9 fours and 3 sixes. It laid the foundation for Shreyas and Nehal Wadhera (43 not out off 25 balls) to play their natural game and take the team home.""Prabhsimran, I think you have learned a lot about yourself this week as well. I think you've proved to everyone just what a class act you are,"" said Ponting, before switching to praising Wadhera's knock.""We talk about players making an impact, right? You get an opportunity in a T20 game and it's all about making an impact on the game and on the contest when you can. He (Wadhera) only packed one shirt in his bag because he didn't think he was going to be taking much part in the game. He fields the last four overs and then I tap him on the shoulder. When I saw that they'd (LSG) made their impact sub as a left-arm off spinner, I said, 'mate, you're going in'.""","Punjab defeated Lucknow Super Giants by eight wickets on Monday to build on their 11-run opening win of the season against Gujarat Titans. In both the victories, Shreyas played a key role, scoring 97 not out off 42 balls against Lucknow and a 30-ball 52 not out against Gujarat.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119902223,imgsize-40860,width-400,resizemode-4/119902223.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Jasprit Bumrah ’s return to competitive cricket may take a little longer. It is understood that he is yet to bowl full tilt at the BCCI’s Centre of Excellence (CoE). Pacer Akash Deep’s comeback, too, has been pushed back by at least a week.TOI has learnt that Bumrah is clinically fit, but his workload is being increased gradually since he is at risk of suffering a stress fracture of the back. Even Akash Deep is nursing a back injury. Both pacers have not played any competitive cricket since the tour of Australia. While Bumrah suffered a lower back injury during the middle of the Syndey Test in the first week of January, Akash Deep couldn’t make it to the XI after developing some “discomfort”.The BCCI medical team has decided to tread very cautiously with Bumrah, given India are slated to play five Tests in England immediately after the IPL . As it is, the national selectors and the team management are not banking on Bumrah to play all five Tests.Also See: GT vs RCB Live Score, IPL 2025 “Bumrah’s injury is a bit more serious.

Akash Deep too hopes to get back by April 10,” a BCCI source said.Bumrah was initially expected to join Mumbai Indians by April 1.Meanwhile, Lucknow Super Giants pacer Mayank Yadav is also on the same timeline as Akash Deep and Bumrah. According to the refreshed standard operating procedure, the bowling coach at the CoE will have to give the final clearance. While the medical team decides if the player if fit enough to endure the rigours of high-performance sport, the bowling coach must decide if he is ready to go once he leaves the CoE.","Jasprit Bumrah is yet to bowl full tilt at the BCCI’s Centre of Excellence.

You have really got a great team. Just believe in yourself, look forward to tomorrow,"" Goenka told the LSG squad.Watch:Batting first, Lucknow struggled to get going, losing key wickets early in the innings.Despite a brief resistance led by Nicholas Pooran (44) and Ayush Badoni (41),LSG could only post 171/7 in their 20 overs. Punjab’s bowling unit, spearheaded by Arshdeep Singh (3/43), kept the pressure on and prevented LSG from setting a formidable total.Lucknow's woes continued as they lost Mitchell Marsh for a golden duck and captain Rishabh Pant for just two runs.While Aiden Markram’s 28 provided some stability, it was Pooran and Badoni’s 65-run partnership that revived LSG’s innings. Late contributions from David Miller (19) and Abdul Samad (27) pushed the total past 170.Punjab Kings made light work of the chase, with Prabhsimran Singh’s explosive 69 off 34 balls setting the tone.Alongside skipper Shreyas Iyer (52 not out), he dismantled LSG’s bowling attack. Nehal Wadhera (43 not out) added the finishing touches as Punjab cruised to victory with 22 balls to spare.This win lifts Punjab to second place, while LSG drop to sixth. However, with Goenka’s backing and a strong squad, Lucknow will aim to bounce back in their next game against Mumbai Indians on Friday.",Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) lost to Punjab Kings (PBKS) in the 2025 Indian Premier League (IPL) LSG owner Sanjiv Goenka offered words of encouragement to his players after their eight-wicket loss to PBKS.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119912332,imgsize-43510,width-400,resizemode-4/119912332.jpg"

Poll Which player do you think will perform better in Goa: Suryakumar Yadav or Yashasvi Jaiswal? Both will perform equally well Yashasvi Jaiswal Suryakumar Yadav

(The story was updated after an input from sources close to Suryakumar Yadav)

There seems to be a coup underway in Mumbai cricket as hours after Yashasvi Jaiswal sent an email seeking a No Objection Certificate (NOC), another star India batter is learnt to be on his way out too.While no final decision has been taken, there is a possibility of India T20I captain Suryakumar Yadav following his Mumbai teammate to Goa. Sources close to the star batter, however, have denied this move at the moment.The Goa Cricket Association (GCA) is currently reaching out to players across the country after they were promoted to the Elite Group in the Ranji Trophy. While the talks with Jaiswal materialised a few days back, it is also learnt that Hyderabad captain Tilak Varma has also been approached. When contacted, GCA secretary Shambha Desai didn't give any details but said they will be finalising their remaining professional players shortly.""We are currently in talks with many players from the country. I can't give you a name right now. We will be finalising other professional players soon,"" Desai tells TimesofIndia.com.Also See: GT vs RCB Live Score, IPL 2025 Jaiswal has already sought a NOC from the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) and Desai reveals they reached out to the youngster over a week back.""We reached out to Jaiswal some 8-10 days back, he got back to us after thinking over it and now that he has asked for a NOC, the formalities and the required paperwork will be completed,"" adds Desai.The move has raised plenty of eyebrows but those tracking developments feel some incidents could have contributed to the move. Jaiswal was sent off the field by Ajinkya Rahane , the current Mumbai red-ball captain, during a 2022 Duleep Trophy fixture between West Zone and South Zone and there have been strong murmurs of unrest in the Mumbai dressing room since that incident.Even in the last domestic season, Jaiswal, who was set to play the Ranji Trophy semi-final vs Vidarbha complained of pain in the ankle and returned home from Nagpur. He had earlier played vs J&K at home when he opened the innings with Rohit Sharma and returned with scores of 4 & 26.It is further understood that Jaiswal did consult with his senior Mumbai teammates before making the move and captaincy ambition could have also played a role in him sending that email on Wednesday. The timing, however, seems a bit off as the Indian Premier League (IPL) is underway and he had a travel day with the Rajasthan Royals (RR) unit who are set to play Punjab Kings (PBKS) in Chandigarh on April 5.The team managing his commitments maintained silence over the development and even his family members are surprised.",Yashasvi Jaiswal sent an email seeking a No Objection Certificate (NOC) The Goa Cricket Association (GCA) is currently reaching out to players across the country after they were promoted to the Elite Group in the Ranji Trophy.
