The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

Compared to the compassionate, the wicked are “fortunate” —

They carry no weight of remorse in their hearts.

It was not the crime that first unsettled me — it was the nail polish on her fingers.Neat, with a kind of professional perfection.But here was Abirami — standing trial for killing her two young children — with the composure of someone on a casual outing, not a courtroom that might condemn her for life .Seven years ago, when the case broke, my thoughts went first to her children. Even if they saw their mother adding something to their milk, they would have drunk it. Why would a child suspect their mother of harming them?The court found her and her lover guilty of murder. Yet the case felt like more like a warning than a domestic tragedy — of how the lure of illicit relationships and fantasy, amplified by platforms like TikTok (not banned when the crime happened), can erode moral fibres already tattering. For Abirami, elopement wasn’t enough — she wanted to erase every tie that bound her to her existing life. So, she poisoned her children.In nature, some animals kill their young — to spare the weak, to conserve resources. But evolution attunes most species toward nurturing, not destruction. Monkeys — our closest kin — do not practise infanticide. Which makes maternal filicide in humans not just rare, but chilling.Psychologists trace its motives thus:: a suicidal mother saves her child from a motherless life: driven by hallucinations or delusions: the child is killed to take revenge on the father: the child is an obstacleAbirami’s motive lay in the coldest category — the child as hindrance.On the day of verdict, the judge pronounced the sentence – life imprisonment for both. That image stayed with me — the woman waiting for judgement — her hair neatly tied, her face composed. No tremor of guilt . No eyes hollowed by remorse . She cried only when the punishment was pronounced. She asked for mercy — which she never showed her children.Mothers are considered protectors, who don’t eat, sleep or even comb their hair for weeks if their child is unwell. Think of Manisha Kachhadiya, who in the recent Air India IC171 crash in Ahmedabad, shielded her eight‑month‑old son from the flames with her own body, later donating her skin to save him, again. Her instincts were pure, reflexive — child before self.Abirami stood at the opposite pole. Evil isn’t effortless. Yet some do it — and live on, as though nothing happened.Perhaps they have what psychologists call— two selves coexisting:One, the rational self that walks, talks, and performs the social dance.The other, hidden and dark, driven by lust, desire, hatred, or greed.The mind capable of such cruelty is not always broken; sometimes it is calculating — able to measure gestures of grace with the same precision it measures out poison. It can hold two worlds within itself: one that functions in the day, of socialisation, and another that thrives in the night, untouched by empathy.Valluvar saw this long ago. In1072, he speaks with bitter clarity:And so, they walk on, their pulse even — carrying the quietest death of all: a soul untouched by guilt.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text 'Thirukkural' Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.

Pakistani cricket player Haider Ali , 24, was arrested by Greater Manchester Police on rape charges . The incident allegedly occurred on July 23, 2025, in Manchester. He was released on bail while investigations continue. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has suspended him and is providing legal support during the UK investigation.Ali's cricket career began promisingly. He made his mark in the 2020 PSL with Peshawar Zalmi, scoring 239 runs with an impressive strike rate over 157. His international debut was memorable, scoring 54 runs off 33 balls in Manchester, helping Pakistan win by five runs.One of his international matches thereon came against India in the 2022 T20 World Cup in Australia where he scored just 2 runs before being dismissed by Hardik Pandya . During that match in October 2022, played at Melbourne Cricket Ground, Haider couldn't make a name for himself in arguably the biggest game in the sport as he holed out to Suryakumar Yadav.Despite his explosive batting style, Ali has struggled with consistency in his career. He has played two ODIs and 35 T20Is for Pakistan. The Shaheens tour was seen as a chance for him to return to form and fit into Pakistan's aggressive T20 playing style.Ali was touring with Pakistan's Shaheens squad, their 'A' team, in England when the arrest happened in Beckenham. He played all five games of the tour, including matches before and after the alleged incident. He was set to join the team in Australia for a T20 series but has been replaced by Mohammad Faiq.The police have said: ""After receiving a report on Monday 4 August 2025 of a rape, we have arrested a 24-year-old man. It's alleged that the incident occurred on Wednesday 23 July 2025 at a premises in Manchester. The man has since been bailed pending further enquiries. The victim is being supported by officers.""The PCB stated they ""fully respects the legal procedures and processes of the UK"" while providing Ali with legal support.

A mother's instinct kicks in as symptoms spark a race against time

Inside the emergency room where doctors worked swiftly to stabilise baby Capri

Family turmoil, NFL commitments, and the one update fans needed to hear

Global fanbase rallies around the family as messages of support pour in

A late-night dash to the emergency room turned into a wave of relief for Miami Dolphins star Tyreek Hill’s family when his eight-month-old daughter, Capri, was admitted with sudden alarming symptoms. The little girl, shared with Hill’s estranged wife Keeta Vaccaro, had grown unusually warm, lethargic, and “not herself.” Quick-thinking calls and faster medical hands helped her bounce back, with doctors now calling her recovery a ‘positive turn’.Keeta Vaccaro shared the moment every parent dreads — the instant one knows something isn’t right. In her Instagram update, she described noticing Capri’s heavy eyes and warm skin before rushing to phone pediatrician Dr. Jared Friedman. Within minutes, hospital doors swung open and nurses had her baby hooked up for tests. “Last night was scary,” she admitted, her words carrying the weight of those anxious hours.Hospital photos showed Capri, wrapped in a light orange gown, clutching her blanket like a shield. Keeta thanked Dr. Friedman for calming her in the chaos, recalling his text: “We got this. We are a Team!” Blood work and viral panels were done swiftly, each step explained gently so a worried mother could breathe.By sunrise, Capri’s temperature had settled, and she was responding to treatment with more alertness and strength.The scare comes just months after Keeta filed for divorce in April, with Capri’s November 2024 birth marking a bright chapter in an otherwise turbulent year. Hill, sidelined from a Dolphins practice by an undisclosed injury, has not confirmed if he was at the ER. Still, Capri’s life has been well documented on Keeta’s feed — from six-month milestones to Sunday church visits — proof that love can remain the anchor when life turns rough.As Keeta’s post spread, thousands of followers jumped in to comfort her. “Glad she is ok!” one wrote, while another shared, “Oh no!!! I’m glad she is feeling better!” A third simply said, “Thank God she’s ok.” For many parents, it was a story that hit home — that late-night terror, the helpless waiting, the relief of seeing your child smile again.From a panic-filled midnight to a hopeful morning, Capri’s quick recovery has become the only headline that matters for the Hills. And for those who have followed Keeta’s journey, the sight of her daughter resting peacefully is more than news — it’s a shared moment of gratitude. In times like this, the power of family love and the kindness of a supportive community feel more real than ever. Across the globe, fans continue to send prayers and warm wishes, reminding the young family they're not alone in this fight.Although Tyreek Hill and Keeta Vaccaro are separated and navigating a difficult divorce, their shared love for Capri remains the unbreakable bond that keeps them connected as family above all else. In every whispered prayer and hopeful glance toward the future, that love shines through- reminding us all that even in hardship, family endures.Also read: Disney’s ESPN strikes landmark deal to buy NFL Network — league grabs 10% stake in blockbuster swap","Miami Dolphins star Tyreek Hill's daughter Capri rushed to ER.

Fortnite has recently announced its highly awaited collaboration with the Power Rangers. In this crossover, we will see The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers take action against the Kraken-borne bugs in Chapter 6 Season 4 in Fortnite.From the Mighty Morphin Megazord to themed weapons like the Swarmstrike Launcher and the OG “Go Go Power Rangers” theme song, this collaboration will have everything it it. However, the highlight of this collab has to be the Power Rangers costume, which fans can get early even before its actual release.Just like players were able to notch up the Fantastic Four skins early before their release by participating in the Fantastic Four Cup in Fortnite, now there is another couple of tournaments which can grant two Power Ranger skins early - Red Ranger Cup and Pink Ranger Cup.Both the cups are going to take place on August 6, 2025. These are going to be solo tournaments, where players will take part in standard Battle Royale matches. Players need to check out the in-game Compete tab to know the exact timings of these tournaments as they will vary depending upon different locations and timezones.The Red and Pink Rangers Cup will be available for only three hours. In this short span, players can enter a maximum of 10 matches per cup.If you are thinking about maximizing your chances by taking part in both the cups, then keep in mind that they will become live simultaneously and will expire at the same time. So, it is advised to the fans to only focus on one cup at a time.As the name suggests, these two cups will grant the Red Ranger and Pink Ranger outfits respectively. But how to get them? In order to obtain these skins for absolutely free, players need to be on the top spots for different regions in these tournaments. Players can score points to be in the leaderboards by winning matches and eliminating opponent players. Here is the region wise breakdown and top spots to secure the skins:Another interesting fact about these cups are that, these aren't region locked. So, if you are facing difficulties to be in the leaderboard in your native regions, then you will always have the option to change your server to any location for a favorable condition.However, those who fail to be in the top spots in these two cups, don’t need to be disappointed at all. If any player manages to score 8 points in either of the tournaments, then he will be rewarded with the Jason’s Mark Spray (Red Ranger Cup) or the Kimberly Was Here Spray (Pink Ranger Cup) or both.Usually players get their rewards from such tournaments immediately after these end. But the Red Ranger and Pink Ranger outfits will be available to the tournament winners at the start of Chapter 6 Season 4.Apart from the two tournaments, the Season 4 Battle Pass has also featured two different power ranger skins as well - the Green Ranger and the White Ranger.","Red and Pink Power Ranger Cups will grant players Power Ranger skins.

WWE's Friday Night SmackDown's August 8th edition was another episode set around the fallout from SummerSlam 2025. Live from the Bell Centre in Montreal, Quebec, this SmackDown edition is only a week after the big 2-night event in New Jersey - SummerSlam 2025. Fans expected an appearance from John Cena , and he didn't disappoint. He opened the show to loud cheers from the audience, who loved having the real and face Cena back among them.John Cena obviously was going to address what happened at the end of that night at SummerSlam, and the return of none other than Brock Lesnar back to the ring after more than a year of absence. Cena talks about the crowd and how loud and warm it was. He said he feared leaving it all behind after 2 decades in this business, and that people would forget about him once he leaves. He also fears Lesnar, but he is not going to let that hold him down.The Cenation leader says that if Brock Lesnar wanted some, he could come and get some. Just then, Logan Paul makes his entrance to loud boos from the audience as usual. He mocks Cena for turning face again, and says since Cena was giving out matches, he wants one. He proposes a face-off at Clash in Paris when Drew McIntyre attacks Cena from behind.Things were getting a little tough for Cena with these two after him, but just then, none other than Cody Rhodes makes his appearance, and the crowd goes wild.He and Cena make quick work of Paul and McIntyre, and Cena accepts Paul's challenge for Clash in Paris, but before that Rhodes and he will fight Paul and McIntyre in a tag team match tonight. The fans are eating.The first fight of the night is a tag team match between The Motor City Machine Guns vs. Talla Tonga and JC Mateo of Solo Sikoa's faction, MFT. The latter makes quick work of the MCMG and comes out on top after a chokeslam from Talla Tonga on Chris Sabin.Of course, after the match, Solo Sikoa comes to the stage. After hyping the MFT, he says that it's a shame that he is all geared up and ready to fight, but there is no one to fight him. Just then, WWE ’s SmackDown GM Nick Aldis makes an appearance and says since Sikoa is so ready to fight, he has someone he can fight. None other than Sami Zayn comes in, and we have our next match ready to go.The match starts after Sami Zayn is done basking in the cheers of the Montreal crowd. Solo Sikoa tries to back Zayn into a corner, but the latter is not having that. When it seems like Zayn is getting the upper hand, Tala Tonga runs interference, Zayn beckons him when Sikoa comes from behind. But Zayn anticipated that and goes for a folding press, taking the win.Backstage Charlotte Flair tells her tag team partner, Alexa Bliss , that since it's the latter's birthday tomorrow, she got her a gift. But she will give it to her on the stage with grandeur. The Allies of Convenience then make their entrance to loud cheering from the Montreal crowd. Flair shows Bliss her gifts - a cake (for both of them) and a tag team partner for Lilly - Charlie, both wearing a WE'RE NOT FRIENDS T-shirt like Little Miss Bliss.And just when everyone thought we were getting a hug from the two non-friends, Chelsea Green and her Secret Hervice make their entrance. Green begins to talk smack to the Tag Team Champions, and Flair says since it's Bliss' birthday, she is ready to give her another present - a show to a fight with Chelsea Green. The Secret Hervice and their leader tried to dodge and flee, but Nick Aldis comes in once more and gives Bliss his own little gift - a brand new referee whose first match is going to be overseeing the one between Flair and Green. And we have our next fight ready to go.Both women inside the ring - Charlotte Flair and Chelsea Green - are powerful and talented. And they bring it to the ring. Flair goes for her opponent with everything she's got, but Green is not one to be quiet about it. Flair goes for a German suplex, Green counters with a superplex. Green gains momentum for a while, and asks Piper Niven and Alba Fyre to bring in the cake that Flair had gotten for Alexa Bliss' birthday.Unfortunately, for Chelsea Green, the plan backfired. While Bliss takes out the Secret Hervice, Flair goes for a killswitch into the cake. And finally, a Figure Eight proves too much for Green who has no other choice but to accept defeat.The segment ends with Flair and Bliss eating the very cake that Flair used to smash Chelsea Green's face into.We also get a little backstage segment of John Cena and R-Truth getting to catch-up backstage.

Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco’s upcoming September 2025 wedding in Montecito, California, is shaping up to be one of the year’s most exclusive celebrity events — but it may also be one of the most controversial. With a star-studded guest list that reportedly includes Taylor Swift Travis Kelce , and Gomez’s Only Murders in the Building co-stars, the couple is taking extreme measures to keep the two-day celebration private.According to insiders, the pair was furious after details of their wedding leaked, with one source telling the Daily Mail that they even considered moving the event. Instead, they’ve opted to double security and are debating a strict no-phone policy so guests can “be present” without worrying about leaks or paparazzi shots.One of the most talked-about questions is whether Blake Lively will be invited. Reports suggest she’s been edged off the list due to her alleged fallout with Swift, sparked by the ongoing legal battle between Lively and It Ends With Us co-star Justin Baldoni.Gossip columnist Rob Shuter revealed that Lively was already removed from Gomez’s birthday party guest list earlier this year after Swift was nearly subpoenaed in the case.As the source put it, Gomez wanted “love, light, and platform boots — not subpoenas and side-eyes” at her celebrations.RadarOnline insiders also claim Gomez quickly rallied around Swift during the dispute, organizing a girls’ night out as a show of loyalty. “She wanted to show her solidarity, but no doubt she was staking her claim,” the source noted.The alleged rift escalated when Baldoni’s team tried to subpoena Swift, accusing her of pressuring him to accept script rewrites. Swift’s lawyers called it an “unwarranted fishing expedition,” and the request was dropped.Sources close to Swift say she now views the friendship as more trouble than it was worth, with “red flags” she wishes she’d noticed sooner. Reports also suggest Kelce has unfollowed Ryan Reynolds on Instagram, signaling a united front.

How NBA Christmas Day 2025 Opening Sets the Tone

A Tradition That Showcases the NBA’s Past, Present, and Future

Thelineup is set to deliver a full day of basketball drama, star-studded performances, and matchups loaded with both history and future promise. As one of the league’s most celebrated traditions, Christmas basketball once again features five carefully selected games, broadcast nationally on ESPN and ABC, showcasing the NBA’s biggest names and brightest young stars.The NBA Christmas Day 2025 begins with the Cleveland Cavaliers visiting the New York Knicks in a classic Eastern Conference showdown. Madison Square Garden, long considered the heart of Christmas Day basketball, hosts the Knicks for yet another appearance — they lead the league in total Christmas Day games played. This clash carries potential playoff implications, with both teams boasting a mix of emerging stars and experienced veterans who could shape the conference’s future.The marquee matchup of the day sees the reigning NBA champion Oklahoma City Thunder face the San Antonio Spurs. Oklahoma City, fresh off their title run and strengthened by the addition of Nikola Topic, are considered early favorites to build a dynasty. Across the court, Victor Wembanyama looks to solidify himself as one of the world’s top 10 players. The game blends championship experience with generational talent, making it the most anticipated contest of the Christmas schedule. Kevin Durant leads the Houston Rockets into Los Angeles to take on LeBron James and the Lakers. This pairing of two all-time greats - LeBron nearing his 41st birthday - offers fans a rare opportunity to watch aging legends square off while surrounded by dynamic supporting casts. The Lakers’ long-running tradition of Christmas appearances adds to the allure, while Houston’s deep, athletic roster gives the matchup fresh intrigue.The Dallas Mavericks travel to the Bay Area to meet the Golden State Warriors in a Western Conference duel. Dallas brings youthful firepower with rookies like Cooper Flagg, while the Warriors continue to ride the elite play of Stephen Curry. Though not the headliner of the day, the game is a compelling blend of youthful potential and championship pedigree, with both teams capable of delivering a show.The nightcap features a fierce recent rivalry between the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Denver Nuggets. Nikola Jokic, still vying to hold his title as the world’s best player, faces off against the explosive Anthony Edwards. The two teams have traded playoff wins in recent years, making this matchup one of the most competitive and high-intensity games on the holiday slate.In a surprising twist, the Boston Celtics will not appear on Christmas for the first time since 2015. Roster shakeups and injuries have pushed them out of contention for a marquee holiday slot. The Philadelphia 76ers and Phoenix Suns, once holiday mainstays, also miss out as they navigate rebuilding phases and injury concerns.This year’s schedule tilts heavily toward Western Conference representation, a reflection of the league’s current balance of power. With multiple title contenders and rising stars concentrated in the West, the conference is set to own the spotlight on Christmas.While Christmas Day will capture global attention, the NBA tips off its 2025-26 season on October 21 with headline games including the Rockets visiting the Thunder and the Warriors hosting the Lakers.

Phoenix Suns’ Perspective

Los Angeles Lakers’ Offseason Strategy

Why This Move Makes Sense Now

Thehave already made notable moves this offseason, but reports suggest they could still pursue further roster upgrades to bolster their chances in the competitive Western Conference. According to Dean Simon of Sporting News, adding another reliable two-way wing might be the next step, and Phoenix Suns forward Royce O’Neale could be the ideal target.For the Los Angeles Lakers to land O’Neale, the most realistic package would likely involve rookie forward Dalton Knecht and an expiring contract, such as Maxi Kleber’s $11 million deal. While Knecht was initially seen as a promising fit when the Lakers drafted him 17th overall in 2024, the relationship between him and the front office may have soured after an attempted trade during the past season.Royce O’Neale, 32, offers proven playoff experience, defensive versatility, and consistent three-point shooting - a combination that could perfectly complement both LeBron James and Luka Dončić . In the 2024-25 season with the Suns, he delivered career-best numbers in several categories.His ability to hit shots at a high volume from deep while guarding multiple positions makes him a valuable asset for any team aiming for a deep playoff run.The Phoenix Suns could view Knecht as a young scoring forward who fits their ongoing youth movement following the trade of Kevin Durant to the Houston Rockets earlier this summer. Knecht’s upside and offensive potential might appeal to a franchise looking to develop younger talent for the future.This offseason, the Los Angeles Lakers have already added Marcus Smart, the 2022 Defensive Player of the Year, and 2018 No. 1 overall pick Deandre Ayton on team-friendly contracts. While these moves strengthen both ends of the court, Dean Simon notes that “more work is left to be done if the Lakers want to compete with the Western Conference’s top-tier talent.”• Playoff-ready addition: Royce O’Neale brings eight years of NBA experience, including significant postseason minutes.• Perfect floor spacer: His 40.6% accuracy from three on nearly six attempts per game could open up the floor for James and Dončić.• Defensive boost: Capable of guarding wings and smaller forwards effectively.• Low-risk trade: Lakers part with an unproven rookie and an expiring contract for a veteran who fits their immediate championship window.Also read: Why the Los Angeles Lakers Could Move $51 Million Star Following Legendary Luka Doncic Contract Extension, Per NBA Analyst If Rob Pelinka opts to make the deal, the Los Angeles Lakers could significantly enhance their depth and versatility - two qualities that could prove decisive in a loaded Western Conference.","The Los Angeles Lakers could make a move for Phoenix Suns forward Royce O'Neale.

Shedeur Sanders throws his first touchdown pass and earns three-word priceless reaction,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/shedeur-sanders-throws-his-first-touchdown-pass-and-earns-three-word-priceless-reaction/articleshow/123198596.cms,"Shedeur scores his first NFL preseason touchdown (Imagn Images)

Shedeur Sanders shines in NFL preseason debut with Browns, scores first touchdown



Shedeur Sanders: A debut with promise and room to grow



Shedeur Sanders wasted no time making his mark in the NFL . In his preseason debut on Friday night against the Carolina Panthers, the Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback delivered both poise and playmaking flair. Within the first quarter, Sanders not only moved the chains with his legs but also threw the first official touchdown pass of his professional career- a moment that sparked excitement among fans and drew an emotional reaction from his father, Deion Sanders.Shedeur Sanders’s big moment came late in the first quarter. After Browns linebacker Nathaniel Watson recovered a fumble deep in Panthers territory, Cleveland found themselves just 10 yards from the end zone. Two plays later, Sanders zipped a perfectly placed seven-yard strike to Kaden Davis, threading the football between two defenders for six points. The rookie had already flashed his versatility earlier, scrambling 10 yards on a third-and-9 to secure his first NFL first down.Interestingly, Sanders wasn’t even expected to start this game. Entering camp, he was listed last on the team’s initial depth chart, competing against Kenny Pickett, Joe Flacco, and Dillon Gabriel.But with Pickett and Gabriel sidelined by injuries, Sanders got the nod—and he seized the moment. His first touchdown came on his fourth drive, capitalizing after a muffed punt set up another red-zone chance.For Deion Sanders, this was a proud parent moment. Watching from afar rather than the sidelines, the Pro Football Hall of Famer celebrated online, posting, “Yes Lawd! Yes!” before the night was over. Before kickoff, Deion had expressed confidence in his son’s readiness, saying, “He’s gonna be a problem out there tonight.”The debut wasn’t flawless—Sanders missed an open target and felt the full brunt of NFL pass rush pressure for the first time—but it was undeniably encouraging. He showcased mobility, arm talent, and composure under the lights, converting key third downs both by running and throwing.With the Browns’ quarterback competition still wide open, Sanders’ performance on Friday has given coaches more to consider. If he continues to build on this momentum, the rookie could climb the depth chart faster than expected—and perhaps turn what began as a temporary opportunity into something far more permanent.Also Read: Tom Brady heaps praise on Patrick Mahomes’ career so far: ""Love watching him play”","Shedeur Sanders, the Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback, made his preseason debut on Friday night against the Carolina Panthers.

“I don’t want to make The Athletic any money,”

Jordon Hudson called a podcaster out of the blue and used a line that shocked the hosts. The 24-year-old, who is dating coach Bill Belichick, called Charlotte Wilder on a Saturday night and later spoke with Wilder and Madeline Hill across several calls that week. The Sports Gossip Show hosts say Hudson announced herself as “the president of your universe” and that she liked being compared to Tree Paine, Taylor Swift ’s long-time publicist. The hosts thought Hudson might come on the show, but the talks fell apart after angry calls and long, confusing conversations.Charlotte Wilder and Madeline Hill said the first call came after their episode about the Miss Maine pageant. Wilder said Hudson told her she liked being called Bill Belichick’s PR person and agreed when the hosts compared her to Tree Paine.Tree Paine has been Taylor Swift’s publicist since 2014 and helped guide Swift through big scandals and media moments.

Connor McDavid’s path to Wayne Gretzky’s points record: Can the Oilers captain make NHL history?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/connor-mcdavids-path-to-wayne-gretzkys-points-record-can-the-oilers-captain-make-nhl-history/articleshow/123187848.cms,"Wayne Gretzky's seemingly unbreakable NHL points record of 2,857 looms large as Connor McDavid chases history (Getty Images)

How realistic is it for Connor McDavid to catch Wayne Gretzky’s untouchable points record?

The more attainable milestone: Oilers’ all-time points leader

Wayne Gretzky’s career point total — 2,857 — has long been considered hockey’s most unbreakable record. Across 1,487 NHL regular-season games, “The Great One” scored 894 goals and recorded 1,963 assists, dominating an era when goal-scoring exploded. The 1980s saw Gretzky surpass the 200-point mark four times, with league scoring averages often exceeding 7.5 goals per game. In today’s NHL, where the average sits closer to 6.0, matching that level of production presents a far steeper challenge.Connor McDavid has been rewriting the modern offensive playbook. Through 712 games, the Edmonton Oilers captain has tallied 361 goals and 721 assists for 1,082 points — an astounding pace in the current low-scoring climate. At just 28 years old, McDavid has already topped 120 points in three of the last four seasons, showing no signs of slowing down.While McDavid’s production is elite, the numbers reveal the monumental scale of the task. Over his career, McDavid averages about 125 points per season. Gretzky’s pace? Around 158 per year — even after factoring in his final seasons during the so-called “dead puck era.”To pass Gretzky’s 2,857 points, McDavid would need another 1,775 points.At his current pace, that’s more than 14 additional seasons, or roughly 1,165 games, with no significant decline. This would require him to remain productive into his early 40s, in an Ovechkin-like career marathon. Realistically, the physical demands and inevitable drop in production make this almost impossible.While Gretzky’s all-time NHL mark may remain out of reach, McDavid is well within striking distance of another historic achievement — becoming Edmonton’s all-time franchise points leader. Gretzky’s Oilers record stands at 1,669 points, meaning McDavid needs just 587 more. At his current pace, he could surpass that within five seasons.Of course, one key factor remains — his contract. McDavid’s current deal expires on July 1, 2026, and securing an extension will be crucial if he hopes to cement that title in an Oilers uniform.Also Read: “Pretty dumb”: Fans revolt as NHL turns its ‘heritage’ Stadium Series into a Florida marketing stunt Breaking Gretzky’s NHL record might be a dream too far, but McDavid’s legacy as one of the game’s greatest scorers is already secure — and his chase for franchise history is very much alive.","Connor McDavid has scored 361 goals and 721 assists for 1,082 points in 712 games.

Gautam Gambhir's fiery press conferences: Every time the India head coach lost his cool

Poll Should Kuldeep Yadav have been included in the playing XI during the recent series against England? Yes, he’s a valuable asset. No, the current strategy was justified.

Kuldeep Yadav (Getty Images)

Is Kuldeep completely a dud with the bat?

NEW DELHI: As an age-old adage goes in cricket, ""Batters win you games, but bowlers win you tournaments."" Sadly, Team India 's head coach Gautam Gambhir doesn't believe in this theory when it comes to Test cricket.Since he has taken over the role of head coach of Team India, results have been a mixed bag. In T20Is, India are world champions, and given the depth of talent with Jasprit Bumrah in it, they are going to dominate world cricket for a while. The future of one-day cricket is in a fix, but India under Gambhir did win the 2024 Champions Trophy, with two of the best in the format -- Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli -- backed by a four-pronged spin attack. In two years’ time, even without these two stalwarts, this Indian cricket team can win the next World Cup in South Africa and put that November 19 ghost behind them.Gambhir's predecessor, Rahul Dravid, has called the depth in India's white-ball talent ""scary,"" and he is right because it is a well-oiled system that will produce results.Arguably, the most challenging job for any coach and captain is Test cricket, the format which is probably the epitome of the sport. Test cricket tests the character of individuals, and you need strategy, and most importantly, you need bowlers who can take 20 wickets and win you matches.Twice India have come agonisingly close to winning the World Test Championship (WTC), only to finish second.Under Gautam Gambhir, India have played 15 Test matches, winning five and losing eight, including an embarrassing series defeat at home to New Zealand, their first in 12 years. His red-ball tactics have raised eyebrows; his rigidity in prioritising batting depth over balance, and his decision to keep Kuldeep Yadav on the bench, cost India a golden chance to bury the Bazballers once and for all. India did manage to draw the series, thanks to a spirited performance backed by the extraordinary skill of Mohammed Siraj , but they should have beaten toothless England.In the Delhi cricket circuit, there is a famous line about Gautam Gambhir: ""If he likes you, he will go beyond to make sure that you are in the playing XI, and if he doesn't, you won't be near the premises of the Arun Jaitley Stadium."" Gambhir has had his fair share of controversies since his playing days, and he is still abrasive as a coach. ""You are just a groundsman,"" he hurled towards Surrey groundsman Lee Fortis in an argument. It is Delhi's equivalent of slang like ""teri aukaat kya hai? (what is your status?)""Coming back to cricket, there were so many loopholes in Gambhir's strategy in the recently concluded Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy. On mostly flat England decks, wrist-spinner Kuldeep Yadav, who had floored England at home on similar pitches with 19 wickets in four Tests, was carrying drinks. The reason given was that the management wanted batting depth. There were three Indians in the top five leading run-getters of the series; Harry Brook managed to pip Rishabh Pant by two runs as the Indian wicketkeeper-batter missed the Oval Test due to injury.No, coach Gambhir, he isn’t. He is not flashy, but he knows how to put a price on his wicket. Remember his 131-ball vigil in Ranchi, where he scored 28 and forged a 76-run stand for the eighth wicket with Dhruv Jurel? India eventually won the match. In Dharamsala again, he scored a valuable 30. A few years ago, on a dicey Chattogram pitch, he faced 114 balls for his 40, and his all-round display earned him the Player of the Match award.Forget Kuldeep, what was the point of sending Akash Deep as night watchman at Lord's when you had an accomplished lower-order batter in Washington Sundar, fresh from his beautiful spell? India could have used Akash Deep's lusty blows when Ravindra Jadeja was trying hard to farm the strike in the fourth innings.Anshul Kamboj was called in as an injury replacement for Arshdeep Singh and was given a Test debut at Old Trafford, probably the flattest pitch of the series. He looked all at sea, and the reasoning was that they wanted him for the overcast conditions. The most suitable place for Anshul or even Arshdeep to bowl was on the spicy The Oval pitch, but they were carrying drinks.India's No. 3 has been reduced to a game of musical chairs. Sai Sudharsan played the first Test but was dropped at Edgbaston. Karun Nair, who was India's designated No. 6 at Headingley, got the opportunity and played the next two Tests, but was later dropped at Old Trafford. Coach Gambhir’s reasoning was that no one in his side is dropped, they are just looking for good balance. Karun did make a comeback at The Oval because Pant was out and India were looking to strengthen the batting, and Washington Sundar, who had scored a match-winning century at No. 6 in the fourth Test, was batting at No. 8.Yes, India did manage to steal a series draw against England, but they should have won it, and coach Gambhir needs to reflect on his philosophy going forward.","Gautam Gambhir has had his fair share of controversies since his playing days.

NEW DELHI: India's spin great Ravichandran Ashwin has served up a hilarious twist to the swirling IPL trade rumours, turning speculation into prime entertainment. In a teaser of the upcoming episode of Kutti Stories with Ash, the 38-year-old is seen in conversation with Rajasthan Royals skipper Sanju Samson — whose own future has been a hot talking point in recent days.As per Cricbuzz, Samson is reportedly unhappy with the RR management and has requested a trade or release. Meanwhile, another report has suggested that Ashwin and Chennai Super Kings could part ways, with the veteran potentially stepping down from his role as Director of Operations at the CSK Academy.Reacting to the chatter, Ashwin didn't miss the chance to poke fun.“I have a lot of questions to ask. But before that, I thought I'll come directly and trade myself. I am happy to stay back in Kerala. There are a lot of rumours going on. Neither do I know of anything. So, I thought I'll reach out to you and ask you. If I can stay back in Kerala and you can travel back to Chennai,” Ashwin said, leaving Samson in stitches.The light-hearted exchange has quickly gone viral, with fans enjoying Ashwin's ability to turn tense speculation into comedy gold.Bought by CSK at the IPL 2025 auction for Rs 9.75 crore, Ashwin had a modest season, taking seven wickets in nine games.

The WNBA is having the worst kind of problem recently, what with s*x toys dying around the arenas during game time. Sophie Cunningham, who had previously posted a tweet asking fans to stop throwing these s*x toys in the court, actually got hit by one of them during her latest game. After the incident, remembering her mother’s warning before the game, Cunningham had the best response to the incident. But all that does not mean she is not going to enjoy her time while all this is going on.Sophie Cunningham, after her game against the Los Angeles Sparks, is having an excellent time, while also enjoying her games. She recently showed up twinning alongside teammate Lexie Hull, and fans couldn't help but be in awe of the two.She also took to her X (formerly Twitter) to quote-tweet one of her previous tweets. Previously, after the second time a s*x toy was thrown during a WNBA game, she had tweeted ""stop throwing d*ldos on the court… you’re going to hurt one of us.” After the latest game against the Sparks, she quoted that same tweet, writing, ""this did NOT age well.""She also took to her Instagram stories later to say, “No way that thing actually hit me.I knew I shouldn’t have tweeted that,” referring to the incident in court. Hopefully, those who have been throwing these things at the players can stop, and such incidents won't happen again.Indiana Fever guard Sophie Cunningham was up against the Los Angeles Sparks in her latest game, when yet another s*x you came flying in, and hit the WNBA star on her leg. The toy grazed her leg, and the play was halted for a short while to remove the offensive object from the court before things could resume. After the game, Cunningham sat for her new podcast show, Show Me Something, where she shared a hilarious warning he got from her mother.“The funny thing is my parents and my sister, they literally text me before every game saying, like, ‘good luck.’ My mom, instead of my ‘good luck’ text she goes, ‘Watch out for flying d*ldos tonight. And then the other one said, ‘Did you really just post the d*ldo tweet? It got some legs.’ She goes, ‘It’s funny a lot of others think so too. Did you see the d*ldo hit the court?’ I never thought that I’d be talking about this with Momma P. ”Instead of the usual ""good luck"" or ""all the best"" texts that her mother sends her before games, this time around, senior Cunningham had a different text sent, to warn her daughter. And watching ""out for flying d*ldos"" was the way to go, not that the Indiana Fever guard had much luck with trying to watch out for the mean greens.Also Read: “All because they are women”: Fans outraged over s*x toy being thrown at Sophie Cunningham again despite her lighthearted posts","Indiana Fever guard Sophie Cunningham was hit by a s*x toy during her latest game.

fcuAs he ends another successful year of his career, Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry is leading the team once again as they get ready for another championship push. He recently stated that he plays just for the championship and that is his greatest source of motivation. On the other hand, according to Jake Fischer of Bleacher Report, the G.S. Warriors has expressed interest in bringing in a seasoned guard to support Stephen Curry. Stephen Curry , who has devoted his entire career to the Golden State Warriors, is still one of the NBA's most devoted players. In the 2009 NBA draft, the player was chosen as the seventh overall pick and joined the team. He then went on to lead four championship victories.Recently, he talked candidly about what drove him to approach another year. He discussed his outlook on the forthcoming season and his own drive in an interview with SiriusXM NBA Radio. The pro golfer said:""I truly believe we can be championship-relevant in the sense of we're probably going to be a favorite in any conversation. Let's just be honest, man. The fact that he showed you with enough time of rest that the Olympics kicked in quickly, right? You don't get the neck. You don't get those neck games here…”He further continued:“Listen, I heard all the soups and sh*t and you know, he eats this, he eats that cold, right? All it takes is the f*ck shot every week and you like that. So he's willing to do whatever it takes to get down. Now the fact that he was doing what he was doing while he was fat…”He then added:“What do you think about that? I don't want to hear anything about defense. He's not losing away to play no defense. He lost weight to see if they can play some defense… We just got somebody to play defense. We don't need Luca to play defense… He's fine with me…”The NBA legend continues to motivate the Golden State Warriors supporters as he enters his 17th season.

Geno Smith goes viral for giving middle finger to Seahawks fans who compared him to JaMarcus Russell,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/geno-smith-goes-viral-for-giving-middle-finger-to-seahawks-fans-who-compared-him-to-jamarcus-russell/articleshow/123196088.cms,"(AP Photo/Paul Sancya)

A brutal sign sparked a brutal response from Geno Smith and Maxx Crosby



The “bust” insult hits different when Geno’s whole career has been a comeback



Fans are hilariously divided, some love the energy, others say “relax, it’s preseason”



NFL Fans React to Geno Smith Flipping Off Seahawks Crowd Before Preseason Game

T here’s preseason drama, and then there’s Geno Smith and DE Maxx Crosby marching into a stadium, flipping off the former fanbase, and setting social media ablaze before kickoff. During what should’ve been a quiet Raiders vs. Seahawks warm-up game, things went from 0 to spicy when a fan decided to bring the ultimate insult to the tailgate party, a sign reading “Bigger bust — Geno or JaMarcus Russell?” Geno saw it and let’s just say, he responded with exactly one finger.And now the internet is fully in their feelings.So here’s what went down, as Geno Smith made his entrance into Lumen Field, a group of Seahawks fans greeted him with more than just the usual boos. One fan held up a savage sign that instantly triggered NFL Twitter, “Bigger bust — Geno or JaMarcus Russell?”Smith didn’t just glance and ignore it. Nope, he delivered a middle finger salute right at the crowd along with Maxx Crosby, captured in crystal-clear video and instantly reposted across Reddit, X, and Instagram. And that gesture? It was trending within the hour.No word yet from the NFL on whether a fine is coming their way, but let’s be honest, this was less about league protocol and more about a player hitting back at a narrative that refuses to die.To understand why Geno reacted the way he did, you’ve gotta look at the bigger picture.The man’s been through it, a second-round pick who flamed out with the Jets, bounced between backup gigs, and didn’t start a full season for years.But then 2022 happened, he came back as the Seahawks starter, threw for over 4,000 yards, and won NFL Comeback Player of the Year. Not to mention, he replaced Russell Wilson and actually played better.So yeah, being compared to JaMarcus Russell, widely considered one of the biggest draft busts in NFL history, might’ve felt like a slap in the face. Especially when he’s already rewritten his own story.And the irony? He did it in Seattle, the very city now clowning him from the stands.It didn’t take long for the internet to go full NFL roast mode.Meanwhile, Seahawks fans are doubling down, insisting the sign was just “trolling” and that Geno should’ve had thicker skin. Others think the whole thing proves he’s still holding onto old grudges especially given that it’s only preseason.It may have been a preseason game, but Geno Smith treated that sign like it was fourth-and-goal. In one split-second reaction, he reminded Seattle fans that he saw the hate and wasn’t about to let it slide.Also read - Texans camp turns tragic: C.J.

Los Angeles Lakers superstar Luka Doncic was around 230 pounds when he played for the Dallas Mavericks last season. However, he appears thinner this season. Nevertheless, he faced intense criticism for his physical structure while playing for the Dallas Mavericks. Now, recently, the team’s management cited his weight issue as the reason behind his release from the team. Meanwhile, with a stunning offseason makeover, the Slovenian star has joined his home team for EuroBasket 2025 and put an end to these comments and criticism.NBA legend Luka Doncic recently decided to focus on improving his physical condition after the L.A. Lakers were unexpectedly knocked out of the playoffs in the opening round. He apparently worked out day and night and shed around thirty-one pounds.He eventually got used to it, although it took some time. According to Slovenia's Svet24, he informed the reporters:""I know how much basketball means to me. It has given me a lot in my life… But I also like to play other sports. The first three or four days were hard for me without basketball, but then I just got used to it.""Additionally, Luca Doncic also appeared on the cover of Men's Health Magazine. His incredible weight loss throughout the offseason was highlighted in a new article. Furthermore, the coach of the Los Angeles Lakers has praised Luka Doncic for his unexpected weight drop. He said:“I think he's probably the best one-on-one player in the game.He can get off his shot against anybody… Whether you're trying to pressure him or you put a small guy to disrupt him, he just puts his back on you and shoots over the top. He looks fantastic, and I think with everything that has happened, it's a challenge for him.”However, after this, a lot of people speculated that his weight reduction was most likely a side effect of the popular weight-loss drug Ozempic . But Luka Doncic provided a different explanation for his weight loss.He revealed to the magazine that he began intermittent fasting in June to reduce inflammation and help his body's healing process. He also acknowledged that he supposedly consumes one protein drink and two high-protein meals every day of the week.He also gave credit to his weight and agility training, along with a low-sugar, gluten-free diet. Now, he is fit and fine, ready to help the Slovenian team in the EuroBasket 2025.Also read: Was Luka Doncic’s weight loss natural?

Fans predict ‘most watched preseason game ever’ as Shedeur Sanders makes NFL debut,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/fans-predict-most-watched-preseason-game-ever-as-shedeur-sanders-makes-nfl-debut/articleshow/123196352.cms,"NFL fans say Shedeur Sanders will make Browns’ preseason opener ‘most watched game ever’ (Image via: Getty Images)

Shedeur Sanders’ NFL debut with Browns draws massive hype before preseason opener



The celebrity and fan hype is off the charts



“Let’s go @ShedeurSanders 💪🏾.”

“Give the people what they want 👏🏾👏🏾

“We will ALL be tuned in”

“This might be the most watched preseason game ever ngl.”

Why this debut could matter way more than just preseason

Most preseason games barely get a passing glance. This one? Feels like the Super Bowl in August. Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders- yes, that Shedeur, son of Deion “Coach Prime” Sanders is set to make his NFL debut tonight, and the hype machine is in overdrive. From NFL legends like Dez Bryant and Reggie Bush to fans calling it “the most watched preseason game ever,” the energy around a game that doesn’t even count in the standings is completely unhinged.And the wildest part? Two weeks ago, Shedeur was sitting fourth on the Browns’ QB depth chart.The Browns didn’t exactly plan this. Shedeur entered camp behind Joe Flacco, Kenny Pickett, and Jameis Gabriel. Then, injuries and roster shuffles happened, and suddenly the 22-year-old rookie is starting against the Carolina Panthers.The move lit up NFL talk shows. Robert Griffin III claimed Shedeur was being “set up to fail” by starting so early. ESPN’s Dan Orlovsky clapped back, saying the opportunity came because “football happens” players get hurt, and depth charts change.Whatever the reason, it’s turned Shedeur from an afterthought into the headline act of preseason Week 1.Scroll through social media, and it’s clear, people aren’t just watching, they’re invested. Dez Bryant tweeted,Reggie Bush chimed in with👏🏾.” Fans are flooding timelines with promises like,andAnd this isn’t just Browns Nation talking. College football fans who watched Shedeur light it up at Jackson State and Colorado are coming along for the ride. The crossover between NFL and pop culture right now is unreal.If Shedeur’s feeling the pressure, he’s not showing it. He’s said multiple times he’s “still the same guy,” focusing on preparation and execution, not the noise.Even more telling, he’s asked both fans and his dad, Deion Sanders, to give him space during this stretch so he can lock in. No flashy distractions, just football. It’s a level of self-awareness you don’t always see in rookies.Sure, it’s “only” the preseason. But one big performance could flip the Browns’ QB conversation heading into the regular season. With veteran depth shaky due to injuries, Shedeur has a rare chance to stake his claim early.And in an NFL landscape where rookies often get buried until Year 2 or 3, commanding this much attention before taking a single official snap is a career-launching moment. Even if the stats don’t sparkle tonight, the hype has already put his name in headlines far outside the usual football crowd.Also read - Geno Smith goes viral for giving middle finger to Seahawks fans who compared him to JaMarcus Russell","Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders is set to make his NFL debut tonight.
