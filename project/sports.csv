""Denver was adamant about retaining Porter amid NBA trade rumors this season,""

The Los Angeles Lakers are reportedly considering a major roster shakeup as they weigh the possibility of parting ways with Austin Reaves to pursue Denver Nuggets star Michael Porter Jr. The move, which could significantly bolster the Lakers' three-point shooting, comes amid their push to solidify their position in the Western Conference playoff race.Since acquiring Luka Doncic in a blockbuster trade on February 2, the Lakers have shown flashes of brilliance but have struggled recently, losing their last three games. Despite the setbacks, the team remains in contention for the No. 2 seed in the West. However, their three-point shooting has been a glaring weakness this season, with the team shooting just 35.7% from beyond the arc under head coach JJ Redick.This has led to speculation that the Los Angeles Lakers may target Michael Porter Jr., a proven three-point specialist, in the offseason. Porter, who signed a $179 million contract with the Nuggets, has been one of the league's most consistent long-range shooters since entering the NBA. As a rookie, he shot an impressive 42.2% from downtown and has maintained a high level of efficiency, connecting on at least 39.7% of his three-point attempts in four of his last five seasons.This season, the 2023 NBA champion is averaging 18.2 points and 6.9 rebounds per game while shooting 50.6% from the field and 39.9% from three-point range. His ability to move without the ball and deliver a flawless release makes him an ideal fit for a Los Angeles Lakers team in need of reliable perimeter shooting.While Austin Reaves has been a versatile and valuable asset for the Lakers, Porter's elite shooting could provide the team with a significant upgrade. Reaves has been a key contributor, but his skill set may not be enough to address the Lakers' most pressing needs.However, acquiring Porter won't be easy. The Nuggets have consistently expressed their commitment to keeping him, especially after his crucial role in their championship run.making it unlikely they would part with him unless he experiences a decline in performance.Also read: NBA Offseason Rumors: Golden State Warriors eyeing $90 million Los Angeles Clippers star to push Stephen Curry and Jimmy Butler's championship aspirations As the playoffs approach, the Los Angeles Lakers are expected to keep a close eye on Porter's situation. If the Nuggets' stance softens, Los Angeles could make a strong push to bring the sharpshooter to Crypto.com Arena, potentially reshaping their roster for a deeper postseason run.","The Los Angeles Lakers are reportedly considering a major roster shakeup as they weigh the possibility of parting ways with Austin Reaves.

However, Friday also marked a major shift in the Iowa basketball landscape, as longtime men’s basketball head coach— Connor’s father— was dismissed from his role after 15 seasons. Caitlin Clark and her boyfriend, Connor McCaffery, were spotted together in public after Fran McCaffery’s tenure at Iowa came to an abrupt end.McCaffery's tenure as the Iowa head coach was a success, however, he was not able to push the team past the Round of 32 in the NCAA Tournament. Many believe it has ultimately led to his departure. The Hawkeyes posted a 297-207 overall record and made seven NCAA Tournament appearances under his leadership.McCaffery's best season came in 2021-22 when Iowa finished 26-10 and secured its first Big Ten Tournament championship since 2006. The team was led by Keegan Murray, who later became the fourth overall pick in the 2022 NBA Draft.McCaffery’s final season fell short of expectations. Iowa ended the regular season at 17-16, struggling in conference play with a 7-13 record. Following their second-round loss to Illinois in the Big Ten Tournament also raised questions about McCaffery’s future.Eventually, the program parted ways with the 65-year-old coach. Iowa will now pay out McCaffery’s $4.2 million contract buyout, originally set to run through 2028.The news of Fran McCaffery’s firing sparked a reaction from former Iowa standout Luka Garza . The current Minnesota Timberwolves center took to X to share a heartfelt message: “Thank you Coach for changing my life, and the lives of so many others. You believed in a way that not many others did. Choosing to play in the black and gold was the best decision I have ever made for a lot of reasons, but mainly because I was able to be coached by you.” Clark showed her support by retweeting Garza’s post.Connor McCaffery, Fran’s son and Clark’s boyfriend, played 166 games for his father at Iowa and currently works as an assistant coach at Butler.

Is Rodgers headed for a coaching role in San Francisco?



Aaron Rodgers Caught Deeply Contemplating His Future On Beach | Pat McAfee Show

Why the 49ers and Why now?



Aaron Rodgers’ future in the NFL remains one of the biggest talking points in football. While teams like the Pittsburgh Steelers and New York Giants are rumored to be in the mix, a surprising alternative has emerged—coaching. Reports suggest Rodgers may step away from playing in 2025 and join the San Francisco 49ers ’ staff, potentially setting the stage for a major leadership role in the future.Rodgers has repeatedly dismissed the idea of coaching post-retirement, but circumstances change. As one of the most intelligent quarterbacks in NFL history, he possesses the strategic mind that could make him a successful coach. With insiders predicting that he may not suit up in 2025, some believe he could step into a coaching role with the 49ers, possibly positioning himself as Kyle Shanahan ’s eventual replacement.""While Kyle Shanahan is safe for the 2025 NFL season, there is a real chance that his future in 2026 is not,"" Marissa Myers noted. ""With that in mind, it presents the perfect opportunity for Rodgers to take the next step in his career, and enter the realm of coaching."" (via: Sporting News)Also Read: Steelers set to sign veteran QB in 2025 Free Agency, but it’s not who you think Shanahan has guided San Francisco to multiple deep playoff runs, but his tenure has also been marked by inconsistency. With four playoff misses in eight seasons, concerns about his long-term viability continue to grow. Critics argue that his inability to adapt is holding the 49ers back. Rodgers, a four-time MVP, could bring a fresh perspective and serve as a mentor for young quarterback Brock Purdy, helping the team transition into its next phase.Adding to the intrigue, Rodgers’ California roots make this move even more compelling. A lifelong 49ers fan, he once dreamed of being drafted by them. If he transitions into coaching, leading his hometown team would be a full-circle moment in his storied career.Rodgers remains unpredictable, keeping fans and analysts on edge. But if he decides to swap his helmet for a headset, the 49ers could be his next big move, one that shakes up the NFL landscape and redefines his legacy.","Aaron Rodgers may step away from playing in 2025 and join the San Francisco 49ers ’ staff.

Jimmy Butler and Steve Kerr Exchange Heated Words After Controversial Late-Game Shot in Warriors' Win Over Portland Trail Blazers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/jimmy-butler-and-steve-kerr-exchange-heated-words-after-controversial-late-game-shot-in-warriors-win-over-portland-trail-blazers/articleshow/118941015.cms,"Image Via Getty

Steve Kerr Explains Why He Told Jimmy Butler to Break NBA’s Unwritten Rule

Jimmy Butler’s Triple-Double Overshadowed by Controversial Shot

Jimmy Butler single handedly forces a shot clock violation

Gary Payton II Scores Career-High 26 Points to Lead Golden State Warriors to Victory

What should have been a straightforward win for the Warriors turned into a mess after the game. Jimmy Butler 's triple-double was overshadowed by a last-second shot that really upset the Portland Trail Blazers players — and it looked like it got under Butler's skin too. A video from after the game showed a tense moment between him and coach Steve Kerr , who later revealed he was the one who told Butler to take that shot. Here’s the whole story behind that unexpected twist.As the clock wound down in the Warriors' 130-120 win over the Portland Trail Blazers, Jimmy Butler was in a bit of a bind. With Golden State comfortably ahead and only a few ticks left, he had to choose between holding the ball or taking a shot. Usually, teams would just let the clock run out in these moments. But after a quick glance at Steve Kerr on the sideline, Butler decided to take an open jumper, which ruffled a few feathers among the Trail Blazers players.Footage from after the game showed Jimmy Butler frustrated during a brief but intense talk with Steve Kerr. Kerr later explained his reasoning, saying, “I told him, we don't do shot clock violations. If there’s a shot clock differential, we always shoot.” Kerr’s firm stance on this philosophy put Butler in a tricky situation, even though he seemed a little reluctant on the court.Butler had a standout performance that evening! He scored 15 points, pulled down 10 rebounds, and tallied 10 assists, marking his second triple-double this season and his first as a Warrior. His previous triple-double was on December 16 while he was with the Miami Heat. The Warriors are sitting pretty with a 12-1 record when Butler plays, highlighting his significant role in their success.While all this is happening, Stephen Curry keeps shining this season, hitting five 3-pointers and bringing his total to 251. This is his 11th season with 250+ threes, which is an NBA record. He’s just two 3-pointers away from being the first player to hit 4,000 career triples.Even with the fuss going on, the Warriors' depth was a key factor in their victory. Gary Payton II had an impressive night, scoring a career-high 26 points and tying his record with four 3-pointers. Buddy Hield also made his mark with six 3-pointers and 20 points, showing off the Warriors' strong offensive lineup.The arguments between Jimmy Butler and Steve Kerr after the game definitely caught some attention, but it doesn't take away from how well the Warriors played. With Stephen Curry on the verge of hitting a major milestone and Butler stepping up with his all-around skills, Golden State is proving they're a force to be reckoned with.Also Read - Shai Gilgeous-Alexander vs Nikola Jokic: Who Truly Deserves the 2025 NBA MVP?

NEW DELHI: Star Indian batter Virat Kohli dropped a major hint about his cricketing future on Saturday, admitting that he ""might not have another Australia tour in him."" Kohli made the candid revelation while speaking at the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) Innovation Lab after arriving in Bengaluru ahead of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025.Reflecting on his recent struggles on Australian soil, Kohli stated, ""I might not have another Australia tour in me, so I am at peace with whatever happened in the past."" The statement has sparked speculation among fans about whether the cricketing icon is considering stepping away from Test cricket in the near future.Despite the speculation, Kohli clarified that he is not mulling retirement at the moment, emphasising that he still loves playing the game. ""Don't get nervous. I'm not making any announcements. As of now, everything is fine. I still love playing the game,"" he reassured his fans. The prolific batter added that he no longer aspires to achieve milestones, instead focusing on playing for the ""pure joy"" of the sport.""It pretty much comes down to just the pure joy, enjoyment, competitive streak, and love for the game. And as long as that is there, I will continue to play. As I said today, I am not playing for any achievement,"" Kohli said.Kohli also shared insights into the challenges of finding the right moment to retire, recalling a conversation with former Indian captain Rahul Dravid. ""The competitive streak doesn't allow you to find the answer [for retirement]. I had a very interesting conversation with Rahul Dravid. He said you always have to stay in touch with yourself. Figure out where you are placed in your life, and the answer is not that easy,"" he explained.The 36-year-old acknowledged that advancing age has made it tougher to maintain peak performance. ""Now, it takes much more effort as people who have played the game for a long period of time understand. You can't do so many things in your mid to late 30s that you can in your mid-20s. I'm at a bit of a different place in my life as well,"" Kohli admitted.Despite recent struggles, including a lackluster performance on the most recent Australia tour, Kohli has come to terms with his ups and downs. ""You have to make peace with whatever's happened in your life. Like in 2014 [against England], I still had the chance to go in 2018 and do what I did. It might not have been the case this time,"" he said.Kohli also touched on his mental approach to failure, emphasising the importance of blocking out external pressure. ""Once you start thinking of the disappointment from the outside, then you start burdening yourself way more. That’s something I've surely experienced in Australia as well,"" he noted.Beyond his own future, Kohli expressed his optimism about Indian cricket and the evolving landscape of women's sports, particularly the Women’s Premier League ( WPL ). He also looked forward to cricket being part of the 2028 Olympics, expressing hope for India to secure a medal.The RCB icon, who remains the highest run-scorer in IPL history with 8,004 runs in 252 matches, is set to join the RCB camp shortly as the team prepares for the new season under new captain Rajat Patidar.","Virat Kohli admits he ""might not have another Australia tour in him"" Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) star says he is not mulling retirement at the moment.

Marking the special day, Sanjana shared a touching message featuring song lyrics that encapsulated her deep bond with the Indian pace spearhead .Sanjana marked her fourth wedding anniversary with Jasprit Bumrah by sharing heartfelt lyrics from the song ""Tu Hai Toh"" on Instagram.""Tu hai toh dil dhadakta hai/Tu na toh ghar ghar nahi lagta/Tu hai to darr nahi lagta/Happy 4,"" wrote Bumrah's wife.The couple, who tied the knot in an intimate ceremony in Goa in 2021, welcomed their son, Angad, on September 4, 2023.While the celebration was all about love and togetherness, Bumrah’s absence from the field has been a topic of discussion.The Mumbai Indians pacer has been recovering from a lower back injury sustained during the fifth Test against Australia in January. The injury sidelined him from bowling in the second innings of the Sydney Test, which India lost by six wickets.As a result, Bumrah also missed India’s victorious Champions Trophy campaign, where the Men in Blue lifted the title without their premier fast bowler.His absence was a major blow, but the team management opted to give him ample time to recover, with an eye on the upcoming Test series against England in June.""His recuperation is going well. But at this stage, it’s better to give him more time to return to peak fitness,"" a source told PTI.The BCCI medical team has not provided a definitive timeline for his return, but he has been gradually increasing his workload in the nets. Chief selector Ajit Agarkar had earlier advised five weeks of ""off-loading"" to manage stress on his back, considering his history of similar injuries.With IPL 2025 around the corner, Mumbai Indians will be hoping for Bumrah’s return, especially after their disappointing tenth-place finish last season. However, his availability for the initial games remains uncertain.","Jasprit Bumrah and Sanjana Ganesan celebrate their fourth wedding anniversary.

A routine check-up turned into a fight for his life



Dwyane Wade Reveals Cancer Diagnosis Led to Kidney Surgery | E! News

The toughest challenge yet—Physically and Emotionally

Dwyane Wade- A legacy that extends beyond Basketball



Basketball icon Dwyane Wade has never shied away from tough battles, but his latest opponent was one he never saw coming. The three-time NBA champion, known for his explosive plays and leadership on the court, recently revealed a personal health scare that left fans stunned. At just 41 years old, Wade was diagnosed with cancer, leading to a life-altering surgery that removed nearly half of his kidney.Since retiring from the NBA in 2019, Dwyane Wade has built a thriving post-basketball career, becoming a co-owner of the Utah Jazz and the WNBA ’s Chicago Sky while also making strides in television and podcasting. But despite his busy schedule, the former Miami Heat superstar knew something was off when he started experiencing unusual symptoms like abdominal discomfort and weak urine flow.Initially, Wade didn’t think much of it. However, given his father’s recent health struggles, he decided to get a full-body scan, a choice that would ultimately save his life. During a candid episode of his podcast, The Why with Dwyane Wade, he shared the moment doctors discovered a tumor in his right kidney, an outcome he never expected.“I didn’t go in for my kidneys, but because I did the full-body scan, they saw something,” Wade explained. The shocking revelation led to a crucial decision in December 2023, when surgery became the only option to determine whether the tumor was malignant. (via: Daily Express U.S.)For an athlete who built a career on resilience, Wade’s battle with cancer was a test of an entirely different kind. The surgery took a significant toll, not just physically, but emotionally.“I think it was the first time my family, my dad, my kids, they saw me weak,” Wade shared. “That moment was probably the weakest I’ve ever felt in my life. One thing you never want to do as a man? You never want your family to see you weak. ”As a father of five and husband to actress Gabrielle Union , Wade’s health scare was a stark reminder of how unpredictable life can be. It also underscored the importance of regular health screenings, a message he hopes to pass on to others.Wade’s impact on the game is undeniable—three NBA titles, a Finals MVP, 13 All-Star appearances but his story goes beyond basketball. His willingness to speak openly about his health battle adds another layer to his legacy, inspiring fans to prioritize their well-being.Also Read: JJ Redick takes the blame after Dalton Knecht’s scary fall complicates Lakers' vs. Nuggets As he continues his post-NBA journey, Wade remains a symbol of strength, proving that even legends face battles and sometimes, the most important victories happen off the court.","Three-time NBA champion Dwyane Wade recently revealed a personal health scare that left fans stunned.

NEW DELHI: With eight days to the start of IPL 2025 , the lineup for captains in the tournament was completed when Delhi Capitals announced star all-rounder and the men’s team’s longest-serving player Axar Patel as captain.Axar, 31, who had initially joined the Capitals in 2019, has played 82 matches across six seasons for the franchise where he took 62 wickets and scored 967 runs.Axar is a veteran of 150 IPL matches in which he scored 1653 runs and picked 123 wickets, including a hat-trick in 2016 when he took four wickets in five balls for Punjab.Pant, who had been DC's long-term captain, moved to Lucknow Super Giants after the Delhi franchise opted against retaining him. LSG acquired his services for Rs 27 crore during the auction and have gone on to appoint him as captain.Before Axar, Kolkata Knight Riders had named veteran Ajinkya Rahane as captain in what came as a surprise move considering the defending champions had splashed big on Venkatesh Iyer.One of the biggest appointments going into the IPL 2025 season is that of Rajat Patidar to try and lead Royal Challengers Bengaluru to their first IPL title. Patidar was one of the two contenders for the leadership role with ex-skipper Virat Kohli the other option. The franchise, however, went for the long-term vision by appointing the 31-year-old.Patidar, known for his solid batting, now shoulders the responsibility of leading RCB in their pursuit of IPL title. His appointment continues the rich legacy of leadership at the franchise, following in the footsteps of legends such as Rahul Dravid, Kevin Pietersen, Anil Kumble, Daniel Vettori, Virat Kohli, and Faf du Plessis.(TBA - To be announced)",IPL 2025 captains announced.

On the WPL and growth of the women’s game:

BENGALURU: Virat Kohli on Saturday made it clear that retirement is not on the immediate agenda but the star batter admitted he may not be around when India tour Australia next in four years’ time. In a tongue-in-cheek response to the possibility of coming out of retirement for the 2028 Olympics, the 36-year-old former India skipper, speaking at the RCB Innovation Lab’s Leadership Summit here on Saturday, quipped, “I just might sneak in for one game, if we are playing the gold-medal match!”Excerpts...I’m not playing for achievement. It pretty much comes down to just the pure joy, enjoyment and love for the game. And as long as that is intact, I’ll continue to play the game. I have to be honest about that with myself, because the competitive streak doesn’t allow you to find the answer. I had a very interesting conversation about this with Rahul Dravid when he was coach. He said you always have to stay in touch with yourself, figure out where you are placed in your life. And the answer is not that easy, because you might be going through a lean phase, and you (may) feel like this is it, but it might not be. When it is time, he said my competitive streak would not allow me to accept it. Maybe one more. You just have to pray and hope for clarity when it comes.The only thing that we as a team have tried to do is create an environment of fun and involvement. When you go to a practice session, you’re looking forward to being at the training ground with your friends. It doesn’t feel like a drag, it doesn’t feel like I have to get off the bus and go for another session. It’s like, when are we going to get together with the boys again? Because we have so much talent today. And I think it came out beautifully. The guys adapted well to what was in front of them. We ended up winning because we adapted to the conditions much better than the others.I’m happy about the inclusion. The amount of cricket has increased, so have the number of teams. Leagues are being played all over the world. The IPL has played a massive role in that as well. It’s a great opportunity for our guys. To be Olympic champions would be a magnificent feeling.I can’t pinpoint one lowest point. If you ask me the intensity of how disappointed I’ve been, for me the most recent Australia tour would be the one that’s most fresh, or for a long period of time the tour of England in 2014 was the thing that bothered me the most. But I can’t look at it that way. I might not have an Australia tour again in me in four years’ time. I don’t have the chance to correct it. So, you have to make peace with whatever’s happened in your life. How do I cope? It’s just about the acceptance.There was a time when I realized that I need to change the way I'm preparing as an athlete. Motivation was something that came from within. No one had to force me to do it. India had a couple of very difficult overseas tours. And I figured out that the reason that we were falling short is because the other team was physically way fitter than us. And they were able to hold their plans and skills in pressure situations for way longer periods than we could. And that’s what Test cricket is all about, who’s able to stay in the battle for longer periods of time.After I became captain, we started to bring in this kind of culture into the team as well. It eventually became a fabric that went into the culture of the Indian cricket.The perception (about women’s cricket) has changed massively. I think what the Indian women's cricket team has done over the last few years is that they are the ones who were the catalyst to kind of put the attention onto themselves. I literally saw it happening in a time span of 6-7 years. The way they started playing, you could see that belief and then people started engaging a lot more. And eventually it got to a place where commercials became better. Money was being infused into the women's game. And then you have the WPL. We have all seen the number of people that come and watch the games. And the standard of the games as well, be it power-hitting or skill levels and everything. This is what happens when you take a sport or even a part of a sport to that level of competition and equality.","Virat Kohli says he may not be around when India tour Australia next in four years’ time.

India win Champions Trophy title; Rohit Sharma confirms he's not retiring

Dinesh Karthik (C) spoke at the RCB Innovation Labs, Indian Sports Summit in Bengaluru.

Will Rohit Sharma win 2027 World Cup? Astrologer Lobo predicts after getting Champions Trophy bang on!

COUNTRY VS FRANCHISE TALENT IDENTIFICATION

Had India not won the Champions Trophy in Dubai, it is quite conceivable that Rohit Sharma ’s place at the helm of the Indian cricket team would have come under scrutiny. He was on a perilously slippery slope, having fared poorly with the bat in back-to-back series losses against New Zealand and Australia in red-ball cricket. Forget captaincy, his place in the side was questioned. And in Dubai, he faced criticism over his fitness.But success in the white-ball version has shone the spotlight on his leadership acumen. Former Indian wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik , who was part of the Indian team when they won the Champions Trophy in 2013, watched Rohit and his men’s successful journey from the commentary box recently. He believes Sharma’s leadership skills are second to none.Speaking at RCB Innovation Labs, Indian Sports Summit here on Friday, Karthik said: “In the past nine months, this Indian team has won two massive competitions (T20 World Cup and Champions Trophy). So, I think the sky's the limit for them because they are led by a very able leader in Rohit Sharma. You can see that he’s got the respect of his peers. Most importantly, he walks the walk and talks the talk with how cricket needs to be played.”Still, even with the best leadership, one needs a smattering of talent to go the distance in a multi-team event and the fact wasn’t lost on Karthik. “The beauty of this Indian team is the strength and depth that they have in terms of the number of players that they've got,” he said. “Not many countries today can say that they can field two or three teams in international cricket and have them competing with each other.”Did the IPL have a role in India’s near dominance of white-ball cricket? “India right now is in a very privileged and blessed place where they have such a good assortment of cricketers across skill sets. They could easily compete for the next decade or so considering the assembly line of players that the IPL and Indian domestic cricket are producing. The value in terms of understanding pressure, the big moments is what makes this Indian team really special,” said Karthik, who was in conversation with former England player and commentator Isha Guha and Mo Bobat , Royal Challengers Bengaluru ’s Director of Cricket.The 39-year-old gloveman went on to say: “In a lot of sporting environments, superpowers don’t go on to win tournaments. It’s always a challenge sometimes to just manage and assemble a group of players that produces results.”Once known as the T20 ‘razzmatazz’, Karthik believes the IPL, which turns 18 this year, has ensured a paradigm shift in perception and practice.“For a long time, Team India has been a cricketing nation which used to be happy competing, but now that attitude has changed. We want to win, and fans expect the team to win. That is what IPL has done. The influx of money has meant financial benefits that teams and stakeholders earn and a lot of it has gone back into infrastructure. When infrastructure grows, eventually the quality of sport develops and that’s the two biggest takeaways I think post the introduction of IPL in 2008,” said the current RCB batting coach and mentor.Karthik, who made his IPL debut for the erstwhile Delhi Daredevils, reflected on playing alongside Australian pace Glenn McGrath and the takeaways from it “For me the whole ideology of how Australia played at that time was a massive shock. They felt like a pack of wolves out to win every game. But with IPL, in my first year I got to spend time with Glenn McGrath in close quarters and practice with him. I got to know him better and became comfortable, that helped the confidence and mindset of competing with the best,” he said at the Padukone Dravid Centre of Excellence.Highlighting the difference between talent identification for a national team and a franchise, Bobat, who quit his role as performance director of the England men’s team to join RCB in 2023, stated, “In international cricket we often found that you were trying to really unpick and make sense to identify talent that was playing at a level beneath international cricket and making predictions about whether that talent could thrive at the level above. Coming over to RCB, firstly, it's an international market because you have overseas players. Understanding Indian talent is quite hard because of the volume and unstructured nature of it as well. So, finding talent in India is a much bigger challenge than it is finding it in the UK, but in a good way.”","Dinesh Karthik is the batting coach of the Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the IPL.

NEW DELHI: Brazilian football superstar Neymar has been ruled out of the upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Colombia and Argentina due to fitness concerns.The Brazilian Football Confederation announced this decision through a video statement by coach Dorival Júnior, who cited unspecified reasons for the exclusion of Neymar, goalkeeper Ederson, and defender Danilo from the squad.The 33-year-old striker, who recently rejoined his former club Santos in January, last played on March 2 but was substituted due to an apparent left thigh injury. As a precautionary measure, he was rested for the Sao Paulo state championship semifinal against Corinthians a few days later.Neymar's absence has paved the way for Real Madrid's promising young striker, Endrick, to be called up to the national team squad. Ederson's replacement is Lyon's Lucas Perri, while Flamengo defender Danilo has been replaced by his club teammate and Brazil veteran, Alex Sandro.Neymar's return to the national team setup this month marked a significant milestone, as he had been absent for almost 1 1/2 years due to an ACL injury sustained in October 2023 while playing for Brazil against Uruguay. His recent recovery and return to action had raised hopes for his participation in the upcoming qualifiers.Brazil, currently fifth in the South American qualifying standings, faces a crucial double-header, hosting Colombia on March 20 before traveling to Buenos Aires to take on the group leaders, Argentina, five days later.The absence of key players like Neymar, Ederson, and Danilo undoubtedly presents a challenge for the Brazilian team. However, it also provides an opportunity for emerging talents like Endrick and others to step up and showcase their abilities on the international stage.","Neymar has been ruled out of the upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Colombia and Argentina due to fitness concerns.

The Street Profits vs DIY

The first WWE SmackDown as part of their European tour was a remarkable night of excitement, huge moments and a surprising title change.WWE SmackDown was presented from the Olimpic Arena in Barcelona, Spain. This was the company’s first show as part of their European tour and was a night of explosive in-ring matches, some of the loudest fans in the world and top notch main event showdown which saw WWE titles changing hands.The match was made by SmackDown GM Nick Aldis following an altercation that involved all six men in the opening segment. Both sides competed in an explosive back and forth contest that had the fans in Spain on their feet. In the end, Braun Strowman delivered a huge splash and Powerslam on Tama Tonga to pick up the win for his team. However, the action did not stop there as both sides continued to brawl even after that.This was Charlotte Flair’s first match back on SmackDown for the first time since she got injured in 2023. The young upstart, B-Fab, put up a great effort against Flair, but it was not enough to put her down. Flair made her tap out to the Figure 8 and refused to let her go. This led to Tiffany Stratton coming to her aid and a brawl breaking out between them. Even when the Miz TV segment started, they came back outside to continue the brawl. It finally came to an end after Tiffany dived from the top of the entrance screen onto Flair and the security officials.The Miz dismissed fans singing along Cody Rhodes’ theme song with him. This led to Rhodes knocking him down with a punch. He then turned his attention to his WrestleMania 41 opponent, John Cena and told him that should he decides to grace him and the fans with his presence, he will be waiting in Brussels on RAW for him.A backstage altercation made the match official. Damian Priest and Shinsuke Nakamura put up an excellent match for the Spanish audience. A huge back-and-forth action saw Drew McIntyre appear ringside just as Priest was about to put away Nakamura. He avoided the distraction and countered Nakamura. But McIntyre interfered, causing disqualification, followed by a beatdown on Damian Priest by both McIntyre and Nakamura.The Spanish crowd loudly sang Randy Orton’s theme song as he came out and was in full support of The Viper. Carmelo Hayes displayed an excellent showing against the future WWE Hall of Famer. But a thunderous RKO outta nowhere sealed the win for Orton. However, Kevin Owens intervened after the match as Orton was about to inflict more damage on Hayes, and Owens himself narrowly escaped his wrath.Gunther insulted the Spanish audience and then brought his opponent for the night, Spain’s own and current one-half of the NXT tag team champions, Axiom. The masked superstar put up a great effort against Gunther, and both men delivered a captivating showdown for the loud Spanish fans. However, Axiom fell to the wrath of The Ring General as he delivered two Powerslams to seal the win and added insult to injury by locking in the sleeper hold on Axiom after his victory.Paul Heyman came out for an in-ring segment. He announced that it was Roman Reigns's day, marking the release of WWE 2K25 , whose cover star is The OTC. He dismissed all CM Punk chants and announced that Reigns would be on SmackDown in Bolonga, Italy, next week.The main event of the SmackDown in Barcelona saw The Street Profits challenging DIY for their WWE Tag Team Championships. The action was jam-packed and garnered loud reactions from the Spanish audience. It was an excellent display of classic tag team wrestling. Towards the final moments of the bout, Angelo Dawkins hit a Sky High on Johnny Gargano with Tomasso Ciampa being taken out already. Montez Ford followed it up with a huge Seven Star Frog Splash to cover him for the three count. With their win, The Street Profits were crowned the new WWE Tag Team Champions.Also Read: WWE 2K25 The Island Guide: How to start, Missions, Multiplayer Gameplay and More","WWE SmackDown was presented from the Olimpic Arena in Barcelona, Spain.

MUMBAI: Delhi Capitals did everything right on Saturday night until their batters once again faltered on the big stage, allowing Mumbai Indians to lift their second WPL title at the Brabourne Stadium on Saturday. DC won the toss, and their bowlers justified that decision by restricting Mumbai Indians to 149/7. However, their batting line-up, for the third consecutive final, failed to deliver.Once MI sensed victory, their bowlers forced DC to capitulate, guiding them to a thrilling eight-run win. Chasing a target that was below par on a pitch that improved as the match progressed, the DC batters failed to ignite their chase and cross the finish line.At 83 for six, MI were already dreaming of lifting the trophy, but Marizanne Kapp’s 26-ball 40 brought the equation within DC’s reach. However, Nat SciverBrunt (3/30) and Hayley Matthews, as they have done throughout this season, combined to send the South African back. Crammed for room, Kapp attempted to launch Sciver-Brunt over long-off but only found Matthews patrolling the boundary.Sciver-Brunt then cleaned up Shikha Pandey to bring MI to the verge of victory.Earlier, MI, backed by a vociferous crowd, started aggressively with the ball and dismissed DC’s top-three scorers this season by 6.2 overs with the score at 37. Meg Lanning was bowled by a SciverBrunt snorter, Shafali Verma was trapped leg-before by Shabnim Ismail (1/15), and Jess Jonassen top-edged an Amelia Kerr (2/25) delivery that was caught by keeper Yastika Bhatia.Ten balls later, Saika Ishaque (33/1) cleaned up Annabel Sutherland as DC were reduced to 44 for four. At the halfway mark, DC were 58 for four and still required 92 runs from 60 balls.DC’s innings couldn’t gain momentum as they lacked partnerships. Whenever someone tried, MI ensured they were dealt with quickly. Jemimah Rodrigues (30, 21b; 4x4), after settling down, was looking to break the shackles but top-edged a Kerr delivery while trying to manoeuvre it through the leg side, which was well caught by Kerr running forward.Earlier, Harmanpreet Kaur ’s 44-ball 66, with the help of nine fours and two sixes, and her 89-run stand for the third wicket with Sciver-Brunt (30, 28b; 4x4) ensured that MI got to a fighting score of 149-7.Sciver-Brunt and Harmanpreet joined forces in the fifth over and avoided undue risk to stabilise the MI innings and dug them out from the hole they found themselves in. Until the eighth over, MI had hit just two boundaries, but then Sciver-Brunt hit two in the ninth over delivered by Shree Charani.Sciver-Brunt took the back seat thereafter as Harmanpreet pressed on the accelerator to propel the MI scoring rate. DC’s decision to bowl was validated by their pacers as they bowled a tight line to keep the MI batters in check.Kapp was the first to sting MI as she bowled a miserly spell to finish with figures of 2/11 from four overs and dismissed Hayley Matthews and Yastika Bhatia. MI scored just 20 runs in the first six overs, which is their second-lowest in the powerplay in the tournament’s history after their 19- \run effort against the same opponents in the 2023 edition at the DY Patil Stadium.When it looked like MI would run away with the game thanks to the Harmanpreet and Sciver-Brunt partnership, they lost three wickets in the space of eight balls.",Mumbai Indians beat Delhi Capitals by eight runs to lift WPL title. DC bowled out MI for 149 in their 50 overs. MI's Nat Sciver-Brunt took 3/30 and Hayley Matthews took 2/30. DC lost three wickets in the space of eight balls.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119064796,imgsize-126086,width-400,resizemode-4/119064796.jpg"

When hockey was all about national pride and emotional investment

The early 1970s was hard on hockey lovers in India. In an era when anything less than an Olympic hockey gold was considered a failure, only bronze medals had come India’s way after Tokyo 1964. Even in World Cups, a top podium spot was elusive.In Barcelona 1971, when the first World Cup was hosted, India finished third while Pakistan lifted the trophy. Amsterdam 1973 was heartbreak central. India led 2-0 against Netherlands in the final before agonisingly going down on penalty strokes. India missed a penalty stroke during ‘sudden death.’ A conversion would have resulted in an instant triumph. But it was not to be.Nonetheless, 1975 brimmed with expectation.The Emergency was still a few months away. In captain Ajit Pal Singh, Ashok Kumar, Govinda, V Phillips, Surjit Singh and Michael Kindo, India had a first-rate unit. But were they better than Pakistan who had Akhtar Rasool, Samiullah, Islauddin and Saleem Sherwani in their ranks? That was the tantalising question.India started well, but not perfectly. Pakistan did. Both topped their groups. But unlike the neighbours, India suffered a loss. Argentina, the hockey equivalent to New Zealand in cricket, upset India 2-1. But the semifinal turned out to be a bigger test.Backed by a vociferous home crowd, Malaysia played sterling hockey and led India 2-1. Penalty corners were plentiful but regular taker, Surjit Singh, was having an off-day. In desperation, the reliable Kindo was substituted for a rookie 21-year-old defender from Bhopal.With just four minutes left for the hooter, India earned a penalty corner. What happened next is a moment engraved in every hockey lover’s memory. Aslam Sher Khan kissed the tabeez (amulet) given to him by his mother; his strike sending the match into extra-time. Harcharan Singh’s goal earned India a place in the final again.In the other semis, Pakistan looked unstoppable routing Germany 5-1.Those were radio days. Everyone experienced sports through the lens of the spoken word and imagination. Jasdev Singh, the doyen of Hindi sports commentary, was behind the mike. A few senior students brought transistor radios to school. Some of them cut classes to listen to the commentary. The noise they made told us India won the World Cup. Fittingly, hockey wizard Dhyanchand’s son, Ashok Kumar, scored the decider in a 2-1 win.In my mind’s archive, I always pictured Kumar dodging past the Pakistan defence and scoring the match-winner. Truth is, as I realized after watching the final on YouTube some years ago, it came off a goalmouth melee.Watching the match played on grass in Kuala Lumpur, I also realized how dramatically hockey has changed due to the introduction of astro-turf in the 1976 Montreal Olympic. I vividly remember the celebrations. Crackers were burst, but it wasn’t anything like nowadays.Nobody had that kind of money then. Yet a sense of pure joy was evident everywhere: schools, paan shops, streets, bus stops. It was the only point of conversation. With Indo-Pak cricket in hiatus, hockey was the game where national pride and collective emotions were invested. On that ‘Ides of March’ every hockey player also became a household name that sports lovers of a certain vintage can still reel off by memory.In the weeks that followed, popular magazines such as 'The Illustrated Weekly of India' and 'Dharmyug' carried cover stories of the triumph. Players received awards in various forms. For instance, the Punjab government gave them Rs 5,000 each. The UP government gave each member a Vijay scooter. Amounts and awards that tell you something about the times.Sadly, India never stood on the hockey World Cup podium thereafter. The 1980 Moscow Olympics gold too came against a vastly truncated field. Caught napping by astro-turf, it would be decades before the nation would become a force in hockey again. Now hope floats with two consecutive Olympic bronze medals won in Tokyo 2020 and Paris 2024. But the nation awaits the golden glow.","Hockey was the game where national pride and collective emotions were invested. With Indo-Pak cricket in hiatus, hockey was the only point of conversation.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Will Rohit Sharma win 2027 World Cup? Astrologer Lobo predicts after getting Champions Trophy bang on!

NEW DELHI: Former India batter VVS Laxman took to social media on Saturday to reminisce about one of the most unforgettable moments in Indian cricket history — the epic 2001 Kolkata Test victory against Australia. As the iconic win turned 24 this year, Laxman shared an emotional post on the platform X, calling it ""a victory to cherish for a lifetime.""Reflecting on the historic triumph, Laxman wrote: ""24 years ago, a victory to cherish for a lifetime, an amazing team effort and a great life example of never ever giving up, how much ever impossible it may seem now. An absolute privilege to have been a part and to contribute in this very special win.""The 2001 Kolkata Test at Eden Gardens is considered one of the greatest comebacks in Test cricket history. Down 0-1 in the three-Test series, India found themselves in dire straits after being bowled out for 171 in response to Australia’s first-innings total of 445. Forced to follow on, India appeared to be heading for a crushing defeat.However, what followed was nothing short of a miracle. Promoted to No. 3 in the second innings, Laxman crafted a monumental 281, the highest individual score by an Indian at the time, turning the game on its head. Teaming up with Rahul Dravid (180), the duo stitched a record-breaking 376-run partnership for the fifth wicket, batting the entire fourth day without losing a single wicket.India eventually declared at 657/7, setting Australia a daunting target of 384 runs. Harbhajan Singh , who had taken 7/123 in the first innings — including the first-ever Test hat-trick by an Indian — struck again with figures of 6/73, bowling out the Aussies for 212 and sealing a sensational 171-run victory for India.The victory remains etched in cricketing folklore as a testament to resilience and never giving up, even in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. The win not only ended Australia’s 16-match winning streak but also marked a turning point for Indian cricket under the leadership of Sourav Ganguly .","Former India batter VVS Laxman took to social media on Saturday to reminisce about the epic 2001 Kolkata Test victory against Australia.

Excerpts:

How should Bumrah be managed, given he has had his share of injuries?

How invaluable is Bumrah to India’s scheme of things?

Was Bumrah’s performance in Australia the best by a visiting bowler?

What do you make of India’s Champions Trophy triumph?

Did India have an unfair edge in the CT?

How do you look at India’s white-ball dominance? Can it be extended?

How can India become a bigger force in the longest format?

CHENNAI: Legendary Australia fast bowler Glenn McGrath has backed Jasprit Bumrah to make a strong comeback from his back injury, saying that the premier India pacer has to be “smart” about it as he is no longer young. Bumrah missed the Champions Trophy with a lower-back issue and is likely to be unavailable for the first few weeks of the IPL season . McGrath, the director of the MRF Pace Foundation here, also praised India for making the best use of the conditions during their CT triumph and asserted that they did not have an unfair advantage although they played all their matches at one venue.He puts more stress on his body than the other bowlers. He has found ways to manage it, but unfortunately not all the time. He has done it before (making a comeback from injury), he will know better than anyone (about) the recovery time, the time in the gym. He is not as young as he used to be, so he has to be smarter about what he does.He has to work even harder off the field. Being a fast bowler is like driving a car. If you do not top it up with fuel, you are going to run out of fuel sooner or later. My fuel tank was bigger than Jasprit’s because I did not bowl as quickly as him. These guys know how they work at their best. If India are under the pump, they need him.He is an experienced fast bowler and is one of the best in the world. He is unique. I take keen interest in Jasprit and the way he goes. The recent Australia-India Test series showed how important he is to India. If you take Bumrah out of that series, it could have been very one-sided. If he had been fit enough to bowl in the second innings of the last Test (Sydney), you never know. To play five Tests in a row is a massive ask and you have to look after him.The stats say that. Without a doubt, he was unplayable sometimes. It looked like he would get a wicket every over. I would not have minded playing on those pitches.They were the team to beat and they played well. Virat Kohli came back to form, as did the other guys. Australia had their chances in the semifinal, obviously we had a few of our bowlers who were out. The pitches took spin and India played well.It is the way it is. India does not travel to Pakistan anymore. There was only one other thing — the matches had to be played in Dubai. You have to give credit to India, they played to the conditions. They know how to play on spinning tracks. I do not think that they had an unfair advantage. It is like saying there is an unfair advantage if India play all their matches in India, if Australia play all their matches in Australia.Their IPL and T20 cricket has had a positive impact on one-day cricket. India are confident and they know their game well. It is important to protect Test cricket, but ODIs and World Cups are very important as well. India know the ODI game very well. It is a challenge for other teams to come over to India and play well. I like them to be challenged, but India are a quality team.They have quality players, there is no doubt about it. Test cricket needs India to be strong. They have got the batting lineup and the bowlers. They just need to make sure that their second-tier bowlers, who bowl around Bumrah, have the quality.",Glenn McGrath backs Jasprit Bumrah to make a strong comeback from back injury.

India win Champions Trophy title; Rohit Sharma confirms he's not retiring

'Not going anywhere': Rohit Sharma on retirement from ODIs after winning the Champions Trophy

Pakistan cricket has experienced significant turmoil in recent years with frequent changes in leadership, management, coaches, and selectors showing no improvement. These constant changes have negatively impacted many careers, including that of Babar Azam , one of Pakistan's most talented cricketers.Babar's performance has declined significantly, and he has been removed from captaincy positions twice. His recent performance in the Champions Trophy drew criticism from various former cricket players.Former Pakistani spinner Saeed Ajmal has defended Babar Azam against criticism from former cricketers.""Aapke paas ek hi toh star hai. If you degrade him also, then how will your cricket run? These are the big issues. Our former cricketers should keep their mouths shut,"" told Sportstar.""As a cricketer, one must realise that bad patches are part of a player's career. You can't play cricket the same way all your life. Even if you were Sachin Tendulkar, you couldn't score 100 runs in every match.""Following Pakistan's poor performance in the Champions Trophy, the board made immediate changes. Mohammad Rizwan was removed as T20I captain, and both he and Babar Azam were dropped from the team.""Look, the way you've removed them is wrong. It's not like they are the only ones who haven't scored while others have. That's not the case. Ideally, the selectors should sit down with Babar and discuss rest so that he can come back stronger.""""Babar and Rizwan are great players. Their stats are as good as anyone's, but the only difference is that they don't bat aggressively, but they still score runs. Our guys have suddenly realised that in international cricket, everyone plays aggressively.""""Come on, what aggression are we talking about? If they are your proven match-winners, you don't need aggression. Even legends like Virat often pace their innings slowly before attacking, that's his style.""","Former Pakistani spinner Saeed Ajmal has defended Babar Azam against criticism from former cricketers.

BENGALURU: The first two months of the 2025 tennis season has been all uphill for Sumit Nagal , starting in Melbourne in January and then on clay in Rosario and Buenos Aires, laid low by a flu.The 27-year-old will make a return to tournament play in the ATP Challenger in Murcia next week after staying away from the Tour for about a month.Nagal, whose ranking is down to 132, was thrown a curveball by what he suspects was a bout of Covid-19 in January. The Indian, who chose the rigour of the South American swing over the four-week ATP Challenger series in India in February, was caught unawares in Argentina.“If I knew I was (so) unwell I would never have gone to South America,” Nagal told TOI during a telephone interview. “You’re going so far away, not feeling your best, that makes no sense.”Nagal, who has spent the last few weeks at his training base in Germany, is gradually working his way back.“I never really felt good since Australia, it was maybe Covid-19 over there, I wasn’t sure,” the India No.1 said. “When I was in Argentina I was practicing a bit and then I wasn’t really practicing. It wasn’t a great few weeks for me. I was struggling so much with my health, I was fatigued, I was barely practicing. And when I practiced or played I would feel super tired.”“It has been good in the last two weeks. I have been practicing quite a bit, pushing a bit,” said Nagal, who marked his fitness at eight on a scale of 1 to 10.Nagal, who climbed to a career-high No.68 in the ranking last July, is now chasing a main draw berth at Roland Garros. He’s scheduled to play two ATP Challengers, followed by Monte Carlo Masters 1000, where he went through qualifiers last year to make the round of 32, after which the Indian will look at 250 Series tournaments.While there are nine Indians in the top-150 of the doubles rankings, Nagal is the only Indian in the top-250 of the singles rankings on the men’s and women’s tours.","Sumit Nagal will make a return to tournament play in the ATP Challenger in Murcia next week.

MUMBAI: ""Form goes up and down,” says Nat Sciver-Brunt , so she wants to make the most of it as the “feeling when you are not so confident isn’t that nice.”It’s a captain’s delight to have someone like the England allrounder on the roster. The 32-year-old has unlocked her beast mode for Mumbai Indians this season, topping the Orange Cap list with 493 runs in nine games at an average of 70.42, with the help of five fifties. She already became the first player to score 400-plus runs in WPL history and is just seven runs short of crossing the 500-run mark in a season. She also has nine scalps in her kitty, putting her in the driver’s seat to take the Player of the Tournament award.She also played a stellar role in MI’s title run in the inaugural edition in 2023, scoring 332 runs and taking 10 wickets.A trait of top players is that they always find a way to improve their game consistently, and Sciver-Brunt is among those. During this campaign, she has impressed with her ability to score at a brisk rate through the middle overs. Her career strike rate in T20Is is 118.12, while in WPL it is 143.24, but in this edition, her strike rate stands at 156.50.Other MI batters have benefited from it, as well as her calm approach while batting, which has given the likes of Hayley Matthews and Harmanpreet Kaur the time to build their innings.Sciver-Brunt stressed that she didn’t try anything different in the lead-up to the tournament. “I haven’t done anything different in terms of my preparation or how I go about my innings. I have stuck to my strengths quite a lot and have played what is in front of me,” she said.Besides scoring briskly, what has made her more dangerous is her ability to score all around the park. Fuller lengths have been dispatched down the ground or through the covers, while anything slightly wide or short has been sent to the boundary with ferocity.Sciver-Brunt and Matthews have developed a nice understanding between them, which has seen them stitch match winning partnerships for MI. Like the 71-ball 133-run association against Gujarat Giants in the eliminator on Thursday, which was also their second 100-plus stand of the season. They also put on a 133-run association against UP Warriorz (UPW), besides two 50-plus stands—92 and 57 against UPW and Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB), respectively. She has also taken on the lead role while mentoring the West Indian, who at times has found it difficult to construct her innings.“Apart from this tournament, I haven’t really batted with Hayley, but we seemed to click well from the first year. (Against Giants) she wanted to go off after a quicker start, but it was good she stayed out there and didn’t give her wicket away. I was just reassuring her that you only need to time the ball, you don’t need to whack it,” reasoned Sciver-Brunt.","Nat Sciver-Brunt has scored 493 runs in nine games for Mumbai Indians.

A day after dethroning reigning champion Jonatan Christie , Lakshya Sen faltered against Li Shi Feng of China 10-21, 16-21 in the men’s singles quarterfinals of the All England Championships in Birmingham on Friday.Soon after, the Indian challenge ended as the women’s doubles pair of Treesa Jolly and Gayatri Gopichand lost to Chinese second seeds Liu Sheng Shu and Tan Ning 14-21, 10-21.Given his 7-4 win-loss record and having won the last two matches against Li last year, Lakshya was expected to fare well in the quarterfinals. But the Indian was a pale shadow of the shuttler on show against Christie.From 4-4, Li widened the gap. He scored eight points on the trot and Lakshya was out of the first game even before he had warmed up.Emboldened by the easy victory in the first game, Li started on an aggressive note while Lakshya crawled his way back. With good netplay and by pushing the shuttle to the corners with good effect, Lakshya secured a crucial three-point lead (11-8) at the halfway stage.

Champions Return: Rohit, Hardik, Shreyas, Gambhir return after India's title triumph

NEW DELHI: Retired Test opener David Warner has cast doubt on whether England’s high-octane "" Bazball "" approach will hold up on Australian soil, insisting it’s a risky tactic against the conditions Down Under.“I don’t know if 'Bazball' is a myth now, but I can’t see it happening in Australia,” the 38-year-old told reporters this week, as quoted by Fox Sports.Warner, who called time on his international career last year, had a front-row seat to England’s aggressive style during the 2023 Ashes . While the approach earned praise for its entertainment value, he believes the fast-paced batting might falter on bouncier Australian pitches .“With the bounce and everything, the fields Australia set last time in England, it would be pretty high risk to play that in Australia,” he said.“It’s probably not the way to go about it. If that is the way they go … it’s going to be high tempo, high energy and we’ll all get a couple of days off at the back end.”England’s ""Bazball"" era, led by Test captain Ben Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum , has seen mixed results since kicking off three years ago. The team surged to a dominant home summer in 2022, then made headlines with a record-breaking 3-0 whitewash in Pakistan.However, their fortunes turned in 2023. England failed to retain the Ashes on home soil and later slumped to a 4-1 series loss in India, reigniting doubts about the long-term sustainability of the ""Bazball"" strategy in varied conditions.Meanwhile, Warner is gearing up for a new challenge. Earlier this week, he was picked up by the London Spirit for AU$245,000 in The Hundred Draft . He’ll reunite with former Australian coach Justin Langer as the 100-ball tournament kicks off in August.Warner’s home ground will be Lord’s—where tensions famously boiled over during the 2023 Ashes, as he and his teammates clashed with MCC members in the Long Room. Asked about the reception he expects from Spirit fans, Warner was candid.“We’ll just have to wait until I step foot on that park first, won’t we? Then we’ll see how the reception is,” he said.“I’ll have to walk past the Long Room first to get to the changing room! I actually want them to come at Australians. I love that stuff, that’s what gets me going but I want them to support London Spirit.ALSO SEE: Why all 50 Pakistan cricketers went unpicked in The Hundred Draft “If they want to boo me, boo me, but don’t boo the team. We’re not there playing for the Australian cricket team so they can cheer a little bit for myself but most importantly cheer for the team.“I’m really looking forward to it, I know how English crowds are and it excites me.”",David Warner doubts England's 'Bazball' approach will hold up on Australian soil.
