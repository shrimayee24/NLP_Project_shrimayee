Why Virat Kohli in India XI for World Cup 2027 will be bad news | Greenstone Lobo predicts

NEW DELHI: Opener Rohit Sharma struck an unbeaten century, Virat Kohli made a fighting half-century, and pacer Harshit Rana grabbed four wickets as India defeated Australia by nine wickets in the third and final ODI on Saturday, though they lost the series 1-2.Rana’s brilliant spell of 4/39 helped bowl Australia out for 236 in 46.4 overs, setting the stage for a dominant Indian chase. Rohit then led the way with an unbeaten 121 off 125 balls. He first shared a crucial 69-run opening partnership with Shubman Gill (24) before joining forces with Kohli (74* off 81 balls) for an unbroken 168-run stand, guiding India to the target in 38.3 overs.After reaching his half-century, Kohli initially forgot to acknowledge the crowd or celebrate, until Rohit signaled him to mark the milestone.Watch the video here During the innings, Kohli also broke another record, becoming the second-highest run-getter in ODI cricket. The No.3 batter, famously known as the 'Chase Master,' overcame subdued form in the first two ODIs to register his 75th ODI fifty and surpass 2,500 runs against Australia in the format.Kohli also surpassed Sri Lankan great Kumar Sangakkara’s tally of 14,234 runs (in 404 ODIs) in his 293rd ODI innings. The former India captain now sits just behind legendary Sachin Tendulkar , who leads with 18,426 runs. Impressively, Kohli maintains a superior average of 57.69 across 305 ODIs, compared to Tendulkar’s 44.83 in 463 matches.With his career nearing its end in ODIs, Kohli is set to finish as the second-highest run-getter behind his idol, Tendulkar.In the match, Kohli’s unbeaten 74, including seven fours, and Rohit’s 33rd ODI ton — which was also his 50th international century — powered India to a nine-wicket victory at the Sydney Cricket Ground, even as Australia secured the series 2-1. Rohit was named both Player of the Match and Player of the Series for scoring 202 runs across three games.The two sides will now clash in a five-match T20I series, beginning October 29.","India defeated Australia by nine wickets in the third and final ODI on Saturday.

Josh Giddey faces uncertain setback as Chicago Bulls’ strong start hits a sudden pause

Josh Giddey seals major deal as Chicago Bulls set sights on a bold new era

With dominant victories over the Detroit Pistons and the Orlando Magic, the Chicago Bulls had a successful start to the 2025-26 season. Coby White is yet to play his season opener for the Bulls. However, amidst all of this, Josh Giddey's name was included on the Bulls' official injury report. He has an MCP sprain on his right finger, which makes him questionable going into Monday's game against the Atlanta Hawks. Josh Giddey and the Chicago Bulls started the 2025-26 season on a high note. However, Giddey, who signed a four-year, $100 million deal last offseason, is facing uncertainty. Chicago's return to work on Monday appears to raise questions about the $100 million man's future.Early in his career, he was famous for being able to score plays and snatch rebounds, but he also had problems on the defensive end and was often targeted in big games. However, he had a terrific start to the new season. Nevertheless, his streak ended as he was included in the Bulls ' official injury report.Due to a fourth MCP (Metacarpophalangeal) sprain in his right finger, Giddey is labelled as QUESTIONABLE on the NBA's official injury report for the game. However, it is still ""unclear"" whether Giddey's absence during the last 4:27 against the Orlando Magic was caused by the injury or by Tre Jones and Ayo Dosunmu playing well, according to CHSN reporter K.C. Johnson.Kevin Huerter would probably play more for the Bulls if Giddey is unavailable. He joined the Bulls for the second season after joining the Oklahoma City Thunder. After spending his first three years in Oklahoma City, Giddey is currently in his fifth NBA season.His absence would just increase White's pressure to spearhead the attack if he were well. However, the fact that both players might miss Monday's game against the Hawks drastically alters the scenario.Josh Giddey recently joined the Bulls. They have come to a four-year, $100 million contract agreement. This was settled in September 2025, which assured him of being the team's starting point guard and primary player in the future. There are no player or team options on the contract, which is fully guaranteed.Over the offseason, Giddey was sure of his place on the Chicago Bulls. He was planning on remaining with the team for many years to come. During an interview, he said:""I never had any worries I wouldn't be here.. This is where I wanted to be. They embraced me from Day 1. Teammates, front office, the fans — it felt like home really quickly.""Giddey broke a tons of records. This includes historic single-game achievements, like becoming the first NBA player to ever achieve 15 points, 10 rebounds, 17 assists, and 8 steals in a single game.Additionally, he was the sole NBA guard to have a couple of games with 25 points and more and 15 rebounds. He was also one of the two players with at least 20 points, 15 rebounds, and 10 assists in the last season.Also read: Jonathan Kuminga’s contract uncertainty grows as Josh Giddey secures $100 million deal with Chicago Bulls","Josh Giddey's name was included on the Bulls' official injury report.

When will Pat Surtain return? Denver Broncos fears extended absence for top defender after pec strain diagnosis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/when-will-pat-surtain-return-denver-broncos-fears-extended-absence-for-top-defender-after-pec-strain-diagnosis/articleshow/124861096.cms,"Denver Broncos' playoff aspirations face a major setback. Star cornerback Pat Surtain II has suffered a pectoral injury. He is expected to be sidelined for four to six weeks. This absence comes at a critical juncture for the Broncos. The team faces tough opponents in the coming weeks. Surtain's recovery is now a key focus for Denver's season.

Short-term IR remains on the table as Denver prepares for worst-case stretch



Next man up mentality brings major pressure to Broncos secondary



The Denver Broncos’ playoff hopes just hit a nerve. Pat Surtain II, the reigning Defensive Player of the Year and the heartbeat of Denver’s secondary, is now expected to miss significant time after suffering a pectoral injury in Sunday’s clash with the Dallas Cowboys. The moment looked innocent enough, a routine tackle attempt on wideout George Pickens right before halftime. But concerns escalated quickly after Surtain did not return and was initially ruled out with what the team called a shoulder issue.Now, multiple insiders are reporting that Denver may have to brace for life without their top defensive weapon.NFL insider Jordan Schultz revealed that Surtain is expected to miss 4-6 weeks, though surgery will not be required. He’ll seek a second medical opinion before locking in an official recovery timeline, but the Broncos are already weighing roster moves.NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport labeled him “week-to-week” and confirmed he could land on short-term injured reserve, a move echoed by ESPN’s Adam Schefter. Should Denver make that decision, Surtain would be forced to sit out a minimum of four games.The timing? Brutal.Denver is about to enter a critical stretch against the Houston Texans, Las Vegas Raiders, and Kansas City Chiefs, followed by a Week 12 bye.Best-case scenario: Surtain returns Week 13 when the Broncos travel to face the Washington Commanders. Worst-case: Denver’s defense must battle through its toughest tests while missing the NFL’s ultimate lockdown corner.Before exiting Sunday’s game, Surtain had logged five tackles and a pass breakup. On the season, he has already stacked 27 tackles and nine PBUs through eight games, looking every bit the award-winning star he proved to be in 2024.Without PS2 patrolling the sidelines, the job shifts to Kris Abrams-Draine opposite Riley Moss, while Jahdae Barron may also see increased opportunities. Ja'Quan McMillian will hold down the slot in a unit now tasked with containing explosive AFC offenses.Surtain’s recovery now becomes one of the biggest storylines in Denver’s season. The Broncos need him healthy for a playoff run. For now, fans wait, coaches adjust, and opponents suddenly sense an opening in the Mile High sky.Also Read: Packers and Steelers revive iconic looks as retro uniforms headline Sunday Night Football","Denver Broncos cornerback Pat Surtain II suffered a pectoral injury in Sunday's game against the Dallas Cowboys.

The Market Implications

Theare once again at the center of MLB’s offseason drama, as trade rumors swirl around. With the Winter Meetings approaching, industry insiders believe the Dodgers could make a historic move to acquire the left-handed phenom, potentially forming one of the most dominant rotations in baseball alongside Blake Snell and Shohei Ohtani Skubal’s name has quickly become the hottest topic of the offseason. The Detroit Tigers have long viewed him as their franchise pitcher, but uncertainty over his contract future has created a massive trade buzz. The 27-year-old southpaw, who could command an unprecedented $400 million deal, is represented by agent Scott Boras - making negotiations even more complicated.Detroit’s front office has reportedly tried to negotiate an extension, but the gap between the two sides appears insurmountable. According to Jon Heyman of the New York Post, “The Tigers and superstar pitcher Tarik Skubal have a lot of work to do if they’re going to bridge quite possibly the biggest gap in MLB negotiating history: an estimated quarter of a billion dollars. Yep, that’s not a misprint. It’s close to $250 million. ” (H/t: Sporting News)Jim Costa of 97.1 The Ticket highlighted the current state of negotiations, writing, “Two things I believe to be true.1. Scott Boras and Tarik Skubal want to hit free agency a year from now. No extension this offseason. 2. The Tigers are not going all in to win with Skubal in 2026.”This sentiment reflects Detroit’s hesitancy to commit long-term money while still rebuilding its roster. With Skubal likely eyeing the open market, trading him now could allow the Tigers to capitalize on his peak value.Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Dodgers are in prime position to pounce. After adding two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani and 2023 NL Cy Young winner Blake Snell, Los Angeles could solidify one of the most overpowering rotations in baseball history by acquiring Skubal.If the Los Angeles Dodgers pull off this deal, their starting pitching depth could be unmatched. Here’s what their projected rotation might resemble:Such a lineup would give Los Angeles perhaps the best rotation ever assembled, blending youth, experience, and generational talent.Veteran MLB insider Jim Bowden of The Athletic believes the Dodgers could realistically make the move, citing both financial capability and competitive urgency. “Skubal will reset the market for pitchers and become the highest-paid starting pitcher in history, with a realistic starting price north of $400 million. Therefore, even though the Tigers are in position to compete for the postseason next year, it’s likely they shop Skubal at the Winter Meetings and try to make the best trade they can,” Bowden wrote.If a deal happens, it could reshape not only the Los Angeles Dodgers’ future but also the free-agent pitching market. A $400 million valuation would surpass any previous pitching contract in MLB history, setting a new benchmark for elite arms.Potential teams like the Yankees, Rangers, and Giants may show interest, but few can match the Los Angeles Dodgers’ mix of prospect depth, payroll flexibility, and championship urgency.Los Angeles has never shied away from bold moves, and this offseason is proving no different. Pairing Tarik Skubal with Blake Snell and Shohei Ohtani could make the Los Angeles Dodgers nearly untouchable in the National League.Also read: MLB trade rumors: New York Yankees predicted to sign to $68 million 6x NPB All-Star to replace Cody Bellinget Their batting order, already one of the most feared in baseball, would have the perfect complement - arguably the strongest starting rotation ever assembled.","Detroit Tigers ace Tarik Skubal's contract future has created a massive trade buzz.

Kareem Hunt injury update : Chiefs get a major boost ahead of MNF



Chiefs aim to close AFC West gap with a must-win performance



The Kansas City Chiefs enter Monday Night Football with their eyes set on extending their winning streak, but the challenge ahead is anything but simple. With the Washington Commanders arriving at Arrowhead Stadium, the matchup promises high stakes, intensity, and a playoff-like atmosphere. Patrick Mahomes and running back Kareem Hunt will look to set the tone early, aiming to keep Kansas City’s dominance alive in front of their home crowd.Head coach Andy Reid received a timely boost this week as Kareem Hunt was cleared to play after battling a knee issue. Hunt’s status had been a point of concern for the Chiefs, especially at such a crucial stage of the season. The veteran back had been managing a bone bruise in his knee and an ankle problem after being rolled up in the last game.Now, after a full return to practice, Hunt is ready for action. According to reporter Pete Sweeney on his official X account (formerly Twitter), “Hunt practiced normally on Saturday alongside the rest of the team,” a clear sign that he feels healthy and prepared to take the field.This update comes as a major relief for Kansas City’s coaching staff. With Hunt available, the Chiefs’ offense gains back one of its most reliable short-yardage and red-zone weapons.Through seven games this season, Hunt has recorded 53 carries for 205 yards (3.9 YPC) and three touchdowns, showcasing his knack for finishing drives and complementing Mahomes’ aerial attack.As the Chiefs prepare for a crucial stretch of the season, Hunt’s return adds depth and balance to their offensive scheme. His physical running style and experience give Kansas City the versatility it needs to handle high-pressure moments under the primetime lights.Heading into Week 8, the Chiefs (4-3) are in desperate need of a statement victory to stay in striking distance of the AFC West-leading Denver Broncos (6-2). A loss on Monday night would widen the gap to two full games, putting additional pressure on Mahomes and the team as the playoff picture starts to take shape.With a national audience tuning in, the Chiefs know what’s at stake. Mahomes, Hunt, and the offense must deliver early momentum, while the defense holds firm against a scrappy Commanders squad. For Kansas City, this isn’t just another game—it’s a defining moment to keep their championship aspirations alive and prove that the road to the AFC crown still runs through Arrowhead.Also Read: Aaron Rodgers gushes about ‘special’ relationships but stays silent on wife Brittani and she still remains a secret","Kareem Hunt is cleared to play for the Kansas City Chiefs against the Washington Commanders on Monday Night Football.

Ryan Kesler pleads not guilty as legal process begins to unfold

From Olympic podiums to court proceedings: a dramatic turn for the former center

Former NHL center Ryan Kesler is back in the spotlight, but this time it is far from the arena lights that once celebrated his two-way dominance. The 41-year-old, who built a career battling top forwards and representing Team USA on the Olympic stage, is now battling misdemeanor charges in a Michigan courtroom.According to court filings, Ryan Kesler has been charged with two counts of fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct related to alleged events that took place on January 1. He appeared in a Bloomfield Hills courtroom on Monday, where he formally entered a not guilty plea. After being booked and posting a $50,000 bond, he was released while the case moved forward. A probable cause conference is currently scheduled for November 6.Police in Orchard Lake confirmed the arraignment but declined to release further details, leaving many unanswered questions surrounding the accusations.Kesler’s attorney, Robert Morad, issued a strong statement to The Athletic, saying, “Ryan emphatically denies the allegations and is completely innocent of the charges. The charges are baseless and he is prepared to fight them vigorously in court.” Morad added, “As the legal process begins, we ask for respect for his privacy and for the integrity of the judicial system.We are confident, when all the facts and circumstances are presented, that he will be fully exonerated. ”Kesler spent 15 years in the NHL, starring for the Vancouver Canucks and later the Anaheim Ducks before injuries led to his retirement in 2019. Fans remember him as a fierce competitor, a Selke Trophy winner, and a central figure in Vancouver’s run to the 2011 Stanley Cup Final. He also served as a key member of the U.S. men’s Olympic teams in 2010 and 2014, earning a silver medal in Vancouver.Now, instead of highlighting reels and accolades, his career legacy hangs in the balance of a legal battle still in its earliest stages. As the NHL community watches closely, the next chapter of Ryan Kesler’s life will be written not on the ice, but inside a courtroom.Also Read: “Embarrassing for McDavid”: Fans lose their minds as Ryan Reaves outscoring Connor McDavid becomes early-season reality","Ryan Kesler charged with two counts of fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct.

Zion Williamson ruled out minutes before tip-off against the Boston Celtics

Zion Williamson opened the new season looking sharper, stronger, and more dominant than ever

The New Orleans Pelicans' star forward, Zion Williamson, was out for his team's game against the Boston Celtics because of a left foot bone bruise. This was the first absence for the 25-year-old power forward in the 2025-26 NBA season, where he had been a strong presence in the Pelicans' early games. The injury came as a surprise, increasing the early-season anxiety for a Pelicans team already dealing with a 0-2 record.Williamson wasn't able to play due to a bone bruise in his left foot, which leads to pain and swelling in the bone without any fractures. The Pelicans listed him as questionable on their injury report earlier on October 28, but they decided to rule him out about 90 minutes before the game at the Smoothie King Center in New Orleans.During a pre-game media availability, head coach Willie Green discussed the timeline with reporters, “It’s something that kind of popped up this morning. It didn’t seem like it was too serious. But I’m not sure.”Green elaborated on the issue's background to the media, mentioning that he thought the injury happened during the Pelicans' overtime defeat against the San Antonio Spurs. Williamson played a season-high of 36 minutes and 59 seconds in that 128-125 loss, racking up 27 points, 10 rebounds, seven assists, and three steals despite the intense pace.There were no earlier symptoms noted during the game, and Green assured reporters, “Not that I know of,” when asked if Williamson had shown signs of discomfort on the court.NBA insider Brett Siegel of ClutchPoints provided an update via X shortly before the game, posting, “Zion Williamson is dealing with a left foot bone contusion and is currently listed as questionable to play tonight for the Pelicans against the Celtics. This is a new injury for Williamson.” Siegel later confirmed the final status in a follow-up, stating directly, “Zion Williamson is OUT tonight for the Pelicans,” in reference to the Celtics contest.Prior to getting injured, Zion Williamson was showing one of the most productive and flexible performances of his career. In the first two games for the Pelicans with a 118-105 loss to the Memphis Grizzlies on October 23 and the previously mentioned loss to the Spurs where he averaged 27 points, 9.5 rebounds, six assists, and four steals per game, playing around 35.2 minutes on average. His four steals per game put him in a tie with Chicago Bulls guard Tre Jones for the NBA lead at that early stage.In the opening match against Memphis, Williamson scored 27 points, shooting a solid 11-of-15. He also grabbed nine rebounds, dished out five assists, and made five steals in only 33 minutes.A couple of nights later, while up against San Antonio Spurs, he matched his scoring from before but had a way more balanced stat line, showing off his improved playmaking and defense. This amazing stretch comes from a summer spent getting in shape, where Williamson reportedly shed some pounds and worked on his durability to tackle his past issues.A little injury feels way worse when it’s related to Zion Williamson. His strong performance in the first few games showed a boost in confidence that the Pelicans desperately required. But missing games this early is a real test for both the player and the organization. The team has to find a way to balance their need for quick wins with the long-term care of their star player.Also Read: Giannis Antetokounmpo just did what players like Michael Jordan and LeBron James couldn’t do","The New Orleans Pelicans' star forward, Zion Williamson, was out for his team's game against the Boston Celtics because of a left foot bone bruise.

Marcus Mariota and Kiyomi Cook’s enduring bond



When it comes to Washington Commanders quarterback Marcus Mariota, the conversation often centers on his athletic journey — from his days as Oregon’s Heisman Trophy winner to his steady NFL career. Yet, beyond the football field, Mariota’s life tells a more personal and grounded story, one deeply connected to his longtime partner and now wife, Kiyomi Cook. Their relationship, which began in college, offers fans a glimpse into the man behind the helmet — humble, family-oriented, and purpose-driven.Marcus Mariota’s wife, Kiyomi Cook, isn’t just known for being married to the NFL star — she’s built an impressive identity of her own. Born in 1993 and raised in Gresham, Oregon, Cook grew up in a family that valued both academics and sports. A standout soccer player at Sam Barlow High School, she earned all-state and all-conference honors in 2008, according to her Oregon Ducks Soccer profile.She later attended the University of Oregon, where she majored in human physiology and psychology while playing midfield for the Ducks’ women’s soccer team.After college, Cook pursued a master’s degree in exercise and nutrition science from Lipscomb University in Nashville — a reflection of her lifelong passion for health and athletics.Her coaching career began soon after graduation. As per her LinkedIn profile, Cook worked as a soccer coach at the University School of Nashville and Father Ryan High School between 2015 and 2020. Her dedication to mentoring young athletes showed her commitment to the next generation, just as Mariota’s foundation, Motiv8, aims to uplift youth through sports and education.Mariota and Cook’s story started back in 2014 when both were student-athletes at the University of Oregon. Their friendship evolved into a romance that stood strong through the challenges of Mariota’s transition to the NFL. The couple went public in 2015 when they attended Mariota’s NFL Draft party in Honolulu, shortly after he was selected by the Tennessee Titans.In a 2016 interview with The Tennessean, Mariota shared a glimpse of their life together, saying, “We don’t have a whole lot of [free] time… but we kind of just got to see Broadway a little bit and heard a lot of music at the country bars. It was a lot of fun.”Their love story continued to grow quietly but steadily. Mariota proposed to Cook in June 2020, and the couple tied the knot in Hawaii the following year. The ceremony, attended by family, close friends, and teammates like Logan Ryan, reflected their shared love for simplicity and togetherness.In December 2022, the couple welcomed their daughter, Makaia Kei Mariota, a moment that Mariota’s foundation celebrated with a rare family photo on Instagram.Despite the spotlight, the Mariotas have maintained a life grounded in family, faith, and giving back. From volunteering with Habitat for Humanity to their work through Motiv8, both Marcus and Kiyomi remain committed to making a difference off the field. Their journey is a reminder that true success isn’t just measured in touchdowns — but in love, balance, and purpose.Also Read: Is Kareem Hunt playing tonight for Chiefs vs Commanders?

The couple, who recently welcomed their first child, has quickly become one of the league’s most talked-about young families. While Travis is focused on football, Leanna is finding her own way to handle the spotlight — through faith and strength.On Friday, Leanna posted a Bible passage to her Instagram Story that many followers saw as a reflection of what she’s been feeling. The verses from Romans 12 spoke about hope, patience, and kindness. It read, ""Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer... Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse... Do not be proud, but be willing to, associate with people of low position.""She highlighted parts of the verse in pink to draw attention to the message. Though she didn’t call anyone out by name, the post followed recent online chatter about the couple’s private life. Many of her followers applauded her for staying grounded and choosing faith over negativity.Since marrying Travis in May, Leanna’s social media has often centered around faith and family.

“Great showing, shitty ending … we will make sure [the rematch] happens as soon as possible.”

On October 25, 2025, at the UFC 321 event in Abu Dhabi’s Etihad Arena, heavyweight champion Tom Aspinall faced challenger Ciryl Gane.

Jordan Love outplays Aaron Rodgers in Week 8 matchup but their brotherhood steals the show

Jordan Love and Aaron Rodgers’ caught-on-camera exchange shows true respect



A feel-good NFL story worth celebrating



NFL fans finally got the matchup they waited years to see in Week 8 — Jordan Love vs. Aaron Rodgers on Sunday Night Football. The former Green Bay teammates shared a unique bond as mentor and understudy for three seasons, but this time they were competitors on the big stage. Love delivered a breakout win, yet it was their heartfelt and now-viral post-game conversation that truly stole the spotlight.Love looked every bit like the Packers’ future centerpiece against the Steelers. He completed 29 of 37 passes for 360 yards and three touchdowns in a flawless performance — no turnovers, no sacks, and even a streak of 20 consecutive completions. His chemistry with tight end Tucker Kraft was undeniable, connecting for 143 yards and two scores. Green Bay’s offense looked smooth, confident, and explosive — the kind of statement win that boosts playoff hopes.Meanwhile, Rodgers — now leading Pittsburgh as they chase a playoff berth — couldn’t keep up on a night when his former understudy took control. But the most emotional moment arrived after the final whistle.When they met at midfield, NFL cameras captured the kind of raw appreciation fans rarely get to hear.Rodgers opened with, “Good game, brother,” and Love instantly returned the respect. They exchanged praise, encouragement, and Rodgers even promised to send his game jersey after Love mentioned he still needed it.It wasn’t dramatic or scripted; just two quarterbacks with genuine respect for the journey they shared. Rodgers spent years helping prepare Love for his moment, and now he’s watching that moment arrive on national TV.Both quarterbacks are pursuing postseason success with different franchises, but Sunday night served as a reminder of how their careers will always remain connected. Love showed he’s ready to lead the Packers forward, while Rodgers demonstrated why he remains admired for more than just his talent.And if this meeting is any indication, the NFL may have a new must-watch quarterback rivalry rooted not in hostility but in respect — one where the student has officially proven he can compete with the master, and the master is proud to see it happen.Also Read: Dallas Cowboys face defensive collapse: Jerry Jones weighs George Pickens’ potential extension amid trade-deadline decisions","NFL fans finally got the matchup they waited years to see in Week 8 — Jordan Love vs. Aaron Rodgers.

What This Means for the Lakers vs Trail Blazers (October 27, 2025)

will not be suiting up tonight for thein their matchup against the Portland Trail Blazers, as the superstar guard continues to recover from a finger sprain and a left leg contusion suffered last week. The Lakers enter their October 27 clash facing significant injury setbacks, with both Doncic and LeBron James among several stars unavailable for action. Luka Doncic sustained his injuries during the Los Angeles Lakers’ commanding victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves, a game in which he delivered an unforgettable 49-point, 11-rebound, and 8-assist performance. Despite taping his injured finger midgame and finishing strong, postgame evaluations confirmed a left finger sprain and a contusion on his lower left leg. The team has since ruled him out for at least a week, which will sideline him for matchups against the Trail Blazers, Kings, Timberwolves, and potentially the Grizzlies.In Luka Doncic’s absence, Austin Reaves is expected to take on a much larger offensive and playmaking role, while Marcus Smart will move into the starting lineup. Head coach JJ Redick described the move as precautionary, noting that there are no long-term concerns about Doncic’s recovery.The Lakers remain confident that he’ll return soon, once he clears reevaluation later this week.The Los Angeles Lakers ’ injury report for tonight paints a tough picture for the team’s depth chart:• Luka Doncic: Finger sprain, left leg contusion – OUT through at least October 31, awaiting reevaluation.• LeBron James: Persistent right-side sciatica – OUT, with a potential return expected in mid-November.• Maxi Kleber: Oblique strain – sidelined until at least November 5.• Jaxson Hayes: Knee issue – day-to-day, ruled out against the Kings and questionable for tonight’s game.• Gabe Vincent: Left ankle sprain – day-to-day, listed as questionable.• Adou Thiero: Knee injury – expected to return by October 31.With both Doncic and James unavailable, the Los Angeles Lakers will lean heavily on their supporting cast to carry the load against the Trail Blazers. Austin Reaves, Marcus Smart, Rui Hachimura, Deandre Ayton, and Gabe Vincent (if cleared) are expected to headline the rotation. Reaves has opened the season in strong form, and his partnership with Smart should provide a balance of scoring, defense, and leadership on both ends of the floor.Head coach JJ Redick told reporters that the team remains “excited” about the challenge and believes the situation will test their flexibility and team chemistry. Fans can expect an energetic, ball-movement-heavy approach as Los Angeles looks to stay competitive despite missing two of its biggest stars.Also read: Portland Trail Blazer vs Los Angeles Lakers regular season injury report: Who's playing, who's out, and more (October 27, 2025) If the Los Angeles Lakers can secure a win without Luka Doncic and LeBron James, it would send a strong message about the team’s depth and resilience early in the 2025-26 season.

LeBron James’ Sciatica Injury Update vs Portland Trail Blazers (October 27, 2025)

How LeBron James’ Absence Affects the Los Angeles Lakers

LeBron James’ Impact from the Sideline

tonight against the Portland Trail Blazers, as he continues to recover from a sciatic nerve injury. The update, confirmed in the Lakers’ latest injury report for October 27, 2025, highlights the growing concern within the franchise about the health of their 40-year-old superstar. His absence leaves a noticeable void in both leadership and versatility - two traits the team desperately needs against a surging Blazers squad.LeBron James remains sidelined due to sciatica, a nerve condition that has kept him off the court since the start of the 2025–26 NBA season. The issue originated during offseason workouts in late July and has persisted despite ongoing treatment. Sciatica typically causes sharp pain, numbness, or tingling sensations that extend from the lower back through the leg - symptoms particularly concerning for an athlete who relies heavily on power, balance, and explosiveness.The Los Angeles Lakers’ medical staff continues to manage LeBron’s recovery carefully, emphasizing long-term health over short-term results. While there is optimism around his progress, the team has avoided providing an exact return date. However, internal discussions suggest early November could be a realistic goal if his rehabilitation continues smoothly.Without LeBron James, the Los Angeles Lakers are entering tonight’s contest severely undermanned.The team will also be missing Luka Doncic, Maxi Kleber, and Adou Thiero, all dealing with their own injury setbacks. With so many key players unavailable, Los Angeles will look to Austin Reaves and Marcus Smart to shoulder the scoring and playmaking responsibilities. Rui Hachimura and Deandre Ayton are expected to anchor the frontcourt, providing much-needed size and energy against Portland’s defensive schemes.The absence of star power undoubtedly raises questions about the team’s offensive rhythm and defensive stability. Fans and analysts alike are curious to see how head coach Darvin Ham adjusts his rotations to compensate for the missing leadership on the floor.Even when not playing, LeBron’s influence remains significant. Expect him to be a vocal presence on the bench - mentoring young players, offering strategic advice, and keeping team morale high. His sideline appearances often add an extra spark to the atmosphere, as fans enjoy seeing his animated reactions, lighthearted moments with teammates, and interactions with courtside supporters. For a player often described as the face of modern basketball, even his presence in street clothes commands attention.LeBron’s absence underscores the Los Angeles Lakers’ ongoing reliance on his leadership and all-around playmaking ability. Historically, the team’s performance takes a noticeable dip when he’s unavailable - a reminder of just how vital he remains, even in his 23rd NBA season. His recovery timeline will continue to be closely monitored, with hopes that he’ll rejoin the lineup in time to help Los Angeles regain momentum and solidify playoff aspirations.For now, the Los Angeles Lakers must navigate a challenging stretch without their cornerstone player. Tonight’s matchup against the Trail Blazers offers a chance for the younger core to prove themselves, stepping up in the absence of their leader. The King’s throne may be empty for the moment, but anticipation is already building for his eventual - and undoubtedly dramatic - return to the court.","LeBron James remains sidelined due to sciatica, a nerve condition that has kept him off the court since the start of the 2025–26 NBA season.

Theare set to clash in an exciting regular-season matchup on October 27, 2025, at the Chase Center. Both teams enter the game with solid 2-1 records, but their momentum is clouded by significant injury concerns that could heavily influence how this Western Conference battle unfolds.The Memphis Grizzlies are dealing with a string of injuries that will keep five key players out of action. Brandon Clarke remains sidelined due to knee synovitis and is expected to return around mid-November after continued treatment. Rookie big man Zach Edey, recovering from ankle surgery, has been cleared for increased activity but is still at least a week or two away from a full return, possibly in early November.Scotty Pippen Jr. faces a lengthy recovery following surgery on his left big toe. He’s projected to miss up to 12 weeks, with a potential return around mid-January. Ty Jerome continues to recover from a right calf strain and is expected to be re-evaluated in four weeks, keeping him out through most of November. Meanwhile, Vince Williams Jr. is sidelined with a heel injury, and though no definitive timeline has been set, early November appears to be a realistic target for his return.With several contributors unavailable, the Memphis Grizzlies’ depth will be tested.This puts immense pressure on Ja Morant and Jaren Jackson Jr. to step up as leaders and carry the offensive and defensive load. The absence of multiple rotation players could force coach Taylor Jenkins to experiment with lineups and rely more heavily on his bench and rookies to stay competitive.The Golden State Warriors , too, are not without setbacks. Three players are officially ruled out for this game. De’Anthony Melton, recovering from an ACL injury, had been targeting a late-October return but remains unavailable for this matchup. Alex Toohey is also sidelined with a knee issue, though the team remains optimistic about a quick recovery once he’s cleared for full participation. Veteran center Al Horford continues to deal with a toe injury and is being evaluated daily to determine when he can rejoin the rotation.Despite these injuries, Golden State remains a dangerous team, anchored by Stephen Curry ’s stellar play. The two-time MVP has been on fire to start the season, averaging an impressive 33 points per game. He’ll once again be the focal point of the Warriors’ offense, supported by veteran forward Jimmy Butler and rising star Jonathan Kuminga, who has been showing significant growth in his role.This matchup will serve as a crucial test of both teams’ depth and adaptability. For the Memphis Grizzlies, missing a combination of frontcourt power and backcourt stability, the focus will be on how well their young players can complement Morant and Jackson against one of the NBA’s most experienced rosters. The Golden State Warriors, on the other hand, will rely on their elite scoring core and tactical flexibility under coach Steve Kerr to manage the loss of key contributors.The contest promises a blend of high energy, tactical adjustments, and moments of individual brilliance. Both teams have shown early-season promise, but injuries have introduced uncertainty into their rotations. Fans watching the game live at the Chase Center or tuning in via ESPN, NBA League Pass, or Fubo can expect a fiercely competitive clash filled with grit, determination, and the desire to stay on the winning track.Also read: Is Ja Morant playing tonight vs the Golden State Warriors?

He will play the 2027 ODI World Cup and retire after that,"" Dinesh Lad said.Speaking about Virat, who bounced back with a rock-solid 74* after two successive ducks in Perth and Adelaide, Lad said there are frequent misconceptions about him.""There are misunderstandings about Virat everyday.

Why coach Gautam was very Gambhir during India nets

NEW DELHI: Since taking over the T20I captaincy from Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav has acted like a pied piper, but his bat has lost its tune.During the title-winning Asia Cup run, the 35-year-old made headlines not for his breathtaking shots or match-winning knocks, but for his theatrics. From refusing to shake hands with Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha to sitting out the league game against Oman, Suryakumar Yadav has been in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons -- trying too hard to channel his inner Rohit Sharma by forgetting player names at tosses, downplaying the India-Pakistan rivalry, dabbling in political remarks, and giving endless interviews.If one were to believe all that he has said across the countless interviews he’s given, it might seem as though he’s steered India to the T20 World Cup. In reality, it was the Asia Cup -- a tournament where India were overwhelming favourites and even a second-string side could have beaten the current dysfunctional Pakistan team.India won the Asia Cup and defeated Pakistan thrice, but amid all this noise, captain Suryakumar Yadav’s poor form went unnoticed.In eleven innings this year, India’s T20I captain has managed just 100 runs at a strike rate of 105.26. Since becoming skipper, he has scored 330 runs in 20 innings with two fifties to his name.The saving grace for him had been the 2025 Indian Premier League (IPL), where the Mumbai Indians batter slammed 717 runs in 16 innings at an explosive strike rate of 167.90.But the focus now is on lifting the T20 World Cup title once again - on home soil at that. Will chief selector Ajit Agarkar and coach Gautam Gambhir overlook Surya’s slump?TimesofIndia.com understands that Surya has the backing of the team management till the 2026 World Cup, but the big question remains -- how long can his barren run go ignored?On Monday, coach Gautam Gambhir backed the T20 skipper. “Honestly, Surya’s batting form doesn’t concern me because we have committed to an ultra-aggressive template in our dressing room. When you embrace this philosophy, failures are inevitable,” he said during a discussion on JioHotstar.“It would be easy for Surya to score 40 off 30 balls and avoid criticism, but we have collectively decided that it’s acceptable to fail while pursuing this approach,” he added.Gambhir has also supported Surya’s “free-spirited” off-field personality, saying it has given the youngsters freedom and expression to play their game.But Gambhir knows that his words will be futile if Suryakumar Yadav’s poor form continues in the five-match T20I series against Australia starting Wednesday.Surya has gone without a fifty in his last 14 innings — unusual for him — and his mode of dismissals in the Asia Cup suggests opponents have found a chink in his armour.Barring an unbeaten 47 against arch-rivals Pakistan in the group stage, he looked all at sea against both pace and spin. His eagerness to play the sweep shot against spinners and premeditated flicks has often cost him his wicket. In Dubai, the pitches were two-paced, but in Australia he’ll face bouncier tracks — as the ODI series already hinted.After winning the Asia Cup final, while addressing questions on ‘handshake-gate’ and the trophy-less celebration, Surya looked uncomfortable when asked about his form. He said: “I feel I am not out of form, I feel I am out of runs.”With five months to go for the T20 World Cup, Suryakumar Yadav will be desperate to rediscover his touch -- because no team wants a struggling captain heading into a global showpiece event.","In eleven innings this year, India’s T20I captain has managed just 100 runs at a strike rate of 105.26.

Records Prithvi Shaw broke with his 222 (156)



Second-fastest double century in Ranji Trophy Elite Group history

– Reached his double hundred in 141 balls, only behind Ravi Shastri’s 123-ball double ton (1984/85)

Fastest double century in the 21st century in Ranji Trophy (Elite Group)

– Surpassed his own previous record of 174 balls set against Baroda in the 2019/20 season

Sixth-fastest century in Ranji Trophy history

– Reached his hundred in just 73 balls during the innings.

Second Indian to score multiple double hundreds in fewer than 200 balls in first-class cricket

– Joins Virender Sehwag in this elite club.

Only player besides Ravi Shastri to feature twice among the four fastest double centuries in Ranji Trophy’s Elite Group.

First player to score a double century for Maharashtra in the 2025–26 Ranji Trophy season.

Among only eight players in the world to have multiple double hundreds in fewer than 200 balls

– Joining legends like Sehwag and Graeme Hick

One of the few Indian players to hit double centuries at a strike rate above 140 in first-class cricket.

NEW DELHI The move from Mumbai to Maharashtra has paid immediate dividends for Prithvi Shaw , who produced a sensational double hundred in only his second outing for his new team. Playing against Chandigarh in the second round of the Ranji Trophy , Shaw blazed to a 156-ball 222, recording the second-fastest double century ever in the tournament’s Elite Group.Shaw reached the milestone in just 141 balls, surpassing Rahul Singh’s 2023/24 record, and now trails only Ravi Shastri’s iconic 123-ball double hundred from the 1984/85 season. The 25-year-old struck 29 boundaries and five sixes, maintaining a strike rate of 142.31, and also brought up his hundred in just 73 balls — the sixth-fastest in Ranji history.After parting ways with the Mumbai Cricket Association following a controversy-filled season, Shaw switched allegiance to Maharashtra, where he started with a century in a warm-up match. His Ranji Trophy campaign began quietly, with a duck in the first innings against Kerala, but his blistering knock against Chandigarh has turned heads once again.The innings not only marks a personal comeback but also places Shaw among Indian cricket’s elite. He now holds the record for the fastest double century in Ranji Trophy’s elite division in the 21st century, surpassing his own previous record of 174 balls (against Baroda in 2019/20).Only Shastri’s whirlwind effort remains faster in the 91-year history of the competition.Shaw is now the only batter besides Shastri to feature twice among the four fastest double centuries in the Ranji Trophy’s elite group. Including the plate division, Hyderabad’s Tanmay Agarwal holds the overall mark for the third-fastest double hundred in first-class cricket.The Maharashtra opener also joins Virender Sehwag as the second Indian to score multiple double hundreds in fewer than 200 balls in first-class cricket — a rare club shared by only eight players worldwide. Other notable Indians to have achieved rapid double hundreds include Rohit Sharma, Yuvraj Singh, Sachin Tendulkar, and Shreyas Iyer.Shaw’s 222 off 156 balls now stands as a reminder of his prodigious talent and potential resurgence. For a player once earmarked as India’s next big thing, this innings could well mark the start of a long-awaited comeback.","Prithvi Shaw scored 222 off 156 balls against Chandigarh in the Ranji Trophy.

“That’s football”: Tom Brady stirs backlash as he shrugs off Cam Skattebo loss while calling for next man up,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/thats-football-tom-brady-stirs-backlash-as-he-shrugs-off-cam-skattebo-loss-while-calling-for-next-man-up/articleshow/124840559.cms,"Rookie running back Cam Skattebo suffered a severe ankle injury, halting the New York Giants' momentum.

Giants must find new direction with Tyrone Tracy Jr. while Cam Skattebo heals

Young QB Jaxson Dart and the Giants offense enter resilience mode

The New York Giants had been riding the youthful fire of rookie running back Cam Skattebo, a mid-round gem who injected life into an offense searching for identity. That spark dimmed abruptly during Sunday’s loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, when Skattebo suffered a severe ankle injury that halted both the stadium and New York’s momentum in a single breath. The rookie had already piled up 587 scrimmage yards and six touchdowns, becoming a fast favorite in Brian Daboll’s reshaped attack.Now, the torch passes to Tyrone Tracy Jr., a player built from the durable cloth coaches trust. He doesn’t possess Skattebo’s lightning-bolt explosiveness, but he offers a calm steadiness that NFL teams cling to when storms hit. Tracy logged 839 rushing yards last season with zero fumbles. He already has 120 yards and a touchdown this season while embracing the gritty jobs like pass pro that rarely make highlight reels.Tom Brady, analyzing from the FOX booth, urged the Giants to stay the course. “They have Tyrone Tracy, who did have a thousand yards rushing as a rookie last year,” he said, slightly inflating the stat sheet but nailing the sentiment: New York can keep its ground game alive. Brady doubled down on belief in the offensive line too, saying, “There’s no reason to...he’s getting good protection from his guys up front.”This setback hit just as New York was beginning to eye a possible future with Skattebo and fellow rookie Jaxson Dart steering the ship. Every promising season has a plot twist, and the NFL rarely hands out sympathy cards. Brady offered perspective from a career defined by surviving these gut-punch moments: “I know it’s a tough injury, but that’s football; you’ve got to deal with it… and find a way to compete.”The Giants’ season now shifts from “breakout” to “battle through.” If Tracy keeps the chains moving and Dart keeps growing, New York may yet turn this adversity into proof of character rather than the beginning of another collapse.Also Read: Bill Belichick facing uncertainty at North Carolina: insiders reveal what could be next for the legendary coach","Rookie running back Cam Skattebo suffered a severe ankle injury in Sunday's loss to the Philadelphia Eagles.

How to Watch Portland Trail Blazers vs Los Angeles Lakers (October 27, 2025)

The regular season matchup between the, at Crypto.com Arena arrives amid major injury woes for both teams. Despite the star power missing on both sides, this West Coast clash promises intensity, unpredictability, and plenty of opportunities for rising talents to shine.The Los Angeles Lakers enter this game with a lineup that barely resembles the one fans expected to see at the start of the season. The biggest blow is the loss of Luka Doncic, who has been sidelined with both a left finger sprain and a lower left leg contusion. Doncic’s absence comes just as he was finding his rhythm in Los Angeles - scoring a combined 92 points in his first two games before the injuries struck. He’s expected to miss at least a week of action.Meanwhile, LeBron James remains out as he deals with a lingering sciatic nerve issue. The 40-year-old superstar, who continues to defy age and expectations, is projected to return sometime around mid-November.Unfortunately for the Lakers, the list doesn’t end there. Adou Thiero (knee) and Maxi Kleber (oblique) have both been ruled out, limiting LA’s options on the perimeter and inside the paint. Jaxson Hayes (knee) and Gabe Vincent (ankle sprain) are listed as questionable, each having missed recent games or exited early due to recurring pain.With several key players unavailable, the Lakers are expected to lean heavily on Austin Reaves, who’s coming off a red-hot performance with 51 points, 11 rebounds, and 9 assists in his last game. Rui Hachimura is likely to take on a larger scoring role, while Marcus Smart will be tasked with leading the offense as the primary playmaker.The Portland Trail Blazers, though brimming with young potential, are dealing with their own set of significant absences. Damian Lillard - the heart and soul of the franchise - will miss the entire 2025–26 season after suffering a devastating Achilles injury during preseason media days. His absence has forced head coach Chauncey Billups to experiment with creative rotations.Last year’s top rookie, Scoot Henderson, is also unavailable due to a hamstring tear that could keep him sidelined until at least mid-November. Robert Williams III remains out as well, still undergoing reconditioning after persistent knee problems.With so many of their core players missing, the Blazers are turning to a younger rotation anchored by Jrue Holiday, Shaedon Sharpe, and Deni Avdija. Jerami Grant’s veteran experience and Toumani Camara’s high-energy play are expected to be vital in keeping the team competitive.Both squads are missing their biggest names, which makes this matchup an open canvas for unexpected performances. For the Lakers, Austin Reaves and Rui Hachimura will be under the spotlight to sustain offensive production, while Smart’s leadership could determine how smoothly LA’s offense functions without its stars.For Portland, Jrue Holiday’s two-way excellence will be central to their game plan. Sharpe’s athleticism and confidence could be the X-factor, while Grant and Camara are expected to bring stability and hustle on both ends.While the marquee names are missing, this game has the potential to be a high-energy showdown between hungry young players eager to prove their worth. Both teams will need to dig deep into their benches, rely on role players, and embrace a gritty style of play. Expect defensive intensity, long scoring droughts, and possibly one or two breakout performances that could steal the spotlight.• Tip-Off: 10:30 p.m. ET / 7:30 p.m. PT• TV: KUNP and SportsNet LA• Streaming: FuboTV, NBA League Pass (regional restrictions may apply)Also read: Is LeBron James playing tonight vs Portland Trail Blazers?

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has suggested that the types of jobs that are being eliminated or transformed by artificial intelligence (AI) may not be consideredin the long run.

Kysre Gondrezick is making headlines for more than her basketball skills. The former WNBA standout has been named Playboy’s Miss June 2025, marking a first in the magazine’s history: a professional female basketball player earning the Playmate title. While Gondrezick is currently a free agent, her Playboy honor shows her ability to balance athletic prowess with modeling as she evolves her career in different directions.Playboy officially introduced Gondrezick as Miss June 2025 on Monday, sharing a striking photo of the former Chicago Sky guard floating on an orange pool toy. In the caption, the magazine noted, “Kysre is the first current female professional basketball player to also take on the Playmate title.”Gondrezick herself emphasized that this transition is not a departure from her identity but an expansion. “What people label as a transition, I embody as evolution. I’m not stepping outside who I am. I’m building a multidimensional brand,” she said (via TMZ).Gondrezick’s basketball journey began at West Virginia and Michigan, leading to her selection as the fourth overall pick in the 2021 WNBA Draft. She played for the Indiana Fever in 2021 before joining the Chicago Sky in 2024.Reflecting on her time in the league, she said, “Becoming a WNBA player and getting to that level, you put in a lot of work to get there. You have to put in even more work to stay there.” Her dedication on the court now complements her growing success in modeling and brand ventures.Off the court, Gondrezick has leveraged her platform and striking presence, posting glamorous shots on social media that have drawn attention for years. The Playboy accolade confirms her growing influence beyond basketball. Recently, she joined the AU Pro Basketball league, signaling she hasn’t left the sport entirely but is charting a unique path that combines athleticism, media, and fashion.Gondrezick’s milestone with Playboy shows a broader shift and athletes can certainly redefine their careers while celebrating individuality. As she continues to navigate multiple industries, Kysre Gondrezick proves that excellence isn’t limited to one arena.

Penguins issue statement on fan’s fall at PPG Paints Arena



Second fall in Pittsburgh sports venues within two days



A shocking scene unfolded at PPG Paints Arena on Monday night when a Pittsburgh Penguins fan fell from the upper concourse into the lower bowl during the team’s matchup against the St. Louis Blues. The incident occurred in the first period shortly after Anthony Mantha netted Pittsburgh’s second goal. Medical teams and emergency personnel quickly responded as the fan lay unconscious before being transported to a nearby hospital.The Pittsburgh Penguins later released an official statement confirming the incident:""The Pittsburgh Penguins can confirm that an adult male fell from the upper concourse to the lower bowl at PPG Paints Arena earlier this evening. The individual was immediately attended to by Pittsburgh EMS as well as PPG Paints Arena personnel and has since been transported to a local hospital. Although there is no further information at this time, the Penguins and OVG Management Group are closely monitoring the situation. Our concerns remain with the individual and his family at this time.""According to reports, the man struck another spectator seated on the suite level as he fell toward Section 101.The individual who was hit received on-site medical evaluation but declined hospitalization, as reported by The Athletic.Despite the unsettling turn of events, the game continued, with the Penguins eventually defeating the Blues 6–3. Bryan Rust scored twice, while captain Sidney Crosby added a goal and two assists — including his 1,700th career point, placing him among the NHL’s all-time greats.After the game, Crosby expressed empathy for the injured fan, saying, “We just heard someone fell tonight. Doesn’t feel right to be talking about points. My thoughts and prayers to that person.”Disturbingly, this marks the second serious fall at a Pittsburgh sports venue in just two days. On Saturday night, before the Steelers hosted the Packers at Acrisure Stadium, a worker fell nearly 50 feet from the scoreboard onto a catwalk and remains in critical condition.While the Penguins’ victory was an on-ice highlight, the night was overshadowed by the fan’s fall — a sobering reminder of how quickly celebration can turn into concern.
