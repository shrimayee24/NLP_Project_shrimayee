Cam Newton says Ja Morant’s celebration crosses the line from edgy to reckless

Why is Ja Morant selling a story that Isn’t Real?

Ja Morant insists he’ll keep the celebration going—until someone objects

Cam Newton criticizes Ja Morant’s inner circle for failing to protect him

Cam Newton isn’t holding back when it comes to his thoughts on Ja Morant ’s recent antics on the court. The former NFL MVP recently shared his unfiltered opinion on Morant’s polarizing “grenade” celebration during an episode of his 4th&1 podcast—and he didn’t mince words.Ja Morant has been in the spotlight not only for his athletic prowess but also for his controversial post-play gestures. Most recently, he drew heat for performing a grenade-throwing motion during games, following an earlier finger-gun celebration that earned him a $75,000 fine from the NBA .Addressing Morant directly, Cam Newton said, ""Whether you do it or not, Ja, people still going to respect you. And there's a difference between being a villain and just being stupid."" He drew a parallel to the NFL’s ban on certain gestures like the “slime” celebration due to their potential gang-related connotations. ""So that will not villainize you more, that's just stupid, you feel me… and I respect Ja, I respect everything he stands for, I love the way he plays.""Despite criticism, Morant seems unfazed. Ahead of a matchup with the Minnesota Timberwolves, the Memphis Grizzlies star made it clear he doesn’t plan to stop anytime soon. ""That's my celebration now until somebody else has a problem with it, and I'll find another one,"" he told reporters.While Newton acknowledged that Morant has the money to deal with fines, he also implied that just because one can afford to take the heat doesn’t mean it’s worth the risk to reputation.Newton’s criticism of Morant didn’t stop at the court. He revisited the player’s 2023 firearm controversies—instances where Morant was seen flashing guns during Instagram livestreams. Instead of placing all the blame on Morant, Newton turned the spotlight on his entourage.""If you go to a restaurant bro, you ain’t never picked up the bill... It’s your job to protect the individual that’s supplying that,” Newton stated on another episode of Cam Newton’s Thoughts.Also Read: “I don’t care, and it never ends”: Josh Berry sounds off on Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce obsession Though Newton hasn’t returned to the NFL since 2022, his insights into athlete conduct and accountability continue to resonate—especially as young stars like Morant navigate fame, fortune, and the fine line between self-expression and self-destruction.",Ja Morant has been in the spotlight for his controversial post-play gestures.

A goal for the ages: Alex Ovechkin breaks Wayne Gretzky's 26-year record



FULL Alex Ovechkin Celebration Ceremony After Record-Breaking Goal No. 895

A legacy passed down: Anastasia Shubskaya receives diamond tribute from Janet Gretzky



After Alex Ovechkin netted his 895th career goal and broke legendary Wayne Gretzky 's record, Janet Gretzky showed respect to a time-honored hockey tradition by gifting Anastasia Shubskaya , wife of Alex Ovechkin, an eight-carat diamond ring that had been estimated at $280,000. The Capitals may have lost to the New York Islanders by a score of 4-1, but the outcome was an afterthought to a night all about legacy, love, and a new chapter in hockey's history.The moment of history arrived at 7:26 of the second period. Alex Ovechkin let go of a blazing shot through fellow Russian Ilya Sorokin, making himself the NHL's all-time leading goal scorer. Fans inside UBS Arena lost their minds, and Alex Ovechkin commemorated the occasion by executing a belly flop onto the ice—celebrating his big achievement.Alex Ovechkin celebrated this achievement in a pregame ceremony against the Carolina Hurricanes on April 10, 2025. He was given a six-foot sculptural painting by TYP depicting his skates and game-used sticks, with his image on it, with “Most Goals All Time” written on the top and “895 Alex Ovechkin 895” on the bottom.While Alex Ovechkin was absorbing the enormity of his achievement, Anastasia Shubskaya was gifted a symbolic token of the historic night. Continuing a tradition started in 1994, when Colleen Howe (wife of Gordie Howe) gave Janet Gretzky a diamond ring after her husband, Wayne Gretzky, broke Colleen Howe’s husband’s record, Janet Gretzky ensured history repeated itself—this time from one hockey family to another.In an interview with the media, Wayne Gretzky said, “A month ago, my wife said, ‘You know, Colleen Howe started a tradition. I’m not sure if anyone is going to break Alex’s record, but I want to give her (Ovechkin’s wife, Anastasia Shubskaya) something really unique.’ So, we went out and she picked out an eight-diamond ring for Alex’s wife. Not only do hockey guys pass down traditions. So do the families and wives.”The act not only spanned generations of greatness but also underlined the strong relationship between hockey families across generations.Anastasia Shubskaya, who tied the knot with Alex Ovechkin in 2016, is a Russian model who has appeared in numerous Russian magazines during her career and has built a strong social media presence. They are proud parents of two sons- Sergei and Ilya.Also read: “Now the real stuff is coming”: Alex Ovechkin skips The Tonight Show appearance to stay playoff-ready Even though the Capitals fell on the evening, the larger context is one of hope. The team had already secured a playoff berth and now has the emotional tailwind of reaching a once-a-generation milestone. With the NHL playoffs coming, Alex Ovechkin and the Washington Capitals aim to ride the wave of history toward what would be a fairy tale conclusion to the 2025 campaign.","Alex Ovechkin scored his 895th career goal, breaking Wayne Gretzky's 26-year record.

Isiah Thomas slammed LeBron James for his shirtless appearance on the court



Fans react to Isiah Thomas’ criticism of LeBron James



With great fandom comes huge criticism, and LeBron James is no exception. James, who has received astonishing fame and accolades over the years in his glorious career in the NBA, has recently been called out by former Detroit Pistons point guard and NBA analyst, Isiah Thomas as the Lakers legend appeared shirtless in his pregame practices on the court. Thomas called the gesture unprofessional and said that the NBA should punish it.The Los Angeles Lakers are set to face the Houston Rockets in a crucial matchup on Friday, April 11. The game is going to be quite important for both teams, with a lot at stake. James, who is available to play the highly anticipated showdown at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles, has been called out by NBA legend and analyst Isiah Thomas.James appeared shirtless on the court ahead of the game for his practice sessions, which did not go well with Thomas. “I would never let one of my player walk out on the floor looking like this. I mean, we are professional NBA league. We ain’t summer league,” Thomas said. ""I totally 100% object to this.”“I just think that the professionalism in our NBA league has diminished so much,"" he continued.Thomas went on to add, “Look I like LeBron, I’m a fan of his but to walk out on a floor before game with no shirt on, come on, man, this… Where we at? What we doing?”“Adam Silver if you wanna fine somebody, fine that, put a fine on that,” he added, urging the Commissioner of the NBA to punish James for his shirtless appearance.Fans online, however, are not very pleased with Thomas’ plea for LeBron James’ punishment.“I watched him walk off the court with time left on clock, past my Bulls bench, no hand shakes, nothing. That is as UNPROFESSIONAL as I’ve ever seen. Fkn hypocrite. What a joke,” one fan wrote on X.“I’m not even LeBron guy but this is ridiculous. Zeke has done a lot of major things wrong and is mad Bron is shooting a basketball without his shirt on,” another wrote, supporting James.“What a farce. This league has gone downhill so much.”One fan initially thought it was a joke, “I watched this on NBATV. Come on now, it's pre-game warmups. I thought Isiah was messing around and going to compliment him on his physique, which led him to say that. I get that the NBA is different now, but this is LeBron. Relax.”“This look like the warmup before the official warmup.. like before the fans even get there. Nahhh zeke. Lol”“why are we giving screen time to Isaiah?”Also Read: LeBron James ""I love everything about that guy"" explains why he'd want to play with Steph Curry As for LeBron James, he has been in great shape and, at 40, is still playing at an elite level.

Shedeur Sanders throws shade at NFL teams while embracing possible backup role to Aaron Rodgers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/shedeur-sanders-throws-shade-at-nfl-teams-while-embracing-possible-backup-role-to-aaron-rodgers/articleshow/120209182.cms,"Image via Imagn Images

Shedeur Sanders impressed during Steelers visit and shared mutual respect with the coaching staff

Learning from a legend? Sheduer Sanders welcomes the idea of sitting behind Aaron Rodgers

As the 2025 NFL Draft looms, Shedeur Sanders is making headlines not only for his talent but also for his poised and grounded mindset. The Colorado star quarterback recently completed a high-profile visit with the Pittsburgh Steelers , a franchise long associated with football tradition, grit, and championship pedigree. While questions swirl around the team’s quarterback future — especially with Aaron Rodgers in the mix — Sanders has made it clear he’s open to whatever path unfolds.Describing his visit to Pittsburgh in glowing terms, Sheduer Sanders told Kay Adams in an interview, “It was a 10. I enjoyed my time in Pittsburgh. I connected well with all the coaches and it was really fun. The best part of the day of course was talking football. It’s my favorite part. It’s just really getting to know each other.”That connection could prove vital as Pittsburgh eyes its next franchise quarterback. With the No. 21 overall pick, the Steelers may find Sanders available — but whether he slides that far is still uncertain. The Heisman hopeful remains confident that teams passing on him would be making a costly mistake. “That’s on the people. That’s on the other franchises that make their mistake and let me go there (Pittsburgh),” he said, signaling his readiness to thrive in the Steelers' system.Perhaps the biggest twist in this potential match-up is the reported interest from the Steelers in Aaron Rodgers — the veteran quarterback whose legacy includes a Super Bowl title and multiple MVP awards. Rodgers is still deciding his future, but if he does land in Pittsburgh, Sanders may find himself in a backup role early on. Rather than balking at the idea, Sanders showed maturity beyond his years.“We didn’t talk about anybody,” Sanders said about Rodgers. “If that’s the way that things play out, that’s how it’ll play out (learn behind Rodgers). I wouldn’t question what God has planned for me.”Also Read: Why Aaron Rodgers’ weekly appearances are raising eyebrows in sports media — Has Pat McAfee given him too much power? In an era where young quarterbacks often demand immediate starts, Sanders’ calm acceptance of potentially learning under Rodgers speaks volumes. Whether he starts Day 1 or takes time to develop, the 21-year-old is already demonstrating the mindset of a future NFL leader — and possibly the next great Steeler under center.","Shedeur Sanders impressed during Steelers visit and shared mutual respect with the coaching staff.

Josh Berry shares frustration over being known for going to school with Taylor Swift, not for racing

Josh Berry, Las Vegas Recap, and a Big Miami Weekend Coming Up

Josef Newgarden and Josh Berry bond over shared roots and racing journey



NASCAR driver Josh Berry has had enough of Taylor Swift questions — and he’s making that very clear. Though the two attended the same high school in Hendersonville, Tennessee, Berry says the constant fascination with Swift's personal life, especially her relationship with NFL star Travis Kelce , has become overwhelming.In a recent appearance on the Rubbin is Racing podcast, Berry spoke candidly about how one offhand comment during a past interview snowballed into a recurring distraction. “It’s one of those things when you’re like doing an interview one day and somebody’s like, hey, what’s a funny crazy story about you, right? And I’m like, oh, I went to school with Taylor Swift, and you don’t think that that’s that big of a deal,” he explained.But once Swift began dating Travis Kelce, the buzz around his old schoolmate reached new heights. “But I mean, good gosh! Man, every time it never ends. And then she starts dating Travis Kelce, and it all comes back again, and I’m like I don’t care about Travis Kelce, like I don’t care, and it never ends,” Berry added with exasperation.While his frustration is clear, it also highlights a recurring challenge many athletes face: being overshadowed by pop culture associations that have little to do with their careers.Interestingly, Berry wasn’t the only motorsport name to walk those high school halls. Josef Newgarden, a two-time IndyCar champion, was also a classmate. The two have reconnected in recent years thanks to Berry’s move to Wood Brothers Racing, which shares a technical alliance with Team Penske — Newgarden’s home team.Their renewed bond led them to return to their alma mater during the off-season through a visit sponsored by shared partner PPG. The drivers spoke with students, posed for photos, and endured a few laughs at their own expense. “The kids had a field day teasing us after finding our old yearbook photos,” Berry recalled.Also Read: The real reason Taylor Swift avoids Coachella: Why the pop star's absence from the music festival continues to stand out Though their paths diverged after high school, the revelation that they both came from the same small-town classrooms and went on to thrive in elite racing circles has only added a new layer to their friendship — one that has nothing to do with Taylor Swift.",NASCAR driver Josh Berry and Taylor Swift went to the same high school.

NEW DELHI: MS Dhoni 's return as Chennai Super Kings (CSK) captain in IPL 2025 wasn’t marked by the kind of dominance fans at Chepauk are used to. Instead, it turned out to be a forgettable outing for the home side, as they were restricted to just 103 for 9 in their 20 overs by a clinical Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) bowling unit.This total (103/9) is now CSK’s lowest-ever score at their home ground, the MA Chidambaram Stadium .The collapse was triggered by KKR’s spinners, who accounted for six CSK wickets — the most wickets CSK have ever lost to spin in a single IPL innings.The Chepauk pitch, known for assisting spin, worked against the home side on the day, as the likes of Sunil Narine and Varun Chakaravarthy applied the chokehold with clever variations and accuracy.97 vs Mumbai Indians, Wankhede, 2022103/9 vs KKR, Chennai, 2025*109 vs Rajasthan Royals, Jaipur, 2008110/8 vs Delhi Daredevils, Delhi, 2012The 103/9 against KKR also stands as the second-lowest total ever recorded by any team at Chepauk, only behind Royal Challengers Bengaluru’s 70 all-out against CSK in 2019.",Chennai Super Kings (CSK) bowled out for 103 against Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) KKR's spinners accounted for six CSK wickets — the most wickets CSK have ever lost to spin in a single IPL innings.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120212904,imgsize-41166,width-400,resizemode-4/Dhoni2-1104-IPL.jpg"

Under Dhoni, CSK have won five IPL titles, the last in 2023, as well as two Champions League trophies.

His only losses came from Marlon Vera at UFC 252 and an unsuccessful title defense against Merab Dvalishvili at UFC 306. Dvalishvili, having won the title bout against O’Malley, successfully defended it in a bout with Umar Nurmagomedov at UFC 311.

That you are getting a quick rematch without even proving yourself as a champ. What do you think about that?”The fighter seemed calm and handled the query smartly.

What is Scottie Pippen's Net Worth in 2025?

Scottie Pippen has played in the NBA for 17 seasons and has six NBA Championship wins under his belt. The athlete is considered to be one of the greatest small forwards in NBA history. Additionally, his achievements include being one of the two players in history who have won an Olympic Gold Medal and an NBA title twice in the same year. After earning great fame and recognition, we are taking a look at how this has impacted his financial portfolio.According to Celebrity Net Worth, Scottie Pippen has a net worth of $20 million. This comes after playing with the Chicago Bulls for 12 seasons, with the Houston Rockets for one season and the Portland Trail Blazers for four seasons. After all the achievements and accolades, his net worth is not as high as his peers. This comes after the star is known to be one of the most underpaid players of all time. He signed a 7-year contract with the Bulls for $18 million. Thus, when the Bulls were at their peak and Michael Jordan would earn $30+ million annually, Pippen would only earn $2.6 million.However, his contract with the Houston Rockets earned him a staggering $67.2 million. Post this, when he joined the Bulls during the last two years of his career, he earned $10 million. While he has earned over $109 million over the years as an NBA player, his net worth has diminished massively.Pippen's net worth also accounted to numerous brand endorsements. He had signed a deal with Avia early in his career. Post this he had also signed a contract with Nike. Other popular brand endorsements include Frito-Lay, McDonald's, Coca Cola, Right Guard and Visa.Also Read: Exploring the personal life of Scottie Pippen However, bad financial decisions have dwindled his net worth to $20 million. He lost $20 million due to his financial advisor, who turned out to be a fraud. Additionally, Pippen has eight children and had to pay child support for each of them. The court had ordered him to pay half of his retirement fund from the Chicago Bulls as a divorce settlement. This also had a severe blow to his net worth. He also had to support his family of 12 siblings as his father was paralyzed due to a stroke.","Scottie Pippen has played in the NBA for 17 seasons and has six NBA Championship wins under his belt.

Poll Which team will win the upcoming match: CSK or KKR? KKR CSK

Are CSK making the best use of Jadeja?

CHENNAI: There was much drama in the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) camp on the eve of their must-win game against Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR). Ruturaj Gaikwad , who was hit by a Tushar Deshpande delivery in the game against Rajasthan Royals in Guwahati last week, appears to have a broken elbow.“Ruturaj has been ruled out of the rest of the IPL with a broken elbow. And now a certain uncapped player called MS Dhoni will lead us,” coach Stephen Fleming said.Gaikwad hasn’t been at his best and it will be interesting to see if CSK go back to senior player Rahul Tripathi at the top of the order or throw in one of the rookies — Shaikh Rashid or Andre Siddarth — into the deep end.Asked whether it was difficult to make Dhoni take up the captaincy again, Fleming said, “No, he understood the situation. Ruturaj didn’t want to go but it’s an unfortunate situation.”The injury complicates an already complicated situation for CSK, who have only one win out of five. Another loss here on Friday may just make the uphill road to playoffs qualification all the more difficult. But then, their opponents KKR aren’t exactly better off either.The defending champions have won only two of their five matches and it’s extremely important that they take full points here. There’s one thing, though, that may just help the Knight Riders at the MA Chidambaram Stadium — the pitch. They have complained a lot about their home pitch at the Eden, but here, their spinners might get the purchase they are looking for.For a long time, one of the centrepieces of Chennai Super Kings’ success has been Ravindra Jadeja. It was his consistency over the years that made CSK shell out Rs 18 cr to retain him. However, in the five games that CSK have played so far, it seems that their former captain has been underutilised to a degree.In none of the games did the experienced left-arm spinner get his full quota of four overs. In 13 of the 20 available overs that he bowled, Jadeja gave away 105 runs, going at an economy rate of 8.“We have six options. It’s not a set stage for anybody, we try to go according to the situation,” coach Fleming said on Thursday.Meanwhile, as a batter too, Jadeja has been limited to the role of a finisher at a time when the top order has struggled.“We really like his partnership with MS at the back end. That appeals to us,” Fleming said.",Ruturaj Gaikwad has been ruled out of the rest of the IPL with a broken elbow. MS Dhoni will lead the Chennai Super Kings against Kolkata Knight Riders.

Gilbert Arenas slammed Anthony Davis after his performance against the Los Angeles Lakers



Luka Doncic & The Lakers Got ROBBED By The NBA!!

The Dallas Mavericks have been in hot water since the Luka Doncic- Anthony Davis trade, which created a shockwave in the entire NBA. The former Los Angeles Lakers star joined the Mavericks, but the organization is far from catching a breath. They have been riddled with injuries, including Davis. Although Davis made his early return, his performance on the court was not what was expected by fans and analysts. NBA legend Gilbert Arenas recently lashed out at AD for his comparatively poor performance against the Lakers.Anthony Davis had a quiet outing in his 33-minute return to action, finishing with 13 points on 5-of-13 shooting from the field. Davis also went 3-for-5 at the free-throw line, further exposing his struggles to find a rhythm offensively.On the glass, he remained effective, pulling down 11 rebounds— 9 of them on the defensive end. He also dished out 6 assists. However, his impact was limited defensively, with no steals and just one block on the night.Turnovers and fouls added to the rough performance, as Davis committed 4 turnovers and picked up 2 personal fouls. His minus-10 rating shows a game where the team struggled to find balance with him on the floor. It’s clear that while Davis is back in the lineup, he’s still searching for his full form and timing following his injury layoff.In a recent episode of The Gil’s Arena podcast, former NBA star Gilbert Arenas did not hold back anything as he lashed out on AD for his poor performance in the game at the American Airlines Center. “Just as a basketball player for the Dallas Mavericks I’m sorry to tell you you failed the assignment last night,” Arena stated.“They’re screaming another name in here, they’ve got flags all through the m*** f****. It wasn’t an American flag, it wasn’t a Dallas, Texas flag, it was his country flag. It was your chance, your spotlight to show the Dallas Maverick fans you ain’t no bum, you’re going to bring them something, and nobody even noticed you,” the NBA legend added.Also Read: Luka Doncic scores 45 in return game as Dallas Mavericks fall to Los Angeles Lakers With a sigh of relief, Anthony Davis recorded the fourth triple-double of his career on Friday night, posting 23 points, 13 rebounds, and 10 assists to power the Dallas Mavericks to a dominant 124-102 victory over the Toronto Raptors at home.","Anthony Davis had a quiet outing in his 33-minute return to action, finishing with 13 points on 5-of-13 shooting from the field.

HYDERABAD: The downtime following their last defeat should’ve served Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH )well in introspecting their poor run in this edition of the Indian Premier League ( IPL ).Last year they biffed opponents into submission with their ultra-aggressive batting, but it looks like a distant dream this season, which could well be a summer of discontent unless they get their act together, quickly.The burden of expectations following their last season’s runners-up finish seems to weigh them down heavily and added to the many problems they must deal with. They also have a certain Priyansh Arya to contend with when they play Punjab Kings in the night match of the double-header on Saturday.The 24-year-old Delhi lad batted with refreshing freedom against Chennai Super Kings and cruised from 80 to 102 in four deliveries of total disdain for Matheesha Pathirana that typified Punjab’s approach this season.They have already logged two totals upwards of 200 in four matches — the 50-run defeat to Rajasthan Royals their only blip so far this season — and with skipper Shreyas Iyer exemplifying the team-first philosophy even if he was stranded on an unbeaten 97 against Gujarat Titans, the likes of Shashank Singh and Nehal Wadhera have made up for Glenn Maxwell’s poor returns.Meanwhile, barring two partnerships — 85 for the second and 72 for the third in their first match that fuelled expectations — SRH have struggled to find their rhythm or sustain momentum in the next four games.PBKS: Shreyas Iyer (c), Prabhsimran Singh, Nehal Wadhera, Marcus Stoinis, Glenn Maxwell, Shashank Singh, Marco Jansen, Lockie Ferguson, Yuzvendra Chahal, Arshdeep Singh, Suryansh Shedge (Impact Player: Priyansh Arya)SRH: Pat Cummins (c), Abhishek Sharma, Ishan Kishan, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen, Aniket Verma, Abhinav Manohar, Zeeshan Ansari, Harshal Patel, Mohammed Shami, Kamindu Mendis (Impact Player: Travis Head)",Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) play Punjab Kings in the night match of the double- header on Saturday.

Clayton Kershaw’s plan for a solid comeback



Who will replace Blake Snell?

“When you have a roster that's arguably the most talented roster in history, one through 40, playing time is hard, All guys want to play, should want to play. But it takes some buy-in to their teammates and the organization.”

Amid a heated baseball season, pitcher Clayton Kershaw is now expected to return to play for the Los Angeles Dodgers . Reports have suggested that Clayton Kershaw will be beginning the recovery by playing in a minor league game next week. As per Dodgers, this was a part of his rehab after he sustained injuries.While Clayton Kershaw is doing everything he can, it is difficult to state that he will be able to continue and compete in the MLB. He might not be able to play for the Los Angeles Dodgers, until at least May 17. The Dodgers have decided to follow all the rules and give him time to heal and come back stronger.In the last offseason, Clayton Kershaw was able to sign yet another, one year, $7.5 million contract, with the Los Angeles Dodgers. However, Kershaw was then placed on at least 60 days of injured list. He had to undergo surgeries on his left foot and knees post 2024 season. It was made unclear whether or not he’ll return in time for the 2025 season.Now, Clayton Kershaw is preparing to restart. It is indeed beneficial for him to start with the minor. He will be in the minor league only for a stipulated time period of 30 days, as per MLB rules. Kershaw will be able to make his MLB comeback with the Los Angeles Dodgers, provided he starts with the minor league on April 16.Another question that fans had this season was whether or not, younger players will feature on the Los Angeles Dodgers’ list, considering that all top names are already playing.While Dodgers’ manager Dave Roberts believes it’s difficult finding time when the entire team is full of brilliant players, he believes supporting and trusting the team is much more important. Dave Roberts said:While just starting out the season this year, the Dodgers faced several difficulties, with players being placed on injured lists. Recently, pitcher Blake Snell too was left injured, and placed on the list. To replace him, the Dodgers called on younger pitchers — Justin Wrobleski and Landon Knack. The duo were called from Triple-A. While the two were tested, the results weren’t very confident. Knack, however, did have experience playing, hence, he has now been decided to be tested again.Also Read: Yoshinobu Yamamoto Is Back At Dodger Stadium Preparing For His First Start Since June",Clayton Kershaw will be playing in a minor league game next week.

Ben Roethlisberger suggests Rodgers could be waiting on Steelers' draft decision

Pat McAfee & Big Ben talk Steelers QB, Big Night Aht, Best sports moments in history & more! Ep. 79

As the 2025 NFL Draft looms just two weeks away, all eyes remain on one of football’s most enigmatic figures — Aaron Rodgers . Despite a long-awaited meeting with the Pittsburgh Steelers and a high-profile workout alongside DK Metcalf, the veteran quarterback has yet to make any announcements about his next move. And former Steelers great Ben Roethlisberger thinks he knows why.Aaron Rodgers, who wrapped up a mixed season with the New York Jets in 2024, has become the subject of intense speculation. While retirement is a natural assumption for a 41-year-old QB, Ben Roethlisberger doesn’t think that’s the direction Rodgers is heading. Instead, he offered a trio of intriguing possibilities on his Footbahlin podcast, joined by Pat McAfee.“I have a new theory after my last theory went viral… I think either he’s going to wait, cuz what are you waiting for? You are waiting for the Pat McAfee Show Wednesday night or you’re waiting for the Draft to see if they’re going to draft a quarterback. Maybe he doesn’t want to be here if they are bringing a guy in,” Roethlisberger said.With buzz growing around the Steelers possibly targeting Shedeur Sanders with their No. 21 pick, Rodgers may be gauging how serious the team is about investing in a rookie quarterback. That decision could determine whether the franchise envisions Rodgers as a short-term mentor or a full-fledged starter.Roethlisberger’s third theory hints at something even more strategic. “I think there might be a wild card team out there… Maybe there is a quarterback out there who has a subtle injury that people doesn’t know about. Maybe he’s waiting for that.”This potential surprise suitor could explain Aaron Rodgers’ patience — waiting for an opening due to an unforeseen QB injury in a contender that needs a veteran leader.While Aaron Rodgers managed nearly 3,900 yards and 28 touchdowns last season, his overall performance — coupled with team struggles — has cooled the market. The Vikings and Giants have reportedly moved on, and the Steelers remain the only team showing public interest.Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin acknowledged Rodgers’ visit: “There’s still no substitute for spending time together and bouncing ideas off of one another.” Whether it's the draft, a mystery injury, or another twist, Rodgers' next move remains one of the NFL’s biggest unanswered questions.Also Read: Is Aaron Rodgers really a perfect match for the Steelers?

Manager Bob Melvin praises Jung Hoo Lee

“He’s hitting the ball hard, He’s using the whole field. It’s nice that he’s had a nice little run here where he’s gotten some hits. I think last year he was probably a little bit of a tough-luck hitter. But I think getting off to a good start is important for him because he hasn’t played in a bit, especially here in the States. So far, so good with him. He continues to hit in the three-hole and does some really good things, including how he runs the bases and plays defense.”

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

LUCKNOW: It has been fascinating to watch Rishabh Pant working hard in the nets in the leadup to every game. The Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) captain, the most expensive Indian Premier League (IPL) player, is desperate to recover some semblance of batting form and has intensified his nets sessions.Pant has faced only 32 deliveries across four innings and managed 19 runs, but the fact that LSG have won three out of five games and are currently at No. 5 in the points table have helped hide his personal shortcomings.LSG, who face the Shubman Gill-led Gujarat Titans on Saturday, are coming off consecutive wins against Mumbai Indians (MI) and Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR). But they will be keen to improve their record against the Titans, who have won four out of five meetings against them since both the teams joined the league in 2022.Table-toppers Titans are formidable opponents, having won four out of five matches this season.LSG played their first home match against Punjab Kings on a red-soil pitch and lost. They then played on a black-soil surface against MI and made their highest score of 203/8, the first time in three seasons that LSG had crossed the 200-run mark at home. For this contest too, the black-soil pitch will be used. In general, though, the Ekana Stadium is famous for its spin-friendly surfaces.Titans will be wary of Nicholas Pooran and Mitchell Marsh, who’ve played explosive cricket for LSG.

CHENNAI: Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) captain Ajinkya Rahane has cried himself hoarse asking for a spin-friendly pitch at their home ground, the Eden Gardens in Kolkata. The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) hasn’t yet obliged and naturally, the results haven’t been spectacular. However, on Friday at Chennai Super Kings ’ (CSK) home ground, the MA Chidambaram Stadium, KKR’s spin-trio of Varun Chakravarthy, Sunil Narine and Moeen Ali — along with paceman Harshit Rana, who is very good with his cutters — got a slightly conducive surface and wreaked havoc, subjecting the hosts to the kind of humiliation they are not used to at home.CSK were dismissed for 103/9 — their lowest at the Chepauk — topping their previous low of 109 against MI in 2019. The KKR batters, though, showed that there weren’t any demons in the pitch. A mighty assault led by Narine (44 off 18 balls) and his opening partnership of 46 off 25 balls with Quinton de Kock finished off any hopes of a CSK fightback.KKR notched up the eight-wicket win in 10.1 overs, boosting their net run-rate significantly, while CSK now have no place to hide.The game was set up with a combination of excellent bowling and some atrocious batting by the CSK batters, most of them well past their prime. With losses in five consecutive games, CSK’s famed strategy of playing with experienced players, who may have played their best cricket a long while ago, is truly unravelling. But then, that doesn’t take anything away from KKR.The visitors had a well-thought out plan and captain Rahane chose to bowl even though CSK had lost four matches chasing. Quite clearly, he believed that his bowlers are up to the job on a pitch where the ball was stopping and turning.Rahane introduced Moeen (1/20) in the Powerplay with his off-spin and it was in his first two overs that the die was cast. His second over was a maiden when he had the wicket of Devon Conway, missing one in his attempt to reverse sweep to be leg-before.Paceman Harshit used his change of pace to induce a false shot off Rachin Ravindra and with the score reading 16/2 in 4.1 overs, the CSK innings was already in doldrums. From there on, it was a tale of Varun (2/22) and Narine (3/13) stifling the middle-order which seemed clueless against their guile.They hit the right length, got the ball to turn just a little bit as the CSK batters failed to read them from their hands. The likes of Vijay Shankar, Rahul Tripathi, Ravindra Jadeja and ‘impact sub’ Deepak Hooda were unable to take the attack to the rivals as wickets kept falling.But the biggest disappointment was ‘new captain’ MS Dhoni . Batting at No. 9, he missed a faster one off Narine and got caught plumb in front. He asked for a review, it went on for quite a while, the fans hoped and prayed for a hint or murmur from the bat, but there wasn’t any.Shivam Dube at the other end was left stranded, unbeaten on 31, and helped CSK limp past the 100-mark. In the process, he pulled his hamstring and if the injury gets worse, CSK are really looking at more bleak days.","Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) beat Chennai Super Kings (CSK) by eight wickets. CSK were bowled out for 103 at their home ground, the MA Chidambaram Stadium. KKR's spin-trio of Varun Chakravarthy, Sunil Narine and Moeen Ali wreaked havoc.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120222256,imgsize-34958,width-400,resizemode-4/Dhoni-1280-spotzpics.jpg"

BENGALURU: “Mera ground hai,” declared KL Rahul after his unbeaten 93 on a tricky M Chinnaswamy stadium surface steered Delhi Capitals (DC) to a six-wicket win over Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) on Thursday night.Rahul owned his home ground, where he has played many memorable knocks, including a triple century in Ranji Trophy. The 32-yearold has over t h e y e a r s m a s t e r e d the art of adaptation. From opening the innings to batting at No. 8 to displaying agility behind the stumps, Rahul, the quintessential team man, goes about his job without a fuss.In his 12th year as an international cricketer, Rahul has faced challenges aplenty. Having spent a lot of time over the last few years on the sidelines with multiple injury issues, he has scripted a fresh chapter each time critics begin to write his epilogue. A constant in this journey has been his ability to adapt.The flexibility he offers underlines his versatility, the depth of his class and craft. RCB’s batting coach Dinesh Karthik said the role Rahul was performing with such aplomb wasn’t straightforward.“It’s very challenging to bat at different positions in T20. But it’s one that he’s (Rahul) done nicely in the recent past. For some time now, I’ve believed he’s a high-quality middle-order batter. And you can see the results coming through as well.”Rahul, who was dropped when on only five runs by home team skipper Rajat Patidar, said at the post-match presentation, “This is my ground, this is my home. I know this (ground) better than anybody else. I enjoyed playing here.”While the Capitals’ top-order comprising Jake Fraser-McGurk, Faf du Plessis and Abhishek Porel perished to cross-batted shots, most of Rahul’s big hits were a result of his open-faced bat approach.“What helped me was being behind the stumps for 20 overs, just watching how it played. I figured that the ball sat in the wicket a little bit, but it was consistent. I knew what my shots were. Just wanted to get off to a good start, be aggressive initially and assess it from there. If I was trying to hit a big six, I knew what pockets to target. Wicketkeeping gave me a feel for how the other batters played,” Rahul explained.",KL Rahul scores unbeaten 93 as Delhi Capitals beat Royal Challengers Bengaluru.

NEW DELHI: On a night MS Dhoni resumed the captaincy mantle for Chennai Super Kings ( CSK ), it was Kolkata Knight Riders ' Sunil Narine who stole the spotlight with a stunning all-round performance that silenced the Chepauk faithful on Friday.The Ajinkya Rahane-led side , chasing a modest 104, romped to an eight-wicket win in just 10.1 overs, riding on Narine’s blitz and a collective bowling masterclass.Dhoni’s return to leadership, following Ruturaj Gaikwad’s injury, was expected to lift CSK, but the veteran keeper-batter managed just 1 off 4 balls and fell LBW to the man of the moment, Sunil Narine, in the 16th over of the game.That moment, accompanied by stunned silence in the stands, summed up CSK’s woeful evening.After opting to bowl, KKR’s spinners choked the hosts on a dry surface.Narine led the charge with a mesmeric spell of 3 for 13, dismantling the middle and lower order with guile and bite.His victims included Rahul Tripathi, Ravindra Jadeja, and Dhoni -- three massive scalps that sucked the life out of CSK’s innings.Only Shivam Dube (31 not out) and Vijay Shankar (29) showed resistance as CSK limped to 103/9, their lowest-ever IPL total at home and third lowest overall.The rest of the lineup crumbled under the pressure applied by Narine, Harshit Rana (2/16), and Varun Chakaravarthy (2/22).Narine wasn’t done yet.Opening the chase, he launched into the CSK bowlers, smashing 44 off just 18 balls, with 5 sixes and 2 fours -- a cameo that turned a modest target into a formality.He fell just shy of a fifty, but by then, KKR were well on course.Rahane (20 not out) and Rinku Singh (15 not out), finished the job, with the latter smashing a six off Jadeja to seal the emphatic win.In the end, it was Narine’s night -- ball, bat, and brilliance -- as KKR humbled CSK and muted the Dhoni fairytale.","Kolkata Knight Riders beat Chennai Super Kings by eight wickets. Sunil Narine took three wickets for just 13 runs. Ajinkya Rahane and Rinku Singh added 20 runs for the second wicket.

Fastest chases of 100+ totals in IPL:

To make matters worse, Friday’s loss to KKR was also their third consecutive defeat at Chepauk — marking the first time they’ve suffered three back-to-back home losses in the league.KKR’s bowlers delivered a masterclass in control and precision. Veteran Sunil Narine spun a web with figures of 3/13, while pacer Harshit Rana and spinner Varun Chakaravarthy took two wickets each. CSK’s batters never found rhythm, managing just nine boundaries — a telling stat of their struggles on a slow, gripping surface.Shivam Dube was the only silver lining for CSK, scoring an unbeaten 31 off 29 balls. Vijay Shankar chipped in with 29, but no other batter crossed the double-digit mark, exposing the brittle middle order.In reply, KKR’s openers came out with intent and aggression, putting the game to bed in quick time. They wrapped up the chase with 59 balls to spare, underlining their dominance.KKR’s only bigger win came in 2021 when they chased 93 against RCB in just 10 overs, with 60 balls remaining.9.4 overs – RCB vs KKR, Bengaluru, 2015 (Target: 112)9.4 overs – SRH vs LSG, Hyderabad, 2024 (Target: 166)10.1 overs – KKR vs CSK , Chennai, 2025 (Target: 104)*","Kolkata Knight Riders beat Chennai Super Kings by eight wickets.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Capitals are set to host Mumbai Indians in their IPL 2025 clash at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Sunday. The Hardik Pandya-led Mumbai Indians have already arrived in the capital and are currently training in the city.However, their preparations were affected as Delhi and surrounding NCR regions experienced a sudden dip in temperature on Friday, accompanied by dusty storms for the second consecutive day. The weather disrupted flight operations at the Delhi airport, leading to multiple delays and diversions — and even impacted Mumbai Indians’ practice session.In a video shared by the Mumbai Indians on their social media platforms, star batter Rohit Sharma is seen reacting humorously to the incoming storm. As strong winds hit the stadium, Rohit can be heard shouting “comeback” to his teammates. He then playfully tells the cameraman to focus on the storm instead of him.(Hey, why are you filming me? Shoot the storm instead),"" Rohit says in the clip.Meanwhile, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a yellow alert for Delhi on April 11, with temperatures expected to range between 23°C and 38°C.While the storms caused disruption, the overcast skies and cooler winds brought a brief respite from the heatwave that had gripped the region over the past week.Delhi Capitals remain the only unbeaten side in the tournament so far with four wins from four matches.Mumbai Indians, on the other hand, are struggling at the bottom half of the table — placed eighth with just one win and four defeats in five games.","Delhi Capitals host Mumbai Indians in their IPL 2025 clash on Sunday.

MS Dhoni returns as CSK Captain, confirms coach Stephen Fleming

Chennai Super Kings (Playing XI):

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings suffered a major setback as regular skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad was ruled out of the IPL due to an elbow injury — a development that has paved the way for Mahendra Singh Dhoni to return to the leadership role. CSK head coach Stephen Fleming confirmed the news on Thursday. Gaikwad sustained the injury after being struck by a short ball from Jofra Archer during CSK’s IPL 2025 clash against Rajasthan Royals."" Ruturaj Gaikwad ruled out of IPL with fracture on elbow. MS Dhoni to take over as captain,"" Fleming told mediapersons on Thursday.“He (Gaikwad) got hit in Guwahati. He’s been operating with an amount of pain. We got an X-ray, which was inconclusive, and we had an MRI, which revealed a fracture in his elbow, in the radial neck. So we’re disappointed and feel for him. We appreciate the efforts that he’s gone to in terms of trying to play, but unfortunately, he’d be out of the tournament from now. We have an uncapped player, MS Dhoni, who will take over as captain for the remainder of the IPL,"" Fleming added at a press conference.Dhoni, who came out for the toss for CSK, also confirmed that Gaikwad was ruled out of the season. He made two changes to the Playing XI, bringing in Rahul Tripathi in place of Gaikwad and including Anshul Kamboj for Mukesh Choudhary.""We were looking to bat first. Quite a few occasions where we tried to chase it down and what we realised is that the wicket slows down a bit, so if you don't get a good start then the middle order comes under pressure. (On Ruturaj) He has fractured something on his elbow, so he is ruled out of the tournament. He is a very authentic batter, someone who looks to time the ball well. So yeah, he will be a big miss,"" Dhoni said during the toss.""(On the importance of winning this game) It is important now, every game is important. We have lost too many matches and now it is important to do the basics right - have dot balls, take our catches. A couple of games we lost by big margins, but otherwise it was about the small things - about one over going for 20 runs. Our batters are more authentic as batters, they won't slog everything. They just need to back their instincts. It is important to start well, get boundaries early on and try to get a couple of early wickets as well.

At the post-match presentation, he reaffirmed, ""This is my ground, my home, know this (ground) better than anyone else.""In a video shared by Delhi Capitals, Rahul also opened up about the inspiration behind his never-before-seen celebration.""This is a special place for me. The celebration was from one of my favourite movie Kantara. So, yes, just a tiny reminder that this ground, this home, this turf is where I hav grown up and this is mine,"" KL Rahul revealed.Rahul acknowledged it was a tricky pitch.""It was a slightly tricky wicket but what helped me was being behind the stumps for 20 overs, watching how the wicket played. The ball sat in the wicket but it was consistent throughout, it was one-paced. I knew what my shots are, wanted to get off to a good start, and then assess it accordingly. It depends on the conditions and the ground and the dimensions. On a wicket like this, I knew what my pockets were.""If I wanted to hit a big six, I knew what pockets to target, and keeping gave me a feeler for where other batters were dismissed and where they hit the sixes. Got lucky with the dropped catch.""""Something I have always done with my preparation is that I always try to adapt to different wickets (even in practice). I experiment in practice, get out a couple of times but it gives me a fair idea of the areas I can target - where I can take singles, where I can hit sixes.""I don't keep batting for hours and hours and keep slogging. I do that sometimes but that is when I am not getting into a flow and rhythm. It is more about how I can master playing (on a particular pitch) and that becomes second-nature,"" he said.Delhi Capitals are unbeaten in the tournament and are currently placed at top of the points table.","KL Rahul played a match-winning knock of 93 not out to steer Delhi Capitals to a six-wicket victory over Royal Challengers Bengaluru.
