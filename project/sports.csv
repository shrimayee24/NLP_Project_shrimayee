Megan Thee Stallion on her relationship with Klay Thompson



Klay Thompson might be known for his calm demeanor on the court, but off it, the Dallas Mavericks star recently showed his softer side. After arriving late to pick up his girlfriend, rapper Megan Thee Stallion , from the airport, Thompson went viral for his heartfelt apology and his remorse. The clip, shared by Megan on social media, captured the NBA star trying to make amends with flowers in hand and genuine regret on his face.The moment quickly became a talking point among fans, who couldn’t get enough of the couple’s chemistry and Thompson’s down-to-earth approach. It also comes at a time when both are thriving in their respective careers, with Thompson beginning his new season in Dallas and Megan releasing new music inspired by their relationship.In the video posted online, Klay Thompson can be seen handing Megan a bouquet while apologizing repeatedly for showing up late. “Roses for my boo,” he said while driving her home. “I’m sorry I was late, babe. Damn it. I’m sorry. I thought I timed it well. Ah, just sorry. There’s no excuse.”Fans immediately flooded social media with amused and affectionate reactions, praising Thompson’s gesture as “adorably human.” The incident added another viral moment to their growing list of public appearances since confirming their romance earlier this year.Over the summer, the couple enjoyed a fishing trip that gave fans a glimpse into their playful dynamic. “So today, Klay is taking me on another adventure and we’re going fishing,” Megan said at the time. Thompson responded lovingly: “I got my queen on board, of course I feel cool. I’m the coolest guy in this harbor!”For Megan, whose real name is Megan Jovon Ruth Pete, the relationship marks a new chapter. “This is my first relationship where I’ve ever been with somebody who’s genuinely a nice person, and he makes me genuinely happy,” she told Page Six.“I just never dated somebody like him before and I’m just grateful that he’s here by my side and he feels the same way about me.”Despite occasional public skepticism — even from personalities like Shaquille O’Neal, who jokingly doubted their relationship on The Big Podcast — fans have embraced the pair’s authenticity. O’Neal later called Megan “athletic, so beautiful, and so gorgeous,” insisting his remarks were lighthearted.For now, Thompson and Megan seem unfazed by outside opinions.

:

In Pittsburgh, the question surrounding Sidney Crosby’s future has been gaining momentum. Fans and analysts have speculated whether the Penguins’ captain might end his career elsewhere or if his incredible legacy will remain tied to the Steel City. Penguins GM Kyle Dubas has finally addressed it, making it clear that there’s no room for doubt about his commitment—or Crosby’s.The 39-year-old executive, who also shoulders responsibilities with Team Canada’s Olympic roster, has made one thing certain: his plan for Crosby and the Penguins isn’t changing anytime soon. His goal remains focused on building a team capable of contending while keeping its core intact, both for today and tomorrow.Speaking to The Athletic, GM Kyle Dubas shared rare insights into his approach to keeping Sidney Crosby’s future in Pittsburgh aligned with the team’s larger vision. He emphasized the importance of communication and trust, explaining how he keeps both Crosby and his agent, Pat Brisson, informed of every move. “Our goal is not so different,” Dubas said of the 38-year-old captain. “Every day, we're trying to get better.We're trying to put ourselves in a position to win every single day. And I think that's been what we really set out to do from the spring to the summer through the fall.”Dubas acknowledged that results might not always be immediately visible, but his philosophy remains steady. “I communicate that with Sid and with Pat, and I just don't think we can veer from it if we're going to deliver for him a team that can contend while he's still at this level, while he's still playing,” he said. The GM praised Crosby’s character and dedication, noting how his leadership continues to define the Penguins’ culture.He also credited the rest of the leadership core—Evgeni Malkin, Kris Letang, Bryan Rust, Erik Karlsson, and Rickard Rakell—for maintaining that championship mindset. “That in itself is probably the most important part of bringing the team back to that point (contention),” Dubas added.As for what comes next, Dubas isn’t rushing into decisions about Crosby’s long-term future. With two years left on his contract, he believes the best path forward is simple: keep winning. “No, I would never,” he said when asked about trading or disrupting the core. “He's got two years, this year and next year, on his contract. And I just think that if we continue to take the right steps and we continue to win, that's the great solution to everything in sports. Just have to win.”For Kyle Dubas, success on the ice remains the answer to everything—including ensuring that Sidney Crosby’s story in Pittsburgh continues exactly where it began.","Penguins GM Kyle Dubas reveals his plan for Sidney Crosby’s future in Pittsburgh.

Micah Parsons makes emotional pledge to the family of Marshawn Kneeland after the confirmed details of Kneeland’s death

Dallas Cowboys defensive end Marshawn Kneeland died Wednesday night at 24. The Marshawn Kneeland mental health conversation has taken over the NFL after police confirmed he died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound hours after a pursuit on the Dallas North Tollway. Two days earlier, Marshawn Kneeland scored his first NFL touchdown. The timeline has left fans, teammates, and coaches stunned.The details are confirmed by police, dispatch audio, and team statements. Nothing about this is speculation. Everything about this is difficult. And the Marshawn Kneeland mental health story now sits at the center of a larger conversation the NFL has spent years trying to address.DPS troopers tried to stop a vehicle around 10:30 p.m. on the Dallas North Tollway near Keller Springs. Video from NTTA showed the trooper chasing a speeding car. Investigators said the trooper lost visual contact. Minutes later, the same car, registered to Marshawn Kneeland, was found crashed off the Dallas Parkway near The Star.Initial reports said Marshawn Kneeland left the scene on foot. Officers began searching after receiving information that he had expressed suicidal thoughts. Plano police went to the apartment listed to the vehicle around 11 p.m.,found no one inside, returned at 11:40 p.m. after another welfare call, and again made no contact.Frisco police found Marshawn Kneeland at 1:30 a.m. with what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The Tarrant County Medical Examiner confirmed the cause as suicide, according to Nick Harris of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.TMZ published police dispatch audio that directly referenced the Marshawn Kneeland mental health crisis. Operators relayed information from Marshawn Kneeland’s girlfriend and the NFL. She told police he was armed, had a history of mental struggles, and told officers he said he would “end it all.” Dispatchers said the NFL told Plano PD that Marshawn Kneeland had been texting his family goodbye.How former coaches, teammates, fans, and the league responded to Marshawn Kneeland and why the Marshawn Kneeland mental health conversation has become unavoidableThe Dallas Cowboys released a statement:“It is with extreme sadness that the Dallas Cowboys share that Marshawn Kneeland tragically passed away this morning. Marshawn was a beloved teammate and member of our organization. Our thoughts and prayers regarding Marshawn are with his girlfriend Catalina and his family.”Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni opened his press conference by saying, “The NFL is a brotherhood, you know, and so obviously that was on our mind this morning. And our thoughts and prayers go out to, you know, his family and the and the Dallas Cowboys.”FOX 4 spoke with former Cowboys defensive coordinator Mike Zimmer and former assistant defensive line coach Greg Ellis. Mike Zimmer said he could have named countless players he worried about before he ever imagined Marshawn Kneeland would be in crisis. Greg Ellis called Marshawn Kneeland a second son. He was watching on Monday as Marshawn Kneeland scored his touchdown off a blocked punt.Greg Ellis said walking back into the locker room next week, seeing Marshawn Kneeland’s locker, and feeling that missing presence will hit the team again. Both coaches pointed out how difficult the timing is because the Dallas Cowboys are spread out during the bye week.Tampa Bay Buccaneers wide receiver Sterling Shepard said, “It hurts your heart… this is the real-life stuff people go through.”San Francisco 49ers defensive lineman Solomon Thomas, who lost his sister to suicide, wrote, “I wish you knew it was going to be OK… I wish you knew how bad we wanted you to stay.”Fans gathered at The Star, leaving candles, flowers, and handwritten signs. Some had met him after Monday Night Football and said the loss felt personal.Marshawn Kneeland’s agent, Jonathan Perzley of Sportstars, posted his own statement:“I am shattered to confirm that my client and dearest friend Marshawn Kneeland passed away last night.”He added, “I watched him fight his way from a hopeful kid at Western Michigan with a dream to being a respected professional for the Dallas Cowboys. Marshawn poured his heart into every snap, every practice, and every moment on the field.”The Marshawn Kneeland mental health conversation is not new inside the league. The NFL and NFLPA mandated in 2019 that every team must have a licensed behavioral health clinician. The Indianapolis Colts launched “Kicking The Stigma” in 2020. Former Philadelphia Eagles star Brian Dawkins spoke publicly about his own depression and suicidal thoughts during his Hall of Fame induction.Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott lost his brother Jace to suicide in 2020. Defensive tackle Solomon Thomas lost his sister Ella in 2018. Marshawn Kneeland’s death has reopened those wounds. The NFL has more resources than ever, but this tragedy shows gaps that still exist.No one is guessing. The facts are confirmed. The reaction is real. The grief is everywhere. And the Marshawn Kneeland mental health conversation will not go away, because it cannot go away.Green Bay Packers linebacker Micah Parsons spoke for the first time on Friday about the death of Dallas Cowboys defensive lineman Marshawn Kneeland. The Marshawn Kneeland mental health conversation continues to ripple across the league, and Parsons made it clear that his former teammate’s family will not face this alone.Parsons and Marshawn Kneeland played together last season in Dallas. He described Kneeland as someone who brought respect and ease into the locker room.“Marshawn’s a guy who loved his anime, loved his video games, like anybody else,” Parsons said. “To me, he always showed me nothing but respect from the moment he came into the locker room.”Parsons said the loss has hit him harder than he expected.“He respected me as a player. He respected me as a person, so I have nothing but high respect for him. If there’s anything his family needs, I’ll be the first person to help or offer anything I can. I just hope that he finds his peace and his family finds his peace in the situation.”As Parsons prepares for Monday Night Football against the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 10, he said he is still processing the news.“I would say I was extremely shocked. I was extremely hurt by the news. Anyone I know, I don’t want to see anyone go this soon at this age. I don’t want anyone to go, but that’s kind of the reality.”Parsons ended by reflecting on how moments like this force players to confront their own fears, especially as parents.“I think the first key is accepting. I kind of accept it, but now I just gotta pray he finds his peace and what he was looking for. How he felt in that moment, you just really don’t know. For me, I have kids. How do I make sure my kids don’t end up in that similar situation?”","Dallas Cowboys defensive end Marshawn Kneeland died Wednesday night at 24.

"Gisele Bündchen implied that prioritizing Tom Brady for years took a personal toll: “When you love someone, you don’t put them in jail”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/gisele-bndchen-implied-that-prioritizing-tom-brady-for-years-took-a-personal-toll-when-you-love-someone-you-dont-put-them-in-jail/articleshow/125033119.cms,"Supermodel Gisele Bündchen, in a candid interview, shared insights into her marriage with Tom Brady, describing their split as a 'death and rebirth.' She detailed her journey of shifting from supporting her partner's career to rediscovering her own dreams and defining personal success. Bündchen emphasizes her graciousness towards Brady, highlighting her focus on authenticity and fulfillment in her new chapter.

The shifting balance between support, career and self-fulfillment

Moving from high-stakes partnership to reinventing life on her own terms





In her March 2023 interview with Vanity Fair, supermodel Gisele Bündchen opened up about her 13-year marriage to former NFL quarterback Tom Brady, how their lives evolved, and what she discovered in the space that followed. While details of their split had played out in headlines, Bündchen offered fresh context and a more nuanced perspective.Bündchen admitted that “It’s like a death and a rebirth,” and described her own shift from supporting a partner’s career to rediscovering her personal dreams. Her reflections reveal not just a high-profile breakup, but a woman reclaiming her voice and defining success on her own terms.When Gisele Bündchen met Tom Brady at age 26, she said she was “so ready” for family and partnership. Traditionally one of the world’s highest-earning models, she gradually scaled back her runway work after 2015 to support the family life they were building.Gisele Bündchen describes relocating to Tampa without ever having lived there before: “When we moved to Tampa, I actually had never been there before. I just arrived and that was my life.” Yet despite her enormous success, much of the public narrative painted her as “against football” or overshadowed by Brady’s career, a portrayal she calls “very hurtful” and “the craziest thing I’ve ever heard.”She underscores that marriage didn’t unravel overnight. “That takes years to happen.” As she puts it: “Sometimes you grow together; sometimes you grow apart … When you love someone, you don’t put them in a jail and say, ‘You have to live this life.’ You set them free to be who they are.”Gisele Bündchen's message: supporting someone doesn’t mean losing yourself, and that truth became clearer to her as her kids grew and her dreams quietly changed.Today, Gisele Bündchen speaks of her next act in Costa Rica, building a home, raising her children, and exploring wellness and nature far from red carpets. She asserts, “I have my own dreams.”While Brady continued his historic career, Bündchen’s focus shifted inward. She embraced spiritual practices, daily rituals, and the idea that success is not just professional acclaim but authenticity and fulfillment. She says the breakup felt like both a loss and a liberation, “I believed in fairy tales when I was a kid. I think it’s beautiful to believe in that.”Bündchen's reflection on Brady is remarkably gracious. “Listen, I have always cheered for him, and I would continue forever … If there’s one person I want to be the happiest in the world, it’s him.”In doing so, Bündchen rejects reductive headlines and stereotypes, choosing instead to present a fuller picture of love, change and self-discovery. As she said, “What’s been said is one piece of a much bigger puzzle. It’s not so black and white.”In the end, this isn’t a story solely of one of fashion’s biggest icons stepping aside. It’s the story of a woman stepping forward, redefining what a chapter ends and a new one begins.Also Read: Gisele Bündchen’s post divorce evolution raises question: did Tom Brady underestimate what letting her go would cost him?","Supermodel Gisele Bündchen opened up about her 13-year marriage to former NFL quarterback Tom Brady.

Seattle Mariners catcher Cal Raleigh shared a deeply emotional post for his teammate Logan Gilbert after the pitcher and his wife Aviles welcomed their first child earlier this week. The couple became parents to a baby boy named Henry Strider Gilbert, a moment that quickly became one of the most celebrated off-field highlights in the baseball community. The Mariners announced the joyful news through their official account, writing, “Join us in congratulating the Gilberts on welcoming the newest member to their family, Henry Strider Gilbert!” Fans and fellow players flooded the comments with warm wishes, celebrating the new parents.Raleigh, who shares a strong personal bond with Gilbert, responded in the most heartfelt way. On Friday, he first shared a photo of Gilbert gently holding his newborn son with the caption “Unbelievable 🤍.” The image, capturing Gilbert’s proud smile and baby Henry’s tiny presence, spread warmth across social media. Soon after, Raleigh reposted the Mariners’ announcement and added a simple but moving five-word message — “Can’t wait to meet him.” Those few words were enough to melt hearts online, showing the deep friendship between the two teammates.For fans, Raleigh’s emotional gesture wasn’t just about a teammate’s celebration — it was about connection, empathy, and family. It reminded people that even in the high-pressure world of professional sports, moments of simple human joy resonate far more deeply than stats or standings. Raleigh and Gilbert’s friendship has been forged through years of playing side by side — from catching sessions to clutch postseason wins — and now, it extends to life’s most personal milestones.Both players were crucial in Seattle’s 2025 postseason run, where the team finished atop the AL West, powered past the Detroit Tigers in the ALDS, and battled the Toronto Blue Jays in the ALCS. Their partnership on the mound and at the plate has long been one of the Mariners’ quiet strengths — built on trust, respect, and understanding. Off the field, Raleigh’s reaction to Gilbert’s fatherhood only deepened that image of unity.As fans continue to share the story, Raleigh’s heartfelt message stands out as a reminder that beyond the home runs and fastballs, it’s the bonds between players — and the emotions they share — that truly melt hearts.Also read: “Play with me”: Shohei Ohtani’s heartfelt words to Miguel Rojas after game-changing World Series home run win hearts online",Seattle Mariners catcher Cal Raleigh shared a touching post for his teammate Logan Gilbert.

LaMelo Ball’s Injury Status vs the Miami Heat (November 7, 2025)

Hornets Facing Depth Issues Amid Multiple Injuries

Tough Test Against the Short-Handed Heat

The’ hopes of turning their season around took another hit ahead of their November 7, 2025 matchup against the Miami Heat, as star point guardwas officially ruled out due to a right ankle impingement. This marks at least the third consecutive game Ball has missed, continuing a frustrating stretch that dates back to last season. Despite undergoing offseason surgery meant to stabilize the ankle, the lingering discomfort has resurfaced, raising concerns about his long-term durability and recovery timeline.For the Charlotte Hornets, Ball’s absence couldn’t come at a worse time. The team has struggled to find consistent rhythm on both ends of the floor, and losing their offensive engine only deepens the challenge. Ball’s unique blend of playmaking flair, scoring, and leadership has been the foundation of Charlotte’s attack since his arrival in the league. Without him, the Hornets’ offensive flow and tempo take a noticeable hit, forcing secondary players to assume bigger roles under difficult circumstances.LaMelo Ball’s ankle injury remains a recurring concern that has carried over from previous seasons. Even after undergoing surgery in the summer to correct the problem, he continues to experience setbacks. The Charlotte Hornets have listed him as doubtful and later marked him questionable for the Miami clash, but ultimately, medical staff decided to keep him sidelined for precautionary reasons.As of now, there is no clear timetable for his return, which has left both fans and analysts uncertain about when the young star will take the court again.Before the injury, LaMelo Ball was performing at an elite level, averaging 23.3 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 9.8 assists per game. Those numbers highlight how essential he is to Charlotte’s offensive system, often serving as both the primary scorer and playmaker. His ability to control the pace, create open looks for teammates, and score efficiently made him the heartbeat of the Charlotte Hornets’ offense.LaMelo Ball isn’t the only Hornets player unavailable for the Heat matchup. Charlotte’s injury report is stacked with key names, including Brandon Miller (shoulder injury), Collin Sexton (neck strain), Josh Green (shoulder surgery), and Grant Williams (knee surgery). These absences have stretched the Charlotte Hornets’ depth thin, forcing coach Steve Clifford to experiment with lineups and rotations.In Ball’s absence, the offensive duties fall primarily on guards like Tre Mann and Collin Sexton - when healthy - to facilitate plays and create scoring opportunities. However, without their lead playmaker, Charlotte’s ball movement and spacing have often suffered, resulting in inconsistent offensive performances.The Miami Heat are also missing key players, with Bam Adebayo and Tyler Herro sidelined due to injuries. Still, Miami’s defensive discipline and veteran leadership make them a tough opponent, especially for a Hornets squad lacking cohesion. Without Ball’s vision and creativity, Charlotte’s scoring options are limited, and the pressure mounts on role players to deliver.Also read: Charlotte Hornets vs Miami Heat regular season game: Full injury report, who's out, and more (November 7, 2025) As the Charlotte Hornets prepare for the matchup, the uncertainty surrounding LaMelo Ball’s recovery continues to cast a shadow over their early-season ambitions.

Fans remain hopeful that their young star will recover soon, but the current outlook remains cautiously pessimistic as the team navigates another stretch without its leader on the court.","Charlotte Hornets star point guard LaMelo Ball has been ruled out due to a right ankle impingement.

Richie Adubato’s cause of death



Dick Vitale mourns longtime friend and fellow “Jersey Boy”



The basketball world is mourning the loss of Richie Adubato, a respected figure whose career spanned decades across the NBA , WNBA, and broadcasting. The former Orlando Magic coach and longtime radio analyst passed away Thursday at the age of 87, his family confirmed on social media Friday. Known for his quick wit, deep knowledge of the game, and passion for teaching, Adubato’s impact reached far beyond the sidelines.Across his six-decade career, Adubato earned a reputation as one of basketball’s most genuine and energetic minds. From guiding NBA locker rooms to mentoring WNBA players and entertaining fans behind the mic, he brought an infectious enthusiasm to everything he did. His passing leaves a significant void in the sport, especially among those who witnessed his kindness and humor firsthand.The cause of death of Richie Adubato has not been revealed as of yet. It is possible that the former Magic coach passed away due to old age. The Orlando Magic organization was among the first to pay tribute to the late coach. “The DeVos family and the Orlando Magic are saddened to learn of the passing of Richie Adubato,” the team said in a statement. “Richie’s legacy lives on in every story and lesson he shared — a coach who turned the gym into a place of connection and joy, impacting countless lives with warmth, humor, and unforgettable spirit.Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Carol, and the entire Adubato family.”Adubato joined the Magic as an assistant coach in 1994 before stepping in as interim head coach in 1997. He later became a fan favorite as the team’s radio analyst from 2005 to 2020, where his insights and storytelling became part of the franchise’s identity.Before his Magic tenure, Adubato coached the Detroit Pistons, New York Knicks, Dallas Mavericks, and Cleveland Cavaliers, as well as WNBA teams like the New York Liberty and Washington Mystics. His career path reflected his lifelong dedication to the game — from high school gyms in New Jersey to professional arenas across the country.Among those deeply affected by his passing was ESPN legend Dick Vitale, who shared a heartfelt tribute online. “Today my dear friend RICHIE ADUBATO passed away. Richie was one of our ‘JERSEY BOYS’ along with @MikeFratello Hubie Brown & yours truly who all chased dreams in coaching. Richie coached on every level – HS -College- @NBA. He’ll be missed but never forgotten. May Richie RIP!” Vitale wrote on X.The two shared a bond that stretched back to their New Jersey coaching roots in the 1960s. When Vitale joined the Detroit Pistons, he brought Adubato on as an assistant, marking the start of a friendship grounded in mutual respect and love for basketball.Also Read: Megan Thee Stallion receives heartfelt apology from boyfriend Klay Thompson after airport pickup mishap","Richie Adubato passed away Thursday at the age of 87.

The Denver Broncos might have scraped by with a narrow 10-7 victory over the Las Vegas Raiders, but the win didn’t come without its share of drama. Bo Nix, the star quarterback leading Denver’s charge this season, found himself at the center of attention for all the wrong reasons. Struggling through a rough outing, Nix completed just 16 of 28 passes for 150 yards, one touchdown, and two interceptions while losing yardage on the ground. As frustration built in the Mile High crowd, boos echoed through the stadium. Still, the young quarterback took it in stride, saying afterward, “I’ve been booed before. I’ll be booed again.”While Nix weathered criticism on the field, his wife, Izzy Nix, was the real star off it. On Friday, Izzy posted photos with her husband where her massive wedding ring caught the spotlight—literally shining as brightly as her support for Bo. Her post, both radiant and defiant, subtly reminded fans that behind every quarterback under pressure, there’s often someone quietly cheering them on. Despite the rough night, the Broncos are now 8-2 and comfortably sitting atop the AFC West. As the saying goes, winning cures everything in the NFL Izzy Nix, born on October 18, 1998, in Birmingham, Alabama, grew up with three siblings—Millie, Abbie, and Luke. A lifelong athlete, she spent 14 years as a gymnast before turning her energy toward cheerleading and basketball at Evangel Christian School. At Auburn University, fate intervened when she met Bo Nix, then the Tigers’ quarterback. “This guy is a true blessing lemme tell ya!!!! one year of knowing him and everyday gets sweeter 🤍,” Izzy wrote in 2021, capturing the essence of their budding romance.The couple’s story blossomed quickly. Bo proposed at Auburn’s Jordan-Hare Stadium in 2021, writing, “I knew from the first moment I laid eyes on you that you were special... I cannot wait to be your husband.” They tied the knot in a heartfelt Alabama ceremony the following year. Today, as they await their first child, Izzy continues to be Bo’s biggest cheerleader.Even when the crowd turns on her husband, Izzy’s light doesn’t dim—it only shines brighter.","Denver Broncos quarterback Bo Nix was booed during a game against the Las Vegas Raiders.

Jayden Daniels could return this season after elbow injury scare



More NFL coverage

Washington Commanders fans finally got a reason to breathe easier on Friday. Star quarterback Jayden Daniels received encouraging news regarding his left elbow injury that had caused widespread concern earlier in the week. Head coach Dan Quinn confirmed that Daniels will not require surgery after an MRI revealed no ligament damage. “It’ll knock him out for a while,” Quinn said, but crucially, the team will not be placing Daniels on injured reserve. That decision keeps the door open for a possible return later this season — a glimmer of hope for a struggling 3-6 Commanders team.Daniels, reportedly “feeling a little sore,” suffered the injury during last Sunday’s 37-6 loss to the Seattle Seahawks. Late in the fourth quarter, while still fighting to make plays despite the lopsided score, he was spun around on a tackle and landed awkwardly on his non-throwing arm. The sight of teammates surrounding him as trainers applied a temporary cast painted a grim picture. But after multiple medical evaluations, the outlook has turned unexpectedly positive. The Commanders will re-evaluate Daniels after their Week 12 bye, suggesting he could see action again this year.For the Commanders, this update is more than a health report — it’s a lifeline. Losing Daniels long-term would have been a devastating blow to a team already fighting to regain its footing after a slow start. The reigning NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year has faced his share of setbacks this season, including earlier knee and hamstring issues, but his impact when healthy is undeniable. Washington went 12-5 last year with Daniels at the helm, a stark contrast to this season’s 3-6 record.Backup Marcus Mariota has stepped in admirably, going 1-2 as a starter, but the offense clearly misses Daniels’ dual-threat ability and leadership. With upcoming games against the Lions and Dolphins before the bye, Washington hopes to stay within striking distance of the playoff race. Even though their postseason chances appear slim, the potential return of Daniels could inject fresh energy into a weary locker room.For now, the Commanders are counting small victories — and keeping faith that Jayden Daniels, the heart of their offense, might yet script another comeback before the season ends.","Washington Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels will not require surgery on his elbow.

Donald Trump attending Lions vs Commanders comes during a politically charged salute to service weekend

More coverage on NFL:

Donald Trump attending an NFL game, in person, is something that instantly changes the storylines around a regular season matchup. And whether people approve, dislike, or simply want to ignore the political overlap, it’s impossible to pretend this is a routine Sunday headline. Trump isn’t just another celebrity showing up for a suite photo-op.He’s the US president who once went toe-to-toe with the NFL’s most powerful executives, called the league “weak,” fought against ownership decisions, and even tried to buy a team. Now, he is returning in a moment where the league is celebrating service and the nation is in the middle of a shutdown that has directly affected military involvement.Pat McAfee broke the headline on his show, claiming: “sources are telling me President Donald Trump will be in attendance for the Washington Commanders game this Sunday afternoon.” The expectation is he will sit in Josh Harris’ suite during the halftime Veterans Celebration. The entire Salute to Service week carries a different tone. With the government shutdown restricting Pentagon participation, fans are stepping into a Sunday that feels heavier and now undeniably more political.Earlier this year, Donald Trump attacked the new kickoff rule, saying: “Sissy football is bad for America, and bad for the NFL!” This weekend is his chance to see that rule at eye-level, as Detroit (5-3) faces Washington (3-6) in a game that could swing NFC wild card math.For Washington, it’s a season identity check. For Donald Trump, it’s an optimistic moment. And the NFL knows, whether he offers commentary or stays silent, every camera in that stadium will know where he is sitting.This isn’t simply a president watching football. It is a reminder that, no matter how much fans try to keep sports separate, politics finds its way into the stadium, into the optics, and into every camera shot that follows.","Former President Donald Trump will attend the Lions vs. Commanders game.

Filip Hallander’s blood clot diagnosis shocks Penguins fans



More NHL coverage

The Pittsburgh Penguins have been flying high to start the 2025–26 season, but the team’s momentum hit a painful bump with unsettling news surrounding forward Filip Hallander. The 25-year-old winger, who had finally begun carving out a steady NHL role, has been diagnosed with a blood clot that will keep him off the ice for at least three months. The organization confirmed that Hallander will undergo rehabilitation in Pittsburgh, working closely with the Penguins’ medical staff and doctors from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center to ensure a full recovery.The timing couldn’t be worse for Hallander. After years of bouncing between Sweden and the AHL, he had secured his place on the Penguins’ active roster, appearing in 13 games this season—already the most in his NHL career. During that stretch, he registered one goal and three assists, showing steady growth as a bottom-six forward. His two-way game, energy, and resilience had begun earning him praise from fans and teammates alike. Now, his progress faces an unexpected pause.According to the team, Hallander’s blood clot was discovered following a practice session earlier this week. He had participated in Monday’s matchup against the Toronto Maple Leafs and was seen practicing on Wednesday but left early, raising concern.Initially, head coach Dan Muse labeled him as “day-to-day with an undisclosed issue,” but further tests confirmed the serious diagnosis. The Penguins later revealed that Hallander would be sidelined “for a minimum of three months,” a timeline that could extend depending on his recovery.The setback means Hallander could miss action until after the Olympic break in Italy, cutting short what was shaping up to be a breakthrough campaign. A second-round pick in 2018, Hallander had returned to Pittsburgh this season after two strong years with Timra IK in Sweden, hoping to solidify his NHL future.For the Penguins, this injury adds to a growing list of absences that threaten to test their depth. Yet, there’s optimism that once Hallander fully recovers, he can resume his upward trajectory. With the medical care he’s receiving and his determination to return stronger, Hallander remains very much a name to watch in Pittsburgh’s future.",Pittsburgh Penguins forward Filip Hallander has been diagnosed with a blood clot. The 25-year-old Swede is expected to be sidelined for at least three months.

The Kansas City Chiefs are in the middle of a painful reset week and not just because Patrick Mahomes is coming off a rare touchdown-less performance. Kansas City’s QB1 is regrouping, refocusing, and trying to recalibrate an offense that suddenly looks uneven.But while conversations around the Chiefs have been dominated by red-zone issues, missed opportunities, and Mahomes admitting “I got to be better,” there’s another Mahomes headline hitting at the exact same time, one that has nothing to do with football mechanics.

A Battle of Momentum at Fiserv Forum

Thereceived a huge boost ahead of their NBA Cup matchup against the Chicago Bulls on November 7, 2025, as superstar. This update comes as a relief for Bucks fans who were concerned after the Greek Freak dealt with left knee soreness in recent days. With his name officially removed from the injury list, Giannis is set to lead Milwaukee in a must-win clash against a red-hot Bulls team that currently sits atop the Eastern Conference with a 6-1 record.This game is shaping up to be one of the standout fixtures of the NBA Cup group stage, featuring two franchises with contrasting trajectories. The Bucks are looking to regain momentum after a recent loss to the Toronto Raptors, while the Bulls have been one of the league’s early-season surprises, combining solid defense with balanced scoring. Having Giannis back on the floor gives Milwaukee the competitive edge they need to keep pace with their conference rivals.Giannis Antetokounmpo has been nothing short of dominant this season, averaging 32.3 points, 12.6 rebounds, and 6.3 assists per game. His performance continues to solidify his reputation as one of the most impactful players in the NBA. The Milwaukee Bucks will rely heavily on his leadership and all-around game, especially considering their current injury situation.Despite the good news surrounding Giannis, the Bucks will be missing other key contributors. Kevin Porter Jr. is out after undergoing surgery on his right knee, and Taurean Prince remains sidelined with a neck strain. These absences could shorten Milwaukee’s rotation, making Giannis Antetokounmpo’s presence even more vital to the team’s success.The Chicago Bulls enter the matchup in excellent form but are also dealing with health setbacks. Star guard Coby White has been ruled out, while Ayo Dosunmu’s availability remains uncertain. Even so, the Bulls’ depth has shined this season, with standout performances from Josh Giddey and Nikola Vucevic helping Chicago maintain its strong early record. The Bulls’ combination of youth and experience has created a winning formula, but missing White could test their offensive rhythm against a resilient Bucks squad.Tonight’s showdown promises intensity, as both teams aim to solidify their positions in the NBA Cup standings. The Milwaukee Bucks, led by a determined Giannis Antetokounmpo, will look to bounce back on their home court at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

Cam Thomas’ sudden setback forced the Brooklyn Nets to rethink its strategies in a early-season twist

Due to an injury to the same problematic left hamstring that destroyed the previous season, Cam Thomas, the Brooklyn Nets ' top scorer was forced to miss Wednesday night's 112-103 victory over the Indiana Pacers. With 6:46 remaining in the first quarter against the Pacers, Thomas missed a 15-foot stepback jumper, seemingly hurting himself on the landing.Cam Thomas was later classified as OUT by the team prior to tonight's game against the Detroit Pistons. He was sidelined indefinitely as a result of the setback, in addition to being out for the rest of the match. The great shooting guard may face future difficulties after re-injuring the same hamstring that prevented him from playing in 59 games the previous season.Cam Thomas, who recently sustained a hamstring injury, will be missing from Brooklyn. Even though he will be missed, this might be the ideal chance for the rookies. Thomas had a great start to the season prior to the injury , averaging 21.4 points on 40.2% field goal and 35.6% three-point shooting.However, in his eight starts, he has only contributed 2.6 assists per game, which is indicative of his ongoing scoring-first role.Even so, Thomas has been making every effort to enjoy playing basketball some more.Thomas may miss Friday's game against the Detroit Pistons , and the team will reevaluate him on Thursday, according to head coach Jordi Fernandez. Although it's regrettable that Brooklyn's 23-year-old star might not be playing, this presents a chance that the team should take advantage of right away.His absence comes at the worst possible moment for the Nets. With Drake Powell and Ben Saraf out for tonight's game, the squad has already suffered several blows to its depth. Brooklyn still lacks a starting point guard who can reliably move the ball within the offence without Thomas.The Brooklyn Nets now have a number in the victory column that is greater than zero. On Wednesday night, the Nets defeated the Indiana Pacers 112-103 to secure their first victory of the season away from home.For a team that had its worst start in ten years, it was a breath of relief. Brooklyn is rebuilding, so dropping games makes sense. Now, they are ready for their upcoming matches, with or without Thomas.Also read: Is Cam Thomas playing?

How Connor McDavid's wife Lauren Kyle’s bold interior design identity is redefining what an NHL power couple looks like,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/how-connor-mcdavids-wife-lauren-kyles-bold-interior-design-identity-is-redefining-what-an-nhl-power-couple-looks-like/articleshow/125149911.cms,"Lauren Kyle, fiancée of NHL star Connor McDavid, is redefining the role of athletes' partners. She's built a powerful personal brand centered on sophisticated home design, proving WAGs can be influential entrepreneurs. Kyle's approach challenges traditional NHL masculinity, pushing the league towards a more modern, visually driven era and establishing herself as a significant market voice.

Lauren Kyle’s brand narrative reflects the shift toward design-led, CEO-style WAGs rather than just “player wives”





More coverage on NHL:

There was a time when the partners of pro athletes were barely seen, rarely quoted, and almost never included in the marketing conversation, especially in the NHL, which historically hosts one of the most “closed doors, keep it all quiet” cultures in North American sports. But Lauren Kyle, the fiancée of Edmonton Oilers superstar Connor McDavid , doesn’t exist in that old template.She’s not an accessory. She is the architect of a personal brand that leans into design, refinement, and highly curated home aesthetics. The conversations around her work have been loud, polarizing, and surprisingly influential. And now, she’s becoming a case study in how WAG entrepreneurship can shape cultural direction, not just add gloss to a player’s fame.Lauren Kyle’s rise isn’t simply about the “white and metallic house” moment that went viral. It’s the fact that she doubled down, she didn’t run from the discourse. She recast the reaction as proof that her vision evokes emotion. And in a luxury economy, emotion sells.Modern NHL fans tend to assume hockey culture = traditional masculinity + limited visual references. But Kyle is pushing an entirely different energy, magazine spreads, reflective surfaces, lifestyle-forward execution, and design-first storytelling.And that is exactly why her entrepreneurial trajectory matters. She isn’t evolving alongside the NHL brand, she’s dragging parts of the league into a more visually modern era with her.And it also reframes McDavid’s public image: not just athlete, but cultural architecture subject. Today, when people say things like “Lauren Kyle has an aesthetic,” that’s not gossip, that’s branding evidence. It means she has moved from a partner role to a market voice.Her message isn’t subtle: hockey wives aren’t background props anymore. Lauren Kyle is shaping the stage itself and the NHL has never seen a design-forward power couple quite like this.","Lauren Kyle, fiancée of NHL star Connor McDavid, is redefining the role of athletes' partners.

Trigger warning:

Dak Prescott lost his older brother Jace to suicide and now his defensive end Marshawn Kneeland to apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound

More news on Dallas Cowboys:

This story contains references to suicide.Three days ago, Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott ’s teammate Marshawn Kneeland, the 24-year-old defensive end scored his first career touchdown of the 2025 season. Now, the world is reeling from the devastating news of Kneeland’s death, reportedly from a self-inflicted gunshot wound after a police chase. Frisco police said they were called to locate a vehicle that had evaded officers during a pursuit. They found the car crashed on the southbound Dallas Parkway near Warren Parkway. Officers said Kneeland had fled the scene. As police were searching for him, they were informed that he had “expressed suicidal ideations.” At 1:31 AM, they found him “deceased with what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound.” The Collin County Medical Examiner’s Office will determine the official cause of death.Heartfelt tributes poured in after his tragic passing. Among them was the quarterback who had lost his defensive end. He spoke about Kneeland with CBS Sports Texas at his alma mater, Haughton High School, during a special field dedication ceremony.“It’s been a very tough day,” Dak Prescott said. “As you said, it started early this morning, finding out the news—tragic loss. I hurt. Heavy, heavy heart today. I hurt for Marshawn. I hurt for his family. I’m hurt for his girlfriend. I hurt for every single one of my teammates. This is a pain that you don’t wish upon anybody. You wish none of us had to go through this. You wish Marshawn didn’t have to go through what he had went through. And just thankful for each moment we have in this life. And don’t take it for granted, and hug and love those that you do. It’s okay to feel however you’re feeling. And I’ll tell you, first and foremost, I don’t always have the answers and today is not a day that I felt like I had answers.”“Triggering day for many reasons,” Prescott said. “On top of just knowing that I had today, and hard to balance my emotions today and not have a day that I have words other than I love you for friends and families, and people who may be struggling.

Prescott appeared as a guest on “In Depth with Graham Bensinger.”“Honestly, a couple of days before my brother passed, I started experiencing depression,” Prescott said. “I didn’t know what I was going through, to say the least, and hadn’t been sleeping well at all. But for one night, I sleep the best I’ve slept, missing ten-plus calls from (my brother) and giving my dad enough time to come in my bedroom and tell me what had happened. So, I woke up after the best night of sleep I’ve had in 2020 from the worst news, some of the worst news I’ll ever get. ”He recalled receiving the news from his father. “I mean, obviously, there were tears and tears and tears,” he told Besinger. “I sat there and tried to process what had happened and wanted to ask why for so many reasons...and as much as you want to ask why, I know my brother, and he had a lot of burdens on him.”The burdens he mentioned were linked to their mother’s colon cancer treatment, with Jace as her primary caregiver. They lost their mother, Peggy Prescott, in November 2013. After his brother’s passing, Prescott and his other brother, Tad, promised to be more open with each other.","Dak Prescott lost his older brother Jace to suicide and now his defensive end Marshawn Kneeland to apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. “It’s been a very tough day,” Dak Prescott said.

Buffalo Sabres stunned as Rasmus Dahlin takes personal leave,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/buffalo-sabres-stunned-as-rasmus-dahlin-takes-personal-leave/articleshow/125171976.cms,"Rasmus Dahlin (Image Via Twitter)

How the Buffalo Sabres will adjust Without their Captain on the Ice



The Buffalo Sabres are getting ready to go without their captain and mainstay on defense, Rasmus Dahlin, who has left the team for an unspecified period for personal reasons. The team made the announcement on Friday that Dahlin will be away while he returns home to Sweden to be with his fiancée, Carolina Matovac. The 25-year-old defenseman has been a consistent contributor to Buffalo's defense this season, with nine points in 14 games, but now the focus understandably shifts from hockey to family.Dahlin's choice coincides with a very personal and emotional story in his life. Matovac, suffering from sudden heart failure in summer, needed emergency CPR, life support, and finally a heart transplant. She has been recuperating in Sweden while Dahlin has been in North America to start the NHL season. The Athletic's Matthew Fairburn reports that Sabres coach Lindy Ruff has revealed that Matovac's condition is stable and the whole team is behind Dahlin's move. Ruff added, ""I don’t think you can describe it. I don’t think you can feel what he’s feeling. I’m very passionate about the fact that no one would want to walk in his shoes and have dealt with what he dealt with. He has the support of everybody on this.""With Dahlin gone, Buffalo will have to make adjustments both in terms of playing style and atmosphere in the locker room. His absence as captain and one of the best defensemen in the NHL creates a huge gap in both leadership and playmaking.It is anticipated that defensemen Owen Power and Mattias Samuelsson will take the extra defensive workload during Dahlin's leave of absence, as the Sabres will try to remain competitive. Ruff might also depend to a greater extent on inexperienced defensemen in the areas of keeping the puck and changing the play, which will be a challenge that can uncover maturity and depth in Buffalo’s young core that is already going through an emotional period.The Sabres are now looking at the picture beyond just victories and defeats. The number one thing on their list is to continue taking care of Dahlin and his family till the latter is able to come back — something that even in top-level sports, there are instances that are more than just the match.More coverage on NHL","Rasmus Dahlin will be away while he returns home to Sweden to be with his fiancée, Carolina Matovac.

Manjurul denies allegations as 'baseless'

The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) announced on Thursday that it will establish a committee to investigate allegations made by fast bowler Jahanara Alam regarding inappropriate behaviour by a former selector during the 2022 ODI World Cup. The board has given the committee 15 working days to submit its findings and recommendations, demonstrating its commitment to addressing the serious nature of these allegations.Jahanara Alam, who currently resides in Australia, revealed in an interview with journalist Riasad Azim that a former selector, who served as both selector and manager of the women's team, behaved inappropriately towards her. She specifically mentioned that the individual asked her lewd questions during their interactions.""I faced several times (indecent proposal), not once. Definitely, when we are involved with the team, we cannot speak out about many things, even if we want to. When it comes to your bread and butter, when you are known by a few people, you cannot say or protest many things even if you want to,"" Jahanara told Azim's YouTube channel.The fast bowler, who has represented Bangladesh in 135 matches, also alleged that multiple BCB officials acted inappropriately with her.She stated that she had reported these incidents to former BCB director Shafiul Islam Nadel and the board's chief executive Nizamuddin Chowdhury.""In 2021, Towhid Bhai approached me through Babu Bhai (Coordinator Sarfaraz Babu). I've said this many times before. I don't know why they misbehaved with me. I tried hard to stay quiet and focus on cricket. But when I tactfully avoided the proposal, Manju Bhai began humiliating and insulting me from the very next day,"" Jahanara said in the video.""Towhid Bhai never spoke to me directly - he sent Babu Bhai instead. After about a year and a half, I submitted an 'Observation Letter' to the CEO, not a complaint, explaining everything. Babu Bhai had told me to 'look after Towhid Sir,' but I replied, 'He's the in-charge, what is there for me to look after?' I deliberately pretended not to understand the proposal. I'm sharing this so that other girls can also protect themselves this way. That's when Manju Bhai's bad behaviour started.""""The second proposal came from Manju Bhai during the 2022 World Cup. I decided to inform the BCB about everything that had happened over the past year and a half. I told Nadel Sir several times - he'd offer a temporary fix, but soon things went back to the same. I even informed the CEO.""Jahanara revealed that Manjurul had the tendency of getting too close to female players. Many of them started avoiding him because of this habit.""During our pre-camp, while I was bowling, he came up and placed his hand on my shoulder. He had a habit of pulling girls close, pressing them to his chest, and talking near their ears. We used to avoid him - even during handshakes after matches, we would extend our hands from a distance so he couldn't pull us in. Among ourselves, we'd joke nervously, 'He's coming, he'll hug us again.'""Narrating an incident, Jahanara said that the former selector came too close and asked about her period cycle.""Once he came near me, held my hand, put his arm on my shoulder, leaned close to my ear, and asked, 'How many days has your period been?' He already knew, since physios track players' cycles for health reasons as per ICC guidelines. I don't know why a manager or selector needed that information. When I said, 'Five days,' he replied, 'Five days? It should've ended yesterday. When your period is over, tell me - I have to look after my side too. ' I just looked at him and said, 'Sorry, Bhaiya, I didn't understand.'""Manjurul has categorically denied these allegations, calling them 'baseless'. ""What can I say apart from terming it as baseless. You can ask other cricketers whether I was good or bad"" Manjurul told Cricbuzz.""It's unfortunate she is dragging a dead man. I just want her to come up with proof instead of making baseless accusations,"" said Babu.""The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has noted with concern the allegations reported in the media made by a former member of the Bangladesh national women's cricket team regarding alleged misconduct by certain individuals associated with the team,"" the BCB stated in their official release.""As the matter is of a sensitive nature, the BCB has decided to form a committee to investigate the allegations thoroughly. The committee will submit its findings and recommendations within 15 working days. The BCB is committed to ensuring a safe, respectful, and professional environment for all its players and personnel. The board takes such matters with utmost seriousness and will take appropriate action based on the findings of the investigation. ""These recent allegations follow Jahanara's previous claims where she accused Bangladesh captain Nigar Sultana of physically abusing her teammates. The BCB had dismissed these earlier allegations as ""baseless.""Jahanara Alam has established herself as a significant player in Bangladesh women's cricket, taking 48 wickets in ODIs and 60 wickets in T20Is throughout her career. Her achievements extend beyond national cricket, as she holds the distinction of being the only Bangladesh player to have participated in both the Women's T20 Challenge in India and the FairBreak Invitational T20.","Jahanara Alam has alleged abuse by ex-Bangladesh selector during the 2022 World Cup. The fast bowler, who has represented Bangladesh in 135 matches, also alleged that multiple BCB officials acted inappropriately with her.

Former Australia captain Steve Waugh calls Virat Kohli the ODI GOAT

Poll Do you think Virat Kohli's calmness has positively impacted his performance? Yes, absolutely No, his aggressiveness is what sets him apart

NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer Mohammad Kaif believes Virat Kohli has become a calmer and more composed cricketer in recent years, crediting his maturity and understanding of the game for the change.Speaking on his YouTube channel, Kaif said he had noticed a clear difference in Kohli ’s approach compared to his early playing days. “Virat Kohli has become a bit calm now. There is a lot of difference between how he was before marriage and how he is after marriage,” Kaif said.Recalling a chat with Kohli during an IPL match, Kaif added that the star batter’s decision-making has evolved. “When I see him playing now… he hit (Kagiso) Rabada for a boundary coming down the ground, maybe he had scored a half-century and won the game. But he was very calm. He told me that if I had not attacked Rabada early on, he would not have let me play. So I wanted to hit him off the first ball,” Kaif said, adding that Kohli’s “understanding of cricket has improved with calmness. ”Kaif, who shared the dressing room with Kohli at Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB), said the 37-year-old’s attitude towards people remains unchanged despite his superstar status.“He still wants to improve his game after having played for so many years.And he still meets me the same way even now. If he called you a brother before, he will call you a brother now as well. When you meet him off the field, he will remember that he has played with you and will give you that respect. There is no change there,” Kaif said.Kohli recently featured in the ODI series against Australia, bouncing back with an unbeaten 74 in the final game after consecutive ducks in the first two matches.Addressing speculation about Kohli’s contract situation with RCB, Kaif said the batter was taking a cautious approach amid ownership changes. “There are rumours that the next season might not have the RCB name. Virat Kohli did not sign the commercial contract as he was waiting to see what direction the new owners would take,” he said.",Mohammad Kaif believes Virat Kohli has become a calmer cricketer in recent years.

Inside details of how PCB chief Mohsin Naqvi ran away with the Asia Cup trophy!

All eyes were on the ICC Board meet in Dubai on Friday as the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) secretary Devajit Saikia was expected to raise the Asia Cup trophy matter. The issue, however, was neither raised at the Chief Executives Committee (CEC) meet earlier this week nor at the Board meet. It wasn't part of any official agenda and never came up for a formal discussion during the last few days in Dubai.It is learnt that there were some informal discussions on the sidelines of the Board meet where Saikia pointed out that India, the winners of 2025 Asia Cup, are yet to get the trophy. While Saikia was representing the Indian cricket board, Mohsin Naqvi represented the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).There was a lot of suspense around Naqvi's attendance for the meet but, as TimesofIndia.com had reported earlier , the PCB chief reached Dubai just an hour before the formal Board meet was to get underway. It is further understood that the Board members had lengthy informal discussions before the official session but Naqvi skipped that as he left for Dubai only on Friday morning. He was scheduled to stay in Dubai overnight and the feeling in the room was that the trophy impasse could end soon.""There were no heated arguments or anything. The matter was brought up during an informal discussion and both PCB and BCCI would work towards resolving it at the earliest.Whether it needs intervention from ICC - by forming a committee or something - is not decided at this stage, but it was all very healthy and cordial,"" says an administrator who attended the meetings in Dubai this week.""Yes there were serious doubts whether Mr Mohsin Naqvi would come for the Board meet but once he came, routine followed and the trophy matter was only discussed on the sidelines,"" he added.TimesofIndia.com reached out to BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia for a comment and the story will be updated the moment he responds.",Mohsin Naqvi reached Dubai just an hour before the formal Board meet was to get underway.
