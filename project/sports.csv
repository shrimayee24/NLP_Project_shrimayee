Hyderabad-Bengaluru Bus Tragedy: 20 Passengers Burnt Alive in Minutes, Andhra CM Naidu Orders Probe

Hyderabad: A journey at the end of a joyful festive weekend turned into a nightmare for passengers aboard the private bus travelling from Hyderabad to Bengaluru. In an instant, the vehicle was engulfed in flames and thick smoke, jolting them awake to a scene of sheer horror.Panic erupted as people scrambled to escape, using whatever they could - mobile phones, laptops, even elbows and knees - to break windows and jump out.For many, the ordeal unfolded in mere seconds but felt like an eternity. Nelakurthi Ramesh, 36, was on his way back to Bengaluru with wife Sri Lakshmi and their two children after visiting relatives over the weekend.Recounting the terrifying moments, he said: ""When I woke up, all I could see was flames - bright yellow and orange. I could barely breathe. My first thought was my wife and children; I knew I had to get them out safely. With my bare fists, I smashed the rear window and pushed my family out of the burning bus. Others followed us, and we ran as far as we could. The next thing I remember was waking up in the hospital.""Ghantasala Subramanyam, 26, a resident of Bahadurpally, was awakened by a fellow passenger's urgent shake. ""Amid the sizzling sound and sight of leaping flames, it took me a moment to process what was happening,"" Subramanyam said.""I grabbed my bag and tried to exit through the main door, only to find it jammed as the fire spread rapidly. I saw someone smashing a window using a laptop, and without hesitation, I jumped out along with 10 others. ""He also recalled the kindness of a stranger driving the same route, who offered to take him and three others to the nearest hospital.The deafening roar of shattering glass and approaching flames left a lasting impression on many. Jayanth Kushwal, 27, who hails from Vidyanagar, said: ""All I remember is people frantically trying to escape. Some smashed the rear windows, others broke the ones by their seats. There were glass shards all around. It was terrifying.""Many survivors described scenes of panic and courage, where instinct overrode fear and the fight for life became paramount.Naveen Kumar, 26, from Hayathnagar said: ""There wasn't a second to think, everything happened instinctively. When I saw someone break the emergency door at the rear, I rushed towards it. In the chaos, I fractured my left leg. Around me, people were trapped, struggling to escape. I couldn't help them, and that haunts me. But, in those moments, there was nothing anyone could do.""","Passengers recall scenes of panic and courage, where instinct overrode fear and the fight for life became paramount.

SRINAGAR: BJP sprang a surprise on National Conference Friday in J&K's first Rajya Sabha election since the abrogation of Article 370 , clinching one of the four seats at stake with 32 votes – four more than its current strength of 28 in the assembly.BJP candidate Sat Sharma's victory came amid allegations of cross-voting by the governing party, which had secured ally Congress's backing and the opposition PDP's conditional support for the election. Supporters of BJP and NC were briefly locked in a confrontation outside the assembly after the results were declared.While NC's victorious trio – Choudhary Mohammad Ramzan, Sajad Ahmad Kichloo and Shammi Oberoi – were expected to win the election at a canter, Sharma's triumph led People's Conference legislator Sajad Lone to label it a ""fixed match"". Lone abstained from voting.""Why did NC poll extra votes for candidate 3? They didn't need to. They polled 31 votes for candidate 3 when 29 would have sufficed. Even 28. That's because BJP was fighting for seat 4. Who cross-voted? Whose votes were rejected? And who was hand-in-glove?"" he said.Sharma, who heads the J&K unit of BJP, thanked all legislators who supported him. On the extra votes he received, the newly elected RS member said he had reached out to everyone, irrespective of party affiliation, and ""appealed to their inner conscience"" to vote for a candidate who would work for the greater good.""They listened to their conscience and voted for me,"" he said.CM Omar Abdullah ruled out cross-voting by anyone from his party. ""All of NC's votes were intact across the four elections, as endorsed by our election agent after seeing each polling slip. So, where did the extra votes of BJP come from? Who were the MLAs who deliberately invalidated their votes by marking a wrong preference number while voting?"" he said.""Do they have the guts to put their hands up and own up to helping BJP after promising us their votes? What pressure or inducement helped them make this choice? Let's see if any of BJP's secret team own up to selling their souls.""Sharma's rival, NC's Imran Nabi Dar, accused BJP of horse-trading. ""They won this seat despite not having the numbers. They might have bought these votes. Those who cross-voted should come forward. Otherwise, we will expose them.""",BJP candidate Sat Sharma's victory came amid allegations of cross-voting by the governing party.

The incident occurred on October 23 aboard flight AI676 from Kolkata to Mumbai.Content creator Mahi Khan , also known as Mahinergy, who posted the video, claimed that a woman co-passenger demanded he speak Marathi because he was travelling to Mumbai. In the now-viral clip, the unidentified woman is heard saying, ""Yes, please do that. You are going to Mumbai, you should know Marathi.""The situation escalated when Khan calmly refused and called the cabin crew for assistance. He alleges the woman then threatened him, saying in Hindi, ""Get down at Mumbai, I'll show you what badtameezi (misbehaviour) is.""In his social media post, Khan wrote: ""This isn't just about me, it's about the mindset that's growing dangerously normal. You cannot force a language. You cannot bully respect.""Several social media users condemned the incident as being against Maharashtrian culture.

“Let the king who desires his prosperity to last long

Be strict when enquiring but mild when punishing.”

KBC

A few days ago, a ten-year-old boy walked into the set ofAs he sat opposite the legendary Amitabh Bachchan, he glowed with excitement and pride. The boy spoke confidently — perhaps a little too much. When Bachchan started to explain the rules, the child interrupted, “Sir, don’t start explaining, I know them.” The audience laughed and clapped, encouraging his spiritedness.As the questions rolled, his quick retorts continued, at times bordering on rudeness. But the applause only spurred him on — until he stumbled at the fourth question and had to return emptyhanded, sooner than expected.When the episode was aired, the internet buzzed with criticism. Social media declared the boy arrogant and ill-mannered, and within hours, he became a national symbol of ‘ parenting gone wrong’.“Today’s parents are too lenient,” some said. What kind of parents should we be — strict, as many of our parents were, or gentle friends who never raise their voices?We are a generation walking a tightrope between control and compassion. We grew up fearing authority but now fear our children ’s displeasure. We want them to be confident but never brash, independent but never defiant.A few years ago, a Class 10 girl from Luxembourg stayed with us on an exchange programme. Over dinner, she said, “Indian children are brilliant in math. But they rarely use the words, or.” Her words lingered long after she left. Have we become a society that celebrates achievement but forgets grace?The challenge of parenting today is not to raise achievers but to raise children who balance pride with humility; EQ with IQ. Confident, not arrogant; obedient, not weak.At times, the elders have different rule books — while the mother urges her child to tidy up after playtime, a loving grandmother intervenes, “He’s just a child, I’ll clean up.” In that moment of indulgence, discipline evaporates.Then there are parents who rush to the school when a teacher scolds the child. In some instances, powerful families get the teacher transferred too. A child insulated from every discomfort grows up defenceless against life.Psychologists call it the: two parents and four grandparents pour love and gifts from six pockets, wrapping the child in a cocoon of indulgence. Such children often grow up with low tolerance for frustration and a fragile sense of entitlement.The Bible says, “He that spareth his rod hateth his son.” The “rod” here is not cruelty — it is guidance, the shepherd’s staff that keeps the sheep from straying too far.Thiruvalluvar, too, saw this truth clearly. In his chapter on righteous governance, he writes:He was advising kings, but he could well have been speaking to parents. He states that extremes do not pay. Be firm when you correct; be soft when you teach. Show the boundary with strength, but walk your child across it with kindness.The age of harsh fathers and fearful silence has passed. Yet if we refrain from correcting, we may hand the task to strangers- a mocking world where lessons come late and hurt more.The young boy onwill learn, in time, the delicate line between confidence and arrogance. Perhaps he has already begun.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’ Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.

Ilja Dragunov vs. Aleister Black

Drew McIntyre vs. Jimmy Uso

WWE SmackDown took place at the Mullett Arena in Tempe, Arizona, this week. The show kicked off to a turbulent start with a brawl and later saw some captivating bouts, including an exciting title match. Moreover, the night also witnessed Jade Cargill unleashing his wrath and finally, a No DQ main event match that ended in a highly physical encounter and chaotic fashion.Cody Rhodes opened the show after a brief backstage talk with Jimmy Uso. As he was about to speak, Drew McIntyre arrived at the scene and berated Rhodes and the fans for supporting his recent actions. As it continued, Uso launched a sneak attack on McIntyre, accusing him of being Jacob Fatu's attacker from last week. The chaos continued until the WWE officials came down to break it up.The first match of the night pitted Tama Tonga and JC Matteo against the new duo of Rey Fenix and Shinsuke Nakamura. While the MFT members brought their dominance and cohesive unit mentality, Fenix and Nakamura combined their different styles to work as a team. However, the final moments saw Solo Sikoa and Talla Tonga interfere. Talla hit a chokeslam on Fenix and Tama followed with a running elbow to score the win for his team.This was a non-title singles match. Kiana James had her client, Giulia, at ringside, who ran interferences during the match. However, Tiffany Stratton was able to hold her own and deliver an excellent match against her opponent. Following a back-and-forth showdown, it was Stratton who picked up the win over James with the Prettiest Moonsault Ever. Giulia attacked her after the match, only for Jade Cargill to arrive to make the save. However, in a shocking moment, Cargill took down the champion and laid a beatdown cementing her heel turn.The new WWE United States Champion, Ilja Dragunov, hosted his first US title open challenge on SmackDown. It was answered by Aleister Black, with his real-life wife, Zelina Vega, by his side. The match was a compelling and intense showdown between both SmackDown rising stars as the star-spangled prize hung in the balance. Moreover, Zelina Vega ran interferences which led to the referee asking her to leave the ringside. Just then, Damian Priest marched down to the ring and took off his glasses to show his damaged eye from Black's fireball attack weeks ago, which distracted him long enough for Dragunov to hit the H bomb on him to retain his title. Priest began attacking Black, only for Vega to intervene and escape with her husband.This was a No Disqualification match for the main event of SmackDown. The stipulation led both men to take action all over the ringside and make use of some foreign objects like tables and chairs. Following a physically battering showdown, the final moments saw Drew McIntyre countering a top rope move by Jimmy Uso by throwing a chair and scoring the win with a Claymore Kick. He tried to further attack Jimmy, only for Cody Rhodes to rush down and aid him. However, the show ended with Rhodes also eating a Claymore at the hands of McIntyre, who stood tall to end the show.Also read: Fact Check: Is the WWE Legend Undertaker really coming to Bigg Boss 19?","WWE SmackDown took place at the Mullett Arena in Tempe, Arizona, this week.

Aaron Gordon says no thank you to taking the game ball home

Aaron Gordon falls victim to ""Steph being Steph""

Aaron Gordon of the Denver Nuggets scored a career-high 50 points on Thursday against the Golden State Warriors, on their visit to the Bay Area. He was also the highest scoring player of the night. Unfortunately, all that hard work did not get his team the win they had hoped for. When he was offered the game ball to take back home, he refused, saying he had no plans of taking an L home. While his personal showcase was spectacular, as a team they fell short against Stephen Curry led Warriors.Aaron Gordon, after scoring a career-high of 50 points against the Golden State Warriors on his team's first match of the season, was offered the game ball. He had definitely earned it, with not just his personal achievement, but also as the highest scoring player of the night. But when asked if he wanted the memento, he refused. In a post-game interview, he said:“They’re asking if I wanted the game ball, and no, I don’t want the game ball to take an L home with me. No thank you.”The match went into overtime after a thrilling game of ball, and fans of both teams looked to be having a gala time, biting their nails in anticipation until the very end. Unfortunately for Gordon and his teammates, it was the Warriors who came out on top, with a 137-131 score line at the end. So it kind of makes sense that the player would not want to take home a reminder of his loss, even if he had an amazing performance on court personally.Aaron Gordon might have been the highest scoring player of the night, but his opponents showed up with full aggression, especially Stephen Curry. Curry scored 42 points and 7 assists as well as made 3 steals and 6 rebounds during the game, and was a complete powerhouse, especially during the second half of the game.Even Gordon had to admit, it's tough handling someone like Curry. His ""Steph being Steph,"" was enough for fans to understand what he meant. Even at 37 years of age, and on his 17th season in the NBA - Curry is one of the best players in the league. And whether you are a fan, or a rival, it's difficult to disregard his talent inside the court.Also Read: NBA gambling scandal: Stephen Curry calmly weighs in as the league faces its biggest storm yet","Denver Nuggets' Aaron Gordon scored a career-high 50 points against the Golden State Warriors.

Who is Scott Foster? Veteran referee's name pops up as NBA Betting Scandal gains more heat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/who-is-scott-foster-veteran-referees-name-pops-up-as-nba-betting-scandal-gains-more-heat/articleshow/124783526.cms,"Scott Foster (Image via X)

Scott Foster - Why do NBA fans call him the 'Extender'?

Scott Foster has a history with controversies

Scott Foster - once named the NBA ’s ‘only active celebrity referee’ is back in the headlines, and again, not for good reasons. NBA officials are of course an integral part of the game, but very few have made their mark as much as Foster. From his controversial refereeing techniques to some even more controversial scandals that his name has been linked to, he has had his fair share of drama in his career. And now, his name is popping up once again while the NBA's name gets dragged into a betting scandal the sports industry hasn't seen in a while. So, let's learn a little more about this referee that has everyone in a twist.Scott Foster is one of the oldest active referees in the NBA - currently in his 30th year on the job. While his long tenure has given him vast experience, it has also made him one of the most hated referees in the game. In fact, according to a 2023 poll taken by NBA players, over 25% of them named Foster as the worst referee in the league. Not an easy feat to achieve, but he did it!In recent times, the FBI has begun a large-scale investigation on matters related to fraud and cheating taking place in the NBA, even among high level officials. Multiple arrests have already been made, and fans of the game cannot help but drag Foster's name into the matter as well, especially given this will not be the first time his name gets involved in something similar.Scott Foster has a history with controversy in his 30-year-long career as a referee in the NBA. While he has never been charged on any criminal matters, Foster was linked to the 2007 trial of former NBA referee, Tim Donaghy - who pleaded guilty on counts of match fixing as well as fraud.Last year, in March of 2024, Foster was also accused by all-star center Rudy Gobert of sports gambling and match fixing during a Minnesota Timberwolves vs. Cleveland Cavaliers game. Gobert was later fined $100,000 for making a money gesture at the official, and Foster of course walked free. Now his name has been dragged into yet another scandal, and fans are eager to learn more about how this matter proceeds.Also Read: When money meets the game: Top sports gambling scandals from NBA to NFL that shook the sports world","Scott Foster is one of the oldest active referees in the NBA - currently in his 30th year on the job.

Similarly, the Washington Wizards, who have been on the road for their first two matches this campaign, would also like to take the win.After their loss to the San Antonio Spurs for the Mavs and the Milwaukee Bucks for the Wizards, this match will be important for both teams.The Mavs had a 39-43 run last season, and were ousted by the Memphis Grizzlies for the last Playoffs spot. The Wizards on the other hand had one of their worst seasons in the league, with a 18-64 run. This season they have had a couple of signings, but the Mavs have a better squad than their opponents on paper, making them the favorites to win the match. And Mavs fans would surely hope to see Cooper Flagg, who they have a lot of hope on, have a better time on court than he did on his first outing.Also Read: Is WNBA rookie Sonia Citron dating Dallas Cowboys star Marist Liufau?

Taking risks equals having fun, expressing yourself, being bold, and fearless

Ciara’s son Future did not want to learn dance steps for a TikTok video from her

NFL WAG does not want to get left behind

Ciara, the wife of Russell Wilson , is known for sporting bold fashion—from daring silhouettes like see-through gowns and body-hugging couture with thigh-high slits to biker jackets and faux-fur headpieces. She’s also known for being not a “regular mom” but a “cool mom” to her four children. In a recent interview with PEOPLE at True Religion’s Holiday Party, Ciara talked about taking risks with her fashion choices and whether she considers herself a cool mom to her four children.A PEOPLE interviewer asked the American singer: “Do you consider yourself a risk taker when it comes to fashion?”The 39-year-old mom-of-four said that fashion wouldn’t be fashion if there were no risks involved—“I think so, I think CiCi would like to take a little risk sometimes when it comes to fashion. I think fashion wouldn’t be fashion if you didn’t take risks. Sometimes, you may not get it right, but I think the risk is always worth it when it comes to fashion because it’s about having fun, it’s about expressing yourself, and it’s about being bold and fearless, so I, one hundred percent, yes, I’m a risk taker. ”A PEOPLE interviewer questioned the NFL WAG, “Do you identify as a cool mom? You’re a cool mom.”Ciara is known for wearing many hats at once—actress, dancer, record producer, singer, songwriter, fashion model, composer, and music video director.But when it comes to teaching her own kids, she learned a hard lesson. Her eldest son, Future, was recording a TikTok video with her, but when she tried to show him a few steps, he stopped her. “Mom, you don’t know what you’re talking about,” he told her.Ciara shared the humorous exchange: “You know, it's funny because my kids, you know especially my eldest, he’s reaching that stage where it’s like—we were doing a TikTok and I’m telling Future, do the dance like this, trust me, do your legs like this…and he’s like, ‘Mom, you don’t know what you’re talking about,’ I’m like, ‘Do you know who your Mama is, boy? Do you know your Mama will teach you all the dance moves that you need to know?’”The multifaceted mother further shared that her kids are reaching an age where they want to hold her hand as much anymore. But despite that, she feels she’s ‘tapped in’ with her kids, alright.“You get to that phase, and my friends told me about it,” Ciara explained. “When your kids start reaching a certain age, they don’t wanna hold your hand so much anymore. They’re like, ‘Mom, okay, give me 50 feet.’ So I think it (being a cool mom) depends on the child you have, but I do —I think I do alright. I think Mama’s tapped in, I think I’m tapped in with my kid community right now. I wanna make sure I’m on top of my stuff because I don’t want to get left behind. ”","Ciara, the wife of Russell Wilson, is known for sporting bold fashion.

Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier is in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons. The veteran was arrested this week in a major gambling probe that reportedly involves several current and former NBA players. Investigators claim Rozier may have shared inside information and been connected to bets placed on his own games, putting both his career and the league’s integrity under scrutiny. The arrest shocked fans and teammates who know Rozier as a tough, hard-working player who built his NBA career from grit and determination. But long before this controversy, Rozier’s story was already one of struggle and perseverance — shaped by a childhood without his father and the strength of the family who raised him.Terry Rozier Sr. has had a tough life. Growing up in Ohio, he spent many of his adult years in prison. Just weeks after his son was born in 1994, the then 18-year-old was arrested for aggravated robbery and spent the next eight years behind bars. During that time, Rozier’s mom, Gina Tucker, stepped up and raised him on her own. After Rozier Sr. was released in 2003, he and Terry shared a summer together. But that reunion was short-lived.In July of that same year, Rozier Sr. was arrested again, later pleading guilty to kidnapping, robbery, and manslaughter charges. Beginning in 2005, Rozier Sr. served a 13-year prison sentence, finally regaining his freedom in 2018. Since then, he’s worked at an industrial cleaning service near Youngstown, trying to rebuild his life.Terry Rozier's mother, Gina Tucker, carried the weight of raising her son and daughter, Tre’Dasia, alone in Youngstown. To give them a safer environment, she sent both children to live with their grandmother, Amanda, in Shaker Heights. Amanda later remembered how difficult those early years were, “Terry resented me so much. He told me, ‘I don’t like you, I don’t want to be here.’ He wanted to be with his mother back in Youngstown. ”Despite the rough start, Rozier eventually grew close to his grandmother. Looking back, he said, “I’m fine being raised by women. They did a good job, and let me tell you, it wasn’t easy. They are tough women… When I was young, I did crazy things. I talked back a lot. I cussed.” Rozier also has a brother, BJ Carter, and his half-sister, Tre’Dasia Tucker, both of whom remain close to him.No matter what happens with the gambling investigation, Rozier’s story is a reminder of where he came from — and the people who helped him get this far.","Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier was arrested this week in a major gambling probe.

Milwaukee Bucks’ Updated Injury Outlook

Context Behind Giannis Antetokounmpo’s Injury

What to Expect Tonight in Bucks vs Raptors Regular Season Game

to play tonight against the Toronto Raptors despite managing a left great toe sprain, according to the Milwaukee Bucks’ latest injury update from October 24, 2025. The Bucks superstar has been a dominant force early in the 2025-26 NBA season, opening with an impressive 37-point, 14-rebound performance. While the toe injury is a fresh concern following earlier back soreness, the latest report no longer lists the previous issue - an encouraging sign for Milwaukee fans.The Milwaukee Bucks’ decision to list Giannis Antetokounmpo as “probable” rather than “questionable” suggests optimism about his availability. While he may not be operating at full strength, all signs point toward him taking the floor and leading the team in Toronto. The coaching staff will likely manage his minutes carefully, ensuring the injury doesn’t worsen as the Bucks look to sustain their strong start to the season.Milwaukee will be without guard Kevin Porter Jr., who remains sidelined due to a left ankle sprain. His absence leaves a noticeable gap in the backcourt, putting additional pressure on Giannis Antetokounmpo and other rotation players to carry the load offensively and defensively.Expect players like Myles Turner, AJ Green, and Gary Trent Jr. to step up in expanded roles as the Bucks seek balance in their lineup.For the Raptors, health concerns are minimal heading into the matchup. Despite a few minor ailments across the roster, Toronto is expected to field a competitive team led by Scottie Barnes, RJ Barrett, and Brandon Ingram - each capable of creating problems for Milwaukee’s defense.Giannis Antetokounmpo’s strong start to the season is even more impressive considering his uneven preseason, where lower back soreness and illness briefly interrupted his rhythm. The current left great toe sprain emerged shortly before the matchup with Toronto, but the Milwaukee Bucks medical team has determined that it can be managed without forcing him to sit out.This cautious approach reflects Milwaukee’s long-term strategy to protect its franchise cornerstone early in the year. While Giannis is expected to play through the discomfort, his movement and intensity will be closely monitored, and adjustments could be made depending on how the injury responds during gameplay.The Milwaukee Bucks enter tonight’s matchup looking to maintain momentum in the Eastern Conference, with Giannis Antetokounmpo’s probable status serving as a major confidence boost. His ability to dominate on both ends of the court often dictates Milwaukee’s performance, and even a slightly limited version of the Greek Freak can be a game-changer.Toronto, meanwhile, will look to capitalize on its home-court advantage at Scotiabank Arena. With a balanced mix of young stars and experienced scorers, the Raptors are eager to test themselves against one of the league’s elite teams.Match Details and Broadcast InfoThe game tips off at 6:30 p.m. ET from Scotiabank Arena in Toronto.

Four NBA clubs have recently handed in hot water as a result of the FBI's thorough investigation into illegal sports gambling. Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups, Miami Heat forward Terry Rozier, and numerous others were charged with federal offences on Thursday as part of the large-scale investigation. Amidst all this, the Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry recently weighed in on it. He said that he ""wouldn't worry"" about the NBA's integrity. Stephen Curry is redefining leadership at a pivotal moment, not just by winning championships or games but by the manner in which he carried himself off the court. The Golden State Warriors guard recently opened up on the massive illegal gambling controversy that shook NBA to the core.After a well-deserved win, during a press conference, he emphasized that ""we are all very responsible"" and that the blame doesn't simply rest with a select few. Acknowledging how the situation has severely questioned the league's ethics, he further said that:""It's not just an NBA thing.”Discussing the controversy , he indicated that teammates are aware of what is happening with sports these days and what to do and not to do. He further said:""I think on the whole, everybody's very mindful of what to do, what not to do, and understanding the landscape of sports right now in general.”He continued:""And that's not just a NBA thing, this is new territory for everybody. So I think, on the whole, we all are very responsible. ""The integrity of the game is fine, and then obviously we let the situation play out, whatever happens. But I wouldn't worry about that too much.""Even while the entire legal and disciplinary situation is still pending, the veteran's public position sets a precedent for the G.S Warriors and the league as a whole. This all happened after the FBI opened up an investigation that involved allegedly rigged, mafia-connected poker games. Due to the same, dozens of people have been arrested, including Chauncey Billups and Terry Rozier.On Thursday, federal prosecutors filed two separate indictments against Rozier and Billups. The accusations are denied by both men. Rozier is among six people arrested over alleged betting irregularities. Among these are allegations that NBA players have manipulated gambling markets by fabricating illness.Warriors team-mate Draymond Green also talked about it during the same press conference. He added:""I was shocked. It's a tough moment for the individuals involved, a tough moment for the league. But I'm not going to sit here and be like, 'man, you all partner with a gambling company, you open a can of worms'. That can of worms can be open with partnering with gambling companies or not. Partnering with a gambling company is not going to make gambling more accessible to us. The accessibility is what it is."" Green and Curry's remarks come at a time when the NBA is facing massive issues. His straightforward statement opens up about the indictments, corruption scandals, and concerns about legal exposure.Curry appeared to call for accountability while also subtly acknowledging the issue. For Warriors supporters, Curry's message gives his legacy a new meaning. He delivered conscience instead of PR lines throughout a scandal-plagued season. This is what resonated with the fans the most.Also read: NBA gambling scandal: ESPN removes betting logo during broadcast as secret high-stakes NBA games emerge","Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry recently opened up on the massive illegal gambling controversy that shook NBA to the core.

Milwaukee Bucks vs Toronto Raptors Match Details and Broadcast (October 24, 2025)

Theare set to clash in what promises to be a thrilling regular-season showdown on October 24, 2025. Both teams enter the matchup with injury situations that could play a major role in determining the flow and outcome of the game.The Toronto Raptors head into the contest in relatively good health, with only minor concerns on their roster. Rookie Ja’Kobe Walter will sit out due to illness, marking the team’s only confirmed absence. Forward Collin Murray-Boyles is listed as questionable as he deals with a right forearm muscle strain, and his availability will likely be determined closer to tip-off.Despite these minor setbacks, the Raptors’ core lineup remains intact. Jakob Poeltl, Jamal Shead, Gradey Dick, and Chucky Hepburn are all cleared to play, bolstering Toronto’s balance on both ends of the floor. The likely starting lineup will feature Poeltl at center, Immanuel Quickley running the point, and a strong forward rotation anchored by Scottie Barnes, RJ Barrett, and Brandon Ingram. This combination gives Toronto an ideal mix of size, defense, and offensive versatility as they prepare to host one of the East’s top teams.On the other side, the Milwaukee Bucks have one major name on their injury list - Giannis Antetokounmpo . The superstar forward is listed as probable with a left great toe sprain, though early indications suggest he’s likely to suit up. His availability is a huge boost for Milwaukee after his explosive performance on opening night, where he tallied 37 points, 14 rebounds, and 5 assists in just 27 minutes.However, the Bucks will be without Kevin Porter Jr., who remains sidelined with a left ankle sprain. He’s expected to miss not only this matchup but potentially a few more games as he recovers. The rest of Milwaukee’s rotation looks solid, with Myles Turner, AJ Green, and Gary Trent Jr. all active and ready to contribute. Their presence will be critical in supporting Giannis and maintaining the Bucks’ early momentum in the Eastern Conference standings.Toronto’s defense, led by the ever-versatile Scottie Barnes, is expected to challenge Milwaukee’s offense throughout the night. With RJ Barrett and Brandon Ingram providing scoring punch from the wings, the Raptors will look to push the pace and test the Bucks’ transition defense. The absence of Ja’Kobe Walter might slightly thin Toronto’s depth, but the team’s top-heavy talent remains a serious threat.For Milwaukee, the primary question revolves around Giannis’ health and minutes. If he plays close to his normal workload, the Bucks will have a clear edge in interior scoring and rebounding. However, the loss of Porter Jr. could strain their backcourt depth, putting more pressure on role players like Green and Trent Jr. to step up offensively.The Raptors host the Bucks at Scotiabank Arena in Toronto, with tip-off scheduled for 6:30 p.m. ET. Fans can catch the action live on FDSWI and TSN, while streaming options are available through Fubo and NBA League Pass.This matchup promises to deliver a fierce early-season contest between two teams looking to establish their dominance in the East. With both sides managing key injuries and testing their depth, the Bucks vs. Raptors game could turn into one of the closest and most competitive battles of the season’s opening stretch.","The Milwaukee Bucks host the Toronto Raptors on October 24, 2025.

Wide receiver injuries have made things tougher



49ers showing resilience despite missing stars

The San Francisco 49ers have started the 2025 NFL season 5-2, but injuries continue to test the team. Defensive stars Nick Bosa and Fred Warner are out for the year, and several key offensive players have missed games. Quarterback Brock Purdy has only two starts so far, and the wide receiver group has been especially hit hard. Brandon Aiyuk, the team’s top wideout, is still sidelined more than a year after tearing his ACL and MCL. His absence has left a big gap in the offense.Aiyuk had a breakout 2023 season, catching 75 passes for seven touchdowns and 1,342 yards, earning second-team All-Pro honors. But injuries and a contract holdout slowed him down in 2024. He tore his ACL and MCL in Week 7 last year and hasn’t played since. Right now, Aiyuk is on the physically unable to perform (PUP) list. There’s no official return date yet, but the 49ers are hopeful. ""There's more than hope, there's some evidence. .. he's making really good progress,"" GM John Lynch said in a weekly interview with KNBR. ""He’s been putting in time and it’s coming nearer as to when he’s gonna be out there on the field."" Once Aiyuk is ready, the team can move him off the PUP list, giving him 21 days to play.The 49ers have had to rely on other players to fill the void at wide receiver. Jauan Jennings, Ricky Pearsall, and Marquez Valdes-Scantling have all missed time. Valdes-Scantling was placed on injured reserve before Week 7. With so many receivers out, running back Christian McCaffrey has become the go-to target. He leads the team in catches (53), receiving yards (516), and is tied for most receiving touchdowns (three). Despite all the injuries, San Francisco still ranks first in the league in passing yards, showing just how adaptable their offense has been.Even with so many injuries, the 49ers have kept winning. Tight end George Kittle returned from a hamstring injury in Week 7, giving the offense a boost. On defense, depth players are stepping up in place of Bosa and Warner. The team’s ability to lead the league in passing yards and maintain a winning record shows how well they’ve adapted. Christian McCaffrey has also stepped into a bigger role as a reliable target, keeping drives alive and helping the team stay balanced. Aiyuk’s return would make them even stronger as they look toward the playoffs.","The San Francisco 49ers have started the 2025 NFL season 5-2.

Miami Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill is facing a tough decision after a serious knee injury ended his season in Week 4 against the New York Jets. Hill, 30, has had two huge seasons with Miami, including a league-leading 1,799 yards in 2023, but now he’s not sure if he’ll return to the field next year. Hill got hurt in the third quarter when his left knee twisted awkwardly as he was tackled near the Jets’ sideline after making a catch. The injury immediately ended his season, leaving both him and the Dolphins unsure about the future — even though his contract with Miami runs through next season.On teammate Terron Armstead’s podcast, Hill opened up about how he will decide whether to come back. “At the end of the day, I feel like that decision is based on how I feel and where my mindset is at the moment,” he said. “I'm happy with the career that I've had. I love playing football, but it takes a lot — mentally and physically.” He also shared how he reacted in the moment he got hurt. “When I got tackled, I tried to get up and saw my leg was crooked. I just started laughing because I’ve been able to play this game for 10 years — my entire life, really — and I’ve been blessed with great talents and support from my family,” Hill said. “I wasn’t even thinking about the injury, just about all the great moments I’ve had playing this game.”Hill won a Super Bowl with the Kansas City Chiefs in 2020 and has become one of the league’s most explosive receivers.Even as Miami has struggled this season, dropping to 1–6 after a loss to Cleveland, Hill remains confident in the team and supportive of quarterback Tua Tagovailoa. “Everybody’s apparently on the hot seat. It’s a tough situation, but I’ll support Tua no matter what because that’s my brother,” Hill said. “He wants to win — and that should show people his commitment.”With Hill out, the Dolphins will need to adjust their offense while he takes time to heal and think about his future. His decision will depend on both his physical recovery and how he feels mentally about continuing his career.","Miami Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill is facing a tough decision after a serious knee injury.

Pokémon VGC champion WolfeyGlick shares harassment and groping experiences at competitive tournaments

“once or twice”

Impact on personal life and future appearances





WolfeGlick, 2016 Pokémon VGC World Champion, has revealed troubling experiences of harassment at competitive Pokémon events. In a recent video, Glick detailed being groped during fan interactions and photo opportunities at most tournaments he attended last season. He also shared that online harassment, including unsolicited sexual comments, has added to his discomfort. These incidents have impacted both his professional and personal life, prompting him to reconsider attending live events.Glick explained that during fan meet-and-greets and photo sessions, he was gropedper event, though he emphasized that the number should have been zero. He clarified that the groping is distinct from other unwanted contact, like tapping or grabbing for attention, which he also finds unacceptable. Sudden, uninvited physical contact can cause him physical pain due to stiff muscles, making even brief interactions uncomfortable.In addition to in-person harassment, Glick has experienced online sexual harassment, receiving unsolicited sexual comments on social media platforms. While the competitive Pokémon community generally treats him respectfully, he stressed that certain fans engage in parasocial behavior that crosses boundaries.The repercussions of these incidents extend beyond tournaments. Glick noted that after events, he sometimes feels uneasy leaving his home for about a week. As a prominent VGC content creator with large YouTube and Twitch audiences, his presence significantly boosts visibility for the competitive scene, which makes his safety and comfort a matter of wider concern.Glick is currently re-evaluating his attendance at live events, including major tournaments, to prioritize his well-being. The Pokémon Company International, which organizes Regional, International, and World Championships, has not publicly responded to Glick’s statements. These tournaments typically do not provide dedicated personal security for individual competitors unless specifically arranged, highlighting a gap in safety measures for high-profile players.While Glick continues to engage with the community online, his disclosure underscores the importance of addressing harassment at fan events and creating a safer environment for all participants. His story serves as a reminder that even celebrated players can face serious violations, and preventive measures should be considered at competitive events.Also Read: Resurfaced clip of Nina Lin sparks debate over sexual consent in streaming","WolfeyGlick, 2016 Pokémon VGC World Champion, has revealed troubling experiences of harassment at competitive Pokémon events.

Why Brian Daboll and Cam Skattebo are facing heavy fines for concussion protocol breach



“stuck his head in”

“I just stuck my head in to see how our quarterback was doing … In no way would I want a player to come back out there that wasn’t ready to play.”

NFL’s concussion policy under scrutiny after Brian Daboll and Cam Skattebo violation

“created the perception”

On October 24, 2025, the New York Giants were hit with heavy fines after head coach Brian Daboll and rookie running back Cam Skattebo violated the NFL concussion-protocol rules during their Week 6 game versus the Philadelphia Eagles. The incident occurred on October 9, 2025, at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, when rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart was escorted to the blue medical tent for a concussion check. While Dart was receiving care, Daboll and Skattebo entered the tent area, a zone reserved only for medical staff prompting the league and the players’ union to act.During the third quarter of the game, Jaxson Dart was sacked and held his head on the ground. He was taken to the sideline medical tent for a concussion evaluation. The NFL and NFLPA found that Brian Dabollthe tent and Cam Skattebo subsequently entered and spoke with Dart before his evaluation was complete, actions that constituted a perception of interference.Although the review stated neither Daboll nor Skattebo actually disrupted Dart’s exam or care, their presence violated the policy that “only medical personnel deemed essential to the care of the athlete” may be present during such evaluations.As a consequence, Daboll was fined $100,000, Skattebo $15,000, and the Giants organization faced a $200,000 fine. After the incident, Brian Daboll publicly apologised, explaining:Also Read: “Jaxson Dart Is A Better Player”: Brian Daboll Faces Ruthless Decision After Russell Wilson Pushes Back Against Quarterback Challenge This situation highlights the strictness of the NFL’s concussion-protocol rules, which are in place to protect players like Jaxson Dart and uphold independence in medical evaluations.The league’s joint statement from the NFL and NFLPA emphasised that while Dart’s care was properly managed, the actions of Brian Daboll and Cam Skatteboof interference and therefore violated the protocol.In response, the New York Giants have moved to implement additional staff training and tighter access controls to avoid similar mistakes.Meanwhile, the Giants’ upcoming rematch with the Eagles has extra attention now, not just for the game result, but with this off-field issue fresh in mind. The incident serves as a reminder that even well-intentioned actions can cross the line when player safety protocols are involved.","The New York Giants were hit with heavy fines after head coach Brian Daboll and rookie running back Cam Skattebo violated the NFL concussion-protocol rules.

Has Steph Curry suffered a major injury? Lakers player breaks silence

“I haven't appealed anything yet. The (Flagrant Foul 1) call, they made it, it is what it is.

Obviously, being on the other end you definitely disagree. ... It led to something else where they called a flagrant. But you move on. It is what it is.""

The NBA opening night saw the epic clash between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Golden State Warriors on Tuesday Night. The very first game of the season saw both sides getting physical against one another, with one particular instance making the headlines. It involved none other than the Warriors’ top star, Steph Curry, with major discussion regarding his injury status.Los Angeles Lakers player Marcus Smith has been accused of breaking Steph Curry during the spectacular showdown between the Lakers and Warriors this week. Both players were seen engaging in multiple altercations throughout the match; however, one instance caught fire and led to the veteran guard being slapped with the accusation of inflicting serious damage on the Warriors’ star.During the second quarter, Curry and Smart locked arms, and the excessive movement caused the four-time NBA champion to be pushed to the ground, with his arm seemingly twisted in an alarming manner. The entire scenario led to a Flagrant Foul 1 on Smart; however, he stood his ground and gave his take on the reactions he was getting, which were majorly negative.He said,Despite Curry reportedly suffering an injury, he and fellow Warriors teammate Jimmy Butler were the driving forces that led the Warriors to defeat the Lakers in the season opener. Curry assisted Butler with the offensive load and contributed 23 points, four assists, and three steals. At the same time, Butler was the star player of the night, adding 31 points, five rebounds, and four assists. Other standout performances were delivered by the Lakers star, Doncic, who scored 3 points, 12 rebounds, nine assists, two steals and one block.Another top performance was by AustinReeves, who had a triple-double performance with 43 points, 12 rebounds, nine assists, two steals, and one block.

Rita Moreno proudly supports Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl spotlight

A historic moment for Latino artists despite criticism



Hollywood legend Rita Moreno is standing up for Bad Bunny as backlash grows over his upcoming Super Bowl Halftime Show performance. The 93-year-old icon, known for her groundbreaking career and outspoken pride in her Puerto Rican heritage, has made it clear she fully supports the Latin superstar despite petitions calling for his replacement.Speaking to Us Weekly en Español at the 2025 Billboard Latin Music Awards, Rita Moreno didn’t hesitate when asked about the controversy surrounding Bad Bunny being selected as the Super Bowl LV performance headliner. “Bad Bunny at the Super Bowl? Ay, I’m delirious!” she exclaimed with joy.When told that critics claimed the reggaeton artist wasn’t “American” enough for the event, Moreno fired back with grace and humor: “So what? I’m Puerto Rican too. So what? What a nuisance!” Her comment instantly resonated with fans who saw her words as a proud defense of Latino representation on one of the world’s biggest stages.During the Miami-based Billboard Latin Music Awards, Moreno personally presented Bad Bunny, whose real name is Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, with the Billboard Latin Artist of the 21st Century Award. Her heartfelt introduction reflected the parallels between their careers: “When I was starting out, opportunities were few, and every small step forward was a victory.Today, I see an artist who brings that same strength, that same passion to the world — just like the one that helped me never give up. ”Meanwhile, controversy continues to swirl online. Over 82,000 people have signed a petition urging the NFL to replace Bad Bunny with country legend George Strait. However, Moreno’s words add a powerful counterpoint, celebrating progress and diversity in entertainment rather than limiting it.With Bad Bunny set to headline at Levi’s Stadium in California in February 2026, Moreno’s endorsement feels both symbolic and historic, a torch passed from one Puerto Rican trailblazer to another, bridging generations of cultural pride and resilience.Also Read: “Illegal immigrants”: MAGA outrage reaches boiling point after Roger Goodell defends Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl performance","Bad Bunny set to perform at the Super Bowl Halftime Show in February 2026.

Giants fined for violating NFL concussion protocol



League enforces accountability amid concussion concerns



The New York Giants have been slapped with hefty fines after breaching the NFL ’s concussion protocol during quarterback Jaxson Dart’s medical evaluation against the Philadelphia Eagles. The league and the NFL Players Association jointly announced the penalties on Friday, totaling $315,000 in fines. The Giants were fined $200,000, head coach Brian Daboll received a $100,000 penalty, and running back Cam Skattebo was fined $15,000 for conduct deemed detrimental to the league.The incident took place on October 9 at MetLife Stadium, midway through the third quarter when rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart was sacked and remained down on the field, holding his helmet. Following standard concussion procedures, Dart was escorted to the team’s blue medical tent for an evaluation by both the team’s medical staff and an independent neurotrauma consultant.However, the league’s review later revealed that Brian Daboll approached the tent and briefly stuck his head inside, while Cam Skattebo entered the tent before the evaluation concluded. Under the NFL’s concussion protocol, only essential medical personnel—such as the club physician, athletic trainer, and independent consultant—are allowed to be present during a player’s examination.A joint NFL–NFLPA statement said the coach and player’s actions “created the perception that they were interfering with Dart’s exam.” Although the investigation found no evidence that either man influenced the evaluation or Dart’s medical care, it concluded that “their conduct was inconsistent with and demonstrated a disregard for the concussion protocol’s requirements and therefore constituted a violation. ”Daboll was seen speaking animatedly with team doctor Scott Rodeo while waiting to learn if Dart would be cleared to return. After the game, Daboll said he only wanted to check on his quarterback’s condition and determine if a timeout was needed before a potential fourth-down play. Still, the league considered his action a breach of established medical boundaries.The NFL emphasized that the Giants’ medical staff properly followed all the necessary steps of the concussion protocol. The organization has since introduced remedial measures, including refresher training for players and staff, and new access rules to ensure only authorized individuals enter the medical tent during an evaluation.The league said these corrective actions were considered when determining the fines.The NFL’s concussion protocol remains a closely watched area of league policy, particularly following high-profile incidents like Tua Tagovailoa’s head injury in 2024. The joint NFL–NFLPA system conducts automatic reviews of all potential breaches to safeguard player health and ensure compliance.Dart later cleared all return-to-play procedures and finished the game, helping the Giants secure a 34–17 victory over Philadelphia.Despite the controversy, Daboll took full responsibility for his mistake, admitting he expected the fine but emphasizing his concern was purely for Dart’s well-being—a costly but crucial reminder of the boundaries set by the league’s player safety protocols.Also Read: “She treated us like gold"": What Travis Kelce’s coach experienced while meeting Taylor Swift shows why everyone loves her so much","New York Giants fined $315,000 for violating NFL concussion protocol.

In a recent SiriusXM TikTok Radio interview with Davis Burleson, the “Bittersweet” singer revealed that her original pair of Angel wings had to be completely redesigned just one day before she hit the runway.Beer explained that while her first set of wings was breathtaking, it was far too heavy to perform in. “I had other wings that were giant and [weighed] 25 lbs. We played with them in rehearsals, and I was like, ‘They’re literally gorgeous, but I can’t perform in them.
