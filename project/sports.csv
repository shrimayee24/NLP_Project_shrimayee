with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

It was a long flight. Around me, passengers slipped easily into slumber as the crew shut the windows, while I watched them with quiet envy. Sleep proves elusive but reading in the dim light of the cabin was too much of a strain. Resigned, I turned to the in-flight entertainment and chanced upon the movie ‘Battle of the Sexes’ on the extraordinary tennis player, Billie Jean King .Bobby Riggs, a former Wimbledon champion, was infamous for his unapologetic sexism. He believed women’s sports were inherently inferior to men’s, once declaring, “Women belong in the bedroom and the kitchen, in that order.” Determined to back up his claims, he challenged top seeded woman player Margaret Court to a match — and won. Elated by his triumph, Bobby continued to spew derogatory remarks about women’s capabilities in sports.That’s when Billie Jean King stepped forward, not just to shut down Bobby’s chauvinistic rhetoric but also to challenge the gross inequality in the American Tennis Federation. At the time, women were paid one-eighth of what male players earned. The justification? Women, they argued, lacked the emotional fortitude to endure pressure like men did.There are moments in life when reality outstrips fiction. For Billie, this was one such moment. The match, called the Battle of the Sexes, wasn’t just about tennis — it was a battle for respect. Billie agreed to play a best-of-five sets match, adhering to the men’s format.On Sept 20, 1973, the day of the match, Bobby made an ostentatious entrance, in a cart pulled by young women. The stage was set. Over 30,000 people crowded into Houston’s Astrodome, while an astounding 90 million watched on television, making it the most watched tennis match ever.Billie triumphed, winning in straight sets: 6-4, 6-3, 6-3.Few can truly grasp the pressure on Billie that day. The match wasn’t just against Bobby Riggs — it was against a mindset that had plagued women for centuries. Had she lost, women’s tennis, and perhaps women’s sports as a whole, could have been set back by decades.But Billie’s victory did more than just defeat Riggs. It sparked a revolution and a new era in women’s sports, fuelling the broader movement for gender equality and conversations on pay parity. Every woman who competes against men in any arena owes something to Billie.Life sometimes chooses certain individuals to bear the mantle of change who toil under immense pressure, not for personal glory but for future generations. Their struggles carve paths for others to follow, leaving deep imprints on the sands of time.As I watched the film and glimpses of the actual footage from that day, I felt Billie didn’t stand alone in the court.She was supported by the unspoken fury and indignation of countless women who had been oppressed for centuries. It was that hidden energy that empowered the sling stone of David when he faced Goliath, over and above her determination, relentless practice, and grit.I wonder who pulled the cart Billie arrived in. Perhaps the god of justice, the god of equality, the god who stands with the oppressed when they rise to fight.Thiruvalluvar affirms this timeless truth.When one resolves to raise their tribe,The gods, adorned in armour, lead the way.As the captain’s voice announced our descent, I turned off the movie. The screen went blank, but my heart was full — with admiration and gratitude for Billie Jean King, the pioneer, the fighter, and the voice of a movement.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’ Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114849660,imgsize-81446,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/114849660.jpg"

MUMBAI: As the 10 IPL franchises prepare to gather in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, for the mega auction on Nov 24 and 25, they now could bid on three Indian players with potential leadership qualities. Rishabh Pant and Shreyas Iyer joined KL Rahul in the auction pool when franchises announced their retentions on Diwali.Pant ended his nine-year association with the Delhi Capitals, while the Kolkata Knight Riders released their title-winning captain Iyer. With multiple teams like DC, Punjab Kings, RCB, and LSG eyeing Iyer, KKR were unable to convince Iyer to stay.The 2024 IPL champions retained veteran West Indian allrounders Andre Russell and Sunil Narine (Rs 12cr), along with Rinku Singh (Rs 13cr), Varun Chakravarthy (Rs 12cr), and the uncapped players Ramandeep Singh (Rs 4cr) and pacer Harshit Rana (Rs 4cr).Another big announcement from the retentions was the Mumbai Indians ' decision to retain Hardik Pandya as captain for IPL 2025, despite finishing at the bottom in 2024. MI retained their core Indian players: Jasprit Bumrah (Rs 18cr), Suryakumar Yadav (16.35cr), Hardik Pandya (16.35cr) and Rohit Sharma (16.30cr)DC retained Axar Patel (Rs 16.50cr), Kuldeep Yadav (13.25cr), South African batter Tristan Stubbs (Rs 10cr), and uncapped Abishek Porel (Rs 4cr). If they don't get Shreyas Iyer in the auction, Axar may lead them.In a subtle criticism of former captain KL Rahul, LSG owner Sanjiv Goenka, in a video on Star Sports, stated, “We aimed to retain players who put the team first over personal aspirations.” LSG retained Nicholas Pooran (Rs 21cr) as their top pick.CSK retained MS Dhoni (Rs 4cr), who confirmed he is enjoying cricket and wants to play another IPL season, captain Ruturaj Gaikwad (Rs 18cr), Ravindra Jadeja (Rs 18cr), Shivam Dube (Rs 12cr), and Sri Lanka's Matheesha Pathirana (Rs 13cr).IPL 2024 finalists SRH broke the bank to retain Heinrich Klaasen, offering Rs 23cr to hold onto the South African big hitter. They also retained captain Pat Cummins (Rs 18cr), Abhishek Sharma (Rs 14cr), Travis Head (Rs 14cr), and Nitish Reddy (Rs 6cr).Rajasthan Royals chose not to retain England's white-ball captain Jos Buttler. They opted to retain Sanju Samson (Rs 18cr), Yashasvi Jaiswal (Rs 18cr), Riyan Parag (Rs 14cr), Dhruv Jurel (Rs 14cr), Shimron Hetmyer (Rs 11cr), and Sandeep Sharma (Rs 4cr). Alongside Buttler, RR released Trent Boult, Yuzvendra Chahal, and Ravichandran Ashwin.At Gujarat Titans, Shubman Gill took a pay cut, accepting Rs 16.5cr, while Rashid Khan became their premium retention at Rs 18cr. RCB retained Kohli for Rs 21cr. As expected, Royal Challengers Bengaluru did not retain their captain of the past three seasons, Faf du Plessis and they also released India pacer Mohammed Siraj. They retained Virat Kohli for Rs 21cr.Punjab Kings will enter the auction with a substantial purse of Rs 110.5cr. Deciding that Arshdeep Singh was too costly to retain, they stuck to two uncapped players: Shashank Singh (5.5cr), who essayed heists last season and Prabhsimran Singh (Rs 4cr).","Rishabh Pant and Shreyas Iyer joined KL Rahul in the auction pool when franchises announced their retentions on Diwali.

The wait to know the names of players retained by their respective Indian Premier League (IPL) franchise ended on Thursday, which was the deadline (October 31) for the teams to make their decision. But while most of the big names will stay with their current team for IPL 2025, there were many notable absentees who will move to the auction pool.Here's a look at ten of those prominent players who now wait to know their fate:The star India wicketkeeper-batsman has not been retained by the Delhi Capitals, which will send him to the auction pool, ending his stint with the team since 2016. The 27-year-old Pant, who made a comeback to competitive cricket with IPL 2024 after a horrific car accident in December 2022, remains one of the most surprising and biggest names to not be retained.The Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) skipper has moved on from the franchise, ending his three-year association since LSG made its debut in 2022. According to a TOI source, LSG were ready to retain Rahul, but he decided to part ways because of ""personal and professional reasons"". Rahul led LSG to playoffs twice and will be among the hot buys at the IPL auction.The 34-year-old veteran Australia pacer broke all previous records at the last IPL auction last year to fetch a bid of Rs 24.75 crore from Kolkata Knight Riders. However, that wasn't reason enough for KKR to retain the left-arm fast bowler, who slowly came into his own after meagre returns initially in the last season, playing a role in the team's title triumph with his 17 wickets.The left-arm pacer is one of the most consistent performers in India's T20I team lately and showed that at the T20 World Cup, where he ended as the joint highest wicket-taker with 17 wickets. However, Punjab Kings decided to not retain Arshdeep, which sends him to the auction pool. He took 19 wickets in the last IPL season to finish joint fourth in the list.KKR's decision to let go of their captain also comes as a surprise, especially after Iyer led the team to clinching the trophy in IPL 2024, winning 9 of their 14 games in the league stage. Besides appreciably leading the team, Iyer also scored 351 runs. It's a setback of sorts for Iyer, as he was also left out of the list of BCCI's contracted players earlier this year.Mumbai Indians used all the allowed retention slots for capped players, which could be one of the reasons for the big-hitting wicketkeeper-batsman missing out. MI retained Jasprit Bumrah, Hardik Pandya, Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav and Tilak Varma. IPL retention rules allow a franchise to retain a maximum of five capped players.The England white-ball captain has delivered the big runs as an opener for Rajasthan Royals, including 359 runs in 11 matches in IPL 2024. However, it didn't convince Rajasthan Royals enough to retain the big-hitter, sending him to the mega auction.The Australian batting all-rounder failed to live up to his promise in the 2024 IPL season, spring just 52 runs in 9 innings, which left little chance for his retention by Royal Challengers Bengaluru.The Indian pacer was another high-profile omission from the Royal Challengers Bengaluru's list of retained players and will now wait to learn about his fate in the auction. He took 15 wickets in 14 matches in the 2024 IPL season.Australia's T20I captain, whose all-round skills are tailor-made for the T20 format, has not been retained by Delhi Capitals. He played just four matches in the 2024 season and was ruled out because of a hamstring injury. He scored 61 runs and took just one wicket before making an early exit from the tournament.","The wait to know the names of players retained by their respective Indian Premier League (IPL) franchise ended on Thursday.

Always under pressure to run through the opposition on home tracks, spinner marks welcome return to form with five-for

#INDvsNZ 3rd Test | India’s Madness After Jadeja Gives WTC Hope

MUMBAI: During the Bangladesh series , Ravindra Jadeja became only the third left-arm spinner to cross the 300-wicket mark in Tests. But over the last few matches, his performance didn't quite match his reputation. The wickets were drying up. The economy rate was above 3, sometimes above 3.50, than his career ER of 2.50. Before Friday's 5/65 on the first day of the Mumbai Test against New Zealand, Jadeja's last five-wicket haul was 13 innings ago, on his home turf in Rajkot against England at the start of the year.But towards the second innings of the second Test in Pune, things started to turn for the better. He looked a more confident bowler and had hit the lines and lengths which got him so many scalps. That confidence served him well on Friday as his spell helped India bowl out New Zealand for 235. It was his 14th career five-wicket haul, of which 12 have now come at home.The left-arm spinner, soon to turn 36, has set the bar so high along with partner-in-crime R Ashwin that even a minor dip in form raises eyebrows. The competition has piled up too. Axar Patel has shown that he is ready to take over the mantle, not to forget the plethora of left-arm spinners impressing in the Ranji Trophy , from Manav Suthar to Shams Mulani. For the time being at least, Jadeja may have heaved a sigh of relief. In the process, he has also put his hand up for a spot in the starting XI in the five-Test series against Australia later this month.So, what did Jadeja do differently to retain his mojo? ""As an individual, the performance wasn't that great in the first two matches. Didn't try to do anything different (here),"" Jadeja said after the day's play.""Sometimes it's all about luck as well. The Pune pitch didn't have that much bounce. Here I got good bounce and turn. The ball was skidding as well once it pitched. Sometimes it happens that on turning tracks you are beating batters regularly but don't get wickets. Sometimes the ball turns too much. What you need is a slight turn where it takes the edge of the bat,"" said Jadeja.Jadeja was bang on the money from his first ball and pooled in all his experience to slay the Black Caps' batters. While he got the wellset Will Young and Tom Blundell with balls that pitched on middle and leg and turned away — the former caught the latter bowled — he also got one to come in with the arm to castle a clueless Glenn Phillips.Things haven't gone well for him and Ashwin this season but seeing captain Rohit Sharma backing the duo does boost their confidence. ""Good that the captain is backing us. He knows what we have done for the team in the last 12 years, batting or bowling wise,"" said Jadeja, who added that the sweltering conditions meant it was difficult to grip the ball.Talking about India surrendering the good work done by the bowlers in the last 15 minutes, Jadeja felt the onus will be on the incoming batters to dig them out of trouble.""It happens. It's a team game. Can't blame an individual. Everyone commits some mistake at some moment. The onus is on the incoming batters to start well in the morning.""Jadeja also said he wanted to end his career undefeated at home, and was ""sad"" the run had been broken.",Ravindra Jadeja takes five-for on first day of Mumbai Test against New Zealand. Jadeja's last five-wicket haul was 13 innings ago in Rajkot against England. Spinner has put his hand up for a spot in the starting XI in the five-Test series against Australia.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114866802,imgsize-31680,width-400,resizemode-4/114866802.jpg"
East Bengal down Nejmeh to reach AFC Challenge League quarterfinals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/east-bengal-down-nejmeh-to-reach-afc-challenge-league-quarterfinals/articleshow/114857952.cms,"(Photo credit: East Bengal FC)

East Bengal FC — battered and bruised in the domestic league and with their backs to the wall — finally found their place in the sun in Asian football —on the bank of river Raidak in the capital of Bhutan.New coach Oscar Bruzon pulled a rabbit out of his hat as the red-and-gold brigade got the better of Lebanese side Nejmeh FC 3-2 to top Group A of the AFC Challenge League and sealed a place in the quarterfinals of Asia’s revamped third-tier club football.An own goal by Abdulai Musah in the 8th minute and another poacher’s strike from Dimitri Diamantakos in the 15th minute put Bruzon’s team in firm control of the proceedings. But Nejmeh — who came into the match with back-to-back wins and needed a draw to top the group — refused to be cowed down by the Kolkata team’s early onslaught and were soon back in the contest on the back of Collins Opare and Hussain Monzer in 19 and 43 minutes, respectively.As the Lebanese team grew into the contest with more purpose after the break and threatened to pinprick East Bengal’s talk of a resurgence, the combination of Madih Talal and Diamantakos delivered the coup de grace. Talal earned a penalty and Diamantakos sent the rival goalkeeper Ali Sabeh the wrong way from the spot in the 77th minute to help East Bengal cross the Nejmeh hurdle in style and book a place in the quarterfinals.Diamantakos proved why the team management sought his signature so desperately, finishing the Challenge League’s group stage with 4 goals, scoring in all three matches in Thimphu. Nine years after returning to Asian football, it was also quite a statement made by a red-and-golds brigade, who lost 8 matches in a row in domestic football and now finishing the group stage of an AFC competition with an unbeaten run, winning two of the 3 matches and scoring 9 goals.Yet, odds were heavily stacked against them when they reached Bhutan’s capital. Bruzon’s era began with back-to-back losses (0-2 vs Mohun Bagan SG and 1-2 vs Odisha FC) in the Indian Super League. But in less than a couple of weeks’ time, East Bengal looked a transformed side, still not at their best physically but playing with more purpose and potency.Yet, Nejmeh offered them the stiffest test. East Bengal — who came into Friday’s group-deciding game following a 2-2 draw with hosts Paro FC and a 4-0 demolition of Bangladesh champions Bashundhara Kings — never managed to defeat the Lebanese team, going down to them in their previous two meetings.But East Bengal set themselves perfectly on their road to self-discovery at the Changlimithang Stadium on Friday. Musah under the challenge of Diamantakos, sent his header into his own net following Talal’s corner and when East Bengal came calling again, Mahesh Naorem Singh sent his delivery perfectly across the face of goal for the Greek striker to tap home.It was a dream start for East Bengal but two defensive mistakes allowed Nejmeh to come back into the game in the first half itself and on both occasions, Hector Yuste was responsible. The Spanish defender, who started despite being a doubtful starter, seemed to have been bogged down by his muscle injury when he failed to chase Opare, allowing the latter to beat Prabhsukhan Gill.On the second occasion, he committed a foul near the D and Monzer curled his free-kick perfectly over the wall to let it settle into the top corner.Nejmeh began the second half with the same attacking tempo and Ali Alrida and Hussan Kourani missed a sitter with a gaping goal in front of them.Soon, it was Nandhakumar Sekar’s turn to let go of another opportunity at the other end, when he was set by Provat Lakra, the second-half replacement of Yuste.Nejmeh also upped their ante, Gill staying alert to deal with a few sorties, and urging his defence to stay alert and keep believing in themselves.Then came Tatal’s turn, drawing a foul from Alrida and Diamantakos stepped up to send home the penalty and take East Bengal into the knockout stage.","East Bengal FC beat Lebanese side Nejmeh FC 3-2 to top Group A of the AFC Challenge League.

When the 10 franchises sit for the IPL mega auction in Riyadh in the last week of Nov, the event will revolve around most teams looking for a new captain. Indian wicket-keepers will also be in demand. Rishabh Pant Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul are likely to dictate the course of the auction. Don’t be surprised to see Washington Sundar’s stocks rising.TOI takes a look at what each IPL team will be vying for in the auction...The biggest concern for the franchise is to find a definitive successor to MS Dhoni . Pant will obviously be the desired option but their remaining purse of Rs 55 cr could handicap them. Ishan Kishan could be an option if MI don’t use the right-to-match (RTM) card.With Pant leaving the franchise, DC will be looking for a captain who can match Pant’s brand value. The buzz is the franchise will go all out to bring back Shreyas Iyer, who had captained them to an IPL final in 2020.They have retained their captain Shubman Gill. They had worked with Wriddhiman Saha in the last three seasons. They may also eye Pant with a remaining purse Rs 69 cr.Having let go of their title-winning captain Iyer, they are also looking for a captain. KL Rahul and Jos Buttler could be their options with a purse of just Rs 51 cr left.They have Rs 69 cr left in the purse, with Nicholas Pooran getting Rs 21 cr as top retention. They are likely to go all out for Pant as captaincy and wicketkeeping option after releasing KL RahulThey spent heavily on retentions and have also announced Hardik Pandya as their captain. They are likely to use their sole RTM for Ishan Kishan.With Ricky Ponting taking charge as head coach, the franchise has let go of everyone except Shashank Singh and Prabhsimran Singh. With Rs 110 cr left in the purse, new head coach Ricky Ponting will be looking to build the entire squad around Pant. PBKS are likely to be the biggest competition for other franchises. They will look to use RTM for Arshdeep Singh.They have used up most of the purse to retain the core of the team. They will only look to buy support players for the likes of Sanju Samson, Riyan Parag, Yashashvi Jaiswal with a purse of Rs 41 cr left.With Rs 83 cr in the bank, they have the highest purse remaining after PBKS. Dinesh Karthik becoming the batting coach opens up a slot for a captain and Indian wicketkeeper. Indications are they may go for Pant, with Rahul as a backup option.Besides MI and RR, SRH is the only other team which looks sorted. They will also go for support players for Klassen, Cummins, Head, Abhishek Sharma and Nitish Reddy with Rs 45 cr left in the bank.","Rishabh Pant, Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul are likely to dictate the course of the auction.

KOLKATA: An amount of Rs 11 cr will sound princely for a 22-year old who spends perhaps as much time in the sick bay as on the field. However, the Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) owners never had a doubt that they wanted to hold on to their express bowler Mayank Yadav at any cost.""The way you look at it, when a player is playing a match, is he able to contribute to a win?"" LSG co-owner Shashwat Goenka asked TOI while explaining the rationale behind naming the pacer as one of their five retentions. ""I think Mayank fits that bill perfectly. He has played in four games last season and picked up seven wickets. That itself shows the potential of the individual.""Mayank in fact, has been with LSG since 2022. He did not get to play that season and had to sit out in 2023 with a torn hamstring. He made his debut in 2024 and instantly caught the attention with his pace, consistently going over the 150kph mark.With 3/27 (against PBKS) and 3/14 (against RCB), Mayank became the first player in IPL history to be named Player of the Match in his first two matches.""If you look at other players with similar background, when they first started off they were injury-prone as well and they had to work on their fitness, if I can put it that way,"" Goenka went on. ""So that wasn't the deciding factor, it was about when he plays, what is the contribution he makes to the game and to LSG. That was the guiding principle behind keeping him.""IPL has been tough on bowlers, going by last season's scores. Goenka, however, isn't worried that their young pacers might wilt under pressure. ""These guys really know how not to be tossed around,"" the owner said, giving examples of Mayank and Mohsin Khan 's performance in the death overs.",Mayank Yadav is one of five IPL players to be retained by Lucknow Super Giants. The 22-year-old bowler has been with the franchise since 2022. Mayank is the first player in IPL history to be named Player of the Match in two matches.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114867425,imgsize-31484,width-400,resizemode-4/114867425.jpg"

CHENNAI: It's a new start but Chennai Super Kings have decided to stick with their tried-and-tested formula of continuity as they retained Ruturaj Gaikwad , Ravindra Jadeja, Shivam Dube, Matheesha Pathirana and MS Dhoni (uncapped).Now, CSK are left with Rs 55 cr in the kitty and there are talks that they would like Rishabh Pant in their squad. But Punjab Kings along with Lucknow Super Giants and Royal Challengers Bengaluru will be involved in the biggest fight for the superstar keeper.It is unlikely that CSK will go upto Rs 25 cr because they have quite a few holes still to fill.While a top-order Indian batter and an experienced paceman are in CSK's wishlist, one player they will certainly try to bring back is R Ashwin . The 38-year-old was part of CSK until 2015 before he moved on. But the spinner told TOI a couple of months ago that he nurtures the dream of playing once again for his old franchise, which gave him his first break in 2008.Meanwhile, CSK's preferred Right To Match (RTM) choice will be New Zealander Devon Conway","CSK retain Ravindra Jadeja, Shivam Dube, Matheesha Pathirana and MS Dhoni.

India lose 3/6 in 8 balls in final 15 minutes to end Day 1 at 86/4 in reply to NZ’s 235

#INDvsNZ 3rd Test | India’s Madness After Jadeja Gives WTC Hope

MUMBAI: This was no brain fade. It was a brain explosion. In eight balls, Team India treated its fans to a horror show just a day after Halloween. With just around 10 minutes to go before stumps, Yashasvi Jaiswal , looking his free-flowing self while having scored 30 (52b, 4x4) in a 53-run second wicket partnership off 64 balls with Shubman Gill (31 batting, 38b, 2x4, 1x6), chose to reverse sweep an Ajaz Patel ball that had pitched on the leg stump. The ball crashed into his leg and middle stump. 78 for one in 17. 2 overs suddenly became 78 for two.If that wasn’t silly enough, India, instead of sending one of their three allrounders, asked tailender Mohammed Siraj to do the job of a nightwatchman. He was out LBW for a golden duck to Patel, giving the Kiwi left-arm spinner the chance to bag a hattrick. Then, Siraj burnt a review too, despite being plumb in front. 78 for three in 17.3.The worst was to come. Even as Virat Kohli staved off the hat-trick, he played his part in India’s final implosion in that little period under lights, which marred India’s Day One outing against New Zealand in the third and final Test at the Wankhede completely. Driving a ball to mid-on, Kohli (4) took off for a non-existent single as Matt Henry fired a direct throw to the stumps. 84 for four in 18.3 overs.This is the second time in two innings that Kohli has been involved in a needless runout. In India’s second dig in Pune, his eagerness for a quick single at backward point had led to Rishabh Pant being out for a duck. His keenness to get off the strike on Friday indicated that Kohli is not just short of runs, but short of self-confidence too.Within a space of six runs and seven balls, India, suffering their latest collapse, lost three wickets. Their dressing room looked stunned with head coach Gautam Gambhir looking on in disbelief.Before this phase of thoughtless cricket, skipper Rohit Sharma (18; 18b, 3x4), playing a Test at the Wankhede after 11 years, served up yet another evidence of why he could be well past his best, getting squared up while trying to halfpull a Henry delivery, only to be pouched by his counterpart Tom Latham at second slip.In five innings in this series, all the 37-year-old has put together is 80 runs, with just one half-century. Even here, he was lucky to survive after being dropped on 15 at long leg by William O’Rourke off Henry.In Nov 2013, Rohit had announced his arrival on the Test stage with a sizzling century at this venue in Sachin Tendulkar’s farewell Test. Could this outing be the last innings, at least at the Wankhede, if not at home, for him and a few other stalwarts of India’s golden generation?The collapse from 78-1 to 86-4 completely undid the fine work of their spinners Ravindra Jadeja (5/65) and Washington Sundar (4/81 in 18.4 overs). Both thrived on a pitch which provided generous turn and bounce on Day One after seamer Akash Deep had trapped opener Devon Conway LBW as the Kiwis folded for 235.If the visitors got 15-20 runs above par on this pitch, where playing spin isn’t easy, they must be grateful for the excellent half-centuries by Daryl Mitchell (82; 129b, 3x4, 3x6) and Will Young (71; 138b, 4x4, 2x6). While Mitchell must be complimented for the way he kept at it despite constantly battling cramps because of the oppressive heat and humidity of Mumbai, Young deserves praise for the way he has filled the big shoes of Kiwi batting great Kane Williamson at the pivotal No. 3 spot. Both used their feet and swept well to neutralise the spinners.Brushing off unusual poor form at home, Jadeja took his 14th five-wicket haul, while the impressive Sundar, carrying on from his magical 14-wicket haul in the last Test in Pune, again overshadowed his senior off-spinning colleague R Ashwin.Just one wicket would’ve put Ashwin past Indian leg-spin great Anil Kumble’s record haul of 38 wickets at the Wankhede, but the 38-year-old finished wicketless, a pale shadow of his former self.","India lose 3/6 in 8 balls in final 15 minutes to end Day 1 at 86/4 in reply to NZ’s 235.

MUMBAI: Whenever New Zealand have pinned India down in this series, they have made sure to capitalize on the advantage. After India collapsed from 78/1 to 86/4, the stunned faces in the Indian dressing room, and in the stands, summed up the day.Daryl Mitchell, who top scored for the Black Caps with a fine 82, felt the team's collective effort and ability to hang on when the chips were down — read when Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill were piling on the runs — ensured that they ended the day with their noses ahead.""That's the nature of Test cricket . There's always ebbs and flows throughout the day and we were lucky today to build some pressure. There was a nice partnership going between Shubman and Jaiswal. But as it happens in Tests, you get one, you try and get two and you keep trying to put the pressure on the opposition. Hopefully, we can take a few more in the morning but we also know that they've got a number of world-class players,"" Mitchell said.He went on to laud the effort put in by each player even during the fag end of the day, whether it was Rachin Ravindra running around to save runs or Matt Henry 's effort that caught Virat Kohli short of his crease. ""Our motto is to just keep giving to the team. The way Rachin and some of the other guys chased the ball right to the boundary, that's the stuff that we pride ourselves on. It means everyone's engaged. It's nice that it paid off tonight.""We put a total on the board (and) hopefully now we can take a few more wickets. The game is evenly poised right at the moment,"" Mitchell said, adding that the conditions did not surprise the Kiwis. ""It's the nature of the red soil. It's going to have bounce and a little bit of turn. We knew what to expect,"" he said.","Daryl Mitchell top scored for the Black Caps with a fine 82.

NEW DELHI: Despite India's consecutive Test losses against New Zealand, visiting captain Tom Latham maintains that the Indian squad remains formidable without any significant weaknesses.New Zealand achieved a remarkable milestone by securing their first Test series victory in India, winning the opening match in Bengaluru by eight wickets and following it up with a decisive 113-run victory in Pune.While India faces comprehensive challenges across all departments in the current series, the New Zealand team, which has performed flawlessly throughout their tour, offered encouraging remarks about their opponents.""India are a quality side, things obviously haven't gone the way they wanted over the last couple of weeks but it doesn't make them a bad team overnight,"" Latham told reporters before New Zealand's training session at the Wankhede Stadium .""They've got superstars from (Nos) 1 to 15 in their squad and we expect them to be in their best tomorrow and again a new challenge for both teams, a new surface.""""I'm sure a surface that they know well and a ground that they know well, so I certainly don't think they have any chinks - they're a quality team and it's going to be another great battle,"" Latham added.With New Zealand leading 2-0, a clean sweep over India is possible, though Latham remained reserved about that prospect.""We've obviously done a lot of good stuff over the last couple of weeks but for us, every Test match you go (in with) the focus of trying to win key moments and not necessarily focusing on the result...""Obviously that's the byproduct of putting things together back-to-back, good sessions back-to-back so yeah, a different pitch, different conditions, it's obviously a lot hotter out there than what we've faced in the last couple of weeks,"" he said.Latham, who assumed New Zealand’s captaincy before this tour, expressed satisfaction with his team’s two wins, which have bolstered the inaugural World Test Champions’ hopes of reaching another final.Prior to this tour, New Zealand’s chances of a second WTC final appearance were slim, but they now need to secure victories in all four remaining Tests to stay in the race. Besides the upcoming third Test against India, New Zealand will face England in a three-Test home series.But once again, Latham opted to downplay the significance of their achievement and said, ""The beauty of this team is we're a reasonably levelled team in terms of I guess when results don't go so well but also when you know results do go well.""We try to keep things as level as we can and there's no bigger carrot in terms of what's coming up, if you know, if we are successful throughout this game.""We always focus on the process around what that looks like from the start of the game and adapt throughout the game in terms of the game situation and what will be needed,"" he said.Latham stated that New Zealand's focus remains on the task ahead, rather than celebrating being the first Kiwi team in nearly 70 years to defeat India on their home soil.""The guys celebrated what was you know a fantastic last week and came here yesterday. We're a bit shocked by the heat, it was pretty hot out there, but yeah, again, another challenge and you know we'll certainly be looking forward to what's presented to us this week,"" he said.When asked whether overseas Test and series victories should hold more weight in the WTC points system, Latham expressed his contentment with the current setup.""I haven't necessarily thought about that as such. The introduction of the World Test Championship over the last five (to) six years has been fantastic and the context that it has put on Test cricket , rather than bilateral series, has been fantastic,"" he said.""We've probably seen a few more results in terms of games that have been played certainly over the last period of time, so the context that's now given Test cricket is awesome.""Being in the position with the first one (winning team) and being successful gives you a taste of what that success feels like and once you do it, you want to do it again,"" he added.",New Zealand captain Tom Latham says India's recent results don't make them a bad team.

It starts to come together today, with the retention list. It’s well documented as to what I’ve done with Punjab (Kings).

NEW DELHI: New Zealand 's Daryl Mitchell expressed that the game remained balanced, even though India's batting collapse had shifted momentum towards Kiwis on day one of the third and final Test in Mumbai.After winning the toss, New Zealand managed to score 235, with Mitchell contributing a significant 82 runs. India's bowling performance effectively restricted the visitors, but their batting response proved problematic.At stumps, India found themselves in a difficult situation at 86 for four, still needing 149 runs to match New Zealand's first innings total.""We put a total on the board (and) hopefully now we can take a few more wickets. We'll see what happens tomorrow (day two). The game is evenly poised right at the moment,"" said Mitchell after the end of day's play.Indian spinners Ravindra Jadeja (5/65) and Washington Sundar (4/81) dominated the first day, claiming nine wickets between them as the pitch offered significant assistance to spin.Mitchell noted that the conditions came as no surprise to the visiting team.""It's the nature of red soil here in this part of the world. It's going to have a bit of bounce and a little bit of turn. We knew what we were expecting when we showed up this morning,"" he said.Mitchell expressed pride in New Zealand's performance as the team inched closer to a historic 3-0 series win over India, aiming to become the first visiting side to achieve this feat.""It was pretty warm out there. The humidity was pretty sticky and there wasn't a lot of breeze. Us Kiwis, coming from down in the middle of winter back home, it's always a good challenge,"" he said.""We're just a bunch of Kiwis taking on the world, having fun and trying to win games for our country.

NEW DELHI: Former Indian captain Anil Kumble didn’t hold back while commenting on Virat Kohli 's run-out on Day 1 of the third Test against New Zealand , describing the dismissal as 'suicidal'.India, who ended the day at 86/4 in reply to NZ's 235, will begin Day 2 with Shubman Gill (31*) and Rishabh Pant (1*) at the crease as the hosts work to close the 149-run deficit.On Team India's sudden collapse late in the day, Kumble said it's more than a concern at the moment.""You can't have this repeatedly happening in every game, so it's more than a concern at the moment. You had an opportunity to get inside with just one wicket down of Rohit Sharma . And then yes, Jaiswal gets out and the night watchman comes in and gets out first ball, then this (Kohli run-out),"" said Kumble, while talking on Jio Cinema, after the end of day's play.Kumble pointed out that Kohli’s aggressive instincts may have led to a risky single that ultimately cost India a crucial wicket. He emphasized that such moments can disrupt the team’s momentum, especially when an experienced batter like Kohli is dismissed unnecessarily.""Nobody expected the run-out. This was certainly not something that you expect of Virat Kohli getting run out in the last over or last few minutes of a day's play. And it was something that he just hit the shot and then went straight for a run, which is suicidal,"" the former cricketer added.In 2024, Virat Kohli has accumulated 249 runs across six Tests and ten innings so far, with just one fifty and a highest score of 70.However, in the ongoing ICC World Test Championship 2023-25, Kohli's performance has been more consistent.

NEW DELHI: As India suffered yet another collapse -- losing three wickets in 8 balls -- this time, during the closing stages of play on the opening day of the third Test, all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja admitted that things happened all of a sudden and the team did not have time to react.The hosts were cruising at 78 for one in reply to New Zealand's 235 all out but a shock batting display saw them losing three batters in final two overs and end the day at a precarious 86 for four.The four dismissals of Rohit Sharma (18), Yashasvi Jaiswal (30), Mohammed Siraj (0) and Virat Kohli (4) have now left the team in a difficult spot but Jadeja said that the team is not yet out of the match.Jadeja also said that it is unfair to blame specific individuals for the brief period of poor performance.""It all unfolded in a mere 10 minutes, (we) did not get any time to react. But it happens, it is a team game, any individual cannot be blamed specifically… small mistakes keep happening,"" Jadeja told the media after end of play.""But the next batters will have to forge partnerships and try and get past (the score of) 230 (235), only then the second innings will come into play. It will be good if the batters who are lined up to play next make their contributions.""""We still have a chance. It is not the case that we are out of the match. Hopefully, we would bat well tomorrow and given that there is something happening on the wicket, if we also bowl well, then it will be good,"" he added.With India facing yet another collapse, Jadeja disputed the idea that the repetitive failure of specialist batters has put a lot of pressure on the lower order.""Pressure is always there. It is not that when the top-order does not perform, the pressure is always there on the lower order. When the top-order does perform, even then there is pressure on the lower-order as to why they are not doing it?"" he replied.Jaiswal was bowled while attempting a reverse slog sweep off Ajaz Patel. The left-arm spinner then trapped nightwatchman Mohammed Siraj leg-before with the very next delivery.At No 5, Kohli attempted a risky single only to be run out, causing India to suffer another poor session and lose their advantage to New Zealand.Jadeja acknowledged that India's poor performances in the first innings across the three Tests against New Zealand have been crucial to their struggles.""Sometimes, when you are down 0-2, it takes time for you to do anything, or even to bounce back. We have not done enough in the first innings from the first Test and have been behind in the game,"" he said.""Even in Pune, we did not bat well and repeated the same mistakes and have been lagging behind.""Jadeja admitted that he never imagined losing a Test series at home while he was playing, emphasizing the high expectations set by the Indian team.""Firstly, I had this fear… personally I had thought that I won't lose a series in India as long as I am playing. But that too has happened,"" he said.""We won 18 series (at home), I thought as long as I am playing Test cricket in India we won't lose a series but that has happened, so I am not surprised with anything (that is happening).""He continued, ""We have set the expectations really high.

Soon after hitting it, Kohli took off but Matt Henry was quick to react and threw the ball down at the stumps after swiftly collecting it.Seeing the incoming throw, Kohli put in a big dive but as Henry had hit the bull's eye, the star India batter was found at least a couple of yards short.Before the fall of Kohli in the final over, the penultimate over of the day saw India losing Yashasvi Jaiswal and nightwatchman Mohammed Siraj falling of successive balls against Ajaz Patel.While Jaiswal (30) was knocked over around his legs, Siraj was trapped plumb in front of the stumps for a golden duck.Earlier, Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar shared 9 wickets between them as the hosts bundled out the Kiwis for 235.Daryl Mitchell (82) was the top scorer for the BlackCaps.New Zealand already have an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match Test series.",Virat Kohli run-out with India 86 for four on opening day of third and final Test against New Zealand.

'One of the best'

Alexander Zverev beat fierce rival Stefanos Tsitsipas in the quarter-finals of the Paris Masters on Friday, while Holger Rune edged Alex de Minaur to keep alive his hopes of reaching the ATP Tour Finals .Zverev's 7-5, 6-4 win over Tsitsipas kept him in the running to claim his first title in Paris after losing to Daniil Medvedev in the 2020 championship match.World number three Zverev -- the highest-ranked player left in the draw -- will face 2022 champion Rune in Saturday's semi-final after the Dane overcame De Minaur 6-4, 4-6, 7-5.The 16th meeting between the 27-year-old German and 26-year-old Greek was evenly matched during a hard-fought first set.""At the beginning, he was outplaying me but then I found my rhythm from the baseline,"" said Zverev on court.""And when I had my chance I used it in the first set.""Indeed once Zverev broke late in the opener and early in the second, it became a comfortable ride to just his sixth win against his long-time Greek rival.The loss ends the chances of the world number 11 Tsitsipas of reaching the end-of-year ATP Finals -- having won the showpiece event in 2019.Tsitsipas and Zverev started cautiously with both offering up opportunities for early breaks in their first service games.But they soon found their range as the first set looked destined to require a tie-break to separate the pair on the quick surface at Paris' Bercy Arena.However, the first break points of the match eventually came with Tsitsipas serving at 5-5, the German claiming the second on a double fault.The Greek saved two set points and secured a break-back point of his own but Zverev dug in to hold.Tsitsipas' shoulders visibly sagged as he offered up break point after break point at 1-1 in the second set.When he dragged a shot long to end a game which had lasted over 15 minutes, his opponent had firmly taken the ascendancy.Zverev, who reached the French Open final in Paris this year, served out to win and move towards a second ATP 1000-level trophy of the season.Former world number four Rune, the 13th seed, needed just one break of serve as he took the opener against De Minaur.In the second set, the 25-year-old Australian started to open up on his groundstrokes, producing several stunning winners off both wings.Rune finally relented when serving at 4-5, offering up three set points to De Minaur who duly converted the second with aplomb.The Australian's first serve gradually deserted him in the decider and Rune capitalised by breaking in the fifth game, but De Minaur struck immediately back to level.A huge net cord that clipped the line on the right side of the court for Rune gave him a 15-0 lead and he took full advantage, breaking to lead 6-5 before consolidating to win the match.""Sascha (Zverev) and I had a great match in Paris, where he took it in five. I beat him one time, he took me last time,"" Rune said of facing Zverev who came out on top when the pair met in a five-set clash in the last 16 of the French Open this year.""He is one of the best players this year, so I will have to be very well prepared.""With the result, both Rune and De Minaur still have a chance of reaching the Tour Finals in Turin, which run November 10-17.Frenchman Ugo Humbert , who downed world number two Carlos Alcaraz in the last 16, delighted the vocal home crowd by beating unseeded Australian Jordan Thompson 6-2, 7-6 (7/4).The world number 18 will face Russian Karen Khachanov in the other semi-final as he attempts to reach a first Masters final of his career and emulate Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in becoming the first French winner in Paris since 2008.Khachanov, the 2018 Paris Masters champion, defeated last year's runner-up Grigor Dimitrov 6-2, 6-3, ending the 33-year-old Bulgarian's hopes of reaching Turin in the process.","Alexander Zverev beats Stefanos Tsitsipas 7-5, 6-4 in Paris Masters quarter- final.

You need to get to a situation for luck to play a role: Arjun Kadhe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/you-need-to-get-to-a-situation-for-luck-to-play-a-role-arjun-kadhe/articleshow/114661630.cms,"Arjun Kadhe

PUNE: It was his grandparents who sowed the seeds for Arjun Kadhe ’s career as a professional tennis player.More than two decades ago, when Arjun was taking baby steps in tennis, his paternal grandfather decided to sell their house and set aside the proceeds exclusively to help his grandson follow a dream.“I remember when I was eight years old … at that point we were not financially so super to think about tennis as a viable option for my career. But my granddad had a vision. He told me, ‘Okay, I will do anything. You just play tennis, you want to represent India, you want to play a Grand Slam ’. My parents were living on rent. It was unbelievable,” an emotional Kadhe, 30, said as he jogged his memory back.All the sacrifices, of his and of those around him, and the years of tireless pursuit of excellence bore fruit last week when Arjun claimed his first ATP Tour doubles title , in partnership with Rithvik Choudary at the Almaty Open in Kazakhstan last week.“The credit goes first to my parents, they've made huge sacrifices, then my coaches. Obviously, it's a team effort,” he said.""Obviously, Balu sir (coach M Balachandran) traveling with us, (former South African player) Raven (Klaasen) traveling with us, the Double Dream of India programme is helping us a lot.“And as you said, the journey is long, but it feels really, really good, because you get rewarded. In doubles you're playing 35 weeks alone on the road, and it can be really brutal sometimes.“So this win, we both want to take it in, get confidence, enjoy and go ahead again.”The Indian combination beat three teams ranked in the top-30 on the ATP Tour, including No. 13 pair Sadio Doumbia and Fabien Reboul of France in the second round.In a thriller of a final, Arjun and Rithvik saved five match points in the super tiebreak to beat Germany’s Jakob Schnaitter and Mark Wallner, ranked 26th, 3-6, 7-6 (3), 14-12. Remarkably, the Indians won only 68 points to their rivals’ 80 in the match.Arjun acknowledged that luck played its part in their win, but the team needed to work hard to get there in the first place.“I think luck played a big part. But at the same time, we were just talking, the coaches were telling us we lost two finals in the super tiebreak, where we were the better team, in the Challengers. As (personal coach) Hemant (Bendrey) sir was also saying, luck is there, but you have to get yourself into that situation for luck to play it out,” Arjun said.The Punekar, supported by Punit Balan group , rose to a career-high 77 in the individual doubles ranking after the win.“I'm really grateful that it has happened, but at the same time, I feel I was playing a good level,” he said.“It's about, you know, being there, giving yourself that chance, getting rejected, at some point it will come.“It's not in your hands when that click comes. For some people, it comes early. If they can sustain it, they move to the next level.“Some people get rejected, and get that breakthrough. It's about working hard and trying to improve, and take the next step. Everyone has their own journey, in my opinion.“I feel we deserve it, because I truly believe we have the level. Now it's about going the long way and trying to improve every day and not be satisfied with this one tournament.”Arjun had partnered Rithvik in the latter half of last season but parted ways at the start of 2024. Even before they combined, the Telangana lad had mentioned to Arjun of his desire to play with his previous partner Niki Poonacha whenever he decided to focus on doubles. So, the Maharashtra player was understandably cautious when Rithvik reached out to him in the middle of this season.“I feel like every challenge brings opportunity. At that point (when Rithvik chose to go back to Niki at the start of 2024), I was like, ‘oh my God. we are doing well, blah, blah, blah, what is happening?’ But then, if I look back now, I won (two Challenger) titles (with Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan and Anirudh Chandrasekar),” Arjun said.“So it was really good for me.”This time around, Arjun said, the two were in for the long haul. And long-term partnership is something he strongly believes in.“To develop a good team, you need time,” he said, “because if you keep switching partners, the first few weeks of understanding how we want to play, understanding how my partner wants us to play in the future, what is our best?“For all that to align it takes a little bit of time, and in doubles you have super tiebreak. Sometimes you are winning from (facing) match points, sometimes losing from match points.”The Almaty title had given a pleasant surprise for both Arjun and Rithvik in terms of ranking jump — the latter had broken into the top-100 for the first time in his career, reaching 85 in the ATP charts.That means they will now give it a shot to make the Australian Open cut before closing the season.“Now it's about planning it smartly, taking care of your body, because it's the end of the year, you don't want to overplay,” he said.“If we want to be top-50 in the world, we need to improve a lot. We won this tournament, but those teams are doing so many things better than us. So, it’s important also to play the big events, lose, and then realize this is where we are at.“So, we are not thinking too far ahead, just trying to think next week. How can we try and make Australia? If we don't make it, we still have to try and make French.“The plan will go forward from there.”","Arjun Kadhe claims his first ATP Tour doubles title with Rithvik Choudary at Almaty Open in Kazakhstan. The 30-year-old rose to a career-high 77 in the individual doubles ranking after the win. Arjun acknowledged that luck played its part in their win, but the team needed to work hard.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114661721,imgsize-157286,width-400,resizemode-4/114661721.jpg"
