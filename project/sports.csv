PATNA/KOLKATA: A 13-year-old teen who doesn't talk much but lets his bat do all the talking was snapped by Rajasthan Royals for Rs 1.10 crore after an intense bidding at the IPL auction, making him the youngest player to play the world's biggest cricket league.On Monday evening, at faraway Jeddah, the young Bihar prodigy's name, Vaibhav Suryavanshi , was engraved on the annals of Indian Premier League (IPL) when he became the youngest player ever at the age of 13 years and 243 days to land an IPL contract.Vaibhav entered the 2025 IPL mega auction at a base price of Rs 30 lakh as the youngest ever to be listed in the 16-year history of the league. The southpaw was finally bought by the Royals, who outbid intense fight from Delhi Capitals to get the talented teenager with a staggering price.""He is a kind of player who has come on earth to play cricket and go back. He settles for nothing else,"" said Bihar Ranji coach Pramod Kumar.Kumar, under whose watchful eyes Vaibhav is honing his cricketing skills, said the young southpaw is curious to learn various aspects of the game and has a sharp mind.""He can hardly talk. But ask him about cricket and he can go on day and night. He never takes any rest on the ground. Even during lunch or tea break, he is with me for fielding practice or knocking away or stretching with a senior player,"" he said.Records came hand-in-hand with Vaibhav as he recently made headlines after becoming the youngest international centurion in the 170-year history of competitive cricket at 13 years and 188 days in September this year.The opener scored a 62-ball 104, studded with 14 hits to the fence and four towering sixes, in the 1st youth test for India Under-19 against Australia Under-19 in Chennai.Vaibhav reached the three-figure mark in just 58 balls, which made him the fastest Indian youth test centurion, too, and the second-fastest in the world.Hailing from Samastipur, Bihar, he was the youngest debutant in Ranji Trophy history when he played against Mumbai at just 12 years and 284 days. With this feat, the rookie broke records held for years by the likes of Yuvraj Singh and Sachin Tendulkar.""He has always been getting attention from the crowd where he went to play Ranji trophy for being the youngest player and his enthusiasm on the ground,"" the coach says, adding he has no fear of fast bowling despite being the youngest in the team.Sanjeev Suryavanshi, a small farmer in Tajpur, Samastipur, and a part-time journalist with Hindi daily, was on cloud nine when his son Vaibhav called up from Dubai, where he is playing Asia Cup U-19 championship. His first match will be against Pakistan on November 30.""Rajasthan Royals (RR) and Delhi Capitals (DC) both had called him up for trial in Nagpur and Delhi. In Nagpur, he was asked to score 17 runs in one over. He hit three huge sixes in first three balls itself, making him a strong contender for RR team. He performed excellently in DC trials also. That's why DC was also interested in buying my son,"" the proud father said, while talking to TOI.Sanjeev recently sold his one kattha of land in Tajpur for the better future of his son's dream.Vaibhav is also the fourth youngest in the country to make first-class debut and the second youngest from Bihar when he played against Mumbai in Patna on January 6.Vaibhav played for Bihar in the 2023 edition of the Cooch Behar Trophy . In one of the matches against Jharkhand, he scored 151 runs off 128 balls with the help of 22 fours and three sixes. In the same match, he also scored 76. He also played in a quadrangular series involving India U-19 A, India U-19 B, England U-19 and Bangladesh U-19. He got scores of 53, 74, 0, 41 and 0 in the tournament. So far he has played 5 first-class games.Suryavanshi's meteoric rise in the last couple of years is more incredible in the backdrop of the controversy-ravaged Bihar cricket , which has made more news for wrong reasons ever since coming back into BCCI domestic fold from oblivion ahead of the 2018-19 Ranji Trophy.","Bihar prodigy Vaibhav Suryavanshi, 13, becomes youngest player to play in IPL. Rajasthan Royals snapped him up for Rs 1.10 crore after intense bidding at auction. He is the youngest player ever to be listed in the 16-year history of the league. He was the youngest debutant in Ranji Trophy history when he played against Mumbai.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115682182,imgsize-28070,width-400,resizemode-4/115682182.jpg"
World Chess Championship: Gukesh gets early wakeup call as Ding Liren takes exciting win in Game 1,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/chess/world-chess-championship-gukesh-gets-early-wakeup-call-as-ding-liren-takes-exciting-win-in-game-1/articleshow/115686808.cms,"D Gukesh and Ding Liren during game one of the WCC on Monday. (Photo by Roslan Rahman/AFP via Getty Images)

THE MOVES:

D Gukesh was ready to pounce, but he was not fully prepared for the counter-attack.Reigning world champion Ding Liren , 32, gave the 18-year-old Indian challenger a 'wake up and smell the coffee' moment in the opening battle of the 14-game World Chess Championship match in Singapore on Monday.The world No. 23 Chinese, who had accepted that he was an underdog, won in 42 moves of French defense Steinitz variation against an opponent who is world No. 5 and in red-hot form.It was a nervy contest, rich in nuances and high on spirit. For almost five hours, the followers were glued to their gadgets and apparently so was Ding, supposedly recovering from mental cobwebs. In the process, it was Gukesh's turn to get trapped.The winless run of 300-plus days didn't stop Ding from scoring his third career classical win against Gukesh - and all of them have come with black pieces. Gukesh is yet to score a classical win against the Asian giant and if he wants to avoid tiebreaks of shorter time controls, he has to win at least twice now to seal the deal. Gukesh did not make any dramatic mistakes or blunders; but there were oversights. Ding was more accurate and alert and raised the bar with good moves that his younger opponent didn't envisage at clutch moments.Once a regular opening, the French defense became extremely rare at the World Championship level since the 1978 Match onwards. And Ding last tried it against Nepo last year in the seventh game, also with black, and lost it. But this specific line - Classical Steinitz variation (named after the first ever world champion) was the first occurrence at this stage.Only one pawn and a knight were off the board till the 25th move as the players tried to wrest control. Though Ding castled late (31st move), his two knight moves (18..Nb2 and 32..Nd3) had precision written all over. Ding acknowledged it was a great win, but he was lucky too. ""I was worse out of the opening but overall, I played well. I thought he (Gukesh) might get nervous at the start of the match and hence I tried to play something unusual that I have not tried recently. And it worked to perfection.""Gukesh accepted that it's not a great start in his bid to become the youngest monarch of the sport. ""All depended on alertness,"" he said at the press conference later. ""I made a tactical oversight (GM and commentator Judit Polgar thought the mistakes were strategic). It can happen. I expected nothing else but the best version of Ding. Now, it gets more exciting since I am trailing.""Saying that he was playing on his own (out of the book) after Ding's 10th move that led to his first long thought, with stretched for almost 21 minutes, the Indian emphasised that his gameplan for the remaining contest won't change much. He intends to play with good energy and according to the positions and not be ultra-defensive.For the first 10 moves, Gukesh took just 90 seconds and Ding almost 50 minutes - the pawn move needing 28 minutes and a queen-push a further 15. But 12 moves later, Ding had the clock advantage (29 mins in hand for 28 moves to Gukesh's 24). And finally, it led to Gukesh needing to make seven moves in 45 seconds to reach the 40-move mark.1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.e5 Nfd7 5.f4 c5 6.Nce2 Nc6 7.c3 a5 8.Nf3 a4 9.Be3 Be7 10.g4 Qa5 11.Bg2 a3 12.b3 cxd4 13.b4 Qc7 14.Nexd4 Nb6 15.0-0 Nc4 16.Bf2 Bd7 17.Qe2 Nxd4 18.Nxd4 Nb2 19.Qe3 Rc8 20.Rac1 Qc4 21.f5 Qd3 22.Qe1 Bg5 23.Rc2 Rc4 24.h4 Bf4 25.Qb1 Rxc3 26.Rxc3 Qxc3 27.fxe6 fxe6 28.Ne2 Qxe5 29.Nxf4 Qxf4 30.Qc2 Qc4 31.Qd2 0-0 32.Bd4 Nd3 33.Qe3 Rxf1+ 34.Bxf1 e5 35.Bxe5 Qxg4+ 36.Bg2 Bf5 37.Bg3 Be4 38.Kh2 h6 39.Bh3 Qd1 40.Bd6 Qc2+ 41.Kg3 Qxa2 42.Be6+ Kh8 white resigned.","Reigning world champion Ding Liren gave the 18-year-old Indian challenger a 'wake up and smell the coffee' moment in the opening battle of the 14-game World Chess Championship match in Singapore on Monday.

NEW DELHI: The two-day Indian Premier League (IPL) auction concluded in the port city of Jeddah in Saudi Arabia on November 25, with Rishabh Pant emerging as the costliest buy, breaking the record of biggest price tag with a pay-cheque of a staggering Rs 27 crore from the Lucknow Super Giants (LSG).Batter Shreyas Iyer came a close second with a bid of Rs 26.75 crore, shelled out by the Punjab Kings.Rishabh Pant, who was not retained by Delhi Capitals (DC) and is currently playing the Test series in Australia, was bought by the LSG after an intense bidding war with Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) and Delhi -- taking his base-price of Rs 2 crore to a record rise. It will be the first time that Pant will move out of his hometown Delhi to play for another IPL side, and it required LSG to empty their pockets, breaking the record set by Australian pacer Mitchell Starc last year with his Rs 24.75 crore bid from Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR). In all likelihood, Pant will lead the LSG side, especially because KL Rahul is no longer with the Lucknow team.Shreyas Iyer took home a whopping Rs 26.75 crore pay-cheque from Punjab. Released by KKR ahead of the auction, Iyer had led the franchise to their third IPL title in 2024, after missing the entire 2023 season due to a back injury. However, he was still not retained by Kolkata. The 29-year-old was originally bought by KKR for Rs 12.25 crore in 2022, taking on the role of captain following seven seasons with Delhi Capitals. Punjab, who were also looking for a marquee player to lead the side, might appoint him as their skipper for the 2025 season.Venkatesh Iyer turned out to be a surprise star at the IPL 2025 mega auction, with reigning champions KKR splashing a massive Rs 23.75 crore to bring him back into the fold. The left-handed Iyer was not retained by KKR ahead of the auction. Iyer entered the auction with a base price of Rs 2 crore, with KKR making the first move for the star performer of their title-winning run in the last edition and eventually winning the bid after an intense battle with Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB).England white-ball captain Jos Buttler laughed his way to the bank as he raked in a jaw-dropping Rs 15.75 crore from 2022 champions Gujarat Titans (GT). After an intense three-way bidding war, GT secured the services of the England superstar for a whopping price. Buttler, who was not retained by Rajasthan Royals ahead of the auction, was part of the franchise for the last seven editions. Before joining Royals in 2018, Buttler had represented Mumbai Indians in 2016 and 2017 editions. Buttler also brings with him valuable experience and leadership qualities.KL Rahul was part of the marquee list at the auction and had a base price of Rs. 2 crore. He had entered the IPL auction after not being retained by LSG despite being their captain last season. Rahul has been a vital asset for multiple franchises over the years, including the Lucknow, Kings XI Punjab (now Punjab Kings), Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Sunrisers Hyderabad. With Pant no longer with DC, Rahul is the most likely candidate to lead the Delhi team in the 2025 season.Rajasthan Royals (RR) snapped up England pacer Jofra Archer for Rs 12.50 crore. The Royals, known for their strategic picks, brought back Archer, adding a world-class bowler to their roster. Archer, who played his last IPL season in 2020, was added back to the shortlist three days before the auction. The right-arm pacer made his comeback this summer after a lengthy injury layoff, featuring in England's white-ball series against Pakistan, Australia and the West Indies, as well as the T20 World Cup.MI bagged veteran New Zealand pacer Trent Boult, known for his early strikes with the new ball, for Rs 12.50 crore. The move will reunite the Kiwi left-arm pacer, who took 16 wickets in last IPL season but was still released by Rajasthan, will reunite with India’s ace fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah at MI. The pair was instrumental in Mumbai's title-winning campaign in 2020. It was their fifth and last crown. Overall, Boult has represented as many as five teams: Sunrisers Hyderabad, Kolkata Knight Riders, Delhi Capitals, Mumbai Indians and Rajasthan Royals in the cash-rich league.Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) has successfully re-acquired the Australian right-arm pacer Josh Hazlewood for Rs 12.5 crore. Having previously contributed to RCB's impressive 2021 season, Hazlewood is set to lead their pace attack once again. His proven skills in generating bounce and movement will significantly enhance RCB's fast-bowling department.Ishan Kishan will be turning up for a new franchise in the IPL as the youngster was sold to SRH for Rs 11.25 crore, which is 26% less than Rs 15.25 crore MI paid to buy him in the 2022 auction. Mumbai started the bidding for Kishan at his pace price of Rs 2 crore but didn't go beyond Rs 3.20 crore. Delhi Capitals, looking for a wicketkeeper-batter after Rishabh Pant wasn't retained, were in an intense bidding war with Punjab Kings before SRH joined the action late and got his services.Chennai Super Kings secured Afghanistan's young talent Noor Ahmad for Rs 10 crore after a fierce bidding contest ensued between Mumbai Indians and Chennai for the left-arm Afghanistan spinner's services. Initially acquired by CSK for Rs 5 crore, Ahmad's price doubled when GT's attempt to get him with the 'Right to Match' card was thwarted by CSK's elevated bid of Rs 10 crore. Chennai's acquisition of Ravichandran Ashwin, the retention of Ravindra Jadeja from IPL 2024 and the addition of Ahmad has established a formidable spin-bowling unit that appears well-suited to their home-ground conditions.","Indian Premier League (IPL) auction concluded in Jeddah in Saudi Arabia on November 25.

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings (CSK), the five-time IPL champions, have strategically built a well-rounded and dynamic squad for the IPL 2025 season , blending seasoned campaigners with emerging talent. The retention of core players like Ruturaj Gaikwad, Ravindra Jadeja, and MS Dhoni highlights CSK’s commitment to stability and experience.Having retained the core of their team for 2025 and beyond, CSK brought back Ravichandran Ashwin after 10 seasons at the IPL Auction in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and reunited him with Ravindra Jadeja. They also bolstered their spin attack and created backup in the form of Noor Ahmed.The five-time IPL champions also signed players who have the experience in domestic cricket but their IPL careers haven't created headlines in the years gone by. That list includes Rahul Tripathi, Vijay Shankar, Kamlesh Nagarkoti, Deepak Hooda and Shreyas Gopal.Out of the total purse of Rs 120 crore, which each franchise had before retaining players, CSK spent Rs 65 crore to retain five players, including the uncapped MS Dhoni (Rs 4 crore).The re-introduction of a rule in the IPL Player Regulations allowed CSK to retain Dhoni. The rule states that any player who hasn't played international cricket for five years or hasn't had a central contract for that period is considered uncapped.""I think we have got a well-balanced side. Good mix of experience and some exciting young players. The auction can ebb and flow. Sometimes you have got to hold your nerve,"" said the CSK head coach Stephen Fleming.Rs 119.95 crore","Chennai Super Kings IPL 2025 Squad: Batters, Wicketkeepers, Allrounders, Bowlers.

NEW DELHI: Under the guidance of new head coach Ricky Ponting, Punjab Kings (PBKS) are set to embark on a promising campaign in the IPL 2025 as they strategically utilized their largest purse (INR 110.5 crore) among all franchises to put together a balanced team.A significant move in their team assembly was the acquisition of Shreyas Iyer , a renowned Indian batsman, for an unprecedented sum of Rs 26.75 crore.Iyer, who previously led Kolkata Knight Riders to their third IPL victory in 2024, is expected to enhance PBKS's batting strength significantly.In addition to Iyer, PBKS has also fortified its bowling lineup by signing Arshdeep Singh and Yuzvendra Chahal, both for Rs 18 crore. These players are among India's top wicket-takers in T20Is, promising to add depth and versatility to the team's bowling department, potentially making it one of the most competitive in the league.Prior to the auction, PBKS retained two of its key players, Shashank Singh and Prabhsimran Singh, for INR 5.5 crore and INR 4 crore, respectively.Shashank Singh has been recognized for his impactful performances as a middle-order batsman and a part-time bowler, while Prabhsimran Singh has been valued for his explosive batting at the top order and his skills as a wicketkeeper.Since its inception in 2008, PBKS, formerly known as Kings XI Punjab, have experienced a mix of highs and lows, with their best performance being a runner-up finish in 2014.However, inconsistency and frequent changes in leadership have been major obstacles in their quest for the title. The appointment of Ricky Ponting as head coach signifies a strategic shift towards stability, tactical acumen, and long-term planning in pursuit of success.With a substantial budget and a strategic approach to the auction, PBKS focused on addressing key areas such as securing a consistent top-order batsman, experienced finishers, and specialist bowlers for the death overs.This approach underlines their ambition to build a well-rounded and competitive squad for IPL 2025 , aiming to overcome past inconsistencies and achieve their long-awaited championship victory.Meanwhile, the BCCI has taken a significant step by announcing the schedules for the IPL for the next three seasons.

Iyer, known for his leadership and consistent batting, brings immense value to PBKS, especially after leading KKR to the title in 2024. Adding to their firepower, PBKS secured Arshdeep Singh and Yuzvendra Chahal, two of India’s premier bowlers, for INR 18 crore each. Arshdeep’s ability to excel in death overs and Chahal’s expertise in middle-overs spin make them indispensable assets.The squad was further bolstered by the acquisitions of versatile players like Marcus Stoinis (INR 11 crore), Glenn Maxwell (INR 4.2 crore), and Marco Jansen (INR 5.75 crore), ensuring depth in both batting and bowling. Notably, PBKS retained key players Prabhsimran Singh and Shashank Singh, reinforcing their commitment to stability.PBKS's auction strategy reflects their focus on addressing past inconsistencies.

Rishabh Pant became the most expensive player at IPL 2025 Auction and in the history of the league after the flashy left-handed wicketkeeper-batter was taken by Lucknow Super Giants for Rs 27 crore. Pant became LSG's obvious choice as team leader as they broke bank for his credentials.Shreyas Iyer had become the most expensive IPL player for a brief period when Punjab Kings spent Rs 26.75 crore on him. He had played his cricket for defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders last season and led them to the title.Another notable signing over the two-day IPL Auction was that of 13-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi. From a base price of Rs 30 lakh, the teenager went to Rajasthan Royals for Rs 1.10 crore in a deal that captured the attention of many.Out of the national team setup for over two years, Bhuvneshwar Kumar’s experience found high demand among IPL franchises, with Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) securing his services for Rs 10.75 crore on Monday.The second day of the mega auction turned out to be lucrative for several Indian pacers, while some big names, including Shardul Thakur, Prithvi Shaw, Ajinkya Rahane, Kane Williamson, and Glenn Phillips, went unsold.Set to turn 35 before the start of the next IPL season, Bhuvneshwar boasts an impressive record of 300 wickets in 287 T20 matches with an economy rate under eight.Other notable deals included Deepak Chahar, who fetched Rs 9.25 crore from Mumbai Indians despite his injury history, and Mukesh Kumar, retained by Delhi Capitals for Rs 8 crore through the RTM card. Lucknow Super Giants also invested heavily, signing Test pacer Akash Deep for Rs 8 crore.Among the all-rounders, Krunal Pandya earned Rs 5.75 crore from RCB, who were in need of an experienced spin-bowling all-rounder. Rajasthan Royals made significant bids for Tushar Deshpande (Rs 6.50 crore) and Nitish Rana (Rs 4.20 crore), while Delhi Capitals secured former RCB skipper Faf du Plessis at a bargain base price of Rs 2 crore. Gujarat Titans acquired Washington Sundar for Rs 3.20 crore in another smart move.The scarcity of quality Indian seam-bowling all-rounders worked in favor of South Africa’s Marco Jansen, who secured a Rs 7 crore deal with Punjab Kings. Also making a major gain was veteran New Zealand pacer Trent Boult who was bought by Mumbai Indians for Rs 12.5 crore -- highlighting the demand for quality fast bowlers.Meanwhile, the auction reflected the high demand for Indian talent despite the limited options, ensuring lucrative deals for even fringe players.On Sunday, the first day of the auction, most of the high-profile names raked in the moolah as the franchises virtually emptied their pockets to bag the priority players in their respective shortlist.Led by Rs 27 crore Lucknow Super Giants spent to buy star wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant, the sum of money splurged by the franchises came to a whopping INR 467.95 crore.Pant edged past Shreyas Iyer, who fetched Rs 26.75 crore from Punjab Kings, as teams went all out for marquee Indian stars. Venkatesh Iyer took home a whopping Rs 23.75 crore from KKR.A total of 84 players from the roster of 577 were presented on the opening day at the Abadi Al Johar Arena. Out of these 68 got sold, while four were retained through the Right-to-Match card.Among other big buys, leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal attracted Rs 18 crore from Punjab Kings, who also used the Right-to-Match card to bring back paceman Arshdeep Singh for Rs 18 crore. KL Rahul was picked up by Delhi Capitals for Rs 14 crore.Meanwhile, the BCCI has taken a significant step by announcing the schedules for the IPL for the next three seasons. This is a departure from the usual practice of releasing schedules closer to the tournament.The 2025 IPL will commence on March 14 and conclude on May 25.The IPL Auction 2025 showcased a dramatic and competitive bidding war, with several franchises securing high-profile talent to strengthen their squads for the upcoming season. The second day saw Indian pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar topping the chart with a hefty price of INR 10.75 crore, reflecting the high demand for experienced fast bowlers despite his long absence from the national team. This influx of Indian talent demonstrates how IPL franchises value local players, often resulting in hefty bids even for those not part of the national setup.Franchises made smart moves by picking up key players based on specific team needs. Deepak Chahar, for example, fetched Rs 9.25 crore despite a history of injuries, highlighting the increasing reliance on proven seamers. Meanwhile, Mumbai Indians, who often make shrewd investments, secured both Mukesh Chahar and Deepak Chahar, bolstering their pace attack for IPL 2025. Lucknow Super Giants also impressed with strategic buys like Akash Deep, further reinforcing their depth in bowling.Notably, there was also a surge in the prices of all-rounders like Krunal Pandya (Rs 5.75 crore) and Washington Sundar (Rs 3.20 crore), whose versatility adds immense value to their respective teams. This indicates that franchises are looking for players who can contribute with both bat and ball, especially in the high-pressure, multifaceted environment of the IPL.The auction was also marked by some surprising omissions. Players like Shardul Thakur, Prithvi Shaw, Ajinkya Rahane, and Kane Williamson, who are usually regarded as top performers, went unsold, pointing to the shifting dynamics of IPL team strategies. While these players' exclusion may have shocked fans, it underlined the intense competition for spots and the changing nature of what franchises are looking for in their squads.Overall, the 2025 auction was a testament to the evolving nature of IPL strategies—teams focused on a mix of experience, youth, and flexibility. As the season nears, fans can look forward to an exciting and unpredictable tournament, with new combinations and fresh talent ready to light up the IPL stage.","Bhuvneshwar Kumar, out of India's national team for two years, fetched a hefty Rs 10.75 crore from RCB in the IPL 2025 auction.

Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Is Jasprit Bumrah the greatest ever Indian fast bowler?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-australia/is-jasprit-bumrah-the-greatest-ever-indian-fast-bowler/articleshow/115714708.cms,"ICONS, GENERATIONS APART: Jasprit Bumrah bowls in the Perth Test and Kapil Dev in action in Sydney, 1986

The numbers at this stage of his career would suggest so, but nothing would have been possible without the great

, the fast-bowling flagbearer who played lone ranger...

Yashasvi Jaiswal and Jasprit Bumrah stole the show in India's Perth win

The other day, as Jasprit Bumrah was wreaking havoc in Perth, Sunil Gavaskar couldn't help going back to that February morning in 1981 in Melbourne. On that day, an injured Kapil Dev won India an incredible Test match, taking 5-28 against a top Australian lineup, which folded for 83 in the second innings as India defended 143 to level the series.""This generation sometimes forgets that there were Indian teams before 2000 which also fought and won,"" Gavaskar said on air.The original Little Master's comment becomes pertinent in the context of the social-media wave hailing Bumrah as the greatest Indian pace bowler.There's no denying the fact that with an average of 20.06 and a strike-rate of 43.6 after 41 Tests, Bumrah's numbers are suggesting that he is way ahead of the pack, including the great Kapil, who finished with a career-average of 29.64 and a strike-rate of 63.9.It's Bumrah's ability to rip open batting lineups on any surface that has made him the best paceman in the eyes of this generation.As the world swoons over Bumrah, and justifiably so, there's a worrying tendency to forget spells like Kapil's 9-83 in Ahmedabad against West Indies, in which he dismissed Gordon Greenidge, Desmond Haynes, Viv Richards and Clive Lloyd Former India opener WV Raman, who played with and against Kapil, feels the greatness of the 434-wicket man was his ability to deliver for so long with ""sporadic support"".""Bumrah has fantastic backup, which Kaps didn't always have. Add to that the changes in the laws of the game, with DRS coming into the equation. The one thing common about Bumrah and Kapil is that they don't mind the kind of surface that they are asked to bowl on. They have the ability to find ways to pick up wickets regardless of the nature of the pitch,"" Raman told TOI.To put things in perspective, Kapil and Bumrah are completely different bowlers. While the 'Haryana Hurricane' was beautifully orthodox with a smooth run-up, Bumrah's action throws the guide book out of the window.He almost defies the laws of physics with his ability to release the ball about 34 cm ahead of the popping crease, when most bowlers release it within 10 cm ahead of the line. This extra 24 cm that Bumrah gets from his release point makes him a terror as he gets the ball to hurry on to the batter like nobody else.Atul Wassan, former India pace bowler who made his debut when Kapil was in the latter stages of his career, explains how an action like Bumrah's would have finished a bowler's career in the late 1980s.""In those days when I was growing up, if somebody came with that kind of an action like that, he would probably have been asked to go home by the coach. Cricket has changed so much. It is wonderful to see how Bumrah has defied laws to become the bowler that he is. But the comparison with Kapil doesn't stand because they are completely different in more ways than one - it's a bit like apples and oranges,"" Wassan said.For the former Delhi pacer, Kapil's greatness was not just about the bowling numbers but what he meant to a generation of players dreaming to become cricketers. ""He was not just a bowler - add the 5000 odd Test runs that he got. He was inspiring a generation of bowlers, there were at least 40-50 next Kapil Devs, including me, and see where they are. It is important to look beyond the numbers,"" Wassan said.Another former India paceman, Lakshmipathy Balaji , who was very close to becoming India's bowling coach before Morne Morkel pipped him to the post, has a lot of respect for what Bumrah is doing. But he, too, insists that the support Bumrah has is completely different to what Kapil had for most of his career.Add to that the fact that Kapil had nothing to fall back on when he was starting off, from bowling with the old ball to maintaining his body to learning how to bowl reverse swing. There was no one to teach him how to do it, the master had to pick everything up on his own as he played.""This is not to take anything away from Bumrah, but Bum came into the Indian team, he had Ishant Sharma with more than 250 Test wickets and Mohammed Shami , another magnificent bowler. Just see who Kapil had for support, there was no pace bowler close to 100 Test wickets in that era. These things do make a lot of difference,"" Balaji, who was a key member of India's first series win in Pakistan in 2004, said.Bumrah, unlike Kapil, is not a natural athlete, but it is his ability to surpass the obstacles that has made him the match-winner that he is. Bumrah's ability to fight back from career threatening injuries gets a massive thumbs up from Balaji, but he wonders where Kapil's numbers would have gone if he had got the support of sports science that players of this era can avail.""Kapil's body was a gift of god, but in those days there wasn't much consciousness on how to make it even better. Would Kapil have cut down on his pace if he had the infrastructural support of today? And don't forget, he still played 15 years of international cricket, beat a top Pakistan team virtually single-handedly in a Test series (1979-80), drew two Test series in Australia and led India to an ODI World Cup and a series win in England,"" Balaji said.But then again, that's just stats. The truth is Kapil made India believe in a dream 40 years ago and Bumrah is turning that into a reality.",Bumrah has an average of 20.06 and a strike-rate of 43.6 after 41 Tests. Kapil Dev finished his career with a career-average of 29.64. Bumrah's action throws the guide book out of the window. He almost defies the laws of physics.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115714685,imgsize-54060,width-400,resizemode-4/115714685.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Rishabh Pant created history by becoming the most expensive buy ever in an IPL auction as Lucknow Super Giants broke the bank to acquire the wicketkeeper batter during the mega auction in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia on Sunday.After being released by the Delhi Capitals, Pant became the most sought-after player in the auction, sparking a fierce bidding war before Lucknow Super Giants outbid Sunrisers Hyderabad and Delhi Capitals to acquire him for a staggering Rs 27 crore.For the first time in his IPL career, Pant will don the jersey of a franchise other than Delhi Capitals, having played every season for them since making his debut in 2016.Pant has overtaken Australian pacer Mitchell Starc as the most expensive player in IPL history.

His most successful batting performance came during IPL 2018, where he accumulated 684 runs whilst maintaining a strike rate of 173.60.During IPL 2019, Pant emerged as DC's second-highest scorer with 488 runs at a strike rate of 162.66, contributing significantly to the team's first playoff qualification since 2012.When Shreyas Iyer suffered an injury before IPL 2021, Pant was appointed as DC's captain. Under his leadership, the team reached the summit of the points table before the Covid-19 pandemic interrupted the season. Upon the tournament's resumption later in 2021, DC retained Pant as their skipper.Pant was retained by the Delhi Capitals in 2022 for Rs 16 crore per season for the next three editions of the IPL.In 111 IPL matches, Pant has scored 3,284 runs at an impressive average of 35.31 and a strike rate of 148.93, including one century and 18 fifties.

Ten years ago on November 27, the cricketing world received a shock when the 25-year-old Australian batter Phillip Hughes died in the hospital, two days after being hit by a ball in the lower part of his head while batting in a Sheffield Shield match.All efforts to save him went in vain as internal bleeding in the head didn't respond to emergency surgery and the life support was turned off on November 27.Remembering Phillip on his 10th death anniversary, the family paid a touching tribute, talking about him as the ""the light of our lives"".The Hughes family has put together a documentary on Phillip with the help of Cricket Australia, which will be part of the commemoration event before the start of the second Border Gavaskar Trophy Test between Australia and India a the Adelaide Oval. The documentary is titled 'The Boy from Macksville'.Players in the Sheffield Shield have been wearing black armbands in matches since Saturday as a mark of tribute to Phillip.""Today marks the 10-year anniversary of the passing of our treasured son and brother, Phillip Joel Hughes,"" the family said in its message.""He always aimed to make those around him smile and enjoy the little things in life, where his beautiful smile would come to life. He shined bright even in the tough times, which is a testament to who he was as a person, and we loved everything about him. He was the light of our lives.

World Chess Championship: Gukesh holds with black; Ding leads 14-game match 1.5-0.5,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/chess/world-chess-championship-gukesh-holds-with-black-ding-leads-14-game-match-1-5-0-5/articleshow/115717005.cms,"EYE FOR AN EYE: Gukesh and Ding played out a 23-move draw on Tuesday. (FIDE Photo)

D Gukesh is not back on track in the World Chess Championship match yet, but he has regrouped himself. And that was good enough to pass as satisfactory as he drew the second game with black pieces against Ding Liren in Singapore on Tuesday.World No. 1 Magnus Carlsen had predicted that after the reversal in the opening game with white, Gukesh won't be able to win the entire match the next day. He could also lose if he fumbled again, Carlsen told Take Take Take.Gukesh returns to white in the third of the 14 classical games on Wednesday, before Thursday's rest day even as China's reigning champion retains his one-point lead with the scoreline of 1.5-0.5.The second game was neither dramatic nor exceptional. Ding again decided the opening choice and the draw was forced after about two hours, 45 minutes and just 23 moves in the Italian Four Knights variation (also known as Guico Piano) where both players made seven knight moves. The players used the exception in the rule -three-fold repetition to split a point -as draw by agreement is not allowed before the 41st move.The Italian opening has been played only three times in World Championship matches this century - in 2021, Carlsen beat Nepo with black and had two draws with Sergei Karjakin in 2016. But the Four Knights version was seen for the first time on Tuesday.During their drawn face-off in the Sinquefield Cup in Saint Louis earlier this August, the players had used the Italian opening. Ding had also been involved in two more Italians in the same tournament against Anish Giri and Wesley So, but on Tuesday, he deviated to Four Knights variation.Both bishops and queens were exchanged by the 13th move soon after they castled. But before that, Gukesh rightly refused the bait of taking Ding's a5 pawn.The 32-year-old world No. 23 gave away the open 'd' file in hope of some counterplay but it was difficult to make any concrete progress with all eight pawns on the board. After spending considerable time on the board, the players decided it was not worth stretching things and took the game to a peaceful path with knight moves.""The opening was not a huge surprise. It was one of the topical lines,"" Gukesh assessed the game afterwards, ""I was just trying to recollect what I had seen. I had a fairly comfortable position. White had a very slight edge; but if Black is careful, which I was (it was not difficult to draw).""After the recent experience of the opening defeat, the 18-year-old Indian challenger was understandably circumspect. Instead of talking about his skills, confidence and nerves management, he said, ""One game at a time and hoping it will go my way.""Referring to Monday's defeat, Gukesh said, ""We knew things could happen. Losing is a part of the game. It was not a shock. We were prepared (for that eventuality). And we are sticking to a plan.""Gukesh maintained that since Tuesday's game was nowhere close to a must-win situation, he wouldn't do anything stupid. ""The only way to try and win is to play a good game,"" he said.Ding revealed that he misplayed the opening prep even though he played the first 12 moves in four minutes compared to Gukesh's 24 minutes. However, five-time world champion V Anand was of the opinion during the official webcast that Ding had won the opening battle. ""I could be slightly worse too. The basic idea was to play carefully,"" Ding said later, ""I was completely fine with a draw.""On the third game Wednesday, Ding said, ""I think it will be a big fight because my rival is a point down and he has white pieces. I am ready for a fight.""And for a change, he didn't sound merely optimistic.",Gukesh returns to white in the third of the 14 classical games on Wednesday. China's reigning champion retains his one-point lead with the scoreline of 1.5-0.5. Ding revealed that he misplayed the opening prep even though he played the first 12 moves in four minutes compared to Gukesh's 24 minutes.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115716977,imgsize-69152,width-400,resizemode-4/115716977.jpg"

Xavier McKinney skips Packers walk-through for personal matter



As the Green Bay Packers gear up to face the Miami Dolphins this Thursday, both teams navigated their preparation this week without conventional practices, opting instead for walkthrough sessions. This approach led to estimated participation reports being issued rather than standard injury updates.For the Packers, a notable change in Tuesday’s walkthrough was the absence of safety Xavier McKinney, who was marked as a non-participant due to a personal issue. Head coach Matt LaFleur expressed confidence in McKinney’s return, stating he expected the safety back by Tuesday night and available for the next session on Wednesday.The Packers also adjusted their injury report with some encouraging updates. Defensive tackle Kenny Clark and offensive lineman Elgton Jenkins, who rested on Monday, were upgraded to full participation. Similarly, tackle Rasheed Walker, nursing a knee injury, also participated fully on Tuesday.However, challenges remain for Green Bay, with five key players still sidelined. Cornerback Jaire Alexander, linebacker Edgerrin Cooper, receiver Romeo Doubs, tight end John FitzPatrick, and linebacker Isaiah McDuffie were all listed as non-participants for the second consecutive day. Their continued absence casts doubt on their availability for Thursday’s game, raising concerns about the team’s depth and defensive lineup against Miami.The Dolphins, meanwhile, mirrored the Packers’ walk-through approach on Tuesday. Star receiver Tyreek Hill was notably absent due to a personal issue, raising speculation about his readiness for the upcoming game. Miami also added safety Patrick McMorris to their injury list, citing an ankle problem, further compounding their concerns ahead of the critical matchup.As both teams finalize preparations, the availability of these key players will likely influence the outcome of Thursday’s contest. With the Packers looking to bolster their defensive efforts and the Dolphins managing their offensive lineup, fans are eagerly watching injury updates for last-minute changes that could sway the game.Also Read: ""I haven't talked about it all year"": Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy responds to Jerry Jones’s intriguing comments on his contract status This matchup, balancing injury management and strategic planning, promises to test the depth and resilience of both teams in what could be a pivotal game for their respective seasons.","Green Bay Packers and Miami Dolphins both held walk-through sessions on Tuesday.

Manchester City ’s woes deepened in the Champions League on Tuesday as Pep Guardiola’s side squandered a 3-0 lead to draw 3-3 with Feyenoord at the Etihad Stadium.Meanwhile, Bayern Munich defeated Paris Saint-Germain, putting the French club on the brink of elimination. Elsewhere, Arsenal, Atletico Madrid, Atalanta, and Bayer Leverkusen claimed dominant wins, while Inter Milan climbed to the top of the standings after five matches.The most dramatic action unfolded in Manchester, where City seemed to be cruising after goals from Erling Haaland (two, including a penalty) and Ilkay Gundogan’s deflected strike gave them a 3-0 advantage by the 57th minute.However, Feyenoord’s comeback began in the 75th minute when Anis Hadj Moussa capitalized on defensive errors to score. Substitute Santiago Gimenez reduced the deficit further in the 82nd minute, and the equalizer came a minute from full-time.Igor Paixao set up David Hancko, who headed home to complete a remarkable turnaround.Lewandowski notched his 100th goal in the competition with an early penalty in Barcelona's 3-0 home win over French side Brest.Dani Olmo netted midway through the second half before Lewandowski sealed Barca's win at the death, his 101st goal in the Champions League -- only Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi have scored more.Inter lead the standings with 13 points, a point ahead of Barcelona and Liverpool, after a 1-0 win at home to RB Leipzig which means they are also still yet to concede a goal.Castello Lukeba's own goal made the difference at San Siro, and Leipzig are one of only three teams to have lost five games out of five.Arsenal romped to a 5-1 victory away to Sporting in Lisbon, as the Portuguese side adapt to life without coach Ruben Amorim, who has departed for Manchester United.Gabriel Martinelli, Kai Havertz and Gabriel Magalhaes all scored in the first half for Arsenal, before Goncalo Inacio pulled one back shortly after the restart.Bukayo Saka converted a penalty on 65 minutes after Martin Odegaard had been brought down, and Leandro Trossard headed in to seal Arsenal's win late on.Atalanta romped to a 6-1 win over rock-bottom Young Boys in Switzerland, with Mateo Retegui and Charles De Ketelaere both scoring braces.Sead Kolasinac and Lazar Samardzic also netted for the Italians, with Silvere Ganvoula getting the hosts' reply.Florian Wirtz struck twice, including a penalty, as Leverkusen crushed Red Bull Salzburg 5-0, with Alejandro Grimaldo scoring a superb free-kick and Patrik Schick and Aleix Garcia also netting.Julian Alvarez and substitute Angel Correa each scored twice and Marcos Llorente and Antoine Griezmann once as Atletico romped to a 6-0 win away to Sparta Prague.Christian Pulisic, Rafael Leao and Tammy Abraham were the scorers in AC Milan's 3-2 win at Slovan Bratislava, whose goals came from Tigran Barseghyan and Nino Marcelli.Marko Tolic saw red at the end for Slovan, who are without a point.Bukayo Saka scored one goal and set up another as Arsenal thrashed Portuguese side Sporting 5-1 in their Champions League clash at the Estadio Jose Alvalade on Tuesday, their biggest away win in the competition in 21 years.Gabriel Martinelli put Arsenal ahead early on before Kai Havertz and Brazilian defender Gabriel added two more goals before halftime as Arsenal overwhelmed their hosts.Goncalo Inacio pulled a goal back for Sporting early in the second period, but Saka restored Arsenal's three-goal advantage with a penalty and Leandro Trossard got a fifth for their biggest away win in the Champions League since victory by the same scoreline at Inter Milan in 2003.Arsenal moved above Sporting to seventh place in the 36-team table with 10 points from their five games. The Portuguese side have the same number of points but are one position back on goal-difference.Inter Milan took another step towards direct qualification for the last 16 of the Champions League with Tuesday's 1-0 win over Leipzig which moved the Italians top of the table.Castello Lukeba's own goal midway through the first half was enough for Inter, who are the only team yet to concede a goal, to win their fourth straight match in Europe's elite club competition.Italian champions Inter lead Barcelona and Liverpool, who host Real Madrid on Wednesday, by a point after a narrow win which should have finished with a more emphatic scoreline for the hosts.Simone Inzaghi's side return to their Serie A title defence at high-flying Fiorentina on Sunday after a routine win at a far from full San Siro which makes a top-eight finish extremely likely with three matches remaining.","Manchester City squandered a 3-0 lead to draw 3-3 with Feyenoord at the Etihad Stadium.

Rishabh Pant becomes most expensive IPL player after he goes to LSG for Rs 27 crore at IPL auction

'It was a great feeling': Debutant Nitish Reddy on getting cap from idol Virat Kohli

New Delhi: Royal Challengers Bengaluru bought 19 players at the IPL 2025 Auction in Jeddah and their strategy seemed very clear. The franchise didn't look desperate for a captaincy option and were smart with their bids at the two-day event. The most expensive player bought by the franchise was Josh Hazlewood for Rs 12.50 crore and it wasn't a surprise that their bids for Rishabh Pant and KL Rahul - two prominent captaincy options in the pool - didn't cross Rs 11 crore and Rs 10.50 crore respectively.As TimesofIndia.com had reported Virat Kohli is set to return as RCB captain from the 2025 edition and the makeup of the 22-member (19 buys and three retentions) squad points in that direction too. They went after Pant and Rahul but the bidding pattern wasn't desperate. It seemed like bids for the two players was to form the the core but not as a leadership option. They didn't even raise the paddle for another option - Shreyas Iyer - who eventually went to Punjab Kings for Rs 26.75 crore RCB were aggressive for both Pant and Rahul at the start, but the moment the bid crossed the Rs 10 crore mark, they were happy to play spectator as teams like Lucknow Super Giants, Sunrisers Hyderabad and Delhi Capitals went after Pant, and DC, Kolkata Knight Riders, Chennai Super Kings seemed in no mood to let Rahul go.And it wasn't a surprise that they didn't go back to former skipper Faf Du Plessis who could have come cheaper than the Rs 7 crore they were paying earlier.The franchise, which is yet to win an IPL title, have assembled a strong squad for the new cycle and would hope to end the long wait under Kohli, the player who has been with them since the inaugural edition.As reporter earlier, Kohli has already had those discussions with the management and made his intentions of stepping into the leadership role clear. He had led RCB from 2013-2021 and the side reached playoffs on four occasions and came agonisingly close to winning the title in 2016 where they lost to SRH in the title clash.Both Kohli the captain and Kohli the player have unfinished business in the IPL and it remains to be seen whether 2025 could be that year.",Royal Challengers Bengaluru bought 19 players at the IPL 2025 Auction in Jeddah and their strategy seemed very clear.

NEW DELHI: The IPL 2025 Mega Auction concluded with massive bids for some players, surprising steals for others, and a few left unsold. While Virat Kohli remains a marquee name, retained by Royal Challengers Bangalore for Rs 21 crore, several players surpassed his pay scale in this year's auction.Former Delhi Capitals captain Rishabh Pant created history by becoming the most expensive player ever in the IPL. Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) secured him for an unprecedented Rs 27 crore at the Abadi Al Johar Arena in Jeddah on Sunday.LSG initiated the bidding war, countered aggressively by Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB). The price crossed Rs 10 crore quickly, reflecting Pant’s immense value as a leader and a match-winner. Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) joined the fray at Rs 10.5 crore, pushing the price above Rs 20 crore.Just as Delhi Capitals (DC) played their Right to Match (RTM) card, LSG responded with the record-breaking Rs 27 crore bid, leaving DC unable to compete.Pant, previously Delhi’s captain for three seasons, was released ahead of the mega auction as DC retained Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Tristan Stubbs, and Abhishek Porel.Shreyas Iyer was the first player to break the auction record before Pant overtook him.

Complete statement issued by friends and family:

'Would have gone from strength to strength'

Friends, family and teammates of late Australian cricketer Phillip Hughes paid their tributes on Wednesday, marking 10 years since he died after being struck on the neck while batting.Hughes, who played 26 Tests for Australia, died from bleeding on the brain after he was hit by a ball during a domestic match at the Sydney Cricket Ground on 27 November, 2014.Visuals of a 25-year-old Hughes lying helplessly on the pitch as players rushed to his side shocked world cricket, sparking an outpouring of grief and calls to make the game safer.""Today marks the 10-year anniversary of the passing of our treasured son and brother, Phillip Joel Hughes.Phillip was a loving, humorous and an infectious person to be around. He always aimed to make those around him smile and enjoy the little things in life, where his beautiful smile would come to life. He shined bright even in the tough times, which is a testament to who he was as a person, and we loved everything about him. He was the light of our lives. Phillip had a profound love for his family and lived his life with respect to everyone around him.Phillip, the small-town country boy, became an Australian Test, One-Day and Twenty-20 cricketer, where he played on the toughest pitches around the globe, alongside the toughest of cricketers on the world stage, but never forgot where he came from and who helped along the way.He was a unique individual that took risky and adventurous strides to conquer the dreams he set for himself to become Test baggy green number 408. He played cricket for all the right reasons and had the ability to take it all in his stride. He loved being a part of a team and representing Australia for the game he loved so deeply.The number of stories, laughs shared, phone calls and conversations wouldn’t be able to be told over a quick drink at the local pub, which leads us to having the opportunity nine years ago to create the official biography of Phillip – ‘Phillip Hughes The Official Biography’ that gave us the pleasure of sharing more about who Phillip was. Those pages consisted of his journey from his childhood to his final legacy of 63 NOT OUT*.10 years on, a documentary – ‘The Boy from Macksville’, will be shared alongside Cricket Australia , who we’d like to thank for supporting this endeavour and each person who worked tirelessly behind the scenes for creating a celebration of Phillip’s life. We hope we have been able to showcase that dreams really do come true and you will enjoy seeing his family, friends and teammates give more of an insight into his career from his baggy blue, baggy red, baggy green and many more moments in-between including unseen footage that can be watched for generations to come.We hope between the biography and documentary, young cricketers around the world and everyone that was with Phillip along the way, will see the hard working, dedicated, devoted and rare cricketer he was. His extraordinary talent is known by many but his lasting impression of who he was as a person will always be remembered, which makes us extremely proud of him. Phillip was always proud of the younger cricketing generation he met along the way and was always hoping he could be an inspiration, no matter where you were from and that is also our hope.Cricket gave Phillip the stepping stone to start a new adventure of Four O Eight Angus, named after his proud baggy green test cap number. Black Stud Angus Cattle farming back in our hometown of Macksville, where he loved the land and his animals and would tell anyone who would listen. The business was built on dedication and it’s a testimony to how high he climbed. He loved to symbolise his cricketing journey in his farming career as a tribute, which still stands proud today. Phillip loved Macksville and the local surrounding towns, where he was able to come back throughout his cricketing years and felt right back at home.We want to share our appreciation to everyone who has respected our privacy and wishes throughout the last decade and continuing to do so at this time. Thank you for being on this journey with Phillip, he loved taking everyone along with him on this ride, living out his childhood dreams.It is essential for us to express our heartfelt thanks, sincere gratitude and appreciation to our extended family and friends, our hometown of Macksville and surrounding towns, to the wider cricketing community in Australia and overseas and the farming community.Phillip, we love you, we miss you and we are forever proud of you. We think about you every day and we are so thankful you were ours. Thank you for being the most extraordinary son and loving brother.""- signed The Hughes Family of Gregory and Virginia, Jason, Danielle, Charlie and Billy, Megan and Curtis.Former teammate David Warner said Hughes would have been just as good, ""if not better"", than himself and Steve Smith.""I'd like to think he was probably a more complete player than what I was,"" he told Australia's NewsCorp. Darren Lehmann , Australia's coach at the time of Hughes' death, said the promising batter would have gone on to play ""120 Test matches, there's no doubt about that"".""He would've just gone from strength to strength, the way he played,"" he told national broadcaster ABC.Cricket Australia said Hughes' memory would live ""forever in our hearts"", declaring he would be ""forever 63 not out"" -- his score at the time he was struck. CA has announced a series of events to mark the anniversary, coinciding with the second Test between Australia and India in Adelaide from December 6.Meanwhile, players in upcoming domestic cricket matches across Australia will wear black armbands in his honour.","Hughes, who played 26 Tests for Australia, died from bleeding on the brain after he was hit by a ball during a domestic match at the Sydney Cricket Ground on 27 November, 2014.

NEW DELHI: Indian Premier League franchise Delhi Capitals had a fantastic two-day mega auction in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia where they hogged the limelight with their marquee buy of star India batter KL Rahul.Having retained Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Tristan Stubbs and Abishek Porel, the Delhi-based franchise made a steal deal with Rahul as he was bought for Rs 14 crore.After the two-day affair concluded on Monday, DC have pulled off a near-perfect squad which has a terrific mix of experience and youth. While DC had quite a few impressive buys at the auction alongside Rahul, bringing in the likes of Aussie speedster Mitchell Starc and Englishman Harry Brook, their strategy in picking the India domestic young guns also turned out to be quite interesting.Late on the second day of the auction, DC picked domestic talents in bulk and at low prices -- majorly all-rounder -- indicating an investment into the future.And the credit for that goes to former India cricketer Vijay Bharadwaj, who in October, had joined the franchise as the head of the talent scout wing.Along with DC director of cricket Venugopal Rao, who hails from Andhra and keenly follows state cricket, Bharadwaj was instrumental in zeroing in on the local talent as they picked the lesser-known players from the franchise trials, state leagues.Six fringe players -- Manvanth Kumar (30 Lakh), Madhav Tiwari (40 Lakh), Tripurana Vijay (30 Lakh), Ajay Mandal (30 Lakh), Vipraj Nigam (50 Lakh) and Darshan Nalkande (30 Lakh) -- were all picked by the franchise around their base prices as the franchise went big on local all-rounders.Here's a quick look at the 'desi' talents and how they have fared in India's domestic circuit.Ajay Jadav Mandal, who hails from Madhya Pradesh has got quite decent experience in India's domestic circuit.The 28-year-old represents Chattisgarh and made his First Class debut back in 2016.The all-rounder bats left-handed and is a slow, orthodox spinner.Interestingly, Ajay was picked by Chennai Super Kings previously but was not given a chance in the XI.Before the 2025 auction, Ajay scored -- 69, 66, 11*, 64, 21, 69, 57*, 2, 51*, 21, 63 -- heavily with the bat at no.7-8 and also picked a decent number of wickets in Ranji Trophy.Ajay has featured in 39 First Class games for Chhattisgarh and has a total of 1,822 runs and 124 wickets to his name. With the bat, Ajay has hit 241* in Ranji and has best figures of 7/7.Ajay also has featured in 30 List A and 42 T20s where he has 852 runs and 71 wickets combined.Skiddy pacer Darshan Nalkande, born in Wardha, Maharashtra has a bulk of experience in domestic cricket, including IPL.The 26-year-old plays for Vidarbha and has six Ranji games to his name. To go with that, Darshan has been part of Gujarat Titans and Punjab Kings set-up in the past.Although Darshan never played for Punjab Kings, he featured in six IPL matches for Titans over the last three years where he picked up 6 wickets.In List A cricket, Darshan has 49 wickets in 29 outings while in T20s he has 73 scalps in 47 matches.Darshan was also previously picked for India U19 team for the youth Asia Cup but couldn't make the World Cup squad.Born in Tekkali, Andhra Pradesh, young Tripurana Vijay has made steady progress in Indian domestic cricket.The 23-year-old represents Andhra and made his Ranji debut in 2022.Tripurana has 7 First Class games to his name where the batting all-rounder has 150 runs and 16 wickets to his name.In the Mushtaq Ali opener this season, the offie picked 4 for 8 against Nagaland.Tripurana has also played 6 List A and equal number of T20s where he has a combined 54 runs and 13 wickets.Strong performances in Karnataka's Maharaja Trophy helped Manvanth Kumar land a contract with DC at the 2025 auction.The 20-year-old from Mysore got his first exposure in cricket at 12 and since then has flourished in state cricket.In the 2023 and 2024 editions of the Maharaja Trophy, Manvanth picked 22 and 16 wickets respectively for Hubli Tigers and was even the Purple Cap holder before last season.Manvanth hasn't yet been part of Karnataka's state team but has made the right noises in T20 tournaments that helped him get in the radar of DC.Among the uncapped players, DC made an interesting buy in the form of Madhav Tiwari, who has been touted as one of the most promising desi quicks in recent times.At the base price of Rs 30 lakh, Mumbai Indians too along with DC showed a bit of interest for Madhav at the auction, raising the paddle once, before the latter sealed him for Rs 40 lakh.A clean striker with the bat, Madhav has made headlines with his pace bowling across Madhya Pradesh in the past one year.The 21-year-old was born in Gwalior and represents Bhopal Leopards in MP League.Leggie Vipraj Nigam at 20 made his First Class debut for Uttar Pradesh this season in October.Before being picked by DC at the auction, Vipraj had picked up 13 wickets against Bengal, Haryana and Karnataka in the Ranji trophy.He also had a terrific UP T20 League where he was mighty impressive with the ball for Lucknow Falcons.",Delhi Capitals have a near-perfect squad for the upcoming IPL season. The IPL franchise bought star India batsman KL Rahul for Rs 14 crore. DC also picked six fringe players in the IPL mega auction. The franchise went big on local all- rounders.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115705911,imgsize-68392,width-400,resizemode-4/115705911.jpg"

JAIPUR: Rajasthan cricket is alive and kicking. For the first time in the history of Rajasthan cricket, as many as ten players will represent the different franchises in a cash-rich Indian Premier League (IPL).The 2025 season would be the 18th edition of the IPL, organised by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), which will feature ten Rajasthan players, maximum in a single edition so far.The two-day mega auction concluded in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on Monday in which Rajasthan’s talented cricketers were bought by various franchises. Chennai Super Kings management bought three players, while home team Rajasthan Royals and Gujarat Titans will see a couple of Rajasthan players each. Mumbai Indians, Sunrisers Hyderabad and Lucknow Super Giants also snapped a player apiece from the region.The LSG retained Ravi Bishnoi for a whopping Rs 11 crore. The young leg-spinner from Jodhpur has been a consistent performer over the years in the shortest format and would like to extend his excellent show in the upcoming season too.Experienced Deepak Chahar was bought by Mumbai Indians for Rs 9.25 crore. Medium-pacer Deepak had been with CSK earlier. The five-time champions MI went into a bidding war with Punjab Kings and CSK over Deepak.Deepak’s cousin Rahul Chahar was obtained by Sunrisers Hyderabad for Rs 3.20 crore. Leg-spinner Rahul had registered himself at a base price of Rs 1 crore. The 25-year-old has represented three teams in the IPL so far. Rahul helped MI win two IPL titles between 2019 and 2021. He was a regular in the MI playing eleven throughout the three seasons.Aggressive batter Mahipal Lomror was snapped by Gujarat Titans for Rs 1.70 cr. The diminutive southpaw, used as a finisher by RCB in the previous season, has been in red-hot form in the ongoing domestic season. Lomror, whose base price was Rs 50 lakh, is handy with the ball who smartly varies his pace and trajectory.Rajasthan Ranji Trophy captain Deepak Hooda was acquired by CSK for Rs 1.7 crore. This strategic signing is expected to bolster CSK’s middle-order batting and provide a valuable off-spin bowling option, enhancing their chances for another title run in 2025.Left-arm pacer Khaleel Ahmed’s move to the CSK marks a significant chapter in his cricketing career for a price of Rs 4.8 crores. The 26-year-old, known for his agility and wicket-taking ability, has been a steady performer since his IPL debut in 2018.Khaleel can share the new ball with his state-mate Kamlesh Nagarkoti next season for CSK. The Rajasthan pacer could not play any game in 2023 due to a back injury and was released after the season. In the 2024 auction, he went unsold.Another speedster Ashok Sharma will don the Rajasthan Royals colours. The 22-year-old has been a part of the RR camp in the past where he has been a net bowler and earned praise from a lot of players from the squad. Ashok played for KKR in 2022.Wicketkeeper-batsman Kunal Singh Rathore was again bought by RR at his base price of Rs 30 lakh.Leg-spinner Himanshu Sharma of Sikar, who played in the last three years, was unsold this season, while in-form Abhijeet Tomar was unlucky to get a chance in any of the ten teams.The Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA) official confirmed that this is the best auction for the region and will give further boost to the sport.“It is a record for Rajasthan cricket that in all ten players will compete in the next IPL. It just goes to show that there are a lot of talented cricketers in the state. The number could have been bigger had some of the upcoming players like Kartik Sharma, Arafat Khan and a couple of others also got picked during the mega auction,” said the RCA official.","Rishabh Pant becomes most expensive IPL player after he goes to LSG for Rs 27 crore at IPL auction.
