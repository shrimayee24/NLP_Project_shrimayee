When I was young, my aunt often took me to the discourses of Krubananda Variyaar. I remember sitting in crowded halls, listening to him unwrap profound truths with humour.In one, he told the story of a saint who lived on food grown in his garden, cooked his own meals and wanted for nothing. The king, his disciple, kept inviting him to the palace. One day, the saint agreed. A lavish dinner was served, and finally, payasam arrived in a golden cup studded with diamonds.The next day, the palace found the cup missing. The minister went to the saint’s ashram to ask about it, but before he could speak, the saint confessed. “I was going to return it today,” he said. “I kept wondering how such a desire entered my mind. Perhaps when I ate palace food, the thoughts and desires of everyone there seeped into me. Desire made me steal.” Variyaar Swami paused and concluded, “You are what you eat.”Only years later did I fully understand it.Our gut is home to trillions of microorganisms that form a richness as biodiverse as the Amazon rainforest. Good bacteria digest food, produce hormones, control blood sugar and influence our moods. A doctor once told me that 90% of cells are bacterial; only 10% are human. In many ways, we are more microbe than man.No wonder the gut is called the second brain.Thiruvalluvar’s chapter on ‘Medicine’ throws us into a sea of surprise. It does not speak of any branch of practices or procedures. Six out of 10 couplets in this chapter talk about gut health and the need for moderation in eating . Among them,Izhivarindhu UnbaanKann InbanPol NirkkumKazhiperu IrayaanKann Noai.As pleasure dwells with a moderate eater,So is disease with a voracious glutton.He was perhaps aware that gut health is the key to all health.Ilya Mechnikov, the Russian scientist of the early 1900s, accidentally opened the world’s eyes to gut microbes. To prove the body houses vast bacterial populations, he drank a broth of bacteria. He remained fine; his student too. But a third colleague nearly died. That was when Mechnikov realised each person carries a unique microbial world. What nourishes one may endanger another. Balance is the key.Mechnikov would have turned in his grave had he known about the invention of antibiotics. He would have been distressed to see antibiotics destroying good bacteria along with the harmful ones.Indian medical systems, interestingly, did not see microbes as enemies or as causes of illness. They focused on balancing vand. Here again, balance is the key.Modern research now says the gut operates almost independently. The digestive tract contains more than 100 million neurons. Serotonin, our natural antidepressant, is mainly produced in the gut. And that is why we sayOur emotional signals often start in the gut long before they reach the mind.When this delicate system is disrupted through overeating, irregular meals, or processed foods, the results are immediate. Public health experts call obesity the silent second pandemic. Late-night biryani shops, round-the-clock food delivery, and eating at all hours have become routine. And through it all, our gut silently loses its balance.Thiruvalluvar’s rule remains the best remedy: eat what you can digest, and what truly agrees with your system.Science affirms it.Experience repeats it.And our own gut whispers it, quietly, persistently reminding us that well-being beginswith what we choose to place inside.","The Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.

Shettar warns Karnataka’s finances are critical

Balakrishna backs DKS

Yathindra Siddaramaiah backs his father

Kharge says decision will follow consultations

Leadership decision likely only in January

Congress high command’s decision on Karnataka leadership change is likely only after January.

The delay can be linked to CM Siddaramaiah’s personal goal of staying in office until 6 January 2026.

Remaining in office till that date would allow Siddaramaiah to match D Devaraj Urs’ record as Karnataka’s longest-serving CM.

Siddaramaiah sees completing a full five-year term as part of his political legacy and believes this is his last term.

Analysts say Siddaramaiah’s Ahinda base and political journey mirror that of Urs, who championed backward-class empowerment.

Both leaders draw strength from the same Ahinda social coalition and have a history of rivalry despite jointly winning the 2023 election.

BENGALURU: The tussle for Karnataka’s chief ministerial post has intensified, with camps supporting chief minister Siddaramaiah and his deputy DK Shivakumar (DKS) stepping up pressure. Both leaders insist the final decision rests with the Congress high command, even as political signalling intensifies on the ground.Amid political drama both leaders were seen together on stage in an event on Friday.A day earlier, Siddaramaiah asserted that he would complete his full five-year term as CM, while Shivakumar publicly dismissed all speculation of a leadership change, saying he is “not in a hurry” and has had no discussions with senior Congress leaders on the CM post.During his visit to Mumbai, DKS clarified that he met no national leaders.“I came only for a family function. There was no meeting. If a meeting has to happen, it will be in Bengaluru or Delhi,” he said.Speculation around a mid-term power shift continues to be fueled by the 2023 'power-sharing arrangement', frequently referenced in political circles.Spiritual leader Dr Nanjavadhutha Mahaswamiji, pontiff of the Sri Guru Gundla Brahmeshwara Mahasamsthana, said, ""We had expected Siddaramaiah to become the CM in the first term. Considering his age, we thought he would be given the opportunity. The high command had promised to make him CM for at least 2.5 years. All sections of society are supporting Shivakumar. Let's first resolve the issue there and give Shivakumar an opportunity""Karnataka BJP President BY Vijayendra took a dig at Congress, saying it would not be surprising if Karnataka Congress splits into two factions.While Vijayendra stated that the BJP has nothing to do with the ""internal bickering"" within the ruling Congress, he added, the state administration is being affected.Former CM and BJP leader Jagdish Shettar says Karnataka's financial situation is already critical and the ongoing power tussle over the CM post is going to affect it adversely.AICC president Mallikarjun Kharge’s son, Priyank Kharge, met Shivakumar at his Bengaluru residence on Friday morning, adding curiosity to the already charged atmosphere. Priyank maintained that the high command will intervene only when necessary, and urged an end to needless speculation.“Congress was, is, and will remain united. We walk the talk,” he said.Several Vokkaliga community organisations have come out openly in support of Shivakumar, with plans to write to the Congress leadership urging that he be made the CM.MLA HC Balakrishna threw his weight behind DKS, stating that the high command must step in and take a decision soon. He expressed hope that Shivakumar would eventually take oath as Chief Minister.Congress MLC and Siddaramaiah’s son, Yathindra, reiterated his support for the current CM, saying he is unaware of any power-sharing pact between his father and DKS.Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge clarified that a leadership decision will be made after consultations involving central leaders, Siddaramaiah, and Shivakumar.

"Siddaramaiah vs Shivakumar in Karnataka: Did Congress high command fail to act on time, yet again?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/siddaramaiah-vs-shivakumar-in-karnataka-did-congress-high-command-fail-to-act-on-time-yet-again/articleshow/125639420.cms,"'All 140 MLAs Are Mine': DK Shivakumar Amid Karnataka CM Speculation; Siddaramaiah Responds

NEW DELHI: The Congress would have a strong feeling of deja vu about the turn of events in Karnataka. The grand-old-party stares at a political crisis in the state that threatens the very stability of its government. Ironically, while the crisis is in Karnataka, on test is the Congress high command - which has proved to be a bad crisis manager in recent times.The open power tussle between chief minister Siddaramaiah and deputy chief minister D K Shivakumar has reached a point of no return, forcing the top leadership into a huddle. Ironically, the seeds of the current crisis were sown two-and-a-half years back - when both the regional stalwarts had staked claim to the CM post - following the party's emphatic victory over the BJP in the 2023 assembly elections. So the big question is: Has the top Congress leadership failed to act in time, yet again?We have seen similar leadership tussles play out in two states - Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan - where the factionalism between state Congress leaders played a key role in the party eventually losing power. The common thread in all three states has been the Congress leadership's reluctance to act decisively in the fight between the party's old guard and the younger leaders.In Madhya Pradesh, when Jyotiraditya Scindia wanted to step into the leadership role, Congress backed veteran heavyweights Kamal Nath and Digvijaya Singh . This eventually saw the Scindia Junior quitting the party and joining the BJP. Scindia's revolt brought down the Congress government and in the next assembly elections, Kamal Nath and Digivijay Singh failed miserably to counter the BJP.Today, the Congress in Madhya Pradesh is in doldrums while Scindia is a Union minister.In Rajasthan, when Sachin Pilot, who as state president had led the Congress to emphatic victory in 2018, sought the chief minister's chair, the party again backed state veteran Ashok Gehlot. Gehlot, who had led the party to defeat in 2013, became the chief minister again and Sachin Pilot and his supporters were left disappointed. When Sachin stepped up his campaign for the top job, Gehlot used his full might to crush the rebellion. Pilot, who camped at a resort with his supporters, was eventually convinced by the Gandhi family to stay with the party. While the party high command bet big on Gehlot, he could not win the state in 2024.Now, we see a similar script play out in Karnataka. Siddramaiah, who was made the chief minister in 2013, led the party to defeat in 2018. DK Shivakumar, as the state Congress president, played a key role in the party's victory in 2023. But once again, senior leader Siddaramaiah staked claim to the top post and the party eventually went with him. DKS then remained defiant for almost a week before eventually relenting. DKS now claims that there was a secret deal in the know of five-six people about rotating the post of chief minister and wants the Congress high command to ensure that he gets his due. But the Congress high command, as usual, allowed the crisis to blow out of hand. And now, when the factionalism is out in the open, it is trying to broker a truce.The last-minute crisis management may save the Congress government in Karnataka for now, but the open power tussle has the potential to damage the party's image and perhaps also its electoral prospects. The Congress had managed a historic victory against the BJP in 2023. Instead of consolidating its gains, the party finds itself managing the power play between its state leadership. But then, this is how the Congress high command has worked in recent years. The Congress high command needed to anticipate this crisis in Karnataka and should have worked to find a balance between Siddaramaiah, who is past his prime, and DKS - who is the strongest contender to lead the party forward. Perhaps the Congress leadership needs to be reminded about an old adage: A stitch in time saves nine.It will be interesting to see how the Congress high command wriggles out of this crisis and how much this impacts the party's prospects in the 2028 assembly elections. Is the grand old party on the verge of losing yet another state?",The open power tussle between chief minister Siddaramaiah and deputy chief minister D K Shivakumar has reached a point of no return. We have seen similar leadership tussles play out in two states - Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. The common thread in all three states has been the Congress leadership's reluctance to act decisively in the fight between the party's old guard and the younger leaders.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125641385,imgsize-970835,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

Bo Bichette’s injuries spark big concern as MLB analysts explain Blue Jays’ slow approach

Bo Bichette is in the news again as MLB analysts wonder why the Toronto Blue Jays have still not re-signed him. The questions grew louder this week when the team signed starting pitcher Dylan Cease to a seven-year, two hundred and ten million dollar deal. Many fans thought the team would sign Bo Bichette first because he is one of their top players. Instead, the Blue Jays chose to move fast with Dylan Cease, and that raised doubts.On Thursday, Jeff O’Neill, Bryan Hayes and Dave Feschuk spoke about this on TSN’s “Overdrive” show from Toronto. They said the delay with Bo Bichette may show that the team has concerns. They also said there could be “red flags” that the Blue Jays are thinking about before offering a long contract.Bryan Hayes said the Toronto Blue Jays may still be trying to understand Bo Bichette’s true market value.He explained that the team did not need to study Dylan Cease’s price because many teams were already ready to offer him big money.But with Bo Bichette, he said the team may be unsure about the right number. He added that Bo Bichette may also believe he should get top pay, but that does not always match what a team wants to spend.Dave Feschuk then spoke about Bo Bichette’s injury issues. He said these injuries cannot be ignored.He explained that Bo Bichette was not healthy for most of the playoffs last year. He also said that the shortstop missed a large part of the 2024 season when the Blue Jays finished last in the American League East.Dave Feschuk said these things matter because teams think carefully before giving a long contract that covers many years.Bo Bichette missed eighty-one games in the 2024 season. His injuries included right knee tendonitis, a right quad strain and a right calf strain.He missed the final month of the regular season while he was leading MLB in hits. He returned only for the World Series.Dave Feschuk also said teams may be more careful with money because the next Collective Bargaining Agreement talks will happen after the 2026 season.He said some teams believe a salary cap could arrive, so they do not want to spend too much before the rules change.Bo Bichette has been a career point two nine four hitter with one hundred eleven home runs and four hundred thirty-seven RBIs.His hitting numbers remain strong, but teams must decide how his injuries will affect his future deals.Also Read: San Francisco Giants Jump Ahead Of $8.2B New York Yankees In Rising Race For Tatsuya Imai","The Toronto Blue Jays signed starting pitcher Dylan Cease to a seven-year, two hundred and ten million dollar deal.

Investigation Continues as NBA Eyes Remain on Hart

became the latest high-profile athlete toafter $185,000 worth of luxury watches and jewelry vanished from his room at The Dominick Hotel in Manhattan’s SoHo district. The robbery unfolded on September 5, 2025, turning what should have been a routine offseason stay into a headline-making ordeal. Hart had dropped off his duffle bag containing a prized watch case around 12:30 p.m., only to return an hour later and find it missing.The incident has since stirred widespread conversation, not only because of the staggering value of the stolen items but also due to the brazenness of the midday heist at a high-end hotel known for celebrity clientele and tight security. As the story circulated, speculation mounted regarding how such a theft could occur inside a property that prides itself on exclusivity and safety.Investigators confirmed that Josh Hart’s bag contained three luxury watches and a bracelet, although the specific brands - whether Rolex, Audemars Piguet, or otherwise - have not been revealed. What is clear is that the case disappeared from his room in broad daylight shortly after Hart checked in.The Knicks guard had recently signed an $81 million contract and was staying downtown despite maintaining a residence in Westchester, as he was set to attend an event in New York City on September 6.With no arrests or suspects named as of late November, police have not yet determined whether the theft was the work of hotel staff, other guests, or a calculated crew familiar with the area. The lack of leads has only intensified public curiosity about the circumstances surrounding the crime.Josh Hart isn’t merely a role player; he’s become one of New York’s most dependable contributors. Last season, he broke the franchise record for single-season triple-doubles, and under new head coach Mike Brown he has continued averaging 10.4 points and 7.1 rebounds. Off the court, Hart is known for his passion for high-end fashion and watches, an interest shared by many NBA stars. Similar thefts involving Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Karl-Anthony Towns have only fueled debates about whether professional athletes should travel with expensive jewelry.Hart also remains a beloved Villanova alum, part of the 2016 NCAA championship team with Jalen Brunson and Mikal Bridges - now his Knicks teammates - adding even more public attention to his situation.Also read: Oklahoma junior college basketball player, Ethan Dietz, tragically passes away after suffering fatal in-game injury The NYPD continues to investigate but has yet to uncover meaningful leads. The case mirrors a growing pattern of athlete-targeted thefts, with even celebrities like Keanu Reeves having watches recovered through federal investigations. For Hart, the loss is significant, but those familiar with his relentless playing style expect him to bounce back quickly as the Knicks chase NBA Cup success against the Bucks. Whether the stolen pieces ever reappear, however, remains an open question as the case moves forward.","New York Knicks guard Josh Hart was robbed of $185,000 worth of luxury watches and jewelry at a Manhattan hotel.

Los Angeles Lakers Injury Report vs the Dallas Mavericks (November 28, 2025)

Thecollide on November 28, 2025, at Crypto.com Arena in a must-watch NBA Cup regular-season contest shaped heavily by injuries, blockbuster trade history, and marquee returns. The matchup arrives with added anticipation as both squads navigate shifting lineups and rely on high-profile stars to carry the load.With Anthony Davis preparing for a potential comeback against his former team and key Lakers battling nagging issues, the evening promises emotional undertones and tactical adjustments. The Mavericks look to regain momentum with several players on the mend, while the Lakers seek to extend their dominant form amid a crowded Western Conference race.Dallas Mavericks enter the contest banged up but energized by the expected return of Anthony Davis, who has missed 14 straight games since suffering a left calf strain on October 29. Before going down, Davis averaged 20.8 points, 10.2 rebounds, and 2.2 assists across five appearances—numbers the Mavericks hope to inject back into their frontcourt. However, the rest of the roster remains thin. Kyrie Irving continues to sit out due to left knee injury management, Dante Exum remains unavailable with his own right knee concerns, and Dereck Lively II will miss his third consecutive game with a right foot sprain.These absences have placed an increased burden on Daniel Gafford and Moussa Cisse, who are expected to log heavy minutes inside. Rookie Cooper Flagg, who has been managing a right thumb splint, has been cleared to play and will take on the challenge of facing Luka Dončić. Flagg has been impressive so far with averages of 15.9 points, 6.4 rebounds, and 3.1 assists in 18 games, making him a crucial part of Dallas’ depth tonight.The Lakers enter at 13-4 with five straight wins and only two names on the injury list. Deandre Ayton is considered probable after a right knee contusion forced him out of action earlier in the week. Despite the setback, he has been highly efficient, averaging 15.5 points and 8.4 rebounds on 69.6 percent shooting. Marcus Smart, meanwhile, is questionable with back spasms after providing a gritty bench performance in his last outing. His potential absence could test the Lakers’ defensive stability.The rest of the roster remains fully available, including star trio Luka Dončić (35.2 PPG), Austin Reaves (27.9 PPG), and LeBron James, giving Los Angeles a strong foundation as they attempt to maintain their standing in the West.","Dallas Mavericks host Los Angeles Lakers on November 28, 2025, at Crypto.com Arena.

Marcel Reed injury update: Texas A&M quarterback exits first quarter against Texas with apparent ankle injury,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/marcel-reed-injury-update-texas-am-quarterback-exits-first-quarter-against-texas-with-apparent-ankle-injury/articleshow/125649977.cms,"(Image Source - Getty Images)

Marcel Reed Injury Update : Reed back in offensive huddle with coaches at the end of first quarter

What really stood out, alongside the injury, was Reed's response to the moment. Following the twist during that designed scramble, he was down on the turf in clear discomfort, but then he did something that highlights his toughness and the culture at Texas A&M. He walked off on his own, went through the medical evaluations, tested his mobility on a stationary bike, and before long, he was back in the offensive huddle talking to Collin Klein like it was no big deal. That whole situation says two important things about Marcel Reed.First off, he’s got physical toughness and faith in the medical team. Secondly, he’s earned enough respect to come back without throwing the locker room off balance. Those aren’t minor points when you’re leading an offense that’s racked up over 3,000 yards and 30 touchdowns this season. I’m pretty clear on this: Reed’s comeback isn’t just a good sign medically, it’s a mental lift for the Aggies. However, it’s important to mix admiration with caution. Let the medical evaluations determine the timeline. For now, fans and teammates can find comfort in Reed’s determination, but the wise approach is to stay cautiously optimistic instead of going all out in celebration.As the first quarter came to an end, a wave of optimism began to emerge in the updates. The Texas A&M football radio broadcast, transmitted via the Aggie Network, delivered the initial concrete reassurance, ""Reed was back in the offensive huddle and receiving instruction from the coaches at the end of the first quarter,"" as per Gig'Em Gazette's live updates. This info was shared straight from play-by-play announcer Dave South and color analyst Steve Cunningham, who highlighted Reed's noticeable interaction with offensive coordinator Collin Klein.The chatter on social media boosted the optimistic vibe. Benchwarmer Sports shared on X, ""It looks like Marcel Reed is warming up and shaking off the ankle injury. Good news for Texas A&M and anyone who has an A&M bet on 🙏🏻,"" sharing video of Reed stretching on the sideline. HornSports, a Texas-focused outlet, confirmed: ""Texas A&M QB Marcel Reed is back on the field after suffering an injury in the first quarter.""By the second quarter, Reed's return was official. The Athletic's live blog timestamped it at 11:59 remaining: ""Reed returns to the field after missing one offensive snap."" He wasted no time, completing a 12-yard pass to move the chains and later scrambling for 13 yards into Texas territory, appearing ""fine"" per reporter Sam Khan Jr. On3's live updates echoed this, noting Reed's scramble drew a 15-yard pass interference penalty, pushing the Aggies into the red zone.As of late November 28, there hasn't been an official diagnosis yet, but sources are calling it a ""rolled ankle"" or a mild sprain, steering clear of the knee worries that some early X posts suggested. Matt Young, a staff writer for the Houston Chronicle, reported on Reed. ""did not go to the locker room and was observed riding a stationary bike on the sidelines,"" indicating that there’s no structural damage.Texas A&M head coach Mike Elko hasn’t said anything publicly so far, but we should hear more about Reed’s long-term situation during the post-game availability as they gear up for possible SEC title preparations.Also Read: Cowboys vs. Chiefs: Dallas exposes critical problems that could impact Kansas City’s playoff run","Texas A&M quarterback Marcel Reed suffered an ankle injury in the first quarter.

Xavier Isaac details the surgery that changed his season



Rays prospect Xavier Isaac prepares for his return



Tampa Bay Rays prospect Xavier Isaac opened up about a private battle that few around him knew was unfolding, revealing that a frightening mid-summer health scare led to emergency brain surgery that saved his life.The first baseman shared the story in a Thanksgiving Instagram post, pairing the message with a photo from his hospital stay. His update gave fans and the baseball world clarity on why his season ended abruptly in June and showed how close he came to losing far more than playing time.Isaac explained that what he believed was routine dehydration led doctors to run a brain scan, triggering the start of a medical crisis that forced the 21-year-old off the field. Months later, he said he has fully recovered and is preparing to return to baseball with a sense of gratitude and purpose.Xavier Isaac told fans that July 3 “is a day that changed everything,” describing a health emergency that unfolded far from the public eye. His symptoms pushed him to get checked, and the scan “turned into life saving and season ending surgery.”He kept the diagnosis quiet at the time and asked the Rays not to release details as he recovered.His final game with Double-A Montgomery came on June 25, and many believed an elbow issue from spring had resurfaced.In his message, Isaac called the ordeal “the scariest moment of my life,” adding, “But by the grace of God, I have walked through this valley and he has seen me through it. I’m blessed to say I’ve fully recovered.”He also thanked those who supported him through the crisis, “Thank you Lord for giving me strength when I had none… thank you to my family, friends and the team around me for acting quickly and holding me up every single day.”He closed with appreciation for the medical staff at Duke University Medical, writing, “you didn’t just treat me, you gave me a second chance.”Isaac’s announcement drew immediate support from teammates, fellow prospects and players across the league. The 2022 first-round pick and Tampa Bay’s No. 5 prospect recently joined a hitting camp and is expected to be at full strength for spring training.Before his season ended, he appeared in 41 games for Montgomery, hitting nine home runs while working through early-season injuries.The first baseman ended his post with a message, “Now I’m stepping back on the field with a new purpose, a new fire, and a heart full of gratitude… This comeback isn’t just about baseball — it’s about life. Every day. Every breath. Every swing.” He signed off with three words that signal a new chapter: “X is Back.”Isaac is fit now, and fans can see the Rays prospect in action soon.Also Read: Bo Bichette contract talks hit another pause after analysts explain major risks facing the Toronto Blue Jays",Tampa Bay Rays prospect Xavier Isaac opened up about a health scare that ended his season in June.

Why the Phillies Would Accept

On-Field Fit and Lineup Impact

Pros, Cons, and Overall Verdict

A blockbuster trade built aroundand thewould instantly become one of the most fascinating storylines of the winter. While not an active or imminent negotiation, the concept makes enough baseball sense that it continues to surface in league speculation. The idea centers on Toronto gaining the middle-order thunder they’ve lacked, while Philadelphia reallocates resources from an aging slugger to a younger, more controllable core.The financial mechanics are a major part of the intrigue. Schwarber is expected to land a contract in the $35-40 million AAV range over four seasons, a level that reflects his near-MVP offensive output and long résumé of postseason impact. Any team acquiring him must weigh both the production and the significant financial weight attached.A clean version of this hypothetical deal sends Schwarber to Toronto - potentially with a bit of cash relief - while Philadelphia receives a versatile, inexpensive bat such as Davis Schneider plus one MLB-ready arm or upper-minors pitching prospect. The Phillies could choose to absorb a slice of Schwarber’s contract to upgrade the talent level coming back, a familiar tactic in trades involving star hitters on nine-figure deals.Toronto’s current roster leans heavily on Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Anthony Santander for power, with no true left-handed, full-time DH threat. Schwarber solves that instantly. He would slot into the No. 2 or No. 4 spot, surrounding Guerrero with on-base ability and elite home-run production. With seasons of 38 homers in 2024 and a massive 56-homer, 132-RBI campaign in 2025, he becomes their most dangerous slugger since the Bautista-Encarnación era. Toronto also gains a hitter built for October, as Schwarber owns double-digit postseason home runs and deep-run experience with multiple organizations.For Philadelphia, the logic is financial efficiency and roster balance. Committing four years of near-MVP money to a slugger in his mid-30s is risky, especially with existing large contracts on the books. Trading Schwarber gives them payroll room to strengthen pitching and defense while adding long-term value in the form of Schneider and a young arm. The Phillies also have some redundancy in corner power bats and have shown interest in distributing DH at-bats more broadly.Schwarber becomes Toronto’s primary DH, with occasional starts in left field. This reshapes the top six: George Springer, Schwarber, Guerrero Jr., Santander, Daulton Varsho, and Andres Gimenez - a group that forces opposing managers into difficult bullpen decisions due to alternating handedness and multiple 30-plus-homer threats.Toronto gains a game-changing middle-order hammer, improved lineup balance, and proven playoff power. The risks involve Schwarber’s defensive limitations, strikeout rate, and the aging curve tied to a large multiyear contract. Philadelphia, meanwhile, gains payroll flexibility, youth, and positional versatility but loses a fan-favorite slugger and must replace 40–50 homers in the near term.Also read: MLB trade rumors: New York Mets could acquire $15 million San Diego Padres Starter after Dylan Cease deal In the short run, Toronto likely wins the on-field upgrade.

Francisco Lindor–Jeff McNeil confrontation reignites concerns inside Mets clubhouse

Jeff McNeil’s contract status puts added pressure on the Mets’ offseason



Francisco Lindor’s name is back in the middle of clubhouse drama, and this time the tension carries more weight than the bizarre “rat or raccoon” argument that once defined his relationship with Jeff McNeil.As the New York Mets dissect a disastrous 2025 campaign, a new report detailing a heated exchange between Lindor and McNeil has pulled old frustrations back into the spotlight. It also adds fresh urgency to the Mets’ looming decision on McNeil’s future as he enters the final guaranteed year of his contract.The confrontation reportedly erupted after a defensive lapse on June 20 during a brutal stretch in which the Mets dropped their seventh straight game. While the exchange never became physical, sources described it as a tense standoff.According to the New York Post, “Francisco Lindor and Jeff McNeil had a heated confrontation last season, just the latest friction between the teammates in what has been a turbulent Mets relationship.” A source added, “A play didn’t get made and that pissed [Lindor] off,” underscoring how quickly frustration boiled over during the club’s midsummer slide.This marks the most notable flare-up between the two since 2021, when a defensive breakdown escalated into a physical altercation in the tunnel. That infamous moment became a national talking point after the duo brushed it off with a story about arguing over whether an animal was a rat or a raccoon.As tension resurfaced, McNeil’s future became even more uncertain. He is entering the final year of his deal at roughly $17.75 million, with a club option waiting beyond that. For a front office eager to reset, he represents both a financial pivot point and a potential chemistry reset.While tension surrounded him off the field, Lindor continued to deliver on it, finishing 2025 with 31 home runs, 31 steals, elite defense, and a top-10 MVP finish. His presence remains one of the few stable pillars as the Mets try to rebound in 2026.Away from baseball, Lindor’s profile grew thanks to a GQ feature highlighting his collaboration with Audemars Piguet. “There’s a lot of history in there,” he said, reflecting on the Royal Oak Offshore’s legacy.Also Read: Rays prospect Xavier Isaac shares life-saving Thanksgiving admission along with a summer photo from hospital","Francisco Lindor and Jeff McNeil reportedly had a heated confrontation last season.

'Get Off Your Phone': Travis Kelce’s Past With Kayla Nicole Resurfaces Amid Taylor Swift Lyric Storm

Kayla Nicole explains ‘over-sexualized comments’ on the On Tap with Harry Jowsey podcast





Kayla Nicole is back in the spotlight, and fans of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are not happy at all. Kayla, who dated Travis Kelce until 2022, spoke on the “On Tap with Harry Jowsey” podcast and made a comment that upset many people. She said she does not want to date any more athletes, but then she added that she would date team owners. The internet quickly jumped on this line, and many fans said she is “never beating those gold digger allegations.” This one comment spread fast and started a huge fight online.Right after the podcast clip came out, fans on X began reacting. Some Swift fans said Kayla Nicole was again throwing “small shots” at Travis Kelce. Others said her comment sounded rude toward all athletes. A few people joked that Kayla has only dated one athlete, so saying she will never date one again did not make much sense. That made people laugh even more and turned the whole thing into a trending moment.Another fan dragged Taylor Swift’s ex-boyfriend Joe Alwyn into the talk. They joked that Joe also loved Taylor’s lifestyle and “connections.” Many people online wrote that Kayla Nicole should stop bringing up anything that looks like a jab at Travis Kelce.One person said, “I don’t see anyone lining up.” Another fan said they will always defend Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce “any day” from Kayla’s comments. Someone else joked that Kayla is entering her “villain arc. ”Some fans also reminded others that Travis Kelce did not cheat on Kayla with Taylor Swift. They said the breakup happened long before Taylor came into the picture, so these new comments feel unnecessary. People even mentioned her Halloween video where she used a Toni Braxton song, saying she should just “move on.”During the same talk with Harry Jowsey, Kayla Nicole also opened up about people calling her “too sexual.” She said this happens even when she wears simple clothes like a swimsuit. She explained that she is not trying to make “thirst trap” photos. She said she is simply at the beach or pool, and people turn it into something else.Kayla Nicole said she has dealt with this problem for “years and years.” She told Harry that she cannot control how others see her and that it is “not my fault” if people feel attracted to her. Her comments kept the online talk going, and fans continued reacting long after the podcast clip went viral.Also Read: “Tayvis Thanksgiving Is Like”: Perez Hilton Reacts As Taylor Swift And Travis Kelce’s Viral Steakhouse Photo With Chiefs Fans Sparks New Buzz","Kayla Nicole spoke on the “On Tap with Harry Jowsey” podcast and made a comment that upset many people.

Pros, Cons, and Overall Winner

Talk around the league has escalated as theare increasingly positioned as a potential landing spot for Milwaukee Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo . With the franchise eyeing a future built around Luka Dončić , the possibility of pairing him with another generational MVP has created a wave of speculation across NBA circles.This momentum is driven by recent indications that the Lakers are exploring aggressive paths to remain contenders beyond the LeBron James era. Reports suggest they are more willing than ever to make short-term sacrifices if it means strengthening their core around Dončić, who continues to perform at an MVP level.Among the most detailed proposals is a five-team structure that envisions the Lakers acquiring Giannis along with Olivier-Maxence Prosper from Dallas and Tyrese Martin from Brooklyn. In this scenario, LeBron James heads to Dallas, Brooklyn gains Dalton Knecht, and Los Angeles sends Milwaukee a haul of wings - RJ Barrett, PJ Washington, Caleb Martin, and Naji Marshall - along with extensive draft control.The Bucks’ return would include swap rights in 2026, 2028, 2030, and 2032, plus a 2031 first-round pick. Meanwhile, the Raptors and Nets secure young pieces and trade exceptions to reshape their flexibility.Alternate proposals maintain the same intention but reduce the complexity. One such idea involves the Lakers sending LeBron, Austin Reaves, and two first-rounders directly to Milwaukee in exchange for Giannis and Kyle Kuzma. These frameworks prioritize Milwaukee’s need for draft capital and young talent rather than retaining an aging LeBron.For the Lakers, landing a 30-year-old superstar in his prime alongside a 26-year-old Dončić offers a pathway to multiple championship runs. Their recent head-to-head battles - highlighted by Dončić’s 41-point performance in a dominant win - underscore the potential of their combined offensive strength.Milwaukee, on the other hand, would gain assets to address the team’s drop-off when Giannis is off the floor. Their pursuit of additional scorers such as Zach LaVine and Anfernee Simons shows a desire to rebalance the roster, and a major trade could accelerate a full-scale retool.Dallas would reload instantly with LeBron’s leadership beside rising talent. Brooklyn and Toronto would walk away with young guards like Knecht and Hardy, plus valuable exceptions.The Lakers benefit from a potential dynasty-forming duo capable of combining for over 65 points per game while boosting the league’s global appeal. The Bucks secure valuable rebuilding tools but risk alienating fans by moving their franchise icon. The complexity of multi-team negotiations and Knicks-related timing issues remain hurdles.Also read: NBA trade rumors: Golden State Warriors could chase $54.2 million Dallas Mavericks superstar in blockbuster 3-team trade to fix center depth If such a scenario were to play out, the Lakers emerge with the clearest long-term upside, while Milwaukee transitions into a new era fueled by assets and flexibility.","The Los Angeles Lakers are increasingly positioned as a potential landing spot for Milwaukee Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo.

Saquon Barkley’s injury update brings positive news ahead of the Eagles’ next matchup

If you're an Eagles fan, you already know the emotional rollercoaster this week has been. One minute, everyone is panicking over Saquon Barkley’s groin issue, and the next, there’s a wave of relief hitting Philly Twitter like a tidal wave.The guy who was supposed to be the offense’s security blanket suddenly had his availability in question and that’s all anyone could talk about. But the dust has finally settled, and yes, we have clarity. Let’s get into why Eagles fans can chill again.Saquon Barkley has been dealing with a groin injury, which immediately sent both reporters and fans into detective mode. He was limited in practice earlier this week, sparking questions about whether the issue was serious or just one of those “rest days” disguised as an injury. The Eagles kept things vague at first, so naturally, the speculation spiraled.That’s why today’s update felt like a collective exhale across Philadelphia. Barkley was officially listed with no injury designation heading into the game, confirming that he is fully expected to play. For a team that has leaned heavily on his dual-threat abilities both in rushing and pass-catching, this is a massive win.Even though this wasn’t labeled a major injury, the timing had everyone slightly stressed.The Eagles’ offense has been trying to find a rhythm, and removing Barkley from the equation would’ve meant reshuffling the backfield, adjusting play calls, and relying more heavily on depth pieces. Not ideal.With Barkley cleared, the team can stick to its usual game plan, use him to soften defenses early, open up play-action opportunities, and provide Jalen Hurts with a reliable check-down option when things get chaotic in the pocket. In short, Barkley’s presence changes the entire flow of the offense.While he’s healthy enough to suit up, the Eagles may still monitor his workload depending on how the game unfolds. A groin tweak can flare up if overworked, so don’t be shocked if the team rotates him strategically or leans on him in bursts instead of heavy usage.Still, expect the usual, hard cuts, explosive acceleration, and at least one play that makes broadcasters raise their voices. If the offense starts hot, Barkley will be a big reason why.Also read - will-jalen-hurts-play-against-the-chicago-bears-today-latest-injury-update-on-the-popular-philadelphia-eagles-quarterback","Saquon Barkley has been dealing with a groin injury, which immediately sent both reporters and fans into detective mode.

Trigger Warning:

Indianapolis Colts breakout star quarterback Daniel Jones wants to win games week after week

More coverage on Daniel Jones:

This story contains references to suicide.On November 26, the Indianapolis Colts’ official X account shone a spotlight on Daniel Jones with two emotional banners. One highlighted the NFL ’s “My Cause, My Cleats” campaign, showcasing Jones’ custom cleats in support of Mission 34. The other shared Jones’ moving tribute to his late friend and teammate, Sean Bonner, and his commitment to breaking the stigma around mental health. The message on the banner read: “In 2018, I lost my good friend and high school teammate Sean Bonner to suicide at the age of 20. Mission 34, founded by Sean’s parents, honors him by raising awareness and support for mental health struggles. Seeking help shows strength, not weakness. I’m proud to support Mission 34 and their efforts to eliminate the stigma surrounding mental illness.” The Colts summed it up with a simple, yet powerful message: “this sunday means more for Daniel Jones 💙.”This Sunday, Indianapolis will face the Houston Texans. Their position is crucial as they lead the AFC South, but their quarterback is battling an injury. On November 27, Ian Rapoport reported on X that Daniel Jones, who has a lower leg injury, suffered a fibula fracture. He was a full participant on Thursday, and one source told the Insider, “He looked good.”Jones will keep trying to play through it. His toughness is never questioned. His grit is undeniable.A team source told ESPN Jones will be a full participant in Thursday’s practice, a step up from his limited status on Wednesday. The quarterback explained to reporters that the injury had been lingering in the background before he finally recognized it last week. The signal caller told reporters Wednesday that the injury was a result of “something that kind of was hanging over, and he realized it last week. Just been trying to get treatment and make sure I’m in the best spot I can be. ” He has been focused on treatment, determined to be in top shape. Unsure of when the injury first struck, he notified the training staff a few days after the Colts returned from their bye week. Jones shrugged off concerns, assuring everyone he feels ready and will be on the gridiron Sunday, just as he was last week. “Tough to say exactly when it happened,” Jones said. “I’m all good. I’ll be ready to go on Sunday. Obviously, I was out there last week. I’m good to go.”Daniel’s determination to play through pain is a testament to his toughness. In a recent CBS Sports interview, he emphasized the non-stop drive to win, week after week. His words resonated with the team’s hunger for victory and their commitment to sharpening their game, confident that their hard work could carry them far. “We’ve got to keep winning games,” Jones said. “We’ve got to keep taking care of business week after week. It’s been a good start to this point…but there’s certainly things we haven’t done as well at times that we need to clean up and be sharper with going forward, so that will be a focus of ours. But yeah, we’re confident. I think we’re confident in our team and our ability to go a long way and to continue to play good football, but we’ve got to win week after week.”","Indianapolis Colts quarterback Daniel Jones is battling a lower leg injury. Jones lost his high school teammate Sean Bonner to suicide at the age of 20. Jones has dedicated his life to breaking the stigma around mental health. Jones was a full participant in Thursday's practice, a step up from Wednesday.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125640965,imgsize-50964,width-400,resizemode-4/nfl-daniel-jones.jpg"

Will DeVonta Smith play against the Chicago Bears in Week 13?

Smith’s return provides much-needed stability for an Eagles offense fighting inconsistency

The Philadelphia Eagles received a critical boost ahead of their must-win Week 13 matchup against the surging Chicago Bears, easing the anxiety that had built throughout the week. Star wide receiver DeVonta Smith briefly became the center of concern after popping up on the injury report with a chest/shoulder issue and an illness, leaving fans uneasy heading into the Black Friday showdown.Smith missed Tuesday and Wednesday’s practices, fueling speculation about his availability. But the tension settled on Thanksgiving when he was listed as a full participant on the team’s estimated report, signaling that he would suit up. With Philadelphia’s offense searching for stability after last week’s dramatic collapse, Smith’s presence arrives at the perfect moment.Smith has been the Eagles’ most dependable wideout this season, leading the team with 55 catches and 754 receiving yards. Beyond the numbers, he stretches the field vertically in a way no other Philadelphia receiver consistently does, forcing defenses to honor deeper zones and creating space underneath for Jalen Hurts and the run game.After scoring zero points in the second half against Dallas despite holding a 21-0 lead, Philadelphia needs every ounce of offensive firepower it can get. Their Week 12 loss was catastrophic as it was the second-largest blown lead in franchise history and the biggest collapse the team has suffered in the 21st century. At 9–2, the Eagles still control their postseason destiny, but momentum has shifted, and internal pressure is mounting.Smith’s return doesn’t fix everything, but it gives the unit its full complement of playmakers at a time when execution matters most. Chicago arrives with confidence after winning four straight and holding a narrow lead in the NFC North. Their defense also gets healthier with cornerbacks Jaylon Johnson and Kyler Gordon activated from injured reserve, adding an intriguing layer to Friday’s matchup.A healthy Smith, facing a reinforced Bears secondary, could play a major role in determining the outcome. For the Eagles, Black Friday isn’t just another game, but it’s a chance to reset their trajectory. And having Smith back on the field may be exactly what keeps their season on course.Also read: Eagles delete DeVonta Smith photo after fans flood comments with dirty NSFW jokes","Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver DeVonta Smith was listed as a full participant on the team’s estimated report.

Perez Hilton defends Meghan Markle in new “Green Gown-gate” talk

Meghan Markle and Prince Harry join Thanksgiving service event





Pop culture podcaster Perez Hilton has reacted to a new rumor about Meghan Markle and a green gown. This rumor started again after the trailer for Meghan Markle’s upcoming Netflix holiday special came out. In the trailer, Meghan is seen wearing a green dress. Soon, many people online began to say that this dress looked like the same $1,695 gown she wore for a Variety 2022 photoshoot. Some people online claimed she took the dress home “without asking.”These new talks grew bigger after Page Six posted a report on November 24. The outlet wrote that one source claimed Meghan “took the emerald green gown from the shoot without permission.” Another source told Page Six that Meghan was “required to archive all her looks” because of royal rules. But Page Six also added that a different source said there was no such royal rule.The rumor became huge on social media, and many people began to argue about Meghan again. So, Perez Hilton decided to speak about it. He wrote about it in his November 26 blog, saying the scandal was now called “Green Gown-gate.” He also spoke about an interview with journalist Vanessa Grigoriadis, who said the Sussexes took “a lot of stuff” after a past photoshoot.Perez Hilton reacted strongly to the dress rumor. He said the whole story sounded silly and wrote:“This sounds like a bunch of nonsense. We really doubt Meghan would steal a dress, and then wear it for her Netflix show!”Perez Hilton also said that many stars take home outfits after shoots and that Meghan Markle likely had an agreement with the designer. He added that this happens “all the time” in Hollywood. Soon after, Meghan Markle’s representative spoke to E! News and denied all the claims. The rep said:“The idea that anything was taken without the full knowledge or agreement of the stylists or their teams is false and highly defamatory. Anything kept was done with transparency and followed all contracts.”Prince Harry and Meghan Markle also made news for a good reason. On November 26, they spent Thanksgiving week helping the group Our Big Kitchen Los Angeles through their charity, the Archewell Foundation. The couple cooked and packed meals with their children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet.In a press release, the Archewell team said they wanted to support people who are struggling with food insecurity during the holiday season.Meghan Markle also shared a warm Thanksgiving note in her As Ever brand newsletter, thanking her family and wishing everyone a happy holiday.

Le'Veon Bell has always moved through his career with a lot of style, so it makes perfect sense that he would find a flashy way to sum up everything he has done on and off the field. The former NFL running back recently put his entire life story into one giant custom chain, transforming the highs, shifts, and new chapters of his journey into a piece of jewelry that instantly captured attention. For fans who have followed him from college to the pros and into his newer ventures, the chain feels like a personal highlight reel made wearable.Bell worked on the piece in Miami with his longtime jeweler, Moe Diamonds, after deciding he wanted something that captured the moments that mattered most to him. Instead of filling the chain with every logo he ever touched, he picked the symbols that shaped his identity. The result reads like a timeline that covers his rise at Michigan State, his peak with the Pittsburgh Steelers and the paths he chose after football.At the center of the chain are the team logos that he felt defined his football life. One is Michigan State University, where he played from 2010 to 2012 and built the foundation for his future. The other is the Pittsburgh Steelers, the team where he became a three-time Pro Bowl running back. Bell also included the Killer B mark, a reminder of the era when he, Antonio Brown and Ben Roethlisberger powered one of the league’s most dangerous offenses.He made sure the piece also reflected what came next. The boxing gloves represent the years he spent competing in the ring, including his exhibition fights and the knockout he delivered against Adrian Peterson. His professional run continued with more bouts, and his most recent win came against Tristan Hamm in 2024.The microphone charm points to his music career, where he performs under the name Juice. Bell has released several projects over the years, including his 2019 album ""Life is a Gamble,"" bringing another layer to the story he wanted the chain to tell.The finished chain weighs more than a quarter kilo and is loaded with 50 carats of diamonds, rubies and emeralds. Bell recorded 6,554 rushing yards and 42 rushing touchdowns in his eight NFL seasons and broke multiple league and Steelers records.","Le'Veon Bell's neckpiece features career milestones from college to boxing.

What Hailey Sikman and Jade Dickens said about Jammie Booker at the Texas event



Jammie Booker, 28, lost her World’s Strongest Woman title after officials said she is a biological male and also after explicit photos spread during the event. This happened at the 2025 contest in Arlington, Texas, last weekend. On Tuesday, the Official Strongman Games said they removed her win because they only allow people to compete in the category of the sex marked at birth. This pushed Andrea Thompson , 43, from Great Britain, into first place.Rivals told the Daily Mail and Fox News Digital that they only learned about Booker’s gender after the event. They said the photos and videos were sent to them later. One photo showed Booker grabbing her chest and sticking out her tongue. The Daily Mail also said competitors shared adult pictures and videos that seemed to show Booker had worked in porn. Because of this, the event became a huge controversy.Strongwomen Hailey Sikman and Jade Dickens said they felt “conned” because they did not know anything about Jammie Booker’s gender before the contest ended. Jade Dickens told Fox News Digital that she was “beyond mad.” She said, “Nobody knew he was a man.”She also said Booker was quiet, and she believed Booker’s voice might have revealed the truth.Hailey Sikman said she tried to talk to Booker during the event, but Booker did not respond. Sikman said many women felt Booker was “arrogant” and “talking s***.” They believed she kept a distance from other athletes.On Tuesday, the Official Strongman Games shared a strong statement. They said, “It appears that an athlete who is biologically male and who now identifies as female competed in the Women’s Open category.” They also said they tried to contact Booker but did not get a reply.The Daily Mail looked into claims that Booker worked in adult entertainment. Their report said Booker looks like a porn performer named Jammie Jay, and Booker also uses the TikTok name @jammiejaysvids. The IAFD (Internet Adult Film Database) shows that “Jammie Jay” was nominated at the Trans Erotica Awards in 2020 and 2022. The site also lists several adult movie titles under that name.The Daily Mail reached out to Booker and her coach but got no response. They also contacted the Official Strongman Games to ask if these photos and videos were part of the decision to remove the title.In a 2017 YouTube video, Jammie Booker said she was a “21-year-old trans woman” with a hard past and strict parents. In a July podcast with champion strongwoman Erin Murray, Booker talked about having three partners and said she uses Google Calendar to plan time with each one.She said she trains early in the morning and keeps her schedule tight so she can balance work, partners, and strongwoman training.Also Read: Why Did A Biological Male Win The World’s Strongest Woman?

How will Marcus Foligno’s injury affect Minnesota’s Wild lineup?

Marcus Foligno (#17) All 23 Goals of the 2021-22 NHL Season

The veteran winger Marcus Foligno has been placed on injured reserve by the Minnesota Wild effective November 26, after he picked up a lower-body injury in the course of the game against the Chicago Blackhawks, which went into overtime on Wednesday night. Foligno was involved in a collision with Oliver Moore and had to leave the match late in the second period, and the Wild has since called up Nicolas Aubé-Kubel from their AHL affiliate in Iowa to take his place on the roster. Minnesota is currently without five forwards, including Ryan Hartman, Vinnie Hinostroza, Marco Rossi, and Vladimir Tarasenko, while they have approximately $3.43 million in cap space.Foligno will be out for the next three games at least and can only return as early as December 4 against the Calgary Flames. This winger, who is 34 years old, has not been very productive offensively in recent times, getting only two assists in 23 games, and his average ice time of 13:07 is the lowest in the last seven years. Nevertheless, he still plays a vital defensive role, and numbers like expected goals against per 60 minutes (2.63) and scoring chances against per 60 (28.29) show that he is worth having in his own zone.The Wild have to deal with the problem of performing up to standard while the crucial forwards are out of the lineup.The head coach, John Hynes, has not given any specific time frame for Marcus Foligno’s full recovery, so Minnesota has to cope with using its depth players, together with recalled Aubé-Kubel, to keep its lineup alive.Foligno's IR placement is very timely as the team is poised to extend its winning streak to six and fortify its Central Division position. The Wild will have to make extensive ice time adjustments, change line combinations, and rethink deployment strategies to remain competitive during his absence.Foligno's injury puts additional strain on the Minnesota forwards; however, good roster management and the help from the fit players are going to be the key factors in getting through the upcoming fixtures.Also Read: NHL Updates: Montreal Canadiens re-sign defenseman Mike Matheson to a long-term extension","Marcus Foligno has been placed on injured reserve by the Minnesota Wild.

Tip-off is set for 7:30 PM ET, and for the first time in a while, Charlotte’s star point guard walks into a matchup without an injury tag shadowing him. His clean bill of health is reassuring for a fanbase that has watched him battle ankle concerns all season.Charlotte is desperate for stability, especially with their record slipping further below .500. Having Ball at the helm offers something this team has lacked in recent weeks: direction. And considering the Bulls are arriving with a battered roster and numerous rotational uncertainties, the Hornets know this is a prime opportunity to regain momentum. With Black Friday bringing a national spotlight to the tournament slate, the timing couldn’t be better.LaMelo Ball enters tonight’s contest after logging 27 minutes in Wednesday’s outing against the Knicks, where he posted 11 points, six rebounds, and four assists. Despite a rough 4-for-14 shooting night, his presence alone boosted Charlotte’s tempo and spacing. Even as whispers of ongoing ankle management persist, the official injury report listed him as fully available.That clarity allows the Hornets to lean on his signature dynamism - no-look passes, deep-range orchestration, and paint manipulation.This comes after a turbulent stretch in which Ball missed significant time due to a right ankle impingement. His return has been gradual, but the recent uptick in minutes shows that the team is confident in his durability. With Brandon Miller also cleared, Charlotte’s offensive engine finally resembles what it was designed to be earlier this season. Still, Hornets fans understand how quickly fortunes can shift if Ball tweaks the ankle again.Chicago enters Spectrum Center in disarray. The Bulls are dealing with an injury avalanche headlined by Zach Collins, who remains out with a left scaphoid fracture, and Isaac Okoro, listed as doubtful due to lumbar radiculopathy. Several others are questionable: Nikola Vucevic (knee), Coby White (calf/injury management), Patrick Williams (wrist), Kevin Huerter (pelvic contusion), and Dalen Terry (calf).

Donald Trump and his love for golf

The current President of the USA is known for his love of golf. In fact, he loves it so much that since he started on his second term, he has golfed 75 out of 313 days of his presidency. Which is basically about 25% of his second term. And that did not come without costing a pretty buck, as latest reports suggest that President Trump has spent more than 70 million taxpayer dollars to continue his hobby.He travels not just all around the United States, but the world to feed his obsession with the sport. From New Jersey to Scotland to Dubai, he will travel anywhere as long as it means he gets to play golf, and while it's a fun time for the president, it does cost the average American citizen a pretty penny they pay in the form of taxes.Before he became the president of the United States, Donald Trump was invested in the real estate business, and owns about 17 golf courses worldwide. And he travels all around to play golf in whichever course he pleases. Sometimes it's close to home, in Washington D.C., sometimes it's a little far away in Indonesia, but golfing hasn't stopped. On Thanksgiving Day, Trump was asked about his handicap, to which he said,""I’ve won 38 club championships and I don't get to practice....SoI'm a very low handicap, and I've won 38…everyone legitimately. So I guess I got to be around scratch or better. I beat a plus three.""Having spent 75 out of 313 days of his second presidency golfing, the president has cost American taxpayers more than $70 million, and if the numbers stay the same, by the end of his tenure, he will have spent about $300 million. He frequently travels to Florida and New Jersey by air, as well as frequents his local course in Washington, D.C. to keep his love for the sport alive. He has spent a pretty penny designing these high-end golf courses and providing every amenity possible. But the cost in comparison seems a little too much.Also Read: Donald Trump brags about golf achievements after announcing National Guard Sarah Beckstrom’s death in DC shooting","The current President of the USA is known for his love of golf.

Giannis Antetokounmpo’s status remains up in the air due to a lingering left adductor strain

Giannis’ Injury Report vs the New York Knicks (November 28, 2025)

Stakes for Milwaukee’s NBA Cup Hopes

Thehead into their NBA Cup showdown against the New York Knicks on November 28, 2025, with uncertainty surrounding their franchise superstar., and the final call will be made closer to tip-off at Madison Square Garden. As the Bucks attempt to keep their Cup dreams alive, the possibility of another game without their two-time MVP looms large.Milwaukee enters this matchup under immense pressure. A six-game losing streak has dropped them to 8-11 and 11th in the Eastern Conference, a slide largely attributed to Giannis’ four-game absence. With the NBA Cup wildcard still within reach, every possession becomes crucial for a team desperate to rediscover momentum.Giannis Antetokounmpo first suffered the left adductor strain on November 17 against the Cavaliers, logging only 13 minutes before exiting the game. Since then, the Milwaukee Bucks have cautiously monitored his progress. After participating in pregame workouts and practice on November 27, he was upgraded to questionable, with coach Doc Rivers clarifying that the delay in return is not due to any physical setback.Before the injury, Giannis Antetokounmpo was in dominant form - averaging 31 points, 10.8 rebounds, and 6.8 assists across 13 games while shooting an impressive 62% from the field and 50% from beyond the arc. His absence has exposed Milwaukee’s reliance on his two-way presence, creating a noticeable drop-off in rim pressure, playmaking, and overall offensive cohesion.The Milwaukee Bucks continue to feel the impact of other injuries as well. Kevin Porter Jr. remains out following right knee meniscus surgery, Taurean Prince is sidelined due to neck surgery, and Alex Antetokounmpo is currently in the G League system.This Group C finale is critical.

DJ Moore’s injury update clears him for action ahead of the Bears’ next matchup

Every Bears fan knows the emotional trauma of checking the injury report every week like it’s a final exam score. And this week, all eyes were glued to one name: DJ Moore. After a stretch of uncertainty and practice updates that felt more dramatic than a reality show teaser, fans finally got the answer they were hoping for. The Bears star wideout and the offense’s spark plug is officially good to go. So yes, Chicago, you can exhale. Let’s break down why his availability today is a huge deal.The week began with mild panic when DJ Moore popped up in headlines after missing time in practice. Even though the team didn’t list anything major, fans immediately feared the worst. He’s the most reliable receiving option Chicago has, and losing him especially when the offense has been trying to build momentum would’ve been a nightmare.Thankfully, the final injury report confirmed the best-case scenario: DJ Moore is expected to play. He carries no injury designation, meaning the team is confident in his health and ready to deploy him as usual.This isn’t just another name returning to the lineup, this is the guy who shifts coverages, opens lanes, and gives the quarterback a dependable target when things get messy. Without Moore, defenses collapse on the run and dare Chicago to win with secondary receivers.With Moore? The entire field opens up.That’s why his availability today completely changes Chicago’s offensive plan. Expect more aggressive play-calling, deeper routes, and plenty of chances for Moore to take over the game the way he has all season.Even though he’s cleared, the Bears may still manage his workload just to avoid flare-ups. But if the game script calls for it, Moore will absolutely see meaningful volume. Chicago leans on him heavily whether it's third-down conversions, red-zone looks, or momentum-changing deep shots.Now all eyes shift to kickoff to see if he can deliver the game-changing moments Chicago desperately needs.Also read - Will Saquon Barkley play against the Chicago Bears today?
