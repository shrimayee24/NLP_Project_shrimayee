"Jayant Narlikar: Walking softly, carrying a big shtick",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jayant-narlikar-walking-softly-carrying-a-big-shtick/articleshow/121303098.cms,"Stellar cosmologist Jayant Narlikar 's passing at 86 on Tuesday, peacefully and in sleep, is reminiscent of the gift of death at will, or the ""ichha-mrityu"" that grandsire Bhishma supposedly had in the Mahabharata. And speaking of grandsires, the demise of this much-decorated and beloved doyen of Indian astrophysicists coincides with the departures of larger-than-life grey eminences M R Srinivasan, venerated ""architect"" of India's atomic power programme, and Saroj Ghose, the much-admired ""father of the science museums movement"" in India.A man of exemplary personal grace and modesty, Narlikar epitomised what the American adage of ""walk softly but carry a big stick"" advocates. And what a shtick he wielded. Barely in his twenties, had he not the intellectual audacity to challenge the scientific theories, if not shibboleths, advanced by mages of the calibre of Albert Einstein and (posthumously) Ernst Mach and Kurt Godell? The Hoyle-Narlikar Theory of Gravity challenged the more popular Big Bang Theory of the birth of the universe, ostensibly from nothingness.Rather than sudden inflation, Narlikar and his mentor envisioned a steady expansion as an alternative model of cosmic genesis. Of course, in the true spirit of science, evidence ""background radiation"" garnered later put more bucks on the Big Bang than on Slow Pulse (prompting Prof Hoyle to recite a line to The Times of India during a long interview: ""Theories that come roaring like lions also, alas, retreat bleating like lambs!"")Like our early science stalwarts C V Raman, Homi Bhabha and Meghnad Saha, Narlikar was brilliant at public outreach and pedagogy.And the centre he set up for inter-universities research in Pune did win him a Unesco Kalinga Award.When he won the Sahitya Akademi Prize for his Marathi autobiography Narlikar spoke out against kite-flying - flights of fancy and fashionable claims being made on behalf of ""ancient"" Indian science these days. These included make-in-India vimanas and astras used by gods, demons and heroes for settling local land disputes.To separate such claims from science fiction - a genre in which Narlikar had also made a mark just as his mentor Fred Hoyle did - pure science demands stronger proof, or Pramana. The latter also happens to be the title of the India-born research journal on physics and maths, an arena in which Narlikar excelled winning a Wrangler at Cambridge (with a mathematical Tripos), just as Narlikar's father had done.By claiming credit for things about which we have no evidence or proof, Narlikar warned we run the risk of reducing the credibility of what our scientists did achieve in the past.Conversely, in his book Scientific Edge, Narlikar exhorts our science buffs and aficionados to boast about epic inventions of our ancestors, such as the concept of zero that completely revolutionised mathematics globally.In his fireside chats about the story of "" Zero as a Hero "", Narlikar also used to highlight a ""publish or perish"" (aka 'publicise or perish' for scribes) moral for wannabe scientists. For the longest time, he emphasised, Arabs got exclusive credit for what are now rightfully called ""Hindu"" numerals.The polymath also used to extol the ancient roots of scepticism in India, not perhaps of the kind of journalism practised by Skeptical Inquirer today but that of the Rig Veda, the oldest recorded Sanskrit poem in the world, which contains the priceless Nasadiya Sukta, an epiphany that dares to question the very existence of gods while raising cosmological questions of such profundity as would gladden moderns seers such as Guth, Hawking and Penrose.","Jayant Narlikar's passing at 86 on Tuesday, peacefully and in sleep, is reminiscent of the gift of death at will, or the ""ichha-mrityu"" that grandsire Bhishma supposedly had in the Mahabharata.

Auston Matthews and his fans got emotional as his mother opened up about the financial struggles of getting him into hockey,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/auston-matthews-and-his-fans-got-emotional-as-his-mother-opened-up-about-the-financial-struggles-of-getting-him-into-hockey/articleshow/121166477.cms,"Image credit - Paige Taylor White/CP

Auston Matthews’ hockey dream wasn’t cheap and his mom took the weight

“I used to work in the morning for Starbucks, in the afternoon the restaurant, i was very fortunate to have two jobs. And believe me, if they would have more hours, I would have more jobs.""





Before Auston Matthews was an NHL superstar, his biggest supporter was clocking into two jobs, trying to make ends meet. His mom, Ema Matthews , didn’t just believe in his dream, she bankrolled it, penny by penny, from behind a Starbucks counter. For families without deep pockets, hockey can be financially brutal. But Ema’s resilience turned obstacles into opportunity and her son into one of the league’s brightest stars. Her story is the heartwarming reminder that every great athlete often has a real-life superhero cheering from the sidelines.Ice time, gear, coaching, travel, youth hockey isn’t just a sport, it’s a financial beast. For the Matthews family, especially with Ema being originally from Hermosillo, Mexico, the culture and cost of the sport were both daunting. But she took on the challenge without hesitation, picking up multiple jobs including a gig at Starbucks to ensure Auston never missed a chance to grow on the ice.Ema shared in a past interview that the cost of hockey often reached up to $20,000 a year, a heavy ask for any middle-class family.To make it work, she didn’t just cut corners, she picked up shifts and poured lattes while helping Auston stay focused on the sport. She even deposited small amounts of money in his account so he could grab food with teammates like a regular teen.Ema Matthews’ story also breaks stereotypes. In a sport dominated by players from Canada and northern U.S. states, Auston’s rise as a player of Mexican heritage makes his success even more impactful. It's not just about talent, it’s about trailblazing, especially for kids of color or immigrant families who rarely see themselves represented in hockey.Auston Matthews is one of the Toronto Maple Leafs ’ biggest stars and a face of the NHL. He’s not just known for his goal-scoring skills but also for his poise and work ethic, traits his mom likely helped instill. While fans celebrate his success on the ice, stories like Ema’s remind us of the sacrifices behind the scenes that made it possible.Ema Matthews’ story shows what’s possible when love, grit, and hustle lead the way.","Auston Matthews’ hockey dream wasn’t cheap and his mom took the weight of it on her shoulders.

Why the Milwaukee Bucks Consider It

Risks for Both Sides

Could thepull off a massive trade to pair Luka Dončić with? After a disappointing playoff exit, the Lakers are exploring bold moves to rebuild their championship-contending roster. One potential blockbuster deal could bring the two-time MVP to Los Angeles, reshaping the NBA landscape.The Los Angeles Lakers’ early playoff departure at the hands of the Minnesota Timberwolves has forced the front office into a critical offseason. With Luka Dončić’s future uncertain beyond next season and LeBron James nearing retirement, general manager Rob Pelinka faces tough decisions.The team must choose between:- Building depth around Dončić and James.- Swinging for a third superstar to form a historic trio.A proposed trade by Colby Faria of the Sporting News could deliver Giannis Antetokounmpo, giving the Los Angeles Lakers one of the most dominant duos in NBA history.Here’s how the deal could work:- Instant Championship Window: Pairing Dončić and Giannis Antetokounmpo would create an unstoppable pick-and-roll duo.- LeBron’s Last Ride: James may delay retirement for a shot at a fifth title.- Long-Term Star Power: Secures a future cornerstone if Dončić stays.- Draft Capital: Multiple unprotected picks offer flexibility for a rebuild.- Young Talent: Reaves and Knecht provide immediate contributors.- Financial Relief: Moves off Giannis’ supermax for future flexibility.While the trade is enticing, there are potential pitfalls:- For the Lakers: If the gamble fails, Dončić could leave in 2026, leaving the team in a full rebuild.- For the Bucks: Trading a franchise icon risks alienating fans unless the return yields future success.As analyst Colby Faria noted: ""If Giannis Antetokounmpo ended up with the Lakers, it would create one of the most talented duos in NBA history between he and Luka Dončić.""Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors could eye $70 million Boston Celtics point guard to boster squad after unfortunate playoff exit The Lakers’ front office must weigh short-term glory against long-term stability.

(Getty Images)

NFL shocked as Commanders owner claims their franchise now deserves the title of “America’s Team”



There’s a running joke in the NFL that no matter the day, no matter the stakes, and no matter your team loyalty, odds are, you’ll be watching the Dallas Cowboys . Whether it’s Sunday night, Monday night, or even Thanksgiving, the Cowboys are somehow always on your screen. That familiar sigh? It’s the ritual resignation of fans across the country, muttering at the NFL’s favoritism and Jerry Jones' media pull — and still, they watch. Why? Because, love them or hate them, the Cowboys are ratings gold.In 2024, Dallas once again proved their status as television royalty. According to Nielsen, the NFL dominated American television with 72 of the top 100 broadcasts — and the Cowboys claimed 13 of those spots. That tied them with the reigning champions, the Kansas City Chiefs. Other elite teams like the Ravens, Packers, 49ers, and Bills trailed behind. It’s a striking reflection of the Cowboys' cultural grip, even if their playoff success hasn't mirrored their broadcast domination.But just as Dallas enjoys its primetime presence, a surprising voice has emerged to challenge the team's iconic nickname — ""America’s Team.""During a recent community event in Washington, D.C., Marjorie Harris , wife of Washington Commanders ’ managing partner Josh Harris, made a statement that ruffled feathers in Dallas. While discussing her excitement for the NFL Draft coming to D.C. in 2027, she casually — but confidently — staked a claim that sent shockwaves through Cowboys Nation.""We have so much to look forward to, and look, the Commanders are America's Team ,"" Harris said with a smile. ""What better place than to have the NFL Draft than in the Mall?""The response was swift and predictably intense. Cowboys fans — who’ve clung to the “America’s Team” label since it was famously coined by NFL Films’ John Facenda in 1978 — weren’t pleased. The nickname has been a badge of honor, a symbol of national popularity that transcended even the team’s on-field performance.But in 2024, the Washington Commanders gave football fans plenty of reasons to sit up and take notice. After a dismal 4-win season in 2023, the team made a stunning turnaround, notching 12 wins and making it all the way to the NFC Championship. Spearheaded by dynamic rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels, Washington looked electric, confident, and reborn. Credit goes to new GM Adam Peters and head coach Dan Quinn, who reshaped the team with purpose and resilience. But netizens are not finding enough reasons to give them the tag.Marjorie Harris’ bold declaration didn’t come out of nowhere. Unlike many team owners' spouses, she has taken an active role in the franchise’s community efforts and serves as the chair of the Washington Commanders Foundation. Her visible presence and leadership since the family's acquisition of the team in 2023 has only strengthened ties between the organization and its fan base.And perhaps that’s the larger point Harris was making. Her comment wasn't just about branding; it was about momentum, pride, and community engagement. The Commanders are not just back — they're becoming a franchise that fans, both old and new, can rally behind.Even Philadelphia Eagles fans — fresh off a Super Bowl win — have spent more time this offseason analyzing Jayden Daniels than celebrating their own title. And now, with Cowboys fans joining the fray in outrage, Washington seems to have successfully reinserted itself into NFC East relevance.Sure, Dallas isn’t going anywhere in terms of media exposure. They’ll still headline over a dozen national broadcasts next season. The brand is as powerful as ever. But for the first time in a while, someone’s actually challenging their long-standing title — not with nostalgia, but with fresh energy and results.So, are the Commanders really America’s Team now? Not yet. But if they keep winning, and keep making the right kind of noise — both on and off the field — that conversation might not sound so outlandish in a few years.And when the 2027 NFL Draft rolls into the National Mall, the whole country just might tune in… whether the Cowboys are playing or not.Also Read: Is this the end of the NFL's most beloved kicker?

Judge calls out scandalous legal tactics in high-profile Hollywood dispute

Taylor Swift’s private world gets dragged into the spotlight — again

Rift between Swift and Lively threatens long-standing friendship

A recent federal court decision may bring a welcome sigh of relief to pop icon Taylor Swift and NFL star Travis Kelce , as a judge moves to tamp down escalating legal drama that risked pulling the couple deeper into controversy. The dispute centers around a harassment case involving actor Justin Baldoni and actress Blake Lively — a close friend of Swift — which has now taken an unexpected turn with Swift’s name being thrust into the spotlight.U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman issued a strong rebuke this week, striking from the court record a letter that accused Blake Lively’s legal team of attempting to coerce Swift into making a public statement supporting Lively.The letter, written by attorney Bryan Freedman on behalf of Baldoni, alleged that Blake Lively had threatened to release private text messages unless Swift voiced her support — a claim that Judge Liman deemed potentially libelous and lacking merit. The judge warned against “legal maneuvering” designed to ""promote scandal"" and emphasized the importance of focusing on the facts rather than stirring public drama.Taylor Swift, who skyrocketed into NFL relevance thanks to her high-profile romance with Kelce, was reportedly “really hurt” after being implicated in the legal mess. According to PEOPLE reporters Benjamin VanHoose and Sean Mandell, a source revealed that Swift and Lively were attempting to move past the situation, though recent legal moves appear to have reopened emotional wounds.The same report cited an earlier complaint filed by Justin Baldoni, which noted that Lively had allegedly referred to Swift as one of her “dragons” in a text exchange — a cryptic and telling descriptor that may hint at deeper tensions between the two friends.“Their friendship has halted,” PEOPLE reported. “Taylor wants no part in this (Lively) drama.” The fallout is especially poignant given that Swift is the godmother to Lively’s four children with husband Ryan Reynolds.A source close to the ongoing case added that a recent subpoena “fractured” the “fragile peace” between the two women, potentially ending a high-profile Hollywood friendship that once seemed unbreakable.Also Read: Donald Trump vs. Taylor Swift feud takes a toxic turn: Is it tearing apart Travis Kelce and Patrick Mahomes’ longstanding NFL brotherhood?

'Chances are still there': Abishek Porel believes in IPL 2025 playoff miracle

NEW DELHI: The IPL 2025 showdown between Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) and Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) lit up with drama as tensions boiled over between spinner Digvesh Rathi and SRH opener Abhishek Sharma during the eighth over of a pulsating run chase.The flashpoint came when Rathi dismissed a blazing Abhishek, who had hammered 59 off just 20 balls in a ferocious assault on the LSG bowlers. Attempting to launch a wide googly over the off-side, Abhishek mistimed the shot and sliced it to sweeper cover, where Shardul Thakur held onto a sharp running catch.What should have been a moment of triumph quickly turned confrontational.Rathi, known for his flamboyant ""book-sign"" celebration, unleashed it once more after the crucial breakthrough. However, the gesture didn’t sit well with Abhishek. Visibly agitated, the southpaw exchanged heated words with Rathi, prompting the umpires and teammates to intervene and cool tempers.In a video that quickly went viral, Abhishek can be seen mouthing to Rathi while walking back to the pavilion: “Teri choti pakad ke marunga” — “I'll grab your braid and beat you up.”At the time of the dismissal, SRH were flying high at 99 runs, seemingly on course to chase down LSG’s formidable 205-run total. Abhishek’s fiery innings, studded with four boundaries and six massive sixes, had given Hyderabad the perfect launchpad.Earlier in the contest, Mitchell Marsh (65) and Aiden Markram (61) laid a solid foundation for LSG with explosive half-centuries. The innings stuttered in the middle overs after skipper Rishabh Pant ’s departure for just 7, but Nicholas Pooran’s late fireworks — a 45-run blitz off 26 balls — propelled LSG past the 200-run mark.While the match had its fair share of fireworks, it was the Abhishek-Rathi spat that grabbed the spotlight. Fans flooded social media with reactions and clips, turning the heated exchange into one of the most talked-about moments of the IPL season.","IPL 2025 showdown between Lucknow Super Giants and Sunrisers Hyderabad lit up with drama.

A love story born online and went to the marriage altar

Michele Lacroix is more than Kevin De Bryune's wife

In the realm of football, you will be hard pressed to find anyone who doesn’t respect Kevin De Bruyne. But beyond the roar of the stadium and the pressure of elite competition is a personal narrative equally compelling. His wife, Michèle Lacroix, has been a rock, providing the support, love, and grounding that he has needed. Their love story didn’t launch with a glittering red carpet or the introduction of celebrities; instead, it all began with a single unassuming favourite on X. That small favor forged a lifelong bond that endures even in the face of time and fame.In 2014, on loan at Werder Bremen, he tweeted something that caught the eye of Michèle, a student at university in Genk, Belgium. She gave the tweet a like, and Kevin’s friend, being a good digital wingman, slid into her DMs on his behalf. That online exchange of words soon became, well, something a bit more conventional: regular conversations and, ultimately, what became a budding romance not long after.And two years later, Kevin got down on one knee in front of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, as romantic as it gets. In June 2017, they were married in Sorrento, Italy, in a love-filled celebration that inaugurated their married life.The couple now have three children together – Mason, Rome, and Suri – and a love that still thrives off the pitch.They have a refreshingly down-to-earth relationship despite the fanfare of professional football. Michèle has long been described as Kevin’s partner in crime and best friend, to him, and she has been credited for bringing balance to Kevin’s life.

WWE superstar Zoey Stark suffers a painful knee injury during MITB qualifier

Zoey Stark’s injury overshadows Rhea Ripley’s MITB victory

WWE Superstar Zoey Stark made her comeback to the limelight in a tragic manner on the recent episode of Monday Night RAW. What was supposed to be a critical milestone in her career, Stark got severely injured in her knee in a triple-threat qualifying match for the 2025 Women's Money in the Bank (MITB) ladder match. The incident has not only sidelined her from one of WWE’s most prestigious events but may also signal a prolonged absence from in-ring competition.The accident occurred at the Bon Secours Wellness Arena in Greenville, South Carolina, during a MITB qualifier bout between Zoey Stark, Kairi Sane, and Rhea Ripley. At its climax, Stark tried her characteristic springboard dropkick—a sportslike move that requires agility and accuracy. In targeting Kairi Sane, Stark slipped in executing the springboard, resulting in her awkwardly landing on her right leg.The blow caused her knee to bend in a distinctly unnatural manner, quite visibly startling both supporters and commentators. The match instantly became secondary as paramedics rushed onto the field to treat the hurt athlete. After the botched maneuver, Stark fell to the floor, cradling her right knee and exhibiting obvious signs of pain and distress. The referee stopped the match for a moment and motioned for medical attention. WWE ringside physicians made their way into the ring and evaluated her condition.Despite the extent of the injury, Stark first tried to leave the ring independently. She tried to stand, only to fall again, as she could no longer bear the weight of herself. Eventually, she was assisted backstage by medical personnel, affirming the severity of the ordeal.Veteran WWE play-by-play commentator Michael Cole guessed on-air that Stark may have re-aggravated an old injury. Stark had extensive knee surgery in 2021 to repair a torn ACL, MCL, and meniscus—injuries requiring months of rehabilitation.With the visual similarity and reaction of Stark, there is an increasing fear that her current injury is a recurrence or exacerbation of the same condition of the knee. But to date, WWE has not issued a formal medical diagnosis or recovery timeline. The wrestling fraternity came in support of Stark after the injury. AEW wrestler Thunder Rosa showed her concern with a heartfelt post on social media:""Wrestling is a lovely and risky sport. We leave everything on the table every time we go to the ring, and we also put a lot on the line when we do what we are passionate about. Zoey Stark, I love you, sister, and I hope that you heal soon."" — Thunder Rosa through X (previously Twitter)Zoey Stark's RAW match was her first on television since January. She had last remained an active member of the dissolved faction Pure Fusion Collective, after Sonya Deville and Shayna Baszler left. Stark was competing mainly in non-televised WWE house shows and sporadic Main Event tapings before this return.As a result of her earlier knee damage incurred during her stint in NXT, Stark was drafted to the main roster as part of the 2023 WWE Draft—a testament to how much the WWE believed in her promising future. The MITB qualifier was set to be a career-launching experience, which made her untimely injury so much more heartbreaking.With Stark out, the match went on between the remaining participants. Rhea Ripley took advantage of the situation, overpowering Kairi Sane and finishing the match with her characteristic Riptide finisher. The pinfall win earned Ripley a spot in the upcoming ladder match for Women's Money in the Bank, which is to be held on June 7. Ripley’s victory, however, was overshadowed by the concern surrounding Stark’s health, as WWE fans and analysts alike shifted focus to the severity of the injury.The extent of Stark’s injury remains unconfirmed by WWE, leaving her return date unknown. Given her history of severe knee damage, fans and medical experts fear that she could face another lengthy recovery process. This injury not only removes her from one of WWE’s most career-defining matches but also risks stalling the momentum she had just begun to regain. For now, Zoey Stark’s fans—and the WWE Universe as a whole—await official word from WWE’s medical team.","WWE superstar Zoey Stark suffers a painful knee injury during MITB qualifier match.

NEW DELHI: Rishabh Pant 's nightmare run in IPL 2025 hit a new low on Monday as his Lucknow Super Giants were knocked out of playoff contention following a loss to Sunrisers Hyderabad The under-fire captain, who promoted himself to No. 3 in the do-or-die clash, managed just 7 runs off 6 balls before falling to a sharp return catch by Eshan Malinga . With just 135 runs from 12 games at an average of 12.27 and a strike rate of 100, Pant is staring at his worst IPL season yet.Amid mounting criticism, former India cricketer and coach Yograj Singh has come out in support of the struggling star. In an interview with IANS, Yograj identified technical flaws in Pant's batting — notably his unsteady head and an opening left shoulder — and said these issues could be corrected almost instantly.“Rishabh Pant's problem can be fixed in just five minutes. His head isn't steady, and his left shoulder is opening up too much. With a bit of focused correction, he'll be back to his best in no time,” said Yograj, father of former India all-rounder Yuvraj Singh Pant, speaking after LSG's six-wicket defeat, blamed injuries to key bowlers like Mohsin Khan and Mayank Yadav for their disappointing season. Despite the setbacks, he stressed the team's fighting spirit and highlighted their strong batting depth as a major positive heading into the future.","Rishabh Pant's nightmare run in IPL 2025 hit a new low as his Lucknow Super Giants were knocked out of playoff contention following a loss to Sunrisers Hyderabad.

'Shubman Gill used his brains a lot more than the other guys'

NEW DELHI: Abhishek Sharma stole the spotlight with a breathtaking 59 off just 20 balls, setting the tone for Sunrisers Hyderabad ’s emphatic six-wicket win over Lucknow Super Giants in Match 61 of IPL 2025 at the Ekana Stadium .The young left-hander’s fireworks at the top helped SRH chase down a challenging target of 206 with 10 balls to spare, dashing LSG’s hopes of making the playoffs.Opening alongside Atharva Taide, Abhishek came out with aggressive intent, taking on the bowlers from the outset.He smashed four boundaries and cleared the rope six times in his whirlwind knock, reaching his fifty real quick.His fearless hitting saw SRH race to 99 in under eight overs before he was dismissed by Digvesh Rathi, slicing a wide googly to sweeper cover, a moment that sparked a heated exchange between the two players.Even after Abhishek’s departure, SRH maintained control. Ishan Kishan contributed a brisk 35 off 28, while Heinrich Klaasen added a fluent 47 off 28 to ensure the chase stayed on track.Brief interruptions, including Kamindu Mendis retiring hurt, didn’t slow the innings, as Aniket Verma and Nitish Reddy finished the job comfortably in the 19th over.Earlier, Lucknow Super Giants posted a solid 205/7, thanks to Mitchell Marsh (65 off 39), Aiden Markram (61 off 38), and a late flourish from Nicholas Pooran (45 off 26).However, LSG’s bowling lacked sting, with only Digvesh Rathi (2/37 in 4 overs) managing breakthroughs. Their inability to contain runs during the powerplay and middle overs proved costly.With this result, SRH keep their campaign alive while LSG bow out of the playoff race.

IPL Auction: Rajasthan Royals make Vaibhav Suryavanshi youngest IPL crorepati

NEW DELHI : Rajasthan Royals have struggled for consistency this season and lost several close games, but the emergence of 14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi has been a silver lining for the franchise.Suryavanshi, already a centurion in IPL-2025 and the talk of the cricketing world, again exhibited his raw talent and audacious strokeplay on Tuesday, with the Chennai Super Kings being at the receiving end of the stick this time around. Suryavanshi (57 off 33b; 4x4, 4x6) continued with his fearless approach as the Royals chased down a target of 188 in just 17.1 overs at the Arun Jaitley Stadium, winning by 6 wickets in the end.Suryavanshi’s opening partner Yashasvi Jaiswal (36 off 19b; 5x4, 2x6) set the tone for Rajasthan in spectacular fashion. Taking on Khaleel Ahmed early, Jaiswal peppered the boundary ropes. After Jaiswal was castled by Anshul Kamboj, Suryavanshi shifted gears during a rollicking, 98-run second-wicket partnership with skipper Sanju Samson (41 off 31b; 3x4, 2x6). Suryavanshi combined textbook drives with innovative shots, never letting the bowlers settle. Despite his age, Suryavanshi’s temperament was that of a seasoned campaigner.In the company of Samson, Suryavanshi ensured the required run-rate never spiralled out of control.Dhruv Jurel (31 not out off 12b; 2x4, 3x6) and Shimron Hetmyer (12 not out off 5b; 1x4, 1x6) completed the formalities for the Royals. Earlier, it was an all-too-familiar uncertain start for CSK. Once again, it was left to the team’s ‘youth brigade’ to step up as the team got to 187/8 in their 20 overs after Royals elected to field first.Opener Devon Conway and one drop Urvil Patel were dismissed in the second over by Rajasthan pacer Yudhvir Singh Charak. Conway, in particular, fell to a soft dismissal, caught at mid-off by Riyan Parag while trying to force the pace. Youngster Patel, too, couldn’t gauge the pace of Yudhvir and was caught at mid-on. His slog to a hard length delivery didn’t meet the desired result as the bat turned in his hand while making contact. The double strike left CSK reeling at 12/2 by the end of the second over.Into the cauldron stepped 17-yearold Ayush Mhatre, already touted as one of the finds of the season. Unfazed by the early wickets, Mhatre (43 off 20b; 8x4, 1x6) counter-attacked with a flurry of boundaries, displaying a maturity and range of strokes well beyond his years. He found an able partner in Ravichandran Ashwin (13 off 8b; 1x4, 1x6), who was promoted up the order, and together they stitched a brisk partnership of 56 runs.SCORES: RR 188/4 in 17.1 overs (V Suryavanshi 57, S Samson 41, Y Jaiswal 36, D Jurel 31*) beat CSK 187/8 in 20 overs (A Mhatre 43, D Brevis 42, S Dube 39, MS Dhoni 16; Madhwal 3/29, Yudhvir 3/47) by 6 wickets .",14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi becomes youngest IPL crorepati.

“It really f**ks with you”: The hidden struggle behind Rob Gronkowski’s retirement through a different lens,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/it-really-fks-with-you-the-hidden-struggle-behind-rob-gronkowskis-retirement-through-a-different-lens/articleshow/121305493.cms,"Rob Gronkowski opens up about his post NFL crisis (Credit: Imagn Images)

Inside Rob Gronkowski’s post NFL crisis

Rob Gronkowski On Mike Vrabel's Patriots, Belichick At UNC & Joining Brady On Buccaneers | Bussin'

When NFL superstar Rob Gronkowski retired at just 32, many fans saw it as the end of a glorious chapter. With multiple Super Bowl rings and a legendary career with the Patriots and Buccaneers, it looked like Gronk had it all figured out. But beneath the surface, his retirement marked the beginning of a very different battle, one that had nothing to do with physical injuries and everything to do with identity, purpose, and routine.Athletes like Rob Gronkowski spend their lives in highly structured environments. Every hour of their day training, eating, recovering, studying plays is scheduled for peak performance. It’s not just a routine, it’s a way of life. So, when the game stops, the silence that follows can be deafening.In a recent episode of the Bussin' With The Boys podcast released Tuesday, Gronkowski gave a raw and revealing account of what retirement truly felt like and it wasn’t the freedom or relief many might expect. Gronk’s recent comments about how retirement “f**ks with you” aren’t just about missing the game, they’re about losing the framework that held everything together.""Once you retire, that routine is completely thrown out the window,"" Gronkowski said. ""Now, it’s up to you to schedule when you're going to work out, when you're going to study, when you're going to handle everything else. If you get off that routine, it really f**ks with you. You start feeling mentally weak, like you’re all over the place, not doing the right things, missing workouts.""This candid reflection highlights a side of retirement rarely discussed in sports media. For years, Gronkowski’s life revolved around structure, training schedules, game days, media appearances, and team meetings. It wasn’t just a job, it was a framework for living. Stepping away from that structure meant losing more than a career, it meant losing the rhythm that defined his days and, in many ways, his identity.Without that discipline imposed from the outside, Gronk was left to self-manage a lifestyle that had once been managed for him. For someone used to high-performance environments, this sudden freedom didn’t feel liberating, it felt disorienting. What Gronkowski is going through speaks to a broader issue athletes face when their careers end.Also read: “Playing on the field”: Former teammates Rob Gronkowski and Julian Edelman take jabs at Tom Brady, stir fan reactions There’s often no playbook for adjusting to “normal” life. His vulnerability is a powerful reminder that mental health challenges don’t end with the final whistle. In fact, for many, that’s when they begin. Gronk’s story isn’t just about the NFL. It’s about how deeply identity is tied to structure and how difficult it can be to rebuild oneself once that structure is gone","NFL superstar Rob Gronkowski retired at just 32, many fans saw it as the end of a glorious chapter.

Why was Bruce Bochy ejected

Bruce Bochy arguing with umpire Torres (image source: Getty)

Was Aaron Judge supposed to get struck out

The Rangers vs Yankees game tonight saw some wrong calls and a very angry Bruce Bochy charging into the dugout over it. The Texas Rangers' manager stood by the team and charged the field to argue over a wrong call, which led him to get his first ejection of 2025.As per live footage from the Texas Rangers vs New York Yankees game, Bruce Bochy, the manager of the Rangers, was ejected by umpire Carlos Torres for arguing over a wrong call.In the sixth inning, when Jacob Webb was pitching 0-1 to Aaron Judge, his pitch was called an outside pitch by umpire Torres. Though it was a close call, it angered Bruce Bochy. The main reason behind this was that there were very questionable calls made throughout the game, which seemed like the umpire was favoring the Yankees.There were supposedly three missed calls made when Aaron Judge was at bat, due to which Bruce Bochy finally took a stand for his team. After getting ejected, he went to the field and had a chat with umpire Torres. Though the conversation could not be heard, it was clear that Bochy had a calm demeanor throughout the situation. This was Bochy’s first ejection in the 2025 season.As per various footage from the game, there were supposedly various such calls which would have forced Judge back into the pavilion.Though the Yankees won the match, there were several reports from fans and baseball experts stating that wrong calls were made throughout the game. Besides, when Bruce Bochy went to the field to talk about wrong calls made by umpire Torres, the Yankees fans were booing him through and through. Though Bochy’s interference did not make any changes in the game, except for him getting ejected, it does raise questions on the umpires’ decision-making capabilities.Would the Rangers have won the game if Torres had never made the wrong calls? Maybe, as the team has been playing quite well. However, they lost the match to the Yankees with the final score being 5-2, in the Yankees' favor.Also Read: Texas Rangers make tough decision as outfielder Evan Carter suffers from right quad strain","Bruce Bochy, the manager of the Rangers, was ejected by umpire Carlos Torres for arguing over a wrong call.

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 5: Shane Watson on how IPL gave him a lifeline & his tribute to Phil Hughes

NEW DELHI: In a video posted by the Rajasthan Royals on their social media accounts, Vaibhav Suryavanshi is seen clarifying to Punjab Kings' Musheer Khan that he wasn't crying after getting out. He clarified: ""When did I cry? Let me explain. My eyes were hurting a lot. When I got out, I looked at the big screen and the light hit my eyes. So I had to rub my eyes.""Since then, the 14-year-old prodigy has smoked a 35-ball century and a 15-ball 40. But on Tuesday at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in New Delhi, he showed a different side to his batting.Vaibhav has caught the eye with his shot-making and six-hitting prowess, but against CSK , he showed maturity beyond his age. He put on a 98-run second-wicket partnership with Sanju Samson that kind of sealed the deal for the Royals.Royals batting coach Vikram Rathour hailed Suryavanshi's 33-ball 57 in their six-wicket win over CSK.""Very impressive,"" Rathour told reporters here.""Again, we've been working with him for quite some time now, maybe three to four months. So, we've seen all these aspects, but it's great to see him doing that in a game, in pressure situations, in a big game like even today. The ball was doing a bit when he went in, he hardly got any balls, and didn't get on strike too much in the power play.""But again, the kind of maturity he showed, the kind of temperament he showed, was really good for him. And these kinds of experiences will definitely make him a better player in the coming time,"" said Rathour.Suryavanshi lost opening partner Yashasvi Jaiswal relatively early, having faced only three balls until Jaiswal got out in 3.4 overs. He scored only 12 from his first 10 balls.But Suryavanshi took charge after Jaiswal fell, swinging his 11th ball for six off Noor Ahmed and driving the next two deliveries for four through the covers. He hit two massive sixes over long-on in one over off Ravindra Jadeja and reached his fifty in 27 balls by heaving Noor over square leg for his fourth six.The left-hander was dismissed after 33 deliveries when he played a wild swipe to off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin and was caught at backward point.This time around, he did look dejected and trudged back visibly upset with himself.Suryavanshi made headlines last October when, aged 13, he scored a 58-ball century for India Under-19s in a Youth Test against Australia U-19s in Chennai.Rathour, who was also part of the Team India setup as batting coach, said he was ""sold"" when he first saw Suryavanshi bat in the nets.""There's a team on the back end who watch all the leagues, all kinds of cricket. And they recommended him. He scored that 100 against Australia U-19, I think. So, the recommendation was made. And honestly, when I saw him for the first time, I was sold.""Just with the downswing of his bat, I think he's very, very unique. I haven't seen something like that for a long, long time. And then he's now showing that he's got temperament as well. So, I think he's going to be a very, very special player,"" said Rathour with a beaming smile on his face.Suryavanshi, who only turned 14 last month and was signed at last year's auction for Rs 1.1 crore, became the youngest player to feature in the IPL earlier in April and made an immediate impact by hitting his first ball for six on his debut, which he had predicted in front of a teammate in another video circulating on social media.""We saw him for the first time. He's been batting in the nets, and we saw what he could do. But then, again, to do it in a game situation is something altogether different. But doing it once is, again, something different. But then, scoring runs the last game, and even today's knock was, I think, even better because he showed a different side of his temperament or his batting,"" said Rathour.At the start of the tournament, Suryavanshi was in contention to play. He got the chance only because Rajasthan Royals' skipper Sanju Samson got injured.Royals skipper Sanju Samson, too, has lavished praise on Suryavanshi and was in awe of his maturity after his knock against CSK.""I don't have words for him,"" Rajasthan Royals captain Sanju Samson said at the post-match presentation.""He can hit over the leg side, he can wait and hit slower balls over covers for six. That tells you what kind of talent and temperament he has. Today when the middle overs were going on, he smartly picked his options,"" Samson said.""Today when the middle overs were going on, he smartly picked his options. It shows he is smart as well. That is a stunning combination with the potential, talent, and game awareness. There is something special for Indian cricket.""In his first IPL edition, the boy from Samastipur, Bihar, has shown that age doesn't matter much, because what's beyond doubt is that he is very young, gifted, and has the world at his feet. In seven outings, he scored 252 runs with a strike rate of 206.56.He has shown a teaser to the whole world, and he is only 14. And Royals coach Rahul Dravid has said that the teenager is still an unfinished article, which certainly is not a good sign for the bowlers in the future.",Rajasthan Royals' Vaibhav Suryavanshi scored 33-ball 57 in their six-wicket win over CSK.

When will CSK legend MS Dhoni retire from IPL? Astrologer Greenstone Lobo predicts

Poll What do you think is the main reason behind Dhoni's popularity? His leadership skills His performance on the field His charisma and personality His past achievements

NEW DELHI : It was just past 3 pm. The temperature was a harsh 40 degrees Celsius. With the sun beating down, and humidity as well, the heat felt far oppressive. Unmindful, two fans dressed in a yellow No. 7 jersey were spotted on Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg. Both were walking towards the Kotla ground like moths towards a flame. The CSK-RR game, scheduled to begin at 7.30 pm, was still over four hours away.It’s the power of being Mahendra Singh Dhoni . His relationship with CSK fans is one of the most enduring love stories of modern sport. And it is a pan-India phenomenon. Virat Kohli too can convert most stadiums across India into a home ground for his team. He is a serving international though. For someone who retired from international cricket five years ago, MSD’s unceasing ability to get jerseys on the back and bums on the seat would make any rock star envious.On Tuesday, it became increasingly evident as time rolled by. What started as a trickle slowly turned into a bustle. Yellow emerged as the dominant colour on the street. Seven was the only number on every CSK back.Before the game, CSK stood last in the IPL 2025 table. But every defeat this IPL season has made it even more apparent that Dhoni fans do not see this relationship through the prism of his performance with the bat. It is the memory of the 5 titles that CSK won under his leadership that’s hardwired into their hearts.It makes him performance-proof. “My love for him has nothing to do with the number of runs he scores,” says software developer Vikash Purbey in a Dhoni tee. And Kailash Chand Jain, who sells IPL jerseys across north Indian cities hosting IPL, says Dhoni still sells more shirts than any player, barring Kohli.On Tuesday too, the Kotla stands were largely an enthusiastic sea of yellow. A poster said, “Abhi na jao chhod kar, ke dil abhi bhara nahi.”That probably is the everlasting emotion of many CSK fans.",MS Dhoni's relationship with CSK fans is one of the most enduring love stories of modern sport.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.

T.J Watt’s future with Pittsburgh Steelers in doubt amid contract uncertainty

With an NFL career spanning over a decade, the Pittsburgh Steelers’ linebacker T.J. Watt is no less than a knight in shining armor for his team. Despite being a key player in the team, the question regarding Watt’s contract extension looms ahead of the 2025 NFL season. As fans have started to grow impatient to get an update regarding Watt’s contract hold-up, a few sources confirm further delay. Amid the huge offseason trade-ins like Myles Garrett and Maxx Crosby, the Steelers’ current hold up with Watt is only building more curiosity among the fan base.Rewinding to 2021, Watt was successful in holding his ground to land a massive deal with the Steelers. Fast-forwarding to this year being the last of his four-year contract deal signed in 2021, his contract status remains undisclosed. Being one of the best players on the team, fans remain highly positive about his extension; however, no official thumbs-up from the team is raising questions.Recently, Steelers’ digest editor and writer Bob Labriola gave his take on the Watts’ situation during his usual interaction routine with fans on the “Asked & Answered” podcast. Responding to a fan’s question regarding the contract delay of the team’s linebacker, Lariola stated, “Patience.Signing a superstar such as T.J. Watt to a contract extension is not a simple matter, and so it's going to take time. Those kinds of things usually take place during the summer, and we're not even to Memorial Day yet. ”With teams like the Cleveland Browns landing a $160 million deal with Garrett for a four-year contract, the expectations among elite players like Watt are inevitably going to rise. Considering the exceptional record of Watt over the years, he is easily the strong backbone inside the team. Watt being key to the team’s incredible gameplay, the team might be making a decision very soon. Even though the Steelers have not put an official word forward, they might not be looking forward to losing a player like Watt with the 2025 NFL season at hand.Also Read: Jalen Milroe holds off on jersey number as a form of respect for the veteran players in the team",T.J Watt’s future with Pittsburgh Steelers in doubt amid contract uncertainty.

Tour de France's new Montmartre climb could be a game changer. It sparks controversy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/tour-de-frances-new-montmartre-climb-could-be-a-game-changer-it-sparks-controversy/articleshow/121288733.cms,"Tour de France's new Montmartre climb could be a game changer. It sparks controversy (AP)





PARIS: Breaking with tradition at the Tour de France is stirring controversy.Since race organizers announced plans last week to climb the iconic Montmartre hill in Paris during the final stage in July, the cycling world has been abuzz. Could the climb actually decide the Tour winner? Or disrupt the final sprint by injecting tactical uncertainty into what is usually a celebratory day?Well, that remains to be seen. But one thing seems certain: The stage will be a spectacle.At last year's Olympics, massive crowds lined the streets of Montmartre - the area in the northern part of Paris that is popular among artists and offers grand vistas of the city - to cheer on riders.Inspired by the frenetic atmosphere and willing to build on the momentum, Tour organizers said this month that riders competing in cycling's biggest race this summer would climb the Montmartre hill and pass beneath the Sacre-Coeur basilica before ""battling it out on a stage that may break from the traditions established over the past 50 years in the heart of the capital.""Traditionally, the Tour final stage is largely processional until a sprint decides the day's winner on the Champs-Elysees. Last year's final stage was held outside Paris for the first time since 1905 because of a clash with the Olympics, moving instead to Nice. The world famous avenue is back on the program this year for the conclusion of the 3,320-kilometer (2,060-mile) race.The inclusion of the steep Montmartre climb could dramatically change the dynamics of the stage.If the hill features just a few kilometers from the finish line, or is climbed several times, pure sprinters will likely be dropped before they can compete for the stage win. And if the general classification remains tight ahead of the final stage, the yellow jersey itself could be decided in Paris.Riders not happy Full details of the route will be presented at a news conference on Wednesday. With a peloton roughly twice as big as it was at the Olympics, organizers are working with Paris authorities and the Prefecture of police to ensure the security of the race on the narrow and cobbled streets of the area. But some top riders have already expressed their lack of enthusiasm about the addition.""Montmartre was nice to do in the Olympics, it seemed good, a lot of people, a really good atmosphere,"" two-time Tour champion Jonas Vingegaard told reporters this week. ""But when they came to the Montmartre, there was only 15 riders left in the bunch. And when we do the Tour de France, there will be 150 guys fighting for positions on a very narrow climb. It could end up being more stress than they want to have.""Even Remco Evenepoel, who won the Olympic men's road race in Paris last year and the gold medal in the time trial, is also opposed to the idea.""There will be enough battle for positioning in the first week of the Tour,"" he told sports media Sporza. ""With Montmartre added, that would mean we have to do the same on the last day. We will be tired enough by then.""Evenepoel also lamented the fact that sprinters would be robbed of a rare chance to claim a prestigious win on the world famous avenue.""They get a big chance every year to sprint for a stage win on the Champs-Elysees,"" he said. ""That chance is then taken away from them. In my opinion, Montmartre is an unnecessary obstacle.""Marc Madiot, who manages the Groupama-FDJ team, said bad weather on the final day could make the stage more treacherous.""Imagine a slight rain in Paris; it's not going to be easy for the riders,"" he told RMC Radio. ""Do we want a show? Do we want to visit Paris? Do we want to commemorate the Olympics? If we expect a real race, we could be disappointed. And if we do get a real race, we put everything that has happened in the last three weeks in jeopardy.""The Tour starts from the northern city of Lille on July 5, and the women's race kicks off on July 26 from the Brittany town of Vannes.",The Tour de France will climb the iconic Montmartre hill in Paris during the final stage. The climb could disrupt the final sprint by injecting tactical uncertainty into what is usually a celebratory day. Last year's final stage was held outside Paris for the first time since 1905 because of a clash with the Olympics.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121288780,imgsize-1371372,width-400,resizemode-4/121288780.jpg"

Indian-origin Saikat Charabarti who announced his run in the 2026 Democratic primary for California's 11th Congressional District, has recently expressed his opinion in favor of the H-1B visa program. He said he thinks the US should have more H-1B visas as he envisions the country as the one that his father came into. ""My position on H-1B visas is that I think we should have more immigration. I kind of envision trying to create a country like the one my dad came into where we are recruiting people that come, you know? Where it doesn't look as if we're in zero-sum game when it comes to immigration,"" the Democrat leader who worked for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders said.But he pitched for reforms in the program to push the wages. ""As I mentioned at the event, America in the 1970s actually had immigration offices around the world RECRUITING people to come to this country. We were such a place of growth, optimism and opportunity that we were actually begging immigrants to come help build this country.

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings (CSK) head coach Stephen Fleming has admitted that their team deserved to be at the bottom of the points table because of the kind of cricket they have played in this year's IPL With just one game left, CSK are currently languishing at the bottom of the points table with just three wins.""No, we obviously don't like being down there [in the points table]. We wanted just a good performance. We're trying to string some performances together. The aim was two good performances. Now it'll be one good one to finish. It's probably fitting that we're at the bottom,"" he told reporters after Rajasthan Royals defeated CSK by six wickets on Tuesday evening.""We've played that type of cricket, so you can't hide away from it. But what we do want to do is just put in a much better performance that reflects the ability of the team.""Rajasthan Royals' bowlers executed their plans to perfection in the final overs. They consistently nailed their yorkers, effectively drying up the boundaries and stifling CSK's scoring rate.

We've got some strong ideas for next year, so that all facets are covered. But that hasn't been possible this year because of the lack of runs at the top.""A lot of the batting positions are determined by how well a start we have, and then guys can fall into line. So we haven't had that. So we've been just patching innings up, really, rather than constructing good innings,"" he said.",Stephen Fleming says Chennai Super Kings deserved to be at the bottom of the points table.

Vaibhav Suryavanshi , just 14, top-scored with a brilliant 57 as Rajasthan Royals ended their season on a high, beating CSK by six wickets.
