Newly crowned chess world champion D Gukesh responded to critiques regarding the quality of his World Chess Championship match against Ding Liren .He emphasised that victory in high-stakes matches isn't solely determined by gameplay. He believes willpower and character are equally crucial, qualities he feels he amply demonstrated.At 18, Gukesh defeated Liren in the 14-game world championship match, scoring 7.5-6.5. This victory makes him the youngest world champion in chess history.Former world champions Magnus Carlsen and Vladimir Kramnik expressed their disappointment with the quality of play displayed during the championship match, which concluded on Thursday.Carlsen remarked that the match resembled ""a second round or third round match of an open tournament.""Kramnik's assessment was even more critical, stating that the match represented the ""end of chess as we know it.""Asked if he was hurt by Carlsen's comments, Gukesh told BBC World, ""Not really"".Gukesh acknowledged the validity of some of the criticisms regarding the quality of play. However, he underscored the importance of non-chess factors in determining the outcome of a world championship match.""I get that maybe in some of the games, the quality was not high but I think the world championship matches are decided not purely by chess but by who has the better character and who has the better willpower. And I think those qualities, I did show quite well.""While acknowledging the pressure of the world championship, Gukesh admitted he aspired to a higher level of play. He recognised the unique demands of such a high-profile competition.""And the pure chess part, it was not at a very high level as I would have liked it to be because it's a new experience for me. So the workload was different, the pressure was different.""It's understandable that I was a bit off but I managed to strike at the critical moments, which I am happy about,"" said Gukesh.Ding Liren's critical error, which ultimately cost him the championship title, also drew criticism.FIDE president Arkady Dvorkovich offered a different perspective on the error. He suggested that such mistakes add to the excitement of the sport.Indian chess legend Viswanathan Anand offered his congratulations to Gukesh. He advised the young champion to disregard the criticism.""I feel very happy. I was literally watching history being made yesterday. It (criticism) comes with every match. To be honest, I think it just comes with the territory. You ignore it and that's all,"" said Anand.",D Gukesh is the youngest chess world champion in history. The 18-year-old defeated Ding Liren in the 14-game world championship match. Former world champions Magnus Carlsen and Vladimir Kramnik expressed their disappointment with the quality of play displayed during the match.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116295294,imgsize-204360,width-400,resizemode-4/116295294.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Former England cricketer Isa Guha embroiled herself in a big controversy after making a racially insensitive remark about Jasprit Bumrah during commentary on Day 2 of the third Test in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series against Australia at the Gabba.In the opening half hour of play on Day 2, Bumrah dismissed Australian openers Usman Khawaja and Nathan McSweeney, leaving former Australia pacer Brett Lee impressed as he shared his thoughts on the session while commentating for Fox Cricket.""Bumrah, today: five overs, 2-4. So, that's the tone, and that's what you want from the ex-skipper,"" Lee said.In response to Lee's praise, Guha sparked controversy with an eyebrow-raising remark, referring to Bumrah as a ""primate.""""Well, he's the MVP, isn't he? Most valuable primate, Jasprit Bumrah,"" she added.The incident drew parallels to the infamous 2008 'MonkeyGate' controversy, when Harbhajan Singh was accused by the late Andrew Symonds of using a racial slur by calling him a monkey.Bumrah (5/72) was the only bright spot for India on a day where Travis Head (152) and Steve Smith (101) centuries took Australia to 405/7 at the close of play on Day 2.Bumrah dismissed them both after tea but not until the pair had batted through the entire middle session to undo India's positive start of three morning wickets.Victory at the Gabba would put Australia within one test win of sealing their place in the WTC final while taking India's hopes of reaching the decider out of their hands.","Former England cricketer Isa Guha embroiled herself in a big controversy.

NEW DELHI: India's star batter Virat Kohli faced heavy criticism from fans after an underwhelming dismissal on Day 3 of the third Test at the Gabba in Brisbane.Kohli, coming in at number four after early losses of Yashasvi Jaiswal (4) and Shubman Gill (1), failed to stabilise the innings. He edged a full delivery from Josh Hazlewood to wicketkeeper Alex Carey, despite having the option to leave the ball.Kohli walked back to the pavilion visibly disappointed, adding another low score to his series tally.The series hasn’t been a smooth ride for Kohli.After scoring just 5 runs in the opening Test in Perth, he roared back with a magnificent century in the second innings, helping India secure a dominant 295-run victory.However, he struggled again in the second Test in Adelaide, scoring only 7 and 11 as India fell to a 10-wicket defeat.At the Gabba, Kohli was expected to anchor the innings after the early setbacks, but the 36-year-old faltered, chasing a delivery outside off-stump that was comfortably pouched by Carey.His dismissal left fans frustrated, with many taking to social media to criticise his form and even calling for his retirement.1st Test in Perth: 5 and 100*2nd Test in Adelaide: 7 and 113rd Test in Brisbane: 3 (current match)","Virat Kohli dismissed for three on Day 3 of the third Test at the Gabba in Brisbane.

Manchester City vs Manchester United Predicted Lineups

Manchester City:

Manchester United:

NEW DELHI: Manchester City and Manchester United head into Sunday’s derby at the Etihad Stadium seeking a much-needed boost amid ongoing struggles.City (8-4-3, 27 points) are in unfamiliar territory, with only one win in their last 10 matches (1-7-2) across all competitions. A 3-0 league victory over Nottingham Forest and a 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace earlier this month marked slight improvements, but Pep Guardiola’s side is still in fourth place, eight points behind league leaders Liverpool, who have a game in hand.Kevin De Bruyne’s recent return from injury, highlighted by a goal and an assist against Forest, has provided some hope, but the absence of Rodri for the rest of the season compounds City’s woes. A 2-0 defeat to Juventus in the Champions League midweek leaves them at risk of missing the knockout phase with two games remaining. Despite the setbacks, Guardiola defended his team, stating, “The soul and spirit of this team is there.”United (5-6-4, 19 points) are also enduring a tough stretch under new manager Ruben Amorim, who will experience his first Manchester derby. United sit 13th in the table, with just one win in four league games under Amorim—a convincing 4-0 victory over Everton featuring braces from Marcus Rashford and Joshua Zirkzee. Rashford, however, has since fallen out of the starting lineup.Amorim, known for his success in derbies while managing Sporting Lisbon, struck a cautious tone, acknowledging that the match doesn’t carry the high stakes typically associated with a City-United clash. “It should be two great teams fighting for the title,” he admitted. “But it is not that at the moment. Both teams are struggling.”The Manchester City vs Manchester United derby is scheduled to kick off at 10:00 PM IST. For viewers in the United Kingdom, the match will begin at 4:30 PM. In the United States, it is set to start at 11:30 AM Eastern Time.Ortega, Walker, Dias, Simpson-Pusey, Gvardiol, Kovacic, Silva, Foden, De Bruyne, Nunes, Haaland.Onana, Mazraoui, De Ligt, Martinez, Diallo, Mainoo, Ugarte, Dalot, Fernandes, Garnacho, Hojlund.","Manchester City and Manchester United head into Sunday's derby seeking a much- needed boost amid ongoing struggles.

SGA’s Leadership and Support from His Wife

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander , one of the rising stars in the NBA , has quickly become the face of the Oklahoma City Thunder . As a young leader on the team, SGA continues to excel, both as a player and as a mentor for the Thunder's younger candidates. Despite his success on the court, Gilgeous-Alexander's personal life also plays a significant role in shaping his growth. His wife, Hailey Summers , has been a vital part of his support system, helping him stay grounded and focused.In a recent interview with Marc Spears , Shai Gilgeous-Alexander spoke about his wife, Hailey Summers, and the influence she has on his game. According to SGA, Hailey is not scared to be honest with him, especially when it comes to his performance.""If my mindset is off, she makes sure I know,"" Gilgeous-Alexander shared. ""Those are the things that I can control. And she can see if I wear it on my sleeve. She can see if I’m not aggressive and say, ‘What is the point of being out there if you’re not being aggressive?’ It’s a little hard, but I’m like, ‘[Expletive] you’re right.’""This direct approach from Hailey helps keep SGA on track, reminding him to stay aggressive and focused during games, ensuring he always gives his best.SGA's role as a head for the OKC Thunder has grown ever since he was traded to the team in 2019. His performance and supervision have guided the Thunder to be one of the top teams in the Western Conference. With a team full of young talents like Chet Holmgren and Jalen Williams, Shai has adopted the responsibility of being the go-to player.""I embrace it for sure. It comes with a burden,” he explained. “It comes with the crown. It comes with all the things you dream about as a kid being a superstar in the NBA. I definitely dreamed about being this as a player and these things come with it. And I knew that. So, I definitely embrace it.""As he leads the Thunder toward future championships, SGA remains focused, both on and off the court, continuing to inspire his teammates and fans alike.Also Read : NBA Star Gilbert Arenas' Ex-Girlfriend Laura Govan Shares The Reclassification News Of Her Their Son Alijah Arenas","Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has become the face of the Oklahoma City Thunder.

NEW DELHI: Former England cricketer Isa Guha has apologised for her choice of words while praising Jasprit Bumrah during the third Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy at The Gabba.The remark, directed at India's pace spearhead Bumrah, has reignited conversations about unconscious bias and cultural sensitivity in sports commentary.On Sunday, the incident occurred as Guha, responding to Brett Lee ’s glowing assessment of Bumrah’s fiery spell, referred to him as the ""MVP—Most Valuable Primate.""While her intention may have been to highlight the enormity of Bumrah's achievements as India’s standout bowler in a tough game, the use of “primate” struck an uncomfortable chord.""Yesterday in commentary I used a word that can be interpreted in a number of different ways. I'd like to apologise for any offence caused. I set myself really high standards when it comes to empathy and respect of others,"" said Guha.""If you listen to the full transcript I only meant the highest praise for one of India's greatest players. And someone that I admire greatly. I'm an advocate for equality and someone who has spent their career thinking about inclusion and understanding in the game,"" she added.""I was trying to frame the enormity of his achievement and I've chosen the wrong word. And for that I am deeply sorry. As someone who is also of south Asian heritage I hope people would recognise there was no other intention or malice there, and I hope this hasn't overshadowed what has been a great Test match so far - and I look forward to seeing how it progresses.""Given cricket’s fraught history with racial tensions, including the infamous ‘Monkeygate’ scandal between Harbhajan Singh and Andrew Symonds in 2008, Guha’s comment inevitably drew comparisons.","Former England cricketer Isa Guha has apologised for her choice of words while praising Jasprit Bumrah during the third Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy at The Gabba.

"World Chess Championship: Fair Play Officer found job easier due to D Gukesh, Ding Liren’s impeccable behaviour",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/chess/world-chess-championship-fair-play-officer-found-job-easier-due-to-d-gukesh-ding-lirens-impeccable-behaviour/articleshow/116329998.cms,"D Gukesh vs Ding Liren (PTI Photo)

In the high-pressure crucible of the World Chess Championship , it wasn’t just the brilliance of D Gukesh ’s moves that left an indelible mark – it was his unwavering poise under tense situations that etched an unforgettable impression. The 18-year-old prodigy played not only with his mind but also with his heart, fighting every battle as though the board was a stage and he, the lead actor in a drama of unyielding resolve.Yet, it was his demeanour, as much as his daring, that caught the attention of those who observed him up close. Aleksandar Colovik , the Fair Play Officer of the blue-ribbon event tasked with ensuring the tournament’s integrity, noted that his job was made easier because of how well-behaved both Gukesh and former champion Ding Liren were.“They are very similar in many ways – both cultured and well-mannered. They both shook their legs when nervous, but in different ways. They were also very cooperative and kind. True gentlemen,” Aleksandar told TOI.In a world where chess geniuses often arrive wrapped in eccentricity, the Chennai teen has stood apart. Even in moments of extreme pressure, Gukesh maintained an aura of focus. Aleksandar, who observed every move with the precision of a hawk, quickly identified the quality that set Gukesh apart.“Actually, I was really impressed by Gukesh’s constant desire to put up a fight. I think Garry Kasparov or someone had said, ‘In a match between two players, the fighter always wins.’ Gukesh was the better fighter in this tournament. If you look at the games, when Ding was playing with the white pieces, he often avoided a fight. He wanted to be safe – wanted a draw.""But Gukesh wasn’t doing that. He took it to the extreme, avoiding a draw even in positions where he was objectively worse. This characteristic of being a true fighter, not shying away from a challenge, was the main difference that decided the champion,” said Aleksandar, a seasoned Fair Play Officer with extensive experience in events like the Grand Prix and the Candidates Tournament.After the victory, Gukesh praised his 32-year-old opponent, calling him a “true champion” and expressing his admiration. “I would also love to thank my opponent, Ding Liren. He is, in my eyes, a true champion, and we saw that despite a lot of pressure on him, he was able to put up a huge fight. I really admire you,” Gukesh said during the closing ceremony. This graciousness, especially at just 18, added to the impression of a young champion defined not only by his moves but also by his character.Meanwhile, Russian Chess Federation president Andrei Filatov has questioned the way Ding lost to Gukesh, calling for an investigation by FIDE . In response, Aleksandar remarked, “That blunder didn’t come out of nowhere. I mean, this was a long, gruelling game where Gukesh was pressing and pushing, while Ding just wanted the game to end. He was a few moves away, thinking nothing could go wrong, but then he messed up. After almost a month of constant pressure, people crack. That’s normal.”The officer’s role in the tournament was both challenging and rewarding, especially in an era where technology has blurred the lines of fair play. “Players were scanned before entering the play area, passing through different types of scanners to ensure they didn’t have any devices on them or their body. I also ensured no signals entered the glass cube. I really enjoyed it. I knew that maybe I’m becoming part of history here,” Aleksandar explained.",D Gukesh beat Ding Liren to win the World Chess Championship. Fair Play Officer Aleksandar Colovik said the Chennai teen was the better fighter in the tournament. He said the 18-year-old fought every battle as though the board was a stage and he was the lead.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116330003,imgsize-39352,width-400,resizemode-4/116330003.jpg"

'Juniors growing up on white-ball diet hurting West Indies cricket',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/juniors-growing-up-on-white-ball-diet-hurting-west-indies-cricket/articleshow/116352679.cms,"CHENNAI: For quite a while now, the West Indies have not been the force they once had been. They have plummeted to new lows in Test and One-Day cricket and shockingly failed to qualify for the 50-over World Cup in India last year.The drastic drop in performances in the two formats have led to diminishing interest and dwindling attendances for international matches in the Caribbean. Their T20 game – they have won two World Cups in the shortest format – has been their saving grace.Taking into account the challenge of having all the regional boards on the same page, Cricket West Indies (CWI) has had plenty of work to do to get the national team back to the upper echelons. It is making moves slowly but steadily, with one of the key initiatives being the setting up of a fully-functioning CWI Academy in Antigua.The CWI Academy’s head coach Ramesh Subasinghe , who was in Chennai along with assistant coach Rohan Nurse and seven budding players for a two-week camp at the Super Kings Academy, emphasised that Windies are “trying to address the issues by putting up a structure”.“We are a group of countries, all the islands feed players into the system. Some islands have a bit of infrastructure and some do not have anything. It is quite challenging. This is the first time we have had an academy where players from different parts of the Caribbean can come together and train,” Ramesh, a former Sri Lankan first-class cricketer, told TOI.“We are confident that we will have three or four world-class players coming up pretty soon. We have got the young boy Jewel Andrew. He has already played for the West Indies and has a long way to go. He is showing good potential. With the right work ethic and support around him, he could be a world-class player. There are a few apart from him,” Ramesh added.While Ramesh is hopeful of a turnaround in the years to come, he admitted that developing long-format players has been a tough task since many have been “brought up on a white-ball diet”. “There are many small leagues within the Caribbean, a lot of these players also get offers as ‘developmental players’ in leagues around the world. Sometimes, it is challenging to say: ‘Look, you have to play red-ball cricket.’ But the CWI is very serious about red-ball cricket.“The fundamentals and mental resilience could be well tuned in red-ball cricket and they can then be transferred to white-ball cricket. It is only T20 cricket that we have been doing well, we have a lot of work to do in 50-overs cricket as well.”‘Desire to bowl fast is lacking’A team that once boasted of a fearsome pace pack, the West Indies have been struggling to put the fast-bowling pieces together for years now. When asked about it, Ramesh replied: “Our pitches have not been conducive to fast bowling. The desire to bowl fast is lacking, so the bowlers have to do the hard work. To bowl fast and long, you need to be extremely fit. That is something we are working on so that they can bowl for sustained periods. There are some really good talent, but we need to encourage them from a young age.”",The West Indies have plummeted to new lows in Test and One-Day cricket.

She is being taken care of by the medical team and hopefully will be fine soon,"" Mandhana said after India's win, but didn't provide any more details about Harmanpreet's illness or injury.Talking about India's batting effort, Mandhana commended fellow opener Uma Chetry in their 50-run opening stand: ""Uma came in and got us off to a good start, Jemi came in and continued that.""Indian bowlers then restricted the West Indies to 146 for 7, with Titas Sadhu leading the bowling charts with figures of 3 for 37, while Deepti Sharma and Radha Yadav took two wickets each.""Credit to the bowlers with so much dew around. Even after winning we have to go back and review where we can be better, yes, we could have got 200 today,"" Mandhana added.Jemimah, meanwhile, acknowledged the mental challenges of maintaining freshness whilst playing non-stop cricket since competing in Australia.Following a 0-3 defeat in the ODI series in Australia, the Indian team had minimal preparation time after their final match concluded on December 11.Talking about her knock, Rodrigues said: ""Yesterday I had a chat with Smriti about how to pace my innings. My game plan was simple. Singles off every ball. Loose balls are a bonus. Sir had told me to bat through the end, so my plan was to take it five overs at a time.""We could have pushed for another ten runs because we know what we get against the West Indies, because of Dottin and even Joseph. I am proud of the way we bowled with the dew.""The second T20I will be played on Tuesday.",India beat West Indies by 49 runs in the first women's T20I in Navi Mumbai.

Why D Gukesh's crown is super special for Indian chess,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/chess/why-d-gukeshs-crown-is-super-special-for-indian-chess/articleshow/116352964.cms,"D Gukesh (Image credit: FIDE)

D Gukesh has indicated in no uncertain terms that he considers the pressure of the World Championship chess match as a privilege. And yes, if you win the crown, the privilege that you enjoy is tremendous. Like a huge majority of past champions, Gukesh is assured to play another World title match in 2026 — the reigning champion gets a direct seeding to that coveted company of two players battling it out.He dethroned Ding Liren in Singapore on Thursday. The champions from most other sports have to start from scratch to defend their crown as challenge rounds are abolished.Furthermore, many individual sports — like boxing, shooting, wrestling, swimming, archery, table tennis, badminton, weightlifting, among others — have different champions in different sections. Not ONE world champion.Truly professional sports like tennis and golf don’t have world championships. Plus some of these sports don’t allow two entries from one country in major competitions. But the world championship match between compatriots is possible in the 64-square game. China’s Ju Wenjun had defeated contrywoman Lei Tingjie for the women’s world chess title last year.V Anand became the undisputed 15th World Matchplay chess champion in Oct 2008. The next Fide rating list, released in Jan 2009, had only two Indians in the top 25 — Anand and K Sasikiran. Now there are six Indians in the top-26 including three in top-10.Gukesh may well play his next title match against a fellow Indian with Arjun Erigaisi and R Praggnanandhaa being among the contenders. And even if any Indian doesn’t become the challenger in 2026, Gukesh (or any other Indian) being a part of the 2028 Championship match is quite high. Now, with six more India players in the world rankings from No. 27 to 100, and this figure is expected to rise, the country is almost assured of serious world title contenders till 2030. This is Gukesh’s gift scratch card toIndian chess . It is up to the custodians of the game (AICF, state and district associations) to make the most of it.The players have done their bit. They have capitalised on the Covid pandemic that opened online forums for elite players; and timely intervention of V Anand helped in grooming them into world-beaters. Destiny has been ironically cruel to Anand. Imagine not getting a chance to play the real World Championship match for 13 years after losing to Garry Kasparov at World Trade Center in New York in 1995. And that too when he was clearly among the top-two players in the world. But destiny has its way of offsetting things. It has accelerated the path of progress for Anand’s ‘children’. Without the platform and team provided by Anand, this surge was nigh impossible.Gukesh won his maiden world title in this first Candidates cycle. Anand had to wait for 17 years after playing Alexeri Dreev in Chennai in 1991, and capped it by dethroning Vladmir Kramnik in Bonn in 2008. If Gukesh had lost in tiebreaks, questions would have been asked on the missed chances and whether it was a right decision to play obscure lines and play somewhat uncharacteristic chess for the large part of the match.",D Gukesh dethroned Ding Liren in Singapore on Thursday.

"The Oval, Ahmedabad, Adelaide, Brisbane: Travis Head continues to leave India clueless",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-australia/the-oval-ahmedabad-adelaide-brisbane-travis-head-continues-to-leave-india-clueless/articleshow/116339134.cms,"Travis Head (Photo Source: X)

When Travis Head made the walk to the middle, he was oozing confidence. And why wouldn't he be? He was fresh from a hundred in the pink-ball Test and was batting with a very high degree of domination. The hosts' innings was delicately placed at 75/3 in 33.2 overs and Head joined Steve Smith who was looking very itchy.Getting Head at the other end was just what Smith would have wanted at that stage because the game was soon going to enter the passage of play where India have struggled this series.With the oldish Kookaburra, the visitors have not only found it difficult to make any inroads but also struggled to contain the flow of runs. And Rohit Sharma & Co. now had to deal with their 'nemesis', who was in terrific touch.The match situation was very much in India's control when Head walked out but what happened next was a rerun of what we have seen plenty of times in the past.In a matter of 10-12 overs, majority of which were bowled by Jasprit Bumrah , Head got his eye in and started feasting on anything in his radar. The Indian bowlers continued to do him another favour as their lack of execution and proper planning was on display during the post-Lunch session.Yet again, he wasn't peppered with chin music early on and was given a very warm reception by the Indian attack. Rohit Sharma shuffled things up in the attack but clear lack of sustained pressure from both ends allowed Head to get well-set when the Indian captain introduced Ravindra Jadeja in the 53rd over. Mohammed Siraj was handed over the responsibility from the other end and it was during this period where Head moved to domination mode and continued to pile on the pressure in free-flowing fashion.The field was now spread out, easy singles were there for the taking and the bowlers clearly lacked fuel in the tank. Not just the bowlers but even Rohit wore a very helpless look as the visiting camp didn't seem to have any way of keeping a known threat under check.It wasn't the first time Head was doing what he did. But what is more frustrating is the fact that as a group, India are yet to crack the code!Do they have answers when they run into him again? Doesn't look like it.At the end of day's play, India bowling coach Morne Morkel said they had the plans figured out for Head but it was the lack of execution between Over No. 50-80 which cost them dearly and let the game slip away from a very firm grip.""Yes we've got the game plans, but are we executing those game plans with a softer ball from both ends, that's something we need to discuss and get better at,"" said Morkel.India clearly didn't learn their lesson after what happened in the Adelaide Test and if no drastic changes are made to the approach against the left-hander, more runs and tons are in store. He has already scored 392 runs in the four innings and his impact can be assessed from the next best contributor from the Australian line-up: Alex Carey. The wicketkeeper-batter has just one third of Head's runs. More than Head's runs, it's the strike rate - nearly 95 - at which he has been scoring which has hurt India more.As Steve Smith explained in the press-conference, the change in the Kookaburra ball is suiting Head's style of play as his numbers and strike rate have drastically shot up since it was changed back in 2021. Unlike the previous version, this ball doesn't lose its hardness even after getting old and ""bounces off the bat a lot harder"".""I think the ball stays hard. So if you get through that period and, you know, you've got some guys like Travis and Marshy and Alex coming in, the ball still bounces off the bat a lot harder than it used to. You know, I think previously you get to those positions where the ball gets a bit softer. You'll see catches in front of the wicket and things like that. And it'd be a bit more difficult to score. But, yeah, I think theball's definitely staying harder,"" explains Smith.In Head's case, however, it seems to be flying off his blade and India seems to have no means to clip its wings.",Travis Head has scored 392 runs in the four innings so far. India bowling coach Morne Morkel said they had the plans figured out for Head but it was the lack of execution between Over No. 50-80 which cost them dearly.

NEW DELHI: India's bowling coach Morne Morkel acknowledged on Sunday that their bowlers struggled to implement strategies against Australian batter Travis Head 's century. He emphasised the need for improvement, particularly during the crucial period between overs 50 and 80 with the older ball.Head and Steve Smith 's partnership proved devastating as they accumulated 171 runs in 31 overs during the final session of day two at the Brisbane Test , following a wicketless afternoon session.The Australian team finished strongly at 405 for seven.""First of all, we can say he's (Head) in pretty good form. But I think for us with the ball, if you look at it from overs 50 to 80, even in the last game, is where we fall short, leaking (runs) a little bit. So, that's one area I think we need to get better at,"" said Morkel in the post-day press conference.The bowling coach noted that despite securing three morning wickets, the Indian bowlers lost their grip on the match.""First up with the ball this morning, we were pretty good, at 3 for 70, but took nothing away from two world-class players, Smith we know, he's a guy who also can bat long and score runs. They (Smith and Head) put a partnership there and put us under pressure with a softer ball.""It's definitely an area that we need to focus on, maybe deeper in the innings. Yes, we've got the game plans, but are we executing those game plans with a softer ball from both ends? That's something we need to get better at,"" he continued.Discussing the strategy for Head, which proved unsuccessful, the former South African bowler explained their approach.""Our plan going into this game was to bowl a little bit more over the wicket, a straighter line. We felt he played it quite nicely in Adelaide when we came around (the wicket). The margins to him are just so small and like I said, once he's in, what is the best way for the team and for you (is) to maybe slow down the scoring rate because you know he's going to be aggressive.""The best way (of controlling Head) is bringing a little bit of control into the game and like I said, from over 50 with that softer ball, that's where we're leaking (runs). When Head comes on straight, the pitch kind of feels to (be favourable) a side,"" he added.""I'm not taking anything away from that, but it is a venue where getting used to bowling the right length and trusting that, it does take a bit of time.""While praising Jasprit Bumrah 's five-wicket performance, Morkel defended Mohammed Siraj and Akash Deep's contributions.""I thought Akash did really well, he bowled his heart out, same for Siraj. Siraj struggled, cramped, early on in the day, so, for him to still run in, close and bowl short balls and bowl that new ball spell for me, was great.""""Of course, you need somebody to back him (Bumrah) up, but I honestly can't fault the effort from the other seamers today.""Akash asked good questions with the new ball up front, asked good questions with the older ball and on another day could have easily picked up three wickets, but that's the nature of this game,"" he concluded.Morkel expressed support for Ravindra Jadeja , who was selected in place of R Ashwin for this Test match, despite his challenging performance.At the 'Gabba', Jadeja bowled 16 overs without taking any wickets while conceding 76 runs.""Jaddu, coming into this match didn't haven't had a lot of game time, but he's also a guy who has taken a lot of Test wickets. He's a very experienced player and we just felt we wanted to bring in the left-arm option as something different, you know, sitting with Rohit.""""Jaddu is a guy that can also offer us a lot with the bat, unfortunately, today if you know it wasn't his day as a spinner. But, yeah, Jaddu for me is a world-class player and you know he'll work it out,"" he added.Regarding the decision to bowl first after winning the toss, Morkel explained their strategy was based on their confidence in containing the Australian batting lineup.""I just thought, looking at the surface, if we can get the ball in the right area we can take wickets. I thought controlling the run-rate for a big part of the game and staying patient was key and if we could have added one or two wickets, winning the toss and bowling first would have worked.""But unfortunately we are on the other side of it and we just need to take the positives out of it. So, when we do get that opportunity tomorrow it's about getting through the new ball because I honestly feel like it's a bit of a new ball surface.""For us it's important now to put today aside and get our minds switched on and stay strong for a big batting innings,"" he added",India's bowling coach Morne Morkel admits bowlers struggled to implement strategies against Australian batter Travis Head's century.

It was a frustrating morning of waiting in Brisbane as heavy downpour allowed very little cricket on the opening day of the third India-Australia Test in Brisbane. Only 13.2 overs were bowled and the fans got their umbrellas out, put the raincoats on but held on to their beer and enjoyed their Saturday morning, even if it was without any cricket.With the players rushing indoors, the gentleman on the live grill was aggressively dishing out the sausages to the thousands who had come for a big fat party!Amid all this, former Australia cricketer Matthew Hayden 's daughter was casually strolling in the corridor with very little cricket a dampener for her too. The 22-year-old, however, was still up for a chat on cricket and touched upon her love for India, the food and the spices.""I love India. I always heard a lot about India growing up from my dad, he still brings spices home. So I'd always be trying Indian food. I love a dal curry and a roti. Love your roti. Dad would always bring India home to us. So people would always say to me, you know, 'did you struggle at first with Indian food?'

It took her half a second to name Pant has her favourite cricketer from this Indian team and it was the youngster's return from the horrific car crash which continues to be an inspiration.""I think his comeback story has been sensational. We saw him go as the most expensive player in IPL history just recently. And yeah, we all saw the vision of the accident, and for him to come back and still start and even make this incredible team is just credit to him. The hard work, determination, mentally that would have been really tough to come back from.

He's definitely an inspiring player,"" says Grace.Pant is definitely a crowd favourite in this part of the world but the same can't be said about Mohammed Siraj. The seamer was constantly booed when he stood on top of his run-up today and even while the series has been a bit low-key on the onfield drama, the Travis Head-Siraj episode definitely injected some fire. Has the IPL, like the rain today, dampened the intensity between these two sides as compared to the years gone by?""I think because the IPL is around, these players are playing together more often. They're intertwining all the time. But I think when you are stepping onto the field playing for your country, none of that matters, and it always has been the case you want to win for your country,"" said Grace and added that her father himself was a fierce competitor on the field but completely different off it.""My dad is a big teddy bear giant.

DOTTIN BACK WITH GG

BENGALURU: After an underwhelming inaugural Women’s Premier League season with UP Warriorz, Simran Shaikh watched the previous edition of the competition as a spectator. Going unsold in last season’s auction, the 22-year-old all-rounder went back to the drawing board and delivered for Mumbai in the domestic season. She reaped the rewards to become the most expensive buy at the mini auction held here on Sunday.With a base price of Rs 10 lakh, Simran spurred a bidding war between Gujarat Giants and Delhi Capitals, before the former put out the winning bid of Rs 1.9 crore.With just 19 slots to be filled from 124 players, the auction was probably one of the quickest and wrapped up in under two hours, but not before uncapped Indian talent hit pay dirt.Tamil Nadu’s rising star G Kamalini, one among four who surpassed the crore mark on the day, was another sought-after youngster, snapped up by Mumbai Indians, who beat persistent Delhi Capitals, with a Rs. 1.6 crore bid.The all-rounder, a product of the CSK Academy, made a statement of intent in the BCCI Women’s U-19 T20 Trophy recently. The 16-year-old big hitter compiled 311 runs from eight matches to help Tamil Nadu annex the title. Currently wearing the India colours at the U-19 Asia Cup in Malaysia, the left-handed batter was the 'Player of the Match' on Sunday for her unbeaten 29-ball 44 against Pakistan.Although Delhi Capitals had a rather quiet day, they increased the bidding amount for most of the big buys. Among them was Uttarakhand spinner Prema Rawat, who started at a base price of Rs 10 lakh and was offered the winning bid of Rs 1.20 crore by defending champions Royal Challengers Bengaluru. RCB added the leg spinner to their stable in addition to Asha Sobhana.The 23-year-old Prema garnered attention during the Uttarakhand Premier League. Turning out for Mussoorie Thunders, she came good with both the ball and the bat.Giants, who went into the auction with the maximum purse of Rs 4.4 crore, also accounted for the second highest bid. West Indies’ Deandra Dottin, who was controversially released by the Giants days before the inaugural edition, returned to the franchise for Rs 1.70 crore.The first player to go under the hammer, the 33-year-old Dottin was among the three players with the Rs 50 lakh base price.Among the players who surprisingly went unsold were Sneh Rana, England skipper Heather Knight, her compatriot Lauren Bell and Australian Laura Harris.","Simran Shaikh was the most expensive buy at the mini auction held here on Sunday.

India bowling coach Morne Morkel explains why India chose to bowl first in Brisbane

Steve Smith: 'I had a great seat in the house to watch Travis Head bat'

BRISBANE: Sunday at the Gabba was mainly a rerun of the Travis Head Experience, this time in extended format.By Head’s side stood the formidable Steve Smith , who battled inner demons to rediscover his poise, technique and, eventually, fluency. Both scored centuries — Head his ninth and third against India, Smith his 33rd — to completely overwhelm India’s Jasprit Bumrah-led bowling attack.In the form of his life, the left-handed Head, Australia’s middle-order enforcer, reprised India’s Adelaide nightmare with his second consecutive ton. He did all this while looking like he was coasting on Queensland’s Bruce Highway, pressing the pedal to the metal while reclining in a plush leather seat.Head’s innings was batting magnificence made to look easy. He continued from where he left off in Adelaide, conjuring up a 152 off 160 balls (18x4) and adding 241 runs off 302 balls for the fourth wicket with Smith (101 off 190b; 12x4).By the end of it all, India looked tired, dispirited and bereft of ideas, but their task on the field is not over yet. Stumps were taken with the Aussie tail still wagging at 405/7 and Alex Carey batting on a well-made 45.Only Bumrah the Magnificent (5/72 off 25 overs) stood tall with his 12th five wicket haul from just 43 Tests. He started off by disrupting the Aussie openers’ plans of blunting the sheen on the Kookaburra, then returned with the second new ball to limit the considerable damage by getting rid of Smith, Head and Mitchell Marsh.Bumrah lacked any real support, however, in spite of Akash Deep looking penetrative in patches and earning praise from Steve Smith. When the ball got old, conditions eased and the pitch seemed sterile, India’s lack of bowling depth stood exposed.Head and Smith’s partnership brought back memories of the 285-run stand between the two in the World Test Championship final against India at the Oval in June 2023, and now, like then, they came in with the side in trouble after Marnus Labuschagne’s dismissal. At the Oval, Australia were 76/3, on Sunday here they were 75/3.The early damage was thanks to the genius of Bumrah, who made the still new ball his ally and rectified some errors from the first day. This time he found the fuller length straightaway, the five to eight metre mark, drawing Usman Khawaja forward and regularly beating the bat, both off the inside and outside edge. Bowling around the wicket, he found success in just his second over, getting Khawaja to prod at one. The batter was stuck in his crease and edged to the ’keeper.The compact McSweeney, who kept leaving balls at length on the first day and evaded facing Bumrah, was dislodged with a back-of-a-length ball that came in with the angle and straightened after pitching, forcing the batter to play and edge to Kohli at second slip. Meanwhile, Labuschagne wafted at an innocuous Nitish Reddy delivery and paid the price.That set the stage for the Travis Head special. By this stage Steve Smith was still his fidgety, scratchy self, still looking for his first century in 25 innings. A return to an altered, exaggerated back-and-across trigger movement seemed to help. Smith shouldered arms to a Siraj nip-backer and was saved by the ‘umpire’s call’. Akash Deep foxed him time and again, but Smith survived. Head’s entry ensured India’s full attention and Smith could slip “under the radar,” as he said later.India immediately went on the defensive to Head, with a deep point, square leg hanging back, a deep gully, mid-on and mid-off back, but it’s impossible really to cut off Head’s scoring areas. Luck was with him too, and he survived some early jitters. After lunch, with the ball softer at 43 overs old, Head got into his act, racing to his half-century and taking a special liking to Ravindra Jadeja and Mohammed Siraj.India’s attempts to bowl short to him didn’t come off, and Head kept pulling or ramping those deliveries over the slip cordon. He unsettled Jadeja’s lengths and India’s fielders followed the ball. Plugging every new gap created large gaps to exploit.Australia scored 130 in 27 overs between lunch and tea (overs 43-70) and 63 in the first 10 overs after tea. Head had taken the game away from an increasingly nervy India. Captain Rohit Sharma even dropped Head on 112, but the second new ball and a burst of wickets from, who else but Bumrah, stopped the rampage.It’s now clear Head’s repeated onslaughts have left the “scar” which captain Rohit denied after the Adelaide loss. “He’s in pretty good form, playing back to-back innings in that fashion, we can only give him a lot of credit,” India’s bowling coach Morne Morkel said. “Our plan was to bowl a little more over the wicket, bowl a straighter line. We felt he played it quite nicely in Adelaide when we came around the wicket. We were lucky there was a little bit of bounce, but the margin to him is just so thin.”A delighted Smith said he had the “best seat in the house to watch Travis Head go about his business”. “He’s doing it consistently at the moment, which is great. It was nice to get a partnership with him because the scoreboard moves extremely fast.”India are now behind in this game, and seeing the conditions the decision to bowl first may come back to haunt them.",Travis Head and Steve Smith both score centuries against India. Head scores 152 off 160 balls (18x4) and adds 241 runs for the fourth wicket. Smith scores 101 off 190b; 12x4. Jasprit Bumrah takes five wicket haul of 5/72.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116350980,imgsize-37170,width-400,resizemode-4/116350980.jpg"

India bowling coach Morne Morkel explains why India chose to bowl first in Brisbane

BRISBANE: The ‘Gabbatoir’ has lived up to its name. India find themselves pinned down in the third Test. Till now, the focus has been on the team’s faltering batting unit and lead pacer Jasprit Bumrah ’s absolute mastery of conditions and clever reading of batsmen. Here on Day Two, when the other bowlers were at times required to deliver, another area of concern was highlighted: India’s inability to execute their plans with the older Kookaburra ball in good batting conditions.The bowling attack on this tour wears a Jekyll-and-Hyde look — menacing when Bumrah is bowling, sheepish when he is given a break. This allowed Travis Head, whose previous three outings at the Gabba had yielded ducks, and Steve Smith to cash in between lunch and tea and for a while after, until the second new ball became available.Bumrah then again rose to the occasion, but he is a rare breed of bowler. The team management will be aware such overreliance may lead to workload issues on this long tour, putting the focus on the others who need to step up. Captain Rohit Sharma had spoken about the need for the other pacers to “rise to the challenge” after the Adelaide loss, and Sunday showed why such concern was warranted.India’s decision to replace Harshit Rana with Akash Deep seemed on the money, with the relatively inexperienced pacer beating Smith with movement and steep bounce even with the older ball. He was luckless, however, while Siraj was unidimensional and also battled cramps, according to bowling coach Morne Morkel The fourth seamer, Nitish Reddy, and the surprise lone spin selection Ravindra Jadeja were serious weak links, bowling 29 overs for 141 runs and one wicket. Importantly, between lunch and tea Australia scored at 4.8 per over. It is starting with this period, from after the 40 till the 80th over, that India struggled with the new, redesigned Kookaburra red ball.“If you look at it from overs 50-80 (when the second new ball is due), even in the last game we fell short, leaking runs a little bit. Yes, we’ve got the game plans, but are we executing those plans with a softer ball from both ends? That’s something we need to get better at,” Morkel said.“I thought Akash did really well. He bowled his heart out, same for Siraj. Siraj struggled, cramped, early on in the day, so, for him to still run in and bowl short balls, and bowl that new ball spell was great,” he added.“Of course, you need somebody to back Bumrah up, but I honestly can’t fault the effort from the other seamers today. Akash asked good questions with the new ball up front, asked good questions with the older ball and on another day could have easily picked up three wickets. That’s the nature of this game,” Morkel said.Steve Smith, who seemed stuck in a rut for more than a year until he rediscovered some semblance of form with a fine century on Sunday, too praised Akash Deep. “Akash bowled really nicely, particularly that first spell. There was significant movement. He bowled a really nice length, he’s a nice bowler. It was the first time I’ve actually faced him. He’s got some skill for sure. They (India’s bowlers) toiled hard all day,” he said.Smith also explained why the changed Kookaburra ball has necessitated a shift in gameplans. “Since 2021 when they changed the Kookaburra ball (adding an extra layer of lacquer and a more pronounced seam), batting has become very difficult (in Australia). The first 35 overs are very challenging, with significant movement,” he said.“The ball stays hard. So, if you get through that period, you’ve got guys like Travis Head and Mitch Marsh who can come in when the ball still bounces off the bat a little harder. Earlier, they would come in when the ball gets a bit softer, so you’ll see catches in front of the wicket and things like that, and it’d be a bit more difficult to score. The last three years, batting averages have come down, bowling aver ages have come down. Earlier you would see 400-500 being scored. Now if you put a ‘three’ in front of it, it’s okay.”Australia have already worked the ball out and altered their batting plans accordingly. The openers will blunt the new Kookaburra and play in sedate fashion. Once the 35-40 over mark is met, the middle-order bashers can take over. India were caught napping with the ball on Sunday. Now, the bowlers have their work cut out for the rest of this game, and the series.",India bowling coach Morne Morkel explains why India chose to bowl first in Brisbane.

NAVI MUMBAI: Left to lick their wounds after a 3-0 shellacking by the Aussies on the latter’s home turf recently, the Indian women’s cricket team has given their supporters something to cheer. In the process, Hamanpreet Kaur & Co would’ve also regained some of their confidence, which would’ve been shattered after the drubbing in Australia.Shrugging off jet lag after playing an ODI series which ended in Perth only on Wednesday, India, egged on by a strong 29,000 holiday crowd at the DY Patil Stadium here on Sunday night, scored a convincing 49-run victory over a lacklustre West Indies, who hardly played like the 2024 Women’s T20 World Cup semifinalists, in the opening WT20I here. The second match of the three-game series will be played on Tuesday at the same venue.Powered by Jemimah Rodrigues ’ sublime 35-ball 73, which included nine-sweetly timed fours and two well-struck sixes, and vice-captain Smriti Mandhana ’s 54 (33b, 7x4, 2x6) and the duo’s blazing 81-run partnership in just 44 balls for the second wicket, India posted a massive 195 for four after the hosts were asked to bat first.It is India’s highest-ever T20I total against the West Indies (previous best was 185/4 in November 2019 at Gros Islet) and their third-highest in this format overall.It was then then the turn of the bowlers to come to the party, with seamer Titas Sadhu (3-37 in four overs), and spinners Deepti Sharma (2-21 in four overs) and Radha Yadav (2-28 in four overs) restricting West Indies to 146 for seven in 20 overs.For a brief while, the Caribbeans gave India a scare when veteran allrounder Deandra Dottin (52, 28b, 4x4, 3x6), who was bought by the Gujarat Giants for Rs 1.7 cr by the Gujarat Giants on Sunday in the WPL mini-auction, and opener Qiana Joseph (49, 33b, 5x4, 3x6) were at the crease. India had the game in the bag when Dottin, who was dropped twice, was finally caught by Radha Yadav at long on off Sadhu in the 15th over.The hosts were also boosted by a brilliant catch by Minnu Mani, who ran diagonally from mid-on and then dived full length to pull a stunner to send back West Indies’ skipper Hayley Mathews (1) off Sadhu in the second over.Rodrigues has hardly done justice to her immense potential in WT20Is till now. However, perhaps fired up by the home crowd, the Mumbaikar showed why the national selectors have been so patient with her and what fantastic ability she possesses when in full flow. Coming out all guns blazing on a typical batting paradise here, the India No 3 feasted on the erratic West Indies’ bowlers.The 24-year-old’s 12th in WT20Is- will certainly rank amongst the batter’s best innings in this format, even though the West Indies attack was docile, in fact mediocre. By the 11th over, the clueless-looking visitors had used up seven bowlers, and eventually eight had a go with the ball.However, apart from off-spinner Karishma Ramharack (2 for 18 in four overs), the others were just cannon fodder for Rodrigues and the other Indian batters. To make it worse for them, the West Indians bowled 10 wides and grassed four catches too.The stage for India’s massive total was set by Mandhana (she scored her 28th WT20I fifty, sixth this year) and Uma Chetry (24, 26b, 4x4) in a 50-run partnership in 39 balls. Preferred over the explosive Shafali Verma, Chetry showed promise while stroking a few delightful fours on the off-side. Thereafter, it was the 'Rodrigues show' all the way, with Mandhana, coming off a superb century (105) in the final WODI against Australia at Perth on Wednesday, just looking to enjoy herself, as the duo pulverised the West Indian bowlers.Rodrigues’ relentless onslaught had a ‘touch of 360 degree’ -there were shots all around the ground including a few behind the wicket. Having mastered the sweep shot by now, she swept and reverse swept the West Indies’ spinners in dominating fashion, but what was also impressive was her power-hitting-there was a hooked six off medium-pacer Shamilia Connell and a six over long-off off veteran allrounder Deandra Dottin in the 19th over. Just a ball earlier, she had showcased her ability to improvise brilliantly, scooping Dottin for four in the fine-leg region.The finishing touches to India’s innings were provided by Richa Ghosh (20, 14b, 2x4, 1x6). Ghosh’s cameo ended when Dottin pouched a superb catch at deep mid-wicket off Mandy Mangru in the 17th over.",India beat West Indies by 49 runs in opening WT20I at DY Patil Stadium. Smriti Mandhana and Jemimah Rodrigues top scored with 54 runs each. Hosts posted 195-4 after being asked to bat first.

Premier League leaders Liverpool salvaged a 2-2 draw at home to Fulham despite trailing twice and having Andy Robertson sent off after 17 minutes on Saturday as chasing Arsenal were left to rue being held to 0-0 stalemate at home to Everton.On what turned out to be a good day for second-placed Chelsea, who face Brentford on Sunday, Liverpool would have been far happier with their draw than title rivals Arsenal.Diogo Jota scored an 86th minute equaliser at Anfield as Arne Slot's side avoided a second league defeat of the season.They have 36 points from 15 games, five more than Chelsea, while Arsenal's failure to score at home for the first time this season left them still six points off the pace having played one game more than the two sides above them.Nottingham Forest moved above champions Manchester City into fourth place as late goals by Nikola Milenkovic and Anthony Elanga saw them hit back to beat visiting Aston Villa 2-1.Newcastle United returned to form in emphatic style as they thrashed Leicester City 4-0 with Jacob Murphy scoring twice.At the bottom, the pressure increased on Wolverhampton Wanderers manager Gary O'Neil as his side lost 2-1 at home to fellow strugglers Ipswich Town.Jack Taylor scored a last-gasp winner for 18th-placed Ipswich who are now only one point from the safety zone. Wolves, in 19th, have now lost four league games in succession.There are good draws and bad draws and Liverpool's will definitely feel like the former as they emerged from a difficult afternoon with minimal damage at Anfield.""A great comeback is very positive. It's disappointing having 10 men but we showed fight, kept trying to create chances. Could have been more but we take the point and move on,"" Liverpool skipper Virgil van Dijk said.""Stay calm. It's easier to say than do it. It was always going to be tough against them.""Liverpool got off to the worst possible start as Fulham took the lead in 11th minute through Andreas Pereira's stretching volley and then left back Robertson was dismissed, after a long VAR check, for denying Harry Wilson a goalscoring opportunity.Cody Gakpo's diving header from a Mohamed Salah cross brought Liverpool level straight after halftime and they were chasing the win when Rodrigo Muniz stunned the hosts to put Fulham back in front after 76 minutes.However, Jota came off the bench in the 79th minute for his first appearance since October because of injury and slotted past goalkeeper Bernd Leno in the 86th to salvage a point.ARSENAL FRUSTRATEDArsenal failed to score at home for the first time since April as they could not find a way through a blue Everton barricade at The Emirates.Despite overwhelming pressure they lacked attacking spark and even when they did get a sight of goal England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford proved unflappable, making great saves from Bukayo Sako, Martin Odegaard and Gabriel Martinelli.Everton barely ventured forward but celebrated a gritty point which left them in 15th place with 15 points.""Very disappointing not to win the game. We fully deserved to win the game,"" Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said.""We conceded no shots. We dominated play. When we generated big chances we didn't score a goal.""Forest have now won six of their last nine league games after showing great persistence to overturn a deficit against Villa at a raucous City Ground.Jhon Duran's header had looked like sending Villa fourth, especially when Forest's in-form striker Chris Wood had a late leveller wiped out for offside after a long VAR check.But Milenkovic headed in a cross by Morgan Gibbs-White in the 87th minute before substitute Elanga slotted home his first goal of the season to claim all three points.Ipswich secured only their second win of the season as substitute Taylor struck in the 94th minute at Molineux.An unfortunate own goal by Matt Doherty gave Ipswich an early lead but Wolves were rewarded for a positive response when Brazilian forward Matheus Cunha, assisted by Goncalo Guedes, finished past keeper Arijanet Muric.Newcastle's first win in five league games lifted them to 11th with 23 points, only four points behind fourth-placed Manchester City who host Manchester United on Sunday.",Premier League leaders Liverpool salvaged a 2-2 draw at home to Fulham despite trailing twice and having Andy Robertson sent off.

Emiliano Martinez , Aston Villa 's goalkeeper, made a remarkable save during their match against Nottingham Forest in the Premier League on Saturday. Albeit, the game ended in a 2-1 loss for Aston Villa.In the 60th minute, Nicolas Dominguez's header seemed destined for the net. Martinez, slightly off his line, extended his left hand backward. He managed to deflect the ball downward and scoop it away from the goal line in one fluid motion.“World class,” was how the Premier League described the save.The BBC considered it potentially ""one of the all-time great Premier League saves.”“I can’t think of a better Premier League save,” said former England and Liverpool midfielder Jamie Redknapp, who was working the game for British broadcaster Sky Sports. “It’s almost like a magician with his sleight of hand.”Jhon Duran scored for Aston Villa shortly after, giving them a temporary lead. This goal came just three minutes after Martinez's incredible save.Nottingham Forest responded with two late goals, securing a 2-1 victory. Both goals were scored after the 87th minute.Martinez has received recognition for his goalkeeping prowess.
