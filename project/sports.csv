Olympics: Will India go past historic Tokyo medal haul in Paris?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/olympics-will-india-go-past-historic-tokyo-medal-haul-in-paris/articleshow/112007716.cms,"WILL NUMBER SEVEN BE BREACHED?

THE CHIEF MEDAL CONTENDERS

STRONG HOPES

DON'T RULE THEM OUT

(With PTI inputs)

As the Olympic Games commence in Paris on Friday, the 117 Indian athletes participating in the event find themselves in diverse situations. While a few carry the weight of immense expectations on their shoulders, others are determined to deliver unexpected triumphs. Meanwhile, some seasoned competitors are focused on concluding their illustrious careers on a high note.The nation anticipates an improved performance compared to the previous edition of the Games.India's haul of seven medals from Tokyo has raised hopes for a double-digit tally this time around.Apart from the wrestlers, who have endured a tumultuous lead-up to the event, athletes across all disciplines have expressed satisfaction with their preparations. The meticulous planning, which included overseas training stints and access to top-notch facilities, has been instrumental in honing their skills.However, the lingering question remains: will the dedication, well-crafted strategies, and unwavering support from the nation translate into a shower of medals for India? Only time will tell as the world's greatest sporting spectacle unfolds in the French capital.Matching the impressive tally of seven medals from the Tokyo Olympics will be an arduous challenge for India at the upcoming Games, considering that apart from the current Olympic champion Neeraj Chopra , few athletes are considered top contenders in their respective events.The majority of the 117-member Indian contingent comes from three sports: athletics (29), shooting (21), and hockey (19). Among these 69 athletes, 40 are making their Olympic debut.Debutants can also be found in other sports, such as tennis player N Sriram Balaji and wrestler Reetika Hooda. Although they are not entirely inexperienced, India's campaign will largely be driven by athletes who are competing on such a grand stage for the first time.Simultaneously, there are seasoned athletes who are expected to elevate their performance accordingly.For PV Sindhu, a two-time Olympic medallist in badminton; tennis icon Rohan Bopanna; legendary table tennis player Sharath Kamal and hockey goalkeeper PR Sreejesh, this will undoubtedly be their final Olympic appearance.The hockey team's form leading up to the Games has been inconsistent, while the boxers and wrestlers have had limited real competition experience. Similarly, the shooters have delivered mixed results in the lead-up to the Olympics.The recent performances of Indian track and field athletes, particularly Avinash Sable, have been impressive. However, when compared to their international counterparts, their achievements may not be sufficient to place them as strong contenders for medals.Sable, a steeplechaser, has consistently improved his own national record, with his best time currently standing at 8:09.94. Despite his remarkable progress, there are seven international athletes who have recorded faster times leading up to the Olympic Games.Considering the fierce competition, reaching the finals alone would be regarded as a significant accomplishment.India's aspirations for Olympic glory rest heavily on the shoulders of Neeraj, the javelin sensation, despite lingering concerns about his adductor niggle. Alongside him, the dynamic badminton pair of Chirag Shetty and Satwiksairaj Rankireddy, who have been in scintillating form, are also expected to make a significant impact.Although the elusive 90m mark has remained beyond Neeraj's grasp from Tokyo to Paris, the ace javelin thrower has consistently delivered performances that have been just enough to secure global titles. When it matters most, on the grandest stages of competition, Neeraj has outshone his highly regarded rivals.If he can maintain his fitness, the Panipat-born athlete has a genuine opportunity to etch his name in India's sporting annals by becoming only the third athlete to clinch back-to-back Olympic medals.Only Sindhu (2016 Rio and 2012 Tokyo) and wrestler Sushil Kumar (2008 Beijing, 2012 London) have managed to win two consecutive medals.Satwik and Chirag have blossomed into one of India's most formidable men's doubles teams in badminton, and they are widely regarded as strong contenders for a podium finish. Their exceptional skills and unwavering determination have positioned them as serious medal hopefuls.As for Sindhu, despite not being in peak form and facing a challenging draw, her wealth of experience could prove invaluable if she can navigate through the initial rounds. Her past successes and mental fortitude could propel her into the medal rounds once again.The Indian men's hockey team's recent performance has been erratic. During their tour of Australia, they suffered defeats in all five matches, following an inconsistent showing in the Pro League. This contrasts sharply with their triumphant campaign at the Asian Games in Hangzhou, where they secured the championship title.The team continues to grapple with issues related to converting penalty corners and sustaining their intensity throughout the duration of a match.To compound their challenges, India finds itself in a formidable group alongside powerhouses such as Australia and Belgium, besides Argentina, New Zealand and Ireland. In order to advance to the top four from this pool, the team cannot afford any missteps or lapses in performance.The Indian shooting team, consisting of 21 members, has quietly prepared for the upcoming event, marking their largest contingent ever. This contrasts with the previous Games in London and Tokyo, where rising stars like Manu Bhaker and Saurabh Chaudhary had generated significant medal expectations due to their outstanding performances leading up to the competitions. However, they failed to live up to the hype.Similarly, Divyansh Panwar and Elavenil Valarivan were once regarded as future superstars, but they too have not met expectations. Despite the lack of attention on the shooters this time around, Sift Kaur Samra (50m three position), Sandeep Singh (10m air rifle), and Aishwary Pratap Singh Tomar (men's 50m rifle) possess the potential to break the 12-year medal drought for India in shooting.The last Indian shooter to secure a medal was Gagan Narang, who clinched the bronze in the 10m air rifle event at the 2012 London Games. Narang is serving as India's Chef de Mission for the Paris Games.The last four Olympic Games have seen India secure a medal in wrestling. Expectations were high for the Paris Games, with hopes of winning four to five medals, but a protest against the Wrestling Federation of India brought the sport to a halt.National camps and competitions were suspended for an extended period. The qualified wrestlers have been training independently at various centers within India and overseas.While the fitness levels of many wrestlers remain uncertain, Anshu Malik, Antim Panghal and Aman Sehrawat are regarded as India's top prospects heading into the Games. Reetika Hooda, the reigning U-23 world champion, could emerge as a surprise contender, while Vinesh Phogat cannot be overlooked.The table tennis players and archers have secured their spots in the upcoming Games based on their rankings. While the TT players' qualification is a significant accomplishment, the archers' performance leaves room for doubt.In the past, the archers have made grand promises but failed to live up to expectations. The recent incident involving their coach being refused accreditation for the Games has cast a shadow over their campaign from the very beginning.Mirabai Chanu, the weightlifter who won silver at the Tokyo Games, has been grappling with injuries and inconsistent form recently, which may have affected her mental preparedness. There are doubts about whether she can replicate her previous success.The experienced boxer Nikhat Zareen and her teammate Nishant Dev will be closely monitored, as their recent results have been promising.To date, India has secured 35 medals at the Olympics, with shooter Abhinav Bindra (2008) and Neeraj Chopra (2021) being the sole individual gold medalists.","India's haul of seven medals from Tokyo has raised hopes for a double-digit tally this time around.

Bumrah discussed the difficulties Pandya encountered and the importance of mental resilience in dealing with criticism and adversity.Pandya, who assumed the captaincy role from Rohit Sharma just before the season began, was subjected to intense scrutiny and frequent booing from fans, particularly at the Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai Indians' home ground.The team's poor performance, finishing last in the IPL standings with only four wins in 14 matches, further exacerbated the situation.Bumrah stressed the importance of blocking out negative thoughts, a strategy Pandya employed during the challenging period.""We understand that we live in a country where emotion is really the talking point. It's an emotion-driven country. We understand that fans do get emotional, and players are also emotional,"" Bumrah stated. He acknowledged the impact of fan reactions on players, especially when playing in front of a home crowd.The fast bowler emphasized the difficulty of ignoring negative comments and boos, despite recognizing the necessity to do so.""It's not that simple saying 'just don't focus on it.' They're screaming, and you can hear it, but then, the inner circle helps you. We, as a team, don't encourage that, we don't promote that, we don't think that is warranted,"" Bumrah said.Bumrah highlighted the significance of team support and family during such times. ""Now, the world can think what they want to. We as a team were talking to him, if he needed support, his family will always be there. Certain things are beyond your control. If it happens, it happens.""The Indian pacer also pointed out the dramatic shift in public perception of Pandya following his outstanding performances in the T20 World Cup . However, he cautioned that the narrative could quickly change again with just one loss.Reflecting on the nature of sports and its emotional highs and lows, Bumrah remarked, ""You understand it now, because we play a sport that is so popular, every sportsman will go through these things. In football, you see fans booing the best players in the world. This is a part of the sportsman's journey, things will happen that are not great, sometimes, it might not be fair also, but it is the way it is.""Bumrah concluded by encouraging Pandya and others to take challenges in stride. ""We have had a great life, we're doing good things in our sport and for ourselves. All these challenges will come, but it will be better if you take it in the right manner.""","Jasprit Bumrah shares his thoughts on the challenges faced by Mumbai Indians skipper Hardik Pandya during the IPL season.

You have to serve the nation, and every coach wants a good result from his starting tenure,"" he said.Ojha also expressed his admiration for the newly appointed T20I skipper, Suryakumar Yadav. ""I am impressed with Suryakumar Yadav. He is one of the good players, and now it has to be seen how he leads the Indian side,"" Ojha remarked.The BCCI has taken a significant step by requiring senior players to participate in Ranji Trophy matches, underlining the crucial role of domestic cricket in developing successful international careers. Ojha commented on this decision, saying, ""It's so sad that the BCCI had to tell them to play Ranji, but you are whatever today; it's all because of Ranji games.""As the Gambhir era unfolds, cricket fans eagerly anticipate the fresh strategies and dynamics that will emerge, setting the stage for an exciting series in Sri Lanka.","Former spinner Pragyan Ojha says Gautam Gambhir has started a new era in India's cricket team.

He will be 40 years old then. I mean, unless you are a super-fit person like MS Dhoni or Sachin Tendulkar , you can't play World Cup at 40s. Yeah, Virat Kohli could play in the 2027 World Cup, in my opinion, for sure. But for Rohit, Mr. Gambhir, you went overboard; he will faint in South Africa,"" Srikkanth said on his YouTube channel.Moreover, Srikkanth pointed out a perceived inconsistency in Gambhir's selection philosophy.""Gautam Gambhir has taken a U-turn. Before the T20 World Cup 2024, he was saying if Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma do not perform, they will not sit in my team. Then he took a U-turn now, saying there is no player like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma. After becoming head coach, he said that both have a lot of cricket left and hopefully they will be fit for the 2027 World Cup,"" he added.Earlier, Gambhir had clarified during his first press conference as head coach that while he sees a considerable amount of cricket remaining for both Kohli and Sharma, the ultimate decision on their careers would rest with the players themselves.""One thing I can be very clear of is that both those guys have a lot of cricket left in them. More importantly, with the Champions Trophy (in 2025) and a big tour of Australia (from November 2024), obviously they would be motivated enough. Then, hopefully, if they can keep their fitness, the 2027 World Cup as well. But this is a very personal decision. I can't say how much cricket is left in them. Ultimately, it's up to the players to decide how much they can contribute to the team's success,"" Gambhir said during his first press conference since taking over from Rahul Dravid .This debate unfolds as India prepare for the upcoming cricket schedule, which includes a series against Sri Lanka featuring three T20 Internationals and three ODIs from July 27 to August 7, marking Gambhir's first assignment in the national colours.",Former Indian cricketer Krishnamachari Srikkanth doubts Rohit Sharma's ability to compete at such a level past the age of 40.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan's veteran all-rounder Shoaib Malik has extended an invitation to the Indian cricket team to participate in the Champions Trophy 2025 , scheduled to be held in Pakistan.Malik emphasized the importance of keeping politics separate from sports, suggesting that any bilateral issues between India and Pakistan should be addressed independently of their cricketing engagements.""Whatever reservations there are between the countries, that's a separate issue and should be solved separately. Politics shouldn't come into sports. The Pakistan team went to India last year, and now it's a good opportunity for the Indian team too.

We're very hospitable people, so I'm sure the Indian team should definitely come,"" Malik told Cricket Pakistan Despite Malik's welcoming stance, there are reports indicating reluctance from the Indian cricket team regarding their travel to Pakistan for the tournament, primarily due to ongoing political tensions between the two nations.It has also been suggested that the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) might seek to have their matches relocated to alternative venues such as Sri Lanka or Dubai.This development comes amidst a longstanding hiatus in bilateral cricket series between India and Pakistan, with the last series on Pakistani soil taking place during the 2008 Asia Cup .Since then, encounters between the two teams have been confined to ICC tournaments and Asia Cups, with their most recent bilateral series occurring in India from December 2012 to January 2013.The Champions Trophy 2025 promises to be a significant event, with Pakistan aiming to replicate their success from the 2017 edition of the tournament. India, on the other hand, will be looking to add to their victories from 2013 and the shared triumph in 2002.","Pakistan's veteran all-rounder Shoaib Malik has extended an invitation to the Indian cricket team to participate in the Champions Trophy 2025. Malik emphasized the importance of keeping politics separate from sports, suggesting that any bilateral issues between India and Pakistan should be addressed independently of cricketing engagements. There are reports indicating reluctance from the Indian team regarding their travel to Pakistan for the tournament.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112021836,imgsize-64030,width-400,resizemode-4/112021836.jpg"
'Easily one of the best players': Brian Lara rates this batter as more talented than him and Sachin Tendulkar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/easily-one-of-the-best-players-brian-lara-rates-this-batter-as-more-talented-than-him-and-sachin-tendulkar/articleshow/111777582.cms,"NEW DELHI: West Indies cricket legend Brian Lara reveals that he believes his former teammate Carl Hooper possessed more talent as a batter than both himself and Indian cricket icon Sachin Tendulkar .Lara elaborates on Hooper’s exceptional skills, particularly highlighting his impressive performance as a captain and his critical role in significant matches.""Carl was easily one of the best players I've ever seen. I would say that not even Tendulkar and myself would come close to that talent,"" wrote Lara in his new book - 'Lara: The England Chronicles.'Lara further elaborates on Hooper's exceptional aptitude, particularly during his tenure as captain, noting that Hooper truly shone when given leadership responsibilities.""Separate Carl's career from playing to captaining, and his numbers are very different. As a captain, he averaged near to 50, so he enjoyed the responsibility. It's sad that only as a captain did he fulfill his true potential,"" Lara explained.Lara reminisces about Hooper's pivotal role in the drawn Test match against England at Lord's in June 1991, which followed a rare West Indies defeat at Headingley, marking their first away loss to England since 1969. Lara credits the match as a testament to Hooper’s prowess.""When I think back to that Lord's match, I see the class of Carl Hooper. Man, what a player. The ease with which he batted brought out a kind of awe in all of us, even the senior players. You felt that when Carl went out to bat, they enjoyed it – Haynes, Richards, Greenidge, all these guys would stop what they were doing just to watch him,"" Lara shared.Lara also delves into the psychological challenges Hooper faced, particularly under the intense scrutiny of Viv Richards , which may have impacted Hooper’s performance. He reflects on Hooper’s struggle to recognize his own talent and potential, which was often magnified under Richards’ imposing presence.""He was so talented, yet he didn't understand just how good he was. People would ask why he didn't do full justice to his brilliance, and you know what, there is no clear reason for it. But I will say this: Viv used to make me cry every three weeks, but he would make Carl cry once a week. Viv's tone of voice is intimidating, and if you're not strong enough, you can take that personally and be affected by it. I was never really affected by it. In a way, I welcomed it because I was so much under his arm that I knew abuse was coming, and I was a strong personality. Carl? I know for a fact that Carl shied away from Viv Richards,"" Lara wrote.","West Indies cricket legend Brian Lara reveals that he believes his former teammate Carl Hooper possessed more talent than both himself and Sachin Tendulkar.

India vs Sri Lanka: Why Suryakumar Yadav is expected to take to captaincy like 'fish to water',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-sri-lanka/india-vs-sri-lanka-why-suryakumar-yadav-is-expected-to-take-to-captaincy-like-fish-to-water/articleshow/112006293.cms,"NEW DELHI: With India gearing ready to embark on a new chapter in T20 cricket after winning the World Cup in June, much expectation surrounds Suryakumar Yadav 's captaincy in the three-match series against Sri Lanka that starts this Saturday in Pallekele.R Sridhar, the former fielding coach for India, saw Suryakumar's debut in Twenty20 international cricket in 2021 and is optimistic about the batsman's ability to lead by example because of his cool head and collected nature.""Surya has matured a lot from what I know of him from the earlier days, when I was at the National Cricket Academy (NCA), where he used to come as a young athlete, who was very aggressive and very upbeat. But now, if you see, he's much more mature. He's got a much more mellowed head on his shoulders, and he's an astute thinker of the game.""""I mean, he might not have led many matches over franchise cricket, or even for India - he's led about eight games. I remember doing commentary in one of the India-Australia series, where he did a tremendous job. He also did a fabulous job in South Africa in the very short rain-curtailed series which he captained.""Mind you, captaincy is not only about leading the team on the field. Captaincy is all about keeping your players in good space, even off the field, having those right conversations with them, and making sure that each and every player, who's not just only in the squad, but also outside the squad, on the fringe of making it to the eleven, they're also in good space, and they're also well taken care of.""So captaincy brings a lot more onto the table for Surya. It is going to be challenging initially, but I think Surya is someone who'll take to it like fish to water,"" says Sridhar in an exclusive conversation with IANS, facilitated by Sony Sports Network.When Suryakumar was named Mumbai's captain for the 2014-15 domestic cricket season, it was his first taste of leadership. However, it was a lackluster period, and rumors about his irascible persona leading to indiscipline meant Suryakumar missed out on the Mumbai leadership position.Mumbai restored Suryakumar as captain in 2019 after the calm and collected man turned a new page in his life, especially when it came to obtaining that India cap. From 2019 to 2021, he would captain Mumbai in 16 Twenty20 matches for the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy.Sridhar thinks Suryakumar has what it takes to lead India as captain, but he needs to concentrate on picking the best playing eleven and communicating well.""He's got all the wherewithal to be a successful captain. But now that the captaincy is a full-time thing, with that comes more pressure, because his communication has to be more spot on. He needs to know what combination he needs. Obviously, he needs to gel with the new coach, Gautam Gambhir , who is also a no-nonsense person.""Sridhar claims that Suryakumar benefited from playing for the national team under Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma as well as from being Gambhir's vice captain for the Kolkata Knight Riders. ""The fact that Surya knows Gautam Gambhir very well from his days in KKR, before 2017 and 2018, that should hold him in good stead.""""The fact that he's played a lot of cricket under Rohit, and to an extent, under Virat, should have been a good learning for him. It should have been a good internship for him, watching them, observing them, how they go about captaincy.Normally, India vs. Sri Lanka matches would be low-key events, but there's an air of intrigue because both sides have new captains and coaches for the Twenty20 International series. ""That's what makes this series very exciting I guess, because it's the beginning of a new chapter in Indian cricket. We must say this because, especially in the T20 format, not just the coach is new, the captain is (also) new.""We're not going to be having Kohli, Rohit and Jadeja anymore in this particular format. So it opens up the opportunity for many of our intern youngsters to kind of take the legacy forward going ahead in the next T20 World Cup (which) is in India (in 2026).""So they have a good two years to kind of gel and set a platform, play a certain brand of cricket, and have a certain philosophy with which they will play this particular format. That is what makes this series very interesting, because this is where the foundation is going to be laid for that philosophy and vision,"" concluded Sridhar.",R Sridhar says Suryakumar Yadav has what it takes to lead India as captain. Former fielding coach says batsman has matured a lot since he was at NCA. India take on Sri Lanka in a three-match T20 series that starts Saturday.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112006251,imgsize-49088,width-400,resizemode-4/112006251.jpg"

We knew if we get one or two, the wickets would follow.""Masvaure, a 35-year-old left-hander, said he was happy ""to come into the side and put in a solid performance"", adding: ""I would've loved to go all the way (to a hundred). It was nice that Gumbie was positive and gave us that start we needed...we'll take that score.""Gumbie, making his Test debut, narrowly missed out on a half-century when he mistimed a shot off seamer McCarthy, resulting in a catch by Curtis Campher at square leg.Despite the setback, Zimbabwe's innings progressed steadily, with Masvaure reaching his fourth fifty in his ninth Test appearance. The session, affected by intermittent rain, concluded with the team score at 153 for the loss of three wickets.Masvaure surpassed his previous highest Test score of 65 before being well caught down the legside by wicketkeeper Locran Tucker off Campher, concluding a 152-ball innings that featured eight fours.McBrine then made an immediate impact, dismissing Clive Madande for a golden duck on the very next ball. McCarthy later wrapped up the innings in the 72nd over by having Tendai Chatara caught behind.Ireland were relieved of a potentially tricky start to their innings when a fresh downpour interrupted play and cut short the first day.","Ireland bowl out Zimbabwe for 210 on first day of groundbreaking one-off Test match in Belfast.

Ben Stokes backs Mark Wood to break 100mph barrier in Test cricket,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/ben-stokes-backs-mark-wood-to-break-100mph-barrier-in-test-cricket/articleshow/112024072.cms,"NEW DELHI: England captain Ben Stokes believes that Mark Wood has the potential to become the first bowler to exceed 100mph (161km/h) in a Test match. Wood showcased his incredible speed during the second Test against the West Indies at Trent Bridge, reaching a top speed of 97.1mph.England secured a commanding victory by 241 runs, taking a 2-0 lead in the three-match series, with the final Test set to take place at Edgbaston this week.Although the 34-year-old Wood only claimed two wickets in the match, his remarkable pace had a significant impact on the game, benefiting his teammates, particularly off-spinner Shoaib Bashir. Bashir took five wickets for 41 runs in the second innings, securing England's first series win since 2002.Wood also had a direct influence on the West Indies' lineup for the third Test starting Friday, as he fractured Kevin Sinclair's forearm with a rapid bouncer, prompting a change in their squad.Australia's Mitchell Starc currently holds the record for the fastest delivery in Test cricket, clocked at 99.6mph against New Zealand in 2015.In international cricket across all formats, Pakistan's Shoaib Akhtar holds the record with a delivery of 100.2mph, bowled against England in 2003. However, it's worth noting that many exceptional fast bowlers from earlier eras did not always have their deliveries accurately timed.Stokes said Wood still had something left ""in the tank"" when it came to breaking the 100mph barrier but, speaking during a pre-match press conference at Edgbaston on Thursday. added: ""I don't know if he's actually too bothered about it.""He seems to be getting closer and closer to that (100mph mark), but I'm happy with what he's doing now to be honest.""Being able to sustain that pace is quite phenomenal.""His average speed every time he plays a Test match is always above 90mph -- it's all fine and well trying to bowl one spell above 90 but every spell he bowls for England he's clocking over 90mph,"" added Stokes as he reflected on the sheer physical effort of his county colleague.Stokes expressed his satisfaction with Wood's current form, especially considering that Wood's 35-match Test career has been hampered by injuries.""You have to hold your hands up and celebrate what we have there,"" Stokes said. ""He (Wood) has got the heart of a lion. He runs in spell after spell, ball after ball.""When he bowls the whole game changes. When his name is read out the whole crowd is up, then when the speeds are on the big screen everyone gets going.""Woody is always looking up at the screen as well to see what he's clocking.

However, he mentioned that the playing eleven was yet to be finalized, as fast bowler Shamar Joseph is currently battling flu symptoms.Akeem Jordan, a local player for West Bromwich Dartmouth in the Birmingham League, has been added to the squad without a cap. The call-up came on Wednesday following an injury toJeremiah Louis , another fast bowler who was absent from the initial two Tests.Jordan, aged 29, now has the opportunity to make his debut in Test cricket at Edgbaston.

They managed to maintain a competitive edge for significant portions of the game and even secured a lead in the first innings.However, their second innings took a turn for the worse when they lost a cluster of wickets in quick succession, which proved to be a costly setback. Shoaib Bashir, the young off-spinner, was the primary architect of their downfall, claiming an impressive 5-41 and showcasing his potential at the tender age of 20.""We had a fifty opening stand and then, from there, we lost 10 wickets quite quickly,"" said Brathwaite.The 31-year-old opener, out for 48 and 47 at Trent Bridge, added: ""It shows that you've got to be on it always, not just for the first three days,""As soon as you lose that focus and it could be as a bowling unit or a batting unit, you know, and you lose it for an hour, you could be behind the Test match and lose it.""So we should learn from that and obviously the learning for that is just never taking anything for granted.""As long as we keep that attitude of fighting every session, I think that will serve us well.""",West Indies all-rounder Kevin Sinclair ruled out of final Test against England at Edgbaston.

I think naturally we may see, you know, a change in the bowling line-up, but no, that's not required yet.""As for Durham team-mate Wood's fitness, Stokes said: ""You always check in with your bowlers after every Test match and you go with what they say, what they feel.""And he's ready, firing and good to go again.Stokes added: ""Because of how he bowls, it's very unlikely that you're going to get all the remaining Test matches out of him just because of how hard it is on his body, sort of compared to everyone else.""Not that it's any easier for guys who don't bowl 97 miles an hour, but you need to look after guys like that.""Stokes was able to perform as a fully-fledged all-rounder at Trent Bridge, bowling his lively medium pace following knee surgery""Although it's only one more option, I felt as if I've had way more than that,"" said Stokes.He added: ""Woody didn't get the rewards he should have done last week.""But I think the partnership he worked with Bash (Bashir) at the other end, that's where the wickets came from.""I think Woody does know how much he affects the game, even if he's not getting the wickets in the column, because there's just a different feel whenever he comes on to bowl a spell.""Zak Crawley , Ben Duckett , Ollie Pope, Joe Root, Harry Brook, Ben Stokes (capt), Jamie Smith (wkt), Chris Woakes , Gus Atkinson, Mark Wood, Shoaib Bashir","England's cricket team, led by Ben Stokes, has decided to maintain the same lineup for the upcoming third Test match against the West Indies at Edgbaston. The team's objective is to achieve a complete series sweep. England secured a resounding victory by a margin of 241 runs, marking their first triumph since the departure of the legendary James Anderson.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112020273,imgsize-33224,width-400,resizemode-4/112020273.jpg"
Will support national team by developing players at Inter Kashi: Habas,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/will-support-national-team-by-developing-players-at-inter-kashi-habas/articleshow/112029904.cms,"Last season, Habas guided Mohun Bagan Super Giant to the ISL Shield triumph

Panaji:

Antonio Lopez Habas was close to becoming the national team coach until he was pipped at the post by FC Goa ’s Manolo Marquez , who will now do a dual job of coaching club and country.Habas remains the most successful coach in the Indian Super League (ISL), the top-tier league in the country, and believed he had more than a decent chance of stepping into the boots of Igor Stimac, sacked last month for his failure to steer India to the third round of the FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifiers.“I think I deserved the nomination (to coach the national team),” Habas told TOI after completing a surprise move to Inter Kashi in the I-League , Indian football’s second tier, on Thursday. “We won three (ISL) titles, played four finals and six semifinals. Within football (fraternity), I feel like another Indian. I have coached many players of the national team. I was not chosen, and I accept it. I will support the national team by developing players at Inter Kashi. It’s what I have done until now, and what I will continue to do.”Last season, Habas guided Mohun Bagan Super Giant to the ISL Shield triumph. But while title victories normally assure coaches of a contract extension, the experienced Spaniard was not considered, reportedly due to concerns over his health. Even while selecting the national coach, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) executive committee members made a mention of the 67-year-old’s age and health.Habas though said he has the same “strength and enthusiasm” as when he first arrived in India to take charge of Atletico de Kolkata and won the maiden ISL trophy in 2014.“I am very disappointed and saddened by the treatment that some journalists and others have given me, speaking about my health problems. Someone did it to justify my departure from Mohun Bagan, and at the same time, prevent me from training the national team. My medical tests are currently perfect,” said Habas.The serial trophy winner has won the ISL twice with ATK (2014, 2019-20) and the ISL Winner’s Shield with Mohun Bagan last season. Now, his focus is on ensuring that Inter Kashi – started last season – win the I-League and move to the ISL.Explaining his decision to take over Inter Kashi, Habas said the club’s “proposal is attractive, serious and ambitious.”“It offers me guarantees and seriousness to develop my work,” he said. “At the same time, it is a great responsibility to be able to have a great impact sportingly in such an important and fascinating region of India as Uttar Pradesh.”Besides winning trophies in India, Habas had a stint as Bolivia’s head coach and finished runner-up in the 1997 Copa America.Inter Kashi said Habas will spearhead a long-term project aimed at creating a sustainable football ecosystem in Uttar Pradesh. “This initiative will focus on the promotion of Inter Kashi to the ISL, ensuring the club competes at the highest level of Indian football.“Habas will also help Inter Kashi devise a concrete player pathway to Europe, collaborating with Inter Escaldes to establish a pathway for Indian players to gain opportunities in Andorra, providing them with invaluable international exposure and experience,” the club said in a statement on Thursday.","Antonio Lopez Habas was close to becoming the national team coach until he was pipped at the post by FC Goa’s Manolo Marquez.

However, Anees noted that the transfer window has seen seven of their players move to ISL clubs, presenting both a setback and an opportunity for other players to step up and fill the void.""Since the transfer window began, seven of our players have moved into ISL clubs. So we had a lot of players getting transferred to other clubs. It's a setback for us and a bit difficult for us to have the same quality of players to compete at the higher levels.

"Opted to play Durand Cup with reserves, club wanted 6-week pre-season for first team: Chennaiyin assistant coach Noel Wilson",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/opted-to-play-durand-cup-with-reserves-club-wanted-6-week-pre-season-for-first-team-chennaiyin-assistant-coach-noel-wilson/articleshow/112019717.cms,"What was the reason behind fielding the reserve team for the Durand Cup?

Five first-team players – Samik Mitra, Bikash Yumnam, Vincy Barretto, Alexander Romario and Irfan Yadwad – have been included in the camp. What is the plan for them?

What do you make of the youngsters in the squad?

How has the preparation been so far?

Coyle is well known for his positive brand of football. Will the reserve team have a similar style of play going forward?

You have reunited with Coyle, after having worked at Jamshedpur FC. How does it feel?

CHENNAI: Chennaiyin FC ’s newly appointed assistant coach Noel Wilson said the club opted to play with the reserve team in the Durand Cup to ensure that the first-team gets a six-week pre-season ahead of the Indian Super League (ISL). In an interaction with TOI at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium – Chennaiyin’s current training base – Wilson spoke about head coach Owen Coyle’s plan for the main team, Durand Cup preparation and more.Excerpts:You (first team) need to have a six-week pre-season (ahead of the ISL), which is about one-and-a-half months. I think, after the Durand Cup, there is going to be a gap of two months. You cannot be stagnant in that period. Coyle will have better ideas. He does not want the main team to play in the Durand Cup as there are chances of players getting injured. Maybe he does not want to take risk with the main-team players. He knows what is right.The players who have come here did not get much game time last season. When you play competitive matches, your confidence level will increase. After playing here, they will perform better once they return to the main team.There are some young players who have good quality. They need the experience and exposure of playing with the bigger guys (seniors). The difference between playing in a reserve team and a senior team is huge. But I can see that there is potential.Besides players from the main and reserve teams, we have shortlisted a few players from the trials. The team is good; the young boys are working hard. No matter what the team is (opponent), you will win if you play well. That is what I believe in. I have asked the boys not to worry about the opponents, whether they are from the ISL or I-League.It is difficult to implement a style of play when you have only a month to prepare. We began training at the start of the month and our first match is on July 31. But in general, I like it when the boys keep the ball in the front (attacking areas). I do not want the boys to keep the ball at the back for a long time. I do not want them to do that because it might create problems; errors at the back could lead to goals. I would rather expect the players to take the ball forward and play in the opponent’s half. That will be safer for us.Coyle is a wonderful coach; we can see it in his personality and coaching. Last season, he got Chennaiyin to the playoffs. It is always good to work with good coaches. As an Indian coach, we always try to learn something which will help us in the future.",Chennaiyin FC will play with the reserve team in the Durand Cup to ensure the first-team gets a six-week pre-season ahead of the Indian Super League (ISL) Assistant coach Noel Wilson spoke about head coach Owen Coyle’s plan for the main team.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112019695,imgsize-827309,width-400,resizemode-4/112019695.jpg"

Second-half substitute Ajad Saheem saw his shot blocked by the goalkeeper soon after his arrival.

Football with its roots tracing back to ancient civilizations, it evolved into a modern game in the 19th century in England. The sport is characterised by its simplicity and universal appeal, requiring minimal equipment—a ball and a playing field. Played between two teams of eleven players each, the objective is to score goals by getting the ball into the opposing team's net.Football's global reach is unparalleled, with millions of fans and players spanning every continent.

With a total of 873 goals throughout his illustrious career, Ronaldo's achievements include three Premier League titles, five Champions League titles, and the Euro 2016 championship. Despite turning 38 in February, the former Juventus and Manchester United star remains a prolific scorer, having netted 52 goals in 2023 for Portugal and Al-Nassr. His remarkable goal-scoring record, stemming from his evolution from a quick-footed winger to a dominant striker, sets him apart as the greatest marksman in sporting history.Often hailed as the greatest player in football history, Lionel Messi excels in both scoring and playmaking. The Argentine has amassed over 800 goals in just over 1,000 professional matches. His career highlights include scoring 672 goals for Barcelona, winning seven Ballon d'Or awards, and setting the record for most goals in a calendar year with 91.

Bican's prolific scoring came during his time with Slavia Prague and other clubs. Despite various accounts of his goal tally, FIFA’s 2020 commemoration confirmed his impressive total. Bican's career included notable achievements in both Austrian and Czechoslovakian football.Romário, a Brazilian legend known for his clinical finishing, scored 775 goals throughout his career. Starting with Vasco da Gama, Romário went on to shine at PSV Eindhoven and Barcelona, where he was a key player in Johan Cruyff’s “Dream Team” that won the La Liga title in the 1993-1994 season.Pelé, often regarded as the greatest player of all time, scored 762 goals over his illustrious career. The three-time World Cup champion remains an iconic figure in football history, celebrated for his remarkable achievements and prolific goal-scoring abilities.Known as ‘The Galloping Major’, Ferenc Puskás was a crucial part of Hungary’s ‘Magnificent Magyars’ and Real Madrid’s 1960 European Cup-winning team. Despite his unassuming physique, Puskás scored the majority of his 729 goals with his powerful left foot from 1943 to 1966.Jimmy Jones, the highest goal-scorer in Irish League football history, scored 647 goals throughout his career. His prolific period with Glenavon, where he netted 517 goals, solidified his reputation as an unstoppable striker.FIFA’s top player in 2020 and 2021, Robert Lewandowski began his career at Dortmund and gained prominence at Bayern Munich with multiple Bundesliga records.

Maharashtra government

to make amends & announce reward to boost shuttler's morale before Paris Games

MUMBAI: Badminton player Chirag Shetty 's comments regarding Maharashtra government ignoring his achievements while rewarding cricketers from the state for winning the T20 World Cup have stirred up a hornet's nest.Chirag along with Satwiksairaj Rankireddy - the No.3 ranked men's doubles team in the world - played a crucial role in India winning their maiden Thomas Cup in 2022. Chirag, though, wasn't recognised for his effort. After seeing the cricketers being feted, the aggrieved shuttler told TOI on Sunday that ""if the state government can honour World Cup-winning stars, they should also honour him and treat other sports equally"".Besides the Thomas Cup success, Chirag has also won doubles gold at Asian Games , Commonwealth Games and bronze at World Championships. The 27-year-old Malad resident has now found support from prominent sportspersons of the city, who urged the state government to resurrect the situation by rewarding Chirag. Uday Pawar , coach and mentor of Chirag, felt that his ward's achievement is on par with that of cricketers and he should have been rewarded for it.Former India hockey captain MM Somaya said that he had sympathy for Chirag as ""winning the Thomas Cup is a truly historic achievement"". He went on to add that the state government can make amends by announcing a reward for him just before the Paris Olympics begin which will be good ""for his morale as well"".Pawar, a former Asian Games medallist and a prominent badminton coach in the city, said: ""I am not comparing sports but like the cricketers who have brought honour to Maharashtra, so has Chirag. I feel his achievement is on par (with the cricketers). A person who has brought honour to the state shouldn't be demanding but the state should recognise his efforts on its own.""He added that players shouldn't ask for recognition and instead the state government should have a mechanism in place where once they have achieved something of national significance, they should be rewarded.""I think the state's sports ministry should be more active. They should do their own homework and should be aware of who the top players from Maharashtra are. If they don't know about his/her achievement, then the ministry is not functioning properly. They should have people who will keep in touch with the respective associations from state and take updates on how their players are performing,"" said Pawar.Somaya said: ""I would fully agree with Chirag and I would quite understand his position. Since he was the only player from Maharashtra, he deserves the recognition. Need not be such a huge amount that they have given to cricketers but in some manner, he should be rewarded. He is seeking recognition from the state government which I think is only natural and I think it will be fair even if the state govt does it now. He is one of the key players from Maharashtra to participate in the Olympics and has a good chance of winning a medal with Satwik.""He also urged the state government to have a ""consistent policy"" to reward the performers from other sports as well. ""They should reward the players as soon as they know that someone from the state has achieved something big. It should be a standard process. A person shouldn't be applying for it. You should make a person feel a sense of pride when a state government recognises a player on their own,"" felt Somaya.","Badminton player Chirag Shetty's comments regarding Maharashtra government ignoring his achievements have stirred up a hornet's nest. The 27-year-old Malad resident has now found support from prominent sportspersons of the city, who urged the state government to resurrect the situation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111593117,imgsize-31114,width-400,resizemode-4/111593117.jpg"
