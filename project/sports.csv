with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

Do not move from the word to the meaning — move from the meaning to the word. First search for the undertone in the poet’s heart; then explore what the chosen word could mean.”

Realize poems, don’t analyse them.

Poetry is not about dissecting but about integrating.

You don’t have to agree with the poet’s point of view;

Thirukkural

Those who are blessed with eloquence, assess the audience,

Study the words carefully and evaluate the underlying meaning.

At a recent literary festival in Chennai, a celebrated lyricist stirred controversy by interpreting a word from Kambar’sin an unusual way. The verse in question was Vaali’s dialogue to Rama — a moment rich with moral complexity. The wounded king, struck by Rama’s arrow, questions the fairness of being attacked while engaged in combat with his brother. Kambar lets this exchange unfold with grace: Vaali’s probing questions, Rama’s wise answers, and finally, Vaali’s surrender — seeing in Rama not a killer, but his redeemer.In one line, Vaali addresses Rama as a gem and asks,The word Kambar uses —— became the fulcrum of the debate. The lyricist claimed it meant ‘being out of one’s senses’, suggesting that Rama would have escaped punishment murder in such a state. The remark, unsurprisingly, drew outrage.Equally important, however, was the question this episode raised: where should one draw the line when interpreting a poet’s words?The following day,Ilangai Jeyaraj — an eminent scholar and foremost expert in— offered a profound response:He quoted Bharathiyar’s lament that some read epics without ever entering the mind of the creator.From my teachers, I have learned three lessons in the art of reading poetry .The finest poems give us gifts — to the head, the heart, or the soul. To read poetry is to embark on a pilgrimage, not to crack a code. It is the journey where a reader is transformed to a seeker who may walk alone, but whose heart is free and unbound.A poem is not a building where you remove every brick and scaffolding to understand the technicalities. It is a spiritual experience to see how every word and phrase integrate to show us that we are tiny droplets of water in the mighty ocean of life. Poet Billy Collins warns us not to tie poems to chairs and beat them with rubber hoses until they give up their meaning.It is one thing to disagree with a poet; it is another to drag the poet towards your own point of view, twisting words to fit accordingly. What are words, after all, but a container of the soul? Should we be disposing of the food and eating the container?Poetry, at its finest, is a mirror. It shows us what we are. It awakens what is unseen, untouched, and unspoken within us. As Thiru. Ilangai Jeyaraj reminded us, the purpose of epics is to lift human beings from the lowest valleys to the highest peaks — not the reverse.Thiruvalluvar knew well the weight a word can carry. In712, he cautions:","The Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love.

Travis Hunter divorce rumors spark fan backlash at social media’s obsession,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/travis-hunter-divorce-rumors-spark-fan-backlash-at-social-medias-obsession/articleshow/123326235.cms,"(Image via Getty Images)

Rumors about Travis Hunter’s divorce have taken over social media feeds



Fans are calling out the obsession, labeling it ‘weird’ and ‘invasive’



“Y’all are way too invested in someone else’s marriage,”

“Why does this even matter to you?”

When did we, as a collective, decide that an athlete’s alleged marriage drama was worth a nationwide magnifying glass? That’s the question fans are now asking as rumors about Colorado football star Travis Hunter’s supposed divorce keep popping up online. While the internet thrives on a little gossip, many are calling out just how creepy the obsession has gotten and they’re not wrong.The talk started with a few cryptic posts and quickly turned into a full-blown internet frenzy. Multiple accounts began hinting that Hunter and his wife might be calling it quits, with screenshots and speculation flying faster than a 40-yard dash but here’s the thing, there’s been no official confirmation from either Hunter or his wife. This hasn’t stopped gossip pages from turning every comment, every photo, and every absence from Instagram into “proof” of a split.Not everyone’s here for the drama. In fact, a growing number of fans have started pushing back, saying the whole thing feels uncomfortably personal.one fan wrote, while another bluntly asked,Others pointed out the double standard when regular people get divorced, nobody cares, but when it’s a celebrity athlete, suddenly everyone’s a private investigator.Sure, the public has always been curious about celebrity breakups. From reality TV stars to A-list actors, messy splits tend to get clicks. But with Hunter, a 21-year-old still building his career, fans say the narrative feels uncomfortably invasive especially when it’s based on nothing confirmed. The constant picking apart of his personal life is leaving some wondering if sports fans are crossing the line from curiosity into obsession.Hunter is coming off an explosive season at Colorado and has already cemented himself as one of college football’s most electrifying players. Yet, instead of hyping up his on-field performance, parts of the internet are deep-diving into his personal relationships. In the end, it’s a reminder that athletes are still people and no matter how famous they are, their relationships deserve the same respect and privacy as anyone else’s.Also read - Travis Hunter injury update: Jaguars may sit rookie star for preseason Game 2","Rumors about Travis Hunter’s divorce have taken over social media feeds.

Poll Do you think Vanessa Bryant handled the pregnancy rumors well? Yes, very cleverly No, she should have addressed them directly

Met Gala Surprise: Rihanna Stuns With Baby Bump Reveal, A$AP Rocky Confirms It’s Baby No 3

After days of unrelenting speculation, Vanessa Bryant took to Instagram Stories on Sunday, June 1, to put the rumors to rest. Her response wasn’t a press statement or a legal warning, it was a wild meme with a big middle finger to the internet trolls. The meme featured music icon Rihanna floating in water with a snorkel mask on her head, holding a drink, and flipping her middle finger.“Me protecting my peace, not pregnant & having fun all summer,” Vanessa Bryant wrote in the caption on her response to the online trolls who spread her pregnancy rumors about five years after her husband, Kobe Bryant ’s, untimely and devastating demise.It was clear, clever, and vintage Vanessa who shut down noise without saying a word about the origin of the gossip. No press release needed when you’ve got Rihanna energy with a direct middle finger gesture.The rumors had emerged out of nowhere, with some users pointing to photos allegedly showing a ""baby bump,"" though no timestamps or context were attached to those images. Vanessa hasn't been publicly linked to anyone romantically, and there’s been zero confirmation from her side—until now.In another Instagram Story later that evening, Vanessa shared a motivational quote that hinted at how she views the entire situation and what matters to her personally.“The only way to impress me, is by being a good person,” the quote read. “I don’t care what you have, what you wear, where you live, or what you drive. I just have deep respect for people with pure hearts and good intentions.”Adding one final touch to her trilogy of clapbacks, she posted another Rihanna meme, this one stating, “I’m not mean, I’m just not the one.”With the classic Rihanna memes, Vanessa showed that she is busy being a proud mom to her daughters while being the powerhouse of her business ventures. While she does not care about the rumor mill, her reaction explicitly showed that she is urging privacy.Vanessa Bryant, who shares four daughters with Kobe— Natalia, Bianka, Capri, and the late Gianna— has remained devoted to family and philanthropy. Most recently, she shared footage of a joyful family ski trip over the holidays, showing the tight-knit bond she maintains with her children.Natalia Bryant stepped into the fashion world just like her mother, officially joining IMG Models in 2021 at the age of 18. “Ever since I can remember, I wanted to model,” she shared in a statement posted by IMG on Instagram. “There is a lot to learn, but I feel this is a great opportunity for me to learn and express myself creatively.”Vanessa and Kobe Bryant tied the knot in April 2001. Tragically, in January 2020, Kobe and their 13-year-old daughter Gianna lost their lives in a helicopter crash that also killed seven others. They were headed to Kobe’s Mamba Sports Academy for a youth basketball game when the accident occurred. Kobe was 41 at the time. The loss shook the sports world and left a lasting impact on fans, friends, and loved ones across the globe. Kobe has left a huge legacy to his name as well, he is considered one the of the elite NBA superstars of all time with astounding stats, records and intense playmaking abilities. His demise created a huge void in the NBA world as fans are still mourning his untimely passing.Since their passing, she’s kept their memory alive through meaningful business ventures and charitable work. Kobe launched the Mamba Sports Foundation in 2016, aiming to support young athletes. After his death, Vanessa renamed it the Mamba & Mambacita Sports Foundation in honor of both Kobe and Gianna. Today, the foundation helps underserved boys and girls in sports, pushing forward the mission they believed in. It's her way of carrying on their legacy with purpose and heart.Vanessa Bryant’s response was indeed witty and empowering as she hinted that she deserves privacy and reminded the world that while she may be a public figure, her peace and dignity aren’t up for debate, especially not over unfounded gossip. After the viral response via memes, Vanessa has seemingly closed the chapter as she did not extend the matter any further with any other comments about it afterwards.Days after shutting down the pregnancy rumor, Vanessa Bryant made a glowing courtside appearance with her daughters at the New York Liberty vs. Chicago Sky game. The WNBA shared a sweet clip showing Vanessa alongside Natalia, 22, Bianka, 8, and Capri, 5, all smiling and waving for the camera.Later, Vanessa uploaded an image of her in a restaurant, candidly posing as she waited for the food to be arrive. Considering the dress, it appears that the photograph was shot after her recent attendance in the game.Their family moment quickly caught fans’ attention online, adding a warm highlight to the evening. It was a rare and heartwarming public outing for the Bryant family, showing their strong support for women’s basketball. It was Vanessa's first public outing since she debunked the horrendous pregnancy rumors.Recently, Vanessa honored her husband Kobe's memory with a heartfelt Instagram post on Instagram, sharing a throwback photograph of the family with the NBA legend, ""Happy Fathers Day @kobebryant 💕 You are so missed. We love you so much. #GirlDad 💕💕""Earlier this July, Vanessa Bryant added another heartfelt moment to her social media with a birthday post for her sister, Sophie. The sweet throwback photo featured Vanessa, her late husband Kobe Bryant, and Sophie together, smiling during happier times. It comes after several touching family updates, including daughter Natalia’s recent USC graduation and emotional tribute to her dad.As for her fortune, Vanessa's net worth has seen major growth over the years. While Kobe Bryant’s NBA success helped build their fortune, Vanessa carved her own path, too. She’s earned recognition as a model, businesswoman, and philanthropist, adding to her wealth through years of steady work.As of 2025, her estimated net worth is $600 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. A large portion of that came from Kobe’s estate, after his tragic passing in 2020. At the time, Forbes valued the Lakers legend’s net worth at $600 million.Vanessa just shared a sweet throwback-inspired moment that melted hearts online. Her youngest daughter, Capri, recreated one of Kobe Bryant’s most iconic photos from 1999—wearing a cast and pajamas just like her dad did after a wrist injury. Vanessa captioned the photo, “Like father, like daughter. 💜 Capri Kobe Bryant 💜 #BabyMamba #KokoBean 💜💛🐍,” reminding fans how Kobe’s spirit lives on through their kids. From raising her children to keeping Kobe's memory alive, Vanessa has been an example of love and a remarkable parent. Also, there is no report of her seeing anyone as she remains loyal to her beloved husband Kobe, cherishing his legacy with their kids.Vanessa Bryant’s newest tribute arrives just months after she shared memories from a snowy holiday getaway with her daughters. Last December, she posted sweet moments on Instagram—showing the girls toasting marshmallows and skiing through the snow. Little Capri even shared a carousel ride with Vanessa, making the winter trip extra special.Additionally, Vanessa Bryant also grabs headlines for her friendship with several celebrities including Ciara, she often comments and likes the posts of her friends on social media. As of now, Vanessa is keeping a low profile about her personal life like always.Recently, Vanessa Bryant touched hearts with a heartfelt tribute to Kobe Bryant, joined by daughters Natalia, Bianka, and Capri during the Dodgers’ Bobblehead Night. She shared sweet photos from the emotional occasion, and her Instagram post celebrating Kobe Bryant’s legacy quickly drew an outpouring of love from fans.Recently, They partnered with @baby2baby and their Angel, @vanessabryant, to take part in a special Back-to-School Celebration for the incredible students of Ninth Street Elementary in Los Angeles.Also Read: Is Vanessa Bryant pregnant with her 5th child?

Themay be heading toward a roster shake-up before the 2025-26 NBA season concludes, with reports suggesting power forwardcould be on the trade block. While the Lakers have publicly expressed satisfaction with their current lineup, ongoing trade rumors hint that the front office is still searching for the right mix of talent to maximize Luka Doncic’s championship window.According to RB Hayek of ClutchPoints, Vanderbilt’s combination of strong perimeter defense but limited offensive production might not fit the direction head coach JJ Redick wants to take the team. Hayek wrote: “Jarred Vanderbilt may be out of time in LA. Sadly, the Lakers forward is just not cutting it. He averaged 4.1 points and 5.1 rebounds per game during the 2024-25 season while shooting 48.8 percent from the hardwood. However, Vanderbilt only averaged 1.4 points per game during the playoffs and shot 33.3 percent over five games.”While his defense remains a strength, Vanderbilt’s inability to consistently contribute on the offensive end could make him expendable, especially if the Lakers want a more balanced two-way player in their rotation. Jarred Vanderbilt is under contract for $10.7 million through next season, giving the Lakers some flexibility if they decide to move him. His deal could be used in a trade package to bring in players who offer more scoring punch and have a stronger track record of staying healthy.While the Los Angeles Lakers may not fetch a significant return for Vanderbilt, moving him could open up a valuable roster spot for a player with more offensive upside. Given the competitive Western Conference, every roster decision could play a crucial role in positioning the team for a deep playoff run.Possible motivations for a trade:• Acquire a more versatile forward who can contribute offensively and defensively• Improve injury reliability in the frontcourt rotation• Create cap flexibility for midseason movesAlso read: NBA Mock Trade: Los Angeles Lakers Land $121 Million Golden State Warriors Big Man in Blockbuster Swap for LeBron James Vanderbilt’s journey in Los Angeles started with promise, but his offensive limitations and recent playoff struggles have raised questions about his long-term fit.

Bam Adebayo’s 2024-25 Performance

Themay already boast a formidable roster, but NBA analyst Jason Timpf believes that adding Miami Heat’s 3-time All-Star centercould elevate them into championship contention. Speaking on The Volume’s Hoops Tonight show, Timpf suggested that Adebayo’s defensive prowess and playmaking could be the missing piece alongside Jalen Brunson and Karl-Anthony Towns The New York Knicks ’ current core blends elite scoring from Brunson and Towns with strong defensive support from Mikal Bridges and other role players. However, Timpf envisions Bam Adebayo slotting into a role similar to the one Isaiah Hartenstein played two years ago - but with far greater impact.“I think if (Adebayo) kind of filled into that Isaiah Hartenstein role that he was in two years ago, I think he’d do a wonderful job of that,” Timpf said, as quoted by Dean Simon in The Sporting News. He pointed out Adebayo’s ability to run actions with Bridges and Brunson, take advantage of backdoor cuts, and anchor an already strong defensive scheme.While the fit appears ideal, making the trade happen would be challenging due to Bam Adebayo’s $166 million contract and Miami’s reluctance to part with their franchise cornerstone. Still, a potential package exists.Such a deal would give the New York Knicks one of the league’s most dominant frontcourts with Towns and Adebayo - combining size, mobility, and defensive versatility rarely seen in today’s NBA. Bam Adebayo remains one of the NBA’s top defensive big men, earning five All-Defensive Team selections in his career. His offensive contributions last season further underline his value:• 18.1 points per game• 9.6 rebounds per game• 4.3 assists per game• 1.3 steals per game• 0.7 blocks per game• 56.1% true shooting percentageAlso read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers predicted to cut ties with $52.6 million superstar in blockbuster 5-team deal with Mavericks, Bucks, Nets, and Raptors; possible Giannis-Luka duo?

Taylor Swift & Travis Kelce on ‘New Heights': Super SWIFTIE Decodes Major REVELATIONS

Taylor Swift’s appearances at Kansas City Chiefs games to cheer on boyfriend Travis Kelce have been a cultural phenomenon since 2023. While many fans see it as a fun crossover between pop culture and sports, critics claim it distracts from the actual football action. On his FS1 show The Herd, sports commentator Colin Cowherd had little patience for the backlash. He called out what he saw as a double standard, pointing out that celebrity-athlete relationships are hardly new.Colin Cowherd pushed back at critics of Taylor Swift cheering Travis Kelce, invoking David Beckham parallels as Swifties dissected the couple’s affectionate New Heights appearance and the NFL’s culture-versus-sport debate.“I will say I’ve been a little shocked at how myopic and rigid sports fans have been with this. David Beckham married a Spice Girl (Victoria Beckham). Derek Jeter had celebrity girlfriends. Russell Wilson’s married to a singer (Ciara)... Let’s be serious here. Celebrities get celebrities. Justin Verlander, didn’t he marry Kate Upton, the supermodel?” Cowherd said.The conversation comes after Kelce and Swift appeared together on his New Heights podcast with brother Jason Kelce, giving fans a rare glimpse into their relationship.The episode quickly racked up over 13 million views on YouTube.Social media influencer Olivia Levin, who manages the swiftiesforeternity Instagram account, shared her take after going to great lengths to listen live. Stranded in Philadelphia after a flight change, she ended up renting a car with two fellow Swifties just to catch the episode.According to Levin, the chemistry between the couple was undeniable. “They were touching the whole time, the hands intertwined, arms intertwined. When she was having an emotional moment talking about getting her masters back, he kissed her on the forehead. They seemed so supportive of one another,” she said.Also Read: FOX NFL invites Taylor Swift to Tom Brady-led booth as Travis Kelce's beau impresses everyone with her football knowledge Whether you see it as a PR boost for the NFL or a genuine love story, the Kelce–Swift pairing has brought new audiences to football while dominating headlines.

When an NFL investigation spilled into the living room and silence filled the gaps

The reluctant pivot to counseling and a competitive comeback that steadied the mood

A behind the scenes look at New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady

Nearly a decade later, the headlines feel like a time capsule: the NFL consumed by “Deflategate,” Tom Brady’s reputation under a microscope, and whispers that the strain had followed him home. In this throwback, we revisit how a football controversy turned into a relationship stress test for Brady and Gisele Bündchen and the line the couple reportedly drew to steady the ship.The 2014 AFC Championship fallout wasn’t just about PSI charts and legal briefs; it was about fatigue, scrutiny, and isolation. As one source put it, “Things got so bad after Deflategate that they could barely speak to each other.” The quote captured a grim, mundane reality: two megastars reduced to quiet dinners and clipped exchanges, while an investigation stretched on and a four-game suspension loomed.The pressure cooker intensified familiar friction. Another insider described the tipping point: “Tom got irritable under the stress, and she started blaming him for all their unhappiness, much of which was there before the scandal. Counseling was her ultimatum.” It wasn’t a grand gesture so much as a practical lifeline, an acknowledgment that high-performance careers don’t immunize anyone from the slow-burn damage of stress.Therapy, according to reports at the time, forced the couple to separate tabloid noise from real grievances. It reframed the suspension saga as a finite chapter, not a permanent identity. And when Brady returned to the field with the familiar, ruthless rhythm, stacking wins and restoring control—the emotional temperature at home reportedly cooled as well.The lesson, viewed in hindsight, is less about scandal and more about systems.

Kelsey Plum admits her joke on Caitlin Clark didn’t land



A brief context behind the Kelsey Plum’s controversy



Los Angeles Sparks guard Kelsey Plum has broken her silence on the controversy surrounding her postgame remark about Caitlin Clark’s team at the WNBA All-Star Game. Plum claims that it was meant as a joke quickly turned into a flashpoint. Her comments quickly sparked criticism across social media and national coverage. Now, in a sit-down with Sue Bird on the “Bird’s Eye View” podcast, Plum admitted the timing of her words was off and that the moment was taken out of context.After the All-Star Game in Indianapolis, Kelsey Plum told reporters that “zero members of Team Clark” had attended the players’ morning meeting, where the decision to wear black “Pay Us What You Owe Us” shirts was made. At the time, she laughed alongside Sabrina Ionescu, trying to inject humor into a press conference heavy with collective bargaining questions.On Bird’s podcast, Plum admitted her intent never matched how the comments were received. “The questions came in, and it was like, ‘CBA, this, this, this.’ It was like, ‘Hey, Team Clark, they didn’t make it to the meeting.’ I was making a joke that they were hungover, even though our team nickname was ‘hungover.’So it was like, ‘At least we made it (to the meeting).’”Plum has long been known for throwing in lighthearted remarks, but this one hit differently. Fans interpreted her words as a slight against Clark, especially since Clark, though sidelined, was photographed wearing the protest shirt on the court. In retrospect, Plum acknowledged she failed to read the seriousness of the moment.“I made a bad joke. I made a really bad joke, tough one,” she admitted. “I should have—like, hindsight’s 20/20—because of the shirts, because of the fans… I should have known it was a way more serious moment than a typical All-Star Game. Because I went into that press conference very, like, happy-go-lucky we won, you know?”The WNBA’s labor climate explains why Plum’s comment became a hot topic of discussion beyond the locker-room. Players are in the middle of collective bargaining with the league, with the current CBA set to expire in October. The protest shirts worn at All-Star Weekend were designed to highlight pay equity concerns following the WNBA’s $2.2 billion television rights deal.Clark joined her peers in wearing the shirts, despite being sidelined from her play. Plum emphasized that her words should not be taken as questioning Clark’s commitment. “Obviously, we’re all on the same page. We all wore the shirts. Like, we’re all unified. I think, if anything, I was more discouraged because I felt like the comments took away from the moment of what we were trying to do.”Also Read: Magic Johnson’s wife Cookie Johnson celebrates the Los Angeles Lakers legend’s 66th birthday at world famous chef’s restaurant As the league and union move toward tense negotiations, even offhand remarks are under a microscope.

Pittsburgh Penguins face the Gavin McKenna dilemma



Pittsburgh Penguins' roster upgrades make tanking ambitions difficult



Penguins’ Dream Prospect? Gavin McKenna Commits to Penn State

Competition for Gavin McKenna will be intense



With the 2025-26 NHL season looming on the horizon, the Pittsburgh Penguins are looking into a crossroads—and it will shape their future for decades to come. One road is the prospect of Gavin McKenna, the biggest hyped draft prospect since Connor McDavid. The other is the temptation to get a last playoff push out of an aging core headlined by Sidney Crosby.The dilemma? The Pittsburgh Penguins may not be bad enough to acquire Gavin McKenna or good enough to mount a meaningful Stanley Cup charge. That ""mushy middle"" will leave them stagnant, and in a season where several franchises are publicly rebuilding, remaining static may prove to be the worst move of all.On the surface, the Pittsburgh Penguins' roster isn't filled with Stanley Cup confidence. They still lack answers on the net and an exposed blue line—or so it seems if Erik Karlsson is traded ahead of opening night on Oct. 7. But up front, the Pittsburgh Penguins have quietly improved.Rickard Rakell and Bryan Rust are having career years and should continue to be productive alongside Crosby. Scoring depth is provided by free-agent acquisition Anthony Mantha, and Tommy Novak should help the offense with a healthy season after sitting out much of his time with Pittsburgh last year.There is also a crop of young players vying for spots on the roster. Ville Koivunen and Rutger McGroarty showed promise at the end of last season, and Tristan Broz, Avery Hayes, and Filip Hallander might bring the kind of depth and energy most bottom-of-the-barrel teams never see.With modest gains in net—provided by the addition of Arturs Silovs and the growth of prospects Joel Blomqvist and Sergei Murashov—Pittsburgh is perhaps too competitive to slip into the bottom five, even without an intentional push for victories.The actual issue with any Penguins tanking scheme? Other teams are much more interested in losing. The Buffalo Sabres, Chicago Blackhawks, Anaheim Ducks, Seattle Kraken, and San Jose Sharks all seem set to suffer another miserable season, while clubs such as the Detroit Red Wings, Vancouver Canucks, and New York Islanders are mired in their respective transition phases.If Kyle Dubas wants McKenna, Pittsburgh would need to make drastic changes—perhaps trading Karlsson, Rakell, or Rust—to fall far enough in the standings.Also read: Sidney Crosby's enduring greatness: How the Pittsburgh Penguins icon continues to rewrite NHL history For the time being, the Penguins' path is uncertain.

Connor McDavid ’s next contract could be game-changer, says Insider

What’s at stake for Oilers and NHL in Connor McDavid’s contract talks



Connor McDavid FULL Year-End Press Conference

The future of Edmonton Oilers captain Connor McDavid is the NHL’s hottest offseason storyline. As the 2025-26 season approaches, the superstar forward remains undecided on a contract extension, keeping fans, management, and rivals guessing. Now, fresh insider reports suggest his next deal could set a new benchmark in hockey history — worth as much as $17.5 million per year.NHL insider Frank Seravalli believes McDavid’s next contract could fall in the $16–$17.5 million range annually, with a four-year term emerging as the most likely scenario. “This is a pure spitball; I believe it will be somewhere between $16-17.5 million a year on a four-year deal,” Seravalli said, as reported by NHL Rumors and Bleacher Report.McDavid, 28, is entering the final season of the eight-year, $100 million deal he signed in 2017. Eligible to sign an extension since July 1, the Oilers’ captain has yet to commit, sparking widespread speculation about his long-term plans.Daily Faceoff’s Jason Gregor expects McDavid to eventually re-sign, predicting a five-year agreement with an Average Annual Value (AAV) between $15.5 and $16 million. If finalized, the deal would make McDavid the NHL’s highest-paid player when it takes effect in the 2026–27 season, eclipsing current salary records.Drafted first overall in 2015, McDavid has been the driving force behind Edmonton’s return to Stanley Cup contention, leading them to the Final in recent seasons. His unmatched speed, playmaking, and leadership have made him the face of the franchise and one of the most marketable athletes in the sport.The Oilers’ management has adopted a patient stance, giving McDavid full control over the timing of negotiations. However, the lack of an extension has inevitably stirred trade chatter.Also Read: Connor McDavid turns water baby as wife Lauren shares candid poolside snap ahead of Leon Draisaitl and Celeste Desjardins’ wedding McDavid’s projected $16–$17.5 million AAV would surpass the current NHL salary record, forcing the Oilers to rework their cap strategy while setting a new benchmark that could drive up contract values for other top-tier players across the league.","NHL insider Frank Seravalli believes Connor McDavid's next contract could fall in the $16–$17.5 million range annually.

Buffalo Bills head coach Sean McDermott stresses time is running out for Cole Bishop



Bishop’s role depends on a quick recovery and strong performance

As the Buffalo Bills navigate the NFL offseason and prepare for training camp, safety Cole Bishop’s injury status has become a pressing topic. The second-round pick from the 2024 NFL Draft was expected to be a key piece in the Bills’ defensive backfield this season. However, setbacks in the preseason have cast a shadow on his availability, forcing the team to reconsider their safety depth. Head coach Sean McDermott recently spoke about Bishop’s situation and the limited time left for the young safety to make an impact before the regular season begins.Coming out of the University of Utah, Cole Bishop was selected by Buffalo in the second round, joining his former college teammate and Bills tight end Dalton Kincaid in the 2024 draft class. Buffalo’s general manager, Brandon Beane, has reshaped the roster to manage the salary cap while bringing in players expected to contribute quickly. Bishop fit that mold, offering speed and coverage ability in the safety role, a position critical to the Bills’ defense.During his rookie year, Bishop played behind starter Damar Hamlin but steadily gained experience. Despite an injury setback early in his first training camp, Bishop’s performance over the season earned him more snaps and attention.This offseason, he impressed and moved ahead of Hamlin on the depth chart and was slated to start at safety heading into preseason action.The momentum Bishop had built was interrupted by a quad injury that caused him to miss six practices plus the opening preseason game. This absence has raised concerns within the coaching staff about how quickly he can return to full form. “Cole has missed quite a bit of time… It remains to be seen what he is truly able to do for us,” McDermott said, adding, “We’re getting short on time.”The safety position has seen other injuries as well, with Taylor Rapp also sidelined during preseason. Still, according to Buffalo’s first unofficial depth chart, Bishop holds the starting job, signaling the team’s confidence in him once he is healthy.Even if Bishop isn’t fully ready at the season’s kickoff, he is expected to play significant snaps, starting alongside Rapp when both are available. His solid showing late last season and progress in the offseason program give the Bills hope he can live up to his draft status.Bishop’s health and ability to contribute could play a pivotal role in the team’s defensive success in 2025.","Cole Bishop was a second-round pick from the 2024 NFL Draft.

Gabe Davis could sign for New York Giants or Pittsburgh Steelers ?

Buffalo Bills or Kansas City Chiefs–which one’s suitable for Gabe Davis?

Gabe Davis could replace Rashee Rice at the Kansas City Chiefs

Davis played for the Buffalo Bills when they played against the Kansas City Chiefs.

The Chiefs saw Davis firsthand. He accumulated eight catches for 201 yards and four touchdowns in the 42-36 win by the Chiefs.

They have more than $20 million in cap space for 2025, despite extending right guard Trey Smith.

The Chiefs are known to bring players who have succeeded against them. Examples? RB Samaje Perine, who played for the Cincinnati Bengals, rushed for 106 yards in a win against the Kansas City Chiefs in the 2022 season. Chiefs’ head coach Andy Reid said, “We all know what he did to us when he was at Cincinnati with that screenplay.”

Davis could be an intriguing option for a Chiefs team that could need a position group that had seemed very stable before Rashee Rice’s incident.

Jayden Daniels hilariously struggles to hold baby during Commanders practice in must-see viral moment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/jayden-daniels-hilariously-struggles-to-hold-baby-during-commanders-practice-in-must-see-viral-moment/articleshow/123314515.cms,"Jayden Daniels’ baby moment during Commanders practice proves he’s not quite ready for dad duties yet (Instagram/Commanders and Imagn Images)

Jayden Daniels entertains fans with awkward baby moment



Commanders fans still focused on the bigger picture



Jayden Daniels may have already risen in the NFL spotlight, but the Washington Commanders star just proved there’s one area where he’s hilariously out of his depth—holding babies. The reigning NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year, who carried his team all the way to the NFC Championship Game in his debut season, brought long-lost hope to a fan base still healing from the Dan Snyder era. But when it comes to childcare, the 24-year-old quarterback still has some learning to do.Known for his calm composure in high-pressure games, Jayden Daniels looked anything but comfortable when handed teammate Mike Sainristil’s nearly 14-month-old daughter, Summer. The Heisman Trophy winner held her at arm’s length like an alien life form, clearly unsure of his next move. His discomfort didn’t go unnoticed, as he quickly returned Summer to her mom with the kind of speed Commanders fans usually see on his scrambles.The Commanders’ official Instagram had fun with the moment, captioning it: “Uncle Jayden reporting for duty 🫡.” Daniels, ever the good sport, smiled throughout the clip—though it’s safe to say he’s not ready for fatherhood just yet.For comparison, NFL MVP Josh Allen has been seen confidently carrying babies and toddlers, thanks to plenty of time spent with his young nephew. Daniels? Let’s just say his technique could use some preseason reps.Whether he’s awkwardly holding a toddler or leading a game-winning drive, Daniels remains a beloved figure in Washington. Fans aren’t worried about his baby-handling skills as long as he keeps delivering on the field. And after his historic rookie season, expectations are sky-high for his sophomore year.Daniels is ready to script his next chapter. After a sensational rookie campaign that saw him guide Washington to their first NFC Championship Game in 33 years, the AP NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year enters 2024 with laser focus and sky-high ambition. For the rest of the league, that’s a dangerous combination.At just 24, Daniels has become the face of a franchise hungry for glory. His leadership has grown over the offseason, as he’s been far more vocal with teammates than during his early rookie days. Fans, long starved of success, now see him as the quarterback who can restore Washington’s proud football tradition.After coming within one win of the Super Bowl, the Commanders know the bar is higher than ever. Daniels doesn’t need reminding—he’s already preparing to meet those expectations head-on and push his team even further.Also Read: Mike Vrabel plays peacemaker after Patriots and Vikings erupt in intense training camp fight","Washington Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels is the reigning NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year.

Will Aaron Rodgers play in the Steelers’ second preseason game against the Buccaneers?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/will-aaron-rodgers-play-in-the-steelers-second-preseason-game-against-the-buccaneers/articleshow/123314307.cms,"Will Aaron Rodgers make his preseason debut versus the Buccaneers? (Getty Images)

Steelers sideline Aaron Rodgers again for preseason clash with Buccaneers, raising fresh questions on readiness



Steelers banking on practice chemistry over preseason reps



Pittsburgh’s preseason strategy is set in stone for Week 2, and it looks familiar. Head coach Mike Tomlin has confirmed that most of his high-profile starters will once again remain on the sidelines, prioritizing controlled practice reps over game action. Saturday’s matchup against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers will offer little in the way of star power, but plenty of opportunity for depth players to make their case.The list of absentees is star-studded: Aaron Rodgers, DK Metcalf, Jalen Ramsey, T.J. Watt, Alex Highsmith, Cam Heyward, Jaylen Warren, and several others will skip Pittsburgh’s second preseason game. Mason Rudolph will start at quarterback, while Rodgers continues to work through joint practice sessions rather than live game snaps.Tomlin explained, ""I'm going to play this preseason game very much like we did the first one, in terms of participation. The same collection of guys that were held out the last time will comprise the guys that are held out this time.""While fans may be disappointed at not seeing Rodgers in Steelers colors yet, the 41-year-old quarterback is hardly in uncharted territory. His preseason absences are nothing new, and Tomlin appears confident that his preparation habits need no on-field exhibition warm-up.For Rodgers, the real work is happening behind closed doors at training camp and joint practices—like this week’s matchups with the Bucs, where Ramsey has been squaring off against Mike Evans in spirited one-on-one battles.Pittsburgh’s approach this summer is less about proving veterans’ readiness and more about protecting their health while evaluating younger talent. Tomlin noted that decisions will be made weekly, taking into account “development and performance” rather than sticking to a rigid formula.Some, however, remain curious about how Rodgers’ connection with his new targets—Metcalf, Robert Woods, and Calvin Austin III—will evolve without live preseason action. A defensive coach speaking to The Athletic remarked, ""Aaron has had good route runners around him when he was at his best… Metcalf is like a bully, jump-ball, kill-you-in-the-red-zone guy. Truthfully, I have no idea how that works there.""The Steelers completely retooled their passing attack this offseason, and while the vision is clear, the execution will take shape in real time once the regular season begins. For now, Tomlin is betting on practice intensity, competitive matchups, and veteran experience to be enough—leaving the real fireworks for when the games start counting.Also Read: Mike Vrabel plays peacemaker after Patriots and Vikings erupt in intense training camp fight","Aaron Rodgers, DK Metcalf, Jalen Ramsey, T.J.

Mike Vrabel jumps into the fray during joint practice



Toughness defines Mike Vrabel’s coaching style



The competitive fire in New England Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel was on full display during Thursday’s joint practice with the Minnesota Vikings. What began as an ordinary preseason workout quickly escalated into a heated on-field confrontation — and Vrabel, never one to watch from the sidelines, threw himself right into the chaos. The 50-year-old coach ended up at the bottom of the pile but emerged unscathed, reinforcing his reputation as a fearless leader.The incident unfolded during the second practice session between the Patriots and Vikings ahead of their preseason clash at Gillette Stadium. While it’s still unclear what initially sparked tensions, video from VikingzFanPage captured Vrabel charging into the scrum, determined to separate his players from their opponents.It wasn’t his first time playing peacemaker under fire. Just last week, during a joint practice with the Washington Commanders, Vrabel walked away with a gash on his right cheek after breaking up another fight. Despite the risks, players have taken notice of his willingness to stand with them. Wide receiver DeMario Douglas praised the gesture, saying it shows “a lot about our coach” and that “He’ll do anything for us.That’s love.” Quarterback Drake Maye even joked the injury looked like “the Trump gunshot wound.”Mike Vrabel’s readiness to step into the middle of conflict reflects the same grit he displayed during his eight-year playing career with the Patriots, where he won three Super Bowls. After a successful run as Tennessee Titans head coach from 2018 to 2023 — marked by four winning seasons and multiple playoff appearances — Vrabel returned to Foxborough in January with the mission to restore a struggling franchise.Known as a quintessential “football guy,” Vrabel has long built a culture where players feel protected and motivated. That presence was evident again on Thursday — not just in his words, but in his actions. If New England ever needed him to suit up again, it seems the former linebacker might still have a few snaps left in him.Also Read: NFL’s 2025 shake-up: 12 teams add male cheerleaders, sparking fierce debate over tradition and inclusivity",New England Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel jumped into a scuffle during Thursday's joint practice with the Minnesota Vikings.

From clueless to committed: how Taylor Swift’s football glow-up resonated on New Heights

Why FOX eyeing Taylor Swift could be a strategic ratings move beyond a celebrity cameo

Taylor Swift on Reclaiming Her Masters, Wrapping The Eras Tour, and The Life of a Showgirl | NHTV

What this could mean for how we watch football next season

Taylor Swift’s unannounced drop-in on the New Heights podcast with Travis and Jason Kelce did more than stir headlines — it reopened a conversation about the blending of pop culture and live sports. Swift’s playful reflection on her early football misunderstandings and her cheeky timeline for career expansion have set social feeds alight, and FOX’s push to land fresh, crossover personalities means the idea of her in a broadcast booth no longer feels purely fanciful.On the episode, Swift admitted a charming origin story of confusion, “I used to think both offenses were on the field at the same time. Like Jared Goff is here, and Josh Allen is here… and then they both blow a whistle and then they go at each other.”That frankness underscored a genuine learning arc: from bafflement to obsession. Her curiosity, combined with visible enthusiasm for tactical details like special teams and draft decisions, reframes her as a conduit between longtime fans and newcomers who want the game explained without condescension.NFL on Fox’s official account posted an Instagram video demanding, “We need to get @taylorswift in the NFL on FOX booth.”Networks increasingly chase attention economies where appointment viewing depends on cultural relevance as much as analysis. FOX already stacked its lead booth with Tom Brady and seasoned on-air talent, but adding a figure like Swift could expand casual viewership and deepen engagement among younger, pop-oriented audiences.Swift’s comment, “I’m not ready to be an analyst right now, but give me 16 months”, feels less like refusal and more like a promise of potential. If networks want to grow the pie, having a high-profile celebrity who’s also committed to learning the game could be a smart long-term play.Inviting Swift would be about more than novelty. It signals a shift toward broadcasts that treat narrative, personality and expert analysis as complementary. Whether she ever lands in a booth, her New Heights visit highlighted a broader truth: modern sports audiences value authenticity and accessibility.Also Read: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s New Heights appearance fuels marriage rumors with secretive backdrop clue For FOX, that’s the attractive part — a chance to marry gridiron expertise with mainstream cultural momentum and make each weekend feel like a shared event across fandoms.","NFL on Fox’s official account posted an Instagram video demanding, “We need to get @taylorswift in the NFL on FOX booth” FOX already stacked its lead booth with Tom Brady and seasoned on-air talent.

Why It Makes Sense for Los Angeles

Key benefits for the Lakers:

A hypothetical trade scenario has surfaced that would send LeBron James and his son Bronny James from the Los Angeles Lakers to the Golden State Warriors, with Jimmy Butler and a 2028 first-round pick going the other way. This proposal could reshape the NBA landscape, pairing LeBron with Stephen Curry in what could be one last run at a championship.As Dan Angell of Sports Illustrated wrote, “Even at 40 years old, there’s only one LeBron.”The challenge in moving LeBron James is not just his full no-trade clause but also his desire to play alongside Bronny. That means any acquiring team would need to take on $54.5 million in combined salary.The Los Angeles Lakers, operating over the first apron, must receive similar salary back under NBA cap rules. Many teams, like the Cleveland Cavaliers, are unable to make such a deal due to second-apron restrictions, but the Warriors can. Golden State ’s front office must remain cautious with the salary cap to avoid losing their mid-level exception and other flexibility. Swapping Jimmy Butler for the James duo works financially when Bronny’s minimum deal is factored in.• LeBron finally teams up with Stephen Curry, fulfilling a long-standing wish.• Bronny joins the roster, keeping LeBron content and motivated.• The team remains competitive at Butler’s former position while aiming for another championship before Curry’s window closes.While the Los Angeles Lakers are not eager to take on Butler’s contract, they cannot offload LeBron before the 2026 offseason without taking back equal salary. The inclusion of a 2028 first-round pick makes the deal more appealing.• Gain a valuable future draft asset to support their plan to build around Luka Doncic.• Butler, though 36, remains an elite defender and capable scorer.• Potential to trade Butler later for pieces that align with a long-term title push in 2027 and beyond.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors Eyeing $28 Million Portland Trail Blazers Star; Potential Stephen Curry Reunion Amid Jonathan Kuminga Uncertainty?

Why Payton Still Fits the Golden State Warriors’ Direction

Why Gary Payton II Fits Perfectly

Theare reportedly moving toward a reunion with defensive specialistin the upcoming free agency, according to Eric Pincus of Bleacher Report. While the team’s offseason has been relatively quiet with no blockbuster additions, the front office is carefully navigating roster construction and salary cap logistics. Jonathan Kuminga’s restricted free agency is also playing a central role in how soon Payton’s deal can get done.Gary Payton II’s reputation as one of the league’s premier defenders makes him a natural fit for the Golden State Warriors’ system. His ability to lock down opposing guards and wings complements the Warriors’ long-standing strategy of pairing Stephen Curry ’s offensive brilliance with a strong defensive backbone.Payton’s impact goes beyond numbers—his defensive communication, hustle, and on-court chemistry have made him a fan favorite. Last season, he appeared in 62 games, providing consistency and energy off the bench. Jonathan Kuminga ’s status remains the key domino in Golden State’s offseason. As a restricted free agent, his future - whether through re-signing, a sign-and-trade, or another move - will determine the team’s financial and roster flexibility.Pincus notes that Payton’s potential return is “waiting on the Warriors to either sign or move on from Jonathan Kuminga,” a situation similar to past cases where other signings were delayed pending bigger roster decisions.The Golden State Warriors are operating just below the luxury tax apron, making every contract decision significant. Even with potential re-signings like De’Anthony Melton and Al Horford, the team could keep space for Payton while adding other depth pieces.The mention of Simmons by Pincus adds intrigue - he could bring a Draymond Green-like blend of defense and playmaking if healthy.Golden State is entering a transition period post–“Splash Brothers” era, but the team’s DNA still values defense, ball movement, and chemistry. Payton’s familiarity with Steve Kerr’s schemes and his ability to elevate lineup performance make him a low-risk, high-reward signing.Personally, I feel that Gary fits in the Warriors for the following factors:• Elite perimeter defense against top guards/wings• High lineup net ratings when on the floor• Efficient scorer with strong cutting and finishing ability• Durable and adaptable to multiple lineup configurations• Enhances team chemistry and allows stars like Curry to focus on offenseAlso read: Why the Golden State Warriors are Interested in $60 Million Boston Celtics Big Man to Bolster Stephen Curry and Jonathan Kuminga’s Supporting Cast The Golden State Warriors’ measured offseason is less about chasing headlines and more about securing the right pieces.

In a recent podcast interview, Brooklyn Nets player Michael Porter Jr. talked candidly about his romantic life and his search for a potential wife. On his most recent Curious Mike podcast episode, the former Denver Nuggets player further said that he wished to establish a ""judgment-free zone"" where he and his supporters could be candid. He also stated that everyone has distinct vices. In addition, he clarified that women have always been his vice. Additionally, he has opened up about similar things before on One Night with Steiny. Michael Porter Jr. addressed a topic that isn't included in a box score on his Curious Mike show. During the YouTube podcast, he said:“Everybody has different vices. Everybody has different things that they struggle with. … You know, for example, my brother struggled with gambling. My vice has always come in the form of women.”He continued:“There was one girl I really liked… She used to talk to a dude in the league and I was like I just can’t do it, because if I’m cooking him and he’s allowed to say thats why I hit your girl.”He had previously talked candidly about his romantic life. On One Night with Steiny, the 27-year-old discussed his romantic pursuits and said:""My only thing with a girl, you gotta bring something to the table. I don’t mind providing for you, I don’t mind doing that… You can stay at the crib, you can do your thing. You gotta bring something to the table. … Positivity, you gotta help me mentally, you gotta be able to cook or something. You gotta bring something to the table … look, what value are you bringing to my life? That’s the way I look at it now…”He continued:""In a wifey, I don’t mind if she’s a stay-at-home mom. My mom was a stay-at-home mom but she raised all eight of us kids, she homeschooled us, she cooked for us when my dad was out working, she raised us. You gotta be able to do something.

Milan Lucic’s wife stirs NHL return buzz despite lingering 2023 domestic violence scandal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/milan-lucics-wife-stirs-nhl-return-buzz-despite-lingering-2023-domestic-violence-scandal/articleshow/123313492.cms,"Brittany Lucic offered a glimpse into Milan Lucic's recovery via Instagram, hinting at a possible NHL return (Getty Images)

Milan Lucic’s wife Brittany hints at his NHL return

How the legal and team context still shapes any potential return

What to watch next and why fans should pay attention



Brittany Lucic used an Instagram Q&A to offer a rare, personal update about her husband Milan Lucic’s recovery and the possibility of him returning to the NHL — a brief but loaded exchange that rewrites the public narrative around a case that drew intense media scrutiny. Her comments didn’t settle questions about a comeback, but they did spotlight accountability, rehabilitation and how families navigate high-profile incidents behind closed doors.When a follower asked if Milan planned to return to pro hockey, Brittany posted a swim-trunk photo and wrote: “I’m not sure but he looks great!” That clipped answer didn’t confirm a roster plan — but it did suggest Lucic is physically well and perhaps rebuilding his life away from the headlines. For teams, agents and fans tracking roster depth, ambiguous updates like this are often the first public signals of someone moving through recovery toward potential availability.Across the Q&A, Brittany framed their progress as deliberately staged: “Separate! And then together! It’s a powerful journey I will share more about my views/path eventually! 🤍” She also reflected on self-accountability: “Isn’t it so easy to blame others, have no accountability, identify the role you played in your life, or even have to self reflect … spooky stuff going to those places.”These words matter because they shift the frame from legal outcomes to personal growth — a narrative teams and leagues increasingly weigh when considering an athlete’s return to play.Lucic was arrested in November 2023 after an alleged domestic incident; prosecutors later dropped charges when Brittany invoked marital privilege, and Lucic entered the NHL/NHLPA Player Assistance Program and took an indefinite leave. Those facts remain central to how franchises, sponsors and the public will evaluate any comeback path — medical clearance and PR rehabilitation alone rarely settle the broader reputational calculus.This Instagram exchange isn’t a roster update so much as a status report on a family working through trauma under public view. If Lucic aims to play again, expect a slow, documented return: formal medical updates, team statements, and possibly conditions tied to assistance-program milestones.Brittany’s candor, and her “I’m not sure but he looks great!”, keeps the conversation alive, but the final call will hinge on health, league protocols and how stakeholders assess accountability and readiness.Also Read: Johnny Gaudreau’s 32nd birthday unites fans, teams, and rivals across the NHL, turning loss into a call for change","Brittany Lucic offered a rare, personal update about her husband Milan Lucic’s recovery.

NHL trade rumors heat up as Carey Price’s contract linked to potential Chicago Blackhawks deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-rumors-heat-up-as-carey-prices-contract-linked-to-potential-chicago-blackhawks-deal/articleshow/123313471.cms,"The Montreal Canadiens could finally be on the verge of moving Carey Price’s massive contract (Getty Images)

Why the Blackhawks make sense as a landing spot for Carey Price's contract

What Montreal gains — and the steep price they’d pay



The Montreal Canadiens could finally be on the verge of moving Carey Price’s massive contract — and the Chicago Blackhawks might be the team to make it happen. With Price’s deal entering its final year and carrying a $10.5 million cap hit, a proposed trade scenario has emerged that could benefit both sides while reshaping their near-term plans.The Chicago Blackhawks currently sit just over $6 million above the salary cap floor and are expected to move several veterans by the trade deadline. Taking on Carey Price’s contract would give them a financial cushion and strategic flexibility. Analyst Tab Bamford suggests a swap in which Chicago would receive Price’s contract, along with Montreal’s 2026 and 2027 first-round picks, in exchange for goaltender Laurent Brossoit, forward Lukas Reichel, and three second-round picks spread across 2026 and 2027.For Chicago, the move would create a stockpile of draft capital — including three first-rounders in 2026 — giving them “enough ammo to do something significant” in the future. And if the Hawks decide to make a big splash in free agency, Price’s and Shea Weber’s contracts could be placed on LTIR, unlocking more than $18 million in extra cap space.From Montreal’s perspective, adding Brossoit would address a current depth issue behind starter Samuel Montembeault.As Bamford bluntly put it, “Right now, their backup is Kaapo Kahkonen — who is not good.” Brossoit’s career .911 save percentage (.927 last season with Winnipeg) and Stanley Cup-winning experience with Vegas in 2023 make him an immediate upgrade.Reichel, meanwhile, is a 23-year-old former first-round pick who hasn’t found his stride in Chicago. A fresh start in Montreal could unlock his potential, especially in a system eager to develop young forwards.The challenge for the Canadiens would be the heavy draft pick sacrifice — having already moved both 2025 first-rounders in the Noah Dobson trade, losing their ’26 and ’27 selections would test their long-term asset management.Also Read: NHL Trade Rumors: Connor McDavid linked to Maple Leafs and $3.5B Rangers if Oilers extension talks stall Still, if Montreal believes Brossoit and Reichel can contribute immediately, and if shedding Carey Price’s cap hit accelerates their rebuild, this could be the kind of high-risk, high-reward move that changes their trajectory.",The Montreal Canadiens could finally be on the verge of moving Carey Price’s massive contract.

Montreal Canadiens and defenseman Lane Hutson making progress in NHL contract extension talks

How Lane Hutson’s potential Montreal Canadiens contract compares to other top young NHL defensemen

The Montreal Canadiens and 21-year-old defenseman Lane Hutson have begun preliminary talks on a new contract, with sources describing discussions asHutson, a pending 10.2(c) restricted free agent, is coming off a standout rookie season and is eligible to sign an extension as of July 1. While talks are still early, both sides appear confident a deal will eventually be reached.According to RG’s Marco D’Amico, the Canadiens and Hutson’s camp are in a good place as negotiations move forward. Hutson’s 10.2(c) status, meaning no arbitration rights or offer sheet eligibility, gives Montreal a stronger negotiating position. This lack of external leverage for the player allows the team to explore cap-friendly options without the immediate pressure of a bidding war.Hutson’s debut season was nothing short of impressive. The reigning Calder Trophy winner posted 60 assists and 66 points in 82 games, cementing his status as one of the NHL’s brightest young blue-liners. Given his performance, the Canadiens are aiming to secure his prime years while balancing the long-term salary cap outlook. Early projections suggest an annual average value (AAV) in the $8.8 million to $9.5 million range, depending on term length.While some have drawn comparisons between Hutson’s upcoming deal and Noah Dobson’s eight-year, $9.5 million AAV contract, industry insiders point out key differences. Dobson’s right-shot profile, top-pair minutes, and proximity to unrestricted free agency gave him far greater bargaining power than Hutson currently holds.Instead, Hutson’s situation aligns more closely with recent long-term deals for fellow 10.2(c) defensemen like Quinn Hughes, Jake Sanderson, and Brock Faber. These players secured contracts worth roughly 9–9.5% of the salary cap. With the NHL cap projected to reach $104 million, Hutson’s extension will likely follow a similar formula. Both sides may also be waiting to see what New Jersey’s Luke Hughes signs for, giving Hutson’s camp another relevant comparable.The Canadiens appear set on keeping Lane Hutson as a central piece of their defensive core for years to come. While the exact term and cap hit are still being negotiated, the tone of discussions suggests a mutually beneficial deal is on the horizon. Montreal’s focus now is locking in their promising young defenseman at the right price before the market shifts further.Also Read: Utah Mammoth prospect Caleb Desnoyers likely to have debut pushed back to November due to injury","Montreal Canadiens and defenseman Lane Hutson making progress in NHL contract extension talks.

The Falcons shocked many analysts by drafting him in the first round despite signing veteran QB Kirk Cousins just weeks earlier.Known for his cannon arm and calm demeanor, Penix took over starting duties late in the 2024 season and has been touted as one of the most promising young quarterbacks in the league.

Lerone Murphy: The Rise of 'The Miracle' from the Streets of Manchester to UFC Stardom,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mma/news/lerone-murphy-the-rise-of-the-miracle-from-the-streets-of-manchester-to-ufc-stardom/articleshow/123312213.cms,"Image credit: Instragram

Growing up in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester, Lerone Murphy’s childhood was a whirlwind of football, friends, and the occasional mischief. Living near Manchester United’s iconic stadium meant the game was never far away. “My childhood was crazy,” Murphy recalls. “I used to love playing football, going out with friends. Sometimes we got into trouble, but it was fun. Football was a big part of my life.”But life in a deprived, rough area shaped him in ways beyond sport. “It made me mentally resilient,” he says. “I got into a lot of fights when I was younger, and that toughened me up.”For years, football seemed like his future—until a devastating knee injury at 16 changed everything. Playing in a cup final, Murphy suffered a serious blow. “I blew my knee up, and that set me back,” he remembers. “It took me away from sport altogether. Without that, I went down the wrong path.”Combat sports weren’t initially on his radar, even though his uncle, Oliver Harrison, was a respected boxing trainer who worked with big names like Amir Khan. “It was inspiring, seeing what he was doing,” Murphy says, “but I never thought I’d be a fighter.I just wanted to be a footballer.”That changed when a gym opened in Manchester. Training with his cousin, Murphy discovered mixed martial arts—and instantly connected with it. “It was love at first sight,” he admits. “I’d always been into combat through things like anime and Street Fighter, but I’d never tried it. Once I did, I was hooked.”Murphy turned professional in 2016, and within three years, he was making his UFC debut—a rapid rise built on relentless dedication. “I train every day. I don’t do anything else but train or think about fighting,” he says. “That’s why I’ve grown so quickly.”But perhaps the most pivotal moment of his life came in 2013, when he was 21. Leaving a barbershop, Murphy was shot—a brush with death that would alter his path forever. “It was a dark time,” he admits. “But it was also the moment that changed me. If that didn’t happen, who knows what I’d be doing now. As strange as it sounds, I’m happy it happened because it put me on the path to MMA.”That life-altering event earned him the nickname “The Miracle,” a badge of resilience he carries into every fight. “It reminds me I can get through anything,” he says. “Even if things don’t go your way, it doesn’t mean it’s the end. You can turn things around if you stay resilient.”Training at Manchester Top Team has been key to his continued growth. Surrounded by high-level fighters chasing the same dreams, Murphy has refined his skills while staying loyal to the team that shaped him. “It’s good to have that environment,” he says. “It keeps you sharp.”For young people facing tough times, Murphy’s message is simple but heartfelt: “There’s always light at the end of the tunnel. It’s never over until it’s over. If you’re still here, you can change your situation. Keep good people around you, lean on them, and cut out the bad influences. That’s the main thing.”Looking ahead, Murphy’s ambitions are crystal clear. “My goal is to be UFC champion—and defend it in Manchester. That’s my dream.”Watch Lerone Murphy in UFC 319 on 17th August from 7:30 AM IST live on Sony Sports Ten 1 SD & HD, Sony Sports Ten 3 Hindi SD & HD , Sony Sports Ten 4 Tamil & Sony Sports Ten 4 Telugu.","Lerone Murphy is a welterweight fighting for the UFC.

Caitlin Clark’s records are in danger. The Dallas Wings guard Paige Bueckers becomes the fastest WNBA rookie to score 500 points and 100 assists. She has played 27 games in the WNBA. Her latest match was against the Los Angeles Sparks. The Sparks won the game by a 1-point lead. However, Bueckers stole the show with a whopping 29 points, 4 rebounds, and 5 assists. She maintained her long streak of matches with 10 points or more, along with breaking the franchise’s record for the most assists. Clark is still at the top of the Rookie leaderboard with 769 points. However, with the current pace, it might not take much time for Bueckers to surpass the top rookie player of the WNBA.Paige Bueckers is just breaking records with her gameplay. Even though the Dallas Wings faced another loss, and this time against the Los Angeles Sparks, Bueckers has managed to maintain her streak regardless. The rookie already holds the longest streak of scoring 10 points or more. After today’s match, the streak extends to 27 straight games. Bueckers has never scored less than 10 points in a game. Apart from maintaining this, the player recorded two new milestones.Setting the court on fire, the rookie sensation broke the franchise’s record for the highest number of assists in a rookie season. After the match against the Sparks, her assist count stands at 143. This also places her in the 7th position across the franchise history with the most number of assists.While the franchise records are being broken, Bueckers doesn’t seem to settle and continues to break WNBA records as well. After scoring a total of 29 points, the Wings’ star becomes the fastest rookie to rack up 500 points. The rookie campaign seems to be going well for the athlete. With such a pace and series of records, Bueckers is going to leave a major mark within the league.The Dallas Wings defeated the Indiana Fever by a 1-point lead. Maddy Siegrist and Li Yueru were the highest scorers of the game with 22 and 20 points, respectively. Paige Pueckers racked up 16 points to add to the roster. However, Fever’s star Sophie Cunningham was not content with the gameplay. Pointing at the referee’s bias towards Bueckers, she stated, “Those refs were giving her every whistle last night. You literally couldn’t touch her, couldn’t touch her. That s**t is so annoying to me. And if you’re going to do that, then to give it to our guards. I just hate the inconsistency.”Bueckers was asked about Sophie’s comment just before the Wings were about to face the Fever. Keeping her calm, Bueckers simply replied, “Everyone is entitled to their own unique personal opinion.”Seems like Bueckers does not want any distraction. She continues her historic rookie campaign with multiple records and more to come.Also Read: Why the New York Knicks Could Sign $166 million Miami Heat Superstar and Form Deadly Defensive Duo With Jalen Brunson, per NBA analyst","Paige Bueckers becomes fastest rookie in WNBA to score 500 points, breaks Dallas Wings’ franchise record with most assists.

Zara Tindall spent the weekend competing at the NAF Five Star International Hartpury Horse Trials in Gloucestershire. Beside the warm-up ring, her 11-year-old daughter Mia watched closely, smiled for photos, and reached up to stroke one of Zara’s horses. The small moments told their own story. Mia looks at home around the stables.Zara rode two familiar partners at Hartpury. She brought Showtime, known in the yard as “Cracker,” and Class Affair, nicknamed “Socks.” Between rounds, Mia stayed close, chatting with her mum and keeping an eye on the action. It was a simple family scene at a busy event.The outing fits a long family pattern. Zara is an Olympian who has spent most of her life around eventing. Her mother, Princess Anne, was the first royal to compete at the Olympics. Her late grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, was a lifelong horsewoman. Seeing Mia comfortable in that world feels natural, and it hints at a next chapter for the Tindalls’ eldest child.Crowd shots from Hartpury showed Mia following each phase and cheering from the ropes. She watched showjumping from close enough to see take-off strides and leaned forward during cross-country updates.Nothing about it felt forced. It looked like a child enjoying her mum’s sport.The event itself is a regular stop for Zara. It draws strong fields across levels and gives riders a good mid-season test. This year she balanced competition with being present for her daughter, and the cameras picked up that easy rhythm. A rider’s focus can be intense on show days. Zara still made space for quick smiles with Mia before heading back to the horsebox.There was also a small stable-side detail that fans loved. Mia reached up to pat Showtime and grinned as the horse flicked an ear toward her. Little gestures like that say more than any speech about where a child’s interests might lead. No one is mapping out her future, but comfort around horses often starts with moments like this.Zara has said before that all three of her children have been on a pony. That early exposure shows. Mia moved around the yard with confidence, giving the horses space when needed and stepping back when grooms asked. It is the kind of quiet horsemanship children pick up by being around good yards.Mother and daughter also offered a simple picture of support. When Zara finished a round, Mia was there. When the next phase approached, Mia made way so the team could work. For families who live the show circuit, that balance is familiar. It is how many young riders begin, watching first, riding later.The photos from Hartpury will add to Mia’s growing gallery of equestrian days out. For now, it is enough to see interest and joy. If she chooses to ride more in public, she will have a mother who understands the sport at the highest level and a family who know how to blend normal life with busy weekends on the road.Hartpury offered a gentle reminder of what this family values. Horses, routine, and time together. One weekend, two good horses, and a child who could not stop watching. That was the story from the rails, and it was easy to read.","Zara Tindall spent the weekend competing at the NAF Five Star International Hartpury Horse Trials in Gloucestershire.

Princess Anne is celebrating her 75th birthday with a fresh look and her signature sparkle. A new portrait released ahead of the milestone shows the Princess Royal standing alongside her husband, Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence. The photograph was taken before the French state banquet at Windsor Castle in July.The first thing people will notice is her hair. Anne has worn a similar bouffant style for about five decades. In this portrait she switches to a smooth chignon. It is elegant, neat, and suits the formal setting. The change is rare for her, which is why the photo drew quick attention.Tiara is the second talking point in this portrait. Anne chose the Festoon Tiara, a long-time favorite in her rotation. She received it as a gift in 1973 after christening a ship for the Worldwide Shipping Group. The design sits low and balanced, which works well with the new hair. Together they create a cleaner frame around her face.The portrait also doubles as a quiet nod to partnership. Sir Tim stands with her, as he often does at major state events. The two married in 1992 and keep a low profile. Their presence together in the birthday image sets a warm tone as family plans take shape for the coming weeks.There is context behind the timing. The palace shared the photo one week before her August 15 birthday to start the celebrations. It was shot by royal photographer Chris Jackson. He captured it at Windsor before the banquet held for the French state visit from July 8 to 10. The result is formal but relaxed, a look that fits Anne’s usual style.Fashion notes aside, the image also lands after a busy and challenging year. Anne remains one of the most active working royals by engagement count. Last year she briefly stepped back after a horse-related incident near her home. She returned to duties and later said the experience was a reminder that each day is a bonus. The new portrait, bright and composed, underlines that message without a single word.Reactions so far focus on two themes. Many like seeing a small style reset that still feels like Anne. Others appreciate the continuity of the Festoon Tiara, a piece linked to her early twenties and worn across decades. It is a simple mix of new and old. That balance is what people expect from her.As the birthday week begins, more pictures and appearances are likely. For now, one frame does the job. New hair. A classic tiara. Her husband at her side. It is a quiet portrait that still says a lot about how Anne works, dresses, and shows up for the role she has held for most of her life.","Princess Anne is celebrating her 75th birthday with a fresh look and her signature sparkle.

Lownie revealed a series of the York family's secrets, ranging from Prince Andrew's unusual sexual habits to Sarah Ferguson's association with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.""There is very little that the Royal Family can actually do when it comes to Prince Andrew,"" said Daily Mail's Editor-at-Large Richard Kay on the latest episode of ""Palace Confidential.""""He's been effectively sacked. He's the only royal prince who has been sacked from public life that I can think of. ""Short of sending him far, far away - and who would want him? - I think it's very insulting when I keep reading suggestions of sending him to the Falkland Islands. Do the people there particularly want Prince Andrew? I doubt it very much.""So it's difficult to know what to do with him. He's just going to be there. They have managed it fairly well. He doesn't have any kind of public role. ""What about stripping him of everything? Well, he was born a prince, and he was given a dukedom.""The one thing they could possibly do would be to remove the dukedom, but I think it would have to come through parliament, and I can't see any government of any shade wanting to get involved in anything like this. It would open up a real can of worms.""So far, just six per cent of readers have responded 'no' to the question. Richard stars on the hit YouTube panel show alongside Daily Mail's Diary Editor Richard Eden and Royal Editor Rebecca English.Rebecca, who has covered the royal beat for the Daily Mail since 2004, added: ""It's a hugely tricky one for them because he is there and he exists. They can't airbrush him out - he is a member of their family."" In an exclusive interview in the latest edition of the Daily Mail's royal newsletter, ""Palace Confidential"", Lownie stated he contacted over 3,000 former school contemporaries, staff, colleagues, and associates of the couple. ""Of whom 300 spoke to me,"" Lownie said.""Some on the record, but most off. ""They felt it was time to challenge the York family’s carefully curated narrative. It is difficult because there tends to be a code of silence about the royals (no one wants to be cast out of the privileged circle).""Additionally, their staff have to sign NDAs, royals are not fully subject to the Freedom of Information Act and there are strict limits on what questions MPs can ask about them in Parliament. ""I could also add the letters I received threatening to sue me, before a word of the manuscript had been seen. Charming people.""In the ""Palace Confidential"" episode, Richard Kay pointed out that within the Royal Family, there is an instinct to ""circle the wagons and protect one of their own"".He added: ""Their first response in all these cases is 'Oh, it's just the press, it's the media.' This is different. This is a graphic book written by a figure who has some substance in the writing he has done. ""You can't just brush this away."" Having covered the royal beat for more than 20 years, Richard Eden shared his views on whether Andrew should be stripped of his titles.He said: ""Certainly, what the King could do, and something that I have advocated for a long while, is strip him of his role as a Counsellor of State. ""He and Prince Harry still have the legal right to deputise for the King. That could easily be stripped from them, as well as his title of Duke of York or other things if they wanted to.""He is still in the line of succession. Yes, it would take an Act of Parliament, but that's no big deal. ""The King did it recently when he extended the list of Counsellors of State to include Princess Anne and Prince Edward. It could be done very easily indeed.""That's something which I would strongly suggest he does."" Elsewhere in the episode, the panel discussed the possibility of Prince William taking ""decisive action"" regarding aspects of the monarchy in the coming years.","Andrew Lownie's new biography, The Rise and Fall of the House of York, has been exclusively serialised by the Daily Mail.

Canadian man slams city after Indian family plays loud music at Barrie Beach; claims was once fined for playing guitar- Watch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/canadian-man-slams-city-after-indian-family-plays-loud-music-at-barrie-beach-claims-was-once-fined-for-playing-guitar-watch/articleshow/123302209.cms,"Screen grab from video posted by Instagram @troll_canadaa__

Poll Do you think it's fair for authorities to allow loud music while preventing others from performing? Yes, it's unfair No, they should enforce rules equally





A Canadian man stirred debate online after criticising an Indian family for playing loud Punjabi music at a beach in Barrie, Ontario.In the video, shared on Instagram, the man- who goes by @truenorthlooper- described himself as a one-man band and said city authorities had once stopped him from performing at the beach and fined him.He alleged the same authorities now allow others to “blast whatever kind of music they want.”While speaking, he stopped in front of a picnic blanket with bags and a speaker playing Punjabi music. “This is another example of coming down to the beach and blasting whatever kind of music you want and at whatever volume you want. These people are not even here, yet everyone within 150 feet has to listen to this. Great job, City of Barrie,” he said sarcastically.He continued by criticising the authorities for penalising him for playing guitar. “Heaven forbid, I play guitar and raise money for the Barrie Food Bank. That’s a no-no. But yeah, come here and blast whatever music you want, you don’t even have to listen to it, go play in the water while everyone else will have to listen to it,” he added.The video, originally titled “The good, the bad and the ugly reality of the City of Barrie,” resurfaced after being shared by a Canadian Instagram page.The post drew mixed reactions in the comments. Some supported him, writing, “Common courtesy and space for others used to be a thing. I think the due is on point for not disturbing others peace and doing things considering ppl around you.”Another commented, “Welcome to Canada, where immigrants get it all and Canadians with roots are the problem. Elbows up.”Others disagreed. “Go ahead and play your guitar then,” one wrote. Another suggested, “Just go nicely ask them to turn it way down or off… problem solved. Remember when adults used to have conversations and effectively communicate instead of whipping out their phones immediately to take a video??”","A Canadian man stirred debate online after criticising an Indian family for playing loud Punjabi music at a beach in Barrie, Ontario.

Marching in the name of legacy: Sikh regiment debate rekindled in Britain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/marching-in-the-name-of-legacy-sikh-regiment-debate-rekindled-in-britain/articleshow/123097673.cms,"Marching in the name of legacy: Sikh regiment debate rekindled in Britain





The debate over whether there should be a Sikh Regiment in the British Armed Forces has resurfaced but the ministry of defence (MOD) insists there are no such plans.The debate was triggered after Lord Sahota asked defence minister Lord Coaker in the House of Lords on 7 July whether there was any progress of having a Sikh regiment in the British Army, given the loyalty of Sikh soldiers in both world wars. Coaker replied, “Let me consider that request from my noble friend. I am quite happy to meet him to see what more we can do to recognise the contribution of soldiers such as Sikhs.” This led to UK headlines such as ‘Minister open to British Army Sikh regiment proposal.’But MOD sources told TOI, “Over the years, there have been conversations about this, but it would breach Britain’s anti-discriminatory laws. There are no current plans for a Sikh regiment as it goes against the Equality Act. We want to do something to recognise Sikh contributions in some way, but not through a Sikh regiment.”Lord Sahota, whose grandfathers served in the British Indian army, including the 15Punjab Regiment, told TOI: “I don’t think it would go against the Equality Act.”He pointed out the British Army has had the Staffordshire regiment and currently has the Brigade of Gurkhas, the Royal Yorkshire Regiment, the Royal Welsh and Royal Regiment of Scotland and so on.“It doesn’t mean other faiths like Hindus, Muslims or Christians wouldn’t be able to serve in a Sikh Regiment. If you are in the Royal Regiment of Scotland, it doesn’t mean you have to be Scottish.”.“We are struggling to recruit ethnic minorities in this country,” he said, and so having a Sikh Regiment would give Sikhs a “reason to join.” “They would wear turbans and have beards and it would reflect Sikh heritage and values,” he said.“It would foster a better relationship with other countries such as India and South Asia as well,” he added.There are estimated to be only 200 Sikhs in the British Armed Forces currently.“People tend to go into the army if their grandfather was in it. Sikhs don’t have that role model here,” Sahota said. He said if there was a Punjab or Sikh Regiment, they would have that role model. “There are more than 700k Sikhs in the UK. I am sure quite a few would be prepared to follow in their great grandfather’s footsteps. King Charles even told a Sikh soldier he wanted to see more Sikhs in the British Army,” the Labour life peer added.India-born Sahota (74) said he plans to meet Lord Coaker after the summer recess and will take Sikhs in the British Army and MPs with him.Preet Kaur Gill MP, who has met the armed forces minister many times, to raise the issue, said: “The ministers are looking at doing something. No decision has been made. It is being looked at. There have been existing Sikh regiments in the army. It’s not anything new.”The modern Indian army has a Sikh Regiment, which continues to recruit from the Sikh community and a Punjab Regiment. The Sikh regiment is one of the most decorated regiments and traces its origins to the first Sikh battalion raised by the East India Company in 1846.But veteran army reservist Captain Jay Singh-Sohal OBE is against the idea.“Even if they did this they wouldn’t fill out a regiment with recruits - we struggle with getting young Sikhs into the military as it is. A Sikh regiment isn’t going to change this and would become massively understaffed. A single battalion regiment requires 700 plus. A Sikh regiment will fail as it won’t get 700 plus young Sikhs joining. And if the answer is to look beyond Sikhs then what’s the point of a race specific regiment?” he said.“These British Sikh politicians need to make the argument for the benefit of Sikh specific regiments in the context of the threats we face today,” Sohal added. “It’s not about harking to past glories but about practical ways in which Sikhs today can make an impact through military service. I believe Sikhs do make an impact as we serve alongside those who represent Great Britain as a whole,” Johal said.“The Sikh identity is already recognised as a strength in the British Army and protected by UK law. We don’t need special treatment. We already practice our faith in the army. A modern army is about bringing capabilities and insights from different walks of life and backgrounds to create a synergy into a whole team setting. Sikhs can contribute a lot to that. Having a Sikh specific regiment won’t motivate more youngsters to join. What would, is if they see value in soldiering or developing themselves as a leader through military experience. I challenge Preet Gill and Lord Sahota to find me 20 Sikhs willing to sign up to the British Army right now, regardless of whether we have a Sikh regiment or not. They won’t be able to do it.”Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi MP, chair of the defence committee, which scrutinises the work of the MOD, said: “Given the extraordinary history, martial traditions and sacrifices of Sikh soldiers, especially during both world wars, I have supported the establishment of a British Sikh Regiment for several years, including meetings with ministers and other activists.""""While the campaign has not achieved success thus far, we will certainly continue to make the case"", Dhesi added."," debate over whether there should be a Sikh Regiment in the British Armed Forces has resurfaced.
