NEW DELHI: In a recent episode of The Ranveer Show podcast , Bollywood star Ajay Devgn surprised fans with his choice of favourite Indian cricketers.While host Ranveer Allahbadia labelled the pair of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma as an ""iconic pairing"" of his generation, Devgn went in a different direction, naming MS Dhoni and Rohit Sharma as his all-time favourites.When asked to choose a duo in cricket similar to his own partnership with filmmaker Rohit Shetty , Devgn responded warmly, saying, “Mujhe Dhoni aur Rohit dono hi bohot pasand hain (I like both MS Dhoni and Rohit Sharma),” highlighting his admiration for both players.Watch:Devgn’s praise comes at a time when India captain Rohit and Kohli find themselves grappling with poor form following a disappointing 0-3 Test series loss to New Zealand at home.Nevertheless, Devgn’s choice shows his belief in Dhoni and Rohit’s impact and legacy.In the IPL 2025 retention list, Dhoni was retained by Chennai Super Kings (CSK) at an uncapped rate of Rs. 4 crore.As the backbone of CSK and a fan favourite, Dhoni’s continued presence will offer stability and leadership, especially as he mentors young players like Ruturaj Gaikwad and Matheesha Pathirana, who are also key retentions for CSK.Despite his limited involvement in international cricket now, Dhoni’s influence in the IPL remains unmatched.On the other hand, Rohit, the former captain of Mumbai Indians , was retained at Rs. 16.3 crore.With Mumbai Indians securing stalwarts like Jasprit Bumrah and Suryakumar Yadav, Rohit’s presence means an experienced hand in nurturing emerging talents like Tilak Varma .",Bollywood star Ajay Devgn has named MS Dhoni and Rohit Sharma as his favourite Indian cricketers.

Maxey’s Injury Leaves Sixers Scrambling for Answers

76ers’ Tumultuous Start: Injuries, Suspensions, and League Fines

A Struggle for Consistency in a Season Full of Setbacks

Upcoming Games Bring Challenges and Opportunities for Redemption

Philadelphia 76ers’ guard Tyrese Maxey, who has been a standout performer this season, is expected to be out for several weeks following a right hamstring injury sustained in Wednesday’s loss to the LA Clippers. The 24-year-old has been leading the team in scoring, averaging an impressive 27.6 points per game, and his absence marks yet another challenge for a team already contending with injury woes and suspensions.Also read - ""Sixers Fans Call for Reunion with Markelle Fultz Amid Maxey’s Injury Absence"" After Maxey’s injury on Wednesday, initial evaluations suggested he would miss at least two weeks. Further assessments are expected, but the team is preparing for an extended absence, leaving Philadelphia head coach Nick Nurse in a tough spot. Reflecting on the injury struggles facing his squad, Nurse remarked, “Not very good luck. We’ve got to hang in there and still find a way to compete and play better.” Maxey’s absence could be a blow to the team’s momentum, especially given that he has also led the NBA in minutes played at 39.7 per game this season.Maxey’s sidelining is just the latest in a series of issues plaguing the Sixers early this season. The team’s All-Star center, Joel Embiid, has yet to play due to a combination of knee management and a three-game suspension handed down after a locker room confrontation with a journalist. The suspension came on the heels of an NBA investigation into the Sixers’ public communications about Embiid’s health, leading to a $100,000 fine for violating league policy. President of basketball operations Daryl Morey and Coach Nurse had reportedly made statements deemed inconsistent with the official injury status of Embiid, triggering disciplinary action.The Sixers are now 1-4 and struggling to maintain any consistent form. Their previous playoff aspirations are beginning to look like an uphill battle, as the team is without its key players and faces an unpredictable schedule of returns. Alongside Maxey, forward Paul George has also faced setbacks, having played only two games due to a preseason knee injury. “We’re taking two steps forward and two back,” Nurse commented, highlighting the challenge of establishing stability amid ongoing disruptions.Despite the setbacks, the Sixers will look to rally in their upcoming games, including a Friday night clash against the Los Angeles Lakers and a Sunday matchup with the Charlotte Hornets. Embiid is expected to make his season debut on Tuesday against the New York Knicks as part of the NBA Emirates Cup series. These games could offer the Sixers a chance to shift momentum if their lineup adjustments can spark improved performance.Also read - ""Sixers Fans Call for Reunion with Markelle Fultz Amid Maxey’s Injury Absence""","Philadelphia 76ers' guard Tyrese Maxey is expected to be out for several weeks.

A Proud Family Shout-Out

Bright Future for Bryce

As the James family gathered to support Bronny's debut in the G League, one member was notably absent. While LeBron, Savannah, and even Lakers’ management attended Bronny's big night at the UCLA Health Training Center, 17-year-old Bryce Maximus James was fulfilling a different commitment at Sierra Canyon High School's tip-off event. LeBron quickly dispelled any speculation about Bryce’s absence by sharing a video of his son dancing at the event on Instagram, captioning it with a proud “Ayyyyeeeee.”Also read - ""Sixers’ Tyrese Maxey Out with Hamstring Injury as Team Faces Major Early-Season Struggles"" With Bronny stepping into the professional spotlight, many expected the James family to attend his first G League game together. However, Bryce chose to support his school event instead. Captured dancing and energizing the crowd at Sierra Canyon, Bryce’s high spirits made headlines and went viral on social media. It’s a choice that sparked debate among fans, some believing he should have attended Bronny's debut while others praised him for focusing on his own path.The James family has faced intense challenges recently, particularly with Bronny's health scare last summer. After suffering a cardiac arrest, Bronny’s return to the game was met with relief and gratitude. In the Netflix docuseries, LeBron spoke emotionally about that moment, saying, “Shout out to the man above… To the whole coaching staff, training staff, members of that program, thank you so much. They are the reason Bronny is alive now and smiling and thriving.” Now on his journey into professional basketball, Bronny faces high expectations amid criticism of “nepotism” and doubts about his freshman year performance.While neither parent was physically present at Bryce’s event, both LeBron and Savannah showed their support on social media. LeBron’s “Ayyyyeeeee” was soon echoed by Savannah’s own post on Instagram, where she also shared Bryce’s dance with pride. Despite their absence, their virtual presence highlighted how they manage to celebrate all their children’s achievements, a challenge for any family, let alone one constantly in the media spotlight.Bryce’s dedication to his own basketball journey hasn’t gone unnoticed, with offers already on the table from colleges like Ohio State, USC, and Duquesne. ESPN’s Brian Windhorst has even remarked that Bryce might be “more naturally talented” than Bronny. As Bryce continues to refine his skills, some fans are speculating if he might even outshine his older brother’s early career in the future.Also read - ""Sixers Fans Call for Reunion with Markelle Fultz Amid Maxey’s Injury Absence""","Bryce James, 17, chose to attend Sierra Canyon High School's tip-off event instead of Bronny's G League debut.

It comes out at the last moment only.

NEW DELHI: Team India's decision to cancel their practice match in Australia did not sit well with cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar , who called the move ""beyond belief.""The team's initial plan included a practice match against India A at the WACA ground ahead of their opening Test match , which begins on November 22 at Perth Stadium.""For Indian cricket's sake (I hope) whoever has taken the call to do away with the warm-up game and then reduce the match between the first and second Test against the Australian Prime Minister's XI to two days will be proven right,"" Gavaskar wrote in his column for Mid-Day.Gavaskar stated that the batters needed the practice game in Australia, especially given their struggles at home against New Zealand.""To be fair, the Indians did score over 400 in the second innings (of the first Test) in Bangalore, but after that, in four innings they looked utterly clueless against a spin attack that by no stretch of imagination was so dangerous that India couldn't chase 150 in the fourth innings. Yes, there was turn on offer, but again the pitches were not impossible to play on,"" he said.""That is why the cancellation of the team's warm-up game in Perth against the India 'A' team beggars belief. There is no better feeling for a batter to spend time out in the centre and feel the ball hit the middle of the bat. No amount of net practice is ever going to replace that feeling of flow and bat speed that one gets even after a short stay at the crease.""Gavaskar emphasized the importance of playing in real practice matches over just facing bowlers in net sessions. He acknowledges that some may argue that 'A' team bowlers might hold back against top players in practice games to avoid injuries, but he points out that in the nets, batters often face less prepared pitches and bowlers who sometimes bowl no-balls without penalty.""Yes, there's a possibility that the 'A' team new ball bowlers may not go flat out because of the worry of injuring a key batter, but that's more likely to happen in the nets where the pitches are usually not as well prepared as in a match and where the bowlers bowl no-balls without any repercussion. The batters know that in the nets they can be dismissed three or more times and yet continue to bat and then play with no tension or pressure at all. So temperamentally, it's never going to be the same as playing in a proper match,"" he said.""For the bowlers too, getting into a proper rhythm with run-up and get confident about not overstepping is crucial. What line and length to bowl is also something that one can learn in a proper game and not in the nets.""","Team India's decision to cancel their practice match in Australia did not sit well with cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar.

It's a format that tests your skill and fitness, so I prepared for it with that mindset. So far, it's going great. In three matches in Jaipur, we got to bowl twice and that's a challenge. After a very long time I bowled 16 overs in an innings, and it felt great.There were two big injuries. One was a stress fracture in the back and the other one was in quads, grid-three tears. Twice I have dealt with back issues and have spent 18 months in rehab in the last three years. It's not just me, most bowlers go through it. But I feel the timing of the injuries was wrong. Anyhow, I am now confident about my body and everyone out there has faith in my skill.It will help me polish myself. It was because of injuries I could not play the previous seasons. Even last year at the time of the Ranji games I was in rehab and was not cleared to play the longer format.I trust my skill and that gives me the confidence to believe that I can make a comeback into the international side. The only thing I need to ensure is to get fitter and be available for selection. I can't afford to sit and brood over injuries. What I can offer as a seamer is something every team wants - I can bat lower down the order and can be very effective with the new ball. I am at that stage where my game has matured, and I have a sense of how to deal with different match situations. Next three years are crucial for me.I was not retained by them in the last mega auction as well. But they went all out for me and bought me back. I don't know what will happen this year, but I know my skill will be valued more now given the fact that around 90-100 runs are being scored in the Powerplay and that's why the teams are scoring more than 200 more frequently. I have proved how valuable I can be in limiting runs in that phase of the game.I think they will bid for me again. I would like to don the yellow jersey again and if not that, then I would want Rajasthan Royals to bid for me.",Deepak Chahar has played all the four Ranji Trophy matches so far for Rajasthan this season.

Remembering John Robinson: A football legend in college and the NFL



John Robinson , the legendary football coach known for his impressive success at the University of Southern California (USC) and in the NFL with the Los Angeles Rams , has passed away at the age of 89. The Rams confirmed Robinson's passing due to complications from pneumonia in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. A figure inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame, Robinson leaves a remarkable legacy marked by triumphs across both collegiate and professional ranks.Also Read: How Serious Is Dak Prescott’s Hamstring Strain? Cowboys Seek Second Opinion Robinson’s coaching career began to flourish at USC, where he initially led the team from 1976 to 1982 and again from 1993 to 1997. During his two tenures, Robinson built USC into a powerhouse, securing five conference titles and four Rose Bowl victories. His strategic approach led to an impressive 104-35-4 record with the Trojans, where his emphasis on a strong rushing offense helped running backs Charles White and Marcus Allen claim the Heisman Trophy in 1979 and 1981, respectively. USC’s statement proudly recalled that Robinson ""never had a losing record at the school."" Notably, his postseason record was also dominant, with an 8-1 tally in bowl games, underscoring his expertise in high-stakes matchups.After his first stint at USC, Robinson transitioned to the NFL as head coach of the Rams in 1983. His impact was immediate, as he guided the team to six playoff appearances in seven years, advancing to two NFC Championship games. Under his leadership, the Rams clinched numerous victories and established themselves as strong contenders in the league. Robinson became the Rams' all-time winningest coach, a title he held until Sean McVay surpassed him only recently. His time with the Rams saw iconic players like Eric Dickerson leading an offense that reached the playoffs multiple times.Robinson’s return to college football in 1999 brought him to UNLV, where he served as both head coach and athletic director. Despite taking over a struggling program, he managed to lead the team to only its third bowl appearance in history by his second season. His coaching prowess was evident even as he faced the challenge of rebuilding the program, a period marked by his celebrated 23-5 upset against No. 14 Wisconsin in 2003.Later, Robinson joined LSU as a senior consultant, working alongside Ed Orgeron, who had previously coached at USC. In this advisory role, Robinson shared his wealth of knowledge, contributing to LSU’s success while adding a final chapter to his legacy in the sport.Robinson’s influence extended beyond the field through years spent as a broadcaster on television and radio. Known for his wisdom, his insight reached fans and aspiring coaches alike. Robinson is survived by his wife, Beverly, his children, stepchildren, and grandchildren, and his life will be celebrated following the college football season in a memorial fitting for one of the game's true icons.In his hometown of Encinitas, California, Robinson’s legacy will be remembered fondly by fans, family, and colleagues who witnessed his passion and dedication to football for decades.Also Read: Marissa Mowry Shares Gratitude After Opulent Baby Shower and Her Journey With Trevor Lawrence","John Robinson, the legendary football coach known for his impressive success at the University of Southern California (USC) and in the NFL with the Los Angeles Rams, has passed away at the age of 89.

""Second year in a row for me here. I still want to get better. I still want to improve on a few things. We'll see how next year goes.""Rublev held to love in his first three service games. He won a 13th straight point on serve to open the crucial seventh game, but Zverev then won the next four to break to 15.Zverev did not allow a break point against his serve all match and converted immediately both times he had the chance.""I thought it was a very solid match from my end,"" said Zverev.""Andrey is an incredible player, but everyone who plays here is an unbelievable player.""Against anyone here, you have to play your best to have a chance, you have to be solid, mentally strong. I feel like I did that today, I felt like I used my chances quite well and I'm obviously happy with this win.""Earlier Alcaraz, the world number three got off to a shaky start to his maiden ATP Finals, making 34 unforced errors in an uncharacteristically errant display.""I'm tired.

I have no experience playing on indoor courts. I have to be better on this part of the year that we play on indoor courts.""It was Ruud's first victory over 21-year-old Alcaraz in their five career meetings.""I knew he was dealing with a bit of a cold. I saw him sniffling in the back area and with a tissue for his nose, so that's a sign that maybe physically he won't be necessarily at 100 percent. Of course, that is sad, and not good for him, but at the same time it is part of the game.""The Norwegian had suffered seven defeats in his eight matches coming into this tournament.""This part of the season has not been good for me but hopefully I've saved some wins for this week and I've started well,"" said Ruud, the 2022 finals runner-up.","Alexander Zverev beats Andrey Rublev at the ATP Finals in Turin.

'I am not facing any heat': Coach Gautam Gambhir

MUMBAI: Despite his recent slump in form, India's head coach Gautam Gambhir is backing seasoned campaigner KL Rahul to open in the first Test of the highly anticipated Border-Gavaskar series in Australia if skipper Rohit Sharma is unavailable for the opener in Perth due to personal reasons.Rohit has not travelled with the team, leading to speculations over his availability for the first Test in Perth, which will begin on November 22. According to reliable sources, Virat Kohli travelled to Australia a day earlier than the rest of the team, while vice-captain Jasprit Bumrah flew Down Under with family on Monday night. The rest of the Indian team travelled to Australia in two separate batches on Nov 10 & 11.Speaking at a pre-departure media interaction on Monday morning, attended by a handful of journalists, Gambhir hoped that the captain would be available for the series opener, even though there is no confirmation yet. ""At the moment, there is no confirmation. We will let you know what the situation will be. Hopefully, he will be available. But you will get to know everything at the start of the series,"" Gambhir said while clarifying that Bumrah will lead the side in Rohit's absence. ""Bumrah is vice-captain; if Rohit is not available, he's going to lead in Perth.""The head coach, however, clarified that there are sufficient options and a contingency plan in place if Rohit is unavailable in Perth. ""We have (Abhimanyu) Easwaran and KL (Rahul) there, so we will take a call closer to the first Test if Rohit is not available,"" Gambhir said.Rahul has endured below-par performances of late and was dropped from the remainder of the home Test series against New Zealand after getting out for scores of 0 &12 in the first Test against New Zealand in Bengaluru. Sent to Australia a bit earlier along with 'keeper-bat Dhruv Jurel for some game time, he failed to utilise the opportunity, managing to score just 14 runs (4 & 10) in India A's unofficial Test against Australia A in Melbourne last week.However, Gambhir backed the batter to come good. ""KL Rahul can bat in the top order, he can bat at No. 3, he can play at No. 6. So, you need quite a lot of talent to do all these jobs, and he has kept in ODIs. Imagine how many countries have players like KL, who can open, can bat at No. 6 as well,"" the coach said, adding: ""If needed, he can do the job for us, especially if Rohit is not available for the first Test match.""","Gautam Gambhir backs KL Rahul to open in the first Test of the Border-Gavaskar series in Australia if skipper Rohit Sharma is unavailable.

'I am not facing any heat': Coach Gautam Gambhir

'Transition or not, seniors are hungry to succeed'

MUMBAI: Despite their recent slump in form, India's head coach Gautam Gambhir is standing firmly behind veterans, skipper Rohit Sharma and star batter Virat Kohli , whose places in the team have come under scrutiny.As India prepared to leave for Australia for the much anticipated Border-Gavaskar Trophy-a five-Test series for the first time since 1991-92- Gambhir, in characteristic style, fired back at Australian legend Ricky Ponting for questioning Kohli's form and place in the Indian team, suggesting Ponting should focus on cricket in his country.Ponting had voiced concerns about Kohli's prolonged slump, noting that the great batter has scored only two Test centuries in the last five years. Nonetheless, Ponting also backed the former India captain to roar back to form against Australia in Australia, given that he loves playing against the Aussies, and has a great record in Australia.""What does Ponting have to do with Indian cricket?"" Gambhir questioned during a media interaction on Monday. ""I think he should think about Australian cricket. More importantly, I have got no concerns whatsoever for Virat and Rohit.""Kohli has averaged merely 22.72 in six matches in 2024, the lowest in his career. The 36-year-old has scored just one fifty this year - 70 against New Zealand in the second innings of the first Test at Bengaluru, while his last Test century came in July 2023 against the West Indies. Kohli scored 93, and Rohit 91 runs in the India's humiliating 0-3 Test series loss to New Zealand at home.When asked if the senior batters' poor form is a concern, Gambhir was quick to reply, ""Not at all."" ""They are incredibly tough men. They have achieved a lot for Indian cricket, and they will continue to achieve a lot in future as well. For me, the most important thing is that they still work really hard, and they are still passionate, they still want to achieve a lot more and that is something which is very important,"" he stressed.As a head coach, Gambhir is bound to have a sense of deja vu as he boards the flight to Australia. He was a part of a team full of veteran players, which crumbled and went through a complete transition after the high of the 2011 World Cup with a new coach Duncan Fletcher in charge.Asked if he was feeling the pressure like Fletcher, Gambhir replied: ""I am not thinking about transition but the five Tests. Transition or no transition, if that has to happen, will happen but I see some incredibly tough characters in that dressing room who are hungry to do well. The only thing in my mind is, we are going to Australia to play five Test matches.""Batting continuously for senior pros Rohit and Kohli , the former India opener said it was the media which was obsessed with the word ""transition"".""You guys can keep talking about the transition and all that stuff. For me, they are still very hungry. I am sure they have got a lot of fire to achieve a lot of success for the nation and you should never doubt their passion for the country,"" Gambhir said.Reflecting on his own career values, Gambhir said, ""I've told them to put the team above personal milestones."" When asked if he felt pressure following India's recent home defeat to New Zealand, Gambhir replied, ""What difference does it make? Tell me, social media, what difference does it make in my life and for that matter, anyone's life?Gambhir made it clear that when he accepted the job, he was aware that coaching India would not be an easy task.""When I took up this job, I always thought that it was going to be a highly difficult job and highly prestigious job as well. I don't think as if I am feeling the heat because my job is to be absolutely honest and there are some incredibly tough people in that dressing room who have achieved some great things for the country and will continue to achieve some great things for the country. It is an absolute honour to be coaching them and coaching India,"" he said.Gambhir admitted that he was open to the criticism following the New Zealand series loss, saying he's ""ready to accept it with both hands.""However, he expressed confidence in India's ability to tackle Australia's fast and bouncy tracks. ""We don't control what wickets they give. It is their wish, whatever they want to dish us with. We are absolutely ready to play in any kind of conditions and we have got all the bases (covered) out. What difference does it make whether they give us a turning track or bouncy tracks or green wickets?""",Head coach Gautam Gambhir says he is not facing any heat from media. Says he has 'no concerns whatsoever' for Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma. Says it was the media which was obsessed with the word 'transition',"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115198426,imgsize-85072,width-400,resizemode-4/115198426.jpg"

It's pretty obvious that they're prioritising the Border-Gavaskar Trophy Test series against India because I saw no promotion of this series,"" Gillespie was quoted as saying by the""Fox do a great job promoting, but it was pretty clear to us where CA's priorities lie. That's their prerogative and their decision, but I just didn't see any advertising, and promotion of this one-day series at all.""The fact it was behind the paywall as well probably limited the amount of advertising and interest in the series. The timing of it ... it's really difficult for administrators to schedule all the cricket in. But it has felt from Pakistan's perspective that based on selections and promotion of the series that their priorities have been India. Everyone can see that, it's pretty obvious.""He also said Pakistan were aware Australia would have a much-changed lineup in Perth with Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood, Mitchell Starc, Steve Smith, and Marnus Labuschagne all rested.""We knew that there was probably going to be some change, knowing what Australia have coming up. You always thought at the back of your mind were they going to send the big quicks over to Perth to play one 50-over game.""We anticipated that, and that's the nature of modern cricket and it's up to selectors and coaches to manage their players as best they can. Australia chose to do that. It was pretty obvious that this three-match one-day series wasn't the highest of priorities for Australia.""All we can do as Pakistan is play against the opposition that's presented and we did that really well. It was pleasing not just to beat Australia but beat them pretty convincingly. The reality is we should have won the first game as well,"" elaborated Gillespie.The Indian squad will strive to secure an unprecedented third consecutive series victory in Australian conditions.India have previously claimed consecutive series victories in Australia—first under Virat Kohli’s captaincy in 2018-19, and then under Ajinkya Rahane in 2020-21.The series commences with the first Test in Perth on November 22, followed by a day-night encounter at Adelaide Oval from December 6 to 10.The competition moves to The Gabba in Brisbane for the third Test from December 14 to 18, before the traditional Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground from December 26 to 30.The concluding Test match is scheduled at Sydney, beginning on January 3.","Pakistan registered a historic 2-1 victory in the series, marking their first ODI series win in Australia since 2002.

A new era begins at Manchester United as Ruben Amorim becomes the latest coach to take on the challenge of reviving the storied English club.After more than a decade of on-field decline the 20-time English champion has turned to a 39-year-old Portuguese who has delivered trophies and a thrilling style of soccer to Sporting Lisbon , but takes over a club that has made a habit of wrecking even the biggest reputations.High-caliber managers have come and gone, more than $1 billion has been spent on player signings, yet United just can't seem to get it right.""If anybody knew the answer (for that), we wouldn't have had the last 10, 11 years,"" Andy George, a 40-year-old United fan from Worcestershire, told The Associated Press. ""I always back the manager ... but it needs to work now.""George said he had been a supporter for 30 years and traveled around 100 miles (160 kilometers) for last week's 2-0 win against PAOK in the Europa League.Proven winner Amorim - a former Portugal international - was Lisbon coach from 2020 and ended its 19-year wait for the Portuguese title in 2021. He won it again in 2024 and his achievements led to links with jobs at Liverpool , Manchester City and Barcelona before he was hired to replaceErik ten Hag at the start of the month.""I'm not naive, I know that it's going to be very different, very tough,"" Amorim said Sunday after his final game with Sporting. ""But I feel that I'm ready. I'm at peace now, I can focus on my new job.""He is United's sixth permanent coach since club great Alex Ferguson retired in 2013 after winning his 13th Premier League title. Ferguson won 28 major trophies, including two Champions Leagues, and his record has cast a shadow over all of his successors.David Moyes was the first to try to step into his shoes, lasted eight months and began what has been a cycle of hiring, firing and reboots in an attempt to return the club to its past glories.Since then United has gone through Champions League winners (Louis van Gaal and Jose Mourinho), an iconic former player (Ole Gunnar Solskjaer) and one of Europe's emerging coaching talents (Ten Hag), but has not been able to stop City from dominating English soccer, while Liverpool, Chelsea and even Leicester have lifted the title in that time.High expectations United hopes Amorim will be the man to finally break the cycle.""We cannot ignore how he has changed Sporting,"" United midfielder Casemiro said Sunday. ""We know that Sporting won many titles, changed the club with titles, with trophies. He has already proved that he is a coach that has won a lot.""Amorim made a spectacular statement even before officially taking up his new role when, while serving out his notice at Lisbon, his team routed City 4-1 in the Champions League last week.""I was like, 'Oh, my gosh!' I lost my mind,"" said Joshua Hanley, a United fan from Kansas City who had flown to England to watch the PAOK game. ""We were changing airplanes and I'm sitting there kind of watching the score on my phone.""It was a fantastic start.""Amorim joked that he would be considered the new Ferguson if he beat City.Hanley's expectations are more modest to begin with.""If we can make top six, it would be a fantastic end of the season,"" he said, adding that he wants Amorim to ""make football exciting again"".New structure Amorim is the first head coach hired since British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe became a minority owner of United in February, assumed control of soccer operations and installed a new leadership team as part of his overhaul.Chief exectuive Omar Berrada was lured from City and sporting director Dan Ashworth came from Newcastle. Dave Brailsford, who helped Britain become a global force in cycling, is a director on United's soccer board.While Ten Hag was given a contract extension following an end of season review in the summer, he was appointed under a former regime. United's woeful start to the campaign - losing four of its opening nine league games - ultimately cost him.Amorim has the benefit of being chosen by United's new hierarchy and the final piece of leadership team assembled by Ratcliffe, which should afford him time implement his plans.Ambition Not that he is likely to get a free pass this season. The timing of the decision to fire Ten Hag could be considered instructive in terms of United's ambition.There have only been 11 rounds of the league campaign and Amorim takes over a team that, although 13th in the standings, is only four points off third place. It also remains in three cup competitions.Champions League qualification remains very much in play and after United spent around $230 million on transfers in the offseason, Amorim will be expected to quickly deliver winning soccer to a club that has been playing catchup for too long.In the long term, the challenge is to return United to the summit of English and European soccer - a task that has proved beyond any of his last five predecessors.",Ruben Amorim becomes Manchester United's sixth permanent coach since Alex Ferguson retired in 2013.

The match witnessed an early goal from Hugo Boumous in the fourth minute, while Manvir Singh found the equaliser for the visitors in the 36th, keeping the spectators engaged throughout the 90 minutes.Mohun Bagan had the lion's share of possession (61%) and 11 corners to Odisha's nil, but they failed to convert those into goals as the Kalinga Warriors dug deep to soak in the pressure and charge on the counterattack. Couple of good attempts by former Bagan striker Roy Krishna and midfielder Lalthathanga Khawlhring, aka Puitea, for the hosts went abegging as the scoreline stayed level till the final whistle.The hosts, Odisha FC, drew first blood when their midfield maestro, Hugo Boumous, found the back of the net with a well-placed right-footed shot from close range. The goal came after a set-piece situation inside the box, with Ahmed Jahouh providing the assist with a fine touch. The ball took a deflection off a MBSG defender before nestling into the back of the net, leaving goalkeeper Vishal Kaith with no chance of making a save.Odisha FC's resolute defence, led by the towering presence of Mourtada Fall, stood tall against the fancied MBSG attack, which had scored 12 goals before this encounter. The young Odisha backline thwarted the visitors' attempts to find an equaliser, frustrating their potent attacking force.However, MBSG's persistent threat paid off when Manvir Singh restored parity for the Mariners. The winger's well-timed header from the centre of the box found the bottom-right corner, leaving Odisha goalkeeper Amrinder Singh helpless despite getting his hands to the ball. The assist came from the pivotal midfielder Dimitri Petratos, who delivered a precise cross following a corner kick. Saviour Gama, who had conceded the corner, was stationed on the goal line but could not prevent the header from crossing the line.The first half ended with the scores level at 1-1, setting the stage for an exciting second period. Both teams displayed resilience and determination, with Odisha backline standing firm against MBSG's relentless attacks, while the visitors' defence remained vigilant to thwart any potential threats from the hosts.In the end, the tie ended in a keenly-fought draw.While Odisha FC will be pleased with their defensive resilience after conceding 13 goals before this game, MBSG will rue their missed chances to secure all three points. With one point from their seventh game MBSG consolidated their second place on the league table with 14 points while Odisha remained on ninth spot with nine points after eight games.","Mohun Bagan Super Giant (MBSG) and Odisha FC (OFC) played out an enthralling 1-1 draw in Bhubaneswar on Sunday.

The Wellington Phoenix supporters, known for their good humor, responded to Tiger’s unexpected appearance with a spontaneous singalong.“Who Let the Dogs Out” echoed through the stadium as Tiger continued his midfield adventure. Commentator Jason Pine, providing live commentary for the match, shared his amusement at the situation.“There’s a dog on the pitch, you don’t often see that — certainly not at this level,”“I think that might be Annalie Longo’s own dog! There are all sorts of players trying to tempt the canine.”Several players, including Annalie Longo, attempted to coax Tiger off the field. Eventually, he went to Longo, who promptly picked him up and handed him to a team official.“This is indeed the best league in the world,”The incident generated humorous comments on social media.“Wonderful movement and vision to avoid the defence. 8.5 match rating.”Canberra United's official Twitter account joined in the lighthearted banter, tweeting:“A-League is the best league.”Despite the entertaining interruption, Wellington Phoenix suffered their second consecutive loss of the season.Canberra United is currently in second place on the leaderboard.

Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz are set to further their emerging rivalry when the ATP Finals commence on Sunday, marking the first time in 23 years that the event will be held without any of the Big Three.Sinner, the top-ranked player, and No. 3 Alcaraz each claimed two Grand Slam titles this year, so a matchup between them in Turin would be fitting.In the draw on Thursday , Sinner and Alcaraz were placed in separate groups. Sinner will compete in the Ilie Nastase Group alongside Daniil Medvedev, Taylor Fritz, and Alex de Minaur, while Alcaraz will be in the John Newcombe Group with Alexander Zverev, Casper Ruud, and Andrey Rublev. The top two players from each group will advance to the semifinals following the round-robin stage.After withdrawing from last week's Paris Masters due to illness, Sinner arrived in Turin early to prepare. “For me, this is the main event of the end of the year,” he stated.Notably absent is defending champion Novak Djokovic, who withdrew on Tuesday due to an unspecified injury . This is the first year since 2001 that the finals will occur without at least one of Djokovic, Roger Federer, or Rafael Nadal. Additionally, this season also marks the first time since 2002 that no member of that trio has won a Grand Slam title.Djokovic holds the record for the most ATP Finals victories, having won seven times and defeating Sinner in the final last year. Federer, who retired in 2022, won the event six times, while Nadal, who will retire after the Davis Cup next week, was a finalist twice but never secured a title.“It’s strange not to see Novak here, given all his success,” Zverev remarked. “When I won in 2018, you needed to defeat at least two of the top three players. It feels different now. But with Jannik and Carlos emerging, the focus has shifted to new talent. You have to overcome them to win big tournaments. They've both won two Grand Slams this year and undoubtedly rank among the best players in the world.”As the sole Italian in the competition, Sinner will attract significant attention, particularly since this is his first home appearance following the announcement of positive drug tests earlier this year before his US Open title.The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) appealed a decision exonerating Sinner, and the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) is expected to issue a ruling early next year. Sinner expressed uncertainty over updates, emphasising his positive outlook despite the challenging circumstance.Alcaraz has defeated Sinner in all three of their official meetings this year and currently leads their overall head-to-head 6-4.Sinner's year started with an Australian Open victory — the first Grand Slam title for an Italian man since Adriano Panatta's 1976 French Open win. Alcaraz subsequently secured the French Open and Wimbledon titles, bringing his career total to four Grand Slams. Sinner later triumphed at the US Open. Notably, Sinner defeated Alcaraz during the Six Kings Slam exhibition in Saudi Arabia last month.Zverev, who has previously won the finals in London in 2018 and in Turin in 2021, seeks to claim his third title. Medvedev, the only other player in the field with a finals win, lifted the trophy in 2020.Zverev arrives in promising form following a title victory at the Paris Masters , which propelled him past Alcaraz to No. 2 in the rankings.Fritz aims to build on his maiden Grand Slam final appearance in New York, Ruud was a finalist in 2022, De Minaur is making his debut in the tournament, and Rublev is competing for the fifth consecutive year.The ATP Finals, featuring the top eight singles players and doubles teams, begins on November 10 and runs until November 17.The ATP Finals will be contested in Turin, Italy for the fourth consecutive year. The event will take place at the Inalpi Arena.Ilie Nastase Group: Jannik Sinner (1), Daniil Medvedev (4), Taylor Fritz (5), Alex de Minaur (7)John Newcombe Group: Alexander Zverev (2), Carlos Alcaraz (3), Casper Ruud (6), Andrey Rublev (8)Bob Bryan Group: Marcelo Arevalo and Mate Pavic (1), Simone Bolelli and Andrea Vavassori (4), Rohan Bopanna and Matthew Ebden (6), Kevin Krawietz and Tim Puetz (8)zverevMike Bryan Group: Marcel Granollers and Horacio Zeballos (2), Wesley Koolhof and Nikola Mektic (3), Max Purcell and Jordan Thompson (5), Harri Heliovaara and Henry Patten (7)The champion of the ATP Finals will receive $4.8 million, the largest prize in men’s tennis history. This amount surpasses the earnings from Sinner and Alcaraz’s Grand Slam victories this year, with Sinner earning $3.6 million for the US Open and Alcaraz $3.45 million (or £2.7 million) for Wimbledon.The singles and doubles competitions will take place in a round-robin format. The players and teams will play each other(s) once and the top two in singles/doubles will advance to the semi-finals.
