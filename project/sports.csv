MUMBAI: A 45-year-old social entrepreneur who ran a project for the state govt held 17 children, aged 12-15, a 75-year-old woman and his staffer hostage for three hours at a recording studio in Powai Thursday afternoon after calling them for auditions for a web series.The crisis ended after a police commando team stormed the studio following failed negotiations. Police said they shot him in the chest in self-defence after he fired from an air gun. He was declared dead in hospital.Police said Aarrya owned a company, Apsara Media, that directed awareness videos on social causes and had extensively worked with children.They said he had been holding auditions at RA Studio in Powai for the past five days for a web series he was planning. Thursday was the final casting call.Auditions began at 10am and the children—hailing from Navi Mumbai, Kolhapur, Satara, Sangli and other parts of the state—arrived earlier, said a security guard at Mahavir Classik, which housed the studio.The hostage drama played out after the captor, Rohit Aarrya, who had been living in a relative’s Chembur flat for the past few days, released a video saying he wanted “simple answers” to some questions and threatened to set the place ablaze if there was any move made to challenge him.In the clip, which was circulated to many media outlets, he said he was not a terrorist and only wanted “to be heard”. “Instead of dying by suicide, I have held some children hostage,” he said.The captor, Rohit Aarrya , was a social entrepreneur and project management consultant who owned a company, Apsara Media, that directed awareness videos on social causes.His social media profile showed he was an alumnus of Symbiosis International University, Pune, and had completed an executive MBA from ISB, Mumbai.He had worked extensively with children on the central govt’s Swacchh Bharat initiative, saying he was inspired by PM Narendra Modi’s plan for cleanliness in public spaces.Since 2017, Aarrya had engaged actors, including Prem Chopra, to enact short videos to generate awareness. He claimed actor Ramesh Deo as his mentor. His social media profiles contain pictures of ministers and a few celebrities.He said he had taken the children hostage “according to a plan”. “I really want to conduct the ‘Let’s Change’ programme. I am going to do it. If I am alive, then I will do it. If I die, then someone else will do it. But it will definitely happen,” he said.His tone then turned menacing. “It will happen with these kids only if they are not harmed. Because the slightest wrong move from your end will trigger me to set this place on fire and die in it.Whether I die or not, the kids will definitely be unnecessarily hurt and traumatised. I don’t know what will happen to them. If something does happen to them, I should not be held responsible.""Those persons should be held responsible who are triggering this unnecessarily, when a normal, common person just wants to talk. After my discussions are over, I will come out myself. I am not alone. I have more people with me. Many people have similar problems as mine. And I am going to give this solution only by talking. Please do not trigger me to do some harm to anybody.”Police spent nearly two hours trying to negotiate with the captor, Rohit Aarrya, and gauge his demands, but he refused to cooperate, even after one of the girls’ parents said she suffered from seizures, cops said. An official said he appeared calm when police spoke to him.City police chief Deven Bharti maintained that Aarrya fired first, prompting retaliatory police firing.“Regardless of his demands, we couldn’t let him play with lives. Our team fired back in self-defence. There was no other option.”Other officials reiterated that the safety of those held captive was the priority, adding that the team’s response was measured and as per the protocol. The death prompted calls by legal experts for a magisterial inquiry.","Rohit Aarrya, 45, held 17 children, aged 12-15, a 75-year-old woman and his staffer hostage for three hours at a recording studio in Powai.

What It Means for Atlanta

Thecould be preparing to make one of the biggest moves of the 2026 offseason, potentially acquiring. A trade for Skubal, whose projected market value hovers around $400 million, would form a dominant rotation trio alongside Chris Sale and Spencer Strider, instantly elevating the Braves’ World Series aspirations.Heading into 2026, Atlanta Braves’ front office - led by Alex Anthopoulos - is expected to focus heavily on both the bullpen and starting rotation. The bullpen remains the team’s most pressing concern after inconsistencies during key moments of the 2025 season.One key decision involves reliever Tyler Kinley, who emerged as one of the most reliable arms for the Atlanta Braves last year.“So far, he’s proved to be a steal. In 21 games pitched since coming to Atlanta, Kinley has a 0.41 ERA and a 0.73 WHIP over 22 innings of work. He’s averaging nearly a strikeout per inning as well. It was a low-risk gamble that brought high reward,” wrote SI’s Harrison Smajovits. (H/t: Sporting News)For just $6.5 million, the Braves have the opportunity to retain a quality late-inning option. If Kinley continues his impressive form, this decision could be one of the most cost-effective bullpen moves of the offseason.While bullpen reinforcements are vital, the Braves are reportedly eyeing a blockbuster trade for Tarik Skubal, one of MLB’s most dominant starting pitchers. Skubal has just one year of team control remaining, which could make him available if the Tigers look to maximize his trade value before free agency.HTHB’s Eric Cole highlighted the potential challenge and magnitude of the move: “Okay, this is the big one and also the toughest one to pull off. The Braves want starting pitching depth and there is a good chance that soon-to-be multiple Cy Young winning Tarik Skubal is available in the right trade.”Cole also suggested that a trade package similar to the one used to land Kyle Tucker last offseason could be a realistic starting point for negotiations.Here’s the revised and properly formatted table you asked for:While such a deal would come at a steep cost, the payoff could be enormous. Adding Skubal would immediately create one of the most fearsome pitching rotations in the league.If the Atlanta Braves were to acquire Skubal, their projected top three starters would be:1. Tarik Skubal – Cy Young contender, elite left-hander2. Chris Sale – Veteran ace with championship pedigree3. Spencer Strider – Strikeout machine and franchise cornerstoneAtlanta would be a nightmare for opposing hitters thanks to this trio's ideal combination of power, experience, and left-right balance.For General Manager Alex Anthopoulos, landing Tarik Skubal would be a career-defining move - one that could be remembered for years in Atlanta Braves history. It would not only reinforce the team’s championship window but also address the long-term stability of the rotation as veterans age.Also read: MLB trade rumors: New York Mets predicted to land $150 million Philadelphia Phillies star to bolster team and title chances As Eric Cole summarized, this would be “the toughest one to pull off,” but it’s exactly the kind of bold decision that could make the Atlanta Braves unstoppable in 2026 and beyond. If Anthopoulos pulls the trigger, this could be remembered as the defining trade that set the stage for another Braves dynasty.","The Atlanta Braves could be preparing to make one of the biggest moves of the 2026 offseason, potentially acquiring.

Smith's comment about thinking of Hailee Steinfeld while watching Josh Allen during a First Take segment sparked significant backlash. Despite his clarification that he was referring to her talent, viewers criticized the remark as inappropriate and a distraction from football analysis, highlighting the importance of professional boundaries in sports commentary.

Fans believe Stephen A. Smith crossed a professional boundary and they said so immediately

THERE'S SOMETHING MISSING for the Bills 🧐 Stephen A.'s thoughts ahead of Chiefs matchup | First Take

Meanwhile, Josh Allen continues to build his new era with Hailee Steinfeld

ESPN’s First Take rarely goes quiet but Thursday morning’s segment ahead of Week 9’s Bills vs Chiefs matchup became one of those moments where a single line from Stephen A. Smith completely hijacked the conversation. Viewers have gotten used to fiery debates between Smith, Shannon Sharpe and the rest of the table, but this time the noise wasn’t about red-zone numbers or defensive matchups.It centered around one sentence involving Hailee Steinfeld . Smith wasn’t breaking down Buffalo’s red-hot offense. He wasn’t comparing Allen to Mahomes. He openly admitted that when he watches the reigning MVP, “Everytime I see him, I'm thinking about his wife, Hailee Steinfeld.” The Internet didn’t just pause, fans unloaded.Yes, Stephen A. Smith clarified himself. He said it was about Hailee Steinfeld's talent, not attraction, “What an actress,” he insisted, praising her performance in ""Sinners"" and calling her “special.” But social media didn’t soften.Fans went straight to the comments, and their wording was brutal and unfiltered. One fan commented, “Thinking about someone wife is diabolical.”Another wrote, “Wild compliment of Allen's wife.” A third chimed in, “Every time you hear Josh Allen you think about his wife lmaoo yoo and then tried to qualify it bc her acting stop it.” A fourth commented, “The shout out to Josh Allen's wife was really weird.” A fifth wrote, “Hailee gotta sue at this point. ”This wasn’t the fun kind of NFL banter. Fans argued that even with context, the comment created a misalignment Smith was reducing an MVP segment into a punchline about his spouse.Allen proposed to Steinfeld in November 2024. They married this past March. She has been a consistent stadium-side presence this season and his box score doesn’t lie: 1,560 passing yards, 12 TDs, 261 rushing yards, 5 rushing TDs through seven games.Allen recently said, “Maybe that I am more than a football player,” explaining how marriage reset his perspective. Sports talk culture loves a viral moment, but this one wasn’t the kind Smith wanted.

Gisele Bündchen’s post divorce evolution raises question: did Tom Brady underestimate what letting her go would cost him?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/gisele-bndchens-post-divorce-evolution-raises-question-did-tom-brady-underestimate-what-letting-her-go-would-cost-him/articleshow/125015224.cms,"Years after her separation from Tom Brady, Gisele Bündchen's life has demonstrably recalibrated, not just continued. Reports indicate she has blossomed, building a fulfilling routine focused on inner alignment rather than external expectations. Her lifestyle and confidence have reportedly strengthened, showcasing a reclaiming of identity rather than reinvention, proving her purpose was never tied to public couple status.

Gisele’s lifestyle, confidence and routine were reportedly strengthened — not shaken — after the divorce

The narrative shift matters — she wasn’t rebuilding her identity, she was reclaiming it

Time has a way of revealing whether a celebrity breakup was simply messy or genuinely transformative and in Gisele Bündchen’s case, years have now become proof. What once dominated headlines in 2022, her separation from Tom Brady, has shifted into something that looks far more layered, intentional and emotionally mature than a typical high-profile divorce cycle.Back then, the story was framed as a stunning split between America’s NFL dynasty couple. Today, the story is clearer: her life did not just “continue,” it recalibrated. And according to PEOPLE reporting at the time, she “has blossomed” and built a full routine that has more to do with inner alignment than industry expectations. The split did not stall her, it rerouted her life into a more self-defined lane.In 2022, a PEOPLE insider had said she was “secure and happy, and so busy with her life that she doesn’t have time to dwell on the negatives out there.” That sentiment aged well. Even as public curiosity swirled around her outings with Joaquim Valente, her jiu-jitsu instructor, PEOPLE’s reporting noted it was a “close relationship, but not a serious love affair.”Translation: she wasn’t chasing distraction. She was centering herself.Bündchen’s own framing in earlier interviews backed that philosophy. She emphasized that authenticity requires partnership alignment, not emotional containment.Those quotes read differently now, almost like a foreshadowing of the version of herself she eventually grew into.The last few years proved that her sense of purpose was never tied to public couple status. The yoga retreats, the Gaia Herbs projects, the moments she chose to stay out of Hollywood red carpets and instead walk her dogs, these weren’t signs of avoidance. They were recalibration rituals.Long before the culture moved on from Brady’s retirement and roast-night headlines, she had quietly moved on from needing to be understood. She entered her 40s without panic, she entered them with permission.Not reinvention. Re-alignment.Also Read: “Obsessed with that kid kissing”: Tom Brady banned jokes about his son but let comedians roast Gisele Bündchen during Netflix roast","Gisele’s lifestyle, confidence and routine were reportedly strengthened — not shaken — after the divorce.

“Those songs hit her hard”: Blake Lively reportedly crushed after hearing Taylor Swift’s new songs as Travis Kelce helps fuel album buzz,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/those-songs-hit-her-hard-blake-lively-reportedly-crushed-after-hearing-taylor-swifts-new-songs-as-travis-kelce-helps-fuel-album-buzz/articleshow/125015013.cms,"A reported rift between close friends Blake Lively and Taylor Swift is causing a stir, fueled by speculation surrounding Swift's new album. Fans are dissecting song titles and lyrics, believing they allude to Lively, intensifying rumors of a fallout. This alleged distance challenges the perception of Swift's seemingly unbreakable inner circle, raising concerns about professional repercussions for Lively.

The album rollout raises suspicion as fans attach meaning to specific tracks





Why this fracture hits different in celebrity culture





Hollywood friendships have always lived in a strange middle ground, they look unbreakable when cameras flash, yet they can shatter just as easily under the pressure of personal choices, creative control, and the public’s hunger to connect dots. That is why the reported rift between Blake Lively and Taylor Swift feels bigger than a typical celebrity cold patch.This isn’t a pair of distant acquaintances, this is a friendship that once looked bulletproof, from Swift becoming godmother to Lively’s children to their quiet but consistent show of support for each other during their heaviest career chapters. But since the release of Swift’s latest album The Life of a Showgirl, internet sleuthing and lyrics speculation has made their silent distance impossible to ignore.According to Radar Online, “Blake is devastated – this isn’t something she can easily move past.” And that is where things become more layered. The speculation is not rooted in coincidence, Swift herself personally revealed titles like Ruin the Friendship and CANCELLED! on fiancé Travis Kelce ’s New Heights podcast, which only intensified theories before a single track was heard.“Hearing those songs has hit her hard, and seeing people online convinced they’re about her just makes it even more painful,” the source added.Add to that, fans believe certain lines from “CANCELLED!” read like surgical references to Blake’s year tied to legal tension with Justin Baldoni. It doesn’t matter that Swift never names her, the public is convinced the arrows are labeled.This isn’t just about lyrics or an album cycle. This story is ripping at a cultural myth: that Swift’s inner circle is impenetrable. In a celebrity ecosystem where reputation is currency, Blake reportedly fears the professional splashback, because Swift’s silent distancing doesn’t stay silent for long.If this friendship is truly done, the end isn’t loud. It’s subtle, strategic, and eerily poetic.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s choreographer exposes her past struggles — from stage anxiety to finding confidence with Travis Kelce by her side","A reported rift between close friends Blake Lively and Taylor Swift is causing a stir.

Fans read between the lines as Max Scherzer’s classy salute stirs talk of a possible goodbye

A moment that defined more than the game

When the Toronto Blue Jays and Los Angeles Dodgers faced off in a winner-takes-all World Series Game 7, it wasn’t just the championship that stole attention — it was Max Scherzer’s masterclass on the mound. Under the blinding lights of Rogers Centre, the Blue Jays ace showcased vintage brilliance, delivering 4.1 innings of sharp command, allowing only one earned run, and striking out three against a relentless Dodgers lineup.

Leon Draisaitl and Connor McDavid look to spark Oilers’ comeback



The Edmonton Oilers’ 4-3 overtime loss to the New York Rangers didn’t sit well with Leon Draisaitl , who questioned a key officiating decision that shifted the momentum late in the game. The controversy erupted when Rangers forward Mika Zibanejad high-sticked Jack Roslovic, leaving him bleeding on the ice. Despite clear contact, officials awarded only a two-minute minor penalty, sparking debate over the call.With the game tied 3-3, the Oilers went on a short power play that carried into overtime, but they couldn’t convert. Moments later, the Rangers scored the game-winner, handing Edmonton another frustrating defeat. What should have been a four-minute double minor became one of the night’s biggest talking points and Draisaitl didn’t hold back when asked about it afterward.“No, not sure. It doesn’t make a lot of sense, but yeah, it is what it is,” Draisaitl said postgame, clearly unhappy with the officials’ explanation. His remarks echoed the feeling among Oilers fans, who believed the team was shortchanged in a pivotal moment. The decision not only cost Edmonton valuable time on the man advantage but also stalled their late-game momentum.Still, Draisaitl didn’t blame the referees entirely. He pointed out that turnovers and poor puck management were major factors in the loss.“Just not clean enough with the puck. Turnovers just kind of turned the game a little bit. So yeah, just have to clean that up,” he admitted.The Oilers have now dropped three of their last five games, slipping to fourth in the Pacific Division with a 5-4-3 record. Despite standout performances from Draisaitl and Connor McDavid, Edmonton’s inconsistency and missed chances continue to hurt them. With McDavid and Draisaitl carrying the offensive load, Edmonton’s playoff hopes hinge on tightening their defensive structure and improving special teams efficiency. As they prepare for upcoming Western Conference matchups, the Oilers will need more discipline, sharper execution, and better focus to turn close games into wins.The Oilers’ upcoming schedule offers little room for error, with back-to-back tests against tough Western Conference rivals. These matchups will serve as a true measure of Edmonton’s resilience after a string of frustrating results.A stronger defensive effort and improved puck management will be vital if the Oilers hope to reassert themselves as playoff contenders. With Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl leading the charge, Edmonton’s ability to generate consistent offense and limit costly turnovers could define their playoff push. With the season still young, Draisaitl and McDavid’s leadership will be key in steering the team back on track before early setbacks start to shape their campaign.Also Read: Ryan Kesler sexual misconduct case: Meet the wife standing strong by ex-NHL star amid the scandal","Edmonton Oilers lost 4-3 to the New York Rangers in overtime.

Toronto Blue Jays catcher Alejandro Kirk has been one of the key performers in the team’s World Series campaign against the Los Angeles Dodgers, driving in crucial runs and proving his consistency when it matters most. After helping the Blue Jays win the AL East title for the first time since 2015, Kirk’s bat has stayed hot into the postseason, where he has already hit two home runs and driven in six RBIs in five games.

But it was Shane Bieber’s wife, Kara Bieber, whose fiery comment — “🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️” — turned the post into a viral moment overnight.Without a single word, Kara’s five-emoji reaction summed up both her excitement for Kirk’s performance and her admiration for Sofia’s unwavering support, sparking a flood of comments and likes from fans across the Blue Jays community.Within hours, the post became one of the most talked-about moments from the Blue Jays’ social media circle this postseason. Fans flooded the comment section, praising the show of friendship between the two players’ wives and calling it “the most wholesome Blue Jays moment of the year.” The exchange highlighted the close-knit camaraderie among players’ families — a side of professional sports rarely seen in such a lighthearted, genuine way.As the Blue Jays continue their chase for a long-awaited World Series crown, Kirk’s red-hot form has been mirrored by the rising visibility of the team’s wives and partners, who’ve brought a sense of unity and charm to the postseason narrative. Kara’s reaction may have lasted just five emojis, but it carried the same energy and warmth that Blue Jays fans have been rallying behind.

John Schneider fumes as Shohei Ohtani's extended warm-up after batting breaks World Series rhythm

Ohtani makes history as first pitcher in 50 years to record a Game 7 hit



Fairness debate resurfaces as Ohtani’s two-way brilliance stretches baseball’s boundaries

When the lights burned brightest in Game 7 of the World Series on Saturday, tensions quietly flickered beneath the surface. Toronto Blue Jays manager John Schneider was seen speaking at length with home plate umpire Jordan Baker right after the first inning, in a moment that fans instantly picked up on. His expression said it all — calm but clearly bothered — as cameras zoomed in during the short break before the second inning began.The reason behind the exchange wasn’t immediately clear to spectators, but it soon became evident that it centered around Shohei Ohtani — the Los Angeles Dodgers’ two-way sensation who was both hitting and pitching in the championship decider. Ohtani had taken extra time to warm up before taking the mound, a move that some felt disrupted the rhythm of the inning and gave him an added edge. FOX broadcaster John Smoltz observed that Ohtani’s warm-up lasted nearly three minutes, far exceeding the usual 90-second window allotted to starting pitchers.That timing discrepancy was enough to frustrate Schneider, who appeared to believe the umpires were allowing Ohtani too much leeway. Though the conversation between the Blue Jays manager and Baker never grew heated, it reflected the razor-thin margins that define a Game 7.Every extra second, every small allowance, feels amplified when the championship is on the line. Ohtani’s rare two-way presence has often bent baseball’s norms, but this particular instance — in the heart of the World Series — sparked fresh debate over fairness and consistency.Even amid the subtle controversy, Ohtani added another historic line to his résumé. The Japanese star became the first pitcher since 1975 to both start a Game 7 and record a hit, breaking a 50-year drought in spectacular fashion. His single in the top of the first didn’t drive in runs, but it showcased the balance of power and precision that defines his game. The Blue Jays, however, survived the early scare and headed into the bottom half of the inning with momentum intact.When Ohtani finally took the mound, he backed up the hype with dominance. He struck out two of Toronto’s most dangerous hitters, including Vladimir Guerrero Jr., before catcher Will Smith threw out George Springer attempting to steal second base. Springer’s bewildered look as he walked back to the dugout captured the frustration — Ohtani was dictating the pace of the night.While the first-inning tension subsided quickly, it reignited an old question in baseball: how should the rules adapt to a player who breaks every mold? Ohtani’s ability to hit and pitch in the same game, especially on a stage as colossal as Game 7, challenges the sport’s traditional rhythms.As the Dodgers chased history and the Blue Jays fought to hold ground, that brief pause between innings became a symbol of Ohtani’s wider impact. He’s not only changing how games are played — he’s forcing baseball itself to evolve around him. And in the process, even a small warm-up delay was enough to light up a night that already had the world watching.Also read: Shane Bieber’s wife Kara’s fiery reaction to Alejandro Kirk’s wife Sofia Castaneda’s World Series post sparks buzz among Blue Jays fans",Shohei Ohtani became the first pitcher since 1975 to both start a Game 7 and record a hit.

Each swing felt like a statement, each hit a piece of history in motion. As he slid safely into base after his 30th postseason hit, his teammates erupted, aware they were witnessing something baseball had never seen before.The moment Clement’s 30th hit dropped into play, social media lit up with disbelief and admiration. @14764Sairose posted, “Ernie Clement is killing it! First player with 30 postseason hits—amazing! Those celebratory slides and poses show his pure joy.Go Blue Jays!” @ChKamran92804 declared, “Postseason hitting royalty crowned.” @BabyDomRants shouted, “BEST PLAYER OF ALL TIME.”Another fan named @sfgiantsfan15 wrote, “Clement is a beast! The most clutch hunter in MLB postseason history! Let’s get it.” Meanwhile, @iamskrptd simply summed it up: “30 hits? That’s not human.” It was the kind of moment social media lives for — a perfect storm of record-breaking brilliance and fan-fueled awe.In Game 7 against the Dodgers, Clement’s line — 4 at-bats, 1 run, 3 hits, 1 stolen base — looked like another solid performance on paper. But that third hit shattered a ceiling that had stood untouched through generations of postseason greats. No Derek Jeter, no David Ortiz, no Albert Pujols ever reached 30 postseason hits. Clement just did. His approach was simple yet devastatingly effective — putting bat to ball with surgical precision and turning every at-bat into opportunity.Baseball fans will remember this postseason not just for the wins, but for the way Ernie Clement played the game — joyful, fearless, and human in the most unreal way. As one fan put it, “30 hits in one postseason is insane — man’s rewriting history in real time 🔥.” Whether or not Toronto lifts the championship trophy, Clement’s name is now forever linked with postseason greatness — a once-in-a-lifetime run that felt, in every sense of the word, “not human. ”Also read: Shane Bieber’s wife Kara’s fiery reaction to Alejandro Kirk’s wife Sofia Castaneda’s World Series post sparks buzz among Blue Jays fans",Ernie Clement became the first player ever to record 30 hits in a single postseason.

Timberwolves Struggling Without Their Leading Scorer - Anthony Edwards

Minnesota Timberwolves vs Charlotte Hornets Game Expectations (November 1, 2025)

Thewill once again take the court without their star player,, as they face the Charlotte Hornets on November 1, 2025. Edwards remains sidelined with a hamstring injury, an absence that continues to test Minnesota’s depth and resilience early in the season. His presence has been sorely missed, with the Timberwolves struggling to maintain consistency on both ends of the floor since his injury.Before going down, Anthony Edwards was in phenomenal form, averaging an impressive 36 points per game and emerging as one of the league’s top early MVP candidates. However, his momentum was abruptly halted after suffering a right hamstring strain during a matchup against the Indiana Pacers earlier in the season. The injury forced him to exit the game prematurely, and subsequent evaluations ruled him out for at least two weeks. The team expects him to be re-evaluated around November 9, with a potential return not anticipated before mid-November. The Timberwolves enter their second straight road game without Edwards, holding a 2-3 record. His absence has created a noticeable void in both scoring and playmaking. Head coach Chris Finch has emphasized that the team’s recent defensive lapses - particularly in perimeter rotations and closeouts - have been amplified without Anthony Edwards’ two-way impact.The Timberwolves have lost a series of close contests, revealing how crucial Edwards’ offensive efficiency and leadership are to the team’s success.Minnesota’s challenge tonight will be to find offensive balance while maintaining defensive discipline. Without Edwards’ isolation scoring and ability to generate shots in clutch moments, the team must rely on structured half-court sets and collective execution. Julius Randle and Donte DiVincenzo are active for this matchup and are expected to lead the charge, providing scoring options and veteran experience to stabilize the lineup.Despite Edwards’ absence, oddsmakers still list Minnesota as a -5.5 favorite heading into the game. This suggests confidence in the Timberwolves’ roster depth and ability to adapt under pressure. The matchup against Charlotte is expected to feature a high tempo, as the Hornets boast strong offensive numbers but remain inconsistent defensively. Minnesota may look to exploit those weaknesses through transition play and inside scoring, areas where Randle and DiVincenzo could play pivotal roles.The Timberwolves continue to monitor Anthony Edwards’ recovery closely, with evaluations ongoing and medical staff cautious about rushing him back too soon. His hiatus represents a major challenge for a team built around his dynamic scoring ability and leadership. As Minnesota navigates the early season without their young superstar, the priority will be maintaining competitiveness and defensive integrity until Edwards returns.Also read: Is LaMelo Ball playing tonight vs the Minnesota Timberwolves?

The teams are off to strong starts when the Portland Trail Blazers take on the Denver Nuggets at 10 p.m. ET on Friday. Meanwhile, Jamal Murray, the All-Star point guard for the Denver Nuggets, has continued to write a brilliant start to the 2025–26 season.However, his speed recently got halted as he was listed on the Nuggets' injury report with a doubtful tag. This is due to the soreness in his left calf before their NBA Cup game against the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday night.After losing to Golden State on opening night, Denver has won three straight games, including Wednesday night's 122-88 victory. On the other hand, Portland lost their first game, but they have since won three of four games, including two in a row.Despite spending the whole last game on the bench, Murray managed to play 25 minutes, which is the fourth most of any player on the club. He struggled with the same issue in the 2024 postseason, and it was evident that it affected him when he faced a physically demanding Timberwolves team in the Conference Semifinals.Denver announced their official report to the NBA on Thursday, listing Murray as questionable with left calf tightness. The team wrote on X:“Injury Report ahead of tomorrow's game against the Trail Blazers: PROBABLE: Cameron Johnson (Right Shoulder Inflammation) QUESTIONABLE: Jamal Murray (Left Calf Tightness) #MileHighBasketball.”Murray has put on a number of incredible performances and averaged 27.0 points, 6.0 assists, and 4.3 rebounds for Denver in their first four games of the season. However, a recent update from the Nuggets has raised doubts about his availability for their first NBA Cup game of the year.Given that Murray's amazing start to the new season was halted by a calf injury, Denver could be better off either keeping him out of their next game completely or thinking about limiting his minutes.Murray would probably face Portland's All-Defensive Team-caliber forward Toumani Camara if he were to play for the Nuggets on Friday night. This would be a one-on-one match that would require the 28-year-old guard to put in a lot of effort and use extra force in an attempt to get open looks.Murray has averaged 27 points per game on 50/41/94 shooting splits so far this season, which is comparable to his 2023 Western Conference Finals performance against the Lakers, when he averaged 30 points.He has only averaged 15.8 points a game in October throughout his career, which is significantly lower than his numbers. He's made significant progress this season in an attempt to earn his first All-Star selection, but the much-needed momentum he's established from the start could be derailed if this injury keeps him out for a while.Injury has been a major factor, and his persistent calf problems are also a worry. Throughout his career, he has struggled with left calf pain, most notably during the 2024 NBA Playoffs. His next chance would be on Monday at home against the Sacramento Kings if he is unable to play on Friday.Also read: Portland Trail Blazers Vs Minnesota Timberwolves (10-22-2025) game preview: When and where to watch, expected lineup, prediction, and more",Denver Nuggets face Portland Trail Blazers at 10 p.m. ET on Friday.

Halloween is approaching, but Kylie Kelce isn’t here for fans dressing up as her. On the latest episode of her “Not Gonna Lie” podcast, the podcaster made it very clear that impersonating her isn’t on the menu this year. Kylie’s message was blunt, humorous, and unmistakable — fans need to steer clear if they were planning to make her their costume inspiration. “I just need to say no one should fuc**ng be me for Halloween. That's a ridiculous costume, and you need to cut that sh*t out. Go ahead. So, now tell them how to not do it,” Kylie said during the podcast, setting strict but playful rules.Jason Kelce, former Eagles center and Kylie’s husband, joined the conversation and gave his own take, offering practical advice for anyone attempting to capture Kylie’s look without going overboard. He walked listeners through the key elements: leggings or sweatpants, a hoodie, glasses, and maybe a baseball cap if needed. “Um, some type of hoodie. Yeah, if you haven't put in your contacts, glasses. Perfect. Maybe a baseball hat. It's pretty much it,” Jason explained.Kylie agreed, joking that Jason “nailed it,” and added that glasses were the finishing touch to perfect the outfit. “You're good,” she said, confirming that was all fans really needed if they insisted on paying homage.Beyond Halloween costumes, Kylie also shared insight into Jason’s calm reaction when people confuse him with his younger brother, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce . Instead of reacting with frustration, Jason handles it with patience. ""That's like when people used to ask my husband, they'd be like, 'Aren't you Travis Kelce?' They would accidentally slip up on the wrong brother. And he would be like, 'Nah, it's not me.' I mean, that's it. That's all he would give them. And I'm like, 'I can't even fault you cuz you didn't lie.' Wasn't rude.

NHL trade rumors grow around New Jersey Devils’ Nico Daws



Jacob Markstrom’s return adds uncertainty to the Devils’ goaltending plan



Possible trade destinations and scenarios for Nico Daws



The New Jersey Devils are once again making headlines in the latest NHL trade rumors, this time surrounding young goaltender Nico Daws. After a string of sharp performances, Daws has proven he’s ready for consistent NHL action; however, with veterans Jacob Markstrom and Jake Allen also in the mix, the Devils face a difficult roster decision as the season progresses.The challenge for New Jersey lies in roster management and waiver rules. Once Daws crosses the 30-day or 10-game threshold at the NHL level, he’ll require waivers to be reassigned to the AHL. Losing a promising 24-year-old goaltender for nothing would be a setback, making a mid-season trade a realistic option for general manager Tom Fitzgerald.Nico Daws’ steady play has not gone unnoticed by scouts across the league. His recent outing against the Minnesota Wild showed poise and confidence under pressure. Further fueling speculation that the Devils might use his value in trade discussions, NHL insiders believe multiple teams are monitoring his situation. Particularly those struggling with goalie depth or injuries early in the season.The return of Jacob Markstrom from injury could significantly impact how the Devils handle their goaltending trio, Markstrom’s veteran presence and Jake Allen’s experience make it challenging to keep all three goaltenders on the roster, and with the Devils pushing for playoff positioning.Now, Daws could be the odd man out unless a suitable trade emerges.Teams like the Vegas Golden Knights and Ottawa Senators. The Buffalo Sabres could be interested if their goalie depth weakens. A trade involving Daws might bring back a young forward or a mid-round pick. For now, New Jersey seems patient, but if the market heats up, expect calls to start soon.Also Read: Latest update on former Anaheim Ducks star Ryan Kesler’s criminal sexual conduct allegations","The New Jersey Devils are once again making headlines in the latest NHL trade rumors, this time surrounding young goaltender Nico Daws.

Connor McDavid calls contract comparisons with Kaprizov “unfair”

Connor McDavid prioritizes winning over wealth in Edmonton

Edmonton Oilers captain Connor McDavid made it clear he isn’t interested in being part of any salary comparison talk, especially after signing his latest extension. The three-time Hart Trophy winner recently agreed to a two-year deal worth $12.5 million annually, keeping him among the NHL’s highest-paid players. But when conversations shifted toward Minnesota Wild forward Kirill Kaprizov ’s massive eight-year, $136 million contract, McDavid brushed off the comparisons.Known for his laser focus on performance rather than paychecks, the Oilers star emphasized that money doesn’t define his career goals or commitment to Edmonton. For McDavid, it’s about championships, not contract sizes,another reminder that his mindset remains firmly on winning, not competing in the league’s financial spotlight.Speaking to The Athletic, Connor McDavid made it clear that each player’s situation is unique. “It’s two completely different situations,” he said. “It’s unfair for people to say a bad thing about anybody. Everybody who plays in this league earns it. Everybody who makes money in this league earns that. It’s different situations, different cap situations, different teams, different constructs.”Rather than chasing the biggest paycheck, McDavid chose stability with a purpose.His short-term deal gives Edmonton flexibility — a rare move for a player of his caliber. While many expected the league’s most dominant forward to cash in with a long-term deal, McDavid’s focus wasn’t on personal gain but on helping the Oilers finally reach their Stanley Cup goal.McDavid’s decision comes after back-to-back Stanley Cup Final losses, leaving him determined to finish what he started. “It’s not a hard calculation to figure out,” he explained. “Obviously, the feeling was I was going to get some raise. The money they’ve gotten back is money they can go spend. That was the feeling.”Teammates have taken notice of his leadership. Defenseman Darnell Nurse praised the captain’s selflessness, saying, “He left a lot of money on the table. For us as a team, it shows how much he wants to win and his willingness to sacrifice for the group. That’s your captain leading by example.”McDavid’s extension may only run through 2028, but it sends a clear message Edmonton’s championship window is open now, and their leader is all in.Also Read: How Connor McDavid and Lauren Kyle quietly became hockey’s answer to Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen",Connor McDavid recently signed a two-year contract extension worth $12.5 million annually.

The New York Islanders bench Mathew Barzal for lateness



Calum Ritchie’s canceled flight worsens Islanders’ lineup troubles



Patrick Roy’s tough stance on Mathew Barzal was questioned



The New York Islanders wanted to make a statement about discipline and accountability. Head coach Patrick Roy benched one of his most dynamic forwards, Mathew Barzal, for arriving late to the team bus. That was too ahead of their matchup against the Carolina Hurricanes. The message was meant to inspire focus, but it quickly turned into a costly mistake.Without Barzal’s creativity and offensive spark, the Islanders struggled to find rhythm. That too against a surging Hurricanes squad. To make matters worse, the player chosen to replace him, Calum Ritchie, couldn’t even make it to the rink after his flight from Bridgeport was canceled due to severe weather across the East Coast.Barzal, a key figure in the Islanders’ top-six forward group, was a surprising scratch for the game. The team confirmed it was a disciplinary decision from Patrick Roy following the player’s tardiness. While accountability is important, the timing couldn’t have been worse. The Islanders are in a tight playoff race, where every point matters.Calum Ritchie, recalled from AHL Bridgeport to fill in for Barzal, faced an unexpected hurdle when his flight to Raleigh was canceled due to bad weather.That meant the Islanders were left without both their star forward and his substitute. This forces emergency lineup adjustments minutes before puck drop.The lack of depth and chemistry showed throughout the game. Carolina capitalized on turnovers and defensive lapses to dominate the scoreboard.Patrick Roy’s decision may have been rooted in enforcing professionalism. But it ended up drawing heavy criticism from fans and analysts alike; many argued that an internal fine or extra drills would’ve sufficed instead of sidelining Barzal.As the Islanders prepare to face the Washington Capitals next, Roy will hope his message has been received and not at the cost of another loss.Also Read: Latest update on former Anaheim Ducks star Ryan Kesler’s criminal sexual conduct allegations","New York Islanders bench Mathew Barzal for lateness ahead of game against Carolina Hurricanes.

Abhishek Sharma press conference: On tough Australian conditions, Harshit Rana's fight

NEW DELHI: Former Australia captain Aaron Finch has called on India to restore Arshdeep Singh to the playing XI after their four-wicket defeat to Australia in the second T20I at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) on Friday. Finch argued that India’s team combination leaned too heavily on batting depth, costing them both balance and bowling penetration.Speaking on JioHotstar, Finch said he would be “very surprised” if the left-arm seamer doesn’t return for the next match in Hobart.“Arshdeep Singh should be in the team. I would be very surprised if he doesn’t make it back for the next game,” Finch said. “One thing I’ve learned about T20 cricket — when you go in with too many batters, sometimes the responsibility gets diluted.”Finch elaborated that overloading the side with batting options can have a psychological impact.“Batters subconsciously assume someone else will get the job done. But if you play one fewer batter, it’s amazing how often the rest step up,” he said. “India clearly has the World Cup in mind, and this series is part of finding the right combinations to win that tournament.”Reflecting on the defeat, Finch praised Jasprit Bumrah’s opening spell but felt India lost control after the initial overs.“The first over that Bumrah bowled was really good and gave the Australian openers some headaches,” Finch observed. “But after that, Harshit Rana went for a bit of punishment, Travis Head did most of the damage early on, and then Mitchell Marsh joined in later.”He also felt India’s bowlers were left defending an inadequate total.“There just weren’t enough runs on the board for the bowlers to defend. It wasn’t a massive shortfall, but a few extra runs could have made things very interesting,” Finch said.","Former Australia captain Aaron Finch has called on India to restore Arshdeep Singh to the playing XI.

Erika Kirk, widow of MAGA activist Charlie Kirk , made an emotional return to the public stage on Wednesday as she joined vice president JD Vance at a Turning Point USA campus event at the University of Mississippi.It was Erika's first time speaking at the conservative event, since Charlie's assassination seven weeks earlier at Utah Valley University by a fatal sniper shot.Speaking to nearly 10,000 students, Erika talked about courage in the face of tragedy and shared that she had invited Vance to speak at the event.“When our team asked my dear friend, Vice President JD Vance, to speak today, I really prayed on it because, obviously, it’s a very emotional, emotional day,” she said. “But I could just hear Charlie in my heart. I could just hear him say, ‘Go reclaim that territory, babe.’ The battle’s already won. God’s love conquers. And that’s why I’m here today.”Kirk also spoke warmly of vice president Vance, who had helped carry Charlie Kirk’s coffin aboard Air Force Two from Utah to Arizona. “No one will ever replace my husband – but I do see some similarities in JD,” she said.Erika is now leading Turning Point USA, the group her husband founded.She described returning to campus as a “spiritual reclaiming of territory.”Thanking students for their support, Erika said, “You guys have no idea how helpful it is to have all you in my life … you make me feel even more connected to my husband. He didn’t leave us empty handed. He built a machine. And all of you are a part of that.”During the event, Vance also engaged in a lengthy question-and-answer session with students.The VP also responded to a controversial question about his wife Usha’s faith. He responded, “Yes, my wife did not grow up Christian. I think it’s fair to say that she grew up in a Hindu family, but not a particularly religious family in either direction.

Bill Belichick’s UNC stint and the chaos that followed





Halloween artist turns Belichick’s romance into viral art





Bill Belichick probably didn’t foresee his relationship with girlfriend Jordon Hudson turning into a public spectacle when he took charge of North Carolina. The six-time Super Bowl-winning coach joined UNC in December 2024, aiming to transform the Tar Heels into “The 33rd NFL team. ” Less than a year later, however, his ambitious vision has taken a strange and humorous turn — right into the heart of a Halloween display that has the internet laughing and talking.Bill Belichick’s first year at Chapel Hill has been anything but smooth. As the 2025 college football season unfolded, headlines shifted from his coaching strategies to his personal life. His relationship with Jordon Hudson, a former cheerleader and yoga enthusiast, became a talking point that overshadowed UNC’s disappointing 2-5 start. With narrow defeats to California and Virginia following a crushing loss to Clemson, the Tar Heels’ season already feels off-track.Adding to the chaos, Belichick and Hudson’s much-memed beach yoga photo — dubbed #Billates by fans — resurfaced just in time for Halloween. The image showed Belichick lying flat on a beach while balancing Hudson in the air with his legs. For many, it was an amusingly uncharacteristic glimpse into the usually stoic coach’s life.But for one North Carolina local, it was inspiration.Freelance photographer Travis Dove decided to turn that now-famous image into a full-blown Halloween yard display. Known for his creative annual setups — from the Paris Olympics to Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift — Dove found this year’s muse in Belichick. “It’s been fun to watch this dumpster fire,” Dove told The Athletic, describing the UNC coach’s rocky tenure.“The minute I saw the yoga pose picture, I said, ‘We’re doing this.’ I don’t even care if people have forgotten about it. I’m going to remind them,” Dove explained. “Because it was so out of character and so bizarre to see him behaving that way.”Dove didn’t stop there. He recreated another viral moment — the awkward CBS interview where Hudson interrupted a pre-recorded segment about Belichick’s new book. The display included two skeletons seated for the “interview” and a third, symbolizing Hudson, hiding in the bushes.For fans, it’s dark humor. For Belichick, it’s another reminder that his personal life and professional chaos have become inseparable — and now, immortalized in Halloween lore.Also Read: Throwback: When Tom Brady got real about parenting struggles and said modern parents ‘screw up’ their kids","Bill Belichick’s relationship with girlfriend Jordon Hudson has become a public spectacle.

While some fans praised her for her creativity and confidence, others found the outfit inappropriate, given the character’s roots in a children’s film.Many users echoed the sentiment that “not every childhood character needs a sexy remake,” while others defended Jenner, arguing that adults have long reimagined pop culture figures for costume fun.

Tom Brady called out modern parenting for overprotecting kids



Tom Brady opened up about fatherhood challenges



Parenting may come with joy and pride, but it’s rarely a smooth ride — even for someone as disciplined as Tom Brady. The seven-time Super Bowl champion last year opened up about his parenting struggles, candidly admitting that he’s far from perfect when it comes to raising his three kids. During Fortune’s Global Forum in New York City, the retired NFL icon spoke with striking honesty about the pressures of modern parenting and how overprotectiveness may be doing more harm than good.Brady reflected on both his personal parenting journey and broader societal trends, expressing concern that today’s generation of parents shields their children too much from failure. “Think of today’s world, how we screw these kids up,” he told Fortune editor-in-chief Alyson Shontell. “Every time they mess up, we send them to an easier place to succeed.”The father of three — Jack, 18, Benjamin, 15, and Vivian, 12 — shared that he’s made his own mistakes as a parent. “Being a parent is probably the hardest job all of us have and we screw up a lot,” Brady said. “And I’ve screwed up a lot as a parent.” Despite his fame and success, Brady admitted he’s still figuring things out, noting that he’s no “expert in parenting,” but someone who’s constantly learning and trying to do better.He believes that resilience comes from facing adversity, not avoiding it. Recalling his early football days, Brady shared, “When I was that long shot as a kid who was a backup quarterback, they never said, ‘Man, don’t do that, it’ll be too hard, think about another backup plan.’ They said, go for it—that’s probably my parenting style.”The former quarterback also pointed out that many children today are rarely pushed beyond their comfort zones. “They’re told they’re great; people coddle them; they never have to push beyond their limits,” he said, emphasizing the need for kids to experience setbacks in order to grow stronger.While Brady’s success on the field is legendary, he revealed that parenting has been his toughest challenge. The football star said he empathizes deeply with his sons’ struggles. “To be a boy, it sucks to be Tom Brady’s son in so many ways and I try to empathize that with them,” he shared.Brady acknowledged that his children face immense expectations due to his legacy. Yet, he remains committed to guiding them through their own challenges just as his parents did for him. “My kids naturally are gonna be faced with their own challenges, and they gotta figure out how to overcome them, too. And I’ll be there to support them a lot like my parents did.”In an era where many parents rush to make life easier for their children, Tom Brady’s words serve as a powerful reminder: the real lessons — and strength — are often found in failure, not comfort.Also Read: ""It Hurts"": Eli Manning’s adorable Halloween heartbreak goes viral after his son’s surprising Jaxson Dart costume choice",Tom Brady spoke with striking honesty about the pressures of modern parenting.

Jaxson Dart wins over the Manning family and Giants fans



The rise of Giants quarterback Jaxson Dart



New York Giants legend Eli Manning recently found himself in an unexpected role reversal — this time, not as a quarterback, but as the dad of a young fan smitten with someone else wearing the Giants blue. During ESPN’s ManningCast on Monday, the two-time Super Bowl champion revealed that his 7-year-old son, Charlie, decided to dress up as the Giants’ new star quarterback, Jaxson Dart, for Halloween ""Charlie's dressing up as Jaxson Dart for Halloween,"" Eli, 44, told his brother Peyton during the broadcast. Peyton, ever the teasing older sibling, couldn’t resist asking, ""Does it hurt? Does it hurt that he's picking another Giants quarterback over you?"" Eli’s reply was both honest and endearing: ""It hurts a little bit.""Eli, who played his entire 16-year career with the Giants, went on to describe Charlie’s dedication to the rookie sensation’s look. ""(Charlie’s) got the chain, which is nice. The problem is he's wanting to wear it. We got it last week, and he wants to wear it to school every day,"" he said with a laugh. The ""chain"" refers to Dart’s signature heart-shaped necklace — a good luck charm that’s become a recognizable part of his on-field persona.On Halloween, Eli confirmed his son’s enthusiasm with a post on X: “Charlie said he wanted to dress up as his favorite @Giants quarterback ever for Halloween… guess he got his wish.” The accompanying photo showed Charlie beaming in Dart’s No. 6 jersey, complete with headband and the iconic chain.When reporters told Dart about the costume, the rookie couldn’t hide his excitement. ""I think it’s awesome. I’ve met Charlie a few times. Obviously, I’ve been around Eli a lot, and yeah, I think maybe, like, he said he’s a little disappointed it wasn’t him. But it’s just a cool relationship, and I think it’s awesome,"" Dart said Thursday.The 22-year-old quarterback has quickly captured the hearts of fans — and now, the Manning household too. Since taking over as starter in late September, Dart has reinvigorated the Giants offense. In October, he was named the NFL’s Offensive Rookie of the Month after recording 10 total touchdowns and posting the highest passer rating (90.0) among rookie quarterbacks.The last Giants player to earn that honor was Odell Beckham Jr. in 2014 — and that season ended with Beckham winning Offensive Rookie of the Year. Giants fans are beginning to wonder if history might repeat itself.As for Eli, he may have lost his son’s Halloween loyalty, but at least Charlie’s rooting for the right team — and one quarterback who’s already proving he deserves the Giants’ spotlight.Also Read: Travis Kelce’s ex Kayla Nicole sets Halloween on fire recreating Toni Braxton’s iconic 2000 look","Eli Manning's 7-year-old son, Charlie, decided to dress up as Jaxson Dart for Halloween.

Anthony Davis’ injury adds to Dallas Mavericks’ frontcourt struggles



Dallas Mavericks set for Mexico City matchup amid adversity



Dallas Mavericks forward Anthony Davis has been diagnosed with a low-grade left calf strain and is expected to sit out at least the next two games. The team confirmed the update on Friday, just ahead of their international matchup against the Detroit Pistons in Mexico City. Davis, who left Wednesday’s narrow 107–105 win over the Indiana Pacers in the first quarter after appearing to tweak his leg, will be re-evaluated after the Mavericks’ road trip.The timing couldn’t be worse for Dallas, already navigating early-season inconsistency and frontcourt injuries. Despite traveling with the team to Mexico and taking part in light practice, Davis’s absence will test the Mavericks’ depth against both the Pistons and the Houston Rockets. Head coach Jason Kidd told reporters, “A.D. is day to day,” adding that the team remains optimistic about his recovery.An MRI confirmed that Anthony Davis suffered a low-grade strain in his left calf. The Mavericks’ PR team shared in a statement, “The Dallas Mavericks announced today that Anthony Davis sustained a low-grade left calf strain against the Pacers and was held out of the remainder of the game for precautionary reasons.Davis will miss the team’s next two games and be re-evaluated after the road trip.”The 10-time All-Star’s latest setback continues a frustrating pattern of injuries that have defined much of his recent career. Since being traded from the Los Angeles Lakers last season in exchange for Luka Doncic, Davis has struggled to stay healthy, missing extended stretches of action.He managed to appear in only nine games after the trade and has already missed time due to minor ailments earlier this season. Through five games in 2025, he’s averaged 20.8 points and 10.2 rebounds.Adding to the Mavericks’ concerns, center Derek Lively II has been sidelined with a sprained knee, while Daniel Gafford continues to recover from an ankle injury suffered during training camp.The Mavericks’ upcoming game against the Pistons at Arena Ciudad de Mexico marks their fourth regular-season appearance in the city, more than any other NBA franchise. “It is something incredible for the Mavs organization to come so many times. It shows how important Mexico is, and it’s great to bring enjoyment to the fans,” Kidd said.As Davis continues his recovery, Dallas faces an uphill battle in a competitive Western Conference, where every game counts. “It is going to be day to day,” Davis said. “But I feel better, that is for sure.”Now, Mavericks fans can only hope that the star forward’s absence won’t stretch beyond the two-game mark.Also Read: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander’s Oklahoma home targeted in shocking break-in while NBA MVP was playing against Washington Wizards","Dallas Mavericks forward Anthony Davis has been diagnosed with a low-grade left calf strain.

Police increase patrols as the investigation into Shai Gilgeous-Alexander’s house burglary continues



Shai Gilgeous-Alexander joins growing list of athlete burglary victims



Authorities in Oklahoma are investigating a burglary at the home of Oklahoma City Thunder superstar Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, which reportedly took place while the reigning NBA MVP was on the court Thursday night. Police were called to a property in the upscale Nichols Hills neighborhood around 7:45 p.m., roughly the same time the Thunder tipped off against the Washington Wizards.According to the Nichols Hills Police Department, the suspects had already fled before officers arrived. No arrests have been made, and investigators have not yet confirmed whether Gilgeous-Alexander lived in the house or disclosed what, if anything, was stolen. Police have assured the public there is no reason to panic. The incident unfolded as Gilgeous-Alexander led his team to a 127-108 victory, posting 31 points and seven assists in 29 minutes.Law enforcement officials confirmed that the burglary occurred in a residential area north of downtown Oklahoma City, where several Thunder players are known to reside. In a statement released Friday, the Nichols Hills Police Department said there will be a noticeable increase in patrol presence during upcoming Halloween festivities and throughout the next few weeks.“The suspects fled the area prior to police arrival,” authorities noted in their report. “While no arrests have been made, there is no reason to believe the public is in any danger.”The Thunder organization has referred all inquiries to local police, maintaining privacy around the ongoing investigation. The case reflects a growing concern across the sports world as criminals increasingly target the homes of athletes while they are away competing.The burglary at Shai Gilgeous-Alexander’s home mirrors a troubling pattern that has affected several high-profile athletes across the United States in recent months. NFL stars Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce, and Joe Burrow, along with NBA guard Luka Doncic and NHL player Evgeni Malkin, have all been victims of similar crimes.Authorities believe these incidents are often coordinated, with suspects choosing to strike on game nights when players’ schedules are publicly known. In many cases, burglars enter through rear windows or secluded parts of the property.The NBA has been proactive in addressing this risk. In November 2024, the league issued a memo to all teams advising players to tighten home security.
