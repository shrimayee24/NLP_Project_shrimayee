Royal Challengers Bengaluru win IPL 2025 final



Why Sanskrit phrase still shines on the IPL trophy



Why IPL winners don’t keep the original cup







Since its inception in 2008, the Indian Premier League (IPL) has evolved into more than just a cricket tournament; it embodies the intersection of talent, ambition, and opportunity. Amidst the glitz, cheering crowds, and nail-biting matches, one subtle detail often escapes notice: the Sanskrit inscription etched onto the IPL trophy. The line written in Sanskrit quietly encapsulates the very spirit of the league, reflecting its mission to provide a grand stage for emerging players to shine and transform their lives through the power of performance.In 2025, the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) ended their long drought and won their inaugural IPL title, becoming the 8th title-winning team after 18 long years. However, as the camera panned over the trophy during the celebrations, fans might have caught sight of an etched line in Roman script (English letters) that stood out from the rest in terms of its age in comparison with glitz around it.The line states:Though the trophy has undergone transformations over the years, this Sanskrit phrase has been consistent subtly affirming values IPL believes in.The phrase translates to:This line isn't merely ornamented—it's philosophical and deliberate.It captures the spirit of what IPL seeks to do: providing untapped talent the opportunity to shine on the biggest platform.As per a top IPL official:Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) won their first-ever IPL title by beating Punjab Kings (PBKS) by 6 runs in the 2025 final at Ahmedabad's Narendra Modi Stadium. In a battle between two teams that had never won the IPL, it was Rajat Patidar's RCB that kept their cool to defend a target of 191 on a demanding pitch.The win also saw a long-awaited victory for Virat Kohli, whose unwavering quest for the IPL title had finally been realised. Earlier in the season, RCB had become the first team in IPL history to win all away games in a season. They had placed second in the league standings behind Punjab but then defeated PBKS twice during the playoffs - once in the qualifier and again in the final - to secure a historic title push.Sanskrit, as an ancient language, has timeless wisdom. Inscribing a line of Sanskrit on the IPL trophy was a symbolic gesture by the organisers—paying homage to India's cultural heritage while commemorating an event followed by the world.Inscribing it in Roman script rather than Devanagari makes it readable by an international audience, yet maintaining its Indian essence.""It proves that tradition and modernity exist together. That the principles of ancient India are still relevant even in a flashy, commercialised league like the IPL,"" opined a sports culture historian.The IPL is a live party to ""Yatra Pratibha Avsara Prapnotihi."" Hundreds of cricketers have climbed from anonymity to fame due to their performances in the tournament.Surprisingly, the original IPL trophy is not kept by the winning team. After the last match, it was returned to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). The champions do receive a replica to put on display, but the actual trophy stays with the BCCI as an ongoing honour. Also, the same trophy is used every year—with the name of the new champion inscribed after each season. Only when space gets exhausted on the current one is a new trophy commissioned.",Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) won their first-ever IPL title by beating Punjab Kings (PBKS) by 6 runs in the 2025 final at Ahmedabad's Narendra Modi Stadium.

Complaint Filed Against Virat Kohli Over Bengaluru Stampede | RCB | IPL | Karnataka

BENGALURU: Three days after a stampede outside M Chinnaswamy Stadium killed 11 peopleat RCB's IPL win celebration, it emerged that senior police officer MN Karibasavana Gowda had red-flagged the risks just before the event. His written warning to top bureaucrats on June 4, the day of the tragedy, also cautioned against the felicitation at Vidhana Soudha.""Lakhs of cricket fans are likely to come to Vidhana Soudha. Since there is a shortage of security personnel, making bandobast will be a problem,"" Gowda, in-charge of security at the legislature, wrote to department of personnel and administrative reforms secretary G Sathyavathi.In the letter, which TOI is in possession of, Gowda also pointed to the venue's sensitive status and lack of adequate CCTV coverage.Hours before the surge, department of personnel and administrative reforms secretary and senior IAS officer G Sathyavathi, overseeing arrangements at Vidhana Soudha steps, publicly urged fans to head to the stadium instead - a short distance away. The team was feted at the legislature and the celebrations then moved on to the stadium. But fears of overcrowding had set in well in advance.Despite the warning, RCB's IPL victory celebrations were allegedly rushed through - less than 24 hours after the final match - without proper crowd control or safety protocols.Sources said the DCP's note was also shared with then Bengaluru police commissioner B Dayananda, who in turn flagged it to chief secretary Shalini Rajneesh. But permissions were still granted.Adding fuel to the political fire, Union minister and JD(S) functionary HD Kumaraswamy alleged Saturday that the celebrations were ""pre-planned"" even before RCB won. ""The FIR says permission for the June 4 event was sought on June 3 at 6pm - 90 minutes before the final even began. Did they dream about winning?"" he asked, demanding accountability from CM Siddaramaiah , deputy CM DK Shivakumar, and home minister G Parameshwara.He questioned the need for a felicitation so soon. ""Was such a slipshod felicitation needed? Who put pressure on the police commissioner at 7.30am that day for permission?""BJP's Bangalore North MP and Union minister Shobha Karandlaje echoed the outrage, calling it a ""misuse of govt space"". ""The grand stairs of Vidhana Soudha have always been used for swearing-in or state functions. You used it for a private team,"" she said.Accusing the Congress brass, Karandlaje said: ""Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar have blood on their hands. Now they're trying to wipe it on police officers.

Raiders’ Patrick Mahomes trade whisper sends NFL fans into frenzy—GM’s comments ignite firestorm over league ethics,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/raiders-patrick-mahomes-trade-whisper-sends-nfl-fans-into-frenzygms-comments-ignite-firestorm-over-league-ethics/articleshow/121688972.cms,"The Las Vegas Raiders, haunted by Patrick Mahomes' dominance (Getty Images)

Raiders risked it all for Patrick Mahomes? Insider bombshell rattles AFC West





For years, the Las Vegas Raiders have lived a recurring nightmare: Patrick Mahomes. Twice a season, they face the architect of their AFC West woes, a quarterback who has single-handedly carved out a dynasty in Kansas City and consistently left the Silver and Black in his wake. His dominance – 12 wins in 14 outings against Las Vegas, racking up over 4,000 passing yards and 33 touchdowns – has pushed the Raiders to the brink in their quest for a franchise quarterback. But how far were they willing to go to escape Mahomes' shadow? Could they, against all odds, have ever considered acquiring him?Raiders GM John Spytek recently gave an honest account of the team's rigorous two-year hunt for a starting quarterback. He confirmed their absolute commitment.""Pete [Carroll] and I were completely serious,"" Spytek stated, ""when we said we'd explore every possible avenue for a quarterback."" This intensive search, he shared, involved bold inquiries. ""We contacted various teams just to gauge interest,"" he admitted, jokingly adding, ""I'd be hesitant to even mention some of the names we inquired about trading for, but you never know.”Naturally, the burning question from reporters was immediate: did this wide-ranging dragnet extend to Chiefs General Manager Brett Veach? In a league where ""desperate times call for desperate measures,"" the idea of somehow luring Mahomes away from their bitter rivals – if you couldn't beat him, why not join him, right? – might seem like a fleeting fantasy for a beleaguered fanbase.However, Spytek quickly squashed any such speculation. ""We didn't go that far, you know?"" he admitted, acknowledging the sheer implausibility of such a blockbuster, intra-division trade. The notion of Chiefs' Patrick Mahomes donning the Silver and Black, while perhaps a tantalizing dream for some, was never a realistic avenue for the Raiders' front office.Eventually, Spytek and Coach Pete Carroll's deep search led them to veteran quarterback Geno Smith from the Seahawks via trade. Spytek expressed confidence, noting Smith's strong performance and history with Carroll. ""With Geno in particular, Pete has a history with him, and he's played his best football for Pete,"" Spytek stated. ""And he played well last year, too.”The cost of securing Smith's services was substantial, involving a third-round draft pick and the absorption of the $75 million remaining on his contract. Even with the team's disappointing 4-13 finish last season, Spytek maintains a positive outlook on the team's trajectory under Smith's leadership. He stated, ""It's a work in progress, but he's been awesome so far.""Also Read: “Got hammered on a f**king boat”: Julian Edelman and Rob Gronkowski call out Tom Brady for being a lame teammate off the field The Raiders still face the challenge of Patrick Mahomes, but their plan is clear.

Time will tell if Smith brings the stability needed to contend with the division's top team.","The Las Vegas Raiders have been haunted by Patrick Mahomes' dominance.

Allen Iverson shares posts dedicated to son Isaiah Rahsaan Iverson and wife Tawanna Turner





Former NBA legend, Allen Iverson shares a heartwarming post for his son, Isaiah Rahsaan Iverson on his Instagram. The post contains photos from Isaiah’s childhood, teenage years, and graduation ceremony. Allen went on to praise him saying that he’s the true definition of what a son should be, and the way he always looks out for family is what makes him better than others. He goes on to say how proud of a father he is. However, this post came days after Allen dedicated an entire post for ex-wife, Tawanna Turner.Allen Iverson talks profoundly about his son Isaiah on his recent Instagram post. He talks about Isaiah’s qualities and how he is a son that every father will be proud of.“The true definition of a son,” says Allen as he starts the post, showing how proud he is of Isaiah.Iverson further went on to say how Isaiah takes care of his mother and siblings, and never disrespects his parents. He also went on to say that Isaiah always puts family first and takes responsibility heads on. From his post it seems after Allen and Tawanna separated, it was Isaiah who put on the ""head of the family"" tag and took good care of the family.However, this post comes days after Allen dedicated an entire post to ex-wife Tawanna Turner, with whom he shares five children, Allen Iverson II, Isaiah Rahsaan Iverson, Dream Alijha, Tiaura, and Messiah Lauren. The post had a montage of the couple’s photos from prom, early court days, and as such. Allen captioned the photo as “HER” followed by heart and crossed fingers emoticons.Allen and Tawanna tied the knot in 2001, and had a happy marriage for quite some years. However, trouble entered their married life in the form of lavish expenditures, Iverson’s questionable parenting skills, and alcohol habits. In 2013, when Iverson retired from the world of NBA, his married life also came to an end. The couple called it quits in 2013 and agreed to co-parent their kids. Their divorce made headlines back in 2013 due to all the chaos it unraveled. With Iverson being officially bankrupt and declaring in the court that he doesn't even have money for a cheeseburger to Tawanna literally pulling out $61 from her purse and giving it to the NBA legend, the couple has seen it all. Tawanna has been Iverson's rock through all ups and down, and they still remained friends after the divorce. Iverson even gave a special shoutout to Tawanna in his Hall of Fame speech in 2016.However, it seems Allen’s life turned upside down soon after his lady luck left. After retirement, Allen spent all of his fortune on expensive cars, and lavish lifestyle. Due to this, he became bankrupt by 2015. Despite getting into the Hall of Fame in 2016, life was still in shambles for Iverson. The once NBA legend was back in square one, starting from scratch.Allen was at his top during his time with the Philadelphia 76ers, when he won the MVP of the year in 2001. He also went on to win the Rookie of the Year award in 1997. During the Game 1 of NBA Finals of 2001, Iverson scored 48 points against the Los Angeles Lakers, which was a record in itself. It was during this time that Iverson was the peak of his career, after which his life took a complete 180-degree turn.However, things have started taking turn for Iverson as he recently signed a deal with Reebok and agreed to be the Vice President of basketball division for the brand. He had earlier made a lifetime deal with Reebok back in 2001, which brought him $800,000 per year. The contract also had a clause that stated Iverson will get an additional $32 million at the age of 55. Will the new role help Iverson turn the course of events or will he fall back into old habits? It remains to be seen.Also Read: Carmelo Anthony spilled beans on weirdest reason why Larry Brown suspended LeBron James, Allen Iverson, and Amar’e Stoudemire just before Olympics","NBA legend Allen Iverson shares heartfelt post on his son days after making sweet gesture towards ex-wife.

Wayne Gretzky, the face of hockey greatness, has ignited a fierce debate that goes beyond the ice rink—one that’s raising eyebrows across NHL circles and beyond. While appearing on The Pat McAfee Show, ""The Great One"" opened up about the financial disparities in the league, taking subtle aim at how no-state-income-tax franchises like the Florida Panthers might be gaining an upper hand in the talent war.Speaking candidly, Wayne Gretzky stated, “Obviously Florida and Tampa Bay is a unique situation…from a financial point of view, if that’s what a player’s thinking about, obviously, but if a player’s thinking, you know, what I want to play in a hockey culture, like playing and living in the city of Edmonton, I loved it for 10 years.”Gretzky’s words struck a chord—highlighting the growing tension between market-driven decisions and hockey's traditional roots. While Florida teams like the Panthers can offer higher take-home pay due to their tax structure, cities like Edmonton offer something money can’t buy: fan intensity and legacy.The Panthers’ on-ice success, including multiple Stanley Cup Final runs, has coincided with the state’s tax-friendly policies, allowing the team to recruit and retain talent without overspending. That advantage, though legal, raises a question of fairness. Could this be undermining the NHL’s competitive balance?Wayne Gretzky didn’t directly accuse teams of exploiting the tax loophole—but his tone was clear.When discussing Edmonton, he reflected, “You leave the arena in Edmonton, you know you’ve been in a hockey game…1.3 million have watched that game and the other 200,000…the only reason they didn’t is because they were working.”In response to the buzz, Panthers head coach Paul Maurice emphasized the area’s growing sports culture and praised efforts to build community over competition. “I think there’s room for all of us down here…So how about we just share it? We share the spotlight,” he said.Maurice also lauded GM Bill Zito’s cross-sport cooperation with the Dolphins and Marlins, saying, “Bill’s been kind of involved.

Aaron Judge proves 2017 critics wrong with historic rise over Andrew Benintendi

Aaron Judge’s rise to greatness over Andrew Benintendi





Back in 2017, a comparison was made between two of the best rookie players in baseball- Andrew Benintendi of the Boston Red Sox and Aaron Judge of the New York Yankees. At that time, one well-known columnist chose Benintendi over Judge for the future. Eight years later, the numbers and career paths show a very different picture.On August 21, 2017, a column published in The Boston Globe favored Andrew Benintendi over Aaron Judge as the better long-term pick. The writer pointed to their head-to-head matchups that season. In their first 15 games against each other, Benintendi had better results: 4 home runs and 12 RBIs, while Judge hit just .155 with 1 home run and 2 RBIs against the Red Sox.Benintendi was thought to be a powerful all-round performer at the time. During the 2018 ALCS versus the Houston Astros, he had already made a significant contribution by making a critical catch that enabled the Red Sox to win the series and afterward the World Series. Boston had Aaron Judge five seasons before he was dealt to the Kansas City Royals in February 2021.In 2022, he was subsequently chosen to be an All-Star.Benintendi inked a five-year, $75 million contract with the Chicago White Sox in 2023. That season turned bad, though, as the club lost 121 games. Although not quite elite, Benintendi is a good hitter with a career average of .269 as of the moment.Also Read: Aaron Judge Breaks Century-Old Unbelievable Record Beating Mantle Gehrig And Hornsby In Epic Chase Aaron Judge, meanwhile, has developed into of the most well-known players in baseball.

In 2023, he had 58 home runs, 144 RBIs, and a.322 average.Leading the league in several areas, batting average, on-base percentage, slugging, and total bases, Judge is set to do so in 2025. He is on course to have the greatest slugging season since Babe Ruth as of June. Judge honestly accepted culpability and vowed to bounce back stronger even after a critical mistake in Game 5 of the 2024 World Series.","Aaron Judge proves 2017 critics wrong with historic rise over Andrew Benintendi.

Why Browns are thinking about Kirk Cousins for QB

Cleveland Browns TRADE for Kirk Cousins? ESPN proposes wild deal to shake up Browns QB room





The Cleveland Browns are heading into 2025 with a big question mark at quarterback. With Deshaun Watson out after Achilles surgery, the team’s current options—Kenny Pickett, Joe Flacco, Dillon Gabriel, and Shedeur Sanders—offer potential but no clear answer. Now, talk is heating up about trading for veteran Kirk Cousins. He might be the solution the Browns are looking for or a costly risk they can’t afford.Watson’s injury has thrown the Browns into a tricky spot. GM Andrew Berry’s off-season moves brought in four quarterbacks, each with their own strengths, but none have proven they can consistently lead a team hungry for success. Pickett and Flacco have some experience, but questions remain about their ability to perform week in and week out. Meanwhile, Gabriel and Sanders are young and promising but unproven in the NFL.That’s where Kirk Cousins comes in. The 36-year-old veteran, currently the backup in Atlanta behind Michael Penix Jr., is eager for a starting role. USA TODAY’s Jacob Camenker believes Cousins could be the ideal short-term solution for the Browns, a steady veteran to guide the team while the younger quarterbacks develop. Cousins has a solid track record and knows how to work within a good offense, making him an appealing option.But there’s a catch. Cousins’ salary is hefty, he’s part of a $180 million contract that would be tough for the Browns to take on, especially with Watson’s large contract still on the books. The team would have to make some serious financial moves to fit him in, and with Berry and coach Kevin Stefanski both under pressure to deliver, the stakes couldn’t be higher.The situation is further complicated by the Falcons’ reluctance to trade Cousins. His absence from recent team activities hints he’s frustrated and pushing for a move, but Atlanta hasn’t shown much interest in letting him go yet.Also Read: “Go somewhere and chew on bark”: Terry Bradshaw’s savage message to Aaron Rodgers amid the No. 12 Jersey debate For Cleveland, trading for Cousins is a big gamble. On one hand, he could keep the Browns competitive in the tough AFC North, throwing to talented players like Jerry Jeudy and David Njoku behind a solid offensive line. On the other hand, the financial strain and uncertainty about how well he fits with the team could backfire.","Cleveland Browns are considering a trade for veteran quarterback Kirk Cousins.

But an even more jaw-dropping postgame message sparked wide attention. The highly anticipated showdown took place at TNC 02 and saw Beasley walk away with a $100,000 cash prize and some viral bragging rights. But the biggest moment came after the event, when Beasley let loose with a comment that sent the internet into a frenzy.Michael Beasley, a former No. 2 overall NBA draft pick, showed flashes of the promise that once made him the most hyped freshman in the nation.

Shaquille O'Neal asserts that his era wasn't for the faint of heart

Shaquille O’Neal, one of the most dominant forces in NBA history, recently reignited conversation around the changing nature of basketball across eras. Appearing on episodes of The Big Podcast and New Heights, O'Neal reflected on his toughest battles, shared vivid memories of his legendary dunks, and sparked debate by pointing out which current players could have survived and thrived in his bruising, physical era. His comments cut through nostalgia and bravado, offering a rare window into how he views greatness then and now.Shaquille O'Neal admits not every game was a cakewalk. When Brandon Jennings asked about the toughest era he faced, Shaq replied without hesitation, “That’s a really unfair question because nobody ever really played me straight up,” he began. But he singled out the early 2000s, when the league introduced the “Shaq Rules” as particularly challenging. “When you can do the front and back, it got difficult for a while… with a guy in front of you, I really couldn't get the ball a lot. ”He also revealed how rugged the game was when he entered the league: “It was the end of that ‘Bad Boy’ era. The Knicks would f*** you up. Detroit will still f*** you up.” He even admitted, “Rik Smits used to embarrass me… Hakeem [Olajuwon] was the last one to give me work.” Though he eventually surpassed his contemporaries, saying he “got Robinson out of there, I got Ewing out of there, I got Hakeem out of there,” Shaq acknowledged the mental and physical demands of the era.And yet, his peak came in this very stretch, when he led the Lakers to a historic three-peat from 2000 to 2002. The irony? His dominance grew in the very era he calls the toughest.Shaq didn’t mince words when asked which current players could hang in his time: “LeBron, of course—well, he did play in our era. KD also played in our era. That’s about it.” But he made a bold addition, the Timberwolves’ young star Anthony Edwards . “Ant Edwards, big and strong,” he said, signaling that Edwards’ physicality reminds him of a bygone era.No conversation with Shaq is complete without revisiting his iconic dunks. He singled out two as his favorites, including the infamous poster over Knicks center Chris Dudley. “He was all over me, and I was like, ‘Get the fu** off me,’” Shaq recalled. He laughed about it years later, even joking with Dudley, “Are you trying to fight or you trying to give me a hug?”Also Read: NBA Commissioner Adam Silver says iconic Larry O'Brien logo might return to Finals courts in 2026 The Hall of Famer’s contribution to basketball has certainly been top-notch, while he enjoys the modern NBA game, in fact being an analyst in the Inside the NBA crew, he will never leave an opportunity to hail the old-school glory, especially of his time.",Shaquille O'Neal says the early 2000s were the toughest era of his career.

What the Jazz Get in This Trade

Will the Los Angeles Lakers consider this trade idea?





Theface a critical offseason if they hope to contend for the 2025-26 NBA championship. One of their biggest needs? A reliable frontcourt presence to support Luka Doncic—or even replace him if necessary. A proposed trade with the Utah Jazz could be the solution.The Los Angeles Lakers struggled with depth in the 2025 postseason, often relying too heavily on their star players. A trade for Utah Jazz center Walker Kessler could provide the balance they need.According to Svyatoslav Rovenchuk of Lake Show Life , a potential deal could send Lakers guard Austin Reaves, Gabe Vincent, Maxi Kleber, and a 2031 first-round pick to Utah in exchange for Kessler, Collin Sexton, and Jordan Clarkson.""It's about that time of the year to cook up mock trades,"" Rovenchuk wrote. ""If the Lakers were interested in building up a more balanced roster that would not be as top-heavy, the Utah Jazz are certainly the team to call."" (H/t: Sporting News)In his three NBA seasons, 7-foot-1 center Walker Kessler has steadily improved. Among his strong points are:- Elite rim protection (2.4 blocks per game in 2024-25)- Strong rebounding (12.2 per game last season)- Effective pick-and-roll execution- Solid transition playWhile not yet a superstar, Kessler’s potential makes him an ideal fit next to LeBron James and Luka Doncic Walker Kessler’s 2024-25 Stats:According to Caleb Hightower of Sporting News Austin Reaves had a career-best regular season, silencing critics who doubted his ability as a primary scorer. However, his playoff performance dipped, raising questions about his consistency in high-pressure situations.Austin Reaves’ 2024-25 Regular Season vs. Playoffs:Despite his postseason struggles, Austin Reaves remains a valuable trade asset. As Rovenchuk noted: ""A career year in Utah could allow AR15 to get his pay day too.""For Utah, this deal makes sense if they’re looking to rebuild around younger talent. The trade package includes:- A proven scorer in Reaves- A future first-round pick (2031)- Expiring contracts (Vincent and Kleber)This gives the Jazz flexibility while adding a potential long-term backcourt piece in Reaves.Walker Kessler's defensive presence would help the Los Angeles Lakers with their frontcourt problems, which they need to balance their squad. Reaves, meanwhile, might flourish in a more significant position with the Jazz.As Rovenchuk put it: ""In a best-case scenario, the Lakers walk away from this deal with a new starting center, and two veteran pieces that can play strong supporting roles for this team.""Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Should the Los Angeles Lakers trade Luka Doncic for $293.4 million Milwaukee Bucks superstar to form deadly duo with LeBron James?

The mother of three has never shied away from speaking about how motherhood transformed her life forever. The Reframe owner was only 18 years old when she welcomed her first child Bronny. As a teenage mother she not only juggled the responsibilities of an NBA star's wife but also the emotional and physical changes motherhood brings along with it.During a recent appearance on the popular chat show Everybody’s Crazy, Savannah James poured her heart out while talking about how motherhood impacted her identity as a woman. The podcast host duo not only spoke about on sensitive topics including parenting and the impact of social media on kids nowadays, but also reflected on their motherhood journey while talking to the podcast co-host April McDaniel, she said,“With the boys especially, it was really hard for me to find identity outside of being a mom.I felt like that is where my identity was supposed to be, so I just kind of put all of the eggs into that basket.”Kids grow up in a flash of time, and the worst part is that time cannot be turned back. As a parent, even Savannah James went through similar things when Bronny, Bryce, and Zhuri were growing up and further went on to take up different careers in life. During an interview with the reputed media outlet Essence back in 2023, Savannah James spoke about how she coped with her three kids, Bronny, Bryce, and Zhuri, growing up and leaving for their respective colleges. She said,“With Bronny going away to college and Bryce being right there as a junior in high school and Zhuri now being a fresh nine years old, they have a good grasp of what our family dynamic is and what is expected of them.”She further explained-“So, I don’t feel like I have to be a helicopter mom per se, and I’m able to go out and just act on my passions and to put my foot out into new things that interest me. So I think that it’s mostly that, just knowing that the groundwork has been laid, and I feel good about the position that I’ve left them in. So I feel comfortable with seeing where my passions are able to take me.”LeBron James and Savannah James recently celebrated a new milestone in their second eldest son, Bryce Maximus’ life, who went on to complete his high school in Sierra Canyon. Bronny James was drafted by the Los Angeles Lakers in 2024, and their little daughter Zhuri has gravitated towards the game of volleyball.

Controversy around the Imane Khelif’s gold medal at Paris Olympic



IOC calls findings misinformation



Response of World Boxing

Fairness and safety concerns from athletes and federations



Ongoing debate on gender and sport eligibility





A leaked medical report from the 2023 World Championships has revealed that Olympic boxing champion Imane Khelifis biologically male, according to chromosome analysis. The report, made public just days after World Boxing ordered Khelif to undergo sex testing for eligibility in future female competitions, shows she has a male XY karyotype. This revelation challenges the International Olympic Committee’s (IOC) earlier dismissal of such tests and has intensified debate over fairness and safety in women’s boxing. The findings come amid ongoing controversy surrounding Khelif’s participation in women’s events, sparking calls for stricter verification procedures in sport.The report, published on the 3 Wire Sports website, states that Khelif’s chromosome analysis is “abnormal” and confirms a male karyotype. It was conducted by Dr Lal PathLabs in New Delhi, a lab accredited by the American College of Pathologists and certified by the International Organisation for Standardisation. This directly challenges the IOC’s spokesperson Mark Adams, who had described such test results as “ad hoc” and “not legitimate” during a press conference at the Paris Olympics.The controversy surrounding Imane Khelif ’s Olympic gold medal run began as early as her first bout in Paris, where she faced Italy’s Angela Carini.Carini, an experienced and respected boxer, was visibly shaken during the match. Overwhelmed by Khelif’s strength and intensity, she appeared distressed and left the ring in tears after the fight, later telling media she had feared for her safety. The unease only deepened in the final bout, where Khelif defeated Taiwan’s Lin Yu-ting in a dominant display that many felt was physically one-sided. The power difference between the fighters drew sharp criticism, with commentators and athletes calling it “uncomfortable to watch” and likening it to watching a man beat a woman in the ring. The moment became one of the most controversial of the Paris Games, fuelling an international debate over fairness and inclusion in women’s sport.IOC president Thomas Bach dismissed the report as part of a Russian-led misinformation campaign, citing ethical and financial issues within the International Boxing Association (IBA), which conducted the tests. Despite these claims, the legitimacy of the Indian lab’s certification has increased pressure on the IOC to clarify its position and respond to questions about Khelif’s eligibility.Following the leak, World Boxing has declared that Khelif must pass mandatory chromosome testing before competing in any future female events. The 26-year-old Olympic champion, who was allowed to compete in Paris due to her female passport status, has so far not provided evidence to confirm female chromosomes. World Boxing now requires all athletes over 18 in its competitions to undergo PCR genetic testing to verify their sex, a measure introduced in response to this controversy.The case has raised serious safety and fairness concerns within the boxing community. Opponents like Italy’s Angela Carini and Mexico’s Brianda Tamara have spoken out about the physical challenges they faced competing against Khelif. Latin American federations have been particularly vocal, urging that women’s competitions be restricted to athletes assigned female at birth, in order to protect fairness and athlete safety.The Khelif controversy highlights the complex and sensitive issues surrounding transgender and intersex athletes in competitive sport. It underscores the need for clear, consistent policies that balance inclusivity with fairness and safety. As governing bodies reassess their rules, the case remains a key example of the challenges faced in maintaining the integrity of women’s sports.The ongoing debate around Imane Khelif’s case brings to light just how complex and emotionally charged the conversation about gender and eligibility in sport has become. At the heart of it are real athletes — women who train for years and step into the ring expecting fairness. Many feel blindsided and unheard when competing against opponents whose physical attributes raise legitimate concerns about safety and equality. This isn’t about exclusion, but about protecting hard-won opportunities for women in sport. Khelif’s story reminds us that governing bodies must act transparently, thoughtfully, and with empathy for all athletes involved.","Imane Khelif is biologically male, according to chromosome analysis. Leaked medical report shows she has a male XY karyotype. World Boxing now requires all athletes over 18 in its competitions to undergo genetic testing to verify their sex. IOC president Thomas Bach dismissed the report as part of a Russian-led misinformation campaign.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121566659,imgsize-1426565,width-400,resizemode-4/121566659.jpg"

Aaron Rodgers ditches Packers’ No. 12 for Steelers’ No. 8 with a bold Jersey switch that raises eyebrows,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/aaron-rodgers-ditches-packers-no-12-for-steelers-no-8-with-a-bold-jersey-switch-that-raises-eyebrows/articleshow/121700488.cms,"Aaron Rodgers’ jersey switch from No. 12 to No. 8 marks new chapter (Image via: Getty Images)

A new jersey and a new beginning for Aaron Rodgers





Aaron Rodgers’ move to the Pittsburgh Steelers has captivated NFL fans. After 18 seasons with Green Bay wearing the iconic No. 12, Rodgers surprised many by choosing No. 8 in Pittsburgh. This bold jersey switch not only sparks debate but also signals a new chapter for both Rodgers and the Steelers Aaron Rodgers’ jersey choice carries weight far beyond a number. No. 12 is synonymous with Steelers legend Terry Bradshaw, whose Hall of Fame career included four Super Bowl wins. While Bradshaw’s No. 12 isn’t officially retired, it hasn’t been worn since 1983. Rodgers opting for No. 8, a number he wore with the Jets, is a clear sign of respect for the Steelers’ history, while embracing a fresh start.Beyond the jersey, Aaron Rodgers brings a decorated legacy: four NFL MVP awards, a Super Bowl ring and MVP, and 10 Pro Bowls. But after a tough 5-12 season and an Achilles injury, this move represents reinvention. Rodgers is betting on a comeback, and the Steelers are banking on his experience to revive their playoff hopes.The Steelers haven’t advanced past the Wild Card round since 2017. Adding Rodgers could finally push the team into serious contention in the AFC North.The No. 8 jersey, worn by several players but never tied to a franchise icon, marks the beginning of a new era — with eight players having worn it in Steelers history, including Ev Fisher (1940), Elmer Kolberg (1941), Tommy Maddox (2001-05), Josh Scobee (2015), Karl Joseph (2021), Melvin Ingram (2021), Kenny Pickett (2022-23), and Corliss Watiman (2024). While none have reached the legendary status of Terry Bradshaw, the number carries its own legacy within the team.Also Read: Broncos exploring backfield options: Veteran running backs to watch if J.K.

Elon Musk’s Epstein tweet about Donald Trump sparks wild Antonio Brown reaction,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/elon-musks-epstein-tweet-about-donald-trump-sparks-wild-antonio-brown-reaction/articleshow/121659117.cms,"Elon Musk dropped a political bomb, and the timeline instantly melted



“Time to drop the really big bomb:

@realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public.

Have a nice day, DJT!”

Then AB showed up and dropped the tweet of the day



“ngl trump gotta deport elon to south africa after this”





When Elon Musk threw a digital grenade at Donald Trump at 12:40 AM, accusing him of being listed in the Epstein files, the internet was already on fire. But just when you thought the situation couldn’t get any weirder, Antonio Brown, former NFL superstar, self-proclaimed ""CTE king,"" and certified Twitter menace, decided to add his flavor of chaos. And honestly, no one does it quite like AB. From unhinged memes to all-caps declarations, he turned an already wild night into a full-blown digital circus.Let’s rewind a bit. Early Friday morning, Musk shocked everyone by posting this on X:The internet had barely recovered when he followed it up with:“Mark this post for the future. The truth will come out.”No sources, no links just classic Musk cryptic chaos. Naturally, it sent political Twitter, conspiracy theorists, and meme lords into an absolute frenzy.While most athletes would stay far away from that kind of heat, Antonio Brown is not most athletes. Just 16 minutes after the post, he jumped in with this gem:That’s it. That’s the tweet.Wild, hilarious, confusing, and totally AB.NFL fans immediately recognized the signature unpredictability of the former wide receiver. Let’s not forget, this is the same guy who once walked off the field shirtless mid-game, dropped rap singles, and launched his own indoor football team. At this point, AB is like the internet’s wildcard ex, you never know when he’s going to show up, but when he does, it’s gonna be loud.Whether he’s feuding with Tom Brady, launching bizarre business ventures, or weighing in on presidential-level scandals, AB has kept himself relevant in the post-NFL era with the same playbook: chaos and timing. This latest post just proves he’s still got it, the master of the viral moment, even when the moment has nothing to do with him.And honestly, who else would see a Musk vs. Trump digital war, decide to toss in a deportation punchline and somehow make it about themselves, too?While Elon and Trump battle it out over Epstein files and internet secrets, Antonio Brown just reminded the world that no matter the topic, he will always find a way to steal the show. One tweet, 16 minutes, and the NFL community is once again talking about AB and not a single snap of football was played.Also read - Steelers QB Mason Rudolph says he’s not sorry for backing Trump — here’s how the Steelers responded","Elon Musk tweeted that Donald Trump is listed in the Epstein files.

Because every time Sergei Bobrovsky takes the ice, it’s not just another brilliant performance, it’s a painful reminder of the one that got away.In a postseason that already feels like a career-defining stretch, Bobrovsky just made NHL history. With 42 saves in both Game 1 and Game 2 of the Final against the Edmonton Oilers, the Florida Panthers netminder has become the first goalie ever to start a Stanley Cup Final with consecutive 40-save efforts. It’s a stat that would be jaw-dropping on its own. But for Philadelphia? It’s downright gut-wrenching.With his Game 2 victory, Bobrovsky moved into 18th place on the NHL’s all-time playoff wins list, passing Tuukka Rask with 58.He’s now hunting down legends like Lundqvist, Hasek, and Vasilevskiy.

This postseason, he’s 13-6 with a 2.21 goals-against average, a .912 save percentage, and three shutouts.

Tom Brady faced boos from Colts fans at the Indy 500, with Pat McAfee’s wife, Samantha publicly savoring the moment. Brady, in classic fashion, fired back on social media and his YouTube channel, lightheartedly reminding them of his past dominance over their team, turning the negative reception into a playful jab.Tom Brady's Indy 500 visit wasn't well-received, met with significant boos. Pat McAfee's wife, Samantha, celebrated this on Instagram: “Hearing over 400,000 people boo Tom Brady was a real highlight of the day. I’m sorry, but I have Colts blood running through my veins. The finger was a bit much, my bad.” Her post highlighted the intense Indianapolis fan rivalry.This animosity isn't a new development. Colts fans harbor long memories of Brady being the orchestrator of their gridiron heartbreaks. From crushing AFC title game losses to playoff eliminations, he consistently dominated Indianapolis.His remarkable 16-4 overall record against them, coupled with 33 touchdowns – more than against any other team outside the AFC East – cemented his role as a recurring villain. For those in Indy, such statistics don't simply fade into history, especially when the architect of their past pain appears in their own backyard.Brady, ever the strategic player, chose his moment to respond, waiting until his YouTube video was released. In classic Brady style, his comeback was delivered with a grin and a subtle jab. “So friendly here in Indiana. Why would they not like me? ’Cause we beat their *ss,” he quipped in a clip from the tracks on his latest video. It was evident he relished the opportunity to engage with the rival fans.He didn't stop there. Brady also took to Instagram, describing the Indy 500 as an “incredible experience,” and concluded his post with a parting shot: “Great to get in one more successful drive in front of a bunch of Colts fans.” This was quintessential Brady – transforming negative crowd reactions into personal amusement and turning the tables on his detractors.Peyton Manning isn't joining any pile-on against TB12; their rivalry is over. However, some Colts fans still resent past defeats, especially the 2004 AFC Divisional Round. Brady consistently handles extreme criticism and ""hate"" with remarkable composure.Tom Brady's upcoming broadcasting gig will strike a different note. He told Complex, ""It's not about this harsh critique."" Instead, he aims to ""point out the greatness of these individual players. … That’s what I want to do on TV.""

Golden State Warriors power forward Draymond Green’s latest revelation about his mom confirms that Indiana Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton’s dad is not the only one to have embarrassed him in a houseful stadium during a match. Green has revealed his mom, Mary Babers-Green, not just criticizes the opponent team but also his team—and the one who faces her extreme wrath is Green himself.During his appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live, Draymond Green revealed, ""My mom, since I was a child, has been the mom who, like, from the stands, she yells, ‘You suck!’ But the thing about my mom is she talks bad about all the players on my team.

Indiana Pacers star Pascal Siakam brought a surprising twist to NBA Finals practice by channeling his inner soccer star. Ahead of Sunday’s crucial Game 2 against the Oklahoma City Thunder at the Paycom Center, Siakam entertained fans and teammates by kicking a basketball around with impressive footwork, showing a lighter side of preparation in a high-stakes series.

The NBA shared a video on X of the All-Star forward juggling a basketball with his feet like a soccer pro. “More of P’s soccer skills on display today,” the league wrote, adding to the fun with an earlier clip captioned, “P always brings the skills. Now he’s bringing them back to the finals 🔥.”Siakam has been deadly serious when it counts. He posted 19 points and 10 rebounds in Game 1, continuing a postseason that’s seen him average 20.9 points and 6.0 boards. His performance in the Eastern Conference Finals earned him the Larry Bird Trophy after his stunning MVP-winning performance against the New York Knicks.Indiana’s Game 1 win didn’t fall right into their hands.The Thunder led most of the night before Tyrese Haliburton’s game-winning shot with just 0.3 seconds left, completed a 35-25 fourth-quarter rally.

Cam Skattebo's viral moment provokes criticism over NFL history blind spot



Does Cam Skattebo know ball? 🧠

A generation gap or something more?



by face





New York Giants first-year running back Cameron Skattebo became the focus of an unintended NFL tempest—nothing on the field, but for seemingly not knowing anything about the league's greatest legends. In one recent video making its rounds on the internet, Cameron Skattebo can't recognize NFL legends from their pictures, kicking off an emotional Reddit discussion in which fans toggle between anger and empathy.Cameron Skattebo, who played college football at Sacramento State Hornets and Arizona State Sun Devils before the New York Giants drafted him in the fourth round of the 2025 NFL Draft, soon found himself a topic of conversation on Reddit—but not the kind related to his athleticism.In one clip of him now circulating, Cameron Skattebo misidentifies players during a quiz segment. When presented with a picture of Calvin Johnson, better known as ‘Megatron,’ confusion set in.Redditors were both amused and frustrated. One of the top comments stated, “Not knowing Calvin is wild, but an NFL player not knowing Brett Favre is crazy ffs.”Another commenter joked, “Banish him from the league for this,” and others reluctantly empathized, one of them noting, “To be fair, though, Calvin retired when Skattebo woulda been like 13 or 14, and he wasn’t a guy who was in many commercials or broadcast booths.So it’s not thaaaat crazy with all that in mind.”""They’re so disappointed they’re almost speechless by the end lol. The joy fully sucked out of the room,"" another user said.""Well we didn’t teach him memory skills at ASU I guess,"" a fan joked.""Tbf I haven’t seen most of these guys without a helmet on,"" another defended, ""I got Colston and Megatron though.""""This dude off my draft board,"" one Reddit user said to which another replied, ""I imagine Cam needs to watch it again too. Dude looked like he got concussed 4 times during it.""A fan tried to defend Skattebo's 'ignorance' by commenting: ""Calm down guys, memory is hard. I can't even remember the last time the Buffalo Bills won a superbowl.""The discussion soon escalated beyond Cameron Skattebo, with wider questions about how younger players identify with the history of the league. One commenter wrote that most players don't grow up watching the NFL but rather center on their own development or college careers. “A lot of these guys don't even follow the NFL til they get to the league. Might have been a college fan, or just doesn't watch football,” another Redditor wrote.Even fans conceded trouble identifying helmet-wearing players by face alone. “Not really. I wouldn’t recognize Joe Montana from face alone probably. I definitely wouldn’t recognize megatron from face alone. I think people here are forgetting these dudes play in helmets lol. Outside of a handful of players there’s probably not many non-Eagles I could recognize,” admitted one commenter.""I mean, not knowing Golden Tate, Kam Chancellor, and Darren Sprolesis honestly understandable,"" one more added.Nevertheless, the overall opinion was tilted towards incredulity, particularly in light of Johnson's place in NFL legend.While the NFL fan base in turn roasted and justified Cameron Skattebo's viral blunder, the moment highlighted something greater—the transience of fame, the changing tides of fandom across generations, and the way legacy players disappear from popular consciousness sooner than we want them to. Skattebo learned this lesson not offered in college: understanding the past can inform how you're perceived in the present.Also Read : Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce delight fans with synchronized dance at Tennessee wedding",New York Giants first-year running back Cameron Skattebo can't recognize NFL legends from their pictures.

'Daring, Dynamic, Different': Ponting hails PBKS young guns despite final loss

Poll Will Punjab Kings bounce back stronger and win the IPL next season? Definitely I don't think so





Punjab Kings fell short of the ultimate prize in the 18th edition of the Indian Premier League by the finest of margins. PBKS lost by six runs in the IPL final to Royal Challengers Bengaluru as Rajat Patidar's RCB claimed their first-ever crown. While Punjab, led by Shreyas Iyer were also in the quest for a maiden crown, it was their rivals that prevailed. Despite the heartbreak in the final, PBKS coach Ricky Ponting attracted praise for his managerial prowess and the relationship he formed with the members of his squad.The former Australian international and legend also showered praise on his side after the defeat in the final, and took pride in the fact that the team showcased something 'different' this year. In a recent clip posted on PBKS's official X handle, the coach takes out his 'funny' side in an interaction with co-owner and Bollywood star Preity Zinta . The latter was urged to do something never seen before by the coach in response to a question regarding his alternating demeanour while representing the franchise.""How does somebody be so aggressive on the ground and as a person, but be so calm and chilled out?"", asked Zinta as she expressed her curiosity on the 50-year-old's behavior on the pitch. The former Australia skipper is know for wearing his heart on his sleeve, but also for his polite and kind nature off of it.Chuckling in response, the coach made a hilarious offer to the co-owner to debunk her assumption. ""You need to come and sit next to me in the dugout sometimes because you will see that it's not always calm. Look, I'm an aggressive natured person, especially when it's cricket time.""Ponting made headlines for his trust on skipper Shreyas Iyer, who was not retained by Kolkata Knight Riders in 2025, but was made PBKS skipper and ultimately led the franchise to their first final since 2014. Ponting then clarified that he very jolly and cheerful outside of cricket and will have a laugh with anyone regardless. However, he stressed that when it comes to his duty, he makes zero compromises.""I'll have a laugh and a joke and a coffee and a sit down with anyone and talk about anything outside of cricket time. But when it's cricket time, it's my job to bring high performance to this team. And so I'm not gonna waste a minute, I'm not gonna waste a day, I'm not gonna waste a training session where I'm not trying to be the best coach that I can be and make every single player that's playing with me the best player that they can be,"" said an earnest Ponting.The PBKS coach also assured that his side will bounce back stronger next year.","Punjab Kings lost by six runs to Royal Challengers Bengaluru in IPL final.

Sidda, DKS have blood on their hands, they’re trying to wipe it on cops: BJP



TOI





BENGALURU: Three days after a stampede outside M Chinnaswamy Stadium killed 11 peopleat RCB’s IPL win celebration, it emerged that senior police officer MN Karibasavana Gowda had red-flagged the risks just before the event.His written warning to top bureaucrats on June 4, the day of the tragedy, also cautioned against the felicitation at Vidhana Soudha.“Lakhs of cricket fans are likely to come to Vidhana Soudha. Since there is a shortage of security personnel, making bandobast will be a problem,” Gowda, in-charge of security at the legislature, wrote to department of personnel and administrative reforms secretary G Sathyavathi.In the letter, whichis in possession of, Gowda also pointed to the venue’s sensitive status and lack of adequate CCTV coverage.Hours before the surge, department of personnel and administrative reforms secretary and senior IAS officer G Sathyavathi, overseeing arrangements at Vidhana Soudha steps, publicly urged fans to head to the stadium instead — a short distance away. The team was feted at the legislature and the celebrations then moved on to the stadium. But fears of overcrowding had set in well in advance.Despite the warning, RCB’s IPL victory celebrations were allegedly rushed through — less than 24 hours after the final match — without proper crowd control or safety protocols.Sources said the DCP’s note was also shared with then Bengaluru police commissioner B Dayananda, who in turn flagged it to chief secretary Shalini Rajneesh. But permissions were still granted.Adding fuel to the political fire, Union minister and JD(S) functionary HD Kumaraswamy alleged Saturday that the celebrations were “preplanned” even before RCB won. “The FIR says permission for the June 4 event was sought on June 3 at 6pm — 90 minutes before the final even began. Did they dream about winning?” he asked, demanding accountability from CM Siddaramaiah , deputy CM DK Shivakumar, and home minister G Parameshwara.He questioned the need for a felicitation so soon. “Was such a slipshod felicitation needed? Who put pressure on the police commissioner at 7.30am that day for permission?” BJP’s Bangalore North MP and Union minister Shobha Karandlaje echoed the outrage, calling it a “misuse of govt space”. “The grand stairs of Vidhana Soudha have always been used for swearing-in or state functions. You used it for a private team,” she said.Accusing the Congress brass, Karandlaje said: “Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar have blood on their hands. Now they’re trying to wipe it on police officers. Where are KC Venugopal and Randeep Singh Surjewala hiding?”","Senior police officer MN Karibasavana Gowda red-flagged the risks just before the event.
