In a thrilling doubleheader on Sunday, Wanindu Hasaranga and Mitchell Starc delivered match-winning performances as Rajasthan Royals edged past Chennai Super Kings by six runs, while Delhi Capitals cruised to a seven-wicket victory over Sunrisers Hyderabad.Rajasthan Royals held their nerve to defend 182/9, thanks to Hasaranga’s brilliant 4/35. Chennai Super Kings skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad fought hard with a 44-ball 63, but Hasaranga’s relentless strikes derailed the chase, restricting CSK to 176/6.Despite late fireworks from Ravindra Jadeja (32* off 22) and MS Dhoni (16 off 11), CSK fell short.

Despite leg-spinner Zeeshan Ansari’s two quick wickets, Abhishek Porel (34) and Tristan Stubbs (21) guided Delhi home with four overs to spare.Sunrisers' innings had an early setback as Abhishek Sharma’s run-out triggered a collapse. Starc removed Ishan Kishan and Nitish Reddy in one over before dismissing Travis Head for 22.

President Donald Trump is all set to welcome the Kansas City Chiefs to the White House



Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce continue to be one of the most popular couples in the NFL. While the recent events at Super Bowl 2025 might have made them lowkey, they are still very much in love with one another. But it seems like things might change between Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift due to newly elected President Donald Trump since the Kansas City Chiefs have now been invited to the White House.While the Chiefs have not issued a statement about it yet, President Donald Trump had once predicted Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s break up.In 2023, in an interview with the Daily Caller, President Donald Trump was asked about Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s relationship. President Donald Trump had said, “I wish the best for both of them. I hope they enjoy their life, maybe together, maybe not — most likely not.”Two years later, while Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have continued to be together, President Donald Trump’s feud with Swift has also continued and gotten worse.The billionaire pop star Taylor Swift has publicly spoken about not supporting Donald Trump. A few months before the 2025 elections, Taylor Swift had publicly supported Kamala Harris when Harris debated with Donald Trump.However, Donald Trump has not held back. He had posted on his Truth Social handle about his feelings for Taylor Swift when she got booed at the Super Bowl 2025, which he was also attending.Donald Trump’s post on his Truth Social handle read as, ""The only one that had a tougher night than the Kansas City Chiefs was Taylor Swift. She got BOOED out of the Stadium. MAGA is very unforgiving!""Recently, in an interview with OutKick, Donald Trump spoke about inviting the Kansas City Chiefs to the White House since, due to COVID-19, the team could not make their visit to the White House after they won the Super Bowl in 2020.Donald Trump said, “I look forward to having the (Philadelphia) Eagles (for winning Super Bowl LIX in February). And one other thing, we’re going to have the Kansas City Chiefs after that, because they missed their turn because of Covid.”While it is not known how Taylor Swift will react to accepting her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, visiting the White House when she has been trolled multiple times by President Donald Trump, it remains interesting to see how it changes the couple’s equation or if it will even have an effect on them.Currently, fans are waiting for Taylor Swift to announce the date for the release of her new album while Travis Kelce has not yet confirmed if he would be retiring this season.

Bombay Sports Exchange Episode 1: Interview with Sanjog Gupta, CEO (Sports) at JioStar

NEW DELHI: A high-voltage Indian Premier League (IPL) clash between Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) and Chennai Super Kings ( CSK ) saw tempers flare, with Virat Kohli and Khaleel Ahmed at the center of an intense face-off.The heated moment came after RCB broke their 17-year jinx at Chepauk with a commanding 50-run victory over CSK.The spark was ignited during RCB’s innings when Khaleel Ahmed bowled a sharp bouncer to Kohli, who missed the delivery.The CSK pacer followed through aggressively, getting uncomfortably close and giving a fierce stare at Kohli. The RCB batter did not take kindly to it.However, the real drama unfolded after the match during the customary handshake.Kohli, who scored 31 off 30 balls, was visibly agitated when Khaleel approached him -- possibly to extend a peace offering.While shaking his hand, Kohli shoved the pacer away, making his frustration evident.Watch:Standing nearby, MS Dhoni watched the incident unfold with his signature calm demeanor, but the exchange was already caught on camera, sparking discussions among fans.Later, Kohli was seen having a light-hearted chat with Ravindra Jadeja before his demeanour suddenly changed upon noticing Khaleel Ahmed approaching him.His aggressive reaction was caught on camera, showcasing an intense exchange. However, the heated moment eventually cooled down, ending with both players shaking hands in a show of sportsmanship.Earlier in the game, RCB posted a solid 196/7, thanks to a gritty 51 off 32 by Rajat Patidar and a late cameo from Tim David (22 not out off 8).Despite a brisk start by Phil Salt (32 off 16) and Devdutt Padikkal (27 off 14), the innings stumbled in the middle overs before Patidar and David provided the finishing touches.CSK’s chase faltered early as Josh Hazlewood (3/21) and Yash Dayal (2/18) rattled their top order, leaving them at 52/4.Rachin Ravindra (41 off 31) and MS Dhoni (30 not out off 16) fought back, but it wasn’t enough as CSK fell short, finishing at 146/8.While RCB celebrated a historic win, Kohli’s fiery moment ensured that the drama didn’t end with the match.READ ALSO: MS Dhoni becomes CSK’s highest run-scorer in IPL history",Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) beat Chennai Super Kings (CSK) by 50 runs.

IPL | Punjab Kings' Suryansh Shedge: From playing under Shreyas to dreaming of meeting Kohli

Left-arm pacer Mitchell Starc delivered a sensational spell of 5-35, while vice-captain Faf du Plessis smashed a rapid 27-ball half-century as Delhi Capitals registered a commanding seven-wicket victory over Sunrisers Hyderabad at the Dr. Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy ACA-VDCA Cricket Stadium in Visakhapatnam. The win keeps DC unbeaten in IPL 2025 .On a surface offering some grip, Starc’s three wickets in the powerplay pushed SRH on the back foot early. He later returned to clean up the tail, claiming his first five-wicket haul in T20 cricket. His variation in pace proved to be a key factor in dismantling SRH’s batting lineup. Kuldeep Yadav (3-22) and Mohit Sharma (1-25) provided solid support, ensuring DC’s dominance.Also See: RR vs CSK Live Score For SRH, uncapped batter Aniket Verma was the lone bright spot, producing a stunning 74 off 41 balls. He forged a crucial 77-run partnership off just 40 balls with Heinrich Klaasen (32), but the rest of the batting order failed to capitalize, once again struggling to put up a competitive total.In response, du Plessis showcased his class with a fluent fifty, laced with three fours and three sixes at a strike rate of 185.19. He was well-assisted by Jake Fraser-McGurk (38), KL Rahul (15), Abishek Porel (34*), and Tristan Stubbs (21*), as DC chased the target with ease, wrapping up the match with four overs to spare. For SRH, debutant leg-spinner Zeeshan Ansari impressed with figures of 3-42.Opting to bat first, SRH got off to a shaky start despite Travis Head finding the boundary twice off Starc in the opening over. A mix-up saw Abhishek Sharma run out for just one, and from there, the collapse began. Starc dismissed Ishan Kishan (caught at deep third man), local lad Nitish Kumar Reddy (caught at mid-on off an off-cutter), and Head (caught behind attempting a steer to third man), reducing SRH to a precarious position.Verma got a reprieve when he was dropped on six off Axar Patel’s bowling, and Klaasen injected some momentum with aggressive strokeplay, smashing Starc and Axar for boundaries to end the powerplay on a high.Verma continued his counterattack, slog-sweeping Vipraj Nigam for six and hammering Axar for consecutive maximums—one over deep square leg and another straight down the ground. He maintained a strong base, lofting Mohit Sharma for four and dispatching Kuldeep for a towering six.However, the promising 77-run stand was broken in the 11th over when Klaasen’s attempted leg-side shot off Mohit was brilliantly caught by Nigam, who sprinted back from backward point. SRH then lost Abhinav Manohar and Pat Cummins cheaply to Kuldeep. Verma, though, fought on, reaching his maiden IPL fifty off 34 balls and continuing to clear the ropes with ease.His onslaught included more powerful shots—an inside-out drive off Axar for four, followed by two more sixes off the left-arm spinner. However, Kuldeep had the final say, as Fraser-McGurk executed a perfectly timed jump at deep mid-wicket to send Verma back for a well-made 74. Starc then returned to polish off the tail, ensuring SRH didn’t even bat their full 20 overs.Fraser-McGurk set the tone early, slog-sweeping Abhishek Sharma for six, while du Plessis pulled Mohammed Shami for a maximum. While Fraser-McGurk struggled with timing and survived two dropped catches, du Plessis was in supreme touch, finding boundaries off Shami, Abhishek, and Cummins—his straight six off the Australian pacer standing out.Fraser-McGurk continued his aggression with an uppish drive off Ansari for four before du Plessis reached his fifty off just 26 balls. However, the leg-spinner had his moment in the next over, as du Plessis mistimed a slog to long-on, giving Ansari his first IPL wicket.Taking over the attack, Fraser-McGurk smashed Ansari for two fours and a six before chipping one back to the bowler for 38. KL Rahul announced himself in DC colors with a streaky boundary off his first ball, followed by a majestic slog-sweep and a lofted drive off Shami for six and four. But his promising start was cut short when he was bowled around his legs attempting a sweep off Ansari for 15.Porel ensured there were no hiccups, whipping Abhishek for four and later smashing Ansari for a six and four in successive deliveries. Stubbs, too, joined the party, lofting Harshal Patel for a boundary before pulling and driving Wiaan Mulder for two more fours. Fittingly, Porel sealed the win in style, clubbing Mulder for a six as DC wrapped up their Visakhapatnam home leg with an emphatic victory.",Delhi Capitals beat Sunrisers Hyderabad by seven wickets. Vice-captain Faf du Plessis hit a rapid 27-ball half-century. Mitchell Starc took five wickets for Delhi.

NEW DELHI: Former Indian cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar has expressed concerns over Rohit Sharma 's current performance, underlining a noticeable decline in the form of the experienced batsman. The former MI skipper has amassed six single-digit scores in his last nine IPL innings, including .According to Manjrekar, Sharma, a pivotal figure for the Mumbai Indians , appears to be at a critical juncture in his career where additional effort is required to maintain his level of play.""Rohit Sharma is clearly going through a phase. He's not the Rohit Sharma of, say, three to four years ago. He's at a stage in his career where he has to push himself every morning - train hard and be at his best - because things are slipping away for him. He's still relying on his natural talent and instincts,"" Manjrekar told JioStar.Also See: DC vs SRH IPL Live Score Mumbai Indians faced a 36-run defeat to the Gujarat Titans , indicating potential areas for improvement in their batting lineup.In his analysis of the Mumbai Indians' batting efforts in recent matches, Manjrekar noted the adaptation challenges faced by Ryan Rickelton, a South African player, to Indian pitches.""Ryan Rickelton, being a South African, will take time to adjust to Indian pitches. Very few South African batters, barring AB de Villiers and Heinrich Klaasen, have truly flourished on Indian pitches. So, we'll have to give him time. Apart from that, Tilak Varma and Suryakumar Yadav, along with Robin Minz and some of the other players, form the batting line-up. However, to me, it still looks a little unconvincing. And a lot of them rely on pitches where the ball comes onto the bat nicely,"" said Manjrekar.""There's pace and bounce, and even in that chase where they needed 12 or 13 runs, if it had been at Wankhede Stadium, they would have likely come very close to the target.""Despite these challenges, Manjrekar remains hopeful for the Mumbai Indians' prospects in the tournament. He acknowledged the team's struggle in their recent match against the Gujarat Titans, where they were unable to chase a target of 197, finishing at 160 for six.The comparison of the early wicket losses between the two teams and the difficulties in building partnerships during a high-scoring chase were highlighted as key factors in the match's outcome.""The dew never came in, which made Mumbai's job even more difficult. But despite all that, two losses are quite typical for Mumbai Indians.

CSK in IPL 2025: Sixth title loading for Chennai Super Kings?

Chennai: There’s a new ‘No. 9’ in town. MS Dhoni has made a career out of being out of the box, but on Friday night at the MA Chidambaram Stadium, he seemed to be stretching things a bit too far.As wickets fell and CSK kept losing steam in their chase of 197, the fans got more and more impatient. They wanted to see their ‘Thala’ come out and take on the RCB bowlers, but the wait continued. It was only after Ravichandran Ashwin, not exactly a swashbuckler, got out in the 16th over that Dhoni walked in at No. 9, probably the lowest that he has batted in his 18-year IPL career.Not that he batted badly. The 16-ball 30* was an indicator that his ability to clear the boundary hasn’t exactly diminished. In fact, it was his late burst of 19 off Krunal Pandya that brought down the margin of defeat to 50. But then, what’s holding him back? Dhoni is apparently “fitter than what he was in the last two years,” when he was playing with a knee injury and a muscle tear, respectively. His wicketkeeping skills are only getting better — the stumping of Phil Salt on Friday was a piece of beauty — but there’s a strange reluctance to go up the order with the bat.Virender Sehwag was quite critical about his decision to bat No. 9. “What can you do? Even when he was playing for India, he didn’t care much for suggestions to go up the order. Now, it’s probably the fag end of his career, what can you expect?” Sehwag said in a post-match show.The CSK think-tank, though, has a different take on the issue. Captain Ruturaj Gaikwad was asked before the first game against Mumbai Indians if there will be a case for a promotion in the batting order for Dhoni. “MSD has been performing a specific role and he is doing that very well. It’s unlikely to change,” he said.What he meant was that Dhoni is still immensely dangerous at the business end of the innings, where his ability to clear the fence and the fear factor that he generates combine beautifully to bolster the CSK totals. Last year, in those short bursts, Dhoni was batting at a strike-rate of 220.54, and the CSK team wants that same impact this time too.Even though the legend has maintained his body well, there’s always that gnawing suspicion that too much running between the wickets may just lead to damage of the ageing body that has taken a lot of wear and tear. The IPL is a two-month journey, and the team wants him fully fit when things really get tight at the back-end.Don’t be surprised if CSK are only three down in the 15th over against Rajasthan Royals in Guwahati on Sunday and Dhoni comes out to bat. “Dhoni has done a good pre-season, working on his hitting and keeping skills,” coach Stephen Fleming said.","MS Dhoni has made a career out of being out of the box, but on Friday night at the MA Chidambaram Stadium, he seemed to be stretching things a bit too far.

NEW DELHI: Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) secured a convincing 50-run win over Chennai Super Kings ( CSK ) in the eighth match of the 2025 Indian Premier League , thanks to stellar performances from Rajat Patidar and Josh Hazlewood CSK, chasing a target of 197, faltered in their pursuit, finishing with just 146/8 in their 20 overs.RCB, after being put in to bat by CSK, posted a formidable total of 196/7.The innings was built around Patidar's crucial knock of 51 runs off 32 balls, a composed effort that anchored the middle order after early wickets fell.Patidar's knock, which included four boundaries and three sixes, came at a brisk strike rate of 159.38.His efforts were complemented by Tim David’s unbeaten 22 off 8 balls, which ensured that RCB maintained momentum despite losing wickets at regular intervals.The standout bowling performance for RCB came from Josh Hazlewood, who wreaked havoc with the new ball, claiming two wicketsin the first over. He later got another one, picking up a figure of 3/21 runs in his 4 overs.Hazlewood was instrumental in breaking CSK's chase early, dismissing Rahul Tripathi, Ruturaj Gaikwad, and Ravindra Jadeja, all key CSK batters.His disciplined bowling ensured that CSK never really got into the chase, despite a spirited late attempt from MS Dhoni , who remained unbeaten on 30 off 16 balls.CSK’s chase never gained momentum as they lost wickets at crucial intervals.Hazlewood's early breakthroughs set the tone. Livingstone's wicket of Ravichandran Ashwin was a key turning point.Despite Dhoni’s late resistance, hitting two sixes and three fours in his innings, CSK’s total of 146/8 was insufficient.Hazlewood’s dominance with the ball, paired with Patidar’s vital contribution with the bat, led RCB to a comfortable 50-run victory, leaving CSK to reflect on a disappointing outing at Chepauk.RCB next face Gujarat Titans next Wednesday, while CSK travel to Guwahati for their next match against Rajasthan Royals on Sunday.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) secured a convincing 50-run win over Chennai Super Kings ( CSK ) in the eighth match of the 2025 Indian Premier League.

Stephen A. Smith reacted to Dillon Brooks’ ejection from the Houston Rockets vs Phoenix Suns matchup



Dillon Brooks ejected after tangled up with Kevin Durant and gets held back from ref

The Houston Rockets’ Dillon Brooks found himself at the center of controversy on Sunday, getting ejected in a fiery matchup against the Phoenix Suns. Brooks got tangled up with Suns superstar Kevin Durant in the second quarter, leading to a scuffle that saw multiple technical fouls handed out. However, NBA analyst Stephen A. Smith came to the defense of the Rockets while condemning the decision to eject him from the matchup.Stephen A. Smith was not happy as Dillon Brooks was ejected from the matchup. The altercation began when Brooks, while guarding Durant, was called for a reach-in foul. However, instead of letting the play go, Brooks continued to grab at Durant, attempting to snatch the ball. This escalated into a physical exchange, with the two players getting tangled up. Suns center Nick Richards stepped in to diffuse the situation, but Brooks shoved him aside, leading to his first technical foul.Frustrated Brooks continued arguing with officials, which led to a second technical and an automatic ejection. Durant and Richards were also assessed technical fouls, but it was Brooks who ultimately paid the price, being forced to exit the game.Taking to X, Smith wrote, “This is driving me crazy. I’m watching the @HoustonRockets vs @Suns game. Dillon Brooks did not deserve to get thrown out of this game. A physical play vs @KDTrey5 for sure, cussing at the referee initial for the foul call. But to eject the man over that? Come on. Let the players play!”It was Brooks' first ejection of the season and the seventh of his NBA career. Entering Sunday’s game, he led the league in total fouls with 235 and had already accumulated $58,000 in fines from various infractions. With this latest ejection, Brooks’ total technical foul count for the season reached 15— just one away from an automatic one-game suspension per NBA rules.Before his ejection, Brooks had put up eight points in 11 minutes of action. Following the incident, Houston went on a dominant 23-11 run to close out the half, carrying a commanding 78-49 lead into the break.Brooks is a crucial piece for the Rockets, averaging 13.9 points per game this season.As for the Suns, they were already struggling to keep pace, their night took another hit when Kevin Durant suffered an injury in the third quarter. Driving to the basket, Durant landed awkwardly on Jabari Smith Jr.’s foot, rolling his left ankle in a painful twist. He was helped off the court and did not return, finishing the night with 11 points and seven rebounds.Durant’s injury came just a quarter after his scuffle with Brooks, but this time, the situation was far more concerning for the Suns.

Lewis Hamilton on his biggest inspiration



Success in Formula 1 demands more than just raw talent—it requires relentless dedication, an unshakable mindset, and the ability to learn from the best. For Lewis Hamilton , who rose to the pinnacle of motorsport without the privileges of an affluent background, hard work was non-negotiable. Along the way, he found inspiration in some of the greatest athletes in history, particularly basketball legend Michael Jordan When Ferrari recently asked Lewis Hamilton about his biggest inspiration outside of F1, his answer was immediate: Michael Jordan. The six-time NBA champion revolutionized basketball, bringing a level of dominance and global appeal never seen before.“I think it just his work-ethic, and his style in which he did it,” Hamilton shared, emphasizing how Jordan’s dedication and effortless brilliance on the court resonated with him. Born in 1985, Hamilton grew up watching Jordan redefine what it meant to be a champion. The way Jordan carried himself—both in competition and in the public eye—left a lasting impression on the young Briton.The connection between Hamilton and Jordan extends beyond admiration. The two have interacted over the years, though not always as planned. Hamilton once revealed that Jordan was supposed to join him for a round of golf but never showed up. However, there were no hard feelings—just another example of the unpredictability that comes with meeting one of your heroes.Alongside Jordan, Hamilton has often spoken about his admiration for boxing icon Muhammad Ali. Known for his dazzling skills in the ring and unparalleled confidence outside it, Ali was more than just an athlete—he was a movement.“Ali, I think, was really his confidence in himself. The utter belief in himself, I think, was paramount,” Hamilton said.Ali’s ability to back up his words with action inspired Hamilton in his own journey. From his early karting days to his record-breaking success in F1, Hamilton has channeled that same self-belief, proving doubters wrong time and time again.Hamilton’s admiration isn’t limited to Jordan and Ali. When asked about his biggest inspirations, he also named his father, Anthony Hamilton, and Nelson Mandela. His father’s sacrifices paved the way for his racing career, while Mandela’s resilience and fight for justice deeply influenced his worldview.This champion mentality has driven Hamilton to unprecedented success in Formula 1. With 105 Grand Prix victories, 104 pole positions, and a record-tying seven world titles, he has cemented his place among motorsport’s all-time greats.Also Read: Lewis Hamilton fuels Hollywood dreams as he and Charles Leclerc drop a major hint about an upcoming movie collaboration Interestingly, Jordan once tried to convince Hamilton to switch from F1 to NASCAR and join his 23XI Racing Team. While the move never materialized, it highlights the mutual respect between two of the greatest athletes of all time.","Lewis Hamilton has won a record-breaking seven Formula 1 world titles.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

IPL | Punjab Kings' Suryansh Shedge: From playing under Shreyas to dreaming of meeting Kohli

Rajasthan Royals' stand-in captain Riyan Parag has been fined Rs 12 lakhs by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) for maintaining a slow over-rate during their match against Chennai Super Kings at Barsapara Stadium on Sunday. The fine came after Rajasthan secured their first win of IPL 2025 in three attempts, following losses to Sunrisers Hyderabad and Kolkata Knight Riders.The penalty was imposed under Article 2.22 of the IPL's Code of Conduct, which deals with minimum over-rate offences. As this was the team's first offence of the season, Parag received a monetary penalty.Parag became the second captain this season to face such a fine, following Mumbai Indians' Hardik Pandya, who was penalised similarly after their match against Gujarat Titans in Ahmedabad on Saturday, where MI suffered a 36-run defeat.The BCCI has implemented new regulations for the current season regarding over-rate violations. Captains will no longer face match bans but will receive demerit points based on the severity of the offence. This change follows Hardik's one-match ban in 2024, which caused him to miss Mumbai's season opener against Chennai Super Kings in IPL 2025.In the match against CSK, Rajasthan Royals secured a crucial victory. Sri Lankan spinner Wanindu Hasaranga played a pivotal role, claiming 4 wickets for 35 runs and exposing Chennai's weakness against spin bowling.Nitish Rana's half-century helped Rajasthan post a competitive total. The match went down to the wire, with Sandeep Sharma successfully defending 20 runs in the final over, including the crucial wicket of MS Dhoni.The victory marked Rajasthan's first win of the season after two consecutive losses. They had previously lost their opening match to Sunrisers Hyderabad and their second game to defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders.Rajasthan Royals will look to build on this momentum when they face Punjab Kings in their next match at the Maharaja Yadavindra Singh Cricket Stadium in Chandigarh.","Rajasthan Royals' stand-in captain Riyan Parag has been fined Rs 12 lakhs by the Board of Control for Cricket in India.

NEW DELHI: MS Dhoni on strike. 20 runs needed off the last over. The weight of expectations from thousands of roaring CSK fans. A nightmare scenario for any bowler, but Rajasthan Royals’ medium-pacer Sandeep Sharma rose to the occasion with nerves of steel.Defending a total against the ultimate last-over finisher is no small task, and the tension was palpable as Sandeep was handed the ball for the final over. He started with a wide, adding to the drama, but what followed stunned the Guwahati crowd into silence.On the next delivery, Sandeep bowled a low full toss, and Dhoni, attempting to muscle it across the leg side, made solid contact. But stationed at deep mid-wicket was Shimron Hetmyer, who sprinted to his left and pulled off a stunning low catch. The stadium, which had erupted moments earlier, fell into an eerie hush as Dhoni stood motionless, processing his dismissal.Sandeep, overwhelmed by the moment, folded his hands and looked up, thanking the almighty. His teammates rushed in to celebrate, knowing they had sealed a crucial victory. Rajasthan Royals had conquered the Dhoni factor, clinching the match by six runs.CSK fans had hoped for a vintage Dhoni-Jadeja rescue act with 45 needed off the last three overs.Dhoni, under scrutiny for batting at No. 9 in the previous match, promoted himself to No. 7 this time but struggled to find the boundary. In the 18th over, bowled by Maheesh Theekshana, he faced three deliveries and could only manage three runs, further increasing the pressure.The spark finally came in the penultimate over when Dhoni hammered Tushar Deshpande for a boundary off the first ball and followed it up with a huge six. The crowd found its voice again as CSK needed 20 off the last six balls.With Dhoni in full flow, many believed the script was set for another magical finish. But Sandeep Sharma had other plans. Keeping his composure, he executed his deliveries to perfection, starting with Dhoni’s dismissal and ensuring CSK never recovered from the setback.Earlier in the match, Rajasthan Royals posted 182/9, led by Riyan Parag’s 37 and Nitish Rana ’s explosive 81. CSK, despite Ruturaj Gaikwad’s 63, fell just short, thanks to Sandeep’s brilliance at the death.With this thrilling victory, Rajasthan Royals gained crucial momentum and will now shift their focus to their next clash against Punjab Kings on Saturday.","CSK fans had hoped for a vintage Dhoni-Jadeja rescue act with 45 needed off the last three overs.

Instead, he delivered a near-flawless performance, using his powerful serve and aggressive baseline game to become the first Czech player since Tomas Berdych in 2005 to win an ATP Masters 1000 event.Djokovic, appearing troubled by an issue under his right eye, frequently applied eye drops and consulted his team.Still, Mensik capitalised, racing to a 3-0 lead in the first set before Djokovic clawed back.

A tough IPL and a fitting T20 farewell

A career of highs and lows: Rohit Sharma's journey

Bombay Sports Exchange Episode 1: Interview with Sanjog Gupta, CEO (Sports) at JioStar

NEW DELHI: Reflecting on India's incredible run in ICC tournaments, Rohit Sharma highlighted the team’s resilience over the past nine months, navigating cricket’s highs and lows. Under his leadership, India won the ICC Champions Trophy and the T20 World Cup , but the only blemish was the heartbreaking defeat to Australia in the 2023 ODI World Cup final.""Look at what this team has achieved in this big three tournaments. After playing the tournament like that and getting defeated only once, and that too in a final (2023 ODI World Cup),"" Rohit said in a video posted by Mumbai Indians on their X (formerly Twitter) handle. ""But imagine if we had won that as well to go undefeated in three ICC tournaments is crazy, never heard of, but I will take this, 23 wins in 24 games is unheard of. It looks very nice from the outside, but the team has gone through a lot of ups and downs.""We had some really tough times as well, but that is when you've got to celebrate. If you do things like this, you've got to celebrate. I feel that all the people who played these three tournaments deserve respect.""Rohit credited India’s success to the shift in mindset that began after their semifinal exit in the 2022 T20 World Cup in Australia. The team focused on clarity, fearless cricket, and collective responsibility.""But thereafter, we made a lot of things clear with the players that this is what we expect from you, and this is how we want you to play. So there was a lot of clarity, a lot of conversations with the players to perform,"" he added.""There needs to be freedom amongst the group so that they go out and play without any fear. There were a few lows, a few series that we lost, but we never panicked and we never went away from our thought process. When you are building a squad, the first thing that you need to put in front of you is what the team want. Where did we lack in the previous series, previous tournaments? Why did we not get the results?""Interestingly, Rohit's remarks came on the day when BCCI’s top brass was set to discuss India's future roadmap, though the meeting was later postponed.The journey was not without setbacks. In between the three ICC tournaments, India lost a rare home Test series to New Zealand and struggled in Australia. But Rohit saw these challenges as learning experiences.""These nine months are a perfect example of how life is -- it’s always going to be up and down. Any sportsman going through a low wants to fight back, bounce back, and turn things around. And that’s exactly what we did,"" he reflected.Rohit also opened up about his disappointing 2024 IPL season, where Mumbai Indians finished last. Despite the setback, he remained focused on the bigger picture -- ending his T20I career on a high.He continued, ""It (2024 IPL) was a low for the team, and I think we didn't play our best cricket also, and there were so many things after IPL to look forward to.""""I knew there was a World Cup coming up and I had to shift my focus to the World Cup, knowing that this is going to be my last T20 World Cup. So I really wanted to make it count, and obviously I knew without the help of other players it is not going to be possible. So we just got around as a group, and there was a lot of collective performance from everyone throughout the tournament,"" he said.India went on to defeat South Africa by 7 runs in Barbados, securing the T20 World Cup title.""My career for 17-18 years has always been up and down, and these nine months were no different,"" Rohit admitted.Speaking about his journey with Mumbai Indians, he acknowledged the changes over the years, adding, ""Obviously, since the time I started till now lot of things have changed because I used to bat middle-order then, now I am opening the batting. I was captain then (MI), but now I am not the captain. There were a few teammates with whom I won championships, they are not there, they are in the coaching role now.""So, the roles have changed, a lot of things have changed but the mindset has not changed. What I want to do for this team has not changed, just to go out there and win games and trophies, that is what MI is known for all these years.""","Rohit Sharma reflects on India's incredible run in ICC tournaments. Under his leadership, India won the ICC Champions Trophy and the T20 World Cup. The only blemish was the heartbreaking defeat to Australia in the 2023 ODI World Cup final. Rohit also opened up about his disappointing 2024 IPL season.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119701867,imgsize-136424,width-400,resizemode-4/119701867.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings (CSK) head coach Stephen Fleming was visibly frustrated with a journalist during the post-match press conference following his team's loss to Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) on Friday. The former New Zealand captain reacted strongly when the journalist compared CSK's style of play to other teams, dismissing the question as ""silly.""The match marked CSK’s first defeat of the season, with RCB securing their first victory at Chepauk since 2008, winning by 50 runs.Tensions flared in the press conference when Fleming confronted the journalist over the criticism of CSK’s approach.: ""In the first game, you chased 156 in almost 20 overs. Today, you scored 146. I know this is your way of playing cricket, but do you think it's kind of getting outdated?"": ""What do you mean by my way of playing? You talk about firepower. We have got firepower all the way through. I don't understand this question. Just because we don't swing from ball No.1 and have some luck go our way, just see at the end, who wins it. It is a positive brand of cricket. Don't discount us."": ""I am not discounting you."": ""You sort of are. Silly question.""Addressing the notion of ""home advantage,"" Fleming argued that Chepauk no longer provides CSK with a clear edge, as the team has struggled to read the pitch consistently.""Well, as we've been telling you for a number of years, there was no home advantage at Chepauk. We've won away from home a couple of times. And we haven't been able to read... we've been really honest with you,"" Fleming said in the post-match press conference.""We haven't been able to read the wickets here in the last couple of years. So, it's not new. We are trying to come to grips each day with what we get, and we don't know. It's not the Chepauk [of old] where you can just go in and play four spinners. We're having to work really hard to try and understand what the nature of each pitch is, and it's quite different,"" he added.",Chennai Super Kings (CSK) lost to Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) on Friday.
