Ahead of the bout, the Israel-based fighter was quite confident about defeating the Irish fighter. Farage even used phrases like ‘take down’ and ‘pound his face’ in order to guarantee his win against McCorry. However, that didn’t pan out according to the fighter’s plans and instead faced the echoing chants from both the audience and his opponent.The Israel-Palestine issue is an ongoing crisis that has claimed the lives of many innocent souls.A recent airstrike near an aid distribution centre in Rafa also claimed the lives of 30 people, which adds to the number of victims of this conflict every other day. The residents of the Gaza Strip are now on the brink of ‘catastrophic hunger,’ which raises another issue in the books of international relations.The users of the internet are divided on McCorry yelling the slogan, while some support the fighter, others believe that chanting the slogan brings unnecessary political aspects into the world of sports.

The fighter’s social media accounts across Instagram, X and others remain deactivated post the incident.Following the video of the slogan going viral, McCorry himself posted the same video where the fighter is seen landing elbows on his opponent and chanting “Free Palestine.” McCorry captioned the video as “Street Justice.”Also read: Veteran Jamaican boxer and Hall of Famer Mike McCallum passes away at the age of 68 McCorry’s win has been celebrated hugely by the audience owing to the fact that Farage’s presence within the cage was not just viewed as a mere everyday opponent but a symbolic representation of the ongoing injustice executed upon the residents of Palestine. His standing within the cage was representing the machinery of occupation and violence for most of the audiences. After securing the win, McCorry was seen raising the Palestine flag as a symbol of support for the people of the country. The fighter even seemingly added the slogan during his victory announcement in order to further solidify his stance on the issue.","Paddy McCorry, 27, was defeated by Israel-based fighter Shuki Farage at the Cage Warriors 189 event in Rome, Italy.

'I don't want to be a one-season wonder': Punjab Kings' Shashank Singh

Arshdeep Singh: The Poet Who Bowls Thunder | Stories from His Father & Coach





Punjab Kings captain Shreyas Iyer displayed visible anger towards teammate Shashank Singh after their IPL 2025 Qualifier 2 victory against Mumbai Indians at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. Despite Iyer's match-winning unbeaten 87 runs off 41 balls that guided Punjab Kings to their second IPL final, he was seen berating Shashank Singh for his run-out during the crucial chase of 204 runs.The incident occurred immediately after Iyer hit the winning six off Ashwani Kumar's bowling. While the Punjab Kings team rushed to celebrate with their captain, the heated moment occurred when Shashank Singh approached Iyer.Iyer confronted Shashank with strong words and gestures, clearly expressing his disappointment over the latter's run-out in the 17th over. Iyer was seen pointing fingers at Shashank, who remained silent but visibly disappointed during the exchange.The run-out incident took place on the fourth ball of the 17th over when Shashank was dismissed for just 2 runs. The dismissal came off Trent Boult's bowling when Shashank hit a low full-toss towards Hardik Pandya at mid-on.Mumbai Indians captain Pandya's quick fielding and direct hit caught Shashank short of his crease at the non-striker's end.While initial viewing suggested Shashank had made it safely, replays revealed his casual approach to running between the wickets.The absence of a diving effort from Shashank added to the nervousness for Punjab Kings at that crucial juncture in the match.Despite the run-out incident, Punjab Kings successfully chased down the target of 204 runs with five wickets remaining and six balls to spare. Iyer's explosive innings of 87 not out proved decisive in securing the victory.The win has set up Punjab Kings' path to their second IPL final, where they will face Royal Challengers Bengaluru, led by Rajat Patidar.

A huge roar erupted from the Punjab Kings' dugout and stands as Yuzvendra Chahal dismissed the dangerous Suryakumar Yadav during the IPL 2025 Qualifier 2 clash at Ahmedabad’s Narendra Modi Stadium. Among those celebrating were RJ Mahvash and franchise co-owner Preity Zinta , visibly ecstatic as PBKS struck a major blow in a high-pressure contest.Suryakumar, Mumbai Indians ’ batting mainstay this season, looked in sublime touch once again before falling for 44 off 26 balls. He had earlier hit Chahal for two sixes in the match before the leg-spinner had the last laugh. With this dismissal, the Surya vs Chahal battle in IPL now reads: 13 innings, 88 balls, 116 runs, four dismissals at an average of 29 and a strike rate of 131.81. Not dominant, but not a walkover either.Coming into the match, Surya had already amassed 673 runs in 15 innings at an average of 67.30, striking at 167.83. His wicket tilted momentum slightly in PBKS’s favour as they looked to restrict MI to a chaseable total. Punjab Kings had earlier won the toss and opted to bowl first under cloudy skies in Ahmedabad. The decision reaped early rewards as Rohit Sharma , fresh off a dazzling 80 in the Eliminator against Gujarat Titans, was dismissed for just 8 (7) by Marcus Stoinis.Rohit’s cheap dismissal meant he now shares an unwanted record with Suresh Raina for the most single-digit scores (9) in IPL knockout matches.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Jonny Bairstow contributed a brisk 38 off 24 balls, while Tilak Varma anchored the innings with a composed 44 off 29. Despite these efforts, it was Suryakumar’s wicket that brought the loudest cheer from PBKS fans.With the scoreboard reading steady but not imposing, Mumbai now look towards captain Hardik Pandya and youngster Naman Dhir to provide the fireworks at the death and push the total past the par mark.

In the past few days, some gossip platforms have shared the rumours that Vanessa Bryant, the widow of NBA icon Kobe Bryant, is pregnant and in a relationship with a younger basketball player. There have been no reports suggesting Vanessa’s pregnancy, and neither has she been spotted with anyone on a date with someone. So, these claims remain completely unverified, and it's unclear where the speculation originated.Some users have been sharing images of Vanessa, pointing to what they claim is a visible ""baby bump.""

Despite the absence of any reliable confirmation, the rumours have sparked intense online reactions, and Vanessa has also been receiving backlash from fans.Some fans appeared supportive of Vanessa. “Even if Vanessa Bryant is actually pregnant, y'all expect her to be single the rest of her life? Get a grip,” a fan wrote on X.. “Wait vanessa bryant is pregnant?” asked a surprised fan on X.Some fans also seemed concerned about Vanessa moving on with someone who’s so much younger, as reports surfaced that Vanessa’s basketball player boyfriend is only 27 years old. “Vanessa Bryant is pregnant by a 27 year old basketball player.Kobe gave his life, ruined family relationships behind this woman and just 5 years after the death of the man she spent over 20 years with, you get pregnant by another professional player 16 years younger than you. There are no rules out here fellas,” someone wrote on Facebook.Vanessa Bryant was married to NBA superstar Kobe Bryant, who tragically passed away on January 26, 2020, in a helicopter crash in California.

Auston Matthews and his fans got emotional as his mother opened up about the financial struggles of getting him into hockey,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/auston-matthews-and-his-fans-got-emotional-as-his-mother-opened-up-about-the-financial-struggles-of-getting-him-into-hockey/articleshow/121166477.cms,"Image credit - Paige Taylor White/CP

Auston Matthews’ hockey dream wasn’t cheap and his mom took the weight

“I used to work in the morning for Starbucks, in the afternoon the restaurant, i was very fortunate to have two jobs. And believe me, if they would have more hours, I would have more jobs.""





Before Auston Matthews was an NHL superstar, his biggest supporter was clocking into two jobs, trying to make ends meet. His mom, Ema Matthews, didn’t just believe in his dream, she bankrolled it, penny by penny, from behind a Starbucks counter. For families without deep pockets, hockey can be financially brutal. But Ema’s resilience turned obstacles into opportunity and her son into one of the league’s brightest stars. Her story is the heartwarming reminder that every great athlete often has a real-life superhero cheering from the sidelines, sacrificing, hustling, and holding it all together so their child can chase the impossible.Ice time, gear, coaching, travel, youth hockey isn’t just a sport, it’s a financial beast. For the Matthews family, especially with Ema being originally from Hermosillo, Mexico, the culture and cost of the sport were both daunting. But she took on the challenge without hesitation, picking up multiple jobs including a gig at Starbucks to ensure Auston never missed a chance to grow on the ice. She juggled long hours, late nights, and early mornings, often sacrificing her own comfort and time just to make sure Auston’s hockey dreams stayed alive and on track.Ema shared in a past interview that the cost of hockey often reached up to $20,000 a year, a heavy ask for any middle-class family. To make it work, she didn’t just cut corners, she picked up shifts and poured lattes while helping Auston stay focused on the sport. She even deposited small amounts of money in his account so he could grab food with teammates like a regular teen. Beyond that, Ema often drove long hours to tournaments, handled equipment costs, and juggled bills, all to ensure Auston had every chance to chase his dreams without added stress.Ema’s story also breaks stereotypes. In a sport dominated by players from Canada and northern U.S. states, Auston’s rise as a player of Mexican heritage makes his success even more impactful. It's not just about talent, it’s about trailblazing, especially for kids of color or immigrant families who rarely see themselves represented in hockey.Auston Matthews is one of the Toronto Maple Leafs’ biggest stars and a face of the NHL. He’s not just known for his goal-scoring skills but also for his poise and work ethic, traits his mom likely helped instill. While fans celebrate his success on the ice, stories like Ema’s remind us of the sacrifices behind the scenes that made it possible, from long car rides to practices, emotional support during tough losses, and the quiet strength that helped shape his journey to stardom.Ema Matthews’ story shows what’s possible when love, grit, and hustle lead the way, proving that behind every great athlete stands a family whose unwavering support shapes both their character and their incredible achievements. Her journey highlights the sacrifices, encouragement, and strength that fuel success, reminding us that triumphs on the ice are built far beyond the rink, in the hearts and homes of those who believe the most.Also read - “From baptism to strip club”: Pete Blackburn’s unhinged NHL comparison is going viral and fans totally get it","Auston Matthews is one of the Toronto Maple Leafs’ biggest stars and a face of the NHL.

Juan Soto silences critics with clutch performance as he ends HR drought and proves David Stearns' belief right,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/juan-soto-silences-critics-with-clutch-performance-as-he-ends-hr-drought-and-proves-david-stearns-belief-right/articleshow/121544737.cms,"After 17 homerless games, Juan Soto’s bat explodes just when the Mets needed it most (AP Photos)

Juan Soto breaks slump in style, ends homer drought and delivers big for Mets in crucial win







Juan Soto reminded baseball fans why he commands one of the most lucrative contracts in the sport with a thunderous 404-foot home run that snapped a 17-game drought. The blast, launched in the fourth inning of the Mets’ 8-2 win over the Colorado Rockies on Saturday, was more than just a number on the box score—it was a statement.After weeks of quiet at the plate, Soto's swing roared back to life with a 109.5 mph shot to left-center, despite facing a 14 mph wind pushing out to right field. “He put a really good swing on it,” Mets manager Carlos Mendoza said. “For him to hit it out of the ballpark like that on a day that the conditions are not in his favor, that’s pretty impressive.”Soto himself couldn’t hide his confidence. Grinning when asked if he thought the ball had enough to clear the fence, he responded, “I mean, 110 (mph), you’ve got to be. I knew it was gone.”The home run was his first since May 9, and although it marked the fourth-longest homerless stretch of his eight-year career, the fans at Citi Field never wavered. When Soto completed his home run trot, he raised his hands to acknowledge the roaring crowd. Just moments later, chants of “JUAN SO-TO” echoed from the right-field seats, to which he turned and raised his arms in appreciation. “It’s a great feeling when you feel the support like that,” he said.The moment became even sweeter when it followed Brandon Nimmo’s two-run homer, making it a back-to-back blast for the Mets. “Francisco (Lindor) and I were doing our picture down there,” Nimmo said of the team’s dugout celebration. “Heard the sound of the bat and the crowd going wild. We looked out and were able to see him go the other way. That’s when he’s the best.”While Soto’s $765 million, 15-year deal sets sky-high expectations, it also invites relentless scrutiny. Any slump feels seismic. But baseball is a game of streaks, and Mets president David Stearns offered a dose of reason during Soto’s recent struggles. “I think he's having good at-bats. He controls the strike zone pretty well. He's hitting the ball on the ground a little bit more than before and it's something he's aware of. ”The calendar turning to June and Soto’s power reawakening could signal a pivotal shift—not just for him, but for the Mets’ momentum going forward.Also Read: “I don’t know what to do”: Olivia Dunne breaks down over terrifying stalker encounter at airport","Juan Soto broke his 17-game homer drought with a 404-foot blast on Saturday.

Unsigned draft pick Craig Woodson wants to be a two-way star like the Jacksonville Jaguars’ Travis Hunter

Chicago Bears defensive tackle William Perry was called. Atlanta Falcons cornerback Deion Sanders is called. Pittsburgh Steelers running back Jerome Bettis was called. Detroit Lions fullback Nick Ryder was called. So many names. With so many meaningful explanations to them! But this one is going to surprise everyone! 2025 NFL Draft’s fourth-round, 106th pick - Craig Woodson, rookie safety for the New England Patriots, is called -Why? According to former Cal defensive backs coach Tre Watson, “That was a nickname I gave him(Craig Woodson) because he was always going to make us right.”On June 1, Tre Watson shared with Mike Reiss of ESPN, “Any week we went into a game plan, if there was a matchup or a formation or personnel, he(Craig Woodson) was going to be the one adjusting and cleaning up everything for us because he could handle it.As well as his presence in the post, we didn’t get a lot of shots in the middle of the field because Craig(Woodsen) was always going to be back there to erase it. If a play got busted, he was going to get it on the ground.That’s where it started, his name as ‘The Eraser’ because he was our clean-up guy.”“I like him(Craig Woodson). Smart. Savvy. He’s doing a great job soaking up what the coaches want him to do. Different techniques. College ball is a little different than the league - especially in the Pac-12. So, you know, he’s definitely doing a good job, though.” shares New England Patriots veteran safety Jabrill Peppers with Mark Daniels of MassLive.Mike Vrabel, head coach for the Patriots, instead praises the veteran safety, “I love Jabrill’s energy. I like his passion for the game. I like his energy when he comes in the building. Those things are all very positive, and then new players and the new additions are trying to carve out a role as well.”First-team All-ACC Craig Woodson calls himself a versatile safety. He talks about what he has to offer to the New England Patriots with Mark Daniels of MassLive. Woodson shares, “I think I can bring versatility when it comes to coverage, just being in the deep post or being in the deep half.I had some interceptions in the deep half this year, making plays on the ball. I think for me, I really have the versatility to do anything and even match up with a receiver if it comes down to it. For me, my play style is really anywhere.

More Than a Team: The Rise of CSK & the Whistle Podu Army





In cricket, a diamond duck refers to a dismissal where the batter is out without facing a single delivery. It is one of the rarest and most unfortunate ways for a batter to get out. This usually happens through a run-out, where the non-striker is dismissed while attempting a run before facing a ball, or occasionally if the striker is run out from the non-striker’s end during a miscommunication.The term “duck” itself signifies a score of zero. It originated from the shape of the number ""0"", resembling a duck's egg. Various types of ducks exist, such as the golden duck (out on the first ball faced) or platinum duck (out on the first ball of the innings). A diamond duck is worse in some ways because the batter doesn't even get the chance to play a delivery.Diamond ducks are particularly painful for top-order batters or star players because they occur before any contribution is made. In team strategy and batting partnerships, these dismissals can disrupt momentum and confidence. They are also notable in statistical records and can be used in commentary to highlight the chaos or pressure in a particular moment of the game.Because of its rarity and the circumstances often surrounding it—poor communication, panic running, or sharp fielding—a diamond duck can become a talking point in post-match discussions and is often replayed in highlights as a moment of drama or misfortune.There have been 164 players to be dismissed for a Diamond Duck in ODI cricket with India recording 12 of them, including Roger Binny, Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan (twice), Virat Kohli, Abey Kuruvilla, MSK Prasad, Venkatapathy Raju, Chetan Sharma, Navjot Singh Sidhu, S Sreesanth and Javagal Srinath.The first ever Diamond Duck in Test cricket came in the form of Albert Rose-Innes (South Africa) in 1889.",Diamond duck refers to a dismissal where the batter is out without facing a single delivery.

With a spot in the IPL 2025 final on the line, Punjab Kings skipper Shreyas Iyer made a bold call at the toss in Qualifier 2, opting to bowl first against five-time champions Mumbai Indians at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Sunday.Facing a do-or-die clash for a place in Tuesday’s summit showdown against Royal Challengers Bengaluru, Shreyas explained his reasoning for putting MI in to bat first.“We are going to bowl first. Slightly overcast and the wicket was under the covers as well,” Iyer said. “It’s a fresh game, our mindset is to go out and win. The environment is top-notch. Yuzi comes in.”The decision aligns with the conditions in Ahmedabad, where Pitch No. 7 — known for its even pace and flat surface — was used for the all-important game. Murali Kartik and Michael Clarke, analysing the strip before the toss, predicted a run-fest, calling it a “batter’s paradise” where 200-plus totals are par.Mumbai Indians captain Hardik Pandya echoed Iyer’s view, admitting he would have bowled first as well.“We also would have bowled first. We need to bat well and assess the conditions. It has got flatter.If you bowl well, you’ll get some help,” said Pandya. “We came very early morning after the last game, and most of the guys focussed on recovery. Topley comes in for Gleeson, who has a niggle.”Both captains clearly anticipated that chasing under lights might offer an advantage, especially with the venue’s dew factor in mind. With Ahmedabad offering true bounce and short square boundaries (61m and 67m), the match promised high-octane entertainment.Priyansh Arya, Josh Inglis (w), Shreyas Iyer (c), Nehal Wadhera, Marcus Stoinis, Shashank Singh, Azmatullah Omarzai, Kyle Jamieson, Vijaykumar Vyshak, Arshdeep Singh, Yuzvendra ChahalRohit Sharma, Jonny Bairstow (w), Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya (c), Naman Dhir, Mitchell Santner, Raj Bawa, Trent Boult, Jasprit Bumrah, Reece Topley","Punjab Kings skipper Shreyas Iyer opts to bowl first in Qualifier 2.

Is there a reserve day for IPL 2025 Qualifier 2?





The start of the IPL 2025 Qualifier 2 between Punjab Kings and Mumbai Indians has been delayed due to rain at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.PBKS captain Shreyas Iyer had earlier won the toss and elected to bowl first, hoping to make early inroads on a pitch that has favoured teams batting first this season.However, just minutes before the scheduled start, dark clouds rolled in and rain began to fall, forcing the ground staff to bring on the covers. For now, fans remain hopeful that the skies will clear and play can begin soon.Also See: MI vs PBKS IPL Qualifier 2 Live Score In case of a complete washout, the team with the higher position in the points table will advance to the next round. This would favour the Shreyas Iyer-led Punjab Kings, who topped the league stage with 19 points and maintained a superior net run-rate compared to the Mumbai Indians, who finished fourth.The BCCI and IPL Governing Council have implemented additional time provisions to address potential rain interruptions. The playing conditions now include an extra hour to complete the match if weather disruptions occur.""Similar to the playoffs stage, an additional one hour will be allocated to the playing conditions for the remaining matches of the league stage, starting Tuesday, 20 May,"" states the BCCI announcement earlier in the season.The IPL Playing Conditions, specifically Clause 13.7.3 regarding extra time, provides detailed guidelines: ""Where the start of play is delayed or play is suspended for any reason then extra time of… up to one hundred and twenty minutes for any of the play-off matches (shall be available).""The playing conditions further elaborate: ""For the avoidance of doubt, if extra time is required to be used, it will be taken in the following sequence. In the event of a delayed start or interruption, the provision of… one hundred and twenty minutes for play-off matches extra time is to be used first, followed by the time allocated for time-outs and then the reduction in the innings change interval (if applicable).""Additional clarification is provided regarding Super Over scenarios: ""For clarity, the changeover period (maximum 10 mins) for a Super Over after the main match is not to be taken into account when applying any permitted extra time available.""The match arrangements currently do not include a reserve day provision for the second qualifier. The tournament organisers have confirmed that only the final has a designated reserve day in case of weather interruptions.","IPL 2025 Qualifier 2 between Punjab Kings and Mumbai Indians has been delayed due to rain at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.

It's been such an amazing experience for me so far.From the first day I landed here, the love has been amazing. Just unbelievable, man. First-class organization. I'm just so happy to be here.

Carmelo Anthony revealed why Larry Brown suspended LeBron James, Allen Iverson, and Amar'e Stoudemire before the 2004 Olympics



Why Larry Brown Suspended Lebron James & Amar'e Stoudemire





Carmelo Anthony recently opened up about the unexpected discipline handed down by coach Larry Brown just before the 2004 Olympics. It was indeed a stunning revelation that pulls back the curtain on one of Team USA’s most talked-about Olympic moments. Speaking candidly on the 7PM in Brooklyn podcast, Anthony explained how LeBron James , Allen Iverson, and Amar’e Stoudemire were suspended over something as bizarre as showing up a little early, not late (point to be noted), to a scheduled team meeting.Carmelo Anthony candidly recalls the chaotic environment leading up to the 2004 Athens Olympics. The NBA icon described how things got real when, before a scrimmage against Puerto Rico in Jacksonville, three of the team’s biggest names were told they wouldn’t be playing.“The minute I knew what type of environment that was going to be was when they got suspended in Florida,” Anthony said. “Say there's a meeting at 2:00 p.m. Okay. You get there at 1:57. The meeting starts at 1:55, right? Now you get suspended.”Despite arriving before the scheduled meeting time, the early start and razor-thin expectations created confusion. According to Anthony, this wasn’t just about a timing mistake; rather, it was a power play to assert control over a team packed with big personalities and future legends.Brown, who had spent years managing the volatile but brilliant Allen Iverson in Philadelphia, appeared to have reached his limit. As Anthony explained, “Larry don’t want to deal with that [expletive] with Allen no more. He just dealt with it for six years.” So when Iverson, along with the young and rising Amar’e Stoudemire and LeBron James, were present just a few minutes before the set time, Brown chose to make an example of them.“It wasn’t a casualty of war. It was setting the tone,” Melo said. “AI, you the guy… you leading Amari who’s a young guy… you also leading LeBron James. I got to set the tone and let LeBron know that’s not allowed.”For many, it seemed petty at first, but Anthony realized it was all about asserting leadership and making sure the rookies, especially LeBron, weren’t influenced the wrong way.Even after the suspension, the “Young Guns,” as the crowd eventually called them, made a mark overseas. “We get to Turkey… the crowd is yelling Young Guns in the crowd,” Carmelo remembered proudly.Also Read: LeBron James is not a fan of Bronny and Bryce James’ basketball upbringing as he recalled his own journey to become an NBA legend Argentina claimed the Championship in the men’s basketball tournament at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, while the United States came in third place.","Carmelo Anthony revealed why Larry Brown suspended LeBron James, Allen Iverson, and Amar'e Stoudemire before the 2004 Olympics.

In a thrilling clash between Punjab Kings and Mumbai Indians that finished at almost 2am local time, the Shreyas Iyer-led side came out on top. In a game which was pushed back by over 2 hours due to rain, tensions were high and passion overflowing as Punjab chased down a staggering 204-run target with an over to spare.Following the loss, skipper Hardik Pandya took blame for the result as he evaluated his decision-making. The 31-year-old acknowledged that he could have managed his side better.Iyer and Co. were relentless in their pursuit, as the captain took matters into his own hands with a trailblazing 87* from 41 balls. Crucial knocks from Josh Inglis (38 off 21) and Nehal Wadhera (48 off 29) also helped the side get the better of the five-time champions in Qualifier 2. With the defeat at the Narendra Modi Stadium, Mumbai Indians' season came to an end.Reacting to the result, Pandya said, ""I'll not put it on the wicket, if we had to do something better it was to bowl right lengths, or bowl the right bowler at the right time. I'm someone who likes to take it all on me, and maybe I could have managed my troops a little better.""The MI captain also spoke on his side's batting display, opting to stick to the opinion that his team did well to post a 203 total on the board, even though teams averaged scores closer to 220 in Ahmedabad.""I think it was par, but it needed great execution as a bowling unit, matters in a big game, they were really calm, put us under pressure, and we couldn't execute.""In contrast to the way Jasprit Bumrah was brought in against Gujarat Titans early on in the game, the 31-year-old was deployed against PBKS in the 18th over, when Punjab needed 31 off 18. ""If we bowled Bumrah earlier, it might have been better, but it might have been a little too early instead. Knowing Boom, the situation even if 18 balls are left, Jassi can be Jassi and do something special. Unfortunately (it) didn't happen today,"" explained the captain as he reflected on the tactical decision.With the defeat, Mumbai's season ended without a record sixth title.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.

2025 highlights: Familiar faces and dramatic falls



Is it just madness or tradition





Every year on a steep hill in Gloucestershire, England, hundreds gather to chase a rolling 7-pound wheel of Double Gloucester cheese down a dangerously steep slope. Known as the Cooper’s Hill Cheese Rolling Contest, the event is chaotic, absurd, and completely thrilling. With participants tumbling, somersaulting, and crashing their way to the bottom, the headline “People sprint to catch a 7-pound wheel of cheese” is technically accurate, but it doesn’t quite capture the madness, tradition, and injuries that define this bizarre British spectacle. So, is it a good headline? That depends on what you’re hoping to convey.The Cheese Rolling Contest is an annual event held on Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth, Gloucestershire. Dating back at least two centuries, and possibly much longer, the race involves competitors hurtling down a 200-yard slope after a large wheel of cheese. The goal? Be the first to reach the bottom and claim the cheese as a prize. It sounds simple, but the event is notorious for its steep incline, dangerous tumbles, and frequent injuries.The hill is so steep that it's nearly impossible to stay upright. Most participants end up tumbling head over heels, colliding with each other or the ground.Gravity takes over quickly, and the cheese, reaching speeds of up to 70 mph, is almost never actually caught. Still, competitors willingly risk sprains, fractures, and concussions for a shot at glory and a round of cheese.This year, German YouTuber Tom Kopke claimed victory for the second year in a row. Shirtless and triumphant, he declared, “I risked my life for this. It’s my cheese. Back to back.” On the women’s side, Ava Sender Logan from London tumbled repeatedly but emerged victorious, saying, “It felt quite long coming down and then I hit my head. I’m fine.” Around them, spectators packed the woods and fences for a glimpse of the chaos.While the event may seem absurd to outsiders, for locals and returning participants, it’s a point of pride and cultural identity. Despite calls to regulate or cancel it over safety concerns, the contest continues to thrive, drawing international competitors and media attention. Volunteers, medics, and long-time residents treat it as an important local tradition","The Cheese Rolling Contest is an annual event held on Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth, Gloucestershire.

A dramatic hit-wicket dismissal to Kusal Mendis stole the spotlight in Mullanpur as Mumbai Indians edged Gujarat Titans by 20 runs in a record-breaking IPL 2025 Eliminator that saw a staggering 436 runs scored—the most in any IPL playoff.Chasing MI’s daunting 228/5, GT’s early hopes were pinned on Mendis and Sai Sudharsan after Shubman Gill fell cheaply. The Sri Lankan looked in rhythm, hammering two sixes and a four in a brief 10-ball stay. But just as the 64-run stand with Sudharsan was blossoming, chaos struck.Facing Mitchell Santner , Mendis lost his balance attempting a forceful stroke and accidentally trod onto his stumps, getting out hit wicket for 20. The moment was surreal—GT were 67/2 in 6.2 overs and cruising—until that lapse shifted the game’s tone.Sai Sudharsan continued valiantly with his sixth fifty of the season, while Washington Sundar’s 48 kept GT in touch. But with wickets falling at regular intervals, and Sudharsan bowled in the 16th over, GT’s chase slowly unravelled.MI’s bowlers held their nerve in the death overs despite heavy dew.

Carlos Alcaraz, the defending champion at Roland Garros, displayed remarkable sportsmanship during his French Open fourth-round victory against Ben Shelton on Sunday, voluntarily conceding a point for an illegal shot that initially appeared to be a spectacular volley, leading to a 7-6 (8), 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 win.The incident occurred early in the second set when Shelton hit a passing shot beyond Alcaraz's reach at the net. Alcaraz's racket, which he had thrown, made contact with the ball and sent it back over the net.The chair umpire initially awarded the point to Alcaraz, but the second-seeded player approached the official to acknowledge that he wasn't holding his racket when it touched the ball, which is against the rules.The crowd on Court Philippe-Chatrier applauded Alcaraz's honest admission, and the point was awarded to Shelton, the 13th-seeded American.""It's a shame, because it was the 'Hot Shot' of the day,"" Alcaraz said later with a smile.""Crazy shot,"" Shelton remarked.""I thought, 'OK, I could not say anything.' But I would have felt guilty if I didn't say anything,"" Alcaraz explained later. ""It's just about if I know that I didn't [do], or I did, a wrong thing.... I have to say. I have to be honest with myself. I have to be honest with Ben, with everyone. ... It's just about the respect we have against each other, and I think that sports, in general, should be like this.""The moment came at a crucial point in the match, turning what would have been a 40-30 lead for Alcaraz into a break point opportunity for Shelton.Alcaraz managed to save that break point and five others in a 20-point game, eventually securing a two-set lead in the match between the two 22-year-old power hitters.""I thought it was clean, you know? I thought he hit the volley, and [then] the racket flew out of his hand,"" Shelton said. ""I was kind of surprised that he was, like, 'No, I let go of the racket and threw it.' ...

Carmelo Anthony’s journey to New York Knicks, thanks to Amar’e Stoudemire

How Amar’e Stoudemire Influenced Carmelo Anthony’s Trade to the New York Knicks

Amar’e Stoudemire embraced New York





For Carmelo Anthony, the New York Knicks were a big part of his journey. The legendary career he has built, thanks to the legacy of the New York Knicks, has been commendable. He spoke about how he managed to find space in the fast-paced environment and how it was Amar’e Stoudemire who convinced him to take up the opportunity even when he was absolutely uncertain about the idea of it.Speaking on his podcast ”7 PM in Brooklyn with Carmelo Anthony,” Carmelo Anthony discussed how he moved from Denver Nuggets to New York Knicks. From 2003 to 2011, he was associated with the Nuggets. From 2011 to 2017, he was associated with the Knicks. He said he didn’t feel like leaving the Nuggets, but then, he realized the team was rebuilding without him. He has always been a fan of the Knicks.Anthony discussed his move from Nuggets, since the team began rebuilding. ”When I got to Denver, they started to rebuild. But they didn’t tell me. They told him they started to rebuild the roster. I'm like, ""Okay, they were not about to, we just went to the West Conference Finals. We won two possessions away from winning the championship."" Yeah. I do think we've got Orlando out of there that year. Yeah. Yeah. So, we are two possessions away from winning the championship, right? So, I break that up.So, now all that start to transpire in Denver. And I say, ""Look, if y'all going to rebuild, let's work on this together and let's find it. Let's get a place,” Anthony said.Unaware, but excited, Anthony felt New York was his best option. He then said, "" They came to me and said, ""What places do you want?"" I said, ""There's only one place I want to go to, and it's New York."" And they Oh, no. Oh, no. New York has nothing that we want. But we have a deal in Utah for you. They were going to send me to Utah. George Carl wanted to send me to Utah. He wanted Favor. That's crazy.“Further, Carmelo said, “Like, I didn't want to go third, fourth, fiddle with somebody else. Right. Right. So, I came to New York. It's New York. This is my type of energy. This is my energy, my homegrown family. Like, I don't need it if I'm going to go anywhere, I want to be in front of that energy, right? Because I know what I was chasing at that point in time. But if I can do it in New York with something that he's already started, he jumps start it, right? So if I can come here and help him out and we do it together. Oh my gosh. And that was all we used to talk about…”Amar’e Stoudemire said, “I think for me it was more so wanting to display my full skill set, right? And I felt like coming to New York would allow me to do that because Mike Danton knew my full skill set. And I was somewhat not afraid of the city, right? A lot of the guys lived out in, you know, up, you know, upstate more Westchester areas.”He added, “ I'm like, ""No, I'm moving to the city. Like, I'm embracing this."" You know what I'm saying? And as a player, it was a challenge for me. I'm like, ""All right, cool. I'm down with this challenge."" Like, I'm not shying away from trying to be my best self, you know, and to make my teammates better and try to build something here.He added, “And we started out solid like 500. Yeah. And I was fed up. I'm like, listen, I'm tired of being on the team. I'm tired of being like this facilitator. I got to really take over. And you did. We all remember that stretch. I think it was 20 straight 25-30 games, whatever, 30 or something.

“A drug dealer”: Stefon Diggs accused of handing out ‘pink cocaine’ on boat party with women as NFL stays silent,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/a-drug-dealer-stefon-diggs-accused-of-handing-out-pink-cocaine-on-boat-party-with-women-as-nfl-stays-silent/articleshow/121491353.cms,"Stefon Diggs faces scrutiny after a video surfaced (Image via AP)

Stefon Diggs under fire as viral boat video ignites drug-related rumors

Coach Mike Vrabel and the Patriots respond with discretion





New England Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs is back in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons. A recently surfaced video shows the star NFL player on a boat with a group of women, allegedly handing them a bag filled with pink crystals. The footage, which quickly spread across social media, has fueled intense speculation over the nature of the substance — with many users suspecting it to be “pink cocaine,” though there is no confirmation of that claim.In the viral video, Stefon Diggs is seen chatting casually with three women who reportedly referred to him as “Daddy” before he passed around the bag of pink material. “Yikes: NFL fans are speculating that Stefon Diggs handed these three girls what looks to be pink c*caine after he asked them to call him Daddy,” one user wrote on X (formerly Twitter). Others followed suit with similar reactions, suggesting Diggs was “serving pink cocaine” and even labeling him “a football player, pimp and a drug dealer. ”Despite the wave of viral commentary, there is currently no official evidence confirming that the substance was illicit. Still, the video has created a media storm, putting both Diggs and the Patriots in a difficult position during the offseason.When asked about the situation, Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel addressed the controversy during a media session ahead of an optional team practice, which Diggs did not attend.“It’s something that we’re aware of. Obviously, we want to make great decisions on and off the field,” Vrabel said. He added that his discussions with Diggs “will remain between him I and the club.”The NFL has chosen not to comment on the situation at this time, with a league spokesperson telling the Associated Press there would be no statement regarding the video.Also Read: T.J.

Cardi B, who filed for divorce from rapper Offset last year, was reportedly also on the boat during the controversial outing.As the video continues to circulate online, all eyes are on the NFL and Stefon Diggs’ camp for an official response.","New England Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs is back in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons.

'I don't want to be a one-season wonder': Punjab Kings' Shashank Singh





Shashank Singh, in an exclusive interview with TimesofIndia.com, had given Shreyas Iyer a new moniker: Punjab Kings' ""captain fantastic."" ""He has his own swag, he has his own aura, and he backs his own instinct,"" Shashank, who had played with Iyer in age-group cricket in Mumbai, had to say about his IPL captain.On Sunday, in a rain-affected Qualifier 2, Shreyas Iyer displayed everything that Shashank was talking about. He didn't celebrate his half-century; he batted with surety, and it looked like he was calculating the chase in his mind. Chasing 204, Iyer, who is called 'sarpanch' (head of the village) by Punjab Kings fans, took charge. In the 13th over bowled by Reece Topley, Shreyas hammered a hat-trick of sixes, each better than the last one.Iyer (87 not out off 41 balls; 5x4s, 8x6s) guided Punjab Kings to their first IPL final in 11 years. Punjab Kings defeated Mumbai Indians by five wickets at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.Punjab did get a flying start from Priyansh Arya (20 off 10 balls) and No. 3 Josh Inglis (38 off 21 balls). Inglis, especially, belted Bumrah for 20 runs in his first over. Not everyday does Bumrah get that kind of treatment.But Iyer found an able partner in Nehal Wadhera, who is called Ludhiana's Yuvraj Singh. Wadhera scored a counter-attacking 29-ball 48 and forged an 84-run stand for the fourth wicket in just 47 balls.Shreyas Iyer etched his name in the history books. He became the first IPL captain to take three different teams to the IPL finals. Iyer had led Delhi Capitals to the final in 2020, guided Kolkata Knight Riders to the title in 2024, and now has steered Punjab Kings. He is also the first captain to lead two different teams in successive finals.Not to forget, Mumbai Indians had never lost defending 200-plus, and now they've been knocked out doing so with an over to spare.Earlier, it looked like the Shreyas Iyer-led team had lost its steam after finishing top of the IPL points table. They were blown away by a red-hot Royal Challengers Bengaluru in Qualifier 1 at Mullanpur, and then they gave away too many freebies against Mumbai Indians in Qualifier 2.On Tuesday, they will have a chance to take revenge for the humiliation they had to face in front of their home crowd.Shreyas Iyer won the flip of the coin and, because of the weather, opted to field. The match was delayed for a couple of hours because of the rain, but it finally started, and there was no reduction in overs.Mumbai Indians rode on a power-packed start from Jonny Bairstow and Tilak Varma, and a late flourish by Naman Dhir, to post an imposing 203/6.Barring the first over bowled by Arshdeep Singh, the Punjab outfit looked completely at sea. They were wayward with the ball and abysmal in the field. If this was not enough, PBKS were later penalised for a slow over rate, and an extra fielder was brought into the circle for the last two overs.Rohit Sharma got a reprieve in the second over after Azmatullah Omarzai dropped a tough chance. It was not an easy catch as he had to back-pedal a long way to reach it; he got both hands to it but couldn't control it.The dropped catch didn't cost PBKS much, as Marcus Stoinis got the prized wicket and celebrated it by thumping his chest, which probably was the only time Punjab players celebrated with jubilation.Bairstow wasted no time in unleashing his trademark aggression. He took the attack to the Punjab bowlers right from the outset, peppering the boundary ropes and racing to 38 off just 24 deliveries. However, as the pitch began to grip and slow down, PBKS managed to claw their way back. Vyshak Vijaykumar gave the breakthrough, removing Bairstow with a knuckle ball.The experienced duo of Tilak Varma and Suryakumar Yadav steadied the ship. Their 72-run partnership for the third wicket came at a rapid pace. Both batters looked in control, mixing caution with aggression, before Punjab struck at a vital moment — right before and after the second strategic timeout.Yuzvendra Chahal, who was playing the match with an injection in his bowling hand, was sent on a leather hunt by Suryakumar Yadav, but the veteran spinner won the battle. Suryakumar kept playing the sweep shot against Chahal, but the leggie had the last laugh. It was pushed in the air a little; Suryakumar went down on his knee and slog-swept it, but didn't get the elevation, and Nehal Wadhera caught it near deep mid-wicket.In a sudden twist, both Suryakumar Yadav and Tilak Varma were dismissed for identical scores of 44, halting MI's momentum just when it looked like they would surge past 220.Naman Dhir's late blitz provided the final flourish. The swashbuckling batter smashed a quickfire 37 off just 18 balls, peppering the off-side and clearing the ropes to perfection. His knock ensured MI crossed the psychological 200-run mark.","Punjab Kings defeated Mumbai Indians by five wickets at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.
