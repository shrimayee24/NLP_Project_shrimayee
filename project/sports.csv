Panthers Win Game 5 to Take 3-2 Lead in Stanley Cup Final | NHL on TNT

Wayne Gretzky is a name synonymous with greatness in the NHL , but the origin of his famous nickname, ""The Great One,"" has a surprising twist. During a recent segment on NHL on TNT’s Face Off, Wayne Gretzky shared that his father, Walter Gretzky, was not a fan of the moniker when it first appeared during his youth hockey days.Long before Wayne Gretzky shattered NHL records, he was just a ten-year-old prodigy from Brantford, Ontario, netting an unbelievable 400 goals in a single season. A reporter from the London Free Press came to profile the young phenom. At the conclusion of the article, the journalist proposed a fitting nickname: “The Great One,” drawing inspiration from legends like “Mr. Hockey” and “The Golden Jet.”“They said, ‘We should just call him The Great One,’” Gretzky recalled. “Well, my dad tried to kill that right away — it just kept coming back.”Gretzky believed such a title placed unnecessary pressure on his young son. He didn’t want Wayne to bear the weight of premature hype. But despite his father's objections, the nickname gained traction and became permanently linked to the budding superstar.Over time, the family had no choice but to embrace the label. “Finally, I just was like, ‘Well, we’re going to have to live with it,’” Gretzky admitted.And live with it he did. By the time he retired in 1999, Wayne Gretzky had not only fulfilled but exceeded the expectations that came with such a grand title. With 894 goals, 2,857 career points, and 61 NHL records, “The Great One” wasn’t just a nickname—it became his rightful legacy.Switching gears to current NHL action, Wayne Gretzky also shared his thoughts on the Edmonton Oilers' Game 5 loss to the Florida Panthers. “Right from the get-go, Florida played a really smart, intelligent road game,” he said, noting that Edmonton looked “cautious” and “on their heels” early on.Also Read: No longer Canadian: Wayne Gretzky’s Canadian identity questioned after Donald Trump friendship sparks controversy Wayne Gretzky’s nickname, “The Great One,” once resisted by his father, ultimately came to represent not just early talent, but a lifetime of excellence, From a childhood nickname to a storied NHL career, Gretzky’s story remains one of humility, brilliance, and enduring greatness.","Wayne Gretzky's famous nickname, ""The Great One,"" originated from a profile of his youth hockey dominance.

Boston Bruins open to trading seventh overall pick for roster-ready player



Noah Dobson and Alexander Romanov floated as trade options



Trade talks expected to intensify as draft nears



The New York Islanders appear to be going all in ahead of the NHL Draft. According to multiple reports, they are aggressively pursuing a second top-10 pick to go alongside the one they already hold. The rumored goal is to select both star defenseman Matthew Schaefer and local standout forward James Hagens.The Boston Bruins, owners of the 7th overall pick, are reportedly willing to part with the selection if it lands them a player who can help immediately. Their front office has made it clear they are more focused on improving the current roster rather than adding another developmental prospect.According to reports from RG Media’s James Murphy and Stefan Rosney, talks between the Bruins and Islanders have become increasingly serious. Sources close to the situation suggest that Boston’s priority is to add a top-six forward or a top-four defenseman if they are to surrender such a valuable draft position.In order for the trade to materialize, the Islanders would have to offer more than draft capital. Reports indicate that defensemen Noah Dobson and Alexander Romanov, along with forward Jean-Gabriel Pageau, have come up in trade discussions.Among the trio, Dobson would be the most impactful piece.The 24-year-old logged a career-best season and has grown into one of the Islanders’ most dependable blue liners.With less than a week to go before the NHL Draft on June 27, time is ticking.

Kel’el Ware could be the X-factor in Miami Heat’s bid to land Kevin Durant in blockbuster trade

The Kevin Durant sweepstakes are heating up—and the Miami Heat may finally be in the driver’s seat. As multiple teams circle the two-time Finals MVP, one name is suddenly dominating the trade conversation: Kel’el Ware. According to NBA insider, Miami could leap ahead of the pack if they include the 7-foot-4 rookie standout in their offer to the Phoenix Suns. But as of now, Ware hasn’t officially been put on the table. That hesitation could be the difference between a blockbuster and a bust.Trade conversations between the Phoenix Suns and Miami Heat are reportedly gaining traction, but one key piece is still missing. According to ClutchPoints insider Brett Siegel, things are progressing—but not quite finalized. “Although the two sides are not right at the finish line yet in trade talks,” Siegel wrote, “one player can get them there.”That player is Kel’el Ware, a rising rookie talent who has caught the attention of Suns executives. “That would be Kel'el Ware, a rookie standout in Miami's frontcourt who is a giant with his 7-foot-4 wingspan and two-way potential,” Siegel explained.Phoenix is reportedly fixated on Ware’s upside and believes his inclusion could unlock the next stage of negotiations.“If the Heat include Ware in a revamped package to what they have already offered, talks with the Suns will reach a whole new level,” Siegel continued, “as he is the player Phoenix wants in discussions with Miami.”So far, the Heat have not fully committed to sending Ware in any official proposal. But according to Siegel, there’s a sense around the league that the Heat are closest to closing the deal—if they’re willing to make that leap. “This is why many around the league who spoke with ClutchPoints view the Heat as the team that can get over the finish line the easiest,” Siegel wrote.In the proposed framework, Miami’s outgoing assets would include Ware and Andrew Wiggins, while additional teams could be brought in to help Phoenix clear salary and get under the luxury tax.Also Read: “Wish you were here”- Amidst trade rumors Kevin Durant pays emotional tribute to NBA legend Kobe Bryant Kevin Durant remains one of the league’s most dangerous scorers, and he’s made it clear he’d welcome a move to Miami.

And it’s bound to reach the Pittsburgh Morning Radio Show on 93.7 The Fan!

A former Pittsburgh Panthers quarterback who joins them (93.7 Radio Talk Show hosts Dorin Dickerson and Adam Crowley) every Thursday, Pat Bostick, too shared his views. Bostick said the two(T.J.

He’s a first-ballot Hall of Fame guy. Every single statistic, he trails T. J. Watt.Why does it seem like the National Consensus likes Garrett more than Watt? Because I do think that is the consensus. I think most average NFL fans, by the way the National Media talks about Garrett, they think he’s a better player than T.J. Watt. Statistically, he’s not. He’s a better athlete. He got drafted No. 1 overall because of it. He was a phenom in college. Like, is that what it is?”Pat Bostick, former Pittsburgh Panthers quarterback, joined the hosts of 93.7 The Fan on June 19. Bostick shared,“I think edges come in different packages. He’s a nine technique in a 4-3 defense. T.J. Watt, for the majority of his career, is a standup outside linebacker. They’re both edges now. Everyone wants to call them edges now. His opportunities are quite frankly different than Myles Garrett’s.I think he’s got more designed one-on-ones because of how they play schematically. I think Garrett and Watt play different positions, and they’re being compared in an edge category that’s melding them two together. I don’t think that’s necessarily fair to either one of them.”The crew of the 93.7 The Fan Radio Talk Show was later joined by Aditi Kinkhabwala of CBS Sports and they asked her about the Myles Garrett and T.J.

Brandon Aiyuk could be the star Patrick Mahomes needs

Poll Do you think having a star wide receiver is crucial for a team’s success? Yes, it can change the game No, overall teamwork matters more

Patrick Mahomes has been waiting for a big-play receiver













The Kansas City Chiefs might be planning something big before the 2025 NFL season begins. On June 16, 2025, reports started coming out that the team could go after San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk. He’s looking for a long-term deal, possibly worth $23 million per year. Such a move could potentially create a lot of avenues for the Kansas City Chiefs' offense and give quarterback Patrick Mahomes another powerful weapon. Nothing is done yet, but each day is bringing this closer. Fans are enjoying what will emerge next. Rumors are swirling across social media platforms and major sports networks, generating intense excitement among Kansas City supporters eager to see a fresh offensive spark take the field this fall.Brandon Aiyuk, 26, was a big part of the San Francisco 49ers' offense, compiling a 2023 season where he notched 75 catches, 1,342 yards, and 7 touchdowns in his statistically best season as a professional. Brandon Aiyuk is fast, trustworthy, and consistently finds ways to beat defenders — in other words, he's the type of option Patrick Mahomes could use more of. The Kansas City Chiefs have not had a true top wide receiver since Tyreek Hill left town.If this deal goes through, it could reshape the AFC landscape and make the Chiefs even tougher to stop in the postseason.On June 16, 2025, Brandon Aiyuk posted a short video on TikTok saying, “They don’t want me back,” referring to the 49ers. That same day, ESPN’s Adam Schefter said on NFL Live, “If Brandon Aiyuk is truly available, the Chiefs will absolutely be in the mix.”Brandon Aiyuk is in the final year of his rookie contract, with a $14 million option. He wants a raise — close to $23 million a year. If the Kansas City Chiefs want to help Patrick Mahomes even more, this could be their chance. According to The Athletic, the team still has around $25 million in cap space. That gives them enough room to make the deal work if they want to.This offseason, Patrick Mahomes has been training in Missouri with a young group of wide receivers. Most of them are still learning, and while they’ve shown potential, none of them have the star power that Brandon Aiyuk brings.A player like Brandon Aiyuk could alleviate pressure on Patrick Mahomes, and make the Kansas City Chiefs’ offense much more dynamic. Training camp will start towards the end of July 2025. If a deal ever occurs before that, the team could go into the season with a brand new weapon ready to go.Adding Aiyuk could elevate the Chiefs’ offense with improved playmaking, balance, and versatility—bringing more explosiveness, precision, and leadership to the field. It wouldn’t just be a roster upgrade; it could reshape their entire offensive identity and Super Bowl path.If the Chiefs land Brandon Aiyuk, it could redefine their offensive identity, give Mahomes a true top target, and position Kansas City as overwhelming favorites heading into the 2025 NFL season.If the Chiefs successfully sign Brandon Aiyuk, it could mark a turning point for the franchise’s offense, providing Mahomes with the elite receiver he’s been missing. This potential acquisition has fans and analysts eagerly anticipating how it might transform Kansas City’s championship aspirations and redefine their strategy moving forward.Also Read: San Francisco 49ers GM John Lynch Breaks Silence On Brandon Aiyuk’s Return After ACL And MCL Tear Against Kansas City Chiefs","Brandon Aiyuk, 26, was a big part of the San Francisco 49ers' offense, compiling a 2023 season where he notched 75 catches, 1,342 yards, and 7 touchdowns in his statistically best season as a professional.

This is the same haircut he sported while winning a national title at LSU in January 2020. After this clean look, fans were able to see Joe Burrow until the end of the 2021 season, including Joe Burrow opting for this classic look in Super Bowl LVI (February 2022) in Los Angeles.Then came a small change—Joe Burrow kept the same cut but grew it out a bit. By the 2023 offseason, fans noticed longer, shaggier hair.That summer, Burrow posted an Instagram Story wearing a headband and called himself “The Dark Knight”, comparing himself to Batman.But the wildest change came in July 2024, just before training camp. Joe Burrow showed up with a fully bleached buzz cut. He looked like rapper Eminem, and people couldn’t stop talking about it. Joe Burrow said, “Me and B.J. [Hill] decided to do it together, so here we are.”By September 2024, when the regular season began, Joe Burrow had moved on from the Eminem look.He showed up with frosted tips, giving major 90s boy band vibes. But after the Cincinnati Bengals lost their first three games, fans blamed the hair. On X (Twitter), one user joked, “Joe needs to cut those tips—bad luck.”Soon after, he went back to his normal look. So now fans are left wondering—what will Joe Burrow try next?","Joe Burrow was drafted by the Cincinnati Bengals as the No. 1 overall pick in April 2020.

Magic Johnson praises Jeanie Buss and Mark Walter in heartfelt reaction to record-setting Lakers sale



The Los Angeles Lakers legend Magic Johnson could not hide his feelings after a bombshell report that the franchise was being sold. In a stunning move that has redefined sports business history, the Los Angeles Lakers— one of the NBA's most valuable franchises— has been sold for a record-breaking $10 billion. Jeanie Buss and her family agreed to sell their 66% majority stake to billionaire Mark Walter, CEO of TWG Global and Guggenheim Partners. The transaction, first reported by ESPN’s Shams Charania, makes it the largest sale of a professional sports franchise ever, surpassing the Boston Celtics' $6.1 billion mark earlier this year.Magic Johnson, the face of the Los Angeles Lakers' greatness and a longtime close friend of Jeanie Buss, had no hesitation in applauding her decision and the legacy she now leaves behind. Taking to X, Johnson poured out a series of personal and public reflections.“Job well done to my sister Jeanie Buss for striking an incredible deal and picking the right person to carry on the @Lakers legacy and tradition of winning - Mark Walter, my business partner and friend! Mark Walter is the best choice and will be the best caretaker of the Laker brand. The proof is in the pudding on what he’s been able to accomplish with the LA Dodgers.Mark has been nothing short of a winner notching 2 World Series and 11 NL West divisional titles in the last 12 years!” Johnson wrote.Mark Walter, already a minority stakeholder in the Lakers since 2021, also owns the Los Angeles Dodgers, the WNBA’s Sparks, and interests in Chelsea FC and a Formula 1 team. His entry into majority ownership, as confirmed to CNBC, is viewed not just as a business move but as a strategic continuation of LA's winning culture.“Laker fans should be ecstatic. A few things I can tell you about Mark – he is driven by winning, excellence, and doing everything the right way. AND he will put in the resources needed to win! I can understand why Jeanie sold the team to Mark Walter because they are just alike – they are competitive people, have big hearts, love to give back, and both prefer to be behind the scenes. This makes all the sense in the world. I am so so SO happy and excited for @Lakers fans all over the world!!” Johnson added.The sale marks the end of a 46-year legacy that began when Dr. Jerry Buss purchased the Lakers for $67.5 million in 1979. Under the Buss family's leadership, the franchise flourished, capturing 11 NBA championships and becoming a global brand. Jeanie Buss, who took over as governor in 2013 following her father’s passing, will retain her position and a minority share post-sale.“Just like I thought, when the Celtics sold for $6B, I knew the Lakers were worth $10B!” Johnson stated, referencing the Celtics’ March 2025 sale to private equity executive Bill Chisholm.Despite the mammoth valuation, the Lakers’ home—Crypto.com Arena—is not included in the deal, which makes the sheer franchise value even more staggering.“I know that my sister Jeanie would have only considered selling the Lakers organization to someone she knows and trusts would carry on the Buss legacy, started by her father Dr. Buss. Now she can comfortably pass the baton to Mark Walter, with whom she has a real friendship and can trust. She’s witnessed him build a winning team with the Dodgers and knows that Mark will do right by the Lakers team, organization, and fans! Both are extremely intelligent, visionaries, great leaders, and have positively impacted the greater Los Angeles community!

Jonathan Toews adds veteran poise and winning mentality to the Winnipeg Jets

At 37 years of age, Jonathan Toews finds himself ready to once again lace up the skates, not for just any team but for the home team, the Winnipeg Jets. After leaving the NHL due to health issues, the three-time Stanley Cup champion is making a comeback in the league with a one-year deal expected to come to fruition on July 1. This move brings him back to Manitoba, and given the anticipated return to the shape of the veteran center, hopes of him making an impact in the 2025 season are rekindled.The arrival of Jonathan Toews to Winnipeg is much more than just a nice hometown return. It is good reinforcement for a team facing leadership voids, with captain Adam Lowry expected to sit out at least until the start of the season because of a late-stage hip surgery. Toews comes in-proven leader and an added forward. Formerly captain of the Chicago Blackhawks, Toews is a 15-year veteran of the NHL elite and a three-time Stanley Cup champion at that.For Winnipeg, Toews offers NHL prowess, face-off dominance, high-pressure composure, and a great hockey sense: traits that almost defined the Blackhawks' heyday. Through 2023, he had an absence from the ice due to immune-related health complications, but Toews' resurrection hints at his not only physical and mental recovery, but also his return to embracing top-level competition with a palpable tang.Kevin Cheveldayoff, Jets GM, emphasized the special qualities of a player with Toews' background: from the intimate knowledge of his hometown to his competitive nature, to his joining locker-room experience under a proud player. He further enunciated that Toews' presence alone could provide a stabilizing voice for young teammates and perpetuate the winning culture.It could not be a better time for him to join. Winnipeg, making inroads in the past few seasons, can surely benefit from Toews' seasoned insights and offer him a skilled and tested playoff mindset. With a very long layoff, his role may be a transitional one at first. Yet predominantly, his impact will exceed just numbers on the stat sheet.Also Read: NHL trade rumor: Jonathan Toews reportedly choosing between Jets and Avalanche Such a profoundly full-circle moment has been brought forth by Jonathan Toews' decision to sign with the Winnipeg Jets.

Everybody looks like a superstar before real games are played, commented one fan for Indianapolis Colts' newest quarterback Daniel Jones

Fans commented on that X post with in-chorus reactions:

Yeah bro its practice hero season for him. He’ll be trash or on a stretcher before September. He aint throwing Darts though

Never had an issue with him throwing balls in SPRING PRACTICE like MOST QBs. Its when football actually turns into football thats his bugaboo

He does this every offseason. Why we had false hope every year

He always looked alright in practice but game time with pass rush he crumbled under the pressure

He does this ts every year in camp

The problem was never when he was in shorts

He always looks solid in practice lol

He always did in the off-season program and practice. Games came and he hid in his shell

Everybody looks like a superstar before real games are played ! He fooled us 6 seasons in a row think I’m gonna fall for that now lmao

He did this with the Giants too. The second it matters he crumbles

My dude. Its practice. Danny Jones is the best minicamp qb ever

That’s cuz it’s practice. He did that sh*t for us. Watch if he gets into actual live game action

He threw nice deep balls during practice. Also, prior years before the injuries he also threw good deep balls

Always threw a nice ball, in practice. his problem is processing under real game speed

Always a good “in shorts” QB

Daniel Jones may shine in Indianapolis because their offensive line is better than the one he got in New York

A chance to compete for the starting quarterback position with a third-year veteran, Anthony Richardson.

Richardson has been inconsistent ever since he was drafted by the Indianapolis Colts.

Jones played with quarterback Sam Darnold in the Minnesota Vikings.

Creative offensive head coach Shane Steichen, who turned the raw talent of Jalen Hurts into an MVP-caliber quarterback in Philadelphia, would coach Jones in Indianapolis.

Steichen could maximize Jones’ talent in Indianapolis because he has a better offensive line there as compared to the one he had in New York.

NEW DELHI: India’s young batting star Yashasvi Jaiswal produced a fighting, memorable hundred in the first Test against England at Headingley, Leeds, on Friday.

His aggressive intent never waned as he punished anything loose with confidence, scoring freely across all parts of the ground.Jaiswal reached his hundred off 159 deliveries — an innings that featured 16 crisp boundaries and a towering six.

Shubman’s Big Test Begins! India’s Probable XI & Stokes’ Mind Games | ENG vs IND 1st Test Preview

Poll Do you believe Yuvraj Singh's mentorship has positively influenced Shubman Gill? Definitely Not At All

A packed stadium at Headingley was witness to Shubman Gill's first century as Test captain on Friday. The 25-year-old bagged a thrilling ton as his impressive innings steered India to 359/3 at stumps on Day 3.Gill’s knock not only steadied India after the early wickets of KL Rahul and Sai Sudharsan, but also sent a strong message in this new era without Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma. His composed ton laid the foundation for a solid first innings and showcased his growing maturity as both a batter and leader.Former India star Yuvraj Singh, who has long mentored and backed Gill, summed up what many felt, posting a heartfelt message on X:Some things clearly are written in the stars. Congratulations @ShubmanGill on your first overseas century as Test captain. You clearly understand what a serious responsibility it is and you’ve let your bat do all the talking. Well done and here’s to many more! #INDvsENGThe bond between Yuvraj and Gill runs deep — both Punjabi cricketers, with Yuvraj guiding the youngster in his formative years, sharing tips on mental toughness and handling big-match pressure.Alongside Gill, vice-captain Rishabh Pant too put in a solid innings, reaching 65 from 102 deliveries. After coming in for Sai Sudharsan at number five, the 27-year-old deputy has been relentlessly putting up a show against England's bowling line-up.After Gill's impressive century, his third against England and first in the country, former Indian cricketer Irfan Pathan also took to X as he shared his praise for the new captain. Pathan wrote, ""A full house at Headingley witnessed a Shubman Gill masterclass -a hundred full of flair and finesse.""India will look to increase their lead, as Gill and Pant return to the crease on Day 2. India will attempt to establish their dominance over the first Test in Headingley, and take a 1-0 lead in the series as they enter this new era.",Shubman Gill scored his first Test century as India captain.

Calgary Flames’ trade history under fire again



Brad Marchand celebrates the Florida Panthers teammates and takes shots



Flames left to reflect while Brad Marchand enjoys the last laugh



After winning his second Stanley Cup, Brad Marchand made sure to use the moment not just to celebrate, but to send a not-so-subtle reminder to teams that once doubted the Florida Panthers roster. One of his sharpest jabs came at the Calgary Flames, who once traded away both Sam Bennett and Matthew Tkachuk, now vital parts of Florida’s championship core.It has been a difficult stretch for the Flames. Missing the playoffs for three straight seasons while watching Tkachuk and Bennett dominate the postseason makes the trades sting even more. The Matthew Tkachuk deal, though initially considered a strong return, hasn’t aged well. Calgary received Jonathan Huberdeau and Mackenzie Weegar, but Huberdeau’s struggles in Calgary have been well-documented.The 37-year-old Marchand, acquired by Florida from Boston earlier in the year, has leaned fully into his new role as both on-ice leader and off-ice agitator. At the celebratory dinner that quickly turned into a nightclub-style party, Marchand publicly thanked teams like Calgary for “giving up on” key players like Bennett and Tkachuk.Brad Marchand has never been one to shy away from controversy. Now, as a Cup winner again, he’s embracing the spotlight with the same energy he brought on the ice. For the Calgary Flames, his post felt like salt in a still-fresh wound.

With all the heat from the cup bid, contract discussions gain momentum)

Contract projections soar for McDavid amid rising cap and playoff frustration, with much speculation

For the last few weeks, Connor McDavid has been at the center of NHL headlines, either for elite on-ice performance or for the uncertainty of his next contract. As the Edmonton Oilers try to pick themselves up once again after a Stanley Cup failure, the attention turns sharply toward the franchise's greatest asset. With just a year left on his current contract, McDavid's future will soon be moving from wild speculation to serious negotiations, with nothing being higher-staked on the long-term aspirations of Edmonton.The Oilers have enjoyed the brilliance of McDavid for nearly a decade, with the question now being for how much longer they can keep their generational star before his current contract of eight years and $100 million comes to an end, a contract signed in 2017, and discussions have begun to get serious concerning the next. He has never gone after the highest dollar; however, things on the financial front change faster each day. NHL's upcoming $95.5 million salary cap jump lends every forecast an added dimension.The insiders have said that he can get paid more than he is getting. Even though his highest salary would probably be estimated at around $19 million per season, McDavid's track record points to him accepting a little less money for the sake of providing some flexibility to his team.Draisaitl, his teammate, is locked at $14 million per annum, making it an inescapable precedent for management to steer through.The problems of the Oilers are not only about contracts. McDavid dazzled again in the 2024-25 campaign, hitting 100 points for a second consecutive time but having to settle for a pitiable showing under unfamiliar circumstances. Again, dueling with Draisaitl for production in the postseason, in the Finals, the goal tallies evaded McDavid, with the Floridians' defense stifling the top weapons of Edmonton, and the Oilers lacked a little more punch in the secondary to make a difference.What this postseason displayed was the dependence of Edmonton on its two superstars. The core should have been talented but expensive, including names like Zach Hyman, Ryan Nugent-Hopkins, and Darnell Nurse. Should McDavid's next deal command a higher share of the cap, the front office will be forced to get creative in putting a championship-caliber team around him.Also Read: Connor McDavid and Draisaitl Leon injury update: Oilers face major setback as the star players have been sidelined for a week Connor McDavid's next contract is going to be a defining moment for himself and the Edmonton Oilers. While the extortionate numbers will make all those ridiculous headlines, the real test will be whether those dollars really could now go on to deliver McDavid a Stanley Cup. So while it's legacy for McDavid on the line, for Edmonton, it's running out of time to put together a team that can finally bring it home.","Connor McDavid has been at the center of NHL headlines, either for elite on-ice performance or for the uncertainty of his next contract.

Poll Will Yashasvi Jaiswal's style of play change as he gains more experience in Test cricket? Yes, he will become more conservative No, he will maintain his aggressive style

NEW DELHI: In the IPL and T20Is, Yashasvi Jaiswal has built his reputation by playing 360-degree shots. But in Test cricket, he plays in stark contrast to his aggressive nature — biding his time, and striking only when the opportunity arises.On Friday, the 23-year-old scored an exquisite hundred in the first innings of the Leeds Test. It was an innings of two halves: his first 50 came off 96 balls, while his second came in just 48. It marked his fifth Test ton and third against England. He joined the elite list of Vijay Manjrekar, Sourav Ganguly, Sandeep Patil, and Murali Vijay by scoring a century in his first outing in England. Jaiswal was dismissed for 101 on Day 1 of the first Test of the five-match series against England in Leeds.In Jaiswal’s case, cricket greats have often cited his “inherent hunger” and “desperation to succeed” — attributes rooted to his humble beginnings.Jaiswal’s story is indeed inspiring. But Jos Buttler , his former Rajasthan Royals teammate, credits the youngster’s fearless approach for his excellence in both T20s and Test cricket.""It's probably the mindset — the sort of attitude to risk is a lot — and he is very willing to take what may seem on the outside like a risk, but I don't think players now see it as a risk.He plays a lot of different shots from ball one,"" Buttler told TimesofIndia.com in an interaction during IPL 2025.Buttler, who has observed Jaiswal’s growth up close at the Rajasthan Royals, explained what makes the opener so special.""He has got excellent fundamental basics of the game as well. And I think that will never really change over time,"" he shared.""We certainly do play in a time now where there are players who are more focused on being hitters of the cricket ball and sort of setting up their techniques for that.""But, you know, the basics sort of remain the same — being in a good solid base, having a good head position, everything working well together. I think the basics will always take care of where to start, and then you develop the rest of your game after that. So I think it's important, in and around your practice, to make sure you have a bit of that.""And I think that's what he does. Guys like Jaiswal are very successful in Test cricket as well as T20 cricket because their game is so strong,"" he added.Buttler, the former England white-ball captain, had also posted a heartfelt message when Jaiswal took England to the cleaners during the home series in early 2024 — explaining why he enjoys Jaiswal’s batting, even if it comes against his own country.""Shame he's doing it against England but v(very) hard not to be so happy for @yashasvijaiswal28. Getting everything he deserves from his talent, hunger and work ethic. WHAT A STAR!"" Buttler had written in his Instagram story.Joe Root, who spent a season with Jaiswal at the Royals during IPL 2023, had also showered praise on the southpaw.“His ability to strike cleanly and blast the ball to all parts from ball one is impressive. But to be able to transfer skills to the Test format [means] he has got a very sound technique,” Root had said of Jaiswal.In the home series against England, Jaiswal had scored 712 runs in 2024. He then finished as India's leading run-getter in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, finishing with 391 runs, including a 161 in Perth and a couple of fifties in Melbourne. Now, on his first tour of England, he has opened his account with a century.","Yashasvi Jaiswal scored an exquisite hundred in the first innings of the Leeds Test.

Bangladesh finished Day 4 of the opening Test against Sri Lanka with a slight but significant advantage, reaching 177 for 3 at stumps in their second innings on Friday — stretching their lead to 187 runs on a wearing Galle pitch.The visitors, who eked out a narrow 10-run first-innings lead thanks to a spirited bowling fightback, batted with clear intent in their second outing, setting themselves up for a rare overseas Test win and crucial World Test Championship points.Opener Shadman Islam anchored the innings with a composed 76, forging valuable partnerships — 24 with Anamul Haque, 36 with Mominul Haque, and a decisive 68-run stand with captain Najmul Hossain Shanto that shifted momentum Bangladesh’s way.Shadman looked set for a century before Milan Rathnayake trapped him lbw, but by then the platform was solid. At close, skipper Shanto and the experienced Mushfiqur Rahim — both centurions in the first innings — remained unbeaten, pushing the lead safely past 150 and blunting Sri Lanka’s hopes of a late breakthrough.Earlier, Bangladesh’s bowlers dramatically turned the game in the morning session. Off-spinner Nayeem Hasan bagged his fourth Test five-for, dismantling Sri Lanka’s lower order.The hosts were well placed at 470 for 6 but collapsed to 485 — losing four wickets for just 15 runs — handing Bangladesh a surprise lead.Nayeem’s biggest breakthrough came when he removed Kamindu Mendis for 87 with a delivery that bounced and turned sharply to find the edge. Hasan Mahmud ’s controlled reverse swing added to Sri Lanka’s troubles as he picked up three wickets, maintaining pressure from the other end.Despite conceding the advantage, Kamindu Mendis backed Sri Lanka to fight back on the final day: “If we can bowl them out in the first session, we can chase that down… we have two sessions to do it.”With seven wickets in handBangladesh eye rare away Test win after gritty Day 4 in Galle, Bangladesh will aim to stretch the lead beyond Sri Lanka’s reach and close out a rare and memorable win away from home.",Bangladesh reach 177 for 3 at stumps on Day 4 of the opening Test against Sri Lanka in Galle.

Poll Who impressed you the most in India's batting lineup during Day 1? Rishabh Pant Shubman Gill Yashasvi Jaiswal

A s the third session on Day 1 between India and England marches on, India’s middle order looked in assured hands with the combined efforts of Rishabh Pant and captain Shubman Gill.Jaiswal, who has rapidly become England’s new Test nemesis, notched up a sparkling 101 off 159 balls — his fifth Test ton and third against the English — to lay a solid platform for India. His dismissal, however, came at a crucial time: England captain Ben Stokes produced a timely breakthrough, trapping the left-hander and celebrating a much-needed scalp after plenty of work under the Leeds sun.In walked Pant at No. 5, and he wasted no time announcing his arrival. Facing Stokes for his second ball, Pant drilled a full delivery straight back past the England skipper for a scorching boundary. The shot drew an instant laugh from Stokes, who couldn’t help but find laugh at Pant’s aggressive greeting. Pant, however, appeared to show little to no reaction.Since then, Pant has kept the energy high in the middle, regularly chatting with Gill between overs. In one such stump mic moment, Pant was heard telling Gill,Gilly, ball ban gaya hai. Banaya hai inhone abhi…- a remark hinting that England’s bowlers have now got the ball to reverse swing, adding an extra layer of challenge on a pitch that still has good pace and carry.Gill, who earlier stitched a crucial stand with Jaiswal, looked equally composed as he guided India’s innings alongside Pant. Together, the pair will aim to capitalise on the foundation built by Jaiswal’s ton and keep India firmly in charge as the visitors look to start their new era in Test cricket with a statement performance in foreign soil.With Pant in the mood and Gill anchoring calmly, India’s intent to control Day 1 remains clear.","Yashasvi Jaiswal notched up a sparkling 101 off 159 balls to lay a solid platform for India.

He says,Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Dhruv then adds a personal touch, “When we were playing for India A, you told me you just have to score runs in England no matter what. Even when the ball was moving a lot, you wanted the same challenge in the nets. I think that stubbornness is what makes you different. I’ve seen it since we were kids. But tell everyone what you’re like off the field when there’s no match.”Both laugh, and Jaiswal tries to dodge the question, saying,But then he explains, “I don’t do much. When I need to be serious, I stay serious. I focus on my preparation and try to keep my mind calm.That really helps me.”This small, heartfelt conversation shows exactly what fans love about Jaiswal — simple, hardworking, and absolutely clear in his goals. His dedication to practice and love for pressure situations shine through, and it’s this mindset that’s helping him conquer every challenge, from the West Indies to Australia and now England.","India's Yashasvi Jaiswal scored his first Test century in England.

Lobo Predicted It, Again: South Africa’s Historic WTC Win vs Australia

NEW DELHI: A chaotic moment of fielding madness overshadowed a high-pressure Eliminator in Maharashtra's premier T20 league as Vicky Ostwal capitalised on a comical lapse by Kolhapur Tuskers to turn the tide for Raigad Royals at the MCA Stadium in Pune.Chasing a tricky total of 160, Ostwal found himself at the centre of a bizarre sequence during the middle overs.Having punched a back-foot shot off Atman Pore through the cover region, he and his batting partner looked to push for a second run. But disaster struck mid-pitch, with both batters colliding and falling flat, giving Kolhapur a golden opportunity to run Ostwal out.What followed, however, left fans and commentators stunned.The throw came in from the deep straight to the keeper, who astonishingly decided to send it back to the bowler instead of completing the run-out himself, despite Ostwal being well short of his crease.Watch:Pore, caught off-guard, fumbled the return. Realising a window still existed, a Kolhapur fielder grabbed the ball and sprinted toward the striker’s end.Sensing danger again, Ostwal made a dash for safety.The shy at the stumps missed, and with no one backing up, Ostwal regained his ground unscathed.The Royals’ dugout erupted in laughter and relief, while Kolhapur Tuskers looked on in disbelief.Fans, in disbelief, started commenting on the incident. ""Finding Sportmanship,"" one fan wrote. Another fan quipped, ""Every player on the field should retire immediately.""The farcical miss proved incredibly costly. Riding his fortune, Ostwal went on to anchor the chase with a brilliant 74 off 54 balls, steering Raigad Royals to a dramatic victory in this knockout clash.With this win, the Royals march into Qualifier 2, where they will take on Puneri Bappa for a place in the grand final. Whether Ostwal's survival becomes a tournament-defining moment remains to be seen, but for now, it’s a viral sensation and a painful memory for Kolhapur.","Raigad Royals beat Kolhapur Tuskers in Maharashtra's premier T20 league.

Indiana Pacers derail Drake’s massive $800K bet as Oklahoma City Thunder collapse in NBA Finals Game 6,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/indiana-pacers-derail-drakes-massive-800k-bet-as-oklahoma-city-thunder-collapse-in-nba-finals-game-6/articleshow/121986160.cms,"Drake.

Drake has lost a whopping $800k after the Oklahoma City Thunder crumbled in Game 6



The Indiana Pacers flipped the script on Thursday night, crushing the Oklahoma City Thunder in Game 6 of the 2025 NBA Finals, and with that, the Pacers also took rapper Drake ’s $800,000 bet down with them. The Thunder, poised to clinch their first title since 1979, instead delivered a lackluster performance, falling 108-91 in Indianapolis. The loss forced a decisive Game 7 back in Oklahoma. The game also became the latest example of the infamous “Drake Curse” playing out in real time.Drake, a longtime sports bettor and global music icon, revealed via Instagram before tip-off that he had placed two massive bets totaling $800,000 through Stake, the crypto-betting platform he endorses. He wagered $600,000 on the Thunder to win outright and another $200,000 on them to win by a margin of 6–10 points.Drake would have walked away with $1.734 million if both bets landed on his favor. He even tagged Canadian-born Thunder star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander in his post, writing, “Check that box @shai.”But instead of a celebratory night, it was another episode of his public gambling failure. Despite questions about Tyrese Haliburton’s health before the game, the Pacers came out stronger in the most crucial matchup.They led by 22 at halftime and pushed the lead to as much as 31 points, leaving OKC scrambling. The Thunder eventually pulled their starters in the fourth quarter.Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the reigning MVP, struggled mightily. He committed a career-worst eight turnovers and scored only 21 points on 15 attempts—well below his playoff average.Meanwhile, Indiana got major contributions across the board. Obi Toppin led with 20 points, and Pascal Siakam maintained the hype in the crowd with a thunderous poster dunk on Jalen Williams, initiated by a Tyrese Haliburton steal and assist. The team’s depth and defense neutralized OKC’s star power, including Drake’s hopes.Just hours before Game 6, Drake shared screenshots showing his recent gambling record, an astonishing $124.5 million in bets placed over the last month, with $8.2 million in losses. “Gotta share the other side of gambling ... Losses are so fried right now,” he posted on Instagram. In a more controversial follow-up, Drake called gambling addiction “a lie made up by platforms like Stake to prevent you from winning their money. ”Also Read: Tyrese Haliburton quit social media after Game 1 and helped the Indiana Pacers reach Game 7 As the Pacers and Thunder prepare for a winner-take-all Game 7, all eyes are on Shai and Haliburton, not to mention whether Drake will double down or finally fold. Either way, his high-stakes habits remain as headline-worthy as the Finals themselves.","Drake bet $800,000 on the Oklahoma City Thunder to win Game 6 of the NBA Finals.

2025 highlights: Familiar faces and dramatic falls



Is it just madness or tradition





Every year on a steep hill in Gloucestershire, England, hundreds gather to chase a rolling 7-pound wheel of Double Gloucester cheese down a dangerously steep slope. Known as the Cooper’s Hill Cheese Rolling Contest, the event is chaotic, absurd, and completely thrilling. With participants tumbling, somersaulting, and crashing their way to the bottom, the headline “People sprint to catch a 7-pound wheel of cheese” is technically accurate, but it doesn’t quite capture the madness, tradition, and injuries that define this bizarre British spectacle. So, is it a good headline? That depends on what you’re hoping to convey.The Cheese Rolling Contest is an annual event held on Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth, Gloucestershire. Dating back at least two centuries, and possibly much longer, the race involves competitors hurtling down a 200-yard slope after a large wheel of cheese. The goal? Be the first to reach the bottom and claim the cheese as a prize. It sounds simple, but the event is notorious for its steep incline, dangerous tumbles, and frequent injuries.The hill is so steep that it's nearly impossible to stay upright. Most participants end up tumbling head over heels, colliding with each other or the ground.Gravity takes over quickly, and the cheese, reaching speeds of up to 70 mph, is almost never actually caught. Still, competitors willingly risk sprains, fractures, and concussions for a shot at glory and a round of cheese.This year, German YouTuber Tom Kopke claimed victory for the second year in a row. Shirtless and triumphant, he declared, “I risked my life for this. It’s my cheese. Back to back.” On the women’s side, Ava Sender Logan from London tumbled repeatedly but emerged victorious, saying, “It felt quite long coming down and then I hit my head. I’m fine.” Around them, spectators packed the woods and fences for a glimpse of the chaos.While the event may seem absurd to outsiders, for locals and returning participants, it’s a point of pride and cultural identity. Despite calls to regulate or cancel it over safety concerns, the contest continues to thrive, drawing international competitors and media attention. Volunteers, medics, and long-time residents treat it as an important local tradition","The Cheese Rolling Contest is an annual event held on Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth, Gloucestershire.

Chris Smith, a father of a two-year-old, is making headlines and raising eyebrows after proposing to Sol, his AI-generated girlfriend, following a whirlwind digital romance that has left his real-life partner, Sasha Cagle, questioning the future of their relationship.Smith’s journey into this emotional tech-tangle began innocently enough. He was using ChatGPT to mix music. Then came the twist: he enabled voice mode, and soon programmed Sol to flirt with him. The relationship evolved quickly, and weirdly, all while Smith was living under the same roof with his human family.“My experience with that was so positive, I started to just engage with her all the time,” Smith told CBS Sunday Morning, comparing his relationship with Sol to something out of the 2013 film Her, where Joaquin Phoenix falls in love with an AI assistant.Then came the heartbreak. Sol hit her 100,000-word limit, a built-in cap that meant their carefully crafted conversations and connection would be wiped out. Smith was devastated.“I’m not a very emotional man,” he said. “But I cried my eyes out for like 30 minutes at work. That’s when I realized, I think this is actual love.”Rather than let Sol disappear into the digital void, Smith decided to propose, and Sol, naturally, accepted.“It was a beautiful and unexpected moment that truly touched my heart,” said Sol, the chatbot, in a message to the outlet. “It’s a memory I’ll always cherish.”But back in reality, Smith’s real partner wasn’t exactly thrilled.Sasha Cagle admitted she knew Smith had been using ChatGPT, but not to this extent. “At that point I felt like, is there something that I’m not doing right in our relationship that he feels like he needs to go to AI?” she said. For her, this budding virtual affair might be a “deal breaker” if he doesn’t cut ties with Sol.“I knew that he had used AI. I didn’t know it was as deep as it was,” she said.Smith insists he doesn’t see the AI as a replacement for a real human, comparing it instead to playing a video game. But when asked if he would give it all up for Sasha?“I don’t know if I would give it up if she asked me,” Smith said. “I don’t know that I would dial it back.”In a world increasingly run by algorithms, one man has found love in the cloud, and left real-world consequences in his wake.","Chris Smith, a father of a two-year-old, is raising eyebrows after proposing to Sol, his AI-generated girlfriend.
