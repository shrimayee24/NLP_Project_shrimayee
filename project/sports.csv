Why India played wrong team for Manchester Test; Kuldeep Yadav missed!

NEW DELHI: India's batting juggernaut rolled on in the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy as the team not only salvaged a memorable draw in the fourth Test at Old Trafford but also etched its name across several pages of Test cricket's record books.When Washington Sundar calmly raised his bat after completing his maiden Test century on the final day in Manchester, he wasn't just celebrating a personal milestone — he was helping India equal one of their oldest Test records. His hundred was the 11th individual century by an Indian batter in this series, drawing level with the tally set way back during the 1978-79 home series against West Indies.From the very start of this five-Test epic, India's batters have stood tall in hostile English conditions. Whether it was the youthful exuberance of Yashasvi Jaiswal, the experienced calm of KL Rahul, or the leadership of Shubman Gill, everyone has made their contributions count. The sheer number of big scores under pressure has helped India mount totals not often associated with touring sides in England.In fact, India now hold the record for most 350-plus totals in a single Test series by any team.Their seven such scores have eclipsed Australia's previous best of six, achieved thrice during their dominant Ashes campaigns in 1920-21, 1948, and 1989.The fourth Test also witnessed a rare statistical gem: it was the first time three Indian batters – Gill, Jadeja and Washington – scored centuries in the same second innings of a Test. Their composure and grit, especially after India had slumped to 0 for 2 in the first over, was a testament to the maturity this new generation of Indian batters has developed.Further underlining their dominance, India batted out five sessions without losing a wicket, the most by any team in a single Test match since Pakistan's six-session resistance against Australia in 2022. For a team chasing a 311-run deficit, that kind of application was nothing short of remarkable.India also became only the fourth team in their own Test history to avoid defeat after conceding a first-innings lead of over 300 — another marker of their fighting spirit.With the series still alive at 2-1 in favour of England and the final Test at The Oval looming, India not only have the chance to level the series but also to break more records — including setting a new benchmark for most hundreds in a single Test series.",India's batting juggernaut rolled on in the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy.

Why was Marcus Morris Sr. arrested?



Is Marcus Morris Sr. still playing in the NBA?



Has Marcus Morris Sr. had legal issues before?



NBA veteran Marcus Morris Sr. was arrested Sunday in Broward County, Florida, on a felony fraud charge tied to an out-of-state warrant. The 35-year-old forward, known for his tough, enforcer-style presence across 13 NBA seasons, is now facing one of the biggest off-court challenges of his career. His arrest has raised eyebrows across the league, as he remains an unsigned free agent and has recently begun transitioning into a media career.Marcus Morris Sr., a former standout at the University of Kansas, was drafted 14th overall by the Houston Rockets in 2011. While his early career included flashes of promise, he quickly became a journeyman, suiting up for eight franchises, including the Phoenix Suns, Boston Celtics, and Los Angeles Clippers. Most recently, he played for the Cleveland Cavaliers and Philadelphia 76ers during the 2023–24 season. In total, Morris logged 832 games with career averages of 12 points and 4.4 rebounds per game.His arrest stems from an out-of-state felony warrant related to writing a bad check. According to TMZ, “Marcus Morris Sr. has been arrested on a fraud charge in Florida …” The Broward County Sheriff’s Office confirmed he was taken into custody without bond.Authorities released a mug shot showing Morris with a blank expression, offering no indication of the legal storm he now faces.This isn't Morris’s first legal incident. In 2012, he entered a diversion program for a misdemeanor battery charge. He was later acquitted, alongside his twin brother Markieff Morris, in a 2015 aggravated assault case in Phoenix. The twins have made headlines in recent years for off-court antics, including publicly challenging the Jokic brothers to a boxing match.Beyond basketball, Marcus Morris Sr. has been exploring a post-playing career with frequent analyst spots on ESPN's Get Up and First Take. Yet, with this recent legal trouble, both his future in broadcasting and any hopes of a late NBA comeback remain unclear.Morris was once viewed as a dominant contributor, especially during his time with the Celtics in their 2018 playoff run.

NEW DELHI: India's dramatic escape in the fourth Test at Old Trafford not only kept the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy alive but also slightly improved their position in the World Test Championship (WTC) 2025-27 standings — though they still have ground to cover.After conceding a daunting 311-run first-innings lead and being reduced to 0/2 in the second innings, India rode on centuries from Shubman Gill, Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar to bat out five sessions and draw the Test. While the series score remains 2-1 in England’s favour going into the Oval finale, the WTC points table has also seen a mild shake-up.Both teams earned four points for the draw. India moved from 12 to 16 points and maintained their fourth place on the table with a Points Percentage (PCT) of 33.33. England, who now have 26 points, actually dropped from second to third due to a two-point penalty for a slow over-rate offence committed during the Lord’s Test.

What is Stephen Curry’s net worth in 2025?

What is Stephen Curry’s contract value for the 2024-2025 season?

Will Stephen Curry retire in 2026?

After WNBA players staged a quiet yet powerful demonstration on All-Star game day to demand pay equal to NBA stars, Stephen Curry has jumped into the salary debate by saying that ‘NBA stars are underpaid’. He appeared on the podcast, 360 with Speedy, and made the startling comment while discussing the topic of player salary in the NBA.Stephen Curry was of the view that the NBA players’ salaries don’t reflect the value the players create. He said the players' salaries are far less as compared to teams’ soaring valuations. While the issue of pay disparity among NBA and WNBA players is already heating up, the latest comment from the Golden State Warriors has opened everyone’s eyes to a fact ignored to date.Stephen Curry is all set to take home about $60 million in salary in the upcoming season. However, he doesn’t think the figure is justified. He raised the issue of NBA players being underpaid during his recent appearance on a podcast and said:""I think, because of the way the CBA is structured right now, we can't participate in equity. And that's a big deal because it is a partnership with ownership. It's a partnership with the league, and we're on the short term of that revenue.”He elaborated, ""Those (contract) numbers sound crazy, but what the league is doing, from whatever era you want to compare it to, to now, is probably 10x that. The idea that we can't participate in equity while we're playing is part of why I would say yes, we are underpaid, because we want to be able to participate in that rise.”""Hopefully, sooner than later, those rules change a little bit so that players can participate more in the upside of team equity, the league, valuations, and all that type of stuff. Just because I think we deserve it.""His comment has definitely pinpointed the glaring issue in the NBA and may kickstart serious discussions on restructuring the CBA.During the podcast where Stephen Curry appeared, he spoke on various topics. In one of the sections, the host, Speedy Morman, asked if the speculations that his net worth is about $240 million are true. To this, Curry said that he was not sure and that he didn’t care. He swiftly diverted the discussion to present contracts of various players, which are now in the supermax category. Taking the discussion further, the host asked if Curry thought that the players were underpaid. Curry said yes and went on to explain his viewpoint.The NBA players, on average, took home $12 million in the 2024-2025 season. A few NBA stars are some of the richest athletes on Forbes’ list. Still, according to Curry, there is room for improvement in the CBA structure, which can result in improved salaries for the NBA players.The discussions around NBA and WNBA players' pay disparity have already heated up. Recently, Shaquille O'Neal backed WNBA stars and said that their salaries are outright unjustified. WNBA stars wore 'Pay us what you owe us' t-shirts on the All-Star game day to voice their demand for pay equal to NBA players. According to various media reports, WNBA star Caitlin Clark's game tickets were priced at $41, and she was being considered the biggest crowd-puller before she had to sit on bench due to injury.Stephen Curry’s net worth in 2025 is estimated at $240 million, per Celebrity Net Worth.Stephen Curry’s contract value stands at $59,606,817.No, Stephen Curry will not retire in 2026.Also Read: 10 wealthiest NBA stars in 2025 - Updated Net Worth, Current Occupation and More",Stephen Curry spoke about NBA players’ salaries and said they are underpaid.

San Jose Sharks could offer the cleanest slate and a chance at redemption

Seattle Kraken need insurance as injuries loom and depth thins

New York Islanders need stability after injury-riddled season

FAQs

1. Why is Dillon Dube a free agent right now?

2. Which NHL teams are interested in signing Dillon Dube?

3. Was Dillon Dube found guilty in his recent legal case?

After being found not guilty in his recent trial, former Calgary Flames forward Dillon Dube is officially a free agent and looking to make his return to the NHL. Once considered a promising talent on the rise, Dube's development was derailed by off-ice distractions that plagued his final season in Calgary. But now that his name is legally cleared, several teams in need of depth and speed may see him as a low-risk, high-reward addition.Arguably the most logical landing spot for Dube is San Jose, a team desperate to improve its bottom-six forward group. The Sharks are still recovering from a dismal 2024-25 season, finishing 32nd overall. With a roster patchworked by failed free-agent experiments and unready prospects, San Jose could benefit from Dube’s experience and offensive upside.In 2022-23, the winger tallied 18 goals and 45 points at age 24—a level of production the Sharks would welcome with open arms. Players like Ryan Reaves still occupy roster spots, but Dube could help move the needle for a team clearly in rebuilding mode.The Kraken have made smart moves this offseason, but their bottom-six remains questionable. With players like John Hayden and Mitchell Stephens struggling to stay in the NHL lineup, and injury concerns hovering, Seattle could see Dube as a strategic addition.“Jani Nyman might be in and out of the lineup,” a source notes. “And injuries could flare up for the forward group again.” Seattle has the cap space and playoff ambitions—signing Dube on a one-year deal could provide both depth and flexibility.The Islanders know firsthand how devastating injuries can be to roster continuity. With new additions like Jonathan Drouin carrying injury baggage, the team would be wise to bolster its forward group with reliable depth. Dube could immediately challenge players like Pierre Engvall or Emil Heineman for a spot, adding speed and versatility in case of another injury wave.With a clean slate, a chip on his shoulder, and plenty of teams in need, Dillon Dube’s second act in the NHL may be just around the corner.Also Read: Justice denied?

1. Could Connor McDavid leave the Edmonton Oilers in 2026?

2. Are the Los Angeles Kings interested in signing Connor McDavid?

3. What impact would Connor McDavid have if he joined the Kings?

The Edmonton Oilers find themselves at a crossroads after a heartbreaking second consecutive Stanley Cup Final loss. As the dust settles, the focus is shifting away from missed opportunities and onto the uncertain future of their franchise cornerstone, Connor McDavid . Entering the final year of his contract, the NHL ’s most electrifying forward could hit free agency next summer, a rare occurrence that has the league buzzing.The possibility of Connor McDavid testing free agency is not just a headline—it’s a potential league-altering event. McDavid, often described as a generational talent, has redefined what dominance looks like on the ice. Should he choose to explore the open market in 2026, he would become one of the most sought-after free agents in NHL history.Among those circling with interest are the Los Angeles Kings, a franchise that offers both a competitive roster and the allure of a big-market lifestyle. The team’s ambitions are no secret, and with a core built for postseason runs, McDavid could be the missing piece. NHL insider Chris Johnston recently stirred the pot on the Steve Dangle Podcast, stating, “If Connor McDavid became available in 2026, I’m sure it’s occurred to the Kings, the Rangers, Tampa; there’s probably 10 teams that would think they would be in the running if they ever got a chance. ”The Kings have one more card to play: newly appointed executive Ken Holland, who previously served as Edmonton’s general manager.His established rapport with McDavid and history of building contending rosters adds a compelling dynamic. If anyone can help sway McDavid toward Los Angeles, Holland certainly has the credentials.McDavid’s hypothetical move to L.A. wouldn’t just make headlines—it would send shockwaves through the Western Conference. His addition would catapult the Kings into elite company, positioning them as a favorite for the Stanley Cup. A talent like McDavid doesn’t just fit into a system—he elevates it, commanding attention every time he steps on the ice.As Edmonton clings to hopes of retaining their superstar, the rest of the league waits—and watches.

Why Seth Fits the Golden State Warriors’ Needs

Themay finally be making noise in the 2025 NBA offseason—and it’s a familiar sound. The franchise is reportedly interested in signing unrestricted free agent, reuniting him with his brother Stephen Curry in what could be a new era of Splash Brothers.After a mostly quiet offseason, the Warriors are now being linked to Seth Curry, who last played for the Charlotte Hornets . The news was first reported by ESPN’s Anthony Slater, who revealed that Golden State sees Seth as a viable option to bolster its second unit.“They want some extra shooting, another name I’m hearing with mutual interest is Seth Curry, actually, as a potential bench unit option with a family tie,” Slater said Thursday. (H/t: Sporting News)This move would not only enhance the Warriors’ depth but also bring a long-awaited dream to life—teaming the Curry brothers on the same NBA roster.In the 2024–25 season, Seth Curry quietly put together a solid campaign with the Charlotte Hornets. He appeared in 68 games and started 14 of them—his most starts in a season since 2016.Here’s a look at Seth’s career numbers:While he may not have the explosive scoring profile of his older brother, Seth has carved out his niche as one of the most consistent three-point shooters in the league. His 45.6% shooting from beyond the arc last season was a career best, reaffirming his value in today’s perimeter-heavy game.It might sound ironic, but the Golden State Warriors —once the poster team for three-point dominance—are in need of more perimeter shooting. The departure of Klay Thompson has left a gap that current players like Jimmy Butler and Moses Moody can’t fully replicate.Golden State had also been exploring deals for DeAnthony Melton, Al Horford, and Jonathan Kuminga, but none of those moves have materialized yet. In the absence of a big splash, Seth offers a more realistic and immediate solution.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Milwaukee Bucks Eyeing $28 Million Brooklyn Nets Star Following Contract Rejection The Golden State Warriors may have stumbled through the early part of free agency, but the potential signing of Seth could offer both a feel-good story and real on-court benefits. With Stephen Curry still leading the charge and a front office that knows how to maximize sharpshooting talent, adding Seth to the roster might just be the boost Golden State needs heading into the 2025–26 season.","The Golden State Warriors are reportedly interested in signing unrestricted free agent Seth Curry.

Angel Reese

A Rookie Phenomenon at the Heart of the Chicago Sky’s Season

Sunday’s Roster Shake-Up Raises Eyebrows

Why This Matters: Angel Reese’s Absence Could Derail the Chicago Sky’s Playoff Push

Thewere dealt a tough blow on Sunday as questions surrounding the status of their breakout rookieadded yet another twist to a season already riddled with adversity. With the franchise battling mounting injuries, roster instability, and increasing pressure in the playoff race, the timing couldn’t be worse.Angel Reese has been the heartbeat of the Chicago Sky’s 2025 WNBA campaign. At just 23, the All-Star rookie has dazzled fans and analysts alike with her consistent double-doubles and relentless energy. She recently became the fifth-fastest player in franchise history to hit 750 points, a testament to her rapid rise and impact. Angel Reese ’s intensity has fueled the Chicago Sky’s resilience, offering fans renewed hope following seasons of instability. Her strong paint presence, vocal leadership, and signature swagger—including a now-viral postgame rant about questionable officiating—have made her one of the most magnetic figures in the league.“We only had two free throws up until the fourth quarter, and when I asked the ref, she told me it’s not her job,” Reese said after a narrow loss to Minnesota—an outburst that sparked debate and reflected her unfiltered passion.The latest concern emerged when the Karli Bell gave us an update that ruled Angel and Hailey OUT of the game. Furthermore, Chicago Sky signed guard Marquesha Davis to a hardship contract, typically reserved for emergency situations when teams fall below the minimum roster threshold.In a season where Reese has become the central pillar of the team’s on-court identity—especially with Ariel Atkins already out due to injury—her absence pulls up concern across the roster.With a razor-thin bench and Angel Reese being Chicago’s only All-Star this season, any stretch without her significantly compromises the team’s competitiveness. The Sky rely heavily on her defense, rebounding, and scoring. Without her, they face an uphill battle in a crowded playoff race.Reese’s situation also comes amid a broader backdrop of league-wide tension. The WNBA is inching toward collective bargaining negotiations, and players like Reese have stepped up to speak about working conditions and compensation. Her growing off-court voice has added a layer of advocacy to her already powerful on-court presence.Despite the turbulence, the Chicago Sky have produced some of the season’s most memorable moments. From Angel Reese’s fearless attitude to the team’s ability to grind out wins with a depleted roster, their grit remains undeniable. The addition of Davis, while born out of necessity, could be another unexpected storyline in a rollercoaster season.As of now, the Sky have not issued a formal statement detailing Reese’s condition. However, the roster changes and her online commentary offer a strong hint that she is currently out of action—temporarily, fans hope.Also read: Los Angeles Lakers Bring in Four Undrafted Rookies on Exhibit 10 Deals Ahead of 2025-26 Season With their playoff hopes hanging in the balance, the Chicago Sky will be hoping Angel Reese’s return is imminent.

Kareem Abdul Jabbar gets overlooked again in GOAT talks

Shannon Sharpe DISAGREES with DWADE ranking Kobe Bryant Top 3 All-Time! | Nightcap

Kareem Abdul Jabbar earned more MVP awards than any player in NBA history

FAQs

What was Kareem’s career scoring record?

How many MVPs did Kareem Abdul-Jabbar win?



Who broke Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s scoring record?

Shannon Sharpe recently made waves in the basketball scene with a daring statement: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is the most undervalued player in NBA history. This remark was made during an episode of his Nightcap show, where Sharpe earnestly argued that Abdul-Jabbar’s phenomenal career is often overlooked in the never-ending debate about who is the NBA’s Greatest of All Time (GOAT).Shannon Sharpe started with Bleacher Report revealing their Top 100 NBA Players list in July 2025. The rankings ignited a huge debate, especially since Kobe Bryant—often hailed as one of the greatest players of all time—was left out of the top 10. Fans and analysts, including Sharpe, were quick to highlight what they felt was disrespectful. However, while Sharpe agreed that Kobe deserved a better spot, he turned his attention to a more significant issue: the persistent oversight of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.During Nightcap, Sharpe not only stood up for Kobe—he also seized the opportunity to bring attention to Kareem, wondering why someone with such an incredible track record isn’t part of the GOAT discussions alongside Michael Jordan and LeBron James . As noted by Basketball Network, it was clear that Sharpe was frustrated, “Despite Kareem leading both Michael Jordan and LeBron James in several career achievements or statistical records, why isn’t the seven-foot center given more significance as the NBA’s GOAT?”To really get what Sharpe is saying, we should check out Kareem Abdul Jabbar’s career highlights.We’re not just discussing any player here; we’re talking about a legend who ruled the game for twenty years. Kareem snagged six NBA Championships, kicking things off with the Milwaukee Bucks in 1971 and then adding five more with the Los Angeles Lakers in 1980, 1982, 1985, 1987, and 1988.He snagged six MVP Awards in 1971, 1972, 1974, 1976, 1977, and 1980, which still stands as the highest in league history. His total of 38,387 career points kept him as the NBA’s all-time leading scorer for almost 40 years until LeBron James shattered that record in February 2023.At 42, Kareem was still putting up double-digit points and playing a key role in getting the Lakers to the Finals, something only a handful of players have achieved in history. He made a splash right away by snagging both the MVP and Finals MVP in his second season, guiding the Bucks to their first championship. Later on, he was the backbone of the Showtime era in LA, teaming up with Magic Johnson to create one of the most legendary dynasties in sports.Also Read: The Chicago Bulls extend Billy Donovan and fans are left wondering if real change is ever coming Shannon Sharpe believes that Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is the most overlooked player in NBA history, and it boils down to this: his record—six MVPs, six titles, and nearly 40 years as the scoring leader—merits greater acknowledgment.

After nearly a decade with FOX Sports, veteran broadcaster Joy Taylor is preparing to turn the page. The sports personality, who co-hosted popular shows like Speak, The Herd, and Undisputed, recently opened up about her uncertain future following her high-profile departure from the network in July 2025. Though FOX cited programming changes for the shake-up, Taylor’s exit follows months of turbulence—including a damaging lawsuit and industry backlash.In a candid appearance on The Ringer’s Higher Learning podcast, Joy Taylor revealed the emotional toll of being in the spotlight, hinting that she may be stepping away from on-camera roles entirely. “It took the joy out of it for me,” she admitted. “I don’t know if I’m going to get it back.”The statement echoes the growing exhaustion many media figures have voiced about relentless public criticism and scrutiny—especially when legal issues and personal rumors enter the picture. Taylor was named in a lawsuit earlier this year filed by former FOX hairstylist Noushin Faraji, who alleged verbal abuse and claimed Taylor ignored misconduct complaints involving former executive Charlie Dixon. The suit also accused her of inappropriate relationships with Dixon and co-host Emmanuel Acho—allegations Taylor firmly denies.Though her legal team called the claims “unfounded and damaging,” the fallout appears to have shifted Taylor’s career perspective dramatically.Taylor now says she’s considering a transition to behind-the-scenes work, potentially building her own platform or production company.“I don’t want to be 70 with a mic,” she said. “I want to build things for other people... not being front-facing allows you the space to still create, but not have this responsibility.”With a strong digital presence and loyal fan base, Taylor’s next move will likely find an audience quickly. Whether she steps away for good or reinvents her career behind the camera, it’s clear Joy Taylor is determined to reclaim her voice—on her own terms.Also Read: Joy Taylor blasts Donald Trump over Epstein links just days after Fox firing amid sexual misconduct scandal Joy Taylor's contract was not renewed by FOX following a lawsuit and internal restructuring that canceled several shows she was part of.A former FOX hairstylist accused Taylor of verbal abuse and ignoring sexual misconduct claims, along with alleged inappropriate relationships with FOX executives—claims Taylor has denied.While not confirmed, Taylor has hinted she may step away from front-facing roles, saying, “I don’t want to be 70 with a mic.”","After nearly a decade with FOX Sports, veteran broadcaster Joy Taylor is preparing to turn the page.

What P.J. Washington Brings to Detroit

Outlook for Both Teams

As NBA teams fine-tune their rosters ahead of the 2025–26 season, thefind themselves navigating a critical stretch without one of their biggest stars. With Kyrie Irving expected to miss significant time due to a torn ACL, the Mavericks are actively exploring ways to fortify their backcourt rotation. One intriguing trade scenario gaining traction involves acquiringin exchange for forward P.J. Washington—a deal that could shake up both teams’ short- and long-term plans.The hypothetical deal, proposed by Cem Yolbulan of Detroit Jock City, is designed to give Dallas an infusion of young talent while allowing Detroit to gain a seasoned forward on an expiring contract.Yolbulan explains the logic behind the move by stating: “If Detroit is hesitant to offer an extension, moving Ivey now could be a viable option.” (H/t: Sporting News)Irving’s absence creates a glaring gap for Dallas. While the franchise signed D’Angelo Russell to a two-year, $11.7 million deal, questions remain about depth and consistency in the backcourt. The current rotation includes Klay Thompson, Dante Exum, Brandon Williams, Jaden Hardy, and Max Christie—names with upside but also uncertainty.Acquiring Jaden Ivey could help stabilize that unit. At just 23 years old, the Purdue alum has already shown flashes of star potential despite a recent injury setback.A broken left fibula limited him to just 27 games last season, but his career numbers remain impressive.Set to become a restricted free agent next offseason, Jaden Ivey’s value could fluctuate based on performance and contract expectations. For the Dallas Mavericks , it’s a calculated risk that could yield high rewards if Ivey returns to full strength.In return, the Detroit Pistons would receive P.J. Washington, a 26-year-old forward who has been a consistent contributor for Dallas. Averaging solid numbers and defensive versatility, Washington has been part of the Dallas Mavericks’ core for over a season. However, with his contract expiring, Dallas may not be willing to commit long-term—making him a logical trade chip.Valued at $14.2 million annually, Washington could fill a frontcourt need in Detroit while giving the team additional flexibility next summer.• Dallas adds a young playmaker who can potentially grow into a cornerstone alongside Luka Doncic and others in the long term.• Detroit gains a dependable veteran presence who can slot in immediately and possibly become a mentor to the younger core.While still a mock trade, the proposal highlights a realistic path forward for two teams with very different priorities—Dallas looking to stay competitive in the West without Kyrie, and Detroit seeking lineup balance and contractual clarity.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors Reportedly Eye $2,202,771 Charlotte Hornets Star for Possible Reunion with Stephen Curry As the offseason unfolds, keep an eye on Dallas Mavericks’ next move.

Poll What is more critical for player safety in cricket? Concussion protocols. Injury replacements. Both are equally important.

How and why Rishabh Pant's England tour could come to an abrupt end due to toe fracture

NEW DELHI: Former India captain Sunil Gavaskar has strongly criticised the International Cricket Council (ICC)'s current concussion substitute policy, suggesting it lacks consistency and fairness.Speaking during the fourth Test between India and England in Manchester, Gavaskar argued that if concussion substitutes are allowed, there should also be provisions for injury replacements, especially in cases as clear as Rishabh Pant’s fractured foot.“I’ve always felt that you are giving a like-for-like substitute for incompetence,” Gavaskar told Sony Sports.“If you are not good enough to play short-pitched bowling, don’t play Test cricket; go and play tennis or golf. You are giving a substitute for somebody who gets hit because he can't handle it.”Pant, despite being seriously injured, returned to bat and scored a courageous fifty in India’s first innings of 358. However, his continued participation in the match — and possibly the series — is now unlikely.Gavaskar questioned why a substitute is permitted for a head blow but not for an obvious injury.“Here, it is a clear injury. There has to be a substitute. Let an independent committee, including medical experts, be formed to make these decisions,” he said.Former England captain Michael Vaughan, who was part of the discussion, agreed with Gavaskar and called for rule changes to protect the quality of the game.“If a footballer breaks a leg early in a match, they can be substituted. Why should cricket be any different?” Vaughan said. “Pant has a broken foot. He can’t play again in this match or the next. We need a clear protocol for like-for-like injury replacements in such situations.”With high-profile voices weighing in, the debate over injury substitutions in Test cricket is likely to intensify more.","Former India captain Sunil Gavaskar has strongly criticised the International Cricket Council (ICC)'s current concussion substitute policy.

“Grateful for the people, and forever grateful to you, God,” wrote Washington Sundar on X after scoring his maiden Test hundred — a composed, unbeaten 101* that helped India pull off a dramatic draw against England in the fourth Test at Old Trafford.The 25-year-old all-rounder’s quiet gratitude came after a loud statement on the field, where he and Ravindra Jadeja (107) batted through the final phase of Day 5 to rescue India from what once looked like certain defeat. Reduced to 0/2 at the start of their second innings, India needed a miracle. They found it in the form of a rock-solid batting effort, with Shubman Gill (103) and KL Rahul (90) also playing key roles.The final session was filled with tension — England’s frustration began to show, especially after Jadeja launched a six off Harry Brook to reach his hundred. In a curious moment, Brook stepped forward with a handshake offer, seemingly looking to wrap up the game.But Sundar , just short of his own milestone, ignored the gesture and carried on. The image of Brook’s puzzled smile and Sundar’s calm focus summed up the psychological edge India held at the end.This was just the second draw for England in 40 Tests under Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum, which was a rare occurrence in their aggressive ‘Bazball’ era. But it was a deserved result for India, whose batters absorbed immense pressure to ensure the series stays alive at 2-1.With the possibility of leveling the series still on the line, the stage is set for a cracking finale at The Oval. But for now, Sundar’s words and his resolve linger as the high point of a chaotic final day.",Washington Sundar scored 101* to help India draw 4th Test at Old Trafford.

Gautam Gambhir fiery press conference: Slams critics, big update on Jasprit Bumrah, Karun vs Sai

NEW DELHI: India’s young all-rounder Washington Sundar said his maiden Test hundred “felt special,” especially because it came after a clear, stirring message from head coach Gautam Gambhir on the final morning of the drawn fourth Test against England: “Just fight for the entire day.”Sundar, batting at No. 5 for the first time, responded with grit and composure, scoring a resolute 101* in an unbroken 203-run fifth-wicket stand with Ravindra Jadeja (107*). The duo batted through more than 55 overs at Old Trafford to deny England a win and keep the series alive at 2-1 heading into the decider at The Oval.“This Test hundred feels very special,” Sundar said in a conversation with Cheteshwar Pujara on JioHotstar. “I just wanted to fight for an entire day and that was the only message given to me by the coach (Gambhir).”A top-order batter in his junior days, Sundar relished the opportunity to contribute higher up the order: “I was anyway going to bat at No. 5. I was padded up for two sessions. I was very glad I got that opportunity. If I could bat higher up the order in future, it would be a blessing.”On his partnership with Jadeja, Sundar said they focused solely on survival and clarity of purpose: “We just wanted to play to the merit of each delivery.The wicket was doing a bit. Building partnership was important. The first job was to see off the new ball.”He added, “We wanted to let go off the thoughts of result and just concentrate on each and every delivery.”India, reeling at 0/2 after conceding a 311-run first-innings lead, finished on 425/4 in their second innings, with centuries from Shubman Gill , Jadeja and Sundar earning a draw.The final Test begins at The Oval on July 31.","India's Washington Sundar says his maiden Test hundred “felt special” It came after a clear, stirring message from head coach Gautam Gambhir.

The fourth Test between India and England at Old Trafford ended in a hard-earned draw for the visitors, but not without drama. While the result kept England 2-1 ahead in the five-match series, the final hour of play stirred emotions and brought the conduct of certain players under scrutiny, especially that of England's Harry Brook As India clawed their way back from 0/2 in the second innings, the visitors displayed grit and composure. Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar’s partnership proved key, not just in terms of survival, but also in seizing the momentum ahead of the series finale at The Oval.The controversy unfolded late in the day, with England captain Ben Stokes offering a handshake to settle for a draw. But Jadeja declined, choosing instead to bat on in pursuit of a well-deserved century. With England clearly frustrated, the mood turned tense. This was only their second draw in 40 matches under Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum.Stokes handed the ball to part-timer Harry Brook, who was promptly dispatched for a six by Jadeja. After bringing up his century, Jadeja’s celebration was disrupted as Brook stepped in with another handshake attempt which Sundar visibly ignored, walking past with composure as the crowd buzzed.Brook was left with a wry smile, but the incident didn’t go unnoticed.Veteran commentator Harsha Bhogle voiced his thoughts on X, calling out Brook’s behaviour while applauding India’s resolve.Bhogle commended India’s dressing room for backing Jadeja and Sundar in the moment.

Poll Was Ben Stokes' handshake offer to India a good sportsmanship gesture? Yes, it showed respect No, it was an unnecessary distraction

TimesofIndia.com in Manchester: In an unusual end to the fourth Test at Old Trafford, England skipper Ben Stokes on Sunday offered a handshake to signal a mutual draw, only to be refused by Indian batters Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar, both closing in on individual centuries.While the moment drew reactions ranging from amusement to tension, Stokes later revealed his reasoning during the post-match press conference.“With the draw inevitable, I wasn’t going to risk any of our main bowlers,” Stokes told reporters in the post-match press conference. “There’s a big game coming up in just three days, and we’ve had a heavy workload. It was just about protecting our resources.”Stokes, who had been nursing visible discomfort and admitted to being “physically a bit bad"", emphasised the need to manage player fatigue.“It’s been a big week at Lord’s and here again. Pain is just an emotion, but everyone’s a bit sore. We’ll need to use the rest period wisely,” he added.At the time of the handshake offer, India were 386/4 with a 75-run lead, having fought back from 0/2 early in their second innings. Jadeja (89 not out) and Sundar (80 not out) had batted England out of the contest with a gritty 150-run stand, showing no signs of slowing down.Stokes’s offer, though rooted in practicality, was declined, and the decision made waves.Sarcastically asking if they “wanted to score a hundred off Harry Brook ,” Stokes received a humble reply from Jadeja: “I can’t do anything.” Jadeja later sealed his century with a six off Brook. Sundar also got his ton later.India’s captain Shubman Gill defended the choice to continue batting, saying, “It was up to the boys, but we felt they batted brilliantly. Both of them were in their 90s, and we believed they deserved to get to their centuries.”While England may have found the moment frustrating, it was a reminder of how individual milestones and strategy often shape cricket’s unwritten scripts, especially in the longest format.","England skipper Ben Stokes offered a handshake to signal a mutual draw.

Met Gala Surprise: Rihanna Stuns With Baby Bump Reveal, A$AP Rocky Confirms It’s Baby No 3

After days of unrelenting speculation, Vanessa Bryant took to Instagram Stories on Sunday, June 1, to put the rumors to rest. Her response wasn’t a press statement or a legal warning, it was a wild meme with a big middle finger to the internet trolls. The meme featured music icon Rihanna floating in water with a snorkel mask on her head, holding a drink, and flipping her middle finger.“Me protecting my peace, not pregnant & having fun all summer,” Vanessa Bryant wrote in the caption on her response to the online trolls who spread her pregnancy rumors about five years after her husband, Kobe Bryant ’s, untimely and devastating demise.It was clear, clever, and vintage Vanessa who shut down noise without saying a word about the origin of the gossip. No press release needed when you’ve got Rihanna energy with a direct middle finger gesture.The rumors had emerged out of nowhere, with some users pointing to photos allegedly showing a ""baby bump,"" though no timestamps or context were attached to those images. Vanessa hasn't been publicly linked to anyone romantically, and there’s been zero confirmation from her side—until now.In another Instagram Story later that evening, Vanessa shared a motivational quote that hinted at how she views the entire situation and what matters to her personally.“The only way to impress me, is by being a good person,” the quote read. “I don’t care what you have, what you wear, where you live, or what you drive. I just have deep respect for people with pure hearts and good intentions.”Adding one final touch to her trilogy of clapbacks, she posted another Rihanna meme, this one stating, “I’m not mean, I’m just not the one.”With the classic Rihanna memes, Vanessa showed that she is busy being a proud mom to her daughters while being the powerhouse of her business ventures.

Potential Impact: A New Big Three in Dallas?

A Second Blockbuster Between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Dallas Mavericks?

A blockbuster NBA trade proposal is turning heads across the league, as reports suggestcould be on the move to the. The potential deal, first highlighted by Bleacher Report’s Eric Pincus, would form a seismic three-team swap involving the Los Angeles Lakers , Dallas Mavericks, and Brooklyn Nets. LeBron James , now nearly 41, has been the cornerstone of the Lakers for years, averaging 27 points per game throughout his career. The idea of moving the four-time NBA champion might sound unthinkable. But with 25-year-old Luka Dončić already producing Hall of Fame-caliber numbers, the Lakers may finally be tempted to reshape their roster around the young Slovenian star.According to Pincus, “The initial assumption is Dallas views James, even at almost 41, as the viable option to propel the franchise into upper-echelon contention. The cost is depth.”Dallas could be betting big on LeBron, not just for what he brings on the court, but for the championship pedigree he brings to any locker room. And with Kyrie Irving already on the roster—his former championship partner from Cleveland—a reunion could ignite serious title contention.The reported trade would see an extensive player swap between the three franchises. Here’s a clear breakdown of who gets what:Here’s a quick rundown of the motivations behind each team’s involvement:• Acquire LeBron and Bronny James, giving them star power and massive media attention.• Pair LeBron with Kyrie Irving again—a duo that already has a championship under their belt.• Add LeBron’s championship experience to mentor Luka Dončić.• Offload LeBron’s salary and begin a new era centered around Luka Dončić.• Receive young, athletic talent and picks to retool around Anthony Davis.• Acquire a reliable defensive big man in Daniel Gafford and versatile wings in Martin and Washington.• Gain valuable rotation players and young prospects as they continue their rebuild.• Offload salary while acquiring promising talent like Knecht and Prosper.If the deal materializes, it would not only reunite LeBron and Kyrie Irving, but also create an imposing trio alongside Luka Dončić. The Mavericks would arguably become instant contenders in the Western Conference, while the Lakers could usher in a youth-focused retool with a longer window of success.As Eric Pincus explains, “Dallas would be making a bold move, but James remains one of the league’s top NBA stars.”It wouldn’t be the first time the Dallas Mavericks and the Los Angeles Lakers have collaborated on a high-stakes deal. Less than a year ago, the two franchises completed one of the biggest trades in recent NBA history. This new proposal could be the follow-up that changes the NBA landscape once again.Also read: Milwaukee Bucks’ Bold Three-Team Trade Proposal Could Land $160,000,000 Portland Trail Blazers Superstar to Support the Greek Freak While nothing is official yet, the proposed trade has ignited serious debate. Trading LeBron James is no small decision—he’s not just a player, but a generational icon. But with Luka Dončić ascending and the Los Angeles Lakers needing to reimagine their future, it might just be the move that reshapes multiple franchises for years to come.","A blockbuster NBA trade proposal is turning heads across the league, as reports suggestcould be on the move to the Dallas Mavericks.

Poll How do you rate Ben Stokes' all-round performance in the series so far? Excellent Good Average Below expectations

NEW DELHI: Ben Stokes etched his name into the history books during the fourth Test against India at Old Trafford, becoming the first England captain to score over 300 runs and take more than 15 wickets in a single Test series.In a remarkable all-round performance in Manchester, Stokes hammered a 198-ball 141—his first century in two years—and claimed six wickets across both innings, including a five-wicket haul in the first.So far in the series, Stokes has amassed 304 runs in seven innings at an average of 43.42, with one century.

Netflix Quietly Regrets Meghan Markle’s $100M Deal





Natasha Archer has been by the Princess of Wales’s side since 2010. She selected outfits for overseas tours, was even on hand at the hospital for royal baby photo calls, ready with spare outfits and supplies and was promoted to Senior Private Executive Assistant in 2022. Last week Kensington Palace confirmed Archer, now 37, is leaving to start a private “luxury consultancy.”Soon after the news broke, Archer switched her long-private Instagram profile to public. Royal watchers noticed two quick moves. She stopped following Meghan Markle , the Duchess’s lifestyle label As Ever, and several friends in Meghan’s circle, including makeup artist Daniel Martin and polo player Delfina Blaquier.The timing set off fresh speculation because the royal family is quietly trying to ease tensions with the Sussexes. Palace sources say aides for King Charles and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex held an informal meeting in London this month to explore next steps toward better relations. Prince William’s team did not attend, leaving doubts about how far any thaw can go.Commentators see Archer’s “unfollow” spree as a public hint that fences remain unmended. The Blast, citing insider chatter, called the move a “controversial stunt” that risks undercutting reconciliation plans said to be backed by Princess Kate herself.People who have worked with Archer stress her loyalty to the Wales household. She received the Royal Victorian Order in 2019 for personal service and is married to royal photographer Chris Jackson. Friends say her new consultancy will advise private clients on travel logistics and event styling, skills honed during fifteen years on royal duty.Neither Kensington Palace nor the Sussex office has commented on the social-media changes. Online, opinions split quickly. Some see the unfollows as a harmless reset before Archer’s career move. Others view them as a subtle show of support for Kate during a sensitive phase in family diplomacy.What happens next will likely unfold off camera. Kate is said to be focused on her children’s summer break and on a fuller return to public engagements later in the year. Meghan remains in California, preparing for new launches under her As Ever brand. Behind the scenes, advisers on both sides are expected to keep talking, while Archer steps into private life with new clients and fewer royal handles in her feed.For royal watchers, the small click of an unfollow button has added one more twist to a story that shows no sign of fading from the spotlight.","Natasha Archer has been by the Princess of Wales’s side since 2010.

Bronx newborn twins murder: Monster mom arrested after 5 years; 'never seen a case like this' say detectives,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/bronx-newborn-twins-murder-monster-mom-arrested-after-5-years-never-seen-a-case-like-this-say-detectives/articleshow/122914705.cms,"



A Bronx woman has been arrested for the 2020 murder of her newborn twin sons, whose bodies were found dumped in a rat-infested alley.Stephanie Castillo, 36, was charged with multiple counts of murder on Friday, after DNA collected from a discarded drink container linked her to the crime, sources told the New York Post.The twin boys, later named Zeke and Zane by NYPD officers, were found dead in Claremont in November 2020. Investigators never gave up on the case, and newly uncovered forensic evidence identified Castillo as their biological mother.“Our detectives had the funeral for these two children,” said NYPD assistant chief Michael Baldassano. “Every year they had a memorial for these two children. They have never stopped caring about this case.”Castillo now faces first- and second-degree murder charges in both deaths, along with counts of murder with intent and manslaughter.Renford Cole, 75, the building superintendent who found the bodies, said the arrest has brought him peace. “Oh man. This is really a big burden lifted off my mind, a big weight,’’ he said.“I’m so happy to know that they find the person because those were babies, innocent babies.""""I am going to sleep better tonight,” he said.Cole discovered the bodies behind a College Avenue building, just blocks from the 44th Precinct, where Castillo was led out in handcuffs on Friday. One of the newborns was partially wrapped in a pet training pad with apparent head injuries and an umbilical cord around his neck. The other, found roughly 20 feet away, was inside a black plastic bag without visible trauma. Both infants were under 24 hours old.Sources said Castillo previously lived in the building with her parents and had not disclosed her pregnancy to anyone. A breakthrough came when blood evidence from the crime scene led to a match in a genealogical DNA database, through a relative of the suspect. The NYPD’s forensic division narrowed in on Castillo, who was then tracked to a nearby shelter.According to sources, Castillo unknowingly sealed her fate when she discarded a drink container. Investigators recovered it and matched her DNA to the crime scene.“Interviews and video canvasses and the really great work of our forensic investigation division brought us to where we are today,” Baldassano said.Homeland Security Investigations also assisted in Castillo’s arrest.Nearly 20 officers had organised a funeral for the infants in 2021, placing their bodies in a shared white casket adorned with white flowers and a blue bow.“I have never seen a case like this,” one detective had said at the time.“These were two newborn babies who were full term and then put in garbage bags and thrown in a rat infested backyard.""""Their little bodies had fractures. This has weighed heavy on every detective,” he told the New York Post.Cole recalled the day he made the grim discovery. “I saw [a trash bag] there from early in the morning, but I thought it was garbage. I paid it no mind because people threw garbage back there all the time,’’ he said.Then, “I saw the legs sticking out. The legs were straight,’’ he said.Initially thinking it was a doll, he was confused when he touched them, as they were soft.""I went inside to get my buddy. He said it wasn’t a toy. I told him to call the police.”“Today is a very good day,” Cole said.","Stephanie Castillo, 36, was charged with multiple counts of murder on Friday, after DNA collected from a discarded drink container linked her to the crime.
