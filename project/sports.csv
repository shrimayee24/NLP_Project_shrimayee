"“Screw it”: Travis Kelce reacts to the $14,069 NFL fine for paying homage to Tony Gonzalez after scoring a historic touchdown",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/screw-it-travis-kelce-reacts-to-the-14069-nfl-fine-for-paying-homage-to-tony-gonzalez-after-scoring-a-historic-touchdown/articleshow/117136230.cms,"Image via Getty Images

Travis Kelce opened up about the $14,069 NFL fine

Tony Gonzalez , a legendary tight end in NFL history, achieved 15,127 receiving yards, 1,325 receptions, and 111 touchdowns. His iconic goal post dunk celebration was banned by the NFL after his retirement, leaving fans nostalgic for a simpler era of celebratory football. Travis Kelce , who has redefined the tight end position with over 12,000 receiving yards and seven consecutive 1,000-yard seasons, decided to pay homage to Gonzalez with the move. As a result of the lighthearted moment that mixed two eras of NFL glory, Kelce was fined for the joke that came from Jon Runyan's adoration of the number 69.The Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce was expecting punishment after celebrating his Christmas Day Game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Kelce's 77th career touchdown on December 25 passed Tony Gonzalez for the most receiving touchdowns in Chiefs franchise history , surpassing Hall of Famer.The All-Pro tight end honored the Chiefs icon by dunking the football on the crossbar after scoring a historic touchdown, a gesture that was a special way to commemorate his historic feat. The league eventually fined Kelce $14,069 for his celebration. It was deemed unsportsmanlike conduct after the Chiefs star used the crossbar as a prop.Kelce discussed an incident on his ""New Heights"" podcast with his brother, Jason Kelce, stating that he was ""of course"" punished by the NFL for his antics. He said, ""They said since I touched the goal post it was a fine."" Kelce admitted that his dunk did not go as planned and that it wasn't his best moment.""I was trying to get my (expletive) old ass up there, man,"" Kelce said. ""Fourth quarter of the game, my (expletive) legs are tired after a 10-play drive. ... I'm just like, 'Screw it, I'm gonna send it one time for old time's sake.'""... That was me slapping the backboard. That wasn't me actually flushing it.""In November, Tony Gonzalez offered Kelce a fine if he dunked the ball, but Kelce declined, stating that while he appreciated the gesture, there was no need for the same. ""Tony, you don't have to do that, dude,"" Kelce said on the podcast. ""It was so cool to hear you even say it, dude, but you don't have to help me pay that fine.""Also Read: “Dumb frat boy”: Fans trash Travis Kelce claiming he is out of his league to marry superstar Taylor Swift Tony Gonzalez set a record for the greatest tight end of all time, but Kelce is making a strong case for the title.

Struggles and Expectations

Devin Booker (30 PTS) & Kevin Durant (27 PTS) TAKE OVER vs Hornets! | January 12, 2025

Roster Changes and Coaching Decisions

Looking Ahead for the Suns

Devin Booker Drops 34 Points vs Jazz | January 11, 2025

The Phoenix Suns are having a lot of problems in the current season so far, exacerbated by a four-game losing streak and rumours of tensions in the dressing room. They have now stood at 15-18 as of January 13, 2025, which currently puts them 12th in the Western Conference and causing doubt about their playoff capabilities.The Suns began the campaign with high expectations to achieve much success after they signed Bradley Beal who partners with Kevin Durant and Devin Booker . However, the desired performance level has not been produced by the team. They are at 8-1 but have dropped ten out of the last thirteen close matches.Recent stories show that players are growing more frustrated with confusing roles and their use by the coaching staff. Some of the problems are that some players are unsure of their roles with the team structure, and that has created displeasure. Such circumstances have led to extensive roster shuffling; Pierce relegated Beal to the bench alongside Nurkic; however, Ryan Dunn starts as a centre in his rookie season, and the last is Mason Plumlee. This decision came after head coach Mike Budenholzer had been trying to address the woes as well as try to fine-tune the play on the court.The surge in the change of the starting line up is seen as a necessity in the enhancement of the team’s performance morale among players. Moreover, the Suns have not been able to set their desired game-plan consistently, most recently evidenced by a record 18 point walloping by the Indiana Pacers. Internal challenges have been exacerbated by external pressures, such as trade rumours and increased scrutiny from fans and analysts. The Suns have made significant investments in their roster but have struggled to integrate Beal alongside two prominent scorers, Durant and Booker. Beal's performance has been hindered by injuries, raising concerns about his compatibility within the team's structure.As the Suns approach upcoming games, including a match against the Philadelphia 76ers, they must prioritize rebuilding team chemistry and resolving locker room issues. The coaching staff is responsible for identifying solutions that leverage the team's star power and promote collaboration. Devin Booker and Kevin Durant remain key figures for the Suns, and their leadership amid locker room tensions will be crucial for the team's turnaround. The upcoming weeks are vital for Phoenix as they strive to regain their position in a competitive Western Conference.Also Read : Zion Williamson faces one game suspension as Pelicans enforce team policy violation penalty",Phoenix Suns are 15-18 and 12th in the Western Conference.

When and where to watch the Golden State Warriors vs Toronto Raptors game tonight (January 13, 2025)?

is expected to be back in the team’s lineup for their upcoming game against the Toronto Raptors . Curry has missed eight of the Warriors’ 38 games so far. The 36-year-old star has usually sat out for one game of back-to-backs as he has been dealing with injuries. Despite all the struggle, Curry has been the Warriors’ best player recording 22.6 points, 5.1 rebounds, and 6.1 assists on 44.6% shooting whenever he takes the floor.Though, it has to be said that Curry isn’t playing up to his usual levels. As a result, the Warriors have also suffered and are currently 11th in the Western Conference. This is quite surprising as the Warriors started this season with a record of 12-3. Since then they have lost 16 of their last 23 games. The Dubs haven’t been clicking and have gradually lost their championship mentality.However, tomorrow’s game shouldn’t be too much of a challenge for Stephen Curry and Co. The Raptors are 8-31 this season and currently hold the 14th team in the Eastern Conference. Toronto has lost a lot of power on offense and has no identity on defense. As a result, they will most likely fail to make the playoffs this season. It is scary to see how far both these teams have fallen after facing each other in the 2019 NBA Finals.Back then, the Raptors had Kawhi Leonard leading the charge. The Warriors were also a lot stronger and had both Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson alongside Stephen Curry. Now, the Warriors will once again be looking towards Stephen Curry as they try and put a much-needed win on the board.Andrew Wiggins will also be returning to the Dubs’ lineup for this game. But, Draymond Green remains questionable as he is currently dealing with a back issue. It’ll be interesting to see what kind of starting five Steve Kerr fields to take down the Raptors tonight.ALSO READ: Golden State Warriors vs Toronto Raptors (01/13): Starting five, injury report, start time, game prediction, betting tips, how to watch, and more The Golden State Warriors will visit the Scotiabank Arena to take on the Toronto Raptors at 7:30 PM ET on Monday, January 13, 2025.

Sydney Cricket Ground is love at first sight: SCG museum, walk of fame and all the facilities

NEW DELHI: Known for making controversial remarks, Yograj Singh , father of former India cricketer Yuvraj Singh , recently made a shocking revelation saying he once went to legendary all-rounder Kapil Dev 's house with a pistol to kill him.Yograj, a former India cricketer himself, said that he did so after the 1983 World Cup winner dropped him from the Indian team.Yograj, who played one Test and six ODIs for India in Australia and New Zealand in 1980-81, said that he spared Kapil’s life because of his mother.“When Kapil Dev became captain of India, North Zone, and Haryana, he dropped me for no reason,” Yograj said on“My wife (Yuvi’s mother) wanted me to ask Kapil questions. I told her that I would teach this bloody man a lesson.“I took my pistol out, I went to Kapil’s house in Sector 9. He came out with his mother.“I abused him a dozen times. I told him because of you I have lost a friend and what you have done, you will pay for it.“I told him, ‘I want to put a bullet through your head, but I am not doing it because you have a very pious mother, who is standing here.’ I told Shabnam, ‘Let’s go.’“That was the moment I decided I would not play cricket , Yuvi will play.”Yograj also slammed late Bishan Singh Bedi, saying that the former left-arm spinner plotted against him.“These guys, including Bishan Singh Bedi, plotted against me. I never forgave Bishan Singh Bedi. The man died on his bed,” he said.“When I was dropped I spoke to Ravindra Chadha, one of the selectors. He told me that Bishan Singh Bedi (the chief selector) didn’t want to pick me because they thought I was Sunil Gavaskar’s man and because I was playing cricket in Mumbai. I was very close to Gavaskar.”Yograj went on to say that he hasn't spoken to the former India captain in all these years.“In 2011 when India won the World Cup, there was only one guy who was crying, and it was Kapil Dev,” he said.“I did send him a paper cutting that my son did better than you in the World Cup,” he added.Yograj did say that Kapil has apologised to him.“Kapil sent me a WhatsApp text saying we will be brothers in the next life. We will be born from the same mother in the next life. He wanted to meet me. But there is a vengeance, and it still hurts,” said Yograj.","Yograj Singh once went to legendary all-rounder Kapil Dev's house with a pistol to kill him.

Injured Sarfaraz unlikely to play Mumbai's crucial Ranji tie vs J&K

Pacer Deshpande's return delayed due to injury

MUMBAI: Under-fire due to his poor form of late, Indian captain Rohit Sharma is set to train with the Mumbai Ranji Trophy team from Tuesday, according to a reliable source.Mumbai play their first game of the second leg of the Ranji Trophy against Jammu & Kashmir at the Mumbai Cricket Association's ground in BKC from January 23. There is an informal advisory from the BCCI to the Team India players to turn out for their state in the Ranji Trophy, unless they are on national duty or injured.Rohit, who opted out of the final Test, managed to score just 31 runs in three Tests in the recently-concluded Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia""Rohit, Ajinkya Rahane Shreyas Iyer (who was recently named as the Punjab Kings captain) and Shardul Thakur will train with the Mumbai team at the Wankhede Stadium on Tuesday, and then at the BKC on Wednesday and Thursday. Rohit has told the MCA that he will come for practice. At the moment, there are all indications that he’s keen to play the match versus J&K,"" a source told TOI.Meanwhile, in what will be a big blow for Mumbai, TOI has learnt that India's middle-order Test batter Sarfaraz Khan has sustained a minor hairline fracture in the ribs while being with the Indian team in Australia during the recently-concluded Border-Gavaskar series, and is thus unlikely to turn out for the defending champions' crucial Ranji Trophy match against Jammu & Kashmir.Sarfaraz didn't get an opportunity to play in the 2024-25 BGT. ""He suffered the injury while fielding during practice just a couple of days before the Indian team left Australia. After coming back to India, a scan showed that he had sustained a minor rib fracture, and he was advised a three-week complete rest by the doctor. He is unlikely to play for Mumbai in their Ranji match against J&K. In fact, he could miss the entire league stage of the tournament, and be only fit by the knockouts,"" a source told TOI.A prolific batter in domestic cricket, Sarfaraz has scored 4953 runs in 54 first-class matches@65.61, with 16 hundreds and 14 fifties. In the last match that he played for Mumbai, the Irani Cup clash against Rest of India, Sarfaraz slammed an unbeaten 222 to shape Mumbai's first win in the Irani Cup in 27 years.Mumbai, though, will be bolstered by the return of allrounder Shivam Dube, who has been axed from India's T20I team for the upcoming five-match series against England at home.In another blow for Mumbai, it's learnt that Mumbai's experienced India pacer Tushar Deshpande, who underwent an ankle operation on September 30 last year in London, will not be available for a major part of the second half of the Ranji Trophy, which is set to begin from Jan 23.It means that Deshpande will not be available for Mumbai's match against Jammu & Kashmir from Jan 23. In Deshpande's absence, Mumbai have been struggling badly in the bowling department, with allrounder Shardul Thakur, who too underwent an ankle surgery last year, still not back to his best.""Tushar is recuperating at the BCCI's Centre of Excellence in Bengaluru. He will take some more time to recover. Tentatively, he is slated to return to action in mid-February, in time for the Ranji Trophy semifinals. So, if Mumbai make it to the semifinals, Deshpande will be available from then,"" a source told this paper.After an impressive outing in IPL 2024 for the Chennai Super Kings, the 29-year-old fast bowler has missed all the domestic tournaments this season due to his ankle injury.Deshpande played a key role in Mumbai's 43rd title-winning Ranji Trophy campaign in March, claiming 15 wickets in five matches, and played a couple of T20Is (took two wickets@27.50) for India during the Zimbabwe tour in July, just after the T20 World Cup.Deshpande will play for the Rajasthan Royals , who bought him for Rs 6.50 crores, in IPL 2025 from March 14.",Rohit Sharma set to train with the Mumbai Ranji Trophy team from Tuesday.

LIVE: India announce T20I squad vs England: Shami returns, no Pant

NEW DELHI: Weighing in on Team India pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah ’s workload concerns, legendary Indian cricketer Kapil Dev on Monday stressed the futility of comparing players from different eras.Speaking on the sidelines of the Professional Golf Tour of India (PGTI) press conference, the former Indian skipper, also the president of PGTI, opened up on the significant differences between his playing days and modern cricket.""Please do not compare (me with Bumrah); you cannot compare one generation with another. The boys of today score 300 runs in a single day, which didn’t happen in our time. So, don’t compare,"" Kapil told media.Following a 3-1 series defeat in Australia and injury to Bumrah, the issue of 'workload management' has stirred debate recently, with Balwinder Sandhu, Kapil’s former teammate from the 1983 World Cup-winning squad, lashing out at the concept, calling this a term ""created by Australians"" In an interview with TimesofIndia.com, Sandhu recently dismissed Bumrah's workload concerns.""Workload? How many overs did he bowl? 150-something, right? But in how many matches or innings? Five matches or nine innings, correct? That comes down to 16 overs per innings or 30 overs per match. And he didn’t bowl those 15-plus overs in one go. He bowled in spells. So, is it a big deal? Workload management is bull**,"" he added.""During our time, we bowled 25–30 overs daily. Kapil (Dev) bowled long spells throughout his career. Your body and muscles get conditioned when you bowl, bowl, and bowl. So, I don’t agree with this workload management concept.""Bumrah bowled an exhaustive 151.2 overs, delivering 908 balls during the recently concluded Border-Gavaskar Trophy (BGT), only to face an unfortunate, injury-laden end to his campaign.Now grappling with a back injury that could endanger his participation in the upcoming Champions Trophy, Bumrah will be looking to solve the fitness puzzle.Additionally, the pacer took on leadership responsibilities in the BGT. Bumrah captained India in two Tests, securing a victory in Perth but facing defeat in Sydney.The dual challenges of bowling and leadership also invited scrutiny on his workload.Touching on potential leadership transitions in Indian cricket, Kapil Dev, however, asked for patience. ""Whoever you give an opportunity to, at least give them some time,"" Kapil urged, stressing the need for stability and support for new captains.","Kapil Dev says it is wrong to compare Jasprit Bumrah's workload with his own. Balwinder Sandhu, Kapil's former teammate from the 1983 World Cup-winning squad, has dismissed the concept of 'workload management' as 'bull**' The former Indian skipper was speaking at the Professional Golf Tour of India.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117208265,imgsize-21430,width-400,resizemode-4/117208265.jpg"

NEW DELHI: After a year that can at best be termed a ""mixed bag"" for Indian badminton , the country's top shuttlers will look to kick off 2025 on a high note as the India Open Super 750 tournament begins here at the KD Jadhav Indoor Stadium on Tuesday.The tournament will feature 16 of the world's top-20 men's singles players and 14 of the top20 women's singles shuttlers.Interestingly, there hasn't been an Indian success at the tournament since 2022, when Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty won the men's doubles title and Lakshya Sen clinched the men's singles crown.Last year, Indian shuttlers struggled to secure titles. The only significant victories came from Satwik and Chirag, who won titles at the French Open and Thailand Open just before the Olympics.The Paris Games saw the Indian badminton team return without securing any medal. PV Sindhu , a two-time Olympic medallist, was eliminated in the pre-quarterfinals. Lakshya Sen lost in the bronze-medal match to Malaysia's Lee Zii Jia.Satwik and Chirag, who were primed to win the men's doubles gold, made a shocking exit in the quarterfinals. Here, they will face Malaysia's Wei Chong Man and Kai Wun Tee in the opening round.Despite a disappointing 2024, one can never count out two-time Olympic medallist PV Sindhu.

NEW DELHI: Who will be India's next Test captain? It's a question that will keep buzzing in the BCCI corridors over the next few months, until the selectors huddle up sometime, maybe, in May to pick the team for the England tour in June. Until then, the debate could linger.For many, the obvious choice is Jasprit Bumrah; but throw in the question of his workload management, and some of the ifs and buts start appearing. In Rohit Sharma 's case, the jury is out, while the skipper himself seems to be on the edge of retirement. In fact, Timesofindia.com learned that he was ready to bow out after the fourth Test on the recently-concluded tour of Australia, but his ""well-wishers"" persuaded him to hang in for now.There have been discussions in corners about India moving on to its next-generation players as leaders, with Rishabh Pant and Shubman Gill the two possible names. But their less-than-flattering show in Australia hasn't done their chances any good.Will the BCCI go back to Virat Kohli and ask him to look after the team and groom the next captain, possibly with Rohit still around as part of the leadership group? The answer to that is under lock and key at the moment.Sharing his two cents on India's Test captaincy issue, former England spinner Monty Panesar feels that performances in the Champions Trophy and the Indian Premier League (IPL) over the next 3-4 months will settle that debate.The Champions Trophy runs from February 19 to March 9, with the IPL beginning a couple of weeks after, followed by the tour of England.""Bumrah, I think, would want to lead in England because of the seaming conditions,"" said Panesar, talking to Timesofindia.com from London.Bumrah was named Player of the Series for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy for his 32 wickets, but he suffered a back injury during the fifth Test. It has also created uncertainty over his Champions Trophy participation.""It just depends on the selectors and also speaking to Bumrah about 'how did you feel about captaincy? Did it get the best out of you? Do you feel it's the best for the team? Is the team listening?'"" Panesar said.""The question is, is Bumrah the best captain for India when it comes to making it into a winning side? Or do they just say, 'maybe we need a batting captain?'""The former left-arm spinner, who has his family roots in Punjab and played 50 Tests for England, said it's difficult to look beyond Pant and Gill if it comes to picking a new captain -- in case Rohit and Virat leave the scene or both remain available for the England tour but decide to stay away from captaincy.Kohli stepped down as the Test captain in 2022, while Rohit 'stepped away' from the fifth Test in Australia, allowing Gill to take his place in the playing eleven.Rohit scored a mere 31 runs in five innings of BGT. He has also lost five of his last six Tests as captain, drawing the one in Brisbane.""When it comes to that (picking a young player as Test captain), you're looking more towards Gill, really. But does he have the experience? Is he going to have a good IPL? And if he does show that for Gujarat Titans, you may just say, 'hang on a minute, this is a good time to do it.' But then overseas tours, you know, it's a big risk,"" Panesar viewed.""You don't see many teams having a fresh captain for an away tour. They always go for an experienced campaigner, and they may just think, 'you know what, let's just go with Bumrah or Rohit...let's not put the pressure of captaincy on Pant or Gill because they still need to show that they can do well throughout a whole series, not in patches.""Rohit is expected to lead India in the Champions Trophy. In fact, the former secretary of the BCCI, Jay Shah, had announced long before that Rohit will lead India in the tournament. However, things have changed since, as his bat has gone silent in red-ball cricket, putting him under self-doubt.India are reported to have sought an extension from the International Cricket Council (ICC) for announcing their Champions Trophy squad. The deadline for that was January 12. It has further raised doubts over the situation with Rohit and the team's captain in the prestigious ODI tournament, which is making a return to the ICC calendar.""Let's say if India win the Champions Trophy (with Rohit as captain), then I just think India will lean towards (sticking with) Rohit as the captain,"" said Panesar.But that's if Rohit wants to continue his international career.To conclude his views, Panesar said winning can change a lot of things.""It's about winning. India needs to get back to winning ways. When you're winning, then it's a lot easier to make decisions. When you're losing, then what you have to do is have a fresh start. You have to bring in, maybe, new players or get the experienced players to groom the next young captain coming through. I think India needs to get back to winning ways, and the sooner they do, it would take a lot of pressure off a lot of other issues.""","Jasprit Bumrah is the obvious choice to be India's next Test captain. But the jury is out on Rohit Sharma, who seems to be on the edge of retirement. Rishabh Pant and Shubman Gill are the two possible names.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117220514,imgsize-32954,width-400,resizemode-4/117220514.jpg"

His career accolades have earned him widespread praise from sports journalists and make him one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time.Patrick Mahomes, a 15-1 starter this season, faced numerous obstacles, often winning games late in the fourth quarter with incredible plays. Despite facing worse protection at points, Mahomes helped his team win those games, thanks to luck and areas that helped him become even better, as noted by Travis Kelce.""I've seen Pat weather that storm and become better because of it,"" Kelce said on the Pat McAfee Show. ""When the team needs him the most he steps up in ways he hasn't before. It happens year in, year out, and it's so much fun to be on a team with him because he's always going to take the bull by the horns and be the most accountable, be the one that puts it on himself more than anybody else, and that's true leadership.""Mahomes, a formidable quarterback, poses a significant threat to the rest of the AFC, despite the Chiefs' weaker performance. With four Super Bowl appearances in the last five seasons and three wins, Mahomes has become one of the greatest playoff quarterbacks in history. His continued improvement could potentially lead to his fourth Lombardi Trophy in a month.He is one of five quarterbacks in NFL history to have won three or more Super Bowls as a starter. Mahomes's career accolades throughout seven seasons in the NFL have earned him wide praise from sports journalists, and he is considered one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time.

Samuel’s gesture surprised fans as he is known to be a long-standing supporter of the Atlanta Falcons.In fact, the honorary Oscar winner appeared in a cinematic tribute to the Falcons this September. “The challenges come at you fast and they come at you furious… never more so when their names are Kelce and Mahomes,” he says in the opening.During the segment, Jackson also recalled selling concessions at the Falcons’ former Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium home in the sixties, Atlanta being his home town. So, fans were a tad surprised to see Jackson cheering for the Ravens this year.Early this year, the QB shared that he had reached out to the MCU actor for a voiceover gig in a children’s cartoon. After publishing a children’s book Jackson has shown interest in being a part of a children’s cartoon by providing voiceover. And he has already reached out to Samuel L. Jackson to help him land a gig, considering the actor has extensive voiceover experience.“I wanna do a children’s cartoon. I wanna do a voiceover or something… I think I reached out to Samuel L. Jackson because I have seen him doing something like that. So I’m like, ‘Man, help me get in the door to do a voiceover for something animated, with children or something like that’,”","The Baltimore Ravens beat the Pittsburgh Steelers 28-14 on Wild Card Saturday.

Is Jerry Jones Considering Deion Sanders as the Top Candidate for the Dallas Cowboys Head Coach Role?



Challenges and Opportunities for Deion Sanders



Mike McCarthy 's tenure as the Dallas Cowboys ' head coach has officially come to an end after five seasons. Team owner Jerry Jones expressed gratitude, stating that the decision was mutual and made ""prior to reaching the point of contract negotiations."" Despite a strong regular-season performance, including back-to-back 12-win seasons and two NFC East titles, playoff struggles plagued McCarthy’s Cowboys. Upset losses in the Wild Card Round defined their postseason runs. Deion Sanders has emerged as a leading candidate to fill the coaching vacancy, per Fox Sports’ Jordan Schultz.The speculation surrounding Deion Sanders joining the Dallas Cowboys as their next head coach is heating up. Following the team's decision to part ways with Mike McCarthy, ""Coach Prime"" has emerged as a prominent name in discussions about the role. Recent report has confirmed that Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has already initiated conversations with Sanders, sparking widespread anticipation.Deion Sanders, currently the head coach at the University of Colorado, has proven his mettle in the collegiate coaching arena. After a stellar tenure at Jackson State, where he led the Tigers to a 27-6 record and two SWAC championships, Sanders transformed Colorado's football program. He inherited a struggling Buffaloes team and spearheaded an impressive turnaround, taking them from a 1-11 record in 2022 to a 9-4 finish in 2024. Under his leadership, Colorado came close to a Big 12 title and produced a Heisman Trophy winner in Travis Hunter.Despite his success at the college level, Sanders has yet to coach in the NFL. However, his magnetic leadership style, strategic acumen, and Hall of Fame pedigree make him a compelling candidate. ""Coach Prime"" is no stranger to the Cowboys either—his five seasons with the team included a Super Bowl XXX victory, solidifying his legacy in Dallas.While the Cowboys are keen on Sanders, his potential move to Dallas hinges on several factors. One of the most intriguing is the possibility of coaching his sons, Shedeur and Shilo Sanders, at the professional level. Deion has expressed that coaching both sons in the NFL would be a significant motivating factor for him.Shedeur Sanders, a star quarterback at Colorado, is projected to be a top pick in the 2025 NFL Draft. If the Cowboys are serious about securing Deion, orchestrating a path to draft Shedeur could become a critical selling point. However, with Dak Prescott firmly established as the Cowboys' quarterback, integrating Shedeur into the team’s plans would require careful consideration.Additionally, leaving behind the foundation he has built at Colorado presents a significant dilemma for Sanders. The program has experienced a resurgence under his leadership, and departing now would mean leaving an unfinished legacy.Also Read: Is a new Taylor Swift album on the way?

John Cena's WWE Raw Promo: Genius or Overhyped? Tommy Dreamer Weighs the Debate

After declaring last year that he would be retiring from professional wrestling at the end of 2025, John Cena returned to television with the Netflix premiere of WWE Raw. In a promotional video, Cena stated that he plans to compete in the Royal Rumble match early next month. If that doesn't work out, he will try to win a title at WWE WrestleMania 41 by competing in the Elimination Chamber.During his appearance on Busted Open After Dark , former WWE star Tommy Dreamer extensively discussed Cena's history and promotional material. Dreamer claims that before Cena left and returned to WWE, fans undervalued him for years. Dreamer thinks that part of what makes professional wrestling so unique is that Cena's promo on ""Raw"" incorporated aspects of his real life.He said, ""John Cena really willed the audience to believe that he could [win another world title],"" Dreamer said. ""It's the story of what everyone wants to do — we go to work why? Because we want a promotion, or we want to be recognized for the good that we do. We want money, we want raises, we want all those important things that come with it. For John Cena, he's gonna try to do the impossible.""Dreamer felt himself becoming more motivated as Cena performed his live promo, and he concluded that Cena could achieve anything he set his mind to. Since tenacity is something that everyone can relate to or strive for, this gives viewers a means of connecting with Cena.Dreamer and Cena traveled together for a while, and the former wrestler said that Cena goes above and beyond to show off his hard work and dedication. No matter how late he might have stayed out the previous evening, Dreamer remembered Cena as someone who was always there for whatever the company needed him for during their travels together. Dreamer compared Cena's enthusiasm for the sport to that of Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, saying that few wrestlers are as driven as Cena.""John Cena's entering the Royal Rumble ... and he's coming to try to win it,"" Dreamer continued. ""There's still hope if he doesn't win that, but that was one hell of a promo and it took us on a ride. I truly loved it.""The 16-time World Champion's lasting influence on the sport is demonstrated by Tommy Dreamer's admiration for Cena's unwavering dedication and capacity to motivate others.

The MI Emirates claimed their first victory of the ILT20 2025 season with a commanding 26-run win against the Dubai Capitals at the Zayed Cricket Stadium in Abu Dhabi on Monday. Half-centuries from Tom Banton and Nicholas Pooran set the stage for a strong performance, while Fazalhaq Farooqi 's brilliant bowling sealed the deal.Despite a heroic century from Shai Hope , the Dubai Capitals suffered their first loss against MI Emirates in the tournament's history. Hope's 101 off 59 balls, the first century for a Capitals player in the ILT20 and only the third in the competition’s history, was in vain as the Emirates’ bowlers turned the tide late in the game.Chasing a target of 188, the Capitals started cautiously, with Akeal Hosein's spin nearly providing an early breakthrough. A dropped catch by Waqar Salamkheil gave Hope a reprieve, allowing him to anchor the innings.

Kieron Pollard contributed 22 off 19 as the Emirates posted a formidable target.Despite Hope's brilliance, the Capitals faltered under the pressure of disciplined bowling. Farooqi, with figures of 2-22, and Zahoor Khan's tight spells proved decisive in the Emirates' maiden victory.Reflecting on the loss, Hope admitted, ""A hundred always feels sweeter when it contributes to a win. Unfortunately, we fell short with the bat today.""Meanwhile, Player of the Match Tom Banton highlighted his role in anchoring the innings, saying, ""It was tricky at the start, but we had spoken about someone batting through.

MI Cape Town 's pace spearhead Kagiso Rabada delivered a match-winning performance in their 33-run victory over Paarl Royals during the first Cape Derby of SA20 Season 3 at Newlands on Monday. Rabada's two remarkable wicket-maiden overs turned the game on its head, as he dismissed Royals' openers Joe Root (26 off 14) and Lhuan-dre Pretorius (26 off 12) in quick succession.Reflecting on his performance, Rabada credited his execution of plans for his success. ""I guess I was just trying to hit good lengths and mix it up with the slow ball and a bouncer whenever I felt it was right. So that's what I tried to do, and it paid off,"" Rabada said post-match.Despite the Royals' strong start, Rabada was confident in his approach. ""I was always going to bowl from the fourth over. I think I was always scheduled to bowl at that time,"" he explained.Rabada also shared his admiration for teammate Trent Boult , who bowled alongside him with the new ball. ""Trent Boult, played against him for so many years and you get nervous in the changing room whenever he has the ball, especially the new ball. It's nice to play with him, bounce ideas off each other, and just talk fast bowling. It's pretty cool to share the same dressing room with someone like that,"" he said.Rabada praised the atmosphere at Newlands, a venue he described as special. ""Newlands is a stadium with a rich cricket heritage. People in Cape Town love cricket, and it shows in the turnout. The beautiful backdrop of the mountain behind the stadium makes it unique and gets people coming to watch some good cricket,"" he remarked.Reflecting on MI Cape Town's season so far, Rabada highlighted the benefits of team continuity. ""One thing that's different is that we've been with each other for a while now. It's a similar team, and that helps. Guys are more familiar with each other. But every season is fresh - this year is totally different from last year,"" he noted.Looking ahead to their rematch against the Royals in two days, Rabada emphasised the need to reset.

NEW DELHI: Indian cricketers received a tumultuous welcome when they arrived in Pakistan for a Test series in 1978. But the players were taken aback when a foreign-educated Pakistani cricketer referred to them as ""kafirs"", a pejorative term for those who don't adhere to Islam.""An unnecessary remark by a Cambridge-educated cricketer gave us a bit of a shock,"" writes Mohinder Amarnath in his newly-released memoirs, Fearless, penned with brother Rajender. The player who made the remark is not named.The incident occurred after a game in Rawalpindi. ""After the match, we were a bit casual boarding the bus. Gratuitously, this cricketer said, ""Bithao, bithao, in kafiron ko jaldi bithao (Board these nonbelievers quickly),"" writes Amarnath, further adding, ""What was the use of a good education if it could not change their negative attitude towards others?""Also See: Champions Trophy 2025 In contrast, the cricketers received a wildly joyous reception at the Karachi airport. About 40,000-50,000 turned up to welcome the visiting team. The crowd was double the number, but many had left beforehand because the flight was delayed.""The distance from the airport to the hotel normally took 20 minutes, but for us, it took four hours; people had occupied every inch of space on the pavement and the road, and they refused to leave unless and until they caught a glimpse of the Indian cricketers or shaken hands with us. They were warm and hospitable,"" says Amarnath, who played 69 Tests, scored 4,378 runs, hit 11 tons, took 32 wickets, was also Man of the Match in India's 1983 ODI World Cup final triumph.However, some Pakistani players behaved differently. The memoir says, ""… this artificial bubble burst quicker than anticipated and hostility emerged from an expected quarter. Apparently, certain Pakistani players acted on the advice of seniors and kept their distance. If we spoke to them, their tone and tenor was aggressive. At least two of them, Javed Miandad and Sarfraz Nawaz , and to a lesser degree Mudassar Nazar, took the advice a little too seriously.

When the same bowler pitched the ball up to him, it was dispatched to the fence. This annoyed Sarfraz and he vented his frustration in crass Punjabi words, which Gavaskar couldn't understand. After the over, he came to me and asked, ""Why is Sarfraz calling me pant coat?' I laughed at his ignorance and whispered, ""He meant p…c…!""

Arsenal v Manchester United | Key Moments | Third Round | Emirates FA Cup 2024-24

Manchester United scored first with a sublime strike (David Beckham in 1999 and Bruno Fernandes in 2025).

Arsenal had a goal ruled out for offside (Nicolas Anelka in 1999 and Gabriel Martinelli in 2025).

Arsenal equalised (Dennis Bergkamp in 1999 and Gabriel in 2025).

United had a player sent off (Roy Keane in 1999 and Diogo Dalot in 2025).

United’s keeper saved a fantastic penalty and made numerous other saves to keep them in the game (Peter Schmeichel in 1999 and Altay Bayindir in 2025).

Roy Keane CLASHES with Patrick Vieira in the Highbury tunnel! 💥

Full Penalty Shootout | Arsenal 5-4 Manchester United | 2005 FA Cup Final

Coaching The Fundamental

Since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013, Manchester United fans – particularly those who reached adolescence when the Class of 1992 made the first-team cut – have channelled their inner Ronin (Hawkeye’s murderous avatar into beg the team not to give hope. Over the years, there have been numerous false dawns, slivers of light ahead of the tunnel that have made United fans dream again before they were snatched away, like Morpheus’ Nebuchadnezzar’s lament: “I had a dream, but the dream was taken from me.”There was the Van Gaal era where fans were convinced that a former tactician – a man some claim invented modern football – could bring United back to the glory years. Then they convinced themselves that the Special One, by sheer dint of willpower and personality (and a little bit of the dark arts), the fallen Lucifer to Pep Guardiola’s Michael, would be the right person to resuscitate the Red Devils. They almost persuaded themselves, when Ole was at the wheel, that the good times were rolling again. It certainly felt like that on that night in Paris and when United were playing like the Fergie teams of yore. They even dared to hope that a man named Eric would lead the charge again, much like the collared Frenchman who did it in the early Fergie years.And now, Ruben Amorim, the youngest Man Utd manager in half a century, is playing the Pandora’s Box’s old trick again. Of course, on paper, Amorim’s record is nothing to write home about. His record in his first 13 games reads: five wins, two draws and six losses. Most other Man Utd managers actually have better records. Sir Alex Ferguson’s read: three wins, seven draws and three losses. It’s what came after those 13 games that makes Manchester United fans believe.But there has been something of the old grit that defined Fergie teams that has Utd fans daring to hope again. The back-to-the-wall performance evoked an older Man Utd vs Arsenal clash: the epic 1999 replay.The similarities are astounding between the 1999 FA Cup semi-final replay and the 2025 third-round showdown between the two clubs.The only difference in the 2025 match was that it was decided on penalty shootouts and not a wondrous Ryan Giggs goal that made Maradona look up from his cocaine pile.And in a strange way, it was a mirror image of the 2005 FA Cup final with its infamous Band of Brothers viral image featuring Paul Scholes, Roy Keane, Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney , Ryan Giggs, Mikaël Silvestre and Quinton Fortune.Incidentally, Manchester United battered Arsenal in that match – a follow-up to the infamous 4-2 “I will see you out there” Highbury fight – but still lost on a penalty shootout with Paul Scholes missing the last penalty. That day, United had eight shots on target, 12 off target, and 12 corners (far more than Arsenal) but still lost.It was a different ballgame in 2025. Arsenal had 26 shots to Man Utd’s seven, 71% of the possession, and a 3.3 xG to United’s 1.1 but failed to make their mark. United players have been struggling to adapt to Ruben Amorim’s style, but against Arsenal (like they did against Manchester City and Liverpool), there was a slight glimpse of the taste in the pudding.In the cult classic Coach Carter – when Samuel L. Jackson was whipping a bunch of askew young men into shape – he was asked by his team what they should do since they hadn’t practised attacking. To this, Jackson’s Carter had said: “Run.” And that’s what United players did in the match, all of them running together as a pack to keep Arsenal at bay.Harry Maguire, often the pantomime villain on the football pitch and even in parliaments around the world, was a colossus in defence. Equally driven were Lisandro Martínez and Matthijs de Ligt, the latter finally learning how to operate in a three-man midfield.Of course, Arsenal’s inability to finish was one of the major reasons this match went to penalties, with Kai Havertz moved around the pitch like Roy Keane was screaming “You can’t score in a brothel!” in his ear.But United fans will rejoice at the grit from a team that, during the last days of the Ten Hag era, looked like they were simply not interested in playing football. Whether it was Bayindir’s redemption after the horror performance against Tottenham in the Carabao Cup, academy graduate Toby Collyer’s gut-bursting runs, Bruno’s Roy Keane impression or Noussair Mazraoui and Manuel Ugarte in midfield, this was a team effort.And the performance came against refereeing that launched a thousand memes about Arsenal players diving with abandon, which included a soft penalty and a red card.A swallow doesn’t make a summer, and Manchester United will probably have to suffer for many more years before they finally have a team worthy of cleaning the boots of any of the vintage Ferguson teams. But for the moment, United fans can at least hope that the current side, even if they lack the sheer world-class talent of the Band of Brothers or the 1999 winning team or any of the great Fergie teams, will give it their all every time they are wearing the United shirt.Next up in the FA Cup: Ruud van Nistelrooy’s Leicester City, the last interim manager of Manchester United and a man who knows a thing or two about the gigantic expectations that come with wearing the Manchester United shirt.",Manchester United lost 3-2 to Arsenal in the 2025 FA Cup third round. The match was a mirror image of the epic 1999 FA Cup semi-final replay. The only difference between the two matches was that it was decided on penalty shootouts.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117203496,imgsize-67192,width-400,resizemode-4/117203496.jpg"

In an alarming coincidence, each of their three home losses in this ISL campaign have come by that very scoreline.In a game that took until the second half to come to life, it was Mohammed Sanan who set the visitors on their way in the 64th minute with a clinical finish.Just as Mumbai City so nearly drew level when Nikolaos Karelis's left-footed effort stung Albino Gomes's palms in the closing minutes, Jordan Murray (86th) sealed the three points for Khalid Jamil's side following a quick break after Jamshedpur had won back possession.There was time for one final dagger which arrived in stoppage time as Javi Hernandez (90+6) fired home from inside the box.The win saw Jamshedpur climb to third place, level on points with Bengaluru (27pts) with a game in hand. Mumbai, meanwhile, still occupy sixth spot and that final playoff berth, but were left to rue another bitter outing at home. Although they went into this game with a confidence-boosting 3-2 win at East Bengal last week, there is no doubt that the Islanders are finding goals hard to come by this season.Coach Petr Kratky has even resorted to switching captain Lallianzuala Chhangte from his favoured position on the right of their usual three-man attack to playing in the hole behind the front three.It would yield no dividends on this occasion, as Jamshedpur's backline were disciplined enough to deal with anything Karelis, Vikram Partap Singh or Bipin Singh were able to ask of them.To make matters worse, Chhangte was sent off after the game for dissent.","Jamshedpur beat Mumbai City 0-3 at the Mumbai Football Arena.

Altay Bayindir was the unexpected hero for Manchester United as they edged past Arsenal in a dramatic FA Cup encounter at the Emirates. The match ended 1-1 after 90 minutes, and United triumphed 5-4 on penalties, with Bayindir making crucial saves both in normal time and during the shootout to send the holders into the fourth round.United took the lead early in the second half when Bruno Fernandes unleashed a thunderous strike into the top corner, capitalising on a slip by Gabriel after Alejandro Garnacho's incisive run. However, the game turned when Diogo Dalot received a second yellow card on the hour mark for a reckless challenge, leaving United to defend with 10 men for over half an hour.Arsenal wasted no time exploiting their numerical advantage as Gabriel Magalhães scored the equaliser, with Bayindir failing to deal with Gabriel Martinelli’s cross, resulting in a deflected shot finding the net.Despite dominating possession and creating multiple chances, Arsenal failed to capitalise. Their woes were compounded when Bayindir saved Martin Odegaard’s penalty following a controversial decision against Harry Maguire, who was furious at the call and clashed with Kai Havertz during the ensuing melee.Bayindir redeemed himself further with a stunning stop to deny Declan Rice and another to keep Havertz at bay as Arsenal squandered golden opportunities to secure the win in regulation.In the penalty shootout, United were flawless. Fernandes, Amad Diallo, Leny Yoro, Lisandro Martinez, and Josua Zirkzee all converted their spot-kicks, with Zirkzee calmly scoring the decisive penalty. Bayindir’s save against Havertz in the shootout proved pivotal, capping a remarkable performance for the Turkish goalkeeper.The defeat deepens Arsenal’s recent struggles, coming on the back of a League Cup semi-final first-leg loss to Newcastle. Manager Mikel Arteta expressed his frustration, stating, ""We deserved to win based on performance, but the reality is we’re out.""Arsenal’s misery was compounded by the sight of Gabriel Jesus being stretchered off in the first half with a suspected knee injury, adding to their growing list of absentees.For United, the win was a testament to their resilience under manager Ruben Amorim, who praised his side’s character in a hard-fought victory.

The defeat was a humbling experience for the European champions.""I think today is a good day because we beat one of the best teams in the world, for the second time this season, Real Madrid, and this is unbelievable. We won a title here and we are really happy... today is a day to look positively at this team,"" Flick said after the match.Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti attributed the heavy defeat to his team's defensive shortcomings.""We defended badly and that cost us the game -- they found their goals quite easily. We're sad, like all our fans, it's disappointing and we don't have to hide that... we have to look forwards, there's nothing else we can do,"" Ancelotti said.Despite Barcelona's strong start, Real Madrid took the lead in the fifth minute.

He then sprinted into the penalty area and chipped the ball past Szczesny.Lamine Yamal, the 17-year-old winger, scored a stunning individual goal to level the score. He cut in from the right and placed a low shot inside the near post, reminiscent of Lionel Messi.Barcelona continued to press forward and took the lead with a penalty kick converted by Robert Lewandowski. The penalty was awarded after Eduardo Camavinga's late and reckless challenge on Gavi.Raphinha extended Barcelona's lead with a header from Jules Kounde's cross. Barcelona then scored their fourth goal before halftime on a counter-attack. Yamal and Raphinha combined, and Raphinha set up Alejandro Balde, who calmly slotted the ball past Thibaut Courtois.Barcelona maintained their momentum in the second half. Raphinha scored their fifth goal with a skillful dribble and finish after being played in by Marc Casado.Barcelona was reduced to 10 men when Mbappe was brought down outside the penalty area by goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny. Mbappe had rounded Szczesny, and after a VAR review, the goalkeeper was sent off.Rodrygo, who had earlier hit the post, converted the resulting free-kick past Szczesny's replacement, Inaki Pena.Mbappe created a chance for Jude Bellingham, but the English midfielder's shot was blocked by a superb challenge from Jules Kounde in stoppage time.Mbappe also came close to scoring again with a fine individual effort, but his shot was saved by Inaki Pena.","Barcelona beat Real Madrid 5-2 in the Spanish Super Cup Clasico final held in Saudi Arabia.

Every player around the world, maybe except for a few, has a bad game and that is completely normal, but the moment Trent has one, everyone has an opinion about it,"" Slot said.Jayden Danns made it 3-0. Federico Chiesa scored his first goal for Liverpool after an injury-disrupted start to his time in England.Joao Felix shone for Chelsea, deputising for Cole Palmer. Felix and Tosin Adarabioyo each scored twice.

Plymouth, on the other hand, had not won an away game all season.Against the odds, Plymouth, who had recently dismissed manager Wayne Rooney, held firm and snatched a late victory. Whittaker's powerful strike from outside the box sealed the win nine minutes from time.""I have pride in everybody, and I'm pleased for the supporters. It's a big day for us.

Real Madrid's coach, Carlo Ancelotti, believes his team can avenge their previous defeat against Barcelona in the Spanish Super Cup final on Sunday. He emphasized the importance of learning from past mistakes to secure a victory.Barcelona had convincingly defeated Real Madrid 4-0 at the Santiago Bernabeu in La Liga earlier in the season. However, Real Madrid managed to surpass them in the league standings before the winter break.“We have to think about that game obviously, they beat us, we had a clear evaluation of what happened.”Ancelotti acknowledged the significance of the previous encounter and the need to analyze their performance. He stressed the importance of replicating the positive aspects of their play while avoiding past errors.“We started the game well, then had problems in the second half, so we have to try and repeat the good things we did and avoid the mistakes we made.”The added pressure of a final against their rivals adds another layer of complexity to the upcoming match. Ancelotti acknowledged the unique nature of Clasico finals.“The Clasico is even more pressured when it's a final, we've played a lot against Barcelona and playing a final against them is always something special.”Real Madrid's challenge lies in finding a balance between their attacking prowess and defensive solidity, especially after Kylian Mbappe 's arrival. The attacking quartet of Mbappe, Vinicius Junior, Jude Bellingham, and Rodrygo Goes offers significant offensive firepower. However, their defensive contributions are crucial for team balance.“(In recent Clasicos) individual quality has prevailed over team balance.”Ancelotti highlighted the importance of collective effort and defensive stability in such high-stakes matches.“An important aspect tomorrow will be balance and collective work -- defending.”He firmly believes that a strong defensive performance increases their chances of winning.“If you defend well, there's more chance of winning.”Despite a successful 2024 season with La Liga and Champions League titles, Ancelotti admitted that the heavy defeat against Barcelona remained a low point.“We're close to another trophy, we're thinking positively, but we know that in football anything can happen, above all when the opponent is strong and competes well like Barcelona.”Ancelotti acknowledged the unpredictable nature of football, particularly against a strong opponent like Barcelona. He also highlighted Real Madrid's progress and improvement as a team.“Our team has improved, nobody can argue with that.”He expressed confidence in their continued progress regardless of the outcome of the Super Cup final.“A defeat wouldn't be good but the team is not going backwards, it will keep moving forwards.”Dani Olmo's availability for Barcelona after a controversial temporary license approval by the Spanish national sports council (CSD) presents a challenge for Real Madrid.“Olmo will play and we have to minimise his quality.”Ancelotti chose to focus on minimizing Olmo's impact on the game rather than commenting on the controversy surrounding his eligibility.Barcelona coach Hansi Flick confirmed Olmo's readiness to play but hinted at a possible starting role for Gavi.“Gavi had a great performance against Athletic, he's got confidence... I think he's is going to play, but I am not 100 percent sure of who will play.”The Super Cup final represents Flick's first opportunity to win a trophy with Barcelona. He acknowledged the importance of a victory for the team's confidence.“If we win, we will have more confidence for the rest of the season.”He further emphasized the significance of winning the game for everyone involved.“Winning the game would be something really big for everyone.”",Real Madrid face Barcelona in the Spanish Super Cup final on Sunday.
