In a format where supremacy is often short-lived and margins razor-thin, the team has an opportunity to defend a men’s T20 World Cup title — an achievement that would further strengthen their legacy in the shortest format. India are also aiming to become the first nation to lift the T20 World Cup trophy on home soil.A successful campaign would also make India the first team to win the men’s T20 World Cup three times.India’s journey in the tournament began with glory in the inaugural edition in 2007, when they defeated Pakistan in the final at the New Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg under the captaincy of Mahendra Singh Dhoni. That iconic triumph laid the foundation for India’s dominance in T20 cricket.The second title, however, came after a long wait. Seventeen years later, India returned to the summit in 2024, with Rohit Sharma leading the side to a memorable title win. India edged past South Africa in a thrilling final to finally end their prolonged title drought.Now, with momentum on their side, India will look to script another historic chapter in T20 World Cup history.","India begin their T20 World Cup 2026 campaign against USA on Saturday.

Kim Meylemans and Nicole Silveira on their Olympic rivalry



Valentine’s Day is in the air, but it will look different for Kim Meylemans and Nicole Rocha Silveira. Instead of dinner plans, the married couple will hurtle headfirst down an icy track, chasing Olympic medals for different countries. At the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Olympics, Belgium’s Meylemans and Brazil’s Silveira are competing in the women’s skeleton event, lining up against each other less than a year after their wedding.After the first two heats, Meylemans sits eighth, 0.84 seconds off the lead. Silveira stands 12th, 1.30 seconds back. Austria’s Janine Flock leads heading into the final two heats, scheduled for Saturday.A year after marriage, skeleton stars Kim Meylemans and Nicole Silveira meet in Olympic showdown. However, this is not their first Olympic meeting. At the 2022 Beijing Games, Rocha Silveira finished 13th and Kim Meylemans 18th. Meylemans also competed at the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics. Since then, both athletes have grown on the World Cup circuit.Meylemans recently secured Belgium’s first overall women’s skeleton World Cup title after medaling in six of seven events this season. Silveira delivered Brazil’s best ever Olympic sliding result in 2022 and later earned two World Cup bronze medals during the 2024 to 2025 campaign.They met on the Skeleton World Cup tour in 2019. In 2021, they shared their relationship publicly. Silveira proposed in Brazil in 2024, and they married in Calgary in January 2025, where they now live and train.Both athletes describe competition as intense yet grounded in partnership. Meylemans acknowledged her wife’s role in her success.“This team right here is something truly special though and a big part of this success, I wouldn’t have achieved this goal without them, especially my wife,” Meylemans wrote in an Instagram post. “Don’t think anyone truly understands how much I needed her with me (pushing & supporting me) to achieve this.”Silveira also shared her thoughts. “Proud to be your wife and to walk this walk next to you,” she commented.Sharing the Olympic stage as rivals is a different experience altogether. “It’s very special to be able to share Olympic Games with your partner,” Silveira said. “It’s an extremely stressful, high-pressure period, so to have my person there as a comfort and safe space is of immense value to me, and also my performance. It brings a sense of calmness and normality into the [craziest] weeks of our career.”The couple, however, has a clear Olympic goal. “At the end of the day, we're working as a team, so if one of us is on the podium, in our small situation then that's great for us,” Meylemans told Olympics.com last year.Catch their Olympic journey on NBC, Peacock, and NBCOlympics.com, with the third heat at 12 p.m. ET Saturday and the final at 1:35 p.m. ET.","Kim Meylemans and Nicole Rocha Silveira are competing in the women's skeleton event at the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Olympics.

My Opinion On This Mock Trade

Trade discussion has picked up around the Los Angeles Dodgers as the 2026 season approaches, with reports connecting the club to Cincinnati Reds starter Hunter Greene. The idea of a deal involving Roki Sasaki has drawn attention because it would affect the direction of both pitching staffs.The Dodgers are preparing to use a six-man rotation again, while the Reds are trying to build on an 83-79 finish that earned them a Wild Card spot in 2025. There is no confirmation that the teams are negotiating, but Greene’s name has appeared often in offseason speculation.FanSided’s Christopher Kline suggested a scenario in which Los Angeles sends Sasaki, who is under rookie control through 2030, to Cincinnati for Greene. The proposal could also include prospects from the Dodgers’ farm system. Greene remains under team control as well, with the Reds holding a $21 million option for the 2029 season that would keep him with the club through age 29.Greene has said trade rumors have not bothered him, but his contract status and performance make him one of Cincinnati’s most valuable players.Los Angeles Dodgers enter 2026 after a strong postseason showing.Dodgers starters combined for a 1.54 ERA across eight playoff games, the second-lowest mark for teams that played at least eight games.Yoshinobu Yamamoto and Blake Snell are expected to remain central to the rotation. Sasaki had uneven results as a starter, posting a 4.72 ERA with 22 walks in 34.1 innings. He improved late in the season after adjusting his mechanics while pitching in relief and is projected to return to a starting role. Still, the Dodgers have enough depth to consider moving him.Hunter Greene, 26, led Cincinnati’s rotation in 2025. He recorded a 2.76 ERA over 107.2 innings and struck out 31.4 percent of hitters. His fastball is the foundation of his approach, and opponents averaged a 90.4 mph exit velocity against him. Greene is from California, which could make a move to Los Angeles a comfortable transition.The Reds finished with a 3.86 team ERA, with Greene standing out as the staff’s most consistent pitcher.Hunter Greene would give Los Angeles another established starter to slot alongside Yamamoto and Snell. His production, age, and control through 2029 would help the club manage payroll while keeping the rotation stable. Moving Sasaki could also reduce concerns tied to his walk rate while bringing in a pitcher with a longer track record.Cincinnati Reds would receive a 24-year-old pitcher with high-end velocity and several years of team control. Sasaki’s late-season relief work showed progress and suggests room for growth. Adding him could strengthen a young core without forcing the Reds out of contention.Clear rotation upgrade with Greene’s 2.76 ERA compared to Sasaki’s 4.72; controlled starter who fits a team focused on competing now.Loss of Sasaki’s long-term upside and possible prospect depth.Younger pitcher under control for more seasons who could develop into a frontline arm.Departure of the starter who helped drive an 83-win season and uncertainty about Sasaki’s adjustment to a full MLB workload.Also read: MLB trade rumors: Toronto Blue Jays target $4.26 million St. Louis Cardinals relief pitcher after Missing Out on Bo Bichette and Kyle Tucker The deal would represent a swap between present reliability and future potential. The Dodgers would add a proven starter as they pursue another title, while the Reds would bet on Sasaki’s development. Los Angeles appears better positioned to absorb the risk, but the outcome would depend on how both pitchers perform after the move.",Roki Sasaki is under rookie control through 2030. The Dodgers are preparing to use a six-man rotation again. The Reds are trying to build on an 83-79 finish that earned them a Wild Card spot in 2025.

Chris Bassitt’s $500K Jays Care donation shines as Blue Jays share heartfelt message following Orioles deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/chris-bassitts-500k-jays-care-donation-shines-as-blue-jays-share-heartfelt-message-following-orioles-deal/articleshow/128332317.cms,"Chris Bassitt with his family (Image via: IG/X)

The end of a player’s time with a team is often measured in numbers, but for Chris Bassitt, his Toronto chapter will be remembered for something far more meaningful. As the veteran right hander officially begins a new journey in the American League East, the Toronto Blue Jays chose to highlight his impact beyond baseball. Before fans focused on contracts or roster changes, the organization made sure to recognize the difference he made in the community.Over three seasons, Bassitt and his wife Jessica committed themselves to Jays Care initiatives that support youth through sport and mentorship. Their Pitch-In initiative became a steady source of funding for programs aimed at helping children grow through baseball. The impact was not symbolic. It was financial, consistent, and deeply personal.“Thank you to Chris and Jessica Bassitt for their incredible support of Jays Care over the past three seasons. 💙 Through the Bassitts Pitch-In initiative, the Bassitt family generously donated over $500,000 CAD to kids in Jays Care programs and made an immeasurable impact on our community. We’re deeply grateful and wish you all the best in your next chapter!”That message captured why Bassitt’s departure carries emotional weight.His $500,000 CAD donation will continue supporting children across Canada, ensuring his influence remains long after his final outing in Toronto.Now, Bassitt turns the page with the Baltimore Orioles, staying in the competitive AL East. His move keeps him in a division he knows well, but in a new uniform and role.Last season, Bassitt went 11 9 with a 3.96 ERA across 32 regular season appearances as Toronto claimed the American League pennant. During the postseason, he stepped into a relief role and posted a 1.04 ERA with 10 strikeouts in seven outings. His flexibility and steady presence proved valuable in high pressure moments.Entering his 11th major league season, Bassitt will turn 37 on Feb. 22. Throughout his career with the Chicago White Sox, Oakland Athletics, New York Mets, and Toronto, he has compiled an 83 65 record with a 3.64 ERA. For Baltimore, he adds experience and stability. For Toronto, he leaves a lasting legacy that extends far beyond the mound.","Blue Jays thank Chris Bassitt for $500K commitment to Jays Care programs.

Tilak Varma has performed well against Pakistan in the latest Asia Cup final and will try to continue that success.Since Sri Lanka’s pitches usually help spinners, Varun Chakravarthy could be an important bowler for India in this match.","India and Pakistan will train at different times ahead of their big T20 World Cup match on Sunday.

"What Is the ‘Year of the Super Bowl’ Campaign? All About ESPN, Disney and the NFL Turning One Game Into 12 Months",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/what-is-the-year-of-the-super-bowl-campaign-all-about-espn-disney-and-the-nfl-turning-one-game-into-12-months/articleshow/128309435.cms,"ESPN, Disney and the NFL are using “The Year of the Super Bowl” to stretch one game into a 12-month content and marketing machine.

Inside ESPN’s ‘Year of the Super Bowl’ campaign and how it works

Why Disney is pushing ‘We’re Going’ and what brands get out of a year-round Super Bowl

ESPN is not treating its first Super Bowl broadcast as a one-night job. The network, in partnership with the NFL and The Walt Disney Co., has rolled out “The Year of the Super Bowl,” a 12-month campaign that started right after Super Bowl 60 and runs through Super Bowl 61 on Feb. 14, 2027, on ESPN and ABC.The push is one of the biggest cross-company projects in ESPN and Disney history, with coordinated programming, park activations and ad inventory built around a single game. It also raises the obvious question: can fans stay locked in on the Super Bowl for an entire year without burning out on the branding?The campaign officially kicked off with “The Handoff,” a made-for-TV bridge from this year’s Super Bowl to next year’s. Chris Berman appeared from Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, the site of Super Bowl 60, and passed coverage to Scott Van Pelt at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, where Super Bowl 61 will be played.ESPN then turned the moment into a 24-hour activation. Shows like “SportsCenter,” “Super Bowl Live,” “First Take” and “NFL Live” moved to Disneyland Park in Anaheim, tying NFL coverage directly to Disney’s theme-park machine.“With the full strength of The Walt Disney Company and in collaboration with the NFL, ESPN has embarked on a year-long Super Bowl celebration,” ESPN chairman Jimmy Pitaro said.“This fan-focused initiative unites our Company’s beloved brands with industry-leading storytelling and technology to showcase football’s greatest stories, heroes, and moments like never before.”Content is the backbone of the plan. ESPN has launched “I Scored a Touchdown,” a weekly short-form series that will highlight 61 players who have scored in the Super Bowl before the 2027 game kicks off. Former New York Giants wide receiver David Tyree, remembered for his helmet catch in Super Bowl XLII, led things off.There is also “The Biggest Game,” a weekly video podcast hosted by Jeremy Schaap. The show looks back at six decades of Super Bowl moments, from on-field performances to halftime shows and the off-field storylines that usually spill into the news cycle. The first episode features Berman, who has covered 44 straight Super Bowls.To sell the scale of the project beyond hardcore NFL fans, Disney and ESPN built a separate marketing play: “We’re Going.” The spot reimagines the “I’m going to Disney World” line that Super Bowl champions made famous, this time packing in Disney characters, ESPN faces and ABC personalities all heading to Super Bowl 61.“Few phrases are as instantly recognizable in sports as ‘I’m going to Disney World,’” Asad Ayaz, chief marketing and brand officer of The Walt Disney Co., said. “This campaign brings together the scale of ESPN, the global power of Disney’s brands and characters, and the excitement of the Super Bowl to create a shared moment that signals just how big this milestone is for our company and fans.”“‘We’re Going’” sits on top of a bigger ad play. Disney Advertising plans cross-platform opportunities across ESPN, ABC and other company properties, giving brands a shot at tying into the Super Bowl build-up months before kickoff instead of fighting for 30 seconds in the game.“‘We’re Going’ is just the beginning of a year-long adventure to our first Super Bowl,” Tina Thornton, ESPN’s executive vice president of creative studio and marketing, said. “It sets the tone for how we’re approaching Super Bowl LXI, by bringing together the storytelling power of Disney with the scale, voice, and passion of ESPN.”Over the 2026-27 NFL season, fans can expect more programming, in-park events and NFL tentpole integrations around the draft and Monday Night Football. ESPN, Disney and the NFL are betting that “The Year of the Super Bowl” can keep fans engaged for 12 months and still have something left for kickoff in Los Angeles.","ESPN, Disney and the NFL are using “The Year of the Super Bowl” to stretch one game into a 12-month content and marketing machine.

Matt Weston and Alex Howard-Jones plan their wedding after Milano Cortina Winter Olympics 2026



British skeleton racer Matt Weston is on the verge of winning Great Britain’s first medal of the 2026 Winter Olympics. The 28-year-old has made a strong start in Milano Cortina and leads the standings after the opening two runs. He holds a 0.30-second advantage heading into the final runs on Friday evening. Expectations were high because he arrived as the reigning world, European and overall World Cup champion, and he has so far matched the hype.Away from the ice track, Weston is also enjoying a big year in his personal life. He is engaged to his long-time partner Alex Howard-Jones, and the couple plan to marry in July after the Games. Their relationship has been visible on social media for years, with photos together dating back to 2016. They also share their home with a ten-year-old cocker spaniel named Logan.While Matt Weston chases Milano Cortina Winter Olympics 2026 success, his fiancée Alex Howard-Jones has built her own career. She is a chief operating officer (COO) and a founding member of pltfrm search, an executive search firm based in London. Reportedly, the couple plans to celebrate their wedding just months after the conclusion of the Winter Olympics, meaning 2026 could become the biggest year of Weston’s life both professionally and personally.Notably, Matt Weston did not begin his sporting journey in skeleton racing. He first played rugby and later trained in taekwondo. Many people expected that he would become one of Britain’s top winter athletes. He only started skeleton racing in the summer of 2017 and made his World Cup debut in January 2020.His rise was quick. In 2021, Weston won a World Cup gold medal. It was the first time a British man had done so in more than 13 years. He then became Britain’s first skeleton world champion in eight years in 2023. The last British champion before that was Lizzie Yarnold back in 2015, while Kristan Bromley was the last British male champion in 2008.Last season proved his most successful yet. Weston secured back-to-back overall World Cup titles and also reclaimed his world championship. That form made him one of the favourites for the Milano-Cortina Games.","Matt Weston is on the verge of winning Great Britain's first medal of the 2026 Winter Olympics.

Where Chloe Kim sits now in snowboarding history

On a snowy night in Livigno, Italy, Chloe Kim led the women’s halfpipe final after an 88.00 opener, then watched 17 year old Gaon Choi snatch gold with a 90.25 on her last run. Kim fell on her own final attempt and settled for silver at the 2026 Winter Olympics.This was the shot at a once in a lifetime headline: the first three straight Olympic golds in any snowboarding event. Instead, Kim walks away with three Olympic medals total, two gold and one silver, and remains the only woman with back to back halfpipe titles while Shaun White still stands as the only rider with three golds overall.A month before Milan Cortina, Kim tore the labrum in her left shoulder during training in Switzerland and admitted she was unsure she would even make it to the Games.She still qualified first, then played it safe on her opening run in Livigno, banking that 88.00 while other riders slammed in heavy snow. Choi crashed hard in her first run, needed treatment in the pipe, then came back to land the run of the night and grab gold on her third attempt.Kim had a choice on that last drop: repeat the cleaner, safer first run or throw the hardest combo on her sheet, including the cab double 1080 that has defined her progression.She chose violence. She caught the wall, slid out, and the three peat vanished.Even then, she refused to mope. “In my eyes, I’m a winner, because I was able to persevere and fight through,” she told reporters, per Time. On the way down the hill she walked hand in hand with boyfriend Myles Garrett of the Cleveland Browns, who called watching her ride “exciting but terrifying.”She is expected to undergo shoulder surgery once she is back in the United States.Kim did not arrive in PyeongChang as a mystery. She already had X Games golds and had become the first woman to land back to back 1080s in competition.At 17, she turned that hype into something concrete, winning women’s halfpipe gold with a 93.75, then nearly touching perfection with a 98.25 on her final run. She became the youngest woman to win Olympic snowboarding gold and the youngest to land two 1080s in a row at the Games, jumping past Kelly Clark’s age record in the process.Four years later in Beijing, Kim arrived with fame, pressure, and time away from the sport behind her. She qualified first, then ended the final early with a 94.00 on her opening run in Genting Snow Park.Her last two attempts turned into lab experiments. She tried new tricks, fell both times, and still won by a margin that made everyone else look like they were fighting for silver. That result made her the first woman ever to win back to back Olympic halfpipe golds.There is still no true three peat in Olympic snowboarding. Kim’s silver joins failed bids this week from Ester Ledecka in parallel giant slalom and Anna Gasser in big air, both of whom also saw their runs at a third straight gold shut down in Milan Cortina.Kim’s resume is already in rare air: three Olympic medals, eight X Games golds and a stack of world titles, plus progression tricks like the double cork 1080 and a historic 1260 that moved the entire field’s ceiling.So yes, the golden three peat story died in the Italian snow. But the bigger picture is ugly for everyone else: even on a torn shoulder, even on a night when a teenager finally beat her, the bar in this sport still has Kim’s name on it.","Chloe Kim fell on her final run in the women’s halfpipe final in Milan Cortina, Italy.

‘Terrifying’ Olympic Ski Star Lindsey Vonn’s Crash Seen In Shocking Photos

Johannes Høsflot Klæbo moves level with Winter Olympics legends after dominant 10km freestyle victory

Norway’s Johannes Høsflot Klæbo added another huge moment to his already legendary career after winning the men’s 10km freestyle race at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milano-Cortina. The victory gave him his eighth Olympic gold medal, tying the all-time Winter Olympics record. Klæbo finished 4.9 seconds ahead of France’s Mathis Desloges, showing once again why he is one of the biggest stars in cross-country skiing right now.It was also his third gold medal at these Games, making him one of the standout athletes of the tournament so far. His win quickly became one of the most talked-about moments of the day. Fans have watched him dominate event after event, and many now wonder if he will go on to break the record before these Olympics end. With more races still ahead, the Norwegian skier has a real chance to make even more history in Milan.Johannes Høsflot Klæbo’s latest win added another chapter to a career that has already been packed with success.Before Milano-Cortina, he had won gold medals at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang and again at the 2022 Games in Beijing.His titles include victories in the individual sprint, team sprint, and relay events, making him one of the most complete skiers in the sport.Now tied on eight gold medals with Norwegian greats Bjørn Dæhlie, Marit Bjørgen, and Ole Einar Bjørndalen, Klæbo has placed himself among the biggest names in Winter Olympics history.More importantly, he still has three races left at these Games: the relay, team sprint, and 50km mass start, meaning the record could soon belong to him alone.Klæbo’s performances have also caught the attention of fans beyond the skiing world. A video of his uphill sprint from earlier in the Games went viral online, gaining over 15 million views on X.American skier Ben Ogden, who finished behind him in the sprint race, summed up the challenge of racing against the Norwegian by saying, “I like to go to every race thinking that it’s a race for the win, but these days, a lot of the time it’s a race for second.”With the final week of competition still ahead, all eyes are now on Klæbo to see how much further he can push his Olympic legacy.","Johannes Høsflot Klæbo won the men's 10km freestyle race at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milano-Cortina.

Slovakia will be facing Sweden in its last preliminary fixture



Slovakia is making believers out of everyone in Milan. After shocking the hockey world with a 4-1 dismantling of defending Olympic champion Finland in their opener, Slovakia held off a spirited Italian side 3-2 at Rho Arena on Friday to remain perfect in Group B.It was not the blowout many expected, but captain Tomas Tatar and his teammates found a way to secure the victory. Italy, playing in front of a passionate home crowd, refused to go quietly against Slovakia; they pushed even harder in today’s game.Slovakia has been the biggest dark horse so far. Despite lacking any of the firepower of the “Big 4 Nations,” they have thrilled fans and critics alike. Meanwhile, the hosts had already proven against Sweden that they could compete with elite competition, trailing just 2-2 in the second period before eventually falling 5-2.The 35-year-old Tatar, who spent 14 NHL seasons with six different teams, has been instrumental in Slovakia's success. He recorded 496 points across 927 regular-season games at the highest level before returning to Europe this season with Zug in Switzerland's National League.His leadership on Slovakia's top line alongside Juraj Slafkovsky and Adam Ruzicka has given the Slovaks one of the tournament's most dangerous units.Slafkovsky, the 2022 Olympic MVP, already has nine career Olympic goals at just 21 years old, trailing only Marian Hossa and Miroslav Satan on Slovakia's all-time list.Despite the loss, Italy has earned respect throughout the tournament. With zero NHL experience on their roster, they have competed hard against Sweden and Slovakia, two teams loaded with professional talent.The host nation has shown they belong at this level, even if the results have not gone their way. Their supporters at Rho Arena created an electric atmosphere that nearly willed them to an upset. Slovakia sits atop Group B at 2-0-0-0 following their narrow victory.Finland has already bounced back from their opening loss with a 4-1 win over Sweden in Friday's other Group B action, leaving the group wide open heading into the final round of preliminary games. Sweden falls to 1-0-0-1, while Italy remains winless at 0-0-0-2.Slovakia faces Sweden on Saturday in a battle for Group B supremacy.

Influencer Clavicular and the Arizona State University fashion show that sparked the framemogging trend

The phrase “Clavicular Framemogging” suddenly took over social media this week. People saw it, paused, and read it again. It sounded confusing. Some even thought it was a medical term. But it is not. It is an internet joke that grew very fast after a viral video from Arizona State University. The trend began when an influencer known as Clavicular appeared at a fashion show at Arizona State University, often called ASU. A short clip from the event started spreading online.In the video, Clavicular is seen standing beside a much larger fraternity member. Viewers quickly began using the phrase “Clavicular was brutally framemogged” to describe what they saw. Within hours, the phrase turned into memes, reaction posts, and debates across social media platforms. Many users were confused at first, then they joined in and that is how the trend exploded.To understand the moment, it helps to know who Clavicular is. He is a niche influencer connected to online looks-focused communities. His content talks about posture, bone structure, shoulder width, and facial balance. He often breaks down how physical proportions affect appearance.The word “mogging” comes from online slang. It means someone visually overpowers another person. “Framemogging” focuses only on body frame, not clothes or face. It is about shoulders, build, and overall outline.During the Arizona State University fashion show livestream, Clavicular was standing next to a fraternity member with a broader build. Viewers noticed the clear difference in size and frame. Soon after, clips were reposted with captions saying, “Clavicular got framemogged.”The irony made people react even more. Clavicular’s content often studies body structure. In this clip, viewers felt he was outmatched in the very area he talks about. That contrast is what made the phrase funny to many users.Another reason the trend grew so quickly is the name itself. “Clavicular Framemogging” sounds dramatic and complex. Internet culture often turns strange, very specific words into viral jokes. Once a few big meme pages shared it, the phrase spread widely.There is no official medical or scientific meaning behind it. It is simply internet slang born from a viral moment at Arizona State University. Still, the influencer’s fashion show debut gave the phrase a face, a setting, and a story. That helped it move from confusion to full trend in less than a day. In the end, the trend shows how fast online language changes. A short campus clip turned into a catchphrase that thousands of people repeated within hours.",The phrase “Clavicular Framemogging” suddenly took over social media this week.

Jannik Sinner applauds Federica Brignone’s comeback as Italian skier wins Super-G gold at Milano-Cortina Winter Olympics

Italian tennis star Jannik Sinner shared heartfelt words for fellow Italian athlete Federica Brignone after her inspiring gold medal win at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milano-Cortina. Brignone, who suffered a serious leg injury less than a year ago, returned to competition and claimed gold in the Super-G event. Her victory quickly became one of the biggest stories of the Games, not just because of the medal, but because of the difficult journey she went through to get back on the slopes.The 35-year-old skier had broken her left leg during the Italian championships and needed two major surgeries. Many people believed she might miss the Olympics completely. Instead, she returned in remarkable fashion and even set a new milestone by becoming the oldest Alpine skier to win Olympic gold. After the race, Sinner openly admired her determination and praised her effort in a moving reaction.Jannik Sinner spoke about Brignone’s achievement in an interview with La Gazzetta dello Sport, calling her comeback extraordinary.He said, “She’s a phenomenon. After everything she’s been through, being able to come back and achieve this result is something extraordinary.”Sinner had earlier spoken about how difficult injury recovery can be, especially in a sport like skiing. During the Australian Open, he explained that skiing carries huge risks and long recovery periods.He said, “Skiing and tennis are totally different sports because on the slopes, if you get hurt during the season, you’re out all year. It’s a really dangerous sport; when you step out of the gate, you have to be brave.”He also praised Brignone’s hard work behind the scenes, adding, “What Federica has done… to be able to experience the Olympics is incredible… she’s done something incredible that almost no one can do.”While Brignone celebrates her historic win, Sinner is now turning his attention back to tennis. The Italian started his 2026 season at the Australian Open but lost in the semifinals to Novak Djokovic.He is expected to return to action at the Qatar Open in Doha, where rival Carlos Alcaraz is also set to compete. Djokovic, however, has withdrawn from the tournament.Brignone’s victory and Sinner’s reaction have brought together two major Italian sports stories, showing how athletes from different fields often inspire each other during big moments like the Winter Olympics.",Federica Brignone won gold in the Super-G event at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milano-Cortina.

According to TSN, Auston Matthews has scored more goals than any other player since he entered the NHL. But the goal he scored on Thursday night felt very different.The team initially faced certain hiccups in their opening match, with two apparent goals overturned in the first period after successful challenges by the Latvian bench.

Chris Paul’s rise from rookie of the year to perennial All-Star

Chris Paul's retirement marks the end of a historic statistical legacy

Chris Paul, one of the best and most respected point guards in NBA history, has officially called it quits after 21 seasons in the NBA. Confirming the end of his storied career, the 40-year-old made the announcement in an emotional statement. Paul embodied elite leadership, precise playmaking, and fierce competitiveness over the next two-plus decades, cementing a legacy as one of the greatest floor generals in the history of the sport.Paul has been a consistent Hall of Fame-level talent since back when he was a teenage legend. The retirement closes the book on a career that spanned three eras of the NBA and signals the end of one of the most impactful careers the league has seen.Chris Paul was the fourth overall pick in the 2005 NBA Draft, selected by the then-New Orleans Hornets; he quickly became a franchise player. Winning the NBA Rookie of the Year award in 2006, he was soon distinguished by his nearly unparalleled awareness on the court, his ball handling, and his defensive acumen.During his career, Paul was named to 12 NBA All-Star selections, received 11 All-NBA honors, and nine consecutive All-Defensive Team nods.His leadership made several franchises better, and most famously, he led the Los Angeles Clippers to heights they had never reached before, guiding the “Lob City” era and making the team a regular playoff team.Aside from his stint with the Clippers, Paul played a pivotal role for the Houston Rockets, Oklahoma City Thunder, Phoenix Suns, Golden State Warriors, and San Antonio Spurs. He took the Suns to the 2021 NBA Finals, two wins short of clinching the elusive title that eluded him during his Phoenix playing days.Chris Paul's retirement was swift, but it ended a career filled with records and consistent greatness. He's 2nd all-time assists and steals 2nd respectively, arguing his position as the greatest playmaker and best perimeter defender of all-time. Reinforcing his blend of scoring and distribution, Paul has scored more than 20,000 points while recording over 10,000 assists.Paul should have a room full of those fine letters, but no NBA title ever be displayed, crowning his résumé. He was president of the National Basketball Players Association, a trusty mentor to younger stars, and an embodiment of professionalism and basketball smarts.","Chris Paul has announced his retirement after 21 seasons in the NBA.

Kyle Busch is one of the top-performing and most successful drivers in the history of NASCAR. His longstanding career as a driver and so-called ""sponsorship deals"" have helped him create a considerable amount of wealth through many years of continuing success in racing and on-track performance. In addition to Kyle's accomplishments, Samantha Busch has contributed significantly as an entrepreneur and celebrity into creating the Busch family wealth.Kyle Busch is a two-time NASCAR Cup Series champion and one of the sport’s highest-paid drivers. Reports in late 2025 estimated he earned about $16.9 million in a year, placing him among the top earners in NASCAR. In strong seasons, he typically makes $15 million to $20 million from salary, race prizes, and endorsements.During his full career, Busch has earned around $100 million from race winnings and nearly the same amount from sponsorships and brand deals. A major financial move also came when he sold Kyle Busch Motorsports, adding to his overall wealth.Samantha Busch is known as an entrepreneur, author, and philanthropist. While the reported $80 million net worth mainly reflects Kyle Busch’s racing income, Samantha’s business projects and public work add to the family’s total financial stability, according to the Celebrity Net Worth.Her involvement in charity work and awareness programs has also made the Busch family well known beyond racing.Kyle Thomas Busch was born May 2, 1985 in Las Vegas, Nevada, where he learned to drive at age 6.

Team Canada will play without two key players as they are all set to lock horns against Team Switzerland in their upcoming men's ice hockey action at the 2026 Winter Olympics, scheduled for Friday. The news has been confirmed recently by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) ahead of their clash against the opponent team.The decision came as Josh Morrissey sustained an undisclosed injury recently during Canada’s opening match against Czechia.

At present, the status of Morrissey’s injury is unclear, but if he is unable to return, his roster spot will be difficult to replace after Canada officially registered 25 players on February 10.Announcing the same on X/Twitter, Steven Ellis stated, “Both Brad Marchand and Josh Morrissey are listed as scratches for Canada today against Switzerland. Jordan Binnington also went dress. #Olympics.”As per reports, in place of these players, Carolina’s Seth Jarvis will make his Olympic debut. He will play alongside Bo Horvat and Sam Reinhart on Canada’s third line. The other three forward lines will remain untouched, with Sam Bennett serving as the 13th forward.

Almost a year after JPMorgan made 5 days work from office compulsory and CEO Jamie Dimon said don't tell JPMorgan what to do at Townhall; some employees fear petition that they call ‘career ...',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/almost-a-year-after-jpmorgan-made-5-days-work-from-office-compulsory-and-ceo-jamie-dimon-said-dont-tell-jpmorgan-what-to-do-at-townhall-some-employees-fear-petition-that-they-call-career-suicide/articleshow/128211254.cms,"When Jamie Dimon's angry outburst at Townhall went viral

In March 2026, it will be a year since America's biggest bank made 5-day work from office compulsory. The largest US bank, which employs more than 300,000 people globally, told all of its employees to return to the office five days a week starting in March, ending a hybrid work-from-home policy that took effect during the pandemic. Just days after CEO Jamie Dimon's order to all employees to come into the office five days a week, a petition surfaced. The petition, which was part of complaints over JP Morgan's call to bring employees back to office 5 days a week, asked CEO Dimon to reverse the change. The petition that continues to be live online is addressed to chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon. In the petition, employees have complained about losing hybrid working arrangements. ""Some employees sought advice from the Communications Workers of America on how they might set up a labor union, a rare thing in the US finance sector.And now a year since the petition was set up, it has about 2,000 signatories out of the Bank's more than 300,000 global employees. According to a report in Financial Times, there are some who believe that signing the petition will be a ‘career suicide’. The report details internal backlash to the 5-day mandate.As per the report, employees at the America's largest lender told the Financial Times they were bewildered by management’s insistence on a full-time return to company offices, though teams are scattered across the globe. “My team is spread out through two continents and three time zones,” said a JPMorgan employee who signed a petition to bring back hybrid work. “JPMorgan is a global company — why can’t that include my home office?” “Hybrid is working and employees love the happy medium,” the staffer told the FT. ""We, the workers of JPMorganChase (JPMC), are concerned about the future of our workplace - its integrity, employee satisfaction, and the increasing toxicity that has metastasized in our company culture in the last couple of months,"" reads the petition.Dimon announced the five-day return to office policy on January 10, 2025, ahead of a March 2025 start date. Soon after announcing the change, Dimon went viral for angry outburst he had about the employee petition during a Town Hall meeting. When asked about the in-person work policy during the staff meeting, he said, ""Don't waste time on it. I don't care how many people sign that fucking petition,"" he said, drawing some laughter. Instead, Dimon demanded more efficiency and stressed employees have a choice whether to work at JPMorgan. The CEO told them not to be mad at him, and said it was a free country.Dimon, who has run the lender for 19 years, said some staff did not pay attention during Zoom meetings, which reduced their efficiency and creativity. In-office requirements will not be left up to managers, Dimon said. ""There is no chance that I will leave it up to managers,"" he said. ""Zero chance. The abuse that took place is extraordinary.""In an interview to CNBC, Dimon said, that he respects employees who don't want to come into the office five days a week, but said the policy will not change because it is best for clients and the company. ""I am not against working from home, I am against where it doesn't work,"" he said, adding that 10% of the bank's jobs are done remotely.Later in the year, in an interview to Bloomberg, Dimon said that he also understands the appeal of logging in from home; remote work can pan out well for some companies and certain roles. Talking about his angry response to a question on work from home, he said, “I gave a very detailed answer about why [work from home] doesn’t work for young people, why it doesn’t work for management, why it doesn’t work for innovation,” Dimon said. “I completely applaud your right to not want to go to the office every day. But you’re not going to tell JPMorgan what to do.”","JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon ordered all employees to return to the office five days a week starting in March 2025.

Stefanos Tsitsipas recalls Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal bond during 2019 Laver Cup and how it shaped him



Stefanos Tsitsipas gave fans a story they had never heard before. Speaking on the What’s The Call? podcast with his former girlfriend Theodora Petalas and co-host Andrea, the Greek star opened up about a night with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal that changed something small but personal in his life. He said it was the first time he ever drank alcohol. And yes, it happened during a Laver Cup week. Stefanos Tsitsipas did not hold back. He explained how Federer gently pushed him to try a drink. “I got drunk for the first time with Rafa and Roger [at the Laver Cup].That was the very first time I ever drank alcohol in my life. I had no idea what to order. I had never tried anything in my life. Roger is like, ‘Come on, you’ve got to have a drink,’ and I am like, ‘Ok, if Roger says I have got to have a drink, I have got to have a drink.’” Then he shared how he sees both legends off the court. “Rafa is a bit of an introvert; he is not going to talk like Roger does. Roger is a very confident guy. He will come to you, talk to you, ask you silly questions. He is a kid, Roger is a kid, in a good way. I like Roger being this way.” That night, he said, was full of laughter. He and Dominic Thiem were dancing and singing on tables. For Tsitsipas, it felt less like rivals and more like teammates.The night he described happened during the 2019 Laver Cup in Geneva. That year, Tsitsipas played doubles with Rafael Nadal in one match and with Roger Federer in another. He lost both matches in three sets, but Team Europe still lifted the trophy.Later, Tsitsipas told the Laver Cup website that the event brought him closer to his idols. “It brought me closer to my heroes. It brought me closer to their personalities and what they feel like in real life. I was able to admire them in a different way, on a different scale than I was before. And getting to meet them, getting to talk to them in a way that I do not usually do when I am on the regular tour. It brought a lot of emotions and a lot of great memories. ”Right now, Tsitsipas is ranked World No. 32. His 2026 season has not started smoothly. He lost early in Adelaide. At the Australian Open and at the ATP 500 event in Rotterdam, he won one match but could not go further. Even so, moments like the Laver Cup remind him why he loves the sport. For him, tennis is not only about winning. Sometimes, it is about shared memories with legends like Federer and Nadal.","Stefanos Tsitsipas opened up about a night with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal.

Olympic hockey captivates Dallas Stars fans as USA, Canada and Finland give must-see performances



Canada dominates with shutout in Olympic opener

Although Dallas Stars fans may be in their second week without NHL action, the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics games are ensuring that hockey fans are not left out. The fact that the men’s and ladies’ games are on, with some Dallas Stars players featuring in these games, ensures that Olympic action is the new alternative to NHL action for Stars fans.With Team USA’s dominance, along with Canada’s loaded roster and some surprising results for countries in the bracket early on, the Olympic tournament has provided no shortage of storylines and even some intra-club flair with Dallas players representing different countries.The men’s tournament has been intriguing. Finland entered the tournament as the defending Olympic gold medalists, but they fell in a major early upset to Slovakia. In the meantime, Canada started their tournament dominantly, dispatching Czechia 5-0, with Stars defenseman Thomas Harley recording two assists. Canada has a potent roster, highlighted by generational talents Connor McDavid and Nathan MacKinnon, a duo that speaks to the danger of the overall team.Meanwhile, in the women's tournament, the United States and Canada again appear to be the top teams favored to win. The United States blew through the preliminary games undefeated, scoring five goals in every game, giving up only one goal in the six games, including a shutout against Canada. Veteran forward Hilary Knight tied the United States Olympic Games point record at 32 points and may do it again during the medal games, creating another historic narrative.Team USA bounced back from a chaotic first period of play against Latvia, during which the Latvians had two goals called back, to post a convincing 5-1 win. Against the Latvians, the Stars' goalkeepers, including Stars goaltender Jake Oettinger, could see action in the team's upcoming games with Denmark and Germany. Even the Dallas fans were treated to an apparent near-scrap between teammates Radek Faksa and Harley during international play.The Dallas Stars begin NHL play on Feb. 25 with a six-game winning streak, but until then, Olympic hockey represents the ideal substitute—perhaps with the bonus of bragging rights for Stars players returning home with medals.","Olympic hockey captivates Dallas Stars fans as USA, Canada and Finland give must-see performances.

Sean Strickland questions division momentum and potential matchup



Former UFC middleweight champion Sean Strickland has criticized Khamzat Chimaev for what he calls long stretches of inactivity in the 185-pound division. Strickland believes the division’s momentum has slowed because top contenders are not fighting often enough. He argued that a championship scene depends on regular bouts and clear movement in the rankings, and that gaps between fights have made the title picture less exciting for both fighters and fans.Strickland also suggested the current situation affects the value of competing for the belt. According to him, the uncertainty around when top contenders fight makes it harder for athletes to plan their careers. Chimaev is widely regarded as one of the division’s most dangerous fighters, but injuries and delays have kept him from competing consistently. Strickland believes this lack of activity has reduced urgency around the championship and changed how fighters view title opportunities.Sean Strickland stated that the limited appearances of Khamzat Chimaev have weakened the division’s competitive structure. He claimed a top contender who competes only once a year slows rankings and creates confusion about who deserves a title shot. He also said fighters may now see regular bouts as more profitable than waiting for a championship opportunity.Speaking in a recent interview with ESPN MMA, Strickland said, “You brought a guy in that fights once a year… He’s just gonna sit on that f*** belt and wait until they force him to fight.” He added, “You would make more money not fighting for the belt than you would fighting for the belt. The belt is not even in my brain anymore. I’ll make significantly more money just fighting. Every time this f*** guy fights, he has a mysterious injury. ”He also spoke about a potential fight, expressing confidence in his abilities and suggesting he could defeat Chimaev. “That’d be a big fight. I think I’m probably the only one that could beat Chimaev. I honestly think Fluffy is a better wrestler than Chimaev. Over five rounds, Fluffy is a better wrestler than Chimaev.“ He further questioned Chimaev’s position, stating, “It’s kind of weird what the UFC did with Chimaev. You brought a guy that fights once a year - the guy doesn’t need to fight. He’s best friends with a warlord”, he added.Strickland believes frequent competition from elite fighters is necessary to maintain credibility and fan interest in the UFC middleweight division.",Former UFC middleweight champion Sean Strickland has criticized Khamzat Chimaev for what he calls long stretches of inactivity in the 185-pound division.

I said at the toss, we saw it in 2023 with a few defeats and injuries. We have a few guys here who were there in India in 2023 and we'll look to navigate this situation and use that blueprint.""Head explained that the decision to field first was influenced by the nature of the pitch, which he believed would play consistently across both innings. He felt the target was within reach.""We thought it's a good wicket. A bit tacky at the start and we thought it would be even through the two innings. Even though we only took two wickets, I thought they were a bit under par.""But we lost early wickets and came under pressure. They played well. I still felt like we'd have taken the score and were happy to chase that.""The feedback throughout was that it was a good wicket. We put ourselves under pressure by losing wickets.We found a partnership in the middle but we left ourselves with too many.""Australia’s campaign has also been impacted by injuries. Mitchell Marsh remains unavailable with a groin problem, while Tim David recently returned from a hamstring strain.Their pace resources are stretched as well, with Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood missing — marking the first time since 2011 that Australia are competing at a World Cup without Cummins, Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc together.","Zimbabwe beat Australia by 23 runs in Group B of ICC Men's T20 World Cup.

T20 World Cup | Tilak Varma provides update on Abhishek's fitness, mindset during rehab

Teams:

NEW DELHI: India’s star opener Abhishek Sharma missed the T20 World Cup clash against Namibia on Thursday and could also be sidelined for the much-anticipated encounter against arch-rivals Pakistan on Sunday at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo.After India were put in to bat by Namibia at the Arun Jaitley Stadium, captain Suryakumar Yadav provided an update on the left-hander’s fitness at the toss.“Abhishek is still not fine, he will miss a game or two,” Suryakumar said.Following Thursday’s match against Namibia, India are scheduled to take on Pakistan on Sunday.Abhishek was discharged after spending two days in hospital with a stomach infection, which had left him doubtful for the contest. The uncertainty surrounding his availability became clear when Suryakumar walked out for the toss and confirmed the update.“We were looking to bat first. Very happy with it. As long as we are losing the toss and winning the game, we are fine with it. Dew is going to be a big factor, but when you go out and defend totals, it gives you confidence,” Suryakumar said during the toss.“Sanju comes in, similar batter, explosive.Bumrah comes in for Siraj,” he added.Abhishek was dismissed for a duck in India’s opening match against the USA in Mumbai on Saturday and took no further part in the game, with Sanju Samson replacing him in the field.The opener had been unwell during that match, and his condition worsened after the team arrived in Delhi.India (Playing XI): Sanju Samson, Ishan Kishan(w), Tilak Varma, Suryakumar Yadav(c), Hardik Pandya, Shivam Dube, Rinku Singh, Axar Patel, Arshdeep Singh, Varun Chakaravarthy, Jasprit BumrahNamibia (Playing XI): Louren Steenkamp, Jan Frylinck, Jan Nicol Loftie-Eaton, Gerhard Erasmus(c), JJ Smit, Zane Green(w), Ruben Trumpelmann, Malan Kruger, Bernard Scholtz, Ben Shikongo, Max Heingo",India's star opener Abhishek Sharma missed the T20 World Cup clash against Namibia.

Stefon Diggs vs. Cardi B: Everything We Know About the Post-Super Bowl Split



The Super Bowl may be over but the real drama for New England Patriots star Stefon Diggs is just beginning. Following a tough loss to the Seattle Seahawks on February 11, 2026, Diggs dropped a bomb on Instagram: a long, cryptic post that has everyone buzzing about his relationship with Cardi B Diggs’ 20-slide carousel was packed with deep quotes and personal photos. His caption spoke volumes: ""Gratitude and fear cannot coexist in the same space... a reminder to control what you can control, remain thankful, and stay motivated.""Slides like ""The best way to appreciate something is to be without it for a while"" only added to the mystery. He even turned off comments, a move that screamed, ""I’m trying to avoid the noise.""But it wasn’t just the words. The post hit right after Diggs and Cardi B reportedly unfollowed each other on Instagram. This online split sent fans into a frenzy, convinced that the power couple was done. And while a viral screenshot of them supposedly trading insults was fake, the tension was very real.Then came the real kicker: buried in those slides were photos of Diggs with Baby Snoop, his son with K’yanna Barber. This wasn't a small detail.K’yanna had been spotted at the Super Bowl itself, cheering on Diggs with Baby Snoop in a tiny Patriots jersey, while Cardi B was busy performing at halftime. The timing of Diggs featuring K'yanna's son in his ""post-loss statement"" felt like a direct message.This move felt especially loaded because of Diggs' complicated family life. In 2025 alone, he reportedly had four children with four different women, including a son with Cardi B, nicknamed ""Baby Brim."" Now, with six children, his family dynamics are under a microscope.Many are seeing the inclusion of Baby Snoop as a significant factor in the rumored split. Rumors suggested Cardi B had given Diggs a ""one more mistake and I'm out"" warning. Seeing K’yanna so openly supported, both at the game and on his Instagram feed, might have been that final straw.The question now is, what’s next for Stefon Diggs and Cardi B? Their relationship seems to have hit a major roadblock, and Diggs' recent post has done little to calm the storm. If anything, it’s intensified the speculation that this high-profile romance is officially over.","Stefon Diggs and Cardi B reportedly unfollowed each other on Instagram.

When will Team India reach Colombo, update about Abhisek Sharma

NEW DELHI: The stakes could not be higher as the mother of all cricket clashes is set to unfold on Sunday at the iconic R. Premadasa Stadium. When these two arch-rivals lock horns, the cricketing world is expected to come to a standstill. Tickets have long been sold out, anticipation has reached fever pitch, and fans are counting down the hours to what promises to be a blockbuster evening in Colombo. The atmosphere is primed for high drama — roaring stands, frayed tempers, and moments of brilliance under lights.Yet, amid all the excitement, one looming concern threatens to steal the spotlight: rain.Weather forecasts have cast a shadow over the much-anticipated showdown. Atmospheric models indicate that inclement conditions could coincide with the match window.According to projections, Colombo faces a 65 percent chance of scattered thunderstorms during the day on Sunday, with the probability dropping to 25 percent in the evening.Temperatures are expected to hover around 28°C, accompanied by north winds blowing at 9 mph and humidity levels touching 77 percent — conditions that could make for a sticky and challenging contest.Forecasters have also warned of a possible thunderstorm just before the scheduled start time, raising fears of a delayed toss or interruptions during play. For a clash of this magnitude, even a brief stoppage could dramatically alter momentum.Tournament organisers remain hopeful that the weather will hold, but contingency plans are firmly in place.A washout would see both unbeaten sides share points, potentially complicating the qualification race in Group A. Colombo’s experienced groundstaff, known for their swift response and efficient covering of the outfield, are on high alert.However, meteorologists caution that a nearby low-pressure system — which may intensify into a depression next week — makes conditions highly unpredictable. The Department of Meteorology has urged fans and the public to stay attentive to further updates as Sunday approaches.",The mother of all cricket clashes is set to unfold on Sunday at the iconic R.

Stefon Diggs’ cryptic Instagram post during split rumors with Cardi B

Cardi B’s opening night declaration

A lot happened in Stefon Diggs and Cardi B ’s love life over the past 8 months. They hard-launched at NBA courtside. They welcomed a sweet baby boy. She cheered for him from the NFL stands and was his “good luck charm” throughout his season up to Super Bowl LX. He even sparked engagement rumors after the Big Game.Then came her straight-faced “good luck” wish for the final battle. They reportedly unfollowed each other on social media. A source from Entertainment Tonight shared that they are having a temporary split and might get back together. Is it for her current Little Miss Drama Tour? She certainly seems affected by the breakup rumors. Let’s look at both sides one by one and try to understand their respective plights.New England Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs shared 20 snapshots from his post Super Bowl LX loss to the Seattle Seahawks on Feb. 11.He captioned them: “Gratitude and Fear cannot coexist in the same space… a reminder to control what you can control, remain thankful and stay motivated.”The post included quotes that could refer to both his 2025 season and the Grammy-winning rapper: “Luck didn’t bring me this far… God did”and “The best way to appreciate something is to be without it for a while.”Some quotes were clearly about the season: “Do not ignore your own self-doubt. That is the old you reminding you how much you have achieved,” and “It ain’t all good but it ain’t all bad either, so be thankful.”The last photo showed a traffic signal with Diggs’ well-known gridiron quote: “We all we got, we all we need, drive safely.”The Bronx-born musician fought back tears during the opening night of her Little Miss Drama Tour on Feb. 11 at Acrisure Arena in Palm Desert. She paused to share heavy-hearted words: “I do not want to be emotional. Don’t let nobody take your happiness away from you.”AsakyGRN shared a glimpse of this on X. Cybercitizens quickly deduced it was about her split with the NFL star. One user declared, “She’s not lucky with men.”Another said, “She should stay away from men for now.” A third user wrote, “Cardi fighting tears but dropping: “Don’t let nobody take your happiness away from you.” Real queen energy. Protecting her peace on stage amid all the noise.”A fourth user chimed in, “Don’t ever give anyone the liberty to take your happiness away from you.” A fifth user said, “Sometimes the strongest message isn’t in perfect words — it’s in showing up, hurting, but still choosing happiness and resilience.”[Just a speculation] Maybe the temporary break will last until the “Bodak Yellow” singer’s Little Miss Drama Tour is over. Who knows, maybe she doesn’t do well with distractions, even though that was reportedly a motivational factor for Diggs on the gridiron [other than his own inner voice screaming at the top of his lungs, motivating others]. Only time will tell if they ever decide to get back together...",Cardi B and Stefon Diggs reportedly unfollowed each other on social media.

KOZHIKODE: An elderly woman in Kerala has won widespread praise online for standing up against traffic rule violations in Kozhikode. A now-viral Instagram video shows her confronting a scooter rider who attempted to use a footpath to bypass traffic near the Eranjipalam signal.The clip, posted by Instagram user @aflu_stories_, captures the woman firmly blocking the rider’s path as several two-wheelers had encroached onto the pedestrian walkway to avoid congestion on the main road.Despite the rider’s attempt to manoeuvre around her, she stood her ground in the middle of the footpath, refusing to let him pass.At one point, the woman even took out her phone, seemingly recording the rider as he continued to protest.Eventually, the man was forced to stop and move his scooter back onto the road, abandoning his attempt to ride through the pedestrian space.The video was shared with the caption: ""What happened yesterday at Kozhikode Eranjipalam near the traffic signal.. Preventing bike from riding through footpath alone.. Really this will cause a big accident everyone does it’s really bad. And everyone does.. This has to be stopped or stopped.Bikes are tearing through the path where the elderly and children are walking.. Don’t know who is the mother who reacted against this. Big salute less.""Following the incident, social media users have lauded the woman’s actions, calling her courageous and responsible.Many commenters said her intervention serves as a reminder for riders to respect pedestrian spaces, while others expressed hope that more citizens would speak out against dangerous driving practices.The incident has sparked a broader conversation online about road discipline and pedestrian safety in crowded urban areas.One user wrote, ""She was my hostel warden, but she felt like family. I still remember that night me and my friends playing cards at 1 am, laughing like crazy, and suddenly she walked in and scolded me like I had committed a big crime. She was strict, loud, and scary at times but she was also the most caring and loving soul.""Another user wrote, "" A lady her age shouldn’t be fighting for her right to use the side walk but it is a shame that she has to.""""Her smile at the end is not only her victory, it's for whole of us she fought that battle! How I wish I could meet her,"" added another.","A woman in Kozhikode, Kerala, has won widespread praise for standing up against traffic rule violations.

What will be India’s playing XI against Pakistan?

Ireland and Oman clash in Colombo on Saturday in a Group B contest where both teams are chasing their first win of the T20 World Cup 2026. Ireland are still reeling from losses to Australia and Sri Lanka, while Oman are looking to bounce back from heavy defeats to Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka. Beyond points, this clash is a battle for pride and survival.Ireland suffered a major jolt when captain Paul Stirling was ruled out of the tournament after suffering ligament injury. Stirling hurt his right knee when completing a catch during Ireland’s 67-run loss to Australia on Wednesday. Uncapped left-handed opening batsman Sam Topping will replace Stirling in the squad.“Paul will shortly return home for rest and rehabilitation, ahead of the home summer,” said Ireland’s director of high performance, Graeme West. With Stirling’s exit, Ireland must regroup, with the responsibility now falling on Harry Tector and Ross Adair.On the bowling front, George Dockrell has provided some control, but Ireland’s inability to post competitive scores has hurt them.Oman’s challenge has been their fragile batting lineup, dismissed cheaply for 103 and 120 in their two games. Mohammad Nadeem’s gritty half century against Sri Lanka stands out as the lone bright spot.Ireland hold the advantage with four wins in the last six meetings.",Ireland face Oman in a Group B clash in Colombo on Saturday.
