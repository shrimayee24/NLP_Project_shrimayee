NEW DELHI: Navdeep Singh , the Paralympics gold medalist, shared a powerful story of resilience and triumph at the Paris Games. Initially securing a silver medal, Navdeep’s achievement was later upgraded to gold, marking a historic milestone in his athletic career. His remarkable performance in the men's javelin F41 final at the 2024 Paralympic Games brought immense pride to the nation.However, the road to his success was filled with personal challenges, which Navdeep opened up about during an emotional podcast interview.Born with dwarfism, Navdeep endured severe criticism and societal rejection throughout his life. In the podcast, he revealed the hurtful taunts he faced because of his condition. He shared how some people went as far as to suggest that he should consider suicide, dismissing his potential and undermining his worth.“Aapko kya lagta hai hume hausla kaha se aata hai? Jab wo bolte hain ki tu kuch nahi kar sakta. Isse acha to tu suicide kar le. Ye kya jeewan hai tera [Where do you think we get our courage from? When they say you can't do anything.

Har jagah saath they [He was the one who got me started. He was with me every step of the way],” Navdeep said, reflecting on his father's impact, though he is no longer alive to witness his son's ultimate success.","Navdeep Singh won gold in the men's javelin F41 final at the 2024 Paralympic Games.

When 18-year-old Sachin Tendulkar exhibited a batting masterclass at the WACA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/when-18-year-old-sachin-tendulkar-exhibited-a-batting-masterclass-at-the-waca/articleshow/113360102.cms,"NEW DELHI: Indian batting legend Sachin Tendulkar had a remarkable cricketing career in Australia , where he built a reputation as one of the greatest batsmen of all time.Sachin's performances in Australia, particularly against the formidable Australian bowling attack, stand out as some of the most iconic moments in cricket history.When Tendulkar landed in Australia as an 18-year-old in 1991, he already had a reputation of being a batting wonder-kid, who had saved a Test for India against England in Manchester in 1990.And by the time the Indian team reached Perth for the fifth Test of the series, Tendulkar had already given the Australian public glimpses of his marvellous batting genius with a swashbuckling unbeaten 148 in the third Test in Sydney.But what unfolded that day at the WACA Ground on the bounciest pitch in the world at that time, was a batting masterclass against a bowling attack that had the likes of Craig McDermott, Merv Hughes , Paul Reiffel, Mike Whitney and Tom Moody. And that it came from an 18-year-old when only four of his teammates reached double figures in that innings, showcased a very mature head on very young shoulders.Batting after Australia's 346, Tendulkar arrived at the crease with India at 69/2. The Aussies tried to bounce him out, but Tendulkar dug in deep and displayed an array of shots consisting of cuts and pulls, smashing 16 fours to reach his third Test hundred.With India folding up for 272, Tendulkar's was the last wicket to fall. Though India lost the Test by 300 runs, Tendulkar's innings is still regarded as the one of the best knocks played by an overseas batsman in Australia.Tendulkar's rivalry with Australian legends like Shane Warne Glenn McGrath , and Brett Lee is a highlight of his career. Warne once mentioned that bowling to Tendulkar in India was his worst nightmare, especially after Tendulkar's counterattacking innings during the 1998 series.Tendulkar's performances in Australia solidified his place as one of cricket's all-time greats. His ability to dominate the best bowlers on challenging pitches earned him immense respect, even among Australian fans.","Sachin Tendulkar had a remarkable cricketing career in Australia.

He emphasized that, in contrast to the legendary Sachin Tendulkar , Rohit did not exhibit the same level of dedication and intensity during net practice sessions.""I mean he hasn't changed at all. It's so ridiculous. I just picture his walk when he came out to bat and he would have a few throw-downs in the nets or even shadow-hitting, it was just majestic.He didn't practice as hard as Sachin Tendulkar. That's for sure. Maybe he practices away from the nets at times but just his technical ability and I think he doesn't have the best technique,"" Rhodes said in a YouTube podcast titled Aleena Dissects.Rhodes also discussed the factors that have contributed to Rohit's success as a batter, despite not having the most technically sound footwork.""He's being criticised for not having a lot of foot movement, but because he is so relaxed at the crease and those hands flow well. It's been great to see him because he stayed the same, true to himself and I think that's so important,"" he added.The Lucknow Super Giants coach stated that Rohit cannot be compared to Virat Kohli and praised him for staying true to his authentic self.""Because if you're a Virat Kohli and you're in the face of people. that's Virat Kohli. But you can't ask him to do all that, Rohit is taking over from this guy, be like him. If you're true to yourself then you're going to be more consistent in your performance so it's been good to see his journey,"" he further added.Rhodes spoke about Rohit's lighthearted and playful demeanor. His ability to joke around and behave in a fun, ""cheeky"" manner helps to create a relaxed team atmosphere.""Even when playing against him or coaching against him, whether he is at IPL, franchise level or international cricket, you see the same. You know, messes around with the teammates, you can hear some of the stuff in the microphone.""""He's really funny and people don't expect that from Rohit. He's quite the cheeky guy. He's a senior guy but he's behaving like a kid. I think as a captain that takes the pressure away, the mindset you know, the players are not stressed under him,"" he concluded.","Former Mumbai Indians fielding coach Jonty Rhodes reminisced about his earlier experiences with Rohit Sharma during the IPL.

NEW DLHI: Former Pakistan skipper Younis Khan has weighed in on the pressure and expectations surrounding star Babar Azam , urging him to take inspiration from Indian cricketing icon Virat Kohli Younis's comments come as Babar faces scrutiny both on and off the field.""Babar Azam was made the captain because he was the best player at the time,"" Younis said. ""I was there when the decision was made that the team’s best player should be the captain.Our players tend to talk more than they perform.

""Players should use social media wisely, but their real answers should come through their performances with the bat and ball. He (Babar) needs to focus on his fitness and work ethic because opportunities like these don't come around often.""""He has achieved a lot at such a young age, but what he needs to know what he wants to achieve in the future. Captaincy is a small thing, performance is what matters,"" the former batsman added.He continued, drawing a parallel with Kohli: ""Look at Virat Kohli. He chose to step down from captaincy on his own terms, and now he’s breaking records worldwide. This shows that playing for the country should be the priority. If there’s any energy left, then play for yourself.""On the field, Babar has been grappling with a noticeable dip in form.Pakistan's recent loss in a two-Test series against Bangladesh has compounded his struggles.His performances during the series -- scores of 0, 22, 11, and 31 -- have led to his drop from the ICC top 10 rankings for batters for the first time in years.This slump in performance has intensified scrutiny over his leadership in white-ball cricket , especially following Pakistan’s disappointing exit from the group stage of the T20 World Cup 2024 .","Former Pakistan skipper Younis Khan has weighed in on the pressure and expectations surrounding star Babar Azam.

Turning the game: What made Shane Warne the 'King of Spin',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/turning-the-game-what-made-shane-warne-the-king-of-spin/articleshow/113353037.cms,"Shane Warne Gatting Ball of the Century

NEW DELHI: Legendary Shane Warne , known fondly as the ' King of Spin ', wasn't just a cricketer; he was an artist who turned the cricket pitch into his canvas.His journey to becoming the most feared and respected spin bowler of all time began in a suburb of Melbourne, where a young Warne first picked up a cricket ball and discovered his unique talent for making it dance.In the early 1990s, the world of cricket was dominated by fast bowlers. Spin was seen as a dying art, something that could only flourish on slow, turning pitches in the subcontinent.But Warne was about to change all that. With his distinctive blond hair and a swagger that exuded confidence, he made his Test debut for Australia in 1992.His first few matches were unremarkable, but Warne was just getting started.The turning point came in the 1993 Ashes series against England. On a sunny day at Old Trafford, Warne bowled a delivery that would become known as the 'Ball of the Century'.It was Warne's first ball in an Ashes Test, and it pitched outside the leg stump. England's Mike Gatting watched it carefully, expecting it to turn slightly. But as the ball spun fiercely, it defied all expectations, whipping past Gatting's bat and clipping the top of the off stump.Gatting was left in disbelief, and so was the cricketing world. Warne had announced his arrival in spectacular fashion.From that moment, the legend of the 'King of Spin' began to grow.Warne possessed an uncanny ability to outthink batsmen. He could spin the ball prodigiously on any surface, making it drift, dip, and turn in ways that left even the best players baffled.His mastery of the leg break, the googly, and the flipper turned him into a weapon in the Australian arsenal.Warne didn't just rely on his skill; he played mind games with batsmen, setting them up over a series of deliveries before delivering the knockout punch. His showmanship added to his aura—he was a performer who thrived on the big stage, relishing the tension of the moment.By the end of his career, Warne had taken over 700 Test wickets, a record for a spin bowler. But it wasn't just the numbers that made him the King of Spin; it was the magic he brought to the game.Shane Warne redefined spin bowling, making it an art form that captivated millions and solidifying his place as cricket’s greatest spinner.","Shane Warne redefined spin bowling, making it an art form that captivated millions.

Since their genesis in 2014, Blasters have reached the ISL final on three occasions but have not been able to breach the final hurdle.In the recently concluded Durand Cup, Blasters appeared a dominant side, scoring 16 goals from three matches and conceding just one, against their Sunday opponents, Punjab FC, in the group stage.However, the Durand Cup campaign also offered a reality check for Blasters. Despite fielding their key players, they bowed out in the quarterfinals where they lost to Bengaluru FC The new coach doesn’t seem to be too perturbed and is confident that Blasters will play entertaining football. “It’s a huge privilege to be a member of this club. We’ll play good and energetic football, score a lot of goals and win. You will see us give our 100% at every single game,” said Stahre. “They (Blasters’ players) are a very eager group, always ready to put in maximum effort. We have a good mixture of youth and experience and also foreign players. But all of them have a huge drive, they want to improve themselves, and they want to achieve something for this club,” the Swede added.Blasters have done a comprehensive overhaul of their squad, securing the services of several high-profile players during the summer transfer window. On paper, they have assembled a formidable attacking unit featuring new signings Noah Sadaoui and Jesus Jimenez alongside Kwame Peprah and Adrian Luna. The defence too has been fortified with the arrival of seasoned French defender Alexandre Coeff, while Milos Drincic has pledged his allegiance to the club by inking a contract extension. However, the team has also witnessed the departure of several key figures, and the new replacements have a big void to fill.Punjab FC will also take the field under a new head coach in Panagiotis Dilmperis and will look to emulate their stunning 3-1 victory over Blasters here at the same venue last season. Luka Majcen is the only foreign player who has been retained and he will be joined by Ivan Novoselec, Mushaga Bakenga , Ezequiel Vidal, Asmir Suljic, and Filip Mrzljak as the new foreign additions in the squad.

We have a new coaching staff, new foreign and Indian players in our squad and that is the biggest difference. This season we will try to better the performance from last year and qualify for the playoffs,” said coach Dilmperis.Meanwhile, the Blasters wouldn’t enjoy the usual vociferous support from a capacity turnout at JNL stadium for the opener as the club has announced that attendance for Sunday’s game would be limited to 50% due to ‘Thiruvonam’ celebrations in Kerala.",Kerala Blasters begin their Indian Super League campaign against Punjab FC on Sunday.

EPL: Manchester United lift mood by easing to victory at 10-man Southampton,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/epl/top-stories/epl-manchester-united-lift-mood-by-easing-to-victory-at-10-man-southampton/articleshow/113352689.cms,"NEW DELHI: Matthijs de Ligt , Marcus Rashford , and Alejandro Garnacho scored to give Manchester United a 3-0 victory over Southampton on Saturday, providing manager Erik ten Hag with some relief.The game could have taken a different turn if not for Andre Onana's penalty save against Cameron Archer when the score was still 0-0. Southampton had started the match strongly, putting United under pressure.Just before the interval, De Ligt scored his first goal for United, followed by Rashford's first goal in six months, swiftly shifting the momentum in favor of the away team, AFP reported.Southampton's troubles worsened when their captain, Jack Stephens, received a red card in the 79th minute for a reckless tackle on Garnacho. The young forward then sealed the victory for United by scoring in added time.Southampton's Premier League struggles persist as they remain pointless after four matches, while Manchester United's victory propels them to the eighth position in the standings.The Dutch manager faced increased scrutiny following United's disappointing eighth-place finish last season, which led to an internal review of his position in May.United's fortunes took a further hit with consecutive losses against Brighton and Liverpool before the international break, intensifying the pressure on Ten Hag and his team. They had to navigate a challenging start at St. Mary's Stadium.In a tactical decision, Ten Hag opted to bench Casemiro following his subpar performance in the 3-0 defeat against Liverpool. Additionally, new acquisition Manuel Ugarte had to bide his time before making his debut as a second-half substitute.United continued to struggle with controlling the midfield in the opening stages but found a turning point when Onana saved a crucial penalty.Southampton's inability to capitalize on promising build-up play has been a recurring theme in their return to the top flight.Teenager Tyler Dibling impressed on his Premier League debut, using his trickery to draw Diogo Dalot into a reckless challenge inside the box.However, Archer's penalty lacked power, and Onana was able to parry the shot before comfortably catching the striker’s follow-up header.Just two minutes later, United took the lead as De Ligt put a tough week with the Dutch national team behind him by scoring his first goal for the club.Former Bayern Munich centre-back De Ligt was subbed off at halftime by Ronald Koeman after his mistakes led to two German goals in a 2-2 Nations League draw in Amsterdam.De Ligt, who first rose to prominence under Ten Hag at Ajax, was rewarded for his manager’s faith after being selected ahead of Harry Maguire. A short corner caught Southampton off guard, and Bruno Fernandes’ cross found De Ligt, who headed into the bottom corner.Southampton had brought in Aaron Ramsdale from Arsenal on the final day of the transfer window to bolster their survival hopes, and the England goalkeeper helped limit the damage. He made a fine save at his near post to momentarily deny Marcus Rashford’s much-needed goal.However, Rashford’s drought, which stretched back to March, ended in the 41st minute when his curling strike from outside the box found the far corner. Ramsdale also denied De Ligt a second before halftime as United looked poised to dominate.The second half, however, was much calmer, with United comfortably managing the game and keeping Southampton at bay. Frustrations boiled over for the home side when Stephens made an unnecessary lunge on Garnacho, catching him on the knee and earning a straight red card.In stoppage time, Garnacho added to Southampton’s misery with a powerful finish from Dalot's cross, sealing the victory in the 96th minute.","Matthijs de Ligt, Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho scored to give Manchester United a 3-0 victory over Southampton. Southampton captain Jack Stephens received a red card in the 79th minute for a reckless tackle on Garnacho.

Lobera-guided Odisha look for season encore but with a trophy; take on Chennaiyin in Kalinga opener,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/lobera-guided-odisha-look-for-season-encore-but-with-a-trophy-take-on-chennaiyin-in-kalinga-opener/articleshow/113341577.cms,"Kolkata: Having had probably the best season in the club’s history, Odisha FC did everything in their capacity to achieve great heights last season but for a trophy.Under a proven head coach on Indian shores in Sergio Lobera , the club had started off the 2023-24 season with runners-up finish in Super Cup at home, went to the semis of Indian Super League (ISL) for the first time and were beaten by Central Coast Mariners of Australia – the eventual winners – in the 2023-24 AFC Cup inter-zone semifinals playoff.To build on those remarkable achievements, the club has already done a good job by securing the services of the experienced Spanish gaffer apart from retaining their core squad. And now the Juggernauts are ready to roll under a coach who has an enviable record with his former clubs FC Goa and Mumbai City FC . Lobera won the 2019 Super Cup and ISL 2019-20 League Winners’ Shield with Goa before doing a double of winning the 2020-21 ISL trophy and League Winners’ Shield with the Islanders.Silverware with the Kalinga Warriors is surely due in order to match his unmatched feats as an ISL manager, but Lobera said he couldn’t ask more of his wards, who have had a ‘miraculous’ last season.“Last season was amazing, a miraculous season I must say, but that’s in the past, our focus is on the future now. Honestly, I can’t ask for more from my boys, they did remarkably well last season. We didn’t win any trophy but achieved great success for the club. We played in every tournament possible, unfortunately lost the Super Cup final, went to the semis of ISL and then AFC semifinal playoffs – that’s great, probably the best season for the club combining all the tournaments we played in,” Lobera told TOI from Bhubaneswar ahead of their ISL season opener against Chennaiyin FC at home on Saturday.Happy to be at the helm of Odisha FC for the second season running, Lobera was hopeful of adding to the club’s trophy cabinet, which only has the 2023 Super Cup to show now. “It’s first time in Odisha’s history that the same coach is starting the second season in a row. It’s good to continue with a club because when you start the first season you start with a zero. But now I have a group of players who understand my philosophy or what I want as a coach. We have a base from last season to work with and that certainly helps a coach in the second season. We are hopeful of building on that performance of last season,” said the former La Masia coach.Lobera also sounded confident with their pre-season where the reserve team, managed by assistant coaches, was out of the Durand Cup group stage and the first team under Lobera’s tutelage lost the final of Bhausaheb Bandodkar Memorial Trophy to FC Goa in penalty shoot-out.“I always believe that the best part of a season is the pre-season. The first team didn’t play the Durand Cup, so the young players got some valuable match-time there and we lost the final in Goa (Bandodkar Trophy) in penalties, but we scored some good goals, we beat good clubs from Australia (Brisbane Roar) and Argentina (CSD Defensa y Justicia). (Hugo) Boumos scored couple of goals against Brisbane Roar which will give us confidence going into the ISL now,” added Lobera, who assisted Tito Vilanova in 2012 during the latter’s stint as Barcelona manager.With the average age of the squad being 26.5 years, Odisha will see a mix of experienced foreigners alongside the youthful exuberance of the Indians, eight of them being under-22 and a host of 23, 24-year-olds. In the goalkeeping department, Odisha have just secured the services of their former custodian Kamaljit Singh, who will provide a solid backup to captain and first-choice ’keeper Amrinder Singh, along with Anuj Kumar and 21-year-old Niraj Kumar.“I always love to give young players chance to come into the first-team setup. We have eight U-22 players now and there’re many 24-25-26 year olds. I don’t think there’s many clubs in ISL who can say that. The right mix of youth and experience is always helpful to achieve success at any level, but I think that youngsters shouldn’t be put under pressure. They need to be well-prepared before coming into the first team, otherwise if someone is rushed then it can ruin his game. We need to take good care of young players and be patient with them,” explained Lobera.“Amey (Ranawade) was not getting matches before, he played so well for us and now he’s in the national team. Puitea (Lalthathanga Khawlhring) also had a very good last season and is in national reckoning now. Apart from preparing the young players for the club, we are also developing them for the Indian team, and it gives me immense pleasure to help in the growth of Indian football. You need good Indian players in your side to win trophies these days. Earlier when there were 6 foreigners in your team then it would have been possible but now with 4 foreigners (in playing XI) it’s not possible to win trophies with good foreigners alone,” the Spaniard added.However, asked about giving Indian players chance ahead of the big foreign names in key positions like centre-back, central midfield or centre forward, Lobera pointed towards his obligations as a club coach.“See, as the head coach of a club my priority is to win matches and trophies for the club. So, if I have a Roy Krishna or a Diego Mauricio and I feel that he can give me the best possible result then I will field him as the centre forward ahead of an Indian player. Rahim Ali and Isak (Vanlalruatfela) are very good players and both can play as winger or No. 9. We will see what situations demand and will field them accordingly.”Content with the squad at his disposal, still there’s one thing that Lobera will once again be missing this season. And that’s the local connection. Shubham Sarangi was the last and only Odia guy in the squad for four seasons until 2023, but now that he has joined Jamshedpur FC ahead of this season, defender Tankadhar Bag is the only native in the first-team squad, but he is yet to attain the level to get a match in the league.“Local players are very important for any club. I always feel that local boys are naturally much more attached to the club than players from outside, so it’s always good to have quality local players. When the supporters come to the stadium, they want to see some local guys playing, that gives them a natural connect. As the first team coach, I don’t know what’s the situation at the club’s academy or junior level about the local players, but it would be good to have some local guys in the side. Tankadhar is developing as a player and we’ll see how he progresses during the season to assess his chances of coming into playing eleven,” Lobera said.With all bases covered, Lobera’s boys will be eager to script history this season and the Spaniard will be hoping to add another silverware to his collection with the third club he is managing on Indian shores.",Sergio Lobera is back at the helm of Odisha FC for the second season running. The Spanish coach won the 2019 Super Cup and ISL 2019-20 League Winners’ Shield with Goa before doing a double of winning the 2020-21 ISL trophy and League Winners' Shield with the Islanders.

ISL season-11: Honours shared as Mohun Bagan & Mumbai City FC resume rivalry in style,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/isl-season-11-honours-shared-as-mohun-bagan-mumbai-city-fc-resume-rivalry-in-style/articleshow/113340725.cms,"KOLKATA: Just like it was seen last season. Just like it can now be accepted as a benchmark. It may still feel too early but the rivalry between Mohun Bagan SG and Mumbai City is going to shape up the new season — again.If you need proof of that never-ending thirst for twists that defines a big game, if you are constantly reminded of the old adage that nothing is over until it’s over, it was much in evidence at the rain-bathed Salt Lake Stadium on Friday.Reigning ISL Shield winners Mohun Bagan SG and Cup holders Mumbai City FC seemed to have started from where they had left five months ago — no quarters were given and no mercy shown as they ended up sharing the spoils 2-2 in the tournament opener.Jose Molina’s hosts raced to a 2-0 lead inside the opening half an hour thanks to Tiri’s own goal and Alberto Rodriguez ’s strike in 29 minutes. Petr Kratky’s visitors dug in, believing in themselves and finding the target twice in the final 20 minutes. Tiri first reduced the margin in the 69th minute and second-half substitute Thaer Krouma snatched a point for Mumbai with their second goal in the 90th minute.It was a perfect start to a new season of the league. It was just the kind of a reminder that these two teams are about to lead the race for good reason. Creativity is the hallmark of these two teams but all the goals — including the opening one which was an own goal — came more from chaos than coherence.Mumbai went into an attacking mode right from the word go, enjoying possession and Bipin Singh bossing the left flank with his usual pace and potency and had even a goal disallowed for off-side. But having the ball isn’t enough and it’s what you do with it that counts.Such is the wealth of Mohun Bagan’s attacking prowess that if you doze off for a second, disaster will knock at your door rightaway. The opening goal of the new season sprang from an error in the heart of Mumbai rearguard and goalkeeper Phurba Lachenpa certainly couldn’t absolve himself of his role in it.Liston Colaco, receiving the ball from Subhasish Bose, tried to square it across the face of the goal in the 9th minute. Lachenpa, standing at first post, should have stopped it, but ended up getting a faint touch to it and the ball took a deflection off his defender Tiri’s legs and went in.The build-up to Mohun Bagan’s second goal in the 29th minute was also chaotic. As the ball came to Asish Rai following a corner, he sent it deep towards the other end. Greg Stewart headed it back into the box and Alberto Rodriguez met it with a first-time volley which was spot on as Mumbai defenders again failed to react in time.Dimitri Petratos — who scuppered a gilt-edged chance to swell the lead when he found himself in a one-on-one position with the goalkeeper but failed to beat him soon after the restart — was uncharacteristically subdued. His Australian partner Jason Cummings was also largely ineffective. But just when Bagan thought they had done enough to get over the line, Mumbai struck back.Substitute Noufal PN who came in the 62nd minute, was at the heart of both goals. On the first occasion, his cross was met by Tiri, managing to find space and time to push it towards the goal, Rai’s desperate attempt to block it on the line failing to bear fruit. Then Krouma ruined Bagan’s hopes further, his placing on receiving the centre from Noufal perfect and precise to scythe through the heart of Bagan defence.",Reigning ISL Shield winners Mohun Bagan SG and Cup holders Mumbai City FC seemed to have started from where they had left five months ago. No quarters were given and no mercy shown as they ended up sharing the spoils 2-2 in the tournament opener.Jose Molina’s hosts raced to a 2-0 lead inside the opening half an hour thanks to Tiri’S own goal and Alberto Rodriguez ’s strike in 29 minutes.

The Mariners had taken a two-goal lead but failed to hold onto it.Tiri, one of the ISL 's most experienced foreign players, inadvertently put the ball into his own net in the ninth minute, giving his former team, Mohun Bagan, an early advantage.However, he later redeemed himself by scoring Mumbai City's first goal of the match in the 70th minute.Alberto Rodriguez , participating in his maiden ISL match for Mohun Bagan, propelled the Mariners to a commanding two-goal lead by finding the back of the net in the 28th minute of the game.Mohun Bagan, under the guidance of Jose Molina, found themselves in a familiar situation, unable to hold onto their lead, echoing their loss to NorthEast United FC in the Durand Cup final on August 31 at the same location.Despite the heavy rainfall, Mumbai City FC staged an impressive second-half comeback, with substitute Thaer Krouma finding the equalizer, securing a vital point on the road.The opportunity for Mohun Bagan's Liston Colaco to breach the Mumbai defense arose after the team failed to effectively clear a free kick. Colaco managed to overpower Valpuia and make his way into the penalty area.Subhasish Bose initiated an attack by passing the ball to Colaco on the left flank. Colaco then sent a low cross into the six-yard area, where Mumbai's goalkeeper Phurba Lachenpa failed to intercept it. The ball ricocheted off Tiri and ended up in the back of the net, giving Mohun Bagan an early advantage.Mumbai had opportunities to equalize, particularly in the 13th minute when captain Lallianzuala Chhangte delivered an enticing cross from the right, finding Nikolaos Karelis at the far post. However, the striker's mistimed header resulted in a missed chance to level the score.Mohun Bagan extended their lead to 2-0 in the 28th minute, courtesy of a powerful strike from debutant Alberto Rodriguez.After another defensive lapse, Mumbai City once again struggled to clear the ball following a Mohun Bagan corner. Dimitri Petratos recovered the loose ball and passed it to Ashish Rai on the right, who then sent a precise cross into the box.Greg Stewart rose highest at the far post, nodding the ball down into the path of Rodriguez, who calmly slotted home with a side-footed strike to score his first ISL goal.The second half began with Mumbai City pressing for goals, but Manzoro’s wild effort in the 46th minute sailed over the bar.Rodriguez, instrumental in Mohun Bagan's strong first-half performance, went down with a cramp in the 79th minute and had to be substituted. This setback dulled their attacking edge, allowing Mumbai City to seize the momentum.In the 87th minute, Mumbai made key substitutions, bringing on Krouma and Brandon Fernandes.The equalizer came in stoppage time when Krouma finished off a slick move from Noufal in the 90th minute, leveling the score at 2-2.Despite Mohun Bagan's late penalty appeal for a handball and a yellow card for captain Subhasish Bose, Mumbai City's comeback was secured with a dramatic draw.Without regulars like Rahul Bheke, Alberto Noguera, and Jorge Pereyra Diaz, Petr Kratky's Mumbai City FC lined up in a 4-3-3 formation, featuring Chhangte, Bipin, and Nikolaos Karelis upfront.Molina, on the other hand, opted for more midfield strength in a 3-5-2 setup, with Dimitri Petratos and Greg Stewart leading Mohun Bagan's attack.","Mohun Bagan draw 2-2 with Mumbai City FC in the Indian Super League opener in Kolkata on Friday.

MATCH SCHEDULE

It has been an eventful year for Sriram Balaji and the amiable, battle-hardened pro will hold the key to India’s fortunes in the Davis Cup World Group I tie against Sweden in Stockholm on Saturday and Sunday.Balaji will open India’s campaign when he takes on Elias Ymer in the opening singles before Ramkumar Ramanathan tackles Leo Borg, the 21-year-old son of legendary Bjorn Borg, in the second match, as per the draw made on Friday.The Tamil Nadu combination will return to action on Sunday as they play the doubles rubber against hosts’ doubles specialists Andre Gorasnsson (aged 30 and ranked 66th in doubles) and Filip Bergevi (30, 125) at the Royal Tennis Hall.It is to Balaji’s credit that, despite him being a doubles specialist, captain Rohit Rajpal opted for his experience and reliability instead of saving him for the doubles and relying on the big serving Ramkumar to fetch him the two singles points.Balaji had a successful outing in singles in the previous tie, too, when he beat Pakistan’s ageing Akeel Khan in Islamabad earlier this year. But taking on Ymer, a 28-year-old who has been ranked 105 before and currently 238, will be an altogether different proposition. The Ethiopian-origin Swede has 11 titles, including six Challengers, the last of which came in Pune in 2018.Although he has run into a rough patch in recent times, he continues to play at the top level and is an excellent ball striker. If anything, turning out for his national team could be exactly the motivation Ymer needs to recover his form. Besides, he should have now been able to put behind him the emotional crisis arising out of his elder brother Mikael being handed a doping ban, which comes to an end later this year.But Balaji had been ranked in the top-300 and won 11 titles in the pro circuit in singles before focussing on doubles.What will be going for him, above all, is that he has been playing at the highest level with featuring in the Paris Olympics proving to be a cherished feather in the cap.“I played all the Grand Slams this year, I have been playing my best tennis. And playing for the country is always special. I keep practising singles and we played a lot of sets in practice after arriving here,” Balaji told TOIafter the draw.Asked how he intends to translate his doubles experience and skills to singles play, Balaji said: “I don’t want to give away too much of our strategy but I would be looking to keep the points short and put the pressure back on them.”By playing Balaji in combination with Ramkumar on Day 1, captain Rajpal has made clear his strategy.“What we don’t want is getting caught in long rallies,” Rajpal said.“They like to stay at the back (on the baseline) and both Ram and Balaji are good in serve and volley. They stand tall at the net, let them (opposition) try and pass them (Ram and Balaji).“They are playing at home. So, as Balaji said, we will try to put the pressure back on them.”For Ramkumar, the challenge will be to shrug off his poor form in singles — he has not won a match since May — and put his best foot forward, as he has often done when playing for India.“The surface is playing medium fast, and the ball is staying low. So it will be good for some slices. I will try to focus on my game,” Ram said.Saturday (from 5.30 pm IST):Sriram Balaji vs Elias Ymer; Ramkumar Ramanathan vs Leo Borg.

If one has to characterise Leo Borg in one word, that would be it.It is one thing handling the pressure that comes with answering to a famous surname, quite another to embrace it and give your best day in and day out — to justify the adulation, to sort of earn the tag, maybe.“It’s a special thing to me to have a dad like him,” Borg said of his father, tennis legend Bjorn Borg , during a video call from his home town Stockholm on Thursday.Sweden host India in a World Group I tie on Saturday and Sunday.“He has done a lot of things in his time, and I feel really blessed because he has all the knowledge I need to get (from a father and a coach).“Of course, he’s been really supportive, and he has always been there for me on the tennis (court) and outside tennis. He’s been the best dad, actually. So I’m pretty, really proud of him, and he has a really special place in my heart.”On the tennis front, there’s no comparison between the father and the son.Borg senior, 68 now, lifted Sweden to its maiden Davis Cup win in 1975 when he was just 19. If his 33 singles win streak is a record in the tournament history, his six French Open trophies — four of them in a row — and five straight Wimbledon titles put him in a different plane altogether.Anyone else, in any walk of life, would have walked away from that borrowed stardom and harsh scrutiny that comes with it.

Despite having never defeated Sweden in Davis Cup history, the Indian team is hopeful about securing their first victory in their sixth matchup.The contest will take place on a medium-speed indoor court at the Royal Tennis Hall in Sweden. India usually prefers faster surfaces, which would better suit their big servers.Indoor courts typically feature quick ball travel and are unaffected by external factors like wind.The team will play without top players Sumit Nagal and Yuki Bhambri .Former national champion Siddharth Vishwakarma is under consideration to join the team for an upcoming critical match. Despite his skills, his lack of experience at this level might prevent him from playing in a live rubber.The decision will likely consider his potential and the high-pressure nature of the match. His future participation seems contingent on further growth and experience.Captain Rohit Rajpal may opt for doubles specialist Balaji for the singles as he did against Pakistan on grass court earlier this year. In that match, Balaji performed well by defeating veteran Aqeel Khan in Islamabad and is currently in good form in Stockholm.Ramkumar Ramanathan is set to play a key role on the opening day of the upcoming match. The team's decision on the second singles match is still pending, with the choice between Niki Poonacha and N Sriram Balaji.Poonacha, despite his talent, has uncertain fitness due to a recent ankle sprain during practice. He is more focused on doubles and, although he beat Nagal earlier this year in Pune, has not played or won much in singles recently.Elias Ymer, Sweden's top singles player, is currently ranked 238. Indian player Ramkumar has faced Ymer twice on the ATP Tour, securing victories on both occasions.Ramkumar's performance has consistently shown strong talent and skill, yet the key for him is to stay composed under pressure and trust in his abilities.On Sunday, Balaji is set to play doubles. His partner will be either Ramkumar or Poonacha, which will be decided based on the scores after the first day.""We have better servers, and our players like to get in, play shorter points but these are medium-speed courts, so we are getting used to it by playing a lot of singles with each other,"" Rajpal told PTI.""If Yuki and Sumit were here, the tie would have tilted towards us, now it's 50-50.""""Leo Borg (second singles player) has improved a lot, we are watching him. They have a tough doubles team.""In preparation for the upcoming match, India's newly appointed Davis Cup coach, Ashutosh Singh, has conducted thorough research upon his arrival in Stockholm.In preparation for the upcoming competition, Ashutosh engaged with the coaches of the new team members, including Aryan Shah, to understand the young players' mindset and playing style.The Swedish team, led by Borg, holds the 603rd position in the rankings. Their doubles players, Andre Goransson and Filip Bergevi, are formidable competitors, ranked 66 and 125 respectively.Ashutosh engaged in discussions with players who have previously faced Borg to gather valuable insights. Additionally, Ashutosh dedicated a significant amount of time to analysing videos of the opposing players, which will aid in formulating effective strategies.The draw for the event is set to occur on Friday. The first day will feature singles matches, with doubles and reverse singles scheduled for Sunday.The winner of this tie will advance to the Qualifiers next year, while the losing team will move to the World Group I play-offs.","India will play Sweden in the Davis Cup World Group I contest starting on September 14.

Niki Poonacha fell on the centre court, he sprained his ankle.The physios are working with him, he seems to be doing ok,"" captain Rohit Rajpal said from Stockholm on Wednesday. ""There was a spot on the centre court where his shoes got stuck and he fell. We taped it (the ankle), just to protect it.""It happened two days ago.
