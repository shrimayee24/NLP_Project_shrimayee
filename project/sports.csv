NEW DELHI: India are set to face New Zealand in a bid to win the Champions Trophy after a 12-year hiatus, confronting their historical difficulty in overcoming the resilient Kiwis in ICC tournaments, where New Zealand leads with a 10-6 record and a 3-1 advantage in knockout matches.Despite criticisms regarding India's extended preparation time in Dubai, such arguments are diminished as New Zealand is also well-acquainted with the conditions. India's strategy likely involves leveraging their spin quartet, which has proven effective on the Dubai International Cricket Stadium pitch, against New Zealand's batting lineup.Spinners Varun Chakravarthy, Kuldeep Yadav, Ravindra Jadeja, and Axar Patel have been key in India's bowling success, potentially challenging New Zealand's top batters, including Kane Williamson and Rachin Ravindra.New Zealand's spinners, however, have previously succeeded against India and aim to replicate that performance. The match also carries emotional weight for India, with veterans Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma potentially playing in one of their final ICC tournaments.Kohli's recent form includes a century and two fifties, while Sharma aims to contribute more significantly. India hopes for impactful performances from the rest of the team, including vice-captain Shubman Gill, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul, and Hardik Pandya, to secure a collective victory.This final presents an opportunity for both teams to claim the ICC ODI title, with India looking to add to their trophy cabinet and New Zealand seeking their first since 2000.The match will be live-streamed on JioHotstar and broadcast on Star Sports Network.The match is scheduled to begin at 2:30 pm IST, while the toss will take place at 2 pm on March 9, Sunday.Rohit Sharma(c), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, Axar Patel, KL Rahul(w), Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, Mohammed Shami, Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakaravarthy, Washington Sundar, Arshdeep Singh, Harshit Rana, Rishabh PantWill Young, Rachin Ravindra, Kane Williamson, Daryl Mitchell, Tom Latham(w), Glenn Phillips, Michael Bracewell, Mitchell Santner(c), Matt Henry, Kyle Jamieson, William ORourke, Nathan Smith, Mark Chapman, Devon Conway, Jacob Duffy","India are set to face New Zealand in a bid to win the Champions Trophy after a 12-year hiatus.

Team India gears up for Champions Trophy final with practice in Dubai

'Rohit Sharma-led Team India will clinch the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 title': Astrologer Greenstone Lobo's huge prediction

New Zealand are working on aspects of their game that they feel India may look to exploit when the two teams meet in Dubai on Sunday for the ICC Champions Trophy final , and the Kiwi plans have been laid bare by a net bowler.India started using a four-pronged spin attack from the third game onwards in the group stage of the tournament. Incidentally, that match was against New Zealand, who could only score 205 in response to India's 249 and succumbed to the pressure exerted by the spinners.To prepare for that eventuality once again, the Kiwi batters are training specifically to counter spin, which was revealed to ANI by net bowler Shashwat Tiwari.According to the report, Tiwari said the New Zealanders are probably wary of the threat by Indian spinners, who played a key role in beating New Zealand in the group fixture as well as Australia in the semi-finals.Mystery spinner Varun Chakravarthy took seven wickets in those two matches, including a five-for (5 for 42) against the Kiwis.""They are preparing for left-armers,"" Tiwari told ANI. ""I won't say they are struggling. Of course, our Indian team has top-class spinners, but I don't think they will be able to cope with them.""India have the old war horse Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav as their three left-arm spinners. Chakravarthy and Washington Sundar are the other two spinners in the squad.""Today, I fortunately got to bowl (in the nets),"" Tiwari said further.""At one point in time, he (name not revealed in the ANI report) asked me to bowl from 18 yards just to prepare for Ravindra Jadeja. It is because of the kind of pace he (Jadeja) has. He was expecting that kind of speed. We (net bowlers) bowled from that point, and we did it nicely. But when he realised the ball was coming too quickly, he asked me to bowl from 22 yards,"" Tiwari added.India topped Group A by winning all three matches and went on to beat Australia by four wickets in the semifinal. New Zealand, meanwhile, defeated South Africa by 50 runs in the other semifinal.",Net bowler Shashwat Tiwari says New Zealand are working on aspects of their game that they feel India may look to exploit.

NEW DELHI: India etched their name in the history books once again, clinching their third ICC Champions Trophy title after a composed run chase against New Zealand in the final at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Sunday.Chasing 252, the Men in Blue showcased poise and precision, wrapping up the target in style to cap off an unbeaten campaign.With this triumph, India have now surpassed Australia in the elite list of multi-time winners, having previously won the title in 2002 (shared with Sri Lanka) and 2013 (defeated England in the final).The victory also marks redemption after their runner-up finish in 2017 and adds another prestigious ICC trophy to their collection.This edition of the Champions Trophy had its share of drama and upsets, particularly for the host nation Pakistan, who endured a forgettable tournament.Losses to both New Zealand and India in the group stage, followed by New Zealand’s win over Bangladesh, meant Pakistan were eliminated before the knockouts, becoming the third host nation — after India (2006) and South Africa (2009) — to crash out in the group stage.India’s 2025 win not only adds another feather to their glittering ICC cap but also underscores their dominance in white-ball cricket.With this title, they affirm their status as a powerhouse across formats and end the Champions Trophy on a perfect note.","India clinch third ICC Champions Trophy title after a composed run chase against New Zealand in the final at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Sunday.

Toronto Maple Leafs have suffered three consecutive losses, highlighting the impact of costly mistakes against elite competition, particularly against top contenders like the Colorado Avalanche and Vegas Golden Knights. The Leafs' recent loss against the Colorado Avalanche resulted in a loss of 4-2, and head coach Craig Berube emphasized the need for the team to improve its play in the Atlantic Division standings.The Toronto Maple Leafs are learning the hard way—mistakes against elite opponents have a hefty price tag. Playing powerhouse clubs such as the Colorado Avalanche and Vegas Golden Knights, even small errors can have huge repercussions.Coming off a humiliating 7-4 loss to Colorado on Saturday while blowing a 4-2 lead, Toronto has now dropped three in a row. Lapses in critical moments, breakdowns in head-scratching ways, and inconsistency have all been the top offenders in its recent woes.As the fight for the Atlantic Division tightens, Head Coach Craig Berube did not hesitate in his postgame comments to emphasize the necessity for his team to tighten its execution and shed avoidable errors. ""It’s just mistakes for me,” said Berube. “It’s a tough place to come in and play, and when you can hold a lead going into the third, we’re right there to shut it down. Just gotta clean up the mistakes.""The bench boss acknowledged that mistakes can be detrimental against top-tier teams like Colorado and Vegas, who dominated the Leafs in a 5-2 loss earlier this week. “We gotta stop making mistakes because they capitalize on them,” Berube added.“They’re good teams, they’re good players. We did a good job against MacKinnon tonight. I know he got the power-play goal, but we need more guys to step up and do a job. The mistakes gotta go; they have to get cleaned up because that’s what’s costing us right now, these last two games. It’s just mistakes.”The Leafs had a one-goal lead in the third period against the Avalanche, but Colorado scored twice in under five minutes, taking control of the game. Toronto was under constant pressure, getting outshot 27-11 after two periods.

Inside Brad Marchand's Contract Negotiation Struggles

It was true that the Boston Bruins were facing a shocking change: after many years, Brad Marchand was brought up in the trade to the Florida Panthers. It proved to be an uproar not just for the fans who really adored this leader and fan favorite but perhaps more so for his teammates, particularly David Pastrnak. He narrated how emotionally challenging it has been ever since their 4-nil victory against the Tampa Bay Lightning and how it had been greatly affected, just like other changes to the roster. However, Marchand's announcement would make headlines everywhere. Meanwhile, NHL insider Elliotte Friedman revealed how exactly such critical details regarding the contract talks eventually brought about Marchand's exit.Although Pastrnak was excited about possibly making up for all the roster changes brought up by the trade, it meant much more than an adjustment to his current roster: losing his buddy. ""It's just tough, emotional, and sad,"" the star forward said. That might make it particularly hard to be traded with such former players as Coyle, Carlo, Frederic, and Brazeau.""Not only did we lose leaders on this team, but also great human beings, guys with families that I was really close to. I've been here since day one with them, so it was a really tough day yesterday."" Pastrnak admitted.Even so, he showed in the above case how serious the emotional spectrum was by saying that he had even doubted whether the trade would apply because he thought he would work on it. But he added that minds should be put forward on this issue. ""We're still professional hockey players, and we have a job to do. We have to get our mindset right, look forward, and focus on what's ahead,"" he stressed.However much it hurts, Pastrnak says he is still confident that his side will stay competitive with the right effort, which the guys have shown recently.Elliotte Friedman shed light on the behind-the-scenes contract talks that ultimately led to Marchand's departure. ""No.1, I think Bruins and the player had agreed on term, 3-years, but as Don Sweeney said yesterday, there is a gap, there is a gap on AAV.” Friedman said.Unfortunately, the divide in money proved astronomically difficult to traverse. Although Marchand requested an in-person meeting with management to search for some common ground, no agreement was reached. Consequently, the veteran forward was left feeling bitter, as he had wanted to finish his career as a Bruin.Also Read : ""One of the best players"": Boston Bruins shares heartfelt farewell message to Brad Marchand following his trade to the Panthers Brad Marchand's trade is signaling the end of an era for the Boston Bruins as thousands of fans and players live with this event's impact.

As the Phoenix Suns gear up to face the Dallas Mavericks on Sunday, March 9, 2025, at the American Airlines Center, all eyes are on Kevin Durant’s injury status. The Suns, currently 29-34, are dealing with a relatively short injury list, but Durant’s condition remains a focal point for fans and analysts alike. The game tips off at 3:30 p.m. ET and will be broadcast on ABC and ESPN+, with live streaming available on Fubo. Kevin Durant will be playing tonight against the Dallas Mavericks. He is a cornerstone of the Phoenix Suns’ offense and has been a consistent performer despite lingering concerns about his health. Over the last 20 games, he’s averaged 22.5 points, 4.6 rebounds, and 3.9 assists, showcasing his ability to contribute across the board. However, his status for the upcoming game has not been explicitly detailed in the latest injury report, leaving room for speculation. The Suns have only two players confirmed out: Monte Morris (back) and Cody Martin (abdomen).The Mavericks, on the other hand, are grappling with a lengthy injury list, including Kyrie Irving, who is out for the season with a knee injury. This could give the Suns an edge, especially if Durant is cleared to play. Phoenix’s offense, led by Devin Booker’s 26.0 points per game, ranks 14th in the league, but their defense has struggled, allowing 116.5 points per contest (24th in the NBA). Durant’s presence on the court could be pivotal in tightening their defensive efforts and boosting their scoring output.Durant’s ability to stretch the floor with his 2.6 three-pointers per game adds another layer to the Phoenix Suns’ offensive strategy. His shooting efficiency, combined with Booker’s playmaking, makes Phoenix a formidable opponent when both are healthy. However, the team’s rebounding struggles (26th in the league) could be a concern against a Mavericks squad that, despite injuries, has shown resilience.Also read: Will Devin Booker play tonight against the Dallas Mavericks?

Christian McCaffrey's Wife Olivia Culpo Faces Scary Fire Incident at Her Rhode Island Barn



A peaceful day at the barn quickly turned into a nightmare for Olivia Culpo, the wife of NFL star Christian McCaffrey . While visiting her family home in Rhode Island, Culpo found herself in the middle of a frightening fire incident that required the immediate intervention of the local fire department. What started as a routine visit to check on the barn and its animals soon escalated into an emergency.Culpo began her day with a visit to the barn, where she shared an update about the rescued cats her mother had taken in. She mentioned there were eight of them, although only a few were visible in the photos she posted. Curiously, the cats were seen lounging around with a large rat beside them, seemingly indifferent to its presence—an amusing deviation from the classic cat-and-mouse dynamic.Among the barn's residents, one cat stood out—George. Culpo introduced George as a ""failed barn cat"" but also as her favorite, despite his apparent habit of ""barking orders."" She went a step further in her playful commentary by declaring, ""George is the real King of the Castle,"" humorously bestowing him the royal title of ""George I, the King of Rhode Island.""However, the lighthearted moments were short-lived. Soon after, Culpo found herself in an alarming situation as a fire broke out at the barn. Initially, she shared a post with a seemingly controlled scene, where water hoses were being used to douse the flames. She captioned it, ""Truly never a dull moment on the farm!!!!!""But the severity of the situation became apparent when she later posted an image showing thick smoke engulfing the entire area. Flames had spread rapidly, and the once-calm farm was now at serious risk. Despite the alarming visuals, Culpo reassured her followers with the message, ""Everything ended up ok."" However, the images told a more dramatic story.Fortunately, the quick response of the South Kingstown fire department ensured that the fire was contained before causing further damage. In her final update, Culpo expressed her gratitude, saying, ""Thanks to the amazing fire department,"" as she shared a photo of two firetrucks parked outside the barn.Had it not been for the prompt action of the firefighters, the situation could have escalated into a devastating disaster. The incident likely brought back memories of another fire-related scare that Culpo had previously encountered in Los Angeles.

The Phoenix Suns are set to face the Dallas Mavericks on Sunday, March 9, at the American Airlines Center, but all eyes are on Devin Booker’s status as the team prepares for the crucial matchup. Booker, the Suns’ leading scorer averaging 26.0 points per game (ninth in the NBA), has been a pivotal force for Phoenix this season. However, concerns about his health have surfaced ahead of the game.According to the latest injury report, Devin Booker is not listed among the Suns’ injured players, which currently includes Monte Morris (out, back) and Cody Martin (out, abdomen). This suggests Booker is expected to play, providing a significant boost for Phoenix as they aim to improve their 29-34 record.Booker’s recent performances have been stellar, averaging 25.4 points, 4.1 rebounds, and 7.1 assists over the last 20 games. His ability to score from beyond the arc, making 2.7 three-pointers per game, has been crucial for the Suns’ offense. With Kevin Durant and Bradley Beal also in the mix, Booker’s presence on the court is vital for Phoenix to compete against a Mavericks team dealing with its own injury woes.The Dallas Mavericks , sitting at 32-32, will be without Kyrie Irving (out for the season, knee) and several other key players, including Jaden Hardy (ankle) and Anthony Davis (groin). This could give the Suns an edge, especially if Devin Booker remains healthy and continues his high-level play.The game tips off at 3:30 p.m. ET and will be broadcast on ABC and ESPN+. Fans can also stream the matchup on Fubo, though regional restrictions may apply.As the Suns look to climb the standings, Devin Booker’s health will be a determining factor in their success.

+King James is down! Forget the drama of Hollywood; this is real-life suspense. LeBron James , the man who seemingly defies Father Time, has hit pause, clutching his groin like he just saw a ghost. And not just any ghost, but the ghost of Christmas past, 2018, when a similar injury sidelined him for weeks. Cue the dramatic music! So, what's the verdict? Shams Charania, the NBA's resident oracle, has spoken: for 1-2 weeks.That’s the official timeline, but let’s be real, in the world of sports injuries, “official” is about as reliable as a weather forecast in a hurricane. LeBron himself, ever the pragmatist, acknowledged the chilling flashback to his 2018 ordeal.Thankfully, no ""pop"" this time, just a strain. A collective sigh of relief echoed across Laker Nation, followed by the frantic knocking on wood, courtesy of LeBron himself, to ward off any jinxes. But let's cut to the chase: what does this mean for the Lakers ? They've been on a roll, finally finding their rhythm and climbing the Western Conference ladder. Now, with their leader sidelined, it’s panic stations, right? Not quite. This is where the supporting cast gets its chance to shine. All eyes turn to Luka Doncic, who has the potential to carry the team on his back. Other players must step up as well.This injury, though concerning, could be a blessing in disguise. A forced rest for the King could mean a fresher, more potent LeBron come playoff time. Think of it as a strategic power nap before the real battle begins. But let’s not sugarcoat it, the Lakers’ climb just got steeper. Every game becomes a test of their depth and resilience. Can they weather the storm without their captain? Can Luka and the rest fill the massive void?ALSO READ: After Los Angeles Lakers Loss Luka Doncic Reacts to LeBron’s Injury: Cold-Hearted or Just Honest? Ultimately, the severity of this injury will be measured by how the Lakers navigate these next few weeks. One thing’s for sure: the NBA just got a whole lot more interesting. Stay tuned, folks, this is going to be a wild ride.","LeBron James has been ruled out for 1-2 weeks with a groin strain. NBA's resident oracle, Shams Charania, has spoken about the injury.

Mikko Rantanen's NHL career has been a rollercoaster, with him being a part of the Colorado Avalanche and then being involved in numerous trades and contracts. He signed with the Carolina Hurricanes in a three-team deal in January, and then was offered by the Dallas Stars, making him an unbeatable offer.Scott Oake, from Hockey Night In Canada, interviewed the Dallas Star's Mikko Rantanen, discussing the details of his trade. Oake asked why he chose Dallas, given his position as the prize deadline catch and his options.“Mikko, you were the prize deadline catch and you had options. Why Dallas?”, asked Oake. Without hesitation, Rantanen replied, “Well, I just know how good the team is. Obviously, I like the whole setup they have and I played against them a lot. I obviously knew some guys from before and yeah, just a really good team overall.”Rantanen also opened up about his decision to leave Colorado Avalanche, “I think it was last week, I just, obviously it was a shock and they didn’t want it to happen at that time and then I just had to look at all the options… the guys were great and the team is really good but, it’s just, I had to look at it from all the angles and this was my decision.”When asked about the explosive possibilities, he further said, “Well, yeah, I think, you know, three good players so hopefully we can get on the same page… or I just have to talk to them as much as I can and try to get the chemistry going as quickly as possible.”With the signing of Mikko Rantanen, the Dallas Stars (41-19-2) believe they possess the firepower necessary to make a deep playoff run and contend for the Stanley Cup this year.

The Los Angeles Lakers are making strategic moves as they gear up for the playoffs, with reports indicating that Jordan Goodwin ’s two-way contract will soon be converted into a standard NBA deal. This decision comes as the team continues its impressive run, winning seven straight games and 18 of their last 21. To make room for Goodwin, the Lakers are likely to waive either Cam Reddish or Alex Len, with Reddish being the more probable candidate.Jordan Goodwin, a 26-year-old guard, has quickly become a valuable asset for the Los Angeles Lakers since joining the team in early February. Over eight games, he has averaged 6.1 points, 3.8 rebounds, and 1.0 assist in 16.9 minutes per game. Goodwin's achievements have not gone unnoticed, even though a recent ailment to his right ankle has slowed his progress. He has received numerous compliments from head coach JJ Redick, who has referred to him as a vital rotation player.Jovan Buha of The Athletic reports that in order to optimize financial flexibility, the Los Angeles Lakers are anticipated to convert Goodwin's deal as late as feasible. ""I do expect him to be converted at the end of the season as late as possible, and then be on the playoff roster. ... He's kind of become the 9th man, and you could argue that depending on the night and depending on the matchup, he should be like the 8th man,"" Buha said on his podcast . He also hinted at a potential multi-year deal for Goodwin in the future, stating, ""I think he's going to get a multi-year contract, longer-term later in the season.""Jordan Goodwin’s journey to the Lakers began after they waived Armel Traore to open a roster spot. A four-year NBA veteran, he has previously played for Washington, Phoenix, and Memphis, holding career averages of 6.4 points, 3.8 rebounds, and 2.6 assists across 128 games. His versatility and defensive prowess have made him a reliable option off the bench.Also read: NBA Buyout Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers could bag $33 million ex-Toronton Raptors star to bolster squad's defensive end As the Los Angeles Lakers continue their push for playoff success, the decision to convert Jordan Goodwin’s contract reflects their commitment to strengthening their roster.

""His three-point shooting addresses a key need, and his ability to play multiple positions offers flexibility. If he improves defensively and becomes more consistent on offense, he could become a solid contributor for a championship contender.""

""With the Toronto Raptors envisioning a frontcourt of Scottie Barnes and newly extended Brandon Ingram along with former lottery pick Gradey Dick at shooting guard, where does that leave current leading scorer RJ Barrett’s future?""

""Based on conversations before the deadline, RJ Barrett could be a trade candidate to monitor this summer.""

The Los Angeles Lakers are reportedly considering a bold move this summer to bolster their roster, potentially trading rookie forward Dalton Knecht to acquire former New York Knicks star RJ Barrett from the Toronto Raptors . This comes as the Lakers continue to ride the wave of success following their acquisition of Luka Doncic , who has been instrumental in their recent seven-game winning streak, propelling them to a 39-21 record and the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference. Luka Doncic ’s partnership with LeBron James has been a game-changer for the Los Angeles Lakers , driving their offense to a No. 12 ranking with a 117.3 offensive rating over the last seven games. However, their defensive performance has been equally impressive, boasting a league-leading 106.2 defensive rating during the same stretch. This resurgence has sparked speculation that the Lakers might be willing to part ways with Knecht to secure a proven talent like RJ Barrett.Heavy Sports' David Grubb noted.The Los Angeles Lakers previously attempted to trade Knecht during the deadline in a deal for Charlotte Hornets center Mark Williams, which ultimately fell through. This time, they could package Knecht, along with Gabe Vincent and Jarred Vanderbilt’s salaries, and draft capital to pursue RJ Barrett. The Raptors, who are reportedly open to moving Barrett, might find this offer appealing as they look to reshape their roster around Scottie Barnes and Brandon Ingram.HoopsHype’s Michael Scotto questioned.Barrett, who was traded to Toronto from the Knicks during the 2023-24 season, has been a consistent performer, averaging 21.7 points, 6.4 rebounds, and 5.7 assists in 49 games this season. His versatility and scoring ability make him an attractive target for the Los Angeles Lakers, who could see him as a perfect fit alongside Luka Doncic and James.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angele Lakers might reunite with $3 million shooting guard before playoffs to support LeBron James and Luka Doncic As the offseason approaches, the Lakers’ pursuit of RJ Barrett could signal their commitment to building a championship-caliber team for the 2025-26 season.

Brooklyn Nets injury report for tonight’s game against the Charlotte Hornets (March 8, 2025)

When and where to watch the Charlotte Hornets play tonight against the Brooklyn Nets (March 8, 2025)?

The Charlotte Hornets are set to host the Brooklyn Nets on Saturday, March 8, at the Spectrum Center, but all eyes are on the Hornets’ injury report, particularly the status of star guard LaMelo Ball. Ball, the team’s leading scorer averaging 25.8 points per game, has been a bright spot in an otherwise challenging season for the Hornets, who hold a 14-48 record. However, his recent performances have raised concerns about his health and availability moving forward. LaMelo Ball will be playing tonight against the Brooklyn Nets. He is not listed in the team’s injury report and is in the projected starters. In the last 20 games, Ball’s numbers have been decent, with averages of just 22.3 points, 5.4 rebounds, and 6.8 assists.The Hornets are already dealing with a lengthy injury list. Grant Williams (ACL), Tre Mann (back), and Brandon Miller (wrist) are all out for the season, while Josh Okogie (hamstring) remains sidelined. Mark Williams (foot) is listed as day-to-day, leaving the team thin in key areas. Ball’s potential health concerns could further complicate matters for a team already battling to stay competitive.On the other side, the Nets come into the game with their own injury woes. De’Anthony Melton (ACL) and Cameron Johnson (knee) are out, while Noah Clowney (ankle) is day-to-day. Despite their 21-41 record, the Nets have shown flashes of resilience, led by Nic Claxton and Keon Johnson, who have been consistent contributors.The Hornets’ struggles extend beyond injuries. They rank 28th in the league in scoring (105.4 points per game) and 14th in points allowed (113.1 per game). Their -483 scoring differential highlights the uphill battle they face nightly. Miles Bridges has been a standout, averaging 23.8 points and 8.5 rebounds in the last 20 games, but the team’s success heavily relies on Ball’s ability to perform at his usual elite level.As the Hornets prepare to face the Nets, fans and analysts alike will be watching Ball closely. His health and performance could determine not only the outcome of this game but also the trajectory of the Hornets’ season. Tip-off is set for 6 p.m. ET, with the game available on FDSSE, YES, and Fubo.Also read: Will Giannis Antetokounmpo play tonight against the Orlando Magic?

NEW DELHI: India skipper Rohit Sharma on Sunday equalled an unwanted ODI record previously held solely by West Indies legend Brian Lara — losing 12 consecutive tosses as captain.This streak began in November 2023 and continued until March 2025, culminating in the ICC Champions Trophy final against New Zealand in Dubai. Lara had set this record between October 1998 and May 1999.Rohit’s luck at the toss has been particularly poor as Team India has now lost 15 consecutive tosses in ODIs, with 12 of them coming under his leadership.This run of bad luck surpassed the struggles of Peter Borren, the former Netherlands captain, who had lost 11 consecutive tosses between March 2011 and August 2013.Tosses can play a crucial role in shaping match outcomes, especially in high-pressure tournaments like the Champions Trophy. However, Rohit and India have still managed to perform well despite this losing streak.Earlier, New Zealand captain Mitchell Santner won the toss and chose to bat first against unchanged India in the tournament finale.Pace bowler Matt Henry was ruled out after injuring his shoulder during New Zealand’s semi-final victory over South Africa in Lahore. He has been replaced by fast bowler Nathan Smith, marking the only change in New Zealand’s lineup.India and New Zealand faced off in the group stage just a week ago, with India securing a 44-run victory. Now, the two teams meet again in a high-stakes clash to determine the winner of the eight-nation tournament, which has been hosted across Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates.The Black Caps previously won the Champions Trophy in 2000, defeating India in the final in Nairobi, Kenya.","Rohit Sharma equalled unwanted ODI record held solely by Brian Lara.

This is my fourth child. It will probably be nearly exactly the same. In my hospital bag, pajamas, probably two sets that are very, very stretchy. My toiletry bag with all the goodies, shampoo, conditioner, a bar of Dove soap. You know what I’m saying? The essentials. A robe to cover my butt when I’m wearing a hospital gown and if it gets a little chilly. My going home outfit, some snacks for both myself and my husband if need be. Slippers, flip-flops. That’s literally it. That’s what I bring to the hospital.”Kylie added, “For all the dad listeners and soon-to-be dad listeners, Jason’s bag usually consists of sleep shorts, a change of clothes, and his toiletry bag. He does bring a fan. We all saw that. The man loves a fan and I don’t even blame him. It makes his sleeping situation more pleasant. I’ve said it before. I don’t want him to have to suffer. I want him to be comfortable.”Kylie Kelce's podcast is rapidly becoming a hit, pulling in fans with her quick wit and behind-the-scenes stories.

NEW DELHI: In a final packed with pressure and high-stakes moments, Glenn Phillips produced what might go down as the catch of the tournament — a one-handed screamer that sent Shubman Gill packing and breathed life into New Zealand’s defence of 251 in the Champions Trophy 2025 final at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Sunday.It was the 19th over of the Indian innings. Mitchell Santner floated one up on off, and Gill — well-set on 31 — leaned into a powerful drive through the covers.The ball seemed destined to pierce the infield and race to the fence.But Phillips had other plans. In a breathtaking display of athleticism, he launched to his right, extended his arm mid-air, and plucked the ball one-handed.The crowd gasped. Gill stood in disbelief. Phillips roared.Watch:New Zealand, till then, had looked somewhat subdued after posting a competitive yet slightly below-par 251/7, guided by patient fifties from Daryl Mitchell (63 off 101) and Michael Bracewell (53 off 40).Earlier, India’s four-pronged spin unit, led by Kuldeep Yadav (2/40) and Varun Chakaravarthy (2/45), applied the chokehold through the middle overs.From 75/3 in the 13th over, New Zealand failed to score a boundary for a whopping 81 deliveries, as Kuldeep’s deceptive wrist spin and Varun’s variations dried up scoring options.Phillips, who also smashed a rare six during that dry spell, was eventually undone by Varun's quick googly, ending a vital 57-run stand with Bracewell.But his effort in the field may yet be remembered as the defining moment — a bolt of brilliance in a tense final.","Glenn Phillips produced what might go down as the catch of the tournament.

Michael Bracewell remained unbeaten on 53, while Rachin Ravindra (37) and Glenn Phillips (34) also made valuable contributions.For India, Kuldeep Yadav and Varun Chakravarthy picked up two wickets each, while Ravindra Jadeja and Mohammed Shami chipped in with one apiece.",New Zealand's Kane Williamson ruled out of Champions Trophy final.

NEW DELHI: New Zealand got off to a flying start in the ICC Champions Trophy final against India at the Dubai International Stadium on Sunday, with openers Rachin Ravindra and Will Young laying a strong foundation. However, India had two golden opportunities to halt the Kiwi juggernaut early, but costly errors in the field allowed Ravindra to continue his aggressive innings.The first chance came in the seventh over when Mohammed Shami dropped a straightforward caught-and-bowled opportunity. Ravindra, on 28 off 20 balls, chipped the ball back to Shami, who initially seemed to duck before putting his hand up at the last moment. The ball hit the end of his left hand, which had strapping on it, and went down. Shami immediately called for the physio, needing attention on his hand.Just four balls later, Ravindra got another lifeline when Shreyas Iyer dropped him at deep mid-wicket off Varun Chakaravarthy’s bowling. Attempting a slog-sweep, Ravindra got a top edge, and Iyer, who ran 21 meters to his right and lunged at the last moment with outstretched hands, could not hold on. The ball hit his hands and spilled out as he dived, giving Ravindra another crucial reprieve.These missed chances could prove costly for India, as Ravindra has been one of the top scorers in the tournament. He had already taken the attack to India early in the innings, smashing 16 runs off Hardik Pandya in the fourth over, including a six and two fours, taking the score from 10/0 in three overs to 26/0 after four. He followed it up with two more boundaries off Shami in the next over, collecting 11 runs as New Zealand raced to 37/0 in five overs.The two big overs forced Indian skipper Rohit Sharma to introduce Varun Chakaravarthy into the attack early in the sixth over. However, despite the tactical adjustment, India’s fielding lapses allowed New Zealand to maintain their momentum. After the second drop, Ravindra ran two runs to take New Zealand to 54/0 after 7.1 overs, further solidifying their strong start in the final.However, Kuldeep Yadav clean bowled Ravindra in the 11th over for 37 (29 balls) with his first delivery of the match, making sure the drop chances were not as costly as it could have been.","New Zealand openers Rachin Ravindra and Will Young get off to flying start.

NEW DELHI: India wrist-spinner Kuldeep Yadav turned the tide in India's favour with two crucial wickets after New Zealand got off to a strong start in the ICC Champions Trophy final at the Dubai International Stadium on Sunday.Rachin Ravindra (37 off 29) and Will Young (15 off 23) provided New Zealand with a solid foundation, putting on a 57-run opening stand after Mitchell Santner won the toss and opted to bat first in the summit clash.India found their first breakthrough in the eighth over when Varun Chakaravarthy trapped Young LBW. However, with Ravindra going strong — having already given two lifelines when Mohammed Shami (caught & bowled) and Shreyas Iyer (at deep mid-wicket) dropped him in quick succession — New Zealand looked poised to dominate, reaching 69/1 after 10 overs.India captain Rohit Sharma introduced Kuldeep Yadav into the attack right after the first powerplay, and the spinner made an instant impact.Off his very first delivery, Kuldeep clean-bowled the in-form Ravindra with a brilliant googly. The ball landed in the middle, and Ravindra, failing to pick the variation, went on the back foot to punch but missed it completely. The ball sneaked through the bat-pad gap, crashing into the stumps and giving India the big breakthrough they needed.Kuldeep struck again in his next over, this time dismissing New Zealand’s batting stalwart Kane Williamson . Williamson got forward to push but failed to keep it down, offering a simple return catch to the bowler.With three quick wickets, including two by Kuldeep, India roared back into contention after New Zealand's promising start. From 69/1 after 10 overs, New Zealand suddenly found themselves struggling at 75/3 in 12.2 overs, shifting the momentum firmly in India's favour.",Kuldeep Yadav takes two wickets to turn the tide in India's favour. Rachin Ravindra (37 off 29) and Will Young (15 off 23) put on 57-run opening stand.

DUBAI: Sportspersons tend to be fired up for the big games in their careers. They can also be emotional. As soon as he learnt that he would not be able to play in the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy final against India at the Dubai International Stadium on Sunday due to a shoulder niggle - he failed the fitness test on the morning of the summit clash - New Zealand pacer Matt Henry , unable to control his disappointment of missing out on the big game, broke down, failing to hold back his tears.Even as Henry was enduring the heartbreak of missing out on the occasion, the news of his absence was expectedly met with loud cheers from the crowd, a majority of the 25,000-spectators being Indians.At the toss, the Black Caps captain Mitchell Santner informed that, having been unable to recover in time from his shoulder injury that he suffered while taking a catch in the semifinal against South Africa at Lahore on Wednesday, Henry had been ruled out and replaced by allrounder Nathan Smith.The in-form Henry is the Kiwis' most experienced pace bowler and, going into the final the tournament's leading wicket-taker. The 33-year-old jarred his right shoulder while taking a catch to dismiss Heinrich Klaasen in the 29th over, but after going back to the dressing room, the fast bowler returned to bowl two more overs in the Kiwis' semifinal win against South Africa at Lahore on Wednesday.Henry's absence must've been music to India's ears. The fast bowler took 10 wickets in New Zealand's four matches @16.70 at the Champions Trophy, with his best being five for 42 in eight overs against India at the DICS.Naturally, former New Zealand pacer-turned commentator Simon Doull termed Henry's absence as a ""big blow"" for the Black Caps in the summit clash. Henry has damaged India in the past. In the 2019 ODI World Cup semifinal at Old Trafford in Manchester, he took three for 37 in 10 overs - moving the ball around menacingly in helpful conditions to scalp the key wickets of openers Rohit Sharma (1), KL Rahul (1) and Dinesh Karthik (6). Left limping by Henry and Trent Boult’s early strikes, the Black Caps bowled out India for 221 in 49.3 overs to march into the final with an 18-run win.Smith played the opening match of the 2025 Champions Trophy against Pakistan and Lahore and took two for 20 in two overs.Even before a ball was bowled in the big final, Rohit Sharma made an unwanted, bizarre record. Another wrong call by the Indian captain meant that he lost his 12th consecutive toss in a row, thus equaling the record held by West Indies legend Brian Lara, who endured a similar streak between October 1998 and May 1999. Across formats, this marked the 15th consecutive toss defeat for Rohit and India.Rohit's streak of bad luck at the toss began with the 2023 ODI World Cup final against Australia in Ahmedabad.Having virtually given up on winning the toss, the Indian captain gestured at the dressing room, wondering at the futility of even going to the middle for the formality. Rohit's reaction even left former India batter Abhinav Mukund, presenter on Star Sports, amused, ""Rohit be like why go for a toss. This is the 12 consecutive times he has lost the toss. I wonder if there is a probability for this,"" Rayudu said.The last time Rohit won a toss was in the semifinal of the 2019 World Cup against New Zealand.Before the final, India's vice-captain Shubman Gill had spoken about Rohit's luck with the toss in his press conference on Saturday and said that the team was equally confident about batting first or chasing. After losing yet another toss, Rohit said that he didn't mind batting second. The Indian captain was confident of his team's talent at chasing well.""We've been here enough, batted first and bowled first, don't really mind batting second. It hasn't changed much, we've chased and won as well. It does give you a lot of confidence, takes the toss away from the game. At the end of the day, what matters is how well you want to play. That's what we've spoken about in the dressing room, not to worry about the toss and to just play well, that's what we've done and we have to do today as well,"" said Rohit.Meanwhile, the International Cricket Council has given a 'satisfactory' ratings to the pitches for the first two India matches in Dubai for the 2025 Champions Trophy, against Bangladesh on Feb 19 and vs Pakistan on Feb 23, which didn't produce high-scoring matches. The pitch for the Champions Trophy's opening match between Pakistan and New Zealand on Feb 18 also received a 'satisfactory' rating from the ICC.After dismissing Bangladesh for 228, India won by six wickets against Bangladesh as they chased down the total in the 47th over. India folded up Pakistan for 242, and then overcame the target easily with 45 balls to spare.","Rohit Sharma equals Brian Lara's unwanted, all-time record of losing his 12th consecutive toss in a row. New Zealand pacer Matt Henry is ruled out of the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy final due to a shoulder niggle. Henry is the Kiwis' most experienced pace bowler and the tournament's leading wicket-taker.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118819008,imgsize-31412,width-400,resizemode-4/118819008.jpg"

The Champions Trophy 2025 final will see India and New Zealand lock horns at the Dubai International Stadium on Sunday, March 9. Both teams have taken contrasting routes to the summit clash, but history suggests that this could be yet another classic Indo-Kiwi encounter.India, led by Rohit Sharma , have dominated throughout the tournament, relying on their balanced attack, which features a four-pronged spin force and a dependable top order. They breezed past Pakistan, Bangladesh and New Zealand in the group stage before overcoming Australia in the semi-finals.New Zealand, always punching above their weight in ICC tournaments, have had to fight through a more challenging road. They lost to India in their final group game, after victories against Pakistan and Bangladesh booked them a spot in the semis. They then defeated South Africa in the semi-finals. New Zealand will be confident in their ability to break India’s dream of reclaiming the Champions Trophy after 12 years.New Zealand have been a thorn in India’s side in ICC knockout matches. They lead the head-to-head record 3-1 in ICC knockouts, including wins in the 2019 ODI World Cup semi-final and the 2021 World Test Championship final. Despite India’s recent group-stage win over New Zealand by 44 runs, history suggests that the Kiwis thrive under high-pressure situations.For India, Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma remain key figures, but the team will also look towards Shubman Gill, Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul to shoulder the batting responsibility. New Zealand, on the other hand, will bank on their all-round strength, with Rachin Ravindra and Kane Williamson pivotal in their semifinal triumph against South Africa.India's spin attack — featuring Kuldeep Yadav, Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel and Varun Chakravarthy — has been their trump card throughout the tournament. However, New Zealand boasts an equally potent spin quartet of Mitchell Santner, Michael Bracewell, Rachin Ravindra and Glenn Phillips, making the battle of spin the defining factor in this final.The Dubai International Stadium has provided low-scoring thrillers throughout the tournament, and the final will be played on the same surface that hosted India’s clash against Pakistan in the group stage. The Emirates Cricket Board (ECB) has ensured a two-week rest period for all wickets, but the pitch is expected to be slow and gripping, favouring spinners.India’s spin quartet could have the edge in these conditions, but New Zealand’s slower bowlers will also be a major threat. Expect a low-to-mid-scoring contest, with 270-280 being a competitive total.","Champions Trophy 2025 final will see India and New Zealand lock horns at the Dubai International Stadium on Sunday, March 9.

On Saturday, March 8, 2025,facedat theafter the Azerbaijani fighter had to replace Dan Hooker after a hand injury. Many fans and critics believed that it was a step down for Gaethje, who was initially scheduled to face Hooker, placed at No. 6. Fiziev, placed at no. 11, stepped in for the rematch in less than two weeks' notice and delivered a tough competition for the American fighter. After 3 rounds of intense clashes, Gaethje secured a unanimous win against Fiziev, handing the latter his 3rd consecutive loss. The rematch earned the prestigious Fight of the Night AwardsEven though Dan Hooker was replaced by Rafael Fiziev, a fighter placed on slightly lower rank, Gaethje was still hopeful that a win would strengthen his hopes of a title shot . Another major reason that demanded a win from Gaethje was to mark a comeback from his loss against Max Holloway. It was the greatest defeat of his career that came as a knockout. Since then, Gaethje had not stepped into the octagon for almost a year. The win against Fiziev came as a solution and support for many aspects of Gaethje’s career.“I want to fight for the belt, obviously. It's a much different matchup than I just had.” Gaethje emphasises how the title run match would be much different from his other matches, “They tried to give me a donut, I took a bite, but I've got to get back to running if I'm gonna fight Makhachev.” The American fighter sounds in no mood to rest.

Josh Allen’s Record-Breaking Contract: A Reward for His MVP-Caliber Brilliance





Follow the IND vs NZ Live Score for real-time updates, or check out the Live Cricket Score for all ongoing matches.



The Buffalo Bills have officially made Josh Allen the highest-paid player in NFL history, reaffirming their belief in him as the franchise quarterback for the foreseeable future. Allen and the Bills agreed to a six-year contract extension worth a staggering $330 million, with $250 million fully guaranteed—the most ever given to an NFL player. The record-setting deal surpasses Deshaun Watson’s $230 million guaranteed contract, further making Allen’s position as one of the league’s elite quarterbacks.At 28, Josh Allen has already etched his name among the NFL’s top quarterbacks, and his recent performance only reinforced that status. In 2024, he led the Bills to their sixth straight AFC East title, showing a well-balanced attack with 28 touchdown passes and just six interceptions. His dual-threat ability remained lethal, as he added 12 rushing touchdowns, making him the first player in NFL history to record 40 or more total touchdowns in five consecutive seasons.Despite still having four years left on his previous contract, Buffalo’s front office saw this as the ideal moment to secure Allen’s future. His previous deal, signed in 2021 for $258 million over six years, had once positioned him among the highest-paid quarterbacks. However, as newer contracts were signed, Allen had fallen to 14th in annual salary, trailing quarterbacks with fewer accolades such as Jordan Love, Tua Tagovailoa, and Kirk Cousins. His new deal now sets the benchmark for all future quarterback negotiations.Josh Allen’s individual brilliance has been unquestionable, but one elusive goal remains—a Super Bowl championship. Over the past several seasons, he has consistently led the Bills to the playoffs, but four times they have been eliminated by Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs, including last season’s heart-wrenching 32-29 AFC Championship loss.Despite these setbacks, Allen has been among the most dominant quarterbacks in postseason history. In 13 career playoff games, he has completed 65.7% of his passes for 3,359 yards, 25 touchdowns, and just four interceptions, while also rushing for 668 yards and seven scores. His ability to elevate his game in high-pressure moments is precisely why the Bills are committed to building their future around him.Beyond Allen’s contract, Buffalo has been actively securing key talent for another championship run. Wide receiver Khalil Shakir, defensive end Greg Rousseau, and linebacker Terrel Bernard have all received new deals, ensuring that the core of this competitive roster remains intact.Allen’s name is already being mentioned among Buffalo’s all-time greats. He recently surpassed Hall of Famer Thurman Thomas for the most rushing touchdowns in franchise history and is just behind Jim Kelly’s franchise record of 237 career touchdown passes. His impact extends beyond statistics—his leadership, resilience, and ability to deliver in big moments have made him the face of the franchise.Also Read: Davante Adams joins Rams on a 2-year, $46M deal after Jets release, teaming up with Matthew Stafford The Bills’ massive investment in Allen signals their unwavering belief that he is the one to finally bring a Super Bowl championship to Buffalo. With his talent, competitive drive, and now a record-breaking contract to match, the future of the Bills has never looked brighter.","The Buffalo Bills have officially made Josh Allen the highest-paid player in NFL history.
