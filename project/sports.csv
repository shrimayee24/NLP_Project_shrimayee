MUMBAI: Former India and Mumbai allrounder Abhishek Nayar could be India's new assistant coach, TOI has learnt.Apparently, India's newly-appointed head coach Gautam Gambhir , who was a mentor of 2024 IPL champions Kolkata Knight Riders, is highly impressed with the work put in by Nayar in the backroom as an assistant coach at the franchise, where he has been in the post since 2018, and wants him as an integral part of 'Team Gambhir' for India.It will also help that Nayar has an excellent equation with India's ODI and Test captain Rohit Sharma . It can be recalled that a few years back, India's wicketkeeper-batter Dinesh Karthik , who retired recently, had credited Nayar and his coaching methods for his resurgence. Soon after KKR 's IPL triumph in May, leg-spinner Varun Chakravarthy had praised Nayar's role in the set-up.TOI tried to get in touch with Nayar, but he didn't respond to calls or messages.Talking about Nayar's input in the IPL title win, KKR head coach Chandrakant Pandit had told this paper in an interview, ""Nayar's contribution was huge. He spends time throughout the year with our domestic players. Whenever they are free, our domestic players come to Mumbai for a camp with us. It's not necessary that 15 players have to be there for us to have a camp. Even if one player is available, he's welcome to fly down to practice with us.""In the Mumbai team and later at KKR, Nayar played a mentor to several youngsters, including KKR captain and India batter Shreyas Iyer . ""Nayar loves guiding the youngsters. These days, he often comes to Mumbai's training camp at BKC, and spends time with the players, giving them valuable tips. And he isn't charging a rupee for this to the Mumbai Cricket Association. He is just passionate about Mumbai cricket,"" a source told TOI.The 40-year-old Nayar played three ODIs for India in 2009.Meanwhile, if reports are to be believed, the BCCI is interested in roping in India's pace bowling great Zaheer Khan as the men's team's new bowling coach.

1st Test: England 189/3 at stumps on Day 1 after Gus Atkinson demolished West Indies at Lord's,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/1st-test-england-189/3-at-stumps-on-day-1-after-gus-atkinson-demolished-west-indies-at-lords/articleshow/111648444.cms,"Gus Atkinson , making his Test debut for England, overshadowed the farewell of the legendary James Anderson by claiming an astonishing seven wickets as the West Indies were skittled out for a mere 121 runs on the first day at Lord's on Wednesday.England capitalized on their strong position, reaching 189 for 3 at the close of play, establishing a lead of 68 runs.Zak Crawley (76) and Ollie Pope (57) both contributed well-crafted half-centuries.Crawley appeared to be on track for a century before Seales bowled him with a rapid leg-stump yorker, bringing his spectacular 89-ball innings, which included 14 fours, to an end.Prior to the start of this three-match series, the focus had been on Anderson's final international match, following a record-breaking Test career that has now yielded 701 wickets -- the most by any fast bowler at this level. However, it was the 26-year-old Atkinson who stole the limelight with his remarkable figures of 7 for 45 in 12 overs, which included a triple wicket-maiden.Atkinson's final figures, after dismissing Alzarri Joseph and Shamar Joseph, were the second best by an England bowler on a Test debut behind Dominic Cork's 7 for 43 against the West Indies at Lord's in 1995. In contrast, Anderson had to wait until the last wicket to add to his tally of Test wickets, trapping Jayden Seales lbw to conclude the West Indies innings.West Indies debutant Mikyle Louis, the first Test cricketer from St Kitts, was the top-scorer with 27 in an innings where only three batsmen reached the 20s.The West Indies, having played just one warm-up match and with inexperienced top-order batsmen Kirk McKenzie, Alick Athanaze and Kavem Hodge holding only nine caps between them before this Test, predictably struggled after losing the toss in overcast conditions.They were 88 for 3 when Atkinson, who had already claimed two wickets before lunch, came on to bowl the 35th over.With his second ball of the over, he had Athanaze caught by Joe Root in the slips for 23.Atkinson bowled with precision and accuracy, maintaining a challenging line and length. His next delivery was a superb one that former West Indies captain Holder, returning to Test cricket after nearly a year, edged to Harry Brook in the cordon.Joshua Da Silva managed to survive the hat-trick ball, but on the very next delivery, he too fell for a duck. An inside edge was caught by the opposing wicketkeeper Jamie Smith, who, along with his Surrey teammate Atkinson, was also making his Test debut.With three wickets in four balls without conceding a run, Atkinson secured his place on the Lord's honours board for a five-wicket haul in a Test match.Earlier in the day, when England captain Ben Stokes chose to field after winning the toss, a decision met with huge cheers from the crowd at the 'Home of Cricket', Anderson was immediately in the thick of the action. Despite bowling a probing new-ball spell of five overs for 11 runs, the 41-year-old was unable to dismiss either West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite or fellow opener Louis.The West Indies were relying on Brathwaite, playing in his 90th Test, to make a substantial score. However, he was out for two, chopping the ball onto his stumps, as Atkinson struck with only his second delivery of the day.Louis's promising 58-ball innings came to an end when the 23-year-old was caught by a brilliant low catch by the diving Harry Brook at third slip off Stokes.The West Indies' predicament was epitomized when Hodge, after a fierce square cut off Chris Woakes, was well caught by Pope at point for 24, leaving the batsman sinking to his knees in disbelief.","Gus Atkinson takes seven wickets on Test debut for England.

German referee Felix Zwayer ruled that Denzel Dumfries had fouled Harry Kane in the box. Kane confidently converted the penalty, despite his past miss against France in the 2022 World Cup, leveling the score at 1-1.The game appeared destined for extra time until Watkins, substituted in for Kane, received a pass from fellow substitute Cole Palmer. With his back to the goal, Watkins turned and fired low into the far corner in the first minute of stoppage time, leaving the Netherlands stunned.England's journey under Gareth Southgate has been less than convincing, yet they have managed to reach their second consecutive European Championship final.

Additionally, Avesh Khan‚Äôs two wickets were crucial in curtailing Zimbabwe‚Äôs chase.After Avesh bounced out opener Wessly Madhevere in the second over, the wickets them kept falling for the home team.However, Zimbabwe did well to stead the ship after losing their first five wickets for 39 runs. The 77-run stand off 57 balls between Myers and Clive Madande (37 off 26) put much needed life into the game.Blessing Muzarabani (2/25) stood out as Zimbabwe‚Äôs best bowler, extracting extra bounce from his deliveries. However, that too was not enough to restrict an in-form Indian batting lineup.The next match in this five-match series is scheduled for Saturday, July 13. India‚Äôs recent victories have seen them recover the momentum after losing the series opener.",India beat Zimbabwe by 23 runs to take 2-1 lead in five-match series.

1st Test: Atkinson's magnificent seven scuppers West Indies for 121,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/1st-test-atkinsons-magnificent-seven-scuppers-west-indies-for-121/articleshow/111639961.cms,"NEW DELHI: England debutant Gus Atkinson took seven wickets, overshadowing James Anderson 's final appearance in the first Test against the West Indies at Lord's.On Wednesday's opening day, Atkinson secured a remarkable 7-45 in 12 overs, which contributed significantly to the West Indies' collapse to 121 all out.The build-up to this series had been focused on Anderson, who has a record-breaking 701 Test wickets, the most by any fast bowler.However, it was Atkinson who emerged as the star on the day.Atkinson's performance included taking three wickets in just one over, creating an unforgettable debut. In contrast, Anderson did not add to his tally of Test wickets until he dismissed West Indies' last man, Jayden Seales, lbw, concluding the innings.West Indies debutant Mikyle Louis was the top scorer for the visitors with 27 runs, as his team was dismissed in under 42 overs.The West Indies came into the game with an inexperienced top order, featuring Kirk McKenzie, Alick Athanaze, and Kavem Hodge, who collectively had just nine Test caps before this match. Following the toss, held in overcast conditions, England captain Ben Stokes opted to field, and the West Indies struggled from there on.At the beginning of the day, Anderson was brought straight into action. Despite a probing new-ball spell and conceding just 11 runs in five overs, the 41-year-old was unable to dislodge West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite or opener Mikyle Louis early on.At the other end, Chris Woakes faced some resistance when Louis hit a legside six off his bowling. Louis, at 23, is the first West Indies Test cricketer from St Kitts. The West Indies were banking on Brathwaite, playing his 90th Test, to build a strong innings, but he was dismissed for just two runs when he chopped onto his stumps off Atkinson's second ball in Test cricket.Louis's promising 58-ball innings ended just before lunch when he was caught by Harry Brook at third slip off Stokes, reducing the visitors further.The West Indies' troubles were compounded when Hodge's aggressive cut off Woakes was brilliantly caught by Ollie Pope at point, leaving the batsman in disbelief as he sunk to his knees. Hodge managed to score 24 before his dismissal.Atkinson returned to bowl the 35th over, having already claimed two wickets before lunch. He first had Athanaze caught by Joe Root in the slips for 23 and then delivered a superb ball that Jason Holder edged to Harry Brook. Joshua Da Silva, coming to the crease, narrowly survived a hat-trick but was caught by wicketkeeper Jamie Smith, another Test debutant from Surrey, off his next ball.Atkinson's final figures, after securing the wickets of Alzarri Joseph and Shamar Joseph, are the second-best by an England bowler on Test debut. His performance is second only to Dominic Cork's 7-43 against the West Indies at Lord's in 1995.Reflecting on their plight, West Indies were 88-3 when Atkinson's spell further dismantled their lineup. Nonetheless, their batting in overcast conditions, combined with the inexperience of their line-up, clearly impacted their performance.The conclusion of the innings came when Anderson, showcasing his skill one final time in Test cricket, dismissed Jayden Seales lbw. This day will be remembered for Atkinson's incredible debut, marking his potential as a significant future asset for the England cricket team.","Gus Atkinson took seven wickets on his Test debut for England against the West Indies.

""The BEST batter I have faced in my career is..."" üòÆ | James Anderson Fan Q&A

NEW DELHI: Seasoned England fast bowler James Anderson , who is set to retire from Test cricket after the match against the West Indies at Lord's, praised legendary Indian batsman Sachin Tendulkar as the greatest opponent he has ever bowled against.With 188 Test matches under his belt, he stands second on the list of players with the most appearances, after Tendulkar (200) in the longest format of the game.With an impressive tally of 700 wickets from 187 matches, Anderson currently holds the third spot on the list of highest wicket-takers in Test history.This final match also presents him with an opportunity to surpass legendary spinner Shane Warne's record of 708 wickets.During a Q&A session on Sky Sports Cricket , the 41-year-old pacer was asked about the best batter he has faced throughout his remarkable career.Interestingly, Anderson overlooked many contemporary stars, instead naming Indian legend as the most formidable batter he has encountered.""The best batter I would have to say is Sachin Tendulkar,"" Anderson stated.Having played 39 Tests against India, Anderson has claimed a total of 149 wickets, dismissing Tendulkar on nine occasions.When questioned about the best bowler he has faced, Anderson acknowledged the prowess of Australia's Glenn McGrath and South Africa's Dale Steyn .""The best bowler I faced probably Glenn McGrath or Dale Steyn. Hard to pick between the two. Slightly different bowlers, but both world-class,"" he remarked.Reflecting on his career, England's all-time leading wicket-taker in Tests singled out his dismissal of former Australian captain Michael Clarke in the 2013 Trent Bridge Test as his most memorable wicket. However, when it came to the achievement he takes the most pride in, Anderson surprisingly chose his batting performance.""Career achievement I am most proud of his getting 81 at Trent Bridge against India. I know, I probably should pick a wicket or bowling performance, but getting 81 with the bat, I think, it is just something I still can't believe I have done,"" he shared.","James Anderson is set to retire from Test cricket after the match against the West Indies at Lord's.

The seasoned batsman has set his sights on contributing to the country's cricketing aspirations, marking a significant shift in his professional journey. KKR experienced a remarkable run of success under Gambhir's leadership, clinching the coveted trophy in both 2012 and 2014.However, in the years that followed, the team struggled to replicate their winning formula. The elusive silverware seemed to slip through their grasp repeatedly, despite their relentless efforts.KKR's journey in the subsequent seasons was marked by near misses and disappointing exits. They reached the finals in 2021, showcasing their potential, but fell short of ultimate glory. From 2016 to 2018, the team consistently made it to the playoffs, only to be eliminated before reaching the pinnacle. In five other seasons, their campaign ended prematurely in the group stages, leaving fans and management yearning for a breakthroughAmidst this prolonged drought, Shah Rukh Khan , the team's owner, decided to turn to a familiar face ‚Äì someone he had relied upon in the past.""Make it or break it. This is your own franchise,"" Shah Rukh had told Gambhir when he asked him to rejoin the franchise as a mentor.Gambhir and his companion ceased their discussions about cricket and focused solely on the former's role as a mentor and guide.Gambhir's bold moves, such as acquiring Mitchell Starc for a record-breaking Rs 24.75-crore in the IPL and encouraging lead spinner Sunil Narine to open the batting aggressively, became the focal points of the IPL 2024 season.Despite his limited coaching experience, Gambhir emerged as the leading candidate for the most prestigious and demanding position in international cricket.However, with Gambhir's departure from KKR following the successful 2024 campaign and the likely exit of assistant coach Abhishek Nayar, who oversees the KKR Academy, to join him in the Team India coaching staff, the purple franchise is left with an immediate void to fill.Chandrakant Pandit, KKR's head coach with one year remaining on his contract, acknowledged the situation as a ""big challenge"" for the team.""We will enter the IPL as the defending champions , so it's going to be a big thing. Every year you play, every tournament you compete, is a big challenge for coaches, support staff, and players,"" Pandit told PTI.""Everyone contributed, and similarly, Gautam, coming with his great experience as a captain and mentor, also helped the team. Obviously, his inputs and mentoring of the players equally benefitted.""It's going to be a big challenge and a responsibility for us to rebuild the side but I'm sure we will do a fine job,"" he said looking ahead to the IPL 2025 Mega Auction which is happened every three years.The franchises have the option to keep three players from their current squad, while they can also use the RTM (right-to-match) card to acquire one released player during the auction.Although the mega auction is expected to take place in the beginning of the upcoming year, it is uncertain whether KKR will retain their veteran players, Narine and Andre Russell, who were both retained prior to the IPL 2022 mega auction.""It's just one month or so after the IPL. We have to keep working as we do every year. We will discuss. As of now there has not been any discussions all our options are open.""""The important mega auction is coming up. We will have to think about the players' roles and then see the combinations. We will have to study like every other team,"" added the astute tactician, who had coached Vidarbha to successive Ranji titles in 2018 and 2019 and then handed Madhya Pradesh their maiden triumph in 2022.Pandit will undoubtedly feel the absence of Gambhir on a personal level, especially considering the conversations they shared during their triumphant journey to secure the IPL title.""Obviously yes, We had a good rapport, discussing team strategies and planning with the captain to achieve better combinations. Obviously, we will miss the communication we had.But he has a bigger responsibility on his shoulders, Pandit added.""We're extremely elated with Gambhir being appointed as the head coach of the Indian cricket team. I'm sure he will do a wonderful job, as he has been doing over the last few years.""He has been pivotal for the success of KKR over the years, and also played big roles in India winning the World Cups in 2007 (T20I) and 2011 (ODI).""He carries a lot of experience and is definitely the right choice. I'm really happy for BCCI.""Yesterday, I messaged him, congratulated him. It's a prestigious job and a prestigious role he is going to play for our country. Obviously, I was very happy to message him. He also messaged me back.Asked whether he was sounded out about Nayar too following suit of Gambhir, Pandit said: ""This is also in the news.""""He (Nayar) has also done a great job with KKR for the last few years. He was equally valued to us. If someone gets the opportunity to excel in their career, one should be happy about that,"" he signed off.","Gautam Gambhir leaves Kolkata Knight Riders to join Team India coaching staff.

The 24-time major winner wasn't happy. Perhaps it was the ' Ruuuu ' misconstrued as 'boooo', or it might've been the salt in the air. There was really no telling, but Djokovic was in no mood to listen.He had heard too much for too long. That the 37-year-old won in straight sets was incidental.""To all those people that have chosen to disrespect the player, in this case me, have a goooooood night,"" he said, letting it resonate through the grounds. When on-court interviewer Rishi Persad tried to explain it to the Serbian, he wouldn't listen. ""I know they were cheering for Rune, but that's an excuse also to boo,"" he said. ""I've been on the tour for more than 20-years, so I know all the tricks, I know how it works."" Djokovic had a message for Centre Court fans.""I've played in much more hostile environments, trust me. You guys can't touch me,"" he warned.During his post-match interview Djokovic backed himself, but admitted there was little that could be done. ""I don't know what Wimbledon can do about it. The crowd paid for their tickets, they have the right to be there and cheer the way they want to cheer,"" he said. ""They choose how they behave or who they support. You're not going to take out the whole section of the crowd or stadium because they're misbehaving or showing disrespect.""Then there is the question of what really is disrespect?

Wimbledon: Medvedev outlasts top seed Sinner in 5 sets,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/wimbledon/wimbledon-medvedev-outlasts-top-seed-sinner-in-5-sets/articleshow/111622609.cms,"LONDON: Daniil Medvedev wasn't whining, wasn't questioning calls, he wasn't taking on spectators or sparring with the chair umpire just because he had the time. By no means was he playing his tidiest tennis, but he was sticky, as solid as a slab of concrete and completely centered. He was the immovable object. And whoever thought the maverick Russian was capable of that.In a rematch of this year's Australian Open final -- where Jannik Sinner recovered from two-sets-to-love down to win in five sets - the lanky Medvedev, built more like a high jumper than a tennis player, came through to make his second successive Wimbledon semifinals with a 6-7 (7), 6-4, 7-6 (4), 2-6, 6-3 win.There was no celebration from Medvedev after he wrapped up the win on Centre Court in four hours, he simply looked at his box --- where his coaches Gilles Cervara and Gilles Simon and wife Daria -- were on their feet clapping.The first of the men's singles quarterfinals between world No.1 Sinner and the No.5 Medvedev, their 12th meeting, with the Russian winning the first six and the Italian locking up the next five was about many things in the first four sets, including illness. Sinner was forced to take a medical timeout as he was overcome with dizziness. The deciding fifth set, however, was all about nerve.Medvedev broke the top-seed in the fourth game and didn't look back.""I knew if I wanted to beat Jannik it needs to be a tough match,"" Medvedev said. ""He's not anymore, a guy you can beat easy. At one moment he was not feeling that good and this can get away, but he started feeling better. I'm happy that I managed to stay at a high level.""Medvedev said it wasn't easy to go up against an opponent who was clearly struggling. ""It's always tricky, you want to play more points to make him suffer in a good way, but at one point, he will go, 'ok I can't run anymore' and go full power. That's what Sinner did.""In women's action, Donna Vekic of Croatia made her first Grand Slam semifinal in her 43rd start at a major when she put New Zealand's Lulu Sun to shade with a 5-7, 6-4, 6-1 win on Tuesday.Meanwhile, it has been raining every day at this south-west London suburb, more so in the last few days, where play on the outside courts (read not Centre and No.1 both of which have roofs) has been erratic. On Tuesday, it was as late as 4 pm when action on the outside courts started. Consequently, first rounds of the mixed doubles are yet to be played, forcing organizers to move the final from Thursday to Sunday.All the rain has made the courts slippery, on Monday Novak Djokovic slipped a few times on Centre Court, but it has been far worse on the outside courts. On Sunday after going down to Tommy Paul on Court No.2, Roberto Bautista Agut said, ""the conditions today were not good to play good tennis. It had everything, it was very cold, windy and some rain.""","Daniil Medvedev beats Jannik Sinner 6-7 (7), 6-4, 7-6 (4), 2-6, 6-3 in Wimbledon quarterfinals.
