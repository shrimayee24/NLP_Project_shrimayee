Bengals Say Goodbye to Trey Hendrickson Despite His Dominant Season

$15M Investment Signals Shift from Defense to Offense

Fans React to the Bengals' Game-Changing Strategy

The Cincinnati Bengals just made a move that has fans scratching their heads ‚Äî parting ways with their defensive powerhouse Trey Hendrickson and splashing $15 million on a new star, all in the name of protecting Joe Burrow . It‚Äôs a bold shift, trading sack stats for quarterback security, and it's got everyone talking.Trey Hendrickson wasn‚Äôt just a key part of the Bengals' defense ‚Äî he was the guy. Last season, he led the league in sacks, proving his value game after game. Even when rumors swirled about his future with the team, a prominent quarterback publicly backed him, solidifying his place ‚Äî or so it seemed.But now? Hendrickson is out, and the Bengals have pivoted in a surprising direction.In place of Hendrickson, the Bengals have invested $15 million in a new player, not to bolster their defense but to fortify the offensive line. The clear motive? Keep Joe Burrow upright.After seasons marred by injuries and constant pressure, it seems Cincinnati is done taking risks with their franchise QB‚Äôs health. This isn‚Äôt just a trade ‚Äî it‚Äôs a statement. They‚Äôre prioritizing Burrow‚Äôs protection over defensive dominance.The move has sparked debate among fans and analysts alike. While some understand the logic ‚Äî a healthy Burrow is essential for playoff dreams ‚Äî others question the cost of letting a sack leader walk away.Hendrickson‚Äôs absence will surely leave a gap in the Bengals‚Äô defense, but the team seems confident that bolstering the offensive line will pay off in the long run.This roster shakeup marks more than just a swap ‚Äî it‚Äôs a recalibration of the Bengals' identity. Defense wins games, but a protected Joe Burrow wins championships. The franchise seems to be betting that keeping their star quarterback safe is the key to long-term success.Now, all eyes are on the 2025 season. Will this gamble pay off, or will the Bengals regret trading sacks for security?What‚Äôs your take ‚Äî did the Bengals make the right move to put Burrow‚Äôs health above all else?Also read - Fans Rally Behind Tua Tagovailoa After 'Dad Bod' Yacht Photos Go Viral ‚Äî 'Let the Man Relax","Cincinnati Bengals traded defensive star Trey Hendrickson for $15 million.

Steph Curry‚Äôs deep connection with Davidson Basketball



Steve Kerr Remembers an ICONIC Stephen Curry Play

Steve Kerr shares thoughts as Warriors hit their stride



Can Steph Curry balance NBA Stardom and NCAA Front-Office role?



Golden State Warriors superstar Steph Curry has never been one to shy away from challenges. Whether it‚Äôs sinking impossible three-pointers or redefining how basketball is played, Curry continues to break barriers. This time, he's making headlines for a different reason by taking on the role of Assistant General Manager at Davidson College while still being an active NBA player. Even Warriors head coach Steve Kerr couldn‚Äôt help but weigh in, joking about how he might have to grant Curry some scouting time off. This move makes Curry the first-ever major U.S. sports athlete to step into an administrative NCAA role while continuing his professional career.Curry‚Äôs decision to join Davidson‚Äôs front office is more than just a career move‚Äîit‚Äôs deeply personal. Despite being overlooked by major colleges due to his smaller frame, Davidson took a chance on him, and he rewarded them with an unforgettable college career. Leading the team to the Elite Eight in 2008, Curry cemented his legacy as one of the school‚Äôs greatest athletes. Now, he returns to give back to the institution that believed in him.Warriors head coach Steve Kerr was quick to react to the news with a lighthearted comment: ‚ÄúIf he asks to leave for a game to go scout college, I‚Äôll probably say no. But it is Steph Curry, so I‚Äôll probably say yes. I just hope he doesn‚Äôt ask.‚Äù While Kerr jokingly acknowledged the dual role, he also described it as largely ceremonial, meaning Curry‚Äôs day-to-day NBA commitments won‚Äôt be affected significantly.While Curry‚Äôs off-court commitments make waves, his on-court dominance hasn‚Äôt wavered. Since the All-Star break, the Warriors have been surging, winning nine of their last ten games and climbing to the sixth seed in the Western Conference. Much of this success is credited to their mid-season acquisition of Jimmy Butler, whose defensive prowess and leadership have given the Warriors a much-needed boost.Curry has been on fire, averaging 29.8 points, 6.5 assists, and 4.0 rebounds per game over the last ten outings. Meanwhile, Butler‚Äôs presence has not only added 16.3 points per game but has also created better shot opportunities for Curry and the Warriors‚Äô supporting cast, including Moses Moody, Buddy Hield, and Brandin Podziemski. His defensive intensity has been a game-changer, allowing the Warriors to tighten up their rotations and become a more complete team.Also Read: La La Anthony cheers on son Kiyan Anthony‚Äôs standout performance in LUHI‚Äôs victory over Brewster academy Balancing an NBA career with an administrative role is uncharted territory, but if anyone can pull it off, it‚Äôs Steph Curry.

As the Warriors push toward the playoffs, it‚Äôll be fascinating to see how Curry navigates both his new front-office duties and his relentless pursuit of another championship ring.","Steph Curry is the first-ever major U.S. sports athlete to step into an administrative NCAA role while continuing his professional career.

Luka Doncic Talks Loss vs Nets, Full Postgame Interview

Brooklyn Nets End Seven-Game Losing Streak With 111-108

Luka Doncic put on a show with a triple-double performance, but frustration took center stage as the Los Angeles Lakers faced the Brooklyn Nets . With LeBron James sidelined, Doncic tried to carry the load, but a string of questionable foul calls and a controversial no-call in the final moments left him visibly irritated. As the Nets snapped their seven-game losing streak, Doncic‚Äôs frustration with the officiating became impossible to ignore.When the Lakers faced the Nets they entered the matchup without key players including LeBron James and Dorian Finney-Smith and Jaxson Hayes. During the Nets game Luka Doncic excelled with his performance by getting 22 points while getting 12 rebounds and sharing out 12 assists. His triple-double performance came with a challenge as he only succeeded on eight shots out of 26 tries.The Lakers came out firing, but the game took a turn in the second quarter when the refs started calling fouls left and right against them. Meanwhile, the Brooklyn Nets were living at the free-throw line, which really frustrated Doncic and his crew. To top it off, Luka Doncic didn‚Äôt even get to take a free throw for a good chunk of the first half, while the Nets were making the most of their chances.During the last minutes of the fourth quarter Doncic attempted a crucial shot that the officials invalidated causing further distress for him. He obtained his first technical foul in the third period through protesting about decisions made by officials. Following the game Doncic delivered a short response acknowledging dissatisfaction about his experience. The media questioned him about the officiating decisions but he refused to give details while showing his dissatisfaction with the referees.The persistent complaint of Luka Doncic throughout this season could have influenced how the referees officiated the game according to veteran analyst Skip Bayless.The repeated taunting moves of Doncic seemed to wear down the officials thus potentially influencing some of their unfavorable decisions during the game.The Brooklyn Nets took advantage of the Lakers' tough times to grab their first win in eight tries. Their aggressive style got them a bunch of foul calls, which really made a difference. Plus, their defense put the heat on Doncic, making it hard for him to shoot well, even though he still managed a triple-double.This win helped the Nets shake off their seven-game losing streak, but the Lakers need to pull themselves together to stay in second place in the Western Conference.With LeBron James still on the sidelines, Doncic needs to keep leading the charge if they want to stay in the playoff race. The Lakers' ability to face challenges head-on will be super important as they look ahead.Also Read : Ice Cube‚Äôs son O'Shea Jackson Jr. slams ‚Äôs harsh Los Angeles Lakers greatness criteria after LeBron James snub sparks debate","Luka Doncic got 22 points while getting 12 rebounds and sharing out 12 assists.

Hold onto your courtside seats, folks, because the drama's hotter than a summer slam dunk!

Nikki Mudarris , his ex and mother of his two children, is throwing down some serious accusations, and let's just say, the scoreboard isn't looking good for Ball.Mudarris, the reality star and real estate mogul, isn't holding back. She's accusing Ball of going radio silent on their kids for nearly six weeks, a claim that's got the internet buzzing like a swarm of angry hornets. ""We pushing 6 weeks, your kids ain't hear from you yet!"" she declared on Instagram, adding a scathing ""Diabolical. Exit the chat."" Ouch. It seems the breakup, following Mudarris's allegations of Ball abandoning them for another woman he allegedly impregnated, has turned into a full-blown social media showdown.But Mudarris isn't just relying on words. She's flexing her financial muscles, too, flaunting stacks of cash at a strip club and throwing shade at Ball‚Äôs ‚Äúlittle rap money.‚Äù ""This ain't little rap money, this that real money üòÇ"" she quipped, emphasizing her ""big dawg"" status. ""MF really tweakin' real life. No cap üß¢."" It's clear she's not just playing defense; she's going for the slam dunk of public opinion.Ball, who recently signed a multimillion-dollar deal with Def Jam, has yet to respond to these latest volleys. However, he did express his disdain for being labeled a bad father on the Baller Alert podcast, claiming, ""S*** I don't like [on social media] is when ns try to say I am like a deadbeat pop or something cause I be with my young ns every day for real.""

Le'Veon Bell Allegations: Le'Veon Bell Allegedly Raped His Cousin Jada Bell for a Decade ‚Äî Jury Awards Her $25 Million in Damages,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/leveon-bell-allegedly-raped-his-cousin-jada-bell-for-a-decade-jury-awards-her-25-million-in-damages/articleshow/118903306.cms,"George Gojkovich/Getty Images

Jada Bell's lawsuit accuses Le'Veon Bell of years of sexual abuse

Le'Veon Bell's legal team pushes back, calling the judgment unfair

No criminal charges filed against Le'Veon Bell ‚Äî for now

Former NFL star Le'Veon Bell is making headlines again ‚Äî but not for anything happening on the field. His cousin, Jada Bell, has filed a lawsuit accusing him of raping her over the course of nearly a decade, starting when she was just six or seven years old. And now, a jury has hit Bell with a $25 million verdict.Filed in Franklin County, Ohio, back in March 2024, Jada Bell's lawsuit paints a horrifying picture of long-term sexual abuse. According to the court documents, Le'Veon Bell allegedly used slang terms like ""fire"" ‚Äî a disturbing reference to oral sex ‚Äî to direct Jada during the alleged assaults. The lawsuit claims this abuse went on until Jada turned 18.Things escalated quickly in October 2024 when Le'Veon Bell failed to respond to the lawsuit, resulting in a default judgment against him. With Bell absent from the courtroom, a jury trial moved forward without his defense, and the outcome was a massive $25 million verdict in Jada's favor.Le'Veon Bell has strongly denied all the allegations, with his lawyer, Thomas W. Shaffer, claiming Bell was never properly served with the lawsuit. Shaffer argues that Bell wasn‚Äôt even living in Ohio when the legal papers were supposedly delivered ‚Äî a key point in their efforts to reverse the ruling. Bell‚Äôs team is now pushing to overturn the $25 million judgment, saying the case hasn't been fairly litigated yet.It‚Äôs important to highlight that this is a civil case ‚Äî not a criminal one. Le'Veon Bell hasn‚Äôt been charged with any crimes related to Jada Bell‚Äôs accusations. His legal team insists the default judgment doesn‚Äôt reflect a proper trial and is fighting for a chance to present their side in court.Le'Veon Bell, once a standout running back for the Pittsburgh Steelers , has faced a series of professional and personal struggles since his NFL days. After sitting out the 2018 season due to a contract dispute, Bell bounced between teams like the New York Jets, Kansas City Chiefs, and Tampa Bay Buccaneers before shifting his focus to boxing.This lawsuit adds another layer to Bell‚Äôs recent controversies. While Jada Bell seeks justice through the legal system, Le'Veon Bell is battling to overturn the ruling ‚Äî and the legal showdown is far from over.Stay tuned as this case continues to unfold.Also read - Bengals Cut Ties with Trey Hendrickson to Free Up $16M ‚Äî Supporting Joe Burrow's Core with Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins","Le'Veon Bell's cousin, Jada Bell, has filed a lawsuit accusing him of raping her over the course of nearly a decade, starting when she was just six or seven years old.

What‚Äôs the Beef? Kevin Durant and Desmond Bane‚Äôs Tense Exchange Caught on Camera

Monday night's clash between the Phoenix Suns and the Memphis Grizzlies wasn't just a game; it was a full-blown soap opera, complete with simmering tensions, dramatic monologues, and a near-brawl that had everyone buzzing. With every playoff spot hanging in the balance, it's no surprise things got a little‚Ä¶ heated.The cauldron started bubbling in the dying embers of the third quarter. Desmond Bane, channeling his inner quarterback, whipped a pass to Cam Spencer in the corner. Spencer, with the audacity of a rookie who just hit a clutch three, decided to give Kevin Durant a verbal ""hello."" Durant, known for his ice-cold demeanor, wasn't having any of it. Spencer's trash talk, apparently, didn't sit well with the Slim Reaper, and let‚Äôs just say, the pleasantries weren't returned.Enter Desmond Bane, stage left, playing the role of a loyal teammate. He stepped in to defend Spencer, and suddenly, we had a full-blown face-off. Durant and Bane, nose to nose, exchanged words that probably wouldn't make it into a children's book. The tension was thicker than a Memphis BBQ sauce.The refs, bless their souls, stepped in before things escalated into a wrestling match. Technical fouls were handed out like candy, with Durant and Spencer getting slapped with one each. Bane, somehow, managed to escape unscathed, perhaps because he was just the catalyst for the main event.Now, let's talk about Spencer. This rookie, in just his 13th NBA game, decided to poke the bear. It takes serious guts (or maybe just a lack of fear) to talk trash to Kevin Durant. Coaches everywhere are probably shaking their heads, muttering, ""Never wake a sleeping giant."" But Spencer, riding high on a career-best performance, clearly felt invincible.ALSO READ: Phoenix Suns vs Memphis Grizzlies Game Preview (03/10): Starting Five, Injury Report, Start Time, How to Watch, and More And honestly, who can blame him? The Grizzlies, fighting tooth and nail for a playoff spot, needed every ounce of energy and bravado. With the Suns desperate to crash the postseason party, the stakes were sky-high. Sometimes, you just gotta let the rookie have his moment, even if it involves a near-brawl with one of the greatest players of all time. After all, that's what makes sports entertainment so thrilling.","The Phoenix Suns and the Memphis Grizzlies were playing for a playoff spot Monday night.

Toto Wolff Shares Thoughts on Lewis Hamilton's Move to Ferrari and Their Continued Rivalry



Toto Wolff‚Äôs DRASTIC Reaction to Lewis Hamilton in Ferrari F1 Red

Toto Wolff , the team principal of Mercedes, has expressed his thoughts on Lewis Hamilton ‚Äôs much-discussed move to Ferrari for the 2025 Formula 1 season. While the change came as a surprise to Wolff, he emphasized that Mercedes remains focused on competing against its former star driver. The announcement of Hamilton's shift to Ferrari just ahead of the 2024 F1 season shocked many, including Wolff, but he‚Äôs gradually adjusted to the change.Reflecting on the initial moments after the announcement, Toto Wolff admitted to OE24, ‚ÄúAt first, it was a strange thought how he would look after so many days in the Mercedes.‚Äù Given Hamilton‚Äôs long-standing association with the Silver Arrows, seeing him in Ferrari‚Äôs red was an adjustment for Wolff. However, he quickly grew accustomed to the sight, adding, ‚ÄúBut then he rode up in his red outfit and in the red car. In these fast-moving times, you quickly get used to it. Now it's a normal image for me.‚ÄùThe first glimpse of Hamilton in Ferrari colors came in January, when he visited Maranello and posed in front of a Ferrari F40, dressed in a black suit. The image quickly became iconic, capturing Hamilton standing next to a legendary Ferrari car in front of Enzo Ferrari‚Äôs former home. Wolff, who shared the moment with Hamilton, couldn‚Äôt help but laugh about it. ‚ÄúThere was something iconic about him standing there in his Godfather outfit in a suit,‚Äù Wolff remarked. He then joked, ""I said to him: 'I've been trying to get you into a suit for 12 years, and then you do it on your first day at Ferrari.' We both laughed a lot.""Despite the personal bond between Hamilton and Wolff, the two remain fierce competitors on the track. Wolff emphasized, ‚ÄúWe are very good friends. On a personal level, I wish him all the best, but on the racetrack we want to beat him.‚Äù It‚Äôs clear that while their friendship endures, Mercedes‚Äô goal remains unchanged: to continue their pursuit of victory, even if that means competing against Hamilton in Ferrari colors.Also Read: 2025 F1 world champion predictions: Can Max Verstappen be stopped?

India win Champions Trophy title; Rohit Sharma confirms he's not retiring

NEW DELHI: India‚Äôs advantage of playing all their matches in Dubai became a hot topic of debate the moment they kicked off their Champions Trophy campaign. Many questioned whether Team India had an unfair edge, as they played all their games ‚Äî including the group stage, semifinal, and final ‚Äî at the neutral venue of Dubai International Stadium . This scheduling decision came after the BCCI opted not to travel to Pakistan for the tournament.However, Pakistan pace legend Wasim Akram dismissed the controversy, stating that even if India had played in Pakistan, it wouldn‚Äôt have made a difference, given their sheer dominance in global tournaments.India clinched the title with a four-wicket victory over New Zealand in the final, marking their second ICC trophy in just nine months. Their previous triumph came in June 2024, when they defeated South Africa in the T20 World Cup final in Barbados.India‚Äôs supremacy was further highlighted by the fact that they remained unbeaten in both tournaments, reinforcing their status as the team to beat in world cricket.""This Indian team would have won it anywhere in the world,"" Akram said, speaking in the Dressing Room show on the Sports Central channel.""Yes, there were a lot of talks once it was decided that India would play all of their matches in Dubai. But had they played in Pakistan, they would have won there as well,"" Akram stated.""They won the 2024 T20 World Cup without losing a game, they went on to win the Champions Trophy without losing even one game which shows the depth in their cricket, that shows the leadership,"" Akram added.""If you remember, they lost 3-0 to New Zealand in the Test series at home, lost the Border-Gavaskar trophy, and lost the series in Sri Lanka. They were under pressure to remove the captain, the coach but sanity prevailed. BCCI backed them, said 'this is our captain, this is our coach' and now they are the champion of the champions,"" said Akram.","India clinched the title with a four-wicket victory over New Zealand in the final.

Klay Thompson Joins Dallas Mavericks With High Expectations

Klay Thompson's goal to guide the Dallas Mavericks back to 2011 glory

The Dallas Mavericks have had a rocky season, with Luka Doncic 's surprising trade and injuries to Kyrie Irving and Anthony Davis throwing a wrench in their playoff plans. But Klay Thompson isn't sweating it. With his championship pedigree and strong faith in the team's abilities, Thompson might just be the boost Dallas needs to turn things around.When Klay Thompson joined the Mavericks, there was a lot of hype around how he would connect with Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving. Everyone thought this trio could take Dallas back to the championship level, just like in 2011. But then, the shocking trade of Doncic to the Lakers for Anthony Davis threw everything off balance. Instead of boosting the team‚Äôs frontcourt, it led to fewer fans showing up at games and a wave of criticism aimed at the management for their decisions.Things got even worse for the team with both Kyrie Irving and Anthony Davis getting hurt. Irving's torn ACL has put him out of action for who knows how long, and Davis might be done for the season. With both of them out, the Mavericks are really feeling the pinch, and it‚Äôs putting a damper on their hopes. Now they‚Äôre stuck in the play-in tournament zone, which has fans worried about where the franchise is headed.Klay Thompson's leadership skills and his previous championship experience prove vital at this moment. His experience during his successful Golden State Warriors years provides important knowledge which he can share with the Mavericks' developing roster. Through creating a winning environment and mentoring younger players Thompson demonstrates his deep commitment to the long-term success of the organization.Thompson is all in on the Mavericks and their potential. He‚Äôs made it clear that he wants to help the team get back to the top, saying, ""I still believe in this franchise. I‚Äôm here for two more seasons after this, so I‚Äôd love to help them return to the glory that they were brought to in 2011.""Also Read - With Luka Donƒçiƒá Gone and Anthony Davis Injured, Dallas Mavericks Struggles to Justify 8.61% Ticket Price Hike Fans are definitely feeling this vibe as they hope for a shot at the championship again.","The Dallas Mavericks have had a rocky season, with Luka Doncic's trade and injuries to Kyrie Irving and Anthony Davis throwing a wrench in their playoff plans.

It was the best of times, it was the worst of times‚Äî for the? Not really. The Dallas Mavericks were at the receiving end of the trouble following the Luka Doncic trade in exchange for Anthony Davis . However, for the Lakers, letting Davis go was not an easy decision. In a recent interview, the Lakers' boss,, candidly shared how hard it was for them to let go of the 10-time NBA All-Star while revealing why the secret of the trade was the utmost necessity.The Anthony Davis Luka Doncic trade was a shockwave that no one in the league, even the insiders, saw coming. Of course, it still echoes debate among fans, especially concerning the Dallas Mavericks gamble, but the Lakers were not entirely out of regret. The Lakers president and governor Jeanie Buss has recently shared her thoughts on the whole ordeal.""I said what's the most important is that if the conversations [about the trade] become public, it could blow up our season. Because now you have a player who thinks they're gonna get traded, it's hard for them to recalibrate. It was completely kept under wraps, and I think that's why it took everybody by such surprise."" Buss said.Explaining the expense of the trade, Buss continued, ""Look what we had to give up, though. Anthony Davis, we won a championship [with him]. Do you know how hard that was? We were not looking to trade Anthony Davis. Dallas contacted us. And [Davis] had been making it clear that he wasn't happy, that he was having to play the [center]. He wanted to play the [power forward].""But at the end of the day, it was all business and keeping the roster packed with star performers. Certainly, Doncic came with certain perks, including his age factor. Bringing Doncic proved to be a huge win for the Lakers, as they have had a good series of matches since the arrival of the 26-year-old Slovenian star.""I think we need to get the right players around him,"" Buss said of Doncic. ""It's very interesting to watch him play with LeBron. We don't have enough of a sample size yet. Wow, this kid can pass the ball. He sees the game like no one I've ever [seen]. I really had no idea how great of a mind he has for basketball.""She added, ""The timeline started ‚Äî just because you'll never forget that day ‚Äî on Jan. 7. The Lakers were in Dallas. At that point, our GM, Rob Pelinka, was at the game, and he met with the GM of the Dallas team. And then, Rob thought about it for a day and then came to me and said, 'Here's something that was kind of talked about.' A framework. And I said, 'I hope you told him that we're not trading Anthony Davis.' We are not trading him. Then we talked more and more, [and] we figured out a framework that could work.""Also Read: Anthony Davis Struggles with Sudden Trade, Injury Woes and Adjusting to a New Team Without His Family It appears that both teams got what they wanted.

'It‚Äôs a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee ‚Äî Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match ‚Äî before the Nagpur ODI ‚Äî more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‚ÄòHitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

India win Champions Trophy title; Rohit Sharma confirms he's not retiring

Segregating T20 WC and ODI WC preparation

NEW DELHI: There may be no international cricket for India in the next three months, but head coach Gautam Gambhir has already firmed up his prep plan for the five-Test tour of England starting in late June. TOI has learnt that Gambhir has decided to travel with the India 'A' team to England before the Test tour gets underway on June 20.Since the Indian cricket board (BCCI) doesn't have any designated coach for the developmental sides, it will be interesting to see if Gambhir travels just as an observer or BCCI's Head Cricket VVS Laxman takes up the role. After Rahul Dravid had assumed the role of the head coach of the senior team, for India 'A' and U-19 assignments the BCCI rotated coaches from the pool at the National Cricket Academy. It would be the first time the senior team coach will be accompanying an India A side on a tour.Sources told TOI that Gambhir has been working on a roadmap across formats for the next two years leading to the 2027 ODI World Cup , a phase which will also include the World Test Championship and 2026 T20 World Cup . ""Gambhir has been in discussions with the BCCI since he returned from Australia. He has expressed his desire to travel with the India 'A' team to get a clearer view of the reserve pool,"" a BCCI source said. ""With India winning the Champions Trophy after Gambhir's insistence for certain wild card players, one may expect him to assert more in future,"" the source added.India's Test cricket standing plummeted after Gambhir took up the job last July. India lost 0-3 to New Zealand at home before suffering 1-3 defeat in Australia. Gambhir, chief selector Ajit Agarkar and Laxman have had discussions on possible ways of reviving India's pool of players for Test cricket.""One of the crucial issues identified is reviving India 'A' tours. There have been only a handful 'A' series after Dravid left NCA and all of those were shadow tours for a marquee series. Gambhir too believes that there needs to be more 'A' tours. That's why he wants to take stock of the situation firsthand,"" the source said.If one goes by the selection trends since Gambhir took charge, there are plenty of impulsive calls taken majorly on the horses-for-courses theory. Of late, India's Test squad has looked far from settled. The resource pool hasn't been tried enough. As is the practice on shadow tours, a few of the senior team players may be urged to play in the 'A' series in England. Gambhir will be taking stock of the senior players' form and identifying possible backups.With Rohit Sharma 's Test form and place in the XI still under scrutiny, focus will be on finding a steady reserve opener and also a solid middle order batter. India didn't show any confidence in Abhimanyu Easwaran and Sarfaraz Khan in the tour of Australia. Sai Sudharsan and Karun Nair will look to impress along with Easwaran and Sarfaraz in the 'A' series.India's pace-bowling resources will also be on trial with question marks over Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami's fitness to survive a five-Test tour.Gambhir has been advocating having a niche T20 team that will be largely picked on form. TOI understands that he doesn't want to mix the ODI and T20I formats.India will play about 24 ODIs going into the next World Cup. The coach would prefer to form the core of the ODI team as early as possible. The selectors and Gambhir will need to be sure if they see Rohit continuing as captain till October 2027.Gambhir has apparently argued that the T20 team is excelling since there's clarity on how the players need to approach the format. Barring a few top players, one may expect very few two format white-ball players.India will co-host the next T20 World Cup with Sri Lanka next year. This IPL becomes very crucial in that sense since Gambhir is a strong advocate of recent form.",Gautam Gambhir will travel with the India 'A' team to England before the Test tour gets underway on June 20. Head coach has been working on a roadmap across formats for the next two years leading to the 2027 ODI World Cup.
