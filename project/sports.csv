"Tigress survives years with snare knotted around stomach, raises healthy cubs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tigress-survives-years-with-snare-knotted-around-stomach-raises-healthy-cubs/articleshow/120743307.cms,"PILIBHIT: A tigress whose lower back was cinched for years by a metallic snare - an injury so severe it had reshaped her into a silhouette almost cheetah-like - continued not only to survive but to give birth to healthy cubs , a rare feat observed recently in the Surai forest range of Terai East forest division. First sighted with the embedded snare in 2022, and rediscovered in Dec 2023, the tigress stunned forest officials who, as they prepared to dart her for rescue, witnessed her carrying a cub gently in her mouth - a moment that suspended the operation and reframed the story they thought they were about to tell.From the beginning, her case defied expectation. The metallic loop had lodged itself deep in her lumbosacral region, an area crucial for mobility and balance. Yet, despite the physical restrictions - and the internal damage that experts later suspected - she moved through her habitat with enough stealth and strength to hunt, mate, conceive, and rear a litter. Drone surveillance launched after the interrupted rescue attempt confirmed what seemed almost improbable: four cubs, nursed and nurtured, thriving in her care.Today, three of those cubs, now around sixteen months old, roam the forest with their mother, who continues to hunt and provide for them with a tenacity that belies the injury written into her body. To the team observing her, and to the wider circle of wildlife biologists, her survival - and that of her cubs - has become a living case study in endurance, adaptation, and the hidden margins of possibility in the wild.At the Wildlife Institute of India, where a detailed plan for her future is under discussion, Dr Parag Nigam told TOI that the need to rescue the tigress remained urgent. ""The metallic snare poses serious physical and spinal risks that could worsen with time,"" he said, adding that her images would be sent to WII's tiger cell to cross-reference her history with national tiger databases.Veterinary experts studying her case noted the narrow anatomical escape that had allowed her to survive and reproduce. Dr R K Singh, former veterinary head of Kanpur zoo, explained that the snare's position likely spared her kidneys and ovaries, trapping mostly the intestinal loops instead.","A tigress whose lower back was cinched for years by a metallic snare continued to survive and give birth to healthy cubs.

Dolphins’ new quarterback choice signals a bold shift in long-term strategy



Tua Tagovailoa’s journey highlights the balance between resilience and risk



Backup quarterback’s seven-figure loss reflects deeper emotional stakes

The Miami Dolphins have sparked major conversation across the NFL landscape after drafting a new quarterback from the Texas Longhorns, a move signaling potential change at the most critical position. As a result, current starter Tua Tagovailoa finds himself navigating a wave of uncertainty, with both emotional and financial consequences rippling through the team.In an unexpected but calculated move, the Miami Dolphins' front office made it clear they are thinking beyond the present by investing in a young quarterback prospect. This decision doesn’t just add competition—it signals the beginning of a strategic transition. With fresh talent entering the locker room, the message is unmistakable: the franchise is determined to secure its future, even if it means re-evaluating relationships with established stars like Tagovailoa.Tua Tagovailoa’s career with the Dolphins has been a testament to both brilliance and adversity. After battling through a series of injuries, especially concussions, Tagovailoa showed resilience time and again. Yet, the physical toll of the game has never been far from mind for both the player and the organization. The recent draft move forces a tough reality into focus—balancing loyalty to a battle-tested leader with the practical need to protect the team’s long-term viability.Adding to the drama, the team’s backup quarterback reportedly suffered a jaw-dropping seven-figure financial loss in the wake of the draft move. This sudden hit is not just about dollars—it captures the often harsh business side of professional sports, where roles and futures can pivot overnight. It also underscores the emotional challenges athletes face when roster decisions upend carefully laid career plans.In steering the team through this delicate phase, head coach Mike McDaniel has approached the situation with measured precision and deep empathy. Recognizing the strong bonds that have formed within the team, McDaniel’s handling of the quarterback competition aims to blend tactical necessity with human understanding. The Dolphins' leadership knows that while performance metrics matter, preserving team culture is equally vital during times of change.Also Read: Mike Tomlin's cryptic comments on Aaron Rodgers fuel rumors of a Steelers move—Is Pittsburgh desperate for a QB?

In professional sports, change is inevitable, but with change comes opportunity—for reflection, growth, and ultimately, renewed success.","The Miami Dolphins have sparked major conversation after drafting a new quarterback from the Texas Longhorns.

Giannis Antetokounmpo could not save Game 5 for the Milwaukee Bucks



The Indiana Pacers lead the playoff series 4-1



The Milwaukee Bucks are far from catching a break as Giannis Antetokounmpo and company faced another devastating defeat against the Indiana Pacers by one point at the Gainbridge Fieldhouse in Indianapolis. The Pacers now lead 4-1 following Tuesday's 119-118 win. Antetokounmpo did his best alongside Gary Trent Jr. ’s game-high scoreboard, but the game eventually went in the Pacers’ favor.Despite a stunning collective effort from the Milwaukee Bucks, their Game 5 showdown with the Indiana Pacers ended in heartbreak.

In 44 minutes of action, he racked up a dominant 30-point, 20-rebound double-double, also dishing out 13 assists for a rare playoff triple-double. His efficiency was impressive, shooting 52.9% from the field and adding two blocks and two steals.Gary Trent Jr. also stepped up with a huge scoring night, pouring in 33 points while hitting 8 of his 17 shots from deep. J.J. Green added a sharp 19 points with remarkable efficiency from beyond the arc, draining 6 of his 10 attempts. But beyond those three, offensive contributions were scattered. Bobby Portis chipped in with 14 points and 10 rebounds.Milwaukee’s bench offered limited impact. Jericho Sims and Kyle Kuzma combined for just 9 points, and no reserve scored more than 5. Brook Lopez, surprisingly quiet, went scoreless from the field in under eight minutes. The Bucks did move the ball well, tallying 25 assists, but their 17 turnovers were costly, especially in a game decided by a single point.The Indiana Pacers edged out a narrow win in Game 5, outlasting the Milwaukee Bucks 119–118 behind a balanced team effort and timely contributions off the bench. Tyrese Haliburton led the charge with 26 points and 9 assists.T.J. McConnell proved to be the surprise x-factor, pouring in 18 points in just 17 minutes on an ultra-efficient 7-of-11 shooting. His energy off the bench helped spark a second-quarter run and kept Indiana within striking distance when the starters rested. Meanwhile, Aaron Nesmith played a huge all-around game, finishing with 19 points and a team-high 12 rebounds.Myles Turner quietly had one of his more complete playoff games, adding 21 points, 9 rebounds, and 3 triples while going 8-of-10 at the line. He served as a steady inside presence and drew several key fouls late.

Alijah Arenas is recovering well after Tesla Cybertruck crash

Five-star basketball recruit and the son of former NBA All-Star Gilbert Arenas , Alijah Arenas , is showing remarkable progress less than a week after surviving a terrifying car crash in Southern California. The 18-year-old was involved in a single-vehicle accident early Thursday morning, April 24, when the Tesla Cybertruck he was driving lost control and slammed into a fire hydrant and a tree in the Reseda area of the San Fernando Valley.According to reports from the Los Angeles Fire Department, the crash occurred just before 5 a.m. as Alijah Arenas, son of Laura Govan , was returning home from an early workout at the gym. The impact left the front of the Cybertruck engulfed in flames, trapping the young star inside as smoke filled the cabin. Several bystanders acted quickly and managed to pull him from the burning vehicle.""I remember hearing banging on the car window, but I couldn't see anything because the smoke was so thick. That's when I realized someone was inside,"" one eyewitness told ESPN. ""We used everything we had to bend the cracked window and pull him out. The car was on fire. We just knew we had to get him out.""Alijah was rushed to a nearby hospital and placed in a medically induced coma due to smoke inhalation. Fortunately, doctors later determined he had suffered no major injuries, and he was brought out of the coma the following day.In the latest episode of Gil's Arena, a podcast hosted by Gilbert Arenas and Josiah Johnson, an encouraging update was shared.""Happy to announce that Alijah is doing much better,” Johnson said. “Walking, talking, progressing very well, should be released from the hospital very soon.

Jimmy Butler talks about playing despite injury

Jimmy Butler has yet to fully recover from his aching tailbone but went against all odds to help the Golden State Warriors secure another crucial win against the Houston Rockets in Game 4 of the first round of the NBA playoffs. The team clinched a narrow 109–106 victory, with a clearly uncomfortable Butler giving his all to secure a final rebound despite the injury.The Golden State Warriors now lead the first-round series 3–1 and are on the brink of advancing to the Western Conference semifinals. During the post-game press conference, Butler was asked to explain the final rebound he grabbed for the team. Responding to the reporter, Butler said, “I saw that I wasn't battling with Stephen Adams the last play. So I was able to go up there and be a semi-athlete, but I wanted to rebound. I told Dray (Draymond Green), if you get a stop. I will get the rebound and he got the stop and I got the rebound.”Fans were highly impressed with Curry’s execution and leadership on the court. He continues to prove himself as one of the most clutch players in the playoffs. Reacting to Curry’s performance, one fan said, “He is quietly becoming a top playoff performer.” Another wrote, “REAL defense wins championships.” A third commented, “Did what he had to do.” One more added: “That's a grown man rebound.” An X user called it “Perfect execution on the defensive end.”Butler had previously left the Warriors concerned after sustaining a pelvic contusion in Game 2, which forced him to miss Game 3. It was uncertain whether he would return this soon. Speaking after his comeback performance, where he scored a solid 27 points, Butler said, ""More than anything, I just wanted to play. This is the best time of the year for everybody; this is why you go through what you go through. So to be able to miss a game, I don't like it. But I'm back.

Sunil Narine bowled really well: Anukul Roy

Kolkata Knight Riders captain Ajinkya Rahane sustained a hand injury during their 14-run victory against Delhi Capitals and will undergo medical assessment by the franchise's medical staff on Wednesday morning. The incident occurred in the 12th over of the second innings when Rahane, fielding at short cover, was struck by a ball hit by Faf du Plessis off Andre Russell's bowling.After the injury, Rahane received medical attention off the field and watched the remainder of the match with his hand heavily strapped. Venkatesh Iyer replaced him with Vaibhav Arora, while Sunil Narine took over the captaincy duties for the remaining overs.During the post-match presentation, Rahane downplayed his injury concerns, stating, ""Not bad. I will be okay. I will be fine.""The KKR spokesperson indicated that initial assessment suggested the injury wasn't serious. Team doctor Prasanth Panchada will examine Rahane on Wednesday morning to determine the full extent of the injury.Earlier in the match, after DC won the toss and elected to field, Rahane scored a quick 26 off 14 balls before being trapped lbw by Axar Patel. Angkrish Raghuvanshi (44) and Rinku Singh (36) contributed significantly to help KKR post 204/9.DC's chase saw strong performances from Faf du Plessis (62), Axar (43), and Vipraj Nigam (38), but they fell short of the target.Rahane credited Narine's final two overs as the turning point, saying, ""204 on that wicket was good, but I thought we were 15 runs short, frankly. We were going really well as a batting unit. But again, you're chasing 204, you know, as a fielding team, you are one or two wickets away, and that's what happened.""With KKR currently at seventh position with nine points from ten matches, Rahane remains optimistic about their playoff chances. He reflected, ""That's always been the talk when we are not doing well. But again, it's in the past. For us, what's important is staying in the moment, taking confidence from this game and moving forward.""","Kolkata Knight Riders captain Ajinkya Rahane sustained a hand injury during their 14-run victory against Delhi Capitals.

Vaibhav Suryavanshi’s jaw-dropping century gotto hit the rewind button and recall exploits of other talented Indian cricketers who became teenage superstars.It’s a pity there is no official record of that mad game in Peshawar in Dec 1989. Bad light ensured that an ODI was converted to a 20-over exhibition match. A T20, a decade and a half before T20 was formally invented. Tendulkar, all of 16, walked in when India needed 69 runs from five overs to chase down Pakistan’s 157. He smashed Mushtaq Ahmed for two sixes, which prompted legendary Pakistani leggie Abdul Qadir to slip in the now-infamous barb, “Bachchon ko kyon mar rahe ho? Hamein bhi maar ke dikhao (why are you hitting kids? Hit my deliveries and show me).” The 16-year-old obliged, hitting Qadir for 6, 0, 4, 6, 6, 6. Tendulkar ended up with an 18-ball 53 and became the mood barometer of a cricket-mad nation for the next 25 years.Stories of a young Punjab southpaw depositing balls from Churchgate’s Oval maidan onto the streets had already started doing the rounds in Mumbai when he was training at the Vengsarkar academy. Yuvraj Singh, 18, son of former India pacer Yograj Singh, was a star of India’s victorious U-19 WC campaign in Sri Lanka, and made it to the Indian team. In the ICC KnockOut quarterfinal against Australia in Nairobi, he entered with India in trouble at 90/3. The power and punch that he generated while playing off the backfoot to pacers like Glenn McGrath, Brett Lee and Jason Gillespie left spectators awestruck. Yuvraj went on to become a great in white-ball cricket.You think only Pakistani magician Wasim Akram had the copyright to move an old ball? Search ‘Irfan Pathan + Adam Gilchrist + 2004 Sydney’. And, if you’re still in school, open your geometry textbook and continue studying the parabola. That is what this 19-yearold from Baroda produced to dismiss the savage Aussie batter. Changing his line of attack from round to over the wicket, Irfan drew Gilchrist forward, created a gap, got the ball to tail in at his toes very late and defeated Gilchrist’s defences to hit timber. It was sorcery. Fittingly, it was Bill Lawry’s roar of “bowled him, what a ripper” that called the moment.The ‘Boy Wonder’ before Sachin Tendulkar and the youngest to play for India in a Test as a 17-year-old in 1983, vs West Indies in Antigua. Twirling the ball from right to left, beating batters with dip and turn, Siva, as he was popularly called, looked as if he would be India’s next Chandra. Watch Javed Miandad’s stumping in the WCC final in 1985, or his setting up of Allan Lamb with a magical googly in the same tournament. A match haul of 12/181 vs England at the Wankhede in Nov 1984, two months prior to his Australia heroics, served ample notice of his talent. In a tragic loss for Indian cricket, his career went downhill from there on.With the nation still dealing with Sachin Tendulkar’s retirement at an emotional Wankhede a week ago, Prithvi Shaw seemed to have taken it upon himself to fill the void. Aged 14, he smashed 546 for Rizvi Springfield vs St. Francis d’ Assisi in a Harris Shield match in Nov 2013 at Azad Maidan, barely two kilometres away from Wankhede. Four years later, a hundred on Ranji debut vs Tamil Nadu in the semis followed. Six months later, he emulated Tendulkar to score a ton on Duleep Trophy debut. After leading India to the U-19 World Cup in New Zealand in Feb 2018, the world was at his feet. A ton on Test debut at Rajkot followed vs West Indies. Sadly, fame and off-field indiscretions saw him slip down the pecking order.","Sachin Tendulkar became the mood barometer of a cricket-mad nation for the next 25 years. Yuvraj Singh, 18, was a star of India’s victorious U-19 WC campaign in Sri Lanka, and made it to the Indian team.

NHL playoff controversy: Brandon Hagel injury raises questions about league's double standards,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-playoff-controversy-brandon-hagel-injury-raises-questions-about-leagues-double-standards/articleshow/120721046.cms,"Brandon Hagel's injury fuels outrage as NHL playoff officiating comes under fire (Image via: Getty Images)





Aaron Ekblad’s hit on Hagel ignites safety concerns



Lightning coach, fans frustrated by lack of discipline



“It’s getting tiresome answering questions about a hit every single game,”

What message is NHL sending?



It was supposed to be just another hard-fought battle in the heated Battle of Florida playoff series, but Game 4 between the Tampa Bay Lightning and Florida Panthers took a troubling turn when Brandon Hagel was forced out of the game after a high hit from Aaron Ekblad, a hit that surprisingly went unpenalized.Fans, analysts, and even players were left asking: where’s the consistency when it comes to player safety in the NHL playoffs?Midway through the second period, Hagel was skating along the boards, moving the puck out of the Lightning zone, when Panthers defenseman Aaron Ekblad delivered a high hit that made clear contact with Hagel’s head. The collision caused Hagel to hit the ice hard, the back of his head bouncing violently. Medical staff immediately pulled him due to concussion concerns. He did not return. And yet, there was no whistle. No penalty. No review.For a league that talks a big game about protecting its players, this was a major miss. The hit looked dangerous in real time and even worse in slow motion, yet it didn’t earn even a second glance from officials.Just one game earlier, Hagel himself was suspended for interference on Panthers captain Aleksander Barkov. The NHL ruled that Barkov wasn’t eligible to be hit, and Hagel made head contact. He was suspended one game, his first career suspension. Barkov returned the next game. Hagel, however, returned in Game 4, only to be taken out by a questionable hit with no consequence.Tampa Bay coach Jon Cooper didn’t hold back after the loss.he said bluntly, pointing out the lack of accountability.And he’s not wrong. The inconsistency in discipline especially during high-stakes games is becoming a glaring issue. While Brandon Hagel’s hit drew a suspension, Aaron Ekblad’s hit resulted in zero action from the NHL’s Department of Player Safety.Ekblad, ironically, just returned from a 20-game suspension for PED use. In his return, he scores a goal and delivers a hit that knocks out one of the league’s top two-way forwards and nothing happens.The Panthers lead the series 3-1, but the bigger story is the growing distrust in how the NHL handles dangerous plays, late hits, and controversial non-calls. This wasn’t just a missed call, it was a missed opportunity to uphold player safety, ensure accountability, and enforce fair standards across the league. Fans are demanding consistency, especially when star players are targeted with no repercussions.Also Read: Mike Sullivan out as Penguins Head Coach As Game 5 heads to Tampa, tensions are high. Fans, analysts, and players alike are wondering: Is the NHL truly serious about protecting its stars, or does the playoff spotlight mean the rulebook gets thrown out? Suspensions, penalties, and transparency are on the line.","Tampa Bay Lightning's Brandon Hagel was forced out of Game 4 after a high hit from Aaron Ekblad, a hit that surprisingly went unpenalized.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

NEW DELHI: Former Indian cricketer Ajay Jadeja has taken strong exception to Gujarat Titans skipper Shubman Gill ’s remarks about 14-year-old Rajasthan Royals sensation Vaibhav Suryavanshi .After the Royals chased down a big 210-run target with ease, thanks to Vaibhav’s record-breaking century , Gill stated that it was the youngster's day, saying, “It was his day. His hitting was tremendous, and he made full use of it.”Jadeja, visibly annoyed during the post-match broadcast on Star Sports, said, “A 14-year-old to have that much belief in himself… and then to say it was just a lucky day? That’s not giving enough credit.”He emphasised that Suryavanshi's brilliance deserved far more appreciation, especially given the age and pressure involved.Vaibhav Suryavanshi’s 101 off just 38 balls lit up the Sawai Mansingh Stadium. He smashed 11 sixes and 7 fours, reaching his century in 35 balls, becoming the second-fastest in IPL history and the fastest by any Indian in the league.He’s now the youngest player in IPL and T20 history to score a hundred, achieving the feat at just 14 years and 32 days old.His 166-run stand with Yashasvi Jaiswal is the highest ever for Rajasthan Royals in IPL history. The teenager has now scored 151 runs in three matches at an average of 75.50 and a strike rate over 222.Vaibhav’s performance is no fluke. He’s already represented India U-19 and made a mark in domestic cricket.From hitting a six off his first IPL ball to creating history, the youngster's journey is just beginning and deserves all the credit it can get.","Former Indian cricketer Ajay Jadeja has taken strong exception to Gujarat Titans skipper Shubman Gill ’s remarks about 14-year-old Rajasthan Royals sensation Vaibhav Suryavanshi.

What’s the tile game Meghan Markle played on Netflix? A beginner’s guide to mahjong,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/whats-the-tile-game-meghan-markle-played-on-netflix-a-beginners-guide-to-mahjong/articleshow/120736644.cms,"Meghan Markle played the game of Mahjong in her Netflix series

From the Qing dynasty to pop culture

How is mahjong played?

Connor Wan, a 29-year-old British-Chinese artist, learned mahjong while visiting family in Hong Kong. He enjoyed it so much that he started the Four Winds Mahjong Club in London, and later brought it to Toronto after moving there in 2024. “Moving countries is hard, especially when you don’t know anyone,” he said. The club became popular quickly, not as a place for gambling, but for making friends and celebrating Asian culture. Nicole Wong, a writer and audio producer from California, started playing mahjong as a teenager with her grandparents. She later began The Mahjong Project in 2019 to share the game’s cultural stories and organise pop-up game nights. This year, she published a book called Mahjong: House Rules from Across the Asian Diaspora. Nicole says the sound of the tiles is especially powerful. “Mahjong is more than just fun,” she says. “It has a deep history and brings back strong memories.” In Toronto, Robyn Feldberg has taught over 250 people how to play mahjong through her courses. She donates all the money—about $50,000 so far—to charities like Save A Child’s Heart. She says the game is especially popular with young mothers who want a fun way to relax and connect with others. “They tell me, ‘We want something that’s just for us,’” she said.

A centuries-old Chinese game called mahjong is having a modern revival across continents, from luxury cruise ships and trendy hotel lounges to Meghan Markle’s Netflix series.In the sixth episode of her docuseries With Love, the Duchess of Sussex invites friends for a cosy game night – playing mahjong, reports the Globe and Mail.The four-person tile-based game, traditionally associated with Chinese culture, is now catching on with new generations across the globe. “The game itself is really so fun,” says Markle. “But what was so great was the idea of learning something new with your friends, together... the mahjong becomes the background of the expansion of friendship. It’s the feeling of community.”Mahjong dates back to the mid-1800s during the Qing Dynasty in China. Traditionally played with 144 tiles, the game blends skill, strategy and a touch of luck. Players pick and discard tiles to form winning hands, much like the card game rummy.The game’s expansion across the world has now erupted into a full-blown trend. The World Mahjong Championship was recently held in Mississauga, Ontario – the first time it’s been hosted in North America. Hotels such as the Ace Hotel New York and Thompson Hotel Dallas regularly hold mahjong-themed nights.Fans with money to spare are buying fancy mahjong sets from Hermès, Louis Vuitton, and Ralph Lauren. Some are even splashing out on luxury tables that shuffle the tiles automatically – costing over $4,500.Even cruise ships have joined the trend, offering mahjong tournaments and special rooms just for playing the game.Mahjong is played with 144 tiles. Players begin by shuffling the tiles face down. Everyone rolls dice and the highest roller becomes the dealer. Each player picks 36 tiles and builds a wall—two rows of 18 tiles. The walls are pushed forward, creating a space in the middle for discards. Each player then draws 13 tiles (the dealer starts with 14), and the game begins.Players take turns drawing one tile and discarding one, always keeping 13 tiles in hand. You can draw a new tile or pick up someone’s discarded one. If a discarded tile helps complete a set (called a meld), you can grab it, announce the set, and show the tiles. To win, a player must have four melds (like three or four matching tiles or a sequence of three in a suit) and one pair (two matching tiles)—making 14 tiles total.There are five types of tiles: Bamboo, Characters, Dots (these are the three main suits), and special tiles called Honors (Dragons and Winds) and Bonus (Flowers and Seasons). Each suit goes from 1 to 9. Honors and Bonus tiles add extra excitement but aren't needed to win. Mahjong mixes strategy and memory with a bit of luck—and it’s all about building the right sets before your opponents do.For many mahjong fans, it’s not just a game but a deeply social experience.","Mahjong dates back to the mid-1800s during the Qing Dynasty in China.

Shah Rukh Khan: The superstar who turned IPL into a blockbuster

Delhi Capitals (DC) left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav was seen playfully slapping Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) Rinku Singh after their Indian Premier League (IPL) match at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Wednesday.The incident occurred after the match, during the customary interaction between players from both teams. Given that both Kuldeep and Rinku represent Uttar Pradesh, the slaps appeared to be friendly jabs exchanged in a light-hearted manner.In the match KKR defeated Delhi Capitals by 14 runs to keep their IPL play-off hopes alive.With this win, defending champions KKR reignited their playoff hopes, though they remained at the seventh spot with nine points. DC stayed in the top four with 12 points.Invited to bat, a collective batting effort helped KKR post 204 for 9.Their bowlers, led by Sunil Narine (3/29), then restricted the Capitals to 190/9 despite contributions by Faf du Plessis (62), Axar Patel (43) and Vipraj Nigam (38).Earlier, Young Angkrish Raghuvanshi (44) steadied the innings along with Rinku Singh (36), the duo adding 61 runs off 46 balls. Raghuvanshi struck two big sixes off Vipraj, while Rinku targeted Kuldeep Yadav, smashing two boundaries and a six in a 17-run over that helped KKR cross the 150-run mark.However, KKR lost the momentum again as both Raghuvanshi and Rinku departed in quick succession, falling to Chameera and Vipraj respectively, just when they looked set to accelerate.Andre Russell smashed two fours and a six to push KKR past the 200-mark, but the visitors lost three wickets in as many balls in the final over, with Starc picking up two in dramatic fashion.Mitchell Starc (3/43) picked up three wickets for the hosts, while spinners Axar 2/27 and Nigam (2/41) chipped in with two wickets apiece.",Kuldeep Yadav and Rinku Singh involved in light-hearted banter after DC vs KKR match.

A Father's Pride: How RR, Dravid & Vikram Shaped Vaibhav Suryavanshi

Everything is special about Vaibhav Suryavanshi: Vikram Rathour

A few years ago, the Bihar Cricket Association (BCA) faced an unusual predicament. A 12-year-old boy from Samastipur was emerging as a prodigious talent, but he couldn’t be played in the Bihar U-16 team due to BCCI rules introduced during the Covid era, which required players to be 14 years or older to qualify for the U-16 level.“I saw him for the first time when he was just 11 or 12 at the Gen Next Academy in Patna, where he was training under Manish Ojha , a former Bihar player. Due to the rules, we couldn’t pick him. Interestingly, those rules didn’t restrict him from playing for the U-19s. We approached BCA president Rakesh Tiwary and he told us, ‘If you’re convinced about his talent and future, go ahead and pick him, but just take care of him,’” said Ashok Kumar, head coach of Bihar’s senior team and former coach of the U-19 and U-23 sides.That boy was Vaibhav Suryavanshi , who, at the age of just 14, became the youngest-ever T20 centurion after smashing a 35-ball hundred against Gujarat Titans.“I told Vishnu Vardhan, the match referee at the Vinoo Mankad Trophy (U-19 One-dayers) in Chandigarh, that we had a talented 12-year-old called Vaibhav. Before our first match, against Assam, Vaibhav insisted on playing in the XI. I wanted him to debut against Manipur instead, but he said, ‘I’ll win you the match, sir.’ And he did, scoring 89. That attitude and intent stood out to me. He was different,” Ashok recalled.“Vishnu sent a recording of that innings to India U-19 chief selector S Sharath, who then sent a selector to watch Vaibhav play. Initially, the selector couldn’t believe he was from Bihar! He thought we’d recruited him from Delhi. Vaibhav scored 148 in that match against Haryana, though we fell short chasing 270. He was upset at the loss, but his journey had begun.“Vaibhav was then picked for the BCCI’s U-19 Challenger Trophy, then the U-19 Quadrangular, though he didn’t get a game and was disappointed. But eventually, he got his chance in the ‘test’ matches against Australia (Sept 2024). I told him, ‘Whether it’s one-day or test, don’t change your aggressive approach. That’s your biggest strength. If you stop attacking, your game will collapse.’ On his U-19 Test debut, he scored a 58-ball ton, the fastest by an Indian U-19 player,” said Ashok.At the 2024 ACC U-19 Asia Cup, Suryavanshi scored 76 off 46 balls against the UAE and followed it up with 67 off 36 balls against Sri Lanka in the semifinal. His childhood coach, Manish Ojha, told TOI from Patna, “He was eight when I started coaching him. He’s a god-gifted, natural talent. He loves playing his strokes. I helped him channel that into becoming an attacking batsman. His six-hitting ability is incredible. If he continues like this, I see him playing for India in two years.”Seeing his high backlift, it’s not hard to identify his cricketing idol. “Vaibhav idolises Brian Lara . He attacks like Lara did — regardless of the bowler’s reputation — and his high backlift mirrors Lara’s. All 16 IPL sixes have come against international bowlers,” Jha noted.Incidentally, Vaibhav made his Ranji Trophy debut when he was 12 years old.","Vaibhav Suryavanshi is the youngest-ever T20 centurion for Rajasthan Royals. At the age of just 14, he became the youngest ever T20 century for Gujarat Titans. He is set to play for India in two Test matches against Australia in 2024.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120749048,imgsize-145502,width-400,resizemode-4/Jaipur-Rajasthan-Royals-Vaibhav-Suryavanshi-reacts-after-his-dismissal-during-.jpg"

A Father's Pride: How RR, Dravid & Vikram Shaped Vaibhav Suryavanshi

Among the fast-growing list of Vaibhav Suryavanshi admirers are former Australia players Michael Hussey and James Hopes, currently on coaching duties in the IPL. Chennai Super Kings batting coach Hussey reserved high praise for Vaibhav, saying that the 14-year-old pocket dynamite brought back memories of legendary Adam Gilchrist ’s thrill-a-minute performances. “It was incredible, was it not? There are some of these players who come along and when they are batting in the middle, you do not want to miss a ball,” said Hussey on Tuesday.“When Gilchrist walked out to bat, the whole Australian team would come to the viewing area to watch the game, because such players are just so exciting. I felt the same watching this young kid. Seeing him score a century off 30-odd balls was amazing to watch,” added Hussey.Hussey is “blown away” by Vaibhav’s enviable ability to go after the bowlers without dwelling on their reputation. On Monday, the youngster took the India internationals, including veteran Ishant Sharma, to the cleaners during his jaw-dropping knock.“Him and Yashasvi Jaiswal batting together was breathtaking. It is reckless at times, but it is so exciting to watch. To be able to play like that, against some of the best bowlers, it just blows your mind,” said Hussey, warning that Vaibhav should be surrounded by the right people to move in the right direction. “His life and world have changed forever now. He is going to be on such a high probably for weeks or months. He will need good people around him to guide him. He is very lucky to have Rahul Dravid (RR head coach) and some good senior players.”Punjab fast-bowling coach Hopes hailed the fearlessness of ‘Gen Z’ batters. “It was hard to take my eyes off it. These kids in general play a different game. They come up against the Kohlis and Dhonis of the world but they do not have any fear. Indian cricket is well placed, especially in the white-ball formats,” said Hopes, adding, “We do have such talent in Australia, but they do not get exposed at a young age like they do here. We do not have as many teams. We have only six domestic teams.”",Rajasthan Royals' Vaibhav Suryavanshi scored a century against Gujarat Titans.

The first delivery set the tone: Russell launched it down the ground for a monstrous 106-metre six, bringing the crowd to its feet and KKR past the 200-run mark.Starc followed up with a high short ball that was called a wide. DC reviewed it but lost it. The next delivery yielded a leg-bye, bringing Rovman Powell on strike, who was trapped LBW.

Fewest innings taken by an Indian player to score an IPL ton

On Sunday, Vaibhav Suryavanshi became the youngest centurion in men's T20 cricket and smashed the second fastest ton in the history of the Indian Premier League (IPL).The 14-year-old raced away to a century off just 35 balls in just his third IPL 2025 match. His knock was studded with 11 sixes and seven fours and Rajasthan Royals chased down a 209-run target in 15.5 overs.“It is a very good feeling. It’s my first hundred in the IPL and it’s my third innings. The result has shown here after the practice before the tournament,” the player of the match, Suryavanshi, said.“I just see the ball and play.

Ye bola tha maarunga. But pata nahi tha aise maarega

[Has it ever happened that you hit a six on the very first ball?] - this was the innocent, yet striking, question young Vaibhav Suryavanshi posed to a teammate just days before making his IPL debut . Who would have thought that a youngster would probe such a question. Maybe it was an insight into the mind of the 14-year-old?The match was against the Lucknow Super Giants. One of India's finest bowlers, Avesh Khan, had the ball in hand. Yashasvi Jaiswal took the strike, nudged a single, and handed over the stage to Suryavanshi. What followed was straight out of a dream — the 14-year-old launched the very first ball of his IPL career for a six, announcing his arrival with a bang.Did he manifest it? Maybe. Was it a fluke? Possibly. But let’s move to another telling moment.It’s 10 am on Monday, April 28th. Suryavanshi wakes up and makes his first call — to his childhood coach Manish Ojha. After a few exchanges about footwork and technique, Suryavanshi confidently tells him, """" (Sir, today I will smash the bowlers).[Hit (the ball), but don’t lose your wicket. Play calmly, keep talking to Yashasvi],"" the coach said.In the evening, Suryavanshi padded up, left the dugout, exchanged a fist bump with Yashasvi — and the rest, as they say, is history.The young boy’s manifestation once again came true.The 14-year-old prodigy from Samastipur, Bihar, blazed his way to a sensational 38-ball 101, becoming the youngest centurion in IPL history at just 14 years and 32 days.In a breathtaking assault at a packed Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur, Suryavanshi hammered 11 sixes and 7 fours, dismantling an attack featuring international stars like Ishant Sharma, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Washington Sundar, Rashid Khan and Karim Janat.While the crowd grew hoarse from endless cheering, Suryavanshi showed no signs of slowing down, making a mockery of some of the world’s best bowlers.The left-hander brought up his century off just 35 balls against Gujarat Titans , prompting a heartwarming moment — an injured Rahul Dravid , India’s ex-coach, rose from his wheelchair, fists pumping in celebration. Dravid cheered with uncontained joy, savouring the historic moment crafted by the young opener.[He had said he would hit it. But I didn’t know he would hit it like that]. I had an instinct that something big was going to happen, but honestly, I didn’t expect it to be this big. He is a God-gifted cricketer. He’s just a kid — only 14 years old. God has blessed him with immense talent. I am really thankful to God that I could play some part in his career,"" coach Ojha said.""He always says that Rajasthan Royals have given him a huge platform, and he is determined to work hard, play well, and give his best. His ultimate dream is to play for India. He is just 14. The great Sachin Tendulkar made his ODI debut at 16, and I am sure Vaibhav is on the right path. With a legend like Rahul Dravid guiding him, he doesn’t have to worry about anything,"" the coach said.","The 14-year-old prodigy from Samastipur, Bihar, blazed his way to a sensational 38-ball 101, becoming the youngest centurion in IPL history at just 14 years and 32 days.

NEW DELHI: There has been a lot of chatter among cricket fans regarding Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) owner Sanjiv Goenka 's strict approach. Many believe Goenka demands strong results from his team. The discussions intensified recently after Goenka’s interactions with Rishabh Pant following LSG’s defeats sparked fresh speculation.The conversation around Goenka’s involvement began last year when he was seen having a heated discussion with then-captain KL Rahul after LSG’s heavy loss to SunRisers Hyderabad. Eventually, KL Rahul moved on from LSG and joined Delhi Capitals for the IPL 2025 season.However, former LSG spinner Amit Mishra offered clarification, describing Goenka as a friendly and approachable figure who simply wants the best for his team.""I spoke to the coach last season, and he told me that captain KL Rahul was doing all the work. He was making the 11s, making all the changes, and planning. But this year, I don't feel like that. This year, after Zaheer Khan has come, I feel like he is talking to everyone. If you see, there is a discussion going on, they are talking to each other. With Digvesh Rathi the coach was talking,"" Mishra said on Cricbuzz.""If you talk about the owner, I never felt he was too involved. Of course, he wanted the team to win. But we did lose matches and after that he never talked loudly or said anything wrong. I feel that the media has shown a little too much. I didn't feel that there was anything negative like that. But if there is any owner, he says that losing is okay, but just go out there and show some fight.""Fight and lose, I have no problem. This is what people told me. This is what happened. Even after losing badly in Kolkata and Hyderabad, the owner came into the dressing room and motivated the team. He never said anything wrong or in a very high tone,"" he further added.As things stand, LSG are sixth on the points table with 5 wins and 5 losses from 10 matches.",There has been a lot of chatter among cricket fans regarding Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) owner Sanjiv Goenka's strict approach.
