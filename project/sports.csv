NEW DELHI: The sentiment for a boycott of the joint parliamentary committee (JPC) on the bill on dismissal of jailed ministers is growing, with Communist Party of India (CPI) on Tuesday saying that the parliamentary panels are a sham and serve no purpose under BJP govt. The CPI stance after boycott decision by four opposition parties will increase the pressure on Congress to follow suit.CPI MP Sandosh Kumar said the JPC on Waqf bill has proven lucidly that such panels are just an attempt to show collective scrutiny of the bill when they are actually an eyewash. “There was a time when members on the JPC could summon documents, scrutinise details and then make contributions. Now, the opposition’s suggestions are rejected out of hand. The JPC on Waqf bill is an example. It is of no value,” he told TOI .While the Left parties don’t have the strength to be in the parliamentary panels and depend on the govt’s goodwill to find a place in them, the CPI opinion carries weight since it could be seen as representative of other smaller Left constituents.The sentiment of an integral part of the opposition INDIA bloc follows announcements by TMC, Samajwadi Party, Sena UBT and AAP that they will not participate in the JPC that is being formed to scrutinise the controversial bills, including the constitutional amendment.The offensive from the bigger INDIA bloc parties has forced Congress to take a relook at its inclination to join the proposed JPC in the interest of opposition unity. There is regret in Congress that compulsion of unity may nudge the party into following the cue of TMC-SP-Shiv Sena, arguing it will result in complications for the future, as well as when the three controversial bills come up in the parliament for discussion.Many key INDIA bloc parties like DMK, NCP (SP) and CPM have not spoken out yet, since they seem to be waiting for Congress to take a final decision. A Left outfit MP said no party would want to stand alone on the issue that will be viewed as a test of unity of the bloc.This has triggered speculation that a complete opposition boycott of the JPC is possible. While this marks a major division in the anti-BJP ranks, for a change it is not a split that ends up favouring BJP, but one of competitive hostility to the govt’s initiative. “We have to know how far we should go, because these are important issues where some points have to be put on record,” a pro-JPC MP said.",CPI MP Sandosh Kumar said the JPC on Waqf bill has proven lucidly that such panels are just an attempt to show collective scrutiny of the bill when they are actually an eyewash.

Darryl ‘Buster’ Skrine accused of running $300K fraud across States

Buster Skrine’s NFL legacy tarnished by fraud allegations

Former NFL cornerback Darryl “Buster” Skrine has once again found himself in legal trouble after being arrested in Georgia on Wednesday. Authorities confirmed the 36-year-old faces 18 charges, including identity fraud, deposit account fraud, theft by taking, and financial transaction card fraud. Police allege that Skrine targeted women through online dating platforms, convincing them to send money under false pretenses.Investigators claim Skrine told women he was in financial distress and promised to repay them through his NFL annuity. Instead, the former defensive back allegedly funneled the money into luxury expenses such as Airbnbs, travel, and gift cards. So far, victims from Wisconsin, North Carolina, and New York have been identified, with combined losses estimated at $300,000. Officials believe more victims could emerge as the probe expands nationwide.The arrest in Georgia adds to Skrine’s ongoing legal battles. Canadian authorities have pursued him since May 2024, when he skipped a court appearance in a separate fraud case and removed his GPS tracker. Skrine was previously detained in August 2023 at Toronto’s Pearson International Airport on fraud-related charges, accused of depositing counterfeit checks and withdrawing $100,000 before disappearing.Roswell police confirmed they are working with Canadian officials to ensure Skrine is held accountable in both countries. The case has now taken on international significance, further damaging the image of a player who once built his reputation on the NFL field.Skrine’s fall from grace has been swift and dramatic. Drafted in the fifth round in 2011 by the Cleveland Browns, he went on to play for the New York Jets, Chicago Bears, San Francisco 49ers, and Tennessee Titans. Over 11 seasons, he earned nearly $40 million and finished his career with 491 solo tackles, 10 interceptions, six forced fumbles, and 3.5 sacks across 157 games. He retired in 2022, remembered as a hard-hitting cornerback with consistent performances.Also Read: Travis Kelce goes from NFL star to fashion icon with American Eagle collaboration after engagement to Taylor Swift Today, however, Skrine’s career is overshadowed by fraud charges that span two countries.

With investigations widening, authorities believe more victims could still come forward, leaving Skrine facing a long and uncertain legal road ahead.","Darryl ‘Buster’ Skrine accused of running $300K fraud across States.

Dwyane Wade declares Michael Beasley’s talent undeniable as the NBA keeps turning its back,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/dwyane-wade-declares-michael-beasleys-talent-undeniable-as-the-nba-keeps-turning-its-back/articleshow/123566039.cms,"Dwyane Wade attend the MVAAFF Men's C-Suite Luncheon at Harbor View Hotel (Image via Getty Images)

Dwyane Wade praises Michael Beasley after Miami 305 wins Big3 championship

Mario F*cking Chalmers!

Minnesota Timberwolves breakout season proves Michael Beasley can carry a team

The three-time NBA champion and a Hall of Famer, Miami Heat icon Dwyane Wade has undergone all the pleasures of being in locker rooms with such legends as LeBron James , Chris Bosh, and Shaquille O’Neal and has developed his own legacy of being fast, a leader and at the right moment. Most recently, Wade stirred the waters with a bold commentary concerning a one-time co-worker who took a different path in his career: Michael Beasley . Wade declared Beasley as being one of the most talented players that would not be in the NBA today which sparked debate of untapped talent and the ugly reality of the league.Dwyane Wade shared his thoughts on ""The Timeout,"" a show on his YouTube channel where he dives into basketball topics with a blend of nostalgia and insight. This episode came out recently, right after Michael Beasley's impressive performance in the Big3 league—a 3-on-3 basketball competition started by rapper Ice Cube back in 2017.Dwyane Wade was giving a ""shoutout"" to Beasley, who played a key role in leading his team, Miami 305, to a championship win against the Chicago Triplets with a score of 52-48. In that match, Beasley scored 25 points, grabbed 12 rebounds, and dished out three assists, wrapping up a season where he snagged the Big3 MVP award for the second consecutive year.Wade's full quote was passionate and direct: ""Shoutout to Michael Beasley. You hear a lot of guys say this. Michael Beasley is probably the most talented basketball player who’s not in the NBA. When you think about how talented he is, you don’t understand why he’s not in the NBA.You understand maybe he might not be a star, but you don’t understand why he’s not in the league because of the talent that young man has in his body. ""He conveyed this message to his viewers on the show, stressing Beasley's innate skills while admitting the frustrations linked to his lack of presence in the NBA.In a similar vein, on his podcast ""The Why with Dwyane Wade"", Dwyane Wade elaborated further, noting that Beasley has endured significant challenges ""mentally, physically, spiritually, emotionally."" He shared that Beasley once felt like he was ""walking on eggshells"" to blend in and seize chances, but these days he looks a lot more relaxed with who he is in other leagues.Dwyane Wade's timing with the praise was spot on. Just last week, Beasley took home the Big3 championship, delivering a vital assist for the winning basket in the final. This victory marked his fourth season in the league and reinforced his position as one of the top players.The Big3, featuring former NBA players in a fast-paced, half-court game, has provided Beasley with a chance to highlight his abilities without the grind of an 82-game NBA schedule. His back-to-back MVP titles in 2024 and 2025 show that he still has plenty of energy left at the age of 36.Beasley's road to this moment has been quite the ride. Coming out of Kansas State University in 2008, he was a college superstar, averaging 26.2 points and 12.4 rebounds per game in his freshman year.The Miami Heat chose him second overall in the NBA Draft, right after Derrick Rose. The hype was immense; scouts considered him a scoring dynamo with All-Star potential. During his rookie season (2008-09), he averaged 13.9 points off the bench for the Heat, displaying flashes of brilliance next to Dwyane Wade.Michael Beasley lived a life full of injury, poor performance, and off-the-court issues, including alleged mental health and drug problems. He was eventually traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves in 2010, to allow the Heat to have the so-called era of the Big Three with LeBaron and Bosh.In 2010-11, his breakout season, he averaged 19.2 points per game, but was unable to sustain that. He then got spells with the Phoenix Suns, back to the Heat in 2013 and 2015 and played with the Houston Rockets, Milwaukee Bucks, New York Knicks and finally the Los Angeles Lakers in 2018-19. In 609 NBA games Beasley had an average of 12.4 points, 4.7 rebounds, and 1.3 assists, playing 25 games in the playoffs, and never having received a championship ring.Also Read: The Los Angeles Lakers are quietly plotting the most aggressive roster change of the modern NBA era Michael Beasley's tale is packed with what-ifs, yet it's far from concluded. His strong performance in the Big3 indicates he's still a significant player, and Dwyane Wade's endorsement could pave the way for new chances—possibly even an invite to a training camp. Right now, Beasley looks happy, enjoying basketball on his own terms.","Dwyane Wade praises Michael Beasley after Miami 305 wins Big3 championship.

Dan Orlovsky breaks down how Dillon Gabriel’s unexpected arm strength gave him the edge over Shedeur Sanders,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/dan-orlovsky-breaks-down-how-dillon-gabriels-unexpected-arm-strength-gave-him-the-edge-over-shedeur-sanders/articleshow/123566377.cms,"Dan Orlovsky breaks down on Dillon Gabriel’s unexpected arm strength (Image credits: IG/X)

The key moment and skill that made Dillon Gabriel the Browns’ backup over Shedeur Sanders

Dan Orlovsky says Spencer Rattler 'should ABSOLUTLEY' be the Saints starting QB | NFL Live

Preseason film reveals a quarterback who thinks fast, moves with poise, and delivers under pressure

Gabriel’s college experience and leadership instincts make him a reliable choice behind Deshaun Watson

Shedeur Sanders remains a rising talent learning from veterans while preparing for future opportunities

Why Orlovsky believes film study and subtle skills like arm strength can change an NFL QB battle

Cleveland Browns fans got an insider look at the quarterback battle this preseason as Dillon Gabriel earned the backup role over Shedeur Sanders. While Sanders entered with media attention and collegiate hype, Gabriel’s calm pocket presence, quick decision-making, and polished gameplay impressed coaches and analysts alike. Former NFL quarterback Dan Orlovsky explained exactly why Gabriel’s performance stood out, revealing the surprising factor that helped him secure the job.Orlovsky was particularly impressed by Gabriel’s preseason tape from weeks two and three. “So the tape from week two of the preseason or week three of the preseason was very good. I think he plays really fast, he moves in the pocket very efficiently. And the one thing that maybe was unexpected was the arm strength was pretty significant,” he said. Gabriel’s ability to combine speed, accuracy, and pocket mobility made him impossible to overlook, giving the Browns a reliable backup behind starter Deshaun Watson.Gabriel’s mental sharpness stood out as much as his physical skills. He reads defenses quickly, stays calm in tight pockets, and delivers accurate throws even under pressure. Orlovsky highlighted these traits as critical, noting that Gabriel’s poise and quick processing allowed him to make plays that many expected only from seasoned NFL quarterbacks.Gabriel brings extensive college experience from UCF and Oklahoma, where he displayed leadership and tactical awareness in high-pressure games. Orlovsky noted that these experiences translate directly to the NFL, giving coaches confidence in his ability to step in without hesitation. Head coach Kevin Stefanski praised Gabriel’s consistent improvement during camp, reinforcing that his combination of football IQ and leadership made him the top choice for the backup role.While Gabriel claimed the backup spot, Shedeur Sanders’ potential remains undeniable. Orlovsky noted that Sanders’ transition to the NFL pace is still underway. Sanders will continue developing on the practice squad under the mentorship of Joe Flacco and Gabriel, learning professional nuances and preparing to compete for a larger role in the future. The Browns’ strategy balances immediate stability with long-term development at quarterback.For Orlovsky, Gabriel’s arm strength was the most unexpected but decisive factor. Beyond velocity, it was timing, accuracy, and the ability to make throws from tight pockets that set him apart. Analysts agree that these subtle but critical skills tipped the scales in Cleveland’s decision, demonstrating how detailed film study and overlooked attributes can determine roster outcomes in the NFL.In the end, Orlovsky’s analysis shows why Gabriel’s combination of skill, poise, and unexpectedly strong arm made him the Browns’ top backup option. For fans, it’s a reminder that NFL roster decisions are often shaped as much by nuanced performance insights as by hype, with Gabriel ready to contribute immediately and Sanders set to rise in the future.Also read: Chicago Bears fifth-round rookie Zah Frazier will sit out 2025 season after personal issue emerges","Former NFL quarterback Dan Orlovsky explains why Dillon Gabriel won the Browns' backup quarterback job.

High cost could define the Edmonton Oilers’ goaltending trade strategy



The Edmonton Oilers are under growing pressure to solve their goaltending question. After falling short in recent playoff runs, the organization faces a decision: stay patient with their current tandem or pay heavily for an established starter. Trade chatter now suggests Edmonton could part with high-value pieces if the right opportunity arises.Goaltending has been a sore spot for the Oilers in recent years. Stuart Skinner has shown flashes of promise. But inconsistency has made it difficult for Edmonton to feel secure in high-pressure moments. Backup options have also failed to ease the load, leaving the franchise vulnerable in the postseason.The Toronto Maple Leafs are one of the teams drawing interest. With multiple goaltenders under contract, Toronto may be open to moving one if the return is strong. Joseph Woll and Ilya Samsonov provide flexibility, and Edmonton’s need could push them into the conversation.Beyond Toronto, Edmonton is eyeing other potential trade partners. The Carolina Hurricanes boast a tandem of Frederik Andersen and Pyotr Kochetkov, both capable of starting roles. The New Jersey Devils have Vitek Vanecek and Akira Schmid, giving them depth that could appeal to teams in need.The cost of acquiring a starter-level goalie is expected to be steep. Edmonton may need to part with top prospects or multiple draft picks to secure a reliable name. Teams with surplus goaltending know the Oilers’ urgency, which could drive prices higher.Still, the Oilers are under pressure to act. With their championship window tied to McDavid and Draisaitl, the franchise cannot afford another season derailed by inconsistent goaltending. If desperation sets in, Edmonton may finally break from its cautious approach and swing big.Also Read: Toronto Maple Leafs prospects: Easton Cowan, Ben Danford, and Noah Chadwick lead the way",The Edmonton Oilers are under growing pressure to solve their goaltending question.

“We continue to grieve the loss of our Dad, a man defined not only by his role as owner of the Colts, but also by his resilience, his personal struggles, and his deep love for family, friends, and community. Throughout his life, our Dad was open about his battles with addiction and mental health.

He never claimed to be perfect. Instead, he used his voice to reduce stigma and advocate for those facing similar challenges, with honesty, vulnerability, and compassion.

“We understand the public interest in his life and legacy. While we respect the role of responsible journalism, we decline to comment on the allegations in your inquiry. The media is not the place to address inquiries about information which is disputed, lacks essential context, or involves private medical matters.

Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay, who passed away on May 21, 2025, at the age of 65, had been struggling in secret with a relapse in the final years of his life, according to a new investigation by The Washington Post. The report says Irsay was receiving opioids and later ketamine from his recovery doctor, while team executives and people close to him kept his condition hidden from the public. He was found dead in a luxury hotel in Beverly Hills, California, where he often stayed.The Washington Post investigation, published on August 28, 2025, shared accounts from five people with direct knowledge of Jim Irsay’s relapse. They said they saw him taking opioid pills, and four of them said they personally witnessed him receive ketamine injections.The report explained that Irsay’s health issues had long been presented as something else publicly, including statements from the Colts organization, but in reality, he had suffered several overdoses in the past few years.The Post found evidence of three overdoses before his death: once in Turks and Caicos in 2020, when he had to be flown by air ambulance for treatment; another in December 2023 at his Carmel, Indiana home, where police listed the case as an overdose; and a third 12 days later in Florida, when he was rushed to a hospital from a resort near Miami.After that Florida incident, Irsay was flown to Ascension St. Vincent Hospital in Indianapolis, where he spent nearly four months recovering. Even after this, he continued to receive prescriptions from Dr. Harry Haroutunian, an addiction specialist based in California.

Jacksonville Jaguars rookie cornerback Travis Hunter may be preparing for his first NFL season, but much of the talk around him this offseason hasn’t been about football. Instead, social media chatter around Hunter’s personal life – specifically his relationship with Leanna Lenee – has taken center stage. Online trolling exploded in recent weeks, with many fans questioning Lenee’s intentions and loyalty. The backlash grew intense enough that Lenee acknowledged how deeply the negativity affected her mental health. Despite the noise, she never left Hunter’s side.Amid all the drama, Travis Hunter’s mother, Ferrante Edmonds, showed why she’s been a pillar of strength in his life. Known for her loyalty and support, Edmonds didn’t jump into the controversy – but she didn’t stay completely silent either. She posted a simple but loving message to her son, that read, “I love you, baby @db3_tip, on to the next level. I’m so proud of you.”When the online heat ramped up, Edmonds had said, “Everything that is said doesn’t need to be addressed.” In another post, she doubled down on the idea of protecting peace, “Until it’s done. Tell no one.” In today’s online-first world, where every move is documented and shared, Edmonds’ message struck a chord with fans.She urged her son – and others – to guard their blessings, stay grounded and let actions speak louder than words.While most couples might clap back, Hunter and Lenee reacted with something more powerful. They welcomed a baby boy – turning a wave of hate into a season of joy. In a heartfelt message announcing the birth, Lenee shared, “He was crying, he was perfect.” She called the moment a “wave of peace” that made everything else fade away.Jacksonville Jaguars rookie and Heisman Trophy winner Travis Hunter and his wife, Leanna Lenee, quietly announced the arrival of their first child – a baby boy – in a heartfelt YouTube video titled “Dear Son…”, on August 27. The nearly three-minute clip traces their private journey, beginning with a pregnancy test and revealing they were expecting a boy – before transitioning to ultrasound shots, behind-the-scenes moments and intimate delivery footage that ends with the baby’s first cries. In the video, Hunter said he hopes his son will grow up to be like him – or even better – and in the delivery room, he said, “That baby look just like me!”Now, with their baby boy in their arms, they’ve entered a new chapter.","Travis Hunter and Leanna Lenee welcomed their first child, a baby boy, on August 27.

Cincinnati Bengals double down on Ja’Marr Chase and Tee Higgins as NFL shifts back to the run game,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/cincinnati-bengals-double-down-on-jamarr-chase-and-tee-higgins-as-nfl-shifts-back-to-the-run-game/articleshow/123563709.cms,"Ja’Marr Chase and Tee Higgins (Getty Images)

Beyond the money: Ja’Marr Chase and Tee Higgins share a rare bond off the field

Why the Bengals believe this duo changes everything

The NFL may be shifting back toward run-heavy offenses, but in Cincinnati, the Bengals are doubling down on the passing game—and on the dynamic duo of Ja’Marr Chase and Tee Higgins. Both wideouts inked massive extensions earlier this year, with Chase signing a four-year, $161 million deal and Higgins landing $115 million over four years. Together, they now form the highest-paid wide receiver tandem in league history.What makes this partnership unique isn’t just their talent, but the relationship they’ve built beyond football. From shopping for exotic cars in Florida to hosting “Taco Tuesday” gatherings for teammates, Chase and Higgins embody a chemistry that’s shaping the Bengals’ locker room culture. Higgins, who jokes about turning a wall in his new Florida home into a jellyfish tank, and Chase, who admits he’s tired of being asked to perform the Griddy, share a friendship rooted in honesty and accountability.Higgins recalls a moment when Chase mistakenly set up a play that left him blindsided. Chase didn’t sugarcoat it, walking over to say simply, “S---. My f---ing bad, bro.” For both players, that honesty became a building block for trust—a rare trait in a position group often plagued by ego.On the field, their impact is undeniable. Chase’s ability to command double coverage opens lanes for Higgins, while Higgins’ presence prevents defenses from focusing solely on Chase. As offensive coordinator Dan Pitcher noted, “Literally any time Ja’Marr makes a play against single coverage you can make a case that he’s only seeing single coverage because Tee is also on the field.”Also Read: “People don’t appreciate”: Greg Olsen sparks debate with bold defense of Aaron Rodgers after failed Jets stint The NFL may be leaning back toward the ground game, but the Bengals are betting that the Chase-Higgins connection—equal parts production and unselfishness—can carry them past Kansas City and toward a Super Bowl",Ja’Marr Chase and Tee Higgins are the highest-paid wide receiver tandem in league history.

Oldest living person in the world : Career and international life



Ethel Caterham: The world’s oldest living person witnessing a century of change



Ethel Caterham: Family, lifestyle, and what her longevity inspiring the world



Also Read |

Ethel Caterham, a British centenarian residing in Lightwater, Surrey, has officially become the world’s oldest living person at 116 years old. Born on 21 August 1909, Caterham has lived through some of the most transformative events in modern history, including the Titanic disaster, the Russian Revolution, and both World Wars. She is also the last surviving subject of King Edward VII, representing a living connection to early 20th-century British monarchy. Recognised by King Charles III with a birthday card in 2024, Caterham’s milestone has captured global attention. Her story highlights the remarkable combination of longevity, resilience, and historical perspective, inspiring people worldwide to reflect on the extraordinary possibilities of human life, the evolution of society, and the enduring spirit of individuals who witness over a century of change.Ethel Caterham was born in Shipton Bellinger, Hampshire, as the second youngest of eight siblings. Growing up in a large family in early 20th-century England meant learning responsibility, cooperation, and resilience from an early age. Raised in Tidworth, Wiltshire, she witnessed a rural way of life during a time of social change and industrial expansion. Her childhood coincided with technological advances like the spread of electricity and the automobile, shaping the early experiences of a girl who would live through over a century of innovation.These formative years likely influenced her adaptability and endurance—traits that contribute significantly to longevity and reflect an era where perseverance, community values, and resourcefulness were essential for survival in challenging circumstances.As a teenager, Caterham worked as an au pair in India, an experience that not only broadened her cultural understanding but also introduced her to independence and responsibility at a young age. As reported by BBC, later in life, she moved to Hong Kong and Gibraltar, accompanying her husband Norman, who served as a lieutenant colonel in the British Army. These postings exposed her to diverse climates, cuisines, languages, and social customs, fostering mental agility and adaptability—qualities that studies suggest are linked to longer life expectancy. Living abroad during politically and socially dynamic periods also provided her with firsthand knowledge of global events, enriching her personal and historical perspective.Ethel Caterham’s life spans some of the most significant events of the last century. Born three years before the Titanic sank in 1912, she experienced the societal upheaval of the Russian Revolution in 1917 and lived through both World Wars. As reported, she has witnessed the rise and fall of empires, the advent of commercial aviation, the digital revolution, and major advances in medicine. Caterham’s personal story reflects the resilience and adaptability of individuals living through periods of profound uncertainty and change. Being a living archive of these events, she offers a unique perspective on how human society evolves over time.Caterham’s extraordinary longevity has been officially recognized by the British royal family. King Charles III sent her a birthday card to celebrate her 115th birthday in 2024, a gesture highlighting both her personal achievements and her historical significance. Such recognition is rare and symbolic, connecting Caterham to a lineage that stretches back to King Edward VII. The acknowledgment of her life by the monarchy underscores the cultural and historical importance of longevity and demonstrates society’s admiration for those who live exceptionally long lives.Now living in a care home in Lightwater, Surrey, Caterham enjoys her days surrounded by family and close friends. According to her care home, she prefers to celebrate birthdays quietly, at her own pace, reflecting a peaceful and stress-free lifestyle that research shows can support longevity. Her family has expressed gratitude for the outpouring of public interest and kind messages, emphasizing the role of emotional support, social connection, and family bonding in maintaining mental and physical health in extreme old age.While Caterham is the oldest living person today, the record for the verified oldest human remains with Frenchwoman Jeanne Louise Calment, who lived to 122 years and 164 days. Caterham’s age, however, is still remarkable, placing her among the very few documented centenarians to surpass 115. Her life contributes valuable insights into the factors associated with longevity, including genetics, lifestyle, adaptability, and mental resilience. Researchers studying supercentenarians like Caterham aim to understand how humans can live longer, healthier lives, offering inspiration and guidance for aging populations worldwide.","Ethel Caterham, a British centenarian residing in Lightwater, Surrey, has officially become the world’s oldest living person at 116 years old.

How Joe Gibbs turned early defeats into a Super Bowl-winning NFL dynasty

From football playbooks to NASCAR checkered flags, Gibbs reinvented winning

The rare sponsorship story that shows Gibbs’ culture of loyalty

Why Denny Hamlin’s two decades with Gibbs define racing loyalty

A legacy that goes beyond trophies and lives in lasting loyalty

Youth For Tomorrow

Joe Gibbs has been called a mastermind, a strategist, even a genius. But the truest measure of his legacy is not just the Super Bowls or the NASCAR titles. It is the loyalty he inspired — from quarterbacks and pit crews to billion-dollar sponsors — that made him the rare architect of dynasties across two very different worlds.When Gibbs took over Washington’s NFL team in 1981, few expected greatness. His debut season opened with five painful defeats. Yet, instead of folding, he rallied his men, rewrote the playbook, and built a team that refused to quit. In just two years, he was hoisting the Lombardi Trophy.What set him apart was not only strategy but connection. Over 16 seasons, he won three Super Bowls — each with a different quarterback. “Coach Gibbs made you believe you could be the one,” former players often recall. That belief turned ordinary men into champions and a city into believers.In 1992, Gibbs walked away from the NFL spotlight to chase an untested dream: NASCAR ownership. He had never driven competitively, never run a team. But he knew how to build trust. With Interstate Batteries backing him, Joe Gibbs Racing was born.Just a year later, Dale Jarrett gave the team its first Daytona 500 win.More victories followed, but what endured was the culture Gibbs planted. He didn’t run garages like factories — he ran them like families. “You felt like you were building something that mattered,” one crew member reflected. That sense of belonging became JGR’s fuel.Modern sports sponsorships are notoriously fleeting. Yet, Gibbs forged one of the longest partnerships in NASCAR history. Interstate Batteries, his very first backer, is still with JGR more than 30 years later.“Joe Gibbs Racing gave Interstate Batteries national recognition,” company leaders often say, but the truth runs deeper: Gibbs gave them trust. In an era of quick exits and shifting allegiances, his ability to nurture loyalty turned business deals into lifelong bonds.The loyalty story finds its purest expression in Denny Hamlin. Signed by Gibbs as a young driver, Hamlin has now spent 20 years under the same banner — an eternity in modern racing. This July, he extended that bond with a new multi-year contract.“It is just really special when you think about everything we’ve experienced over the past 20 years,” Gibbs said when the deal was announced. In Hamlin’s 58 Cup wins and three Daytona 500 triumphs lies a simple truth: loyalty, not just speed, wins championships.Gibbs is the only man enshrined in both the Pro Football Hall of Fame and the NASCAR Hall of Fame. But beyond the plaques, what makes him timeless is the culture he built. Whether on the gridiron or at the track, he created families — not factories, believers — not just employees.And that is the secret: trophies tarnish, records fall, but loyalty lasts. Joe Gibbs didn’t just master two sports. He mastered the art of keeping people together.Also read: Māori All Black Shane Christie passes away at 39, rocking rugby and reigniting the concussion crisis debate Beyond sports, Joe Gibbs also foundedin 1986, a nonprofit home for at-risk children in Virginia, showing his commitment to building futures off the field and track.","Gibbs is the only man enshrined in both the Pro Football Hall of Fame and the NASCAR Hall of fame.

What Is the Chrono-Storm Event?



When Does the Event Start?

Pacific Time (PT): 2:00 AM – 28 Aug

Central Time (CT): 4:00 AM – 28 Aug

Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST): 7:00 PM – 28 Aug



Looking Ahead to Season 4



Chrono Tokens have long been the single most striking meta-feature of Marvel Rivals, and it looks like the tokens are ripe for a certain upgrade: The Chrono-Storm event, which marks the arrival of Season 4, has officially debuted with the August 28, 2025 update. It’s especially useful if you want to stockpile more tokens. Now and until the event finishes, it is the best opportunity to complete the ongoing Battle Pass or to fill in gaps in the older ones.The main point of the Chrono-Storm is to improve the Battle Pass progression. Each season has its own Weekly, Challenge, and Seasonal missions, and completing any of these during Chrono-Storm will give 2x Chrono Tokens. While the 2x multiplier is limited to 2,000 bonus tokens, it is still a big help for players that want to get more out of their time.Since all Battle Passes in Marvel Rivals are permanent, the event doesn’t just aid with the current season. It’s also the right moment to tackle passes that have gone unfinished from previous updates. That adaptability makes the Chrono-Storm event especially user friendly.Marked for day one on the 28th of Aug 2025, the final goal for all time zones is for everyone to be active simultaneously. This is the timeline for the start of the event in every time zone:Starting before the weekend means event participants won’t miss out on rewards during the weekdays.If the plan revolves around the token cap, then the most effective strategy is to NOT complete any major missions until the event is “live.” Through accumulating weekly and challenge goals, rewards can be “stacked” and further progress on the battle pass can be made.However, if your mission list is very full, it makes more sense to clear it out, as you may fail to make any progress otherwise. The token bonus can only go so far, so optimising your approach and wasting none is critical.Given the end date for Chrono-Storm, it is fair to deduce that the next big update’s downtime will start right after, even though Marvel has yet to confirm Season 4 details. For the fans, this means the event is not only an opportunity to grind but also a definite link to the future of the game.The Marvel Rivals Chrono-Storm event is quick and simple, yet extremely rewarding. It is a must for any fan of the game’s Battle Pass system, as it offers double Chrono Tokens and a generous cap that allows you to make actual progress. Make sure to grab your rewards before Season 4 alters the battleground yet again.",The Chrono-Storm event marks the arrival of Season 4 in Marvel Rivals.

Shilo Sanders faces setback after emotional preseason exit

Deion Sanders insists Shilo Sanders is prepared for life beyond the NFL

The NFL preseason roster cuts are always brutal, and this year Tampa Bay Buccaneers rookie safety Shilo Sanders found himself on the wrong side of the 53-man deadline. The son of Hall of Famer and Colorado head coach Deion Sanders was waived just days after being ejected for throwing a punch in the team’s preseason finale against the Buffalo Bills.Shilo Sanders, who signed with the Bucs as an undrafted free agent, was already battling long odds to secure a roster spot. The ejection magnified those challenges, ultimately leading to his release. For any rookie without draft status, one mistake can carry outsized consequences. Yet, despite the disappointment, Deion Sanders made it clear that his son’s journey is far from over.Addressing reporters, the Pro Football Hall of Famer offered a steady, almost fatherly reassurance: “I’m proud of my kids, all of them, and I prepared my kids for any and everything that could possibly happen in life and in sports. So, he is mentally where he needs to be, physically where he needs to be. We’re praying that he gets another opportunity to go with a team. But if he doesn’t, the plans have already been put forward to what he’s going to do next. ”Deion also reminded fans that football is just one part of Shilo’s identity. “Shilo is a man of many talents, and he’s going to be straight. All the Sanders are going to be straight, with or without football, you better believe that.I take care of mine, and I always have, and y’all know what I mean.”Also Read: Buccaneers make exciting Chris Godwin decision that changes outlook for their 2025 NFL campaign While Shilo’s NFL future is uncertain, he does have options.

Yosha Iglesias, 37, has become the French Women's Chess Champion, making history as the second transgender player to win a national chess title. Iglesias, who was ranked seventh in the 16-player knockout event in Vichy, France, secured her victory by defeating Women's Grand Master Mitra Hejazipour 1.5-0.5 in the final match.Iglesias progressed through the tournament by defeating WGM Maria Nepeina-Leconte 3.5-2.5, IM Pauline Guichard 1.5-0.5, and IM Anastasia Savina 1.5-0.5 in the semi-final. During the quarter-final against Guichard, Iglesias played what she considers the best game of her career.""Nothing makes me happier than knowing my title might show young trans people that they don't have to choose between chess and transition.

Meier, who no longer actively plays, shared her support for Iglesias.""It is a worldwide signal for the visibility and acceptance of us trans women, for our normalisation, an empowerment that alleviates our doubts about our right to exist.I wish that the public dialogue about trans women in chess and in sports would be conducted without fear, and especially without hatred, with respect from all sides,"" told Chess.com.Since her transition in 2021, Iglesias has advocated for women's and trans rights within the chess community.

She addressed this challenge through social media, expressing gratitude to her harassers for helping build her mental strength.""At the beginning of my transition, I knew I would face much hatred. I decided to make it an opportunity to grow as a person and also as a player in the face of adversity.""The championship final concluded with a meaningful moment between Iglesias and her opponent Hejazipour.""When Mitra resigned in the final game, I let a few tears drop while Mitra congratulated me. Shortly after, she hugged me with a huge smile. That shows how classy she is, but also that we share a deep sense of sisterhood.""Iglesias plans to pursue the WGM title after recovering from upcoming surgery in October. She aims to represent France at the Olympic Games or the European Team Championship.""At 37, I'll reach my peak rating in the upcoming list.

Marco Kasper Rookie Season Highlights (2024-25)

Will Smith and Mackie Samoskevich aim for stronger second seasons



Cutter Gauthier carried pressure into his first season with the Anaheim Ducks. Drafted by Philadelphia, traded to California, and expected to score right away, the winger had a mixed campaign. He finished with 20 goals and 44 points, but his early struggles raised eyebrows.Through 54 games, Gauthier scored just nine times despite firing 190 shots. His shooting percentage was far below league averages for players with similar volume. In the second half, things turned. Gauthier scored 11 goals and added 22 points over the final 28 games. The talent has always been there; his college numbers showed it, and now he seems poised to convert chances more consistently. The Ducks are leaning on their youth, and Gauthier has the chance to become their leading scorer this year.Zack Bolduc’s late-season surge with St. Louis turned heads. The 22-year-old scored 19 goals in 72 games, with 13 of those coming after the 4 Nations break. His shooting percentage was high, but his track record in junior hockey suggests he has the finishing ability to sustain it.Now, with the Montreal Canadiens following a summer trade, Bolduc steps into an uncertain but promising situation.Kirby Dach’s health remains a question mark, leaving the door open for Bolduc to move higher in the lineup. The Canadiens need secondary scoring, and his ability to produce in limited minutes last year hints at more upside. Whether he becomes a long-term fit or a short-term spark, Bolduc will be closely watched in Montreal.Marco Kasper’s rookie season started quietly, but it ended with growing responsibility. He began the year in the AHL, then worked his way into the Detroit Red Wings lineup. When Todd McLellan replaced Derek Lalonde behind the bench, Kasper’s usage increased.In 48 games under McLellan, Kasper scored 17 goals and 30 points, production that rivaled top rookies. Playing alongside Alex DeBrincat and Patrick Kane gave him a boost, but it was also a sign of trust. Detroit has been waiting for young centers to take control, and Kasper might be the one ready to fill that role.Will Smith’s rookie year with the San Jose Sharks took time to click. He struggled early, but after January, he found consistency. His 22 points in the final 25 games nearly matched Macklin Celebrini’s output over the same stretch. Increased ice time showed the team’s belief in his development.Mackie Samoskevich had a different path in Florida. Injuries gave him a chance to play higher in the lineup, and he responded with 14 points in his last 24 games. The Panthers remain deep, but his speed and offensive touch keep him in the conversation for more minutes.Both Smith and Samoskevich are entering seasons where their roles could grow. They may not carry their teams yet, but each looks like a building block for the future.Also Read: Toronto Maple Leafs prospects: Easton Cowan, Ben Danford, and Noah Chadwick lead the way",Marco Kasper is earning trust as a top-six center in Detroit.

Lamar Jackson’s leadership fuels Ravens’ resurgence



More NFL coverage:

On the same day he was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week, Lamar Jackson made one thing clear — he’s not holding back. The Baltimore Ravens quarterback, who recently returned from a hamstring injury, addressed lingering doubts about his health following last week’s 28-6 win over the Miami Dolphins. “The speculations and what I'm saying [are] totally different,” Jackson said after Wednesday’s practice. “So like I said, I feel good, and I was ready to play. I felt like I did what I needed to do to win.”Against Miami, Jackson threw for 238 yards and four touchdowns, yet ran just five times for 14 yards — one of the lowest rushing totals of his career. It was only the seventh time in eight seasons he’s been held under 15 rushing yards, sparking speculation about whether his hamstring was still bothering him. But Jackson quickly brushed off the concern. When asked if he’s ready to run when needed, he replied simply, “If I have to. ”Jackson, 28, remains the NFL’s all-time rushing quarterback with 6,353 yards — nearly 2,000 more than any active passer. While his 36 rushing yards per game mark a career low, it doesn’t seem to be due to injury. He wasn’t listed on the injury report before or after the Dolphins game, signaling he’s fully healthy and focused on winning.The Ravens believe Jackson’s dual-threat ability will be key again this Sunday against the aggressive Minnesota Vikings defense. “It's tough to blitz a guy like that because of how good he is with,” tight end Mark Andrews said, “obviously, his arm, but his feet, too.”Two weeks ago, Baltimore’s season looked lost at 1-5. Now, they’re riding a two-game win streak, with Jackson and the offense firing on all cylinders. “Yeah, no doubt,” Jackson said when asked if the team’s confidence had returned. “We've been locked in for the last couple weeks, and we got to stay that way. I believe we turned a new leaf, I believe so.”At 3-5, the Ravens aren’t out of danger yet. But if Jackson’s leadership and form continue trending upward, Baltimore could still make a late push for the AFC North crown. For Jackson, the mission is simple: stay focused, win the next game, and prove that the Ravens’ season is far from over.","Lamar Jackson was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week on Monday.

While Alwyn offered quiet devotion, Kelce brings an open, expressive joy. Friends say Swift is glowing, embracing this new chapter with confidence and living her love story out loud, on her own terms.

Joe Alwyn once called being Taylor Swift’s muse “flattering”

From Joe Alwyn’s quiet loyalty to Travis Kelce’s bold devotion





Before Taylor Swift ’s high-profile romance with NFL star Travis Kelce captured the world’s attention, the singer experienced a very different kind of love with British actor Joe Alwyn . Their six-year relationship was built on privacy, calm, and quiet devotion, a stark contrast to the spotlight-fueled excitement surrounding her current relationship.Joe Alwyn’s composed attitude toward fame and his ability to protect their bond from media noise once defined Swift’s most peaceful chapter. Now, years later, Swift appears to have found joy in a more open and expressive love with Kelce. From game-day appearances to public displays of affection, she seems more confident and carefree than ever, embracing happiness on her own terms while rewriting what love looks like in her world. ..In a 2019 interview with The Sunday Times, Hollywood actor Joe Alwyn was asked about the experience of having some of pop sensation Taylor Swift’s biggest love songs inspired by him. His response was characteristically grounded and gentle. “No, not at all. No. It’s flattering,” he said with a calm smile..At the time, Taylor Swift had just released Lover, an album filled with romantic anthems like “London Boy” and “Cornelia Street”, both widely believed to be about Alwyn.Even on her previous record Reputation, songs such as “Call It What You Want” and “King of My Heart” hinted at their growing bond. Swift once described that era as one of emotional safety, telling fans she had found “stability” away from chaos.What made Joe Alwyn stand out during their six-year relationship was his ability to tune out the noise. He told The Times he simply ignored media speculation: “I don’t have any interest in tabloids. I know what I want to do, and that’s this, and that’s what I am doing.”Taylor Swift echoed that sentiment in an interview with The Guardian, explaining, “I’ve learned that if I do [discuss my relationship], people think it’s up for discussion, and our relationship isn’t up for discussion.”Today, as Swift navigates a far more public love story with Travis Kelce, one often unfolding under stadium lights and social media frenzy, some fans can’t help but look back at her time with Alwyn as the quiet before the storm.However, Taylor Swift has never looked happier than she does with Travis Kelce. Friends close to the couple say she’s “glowing” and genuinely enjoying a new sense of freedom she didn’t always have in past relationships. Unlike her quieter years with Joe Alwyn, Swift seems to thrive in this more public love story, cheering from VIP boxes, holding hands after games, and embracing the spotlight with confidence.Those close to her note that Kelce’s openness and playful energy have brought out her fun, carefree side, describing their bond as “easy, supportive, and real.” For Swift, this chapter feels less like hiding from fame and more like finally living out loud, on her own terms.Also Read: Plans for kids already in motion as Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce plan their 2026 nuptials Earlier in 2024, insiders told People that Joe Alwyn had turned the page on his relationship with Taylor Swift and begun seeing someone new. The sources added that the actor was content with where he was in life, balancing a healthy personal life with a strong professional focus. They also noted that Alwyn has always spoken respectfully about Swift, acknowledging that while he deeply cared for her, their relationship simply ran its course.","Joe Alwyn once called being Taylor Swift’s muse “flattering” Friends say Swift is glowing, embracing this new chapter with confidence and living her love story out loud, on her own terms.

The Bigger Picture: Sending a Message to Tarik Skubal

As the 2025 MLB season officially comes to an end, the focus quickly shifts toward the offseason - a period that promises major shakeups across the league. With a long list of stars expected to test free agency, front offices are already weighing their options between blockbuster signings and strategic trades. For the, one of the biggest storylines centers on their uncertain infield situation and the possible departure of Gleyber Torres.This offseason features a loaded market with names like Kyle Schwarber, Cody Bellinger, Alex Bregman, and Pete Alonso potentially switching uniforms. While many clubs are expected to make aggressive pushes in free agency, others will look to bolster their rosters through the trade market. The Tigers may fall into the latter group, especially if they decide to replace Torres with an established All-Star talent.This winter’s free-agent market is stacked with talent. Stars like Kyle Schwarber, Cody Bellinger, Alex Bregman, and Pete Alonso headline a group of players who could redefine the league landscape. However, while many franchises will dive into free agency, others - like the Detroit Tigers - may prefer the trade route to strengthen key areas.Expect some clubs to move aggressively early in the market, while others play the waiting game to gauge player values. Either way, there’s a sense that this offseason will spark considerable movement, with several marquee names possibly finding new homes.The Detroit Tigers face a crucial decision regarding Gleyber Torres, who is now an unrestricted free agent. Losing him would be a significant blow to the team’s lineup. Torres played in 145 regular-season games in 2025, producing a .256/.358/.387 slash line with 16 home runs and 74 RBIs. His consistency and presence were vital to Detroit’s overall success, making him a priority - though re-signing him may prove difficult given market competition.According to Bleacher Report’s Joel Reuter, the Tigers could make a blockbuster move by trading with the Toronto Blue Jays for two-time All-Star Bo Bichette. Reuter wrote, “Bo Bichette does not turn 28 years old until March 5, and after a down year in 2024, he returned to elite form offensively this season with a .311/.357/.483 line that included 44 doubles, 18 home runs and 94 RBI in 139 games.”Here’s a quick look at how Bichette compares to Torres in 2025:Bichette’s offensive resurgence makes him an ideal candidate for Detroit’s infield. Although his defensive metrics at shortstop suggest limitations, a shift to second base could maximize his strengths while filling Torres’ vacancy.A move for Bichette would carry broader implications beyond filling a positional gap. It would also signal Detroit’s commitment to building a legitimate championship contender. As Reuter noted, “It would also represent a significant move to show Tarik Skubal the front office is serious about building a title contender, as the Detroit Tigers try to hammer out a long-term extension with their ace before he hits the open market after the 2026 season. ”By bringing in an All-Star-caliber talent like Bichette, the Tigers could demonstrate to Skubal - and the rest of the roster - that the organization is intent on competing for a World Series.Also read: MLB trade rumors: Philadelphia Phillies potentially eyeing $190 million star amid Alec Bohm uncertainty The Detroit Tigers’ front office faces a defining offseason.

Trey Benson injury update: Could the Arizona Cardinals running back return for Week 10 after knee setback?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/trey-benson-injury-update-could-the-arizona-cardinals-running-back-return-for-week-10-after-knee-setback/articleshow/125110647.cms,"Trey Benson’s potential Week 10 return explained.

Cardinals' RB Trey Benson has 'league-winner' potential | Fantasy Football Happy Hour | NFL on NBC

Will Trey Benson be back and who will lead the backfield if he doesn’t?



The Arizona Cardinals’ running game has been a revolving door since Week 4. Trey Benson, who earned the starting role after James Conner went down with a season-ending injury, has been sidelined with a knee problem. In his absence, the team has experimented with a trio of backs — Bam Knight, Emari Demercado, and Michael Carter — each showing glimpses of production but none delivering consistent performance. As the Week 10 matchup against the Seattle Seahawks looms, the Cardinals are left waiting to see if Benson will finally return to stabilize the position.Benson has now passed the four-game minimum required for an injured reserve stint, making him eligible to come back. However, there is still no official word on whether he will be activated. Arizona will get its first chance to gauge his status during Wednesday’s practice session, which kicks off their Week 10 preparation.The moment Benson is officially designated to return from injured reserve will be the clearest signal that he could be back on the field. While his return is still up in the air, there’s a chance he could play this week.Arizona’s backfield has been far from settled in Benson’s absence. Michael Carter initially looked like he might step into the lead role, but that plan didn’t stick. Bam Knight seemed ready to assume control next, only to be edged out by Emari Demercado in Week 9.That week, Demercado saw 15 touches compared to Knight’s 11, gaining five more carries, which hinted at a shift in the rotation. If Benson does not return immediately, the Cardinals will likely continue with a two-man committee featuring Knight and Demercado, with the slight edge going to Demercado in terms of expected workload. Once Benson is healthy and active, he is expected to reclaim the starting role and provide some much-needed stability to the running game.For now, Arizona fans and fantasy players are left in the dark. Benson’s possible return is the main question, and until the team confirms his status, the Cardinals’ backfield will stay unpredictable. How carries are split without him could affect the offense and even the team’s play-calling as Week 10 approaches.","Benson has passed the four-game minimum required for an injured reserve stint, making him eligible to come back.
