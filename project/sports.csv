When Love Turns Lethal: Inside India’s Honeymoon Murders | The Silent Crisis No One Talks About

Poll Do you believe that marital pressure can lead to extreme actions such as murder? Yes, it can lead to drastic measures. No, there are always better alternatives.





AURANGABAD: In a chilling echo of the recent Meghalaya honeymoon murder, a 45-day-old marriage in Bihar’s Aurangabad district ended in bloodshed when a young woman allegedly conspired with her maternal uncle and his two accomplices to have her husband shot dead in cold blood.The victim, 24-year-old Priyanshu Kumar Singh, was murdered on the night of June 24 while returning from Nabinagar railway station.Initial probe suggested a contract killing, but the case took a dark turn when police found that the murder had been masterminded by Priyanshu’s own wife, Gunja Singh (30).According to Aurangabad Superintendent of Police Ambarish Rahul, Gunja had been in a 15-year-long illicit relationship with her maternal uncle, Jeevan Singh (52).Despite her reluctance, she married Priyanshu in May under family pressure. But just weeks into the marriage, struggling to keep her affair secret, she allegedly decided to eliminate her husband — inspired by the Meghalaya honeymoon murdercase, where a newlywed woman was accused of murdering her husband during their honeymoon trip.Police say Gunja and Jeevan plotted meticulously. Jeevan, with the help of Jaishankar Chaubey and Mukesh Sharma from Garhwa district, Jharkhand, arranged SIM cards and logistics to execute the plan.On the night of the murder, Priyanshu, returning from Varanasi, made a routine call to update his wife on his whereabouts. Gunja passed the information to the killers, who were lying in wait. Moments later, Priyanshu was ambushed and shot dead.Gunja was arrested on Wednesday evening, and during interrogation, she confessed to the murder conspiracy. Both accomplices have also been taken into custody, while her uncle Jeevan Singh remains absconding, with a manhunt underway.Police have seized Gunja’s mobile phone, and call records are expected to play a crucial role in proving her involvement.The chilling similarity to the Meghalaya honeymoon case — where marital intimacy masked a sinister murder plot — has left both investigators and locals stunned.","Police say Gunja Singh, 30, had been in a 15-year-long illicit relationship with her maternal uncle, Jeevan Singh.

"""Don't want my meat on Page Six"": Travis Kelce admits one major change in his life after falling for Taylor Swift",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/dont-want-my-meat-on-page-six-travis-kelce-admits-one-major-change-in-his-life-after-falling-for-taylor-swift/articleshow/122186441.cms,"Travis Kelce says this one thing has changed drastically in his life (Getty Images)

Travis Kelce confesses the unexpected impact Taylor Swift had on his personal life



Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce is gearing up for his 13th NFL season, and it’s not just football that’s kept him in the spotlight. With over 12,000 receiving yards, 1,004 receptions, 77 touchdowns, and three Super Bowl titles to his name, Kelce’s Hall of Fame resume speaks for itself. But ever since going public with global pop icon Taylor Swift in 2023, his public visibility has shifted into a whole new realm.Despite being a fan favorite long before Taylor Swift entered the picture, Kelce admitted that the intensity of media attention since dating the Grammy-winning singer caught him off guard. Speaking candidly on the ""Bussin' With The Boys"" podcast, Travis Kelce reflected on the realities of being in such a high-profile relationship.“Yeah, it's just the paparazzi. That's probably the only thing I didn't grasp until you're in it,” Kelce admitted. “That's probably the craziest part. Like, I'm just playing golf and all of a sudden there’s a guy with a camera hiding in the trees. I’m like, ‘Oh no, I’ve gotta use the restroom now—I can’t just walk over there and do my thing.’”Kelce, known for his fun-loving and unfiltered personality, acknowledged that being with someone as globally recognized as Swift means constantly being watched.He quipped, “Never been ashamed of slamming beers, just don’t want my meat on Page Six.”While the attention has increased, Travis Kelce made it clear that at its core, their relationship is grounded in normalcy. “Yeah, we’re having fun with it, man. Just being a couple, dude — you already know,” he said, brushing off speculation that their public appearances are for show. “It gets thrown out there like we’re trying to seek attention every now and then, but we’re just enjoying life and having fun, going to hockey games… kind of easing her into more of the sports world. ”As Taylor Swift’s global reach introduces Kelce to fans far beyond the football field, he continues to focus on what he does best—dominate the gridiron. With Chiefs training camp just weeks away, the cameras won’t be going anywhere. Expect to see Swift back in her suite, cheering as Kelce chases a potential fourth Super Bowl ring.For Travis Kelce, the biggest transformation hasn’t been fame—it’s how fame now follows him off the field. But through it all, he and Swift seem unfazed by the noise. They’re simply two individuals, navigating laugh, love and life under the brightest spotlight imaginable, and doing it on their own terms.Also Read: Hailee Steinfeld and Josh Allen’s wedding featured a surprise nod to the Buffalo Bills","Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce is gearing up for his 13th NFL season.

Aiono wants Puka confirmed as the baby’s father, but custody only on her terms



Poll Do you think Puka Nacua should contest the paternity claim? Yes, he should contest it. No, he should accept the claim.

She’s also asking for financial help before the baby even arrives



Pregnancy-related costs





Childbirth expenses





Her legal fees for the case

No public response from Nacua but this could get messier fast



Just when Rams breakout star Puka Nacua should be gearing up for his second NFL season, his name is making headlines for something off the field. His longtime girlfriend, Hallie Aiono, has filed a legal petition in Los Angeles County not just to establish paternity, but to secure full custody of their unborn child and financial support for everything from pregnancy to lawyers. The court documents, obtained by TMZ Sports, paint a pretty serious picture and they suggest this situation might be far more tense than fans expected.According to the legal filing, Hallie Aiono is asking the court to formally confirm that Nacua is the father of her baby, who is expected to arrive later this year. The two have reportedly been in a long-term relationship, but it doesn’t look like they’re on the same page anymore.In the documents, Aiono is requesting full physical custody of the child once born. That means she wants the baby to live with her full-time, with Nacua granted visitation rights only. However, she’s open to joint legal custody, meaning they’d both have a say in decisions like education or medical care.Aiono’s petition isn’t just about custody. She’s also asking the court to order Puka to cover a range of expenses, including:That’s a major ask and indicates that the two may already be in disagreement over financial support even before the baby is born.As of now, Puka Nacua hasn’t publicly commented on the legal filing. It’s unclear if he’ll contest paternity or agree to the terms Aiono’s asking for. Either way, a court may order a paternity test after the child is born if there’s any dispute.The situation comes just as Nacua is set to return to Rams camp and build on his explosive rookie season, which saw him become one of the league’s most exciting young receivers. But now, he’s also stepping into a potentially high-profile legal fight that could follow him into the season.From record-setting receptions to a surprise playoff push with the Rams, Nacua was one of last season’s biggest breakout stars. But with court proceedings underway and his ex-partner seeking full control of parenting and finances, his off-field situation may dominate headlines in the months ahead.Also read - Diddy facing 20 years but NFL’s Dez Bryant says Cassie “was no victim”","Rams receiver Puka Nacua's girlfriend Hallie Aiono is seeking full custody of their unborn child.

Tyrese Haliburton’s routine diet is as much about flavor as fitness



Tyrese Haliburton doesn’t experiment with his pre-game food



Tyrese Haliburton is just 25 and knows that he can treat himself to sushi or a hamburger once in a while. However, the Indiana Pacers star knows when to limit their frequency and gives credit for his well-balanced diet to his chefs. A die-hard pasta lover, he enjoys it for dinner, but when it comes to game day, he sticks to a fixed menu he doesn’t tamper with at all. Here’s all about the diet that helps him maintain his A-game on the court.Since his second year in the NBA, Tyrese Haliburton has employed chefs, as he is not very proficient in cooking and would often end up eating at restaurants in their absence. “It’s just important that I have someone holding me accountable, but it’s also me eating the right things,” he told GQ in a 2023 interview.The No. 0 point guard believes in an early and hearty breakfast. He loves a big plate of French toast combined with eggs and bacon, topped with his permanent fixture — a smoothie.He prefers a comparatively lighter lunch, which could be a grilled cheese sandwich or something else, complemented with tomato soup.He likes to keep his favorite food, that is pasta, for dinner, which he complements with rolls and a Caesar salad — and, of course, a smoothie.He prefers to end his night with a shake made with ice cream and protein or have a cherry juice from his own brand, Cheribundi. He claims it helps him fall asleep easily.Haliburton isn’t fond of vegetables, but he consumes them in the form of green juices. He’s fond of smoothies, which he has with every meal.Haliburton has kept his pre-game food palette fixed for a long time and never experiments with it, since it works well for him. It’s always chicken, rice, and bread with a green juice for lunch before he hits the court for a game. After a game, the first thing he takes is cherry juice.Tyrese Haliburton is currently recovering from surgery for a torn Achilles tendon. He led the Indiana Pacers to the NBA Finals, but his injury worsened during Game 7, which they unfortunately lost to the Oklahoma City Thunder.

Carolina Hurricanes sign Nikolaj Ehlers to pivotal six-year, $51 million contract aimed at strengthening their offensive lineup

Nikolaj Ehlers brings proven scoring and speed to the Carolina Hurricanes lineup

The Carolina Hurricanes have landed one of the top NHL free agents, inking Nikolaj Ehlers to a six-year, $51 million deal. The 29-year-old winger was the most sought-after player remaining on the market when free agency began. A speedster with a scoring ability and always-reliable offense, Ehlers provides Carolina with a big addition as it seeks to maintain its status as one of the Eastern Conference's top teams next season.Nikolaj Ehlers' contract has an average value of $8.5 million per year and represents Carolina's commitment to bringing scoring punch to the team. The Danish winger comes from a 2024-25 season with the Winnipeg Jets where he accumulated 24 goals and 53 points in 69 games. He also contributed five goals and seven points during Winnipeg's postseason run before the Jets were ousted by the Dallas Stars in the second round.Hurricanes GM Eric Tulsky confirmed that negotiations with Ehlers' camp heated up over the last several days, leading to Thursday's signing. The Hurricanes had plenty of cap space, but their ability to make a long-term commitment without having to give up other core pieces of the roster helps to illustrate the significance of the deal.Ehlers will be part of an offense that also includes Sebastian Aho and Andrei Svechnikov, providing another scoring threat.Selected ninth overall by Winnipeg in 2014, Ehlers has recorded 225 goals and 520 points through 674 career games in the NHL. His production history made him a hot commodity once free agency commenced. Prior to this new contract, he was completing a seven-year, $42 million deal with a $6 million cap hit.The Hurricanes have been busy this offseason, signing not just Ehlers but also signing young forward Logan Stankoven to an eight-year, $48 million contract extension. Carolina also traded for New York Rangers defenseman K'Andre Miller, showing a clear emphasis on constructing a team that can contend long term.Now with the addition of Nikolaj Ehlers, the Carolina Hurricanes have fulfilled their requirement for increased scoring depth and bolstered an already skilled roster further. The transaction is a testament to their insistence on remaining competitive and in pursuit of a Stanley Cup in the future.Also Read: NHL Trade News: Florida Panthers sign MacKenzie Entwistle to two-year, two-way contract","Carolina Hurricanes sign Nikolaj Ehlers to pivotal six-year, $51 million contract aimed at strengthening their offensive lineup.

Florida Panthers sign MacKenzie Entwistle to boost forward depth and add physical edge to lineup

MacKenzie Entwistle aims for NHL return after injury challenges and time in the AHL

The Florida Panthers have added organizational depth with the signing of forward MacKenzie Entwistle to a two-year, two-way agreement. The 25-year-old, who spent several seasons in the Chicago Blackhawks system, will attempt a return to form after a 2024-25 season that was shortened by injury. Entwistle offers NHL experience and a physical presence that can be an asset at the bottom of the Florida lineup.MacKenzie Entwistle played 67 games with Chicago in 2023-24 with five goals, 11 points, 47 penalty minutes, and 138 hits. He was plagued by injuries for most of last season, limiting his efforts to seven regular-season contests with AHL's Charlotte Checkers, where he had one goal and two points. In limited play, Entwistle came back for the playoffs and registered two goals and 20 penalty minutes in eight post-season games, proving that he can perform under pressure.The Panthers have been busy adding depth to their forward corps after their deep 2024-25 playoff push. Entwistle's experience and versatility may be useful, particularly in a bottom-six position that requires energy and defensive dependability. Although he is likely to start the season in the AHL, Florida's coaching staff hasn't shut the door on potential NHL call-ups in case of injuries or roster shifts during the season.A third-round draft pick of the Arizona Coyotes in 2017 (69th overall), Entwistle was traded to Chicago as part of the Marian Hossa trade. He fought his way into the Blackhawks' lineup across portions of four seasons, earning respect for his work ethic, penalty killing, and physicality. His finest NHL run occurred in 2023-24, as he emerged as a consistent checking-line forward.The move by Florida to sign a two-year, two-way contract is one of caution and possibility. The two-way deal gives the Panthers flexibility in terms of cap management and roster fluidity while providing Entwistle with an opportunity to prove himself at the NHL level. If he can remain healthy and keep his aggressive style of play going, he might prove to be a solid depth addition to the Florida forwards, who always seem to appreciate grit and energy.Entwistle's signing is as much a reflection of the Panthers' emphasis on creating a strong, durable roster that can handle the rigors of an extended NHL season as anything else. Although he will probably begin the season in the AHL, his skillset and physicality make him a prime candidate to return to the NHL again in the near future.Also Read: Henrik Lundqvist shows how to retire in style with epic waterfront BBQ","Florida Panthers sign MacKenzie Entwistle to boost forward depth and add physical edge to lineup.

Connor Bedard may have suffered harsh criticism over a chaotic season with the Chicago Blackhawks, but he is now being praised by teammates and insiders as well. As trade rumors swirled and pressure off the ice mounted, Connor Bedard kept his focus on the ice. And now, teammate forward Philipp Kurashev himself has chimed in too, calling Connor Bedard ""special"" for his ability to manage the weight of oversized expectations at just 19 years old.As the Chicago Blackhawks suffered through a tough season, all eyes were on Connor Bedard, who entered the league with the ""generational talent"" label. The buzz grew stronger in March following Connor Bedard's enigmatic Instagram picture featuring only a house emoji, hyping trade rumors at one of the team's lowest moments. But amid the media hype, Philipp Kurashev, who has played alongside Connor Bedard since 2023, made a public statement with a glowing endorsement.In an interview to NHL reporter Max Miller, Kurashev stated, “It is amazing. He does a good job with [the pressure].” The two are very close, and Philipp Kurashev's words describe the silent admiration Bedard enjoys in the dressing room despite outside distractions.Their opinion was reinforced by NHL insider Frank Seravalli, who pushed back against the criticism of the young forward.Discussing a media storm during February, Frank Seravalli indicated that Bedard has been judged too harshly. “I think there are a couple of different factors that have stood in his way, and one is right between his own ears,” Frank Seravalli stated. “I think he’s been way too frustrated. I think he needs to understand that he shouldn’t worry about being a playmaker. He should just be a shoot-first guy.” Both Frank Seravalli and Philipp Kurashev made it plain: the unrealistic expectations are not a measure of Bedard's true potential.Also read: NHL Trade Rumors: Insider dismisses Maple Leafs’ interest in bringing back Nazem Kadri With another off-season behind him and all the support he can muster from players like Philipp Kurashev, Connor Bedard is more dedicated than ever.

Sergei Bobrovsky brushes aside personal glory; Florida Panthers system gets praise



This is how much it costs to look like 2x Stanley Cup champ, Sergei Bobrovsky 😲 Which goalie do you

Sergei Bobrovsky was the clear standout in the Florida Panthers’ latest Stanley Cup triumph. Still, when asked about his role in the title run, the veteran goaltender humbly redirected the spotlight. Speaking to Russian outlet MatchTV after clinching back-to-back championships, Bobrovsky downplayed praise from Edmonton Oilers forward Vasily Podkolzin, emphasizing instead the collective effort of his teammates and coaching staff. The Panthers, now chasing a third straight title, are setting their sights on NHL history.Sergei Bobrovsky's .905 save percentage in the pivotal game helped tip the series in the Florida Panthers' favor to win the Stanley Cup, but Sergei Bobrovsky remained true to his well-known modesty.I am just part of the team. Part of the system. All the guys worked to the maximum. The concentration and intensity, especially in these games, were off the charts. When a team plays like that, it makes the goalkeeper’s job easier. The opponent has no time for anything, and in key moments it is very difficult for him to do what he wants,"" he shared with MatchTV. “I’m excited about the next season, about the next challenge. We have, again, a great group of guys. I’m excited to be their goalie, to help them, to go through the challenges and hurdles with them.""The Florida Panthers are now on the brink of NHL greatness. With two titles in two seasons, they can make history and become the first team to win three in a row during the salary cap era. Only the Pittsburgh Penguins and Chicago Blackhawks have won three in total since the salary cap era began, but none have won a legitimate three-peat.""We have a great group of guys. We have good players, but next season starts from zero for everybody,” he acknowledged. “If you win [a third cup in a row], it’s going to be happiness.""Amidst the NHL's changing landscape, few teams have the depth, chemistry, and leadership Florida has nurtured in recent years.

Aaron Rodgers Praises Steelers Leadership & Talent, Gives Life Updates On The Pat McAfee Show

Aaron Rodgers is stepping into his final NFL season—and he’s already planning his total disappearance from the spotlight. In a brutally honest appearance on The Pat McAfee Show, the 41-year-old quarterback confirmed what fans had long suspected: the 2025 season with the Pittsburgh Steelers will be his last. But it’s not just football he’s leaving behind—Rodgers says he’s retreating from public life completely, along with his wife, Brittani.“I’m pretty sure this is it,” Aaron Rodgers said bluntly about his one-year deal with the Steelers. “That’s why we just did a one-year deal. Steelers didn’t need to put any extra years on it.”While Rodgers promised to give Pittsburgh “everything I got,” he also made it clear he’s done chasing headlines. “When this is all done, I’m out; you won’t see me,” he said. “I don’t want to live a public life.”Rodgers’ clarity about walking away from fame underscores a deeper personal shift—one that includes his fiercely private marriage to Brittani.Rodgers spent much of the interview defending his wife's desire for privacy and slamming what he called a “sick society.” “Now I’m with somebody who’s private, who doesn’t want to be in the public eye,” he explained.“Didn’t sign up to be a celebrity, doesn’t want to be part of it.”The quarterback expressed frustration over paparazzi stalking his new life in Pittsburgh, including trying to photograph Brittani and even his dog, Apollo. “It’s a sick society, isn’t it?” he said.Despite being in the public eye for two decades, Rodgers says he's ready to cut the cord completely. “Just because I’m not selling wedding photos to the magazines... that’s just not what I want to do,” he said. He also warned fans not to expect family members to leak info either. “Any other ridiculous story about my family that I don’t talk to—they wouldn’t know any information about me,” he added.Also Read: “She made me better”: Patrick Mahomes says the woman everyone loves to hate, Brittany Mahomes—is the real reason behind his NFL greatness As Rodgers prepares to close the chapter on his NFL career, one thing is certain: when the final whistle blows, he won’t just be leaving the field—he’ll be vanishing from public view entirely.","Aaron Rodgers says this NFL season is his last and he's ‘out’ for good afterward.

Garry Kasparov

questions Carlsen

D Gukesh, the world champion, demonstrated his prowess by securing another impressive victory against World No. 1 Magnus Carlsen at the Super United Rapid and Blitz chess tournament in Zagreb, Croatia. It is for the second straight time that Gukesh has forced Carlsen to resign. This time, though, there were no animated, table-thumping walk outs.This win against Carlsen on Thursday marked Gukesh's fifth consecutive victory in the tournament, earning him 10 points out of a possible 12. It put him in sole lead in the tournament.""Beating Magnus is always special for sure. I think this also gives a bit more confidence... it's nicer that I could win from two losing positions,"" Gukesh told the official broadcaster.Carlsen's resignation came after 49 moves. The Norwegian conceded he had not been playing well and credited Gukesh for not just beating him, but clinching five wins in a row.""I've played poorly the entire tournament and this time I got soundly punished. I had a very, very nice position but he took his chance to open out the position.After that, I didn't handle it that well. He found a lot of really, really good moves. I had a chance to bail out, a draw, I thought, 'let's continue playing'. A couple of moves later, I was playing pretty hopelessly lost,"" said Carlsen.""I played poorly but all credit to Gukesh. He's playing well and he's taking his chances too.""""He's doing incredibly well now. It's a long way to go in the tournament, but winning five games in a row is no mean feat.""With three rounds remaining in the rapid section, Gukesh leads by two points ahead of Poland's Duda Jan-Krzysztof. Wesley So of the United States holds third place with seven points, one point ahead of Carlsen, Anish Giri of Holland, and local player Ivan Saric.R Praggnanandhaa shares seventh place with American Fabiano Caruana, both at five points. France's Alireza Firouzja occupies ninth position with four points, while Uzbekistan's Nodirbek Abdusattorov sits in tenth place with three points.Playing with black pieces, Gukesh secured a memorable win against Carlsen in a format that he supposedly struggles in. Despite the Norwegian great gaining an apparent advantage with his king pawn opening, Gukesh found effective counter moves.The game saw Carlsen exchanging two minor pieces for a rook and two advancing pawns. However, Gukesh maintained his composure and capitalised on Carlsen's strategic error as time pressure mounted, securing victory after 49 moves.“Now we can question Magnus’ domination,” former world champion Garry Kasparov, who was on commentary for the official stream, said. “This is not just his second loss to Gukesh, it’s a convincing loss. It’s not a miracle… or that Gukesh just kept benefitting from Magnus’ terrible mistakes. It was a game that was a big fight. And Magnus lost.”Earlier that day, Gukesh had also defeated Abdusattorov and Caruana.","D Gukesh leads Super United Rapid and Blitz tournament in Zagreb, Croatia.

What is at stake for Bertoletti



A NEW CHAMPION 🌭 Patrick Bertoletti wins 2024 Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest 🏆

Patrick Bertoletti, the reigning champion of the Nathan’s Famous Fourth of July Hot Dog Eating Contest, is gearing up for a high-stakes title defense at Coney Island. After downing a personal best of 58 hot dogs last year to clinch the coveted Mustard Belt in Joey Chestnut’s absence, Bertoletti is now focused on pushing past the “60‑dog club. ” “I’ll be eating next to [Chestnut] and he’s crazy fast out of the gate. That’s just extra motivation and drive,” he tells TMZ Sports. With Chestnut—the long-time “Jaws” of competitive eating—making his comeback, what was a surprise championship could turn into one of the most intense rivalries in hot dog history.Bertoletti, 40, began competitive eating in 2007, earning the nickname “Deep Dish” through his record-breaking performances in events like chicken wings, cream-filled doughnuts, and peanut butter & jelly sandwiches. With that experience fueling his confidence, he’s embracing new pressure as the defending champ. “It does feel weird because […] I’m not used to being the champ…but it feels good,” he explains in the TMZ video.Bertoletti says the anxiety linked to the title isn’t negative—it’s energizing. With the goal of breaking the 60‑hot‑dog barrier, he’s strategically pushing his training. “The goal is to improve on 58…if I could get into the 60 club, […] but 60 would be great,” he states .He anticipates that Chestnut’s blistering pace will ground him in focus: “If you have somebody like that next to you pushing the pace, […] you’re just gonna be focusing on keeping up with him. ”Joey Chestnut, a 16‑time Nathan’s champion, was controversially barred from the 2024 contest due to a vegan sponsorship conflict but is set to return on July 4, 2025. With a staggering 76‑hot‑dog record in 2021 and an ambitious 80‑dog target this year, Chestnut’s comeback sets the stage for a showdown. His absence last year left fans and athletes like Bertoletti feeling the competition was incomplete. For Bertoletti, Chestnut’s presence is not just a challenge—it’s validation. “It didn’t feel right without him there,” he reflected.For Bertoletti, this year’s contest brings more than the title. Establishing himself in the “60‑dog club” would cement his status among the elite of the sport. Equally, it's a rare shot to beat Chestnut head‑to‑head—a victory that could redefine his career. The contest’s broader narrative—legendary return, underdog champion, historic milestone—is captivating audiences beyond typical food‐sport fans.Also read: Celebrities spotted at Wimbledon 2025: David Beckham, Nick Jonas, John Cena and more As Independence Day approaches and Coney Island prepares for its annual spectacle, the clash between Patrick Bertoletti and Joey Chestnut promises to deliver drama, records, and edge‑of‑seat competition.

Jerry Jones ’ daughter drops a brutal ultimatum that could shake up the Cowboys ’ future



The Dallas Cowboys didn’t just win in the 1990s—they changed the way NFL dynasties were built. Their championship run wasn’t just about athletic dominance but about the bold personalities who led it. Now, decades later, Netflix is pulling back the curtain on that unforgettable era with its new 10-part docuseries, America’s Team: The Gambler and His Cowboys, arriving August 19.This isn’t just another sports documentary. It’s a story of power, pride, and the price of success. Featuring household names like Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith, Michael Irvin, Deion Sanders, Jimmy Johnson, and Barry Switzer, the series promises never-before-seen footage from the Cowboys' 1990s reign. But more than anyone else, it’s Jerry Jones—the franchise’s owner, general manager, and face of the brand—who takes center stage.Jones’ daughter, Charlotte, helped drum up buzz with a playful Instagram tease: “Get your popcorn ready!” Yet a moment in the trailer has already stirred controversy. When Charlotte tells her father, “Dad, I don’t know anything about running a football team,” Jones replies with a smile, “Neither do I.”For some, it was a throwaway line. For others, it hinted at a deeper truth behind the Cowboys’ decades-long championship drought.The documentary takes viewers back to 1989, when Jerry Jones bought the struggling Cowboys and immediately brought in Jimmy Johnson as head coach. Johnson wasn’t just a tactician—he was a master motivator. He drafted key stars like Aikman, Smith, and Irvin and rebuilt a roster that would go on to win three Super Bowls in just four seasons.Johnson’s impact was profound. “When it comes to moving men, there was no one better than Coach Johnson,” Aikman once stated. Yet, despite the historic success, ego clashes behind closed doors would soon unravel the partnership. After back-to-back Super Bowl victories, Johnson left the franchise—frustrated by Jones’ desire for more control and recognition.Since then, many fans have pointed to Johnson’s exit as the moment the dynasty cracked. Although Jones built the Cowboys into one of the most commercially successful teams in sports history, the championships stopped coming.The upcoming series has sparked concern among fans that Jones may use the platform to reshape the narrative—perhaps painting himself as the genius behind the dynasty, rather than the man who disrupted it.Regardless of how the story is told, the legacy of that era is undeniable. The Cowboys of the '90s weren’t just champions—they were a phenomenon. And as Netflix gets ready to stream their story, old debates are flaring up again.

Tom Brady appears to be living his best post-retirement life, and his latest Mediterranean adventure with daughter Vivian is proof of that.

Free agent Jabari Walker inks two-way deal with Philadelphia 76ers after 188 games with Trail Blazers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/free-agent-jabari-walker-inks-two-way-deal-with-philadelphia-76ers-after-188-games-with-trail-blazers/articleshow/122238828.cms,"Jabari Walker.

The Philadelphia 76ers signed Jabari Walker



The Philadelphia 76ers have added another intriguing young forward to their roster. They have signed free agent Jabari Walker to a two-way contract ahead of the 2025–26 NBA season. The move comes as the team continues to build depth at the power forward position, following the earlier addition of Trendon Watford. Walker, who spent his first three seasons with the Portland Trail Blazers, brings a promising mix of youth and NBA experience.ESPN’s Shams Charania first broke the news, reporting, “Free agent forward Jabari Walker has agreed to a two-way NBA deal with the Philadelphia 76ers, source tells ESPN. Walker spent his first three NBA seasons in Portland, appearing in 188 games.”Walker, a second-round pick in the 2022 NBA Draft out of Colorado, had flashes of promise during his time in Portland. His 2023–24 campaign saw him play a key rotational role, averaging 8.9 points and 7.1 rebounds in 23.6 minutes across 72 games, including 23 starts.However, his playing time dipped this past season following the Blazers’ acquisition of Deni Avdija and the emergence of Toumani Camara.Despite a reduced role, Walker continued to produce efficiently in 60 games, averaging 5.2 points and 3.5 rebounds in 12.5 minutes per game while shooting a career-best 51.5% from the field and 38.9% from beyond the arc.Notably, Walker made the most of his perimeter opportunities, especially from the corners; 45.8% of his three-point attempts came from the corners, where he knocked down 45.5% of his shots. Though the volume was limited, the efficiency stood out.The 22-year-old stands 6-foot-9 and offers positional flexibility, capable of filling in at either forward spot. With his combination of rebounding, spot-up shooting, and size, he fits well into a Sixers roster that continues to prioritize youth and athleticism this offseason.Also Read: Natasha Cloud claps back at Donald Trump over Zohran Mamdani comments in bold rebuttal Still, Walker isn’t guaranteed NBA minutes right away. He’s expected to spend significant time with the Sixers’ G League affiliate, the Delaware Blue Coats, as he continues to develop his game. His two-way contract allows him to be active for up to 50 NBA games unless he is later promoted to a standard deal.","The Philadelphia 76ers have signed free agent Jabari Walker to a two-way contract.

Paige Bueckers breaks WNBA rookie record in Dallas Wings’ statement win over Phoenix Mercury



Paige Bueckers continued her electric rookie campaign with another milestone performance. She helped the Dallas Wings clinch a 98-89 victory over the Phoenix Mercury on Thursday night. The win marks the Wings’ fifth in their last seven games as the team rides a strong midseason surge. Bueckers' historic night powered the Wings to victory, but it has also made her place in the WNBA record books with yet another rookie benchmark.Paige Bueckers added another impressive feat to her resume by becoming the fastest WNBA player to reach 250 career points since Seimone Augustus in 2006. She accomplished the milestone in just her 13th game, surpassing Caitlin Clark’s mark, who needed 16 games to reach the same total.Bueckers finished the night with 23 points and six assists on a highly efficient 8-of-11 shooting performance.The WNBA Rookie of the Month for June and an All-Star starter in her first season, Bueckers has taken the league by storm, and Thursday’s game only further validated her elite potential. Her scoring display also marked her seventh 20-point game this season, giving her the third-most 20-point games by a rookie in franchise history.The Wings, who started the season 1-11, are now 6-13, showing signs of a major turnaround. Their victory over Phoenix was historic in more ways than one. Dallas became the first WNBA team to start four rookies in a game since the Minnesota Lynx did it in 2000.Aziaha James led the Wings with a sensational 28-point outing, adding six rebounds and six assists while shooting 55.6% from three-point range. “The Dallas Wings win their 5th of the last 7 games as they defeat the Phoenix Mercury 98-89 👏,” the WNBA posted on X. James also became just the fifth rookie in league history to post at least 25 points, five rebounds, five assists, and five made threes in a single game.JJ Quinerly contributed 17 points and a team-high seven assists, continuing the strong showing from Dallas’ young core.For the Mercury, Kahleah Copper dropped a season-high 33 points, knocking down 57.1% of her shots from deep.

Damian Lillard defends his value after being waived by the Milwaukee Bucks



Damian Lillard has found himself in unfamiliar territory as he is on the free agent market for the first time in his legacy-enriched NBA career. The Milwaukee Bucks waived the nine-time All-Star and seven-time All-NBA guard this week, ending his brief, injury-marred stint with the team. While Lillard continues to recover from a torn Achilles, Lillard clarified that he’s not lacking confidence or suitors. Despite questions about his future, several championship contenders are already circling. In a recent post on X, Lillard defended his prowess as a dominant NBA superstar and sent a message to the teams looking to sign him, saying that he is far from the “gamble” tag.The former Milwaukee Bucks guard, Damian Lillard, has recently addressed the narrative that signing him could be seen as a gamble. Taking to social media, Lillard stated plainly, “If they call it a ‘gamble’ at this stage… tell em this the jackpot. #ToBeContinued.” Lillard asserted that his presence is still a game-changer, injury or not.Lillard, who tore his Achilles in Game 4 of Milwaukee’s first-round playoff series against the Indiana Pacers, is expected to miss significant time next season, potentially the entire year. However, NBA insider Chris Haynes reported that Lillard is not closing the door on playing in 2025–26 if the right situation presents itself.“Sources: Free agent star Damian Lillard is open to signing with a team this offseason under the right terms and conditions as he continues rehabbing. He is receiving ample interest, but is in no rush to make a decision,” Haynes shared on X.The Bucks used the stretch provision to waive the remaining $113 million on Lillard’s contract, creating the cap space to sign former Indiana Pacers big man Myles Turner to a four-year, $107 million deal. As a result, per Bleacher Report, Milwaukee will now pay Lillard $22.5 million per year over the next five seasons, not to play for them.Lillard averaged 24.9 points, 7.1 assists, and 4.7 rebounds per game last season while shooting 44.8% from the field and 37.6% from three in 58 games. Those numbers prove he was still among the league’s top guards before the injury.Also Read: Free agent Jabari Walker inks two-way deal with Philadelphia 76ers after 188 games with Trail Blazers Of course, there will be a few teams looking to strike a deal with the veteran NBA star, and as for the “gamble” tag is concerned, when he’s healthy, he can be lethal on the court. Now, it would be interesting to see where Lillard would land.","Damian Lillard is on the free agent market for the first time in his NBA career.

Bombay Sport Exchange Episode 1: Interview with Sanjog Gupta, CEO (Sports) at JioStar

Poll What do you think about Kraigg Brathwaite's achievement of playing 100 Tests without a T20 appearance? Incredible achievement Unusual but admirable Not significant

West Indies opener Kraigg Brathwaite has reached a rare milestone, becoming the first cricketer in history to play 100 Test matches without ever featuring in a single T20 game, not even at domestic level. He achieved the same as West Indies took on Australia in the 2nd Test of the three-Test series in the National Cricket Stadium in Grenada.In an age dominated by white-ball cricket, Brathwaite’s career is a striking anomaly. A true red-ball specialist, he has etched his name in the record books through grit and resilience. Across 100 Tests and 191 innings, he has scored 5,943 runs, with 12 centuries and 31 fifties. His highest score remains 212, made against Bangladesh in 2014.Reacting to the unique achievement, the 32-year-old revealed that the record was not a chance occurrence. ""“I set that goal when I was probably 14 years old — to play 100 Tests,” Brathwaite said as quoted by ICC. “Now I’m here, 18 years later, playing my hundredth Test for West Indies. I’m very thankful, and I just want to be an inspiration for younger guys to follow. I didn’t want to just be another player — I wanted to make an impact.Another unique statistic underscores his durability as a Test opener: he is the only player in the format’s history to remain unbeaten in both innings of a match as an opener. He achieved this feat against Pakistan in Sharjah in 2016 with scores of 142* and 60*.Since his debut in 2011, Brathwaite has gradually become the backbone of the West Indies' Test lineup. He served as full-time captain from March 2021 to early 2024, leading the team in 39 Tests, which is also joint-fourth most for the Caribbean side alongside Sir Garry Sobers. Under his leadership, West Indies achieved landmark overseas wins, including at the Gabba in 2024 and Multan in 2025.He has faced more than 400 balls in a Test innings on five separate occasions, peaking with 673 deliveries against England in 2022, which remains the most by any West Indian in a single Test.Having reached the 100-Test landmark, Brathwaite stands as a throwback to a different era of cricket, where patience and an unwavering dedication to the red-ball game remains paramount.","Kraigg Brathwaite is the first cricketer in history to play 100 Test matches without ever featuring in a single T20 game, not even at domestic level.

Why does Malala Yousafzai believe empowering Afghan female athletes is so important

Malala Yousafzai points to FIFA ICC and international groups to lead change

Life for women changed drastically once the Taliban reclaimed control in Afghanistan in 2021. Schools were shut for girls, gyms were shut, and women athletes were not allowed to play and train anymore. Now, Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai is asking big sports groups to help Afghan women who had to leave their country. She says letting them play again is not just about sport, it’s a way to fight back against the Taliban’s rules. Groups like FIFA and ICC must now decide how to support these brave women.In a CNN Sports interview on July 1, 2025, Malala Yousafzai said that giving Afghan female athletes better chances to compete shows real “bravery and courage.” She wants international groups to act now. She said: “They can definitely find opportunities for these players to play, and this is a form of resistance against the Taliban”.The Taliban forbid women from sports, school, and public places. Female athletes have fled to places such as Australia but they are in exile. When Malala Yousafzai met the Afghan women's soccer team at the 2023 Women's World Cup, she felt their plight was especially tragic.She said: “It was truly heartbreaking … while stadiums were full, there was a team from Afghanistan who cannot play in their country”.Malala Yousafzai sees promises already made. In 2025, FIFA approved a Strategy for Action for Afghan women’s football. They said a refugee Afghan women’s team will begin “as soon as possible.” Malala Yousafzai calls this a “significant step forward” but she says it must go further.She also says the ICC set up a task force in April 2025 to support displaced female cricketers and offered help via a special fund. But many feel sports bodies are slow to act. Afghan player Mursal Sadat said the delay has already cost them two World Cup chances.Malala Yousafzai believes that if FIFA, ICC, and others are bold, they can give these women a platform. She said: “Playing and practicing every right for Afghan women is a form of resistance … against the Taliban”.Also Read: Taliban Bans Chess In Afghanistan, Calls It 'Haram'","Malala Yousafzai calls out FIFA and ICC for failing brave Afghan female athletes in exile.

“He ain’t big-boned. He about two chicken nuggets from tipping the scale.”

Terrell Owens says that Deebo Samuel is fat

“Deebo’s my guy, I love Deebo.”

Deebo Samuel’s weight has been a hot topic for over a year now



Not everyone found it funny, Terron Armstead claps back at TO



“Don’t just be throwing shots at a player for no reason… If we gonna talk football, let’s talk football.”

Well, Terrell Owens said what a lot of people were probably thinking but definitely wouldn’t say out loud. In a moment that instantly blew up online, the Hall of Fame wide receiver called Commanders WR Deebo Samuel “fat” and threw in the now-iconic one-liner.Yep. He really said that. And now the NFL world is spiraling with players clapping back, fans posting memes, and everyone arguing over whether this was locker-room banter or straight-up body-shaming.The clip is going viral for good reason. Owens made the comment during a casual interview, where he talked about current NFL stars and when Deebo Samuel’s name came up, TO didn’t pull any punches.After saying Deebo was “fat,” he doubled down with the chicken nugget quote that’s now living rent-free on NFL Twitter.To be fair, Owens tried to smooth it over by saying,But that didn’t stop the internet from roasting or defending both sides.The wild part? TO isn’t the first to bring this up. Even Deebo Samuel himself admitted last season that he was playing above his ideal weight, which may have impacted his performance.He was listed at 215 pounds but reportedly showed up around 225 lbs for the 49ers last season.Now that he’s with the Washington Commanders, fans expected a fresh start but thanks to TO, the Deebo weight debate is back on the table.Miami Dolphins offensive lineman Terron Armstead wasn’t here for the jokes. He fired back at Owens, saying:That sparked a bigger conversation about body-shaming in sports, with many fans and analysts saying legends like TO should uplift current players instead of tearing them down on camera.Some pointed out that weight talk especially when it comes from Hall of Famers can feel more like public humiliation than motivation.Let’s not forget, when Deebo is locked in and fit, he’s one of the most electric players in the league. A hybrid WR/RB who can wreck defenses, run through tackles, and take over games.If he shows up in peak form this season and silences all this chatter with highlight reels and touchdowns, you better believe he’ll own the moment.Also read - Travis Hunter’s wife Leanna Lenee gives fans inside look at their honeymoon in Turks and Caicos","Terrell Owens called Washington Commanders WR Deebo Samuel “fat’ and threw in the now-iconic one-liner.
