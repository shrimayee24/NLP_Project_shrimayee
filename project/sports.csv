Hardik Pandya Pranks Akash with Robot

Pakistani cricket player Haider Ali , 24, was arrested by Greater Manchester Police on rape charges . The incident allegedly occurred on July 23, 2025, in Manchester. He was released on bail while investigations continue. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has suspended him and is providing legal support during the UK investigation.Ali's cricket career began promisingly. He made his mark in the 2020 PSL with Peshawar Zalmi, scoring 239 runs with an impressive strike rate over 157. His international debut was memorable, scoring 54 runs off 33 balls in Manchester, helping Pakistan win by five runs.One of his international matches thereon came against India in the 2022 T20 World Cup in Australia where he scored just 2 runs before being dismissed by Hardik Pandya . During that match in October 2022, played at Melbourne Cricket Ground, Haider couldn't make a name for himself in arguably the biggest game in the sport as he holed out to Suryakumar Yadav.Despite his explosive batting style, Ali has struggled with consistency in his career. He has played two ODIs and 35 T20Is for Pakistan. The Shaheens tour was seen as a chance for him to return to form and fit into Pakistan's aggressive T20 playing style.Ali was touring with Pakistan's Shaheens squad, their 'A' team, in England when the arrest happened in Beckenham. He played all five games of the tour, including matches before and after the alleged incident. He was set to join the team in Australia for a T20 series but has been replaced by Mohammad Faiq.The police have said: ""After receiving a report on Monday 4 August 2025 of a rape, we have arrested a 24-year-old man. It's alleged that the incident occurred on Wednesday 23 July 2025 at a premises in Manchester. The man has since been bailed pending further enquiries. The victim is being supported by officers.""The PCB stated they ""fully respects the legal procedures and processes of the UK"" while providing Ali with legal support. The alleged offense carries a potential life sentence in the UK.","Haider Ali, 24, was arrested by Greater Manchester Police on rape charges.

Raptors‚Äô Perspective

A Potential Turning Point for Chicago

The, still in the thick of a rebuild after missing the postseason in seven of the past eight years, could be preparing for a significant roster shake-up. A recent trade pitch from Mark Morales-Smith of SI.com suggests the team could send forwardto thein exchange for wing scorer RJ Barrett.Morales-Smith‚Äôs mock deal positions Barrett as a potential cornerstone for the Chicago Bulls ‚Äô young core, which already features Josh Giddey , Matas Buzelis, Isaac Okoro, and recent No. 12 pick Noa Essengue.The Chicago Bulls remains in a contract stalemate with Giddey this summer, but plans to offer him a long-term extension are in motion. With promising frontcourt depth in place, the front office could be open to moving on from Patrick Williams, whose production hasn‚Äôt matched expectations since being drafted fourth overall in 2020.Despite an underwhelming track record, the Bulls extended Patrick Williams in June 2024 on a five-year, $90 million deal. Trading him for Barrett - who has posted All-Star-level numbers - would immediately give Chicago a dynamic scoring threat. Barrett would likely slot in as the team‚Äôs No. 1 offensive option, replacing some of the load that might be lost if Coby White departs in free agency next summer.Barrett, 25, has consistently proven his offensive value, averaging at least 19.6 points per game in each of the last four seasons. In his first full season with Toronto during 2024-25, he delivered:His scoring ability, rebounding presence, and playmaking would not only boost Chicago‚Äôs offense but also bring balance to a roster currently leaning on young talent with untapped potential.For the Toronto Raptors , this deal could be about adding long-term assets while gaining a young forward in Patrick Williams, who still carries upside despite inconsistent performance. Jevon Carter‚Äôs inclusion adds depth at the guard spot, and the first-round pick strengthens the Raptors‚Äô asset base.Also read: Warriors Rumors: Golden State Predicted to Cut Ties with Jonathan Kuminga for $69 Million Chicago Bulls Superstar Morales-Smith summed up the reasoning behind the swap by noting that moving on from Patrick Williams for Barrett ‚Äúwould fit Chicago‚Äôs rebuild and provide the team with a talented wing to pair with its young core.‚Äù If executed, the trade could mark a decisive step in reshaping the Chicago Bulls into a competitive force in the Eastern Conference over the next few seasons.","A recent trade pitch from Mark Morales-Smith of SI.com suggests the team could send forward Patrick Williams to the in exchange for wing scorer RJ Barrett.

Poll Has Mohammed Siraj proven himself as a leading pace bowler for India in Test cricket? Absolutely No Jasprit Bumrah is still the leader

Former Pakistan fast bowler Wasim Akram has stated that Mohammed Siraj has evolved beyond being just a support bowler to Jasprit Bumrah and is now capable of leading India's pace attack in Test cricket.Siraj demonstrated this by taking nine wickets in the recent Oval Test against England, helping India secure a six-run victory and level the five-match series, particularly with his crucial performance on the final day where he claimed three of the remaining four wickets when England needed just 35 runs.Siraj played all five Tests in the series against England, bowling over 185 overs and maintaining his intensity throughout the matches.""Siraj was full of hunger and passion ‚Äì it was an incredible effort. To bowl nearly 186 overs across five Tests and still be that fiery on the final day shows remarkable stamina and mental strength. He's not just a support bowler anymore,"" Akram said in an interview with Telecom Asia Sport.The Indian pacer showed resilience after a setback when he had miscalculated Harry Brook 's catch, stepping onto the boundary rope off Prasidh Krishna 's bowling, which allowed Brook to score 111 runs.""He's leading the attack and doing it with heart. Even when a catch went down‚Äì that of Brook ‚Äì he didn't lose focus. That's the mark of a fighter. Test cricket is alive and kicking,"" Akram added.Akram revealed his engagement with the final day's play at the Oval, highlighting the compelling nature of the match.""I rarely watch cricket when I'm not working, but I was glued to the last day,"" said Akram.""I gave India a 60 per cent chance on Day 5. They just needed that first breakthrough. With Woakes injured and India sensing blood, it was game on. Siraj made that possible,"" said Akram.The former Pakistan captain also commended India's strategic decision to rest Bumrah for the series decider.""It takes a brave team to rest their best bowler. But India had the bench strength, and the plan worked perfectly,"" he said.""With the Asia Cup in 2025 and the T20 World Cup in 2026 coming up, this kind of foresight is essential. Bumrah is vital across formats, and managing him well is key,"" he added.The match at the Oval showcased Siraj's evolution as a frontline bowler for India, with his performance helping the team achieve a memorable victory despite the absence of Bumrah. His ability to maintain intensity throughout the series and deliver crucial breakthroughs has earned him recognition from cricket experts like Wasim Akram.This performance has established Siraj's credentials as a leading pace bowler for India in Test cricket, capable of shouldering responsibilities in crucial matches and delivering under pressure situations. His growth from being a support bowler to leading the attack marks a significant development in India's pace bowling resources.","Wasim Akram believes Mohammed Siraj is now capable of leading India's pace attack in Test cricket.

Fortnite has recently announced its highly awaited collaboration with the Power Rangers. In this crossover, we will see The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers take action against the Kraken-borne bugs in Chapter 6 Season 4 in Fortnite.From the Mighty Morphin Megazord to themed weapons like the Swarmstrike Launcher and the OG ‚ÄúGo Go Power Rangers‚Äù theme song, this collaboration will have everything it it. However, the highlight of this collab has to be the Power Rangers costume, which fans can get early even before its actual release.Just like players were able to notch up the Fantastic Four skins early before their release by participating in the Fantastic Four Cup in Fortnite, now there is another couple of tournaments which can grant two Power Ranger skins early - Red Ranger Cup and Pink Ranger Cup.Both the cups are going to take place on August 6, 2025. These are going to be solo tournaments, where players will take part in standard Battle Royale matches. Players need to check out the in-game Compete tab to know the exact timings of these tournaments as they will vary depending upon different locations and time zones.The Red and Pink Rangers Cup will be available for only three hours. In this short span, players can enter a maximum of 10 matches per cup.If you are thinking about maximizing your chances by taking part in both the cups, then keep in mind that they will become live simultaneously and will expire at the same time. So, it is advised to the fans to only focus on one cup at a time.As the name suggests, these two cups will grant the Red Ranger and Pink Ranger outfits respectively. But how to get them? In order to obtain these skins for absolutely free, players need to be on the top spots for different regions in these tournaments. Players can score points to be in the leaderboards by winning matches and eliminating opponent players. Here is the region wise breakdown and top spots to secure the skins:Another interesting fact about these cups are that, these aren't region locked. So, if you are facing difficulties to be in the leaderboard in your native regions, then you will always have the option to change your server to any location for a favorable condition.However, those who fail to be in the top spots in these two cups, don‚Äôt need to be disappointed at all. If any player manages to score 8 points in either of the tournaments, then he will be rewarded with the Jason‚Äôs Mark Spray (Red Ranger Cup) or the Kimberly Was Here Spray (Pink Ranger Cup) or both.Usually players get their rewards from such tournaments immediately after these end. But the Red Ranger and Pink Ranger outfits will be available to the tournament winners at the start of Chapter 6 Season 4.Apart from the two tournaments, the Season 4 Battle Pass has also featured two different power ranger skins as well - the Green Ranger and the White Ranger.","Red and Pink Power Ranger Cups will grant players Power Ranger skins.

Friday night‚Äôs preseason game between the Detroit Lions and Atlanta Falcons at Mercedes‚ÄëBenz Stadium came to a sudden stop when Lions safety Morice Norris was taken off the field in an ambulance after a hard hit. With 14:50 left in the fourth quarter, Norris went low to tackle Falcons rookie running back Nathan Carter. His facemask hit Carter‚Äôs midsection, and his head snapped back from the impact.

Once medical personnel and the ambulance cleared the area, play technically resumed ‚Äì with Falcons quarterback Emory Jones taking a snap, though nobody was really ready to compete. With 6:31 remaining, an official announced the game was suspended ‚Äúper New York.‚Äù At that time, Detroit held a 17‚Äë10 lead.Detroit Lions head coach Dan Campbell said that the decision came from the coaching teams, not the league office. ‚ÄúRaheem Morris is the ultimate class act,‚Äù he said, adding ‚ÄúWe agreed it just didn't feel right to finish that game.‚ÄùLions quarterback Kyle Allen recalled that the severity was clear as soon as trainers rushed out with stretchers.‚ÄúUsually, you see a couple trainers out there,‚Äù Allen said, as quoted in ESPN. ‚ÄúIt's never good when they bring out the stretchers.

Curry‚Äôs Lasting Impact on the Game

My Opinion on Kerr‚Äôs Unique Perspective Carries Weight

When debates heat up about the NBA‚Äôs ‚Äúnext,‚Äù most fans point to LeBron James . Both are iconic athletes with multiple championships - six for Jordan, four for LeBron - and global recognition. But, who played alongside Jordan and coached against LeBron, has a different view. For him,is the player who most closely mirrors Jordan‚Äôs aura.On the ‚ÄúGlue Guys‚Äù podcast, Steve Kerr surprised many by naming Curry - not LeBron - as Michael Jordan ‚Äôs closest counterpart. His reasoning wasn‚Äôt based purely on stats or trophies. Instead, Kerr focused on the rare mindset they share.‚ÄúMichael had a similar mindset, but Michael‚Äôs mindset appeared to be more of a desire to kill an opponent, to just stick the knife in and twist it. Steph is more about the joy of the act of shooting the ball. That‚Äôs what makes it so beautiful to watch Steph,‚Äù Kerr said.Kerr stressed that his comparison isn‚Äôt about dominance through intimidation versus skill. Both Jordan and Curry inspire and elevate their teams, but in different ways:‚Ä¢ Jordan: Relentless, cutthroat competitor who thrived on breaking opponents‚Äô will.‚Ä¢ Curry: Energizes the game with joy, creativity, and unshakable self-belief.According to Kerr:‚Ä¢ Jordan: Asserted himself as the clear dominant force in any arena.‚Ä¢ Curry: Blends grace and flow with fierce competitiveness, using rhythm and confidence to take over games. Steve Kerr has great respect for LeBron, calling him and Jordan ‚Äúthe two best players I‚Äôve ever witnessed.‚Äù But he believes LeBron‚Äôs style aligns more with Scottie Pippen - a versatile, all-around forward - rather than Jordan‚Äôs alpha-killer mentality.Beyond championships, Curry has reshaped basketball. His influence on the three-point revolution and his unique approach to competition put him in rare company. For Kerr, Curry‚Äôs combination of skill, mindset, and joy for the game makes him Michael Jordan‚Äôs true modern-day parallel.Also read: NBA Schedule Leak: LeBron James and Lakers Reportedly Set for January 28 Clash against the Cleveland Cavaliers Kerr‚Äôs take is more than just opinion - it‚Äôs shaped by firsthand experience in both the Jordan and Curry eras.

Why the Los Angeles Lakers Might Hesitate

Malik Monk‚Äôs Rising Value

Potential Impact on Both Teams

The Sacramento Kings could be eyeing a bold roster shake-up, with a recent mock trade suggestingmight be heading to thein exchange for Rui Hachimura and future draft assets. The proposal, shared by Yahoo Sports, outlines a potential deal that could benefit both sides as they prepare for the 2025-26 NBA season.The suggested move would see the Sacramento Kings send Malik Monk, fresh off the best season of his career, to Los Angeles. In return, Sacramento would acquire Hachimura, a 2031 first-round pick, and a 2032 second-round pick.The Kings have resisted calls for a rebuild, instead keeping their core trio of Domantas Sabonis, DeMar DeRozan, and Zach LaVine intact. This offseason, they strengthened their roster by drafting Nique Clifford and Maxime Raynaud, and signing veteran point guard Dennis Schroder to replace De‚ÄôAaron Fox, who was traded last season.Adding Hachimura would give Sacramento an experienced forward capable of boosting their bench scoring‚Äîa weak spot in their previous campaign. At 27, Hachimura also offers long-term flexibility, potentially stepping into a starting role if the team decides to move on from DeRozan.From the Los Angeles Lakers ‚Äô perspective, Monk would immediately strengthen their guard rotation behind Luka Doncic , providing valuable scoring punch off the bench. However, giving up Hachimura and two future picks might be too steep a price for a single-season upgrade.Monk‚Äôs standout performance last season has elevated his trade value significantly. The Kings could capitalize on this by turning him into both roster depth and draft capital. This move would also clear playing time for Sacramento‚Äôs crowded backcourt, giving their younger guards more opportunities.‚Ä¢ Kings: Gain a versatile forward, future picks, and more guard rotation balance.‚Ä¢ Lakers: Add a proven scorer to bolster bench production behind their star backcourt.‚Ä¢ Long-term: Sacramento could improve flexibility for future trades or lineup changes, while Los Angeles gains immediate scoring support for a playoff push.As Nathaniel Holloway of Sports Illustrated noted, ‚ÄúIt is clear that Sacramento is looking to take advantage of his increased trade value and they would do just that in this trade.‚ÄùAlso read: Golden State Warriors Could End Jonathan Kuminga Dispute with Blockbuster Contract Move, Says NBA Insider Whether this deal gains traction or remains a speculative exercise, it focuses on both teams‚Äô search for strategic roster adjustments as the offseason winds down.","The Sacramento Kings could be eyeing a bold roster shake-up, with a recent mock trade suggestingmight be heading to the Los Angeles Lakers.

Legendary India off-spinner R Ashwin showered praise on 14-year-old batting prodigy Vaibhav Suryavanshi and revealed an interesting conversation between England cricketers Jos Buttler and Jofra Archer during an Indian Premier League (IPL) match.Suryavanshi caught everyone‚Äôs attention after Rajasthan Royals bought him for ‚Çπ1.1 crore at the IPL mega auction.

The next ball, I bowled slower. You‚Äôve kept wickets for me for a long time, so I wanted to see where he would go.

Poll Is Sanju Samson the right choice for CSK's future? Definitely Not sure No

NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer Kris Srikkanth has stirred the IPL chatter pot by declaring Sanju Samson as the ideal successor to MS Dhoni in the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) set-up, citing the Rajasthan Royals captain‚Äôs immense popularity in Tamil Nadu.Speaking on his YouTube channel on Saturday, Srikkanth praised Samson‚Äôs skills and brand value in Chennai while reacting to media reports suggesting that the Kerala-born wicketkeeper-batter could be on the move.‚ÄúTo tell you the truth, Sanju is a brilliant player and he is very popular in Chennai. He has got a good brand image in Chennai. As I said, I will be the first one to pick him for Chennai if he is willing to leave and comes this side,‚Äù Srikkanth said.Srikkanth, however, also noted that CSK already have Ruturaj Gaikwad as a long-term captaincy option. ‚ÄúHe is the right replacement for MS Dhoni. Dhoni can maximum play this season, maybe not the year after and then you can have a smooth transition. But I feel if Ruturaj Gaikwad has been given the captaincy, he should be continued with.‚ÄùDhoni, 44, is in the twilight of his glittering IPL career. Last season, he returned as captain after Gaikwad‚Äôs injury, but CSK struggled, finishing bottom with just four wins.Used as a finisher, Dhoni scored 196 runs at a strike rate above 135.Addressing rumours of a rift between Samson and Royals‚Äô head coach Rahul Dravid, Srikkanth stressed the franchise‚Äôs stake in the player. ‚ÄúThey have formed the team around him‚Ä¶ I would not let go of Sanju Samson. If they want to promote Riyan Parag as captain, that is their choice. I would still play Samson as a batter. He has been paid Rs 18 crore.‚ÄùSamson, who joined RR in 2013, has amassed 4,027 IPL runs, including two centuries.

The WNBA is having the worst kind of problem recently, what with s*x toys dying around the arenas during game time. Sophie Cunningham, who had previously posted a tweet asking fans to stop throwing these s*x toys in the court, actually got hit by one of them during her latest game. After the incident, remembering her mother‚Äôs warning before the game, Cunningham had the best response to the incident. But all that does not mean she is not going to enjoy her time while all this is going on.Sophie Cunningham, after her game against the Los Angeles Sparks, is having an excellent time, while also enjoying her games. She recently showed up twinning alongside teammate Lexie Hull, and fans couldn't help but be in awe of the two.She also took to her X (formerly Twitter) to quote-tweet one of her previous tweets. Previously, after the second time a s*x toy was thrown during a WNBA game, she had tweeted ""stop throwing d*ldos on the court‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre going to hurt one of us.‚Äù After the latest game against the Sparks, she quoted that same tweet, writing, ""this did NOT age well.""She also took to her Instagram stories later to say, ‚ÄúNo way that thing actually hit me.I knew I shouldn‚Äôt have tweeted that,‚Äù referring to the incident in court. Hopefully, those who have been throwing these things at the players can stop, and such incidents won't happen again.Indiana Fever guard Sophie Cunningham was up against the Los Angeles Sparks in her latest game, when yet another s*x you came flying in, and hit the WNBA star on her leg. The toy grazed her leg, and the play was halted for a short while to remove the offensive object from the court before things could resume. After the game, Cunningham sat for her new podcast show, Show Me Something, where she shared a hilarious warning he got from her mother.‚ÄúThe funny thing is my parents and my sister, they literally text me before every game saying, like, ‚Äògood luck.‚Äô My mom, instead of my ‚Äògood luck‚Äô text she goes, ‚ÄòWatch out for flying d*ldos tonight. And then the other one said, ‚ÄòDid you really just post the d*ldo tweet? It got some legs.‚Äô She goes, ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs funny a lot of others think so too.

BHUBANESWAR: Vithya Ramraj couldn‚Äôt have been luckier. The athlete from Coimbatore, who competed in 4x400m relay at the Paris Olympics, is doing what she loves the most. And with the people she loves the most.The 26-year-old, who will now compete in the 400m at the World Athletics Continental Tour Bronze event in Bhubaneswar on Sunday, couldn‚Äôt stop gushing about how special it was to play the sport alongside her twin sister, Nithya.Nithya has also made the cut for the event and will take part in the 200m sprint.Speaking about competing together, Vithya said, ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm tired of doing things repeatedly, or feel like vomiting, or have a lactic acid build-up, or even if I lie down on the track for a break, she (Nithya) will push me and encourage me to keep going on. She keeps telling me, ‚ÄòYou can do it. Come on. You are the best athlete on the track‚Äô. She‚Äôll also give me water, wake me up and tell me to run, run and run.‚ÄùIt‚Äôs indeed special to have someone support you in that way, and thanks to this mutual encouragement, the duo has achieved a lot. Apart from competing at the Olympics, Vithya, the elder of the two, won multiple medals at the Hangzhou Asian Games and a bronze in 400m hurdles at the Asian Athletics Championships in Gumi, South Korea, earlier this year.Now, she is in line to compete at the World Championships in 400m hurdles to be held in Tokyo in September.Nithya is the second-fastest 100m hurdler in the country, behind Jyothi Yarraji, after clocking 13.04 last year. She had a good outing at the Tamil Nadu State Athletics Championships in July. But she knows she will have to do much better in order to qualify for the Asian Games next year. ‚ÄúMy target will be to run 12.7 seconds in the coming months, and to achieve that, I will have to speed up in between my hurdles. For that, I will have to work on increasing my bone strength as well as my muscles,‚Äù said Nithya.The duo credited their coach Nehpal Singh for all their success. ‚ÄúIf I need anything, I go and ask him directly. If I‚Äôm having my periods, or have stomach pain or chest pain, I can tell him without hesitation. Also, if I want to wear something stylish during the races, I‚Äôll ask him whether it looks good,‚Äù added the younger of the two.Their coach was also more than happy to see them succeed and said, ‚ÄúI would say that chemistry is all that works finally because it‚Äôs not who you are or what you are, it‚Äôs what you make as a team (that matters).‚ÄùBut as far as this competition is concerned, he doesn‚Äôt want to push the duo too much. He wants them to achieve their personal best timings and stay in good shape ahead of the Inter-state Athletics Championships to be held in Chennai later this month.",Vithya Ramraj will compete in the 400m at the World Athletics Continental Tour Bronze event in Bhubaneswar on Sunday. Her twin sister Nithya has also made the cut for the event and will take part in the 200m sprint.
