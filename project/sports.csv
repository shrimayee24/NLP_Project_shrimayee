Hailee Steinfeld opens up about tough decision to step away from music and why she’s finally returning

Hailee Steinfeld’s unexpected break from music has left fans puzzled, especially given her early success in the industry. While she claims it was a personal choice to focus on acting, her recent comments have stirred speculation about whether deeper industry pressures or behind-the-scenes conflicts influenced her decision.Hailee Steinfeld, known for balancing an impressive dual career in acting and music, is finally shedding light on why she pressed pause on her musical journey—and what brought her back.The actress and singer made waves in 2015 with her hit debut single Love Myself, which quickly propelled her into pop stardom. Followed by fan favorites like Starving and Most Girls, Steinfeld's music career looked destined for long-term success. However, after the release of her 2020 EP Half Written Story, she seemingly stepped back from the spotlight—at least musically.In a recent interview with Collider, Steinfeld reflected on that turning point and revealed how hard it was to put her music on hold. “I had taken a bit of a break from music, which was a very difficult decision to make, but I wanted to focus on my acting and was happy to be doing that,” she explained.While fans may have missed her voice on the charts, Steinfeld’s film and television work continued to soar. From starring in major roles to voicing Gwen Stacy in Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, her acting career demanded attention—and energy.But despite the shift in priorities, music never stopped being part of her life. “Music is a love of mine and a huge passion and something that has played a very strong role in my life in more ways than one, and having had the opportunity to make music through the years of my own is something I will never take for granted,” Steinfeld shared.Now, the 28-year-old is reuniting her two creative loves with her latest project, Sinners, a film where music plays a central role. Not only is she starring in the movie, but she also performs Dangerous, a powerful track on the film’s soundtrack.“I felt so, so lucky to be a part of a movie like Sinners where music is such a huge part of it,” she said. “This is the dream—for me to be acting in a film that is so driven and moved by music. I was able to open the door again to work on something that I'm very, very, very excited about and can't wait to share more with people. It's been a long time, and I didn't realise how much I missed it.”Also Read: Hailee Steinfeld makes emotional musical comeback with new song featured in her upcoming horror film ‘Sinners’ Steinfeld’s return to music may not be a full comeback just yet—but for fans, it’s a promising sign that the best of both worlds could soon be back.","Hailee Steinfeld took a break from music to focus on acting.

Kaylee Hartung reveals emotional toll of rising success at Amazon

Kaylee Hartung Is Not Gonna Lie!

Charissa Thompson fades from the NFL spotlight but rebounds in unexpected way

In the high-stakes world of NFL broadcasting , few stories are as layered as that of Kaylee Hartung and Charissa Thompson . Both respected voices on the sidelines, their careers have taken dramatically different turns in recent months—one climbing the ladder, the other navigating a sudden, silent exit.After a successful stint with major networks like CBS, CNN, and ESPN, Hartung joined Amazon Prime Video ’s Thursday Night Football crew in 2022. The move was a major leap forward—but it also came with internal battles. In a raw moment on the Not Gonna Lie podcast with Kylie Kelce, Hartung admitted that her work-focused lifestyle left little room for personal joy.“It’s not a crime if you don’t have hobbies,” she said. “I’ve prioritized my career. Fault me for it if you’d like – I need to call my mom, my grandmother … I don’t play pickleball — I don’t think that makes me a bad person.” Hartung’s vulnerability resonated with listeners, highlighting how even high achievers grapple with feelings of guilt and self-doubt.While Hartung is finding her voice, Thompson’s journey has taken a surprising turn. After her FOX contract quietly expired post-Super Bowl—with no renewal or Emmy nods—the once-prominent host seemed to vanish from the NFL spotlight. This shift followed backlash from a past podcast admission where Thompson revealed, “I’ve sometimes made up sideline reports when coaches gave me nothing.” Though she later apologized, the controversy lingered.Still, Thompson didn’t let the fallout define her. In a bold career pivot, she signed on with Blue Origin to cover the New Shepard Mission NS-31—the first all-female space crew since 1963. “Let’s goooooooo, thrilled to be joining @blueorigin for this historic launch!!!” she announced on Instagram, signaling a powerful comeback.Also Read: From Hollywood sweetheart to controversy magnet: Has Josh Allen's fiance Hailee Steinfeld’s public image taken a hit in 2025?

Aaron Rodgers may prioritize retirement over return without Super Bowl opportunity



Could Rodgers RETIRE instead of picking Steelers?

Aaron Rodgers continues to keep the NFL world in suspense as the 2025 season looms. The four-time MVP and Super Bowl XLV champion hasn’t confirmed whether he plans to lace up his cleats again—but what’s increasingly evident is that Aaron Rodgers isn’t coming back just to fill a roster spot. According to CBS Sports, the 41-year-old quarterback is more likely to retire than return to a team that doesn’t offer a realistic shot at winning it all.Aaron Rodgers' future remains one of the league’s biggest unanswered questions. After a rocky stint with the New York Jets marred by injuries and inconsistent performances, the legendary quarterback has kept fans and franchises guessing. He has visited potential suitors like the Pittsburgh Steelers, who remain the most visibly interested team, but no official decision has been made. Adding to the intrigue, Rodgers has also been linked to the New York Giants and the Seattle Seahawks—both of whom have since committed to other quarterbacks in Russell Wilson and Sam Darnold.For Aaron Rodgers, it’s no longer about adding more numbers to an already Hall of Fame-worthy résumé. CBS reporter Aditi Kinkhabwala reported that he is “intellectually stimulated by more than football” and emphasized, ""It’s extremely clear Rodgers is not going to play just for the sake of playing."" That sentiment has only intensified the sense that unless a team with a clear path to the Lombardi Trophy steps forward, Rodgers may be ready to walk away from the game.The Steelers' interest is understandable. Pittsburgh has released both Russell Wilson and Justin Fields, leaving them with Mason Rudolph as their only signed quarterback after his two-year, $8 million return deal. While Rudolph offers reliability, he is still largely viewed as a backup option, which explains why the Steelers are aggressively scouting for a starting-caliber signal-caller.Despite their strong culture and consistent winning seasons under head coach Mike Tomlin, the Steelers haven’t been past the Wild Card round since 2016. Their last Super Bowl appearance came in 2010—ironically, against Rodgers and the Packers. This offseason, they’ve made some bold moves to improve their offense, including a trade for DK Metcalf, signaling that the organization is aiming for more than just a playoff berth.But does Rodgers believe that Pittsburgh is truly built to win now? According to NFL insider Josina Anderson, someone within the Steelers organization described the vibe surrounding Rodgers as “a little weird,” suggesting that there might be more complexity to these talks than meets the eye.At 41, Rodgers is just one season removed from a serious Achilles injury. His 2024 performance with the Jets was far from inspiring—his team went 5-12, and he finished 28th in QBR, even behind rookie Aidan O’Connell. Despite having talented offensive weapons like Garrett Wilson, Davante Adams, and Breece Hall, the Jets struggled to compete, particularly in the highly competitive AFC East.Gone are the days when Rodgers’ mere presence could instantly elevate a team into Super Bowl contention. With his physical prime behind him and his legacy secured—10 Pro Bowl nods, four MVPs, one Super Bowl title, and over 4,000 passing yards in 10 seasons—Rodgers seems unwilling to endure another campaign that ends in mediocrity.Whether he ultimately joins the Steelers or retires, one thing is becoming increasingly clear: Aaron Rodgers is not interested in playing unless it’s with a team capable of winning it all. The ball is now in the NFL’s court.Also Read: Is Taylor Swift too ‘white bread’ for Coachella’s cool crowd?

Lifelong Raiders fan Ice Cube shares who he believes can save the team,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/lifelong-raiders-fan-ice-cube-shares-who-he-believes-can-save-the-team/articleshow/120379008.cms,"Ice Cube, a devoted Raiders fan, reveals his preferred pick for the team’s upcoming draft. (Credit: Getty Images)

West Coast legend Ice Cube wants Raiders to take this rising star in the draft



The connection between the Las Vegas Raiders and legendary rapper Ice Cube has always run deep. From the streets of Compton with N.W.A to the stands of the Coliseum, Ice Cube has long been a vocal ambassador of Raider Nation. And even though the franchise has since moved from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, Cube’s loyalty to the Silver and Black remains unshakable.Now, as the 2025 NFL Draft approaches, the iconic artist and BIG3 founder has made his pick clear—he wants Shedeur Sanders in Silver and Black.“Of course!” Ice Cube responded when asked if the Raiders should use their sixth overall pick on Sanders. “I think his pedigree— you can't dismiss that. He's seen how to do it on the professional level for a very long time... Has a great, amazing coach [and father] in Hall of Famer Deion Sanders. ... If he's there I think the Raiders should take him.”There’s more to Cube’s enthusiasm than celebrity excitement. Shedeur, the son of Hall of Famer Deion Sanders, brings not only impressive stats but a football IQ nurtured from childhood. With the pressure and attention that comes from being “Prime Time’s” son, Shedeur has grown into a confident, composed leader—traits that may align well with Pete Carroll’s vision for the Raiders.Still, Cube’s not blind to the team’s broader needs. “They've gotta still deal with some great quarterbacks in the AFC West, so we gotta make sure we can stop somebody,” Cube noted. “Cause scoring ain't the only thing, we've got some great quarterbacks out here.”Indeed, while the Raiders have struggled on both sides of the ball, defensive consistency has been elusive in recent seasons. Cube’s remarks underline the importance of balance—a sentiment likely shared in the Raiders’ front office.As it stands, many mock drafts suggest the Raiders may lean toward Boise State’s Ashton Jeanty at No. 6, addressing depth and explosiveness in the backfield. However, the prospect of pairing Pete Carroll with Shedeur Sanders might prove too tempting to ignore, especially with quarterback Geno Smith already on the roster.Smith, who reunited with Carroll after a trade from Seattle this offseason, is expected to start. Yet at 35 years old, he may not be the long-term solution. Sanders could step in as an heir apparent, learning under a seasoned vet while adapting to the pro game.Even if the Raiders don’t select Sanders, sources suggest a young quarterback will still be brought in to develop behind Smith and challenge Aidan O’Connell for the backup role. But if Shedeur falls out of the top three and into Vegas’ lap, Ice Cube—and perhaps the Raider faithful—might just get their wish.Also Read: When is the 2025 NFL schedule dropping?

Tua Tagovailoa backstabbing Jalen Hurts as the Dolphins try to rip DeVonta Smith from the Eagles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/tua-tagovailoa-backstabbing-jalen-hurts-as-the-dolphins-try-to-rip-devonta-smith-from-the-eagles/articleshow/120365095.cms,"The Miami Dolphins are reportedly negotiating a trade for DeVonta Smith, a player they are considering to acquire from the Eagles, amid ongoing controversy between Tua Tagovailoa and Jalen Hurts (Image via AP)

Dolphins sign tight end Jack Stoll, a former Jalen Hurts teammate

There’s a lot of chatter around Tua Tagovailoa and Jalen Hurts again, but this time it’s not about college drama, it's about a strategic NFL move. The Miami Dolphins recently signed tight end Jack Stoll , a former teammate of Jalen Hurts from the Philadelphia Eagles . Media outlets are framing it like Tua is ""stealing a gem"" from Hurts, fueling another round of comparisons between the two quarterbacks.Jack Stoll spent four years with the Eagles and was known more for his blocking than receiving; he only had 20 catches for 183 yards and no touchdowns in that time. Still, he was a reliable and familiar presence for Hurts, especially in two tight end sets. The Dolphins saw potential in him, especially as they continue to build depth behind their starters.This move adds to the ongoing narrative that’s followed Tua and Jalen since their Alabama days, when Tua famously replaced Hurts in the 2018 national championship game. Despite the competition, both quarterbacks have expressed mutual respect and have even stayed in touch, occasionally sharing tips and insights about opponents in the league.So, while the media’s spinning this as another Tua-vs-Hurts rivalry, it’s really more of a typical NFL roster move. Jack Stoll, the tight end in question, wasn’t a headline-maker in Philadelphia, but he brought consistency and chemistry with Hurts from their shared time on the field. Now, with the Dolphins picking him up, the narrative is being painted as if Tua is taking something valuable from Jalen.The NFL offseason heats up as reports from ESPN reveal the Miami Dolphins are looking to trade star cornerback Jalen Ramsey. Despite strong performances over two seasons, GM Chris Grier confirmed the team is exploring options to move on from the All-Pro defender.ESPN has proposed a bold trade: the Dolphins would send Jalen Ramsey, the 13th overall pick, and a 2026 second-rounder to the Eagles for star receiver DeVonta Smith and the 32nd pick. While Philly could benefit from Ramsey’s veteran presence on a rebuilding defense, parting with Smith won't be easy. Still, with A.J. Brown leading their receiving corps, the Eagles might consider the move.Also Read: “Tom Brady is like a scrub”: Tom Brady criticized for ignoring Gisele Bündchen’s dating past with DiCaprio, says Pearl Davis in fiery rant If the trade goes through, it could reshape both teams, boosting Miami’s offense with a dynamic weapon for Tua Tagovailoa and strengthening Philly’s defense with a seasoned star.

Swifties picked up on a subtle but sweet connection between Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift ’s lyrics in her song “So High School,” and it all started with a casual moment on his podcast. During the April 17 episode of New Heights, Travis was chatting with his brother Jason when he brought up the first R-rated movie he remembered watching as a kid, American Pie .Travis Kelce didn’t mention Taylor Swift or her song at all but Swifties immediately connected the dots. In “So High School,” Taylor sings, “I’m watching American Pie with you on a Saturday night,” and fans believe the song is about Travis. His random mention of the movie felt like an unspoken confirmation.He said, “The one I remember watching that I didn’t even realize was rated R was ‘American Pie,’ and that was when we were, like, 10… I was just f–king going to the movies.” The brothers laughed about how laid-back their parents were when it came to movies.Though Kelce hasn’t officially confirmed the exact story behind it, fans strongly believe it nods to a personal, cozy moment the two shared, likely watching the 1999 teen movie American Pie together. The song is filled with high school-style imagery, like playing ""Truth or Dare"" and hanging out while video games play in the background, suggesting she’s painting a picture of innocent, nostalgic love, something that reminds her of being young and carefree with him.He mentioned, “I forget how I got in. I might have been there with someone else’s parents.” The song, from The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology, includes more nods to Kelce, like “You know how to ball, I know Aristotle,” and “marry, kiss or kill me” a clear reference to Kelce’s 2016 game where he said he’d kiss Swift. Kelce later told People that “So High School” is his favorite song from the album, adding, “I’m a little biased.”Interestingly, actress Alyson Hannigan, who played Michelle in American Pie, was thrilled by the reference. She said she had a full-on “freakout” when she heard it and even woke up her family to share her excitement, feeling like she was witnessing a cute date between Taylor and Travis.Also Read:Their relationship, filled with playful moments and personal references, continues to inspire Swift’s lyrics turning real-life memories into music that fans love decoding.

Auston Matthews, Mitch Marner and team chemistry drive results



With a dominating 4-0 win over the Buffalo Sabres , the Toronto Maple Leafs not only secured their inaugural Atlantic Division title , but also delivered a clear message: this is a different team. Guided by head coach Craig Berube and super-ace Auston Matthews , who scored his 400th goal in his NHL career, the Maple Leafs are changing gears to end years of playoff despair on a more even and defense-focused note.With one game remaining in the regular season, the Toronto Maple Leafs (51-26-4) have already set their franchise record for most road victories (25) and secured the second seed in the Eastern Conference. But it's not merely the statistics—it's the story. Under Craig Berube, Toronto is finally balancing offensive punch with defensive toughness, a combination they believe will take them deep into the Stanley Cup Playoffs .Craig Berube, who infamously led the St. Louis Blues to a Stanley Cup championship in 2019, has quickly instilled a winning culture and tactical accountability into the Toronto Maple Leafs' locker room. And that is manifesting on the ice. In their last 15 games, Toronto was 12-2-1, including an eight-game winning streak where they beat opponents 28-12. The team's defensive responsibility has been an eye-opener.The team’s buy-in has been central to Berube’s strategy. “You’re always trying to work on your identity. And that hasn’t stopped throughout the season,” he stated. “I think our guys have done a good job of it. I think we’re in a good spot, but we’ve got to keep making sure we’re pounding away at it and keep working on it and be ready to go.”“I think we’re prepared,” said Auston Matthews, the 2016 NHL Draft’s No. 1 overall pick. “Obviously, we can’t change what’s happened in the past. I think you wear that. So I feel really confident in this group. I think we put in a lot of work over the season. Obviously, earning the division [title] here is a big step for us. But we just want to continue to push forward.”Steven Lorentz, a Stanley Cup champion last year with the Florida Panthers, said, “The whole season’s a learning curve, especially with a new coach coming in, new systems. It’s different from the style of play that this team’s played with in previous seasons.”Auston Matthews is not the only one making personal history. Forward Mitch Marner recorded his first 100-point season, further establishing that the Maple Leafs have not lost offense for structure. Toronto's 263 goals place them again in the NHL's top 10 in scoring—making their ninth straight year in that group.But where this Maple Leafs team stands out is in their defensive improvement. With just 226 goals conceded, they rank 10th league-wide in goals against, a significant leap from previous seasons.Toronto now shifts attention to the first-round playoff series against the Ottawa Senators—again igniting the legendary ‘ Battle of Ontario ’.Also read: Craig Berube’s lighthearted take on the Toronto Maple Leafs’ defensive Crisis vs. the Montreal Canadiens With the playoffs on the horizon, critics and fans alike will be closely observing to determine if this revamped Toronto Maple Leafs team can once and for all put their playoff ghosts behind them.

Poll Is it time for Rohit Sharma to retire from IPL? Maybe, it depends on his next performances. No, he deserves another chance. Yes, he should retire now.

NEW DELHI: Rohit Sharma 's scores in the ongoing Indian Premier League season read: 0, 8, 13, 17, 18, and 28. The Mumbai Indians stalwart, who has led the franchise to five IPL titles, is currently enduring a rough patch with the bat.On Thursday, skipper Hardik Pandya brought Rohit in as an Impact Player against Sunrisers Hyderabad , but the veteran batter’s struggles continued. He managed just 26 runs before being dismissed by Pat Cummins.In six innings so far, Rohit has scored only 82 runs at a disappointing average of 13.66.His lean run has drawn sharp criticism from former India opener Virender Sehwag , who didn’t mince words. Sehwag cautioned Rohit about protecting his legacy and even suggested that it might be time for him to consider stepping away from the format.“If you look at Rohit's IPL numbers in the last 10 years, he scored more than 400 runs only once. So he is not the kind of player who thinks that I need to score 500 or 700 runs. If he thinks, he might. When he became the Indian captain, he said that he wanted to be the player who wants to cash in on the powerplay and take the chances, so he wanted to make all the sacrifices alone, but he is not considering the fact that at the end of the day when he is not performing, it is your legacy that is getting hurt,"" Sehwag told Cricbuzz.""Ab uska jaane ka time aa gaya, (It's already time for him to retire), and before retiring, you would want to give fans something to remember you by, and not moments that force them to think, why are they not dropping him,” he said.“Take 10 balls extra, but at least play and give yourself a chance. He has been getting out to that pull shot many times against the back of the length deliveries. So he should decide that in one innings he will not play the pull shot at all. But who will explain it to him? There should be someone telling him to play normal cricket. When I was there, Sachin, Dravid or Ganguly used to tell me to play normal cricket,” he added.A disciplined performance from the bowling unit, spearheaded by Jasprit Bumrah and captain Hardik Pandya, powered Mumbai Indians to a four-wicket win over Sunrisers Hyderabad in a low-scoring clash at the Wankhede Stadium.Will Jacks emerged as the standout performer for Mumbai, picking up two key wickets and contributing a crucial 36 with the bat to steer the team to their second consecutive victory in IPL 2025 .This marked Mumbai Indians’ third win of the season, taking their tally to six points and lifting them to seventh place in the standings—breaking free from the congestion of teams stuck at four points near the bottom.

From gridiron greatness to emotional vulnerability



When public image collides with private battles



Even the most successful athletes face challenges that stats and accolades can’t capture—and Tom Brady is no exception. Widely regarded as the greatest quarterback in NFL history , Brady's legendary career boasts an unmatched seven Super Bowl titles, yet behind the shine of championship rings lies a more vulnerable, human side he’s beginning to share with the world.For two decades, Tom Brady maintained a laser focus on football, becoming the ultimate symbol of discipline and competitive excellence. But recently, the 46-year-old has revealed glimpses of his personal struggles, particularly in the wake of his divorce from supermodel Gisele Bündchen . Brady, who is usually tight-lipped about his private life, opened up about the emotional toll of navigating heartbreak, admitting he’s dealt with moments of “willful blindness.”This phrase—suggesting a conscious decision to ignore uncomfortable truths—points to the complexities Brady faced in his marriage’s unraveling. While he didn’t name names, the context was unmistakable, especially given recent headlines surrounding Bündchen's ongoing relationship with her jiu-jitsu trainer, who is now widely rumored to be her partner and the father figure in her children’s lives.“Willful blindness” is not just a phrase—it’s a powerful acknowledgment of emotional compromise. Brady’s reflection reveals the cost of chasing perfection on the field while personal issues simmer in the background. The quarterback, once seemingly invincible both in his career and family life, now speaks like someone reckoning with the pain of being left behind. For fans, it’s a rare and raw admission: the GOAT is still just a man.The emotional fallout of watching Bündchen move on publicly is undoubtedly difficult for someone so accustomed to control and success. Reports of her being seen with her new partner and children add emotional weight to Brady’s recent comments, suggesting a sense of betrayal or at least loss.Also Read: Fresh discussion on Tom Brady and Gisele’s Bündchen’s marriage reignites debate over missed red flags Brady’s recent openness signals a shift—not just for him but for the culture surrounding sports icons. His words serve as a reminder that personal pain doesn't discriminate by fame or fortune. As he transitions into the next chapter of his life, his legacy will now also include emotional authenticity—proof that true greatness isn't only measured by rings, but by the willingness to confront what hurts behind closed doors.","Tom Brady has revealed glimpses of his personal struggles, particularly in the wake of his divorce from supermodel Gisele Bündchen.

NEW DELHI: Mumbai Indians skipper Hardik Pandya credited his bowlers for effectively using variations and executing plans smartly on a sluggish wicket, as his side secured a four-wicket win over Sunrisers Hyderabad in their IPL match at the Wankhede Stadium on Thursday.MI restricted SRH to 162 for five and chased down the target with 11 balls to spare, finishing at 166 for six in 18.1 overs.""I think the way we bowled today was very smart and spot on. We stuck to simple basic plans. Certain balls were not easy to hit. Credit to the bowlers that we made them hit some good shots. We were kind of squeezing them,"" Pandya said at the post-match presentation.The MI captain noted that the pitch offered some early assistance, which the bowlers capitalised on.""If you look at it, had a nice green grass look to it. The first couple of overs that Deepak (Chahar) bowled, couple of balls got stuck in. We decided to use change of pace balls. As soon as we figured out, we trying to mixing it up.""We executed the yorkers very smartly well."" Will Jacks was the standout performer for Mumbai, returning impressive figures of 2/14 before scoring a brisk 36 off 26 balls to help his team notch their second straight win of the season.""That is the beauty of Jacks.

We wanted to take our time.""Meanwhile, SRH captain Pat Cummins admitted his side fell short of a competitive total on a challenging surface.""It wasn't the easiest wicket. Few runs short, we would have liked a couple more with the bat. Tricky wicket, when you come here you expect it to be really fluent and fast, just wasn't that,"" he said.MI bowlers were clinical as they kept the SRH batting line-up in check, not allowing them to break free at any stage of the innings.""They bowled really well, shut down a lot of our hitting areas. I thought we had all our bases covered, with 160 you feel like you are a little bit short,"" Cummins added.""We gave it a good crack with the ball. We thought we needed wickets, we had plenty of death bowling, we knew the impact player would bowl 1-2 overs that's why we went with Rahul.""For SRH, it was their fifth loss in seven games this season.""You have got to play well away from home to make the final, unfortunately it hasn't clicked so far this season, we have a short break and we go again,"" he said.""Every game we talk about assessing, the boys did well to get through the powerplay and there wasn't reckless hitting, next game is at home and we know that venue pretty well.""","Mumbai Indians beat Sunrisers Hyderabad by four wickets in IPL match.

Poll What do you think is the main reason for Rohit Sharma's struggle in the IPL? Opposition bowlers are too strong Injury concerns Pressure of captaincy Loss of form

Bombay Sport Exchange EP 3: Kane Williamson exclusive on NextGen cricketers to watch out for

NEW DELHI: ' Koi garden mein nahi ghoomega ’—a fiery on-field remark by Rohit Sharma during a Test match—took social media by storm earlier this year. The Indian skipper has now finally opened up about the story behind the viral line that quickly became a fan favourite.The incident took place during the second Test against England in Visakhapatnam in February 2024. Rohit was caught on the stump mic urging his teammates to show more urgency during a critical phase of the match. The phrase instantly struck a chord with fans and has been widely shared online ever since.Rohit has now explained the context of his now-famous words.“It was in Vizag, I saw the over ended and the players were leisurely walking as if they were in a garden. No one was running, there was no urgency in the field. I was fielding in the slip, we had spinners bowling from both ends. The game was hanging by a loose thread, it was an important game, we had to win. I had told the players in the morning that we need to put in some extra effort but they were having fun in the ground,” Rohit said on JioHotstar.He added that India desperately needed a breakthrough at that point, and he was frustrated with the lack of intensity.“So I saw it for two-three overs and then said things can't go on like this, you can't play cricket like this. Everyone was just going with the flow which annoyed me and then I told everyone not to be like that. A partnership was going on, I was desperate to get a wicket. In such moments everyone needs to put in a collective effort. At that moment, I saw everyone being busy with themselves which I didn't like,” he added.Meanwhile, Rohit’s recent form in the IPL continues to be a concern. On Thursday, Mumbai Indians skipper Hardik Pandya brought him in as an Impact Player against Sunrisers Hyderabad, but the veteran batter’s struggles persisted. He managed just 26 runs before falling to Pat Cummins.So far, Rohit has scored only 82 runs in six innings at a disappointing average of 13.66.The lean patch has drawn sharp criticism from former India opener Virender Sehwag, who has not held back in his assessment. Sehwag cautioned Rohit to safeguard his legacy and even suggested that it might be time for the former MI captain to consider stepping away from the format.",Rohit Sharma's 'Koi garden mein nahi ghoomega' comment took social media by storm.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin. The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee. England completely skipped Saturday's practice, but many India players also skipped the optional session.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118081067,imgsize-126924,width-400,resizemode-4/118081067.jpg"

. falls in trouble over a after the umpire argued over third strike Chisholm says he was emotional and lost his cool



What happened led to Jazz Chisholm Jr. being upset mid game?

Jazz Chisholm said he lost his cool

“I’m out here trying to win a game, I’m out here battling the best and working my butt off every at-bat. I’m trying to be the best player I can be. So when I feel like something’s messed up, I lost my emotions, I lost my cool.”

“At the same time, I still gotta be able to stay out there and go out and play defense for my team. That’s why I’m here, to be able to stay out there, hit in the middle of the lineup and play defense. On me, I gotta be better in that aspect for helping my team.”

The New York Yankees have managed to win their fourth game in a row. They beat the Tampa Bay Rays by 6-3 on Thursday night, however, what followed next, was straight out of a movie scene. Yankees’ second baseman, Jazz Chisholm Jr. couldn’t attend the celebrations, since he was thrown out of the game by the umpire after arguing about a third strike. The pitch looked like it was too low, but the umpire still called it a strike, forcing Jazz to be upset about the whole situation.Interestingly, when Jazz Chisholm Jr. was kicked out of the game, he went on social media and posted, “Not even f---ing close!” since he was angry about the strike call. However, later he deleted the post.

Sunrisers Hyderabad:

Mumbai Indians:

Riding on Will Jacks ' all-round performance, Mumbai Indians defeated Sunrisers Hyderabad by four wickets with 11 balls remaining in Match No. 33 of the Indian Premier League (IPL) at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai on Thursday.Jacks provided Mumbai Indians with crucial breakthroughs by removing the dangerous Travis Head and Ishan Kishan with his off-spin.""Pretty happy. Three lefties in the top, so knew I had a chance to bowl. Definitely some turn. Some grip for the seamers. Sunrisers saw us bowl, we'll do the same thing. We need to be smart and chase the score down. We had a clear plan,"" Jacks told broadcasters during the mid-innings break.""I was informed yesterday I would be bowling. The coach and the captain gave me the confidence. So, I kept going. I think we are happy with the target. We saw it was difficult at the top. Hopefully, we will see it off at the top, take it deep and chase it down.""This was Mumbai Indians' second consecutive victory. The home team dominated the match, finding much-needed momentum.Hardik Pandya's decision to bowl first on a slightly damp pitch proved effective. At the toss, Hardik Pandya said the decision was based on the possibility of dew playing a role later in the match.""Very excited, the way the last couple of days have gone,"" he said, adding that they are backing all their batters. ""Bumrah is fine, we don't have to worry about him. If he wasn't 100%, he wouldn't be here.""Mumbai Indians' pace attack immediately troubled Sunrisers Hyderabad's usually explosive openers. Despite an early dropped catch off Abhishek Sharma, he managed to find boundaries while Travis Head struggled for timing.The duo added 59 runs before Pandya dismissed Abhishek for a 28-ball 40, a dismissal that came at a cost as Pandya briefly injured his ankle. This injury scare followed Karn Sharma's earlier exit, who injured his bowling hand in the third over and did not return. Will Jacks then removed both Ishan Kishan and the struggling Travis Head, who scored a laborious 28 off 29 balls.Nitish Kumar Reddy's innings faltered, but Heinrich Klaasen 's late surge provided SRH with some much-needed impetus. Klaasen particularly targeted Deepak Chahar, whose initial spell was strong but faltered in his final over. Aniket Verma and Pat Cummins contributed crucial late runs, pushing Sunrisers Hyderabad's total to 162/5 in 20 overs.Interestingly, Sunrisers Hyderabad are the only team yet to register an away win in this year's edition.162/5 in 20 overs (Abhishek Sharma 40, Heinrich Klaasen 37; Will Jacks 2-14, Jasprit Bumrah 1-21)166/6 in 18.1 overs (Will Jacks 36, Ryan Rickelton 31, Rohit Sharma 26; Pat Cummins 3/26)",Mumbai Indians beat Sunrisers Hyderabad by four wickets in IPL T20 match.

Poll Should a warning be given to keepers for having their gloves in front of the stumps? No, it's not necessary Only in certain situations Definitely

Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) spinner Varun Chakravarthy has raised questions over a controversial ""no-ball"" call during the Mumbai Indians vs Sunrisers Hyderabad match at the Wankhede Stadium on Thursday.In the seventh over of the match, Mumbai Indians opener Ryan Rickelton was dismissed by leg-spinner Zeeshan Ansari, with Pat Cummins taking an easy catch at cover.However, the drama unfolded when the fourth umpire stopped Rickelton near the boundary rope, and the delivery was called a no-ball.The third umpire found that wicketkeeper Heinrich Klaasen had his gloves in front of the stumps when the ball made contact with the bat. Rickelton received a free-hit, but he failed to capitalize on it.The third umpire's decision was not appreciated by Varun Chakravarthy.""If the keeper's gloves come in front of the stumps, it should be a dead ball and a warning to the keeper so that he doesn't do that again!!! Not a no-ball and a free hit!! What did the bowler do? Thinking out loud!! What do you all think???"" he wrote on X.However, Rickelton was dismissed in the next over as Harshal Patel deceived him with a slower delivery. He scored 31 off 23 balls.Mumbai Indians defeated Sunrisers Hyderabad by six wickets with eleven balls to spare.Earlier, Sunrisers, who had successfully chased 246 in their previous match against Punjab Kings at home, failed to get going and ended up with a below-par score of 162/5.Sunrisers' next opponent will be Mumbai again on April 23 in Hyderabad.

Mitchell Starc's late heroics, including a crucial yorker and composed final over, forced the Super Over after Rajasthan faltered in their chase of 189.

Here's the updated IPL 2025 points table after the thriller in Delhi:

NEW DELHI: Delhi Capitals climbed back to the top of the Indian Premier League 2025 points table with a thrilling Super Over win against Rajasthan Royals at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Wednesday. This marked DC's fifth win in six matches, taking them to 10 points — two clear of second-placed Gujarat Titans (8 from 6).Meanwhile, the loss deepened RR’s woes, as they languish at eighth with just two wins in seven games.In a high-octane contest, both teams fought tooth and nail, but it was Mitchell Starc ’s late brilliance that swung the match DC’s way. Rajasthan, chasing 189, were off to a flying start with Yashasvi Jaiswal and skipper Sanju Samson adding 61 runs in just 5.3 overs. However, Samson pulled up with a rib injury after smashing a four and a six, retiring hurt in visible pain.Despite the setback, Nitish Rana and Jaiswal kept the Royals in the hunt. But as DC’s spinners tightened the screws, the equation got steeper — 73 required off the last six overs. Starc returned to dismiss the well-set Rana with a peach of a yorker, and with just 9 needed in the final over, the Aussie held his nerve to force a Super Over.Rajasthan managed 11/2 in the Super Over but two quick run-outs derailed their momentum. DC, needing 12, saw KL Rahul and Tristan Stubbs finish the job with two balls to spare, sealing a memorable win and the top spot.Delhi Capitals currently sit atop the IPL 2025 points table after six games, securing five wins and one loss to accumulate 10 points and a net run rate (NRR) of +0.744.Trailing by two points are Gujarat Titans, boasting an impressive +1.081 NRR from four wins in six fixtures (W-W-W-W-L). Third place belongs to Royal Challengers Bengaluru, also on eight points but with a slightly lower NRR of +0.672 after a 4-2 record.Punjab Kings and Lucknow Super Giants share eight points as well, occupying fourth and fifth spots respectively. While Punjab’s NRR stands at +0.172, Lucknow’s is +0.086, reflecting tight contests in their seven matches. Both sides have displayed resilience with alternating wins and losses in recent games.In mid-table, Kolkata Knight Riders have six points (3-4) and a +0.547 NRR, whereas Mumbai Indians, Rajasthan Royals, Sunrisers Hyderabad, and Chennai Super Kings sit in the lower half with four points each. They will be keen to climb the standings as the tournament progresses.Next up, Delhi Capitals face a tough test against Gujarat Titans, while Chennai Super Kings look to bounce back against Mumbai Indians. As the race for playoffs intensifies, every match and NRR will matter.","Delhi Capitals secured a thrilling Super Over victory against Rajasthan Royals.

AXAR'S FIRST WICKET OF IPL 2025

NEW DELHI: In trouble? Call Mitchell Starc . That’s exactly what Axar Patel did when things got tense. With just 9 runs to defend in the final over, he turned to his strike bowler — and Starc delivered.Yorker after yorker, Starc kept the pressure high and the fans on edge. Dhruv Jurel and Shimron Hetmyer managed to survive the heat but couldn’t find the boundaries needed. The match ended in a thrilling tie, pushing the contest into the first Super Over of IPL 2025 .Starc returned for the Super Over, taking the ball once again with ice in his veins. Rajasthan Royals managed just 11 runs, setting Delhi Capitals a target of 12.Enter KL Rahul and Tristan Stubbs , with Sandeep Sharma bowling.Rahul started with a couple, followed it up with a crisp boundary, and handed over the strike after a single. Stubbs needed no second invitation — he launched Sandeep into the stands, sealing a dramatic win for Delhi Capitals.It was their first win at home this season, and it took them right back to the top of the table. As the players celebrated, the ‘Dilli re, Roar Macha!’ anthem echoed through the Kotla — a perfect end to a pulsating night of cricket.Tension was palpable in the Rajasthan Royals dugout. Sanju Samson wore a frustrated look behind the stumps as Sandeep Sharma — one of their most trusted bowlers at the death — lost his rhythm when it mattered the most. Tasked with bowling the final over, Sandeep’s six legal deliveries stretched into a chaotic 11-ball over: Wd 0 Wd Wd Wd N1 4 6 1 1 1 — a rare meltdown from the usually reliable pacer.Delhi Capitals finished their innings at 188/5, and the mood in their camp was upbeat. Smiles lit up their dugout, with players clearly satisfied with what looked like a competitive total.Opener Abishek Porel, who set the tone early with the bat, sounded confident in the mid-innings chat with the broadcasters.""The plan was to go hard in the powerplay which would make it easier later on. If you bowl slower, it is helpful on this wicket and hopefully our bowlers do well. A very good total on this wicket,"" he said.But Rajasthan Royals had other ideas.They came out all guns blazing, dismantling Delhi’s bowling attack from the outset. Yashasvi Jaiswal set the tone with a brisk 51, while Sanju Samson, before retiring hurt on 31, ensured the momentum stayed firmly in Rajasthan’s corner.And then came Nitish Rana, who played a stunning knock of 51 off 28 balls to give a big home but star pacer Starc pulled things back in Delhi's favour.When the match headed into a Super Over, Sandeep found himself in the spotlight once again — a chance at redemption after a forgettable final over.But pressure mounted, and history repeated itself.Sandeep struggled to hold his nerve, failing to apply any real pressure. Delhi Capitals chased down the target in just four deliveries, sealing a memorable win and leaving Sandeep with another tough outing to reflect on.""Bhaiya, plain t-shirt hai ya kissi player ke naam wali jersey?"" — a curious fan asked a t-shirt vendor stationed outside the Arun Jaitley Stadium, just an hour and a half before the Delhi Capitals vs Rajasthan Royals clash.The seller replied, ""Sirf KL Rahul ki hai."" One fan bought it. Then another. Soon, a line of eager customers formed, each asking for different sizes, as the buzz around KL Rahul gripped the scene outside the stadium.Interestingly, the jersey bore the Delhi Capitals colours, but had ""KL Rahul"" and the number 01 printed on the back — a curious sight, yet a clear sign of the mania surrounding the star batter.Inside the Kotla, it was a vibrant sea of blue and red.The atmosphere reached a crescendo when the stadium DJ dropped the ""Dilli re, Roar Macha!"" anthem — and right on cue, KL Rahul cleared his front leg to send a slot ball from Tushar Deshpande soaring over long-off. The crowd erupted.Rahul's knock was entertaining, albeit not blistering. He scored 38 runs off 32 deliveries before falling to Jofra Archer — notably, the first time Archer managed to dismiss Rahul in IPL history.And he showed his composure in the Super Over too, delivering under pressure and giving fans a treat to watch.""We perhaps got too casual in the middle phase,"" admitted Axar Patel after Delhi Capitals’ unbeaten run was halted by Mumbai Indians in their previous outing.Before the clash against Rajasthan Royals, a quick glance at Axar's IPL 2025 stats painted a worrying picture: 67 runs, 0 wickets in 5 matches — far from the impact expected from the captain and star allrounder.Trolled heavily for throwing his wicket away against Mumbai, Axar walked out to a mix of pressure and expectation. But amidst loud chants of ""Bapu!

WHY ARE UMPIRES CHECKING BATS?

WHAT ARE THE RULES ON BAT SIZES?

NEW DELHI: Rajasthan Royals’ Riyan Parag was at the center of a rare interruption during the IPL 2025 match against Delhi Capitals at the Arun Jaitley Stadium, as he was forced to change his bat moments before taking strike.Coming in to bat in place of the injured Sanju Samson, Parag was halted by the on-field umpire for a routine bat gauge check. The bat failed to meet the required specifications, leading to a brief but animated exchange between the batter and the official. Despite his protest, Parag had no option but to change his bat before resuming play.A video capturing the incident has gone viral on social media, showing the exact moment the bat was tested and Parag’s visible displeasure upon learning it didn’t pass.However, the change in equipment didn’t bring a change in fortune. Parag managed just 8 runs from 11 balls before being dismissed.This incident adds to a growing list of players flagged for bat regulation breaches this season. Earlier, KKR's Sunil Narine and Anrich Nortje were also made to replace their bats after similar checks by match officials.According to IPL 2025 regulations, bats must adhere to strict dimensions: a maximum width of 10.79 cm, blade thickness of up to 6.7 cm, edge thickness not exceeding 4 cm, and a total length capped at 96.4 cm.With enforcement tightening, players and franchises are being reminded that compliance with equipment standards is non-negotiable this season.The umpires are checking the bats as part of BCCI protocol which aims to prevent players from gaining unfair advantages in an era of aggressive powerhitting.The BCCI has authorised IPL match officials to inspect any bat they consider necessary during live games, marking a significant change from previous seasons where such checks were confined to dressing rooms.The ICC regulations stipulate specific bat dimensions. The bat face width must not exceed 4.25 inches (10.79 cm), while the middle of the bat thickness is limited to 2.64 inches (6.7 cm). The edge width cannot be more than 1.56 inches (4 cm), and the bat's total height from handle to base must not exceed 38 inches (96.4 cm).","Rajasthan Royals’ Riyan Parag forced to change his bat moments before taking strike.

'I take the blame': Ajinkya Rahane after KKR's defeat to Punjab Kings

NEW DELHI: In a dramatic moment during Kolkata Knight Riders ' (KKR) Indian Premier League 2025 clash against Punjab Kings (PBKS) in Mullanpur, Sunil Narine's bat failed the official gauge test — highlighting the BCCI's recent clampdown on oversized bats during live IPL matches.The incident occurred just before KKR began their unsuccessful chase of PBKS' modest 112-run target.Also See: DC vs RR Reserve umpire Saiyed Khalid conducted random checks outside the playing area, where Narine and fellow KKR batter Angkrish Raghuvanshi stood together. While Raghuvanshi's bat passed the standard test, the thickest part of Narine's bat couldn't slide through the house-shaped gauge, violating ICC's prescribed bat size limits.Despite the bat drama, Narine had a mixed outing — claiming 2 for 14 with the ball but managing just 5 runs with the bat. Raghuvanshi top-scored for KKR with 37 off 28, yet the team crumbled from 62 for 2 to 95 all out.A second bat-related interruption came in the 16th over when Anrich Nortje was stopped by on-field umpires Mohit Krishnadas and Saidharshan Kumar. Nortje's bat also failed the gauge test, prompting substitute Rahmanullah Gurbaz to rush in with a replacement. However, the match ended before he could face a ball, as Andre Russell was dismissed immediately.These live checks mark a shift in BCCI protocol, with bat dimensions now scrutinised mid-match to prevent players from gaining illegal advantages through oversized blades. While previously done in dressing rooms, this season has seen on-field checks involving several players, including Shimron Hetmyer, Phil Salt, and Hardik Pandya.The ICC allows a maximum bat face width of 10.79 cm, blade thickness of 6.7 cm, edge width of 4 cm, and overall length of 96.4 cm.","Kolkata Knight Riders' Sunil Narine's bat failed the official gauge test.

'I was under pressure': SRH's Abhishek Sharma after a record 141 against Punjab Kings

MUMBAI: This match, irrespective of which team wins, should be a treat for Mumbai’s fans. Abhishek Sharma is back at the Wankhede, the venue where he smashed that fabulous 54-ball 135 against a stunned England at the Wankhede Stadium in early Feb this year.What’s more, he is fresh off an equally murderous 55-ball 141 which helped the Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) chase down Punjab Kings’ 246 with ease in Uppal. Needless to say, hosts Mumbai Indians (MI) have a massive challenge on their hands when they face SRH on Thursday night.Perhaps burdened by the weight of huge expectations since that scintillating century against England, the 24-year-old was groping for runs at the start of the IPL, getting out for scores of 24, 6, 1, 2, and 18. Then he exploded against PBKS to register the highest-ever individual score by an Indian batter in the IPL.MI will look to control the damage from Abhishek and his equally destructive opening partner Travis Head by unleashing their ace seam bowling duo, Jasprit Bumrah and Trent Boult. Both Abhishek and Head like to pounce on the new ball, but attacking Boult, who has a habit of striking in the Powerplays, and Bumrah, won’t be straight forward.Abhishek, Head and South African ’keeper bat Heinrich Klaasen form the engine room of the SRH batting lineup. But MI will also have to deal with an insider. Ishan Kishan , who was an integral part of the franchise since 2018, and was let go by MI, will be having a point to prove. And he knows the Wankhede inside out.Ishan had a stunning debut for SRH, smashing a blazing 106 not out off just 47 balls against Rajasthan Royals, but since then his form has dipped. Conversely, MI have someone in their lineup who was on the SRH rolls once: Karn Sharma Playing his first match of the season, the experienced leggie took 3/36, including the crucial wickets of the in-form KL Rahul and Tristian Stubbs, to help Mumbai pull off a heist against DC in the last match. If Karn and Kiwi left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner, whose brilliant delivery castled a well-set Karun Nair and changed the course of the last match, combine well again, MI will be difficult to beat.Two SRH bowlers who will be marked men will be Uttar Pradesh’s impressive young leg-spinner Zeshan Ansari, who has taken four wickets in four matches at 35.25 (ER 9.40), and Sri Lankan seamer Eshan Malinga. Taking 2/45 on his debut in four overs in a high-scoring match, Eshan managed to impress Lasith Malinga.The Sri Lankan fastbowling great posted on X after watching him: “Well bowled, Malinga!” MI will no doubt be rejuvenated after their comefrom-behind win against the Delhi Capitals in their last match on Sunday.","Abhishek Sharma is back at the Wankhede, the venue where he smashed that fabulous 54-ball 135 against a stunned England in early Feb this year.

Rajat Patidar-led Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) will lock horns against Shreyas Iyer's Punjab Kings (PBKS) in Match No. 34 of the Indian Premier League (IPL) at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru on Friday. RCB are currently placed at the third position, whereas Punjab are at fourth.As a team, Punjab will be high on confidence after their 16-run win over KKR in a recent low-scoring thriller. But they will be well aware that RCB, which has depth in batting and bowling, will be a harder opponent to overcome.Two former RCB players, Yuzvendra Chahal and Glenn Maxwell, will have noticed Bengaluru batters' struggle against slow bowlers R Sai Kishore, Kuldeep Yadav, and Vipraj Nigam in Bengaluru. RCB mentor Dinesh Karthik mentioned after their loss against Delhi Capitals that the Chinnaswamy pitch was surprisingly on the slower side, and both Chahal and Maxwell will be eager to exploit that.Chahal, fresh from his four-wicket haul against Kolkata Knight Riders, is a master of lengths rather than of ""magic balls."" The leg-spinner lures with offerings wide of off-stump, and the batters need to reach out to the ball for big hits, often resulting in catches in the deep.After RCB's consecutive losses, Dinesh Karthik hinted that the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium pitch has not delivered what the team management desires. “In the first two games, we have asked for good pitches. But it’s turned out in this way where it’s been challenging to bat on for sure. So we try and do the best with whatever we get,"" Karthik had said. “This is not a pitch that’s helping the batters too much. It’s a challenging pitch. That has been the case in both the games that we have played."" The Chinnaswamy Stadium pitch has historically been a batter's paradise, but in this year's IPL, it has been a bit tricky. When asked if the RCB team management will follow up with the curator, Karthik replied, “We will obviously have a chat with him, and we trust him to do his job.”Phil Salt, Virat Kohli, Devdutt Padikkal, Rajat Patidar (c), Liam Livingstone, Jitesh Sharma (wk), Tim David, Krunal Pandya, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Josh Hazlewood, Yash DayalSuyash SharmaPriyansh Arya, Prabhsimran Singh, Shreyas Iyer (c), Josh Inglis (wk), Nehal Wadhera, Glenn Maxwell, Shashank Singh, Marco Jansen, Xavier Bartlett, Arshdeep Singh, Yuzvendra ChahalYash Thakur331617The forecast for Friday indicates that the sky will be mostly clear.

NEW DELHI: The Indian Premier League (IPL) has witnessed a significant development this season with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) lifting the ban on using saliva as a ball-polishing agent.This decision was made after several captains expressed their support for the move, as it was previously prohibited during the COVID-19 pandemic as a precautionary measure.The reintroduction of saliva as a ball-polishing agent has reignited discussions around the art of reverse swing , a skill that has been largely forgotten in recent times.However, Bhuvneshwar Kumar , the fast bowler for Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB), has offered a different perspective on the matter.In a candid admission, Bhuvneshwar revealed that he had forgotten about the revised rules allowing the use of saliva until the team staff reminded him.""I forgot that I can use saliva. Yesterday when the (team) staff told me, I didn't know that I have to use it,"" he said. ""I am not sure if it will help or not, but now that I remember, definitely in tomorrow's match (vs PBKS), I will put some saliva and see if it helps or not.""While Bhuvneshwar remains uncertain about the potential benefits of using saliva, he acknowledged the importance of exploring its impact on the ball's behaviour.On the other hand, some of Bhuvneshwar's contemporaries have eagerly embraced the opportunity to revive the art of reverse swing. Mitchell Starc , the fast bowler for Delhi Capitals , showcased a glimpse of reverse swing during their match against Rajasthan Royals on Wednesday.His remarkable accuracy and the touch of reverse swing played a crucial role in Delhi Capitals' victory in the Super Over.Nitish Rana, a Rajasthan Royals player, acknowledged Starc's exceptional skill, stating that executing 11 yorkers out of 12 balls at a pace of 145 kmph while generating reverse swing deserves immense credit.""Reverse swing had completely gone away from cricket, whether it was red ball or white ball. Suddenly, if someone can execute 11 yorkers in 12 balls at a 145 (kmph) pace, then you have to give Starc the credit,"" Nitish added.Delhi's captain, Axar Patel, also praised Starc's ability to execute his plans under pressure, saying, ""Getting reverse swing is one thing, but executing it is very important. It was reversing, but at that time, under pressure, he (Starc) was executing it. I was just reminding him to be clear about the plans we made in the bowlers meeting. I was getting the same response: 'Don't worry, skip. I'll do it.'""",IPL has witnessed a significant development this season with the ban on using saliva as a ball-polishing agent lifted.
