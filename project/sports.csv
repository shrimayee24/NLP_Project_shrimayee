The Origin Of The Dispute

Muslim Chronicles on Ayodhya

Excerpt - The Ayodhya Temple-Mosque Dispute: Focus on Muslim Sources

""Babur got the mosque built after demolishing the Janmasthan and used in his mosque the stone of the same Janmasthan, which was richly engraved, precious kasauti stone, and which survives even today.""

""…a glorious mosque was built up during King Babar’s regime on the spot where Sita ki Rasoi tomb (?) is situated in Awadh.

During this Babari (dispensation) the Hindus had no guts to be a match for the Muslims.

“…all the temples of Ayodhya were turned into mosques by the Sultans of the past.”

European Account on Janmabhoomi

""Emperor Aurenzgebe got the fortress called Ramcot demolished and got a Muslim temple, with triple domes, constructed at the same place.

Others say that it was constructed by ‘Babor'...""

Account of Joseph Tieffenthaler

""However, there still exists some superstitious cult in some place or other. For example, in the place where the native house of Ram existed, they go around 3 times and prostrate on the floor. The two spots are surrounded by a low wall constructed with battlements. One enters the front hall through a low semi-circular door… On the 24th of the Tschet month, a big gathering of people is done here to celebrate the birthday of Ram, so famous in the entire India.""

Awadh was aghast. The city collapsed like a lamp about to lose its flame. Men, women and children followed him as though Ayodhya itself was walking away. They did not see a prince going to the forest, it was like something being forcefully torn away with the strings of hope that he might stay hanging loose. The moment he stepped away, the capital of the Kosala kingdom felt emptied of life. This is how Maharishi Valmiki portrays Ram’s departure for his 14-yearin Treta Yuga.The grief that filled Ayodhya in Valmiki’s verses did not stop at the edge of the forest. It travelled through centuries. It lived through kingdoms, invasions and courtrooms. It became devotion and politics. It became movements and marches. The 500-year-long Ram Janmabhoomi struggle was never just about land. It was about bringing Ram back. This time in Kaliyuga.Generations came and went, but the question survived: When will Ram Lalla return?He did return. On January 22, 2024, when the consecration ceremony of the deity was held. What was once a memory in scriptures and prayers finally took form in stone and light. The temple that had lived in longing now stands as faith fulfilled, and a civilisation reclaimed what it never stopped believing was its own.November 25, 2025, marked the final milestone with the completion of the temple and a “Dhwajarohan” event, attended by PM Narendra Modi , RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat and UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath.Addressing a gathering after the flag hoisting event on November 25, the Prime Minister stated that today the city of Ayodhya is witnessing yet another pinnacle of India's cultural consciousness.""This Dharma Dhwaja is not merely a flag, but the flag of the renaissance of Indian civilisation,"" he said, explaining that its saffron colour, the glory of the Solar dynasty inscribed upon it, the sacred Om depicted, and the engraved Kovidar tree symbolise the greatness of Ram Rajya.The story that had begun 500 years ago with the desecration under Mughal invader Babur slowly entered courtrooms, legal arguments and the political landscape. Each petition was an echo of a civilisational longing. Every verdict and every stay order became footsteps in a centuries-long journey.Ayodhya did not forget. Neither did the people who came on foot from distant villages, nor the saints who guarded the belief like a flame, waiting for the Ram Lalla's temple to rise again.The struggle took different shapes over the centuries. Mahant Raghubir Das and others filed suits not for power or land, but for the right to worship. The movement was still quiet then, but the silence was deceptive. The devotion was gathering strength!The story did not begin with courts or politics. It began in the sixteenth century when the temple at Ram Janmabhoomi was torn down, and a mosque was constructed under Babur’s general, Mir Baqi.The temple was demolished, but the faith was not. Hindus continued to worship at the site. The belief that this was Ram’s birthplace never broke. It lived through devotion, pilgrimage and collective memory.Several works in Arabic, Persian, and Urdu discussed the demolition of the Ramjanmabhumi temple and its replacement by Babri Masjid.In the book ""The Ayodhya Temple-Mosque Dispute: Focus on Muslim Sources"" by Harsh Narain, there's a mention of Al-Hind-u fi al- ‘Ahd al-Islami (India in the Islamic Era) by Maulana Hakim Sayyid Abd al-Hayy, which was translated into Urdu by Maulana Shams Tabriz Khan, under the title Hindustan Islami Ahd mein.In Tarikh-i Awadh (1919), written by Muhammad Najmul Ghani, it is stated:The Fasanah-I Ibrat, written by Rajab Ali Beg Surur in 1860, but first published in 1884, stated:Harsh Narain's work states that the Qaysar-u’t Tawarikh, which is an Urdu historical chronicle that describes the Janmabhoomi demolition and mosque construction, located the mosque in Sita ki Rasoi as well as the Janmasthan. It acknowledged,In one of the multiple accounts of foreign travellers, Joseph Tieffenthaler, the Austrian Jesuit, who stayed in India from 1743 till his death some four decades later, toured Awadh between 1766 and 1771.According to Meenakshi Jain's The Battle For Rama work, he was the first to refer to the destruction of a temple at Rama’s birthplace by a Mughal ruler. He saw Hindus worshipping a religious structure in the form of a vedi (cradle) in the premises, but said nothing about Muslims offering namaaz.He also noted the large gatherings of Hindus on the occasion of Rama Navami (Rama’s birthday). He wrote:Tieffenthaler also provided the earliest European documentation of the Hindu Janmasthan platform, which was later called “Ram Chabutra"".He futher writes:As dynasties and empires changed, the sacredness of the Janmabhoomi did not fade. The temple had fallen, but the birthplace was not forgotten. Devotion shifted to the Ram Chabutra in the outer courtyard, where pilgrims prayed, and saints kept vigil. Akharas, fairs and local traditions kept the belief alive.When the British arrived in the mid-1850s, they did not end the conflict. They fenced the site into two courtyards. Muslims offered namaz inside, while Hindus worshipped at the Ram Chabutra outside. The land had one history but two claims.In 1885, Mahant Raghubar Das filed the first suit to build a temple, but it was rejected. However, the worship continued.In 1934, clashes damaged the mosque, and the British repaired it, still avoiding the core question. The dispute remained unresolved and alive.Independence did not settle Ayodhya. In December 1949, idols of Ram Lalla were found inside the disputed structure. Authorities sealed it and declared the site disputed. The idol stayed inside, and worship continued from outside, while namaz stopped.In 1950, Gopal Singh Visharad and Paramhans Ramchandra Das filed suits seeking worship inside. More cases followed: Nirmohi Akhara in 1959 claimed management rights, and the Sunni Waqf Board in 1961 contested the property. The courts froze the status quo. The fight moved from streets to case files, petitions and orders.By the 1980s, the dispute had moved beyond the courtroom. The VHP adopted the Ram Janmabhoomi cause, and the RSS gave the campaign nationwide strength. The turning point came in 1986 when the Faizabad court ordered the gates of the structure to be opened, and the government allowed it.Within hours, darshan began, and Hindus entered after decades. Namaz did not resume. A locked shrine became an open site of worship, and the dispute that had waited behind iron bars stepped into public life.The opening of the gates in 1986 changed more than access to the temple. It changed the direction of Indian politics and public sentiment. For decades the issue had been faith and legal argument. Now it became a movement that spread into homes, streets and television screens.The telecast of Ramanand Sagar’sin 1987–88 turned the story of Ram into a national cultural moment. Families paused their Sundays to watch it. Streets emptied. Temples saw new crowds. Faith acquired momentum, and the Ram Janmabhoomi question began entering everyday life.In 1989, the VHP laid the foundation stone (shilanyas) near the disputed site with the approval of the Rajiv Gandhi government, and the issue moved further into national consciousness.The same year, the BJP officially adopted the Ram Mandir demand through the Palampur Resolution. A religious and cultural movement had now gained a clear political face.In 1990, LK Advani launched the Rath Yatra from Somnath to Ayodhya, mobilising lakhs of supporters across the country.The yatra provoked a counter-mobilisation and heightened tensions. When Kar Sevaks attempted to move towards the disputed site, the Uttar Pradesh government under Mulayam Singh Yadav ordered police firing. Several kar sevaks were killed. The movement intensified further.From late November 1992, lakhs of kar sevaks had gathered in Ayodhya under multiple Hindu organisations. The call for kar seva had built expectations thatwould happen on the ground. The events reached a climax on 6 December 1992. Crowds demolished the disputed structure, which opened a new chapter of religious, political and legal conflict.After the incident, the court cases multiplied. Commissions were formed. What began as a locked shrine had turned into one of the defining movements of modern India.After the 1992 demolition, the dispute shifted permanently into the courts. The central government acquired the site in 1993 and asked the Supreme Court to settle ownership. The title suits were transferred to the Allahabad high court, which examined archaeological, historical and documentary evidence.The 2003 ASI excavation report remains consistent with a large pre-existing structure below the demolished mosque.In 2010, the high court ruled that the land be divided among three parties, but the judgment was appealed by all sides.The case then moved to the Supreme Court, where a Constitution Bench heard extensive arguments on law, title, belief and history.In November 2019, the top court delivered its final judgment: The land was awarded for the construction of a Ram temple, and an alternative site was directed to be allotted to the Muslim side. The verdict ended the centuries-long legal battle and settled ownership of the Janmabhoomi.After the Supreme Court’s 2019 verdict awarding the disputed land for the construction of a Ram temple, plans for building began in earnest.A trust was formed to oversee development, and construction work proceeded over the next few years with architectural planning, sanctum layout, and preparations for consecration. On 22 January 2024, the new temple was inaugurated with religious ceremonies.On November 25, the ""Dwajarohan"" ceremony, hoisting the saffron flag atop the temple, reaffirmed the Mandir’s consecration and the restoration of the wounded civilisation.The long-standing legal and historical dispute thus entered a phase of physical reconstruction and symbolic closure, as devotees welcomed the final restoration of what they regard as their heritage.If one scrolls through the Ram Mandir movement wire-to-wire, the demand for the temple emerges not just as a caravan of facts and emotions, but as a testament to a faith that never faded.Those in the frontline of the movement, especially the Hindu community, continued their worship at the site, whether in the outer courtyard earlier or before the idol after 1949, sustaining an unbroken thread of devotion, which helped in healing and rekindling the oldest civilisation.","PM Modi Unveils World’s Tallest Bronze Statue Of Lord Ram In South Goa. The 500-year Ram Janmabhoomi struggle was never just about land. It was about the question: When will Ram Lalla return? On January 22, 2024, when the consecration ceremony was held, the deity was finally brought back.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125655274,imgsize-155544,width-400,resizemode-4/qq.jpg"

Mamata Banerjee Warns BJP With Nation-Shaking Threat As SIR Battle Erupts In Bengal Ahead Of Polls

(With ANI inputs)

NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has set up a national coordination team to monitor the ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls and flag any “discrepancies,” along with issues faced by Booth Level Officers (BLOs) across the country.The seven-member committee will be headed by BJP national general secretary Tarun Chugh. Its other members include Dr K Laxman, K Annamalai, Om Prakash Dhankhar, Alka Gurjar, Dr Anirban Ganguly and Jamyang Tsering Namgyal.The panel has already begun field visits.

The review in the Union territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands has already been completed.The Election Commission recently announced “phase 2” of the SIR across nine states and three Union Territories. The exercise has seen reports of BLO deaths and resignations, attributed in some cases to work pressure. Phase 2 — the first was in Bihar ahead of the state's recently-conducted assembly polls — began on November 4 and will culminate with the final voter list publication on February 7, 2026.According to the Election Commission, 99.43 per cent of enumeration forms had been distributed by November 28, covering more than 50 crore electors. A total of 5,32,828 BLOs are handling the on-ground distribution and collection of these forms across the 12 states and UTs, supported by 11,40,598 BLAs. Uttar Pradesh has seen the highest volume of distribution, with 15,39,93,688 forms handed out.So far, 74.1 per cent of forms have been digitised. Lakshadweep has completed digitisation of all its 57,813 forms, while Uttar Pradesh currently trails with 54.97 per cent digitised — 8,48,82,670 forms.","The seven-member committee will be headed by BJP national general secretary Tarun Chugh.

Bo Bichette’s injuries spark big concern as MLB analysts explain Blue Jays’ slow approach

Bo Bichette is in the news again as MLB analysts wonder why the Toronto Blue Jays have still not re-signed him. The questions grew louder this week when the team signed starting pitcher Dylan Cease to a seven-year, two hundred and ten million dollar deal. Many fans thought the team would sign Bo Bichette first because he is one of their top players. Instead, the Blue Jays chose to move fast with Dylan Cease, and that raised doubts.On Thursday, Jeff O’Neill, Bryan Hayes and Dave Feschuk spoke about this on TSN’s “Overdrive” show from Toronto. They said the delay with Bo Bichette may show that the team has concerns. They also said there could be “red flags” that the Blue Jays are thinking about before offering a long contract.Bryan Hayes said the Toronto Blue Jays may still be trying to understand Bo Bichette’s true market value. He explained that the team did not need to study Dylan Cease’s price because many teams were already ready to offer him big money.But with Bo Bichette, he said the team may be unsure about the right number. He added that Bo Bichette may also believe he should get top pay, but that does not always match what a team wants to spend.Dave Feschuk then spoke about Bo Bichette’s injury issues. He said these injuries cannot be ignored.He explained that Bo Bichette was not healthy for most of the playoffs last year. He also said that the shortstop missed a large part of the 2024 season when the Blue Jays finished last in the American League East. Dave Feschuk said these things matter because teams think carefully before giving a long contract that covers many years.Bo Bichette missed eighty-one games in the 2024 season. His injuries included right knee tendonitis, a right quad strain and a right calf strain. He missed the final month of the regular season while he was leading MLB in hits. He returned only for the World Series.Dave Feschuk also said teams may be more careful with money because the next Collective Bargaining Agreement talks will happen after the 2026 season.He said some teams believe a salary cap could arrive, so they do not want to spend too much before the MLB rules change. Bo Bichette has been a career point two nine four hitter with one hundred eleven home runs and four hundred thirty-seven RBIs. His hitting numbers remain strong, but teams must decide how his injuries will affect his future deals.Also Read: San Francisco Giants Jump Ahead Of $8.2B New York Yankees In Rising Race For Tatsuya Imai","The Toronto Blue Jays signed starting pitcher Dylan Cease to a seven-year, two hundred and ten million dollar deal.

Inside India nets in Ranchi: How Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma prepared for first ODI vs South Africa

The BCCI shared a new video on Saturday from Team India’s training session at the JSCA Stadium in Ranchi, giving fans a glimpse of senior stars Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma gearing up for their return to ODI cricket. The three-match series against South Africa begins on 30 November, and the experienced pair will be seen again in blue after stepping away from T20Is and Test cricket. They now feature only in the one-day format at international level.In the clip posted online, a light-hearted moment involving Rishabh Pant and Kohli has caught the attention of fans. Pant was keeping during the nets when the pacer delivered a good-length ball to Kohli. The former captain danced down the track and produced a cleanly struck pull shot that left Pant impressed. Reacting instantly, Pant said from behind the stumps, “Bhai ji, acha ball tha yeh. Tagda maar diya,” praising both the delivery and Kohli’s effortless timing.Rohit and Kohli last played an ODI together during the tour of Australia in October. In that game, Rohit produced an unbeaten match-winning 121, while Kohli supported him with a fluent 74 not out. Their 168-run partnership set the tone for India’s win.As the Ranchi opener approaches, both batters stand on the brink of major milestones. Rohit, who currently sits at the top of the ODI batting rankings, is closing in on the 20,000-run mark in international cricket. He has amassed 19,902 runs across 502 matches, including 4,301 in Tests, 4,231 in T20Is, and 11,370 in ODIs. The Indian captain needs only 98 more to become the fourth Indian to enter the elite 20,000-run club after Sachin Tendulkar , Virat Kohli and Rahul Dravid .Kohli is on the verge of creating history as well. One more hundred will move him past Tendulkar for the most centuries by a batter in a single international format. Both legends are currently tied with 51 tons each, with Tendulkar’s tally coming in Tests. Kohli’s next century will make him the first to reach 52 in one format. Only these two greats have managed to score 50 or more hundreds in any single format of the game.",Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma are gearing up for their return to ODI cricket.

Travis Kelce sent a resounding message on Browns rookie Shedeur Sanders



Cleveland finally felt a long awaited spark when Shedeur Sanders stepped onto the field for his first NFL start. The Browns needed someone to steady an offense that had been stuck for most of the season, and Sanders delivered a performance that shifted the mood in the city. His debut not only brought a win but also caught the attention of two of Cleveland’s most accomplished sons, Jason and Travis Kelce . Their excitement set the tone for a conversation that echoed across the league.Travis Kelce did not hide how thrilled he was. He sent a strong message to Sanders on the latest episode of New Heights, praising the rookie with all the energy fans expect from him. “Talk your sh**, Shedeur, let’s f**ing go. My dog goes in, gets his first start, gets his first dub. Let’s f*cking go, man. The 45th starting QB for the Browns since 1994. First Browns QB to win in his first official start since 1995. Cleveland’s been waiting for this. We’ve been waiting for this,” Travis said.For Travis, this moment carried extra meaning. He grew up in Cleveland, starred at the University of Cincinnati and has always kept a place in his heart for the Browns. Seeing Sanders command the offense and lead a 24 to 10 victory over the Raiders reminded him of what the city has been longing for. Jason Kelce agreed, saying Sanders brought something that had been missing. “In one game, Shedeur showed them more than they had seen, really, in any of the games with Gabriel,” he said.Jason noted that Sanders was not perfect, but his poise and timely throws stood out.Sanders went 11 for 20 for 209 yards with one touchdown and one interception. His best throw came on a play where Las Vegas brought heavy pressure. Instead of folding, he rolled right and sent a 52 yard strike to Isaiah Bond. His touchdown came later when rookie Dylan Sampson turned a screen into a 66 yard score. It was the type of play Cleveland had been desperate to see.A week earlier, Sanders struggled in relief duty. He entered cold and completed only four passes against Baltimore. This time he had preparation, rhythm and confidence. Now he faces a much tougher test when the Browns meet the 49ers. With the Kelce brothers and the city behind him, Sanders steps into Week 13 with belief and momentum on his side.Also Read: Meet Taylor Burr, the Chiefs’ breakout sideline personality who’s living her dream and charming viewers nationwide",Shedeur Sanders made his debut for the Browns against the Raiders.

'Get Off Your Phone': Travis Kelce’s Past With Kayla Nicole Resurfaces Amid Taylor Swift Lyric Storm

Kayla Nicole explains ‘over-sexualized comments’ on the On Tap with Harry Jowsey podcast



Kayla Nicole is back in the spotlight, and fans of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are not happy at all. Kayla, who dated Travis Kelce until 2022, spoke on the “On Tap with Harry Jowsey” podcast and made a comment that upset many people. She said she does not want to date any more athletes, but then she added that she would date team owners. The internet quickly jumped on this line, and many fans said she is “never beating those gold digger allegations.” This one comment spread fast and started a huge fight online.Right after the podcast clip came out, fans on X began reacting. Some Swift fans said Kayla Nicole was again throwing “small shots” at Travis Kelce. Others said her comment sounded rude toward all athletes. A few people joked that Kayla has only dated one athlete, so saying she will never date one again did not make much sense. That made people laugh even more and turned the whole thing into a trending moment.Another fan dragged Taylor Swift’s ex-boyfriend Joe Alwyn into the talk. They joked that Joe also loved Taylor’s lifestyle and “connections.” Many people online wrote that Kayla Nicole should stop bringing up anything that looks like a jab at Travis Kelce.One person said, “I don’t see anyone lining up.” Another fan said they will always defend Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce “any day” from Kayla’s comments. Someone else joked that Kayla is entering her “villain arc. ”Some fans also reminded others that Travis Kelce did not cheat on Kayla with Taylor Swift. They said the breakup happened long before Taylor Swift came into the picture, so these new comments feel unnecessary. People even mentioned her Halloween video where she used a Toni Braxton song, saying she should just “move on.”During the same talk with Harry Jowsey, Kayla Nicole also opened up about people calling her “too sexual.” She said this happens even when she wears simple clothes like a swimsuit. She explained that she is not trying to make “thirst trap” photos. She said she is simply at the beach or pool, and people turn it into something else.Kayla Nicole said she has dealt with this problem for “years and years.” She told Harry that she cannot control how others see her and that it is “not my fault” if people feel attracted to her. Her comments kept the online talk going, and fans continued reacting long after the podcast clip went viral.Also Read: “Tayvis Thanksgiving Is Like”: Perez Hilton Reacts As Taylor Swift And Travis Kelce’s Viral Steakhouse Photo With Chiefs Fans Sparks New Buzz","Kayla Nicole spoke on the “On Tap with Harry Jowsey” podcast and made a comment that upset many people.

Pros, Cons, and Overall Winner

Talk around the league has escalated as theare increasingly positioned as a potential landing spot for Milwaukee Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo . With the franchise eyeing a future built around Luka Dončić , the possibility of pairing him with another generational MVP has created a wave of speculation across NBA circles.This momentum is driven by recent indications that the Lakers are exploring aggressive paths to remain contenders beyond the LeBron James era. Reports suggest they are more willing than ever to make short-term sacrifices if it means strengthening their core around Dončić, who continues to perform at an MVP level.Among the most detailed proposals is a five-team structure that envisions the Lakers acquiring Giannis along with Olivier-Maxence Prosper from Dallas and Tyrese Martin from Brooklyn. In this scenario, LeBron James heads to Dallas, Brooklyn gains Dalton Knecht, and Los Angeles sends Milwaukee a haul of wings - RJ Barrett, PJ Washington, Caleb Martin, and Naji Marshall - along with extensive draft control.The Bucks’ return would include swap rights in 2026, 2028, 2030, and 2032, plus a 2031 first-round pick. Meanwhile, the Raptors and Nets secure young pieces and trade exceptions to reshape their flexibility.Alternate proposals maintain the same intention but reduce the complexity. One such idea involves the Lakers sending LeBron, Austin Reaves, and two first-rounders directly to Milwaukee in exchange for Giannis and Kyle Kuzma. These frameworks prioritize Milwaukee’s need for draft capital and young talent rather than retaining an aging LeBron.For the Lakers, landing a 30-year-old superstar in his prime alongside a 26-year-old Dončić offers a pathway to multiple championship runs. Their recent head-to-head battles - highlighted by Dončić’s 41-point performance in a dominant win - underscore the potential of their combined offensive strength.Milwaukee, on the other hand, would gain assets to address the team’s drop-off when Giannis is off the floor. Their pursuit of additional scorers such as Zach LaVine and Anfernee Simons shows a desire to rebalance the roster, and a major trade could accelerate a full-scale retool.Dallas would reload instantly with LeBron’s leadership beside rising talent. Brooklyn and Toronto would walk away with young guards like Knecht and Hardy, plus valuable exceptions.The Lakers benefit from a potential dynasty-forming duo capable of combining for over 65 points per game while boosting the league’s global appeal. The Bucks secure valuable rebuilding tools but risk alienating fans by moving their franchise icon. The complexity of multi-team negotiations and Knicks-related timing issues remain hurdles.Also read: NBA trade rumors: Golden State Warriors could chase $54.2 million Dallas Mavericks superstar in blockbuster 3-team trade to fix center depth If such a scenario were to play out, the Lakers emerge with the clearest long-term upside, while Milwaukee transitions into a new era fueled by assets and flexibility.","The Los Angeles Lakers are increasingly positioned as a potential landing spot for Milwaukee Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo.

Perez Hilton defends Meghan Markle in new “Green Gown-gate” talk

Meghan Markle and Prince Harry join Thanksgiving service event





Pop culture podcaster Perez Hilton has reacted to a new rumor about Meghan Markle and a green gown. This rumor started again after the trailer for Meghan Markle’s upcoming Netflix holiday special came out. In the trailer, Meghan is seen wearing a green dress. Soon, many people online began to say that this dress looked like the same $1,695 gown she wore for a Variety 2022 photoshoot. Some people online claimed she took the dress home “without asking.”These new talks grew bigger after Page Six posted a report on November 24. The outlet wrote that one source claimed Meghan “took the emerald green gown from the shoot without permission.” Another source told Page Six that Meghan was “required to archive all her looks” because of royal rules. But Page Six also added that a different source said there was no such royal rule.The rumor became huge on social media, and many people began to argue about Meghan again. So, Perez Hilton decided to speak about it. He wrote about it in his November 26 blog, saying the scandal was now called “Green Gown-gate.” He also spoke about an interview with journalist Vanessa Grigoriadis, who said the Sussexes took “a lot of stuff” after a past photoshoot.Perez Hilton reacted strongly to the dress rumor. He said the whole story sounded silly and wrote:“This sounds like a bunch of nonsense. We really doubt Meghan would steal a dress, and then wear it for her Netflix show!”Perez Hilton also said that many stars take home outfits after shoots and that Meghan Markle likely had an agreement with the designer. He added that this happens “all the time” in Hollywood. Soon after, Meghan Markle’s representative spoke to E! News and denied all the claims. The rep said:“The idea that anything was taken without the full knowledge or agreement of the stylists or their teams is false and highly defamatory. Anything kept was done with transparency and followed all contracts.”Prince Harry and Meghan Markle also made news for a good reason this week. On November 26, they spent Thanksgiving week helping the group Our Big Kitchen Los Angeles through their charity, the Archewell Foundation. The couple cooked and packed meals with their children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet.In a press release, the Archewell team said they wanted to support people who are struggling with food insecurity during the holiday season.Meghan Markle also shared a warm Thanksgiving note in her As Ever brand newsletter, thanking her family and wishing everyone a happy holiday.

What Hailey Sikman and Jade Dickens said about Jammie Booker at the Texas event



Jammie Booker, 28, lost her World’s Strongest Woman title after officials said she is a biological male and also after explicit photos spread during the event. This happened at the 2025 contest in Arlington, Texas, last weekend. On Tuesday, the Official Strongman Games said they removed her win because they only allow people to compete in the category of the sex marked at birth. This pushed Andrea Thompson , 43, from Great Britain, into first place.Rivals told the Daily Mail and Fox News Digital that they only learned about Booker’s gender after the event. They said the photos and videos were sent to them later. One photo showed Booker grabbing her chest and sticking out her tongue. The Daily Mail also said competitors shared adult pictures and videos that seemed to show Booker had worked in porn. Because of this, the event became a huge controversy.Strongwomen Hailey Sikman and Jade Dickens said they felt “conned” because they did not know anything about Jammie Booker’s gender before the contest ended. Jade Dickens told Fox News Digital that she was “beyond mad.” She said, “Nobody knew he was a man.”She also said Booker was quiet, and she believed Booker’s voice might have revealed the truth.Hailey Sikman said she tried to talk to Booker during the event, but Booker did not respond. Sikman said many women felt Jammie Booker was “arrogant” and “talking s***.” They believed she kept a distance from other athletes.On Tuesday, the Official Strongman Games shared a strong statement.

Their report said Booker looks like a porn performer named Jammie Jay, and Booker also uses the TikTok name @jammiejaysvids.

How will Marcus Foligno’s injury affect Minnesota’s Wild lineup?

Marcus Foligno (#17) All 23 Goals of the 2021-22 NHL Season

The veteran winger Marcus Foligno has been placed on injured reserve by the Minnesota Wild effective November 26, after he picked up a lower-body injury in the course of the game against the Chicago Blackhawks, which went into overtime on Wednesday night. Foligno was involved in a collision with Oliver Moore and had to leave the match late in the second period, and the Wild has since called up Nicolas Aubé-Kubel from their AHL affiliate in Iowa to take his place on the roster. Minnesota is currently without five forwards, including Ryan Hartman, Vinnie Hinostroza, Marco Rossi, and Vladimir Tarasenko, while they have approximately $3.43 million in cap space.Foligno will be out for the next three games at least and can only return as early as December 4 against the Calgary Flames. This winger, who is 34 years old, has not been very productive offensively in recent times, getting only two assists in 23 games, and his average ice time of 13:07 is the lowest in the last seven years. Nevertheless, he still plays a vital defensive role, and numbers like expected goals against per 60 minutes (2.63) and scoring chances against per 60 (28.29) show that he is worth having in his own zone.The Wild have to deal with the problem of performing up to standard while the crucial forwards are out of the lineup.The head coach, John Hynes, has not given any specific time frame for Marcus Foligno’s full recovery, so Minnesota has to cope with using its depth players, together with recalled Aubé-Kubel, to keep its lineup alive.Foligno's IR placement is very timely as the team is poised to extend its winning streak to six and fortify its Central Division position. The Wild will have to make extensive ice time adjustments, change line combinations, and rethink deployment strategies to remain competitive during his absence.Foligno's injury puts additional strain on the Minnesota forwards; however, good roster management and the help from the fit players are going to be the key factors in getting through the upcoming fixtures.Also Read: NHL Updates: Montreal Canadiens re-sign defenseman Mike Matheson to a long-term extension","Marcus Foligno has been placed on injured reserve by the Minnesota Wild.

Tip-off is set for 7:30 PM ET, and for the first time in a while, Charlotte’s star point guard walks into a matchup without an injury tag shadowing him. His clean bill of health is reassuring for a fanbase that has watched him battle ankle concerns all season.Charlotte is desperate for stability, especially with their record slipping further below .500. Having Ball at the helm offers something this team has lacked in recent weeks: direction. And considering the Bulls are arriving with a battered roster and numerous rotational uncertainties, the Hornets know this is a prime opportunity to regain momentum. With Black Friday bringing a national spotlight to the tournament slate, the timing couldn’t be better.LaMelo Ball enters tonight’s contest after logging 27 minutes in Wednesday’s outing against the Knicks, where he posted 11 points, six rebounds, and four assists. Despite a rough 4-for-14 shooting night, his presence alone boosted Charlotte’s tempo and spacing. Even as whispers of ongoing ankle management persist, the official injury report listed him as fully available.That clarity allows the Hornets to lean on his signature dynamism - no-look passes, deep-range orchestration, and paint manipulation.This comes after a turbulent stretch in which Ball missed significant time due to a right ankle impingement. His return has been gradual, but the recent uptick in minutes shows that the team is confident in his durability. With Brandon Miller also cleared, Charlotte’s offensive engine finally resembles what it was designed to be earlier this season. Still, Hornets fans understand how quickly fortunes can shift if Ball tweaks the ankle again.Chicago enters Spectrum Center in disarray. The Bulls are dealing with an injury avalanche headlined by Zach Collins, who remains out with a left scaphoid fracture, and Isaac Okoro, listed as doubtful due to lumbar radiculopathy. Several others are questionable: Nikola Vucevic (knee), Coby White (calf/injury management), Patrick Williams (wrist), Kevin Huerter (pelvic contusion), and Dalen Terry (calf).

Donald Trump and his love for golf

The current President of the USA is known for his love of golf. In fact, he loves it so much that since he started on his second term, he has golfed 75 out of 313 days of his presidency. Which is basically about 25% of his second term. And that did not come without costing a pretty buck, as latest reports suggest that President Trump has spent more than 70 million taxpayer dollars to continue his hobby.He travels not just all around the United States, but the world to feed his obsession with the sport. From New Jersey to Scotland to Dubai, he will travel anywhere as long as it means he gets to play golf, and while it's a fun time for the president, it does cost the average American citizen a pretty penny they pay in the form of taxes.Before he became the president of the United States, Donald Trump was invested in the real estate business, and owns about 17 golf courses worldwide. And he travels all around to play golf in whichever course he pleases. Sometimes it's close to home, in Washington D.C., sometimes it's a little far away in Indonesia, but golfing hasn't stopped. On Thanksgiving Day, Trump was asked about his handicap, to which he said,""I’ve won 38 club championships and I don't get to practice....SoI'm a very low handicap, and I've won 38…everyone legitimately. So I guess I got to be around scratch or better. I beat a plus three.""Having spent 75 out of 313 days of his second presidency golfing, the president has cost American taxpayers more than $70 million, and if the numbers stay the same, by the end of his tenure, he will have spent about $300 million. He frequently travels to Florida and New Jersey by air, as well as frequents his local course in Washington, D.C. to keep his love for the sport alive. He has spent a pretty penny designing these high-end golf courses and providing every amenity possible. But the cost in comparison seems a little too much.Also Read: Donald Trump brags about golf achievements after announcing National Guard Sarah Beckstrom’s death in DC shooting","The current President of the USA is known for his love of golf.

Giannis Antetokounmpo’s status remains up in the air due to a lingering left adductor strain

Giannis’ Injury Report vs the New York Knicks (November 28, 2025)

Stakes for Milwaukee’s NBA Cup Hopes

Thehead into their NBA Cup showdown against the New York Knicks on November 28, 2025, with uncertainty surrounding their franchise superstar., and the final call will be made closer to tip-off at Madison Square Garden. As the Bucks attempt to keep their Cup dreams alive, the possibility of another game without their two-time MVP looms large.Milwaukee enters this matchup under immense pressure. A six-game losing streak has dropped them to 8-11 and 11th in the Eastern Conference, a slide largely attributed to Giannis’ four-game absence. With the NBA Cup wildcard still within reach, every possession becomes crucial for a team desperate to rediscover momentum.Giannis Antetokounmpo first suffered the left adductor strain on November 17 against the Cavaliers, logging only 13 minutes before exiting the game. Since then, the Milwaukee Bucks have cautiously monitored his progress. After participating in pregame workouts and practice on November 27, he was upgraded to questionable, with coach Doc Rivers clarifying that the delay in return is not due to any physical setback.Before the injury, Giannis Antetokounmpo was in dominant form - averaging 31 points, 10.8 rebounds, and 6.8 assists across 13 games while shooting an impressive 62% from the field and 50% from beyond the arc. His absence has exposed Milwaukee’s reliance on his two-way presence, creating a noticeable drop-off in rim pressure, playmaking, and overall offensive cohesion.The Milwaukee Bucks continue to feel the impact of other injuries as well. Kevin Porter Jr. remains out following right knee meniscus surgery, Taurean Prince is sidelined due to neck surgery, and Alex Antetokounmpo is currently in the G League system.This Group C finale is critical.

DJ Moore’s injury update clears him for action ahead of the Bears’ next matchup

Every Bears fan knows the emotional trauma of checking the injury report every week like it’s a final exam score. And this week, all eyes were glued to one name: DJ Moore. After a stretch of uncertainty and practice updates that felt more dramatic than a reality show teaser, fans finally got the answer they were hoping for. The Bears star wideout and the offense’s spark plug is officially good to go. So yes, Chicago, you can exhale. Let’s break down why his availability today is a huge deal.The week began with mild panic when DJ Moore popped up in headlines after missing time in practice. Even though the team didn’t list anything major, fans immediately feared the worst. He’s the most reliable receiving option Chicago has, and losing him especially when the offense has been trying to build momentum would’ve been a nightmare.Thankfully, the final injury report confirmed the best-case scenario: DJ Moore is expected to play. He carries no injury designation, meaning the team is confident in his health and ready to deploy him as usual.This isn’t just another name returning to the lineup, this is the guy who shifts coverages, opens lanes, and gives the quarterback a dependable target when things get messy. Without Moore, defenses collapse on the run and dare Chicago to win with secondary receivers.With Moore? The entire field opens up.That’s why his availability today completely changes Chicago’s offensive plan. Expect more aggressive play-calling, deeper routes, and plenty of chances for Moore to take over the game the way he has all season.Even though he’s cleared, the Bears may still manage his workload just to avoid flare-ups. But if the game script calls for it, Moore will absolutely see meaningful volume. Chicago leans on him heavily whether it's third-down conversions, red-zone looks, or momentum-changing deep shots.Now all eyes shift to kickoff to see if he can deliver the game-changing moments Chicago desperately needs.Also read - Will Saquon Barkley play against the Chicago Bears today?

The Cleveland Browns superstar and two-time Olympic gold medalist Chloe Kim have gone public, sealing their relationship with a sweet kiss caught on video during the Browns’ Nov. 25 game.But beyond the affectionate moment and the cameras, fans really want to know: who exactly is Chloe Kim, the woman capturing the heart of one of the NFL’s most dominant defensive players? Far from being just a supportive girlfriend in the stands, Chloe is a global sports powerhouse with her own legacy, molded by talent, cultural impact, and a fiercely authentic personality.Chloe Kim isn’t simply “the athlete dating an NFL player”, she’s one of the most celebrated female Olympians of her generation. A Southern California native, Chloe became the youngest woman to ever win Olympic halfpipe gold at just 17, and later added a second gold medal to her name, cementing herself as a snowboarding legend. Her grounded personality, humility, and witty online presence, like her playful “rawr XD. ” Instagram caption, have made her beloved among Gen Z fans..What's particularly compelling about the Chloe Kim and Myles Garrett pairing is that both are elite athletes in completely different worlds.Myles just broke his single-season sack record, and Chloe is currently preparing to compete in the 2026 Winter Olympics. Instead of existing in competitive tension, their careers seem to complement one another.Chloe has spoken about how gaming helps her reconnect with her inner child and keep stress in check, noting, “I think having a love for gaming is everything to me…” and adding, “even my boyfriend, he’s so good at video games.” That playful intimacy combined with mutual respect is exactly why the relationship resonates with fans..It’s rare to see two high-profile athletes at the peak of their careers so genuinely supportive of each other, publicly yet authentically. As Chloe heads toward Italy for Olympic competition and Myles Garrett continues his pursuit of NFL greatness, this relationship feels rooted not in spotlight, not in hype, but in admiration and shared joy.Also Read: Aaron Rodgers’ secret marriage mystery grows louder as even family admits they’ve never met his wife","Cleveland Browns star Myles Garrett and Olympic snowboarding champion Chloe Kim have confirmed their relationship.

Coach Tourigny supports Clayton Keller during an extremely difficult time

Clayton Keller is going through one of the hardest times of his life, but the captain of the Utah Mammoth, who just lost his father, Bryan Keller, has decided to go on the ice the very next day. The matchup against the Dallas Stars is emotional for Keller, who is a 27-year-old star forward, but it is also a decision based on loyalty and his inner strength. Keller, who has already scored 21 points in 24 games this season, has always been the emotional support for the Mammoth, and his decision to play shows both his commitment to the team and the ties he has with his father.The word came out very fast and left the team in shock. Keller's father died unexpectedly in his sleep, and it was an extremely deep sorrow for the whole Keller family. But Keller was firm that he did not want to leave his mates and, at the same time, he wanted to pay tribute to his father by continuing to play. This very difficult case has only added to the aura of the player who is famous for his leadership, coolness, and grit. Thus, he becomes a greater being in the eyes of the league and the locker room.Utah Mammoth coach Andre Tourigny, who became the organization’s spokesperson on Friday, was also the one to give a really touching speech that mainly stressed Keller and his family.Tourigny pointed out that the team's first concern is to support their captain in the midst of his great loss. He emphasized over and over that no words can truly express the suffering Keller is undergoing, but that presence and loyalty are the most important things. Tourigny says, “Clayton wants to play and be with the team” and that the Mammoth will be there for him in every way they can.Tourigny pointed out that the real loyalty is revealed during the hardship, stressing that the Mammoth consider themselves a family first and a hockey team second. His communication clarified that the whole organization is together with Keller, honoring his choice and at the same time making sure that he gets the support he needs.During a period characterized by sorrow, Keller’s decision to go on and Tourigny’s calm direction reflect the strong trust and bond that exists in the Mammoth organization.Also Read: NHL Updates: Marcus Foligno placed on injured reserve, will miss upcoming games for Minnesota Wild","Clayton Keller, captain of the Utah Mammoth, lost his father, Bryan Keller, on Friday.

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has revealed his annual holiday reading list as the 2025 comes to a close. Gates has recommended five books and he believes that all these titles spark curiosity and reflection during the quieter days of the winter season. “Each of these books pulls back the curtain on how something important really works: how people find purpose later in life, how we should think about climate change, how creative industries evolve, how humans communicate,” wrote Gates.In the blog post, Gates has also explained that holidays are the perfect tome to slow down and also catch up on reading. “There’s something about the quieter days around the holidays that makes it easier to sit down with a good book,” he wrote. His list on 2025 book recommendations reflects on his fascination with how the world works and how you can start a great conversation.The book belongs to the fiction genre and its a story of an aging janitor and a wise octopus captive hime with its empathy and storytelling. “Van Pelt's story made me think about the challenge of filling the days after you stop working—and what communities can do to help older people find purpose,” said Gates.The books explains about the climate challenges. The book structures 50 big questions on climate change, nuclear power and renewables. “ I’ve followed Hannah’s work at Our World in Data for years, and her new book is one of the clearest explanations of the climate challenge I’ve read. She’s realistic about the risks but grounded in data that shows real progress,” said Gates.It is a memoir which recounts the Diller’s extraordinary career in Hollywood, media, and technology, blending personal anecdotes with reflections on power, risk-taking, and the evolution of entertainment and digital industries. “He’s spent his life betting on ideas before they were obvious, and the industries he’s transformed show how much those bets can pay off,” said Gates.The book explains about the mysteries of human behaviour and how people communicate. “Although the topic itself is pretty complicated, the book is readable and practical, and it made me see everyday social interactions in a new light,” added Gate.The books offers a glimpse of at why America seems to struggle to build things and what it will take to fix that. The book argues that progress depends not just on good ideas but on the systems that help ideas spread.","Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has revealed his annual holiday reading list as the 2025 comes to a close.

I feel it’s a good chance. It would be better if we have more Indian overseas players with Indian passport. If he’s available and playing outside, it would be very good. It would definitely improve our performance. In the last game (against Bangladesh) had Ryan Williams been there, we could have performed better,” Jamil remarked.After relinquishing his Australian passport to become an Indian citizen, Williams travelled to Dhaka as a member of Jamil’s squad but could not play because of the delay in getting the mandatory Fifa approval with respect to the change of member association.",Jamil’s stint with the Blue Tigers began with a creditable third-place finish in their maiden CAFA Nations Cup but it turned out to be false dawn earlier than anticipated.

Inter Miami head coach Javier Mascherano showered praise on Lionel Messi , calling him “extraordinary”, after the Argentine icon guided the club into their maiden MLS Cup final with a commanding 5-1 victory over New York City FC on Saturday.Miami’s charge to the championship match was led by a brilliant Tadeo Allende hat-trick, while Mateo Silvetti and Telasco Segovia also found the net in a dominant performance at Fort Lauderdale.Messi, 38, didn’t score on the night, but produced a moment of pure class when he set up Silvetti for Miami’s third goal. That assist came just as New York were closing in on an equaliser and effectively put the contest to bed.Mascherano, who previously shared the pitch with Messi for Barcelona and Argentina, said his star man continues to redefine what is possible.“Leo has spoiled us with the extraordinary,” Mascherano said. “He is unique, someone we won’t see again. Maybe people expected a goal today, but he brought calmness with that third goal. Only he can spot that pass. It basically ended the match.”Miami will now welcome either San Diego FC or the Vancouver Whitecaps, who face off later on Saturday, in next weekend’s MLS Cup final.The team enters the title clash in peak form, having smashed FC Cincinnati 4-0 in the previous round and now dismantling New York with similar ruthlessness.Allende was at the centre of Miami’s attacking storm once again. The 26-year-old struck first in the 14th minute after beating the offside trap, then doubled the lead with an outstanding header shortly after.New York responded through Justin Haak’s headed effort in the 37th minute and almost levelled when Julian Fernandez drew a superb save from Rocco Rios Novo in the 66th minute.That moment proved pivotal. Miami instantly countered, with Rodrigo De Paul and Jordi Alba combining before Messi threaded a perfectly weighted pass to Silvetti, who fired home for 3-1.Segovia made it 4-1 in the 83rd minute, and Allende completed his hat-trick a minute later, setting off huge celebrations.Mascherano credited the squad for turning around a season that once looked in disarray.“The players deserve the praise. They understood the direction we needed to take,” he said. “We grew stronger together and reached this stage with a real sense of unity. Everyone pulls in the same direction, and who starts doesn’t matter. The strength of this group is unshakeable.”",Inter Miami beat New York City FC 5-1 in MLS Eastern Conference final.

Why the Phillies Would Accept

On-Field Fit and Lineup Impact

Pros, Cons, and Overall Verdict

A blockbuster trade built aroundand thewould instantly become one of the most fascinating storylines of the winter. While not an active or imminent negotiation, the concept makes enough baseball sense that it continues to surface in league speculation. The idea centers on Toronto gaining the middle-order thunder they’ve lacked, while Philadelphia reallocates resources from an aging slugger to a younger, more controllable core.The financial mechanics are a major part of the intrigue. Schwarber is expected to land a contract in the $35-40 million AAV range over four seasons, a level that reflects his near-MVP offensive output and long résumé of postseason impact. Any team acquiring him must weigh both the production and the significant financial weight attached.A clean version of this hypothetical deal sends Schwarber to Toronto - potentially with a bit of cash relief - while Philadelphia receives a versatile, inexpensive bat such as Davis Schneider plus one MLB-ready arm or upper-minors pitching prospect. The Phillies could choose to absorb a slice of Schwarber’s contract to upgrade the talent level coming back, a familiar tactic in trades involving star hitters on nine-figure deals.Toronto’s current roster leans heavily on Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Anthony Santander for power, with no true left-handed, full-time DH threat. Schwarber solves that instantly. He would slot into the No. 2 or No. 4 spot, surrounding Guerrero with on-base ability and elite home-run production. With seasons of 38 homers in 2024 and a massive 56-homer, 132-RBI campaign in 2025, he becomes their most dangerous slugger since the Bautista-Encarnación era. Toronto also gains a hitter built for October, as Schwarber owns double-digit postseason home runs and deep-run experience with multiple organizations.For Philadelphia, the logic is financial efficiency and roster balance. Committing four years of near-MVP money to a slugger in his mid-30s is risky, especially with existing large contracts on the books. Trading Schwarber gives them payroll room to strengthen pitching and defense while adding long-term value in the form of Schneider and a young arm. The Phillies also have some redundancy in corner power bats and have shown interest in distributing DH at-bats more broadly.Schwarber becomes Toronto’s primary DH, with occasional starts in left field. This reshapes the top six: George Springer, Schwarber, Guerrero Jr., Santander, Daulton Varsho, and Andres Gimenez - a group that forces opposing managers into difficult bullpen decisions due to alternating handedness and multiple 30-plus-homer threats.Toronto gains a game-changing middle-order hammer, improved lineup balance, and proven playoff power. The risks involve Schwarber’s defensive limitations, strikeout rate, and the aging curve tied to a large multiyear contract. Philadelphia, meanwhile, gains payroll flexibility, youth, and positional versatility but loses a fan-favorite slugger and must replace 40–50 homers in the near term.Also read: MLB trade rumors: New York Mets could acquire $15 million San Diego Padres Starter after Dylan Cease deal In the short run, Toronto likely wins the on-field upgrade.

Indian-origin MAGA bigwig: The most Googled queries about Nikki Haley's son Nalin Haley,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/indian-origin-maga-bigwig-the-most-googled-queries-about-nikki-haleys-son-nalin-haley/articleshow/125664398.cms,"1. “Does Nalin Haley have a husband?”

6. “How old is Nalin Haley?”

7. “What is Nalin Haley’s ethnicity?”

8. “Is Nalin Haley Catholic?”

So why is Nalin Haley suddenly everywhere?





There are political children who stay politely in the background, and then there is Nalin Haley — the unexpected viral presence who has, quite accidentally, become the most interesting Haley in American politics. In a country obsessed with dynasties, scandals, and generational rebellions, it is Nalin — not Nikki — who is driving the conversation.He has the crisp confidence of somebody born into public life, the contrarian instincts of a debater who never lost a round in school, and the generational frustration of someone who believes his cohort was handed the economy at closing time. That cocktail has made him an online magnet for praise, criticism, fascination, and endless Google searches.So let’s walk through the Internet’s favourite questions about him — one by one — and answer them properly.No.This bizarre search term refuses to die, largely because the algorithm cannot distinguish curiosity from chaos. Nalin Haley is not married, not publicly dating, and has never hinted at any relationship. The fascination is pure internet noise, not biography.If you strip away the editorial footnotes and the awkward phrasing, the story is clear.Nalin Haley is a 24-year-old American political voice who grew up in a family that straddled multiple identities — Christian parents, Sikh grandparents, and the complexities of being raised in the South by a mother who built herself into one of the country’s most recognisable Indian-American conservatives.His page reads less like a diary and more like the origin arc of a Gen-Z firebrand who discovered politics not as inheritance but as indignation.He does, but it is spectacularly uninteresting — which, ironically, is part of the appeal.For someone becoming a viral political figure, his professional footprint is surprisingly minimal: a clean educational summary, a few internships, the occasional campaign involvement.It gives him the odd credibility of a young man who didn’t spend his adolescence polishing résumés; he spent it forming opinions.His parents are Nikki and Michael Haley.But this question keeps trending for a reason: Nalin is not a polite echo of his mother’s politics. He is something else — sharper, angrier, and far more unfiltered.He does not walk in his mother’s ideological footsteps. Sometimes he sprints ahead of them. Sometimes he walks sideways. Sometimes he blows the path up entirely.That is why people keep searching: they want to know how someone with this lineage ended up building his own ideological vocabulary so young.He studied political science.By all accounts, he enjoyed the subject not as academic theory but as ammunition. His worldview isn’t shaped by textbooks; it is shaped by his belief that his generation was left to pick up the economic bill for mistakes they never made.His politics sound less like seminar chatter and more like a frustrated audit of the nation.He is 24.Old enough to be articulate.Young enough to be impatient.Exactly the age where American politicians historically start developing their first serious ideological identity.And unlike his peers, who often bury their politics under irony and detachment, Nalin expresses his with startling clarity.His ancestry is Indian, through his maternal grandparents.But Nalin himself rejects the label. He doesn’t romanticise it. He doesn’t use it. He doesn’t even politely gesture towards it for cultural diplomacy.He insists that he is American — full stop.Not Indian-American. Not part-something. Not hyphenated.This self-positioning has made him a lightning rod: an Indian-origin young American who refuses the script that others assume he should perform.Yes.In 2025, he entered the Catholic Church after a long period of spiritual confusion that came from navigating a home shaped by Christian parents and Sikh grandparents.Unlike his politics, which are sharp-edged and confrontational, his religious turn is quiet, personal, and unusually sincere. It is one of the few areas where he does not perform for an audience.Because he represents a generational shift that both parties ignored.He talks like someone who grew up watching the American Dream evaporate into student loans, unaffordable housing, and political polarisation that never once benefited people his age.He rejects inherited identities.He questions every established norm.He pushes against his own family’s political comfort zone.He is not trying to become the next face of MAGA or the next campus conservative icon. He is voicing a generational grievance — and doing it with unusual clarity for someone his age.Whether people agree with him or not is irrelevant.The point is that they cannot stop looking him up.If you want, I can now write a more dramatic version, a cleaner news-feature version, or a Weekend Vine-style roast of the phenomenon called Nalin Haley.","Nalin Haley is a 24-year-old American political voice who grew up in a family that straddled multiple identities.

A source claimed that former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is dating pop star Katy Perry solely for fame or to improve his public appeal after his political life went downhill. The insider suggested that Trudeau benefits more from the romantic relationship than Perry herself.“People have been fascinated with Katy for years, and they’re always going to be curious about what she does next,” the source told Star Magazine.The insider added: “Not so with Justin. He’s a nepo baby who flamed out in his political career and doesn’t have much of a path forward without his celebrity status.”“Justin doesn’t have much of a path forward without his celebrity status.” The source added, “Dating Katy has made him more famous, in a positive way, and he doesn’t want this trend to stop…It’s absolutely key to his survival as a public figure.”According to the insider, Trudeau “needs this relationship way more than Katy does, and everybody around her knows that.” They added: “Katy doesn’t want or need any more of that stuff, but it’s Justin’s lifeblood and the only thing that’s keeping him relevant.”The romance between 40-year-old Katy Perry and 53-year-old Justin Trudeau has been quietly developing for months.

"Tom Stoppard, playwright who dazzled with verbal gymnastics, dies",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/tom-stoppard-playwright-who-dazzled-with-verbal-gymnastics-dies/articleshow/125667598.cms,"Credit: Reuters





LONDON: ""What's it about?"" was a frequent response from bemused theatre-goers to ""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead"", Tom Stoppard's first stage triumph. Tired of being asked, Stoppard is said to have replied to a woman outside a theatre on Broadway: ""It's about to make me very rich. ""He later questioned whether he had said ""very"", Hermione Lee writes in Stoppard's authorised biography, but he had undoubtedly managed to transform his previously precarious finances.For every puzzled spectator, there were many more ecstatic fans and critics, dazzled by the wit, brilliant wordplay and sheer daring of a young playwright who had turned Shakespeare inside out and placed the spotlight, not on the eponymous Hamlet, but on two minor characters from the same play.First performed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 1966, the following year, ""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead"" made Stoppard, at the age of 29, the youngest playwright to be staged at the National Theatre in London. From there, the play went to Broadway and had more than 250 productions worldwide over its first decade.Stoppard's career flourished for decades more, embracing stage, screen and radio, and demonstrating his thirst to tackle any subject -- from mathematics to Dadaist art to landscape gardening.Stoppard's many other successes included ""The Real Inspector Hound"", which parodied stage whodunnits and sent up theatre critics, ""Jumpers"", a 1.5 million word epic that delighted and confused its public, and ""Night and Day"", a satire on the British media.His densely packed, intricately constructed plays were based on extensive research. ""Arcadia"", in 1993, considered by many critics to be his masterpiece, blended chaos theory, Isaac Newton and the poet Lord Byron's love life.The word Stoppardian, first recorded in 1978, meanwhile entered the Oxford English Dictionary. It refers to the use of verbal gymnastics while addressing philosophical concepts. The honours he won included an Oscar for co-authoring the screenplay of the 1998 hit film ""Shakespeare in Love"", and a record five Tony awards for Best Play.He died at home in Dorset, surrounded by his family, his agent said Saturday.Stoppard was born Tomas Straussler on July 3, 1937 in what was then Czechoslovakia, the son of Eugen Straussler, a doctor, and Marta (or Martha), nee Beckova, who had trained as a nurse. The Jewish family fled the Nazis and moved to Singapore when he was an infant. Singapore in turn became unsafe. With his mother and elder brother Peter, he escaped to India. His father stayed behind and died while fleeing after Singapore fell to the Japanese.In India, Marta Straussler married a British army major, Kenneth Stoppard, and the family moved to England.Boarding school followed at Pocklington in Yorkshire, where Tom Stoppard loved cricket more than drama and learned how to be British, which Major Stoppard considered the ultimate nationality.The adult Stoppard, who rediscovered decades later the Jewish roots that he explored in his final play, would accuse his stepfather of ""an innate antisemitism"".","""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead"" made Tom Stoppard the youngest playwright to be staged at the National Theatre in London.

A gold pocket watch belonging to a Titanic victim sold for a record 1.78 million pounds at an auction in Wiltshire, setting the highest price ever paid for Titanic memorabilia, according to Henry Aldridge & Son.The 18-karat gold watch sold on Saturday belonged to Isidor Straus, the Macy’s co-owner who was travelling first class on the Titanic with his wife, Ida, when it tragically sank in 1912. The piece is engraved with his initials and the date of his 43rd birthday, according to the auction house. The 18-carat Jules Jurgensen watch, gifted to him in 1888, had stopped at 2:20 a.m., the moment the ship disappeared beneath the Atlantic, the auctioneers said.The New York Times reported that the timepiece fetched $2.3 million, surpassing the auction house’s previous record for Titanic artefacts — a pocket watch linked to the Carpathia’s captain, sold in 2024 for $1.9 million.The BBC noted that the Straus watch had remained within the family for generations before being repaired and restored by Straus’s great-grandson, Kenneth Hollister Straus.Straus’s body was recovered roughly two weeks after the disaster, while Ida’s remains were never found.Survivors recalled the couple refusing to be separated as lifeboats were loaded. As The Guardian reported, they were last seen sitting together on deckchairs, choosing to face their fate side by side — a moment later fictionalised in James Cameron’s 1997 film Titanic. The old couple were depicted in James Cameron’s 1997 film “Titanic”, shown lying together as their cabin floods.A letter written by Ida on Titanic stationery, posted while she was on board, also sold at Saturday’s auction for 100,000 pounds according to the BBC, and $131,000 according to The New York Times. In it, she wrote: “What a ship! So huge and so magnificently appointed … they really are rooms.”Other items sold included a Titanic passenger list (104,000 pounds) and a gold medal awarded to the crew of RMS Carpathia (86,000 pounds). The auction totalled 3 million pounds.Auctioneer Andrew Aldridge told the BBC the record price underscored the enduring power of the Titanic story, calling the Strauses “the ultimate love story” and a testament to the lasting respect in which they are held.","The 18-karat gold watch sold on Saturday belonged to Isidor Straus, the Macy’s co-owner who was travelling first class on the Titanic with his wife, Ida.
