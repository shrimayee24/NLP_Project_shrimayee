Ruturaj Gaikwad press conference: Reveals Gautam Gambhir message, No.4 and more

Poll Do you believe Kohli can maintain this form for the upcoming matches? Yes, he can No, it's temporary I'm not sure

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli hasn’t just returned to form — he has set off a nationwide frenzy strong enough to sell out an entire stadium. Back-to-back centuries in Ranchi and Raipur have turned what was shaping up to be a low-interest ODI in Visakhapatnam into the hottest cricket ticket in India this week. According to officials at the Andhra Cricket Association (ACA), Kohli’s stunning run-scoring spree single-handedly reversed sluggish online bookings for the third ODI against South Africa at the Dr. Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy ACA-VDCA Stadium.When tickets first went on sale digitally on November 28, the association braced for a disappointing turnout. The lack of buzz even pushed the ACA towards the rare option of setting up offline ticket counters despite committing to a fully digital system this time. But everything changed the moment Kohli unfurled a spectacular century in Ranchi on November 30. Suddenly, Phase 2 and 3 of ticket sales disappeared in minutes.“The first phase response wasn’t good,” confirmed Y. Venkatesh from ACA’s Media and Operations department to The Indian Express. “After Kohli’s hundred at Ranchi, the second and third phases vanished in minutes. Nothing was left unsold.”It wasn’t just victory that fans chased — it was the chance to witness a phenomenon.Kohli’s numbers in Vizag fuelled the madness: an average of 97.83 in seven ODIs, featuring three centuries and a 99. Even ticket prices ranging from Rs 1,200 to Rs 18,000 couldn’t slow demand.The frenzy spilled into real life, too. Hours before Team India landed in Vizag, hundreds gathered at the airport, waiting through repeated flight delays from Raipur. Security guards were bombarded with one question in multiple languages: “When are they landing?” The answer mattered because Kohli was on board.After his 53rd ODI century in Raipur, cricket legends poured in praise. But the loudest came from Mohammad Kaif, who summed up a nation’s emotion in eight simple words: “Without Kohli cricket is nothing… pure vintage!”","Back-to-back centuries in Ranchi and Raipur have turned what was shaping up to be a low-interest ODI in Visakhapatnam into the hottest cricket ticket in India this week.

"At Vatican observatory, Goa priest decoding cosmic past",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/at-vatican-observatory-goa-priest-decoding-cosmic-past/articleshow/125810143.cms,"Fr Richard D’Souza with Pope Leo XIV. D’Souza has served as superior of the Jesuit community attached to Vatican Observatory since 2002



PANAJI: Physicist, astronomer, scientist, Indiana Jones. Not quite the words to describe a priest, let alone a 46-year-old Jesuit from Mapusa. But that is exactly what Fr Richard D’Souza is.At the Vatican Observatory in Castel Gandolfo, an ancient castle that once hosted pontiffs, D’Souza is piecing together the violent history of galactic cannibalism — the consumption of smaller galaxies by larger ones. “My work is basically to understand the histories of galaxies. I try to be a galactic archaeologist, so I put on this Indiana Jones cap and I try to see how galaxies grow to the massive size that they are,” he said.His breakthrough came in 2018, published in Nature Astronomy, when he and Eric Bell proposed that the Andromeda galaxy’s most significant merger — a violent collision that reshaped the Milky Way’s nearest galactic neighbour — occurred approximately 2 billion years ago.D’Souza’s own trajectory was less violent. Born in Pune in 1978, raised partly in Kuwait and partly in Goa, he entered the Society of Jesus, the formal name of the Jesuits, at 18.A Catholic order known for its intellectual pursuits, the society recognised in him something worth nurturing.“I used to go for camping trips while studying at St Britto’s, in the countryside, far away from the city lights where you could see the night sky. This was perhaps my first interest in the heavens, and this was confirmed a lot during my novitiate in Desur, Belagavi, which was a remote place where I could see the night sky,” said D’Souza.For his Jesuit formators, D’Souza’s path was neither straight nor predictable. After completing his physics degree at St Xavier’s College, Mumbai, he pursued a master’s degree in Heidelberg, working at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy. Then came philosophy in Pune, as his Jesuit formation demanded, followed by theology. Then, a gravitational pull-back to physics through his doctoral work at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Munich.“I seriously started thinking of astronomy as a career when I started my master’s in physics at Heidelberg, where I did some small research project on astronomy, and it was this that really attracted me. I fell in love with the subject,” he said.Between philosophy and theology, he briefly veered towards social action in 2007 when he helped start St Paul’s Community College in Belagavi for school dropouts. This oscillation between the cosmic and the communal, between the spiritual and the celestial, should be debilitating. Not for him.“Our work at the observatory is basically doing scientific research with 80-90% of our time going in collecting and analysing data, and going for conferences. The remaining 10% of the time, we remind the Church that faith and science need to go together,” said D’Souza.Since 2022, D’Souza has served as superior of the Jesuit community attached to the Vatican Observatory. He is now director of the observatory itself, one of the oldest astronomical institutes in the world that dates back to 1774.Given that he straddles the two heavenly realms of theology and astronomy, he is often asked about extraterrestrial life. “I was waiting for this question and my response is, thank God I am not an expert on that,” he recently said at an event in Porvorim, blending humour with pragmatism.","Fr Richard D’Souza is a 46-year-old Jesuit from Mapusa.

‘SC ruling on wedding gifts a win for all Muslim women’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-ruling-on-wedding-gifts-a-win-for-all-muslim-women/articleshow/125809870.cms,"Supreme Court

Shocking Secrets Of Halala, Nikaah & Triple Talaaq Exposed By Ex-Muslim Saleem Wastik | Times Mantra

NEW DELHI: More than 20 years after her marriage, Rousanara Begum finally heard the words she had waited for when the Supreme Court recently ruled that a divorced Muslim woman can reclaim the wedding gifts her parents gave her at the time of marriage.Now nearly 45, she told TOI on Saturday: “It started two decades ago. I had to fight a lot for the victory.” For her, the SC’s decision is not just a legal victory. It is the closing of a wound she has carried since 2005. Rousanara was barely married when her marital life collapsed. According to her case records, she was married in 2005 but the relationship fell apart almost immediately.By late 2005, the first cracks had appeared. In 2008, after allegations of dowry harassment, mental cruelty, and being forced out of her marital home, she returned to her parents. The talaq eventually came in 2011. The gifts her father had given -- 7 lakh rupees in cash and some gold that were part of her wedding -- were never returned to her. “(Rs) Seven lakh is a lot of money for folks like us,” she said in broken Urdu.Unlike many families who fear the social judgement that comes with a daughter’s divorce, her parents stood rock-solid behind her. However, despite winning in the lower courts more than once, Rousanara’s fight ran into a wall at Calcutta HC, which in Jan 2024 reversed the earlier orders and denied her the right to reclaim the cash and gold her parents had given when she married.HC ruled in favour of the divorced husband, SK Salahuddin. This prompted Rousanara to move the SC.Through the years of litigation, Rousanara rebuilt her life even as she walked in and out of courtrooms. Today she works as a primary school teacher in a govt school, is remarried, and has two sons.For her lawyer, Syed Mehdi Imam, it is one of the most meaningful victories he has seen. “This was a grey area. Till today, no clear judgment existed on whether the money and gold given to a bride at marriage, but kept with the groom, must be returned after divorce,” he told TOI.“I urged the court: decide this once and for all.” Imam said there was hesitation in some quarters because the matter could have been misread as a religious flashpoint. “There could potentially have been pushback from some corners,” he said. “Some feared it could flare into a religious controversy since this issue had never been adjudicated before. It could have blown out of proportion as it was sensitive.”Then, finally on Dec 2, SC placed equality and dignity at the heart of its interpretation of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, observing that law must be read in light of the lived experiences of women, especially in rural and small-town India, where patriarchal discrimination remains embedded.Muslim bodies have welcomed the ruling. Maulana Raziul Islam Nadwi, national secretary of JIH and its Shari’ah Council, said, “Husband’s gifts to the wife, even if the marriage does not last, cannot be taken back under Islamic law. Women’s gifts have a different status. Shari’at gives the wife this right, unless she or her family willingly relinquishes it. There is no contradiction in the SC order.”When the verdict came, Imam typed three words to her during the court lunch break: “Won the matter.” That night, his phone rang. She was in tears. “I am very happy,” she said. “This win is for all Muslim women like me.” For many divorced Muslim women across India, this case from rural Bengal is a precedent: one that finally clarifies that what is given to a bride at marriage belongs to her alone.","Rousanara Begum was barely married when her marital life collapsed.

Gautam Gambhir Press Conference: Team India head coach heaves fire after 2-1 ODI series win over SA

India's head coach Gautam Gambhir has strongly dismissed social media discussions about split coaching during a Saturday press conference. He expressed surprise at these theories and advised commentators to maintain their boundaries.The debate emerged following India's recent 0-2 Test series loss to South Africa. Several cricket personalities, including an IPL team owner, suggested to BCCI about having separate coaches for red-ball and white-ball formats.""Look, there were a lot of talks because the results didn't go in our favour. But the most surprising thing is that not once did any media or journalist wrote that our first Test match was played without the captain, who didn't bat in both innings,"" Gambhir said during the post-match press meet after India clinched the ODI series against SA 2-1.Gambhir emphasised that certain individuals were making comments unrelated to on-field cricket matters.""Some people also said things that have nothing to do with cricket. An IPL team owner also wrote about split coaching. So this is surprising. It's very important for people to stay in their domain. Because if we don't go into someone's domain, then they also don't have the right to come into our domain,"" Gambhir added.During the post-match conference in Guwahati, Gambhir addressed his achievements as the red-ball coach following the home series defeat.""I don't give excuses in press conferences. It doesn't mean that you don't show the facts in front of the world or the country. When you go through a transition and when you lose your captain, who is also your main batter in red-ball cricket against such a team.""""Then obviously the results are difficult because you don't have that much experience in red ball cricket. And the surprising thing is that no one even talked about it. All the discussions about wickets, I don't know what all things were said,"" he noted.He highlighted that captain Shubman Gill's absence due to a neck injury during both innings of the first Test in Kolkata was largely overlooked in media discussions.","Gautam Gambhir has strongly dismissed social media discussions about split coaching.

The victory sealed the series 2-1 for India, with Rohit Sharma contributing 75 runs and crossing the landmark of 20,000 international runs.A commanding 155-run opening stand between Jaiswal and Rohit in 25.5 overs laid the platform for India’s chase of 271.

Kayla Nicole turns heads in Antigua swimsuit photos



Kayla Nicole, the ex-girlfriend of Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce , has everyone talking again this weekend after a burst of new vacation photos put her right back at the center of attention. She may have ended her relationship with Kelce nearly three years ago, but her presence has only grown stronger as she continues to build a career that blends journalism, fitness leadership, and digital influence.Through her brand, Tribe Therepe, Nicole has carved out a space that celebrates what she calls “feel good fitness.” The Pepperdine University graduate believes in training both the mind and body, and she often opens up about her own journey. “It’s focusing on the mental health component of working out, which is really, really important for me and really resonates with me, and really just encouraging people to mentally take care of themselves,” Nicole said, via PEOPLE. She added, “I think that when your mind is in a healthy place, your body will follow. So, I started going to therapy and quickly realized, okay, it’s one thing to be physically fit, but it’s another thing to be mentally fit.You could be in the best shape of your life, but mentally, if you are not a healthy person, it’s not going to feel good.”Kayla Nicole sparked a wave of reactions online after sharing swimsuit photos from her Antigua getaway. She captioned one post, “Literally, where I want to be,” giving followers a glimpse of her carefree beachside moments. In another set of snaps, the 34-year-old posed in a string, animal print bikini paired with a brown cowgirl hat, a look that quickly drew praise from fans.Her social feeds have remained active and upbeat even as she navigates the online backlash that has followed her since Kelce began dating Taylor Swift. Nicole addressed that pressure during an appearance on the Unapologetically Angel podcast. “I would be lying if I said that that level of hate and just online chaos doesn’t impact me,” she said. “It does. Even to this day.” She added, “It has nothing to do with me. I think there’s something about that level of fame that attracts crazy people. And it’s unfortunate because I’ve never done anything to warrant that kind of backlash.”Still, support is rising, and Nicole continues to be candid about her personal life. On Harry Jowsey’s “Boyfriend Material” podcast, she joked, “I keep saying I don’t want to date any more athletes, but I’m down to date the owners of the teams.” She has also shared that she gravitates toward powerful, driven men. “I would love to just date someone that — I do think that I am attracted to men in positions of power and I also think that those types of men are attracted to me. ”Meanwhile, Kelce is happily engaged to Taylor Swift, with a wedding expected in the summer of 2026. But for Nicole, this chapter seems filled with confidence, travel, and a growing community that now appears louder with love than with criticism.Also Read: Alix Earle’s two-year romance with NFL receiver Braxton Berrios collapses unexpectedly after her Dancing With the Stars run","Kayla Nicole sparked a wave of reactions after sharing swimsuit photos from her Antigua getaway.

Influencer Alix Earle splits with NFL’s Braxton Berrios as fans question what triggered the sudden end



Alix Earle has left her partner on the dance floor, marking the end of a relationship that once seemed to thrive even under relentless public attention. Multiple outlets report that the Hot Mess podcast host has parted ways with Houston Texans wide receiver Braxton Berrios, a year after they confirmed their romance in October 2023. The news arrives after weeks of speculation, silence and scattered hints that something had shifted between them.The breakup follows a season of questions during her time on Dancing With the Stars, where viewers noticed Braxton’s absence from the live shows. Alix shut down early rumors in November when a fan commented, “Ugh I hope u and Braxton are still together,” and she responded, “He couldn’t come bc of football.” His support came through a video aired during the November 25 finale, where he said, “I've watched you pour everything into this since the moment it has started, and I think it shows. Good luck. Have fun, babe.”The couple often opened up about the strain of long distance, and Alix shared how much she leaned on him during the competition. “I had a breakdown to Braxton the other night,” she told E! News. “I was like, ‘Braxton, I don't think I can be sexy.I don't know what to do. I need you to help me.’” She added, “He’s so supportive. I FaceTime him every day and every chance I get. He’s always supportive and I’m there to support him too. ”But finishing second on the show brought new distance. She stayed in Los Angeles instead of joining him for games, while he focused on the Texans’ season. Reports later suggested the two struggled to navigate their schedules. One source told US Weekly the “majority of their relationship was long-distance and it was hard for them to navigate.”Another insider told the Daily Mail that Alix “has not been happy with the direction their relationship is going in,” adding that they even spent Thanksgiving apart.

The Richest Players in NFL History Will Shock You

Aaron Rodgers – 200 million dollars

Kirk Cousins – about 180 million dollars

Russell Wilson – 165 million dollars

Matthew Stafford – 150 million dollars

The NFL has grown into a financial powerhouse where players turn their on-field success into long-term business wins. Many stars earn far beyond their salaries through smart investments, brand deals, and ventures that keep paying even after retirement. Their financial journeys show how discipline, strategy, and timing can redefine an athlete’s legacy.This list dives straight into the league’s wealthiest names and how they built their fortunes. From record-setting quarterbacks to players who mastered the business world early, each story proves that money in football comes from far more than trophies. These athletes combined talent with opportunity and turned their careers into thriving financial empires.Tom Brady may have retired in 2023, but his financial reach continues to grow. Celebrity Net Worth places him at 300 million dollars, a figure built on decades of elite play and smart business decisions. In 2022 alone, he earned 75 million dollars from salary and endorsements with Aston Martin, Under Armour, and TAG Heuer. After leading the New England Patriots for 19 seasons and winning a seventh Super Bowl with Tampa Bay, he expanded his empire through a deal with Fox Sports and his wellness company TB12.Brady’s choices show how a player can turn fame into a long-term business platform.Aaron Rodgers remains one of the most accomplished quarterbacks in the NFL and one of its sharpest earners. Celebrity Net Worth estimates his wealth at 200 million dollars. His three-year, 150 million dollar extension with the Green Bay Packers in 2022 made him the highest-paid quarterback at that time. He later signed a one-year deal with the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2025 worth an estimated 10 million dollars.

He also invests in tech startups and real estate and is a minority owner of the Milwaukee Bucks.Minnesota Vikings quarterback Kirk Cousins built his fortune through consistent play and a focus on guaranteed money.

Celebrity Net Worth estimates him at 165 million dollars. His endorsements include Nike, Bose, Amazon, and Mercedes-Benz. Wilson also invests actively, holding stakes in Seattle Sounders FC and his own clothing brand, Good Man Brand. Alongside his wife Ciara, he supports education and health initiatives through the Why Not You Foundation.Matthew Stafford helped deliver a Super Bowl win for the Los Angeles Rams in 2022 and strengthened his financial standing with a 160 million dollar contract extension the same year. The team restructured his deal in 2025 to guarantee more money for the upcoming seasons. With a net worth of 150 million dollars, he also profits from endorsements with Nike, Pepsi, and Ford. Stafford invests heavily in real estate, including a nearly 20 million dollar home in Los Angeles.

Gautam Gambhir Press Conference: Team India head coach heaves fire after 2-1 ODI series win over SA

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli has been in exceptional form, scoring 376 runs in his last four ODIs with two centuries and being dismissed only twice. After winning the Player of the Series award for his 302 runs in the three-match series against South Africa, Kohli said he felt liberated and in his best rhythm in years, contributing to India securing their 10th ODI series win out of the last 11 at home.His resurgence follows criticism after recording consecutive ducks in Australia. In the final ODI against South Africa, Kohli scored an unbeaten 65 off 45 balls as India chased down 271 in 39.5 overs.""Honestly, playing the way I have in the series is the most satisfying thing for me. I feel really free in my mind. I haven't played like this in 2-3 years. The whole game is coming together nicely. I've tried to maintain my own standards and make an impact. I know when I can bat like that in the middle, it helps the team a long way. Makes me confident, any situation in the middle, I can handle that and bring it in favour of the team,"" Kohli said.Reflecting on his long journey, the former India captain admitted there were moments of doubt.""When you play for that long - 15-16 years, you do doubt yourself. Especially as a batter when one mistake can get you out. It's a whole journey of self-improvement and personal growth along the way.It improves you as a person, and it improves your temperament as well. I'm just glad that I'm still able to contribute to the team,"" he shared.One standout feature of his recent form has been his six-hitting, with 12 sixes across the three matches and a strike rate above 100 in each outing.""When I play freely, I know I can hit sixes. There are always levels you can always unlock,"" Kohli said about his approach.Kohli, who holds the world record with 53 ODI centuries, rated his 135 in Ranchi as his best knock of the series.""The first one at Ranchi - because I hadn't played a game since Australia. Just how your energy is on the day, Ranchi is very special for me, and I'm very grateful for how these three games have gone,"" he said.Speaking about India stepping up in the deciding match, Kohli highlighted the team’s hunger in pressure moments.""It's always brought the best of us - that's what we want to play for. When it's 1-1, we want to do something special for the team. That's why we have played for the team for so long. Just happy that both of us continue to do it for so long,"" he concluded.","Virat Kohli has been in exceptional form, scoring 376 runs in his last four ODIs with two centuries and being dismissed only twice.

Fans say this unexpected team up turned into a crossover that truly felt like it was meant to happen

Freddie Freeman and Ryan Reynolds ended up creating one of the most unexpectedly heartwarming and funny internet moments of the week. Their visit to the SickKids Foundation in Toronto began as a simple charity appearance but quickly turned into something far more memorable. In a video shared online, Reynolds narrates while Freeman walks in to greet young patients. His friendly “Hey Kids. It’s me Freddie Freeman” was instantly met with the kind of sharp honesty kids are famous for. One replied “what a loser,” another chimed in with “trust me man, we know who you are,” and a playful soft toy toss sent him packing with a dramatic “get out of here.” Instead of being polished, the clip worked because it felt awkward, real, and funny, showing a star athlete willingly taking the jokes in stride.The chemistry between Reynolds and Freeman lifted the moment even more. Fans joked that Reynolds sounded like someone narrating a group assignment after zero sleep, echoing one popular comment saying he talked “like he just survived a group project with zero sleep.” The way Reynolds let the kids drive the humor and Freeman embraced the roast made the exchange feel unscripted and refreshing. Viewers kept replaying the clip not for perfection but for personality.Many admitted “I watched at least 15 times,” proving how replay value often lies in relatable chaos rather than scripted hero shots.What surprised audiences most was how naturally the duo fit into the setting. One fan captured the mood saying “Wild crossover but feels like it was meant to happen.” Reynolds, known for his Canadian roots and charity work, blended well with Freeman’s easygoing presence. Comments like “Amazing to see them using their platforms for something so important” showed how people appreciated the mix of humour and genuine effort. The visit, while entertaining, also served its purpose by drawing attention to the hospital’s cause.Once the bites hit X, replies flowed fast. People quoted their favourite moments, laughed at the insults, and applauded Freeman’s ability to take it on the chin. One fan praised him saying “One kid actually threw a heater high and inside. Thanks for being a good sport for @sickkids, Freddie.” These reactions helped lift the clip beyond sports or celebrity circles. It turned into a talking point because it let kids be themselves and let celebrities be human.Also read: Freddie Freeman’s wife Chelsea shares a heartfelt anniversary message as the couple celebrate 11 years together","Freddie Freeman and Ryan Reynolds made an unexpected team up during a visit to the SickKids Foundation in Toronto.

Ryan Kesler’s new criminal case details and court ruling





Former NHL star Ryan Kesler, a two-time U.S. Olympian and longtime Vancouver Canucks standout, is once again in the spotlight. And, this time, due to a major legal development. The case against him, involving two misdemeanor counts of fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct, has officially been ordered to proceed to trial on Thursday.According to the criminal complaint, the alleged incident occurred on January 1 in Orchard Lake, Michigan. Kesler is accused of having sexual contact with a 16-year-old who was reportedly a friend of his daughter. The complaint further states that the actions involved force or coercion or that Kesler knew the victim was physically helpless.This new update follows a preliminary examination in which District Judge Marc Barron ruled that prosecutors had established sufficient probable cause. The charges stem from allegations filed on October 23, 2025, to which Kesler, now 41, pleaded not guilty. The decision marks a significant shift in the ongoing legal process. This is at the same time, intensifying public and league attention.The details outlined in the complaint have fueled widespread discussion, especially given Kesler’s high-profile status as a former Vancouver Canucks alternate captain and key figure of the mid-2000s and 2010s NHL landscape. His career included multiple 20-goal seasons. Along with a Selke Trophy win, and a memorable run to the 2011 Stanley Cup Final.The latest ruling ensures the case will now advance toward a full trial, where both sides will present arguments, testimony.Also Read: NHL Update: Brad Marchand and his family hosts Thanksgiving to comfort teammates missing home","Ryan Kesler's criminal case has officially been ordered to proceed to trial on Thursday.

Chiefs’ third-down woes exposed as Bolton calls for accountability

'Attack December & Earn It' - Chiefs vs. Texans Preview w/ Nick Bolton | Defending the Kingdom

The Kansas City Chiefs are discovering the hard way that even the league’s most explosive offenses can’t outrun a defensive leak that keeps widening by the week. As the playoff race tightens, linebacker Nick Bolton has stepped into a leadership role, fueled by urgency. The Chiefs are to have their Week 14 showdown with the surging Houston Texans.Bolton recently sat down with Mitch Holthus and Matt McMullen, using the moment to send a clear message to defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo. He warned that third-down failures are dragging the team out of contention. His push for immediate correction comes at a time when Kansas City’s postseason hopes have never looked more fragile in the Patrick Mahomes era.Bolton didn’t hold back when assessing the defense’s most pressing flaw. He said, “I think they (Texans) were seven for nine on third down. So we got to find a way to get that number down. We want around 30% or less,” emphasizing the need for coordinated rush-and-coverage execution and more disruptive early-down play.Kansas City’s Thanksgiving loss to the Dallas Cowboys painted the reality in brutal detail. The Cowboys converted 9 of 16 third downs, extending drives that bled momentum and exposed a defense struggling to finish.Meanwhile, the Chiefs managed only 5 of 13 third-down conversions, a stagger that undercut even Mahomes’ late-game magic.Bolton’s sense of urgency resonates because Houston thrives precisely where Kansas City falters. The Texans hit 6 of 13 third downs against the Colts and shut Indianapolis down to just 30%, a formula that fuels their four-game win streak and keeps them in striking distance of the AFC South lead.With 100 tackles in 12 games, Bolton has become the Chiefs’ most reliable defender, but he can’t fix the problem alone. Chris Jones’ uneven season, along with inconsistencies from Leo Chenal and Jaylen Watson, has stretched Spagnuolo’s unit thin at the worst possible time.At 37% playoff odds and trailing a dominant Denver squad, the Chiefs are entering must-win territory. Anything less than a defensive turnaround risks ending the Mahomes postseason streak and shattering the expectations of Chiefs Kingdom.Also read: Tyreek Hill reignites Super Bowl chemistry with Willie Gay Jr. after Chiefs snub LB for Nick Bolton deal","Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Nick Bolton has stepped into a leadership role, fueled by urgency.

Connor Bedard’s impactful play leads Chicago to much-needed road win



NHL Highlights | Blackhawks vs. Kings - December 4, 2025

Blackhawks’ team effort shines against Kings’ continued offensive struggles



Connor Bedard’s remarkable rise continued under the bright lights of Los Angeles, as the rookie phenom found the back of the net for the third straight game in the Chicago Blackhawks’ 2-1 win over the Kings on Thursday night. With Chicago striving to build consistency on the road, Bedard once again delivered the momentum-shifting play that set the tone early.His presence has transformed the Blackhawks’ offensive rhythm, and each outing seems to strengthen his claim as one of the NHL’s fastest-emerging stars. The 20-year-old is not just scoring, but he’s driving the pace, dictating chances, and elevating those around him, turning every shift into a threat for opposing defenses.Bedard opened the scoring at 6:17 of the second period, crashing the crease and sweeping home Tyler Bertuzzi’s centering pass just nine seconds into a power play. The goal extended his red-hot stretch to four goals and six points across his last three games. Over his past 19 outings, Bedard now has 32 points, a level of production that underscores his growing command of the NHL stage.Blackhawks coach Jeff Blashill didn’t shy away from acknowledging the significance of Bedard’s climb, emphasizing that this surge is more than a promising stretch.“I think he’s obviously taken that big, big step this year to that next level,” Blashill said. “This isn’t a good start to me. It is kind of what he is. We see it on a nightly basis. He does it different ways, gets opportunities different ways, and sets up a lot of guys too. ”Wyatt Kaiser added Chicago’s second goal, while rookie forward Frank Nazar chipped in two assists in another strong supporting effort. Spencer Knight delivered a composed performance in net, making 26 saves, including crucial stops during a tense final stretch when the Kings pushed with a 6-on-4 advantage after Bedard was called for hooking.For Los Angeles, Trevor Moore scored the lone goal and Darcy Kuemper stood tall with 34 saves, but the offensive issues persisted. The Kings have now scored two or fewer goals in six of their past eight contests, a slump that forward Warren Foegele admitted has weighed on the group.The teams will meet again on Saturday in Los Angeles, giving the Kings a quick chance to respond and giving Bedard another opportunity to extend a streak that’s rapidly shaping his rookie campaign into something special.Also Read: Capitals’ Alex Ovechkin and Ryan Leonard makes NHL history with age-defying multi-goal performance",The Chicago Blackhawks beat the Los Angeles Kings 2-1 on Thursday night.

Joseph Woll’s injury's impact on Maple Leafs at Hurricanes game



The Toronto Maple Leafs faced another difficult night as goaltender Joseph Woll exited their NHL match today against the Carolina Hurricanes after two periods due to a lower-body injury. The timing could not be worse for the team, especially considering their struggles in the NHL standings and the ongoing pressure to regain stability in the Atlantic Division.Woll’s departure came without much warning, and head coach Craig Berube offered no detailed update postgame. By stating only that the team is still evaluating the extent of the injury. Fans are worried because of this lack of clarity. Especially given Woll’s importance in recent games. Also, in his role in keeping the Maple Leafs competitive. Despite defensive inconsistencies.Backup goaltender Dennis Hildeby was thrust into action for the third period, stepping in admirably to help secure a hard-fought performance against the Hurricanes. While Hildeby managed the situation well, the reality remains that the Maple Leafs are now without both Joseph Woll and Anthony Stolarz, who has already been sidelined due to injury.With two key netminders out, Toronto’s depth will be tested heavily as they attempt to stay afloat.This situation also raises questions about potential NHL trade rumors. As the Maple Leafs may be forced to explore emergency backup options or short-term moves. All depending on how long Woll and Stolarz remain unavailable.The injury concerns overshadow what was otherwise an important outing for the Maple Leafs, who continue searching for consistency. With their goaltending core depleted, every upcoming NHL match preview will revolve around who gets the nod in net and whether the team can remain competitive under the circumstances.For now, Toronto can only hope that Woll’s injury is not long-term; because without him and Stolarz, the road ahead becomes significantly more challenging.Also Read: NHL Update: Brad Marchand and his family hosts Thanksgiving to comfort teammates missing home","Goaltender Joseph Woll left the game after two periods due to a lower-body injury.

Connor McDavid talks Oilers’ offensive bounce-back against Kraken





POST-RAW | Connor McDavid 12.04.25

Edmonton Oilers’ star Connor McDavid expressed relief and optimism after the team displayed a potent offensive performance against the Seattle Kraken, scoring nine goals in a dominant display. After a challenging start to the season, this game offered a glimpse of the scoring rhythm that helped the Oilers reach back-to-back Western Conference finals. McDavid’s comments highlight both individual and team confidence returning at a crucial stage of the campaign.The Oilers improved to a 12-11-5 record with the victory, sitting just outside the Western Conference wild card playoff spots. For a team that has struggled to consistently replicate its playoff form, Thursday’s win provides a much-needed morale boost and underscores the offensive potential McDavid has consistently delivered throughout his career.During his media session, McDavid acknowledged the team’s offensive struggles this season but praised the collective performance against the Kraken. “Yeah, I feel like we haven’t really had that all year,” he said. “Feels good to get a couple as a group, and hopefully guys are feeling good about themselves and we can build on it.”Edmonton’s ability to score in bunches was on full display, with McDavid himself noting the uniqueness of the performance.He compared the moment to his first career hat trick in Dallas, emphasizing both the excitement and rarity of such an offensive surge. “You guys might think I’m crazy, but the only one I can remember like that would have been my first hattrick goal in Dallas. Definitely a unique one,” McDavid explained.Consistency will be key for the Oilers as they aim to climb the standings and secure a playoff berth. With McDavid leading the charge, Edmonton has the offensive firepower to challenge any Western Conference team. Analysts and fans alike will be watching closely to see if the Oilers can sustain this momentum and return to the form that made them one of the league’s top contenders in recent seasons.Thursday’s 9-goal performance not only boosts confidence but also sends a message to opponents that when the Oilers’ offense is clicking, they remain a formidable force. For Edmonton, the focus now shifts to maintaining this level of play as the season progresses, with Connor McDavid at the center of their scoring efforts.Also Read: Connor Bedard extends goal streak as Blackhawks secure 2-1 win over Kings: Coach Jeff Blashill praises rookie’s “big step” forward","Edmonton Oilers beat Seattle Kraken 9-0.

Shannon Sharpe explains his blunt message to Odell Beckham Jr. on Nightcap Podcast

Shannon Sharpe has sparked a loud money debate after reacting to Odell Beckham Jr. ’s recent comments about finances in the NFL . The former Denver Broncos star spoke honestly after rumors spread online that Beckham may have sold his game-worn cleats for $50,000. While the sale itself has not been confirmed, the timing brought fresh attention to Beckham’s views on athlete money struggles.The discussion began when older clips from The Pivot Podcast resurfaced on social media. In the interview, Odell Beckham Jr. explained how big contracts do not mean as much as fans think once taxes and daily expenses come into play. Those words divided opinion. Some fans understood his point. Others felt he was out of touch.As the clips went viral again, Shannon Sharpe stepped in with a strong response. Speaking on his Nightcap Podcast, Shannon Sharpe shared his own experience and broke down the numbers in a clear way. His message was simple. With smart planning, most players should not struggle after earning millions.During his appearance on The Pivot Podcast in October, Odell Beckham Jr. spoke openly about money pressure in the NFL.“I’ve always explained this to people, bro: you give somebody a five-year, $100 million contract, what is it really?” Beckham said. “It’s five years for 60. You’re getting taxed. Do the math; that’s 12 a year that you have to spend, use, save, invest, flaunt, whatever.”He continued by explaining why spending rises fast for star players.“I’mma buy a car. I’mma give my momma a house. Everything costs money,” Beckham said. “But we weren’t taught about no financial literacy. We weren’t taught this skill.”As those clips spread again online, reports and rumors claimed Beckham sold game-worn cleats for $50,000. Soon after, Shannon Sharpe shared his take on the matter while hosting Nightcap Podcast with Chad “Ochocinco” Johnson.Sharpe focused on investment basics and long-term thinking.“If you bring home $60 million liquid theoretically, you put that in a fund, you gonna get 5 to 8%,” Sharpe said. “There’ll be some years you get 10, 12%. So even if you’re just getting 5% on $60 million, that’s $3 million a year, man.”He then delivered his blunt conclusion.“If you can’t live off $3 million a year, you got issues,” Sharpe said.Not everyone criticized Odell Beckham. Comedian Mike Epps offered support while speaking to TMZ.“Sometimes, you can’t measure lifestyle with money,” Epps said. He also added advice, saying, “So, you gotta make sure you control the lifestyle, and then your money will be controlled with it.”Odell Beckham Jr.’s last NFL contract was with the Miami Dolphins, reportedly worth $3 million. The deal ended by mutual agreement in December 2024, and Beckham remains a free agent.Also Read: “This Is Deeply Ironic”: Tom Brady Gets Roasted During The World Cup Draw After Surprising Gisele Bündchen Connection Goes Viral","Odell Beckham Jr. spoke openly about money pressure in the NFL on The Pivot Podcast.

"“He knows not what he is doing”: Tammy, Russell Wilson’s mother, torches Trevone Boykin over ‘weird’ Thanksgiving story",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/he-knows-not-what-he-is-doing-tammy-russell-wilsons-mother-torches-trevone-boykin-over-weird-thanksgiving-story/articleshow/125806772.cms,"Tammy Wilson defends Russell Wilson after Trevone Boykin’s resurfaced Thanksgiving story draws new criticism. (Image via Getty Images)

Tammy Wilson calls out Trevone Boykin and clears up the Thanksgiving timeline

Russell Wilson’s rough Giants year, his family legacy, and why this clapback landed

Russell Wilson is having one of the toughest seasons of his career with the New York Giants, and somehow his Thanksgiving guest list ended up on the internet too. Former teammate Trevone Boykin recently went on a podcast and called a holiday dinner at Wilson’s house “weird” because the quarterback’s family was not there, which quickly turned into another round of think-pieces about Wilson’s personality and home life.This time, Wilson did not have to say anything. His mother, Tammy Wilson, logged on instead. In a string of viral comments on social media, she shut down Boykin’s version of events, defended her son, and reminded everyone that the Wilson family is not hurting for money or history.Boykin’s story has been making the rounds since late November. On his podcast appearance, he described a Thanksgiving at Wilson and Ciara’s home as the “weirdest feeling,” said the dinner was catered, and highlighted that none of Wilson’s family was there. He added that if he had Wilson’s money and airline connections, he would have flown everyone in.Once the clip hit social media, a familiar script followed. People questioned whether Wilson was close to his family and used a nine-year-old holiday to paint a picture of him as distant or out of touch.Tammy Wilson stepped into the comments and made it clear she was done watching strangers and former teammates dissect her son. In a comment captured by outlets like The Shade Room and others, she wrote:“I am his mom. It is none of your business. This is opportunistic I am so tired of you men cutting down my son.Jesus said, to all accusing the woman, ‘he who is without sin cast the 1st stone.’ Part of our family was in Fla at a tournament. I stayed planned to stay home bc I wanted to fast the 4 days before year end. Russ thought enough of you, who has a criminal history, to love you enough to invite you over. This why Russ keeps it moving. Folks not trustworthy. Russ though will forgive, but not again. I hope you felt relevant for a few minutes. Lord forgive him for he know not what he is doing.”Then she went back and added one more line that turned into a meme on its own: “and we got our own money.”Separate reporting has also clarified what Boykin left out. The Thanksgiving he was talking about was not from this season. The dinner was from 2016, when the Wilson family was in Florida supporting Anna Wilson and Stanford women’s basketball at a holiday tournament. Tammy’s explanation matches that timeline and helps explain why much of the family was not at the house that night.Boykin has his own off-field history, including past domestic assault allegations that ended his time with the Seattle Seahawks. Seattle released him in 2018.Tammy did not spell that out in a press conference. She did it in a comment box, directly under a post about her son, and made it clear that inviting him into their home was an act of grace that will not be repeated.All of this is happening while Russell Wilson is already under a microscope on the field. The Giants are 2-11 heading into their Week 14 bye, and Wilson has slid down the depth chart to QB3 behind starter Jaxson Dart and backup Jameis Winston. His future as a starting quarterback is already in question, and he has even dipped his toe into broadcasting with a guest spot on “The NFL Today” earlier this season.Off the field, he is in a different kind of headline. Wilson and Ciara just listed their Rancho Santa Fe estate in California for $54.9 million, a price that could set a residential record in San Diego County if they get anywhere near the ask. The couple bought the nine-acre property for $14.5 million in 2021 and turned it into “Amor Estate,” a 30,000-square-foot Mediterranean compound with a private football field, recording studio, full gym, and a long list of luxury amenities.That is the backdrop for Tammy’s final flex about having their “own money.” It is not a random brag. It ties back to a family that has stacked degrees, leadership roles, and real estate for decades. Her late husband, Harrison Wilson III, built his own path in law and sports. Russell’s grandfather, Dr. Harrison B. Wilson Jr., spent 22 years as president of Norfolk State University.So when Boykin implies that the absence of extended relatives at one catered Thanksgiving says something about Russell’s character or his relationship with his family, Tammy is not just defending a quarterback. She is defending a legacy and pushing back on a narrative that has followed her son for most of his career, where every story about him being “different” or “corny” becomes an easy punchline.The public reaction shows why her post hit so hard. Fans on social media quickly shifted from dissecting Wilson’s dinner menu to praising his mother for speaking plainly, quoting her lines back to each other, and calling out Boykin for talking about a private invite years after the fact.There is no scheme or film breakdown here. It is simple. Wilson opened his doors, Boykin went public with his opinion about the vibe, and Tammy Wilson decided that would be the last time someone tried to get clicks by dragging her son’s name into a holiday story.If there is a takeaway from this week, it is that Russell Wilson might be QB3 in New York right now, but his mother is still first-team when it comes to pass protection online.","Trevone Boykin said a Thanksgiving dinner at Russell Wilson's house was 'weird' because his family was not there.

Pete Alonso and Kyle Schwarber seen as Boston’s strongest chance to upgrade the offense

Pete Alonso and Kyle Schwarber are now the two main power hitters the Boston Red Sox are looking at for this offseason. This comes after the Red Sox were knocked out by the New York Yankees in the postseason last month in New York. The team wants strong bats, and these two names are seen as the best way to fix the middle of the order, according to The Athletic reporter Jen McCaffrey, who wrote this in a detailed report published in late November 2025.Boston already added Sonny Gray and Johan Oviedo to help the pitching staff, but the club still needs a hitter who can bring steady power every day. The Red Sox lost Rafael Devers before last season in a trade, and Alex Bregman chose free agency this month. Because of that, the front office believes a strong hitter in the heart of the lineup is now the top need.Jen McCaffrey wrote that Pete Alonso and Kyle Schwarber “represent the best opportunity to upgrade the offense,” and the Red Sox front office agrees with that view.Alonso, who played first base for the New York Mets last season, is known for long home runs and steady run production.He becomes one of the top power bats on the market this winter.Published during the last week of November 2025, just before the start of the winter meetings, the report was made public.Having played for the Philadelphia Phillies in 2025, Kyle Schwarber hit 56 home runs last year. He is free to sign a long-term contract having earlier this month rejected the Phillies' qualifying offer in Philadelphia.Many MLB insiders predict he will sign a roughly five-year, $145 million deal.Having played in Boston in years past as well, Schwarber knows Fenway Park and how hitters adapt to the wall in left field.At the GM meetings this month, Red Sox chief baseball officer Craig Breslow told journalists and verified that the team is striving for a potent middle-order bat.Breslow said, “Someone who is a threat who can hit in the middle of the order and can lengthen our lineup is something we want to pursue.”His comments came during his on-record session with reporters, held at the annual meetings in Arizona earlier this month.These moves matter because Boston needs instant power. Both Alonso and Schwarber can change a game with one swing.If the Red Sox land even one of them, the lineup becomes much harder to pitch to, especially in tight games or late innings.Also Read: MLB Trade Rumors: Toronto Blue Jays Eying Kyle Tucker This Week As Pete Alonso Becomes A Key Red Sox Move","Pete Alonso and Kyle Schwarber seen as Boston’s strongest chance to upgrade the offense.

Khamzat Chimaev, Pavel Durov and what comes next for ‘Borz’

Khamzat Chimaev posted on X this week asking Telegram founder Pavel Durov to be in his corner for his next fight. The message came while Chimaev is off the fight list for a foot surgery and a planned recovery that will stretch into and after Ramadan 2026.Khamzat Chimaev said he wants a big name with him when he steps back into the Octagon. The post read in part, “Brother @durov in my corner next …” and the invite quickly made headlines across MMA sites and social feeds. Promoters and media now watch to see if Durov, the billionaire Telegram CEO will accept.Khamzat Chimaev is injured and will have a small operation on his foot, sources say. He told reporters he will pause full training until after Ramadan.That timing means he likely will not fight until late March or April 2026, depending on recovery. While he heals, Chimaev has named Nassourdine Imavov as a possible next challenger and has also answered calls for a superfight with Alex Pereira.Chimaev’s public invite to Pavel Durov adds a new twist. Durov is a tech billionaire (listed at about $17.1 billion by some outlets) and he has recently worked with former fighters like Khabib Nurmagomedov on Telegram projects.Khabib sold digital papakha collectibles on Telegram and helped raise roughly $4–4.5 million in November 2025, showing how the platform can link fighters and rich backers. That history makes Durov a logical target for Chimaev’s request.There is also history between Chimaev and Team Khabib. The two sides had a near-brawl after UFC 280 in Abu Dhabi in October 2022 when Chimaev pushed Abubakar Nurmagomedov.Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov and Khabib later helped calm things down. Recently, Chimaev posted a message praising Islam Makhachev and showing he wants peace with the Dagestani group.That all makes a Durov cornering moment possible, since Khabib and Durov have worked together before.Chimaev’s X post and the reports appeared in late November to early December 2025.His surgery and plan to resume full training after Ramadan were reported during the same period by MMA outlets covering UFC offseason news.If recovery goes well, Khamzat Chimaev’s comeback fight could happen in spring or early summer 2026.Also Read: Joe Rogan Claims Jesus May Come Back As Artificial Intelligence And Sends Social Media Into Debate","Khamzat Chimaev is injured and will have a small operation on his foot.

Shilo Sanders’ bankruptcy scandal intensifies: NFL star accused of hiding $250K in NIL earnings as attorney slams flawed claims,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/shilo-sanders-bankruptcy-scandal-intensifies-nfl-star-accused-of-hiding-250k-in-nil-earnings-as-attorney-slams-flawed-claims/articleshow/125792687.cms,"Shilo Sanders faces $250K NIL transfer dispute amid bankruptcy case (Image via: Getty Images)

Shilo Sanders’ NFL career and bankruptcy case raise questions about NIL earnings





Shilo Sanders, the NFL free agent and son of legendary coach Deion Sanders, is at the center of a growing financial and legal storm. The former Colorado safety, who recently filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, is now accused of making unauthorized transfers totaling $250,000. The controversy revolves around money earned from his college football name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals, raising questions about compliance with bankruptcy law.The dispute has attracted significant media attention, as Shilo Sanders’ attorney strongly challenges the claims. Keri Riley, representing Sanders, insists the allegations are fundamentally flawed and argues that the funds in question were legitimately earned after the bankruptcy filing. According to Riley, the earnings, processed through companies created by Sanders, Big 21 LLC and Headache Gang LLC, should not be considered part of the bankruptcy estate.The trustee handling Sanders’ bankruptcy case claims the NFL player improperly transferred funds post-petition, potentially violating federal bankruptcy rules. These transfers, linked to Sanders’ NIL income during and after college, are now under legal review.Riley maintains that the money was generated legitimately and was separate from any pre-bankruptcy liabilities, emphasizing that Sanders’ NIL agreements are a modern revenue source increasingly used by college athletes.Adding complexity, Sanders faces a longstanding financial obligation stemming from a 2015 lawsuit. A former high school security guard in Dallas alleged Sanders caused injuries during an incident, and a default judgment of nearly $12 million was awarded. While Sanders filed for bankruptcy to manage this liability, the current allegations over NIL transfers complicate his path to financial resolution.Despite off-field challenges, Sanders briefly joined the Tampa Bay Buccaneers as an undrafted free agent. Reports indicate he signed a three-year contract worth roughly $2.97 million, although he earned just $1,572 in guaranteed money after being released during the preseason.

Conor McGregor and James Lawrence denied appeal as Nikita Hand responds

Nikita Hand has spoken out after the Supreme Court in Dublin refused to hear the appeals of Conor McGregor and James Lawrence in her long-running civil case. The decision was announced on Thursday, when the court confirmed that both men would not be allowed to challenge earlier rulings made in the High Court. The civil case began after an incident that took place in December 2018 at a hotel in south Dublin.Last year, Nikita Hand, also known as Nikita Ní Laimhín won her civil action and was awarded nearly €250,000 in damages. She also received a ruling that Conor McGregor must cover about €1.3 million in legal costs. After Thursday’s update, Hand posted on social media, saying she is relieved that this part of the process is over and grateful for the support she received throughout the case.The Supreme Court ruling came on Thursday morning in Dublin. The judges stated that Conor McGregor “had a fair hearing” during the original trial and found no reason to allow his appeal.McGregor’s appeal request focused on questions he was asked in court about his “no comment” answers during a Garda interview.The court looked at that claim and rejected it, stating the trial judge acted within legal rules. James Lawrence, who was also part of the original case, was not found liable for assault by the jury in the civil trial.However, the trial judge had ruled that Nikita Hand did not have to pay his legal costs. Lawrence appealed that decision, but the Supreme Court judges also rejected his request, saying the lower court followed “well-established principles.”After the ruling, Nikita Hand shared a short message online. She wrote that she was “thankful this step is now closed” and that she hopes to continue moving forward.Her message was posted shortly after news outlets in Dublin published the decision. In the High Court Nikita Hand received €214,994 in damages last year at the termination of the original case.In December 2018 at a hotel in south Dublin, the event central of the case took place.During the civil case, the jury heard extensive evidence; the ultimate decision demanded McGregor to pay the damages as well as about €1.3 million in legal expenses.The Supreme Court's ruling marks the most recent update in a years-long case.

Kansas City Chiefs fans are buzzing online after a surprising message from Jason Kelce revealed a new nickname for his younger brother, Travis Kelce. The moment came shortly after Travis was announced as the Chiefs’ nominee for the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year award, adding another milestone to a long list of career achievements.Instead of a traditional congratulatory note, Jason Kelce took to X and wrote, “Congrats Taviola.” The unexpected nickname instantly caught fans’ attention. Within minutes, replies poured in, turning “Taviola” into yet another viral moment surrounding the star tight end.“Add “Traviola” the list of nicknames 😆 not sure what it means but I’m sure it’s just a big brother being a big brother” one user wrote. Another added, “Taviola, future hall of fame.” Many fans admitted they had never heard the term before, which only added to the excitement and curiosity.Nicknames are nothing new to Travis Kelce. Over the years, they have become part of his larger-than-life public identity, especially with the rise of the New Heights podcast hosted by the Kelce brothers.One of his earliest nicknames, “Big Yeti,” came from his college days at the University of Cincinnati. Jason once said it was his favorite nickname for Travis because teammates used it to describe his size and athleticism on the basketball court.More recently, another name entered the mix when Taylor Swift appeared on the New Heights podcast in August. Swift referred to Kelce as “The Human Exclamation Point,” a term inspired by his energetic and positive personality. The phrase quickly caught on among fans and even Jason joked that it had replaced “Big Yeti” as his top pick.Swift had also earlier described Kelce on her Eras Tour as “the guy on the Chiefs,” which sparked its own round of memes and fan reactions online.With Thursday’s message, “Taviola” now joins the growing collection, though its origin remains unknown.The buzz around the new nickname also comes at a time when Travis Kelce has become increasingly vocal and open about his relationship with Taylor Swift. On recent podcast episodes, he has shared stories from their private travels, including a romantic getaway to Lake Como and small glimpses into their day-to-day life.Fans have also noticed Kelce frequently wearing Swift-themed outfits, from album-inspired crewnecks to subtle tour references. These small gestures have become popular talking points online, with many calling it proof of the strong bond between the NFL star and the Grammy-winning artist.Whether the nickname “Taviola” ties into that relationship or belongs to a deeper family history remains a mystery, but for Chiefs fans, it’s already the newest part of the Travis Kelce legend.","Jason Kelce revealed a new nickname for his younger brother, Travis Kelce.

Jayden Daniels ’ QB status remains key focus for Commanders ahead of Week 14 against Vikings



The Washington Commanders have faced a challenging 2025 season, struggling with injuries and inconsistent play as they sit at 3-9. Last week, backup quarterback Marcus Mariota stepped in during a narrow 27-26 overtime loss to the Denver Broncos, delivering a solid performance against a top-tier defense. Despite Mariota’s efforts, the team’s offense has lacked stability and consistent leadership throughout the season.Washington’s quarterback situation has been a key storyline, with injuries impacting performance and game planning. The team has struggled to maintain consistency and rhythm without a healthy starter under center. Jayden Daniels ’ health is critical for the Commanders’ offensive cohesion and execution moving forward.Commanders head coach Dan Quinn confirmed that Jayden Daniels will start Sunday’s Week 14 matchup against the Minnesota Vikings, according to NFL insider Adam Schefter. Daniels had been sidelined due to an elbow injury suffered in Week 9 against the Seattle Seahawks and also missed games earlier in the season after a tough Week 2 loss to the Green Bay Packers. His return marks a key moment for Washington as the team looks to regain stability at the quarterback position.Daniels returned briefly on October 5 in a 27-10 win over the Los Angeles Chargers, but recurring injuries have limited his playing time this season. His return is expected to strengthen Washington’s passing attack and improve communication with the offensive line and receivers. His presence under center is expected to bring stability to Washington’s offense, improving timing, reads, and overall execution in the passing game.Despite the team’s 3-9 record, Daniels’ leadership and ability to manage high-pressure situations remain crucial to the Commanders’ offensive strategy. Maintaining a healthy and consistent presence at quarterback will be crucial for the team’s offensive development and game planning. Reestablishing a consistent quarterback presence is critical as Washington looks to optimize its offensive efficiency in the final stretch of the season.Sunday’s matchup against the Minnesota Vikings provides Daniels an opportunity to reassert himself as the team’s primary quarterback and lead the Commanders’ offense effectively through the remaining games of the 2025 season.Also Read: Omarion Hampton injury update: NFL insider Matt Zenitz shares key insight on Chargers RB for Week 14",Washington Commanders head coach Dan Quinn confirmed that Jayden Daniels will start Sunday’s Week 14 matchup against the Minnesota Vikings.

George Pickens fires back at Richard Sherman’s harsh effort criticism after Cowboys’ Week 14 loss to Lions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/george-pickens-fires-back-at-richard-shermans-harsh-effort-criticism-after-cowboys-week-14-loss-to-lions/articleshow/125795543.cms,"George Pickens responds to Richard Sherman’s criticism (Image via: Getty Images)

George Pickens’ deleted rant raises more questions about effort and Cowboys’ performance





George Pickens’ behavior adds pressure on Dallas’ roster evaluations





George Pickens found himself at the center of discussion after former NFL cornerback and current Prime Video analyst Richard Sherman publicly questioned the wide receiver’s effort during the Dallas Cowboys’ Week 14 loss to the Detroit Lions. Sherman’s critique came during his film breakdown, where he pointed out several plays in which Pickens appeared to ease up on routes and showed minimal urgency late in the game.Pickens responded hours later with a strongly worded message on social media, which was deleted shortly after posting but widely circulated through screenshots. The response added a new layer to the Cowboys’ ongoing scrutiny, shifting attention away from the game itself and placing Pickens’ conduct and accountability under the microscope.Sherman’s assessment was direct. He stated that George Pickens looked “uninterested” and stressed that players seeking to establish themselves among the league’s top receivers cannot afford to disengage when circumstances aren’t favorable. His comments aligned with visible moments from the game in which Pickens showed limited effort when running routes, regardless of coverage.Pickens countered by accusing Sherman of isolating one player in a team-driven sport, while also criticizing the former cornerback’s credibility.He referenced coverages and double teams as reasons for limited production, but his response did not address the central point about effort. Instead, the remarks intensified the discussion surrounding his consistency and on-field demeanor.The situation extends beyond a single performance. Questions about Pickens’ maturity and response to criticism have followed him since his time in Pittsburgh, and this latest exchange adds to a pattern the Cowboys have monitored since his arrival. With long-term decisions approaching in the coming seasons, composure and professionalism factor heavily into a player’s evaluation, especially at a position where reliability is essential.This latest incident could influence how the Cowboys approach Pickens’ contract and role in the offense moving forward.Rather than diffusing the conversation, Pickens’ reaction has expanded it, bringing renewed attention to elements of his game that have drawn scrutiny in the past. For Dallas, the episode represents an unnecessary distraction at a time when stability and execution remain priorities.Also Read: Trey Benson’s Week 14 update raises concern: Cardinals coach Jonathan Gannon addresses running back’s knee injury",George Pickens responded to criticism from former NFL cornerback Richard Sherman.

Lakers’ new medical update reveals LeBron James is battling left foot arthritis along with right-side sciatica

Okay, this Lakers update on LeBron James is not the kind of December news fans wanted. While everyone was debating rotations and trade rumors, the team quietly dropped a medical bombshell: LeBron has been battling left foot joint arthritis in addition to the right-side sciatica that already had fans stressed out. Suddenly, his questionable mobility and those random grimaces make way more sense. And now, he's officially doubtful for the Lakers vs. Celtics showdown, turning what was supposed to be a blockbuster matchup into a major injury storyline.The Lakers have confirmed that LeBron James isn’t just dealing with the sciatica flare-ups that recently became public, he’s also been managing left foot joint arthritis throughout the season. Arthritis in the foot can be tricky for any athlete, but when you’re 39, carrying massive usage, and expected to anchor both ends of the floor, it’s a different battle entirely.This latest update explains why LeBron has had moments this season where he looked slightly limited on drives or settled for jumpers instead of attacking the paint. Fans had theories, but the Lakers’ announcement finally puts everything into perspective.The Lakers–Celtics matchup is always highlighted on the NBA calendar but now the purple and gold might be without their biggest weapon. According to the team, LeBron James is doubtful to play, making this one of the most unpredictable rivalry games in recent memory.For the Lakers, losing LeBron for even one game impacts everything from playmaking to spacing tempo, and their late-game offense. With the team still trying to build consistency, his absence forces players like Anthony Davis, Austin Reaves, and D’Angelo Russell to step into expanded roles against one of the best squads in the league.Left foot arthritis doesn’t just go away, it needs management, rest, and strategic minutes. Combine that with right-side sciatica, and you're talking about a veteran superstar who’s essentially playing through constant discomfort.The concern now is sustainability. The Lakers rely heavily on LeBron, but the medical reality suggests the team might soon have to prioritize long-term health over big-game appearances. Minutes reductions, staggered rest nights, and tighter rotations may all be on the way.LeBron James playing through foot arthritis and sciatica makes his season even more impressive but also raises serious concerns about load management going forward.And now, with his status against the Celtics officially in doubt, the Lakers must figure out how to survive without the one player they rely on the most.Also read - “Kobe Bryant wasn’t a good person”: Alleged childhood friend says Lakers legend wasn’t generous to family or friends",Lakers’ new medical update reveals LeBron James is battling left foot arthritis along with right-side sciatica.

At the near end of the game between the Santa Clara Broncos and the Utah Tech Trailblazers, an altercation between two opposition players became the highlight of the night.

Whether the Utah Tech player will face a suspension after this is not yet clear.With 1:18 minutes remaining in the game between the Santa Clara Broncos and the Utah Tech Trailblazers, which took place at the Leavey Center in Santa Clara on December 4, things got a little out of hand. Trailblazers Chance Trujillo got posterized by Broncos forward Allen Graves, and the latter decided to take matters into his own hands by punching the other.Graves' one-handed dunk, especially over Trujillo, who tried and failed to block the Broncos player, triggered the Utah Tech player so much that he decided to punch the other for his boldness.Graves was celebrating his dunk and bumped into Trujillo, and the other decided to take out his frustrations by punching him, especially after that humiliation.Both players - Trujillo as well as Graves, were handed technical fouls by the referee because of the altercation, although things were stopped by other Broncos players before Graves could retaliate. There has been no information on whether Trujillo will face a suspension after the incident. The home team ended up with the win by the final whistle, 90-80, and is currently on an 8-1 run, set to face New Mexico on the road next.Also Read: LeBron James gets nostalgic with clips from members of “Fab Five” visiting St. Vincent-St. Mary High School going viral","Utah Tech's Chance Trujillo was seen punching a player from Santa Clara after he got dunked on.

Gautam Gambhir Press Conference: Team India head coach heaves fire after 2-1 ODI series win over SA

""We missed a special chance""

""Chance to learn from RoKo""

NEW DELHI: South Africa head coach Shukri Conrad acknowledged on Saturday that using the word ""grovel"" overshadowed his team’s historic Test win over India, though he reiterated there was no “malice” behind it. Conrad made the remark after day four of the second Test in Guwahati when South Africa were dominating, but the term — carrying racial undertones in cricket history — sparked strong reactions.“I think on reflection, it was never my intention to cause any malice or not be humble about anything. How could I have chosen a better word on reflection? Yeah, I could have been smarter,” Conrad said after the third ODI.“It (the word) left it open to people putting their own context to it, where the only context I ever intended it to be was for India to spend a lot of time and make it really tough for them,” he added.Conrad said he will now be more mindful of language used in public spaces.“I'm going to be careful what word I use here now, because context would be attached to that as well. It's really a pity. Maybe what it did do was to spice up the ODI series, especially with them winning that now, the T20 series becomes even more so.”He admitted the controversy diverted attention from South Africa’s first Test series win over India in 25 years.“The unfortunate thing is, with all the noise that word caused, I don't think it's a perfectly good English word, but like I said, it just left it open to too many interpretations.“What it did was take away the gloss of what was a really special win for our Test team. It's unfortunate, but like I said, there was definitely no malice intended.”Conrad added that humility remains central to the team’s culture.“Being humble is a cornerstone of our Test team and all our teams for that matter. It's unfortunate that the noise and the talk became around the coach.“People shouldn't even know who the coach is. It should be about the players. That's the unfortunate bit and I'd like to think that it's going to be put to bed now,” he said.Conrad also expressed regret that South Africa couldn’t secure another series win over India at home after claiming the Test victory.“Yes, we had a chance to do something really special,"" he said.""I think the last time India lost both the Test and ODI series goes back to the 1990s. We missed out on that opportunity. But look, they're a world-class side with world-class players.“When Rohit (Sharma) is in this type of form, you cannot afford to yield your game. But like I said, part of this is building towards 2027, the World Cup in South Africa. I'd like to think that a few things are starting to fall into place with that. A lot of experience built in you,” he noted. Virat Kohli finished the ODI contest as Player of the Series with two centuries and a fifty, while Rohit Sharma also contributed with two half-centuries. Conrad said watching them was a learning experience for his young squad.“Therein lies the learnings for us, for our young batters to see what the world's best does, i.e. Virat and Rohit, how they go about their business. And I'd like to think that we will take that learning with us and then grow from there, especially our younger batters,” he said.Conrad admitted South Africa fell short with the bat in the final ODI.“I'd like to think that we were a little bit short with the bat. We started off really well with the ball, but because we didn't post a score big enough, the Indian opening batters didn't have to take any risks and they put us under pressure.“But I think we let ourselves down with the bat. We needed to post something a lot more competitive to put India under pressure. But, such are the margins when two equally matched teams are up against each other, (and) when one team is slightly off,” he said.Finally, Conrad and the team manager confirmed that Tony de Zorzi will miss the upcoming T20I series after suffering a hamstring injury during the second ODI in Raipur.“He was out earlier today, so he was out of the T20 series as well. Yeah, it's really tough. Obviously, we were, I guess I should use the term hamstrung. But we were hamstrung by Tony's injury,” they said.","South Africa head coach Shukri Conrad admits using the word ""grovel"" overshadowed his team’s historic Test win over India.
