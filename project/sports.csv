NEW DELHI: England, the defending champions, are set to face a challenging match against the USA in their final Super 8 encounter at the T20 World Cup . The English team will be relying on their power hitters to secure a significant victory and maintain their chances of reaching the semifinals. In their previous match against South Africa, England 's batters struggled to deliver the necessary big hits while pursuing a target of 164, resulting in a close seven-run defeat.The group dynamics have shifted following West Indies' resounding nine-wicket triumph over the USA, leaving England with the task of achieving a substantial win to improve their net run-rate, which could prove crucial in the end. Currently, South Africa leads Group 2 with two victories, while both West Indies and England have one win and one loss each, with the former having a superior NRR.To remain in contention for the semifinals, England must defeat the USA by either a margin of 10 runs or with at least an over to spare. The outcome of the match between South Africa and West Indies will also have implications for England's chances. If South Africa loses, even in a Super Over, they will be eliminated from the race, provided England accomplishes their objective. However, if South Africa wins and England loses to the USA, it will result in a three-way tie between West Indies, England, and the USA for the second spot, with the team possessing the better run-rate advancing to the knockout stage.England's batting lineup has showcased its prowess in recent matches, with Phil Salt being in exceptional form, having scored two centuries, a fifty, and three thirties in his last 10 T20Is. However, his early dismissal against South Africa hindered England's explosive start, and Jos Buttler and Jonny Bairstow were unable to unleash their big-hitting abilities. Despite the loss, England's batting remains a formidable force that the likes of Saurabh Netravalkar and Harmeet Singh will find challenging to contain.In the bowling department, Adil Rashid and Jofra Archer have been England's standout performers, claiming 13 and 12 wickets respectively. However, Mark Wood's recent form is a concern, as he has only managed to take three wickets in his last five T20Is.For the co-hosts USA, the tournament has been a reality check following their impressive performance in the group stage. They have suffered consecutive losses, and their chances of reaching the semifinals are slim, relying on a miraculous combination of results. The USA would need to defeat England by a margin of 80 runs and hope that South Africa beats West Indies by more than 67 runs to qualify for the semifinals based on NRR.Andries Gous and Aaron Jones have been the key contributors in the USA's batting lineup, but they will require support from the entire team to overcome the defending champions. Jones has been leading the side in the absence of skipper Monank Patel since their match against Pakistan.England (ENG) and the United States (US) are set to face each other in the ninth match of the Super Eights in the T20 World Cup 2024 at the Kensington Oval in Bridgetown, Barbados.This will mark the first-ever T20I encounter between England and USA.The Sir Vivian Richards Stadium has offered a lively wicket, particularly during the group stages, favoring pacers who can extract bounce from the surface. Batters will need to exercise caution in the initial phase of their innings before attempting to take on the bowlers.The Kensington Oval Stadium, set to host matches for the T20 World Cup 2024, has some interesting ground stats. Out of the 7 matches played, 3 were won by the team batting first, 2 by the team batting second, 1 was decided in a Super Over, and 1 ended with no result. The average first innings total is 156, while the second innings average hasn't been specified. The highest total recorded at this venue is 194/4 by South Africa against the USA, and the lowest is 47 all out by Oman against England.For fantasy cricket players, the pitch report suggests that batting will be easiest when the ball is new and hard, making the powerplay overs particularly productive for runs. Therefore, selecting the top three batters from both teams could be advantageous. Bowlers who can hit hard lengths and use variations effectively are also expected to perform well on this pitch.), the English opener, has been in fine form throughout the tournament, amassing 158 runs in 6 matches. He will aim to maintain his momentum and stands as a reliable choice for fantasy teams., the young middle-order batter, has showcased his ability to score runs under pressure, accumulating 120 runs in 3 innings. Brook's consistent performances make him a valuable addition to fantasy lineups., the English pacer, has been in decent form, claiming 9 wickets in 6 matches. Given the nature of the wicket, Archer's skills could prove highly effective, making him an excellent pick for fantasy contests.Jos Buttler (c), Moeen Ali, Jofra Archer, Jonathan Bairstow, Harry Brook, Sam Curran, Ben Duckett, Tom Hartley, Will Jacks, Chris Jordan, Liam Livingstone, Adil Rashid, Phil Salt, Reece Topley and Mark Wood.Monank Patel (c), Aaron Jones, Andries Gous, Corey Anderson, Ali Khan, Harmeet Singh, Jessy Singh, Milind Kumar, Nisarg Patel, Nitish Kumar, Noshtush Kenjige, Saurabh Nethralvakar, Shadley Van Schalkwyk, Steven Taylor, Shayan Jahangir.

NEW DELHI: India captain Rohit Sharma is famous for speaking in his typical Mumbaiya style on the field and more often than not his words are caught on the stump mic.It was in the Test series against England earlier this year that his hilarious ""Jo bhi garden mein ghoomega…"" had the internet rolling with laughter.Another of Rohit's 'precious gems' was caught on the stump mic during the India-Bangladesh Super 8 clash on Saturday.The incident occurred in the 14th over of the Bangladesh run chase when Kuldeep Yadav had just dismissed Shakib Al Hasan after being hit for a six.The new batsman Mahmudullah was foxed by a Kuldeep googly first ball that just missed the top of his off-stump.Kuldeep then seemed to have asked for a change in the fielding placements.To this, Rohit, who had walked upto wicket-keeper Rishabh Pant , replied, """" (What's it, let him play across the line, he has just come to the crease after a dismissal, let him play across the line).Rohit walked back to his fielding spot nonchalantly to his fielding spot and Mahmudullah then flicked the next ball to deep mid-wicket for a single.Kuldeep took 3/19 as India beat Bangladesh by 50 runs riding on Hardik Pandya 's all-round heroics.India next play Australia on Monday in their last Super Eights clash.",Rohit Sharma's words caught on the stump mic during India-Bangladesh Super 8 clash.

NEW DELHI: After going unbeaten in the Group A matches of the 2024 Men’s T20 World Cup in the USA, Team India is set to begin its Super Eights campaign in the Caribbean. They will face Afghanistan at the Kensington Oval on Thursday. India's earlier matches were affected by the batting-unfriendly pitches in New York, but now, a change in conditions means possible adjustments in their lineup.In New York, conditions favored fast bowlers, causing someone like Kuldeep Yadav to miss out on playing in the Group A games. With the tournament shifting to the West Indies, there is a possibility that the team might include an extra spinner like Kuldeep Yadav, who offers different variety and control compared to Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel.The Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) has already announced India's 15-member squad for the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024, which is being held in the West Indies and USA starting from June 1.

Led by the experienced Rohit Sharma, the team includes established batsmen likeVirat Kohli , as well as dynamic all-rounders such as Hardik Pandya and Ravindra Jadeja.Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shivam Dube bring youthful energy to the batting lineup while Surya Kumar Yadav's 360 degree game play adds another dimension to the team's batting line up. Rishabh Pant and Sanju Samson will handle wicketkeeping duties. The spin department boasts strength with Kuldeep Yadav, Axar Patel, and Yuzvendra Chahal ready to confound opponents.The fast bowling unit, spearheaded by the deadly Jasprit Bumrah, includes Arshdeep Singh and Mohammed Siraj, ensuring a formidable pace attack.The reserve players, Shubman Gill, Rinku Singh, Khaleel Ahmed, and Avesh Khan, offer robust backups, prepared to step in when needed.The team is both well-prepared and highly motivated, with a clear aim to bring the trophy back to India.

NEW DELHI: As the T20 World Cup 2024 Super Eight stage concludes, Group 2 is tightly contested with England, West Indies, and South Africa vying for two semi-final spots . The USA, while still in contention, faces a tough task to stay in the race. The upcoming matches between England vs USA and West Indies vs South Africa will be crucial in determining the semi-finalists.If England and West Indies win, all three teams (England, West Indies, and South Africa) will be tied on four points each. The West Indies are in a strong position due to their superior net run rate (NRR) and recent form against the USA. A win over South Africa will see them through to the semi-finals. England's qualification, however, depends on NRR. They need to win by a margin that ensures they have a superior NRR to South Africa's. For example, if they win by 10 runs, they will advance even if South Africa loses in a Super Over. If the winning margin is less than 10 runs, South Africa will go through on NRR.If USA and South Africa win, South Africa will top the table with six points, leaving England, West Indies, and USA stranded at two points each. In this scenario, England's chances hinge on minimizing their losing margin. If they lose in a Super Over after chasing 160, West Indies will need to lose by at least 43 runs to fall below England on NRR. A larger margin of defeat for England would give West Indies more room to maneuver, likely resulting in South Africa and West Indies claiming the semi-final berths. The USA, burdened by a poor NRR, require a Herculean effort: they must defeat England by at least 56 runs and hope West Indies succumb by 91 runs or more to keep their faint hopes alive.If USA and West Indies win, South Africa and West Indies will advance with four points each, effectively ending the semi-final ambitions of England and USA. In this straightforward scenario, a victory for USA and West Indies would eliminate both England and USA from the semi-final race.If England and South Africa win, South Africa will top the group with six points, and England will secure the second semi-final spot with four points, eliminating the West Indies and USA. This straightforward outcome sees South Africa and England advancing without the need for NRR calculations.The group is finely poised, and each match will have significant implications on the semi-final lineup.","England, West Indies, and South Africa vying for two semi-final spots.

Green was sent out of the ring, allowing Michin and The EST to have an exchange. The match lasted only a couple of minutes before another commercial break, so a significant portion of the action was missed. With no allies in the ring or at ringside to assist with cheating, the fight remained competitive throughout. Green stole the win by throwing Belair out of the ring and pinning Yim after a KOD.In the match between Orton, Hayes, and Tonga, Hayes and Tonga teamed up to strike Orton and take him out of the ring. They worked hard to subdue Orton, but the Viper retaliated with suplexes on both Hayes and Tonga on the announce table. Just as Orton gained the upper hand, Tanga Loa interfered, distracting Orton. Kevin Owens quickly intervened, taking down Tanga Loa, and the distraction allowed Hayes to roll up Orton for a surprising victory.During Kevin Owens' entrance for the next MITB qualifying match, Loa and Tonga attacked him on the ramp. However, Orton swiftly intervened with a steel chair to fend them off. Despite being half-injured, Owens managed to enter the ring. The match was thrilling, with all the competitors performing exceptionally well, especially Andrade. In the end, Andrade secured the victory by executing his El Idolo finisher on Waller.The main event showcased a one-on-one match between Cody Rhodes and Solo Sikoa.

Following this, Orton and Owens rushed to the ring to assist Rhodes.Together, they managed to take down The Bloodline. But then, Sikoa suddenly started laughing. Moments later, Jacob Fatu attacked from behind, taking everyone out with superkicks. The entire arena was in shock, standing in awe of the carnage Fatu caused. He assaulted Cody like a madman and single-handedly took down Orton and Owens.Solo watched as the newest member of The Bloodline utterly destroyed everyone. Fatu finished by taking out Rhodes with a top rope splash through the announce table.

GROUP 2

With the race to the T20 World Cup semifinals in Group 1 down to the last two matches, eyes are on all the permutations, combinations and qualification scenarios on offer, with all four teams still in with a chance to make it to the knockout stage of the tounament.But besides the performances of the players and the teams, one other factor that always remains in the mix is the weather.In the first of the crucial last two remaining matches in Group 1, it will be India vs Australia on Monday at the Daren Sammy National Cricket Stadium in Gros Islet , St Lucia.The skies above the stadium are forecast to remain mostly cloudy through the duration of the game that is scheduled for a 10:30 am (local time) start, which is 8 pm in India.According to accuweather.com, Monday morning in St Lucia will be ""partly sunny"" but with ""a thunderstorm in parts of the area"" besides being ""windy"" with a cloud cover of 85%.

Then, if Afghanistan (2 points, NRR -0.650) go on to beat Bangladesh (0 point, NRR -2.489) in the last match of the 'Super 8s', the Afghans will join India as the two semifinalists from Group 1.If the game happens to end in a no-result because of a washout, then Australia will end up with three points. The reigning ODI champions will then want the Afghanistan vs Bangladesh match to be either washed out or end in a win for Bangladesh.In case both the games don't produce any result, Australia will edge Afghanistan on NRR, while a defeat against Bangladesh will leave the Afghans exiting the tournament with two points as opposed to Australia's three.Defending champions England are the only team so far to have made it to the semifinals from Group 2, where the winner in the match between West Indies and South Africa will join England in the knockouts.","India play Australia in the first of the last two T20 World Cup matches on Monday.

ST LUCIA: The small island, with the Caribbean Sea on one side and the Atlantic Ocean on the other, is absolutely buzzing. For the last couple of days --cricket tourists --mostly Indians from the US and Canada --have been trooping in for an extended weekend, and once the Saturday night theatre happened in St Vincent, the excitement has gone up manifold.Australia's defeat to Afghanistan has suddenly opened up the possibility for the Indian fans who are here and those across the world to finally get their redemption. The defeat to the Aussies in the ODI World Cup final in Ahmedabad in November is something no one related to Indian cricket has forgotten, and now it's a chance to pay the Aussies back with interest. A win on Monday for India will not only officially seal for them a semis berth, but also show Australia the door, provided Afghanistan beat Bangladesh later on Monday.The Indian team, that came in here late on Saturday night and cancelled their practice session on Sunday owing to exhaustion and the extreme humidity in this part of the world, would also surely be licking their lips.On current form, there's absolutely no reason why India wouldn't beat their biggest rivals Australia, making their own journey forward a little smoother. India apart, there is no other team than Australia which has so many individual match-winners who can destroy opposition on their day. If they can be taken care of before the semis,Rohit Sharma 's boys would probably have to just carry on playing the way they are and this cup would be theirs.The Darren Sammy International Stadium, the venue of this game, though has been slightly different from most other venues across the Caribbean. Scores have fluctuated between 180-220, barring the last game between South Africa and England, which the Proteas won with 163. Normally the ball does come on to the bat here which should be a bit of a relief for Aussies, who were absolutely strangled by the Afghanistan bowlers on the super slow St Vincent track.Australia had chosen to drop Mitchell Starc and add left-arm spinner Ashton Agar in the playing XI on Saturday. Even though Agar was extremely economical (0/17), there was no denying that Starc's explosive ability to run through opposition in Powerplay was missed.Aussies will be tempted to bring Starc back for this huge game, even though the average economy rate of spinners in St Lucia is 7.9 in the five matches played, which is significantly better than it is for the pacers (9.4).Captain Mitchell Marsh knows it, but he also knows that if they are to make a match of it against a marauding India, they will first have to deal with the mental scars of a defeat like this in a turnaround time of mere 36 hours.""First things first, we have to recover. We have a lot of belief in our group because we know we are a good cricket team. We had an off night but I guess there's also a positive in the fact that in 36 hours we go again. It's a big game --a must-win. I think if you look back at the short history of this team, I know for a fact that it brings out the best in our guys, so the boys will certainly be up and about for it,"" Marsh put up a brave face on Saturday night.For India, it's way more straightforward. Every constituent part of the Indian machine has been running smoothly and it's about keeping it going. No change is expected in the playing XI and with Jasprit Bumrah in outstanding form, one can hope the threat of Travis Head upfront will be taken care of. The explosive left-hander has caused enough heart-burns for India across formats, but he is coming off a failure against Afghanistan.Everything points to a perfect day for Team India and its fans, it's just about Rohit and his boys to maintain the composure that they have shown in the World Cup so far.",India take on Australia in World Cup quarter-final on Monday. India lost to Aussies in ODI World Cup final in Ahmedabad in November. A win for India will see them through to semis. Australia will be looking to bounce back from defeat to Afghanistan.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111217521,imgsize-69056,width-400,resizemode-4/111217521.jpg"

This result continued Germany's strong form as they progress to the last-16 stage.The Swiss team had taken the lead in the first half through a goal by forward Dan Ndoye, threatening to upset the home crowd. However, Germany, who had already guaranteed their place in the knockout rounds before the match began, persevered and maintained their seven-game unbeaten streak dating back to November. Fuellkrug's header finally brought the equaliser, much to the relief of the German supporters.Germany had a goal disallowed and multiple penalty appeals turned down by the Italian referee, Daniele Orsato. Despite the frustration, the home side continued to press forward, attempting 18 shots on goal in a highly charged atmosphere at the stadium in Frankfurt.The draw prevented Switzerland from securing what would have been only their second victory over Germany in 22 competitive matches since 1959. However, the Swiss team's progression to the last-16 is also assured.With seven points from their three group matches, Germany sit atop the standings, holding a two-point lead over Switzerland. Meanwhile, Hungary, who have three points, must await the results of other groups to determine if they will progress as one of the best third-placed teams, following their 1-0 victory over the eliminated Scotland, who finished with one point.""Of course, we would have liked to win the game and to play greatfootball ,"" Germany captain Ilkay Gundogan said. ""But I think you also need games like that during a tournament. And that can also be a real strength for the next games, hopefully.""Germany believed they had taken the lead in the 17th minute when Robert Andrich's long-range effort from 30 yards out surprisingly beat Switzerland's goalkeeper Yann Sommer at his near post. However, Sommer's embarrassment was alleviated when the goal was disallowed due to a foul committed by Jamal Musiala.Contrary to expectations, it was Switzerland who found the back of the net just before the 30-minute mark. Musiala was dispossessed in midfield, and when Remo Freuler received the ball on the left side of the penalty area, his low cross was emphatically converted into the roof of the net by Ndoye.Germany, playing on their home turf, created a plethora of opportunities as they dominated possession in the Swiss half. However, after Kai Havertz squandered several chances, it was Fuellkrug who rose above the defense to head in David Raum's cross in the 92nd minute, ensuring that Germany maintained their unbeaten record in their home championship.""I think when you see the Germans celebrating, we can be proud of ourselves,"" Swiss captain Granit Xhaka told SRF. ""It's not easy against a team like that. Nevertheless, the late equaliser hurts.""Everyone fought for each other and ran for each other. We have to push ourselves to the limit. Then we can beat anyone. We have taken the first step and are now looking forward to the round of 16.""Julian Nagelsmann, the coach of Germany, selected an unchanged starting lineup for the third consecutive match. However, he will need to make at least one alteration for the round of 16 due to Jonathan Tah receiving his second yellow card of the group stage, resulting in a suspension.It is uncertain if Havertz's performance was sufficient to secure his place in the starting eleven. Germany appeared more menacing when Fuellkrug was introduced, and he proceeded to score his 13th goal for the national team in his 19th appearance, despite only starting six of those matches.",Germany secure top spot in Group A of Euro 2024 with 1-1 draw against Switzerland. Niclas Fuellkrug scores crucial equaliser in stoppage time. Germany had already guaranteed their place in knockout rounds before the match began.

ST LUCIA: If there's one bowler whose non-inclusion in the India playing XI in the New York leg of the T20 World Cup was slightly criticized in different quarters, it is Kuldeep Yadav .The chinaman bowler has been India's best spinner across formats in recent times, still the Indian team management was waiting to employ him in slightly more favourable conditions for spinners than what it was at New York. But as the coaches kept explaining Kuldeep the situation, the wrist-spinner didn't lose heart and he delivered the moment he got his chance in West Indies Performances of 2-32 against Afghanistan and 3-19 against Bangladesh have proved how well-prepared in his mind Kuldeep was. The bowler mentioned that he ""would have loved to bowl in New York"", but he felt totally included in everything that was going on. ""I wasn't playing, but I was the 12th man there. I was helping out the teammates and carrying the drinks, so that is more like playing. I didn't bowl there but I would have loved to because it was more like pitches in Australia,"" Kuldeep said after India's comprehensive win against Bangladesh.It was in the West Indies that Kuldeep made his T20 debut back in 2017. He had a fair idea of what to expect in the Caribbean that helped. ""I knew the condition very well --the length to bowl and the importance of varying the pace. It was perfect for the spinners to come here and bowl,"" Kuldeep added.The left-armer explained how he doesn't think much about the conditions, which way the wind is blowing and all that when he comes into bowl. For him, it is more about the length and outthinking the batsman. ""I didn't think about the wind, just the length mattered. And obviously reading the batter and what they are expecting from me. It is about just reading one step ahead what the batters are thinking and reacting to it,"" Kuldeep said.It was evident that he was outsmarting the batters when he got Tanzid Hasan with a beautiful googly as the right-hander shaped to go to his back-foot. As for Towhid Hridoy , the mode of dismissal was the same, just that the ball turned in the opposite direction after landing in the same spot.Kuldeep plays his IPL cricket for Delhi Capitals , whose home ground is Ferozeshah Kotla , which isn't the easiest venue for a spinner. Coming from there, the T20 World Cup was a welcome relief for Kuldeep.""IPL is totally different, what you experience in IPL is what you are experiencing in the T20 World Cup are not the same…For me, wherever I play, it is about being more aggressive. That actually helped me in the IPL and it is helping me here as well,"" Kuldeep said, hoping to keep it going against Australia in their last Super-8 game on Monday.","Kuldeep Yadav has been India's best spinner across formats in recent times.

The decision to play a high-risk shot, especially when Pant possesses a wide array of conventional shots, was the crux of the frustration.""The man who has so many good shots in the front of the wicket in his repertoire should try and avoid such a shot. Telling a player like Pant to show some patience would not be ideal, but maybe Kohli might try to tell him,"" he added.According to Manjrekar, while advising patience to a naturally aggressive player like Pant might not be the most practical approach, there could be an expectation for him to exercise better judgment in shot selection, particularly in crucial phases of the game.Despite Pant's dismissal and Kohli's subsequent frustration, India moved closer to a T20 World Cup semifinal berth with a commanding 50-run win over Bangladesh in a Super Eight match. All-rounder Hardik Pandya hit a 27-ball fifty, helping India post their highest score of the low-scoring tournament so far with 196 for 5 at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium.Bangladesh, struggling from the start, managed only 146 for 8 in response, suffering their second Group 1 defeat.

He emphasized that a captain should not differentiate between senior players like Rohit Sharma , who has led India across formats and won multiple IPL titles with MI, and the youngest member of the squad.""Look, first and foremost, treat Rohit Sharma and the youngest team, the youngest member of the dressing room exactly the same way. Absolutely exactly the same way. It is a tough job, but leaders are bound to take tough decisions and are bound to do difficult things as well. That is why you're the leader. Otherwise, you would end up becoming a follower, said the former Indian international.He further elaborated that true leadership stems from self-belief and courage, enabling a captain to establish a consistent and fair approach for all team members.He rejected the notion of different rules for different players, emphasizing that profiles and past achievements should not influence a leader's decisions.""And to do that, you need to have a lot of self-belief, a lot of courage as well. And that is for me the first and foremost quality of being a true leader because you're true to the entire squad or entire bunch of people sitting in that dressing room. You cannot have different rules and you cannot have different things for different individuals. Looking at the profile, you do not look at profiles when you want to become a leader. If you want to become a leader, profiles do not matter,"" added Gambhir.Gambhir's comments shed light on the importance of impartiality, fairness, and consistency in leadership roles within a team environment. However, it remains to be seen whether Gambhir's vision will be put into practice at the national level.",Former Indian cricketer Gautam Gambhir is reportedly closing in on joining the Indian men's cricket team as their new head coach. He has shared his insights into leadership and how captains should approach their roles. He emphasized that a captain should not differentiate between senior players like Rohit Sharma and the youngest.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111193960,imgsize-25440,width-400,resizemode-4/111193960.jpg"

In a viral video, Akram criticized the management for their lack of consistency and stability in leadership roles.""They replaced Babar with Shaheen as Pakistan captain.The latter lost one series and the chairman got changed during that phase. The newcomer asked to change the captain and got it done. This is just not on. People make fun of us in world cricket. They don't get it. If you have made (Shaheen) Afridi the captain, give him a year,"" said Akram.T20 World Cup : Schedule Akram further added that he and other former cricketers are fortunate to be away from Pakistan cricket, as it has become a source of constant criticism and politics.""They don't ask us. It's good that we are away from Pakistan cricket. It is a blessing in disguise because it is just criticism, politics,"" he added.The legendary fast bowler's comments come in the wake of Pakistan's early exit from the ongoing T20 World Cup after losses to the USA and India.Babar Azam had stepped down from his leadership role following Pakistan's disappointing performance in the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup last year, where they failed to reach the knockout stages. Shaheen Shah Afridi was appointed as the T20I captain, while Shan Masood took over the red-ball leadership after the ODI World Cup campaign in November.However, Afridi's tenure as captain was short-lived, as Pakistan managed to win only one game in a five-match T20I series against New Zealand. With the appointment of Mohsin Naqvi as the new PCB chairman, Babar Azam was reinstated as the white-ball captain.Former Pakistan speedster Shoaib Akhtar also questioned the decision to appoint Babar Azam as captain in the first place. ""Who made Babar Azam captain at first place? Who was the Einstein by the way? I need to know that guy. Did he actually qualify for the job or not?

Buttler, who had to leave IPL 2024 before the playoffs to represent England in a T20I series against Pakistan, expressed his opinion during a press conference ahead of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024.Buttler stated, ""It's my personal opinion that there shouldn't be any international cricket that clashes with the IPL. These games have been in the calendar for a long time, and leading into a World Cup, your No. 1 priority is playing for England and performing for England. I feel like this is the best preparation.""The comments sparked a debate on the Club Prairie Fire podcast, where Hafeez asked Michael Vaughan and Adam Gilchrist for their views. Vaughan supported Buttler's stance, acknowledging the growing significance of the IPL. He remarked, ""I actually agree with him. IPL has become so big, and the players are so well rewarded for participating.""Hafeez interrupted Vaughan by questioning whether it was fair for players to prioritize IPL over national duties. Vaughan responded, ""It is the nature of the beast in 2024. Whether it is absolutely morally right is a very good question. But I think IPL is so big now that it is very hard for international boards to compete with it.""Vaughan also noted the potential impact on the County Championship , with many players likely to miss matches due to IPL commitments. ""Pakistan Super League (PSL) will compete with IPL next year, which will be interesting. It will affect the English summer more than any other country because so many players will be involved in both tournaments,"" the former England skipper added.Adam Gilchrist echoed Vaughan's sentiments, pointing out that domestic cricket will inevitably be compromised due to IPL. He mentioned, ""Domestic cricket is going to be compromised within the more established cricketing nations. For instance, the Sheffield Shield final overlaps with the IPL, so players will have to make a choice.""Hafeez found Buttler's remarks surprising and emphasized the importance of national pride. He commented, ""To me, that was a shocking statement from the captain of England because representing your country is the biggest prize you play for. If you are compromising and saying that national pride should not be there due to the IPL contract, I think that's not right.""","Former Pakistan captain Mohammad Hafeez criticized England skipper Jos Buttler for his recent comments.

He expressed confidence in India's ability to overcome the Australian challenge, provided they execute their plans effectively.The match against Australia holds significant importance for India, as a victory would secure their position at the top of Group 1. However, a defeat could potentially see them overtaken by both Australia and Afghanistan, should the latter triumph over Bangladesh in the final Super Eights encounter.As the highly anticipated clash between the two cricketing powerhouses approaches, Mhambrey emphasized the crucial role that the ""implementation of plans"" will play against the formidable Australian side. India's journey to the T20 World Cup final is fraught with challenges, given the caliber of the opposition they are likely to face in the latter stages of the tournament.""We played them initially. Earlier, a lot of these guys have played against them. A lot of guys have played in the IPL. So, in terms of knowing of the game, the approach that is going to change has been similar in the past games that we played. I don't think it's going to change. I think it's all what we can do is really focus on the implementation of our plans,"" Mhambrey, as quoted by ANI, said in a pre-match press conference.""And the bottom line is execution. I think if you're as close to execution, you will win every game. So, it's not about what the other opponent's going to do yet. We know what kind of approach they come with. That's the way they played in the past as well. But I think the focus purely should be on, that's what we will focus on in execution. And if we're as close to our plans, I'm pretty sure that we're going to cross the other side.Kuldeep Yadav , who was absent from the league stage of the T20 World Cup due to the pacer-friendly pitches in New York, made his presence felt in the Super 8 matches held in the West Indies. The spinner claimed a total of five wickets in the matches against Afghanistan and Bangladesh, proving his worth to the team.When asked about Kuldeep's performances thus far, India's bowling coach Mhambrey was effusive in his praise for the wrist-spinner and said, ""He's always been a class bowler, he's always done well for us, always won games for us initially as well. But unfortunately, because of the kind of wickets that we played in the US, he couldn't get an opportunity, couldn't get a run. But good to see that he's come out the last two games, he's done well. This was fabulous. I think he really bowled well, used the conditions very well and yeah, good to see that he's got in the run.""India's selection of four spinners for the tournament caught many off guard. The decision has been met with skepticism from certain fans and former players who have expressed doubts about the strategy.When asked about the likelihood of deploying all four spinners in crucial knockout matches, Mhambrey stated that it would depend on the pitch conditions. He mentioned that if the wickets in the Caribbean continue to behave as they have been, the team management would consider fielding three spinners.""It all depends on what surface - I hope the surface won't be that spinner friendly I think going in yes three spinners, I think just add the balance but I'm not very sure all the other venues - in case, I'm saying I don't look like the surface is going to be that dry and going to turn so much but yeah if the surface is like that, there's a lot of wear and tear in the wicket yeah for a spinner if you think that's the best option you want to go and enter the game, you might as well go with it,"" Mhambrey said.","India's bowling coach Paras Mhambrey discusses the team's strategy for the upcoming knockout matches in the ICC T20 World Cup.

At the other end, Nitish Kumar capitalized on his opportunity, top-edging a delivery from Jofra Archer for six and hitting another maximum over long-on off Topley.Curran's introduction as the first change soon paid off, as Taylor was caught brilliantly by Moeen Ali at backward point, marking Curran's 50th wicket in T20 internationals. USA's skipper Aaron Jones quickly added a boundary through the third-man region, helping the team to 48 for two at the end of the powerplay.Rashid's entry into the attack was impactful, conceding only two runs in his first over. He delivered a beautiful googly in his next, bowling out Jones and curtailing the USA captain’s innings.Rashid then employed another effective googly to end Nitish's promising knock, who had hit two sixes and a four.

The goal came after a distressing incident involving Hungarian striker Barnabas Varga , who suffered a serious injury and had to be stretchered off the field.The Hungarian Football Federation provided an update shortly after the match, stating that Varga was in a ""stable condition"" and receiving treatment at a hospital in Stuttgart.The incident evoked painful memories of Christian Eriksen's collapse during Euro 2020, where Danish players formed a protective circle around him after he suffered a cardiac arrest on the pitch.Csoboth paid tribute to his injured teammate by holding up Varga's shirt during his goal celebration. The late winner kept Hungary's hopes alive in the tournament, as they continue to fight for a spot in the last 16 of Euro 2024.""Of course we were fighting for him in the remaining 15-20 minutes.

NEW DELHI: Cristiano Ronaldo faced on-field confrontations from four supporters seeking selfies during Portugal 's 3-0 win over Turkey in Dortmund's Westfalenstadion on Saturday, leading coach Roberto Martinez to express concerns over player safety.The incidents began in the 69th minute when a young fan evaded stewards, reaching Ronaldo, who posed for a selfie. The situation escalated when, in the final minutes, two more people attempted similar actions.Following the final whistle, another person managed to get close to the 39-year-old striker for a photograph. Security intervened as two additional people tried to confront Ronaldo as he walked off the field with his teammates.WATCH:“It is a concern,” Martinez was quoted as saying by AP after the game, “because today we were lucky that the intentions of the fans were good.”“We all love a fan that recognizes the big stars and the big icons in their minds. We all agree with that. But you can understand it was a very, very difficult moment — if those intentions are wrong, the players are exposed and we need to be careful with that. I don't think that should happen on a football pitch.”Martinez emphasized the importance of communicating to fans that such behavior is not acceptable.“It's not the right way, you’re not going to get anything out of it,” Martinez added. “And what you do is probably the measures get worse for the future.“It’s not good to get the players so exposed when you have people running on the pitch.”Ronaldo's teammate, Bernardo Silva , who also scored against Turkey, shared a different perspective on the matter.“It's just a bit annoying in terms of having to stop the game because a fan enters the pitch,” Silva said. “That’s the price you pay for being so recognized in the world of football.“In terms of feeling in danger, no. Not me personally.”The series of breaches highlighted vulnerabilities in stadium security and the need for stricter measures to protect players during games.","Cristiano Ronaldo faced on-field confrontations from four supporters seeking selfies during Portugal's 3-0 win over Turkey in Dortmund's Westfalenstadion on Saturday.

Euro 2024: Patrik Schick's goal secures 1-1 draw for Czech Republic against Georgia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/euro-2024-patrik-schicks-goal-secures-1-1-draw-for-czech-republic-against-georgia/articleshow/111194149.cms,"NEW DELHI: Patrik Schick 's chest-fired goal secured a 1-1 draw for the Czech Republic against Georgia in an engaging Euro 2024 Group F match on Saturday.Both teams find themselves in a challenging position, each with a point, awaiting the outcome of the Portugal-Turkey game. Georgia struck first with Georges Mikautadze's penalty, but Schick equalized in a match filled with action and drama in Hamburg.Georgia, debutants in the competition, showcased their progress under coach Willy Sagnol , who highlighted his players' disappointment at their opening defeat as a sign of their growth. The Georgian team put in a spirited performance to earn their first Euros point, guided by goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili's exceptional saves.Sagnol said his players' disappointment at their opening defeat showed how far his team has come, and they gave everything in Hamburg to earn their first Euros point.Mamardashvili played a pivotal role, making crucial saves early on, denying efforts from Adam Hlozek and Schick. Georgia's offensive efforts were rewarded just before halftime when Mikautadze converted a penalty, secured after a VAR review flagged a handball by Czech defender Robin Hranac.The game's momentum swung back in favor of the Czechs in the second half. Schick, who had already demonstrated his scoring prowess at Euro 2020, equalized with an improvised finish, chesting home a rebound off the post from Ondrej Lingr's header. This goal marked Schick as the Czech Republic's top scorer in Euros history, surpassing Milan Baros with six goals, but a calf injury forced him to leave the pitch midway through the second half.The Czech team, led by coach Ivan Hasek, had started strong, creating numerous chances. They were initially frustrated when VAR disallowed Hlozek's goal due to a handball, following a save by Mamardashvili that deflected back onto Hlozek’s face and arm. Czech right-back Vladimir Coufal received a booking for a foul on Georgia's standout player Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, who along with Mikautadze, had required medical attention before the match but both started.“He attempted to counter and was met with Coufal's challenge, resulting in a yellow card for the Czech defender,” observed reviewers of the game.Georgia also saw their penalty appeals for an incident involving Zuriko Davitashvili and Ladislav Krejci dismissed. Despite these setbacks, Georgia captained by Guram Kashia, managed to test the Czech defense, with Stanec making a brilliant first-half stoppage-time save before conceding the penalty kick.Czech fans experienced further tension as Krejci came close to scoring from another header, narrowly missing the target. The Czechs’ persistence nearly paid off, but they failed to capitalize on several opportunities.In an end-to-end encounter, Georgia showed impressive resolve. “Georgia's fans were in the majority…they began to roar every time Napoli winger Kvaratskhelia got the ball in opposition territory,” noted observers.The match concluded with a dramatic moment when Georgia had a golden opportunity to clinch victory. Substitute Saba Lobjanidze found himself in a prime position but fired over the bar amid a three-on-one break, leaving the match tied.This draw leaves both teams with a challenging road ahead in Euro 2024 Group F. With strong performances from both sides, they will be looking to build on this match in their subsequent fixtures. As the group progresses, the outcome of the upcoming Portugal-Turkey game may further shape their paths."," Patrik Schick's chest-fired goal secured a 1-1 draw for the Czech Republic against Georgia in an engaging Euro 2024 Group F match.
