During a drinks break in the 40th over of India's chase, KL Rahul spoke with Virat Kohli , appearing to encourage him to stay at the crease until the end. With India requiring 65 runs from 60 balls against Australia on Tuesday, KL Rahul took on the role of aggressor in this Champions Trophy semi-final in Dubai.Rahul quickly scored a four and a six in his next five deliveries to ease the pressure on Kohli. He then rotated the strike to Kohli when India needed 40 runs from 45 balls, with Kohli 16 runs away from his 52nd ODI century.Kohli, despite being in control throughout the chase, attempted an unnecessary slog sweep against Adam Zampa and was caught at long-on. This uncharacteristic dismissal visibly frustrated KL Rahul at the non-striker's end.""Main maar raha that naa (I was going after the bowling),"" Rahul told Kohli as he walked past him.In the dressing room, coach Gautam Gambhir was also left visibly upset and mumbled something to the support staff and players seated alongside him.After the match, KL Rahul revealed his conversation with Kohli. ""When I walked in and when I played 10-12 balls I told him that you're the batter that needs to go on and be there till the end. And let me try and hit or let me try and take one chance an over. Because like you said we only needed 6 runs and over. But 6 runs and over on that wicket seemed like 8-8.5. So, you had to take one chance and over, one boundary or one six,"" Rahul told Star Sports.""So, I told him that I will do that and why don't you just rotate the strike and be there because you're the set batter and it might be harder. If you get out another set batter comes it becomes a lot more harder. But yeah, he felt like it was in his range to hit and yeah he didn't time it well.""Rahul maintained his composure and finished unbeaten with 42 runs from 34 balls, securing the victory with a six in the 49th over's first ball. This win advanced India to their fifth Champions Trophy final. Hardik Pandya contributed with a quick 28 runs from 24 balls before his dismissal.Despite the one mistimed shot, Kohli's performance was exceptional. He formed a crucial 91-run partnership for the third wicket with Shreyas Iyer, who scored 45 runs, after the early dismissals of Rohit Sharma (28) and Shubman Gill (9).Although Australia were missing key players, India hadn't defeated them in ICC tournament knockouts since the 2011 World Cup quarterfinal.Kohli effectively handled leg-spinner Adam Zampa, who had previously troubled him. He utilised pull shots and drives between sweeper cover and mid-wicket for consistent scoring.After losing both Iyer and Axar Patel (27) in quick succession, Kohli reached his fifty in 53 balls. Glenn Maxwell dropped a catch when Kohli was on 51 off Cooper Connolly's bowling.Kohli's innings ended when India needed 40 runs to win, as he hit the ball to Ben Dwarshuis at long-on off Zampa's bowling.","Virat Kohli was 16 runs away from his 52nd ODI century.

However, the turnout for the subsequent matches has been very good. The ticket sales were around 95% (of the capacity). Maybe, some people didn’t turn up after buying the tickets! Today (March 2), there’s around a 93% turnout, and it will increase as the day wears on,” he said.Ahmed had emphasised that the pricing has been kept very competitive and the turnout during Ramadan has been very encouraging.""It's the second day of Ramadan, and the stadium is almost full.

Contract and consistency concerns surround Jeremy Swayman

Boston Bruins goaltender Jeremy Swayman has been facing criticism after a recent 1-0 loss to the Minnesota Wild, despite making 21 saves. Some fans have questioned his performance, pointing to his large contract and missed training camp as possible reasons for inconsistency. However, many Bruins supporters argue that blaming Swayman alone is unfair, as the team's struggles go beyond just goaltending, including defensive mistakes and a lack of offensive production.The Boston Bruins lost 1-0 to the Wild, with Frederick Gaudreau deflecting in the only goal. Jeremy Swayman made 21 saves, but Filip Gustavsson’s 28-save shutout sealed Boston’s defeat.The Bruins' fanbase is divided over Jeremy Swayman. Some critics believe he hasn’t lived up to his big contract, blaming his offseason choices and missed training camp for an inconsistent season. A Reddit user writes, “While I agree that some of the criticism of Swayman is just low-level knuckledraggin – you also have to acknowledge that he is NOT playing up to level, especially 8×8.25 mil level.”A fan argues Swayman’s $8.25M salary is too high, citing his missed camp and media appearances as selfish. They claim he’s too inconsistent for a full workload.Saying, which a fan notes, “The off-season antics. Parading himself on local podcasts and talking through his agent—like he was coming off a Stanley Cup win or multiple for that matter. Putting his ‘worth/value’ ahead of the team and missing camp—while leaders before him took pay cuts.”Many fans push back against blaming Swayman, arguing that Boston’s real problem is poor team performance. With weak defense and a struggling offense, swapping goalies wouldn’t fix everything. One fan calls out the criticism as “low IQ,” pointing out that hockey is a team sport and pinning it all on Swayman is unfair. While he may not be at his best, he can’t carry the team alone.“It is ASTOUNDING how much we are blaming Swayman for this season, like I know he hasn’t been the greatest but do you see the defense we have? And the offense is even worse! This subreddit is just an echo chamber of low IQ takes. This team is overall just terrible, and pinning the blame on one player of a TEAM SPORT is laughable.”Also Read: “He is a patriot, he loves Canada”: Ontario Premier Doug Ford defends Wayne Gretzky amid ongoing backlash over his connection with Donald Trump The debate over Swayman’s performance continues, but the bigger issue seems to be Boston’s overall struggles. While criticism is fair, expecting one player to solve all the team’s problems ignores the bigger picture.","The Boston Bruins lost 1-0 to the Minnesota Wild.

Sidney Crosby determined to lift Pittsburgh Penguins through struggles

Sidney Crosby shut down trade rumors , reaffirming his commitment to the Pittsburgh Penguins . Speculation grew after Colorado traded Mikko Rantanen, linking Crosby to the Avalanche, but he dismissed it, stating he can't control rumors and won’t address them repeatedly. For now, his focus remains on the Penguins.The Penguins have struggled this season, currently sitting near the bottom of the Eastern Conference and at risk of missing the playoffs for the third consecutive year. Despite this,Sidney Crosby remains focused on doing everything he can to help the team, stating that his priority is to perform at his best, be a good teammate, and help Pittsburgh through this difficult period.Aarif Deen, the go-to guy for all things #Avs over at @colhockeynow, hopped on X on March 4 lead some trade scoop. He shared,“Crosby was asked if he’s aware of how many people in Denver would love to see him and MacK play together after 4 Nations.” And Sidney, Cool as ever, shutting down the frenzy with a simple, “I’m sure there’s a lot of hypotheticals out there,” before finishing his press conference.Just when it seemed like the Crosby trade rumors were fading, the Penguins' PR team delivered a bombshell: “You’ll see them together again at the Olympics!” That one-liner instantly reignited excitement about a potential Sidney Crosby–Nathan MacKinnon reunion—not in Colorado, but on the international stage.Sidney Crosby and Nathan MacKinnon , both from Nova Scotia, share a deep bond as elite centers. While often rivals, they’ve trained together for years, pushing each other to excel. MacKinnon admires Crosby’s relentless drive, and their long-awaited team-up at the 4 Nations Face-Off was a dream come true for hockey fans.A sudden Crosby trade? Unlikely. NHL insider Darren Dreger says if Crosby ever leaves, it won’t be rushed—it’ll be on his terms, with a proper farewell. For now, he’s staying put.Sidney Crosby dismissed trade rumors after Carolina acquired Mikko Rantanen, stating he won’t entertain speculation.

Evander Kane Gets Brutally Trolled By Fans Amid Speculations Of Edmonton Oilers’ Trading Him



Evander Kane, the star player of the Edmonton Oilers , has been going through a pretty tough time both in his career and in his personal life. He is still recovering from his injury and the last time Evander Kane was seen on ice was in the 2023-24 season when he played 77 games for the Edmonton Oilers. As per Chris Johnston and Pierre LeBrun, Evander Kane’s team has been looking to trade him. But fans have a lot of different opinions on this issue.Recently, Sportsnet’s Elliotte Friedman reported that the star player has submitted a list of teams that he would accept a trade from. However, fans feel differently about the entire situation.A fan took to X and wrote, “Evander Kane is not a star. Someone with a career high of 57 points (mind you that was literally 13 years ago) is not a star lmao let’s be real here”, while another fan wrote, “Evander Kane is not making life easy for the Edmonton Oilers. No wonder they want him gone. Toxic personality.”A third fan wrote, “The Edmonton Oilers not upgrading on their TERRIBLE goaltending just so Evander Kane can play a few regular season games would be an awful decision, he hasnt been the same player since all of his injuries, had major surgeries & doesn't have great chemistry with McDavid & Draisaitl”.Another user wrote, “please trade evander kane holy f**k”. However, Evander Kane’s fans have continued to defend him against the haters.A fan wrote, “Oilers fans are sh*tting on Evander Kane but the dude is out in the community doing good for the city and the people here…”, while another fan wrote, “Unpopular opinion, but Evander Kane is not an a*shole or selfish for wanting to play hockey instead of sitting on the shelf. That's completely within his right to do, and he should want to play hockey”.Currently, Evander Kane has not responded to all the criticism he has received.

Pius Suter is unlikely to sign a new deal with the Canucks

An NHL insider has provided an update on negotiations between Pius Suter and the Vancouver Canucks , stating that Suter, a reliable bottom-six option for Rick Tocchet since signing a two-year contract in August 2023, may be coming to a close. Elliotte Friedman, an insider for Sportsnet, discussed the potential actions of each National Hockey League team before the trade deadline on Monday's ""32 Thoughts"" podcast.Vancouver Canucks forward Pius Suter, who will become a free agent, seems unlikely to sign a new deal with the club. Consequently, he has been one of the leading candidates to be traded ahead of the trade deadline. With his versatility and two-way game, a number of teams have shown interest in trading for him.The Canucks are presently in talks with the Dallas Stars for Suter, reports The Hockey News's Adam Kierszenblat. Negotiations between the teams have apparently been going on well, and it is possible a deal may soon be sealed. Any formal news, however, is likely to follow the conclusion of the Stars' game against the New Jersey Devils on Tuesday.Suter, who inked a deal with the Canucks in 2023, has been an asset depth forward, making contributions both offensively and defensively. It would give the Canucks some assets to push for the playoffs while giving the Stars some depth with a solid center. As negotiations are ongoing, everyone will be keeping an eye on if the two clubs could make it happen in the next few days.""Sources have indicated that the #Canucks and #TexasHockey are working on a deal for Pius Suter.

LeBron James' unbreakable legacy: 5 NBA milestones that could stand forever,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/lebron-james-unbreakable-legacy-5-nba-milestones-that-could-stand-forever/articleshow/118735993.cms,"Image via Getty Images

LeBron James’ legendary 21-year career has redefined basketball greatness. From becoming the NBA’s all-time scoring leader to averaging a triple-double in the Finals, his feats are a testament to dominance in every era. With modern players facing shorter careers and stricter rest rules, these milestones may stand forever. Here are five LeBron records that could defy time.1. Most Combined Points (Regular Season + Playoffs)LeBron has scored over 50,000 points in his NBA career when combining regular-season games (38,387 points as of 2023) and playoffs (8,023 points). He’s the only player to cross 45,000+ combined points. To break it, a player would need 20+ elite seasons without major injuries a nearly impossible task.2. Most Consecutive Games Scoring 10+ PointsLeBron scored at least 10 points in 1,068 straight games (from 2007 to 2021). This streak lasted 15 years and proves his unmatched consistency. No active player is even close—the next-best streak is 562 games by Kevin Durant.3. Youngest to Hit Major Scoring MilestonesLeBron was the youngest ever to reach 1,000, 10,000, 20,000, and 30,000 career points. For example, he hit 30,000 points at age 33—three years younger than Kobe Bryant. Today’s NBA rules prevent players from jumping straight from high school to the pros, making this record even safer.4. All-Time Regular Season Scoring LeaderIn 2023, LeBron broke Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s 39-year-old record to become the NBA’s all-time leading scorer (currently over 40,000 points). The next active player, Kevin Durant, trails by over 12,000 points. Catching LeBron would require averaging 25 points a game for 12+ seasons—a huge ask for anyone.5. Only NBA Finals Triple-Double AverageIn the 2017 Finals, LeBron averaged 33.6 points, 12 rebounds, and 10 assists per game—the only player to ever average a triple-double in the championship series. Even stars like Nikola Jokić or Luka Dončić, who excel in triple-doubles, haven’t matched this in the high-pressure Finals.Also read: LeBron James scales the historic peak of 50,000 points in NBA LeBron James’s records are more than numbers—they are narratives of excellence, endurance, and evolution. With each game, he redefines what is possible on the basketball court, setting a standard that may well stand unchallenged for generations to come.","LeBron James has scored over 50,000 points in his NBA career when combining regular-season games (38,387 points as of 2023) and playoffs (8,023 points) He’s the only player to cross 45,000+ combined points.

Hold onto your masks, wrestling fans, because the Mysterio family tree just got a little more… complicated. Like a plot twist from a Christopher Nolan flick, the lineage of lucha libre royalty is swirling with history, legacy, and enough drama to fill a season of Succession. We’re talking about Rey Misterio Sr. , the OG high-flyer, who sadly passed away on December 20, 2024, leaving behind a legacy that’s more tangled than a headphone cord in your pocket. But fear not, because we're here to unravel the mystery of the Mysterio/Misterio's.Think of Rey Misterio Sr. as the wrestling equivalent of a Jedi Master, laying the groundwork for a dynasty. He was throwing dropkicks and defying gravity long before Rey Mysterio Jr. was hitting the 619. Remember Starrcade 1990? That was Misterio Sr., showcasing his skills on a global stage, a true pioneer of the sport. He was like the wrestling equivalent of a vintage record, a classic that paved the way for the hits to come. Now, let's talk about Rey Mysterio Jr., the man who made Lucha Libre a household name. He's basically the wrestling equivalent of a superhero origin story, taking the foundation laid by his uncle and launching it into the stratosphere. He brought us the 619, the West Coast Pop, and a level of athleticism that would make Spider-Man jealous. He took the torch and ran with it, transforming it into a blazing inferno.But the Mysterio saga doesn’t end there. Enter Dominik Mysterio , Rey Jr.’s son, who's currently channeling his inner Darth Vader with The Judgment Day. He’s gone from a fresh-faced rookie to a heel that would make even Loki proud. It’s a classic story of generational conflict, like a wrestling version of The Lion King, but with more leather and less singing. He’s taking the family legacy and giving it a dark, rebellious twist, showing us that the Mysterio bloodline is as unpredictable as a Netflix algorithm. Let’s not forget, that Misterio Sr. didn't just pop out of thin air. He was a boxer turned luchador, a gritty competitor who transitioned from throwing punches to throwing opponents. He was still in the ring in April 2023, teaming up with Aero Star and Mr. Iguana to take down Hereje, Hijo de Pirata Morgan, and Nightmare Azteca, proving that age is just a number. He was a true warrior, a legend who inspired generations.ALSO READ: What's in the Card for AJ Styles?

He’s the rebellious heir, the one rewriting the rulebook.","Rey Misterio Sr. passed away on December 20, 2024, leaving behind a legacy that’s more tangled than a headphone cord in your pocket.

Josh Allen’s Eventful Offseason: MVP Glory, Engagement Bliss, and a Bachelor Party with the Boys



Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen may not have led his team to the Super Bowl, but his 2024 season was nothing short of spectacular. Capping off a career-best performance, Allen secured the prestigious AP Most Valuable Player (MVP) award, proving once again why he is one of the league’s most electrifying quarterbacks. Beyond his impressive stats—3,731 passing yards, 28 touchdowns, and an additional 513 rushing yards with 12 scores—the 28-year-old also found personal success, as he proposed to Hollywood star Hailee Steinfeld during the Bills’ bye week.While the couple has kept their wedding plans private, Josh Allen recently took some time off to enjoy his bachelor party in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. According to WPBF sports anchor Yianni Kourakis, Allen and his close circle of friends, including his brother Jason Allen, headed to the Sunshine State to kick off the celebrations. Given Allen’s love for golf, it was no surprise that the event was centered around the sport, particularly at the TGL event on March 4.The star-studded bachelor trip included some notable NFL names, such as Minnesota Vikings quarterback Sam Darnold, Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Kyle Allen, Jacksonville Jaguars wide receiver Christian Kirk, and Buffalo Bills tight end Dalton Kincaid. Interestingly, Allen had previously mentioned Darnold, Kirk, and Kyle Allen as his “dream golf foursome” in a CBS Sports interview last summer, making this gathering all the more special.The group attended the TGL match featuring Tiger Woods ' Jupiter Links Golf Club taking on Atlanta Drive GC, and they weren’t shy about getting into the spirit of the game. While the new golf league promises a unique and intense atmosphere, Allen and his friends embraced the fun, even getting a bit rowdy with their energetic reactions.During ESPN’s coverage of the event, Allen was interviewed about his offseason plans. When asked what he had in store, he responded with a perfectly timed and thoughtful answer:“Honestly, doing … listen, doing whatever my fiancée wants to do right now. I’m a smart man, I get it. She was in Buffalo this last past season. Whatever I can do to help out I’m going to do.”That’s exactly the kind of response one would expect from an MVP—both on and off the field. While he enjoyed his time with the guys, he made it clear that Steinfeld remains his top priority.The actress, who has been turning heads with her stunning looks recently, was busy making waves at the Oscars while Allen attended the golf event. Despite their time apart, the couple has been inseparable, sharing a passionate moment at the NFL Honors 2025 show with a public display of affection.While Allen is making the most of his offseason with golf outings and time with friends, he remains devoted to supporting Steinfeld in her endeavors. Just last month, he joined her in Italy for Milan Fashion Week and attended her ""Angel Margarita"" launch party. As for his own passions, Allen has already committed to competing in the American Century Celebrity Golf Championship in July.Also Read: Eagles GM Howie Roseman compares winning Super Bowls to sex in bold NSFW remark From leading the Bills on the field to balancing love and leisure off it, Josh Allen is proving that he can quarterback both his career and personal life with equal success.","Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen recently celebrated his bachelor party in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.

The Vancouver Canucks faced another setback on Saturday night, falling 6-3 to the Seattle Kraken in a game filled with momentum swings.

Compared to 2022-23, he’s generating fewer scoring chances.After Tuesday’s practice, Pettersson admitted he hasn’t met expectations but is focused on moving forward.""I think about it a lot. I'll just be honest, I haven't been the way I want to be this year. I haven't played to the expectations I have on myself, or the franchise has on me, but that's in the past. I wish we had more wins, I wish I had played a lot better, but can't dwell on that anymore,"" Pettersson mentioned.He also addressed his ""annoying"" media comment from Feb. 25, admitting frustration got the best of him.""I was really, really mad at that moment. I said something I didn't mean. Said media is annoying, which is some days can but it's the last thing that's making me play bad or not myself this year. I just wanted to make that clear,"" Pettersson added.With the playoffs approaching, the Canucks need Pettersson to regain his scoring touch fast.The Vancouver Canucks’ struggles continued with a 6-3 loss to the Seattle Kraken on Saturday, their fourth defeat in five games.

Auston Matthews’ “Poor” Performance Sparks Speculation Among Fans Regarding His “Decline”





Stay tuned for the IND vs AUS Live Score and follow real-time match updates. Get the latest Cricket Live Score and stay ahead with every ball.



Auston Matthews, one of the most talented players in the NHL and the captain of the Toronto Maple Leafs, has been in the centre of controversy as fans believe he has not been able to perform well in this season. Recently, hosts of Sportsnet’s Leafs Talk, JD Bunkis and Sam McKee, discussed about Auston Matthews’ performance, and fans have certain opinions about it.In the recent episode of Sportsnet’s Leafs Talk, JD Bunkis says, “The big thing for me in this game…a big takeaway..there is just something about Matthews’ body language that’s not there for me this year”. His co-host, Sam McKee, seems to agree with this and says, “Yeah we talk about this a lot…I’m out of theories”.JD Bunkis then does acknowledge how Auston Matthews is injured and that might play a big role in his “poor performance” this season but he also questions the reason for Auston Matthews to be playing if “he is that injured”.JD Bunkis says, “...the aura is not the same” and it seems like fans agree with this opinion.A fan wrote, “Body language is horrible. Showed up Nylander twice when he didn’t feed him on the PP. He’s barely bending his knees while skating and he’s just stick checking instead of taking the body. If this is what we’re gonna get come April, see you on the golf course May 8th.”Another fan wrote, “Look at all the different guesses in this thread as to what’s wrong with him. Could it be that we are seeing the decline of Matthews and it’s happening faster than we imagined? I really hope it’s just an off year but my guess is it’s not. He’s definitely a shell of himself.”A third fan wrote, “The only difference from this year to last year is him wearing the C. Is his attention being pulled in too many directions that he has no time to think about the game? Is he checked out because he scored 69 goals last year but fans still shit on him for the playoff outcome?”Recently, the Toronto Maple Leafs suffered a devastating loss against the San Jose Sharks and are now gearing up for a match against the Vegas Golden Knights. Auston Matthews has not addressed all the speculations around him and has maintained silence. Even at the 4 Nations Face Off, Matthews' team could not win so fans are a bit disappointed in him.Also Read: Auston Matthews' words for J.T.

Marc-Edouard Vlasic’s legacy of toughness

Also Read:

Blocked shots don’t always make the highlight reels, but they win games and Marc-Edouard Vlasic just cemented his place in history by doing exactly that. The veteran defenseman set a new NHL record for career blocked shots during the San Jose Sharks ’ dominant 6-2 win over the Buffalo Sabres on Tuesday night. At 37 years old, Vlasic has proven once again why he remains a crucial force on the ice.The Sharks have a tradition of awarding a thick black vest to their player of the game after a victory, and on this night, there was no doubt who deserved it.Early in the first period, Vlasic stepped in front of Zach Benson’s wrist shot just 2:16 into the game, officially surpassing Mark Giordano ’s record. He finished the night with two blocks, pushing his career total to 2,166. Given his relentless defensive style, the extra padding from the vest seemed like a fitting reward.“He knows how to play the position, puts his body in the lanes, blocked big shots his whole career. You guys have seen it,” Sharks coach Ryan Warsofsky said. “I know how proud each of his teammates are. They gave him a standing ovation in the locker room. It was quite a scene and well-deserved.” (via: AP News)The 41-year-old Giordano, who previously held the record, remains unsigned after spending the past three seasons with Toronto.Vlasic has been a defensive cornerstone for the Sharks since his rookie season in 2006-07, the year after the NHL began tracking blocked shots. Over his 19-year career, he has played 1,308 games, consistently ranking among the league’s most reliable shot-blockers.“Just incredible, an incredible achievement,” said goalie Alexandar Georgiev, who stopped 20 shots in the victory. “It feels like he hasn’t played in a while, but he got back into the lineup and just making all the right plays at the right time. You can see that he’s a special player. Very nice player.”Vlasic’s durability is just as impressive as his defensive instincts. The Montreal native ranks eighth among active players in career games played and has topped the 100-block mark in a season 12 times. Despite missing the first 40 games this season with an upper-body injury, he has already recorded 22 blocks in 12 games since his return.“When it’s your turn to block, you block it,” Vlasic stated. “I’ll step in front of any puck I need to to make sure it doesn’t get to the goalie.”And with that mindset, he has etched his name in NHL history .","Marc-Edouard Vlasic set a new NHL record for career blocked shots during the San Jose Sharks’ dominant 6-2 win over the Buffalo Sabres on Tuesday night.

When and where to Darius Garland play tonight against the Miami Heat (March 5, 2025)?

The Cleveland Cavaliers have received a major boost ahead of their Wednesday, March 5, clash against the Miami Heat, as star guard Darius Garland has been cleared to play. Garland, who has been a vital part of the Cavaliers’ success this season, is set to take the court at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse after being listed as day-to-day due to a lingering injury. Darius Garland ’s return comes at a crucial time for the Cleveland Cavaliers, who are looking to maintain their dominance in the Eastern Conference. Averaging 17.8 points and 5.6 assists over the last 20 games, Garland’s playmaking and three-point shooting (2.6 made threes per game) are essential to Cleveland’s league-leading offense, which scores 123.3 points per game. His presence will be particularly valuable against a Heat team that ranks seventh in the NBA in defensive efficiency, allowing just 110.5 points per contest.The Cleveland Cavaliers have managed to stay afloat despite injury concerns, thanks to standout performances from Donovan Mitchell, who leads the team with 24.3 points per game, and Jarrett Allen, who averages a double-double with 12.6 points and 11.1 rebounds. However, Garland’s ability to control the tempo and create opportunities for his teammates elevates Cleveland’s game, especially in high-stakes matchups like this one.On the other side, the Miami Heat are dealing with significant injury issues, with six players listed on their report, including key contributors like Jaime Jaquez Jr. and Nikola Jovic. Tyler Herro and Bam Adebayo will need to carry the load for Miami, but the Cavaliers’ depth and home-court advantage make them the favorites heading into the game.With Darius Garland fit to play, the Cleveland Cavaliers are in a strong position to extend their impressive 51-10 record. The game tips off at 7 p.m. ET and will be broadcast on ESPN, FDSOH, and FDSSUN. Fans can also stream the game live on Fubo, though regional restrictions may apply.Also read: Will Donovan Mitchell play tonight against the Miami Heat?

Brady Tkachuk’s Loyalty to Team USA — and the Senators

Ottawa Senators captain Brady Tkachuk is making headlines again — but this time, it’s not for dropping gloves or scoring clutch goals. The fiery forward found himself at the center of a heated off-ice moment after fans at the Canadian Tire Centre booed the American national anthem on Saturday, March 2, 2025, ahead of the Senators' 5–3 win over the San Jose Sharks .While the Senators celebrated a solid victory, the crowd's reaction to ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" struck a nerve with Brady Tkachuk — an American who recently shined for Team USA at the 4 Nations Face-Off . The boos didn't sit well with the captain, whose frustration was clear as he skated onto the ice.Former NHLer and ""Spittin' Chiclets"" co-host Ryan Whitney didn't hold back his thoughts on the incident. He took to X (formerly Twitter) to deliver a blunt message to the Ottawa fanbase:Whitney posted, suggesting that continued disrespect for the US anthem could push Brady Tkachuk to reconsider his future with the team.This isn’t the first time fans have jeered anthems at NHL games. The back-and-forth between Canadian and American crowds has become a growing trend. Just last week, boos echoed through Madison Square Garden during the Canadian anthem before the New York Rangers faced off against the Toronto Maple Leafs.Many believe these displays are fueled by ongoing geopolitical tensions between the two countries — a rivalry that seems to be spilling over onto the ice.Brady Tkachuk's reaction is hardly surprising given his recent success with Team USA. He played a pivotal role in their journey to the 4 Nations Face-Off final, reinforcing his pride in representing his country.However, the star forward’s heart remains with the Ottawa Senators, a team he’s fiercely loyal to both on and off the ice. His spirited play, whether through scoring goals or standing up for his teammates — as seen in his recent fight against Tom Wilson — proves his commitment to the Sens.Despite the off-ice controversy, Brady Tkachuk remains focused on the Senators’ playoff push. Ottawa currently sits just one point shy of a wild card spot in the Eastern Conference. Their next challenge? A matchup against the Chicago Blackhawks on Wednesday — a crucial game as they battle to secure a postseason berth.As for the anthem drama, it’s clear Tkachuk won’t let the noise in the stands distract him from his mission. But Ryan Whitney’s warning lingers — will Senators fans dial it back, or will the tension between the crowd and their captain continue to simmer?One thing's for sure: Brady Tkachuk's fire — both on and off the ice — is keeping everyone on their toes.Also read - Brady Tkachuk's Net Worth in 2025: NHL Contract, Endorsements, and Career Earnings","Brady Tkachuk is the captain of the Ottawa Senators.

are in a huge crisis as the franchise is trying to endure both questionable management decisions and devastating injuries. Following Luka Doncic's shocking trade and now, the team finds itself in an increasingly devastating situation. Amid fans’ frustration, Yahoo Sports' Kevin O'Connor has called for a major shake-up within the organization, starting with the firing of general manager Nico Harrison .Trading away Luka Doncic was already a controversial move, but the decision looks even worse in hindsight. Since his departure, the Mavericks have struggled to find their identity, and the recent ACL injury to Kyrie Irving has only added to their problems. Fans and analysts are questioning whether Nico Harrison was the right person to lead the Dallas Mavericks to help the team bounce back.Kevin O'Connor didn't hold back in his criticism of Harrison, holding him directly responsible for the team's current predicament. ""My main thought here is this - Patrick Dumont, the Mavericks owner, needs to fire Nico Harrison today. This injury is an opportunity for him to gain the respect and trust of Mavericks fans by admitting the grave mistake because this is all Nico Harrison's fault. All of it,"" O'Connor said.O'Connor argues that Harrison's management has been reckless, pushing players like Davis too hard and mismanaging assets, ultimately leading to unnecessary injuries and poor performance.The analyst suggests that the Mavericks need to take an even bolder move to consider a revamp in management. ""Do you keep trying to win, or do you trade (Irving and Davis) away? Because as bad as the Luka deal was, (Davis) is a top-10 player. He is worth the equivalent of four, five first-round draft picks, so you could trade him for a strong return even if it only ends up three to four, that's still a good return,"" he said.Dallas fans have not been quiet about their discontent with the general manager. During a previous home game against the Sacramento Kings, multiple fans were seen holding signs that read ""Fire Nico."" One particularly vocal fan was caught on the jumbotron mouthing the same phrase before being escorted out of the arena. The frustration sparked right after the surprising Doncic's trade that created a shockwave in the league.Also Read: LeBron James becomes first NBA player ever to surpass 50,000 career points Irving is out for the season, and Davis is potentially being shut down, which makes the case for the team even worse.

Rhea Ripley breaks silence on her WWE title loss

Rhea Ripley is completely distraught over losing the title: Raw exclusive, March 3, 2025

Also Read:

The March 3rd edition of Monday Night RAW saw an action-packed performance between Rhea Ripley and IYO SKY, who were fighting against each other to claim their Women’s World title and punching a ticket to WrestleMania 41 . Ripley was very close to winning the bout, but unfortunately, the tables turned the other way making IYO SKY clinch the title.Rhea Ripley was completely distraught after the loss of the title which she missed by whiskers. The match turned the other way when Ripley tried confronting Belair, who was cheering for SKY from the sidelines, leading IYO SKY to attack her. IYO SKY later pinned her in the ring with an Over the Moonsault attack to win the title.In an exclusive interview with WWE RAW , Ripley reacted to her loss and reflected on the match. Here’s how she has reacted—In a WWE Raw exclusive interview with Jackie Redmond, Ripley broke her silence and expressed her emotional state following the WWE event. The wrestler who lost the title to Genius of The Sky said in the interview: “How am I feeling? I’m pissed off, I’m mad, I’m furious, I’m everything.""She added, “Every single angry feeling I am feeling. But the thing is, I can’t even be mad at IYO. I can’t fully be mad at Bianca. I’m more disappointed and mad at myself because I should have known better. I should have known not to take my eye off the ball.""“I’ve been through this crap with Liv Morgan, I’ve been through all this with Dom,” Ripley said. “I’ve been through this with Judgment Day, and I still cannot learn. I cannot learn to think for myself, and I cannot learn to keep my eye on the ball. And I cannot learn that friends are not real.""She further said, “I knew what IYO SKY is capable of, I knew that I had never beaten her before. I knew all these things, and I was still dumb enough to think that I could go out there and take everything on like I’m just unstoppable or something.”According to Rhea Ripley , her eye came off the ball because she felt hurt as Belair was rooting for SKY. Initially, Ripley thought that she and Belair were friends, as they came up together through NXT and later shared the WWE 2024 cover. But, she eventually lost her faith when Belair supported SKY during the match.Ripley has further said that she has yearned to face Belair as a dream WrestleMania opponent. However, Belair made sure during the event that she would rather face SKY, and not Ripley, at the upcoming Show of Shows.","The March 3rd edition of Monday Night RAW saw an action-packed performance between Rhea Ripley and IYO SKY.

Tucker’s potential role with the Los Angeles Lakers

“While Tucker wouldn't completely solve the Lakers center issue, he has played center in the past,”

Jennifer Hudson Takes a Surprise Hit Courtside at New York Knicks Game



Picture this: You're Jennifer Hudson, a vocal powerhouse, an EGOT legend, chilling courtside at a Knicks game. You’re ready for a night of slam dunks and celebrity sightings, maybe even an And I Am Telling You I’m Not Going rendition during a timeout. But instead? You’re dodging basketballs like Neo dodging bullets in the Matrix. Was it a freak accident, a cosmic prank orchestrated by the basketball gods, or dare we say, a subtle nod to a dramatic plot twist worthy of a Shonda Rhimes series?Let’s break it down. J-Hud, alongside her beau Common, was vibing at Madison Square Garden, ready to witness the Knicks take on the Warriors. Then, BAM! Miles McBride, in a flurry of athletic prowess (or perhaps a moment of sheer chaos), sent a basketball careening toward Hudson’s head. It's like a scene straight out of a sports blooper reel, but with an Oscar winner in the starring role.Now, here’s where it gets interesting. Common, bless his heart, attempted a heroic save. Think of him as the Denzel Washington of courtside protection, stepping in to shield his lady. But alas, in his valiant effort, he may have inadvertently added insult to (almost) injury, seemingly swiping Hudson's face. Was it a gentle nudge? A playful tap? Or a moment that will forever be immortalized in meme history, like that time Leonardo DiCaprio struggled with his vape pen?Hudson, ever the professional, took it like a champ, though a slight grimace suggested she felt more than a gentle breeze. Thankfully, no major harm was done. She even managed to mingle with Spike Lee, a true MSG staple, proving that even a near-basketball-induced concussion can’t dampen her star power.ALSO READ: LeBron James' 50K Points Draws Leonardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire, and Star-Studded Frenzy But let’s not forget the other A-listers who’ve faced similar peril at MSG this season. Anne Hathaway, remember? Nearly taken out by OG Anunoby. It's like MSG is becoming the Hunger Games of celebrity sports viewing, where survival is the ultimate prize.It's like the Garden is running its own version of Squid Game, but instead of deadly challenges, it’s rogue basketballs and accidental celebrity face-taps. So, next time you’re courtside, remember to keep your eyes on the ball, folks, and maybe wear a helmet. You never know when a basketball, or a well-intentioned save, might just come flying your way.","Jennifer Hudson was courtside at the New York Knicks game against the Warriors.

In the world of the NBA, Michael Jordan and LeBron James are two of the biggest names. The impact they have had on basketball is something few others can even think of, let alone make. From championships to career records, the two are always being compared to each other, even though Michael Jordan retired the year LeBron James started his NBA journey. But the debate on who is the greatest of all time is never-ending. Today, let's take a look at two of these NBA legends and see if we can find out who trumps the other.Michael Jordan has 6 championships and 6 Finals MVPs in his career, while LeBron James has 4 championships and 4 Finals MVPs so far. Jordan's perfect record in the NBA Finals gives him a significant edge in this category, but given James is still an active player, he could potentially match up to Jordan soon enough. The debate continues Michael Jordan averaged 30.1 points, 6.2 rebounds, and 5.3 assists per game in his career, while LeBron James averages 27.0 points, 7.5 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game. Jordan has a higher scoring average, but James takes the lead in rebounds and assists.Michael Jordan has a higher Player Efficiency Rating (PER) of 27.9 than LeBron James' 26.9. LeBron James on the other hand, has the career Value Over Replacement (VORP) in NBA history, at 155.76 to Jordan's 116.05. James also leads in Win Shares with 270.1, compared to Jordan's 214.02.Michael Jordan has 5 MVP awards, while LeBron James has 4. However, James has been named to 20 All-NBA Teams, compared to Jordan's 11. James also has 21 All-Star appearances, while Jordan has 14. Both have been named NBA All-Star Game MVP 3 times.Jordan has 9 All-Defensive First Team selections, while James has 5. Jordan is widely regarded as one of the greatest defenders in NBA history.While these stats provide a comprehensive look at the careers of both Jordan and James, it's not easy to state one is better than the other. Both players have impressive resumes. Though Jordan's championships and Finals MVPs give him a strong claim to the GOAT title , James's longevity, all-around game, and advanced stats give him an edge as well. Ultimately, the GOAT debate comes down to personal opinion and how viewers weigh different factors into the debate.Also Read: LeBron James vs Michael Jordan: Ex-Chicago Bulls star exposes who NBA execs think is the real GOAT","Michael Jordan and LeBron James are two of the biggest names in the NBA.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin. The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee. England completely skipped Saturday's practice, but many India players also skipped the optional session.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118081067,imgsize-126924,width-400,resizemode-4/118081067.jpg"
