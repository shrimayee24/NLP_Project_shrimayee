Whenever Scott Foster steps on the court, it brings relief to the side that is lagging in the series. Coincidentally, the referee has been a part of all those games, where the lagging team got a lifeline. As a result, he earned the nickname, ‘The Extender.’ However, apart from being a lucky charm for the lagging side, he has come under the scanner on several instances where his decisions created controversy.Recently, Scott officiated Game 4 between the Indiana Pacers and Oklahoma City Thunder. As expected, the Oklahoma City Thunder made a comeback and saved themselves another chance by evening the series 2-2. His decisions caused uproar among fans at various points during the crucial game, the most prominent one being Alex Caruso given a clean chit despite fouling on Tyrese Haliburton.Here are the top 5 controversial decisions given by Scott Foster, which drew angry fan reactions and also led the NBA to rescind them, at times.Chris Paul never denied having a beef against Scott Foster, and why wouldn’t he? Paul’s teams were 0-13 in the playoff losses, a streak that they finally broke in 2023.The same year, while playing against the Phoenix Suns, Chris Paul was controversially ejected from the Golden State Warriors by Scott.The decision did not go well among the fraternity, and the rumors swirled in NBA circles that there was money acting behind the call.Scott Foster was a part of the 2023 NBA Denver Nuggets-Miami Heat final as the replay center official. Though behind the screen, he continued to cause a stir among fans with his controversial calls. In one of the disputed fouls made by Aaron Gordon, he upheld the decision and stripped Jimmy Butler of a three-pointer.The decision sparked social media debate, where fans did not hold back their thoughts about Foster and his dubious calls.2023 seemed to be a year full of Scott Foster horror for the NBA fans. He made the most controversial calls that year. One such decision was later rescinded by the NBA on the grounds of an erroneous decision.The foul in question is a technical foul given to Jaylen Brown in Game 7 between the Boston Celtics and the Philadelphia 76ers. Scott stuck to his decision despite the video showing that Brown just reacted to a push and didn’t make an intentional contact.Brown later said to reporters, “I don’t know which way I should have responded to it. But if I didn’t do anything, it probably would have played on. And here comes Scott Foster, right away before even deciphering the situation, gives me a tech.”The decision was later retracted by the NBA.Foster seemed unnecessarily aggressive towards Nikola Jokic during Game 4 of the 2023 NBA Finals. He called Jokic for a fifth foul. Interestingly, the contact was not at all conspicuous and could have easily been shrugged off. Scott went on to call it a technical foul, leading to a frenzy among fans.One Reddit user ranted on his handle:“Scott Foster legitimately is crooked… one or two pieces of coincidental evidence may be bad luck… but Foster has a whole fucking book of coincidental evidence of rigging”The call reflected badly on Jokic’s team Denver Nuggets, who had to send their star performer to the bench for a significant period.The peak of hate towards Scott Foster for his erroneous and inconsistent officiating was seen in 2024. In a game played in March 2024 between the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Cleveland Cavaliers, Foster called Rudy Gobert for a foul. Gobert could not contain his resentment and responded with a ‘money sign’ alluding to Foster’s probable involvement in betting.The reaction from Gobert cost him a $100,000 fine. He apologized later for the gesture and the loss it brought to the team.Also Read: Referee Scott Foster suffers bloody nose injuries early in Oklahoma City Thunder and Minnesota Timberwolves’ Game 2 Scott Foster’s inconsistent officiating has always been a pain for NBA fans.

KG will surely be in the Hall of Fame one day,” Bavuma said, reflecting the deep camaraderie in the side.Rabada, visibly emotional, described the victory as a culmination of years of frustration and near-misses for South African cricket. “We’ve seen the heartbreak over the years.

Kylie Kelce is no stranger to real, unfiltered conversations, especially when it comes to family. In the latest episode of her Not Gonna Lie podcast, aired June 12, the mom of four opened up about a deeply personal memory that revealed the bond she shares with her mother, Lisa McDevitt — whom she lovingly refers to as “Lil’ Lis. ”Joining forces with Olympic rugby player Ilona Maher, the episode unfolded into an honest discussion about how their mothers influenced their understanding of sex and communication. For Kylie Kelce, this comfort was rooted in openness from an early age. Recounting a moment that clearly stuck with her, she said, ""I bombarded her, and came in and sat in a room while she was doing something, and just was like, 'OK, Mom, here. We're here now.'""At the time, Kelce had made up her mind to wait until marriage to have sex. But her mother’s response was anything but conventional. ""I think I'm gonna save myself for marriage,"" she told her mom. The reply? ""I think you're gonna change your mind."" And that wasn’t even the punchline.Kelce laughed as she remembered her mom’s brutally honest follow-up. ""Lil' Lisa doubled down... She was like, 'Hey, you gotta test drive a car before you buy it, right?'""While the original plan didn’t pan out, Kelce said the point wasn’t about the decision itself — it was the freedom she felt in making it.“It made it less scary. It made it less risky,” she said, adding that being able to speak openly with her mom gave her a safer, more informed perspective on sex and relationships.Now a mother to four daughters — Wyatt (5), Elliotte (4), Bennett (2), and baby Finnley, born in March — Kylie hopes to build the same trusting dynamic with her own girls. She believes that kind of environment allows for real conversations about protection and safety. “With my mom, then I could talk about getting an IUD, I could talk about condoms and all that stuff with her,” she explained.Beyond the sex talk, Kelce also let fans into the chaos of raising four young kids. She joked, “If I had to describe the change going from three kids to four kids in two words or less: ‘Holy shit?’” Despite being a seasoned mom, she admitted she’s “still Googling things because that doesn’t stop, either.”For Kelce, authenticity and humor are part of the journey. Whether she’s parenting or podcasting, one thing is clear — the candid legacy of “Lil’ Lis” lives on.Also Read: Ex-girlfriend of Aaron Rodgers reacts after he confirms secret marriage: ""It's really just harassment""","Kylie Kelce opened up about a deeply personal memory that revealed the bond she shares with her mother, Lisa McDevitt.

How Wiggins Fits With LeBron and Doncic





Theare weighing their options this offseason, and according to a popular NBA analyst, one potential move involves swapping a key forward for a proven NBA champion.The Los Angeles Lakers have two clear paths in free agency: pursuing a dominant center or trading for an experienced wing player to bolster their championship aspirations. According to recent reports, the franchise may lean toward the latter by targeting Miami Heat star Andrew Wiggins.Lake Show Life’s Svyatoslav Rovenchuk suggests the Lakers could package forward Rui Hachimura in a deal to acquire Wiggins from the Miami Heat.""The fit of Rui Hachimura alongside (Luka) Doncic and (LeBron) James has quickly come under scrutiny after a premature first-round exit to the Minnesota Timberwolves,"" Rovenchuk wrote. ""This has led many to believe the Lakers are better off trading the starting forward."" (H/t: Sporting News)Andrew Wiggins could provide the Los Angeles Lakers with much-needed perimeter scoring and defensive versatility. Here’s why this trade could work:- Salary Match: Hachimura ($17 million) plus another expiring contract could match Wiggins’ $28.2 million salary for 2025-26.- Proven Playoff Performer: Wiggins was instrumental in Golden State’s 2022 title run, averaging 17.2 points and 4.5 rebounds per game.- Immediate Upgrade: While Hachimura is solid, Wiggins offers better two-way impact and championship experience.Once considered an underachieving talent in Minnesota, Wiggins revitalized his career with the Golden State Warriors . His improved motor and efficiency made him a key piece in Golden State’s success.However, after a slow start in 2024-25, the Warriors traded him to Miami in the Jimmy Butler deal.Wiggins’ skill set complements the Lakers’ star duo:- Reliable three-point shooting for better floor spacing.- Strong perimeter defense to ease the load on LeBron James.- Playoff-tested mentality, crucial for deep postseason runs.With the Heat struggling, Wiggins may welcome a move to a contender like the Lakers.While Hachimura has been a steady presence, Wiggins represents a clear upgrade for a Los Angeles Lakers team in win-now mode. If Los Angeles can structure the right deal, adding the former Warriors champion could be the move that pushes them back into title contention.","The Los Angeles Lakers have two clear paths in free agency: pursuing a dominant center or trading for an experienced wing player.

Tyrese Haliburton fires back at critics, Stephen A. Smith takes it personally in fiery rant



Hilarious fan reactions to ‘ Dumb and Dumber ’ trolling of Stephen A. Smith and Kendrick Perkins at Game 4







Sometimes, the loudest message in a Finals game doesn’t come from a superstar or a coach—it comes from the stands. During Game 4 of the 2025 NBA Finals at Gainbridge Fieldhouse, while most fans rocked gold Pacers shirts, two individuals turned heads with bold fashion choices straight out of a comedy classic. Dressed in Dumb and Dumber-style tuxedos—one bright orange, one electric blue—they topped it off with oversized face cutouts of ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith and Kendrick Perkins. It was a hilarious, pointed response to recent media criticism of Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton—and fans online immediately took notice.The media heat on Tyrese Haliburton started after Game 2, when he was criticized for his passiveness in a 107–123 Pacers loss. On “First Take”, ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith didn’t hold back. “Win the damn chip, bro… That ain’t on me. That’s on you,” he said, implying Haliburton wasn’t delivering when it mattered. Smith continued, “Just in case he was talking about me—my brother, I'm not going away… this train don’t stop.”Then came Game 3. Haliburton bounced back with 22 points, 11 assists, and 9 rebounds in a 116–107 Pacers win. After the game, he was asked about the media noise. He didn’t name names but made his feelings clear: “Most of the time, the talking heads on the major platforms, I couldn’t care less honestly. Like, what do they really know about basketball?” Kendrick Perkins , speaking on NBA Today, gave Haliburton credit for stepping up.“He finally arrived to the NBA Finals—to us box score watchers,” Perkins said. He even acknowledged, “He outplayed SGA.”And then came Game 4, when two fans used fashion to flip the script. Their orange and blue tuxes carried double meaning: orange symbolizing Smith’s New York Knicks loyalty, and blue a nod to the Oklahoma City Thunder—Perkins’ former team. It was comedy, commentary, and petty brilliance all rolled into one.Fans took to X with no shortage of reactions to the trolling masterclass.One fan said: “Absolutely incredible troll job by Pacers fans dressed as Stephen A. Smith and Kendrick Perkins. Dumb and Dumber tuxedos and all.”This tweet captured the moment perfectly and praised the fans for the elite-level trolling and creative execution.A second user chimed in with: “Two guys in the front row at the Pacers game dressed like Dumb and Dumber with Stephen A Smith and Kendrick Perkins faces on their suits.”This user highlighted the boldness of the fans’ courtside position, emphasizing how visible and intentional the troll job was.Another user joked: “Are these two guys front row at the Pacers game calling Stephen A Smith and Kendrick Perkins Dumb and Dumber?”This tweet added playful speculation, bluntly asking if the fans were deliberately labeling the ESPN duo as the classic comedy characters.One more said:“Best thing I’ve seen tonight…. Dumb and Dumber at the Pacer game tonight!”This comment called the bit the highlight of the evening—more memorable than even the on-court action for some viewers.And finally, another user said:“Pretty sure these fans are in Dumb and Dumber costumes…with face cutouts of Stephen A Smith and Kendrick Perkins.”This tweet added to the confirmation and appreciation of the stunt, acknowledging the detail in the fans’ outfits and execution.Also Read: Tyrese Haliburton shares heartwarming moment with Obi Toppin’s daughter before crucial Indiana Pacers vs. Oklahoma City Thunder NBA Finals Game 4 From Tyrese Haliburton shrugging off criticism to two fans turning sports talk into visual satire, Game 4 of the NBA Finals was about more than basketball.

A new leadership duet in Los Angeles Lakers

Early glimpses of success and struggle





When Luka Doncic walked into the Lakers locker room, he didn’t just bring talent — he brought tension, too. The February blockbuster trade sent Anthony Davis packing and handed LeBron James a new challenge: sharing control. While wins piled up early, playoff heartbreak and quiet chemistry gaps revealed the truth—this partnership is still in its early steps. Can two legends learn to lead together before the moment passes?February 2, 2025, marked a significant midseason trade for the Lakers: they traded Anthony Davis, Max Christie, and a 2029 first-round pick to Dallas, bringing in Luka Doncic, Maxi Kleber, and Markieff Morris. This was the first midseason trade involving two current All-NBA players. LeBron was taken aback at first—believing it was a joke during a family dinner in New York—before coming to terms with the fact that a new era was upon them.At first, there were some questions, but it didn't take long for signs of unity to pop up. LeBron gave a shoutout to Luka for his locker room presence, saying he has a knack for ""instilling confidence in his teammates."" Doncic shared that feeling, referring to the enthusiastic reception he got before the game as a ""significant moment"" that bonded the players and staff.When they were playing, LeBron compared their synergy to that of a quarterback and wide receiver, noting how Luka’s insight and his scoring talent mesh perfectly.In their fourth matchup, the Lakers took control against the Nuggets, with Doncic scoring 32 points, grabbing 10 rebounds, and dishing out 7 assists, while LeBron contributed 25 points and 9 rebounds, leading to seven consecutive victories and a 39–21 record. However, building chemistry doesn’t just happen. A first-round playoff loss to Minnesota revealed weaknesses: lack of frontcourt depth, exhaustion, and defensive lapses.Even now, there are little signs pointing to a growing connection. Analysts have observed the clear synergy between the duo on the court, but their locker-room 'handshakes' seem a bit flat—indicating that their chemistry is still in the early stages. LeBron has taken on the role of a friendly mentor—giving elbow bumps and sharing advice—but these stars are still figuring out how to trust one another beyond just the numbers.Luka Doncic’s debut with the Lakers has been quite the show—it’s a change that really rocks the foundation of a franchise built around LeBron James. While the early wins suggested a bright future, the playoff setbacks and the need for patience in the locker room reveal that this is a journey, not an instant solution. The base is strong, leadership is collaborative, and confidence is shared—but the Lakers now have to bolster their supporting cast, improve their defense, and cultivate team harmony.Also Read: “He Might Not Be from This Planet” — JaVale McGee recalls watching Stephen Curry drain 100 unbelievable practice Shots If LeBron and Doncic get the locker-room dance down, this partnership could totally transform Lakers basketball.

Lobo Predicted It, Again: South Africa’s Historic WTC Win vs Australia





NEW DELHI: South Africa defeated reigning champions Australia by five wickets in the World Test Championship final at Lord's on Saturday, successfully chasing down a target of 282 before lunch on the fourth day. Aiden Markram 's superb 136 and captain Temba Bavuma's 66 led South Africa to victory, while Australia's captain Pat Cummins acknowledged his team fell short despite being favoured to win against a South African side with fewer star players.Australia initially held a 74-run lead after the first innings, but couldn't maintain their advantage as South African fast bowler Kagiso Rabada delivered an impressive performance with match figures of 9-110.""Things can change pretty quickly. Unfortunately, it was a bridge too far,"" said Cummins at the post-match presentation ceremony.Steve Smith's first-innings score of 66 stood as the only half-century or better by an Australian specialist batsman in the match. Smith's participation in the upcoming first Test against the West Indies in Barbados on June 25 is now uncertain due to a dislocated finger sustained while dropping a slip catch.""We've got a couple of weeks before the first Test in the Windies, so we'll sit down and have a bit of a think,"" said Cummins.""To make these finals, it's normally off the back of being really strong at home, but you've got to win some away series too,"" he later added at a post-match press conference. ""So, in some ways, it's good we get to dust ourselves off and turn around in a couple of weeks and start looking ahead to the next one. That's one of the good things about the World Test Championship, every Test series and every Test match feels like you're playing for something significant. ""South Africa's successful run chase marked the second-highest at Lord's in Test history, behind only the West Indies' 344-1 against England in 1984.""They (South Africa) were fantastic in that fourth innings. There wasn't a lot in the wicket but they didn't give us a chance,"" said Cummins.The match concluded the third edition of the World Test Championship, following New Zealand's victory in 2021 and Australia's triumph in 2023, with India finishing as runners-up in both instances.The championship's format has faced criticism due to countries having the freedom to determine their Test match participation during the two-year qualifying cycle. South Africa played just 12 Tests in the recent cycle, without facing England or Australia, while Australia reached the final after winning 13 out of 19 matches.""They showed why they're in this final and are deserved champions,"" Cummins said of South Africa.Regarding the format, Cummins jokingly remarked, ""I preferred it at the Oval last time,"" before adding more seriously, ""It's something you build towards for two years, it's a huge achievement to make the final, and then a one-game shootout, I think it's a fantastic spectacle.""Australia may need to reassess their batting lineup as they begin a new World Test Championship cycle, particularly considering Marnus Labuschagne's struggles, who averaged only 25.63 in Tests during the 2024/25 season and scored just 17 and 22 at Lord's after being promoted to opener.",South Africa defeated reigning champions Australia by five wickets in the World Test Championship final at Lord's on Saturday.

Joe Burrow, one of the most popular and talented players in the league, has finally opened up about Trey Hendrickson’s situation with the Cincinnati Bengals.

We're all supporting Trey, and would love for him to be back.""But Joe Burrow’s words have not gone down well with his fans. A fan wrote, “Mr. Excuses back at it again”, while another fan commented, “wow burrow can’t count to 2? or he just forget about that 1st round bust already?”A third fan wrote, “Kinda disappointed in Joe.. put the same emphasis on the front office to sign Trey as you did Tee and Jamarr. I expected more.. But that’s just me and this is business”.However, some fans have also supported Joe Burrow.A fan wrote, “I love Joe because he’s always trying to get his guys paid. This is the answer that gives Trey a bit more leverage.”Another fan wrote, “#Bengals front office, is putting Joe Burrow in such a tough spot, every year, for absolutely no reason… Trey deserves to be paid, he was there with the team, when others weren’t.

Temba Bavuma on picking Ngidi over Paterson for WTC Final: 'Tough decision'





South African fast bowler Kagiso Rabada has etched his name alongside West Indies legend Gordon Greenidge as the only two players in the 141-year history of Lord’s to appear on the iconic honours boards in both the home and away dressing rooms. Rabada ’s latest feat came during the World Test Championship (WTC) final against Australia at the historic ground. The 30-year-old delivered a masterclass, claiming 5 for 51 in the first innings and following it up with another four wickets in the second, helping South Africa stay competitive against a strong Australian side.In Test cricket, players who score a century or take a five-wicket haul at Lord’s earn the privilege of having their name inscribed in gold lettering on the famous honours boards - an accolade revered by cricketers worldwide.Before Rabada, this rare distinction belonged solely to Gordon Greenidge. The legendary opener’s scores of 214 not out and 103 for the West Indies against England in 1984 and 1988 are immortalised on the away honours board. Lesser known, however, is Greenidge’s appearance on the home board — a result of his 122 while playing for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) against the Rest of the World in 1987.Rabada, too, was already on the away board for his five-wicket haul (5 for 52) against England in 2022.But this time, a unique twist added to the story. As South Africa were assigned the home dressing room for the WTC final, Rabada’s first-innings five-for earned him a place on the home board as well — making him only the second player in Lord’s history to achieve this honour.A piece of sticky batting tape with Rabada’s name written on it has been temporarily attached to the board for his figures of 5-51, as tradition dictates during the match. The gold lettering will follow soon, reported the BBC.Rabada’s achievement is even more poignant given his recent redemption arc, bouncing back strongly after serving a doping ban for using a recreational drug — an incident Australian captain Pat Cummins confirmed his side would not exploit as a sledging tactic. “That’s not our style. I doubt that will come up,” Cummins said before the final.Cricket greats have not held back in their praise. Former Australia skipper Ricky Ponting likened Rabada’s prowess at Lord’s to that of Glenn McGrath, who famously exploited the unique slope at the ground to devastating effect. “Glenn McGrath was exactly the same at Lord’s. He loved bowling there and mastered the slope from both ends — something not talked about as much as it should be,” Ponting told the ICC. “These big games are about big-name players standing up, and Rabada did exactly that. ”Reflecting on his name appearing in both dressing rooms, Rabada called the achievement “cool”, underlining the personal significance of joining such a niche club in cricket’s spiritual home.",Kagiso Rabada has become only the second player in Lord's history to have his name inscribed on both the home and away honours boards. The 30-year-old claimed a total of 9 wickets during the World Test Championship (WTC) final against Australia at the historic ground. West Indies legend Gordon Greenidge is the only other player to have both honours.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121829108,imgsize-79092,width-400,resizemode-4/121829108.jpg"

Brad Marchand’s historic night, a shutdown on McDavid, and a ruthless Panthers penalty kill push Florida to the edge of Stanley Cup glory





The Florida Panthers just keep finding ways to respond. After a wild collapse in Game 4, they came out in Game 5 and left no doubt. With a steady mix of veteran leadership, timely offense, and lockdown defense, Florida took down the Edmonton Oilers 5–2 on Saturday night — moving within one win of a second straight Stanley Cup title. Brad Marchand scored twice, Sam Bennett kept up his playoff tear, and Sergei Bobrovsky was steady when it mattered most.Game 5 felt different from the start. The Florida Panthers didn’t just jump out to a lead — they protected it and built on it. Marchand lit the spark with two goals, tying a Finals feat only Mario Lemieux had matched in the last 50 years: scoring five or more goals in multiple championship series. With 13 career goals in the Final, no active player has more.Sam Bennett added his league-best 15th of the playoffs to help Florida build a 3–0 cushion. The Oilers finally got a pulse when Connor McDavid scored his first goal of the series — but Florida punched right back. Just 46 seconds later, Sam Reinhart answered, killing any momentum Edmonton hoped to gain.The Panthers’ defense clamped down after that. Edmonton had a few flashes, but their top guns — McDavid, Leon Draisaitl , and the rest of the power play unit — never found rhythm.Florida’s penalty kill was aggressive and smart, forcing mistakes and keeping the Oilers 0-for-3 on the man advantage.Bobrovsky didn’t face a barrage but did what he had to, stopping 19 of 21 shots. The only real push from Edmonton came too late, with Corey Perry scoring with just over three minutes left before Eetu Luostarinen sealed it with an empty-netter.Now up 3–2 in the series, Florida returns home for Game 6 with a chance to close things out in front of their fans. The Panthers have now won 10 road games this postseason, but Tuesday night offers a shot at something even sweeter — lifting the Cup in their own building. With Marchand rolling, Bennett finishing, and Bobrovsky locked in, the title is within reach.Also Read: NHL MVP Showdown: Nikita Kucherov, Leon Draisaitl, and Connor Hellebuyck clash for 2025 Hart Trophy ahead of Game 4",The Florida Panthers beat the Edmonton Oilers 5-2 in Game 5 of the Stanley Cup Final.

Alex Caruso makes history in Game 4 as Oklahoma City Thunder keep NBA Finals hopes alive

From undrafted to unmissable: Alex Caruso is Oklahoma City Thunder’s veteran X-factor in NBA Finals run





Alex Caruso never asked for the spotlight — but during the 2025 NBA Finals, it found him anyway. On Friday night, June 13, at Gainbridge Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, the 31-year-old guard delivered another pivotal performance for the Oklahoma City Thunder, tallying 20 points and five steals off the bench in a season-defining Game 4 win over the Indiana Pacers. For a player who was undrafted and once overlooked, this postseason surge has fans dubbing him OKC’s unlikely superhero. Just don’t expect him to call himself Batman.When asked after Game 4 if he was aware of the superhero status fans have given him, Alex Caruso smiled and brushed it off with trademark humility.“For the superhero reference, we’ll just do Robin,” he said. “That’s the only one I can probably make some similarities to. I’ve got better players around me that are doing more.”It’s classic Caruso — grounded, selfless, and laser-focused. But there’s no denying his Finals impact. The veteran guard, who played a crucial role alongside LeBron James during the 2020 Los Angeles Lakers championship run, has found new life in Oklahoma City . He scored 20 points in Game 2 and matched it in Game 4 — the two wins that have kept OKC alive in the series.His Game 4 effort was one for the history books.No player had ever come off the bench in an NBA Finals game and recorded 20 points and five steals — until Friday, when Caruso did exactly that.“He’s a competitive monster, clearly,” Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said afterward. “He’s proven that time and again over his career. Certainly in these playoffs... I can’t say enough about him as a competitor.”At 31, Caruso is the oldest player in a young Thunder locker room. But rather than slow him down, that experience has only sharpened his edge — and his leadership. Forward Cason Wallace summed it up: “He plays the game, he thinks the game, and he’s also coaching the game all at the same time. He’s always a few steps ahead.”Back in Los Angeles, LeBron James called Caruso “a Swiss Army knife — he can do it all.” That praise still echoes, and in Oklahoma City, it rings truer than ever.“It just comes down to really wanting to win,” Caruso said Friday night in Indianapolis. “That’s why my career is the way it is. That’s why I’m still in the NBA. That’s why I’m here talking to you right now.”His rise hasn’t been traditional. Undrafted out of Texas A&M, Caruso once couldn’t even land a summer league invite from the Dallas Mavericks — a move Indiana Pacers head coach Rick Carlisle, who was in Dallas at the time, now regrets.“Some of these guys that go under the radar have that level of grit and determination,” Carlisle said before Game 4. “And that’s what gets them to the league and gives them longevity.”Also Read: “This is peak male performance” — Alex Caruso’s bold wardrobe choice goes viral as fans react hilariously ahead of Indiana Pacers vs. Oklahoma City Thunder NBA Finals Game 1 Caruso may never wear the cape, but he’s proving just how powerful the right sidekick can be.

Caitlin Clark’s elite shot-making fuels a statement win over the New York Liberty





Caitlin Clark is back. Her return was one of the highly anticipated events in recent times, and the Indiana Fever fans got to see high-octane action on the court from their favorite star. Caitlin Clark returned to the Indiana Fever lineup with a vengeance on Saturday, delivering one of the most electric performances. Facing the previously undefeated New York Liberty at Gainbridge Fieldhouse, Clark reminded the basketball world exactly why she’s the face of the league’s new era. Her 32-point explosion, complemented by a jaw-dropping barrage of deep threes, lifted the Fever to a commanding 102-88 victory, breaking New York’s perfect record. It was also a stern signal that Clark's full-throttle return from a quad injury, which had sidelined her for three weeks, was underway.In her first game back after missing five straight contests with a strained left quad, Caitlin Clark didn’t hesitate to take charge. She opened the game firing, scoring 14 points in the first quarter on 5-of-7 shooting. But it was her stunning sequence in the closing moments of the frame that truly flipped the game’s energy.Clark knocked down three three-pointers in a mere 38 seconds, two of which came from beyond the 30-foot mark, sending the home crowd into a frenzy.By the final buzzer, Clark had piled up 32 points, 9 assists, 8 rebounds, and 2 blocks in just 31 minutes of action. She hit 7 of her 14 attempts from beyond the arc, many of them from well behind the line, torching the Liberty’s defense and setting the tone for the Fever’s most complete win of the season.Ahead of the game, Clark made her intentions known loud and clear. “Why would I be out there to play 20 minutes?” she told reporters. “I’m out there to win and give everything I have for this team.”The energy didn’t go unnoticed outside of Indianapolis either. LeBron James , watching from afar after the Lakers’ early playoff exit, took to Instagram after Clark’s dominant showing, replying to her celebratory post with a simple but telling comment: “Welcome back!!!!”Chris Paul also chimed in during the game.

Lobo Predicted It, Again: South Africa’s Historic WTC Win vs Australia





As the cameras panned to the Lord’s balcony, the entire South African team was celebrating, barring one man, Temba Bavuma . The Black captain of the South African Test team — a team once regarded as a prized possession of the whites, in a nation divided by colour had his face in his palms.He was trying to soak in the moment. He may not have visualised this in his wildest dreams when he was growing up as a cricketer on the outskirts of Cape Town. The skipper could easily have walked out of the field on Friday evening with a hamstring pull, but he didn’t.Years down the line, when this victory will be discussed, Aiden Markram ’s name will keep cropping up for what he did with the bat in a difficult chase. But all those who endured the roller-coaster of the WTC final for four days will remember Bavuma’s 134-ball vigil on virtually one leg.Remember, Bavuma probably wasn’t everyone’s No. 1 choice as South Africa captain, just as Siya Kolisi wasn’t when the Springboks the pride of white South Africa in those years of Apartheid won the 2019 Rugby World Cup. Kolisi didn’t stop there, he went on to join a select group of rugby captains to win the World Cup back-to-back in 2023.These triumphs, the first being the 1995 Rugby World Cup immortalized by the 2009 Clint Eastwood film Invictus, in which Morgan Freeman played Nelson Mandela — have meant way more than just a win on the sports field.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? While Mandela used rugby as a unification tool in a country torn by racism, success on the cricket pitch was always considered a given for a nation blessed with incredible talent.Just before they got banned from international cricket, an all-white South African team consisting of the likes of Mike Procter, Barry Richards and Peter Pollock had whitewashed a powerful Australia 4-0. On their return on Nov 10, 1991 at Eden Gardens Kolkata in an ODI against India, the world was wowed by the magnificent Allan Donald.Come every World Cup, South Africa start as one of the favourites, till something other-wordly struck. While in 1992 it was the rain-rule that turned a chase of 22 runs off 13 balls to a bizarre 22 runs off one ball due to a five-minute spell of rain, in 1996 it was a brilliant Brian Lara innings in the quarters.In 1999, Hansie Cronje’s South Africa were the best team for most parts of the tournament till the magic of Shane Warne and a last-over choke by Lance Klusener and Donald finished a dream.The choker’s tag fell firmly on the South Africans and India were the beneficiaries just about a year ago in Barbados. Needing 30 off 30 in the T20 World Cup final, a South African team that hadn’t put a foot wrong till then in the tournament, messed it up as Suryakumar Yadav’s catch of the century in the last over won Rohit Sharma’s boys the title.Long after that game was over, as India celebrated, the South Africans didn’t leave the ground. One could see them sitting in their balcony, staring at India’s moment of triumph.Probably they were internalizing the hurt promising themselves that there will be a rainbow at the end of the tunnel. At a sun-soaked Lord’s on Saturday, however, they did keep their tryst with destiny","Temba Bavuma's 134-ball vigil on virtually one leg was crucial.

2025 highlights: Familiar faces and dramatic falls



Is it just madness or tradition





Every year on a steep hill in Gloucestershire, England, hundreds gather to chase a rolling 7-pound wheel of Double Gloucester cheese down a dangerously steep slope. Known as the Cooper’s Hill Cheese Rolling Contest, the event is chaotic, absurd, and completely thrilling. With participants tumbling, somersaulting, and crashing their way to the bottom, the headline “People sprint to catch a 7-pound wheel of cheese” is technically accurate, but it doesn’t quite capture the madness, tradition, and injuries that define this bizarre British spectacle. So, is it a good headline? That depends on what you’re hoping to convey.The Cheese Rolling Contest is an annual event held on Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth, Gloucestershire. Dating back at least two centuries, and possibly much longer, the race involves competitors hurtling down a 200-yard slope after a large wheel of cheese. The goal? Be the first to reach the bottom and claim the cheese as a prize. It sounds simple, but the event is notorious for its steep incline, dangerous tumbles, and frequent injuries.The hill is so steep that it's nearly impossible to stay upright. Most participants end up tumbling head over heels, colliding with each other or the ground.Gravity takes over quickly, and the cheese, reaching speeds of up to 70 mph, is almost never actually caught. Still, competitors willingly risk sprains, fractures, and concussions for a shot at glory and a round of cheese.This year, German YouTuber Tom Kopke claimed victory for the second year in a row. Shirtless and triumphant, he declared, “I risked my life for this. It’s my cheese. Back to back.” On the women’s side, Ava Sender Logan from London tumbled repeatedly but emerged victorious, saying, “It felt quite long coming down and then I hit my head. I’m fine.” Around them, spectators packed the woods and fences for a glimpse of the chaos.While the event may seem absurd to outsiders, for locals and returning participants, it’s a point of pride and cultural identity. Despite calls to regulate or cancel it over safety concerns, the contest continues to thrive, drawing international competitors and media attention. Volunteers, medics, and long-time residents treat it as an important local tradition","The Cheese Rolling Contest is an annual event held on Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth, Gloucestershire.

Dwight Howard and Lance Stephenson’s fiery BIG3 opener spirals out of control







The opening weekend of the 2025 BIG3 season took a shocking turn when former NBA stars Dwight Howard and Lance Stephenson were ejected after a physical altercation erupted during Saturday’s matchup between the LA Riot and Miami 305. What began as a competitive debut for both players quickly turned into a full-blown brawl that spilled into the crowd in the league’s highly anticipated season opener.Tensions had been simmering throughout the game, but they finally boiled over in the closing minutes. After a series of physical plays, Lance Stephenson raised his hand toward Dwight Howard’s chest during a heated exchange. Howard reacted instantly, shoving the arm aside and stepping into Stephenson’s space. Moments later, the two locked up and fell out of bounds, with the scuffle carrying them into the crowd near the media area.The fight was intense. Howard had Stephenson in a headlock, while Stephenson dragged him into the first few rows of seats before officials and security intervened. Both players were immediately ejected, and the game resumed without them. Miami ultimately secured a 50-44 win, finishing off the contest with a layup by Mario Chalmers.This wasn’t Stephenson’s only run-in of the night. Earlier in the game, he had an aggressive exchange with Jordan Crawford, who appeared to poke him in the nose. Stephenson responded by throwing a punch, though he remained in the game at that point.Saturday marked the BIG3 debuts for both players. Howard, now 39, is fresh off a stint overseas and is set to be inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame later this year. During his 18-year NBA career, he earned eight All-Star selections, won Defensive Player of the Year three times, and captured a title with the Lakers in 2020. Stephenson, 34, played 10 NBA seasons with nine different franchises, most notably the Pacers, where he built a reputation for his aggressive, high-energy play.Howard finished with 10 points and seven rebounds before being tossed, while Stephenson led his squad with 16 points, three rebounds, and an assist.Also Read: Caitlin Clark dismantles New York Liberty with stunning shooting spree in her comeback masterclass With the BIG3 now featuring eight new teams and a 10-week sprint toward a $1 million championship prize, the league hoped to focus on star power and competition.

'Nitish Kumar is a guy who can bowl that magic ball': India bowling coach Morne Morkel

'Cricketers Aren’t Cattle... ': Harish Thawani on the IPL and Business of Indian Cricket





The Indian cricket team will conduct their final preparations for the upcoming five-match Test series against England through an intra-squad warm-up game against India A, starting June 13, 2025. The four-day practice match, which will be played behind closed doors at the request of head coach Gautam Gambhir, will not be available for live streaming as the team aims to keep their tactical plans private from the opposition.The warm-up fixture will feature 360 overs of match simulation, providing crucial preparation time for both bowlers and batsmen. This approach mirrors the team's preparation strategy implemented before the Border Gavaskar Trophy 2024-25 in Australia.The practice match holds particular significance as it offers Indian players an opportunity to transition from T20 cricket in the Indian Premier League (IPL) to the longer format. The extended session will help players adapt to English conditions before the series opener at Headingley.Jasprit Bumrah's return to Test cricket after a six-month hiatus will be closely monitored during the warm-up game. The pace spearhead, who had to leave the fifth Test in Australia due to injury, has only participated in IPL matches since recovering from a back stress fracture.The team management plans to assess Bumrah's fitness and form by having him bowl multiple spells during the practice match. This evaluation will be crucial in determining his readiness for the demanding Test series.The warm-up game will also help resolve selection dilemmas facing the team. A key decision revolves around choosing a seam bowling partner for Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj, with Akash Deep and Prasidh Krishna being the contenders.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Another strategic choice awaits the team management regarding the spin department. The selection between Ravindra Jadeja and Kuldeep Yadav as the primary spinner presents different tactical advantages. Jadeja offers additional batting depth along with his spinning abilities, while Kuldeep could serve as an attacking option against England's aggressive batting approach.The practice match marks a significant milestone as it represents Shubman Gill 's first assignment as the official captain of the Indian Test team. The closed-door session will allow the new captain to work with his team without external pressure.The decision to conduct the warm-up match away from public view reflects the team's focus on preparation rather than publicity. This approach allows players to concentrate on acclimatization and strategy development without revealing their tactical plans to their upcoming opponents.The Test series against England, scheduled to begin on June 20, will be the first major challenge for the Indian team under Gill's leadership. The warm-up match serves as the final opportunity for the team to address various tactical and selection questions before the series commences.The comprehensive nature of the practice match, with its extensive over allocation, demonstrates the team's commitment to thorough preparation. This format ensures that all squad members get adequate time to adjust to the demands of Test cricket and English conditions.The practice match represents a crucial phase in India's preparation strategy, combining the need for match practice with tactical discretion. The outcome of these four days could significantly influence the team's approach and composition for the upcoming Test series against England.","The Indian cricket team will conduct their final preparations for the upcoming five-match Test series against England through an intra-squad warm-up game against India A, starting June 13, 2025.

Former England skipper Kevin Pietersen has hailed Aiden Markram 's match-winning century against Australia at Lord's as the greatest innings ever played by a South African batter in Test cricket, placing the Proteas opener's gritty knock above all others in the country's long red-ball history.Markram scored a sublime 136 off 207 balls in the fourth innings to help South Africa chase down 282 and beat Australia by five wickets in the World Test Championship final — ending their 27-year-long wait for an ICC title.""Probably the best innings any South African batter has ever played in Test match cricket,"" Pietersen, a pundit on JioStar, declared. ""It might not go down as the most attacking or entertaining, but when you factor in the expectation, the stage, and the pressure after failing in the first innings, it was extraordinary.""Praising Markram's mental strength, Pietersen added, ""He lost Rickelton early, yet still went on to produce something truly magnificent. When your country is counting on you and you have to deliver — that pressure is immense.""Pace spearhead Kagiso Rabada , who took a nine-wicket match haul, called Markram a ""big-match player"" and praised his composure under pressure. ""His presence, the way he dominated his space, and stuck to his game plan without wavering was just brilliant,"" Rabada said.""It wasn't a pitch where you could be loose. He handled all their plans, traps — off-side, leg-side — with amazing focus.""Former fast bowler Dale Steyn also lavished praise on the team's performance. ""Rabada, Starc, Cummins — big names delivered, but Markram and Bavuma finishing it off made it special.

“Goat was on to something”: Kevin Durant’s bold reaction to resurfaced Michael Jordan clip

Image via Instagram

Resurfaced video reveals Michael Jordan’s true pick for the best player



Michael Jordan chooses between LeBron & Kobe





Kevin Durant rarely misses when it comes to basketball—and apparently, not when it comes to legacy debates either. The Phoenix Suns superstar recently came across a resurfaced Michael Jordan clip that’s catching fire again on social media. In the video, Jordan jokingly mentions Durant while weighing in on the infamous Kobe Bryant vs. LeBron James question. Now, more than a decade later, Durant’s sharp but playful response has reignited the conversation, with fans and media alike taking notice.It all started when a throwback clip from 2013 began circulating across social platforms this week. In it, NBA legend Michael Jordan is asked one of basketball’s most heated questions: Kobe or LeBron? Sitting down with analyst Ahmad Rashad for the “Michael Jordan at 50” special, Jordan seemed momentarily caught off guard before throwing out an unexpected name: “Kevin Durant.”Though Jordan immediately laughed and clarified that he was joking—“Naw, I’m just kidding,” he said—the clip has lived on in NBA lore as a light-hearted but fascinating moment. And this week, it got new life when Durant himself saw the post and added fuel to the fire.“Goat was on to something,” Durant wrote in the comments section, flipping the joke into a subtle flex that left fans buzzing. Kevin Durant , who turns 37 this year and will enter his 18th NBA season, is widely recognized as one of the most skilled scorers in league history.The two-time NBA champion and two-time Finals MVP has averaged 27.2 points per game across his career while maintaining an elite shooting clip of over 50%. With that kind of resume, even a joke from Jordan feels like a nod worth keeping in the vault.The moment drew even more attention thanks to another clip included in the video—this one featuring a resurfaced quote from Kobe Bryant that added weight to the conversation. “Kevin Durant. That was the one I retired without being able to figure out how I can stop him,” Bryant once admitted. That rare praise from one all-time great to another only added gravity to Durant’s reaction.The viral interview dates back to early 2013, when Michael Jordan was reflecting on his legacy ahead of his 50th birthday. The special, titled “Michael Jordan at 50,” gave the six-time NBA champion a chance to weigh in on the league’s future—and the players most often compared to him.When asked “Kobe or LeBron?” by Rashad, Jordan initially responded with a smirk and said “Kevin Durant” before laughing it off. Then, he gave a more measured answer.“In terms of dominance of the game of basketball, at this stage it’s LeBron,” Jordan acknowledged at the time, crediting James for his physical impact on the game during his Miami Heat prime.But Jordan wasn’t done. He added a clear preference for Bryant’s mentality and hunger.“Championship-wise, it’s Kobe Bryant . He wants it so bad and he’s willing to go to the extreme,” Jordan said. “Guarding a point guard at the age of 34, playing 38 minutes, 40 minutes, that’s ludicrous.”Jordan even suggested that Bryant shared his obsessive drive for greatness: “He’s cursed as much as I am.”When it came to championships—a standard Jordan always held in the highest regard—he summed it up plainly: “Five (rings) beats one.”More than a decade later, the Kobe vs. LeBron debate remains heated—but the narrative has evolved. LeBron James , who joined the Lakers in 2018, now holds four championship rings and recently became the NBA’s all-time leading scorer, the first player ever to surpass 50,000 career points. His longevity and all-around excellence have kept him in the GOAT conversation.Bryant, who tragically passed away in 2020, remains a symbol of competitive spirit. He finished his career with five rings and a 5–2 record in the Finals, while Jordan, famously, went 6–0.Also Read: LeBron James or Kobe Bryant? Dwight Howard’s shocking pick in the legendary NBA debate between his two former teammates What began as a quick-witted joke from Jordan in a 2013 interview has taken on new life in 2025, especially now that Durant has joined the chat. With Kobe openly praising Durant’s unguardable game, and Jordan once (even jokingly) tossing his name into the GOAT conversation, Durant’s legacy is secure.","Kevin Durant responded to a resurfaced Michael Jordan clip from 2013.

The Trade Mechanics: Jonathan Kuminga for Collins





Theare reportedly considering a bold sign-and-trade deal to acquire ex- Atlanta Hawks forward John Collins, potentially sending young star Jonathan Kuminga the other way. This move aims to address the Warriors’ glaring need for consistent scoring beyond Stephen Curry. Golden State Warriors ’ lack of reliable scorers outside Curry was exposed in their 2025 Western Conference Semi-Finals loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves. While Kuminga showed flashes of brilliance, his restricted free agency status makes him a prime trade asset for a team seeking an immediate upgrade.The Jazz, meanwhile, are open to trading Collins after he opts into his $26.5 million expiring contract. As reported by Evan Sidery: ""The Jazz plan to explore trade scenarios for John Collins once he opts into his $26.5 million expiring contract. Collins averaged 18.9 points and 8.2 rebounds on a 62.8 TS% with Utah this season.""John Collins brings a mix of athleticism, floor spacing, and efficiency that could elevate the Golden State Warriors’ offense. Here’s how his 2024-25 stats stack up:His ability to stretch the floor and finish plays aligns perfectly with Golden State’s drive-and-kick system. Pairing Collins with Stephen Curry could create mismatches and open up the offense even further.Here’s why this deal makes sense for both sides:- Warriors Get: A proven scorer who fits their system, adding much-needed firepower.- Jazz Get: A young, high-upside player in Kuminga to build around for the future.Collins’ expiring $26.5 million contract could be matched via a sign-and-trade involving Kuminga, who is due for a new deal. Utah nearly traded Collins in February, and Golden State might finally pull the trigger.What This Means for the Golden State Warriors’ FutureAdding Collins could rejuvenate Golden State’s title hopes. His efficiency and versatility would take pressure off Curry, while Kuminga’s departure would be a calculated risk for a team in win-now mode.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers predicted to sign $238 million Utah Jazz to for Big 3 with LeBron James and Luka Doncic and bolster title odds If this trade materializes, the Warriors could re-emerge as a serious contender in the loaded Western Conference.","The Golden State Warriors are reportedly considering a bold sign-and-trade deal to acquire ex-Atlanta Hawks forward John Collins.

is managing lower leg discomfort but has no doubts about suiting up for Game 3 of the NBA Finals against the Oklahoma City Thunder. Despite visible limping after Sunday’s 123-107 loss, Haliburton remains confident he’ll be ready when the series resumes Wednesday night.The Indiana Pacers and Thunder are tied 1-1, with Game 3 tipping off at 8:30 p.m. ET in Indianapolis. Tyrese Haliburton, averaging 15.5 points and six assists in the series, acknowledged the injury but downplayed its severity.“It’s really just a lower leg thing, I’m gonna leave it at that,” Tyrese Haliburton said Tuesday. “I don’t think there’s anything more to elaborate.”Though he didn’t specify whether the issue was related to his calf or ankle, Haliburton’s history of hamstring problems—including a strain that sidelined him during last year’s Eastern Conference finals—raises questions about his durability. Still, neither he nor the Indiana Pacers appear overly concerned.Head coach Rick Carlisle confirmed Haliburton participated fully in Tuesday’s practice and expects him to play. “At this time of year, I don’t know if anybody’s feeling perfect,” Carlisle said. “He has some discomfort, but each day is getting better. This is the time of year where it just doesn’t get any better than this.”Beyond health, Tyrese Haliburton’s bigger challenge has been Oklahoma City’s elite defense.The Thunder, the NBA’s top-rated defensive team this season, have thrown multiple defenders at him, including Luguentz Dort, Cason Wallace, Alex Caruso, and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.The strategy has worked so far. Haliburton has struggled with efficiency, shooting just 33% from three and averaging four turnovers per game. His assist-to-turnover ratio, usually stellar at nearly 9:1, has dipped significantly.“I feel like I haven’t been great by any means through the first two games,” Haliburton admitted. “I’m just trying to take what I can to prepare for Game 3. The answers always lie in the film.”Indiana’s turnover issues have been a major storyline. The team has coughed up the ball 40 times in two games, with many mistakes leading directly to Thunder points. Carlisle joked about some of the miscues, saying, “Some of our turnovers have been so violently bad, the opponent hasn’t even had a chance to catch the ball.”But the problem is no laughing matter. Against a disciplined team like Oklahoma City, wasted possessions are costly. “You can’t play too careful against them, or otherwise you’ll never get a basket,” Carlisle added.Carlisle also mentioned that a couple of other players are “slightly under the weather,” though he didn’t name them. Forward Aaron Nesmith (ankle) and center Tony Bradley (hip) have dealt with injuries earlier in the playoffs, but their status for Game 3 remains unclear.With the series shifting to Indianapolis, Tyrese Haliburton and the Indiana Pacers have a chance to regain control. His ability to shake off the leg discomfort and solve Oklahoma City’s defensive schemes will be key to Indiana’s title hopes.Also read: Skip Bayless’ Drops Bombshell After OKC Thunder Game 2 Domination – Can the Indiana Pacers Respond?

49ers’ Trent Williams believes Brock Purdy is just getting started



Trent Williams is all in on Brock Purdy being the 49ers franchise QB





When Trent Williams, the San Francisco 49ers’ legendary left tackle, took the podium earlier this week, his usual charisma lit up the room — but it was the mention of Brock Purdy’s new contract that brought out a different kind of joy. With a grin stretching ear to ear, Williams spoke with genuine pride about the quarterback’s journey from an overlooked draft pick to one of the NFL’s highest-paid players.“For me, it’s just super, super fulfilling just to watch a guy like Brock,” Trent Williams shared. “You talk about a Cinderella story, I think this is the epitome of that. A guy going from making a few hundred thousand a year to making 50 million a year, it’s astronomical, and it couldn’t have happened to a better guy.”Purdy’s meteoric rise began in 2022 when he was selected with the final pick of the draft — No. 262 overall. Thrust into action in Week 13 after Jimmy Garoppolo's injury, the unassuming rookie guided the 49ers to a commanding 33-17 win over the Miami Dolphins. The following week, he was named the starter — and never looked back.Since then, Purdy has carried San Francisco to back-to-back NFC Championship Games and a Super Bowl appearance.Despite a rocky 2024 season, where the team stumbled to a 6-11 record and missed the playoffs, confidence in Purdy hasn’t wavered inside the 49ers’ locker room. Both head coach Kyle Shanahan and GM John Lynch have stood firmly behind him — and Williams is no different.“He is the guy for this team,” Williams declared. “He is the guy for this franchise. This is just the tip of the iceberg. He is going to get another contract, he’s going to win a lot of football games. He’s that good of a player. Super, super happy to see that for him. I love him like a brother, so I couldn’t be any happier.”This offseason, Purdy signed a five-year, $265 million extension, securing his place with the 49ers through the 2030 season. Although initial negotiations were rocky — with Purdy reportedly seeking $65 million per year — the final agreement landed at $53 million annually, including $182.55 million in guarantees. It's a significant bet on a quarterback who still has plenty to prove, especially after a step back statistically in 2024 (3,864 yards, 20 TDs, 12 INTs).Purdy now faces the challenge of leading a restructured team, with several key departures in free agency. However, he can rest easy knowing his blindside remains secure. Williams, now 37 and still playing at an elite level, has no plans to retire. He’s under contract through 2026 after signing a three-year, $82.66 million extension and has expressed interest in playing into his 40s.As the 49ers prepare for the 2025 season, both Purdy and Williams enter with full health and high hopes. And if Williams' smile is any indication, the team’s belief in their quarterback is stronger than ever.Also Read: ""She makes everything easier"": Josh Allen’s romantic line after marrying Hailee Steinfeld proves he’s winning both on and off the field","Brock Purdy signed a five-year, $265 million contract extension with the San Francisco 49ers.

Despite Utah’s reluctance to move him in previous seasons, another underwhelming campaign might push them to reconsider.As Ivan White of the Sporting News notes in the original report: ""Utah has been unwilling to involve him in serious trade talks over the past couple of years, but another season of uncompetitive basketball might have been enough to change its mind.""Dallas has multiple pathways to acquire the Finnish forward:- Mavericks Receive: Lauri Markkanen- Jazz Receive: P.J.

Peek-a-boo! Sneak-peek! Into the Buffalo Bills’ handsome-handsome star quarterback Josh Allen’s insane aura! Is there a better-looking quarterback than him? No, right! Especially the glow that comes after a wedding? Mr. Steinfeld now. The official X account of the Buffalo Bills shared a few ravishing snapshots of their leading man, and fans have been gushing over him ever since! But wait, with that handsome face? All their focus went to the new, new wedding ring! And let’s zoom & enhance on that finger - wrote a fan and shared a closeup view of the wedding ring. For some, it’s silver. For many, it’s gold. But for Josh Allen? It’s a black wedding band! Why so? Let’s dig in to find out.Now, there could be many reasons for choosing a black wedding ring. The 2024 NFL season MVP probably chose a black wedding ring to signify strength, commitment, power, resilience, elegance, authority, mystery, maturity, wisdom, depth, transformation, and sophistication.Above all these heavy words, Josh Allen probably just wanted to have something that would be durable and require less maintenance than the high-on-maintenance gold and silver jewelry.If that sounds cheap, then maybe Allen just wanted to be different! Away from the crowd who fall for silver and gold wedding rings and adapt to the everyday norm of marriage. Oh, married? That silver/gold ring on the hand gave it away!If this too, sounds cliche, then the last guess would be - a black wedding ring goes with any and every attire! Allen might not have to think of the whole attire before wearing that wedding ring - if it were a gold or silver one, he’d have to match it with gold or silver attire or something subtly relating to them.But with a black wedding band? Right from casual to classy, from jersey to formal, from swimwear to pajamas - a black wedding ring goes with any and every apparel!The video is 17 seconds long. I see what you did there - noticed a fan! “17” is the jersey number of the 3-time Pro Bowler. But fans also observed that Josh Allen had the shortest honeymoon ever. The 29-year-old quarterback married the 28-year-old Sinners actress Hailee Steinfeld on May 31. And on June 10? He was back to work. “Short hunny moon” - wrote a fan. But other fans? They loved the fact that their NFL MVP was back to the gridiron. One wrote, “Newly wed Allen reporting for duty,” while another said, “We are so gonna win the Superbowl.” A third fan cheered on saying, “You're back to the regular logo. Thank you. Also, 17 is going to annihilate this year.”","NFL MVP Josh Allen opts for a black wedding ring over a silver or gold wedding ring - to signify power, strength, commitment, elegance, and resilience.

Kyrie Irving defends Karl-Anthony Towns amid staggering criticism







Although on-court rivals, Dallas Mavericks’ Kyrie Irving and New York Knicks standout Karl-Anthony Towns have been friends. Recently, Irving gave a shout-out to his brotherly pal Towns while slamming fans for the unending criticism directed at the Knicks superstar. The Knicks lost their championship dream following elimination by the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals, and after that, KAT was under immense criticism for his gameplay during the Eastern Conference Finals.Dallas Mavericks point guard/ shooting guard Kyrie Irving has had enough as he came out in defense of his friend Karl-Anthony Towns amid swirling criticism. “Y’all gotta stop making fun of my brother KA. I’m done with y’all. It’s so unfair,” Irving recently said.“So f***ing wrap, I’m letting y’all know, if you repost that shit again, meme him up, I’m attacking. Not like that physically, GTA, but Imma attack, alright?” the Mavs standout warned.“Y’all gotta leave KAT alone, okay? Cuz y’all don’t know what is like to grow up in Jersey and have all of these cultures that you are a part of, trust me on that. Jersey is literally, 130 miles long, it is very very small state.But when I get back to my point, I’m just sayin’, leave him alone, alright? Because he’s Dominican, he’s black, he grew up in certain area in Jersey, just like me, and you gotta survive out here. You have many different demographics of people, so, you gotta survive out here,” he added.Irving continued, “I don’t agree all the time when he be changing up his tone sometime, I don’t always agree on all of those s*it, you know what I mean, that’s should be funny. But on a serious note, he is my brother and I will protect him all the time.”Karl-Anthony Towns has taken serious heat after the Knicks’ playoff run ended in five games against the Pacers. While he did struggle on defense, especially in key moments, Towns still showed up when it mattered with strong rebounding and clutch offense late in games. That hasn’t stopped fans and media from making him the top target for blame in New York.Tensions grew after The Athletic reported that some Knicks teammates had frustrations with Towns throughout the season. Despite playing a big role in getting New York to the Eastern Conference Finals, the criticism has only fueled talk of a possible trade.Also Read: Vanessa Bryant stuns courtside in fiery red ensemble during NYC WNBA outing with daughters As for the Mavericks, the team took a major hit when All-Star guard Kyrie Irving tore his ACL in March.
