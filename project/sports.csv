77th Republic Day Parade to Witness Debut of DRDO’s Hypersonic Anti-Ship Missile

.

NEW DELHI: At the Rashtriya Rangshala Camp in Delhi Cantonment, the days leading up to Jan 26 are marked by constant activity. The smell of fresh paint hangs heavy in the air as the sound of construction echo across the parade ground. Artisans climb makeshift stairways, painters add final touches and workers carefully align massive structures.Amid this controlled bustle, Republic Day tableaux are taking shape, with every frame, colour and detail preparing to tell captivating stories on Kartavya Path.This year's Jan 26 parade marks 150 years of Vande Mataram, and its spirit runs through every creation. On Thursday, TOI witnessed around 30 tableaux in different stages of completion, each reflecting India's past, present and its aspirations. Nearly 10,000 people will soon watch them roll along Kartavya Path, while 2,500 artistes are set to perform, capping the visual spectacle on wheels.One of the most striking displays is a tableau titled 'Operation Sindoor: Victory Through Jointness', which highlights India's military strength, with Rafale jets and Akash missiles on display. Nearby, Gujarat's tableau traces the journey of India from 1906 to 1947 under the theme of 'Vande Mataram', its structure anchored by a towering figure of Mahatma Gandhi.Delhi's tableau pays tribute to the Prime Ministers' Museum while showcasing the capital's transformed skyline, featuring the new Parliament, Bharat Mandapam, Signature Bridge and Yashobhoomi as symbols of a changing nation.Other states, too, have brought their landscapes and legacies vividly to life. Bihar's tableau follows the journey of makhana - from pond to plate. ""It took one month to make this whole thing,"" a carpenter said. Himachal Pradesh is honouring its 1,203 gallantry award winners and Punjab is reflecting the spiritual courage of Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur through their tableaux.Ladakh showcases the engineering feat of Shyok Tunnel, Uttarakhand displays its traditional instruments and utensils, while J&K recreates the charm of a houseboat. Dancers from Tamil Nadu will perform mayilattam, also known as peacock dance. ""A team of 17 members is here from Chennai to perform,"" said Jyotsana, adjusting her costume with a smile. Parasmal Solanki from Rajasthan will perform along with his 16-member team.Nagaland's tableau features a massive hornbill. ""We want everyone to know about Hornbill Festival,"" said Yangerla, a folk dancer. Jharkhand's tableau showcases the state's natural beauty and aims at attracting tourists, said Neha Agarwal, a state representative.Karnataka's tableau, From Millets to Microchips, tells a story of holistic growth through scenes of a farmer family with millets, silicon crystals, a robot and a giant microchip - linking agriculture with technology and innovation. Assam has transformed terracotta into visual poetry. Chhattisgarh's tableau pays homage to tribal heroes like Veer Gunda Dhur and Veer Narayan Singh.Union ministries have added their own narratives. The education tableau traces the evolution of India's knowledge from Aryabhatta's shunya (zero) to PM Shri schools. ""All my team members and I are from different Kendriya Vidyalayas,"" said Elix Singh, a Class XI student.A unique tableau designed by filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali for the ministry of information and broadcasting depicts the evolution of storytelling - from its oral tradition to cinema. The panchayati raj tableau in the vicinity highlights the SVAMITA scheme.On Republic Day, these individual pieces will come together to form a moving portrait of India, diverse in expression and united in purpose.","This year's Jan 26 parade marks 150 years of Vande Mataram, and its spirit runs through every creation.

Triple talaq-halala FIR puts focus on legal grey area,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/triple-talaq-halala-fir-puts-focus-on-legal-grey-area/articleshow/127206877.cms,".

NEW DELHI: When police in UP registered an FIR on Dec 9, 2025, it was not just another complaint under the 2019 Triple Talaq law. The allegations were shocking and went further, into a grey zone the law has never squarely addressed: What happens to women after talaq is pronounced.According to the FIR filed in Amroha’s Said Nagli, the woman, after being divorced through instant triple talaq, was pressured by her husband, her brother-in-law and clerics to undergo “ halala ” multiple times so she could be returned to the marriage. An exception that permits a divorced Muslim couple to remarry, the practice of halala often involves planned, short-term marriages — even arranged one-time encounters — to facilitate consummation of the woman with another man, enabling the former couple to reunite.The woman’s complaint detailed the ordeal. She said she was “gang-raped under false pretenses of halala carried out under threats, intimidation and coercion”.Police have invoked the law banning instant triple talaq — sections 3 and 4 of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019. Multiple provisions and relevant sections of BNS that deal with rape, aggravated hurt, criminal intimidation and criminal conspiracy, have also been added.In the initial FIR, there are three accused: Her husband, his cousin and a hakim (traditional healer.) Since then, police have added more accused to the list.Amroha police told TOI that one accused — her husband — had been arrested so far. “The FIR has been registered on the basis of a written complaint. Further action will depend on corroboration and evidence,” SHO Vikas Sahrawat said. Amroha police are on the lookout for others on the run, he added.This week, based on Zubaida’s (name changed) age at the time of her marriage, police added multiple provisions of the Pocso Act to the FIR, expanding its scope. (The move, incidentally, also brings into focus an unresolved legal grey area, as Muslim personal law is not codified and does not prescribe a minimum age, instead linking marriageability to puberty. The issue remains unsettled by the Supreme Court so far, with courts in different states taking conflicting positions. )The FIR covers several years of alleged abuse, assault and rape. Zubeida told police she was forcefully married off in 2015 at the age of 15, and subjected to pronouncements of instant triple talaq twice — once in 2016, and again in 2021, followed by three coerced reconciliation attempts through halala.“I felt like I was being handed over every time. I was too ashamed to come out with what had happened to me. I didn’t want my daughter to grow up reading about it,” Zubaida told TOI. A former student of one of Aligarh’s top schools, Zubaida comes from a family with a history in public service — her grandfather was DSP in UP police and her father a lawyer.After the first triple talaq in 2016, she said she was told she could return to her husband only after undergoing halala, a process that, according to her complaint, involved sexual assault by someone introduced as an “intermediary”.In Feb 2025, she said she was told she would need to follow the halala process twice as her marriage had broken down twice by then. Zubaida’s complaint said after years of being a single mother and financial difficulties, she had once again fallen for the accused’s false promise of remarriage. “It was after a long time that I realised what had happened to me was wrong,” Zubaida said.With her husband now behind bars, Zubaida said she was struggling to keep life going for her daughter.Her husband, meanwhile, has alleged that he was harassed and threatened by Zubaida and her relatives. In his written complaint, dated Nov 26, 2025, he claimed that Zubaida “tried to forcibly enter his house and threatened him with false criminal cases”.Earlier in 2021, according to documents, Zubaida’s divorce was finalised through a family court’s decree, with the court placing the daughter’s custody with the father at the time.Halala finds no mention in Indian statutory law. The 2019 Muslim Women Act criminalised instant triple talaq, making its pronouncement a punishable offence, but it did not — and does not — recognise halala.According to activists, halala cases rarely leave a paper trail. Fear of stigma, economic dependence and concerns about children often keep victims silent.“In many cases, women don’t even know that what is being done to them is wrong,” said Zakia Soman, Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan founder. “Halala is not mentioned in the Quran. It survives through misinterpretation, patriarchal control and silence. There is a hush-hush around it. For a woman to come forward takes extraordinary courage.”Soman added that the practice survived in pockets, operating through informal and largely invisible set-ups. “Triple talaq was criminalised on paper, but the ecosystem that sustained it was never dismantled. Without regulations, halala survives as an unpoliced, underground arrangement,” she said.Soman cited cases where clerics themselves offered to “perform” halala, and others where women were passed between men to settle personal disputes, family feuds or even debts — arrangements that remain largely hidden unless a woman breaks ranks and approaches the police. Soman said practices such as halala, child marriage and puberty-as-marriage-age thrive in a legal grey zone.Experts point to structural gaps that make such cases hard to prosecute. One is the absence of mandatory registration of Muslim marriages and divorces. “Nikahs are largely undocumented,” said Naish Hasan, a Lucknow-based activist who has worked with halala survivors for over two decades. “When there is no paper trail, the burden of proof falls entirely on women.”She said the practice remained alive, particularly among poor and marginalised women. “For years, cases kept surfacing before we even had language for it,” she said.Hasan said her fieldwork included around 40 detailed case studies from Lucknow district alone. “Justice should reach every last woman,” she added. Petitions challenging the practice of halala, including one filed by Hasan in 2021, have been pe-nding before Supreme Court.","Police in Amroha, UP, have invoked the law banning instant triple talaq.

Shubman Gill on missed chances, fielding lapses & World Cup preparation after ODI series loss

India batting star Rohit Sharma was at the centre of a major security scare recently after a woman allegedly grabbed his arm while he was entering the team hotel during the third ODI against New Zealand in Indore. A video of the incident, which has since gone viral on social media, shows the woman breaching the security cordon and approaching an unsuspecting Rohit, who appeared visibly startled by the sudden encounter.The clip later features the woman explaining her actions, claiming she was driven by desperation to seek help for her daughter, who is allegedly battling a serious illness and requires an expensive life-saving injection costing Rs 9 crore.“My name is Sarita Sharma. My daughter, Anika, is suffering from a serious illness, and to save her, we need an injection that costs Rs 9 crore and has to be imported from America.

Patrick Mahomes questioned Travis Kelce’s Taylor Swift romance before seeing it himself,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/patrick-mahomes-questioned-travis-kelces-taylor-swift-romance-before-seeing-it-himself/articleshow/127156404.cms,"Patrick Mahomes revealed he initially doubted Travis Kelce’s relationship with Taylor Swift until she appeared at Arrowhead Stadium. ESPN’s The Kingdom showed locker room disbelief, massive fan buzz, and how Swift’s presence reshaped game day energy. Teammates admitted the attention was overwhelming, yet the Chiefs stayed focused and won.

How Taylor Swift’s first Chiefs game changed everything inside the locker room

The moment Taylor Swift walked into Arrowhead Stadium, the Kansas City Chiefs felt it instantly. Phones buzzed. Heads turned. Energy shifted. What began as a regular-season game against the Chicago Bears quietly transformed into one of the most talked-about crossover moments in modern sports culture. Long before the internet caught up, the buzz was already echoing through the locker room.Inside the Chiefs organization, disbelief mixed with excitement. This was not just another celebrity sighting. It was Taylor Swift showing up for Travis Kelce, and it forced teammates to process the moment in real time while preparing to win a football game. For some, it felt unreal. For others, it felt historic.ESPN’s documentary The Kingdom captured those early reactions with rare honesty. Defensive tackle Chris Jones summed it up perfectly, saying, “You know the locker room was like, ‘Taylor Swift’s here. Taylor Swift’s here. For real? With Travis? Oh my god.’” He added, “We’re like, ‘Oh my god, Travis pulled Taylor Swift,’” a line that quickly became one of the episode’s most replayed moments.Quarterback Patrick Mahomes admitted he was skeptical at first, even after Kelce gave him advance notice.“He told me during the week. I was one of those like, ‘I got to see it, you know? I got to see it until I believe it,’” Mahomes said. Once the game began, the distraction was impossible to miss. “That’s the first person I noticed. I didn’t see anybody else,” he told Kelce on the sideline.Mahomes later explained the atmosphere shift, saying, “You definitely felt the buzz and you could see people in the stadium gravitating toward where she was at there.” Still, the focus never wavered. “But at the same time, we had business to handle.”Head coach Andy Reid added another layer to the story, revealing, “By that time, I knew they were going out. I knew her before him.” He even joked about Kelce’s reaction when Swift mentioned their connection, recalling, “And he went, ‘Oh no.’”As the postseason unfolded, Swift became part of the Chiefs’ inner circle. After the AFC Championship win, cameras caught her thanking Brittany Mahomes for emotional support, saying, “You’ve kept me so calm the last couple weeks. I did not know what to do and I’d just text Brittany and just be like, ‘Tell me it’s going to be OK. Tell me it’s going to be OK.”What started as a rumor ended up reshaping the NFL spotlight. As one teammate put it best, “The Swifties are a real thing.”","The Kansas City Chiefs beat the Chicago Bears in the AFC Championship. Taylor Swift showed up for the first time at Arrowhead Stadium.

Carlos Correa’s lighthearted moment with a child reflects his warm personality off the field

To most of the children, a simple encounter with a star in the Major League Baseball can become a treasured memory. That emotion came out recently when Houston Astros shortstop Carlos Correa had a casual, happy moment with a child off the field. The interaction was natural, there was no focus on cameras or fans and it was a mere passing of a baseball. The soft and calming presence of Correa and his sincere warmth made that little gesture significant.These incidents help to remind the fans that sometimes athletes can make their most memorable impact not on the statistics but on character and humanity through the most ordinary kinds of moments and interactions that have stayed memorable to the viewers even after the event itself.When the ball was going back and forth, Correa made sure to support the child with words that were both humorous and convincing. “You are incredible. We got to sign you for the Astros , okay? When you are older, for the Astros. And we need you to pitch for us!”The comment was light-hearted, but genuine. It was not performance or pressure, but igniting belief and happiness. To the child, it was a joyful moment. To the viewers who saw the clip later, it was a good insight into how Correa is a friendly and benevolent person off the field.The incident came into the attention of more people when the wife of Correa, Daniella, posted the video on her Instagram account. Her post gave fans an opportunity to view a softer side of the Astros star, which is based on encouragement and empathy. Viewers also appreciated the interaction as they found it fascinating to watch high-level professional athletes relate to each other in a real manner.In the case of the Houston Astros, such moments subtly create a stronger connection between players and the community, demonstrating that the influence of baseball can be made through the simplest and most sincere acts that are not necessarily on the field.","Carlos Correa’s lighthearted moment with a child reflects his warm personality off the field.

NHL trade rumors: Jason Robertson’s future draws attention as Penguins’ interest becomes harder to ignore,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-rumors-jason-robertsons-future-draws-attention-as-penguins-interest-becomes-harder-to-ignore/articleshow/127218443.cms,"Jason Robertson trade rumors (The Hockey Writers)

Jason Robertson trade rumors fuel Penguins’ long-term plan



Jason Robertson trade speculation has moved from background noise to front-page talk as the Pittsburgh Penguins keep winning. Sitting third in the Metropolitan Division with a 23-14-11 record, Pittsburgh has changed its own narrative. This was supposed to be a year of survival. Instead, it has become a season of belief. That unexpected position has forced the front office to think bigger and act bolder as the trade deadline creeps closer.Rather than choosing a clean push or a full pivot, the Penguins are living in both worlds. Kyle Dubas is protecting the present while scanning the league for a player who can shape the future. That mindset explains why Dallas Stars winger Jason Robertson has entered serious conversation. According to Josh Yohe of The Athletic, Pittsburgh “absolutely love” Robertson, a telling phrase that reflects real intent, not casual interest.Robertson is not just another scorer. He is 26, in his prime, and producing at a level few wingers can touch. With 29 goals and 58 points through 50 games, he is delivering top-line offense while driving play in critical moments. That profile matters for a Penguins team still led by Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin but searching for the next offensive pillar.The appeal runs deeper than numbers. Pittsburgh has struggled to develop a young forward who can eventually carry the load. Robertson solves that problem instantly. He fits the age curve, the skill need, and the competitive timeline. Yohe also noted that the Penguins could “spend whatever it takes” for a player of this caliber without wrecking their long-term reset, a reflection of both asset depth and cap flexibility.Jason Robertson trade chatter has energized the fan base because the math works. Pittsburgh can offer legitimate prospects like Rutger McGroarty, Ville Koivunen, or Owen Pickering, plus premium picks. With projected cap space north of $11 million, the financial side is manageable. Moving a roster salary would be procedural, not prohibitive.If Robertson ever becomes available, the price will be steep. Dallas would demand value that hurts. Still, this is the type of swing that changes direction. Slide Robertson next to Crosby and the Penguins gain a left-shot finisher who can tilt games without perfect conditions. At this point, the question is not whether Pittsburgh can make the call. It is how much upside they are willing to chase before the deadline clock runs out.","Pittsburgh Penguins have been linked to Dallas Stars winger Jason Robertson.

The longtime Eagles center praised his parents, wife, and brother Travis, crediting them for shaping his values and resilience. Kelce emphasized that being a present, loving father now brings him greater fulfillment than his NFL career ever did.

Jason Kelce’s retirement speech reveals why fatherhood now defines his legacy

For most fans, Jason Kelce will always be remembered as the emotional heartbeat of the Philadelphia Eagles, a center who played with grit, humor, and rare authenticity. But when he announced his retirement, football quickly faded into the background. What stood out instead was how clearly his priorities have shifted, away from stadium lights and toward the quieter meaning of family.Jason Kelce’s message was not framed as a goodbye to the game. It felt more like an arrival into a different chapter. One built around presence, gratitude, and responsibility. As he spoke, it became clear that retirement did not signal an ending. It marked a return to the values that shaped him long before he wore midnight green.Jason Kelce’s most powerful moment came when he spoke about fatherhood, a role he now considers his greatest purpose. “I think one of the best things a person can be in this world is a father. A father who is present, loving (and) devoted just might be the greatest gift a child can ask for in our society, and I have a (expletive) good one,” he said.That belief connects directly to how he sees his future with his three daughters.For Kelce, success is no longer measured in Pro Bowls or championships. It is measured at home.His words about his brother, Travis Kelce, offered rare insight into a lifelong bond that shaped both men long before fame followed them.“There is no chance I’d be here without the bond Travis and I share. It made me stronger, tougher, smarter, and it taught me the values of cooperation, loyalty, patience and understanding.”Kelce also credited his wife, Kylie, for anchoring his life beyond football. “She has also given me three beautiful girls and a life that increasingly gives me more fulfillment off the field than it does on.”In stepping away, Jason Kelce did not walk away from greatness. He redefined it.","Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce announced his retirement from the NFL on Monday.

Pop star Katy Perry found herself at the centre of growing controversy over climate and celebrity behaviour after her high-profile space tourism flight in April last year. The singer, who arrived in Davos during key talks on environmental issues, was criticised for participating in a space mission that many say undermines the message she now promotes. The American singer attended the event with her boyfriend, former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.On April 14, 2025, Perry flew aboard a Blue Origin New Shepard rocket on a sub-orbital flight lasting about 11 minutes. The mission was known as NS-31. It carried six women, including Perry, journalist Gayle King and aerospace engineer Aisha Bowe. It was marketed as an all-female crew spaceflight, a milestone in commercial space tourism, which was also meant to encourage the feminist movement. The craft reached the boundary of space, and passengers experienced weightlessness for a brief time before returning to Earth.","Katy Perry flew aboard a Blue Origin New Shepard rocket on a sub-orbital flight lasting about 11 minutes.

NFL replaces T.J. Watt with Jaguars LB Devin Lloyd



T.J. Watt’s season did not end the way anyone in Pittsburgh expected. Just days before the Pro Bowl Game, the Steelers’ defensive leader found himself ruled out with an injury that forced the league into a late change.Watt had earned his ninth Pro Bowl selection after another strong campaign. Still, instead of heading to Orlando, he is now watching from the sidelines as Jacksonville linebacker Devin Lloyd steps into the spotlight.On Jan 22, 2026, local Jacksonville radio station 1010 XL confirmed on X that Devin Lloyd had been named as Watt’s replacement for the 2026 Pro Bowl Games.“BREAKING: The Jaguars have been awarded another Pro Bowler! Jaguars LB Devin Lloyd has been named to the 2026 Pro Bowl Games in replacement of injured Steelers LB T.J. Watt,” the station posted.The NFL later confirmed the move, citing Watt’s injury as the reason for his withdrawal. While the Steelers have not released detailed medical specifics, team sources said Watt is not medically cleared to participate in any football activity.Watt’s absence closes the book on what had been another productive year for the 30-year-old. During the 2025 regular season, he recorded 7 sacks, 23 solo tackles, 3 forced fumbles, and 2 interceptions, numbers that once again placed him among the league’s most impactful edge rushers.For Lloyd, the call came as a reward for his best season since entering the league. The former first-round pick started 15 games for Jacksonville in 2025 and finished with 81 total tackles, six tackles for loss, one fumble recovery, and multiple game-changing plays in coverage.His biggest moment came in Week 5 against the Kansas City Chiefs, when he returned a Patrick Mahomes interception 99 yards for a touchdown in the Jaguars’ 31-28 win. Lloyd was also named second-team All-Pro by the Associated Press, becoming just the second linebacker in the last two decades to record at least 10 quarterback hits and five interceptions in a single season.Jaguars general manager James Gladstone spoke about Lloyd’s growth during a media interaction at the team’s end-of-season press conference on Jan. 8.“What he meant to our end result was certainly notable,” Gladstone said. “The way he worked every week, the way he connected with the staff, it showed up on Sundays.”Lloyd now joins long snapper Ross Matiscik as the second Jaguars player selected for the Pro Bowl Games this year. For Pittsburgh, Watt’s injury adds to a difficult offseason. Earlier in 2025, Watt signed a three-year, $123 million extension, and during an appearance on the ""Steelers Now"" podcast in July 2025, he admitted his future was closely tied to head coach Mike Tomlin.“I don’t want to play for anyone other than Mike T,” Watt said on the show.With Watt sidelined and uncertainty around the Steelers’ direction, the moment belongs to Lloyd. His Pro Bowl selection does more than fill a vacancy. It confirms his arrival as one of the AFC’s most complete linebackers.",NFL replaces T.J.

NBA stars and legends on Kobe Bryant’s 81-point game



There will never be anyone like Kobe Bryant . The Los Angeles Lakers legend has made several astonishing histories but his 81-point game in 2006 was record-breaking. On this day, he made the history that is yet to reach by the modern NBA stars. Of course, Wilt Chamberlain’s 100-point game remains unbeaten, but Bryant’s stunning feat has equally been celebrated over the years. On the 20th anniversary of Bryant’s wild performance, his wife Vanessa Bryant celebrates the record breaking feat in a series of Instagram stories.Vanessa didn’t have to caption anything from her part, the stories were the tale of the history itself as they spoke loud with vivid images of her late husband, who tragically passed away on 26 January in 2020 with his daughter Gianna Maria-Onore Bryant in a devastating helicopter crash.Vanessa Bryant often makes sure to keep her late husband Kobe Bryant in her memories. She often shares fragments of his legendary life as a standout NBA star on her posts on social media. Recently, Vanessa made sure to celebrate Kobe Bryant’s stunning 81-point game on its 20th anniversary with a series of heartfelt nods to the ex-Lakers star’s groundbreaking feat.On January 22, 2006, Kobe Bryant delivered a scoring display that reshaped modern NBA history.At Staples Center, Bryant took over the game with relentless pace dominating the Toronto Raptors.The performance still stands as the second-highest scoring game the league has ever seen. Unlike older scoring feats told through stories, this one occurred live on television.Bryant finished with 81 points after shooting 28-of-46 from the field, including 7-of-13 from three-point range. He added 18 made free throws on 20 attempts and logged 42 minutes. His scoring split told the story. Twenty-six points came before halftime. Fifty-five followed after the break.After the game, Bryant downplayed the moment. “I feel pretty good,” he said. “It hasn't really sank in yet. We had four days off coming up here. I'd have been sick as a dog if we lost this game. I wanted to step up and inspire us to play a great game and it turned into something really special.”Around the league, disbelief followed quickly. Tim Duncan thought the stat line was wrong. Dwyane Wade rushed to find a television after hearing the number. “I was like, ‘no way,’” Wade said. “At that time I think everybody was a fan of Kobe’s to see this is history right here being made.”Kyrie Irving remembered seeing the headline. “It said ‘Kobe 81,’” he said. “I just couldn't believe it.” Vince Carter had a similar reaction. “81? Or 51?” Dirk Nowitzki summed it up simply. “Nobody believed it.”Years later, the game still marks generations. Giannis Antetokounmpo recalled where he was that night. “I was 11 years old. I wasn’t playing basketball,” he said. Kevin Durant remembered watching with his father. “That brought us closer as a father and son,” Durant said. Stephen Curry admitted his first reaction was doubt. “81 just doesn’t even sound right,” he said.Bryant’s historic feat will be celebrated in the NBA for decades to come. Not many players came close to his elite score. Luka Doncic scored 73 in 2024, but was still 8-point short.","On January 22, 2006, Kobe Bryant delivered a scoring display that reshaped modern NBA history.

Cardi B’s ‘B-Word’ Comment on IG Live Blowup Hits as Dad Says 4-Year-Old NFL Picks Star Got Death Threats,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/cardi-bs-b-word-comment-on-ig-live-blowup-hits-as-dad-says-4-year-old-nfl-picks-star-got-death-threats/articleshow/127164986.cms,"Anthony Donatelli says his daughter Reese, known for viral NFL picks videos, received threats after playoff losses. (Image via Getty)

A father-daughter gimmick turned into a gamblers’ meltdown, and the threats got real fast

Cardi B ’s ‘little white girl’ comment went viral too, but she walked it back right away

A 4-year-old who went viral for NFL picks is now dealing with adult-level ugliness. Her father says strangers sent their family death threats and money demands after her playoff predictions missed. The Los Angeles Times reported the threats. The New York Post also reported the same basic claim.Reese Donatelli became a social media hit through “Trust the Toddler,” a father-daughter series where she chooses winners by grabbing miniature NFL helmets. It started as a teaching tool. Then gamblers turned it into their personal excuse.Anthony Donatelli, a radio personality from Riverside, Calif., told the Los Angeles Times the family started getting threatening messages after Reese’s picks went sideways during the playoffs. Some messages demanded money from people who claimed they lost thousands because they followed a preschooler’s picks.Donatelli summed it up in one line: “It’s nuts,” then spelled out the obvious: “She’s obviously not an NFL analyst. She’s picking teams based on the color of her dress, or she’ll pick the Packers because she likes cheese. She just relates these silly little things as reasons why she picks certain teams.”That context matters because the backlash tried to treat her like a handicapper. During the first weekend of this month’s playoff games, several of Reese’s picks missed, and some followers started calling her picks “cursed.” Donatelli told the Los Angeles Times the series began nearly four years ago when he bought the mini helmets to teach colors, geography, and football. He said the concept stuck immediately.He described the early “aha” moment to the outlet: “It just clicked. I would put the match-ups of who was going to play that week in front of her, and for the past four years, she’s been calling football games. And she’s been pretty dang good at it,” he said.Then the playoffs hit and the streak flipped. One report said Reese guessed the wrong team for all six games during the first week of the playoffs. The next week, she went 1-for-9, with incorrect picks that included the Buffalo Bills, San Francisco 49ers, and Chicago Bears.Some people tried to keep it as a joke, at least on the surface. The Independent noted one Instagram user joked they bet “$10 million on Houston because of her,” adding they are now “more in debt than the U.S. government.” Another user pushed back on the entire idea of following her picks, writing: “If [you’re] letting a kid pick your parlays you shouldn’t be betting.”But Donatelli said it did not stay in “comment section comedy.” The family allegedly received threats. And his Instagram was set to private at the time of publication, per The Independent.The story picked up extra heat when Cardi B weighed in. The Independent reported she jumped on Instagram Live after Reese picked the New England Patriots to win, and Cardi B joked: “little white girl said we’re going to win. F** that, b***,” then immediately apologized, saying, “I didn’t mean to say that.”That moment mattered because it put a spotlight on the kid, not just the gimmick. It also tied the viral picks to a celebrity clip that people could repost and argue about. In the same reporting, Cardi B is referenced as being linked to New England Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs.There was also a twist the internet did not know what to do with. The Independent reported Reese’s Patriots pick was correct, with New England beating Houston 28–16 to advance to the AFC Championship.Donatelli tried to keep his own page light, at least publicly. After Reese hit the Patriots result, he wrote: “The curse has been reversed.” That line played into the joke. It also highlighted how ridiculous the blame game was in the first place.Here is what does not require debate. A 4-year-old does not control a playoff game. A 4-year-old does not owe gamblers refunds. If someone bets real money because a preschooler grabbed a helmet on camera, that is not “bad luck.” That is reckless behavior dressed up as fandom.","Reese Donatelli became a social media hit through “Trust the Toddler,’ a father- daughter series where she chooses winners by grabbing miniature NFL helmets.

How Timothy McCormack ended up with a two-year prison term?

Who are the NBA players at the center of the gambling investigation?

A major sports betting scandal linked to the NBA has unfolded over the past few years, revealing a conspiracy that used inside information about players’ performance to make illegal gambling profits. This case recently made headlines again after Timothy McCormack, a key figure in the case, became the first person to be sentenced to prison for his role. His sentencing has led to an investigation that also involves current and former NBA players and raises questions about the integrity of professional basketball.The scandal centers on the use of “proposition betting” that doesn't depend on which team wins, but on specific players and how conspirators allegedly used information that is generally not publicly announced to place bets that almost certainly would win. Federal agents noticed strange betting activity, found it was connected to people who knew secret NBA game plans, and ended up charging many people involved.Timothy McCormack admitted in court that he used secret information about NBA players to place bets that almost always won. He knew some players would leave games early or not play their best, and he used that knowledge to make big bets and huge profits.At his sentencing in Brooklyn, McCormack spoke honestly about his long battle with gambling:""I've struggled with a gambling addiction for more than half my life,"" he said.Even though prosecutors wanted him to go to prison for about four years, the judge, LaShann DeArcy Hall, gave him a two-year sentence, saying his addiction was an important factor.The judge also pointed out how serious the crime was, saying:""There is no question this is a serious crime... Sports matters to me as an individual, as it should to society.""Prosecutors said McCormack was a key part in the case, adding that scams like this wouldn’t happen without people like him.Two NBA players, Terry Rozier and Jontay Porter, are involved in the investigation, but their situations are different.Jontay Porter, who used to play for the Toronto Raptors, admitted he took part in the scheme. He shared information about his own games and changed how he played to help with the bets. Porter pled guilty in 2024, has been banned from the NBA, and is waiting to hear his punishment after co-operating with the investigators.Terry Rozier, who plays for the Miami Heat but is on unpaid leave, has been charged with helping friends place bets by affecting his performance in a 2023 game. Rozier says he is not guilty and is free on a $3 million bond. His next court hearing is in March.","Timothy McCormack admitted in court that he used secret information about NBA players to place bets that almost always won.

Dana White responds to Mauricio Sulaiman and defends Zuffa Boxing plans

Dana White has publicly responded after Mauricio Sulaiman accused Zuffa Boxing of bullying its way into professional boxing, bringing a growing power struggle into full view. The comments surfaced ahead of Zuffa Boxing’s first event under its Paramount+ deal, as debate intensified over how the new promotion plans to operate within the sport.Mauricio Sulaiman, the president of the World Boxing Council, questioned Dana White’s approach and said the promotion was being aggressive toward boxing’s traditional structure. He suggested that Zuffa Boxing’s arrival created unnecessary tension with long-established sanctioning bodies that have governed world titles for decades. The criticism followed earlier concerns about whether Sulaiman would even be allowed to present the WBC belt at a recent superfight overseen by White. Dana White rejected those claims and said Zuffa Boxing has no intention of taking over boxing or sidelining existing organizations.Replying to an Instagram post shared by Boxing Social, Dana White said Zuffa Boxing is not changing the foundations of professional boxing. Dana White stated that the Ali Act would remain fully intact and unchanged, stressing that fighters would continue to receive the same legal protections they have now.Dana White also said established sanctioning bodies would continue operating as usual. He specifically named the WBC, WBA, IBF, and WBO, and said promoters such as Oscar De La Hoya, Eddie Hearn, and Bob Arum’s Top Rank would continue doing business without interference.“I’m just doing something different,” Dana White wrote, questioning why his actions were being described as bullying. He added that fighters would still be free to compete across promotions and pursue opportunities outside Zuffa Boxing if they choose. Mauricio Sulaiman had earlier expanded on his concerns in an interview with Boxing Social, saying there was no need for confrontation. Mauricio Sulaiman argued that boxing already has a system built on history, tradition, and recognized world titles, and warned against what he viewed as unnecessary disruption.To support his position, Mauricio Sulaiman pointed to fighters currently linked to Zuffa Boxing who remain active within the WBC structure. He cited Callum Walsh, the WBC Continental Americas champion, who is set to headline Zuffa Boxing’s debut event. He also mentioned Dalton Smith and Conor Benn as fighters still pursuing WBC titles.The debate grew louder after IBF cruiserweight champion Jai Opetaia joined the Zuffa roster, raising questions about title unification. Recent reports suggest Zuffa Boxing may allow fighters like Jai Opetaia to pursue unification bouts while remaining under the promotion’s banner. Dana White’s comments also came as the proposed Ali Revival Act cleared a House committee. As Zuffa Boxing prepares for its launch, the exchange highlights rising tension between boxing’s traditional leadership and its newest major entrant.",Dana White responds to WBC chief Mauricio Sulaiman.

‘Reigning MVP’ Is Back in the Room: Josh Allen Named AP 2025 NFL MVP Finalist Again,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/reigning-mvp-is-back-in-the-room-josh-allen-named-ap-2025-nfl-mvp-finalist-again/articleshow/127168316.cms,"Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen warms up before a regular-season game in Orchard Park, N.Y., during the 2025 NFL season.

Josh Allen’s 2025 season made voters look past playoff disappointment

The finalist field shows how narrow Allen’s margin really is

Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen is back where the league keeps expecting him to be. On Jan. 22, Allen was named a finalist for the Associated Press 2025 NFL Most Valuable Player award, putting him in the same conversation that has followed his prime for most of the decade.The winner will be announced at “NFL Honors” on Feb. 5 at the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco, three days before Super Bowl LX. Allen enters as the reigning MVP, a label that now cuts both ways. It raises the standard. It sharpens the scrutiny.Allen’s regular-season case is built on output, durability, and historical pace. He completed 69.3% of his passes in 2025, throwing for 3,668 yards, 25 touchdowns, and 10 interceptions, while posting a 102.2 passer rating. He added 579 rushing yards and 14 touchdowns, continuing to blur the line between quarterback and short-yardage weapon.The Bills reached the playoffs for a seventh straight season, but the run ended early. Buffalo lost to Denver in the divisional round, and the organization fired Sean McDermott soon after. That context matters. MVP voters often penalize postseason flameouts, even when the award is technically based on the regular season.Still, Allen stacked milestones at a rate few quarterbacks have matched. According to the Bills’ official site, his 2025 season included becoming the youngest and fastest player to reach 300 regular-season touchdowns, passing Cam Newton for most rushing touchdowns by a quarterback, and surpassing Peyton Manning for most total touchdowns by a player age 30 or younger. He also reached 30,000 career passing yards and recorded multiple games with both passing and rushing dominance that had never been seen before.The résumé reads like a counterargument to voter fatigue. Allen did not just repeat past success. He extended it.Allen is not alone. The AP named Trevor Lawrence , Drake Maye, Christian McCaffrey, and Matthew Stafford as fellow finalists, per the Associated Press. Every name brings a different type of pressure.Maye led the NFL in passer rating and completion percentage while taking New England to the AFC championship game. Stafford led the league with 4,707 passing yards and 46 touchdowns and earned his first first-team All-Pro nod. McCaffrey once again separated himself as an all-purpose threat, finishing with 2,298 yards from scrimmage while helping San Francisco survive a season riddled with injuries.Voting closed before the playoffs, but context still lingers. A nationwide panel of 50 media members ranked their top five choices, with first-place votes carrying 10 points, per the Associated Press. Allen won this award last year by edging out Lamar Jackson, despite Jackson earning first-team All-Pro honors.That history matters. Allen enters this vote as the man to beat, but also the one voters may feel they have already rewarded.","Josh Allen was named a finalist for the Associated Press 2025 NFL Most Valuable Player award.

How football helped shape Tom Brady’s parenting philosophy

Success through a father’s lens

Tom Brady may be remembered as the most successful quarterback in NFL history, but in recent years, the former New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers star has often spoken about a role he values even more being a father.He wrote in his personal newsletter about what it really means to be a ""great father."" He said something that people all over the world have since found touching: ""I think part of being a great father is being a great example of doing what it takes to take care of your family.""The words capture a side of Brady that goes beyond Super Bowls, MVPs and championship parades.Brady explained that for much of his life, taking care of his family meant dedicating himself fully to football. The long hours, strict routines and intense focus were not just about winning games, but about showing his children what commitment and responsibility look like in real life.Brady says that being a parent doesn't just mean reading bedtime stories or helping with homework. It can also mean being a good role model by being disciplined, working hard, and being consistent.He believes children learn more by watching how their parents live than by listening to what they say.Brady is a father to three children Jack, Benjamin and Vivian. After his divorce from Gisele Bündchen in 2022, he has spoken openly about adjusting to co-parenting and finding balance between work and family.In recent months, Brady has shared several moments from his travels with his children across Europe, posting pictures from Germany, the Netherlands and Spain. The images show a relaxed side of the former athlete, enjoying simple moments away from the spotlight.Brady's comment makes it clear that success isn't just about trophies or records. He thinks that being a role model for his kids, someone they can look up to for advice, values, and a strong work ethic, is also a sign of success.He has acknowledged many times that winning Super Bowls didn't make him a great father, but the process of being better at his profession did help him become a better parent.A lot of followers, especially those who are trying to manage work and family life, have agreed with such a point of view.Brady's quote of the day is short but quite strong. It reminds parents all over the world that setting a good example might sometimes be more important than doing big things.","Tom Brady wrote about what it really means to be a ""great father"" in his newsletter.

Revisiting late Lakers legend Kobe Bryant’s iconic 81-point night on its 20th anniversary,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/revisiting-late-lakers-legend-kobe-bryants-iconic-81-point-night-on-its-20th-anniversary/articleshow/127171182.cms,"Late Lakers legend Kobe Bryant (Image via: Getty Images)

How Kobe Bryant’s 81-point night at Staples Center defines greatness long after his passing?

Twenty years ago today, Kobe Bryant put on a performance that changed how basketball is seen. On January 22, 2006, the Los Angeles Lakers guard scored 81 points in a regular‑season game against the Toronto Raptors — the second‑highest scoring total in NBA history behind only Wilt Chamberlain’s legendary 100‑point night from 1962. This wasn’t just a big scoring night, it was also a defining moment in Bryant’s career.That night was special not just because of how many points Kobe scored, but also the way he scored them. He defended well, made his own shots, and played strongly throughout the whole game. Even 20 years later, fans and experts still remember how amazing that night was and see it as how it marks Kobe as one of the best scorers in NBA history.On the evening of January 22, at Staples Center in Los Angeles, Kobe Bryant turned a seemingly ordinary game into an unforgettable moment. The first half didn’t go in favor of the Los Angeles Lakers, but Kobe didn’t let the game slip away. He kept scoring again and again, making jump shots, hitting threes, and drawing fouls, helping to keep his team in the game.By the end of the game, Kobe had scored 81 points. He made 28 shots out of 46 attempts, hit seven three-pointers, and scored 18 free throws.He also scored rebounds and made steals, helping his team in many ways. That night, he scored more than half of his team’s total points and broke long-standing team records, including Elgin Baylor’s 71-point mark, carrying them to a 122-104 victory.Kobe Bryant’s 81-point game was more than just a record, it changed how people view scoring in today’s NBA. Very few players had ever come close to scoring that much, and very few have done it, especially in a game that was truly competitive. While Wilt Chamberlain’s 100‑point night remains the highest in the league, many people see Kobe’s 81 points as more impressive because of the tough game situation and how he scored on his own.

Rockets vs Key Matchup: Embiid vs. Sengun

What’s at Stake for Philadelphia 76ers

for the Philadelphia 76ers on Thursday night against the Houston Rockets. The designation is tied to right ankle injury management, and unless there is a late change, he is expected to play at Wells Fargo Center.Embiid did not play in Philadelphia’s last game against the Phoenix Suns on Tuesday. The team chose rest over risk, with the focus on having him available for this matchup. His return comes against a Houston team competing for playoff positioning and built around size in the frontcourt.This season has been uneven for Joel Embiid. Injuries have limited him to 23 games, but when he has played, production has not been an issue. He is averaging 24.2 points and 7.0 rebounds per game while shooting 47.7 percent from the field.Earlier this month, Embiid dealt with left knee problems. The current ankle issue is being handled cautiously, but the probable tag suggests the team is comfortable with his condition. Philadelphia’s offense has struggled without him, particularly in scoring efficiency and rebounding.Both teams enter the game with key players unavailable or uncertain.Houston’s injuries thin out its rotation, especially in the frontcourt, which could matter if Embiid plays his usual minutes.If Joel Embiid is on the floor, the primary focus will be his matchup with Alperen Sengun. Sengun has been Houston’s most consistent inside scorer and is averaging more than 20 points per game. With Steven Adams out, Sengun will be asked to handle Embiid largely without help from a traditional backup center.Philadelphia has struggled on the boards when Embiid sits. His presence could quickly change that, while also forcing Houston to adjust its defensive coverages.The Sixers are trying to gain ground in a tight Eastern Conference race. A home win would help stabilize their position and reinforce how dependent the team remains on Embiid’s availability.Also read: Houston Rockets vs Philadelphia 76ers injury report: Injured and questionable players, head-to-head records, team stats, and more (January 22, 2026) Tip-off is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. ET.

Lara Trump shares viral golfing photos with Donald Trump and granddaughter

Bill Maher Clashes With Lara Trump After She Downplays Trump’s ‘Piggy’ Insult On Air Force One

Social media responds with warmth and nostalgia

How a shared family moment cut through public tension





Lara Trump has recently bestowed upon social media participants a rare treat with a glimpse into the less familiar, more personal side of the Trump family. Through the sharing of just a few images on X, she has reached the hearts of many with this intimate family picture involving her young daughter's fun-filled golf game with her grandfather, US President Donald Trump himself, with whom she gets to spend quality time while playing their favourite game, golf. This is one instance where the family, known for its political fervour, has been accepted with such fervour not for their political ideology but for this common family experience that speaks volumes about their humanity despite their fame and power, resonating widely with audiences who cherish authentic, tender moments beyond politics.The photographs depicted Donald Trump behind the wheel of a golf cart, with his granddaughter sitting alongside him, looking happy and carefree. Moreover, there were no signs of poses or dramatic settings, only a serene capture of moments spent with each other. The informal nature of this post was a major factor that led to its success. The post was not meant for any particular message or statement, but only for a casual share by Lara Trump. The post succeeded in gathering tens of thousands of views, not because it was political or held any significance, but because it was something that was widely understood.The online response was largely positive, with many people describing the photographs as “wholesome” and “heartwarming”. Several users reflected on the special bond between grandparents and grandchildren, sharing how the images stirred personal memories and emotions. One user wrote, “What a great moment for her! My kids miss their Gramps,” while another commented, “Core memory unlocked!”, capturing the sense of nostalgia the post evoked. Others reacted more light-heartedly, with remarks such as, “Awww, I was wondering what Grandpa Trump was up to today!” and “Cutest thing I have seen all day.”Part of the post’s impact lay in its timing and tone. At a moment when public discourse is often polarised, the photographs presented a version of public life stripped of commentary and conflict. They highlighted how figures who dominate global headlines also occupy familiar family roles, such as grandparents enjoying simple moments with their loved ones.","Lara Trump has shared intimate family photos on social media.

Matthew Stafford earns PFWA MVP honor after guiding the Rams through a steady season and late playoff push,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/matthew-stafford-earns-pfwa-mvp-honor-after-guiding-the-rams-through-a-steady-season-and-late-playoff-push/articleshow/127143964.cms,"Matthew Stafford's MVP candidacy experienced a resurgence, overcoming a mid-season slump with a strong finish. His impressive regular-season statistics and the Rams' late-season surge earned him the PFWA MVP award. Stafford's consistent performance, including numerous game-winning drives and a solid playoff record, solidified his case for the league's top honor.

How Matthew Stafford’s finish turned the MVP conversation back in his favor

Momentum in the NFL has a short shelf life. One bad stretch can cool even the hottest start, and one strong finish can flip everything back in your favor. That reality played out clearly for Matthew Stafford this season. What began as a year filled with MVP talk briefly drifted into uncertainty before circling back with force.Midway through the season, the noise changed. The Rams hit a lull, Stafford’s name faded from betting boards, and the league’s focus shifted elsewhere. But inside the Los Angeles Rams, there was no panic. Stafford stayed composed, leaned on experience and guided a late-season push that reminded everyone why he has lasted this long at the top level.By the end of the regular season, Stafford’s numbers told a clear story. He threw for 4,707 yards, accounted for 46 touchdowns, and limited mistakes with just eight interceptions. That production, paired with the Rams’ surge, caught the attention of the Pro Football Writers of America.On January 21, the group made its call public. “PFWA has named Matthew Stafford their 2025 MVP!...” the Los Angeles Rams wrote on X.The recognition carries weight because of history. The PFWA MVP has closely matched the Associated Press MVP over decades. Since 1975, the two awards have differed only eight times, and just once since 2003. Last season’s split between Lamar Jackson and Josh Allen remains the rare outlier.That backdrop matters with the AP MVP scheduled to be announced on February 5 during the 2026 NFL Honors. Adding to Stafford’s case, Jonathan Jones noted that AP voters also selected him as a First Team All Pro, often a strong indicator of MVP alignment.Stafford’s postseason play has only strengthened the argument. He delivered the Rams their first playoff win in below-freezing temperatures since at least 2000 and now holds a 7-2 postseason record with the franchise. According to Fox Sports, he is 4-1 in Divisional Round games or later. There is also the broader body of work. ESPN tracking shows Stafford with 55 career game-winning drives, more than any quarterback since he entered the league in 2009. Those moments, built over years, continue to define his career.Since arriving from Detroit in 2021, Stafford has helped guide the Rams to a Super Bowl run and now their strongest season since. He has repeatedly credited head coach Sean McVay for creating stability and trust during that stretch.The awards are still rolling out, but the direction feels clear. Stafford did not just revive his MVP case late. He made it impossible to ignore.","Matthew Stafford won the Pro Football Writers of America MVP award.

Seattle Kraken snap losing streak with solid team efforts and great second period



NHL Highlights | Islanders vs. Kraken - January 21, 2026

It was a tough stretch, but the Seattle Kraken finally put an end to it, most decidedly in a 4-1 victory over the New York Islanders on Wednesday night at Climate Pledge Arena, with help from a very well-rounded game from Vince Dunn. Vince Dunn rattled home one of the big goals of the night and added an assist as Seattle got its mojo back.Seattle Kraken came in having lost four straight and six of their last seven, so the response against a team that is still fighting for a playoff position was all the more important here. The Kraken have made one of their most complete efforts in a long time with some excellent scoring, great special teams play that got off to a rusty start, and the goaltending of Philipp Grubauer.The Isles struck first and looked to dictate play early on in this one. Anthony Duclair extended his point streak to eight games to start the period by capitalizing on a power play chance when he blasted a one-timer from the left circle to beat Grubauer cleanly less than three minutes in to give his team momentum.Seattle, however, was quick to react. Even being penalized seven times, resulting in penalties, the Kraken were able to pick themselves up after the opening goal and prevent the Islanders from scoring on the remaining power plays.This was the catalyst that allowed Seattle to stay in the fight.The second period was decisive. Dunn put the Kraken ahead with a perfectly placed wrist shot from theslot, completing an efficient passing play that cut sharply through the Rangers' defensive structure. Shortly thereafter, Kaapo Kakko stretched the lead by capitalizing on an aggressive forecheck that yielded possession of the puck in a battle behind the Islanders' goal.During the third period, the Kraken concentrated on playing game management. Grubauer remained calm, pulling 24 shots on goal without allowing any Islanders' pressure. Furthermore, a timely empty-netter goal by Jared McCann secured victory for the Kraken, having also posted an assist during the match.This win carried added significance for head coach Lane Lambert, who defeated his former team for the first time since his dismissal by the Islanders last season. More importantly for Seattle, the victory pushed the Kraken back into the second Wild Card spot in the Western Conference based on regulation wins.",Seattle Kraken came in having lost four straight and six of their last seven.

A record-setting season for the Browns’ star

Browns celebrate their franchise cornerstone

Cleveland Browns star Myles Garrett has added another major award to his growing list of achievements. After a record-breaking 2025 campaign, Garrett was named the Pro Football Writers of America (PFWA) Defensive Player of the Year, a fitting reward for one of the most dominant seasons by a pass rusher in NFL history.Despite the Browns enduring a difficult year as a team, Garrett’s individual brilliance stood out every single week. His performances not only kept Cleveland competitive in many games, but also rewrote parts of the league’s record book.The highlight of Garrett’s season came in Week 18 when he recorded his 23rd sack of the year. That moment officially made him the single-season sack leader in NFL history, breaking the long-standing mark of 22.5 sacks shared by Michael Strahan and T.J. Watt.Over 17 games, Garrett finished with 23 sacks, 60 total tackles, and a career-high 33 tackles for loss. He also forced three fumbles and consistently pressured opposing quarterbacks, drawing double teams and extra protection almost every week.For Cleveland, which finished near the bottom of the AFC North, Garrett was often the lone bright spot. Offensive coordinators across the league built entire game plans around slowing him down, yet he continued to produce at an elite level.The PFWA award is one of the most respected individual honours in the NFL, voted on by reporters who cover the league closely throughout the season. This is the second time Garrett has won the PFWA Defensive Player of the Year, having previously claimed the award in 2023.In recent years, the PFWA winner has often gone on to win the NFL’s official AP Defensive Player of the Year award as well. That puts Garrett in a strong position to add yet another trophy at the upcoming NFL Honors ceremony.Around the league, players, coaches and analysts were quick to praise Garrett’s impact. Many described his 2025 campaign as one of the most complete defensive seasons they have ever seen.The Browns wasted no time celebrating the news. The team shared messages on social media congratulating Garrett, while teammates and fans echoed the praise.At 30 years old, Garrett is now firmly established among the greatest defensive players of his era. He also recently signed a long-term extension that keeps him in Cleveland through the 2030 season.For the Browns, Garrett’s award is a reminder that they have a true superstar to build around. As the franchise searches for stability and a new direction after coaching changes, Garrett remains the face of the defense.","Cleveland Browns star Myles Garrett has been named the Pro Football Writers of America (PFWA) Defensive Player of the Year.

Luke Hughes to miss extended time, New Jersey Devils recall Colton White



The New Jersey Devils announced Wednesday that defenseman Luke Hughes has been placed on long-term injured reserve (LTIR) retroactive to Monday following a shoulder injury. Hughes, 22, left Monday’s 2-1 overtime win against the Calgary Flames after colliding with forward Justin Kirkland along the boards. He also missed Tuesday’s 2-1 victory over the Edmonton Oilers as he begins rehab, avoiding surgery for now.Hughes’ absence is a major setback for the Devils, who rely heavily on his playmaking and defensive presence. As a rising star and cornerstone of the team’s blue line, Hughes’ performance is crucial for New Jersey’s push in the Metropolitan Division this season.Hughes sustained an upper-body injury during Monday’s game and, after consulting multiple specialists and his family, opted for rehab instead of surgery. With the LTIR designation, he must sit out at least 10 games and 24 days. The team expects him to be sidelined through the Olympic break and will monitor his recovery to determine a return timeline.The 2021 fourth-overall NHL Draft pick leads the Devils in ice time per game at 23:04 and tops the team’s defensemen with 26 points (five goals, 21 assists) in 49 games this season. Over his young career, Hughes has recorded 119 points in 204 regular-season games, alongside two assists in four Stanley Cup Playoff appearances.His ability to control play in both ends makes his absence particularly challenging for New Jersey.To cover the gap, the Devils recalled defenseman Colton White from the AHL’s Utica Comets ahead of Friday’s game against the Vancouver Canucks. While White adds depth, Hughes’ offensive and defensive impact will be difficult to replace.New Jersey (26-22-2) currently sits sixth in the Metropolitan Division and faces a critical stretch of the season without one of its most dynamic defensemen. With Hughes recently signing a seven-year, $63 million contract extension, he remains central to the Devils’ long-term plans. His rehabilitation process will be closely followed as the team goes through this critical period, balancing the immediate impact of his absence with the goal of a full, healthy return.","New Jersey Devils defenseman Luke Hughes has been placed on long-term injured reserve (LTIR) retroactive to Monday.

Why Kai Cenat’s Vivet journal moment divided the internet





The attention this week trailed Kai Cenat to Paris, although not every one of it was complimentary. The appearance of the Twitch star in Paris Men fashion week 2026 provoked a viral debate that immediately left fashion and moved to the issue of genuineness. A brief clip of Cenat holding a Vivet journal spread quickly over the web attracting millions of views and even more incisive opinions.What should have been a fashion-forward moment instead became a social media flashpoint. Some viewers praised the 24-year-old for pushing his clothing brand onto a global stage. Others accused him of turning creativity into performance, arguing that the journal felt more symbolic than sincere. Within hours, the narrative had shifted from fashion to intent.The now-viral clip showed Cenat dressed in black, carrying a Vivet journal and briefly sharing design concepts tied to his brand. The visual alone was enough to ignite debate. One user wrote, ""At first I thought it was genuine but it’s getting performative"" while another added, ""No empty pages or pen he just walking around with it being performative 😭"".The criticism kept coming.""He just carrying it to be carrying it at this point. Ain’t no space in there 😂"" one comment read, followed by ""He’s sharing too much I’d never share my journal. Looks performative"".The pushback did not stop there. Some viewers took the critique further, comparing Cenat’s fashion pivot to Kanye West ’s creative persona. ""He wants to be like Kanye so bad. These designs are bad."" one user claimed, while another said, ""Kai def on some Kanye West sh*t"".Still, Cenat showed no signs of backing away from the spotlight. In a separate Paris Fashion Week interview, he struck a reflective tone when asked about his mindset. ""(Interviewer asks, 'If your life was a biopic, who would play you?') Me. (Interviewer asks, 'What's your favorite book?') It's probably The Four Agreements all around. But first one, probably Atomic Habits. (Interviewer asks, 'What's something that you're currently obsessed with?') Living. Just, like, living in real life.""The moment captures where Kai Cenat stands today. Hugely influential. Constantly watched. And navigating the fine line between expression and perception in real time.","Kai Cenat went viral at Paris Men’s Fashion Week 2026 after a video showed him carrying a Vivet journal showcasing his fashion ideas.

‘I Feel Like Davante Adams Out There’: How Puka Nacua’s Game Changed After Cooper Kupp Left,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/i-feel-like-davante-adams-out-there-how-puka-nacuas-game-changed-after-cooper-kupp-left/articleshow/127156189.cms,"Puka Nacua has absorbed lessons from Cooper Kupp and Davante Adams, shaping his game ahead of the NFC Championship matchup. (Image via Getty)

Cooper Kupp Set the Foundation for Puka Nacua’s NFL Growth

Davante Adams Sharpened Puka Nacua’s Routes, Discipline, and Mental Edge

Puka Nacua did not lose a mentor when Cooper Kupp left Los Angeles. He gained a second one.According to ESPN’s Sarah Barshop, the Rams’ third-year receiver has quietly rebuilt his game by learning from two elite wideouts with very different styles. First, Kupp taught him how to survive in the NFL . Then Davante Adams taught him how to dominate within it. The result is a receiver who no longer just produces numbers, but understands how and why they come.Nacua’s education started before he ever shared a practice field with Kupp. During organized team activities in 2023, Kupp joined meetings virtually while awaiting the birth of his third son. That was when Nacua realized what he had walked into.“I heard the voice of Cooper Kupp before I ever saw the person of Cooper Kupp,” Nacua said. “I was like, I feel like this is our other coach. I just don’t know what he looks like.”That relationship quickly turned into full immersion. Rams receivers coach Eric Yarber told Nacua to “hold on to Cooper’s coattail” and do exactly what Kupp did. Nacua listened. As a rookie, he set the NFL rookie record with 105 catches for 1,486 yards.The real leap came during their first offseason together. Kupp invited Nacua to train at his house five days a week. Morning sessions started at 6 a.m. The work was intense enough that Nacua said he threw up repeatedly.“I remember the first week I came back, I think I threw up every day of the week,” Nacua said. “And he wasn’t a fan of that. It was on his lawn and stuff.”Kupp saw the buy-in immediately. “We were focused on just pushing each other, trying to get better. He’s willing to work,” Kupp said in 2024. “He knows that one of the hardest things is to have success early and then be able to continue to push.”That offseason also forced changes away from the field. Nacua overhauled his nutrition. He cut out fried and inflammatory foods. He stopped regular fast-food runs. The goal was body control, not bulk.Yarber said the results were visible. “He lost a lot of body fat which enabled him to move efficiently,” Yarber said. “Now when he puts his foot in the ground, it’s going in a different direction.”When the Rams released Kupp after nine seasons and signed Davante Adams, Nacua did not reset. He adapted.Adams arrived with a different reputation and a different skill set. Nacua made a request almost immediately.He asked Adams to lead receiver drills so he could watch every rep. “The common theme with him since I’ve been here is just being an open vessel,” Adams said. “Always being open and willing to learn.”That approach changed how Nacua ran routes. Yarber said Adams helped him understand deception, not speed, is what separates elite receivers.“One thing that I’ve seen him learn from Davante is making all his routes look the same,” Yarber said. “Each stem looks the same, so they don’t know if you’re going vertical or you’re breaking out or you’re breaking in.”Adams pushed that point constantly. “Hey, you got to make them believe it,” Adams told him. “You just can’t go through the motions.” Nacua started feeling the difference during games. “I felt like Davante Adams out there,” Nacua said after executing a late separation against the Arizona Cardinals in Week 14.The work extended into film sessions. Nacua regularly asked Adams to critique his routes. Then he applied the feedback immediately. “He’s not afraid to fail,” Yarber said.That mindset mattered when the season got messy. Despite posting career highs with 129 catches, 1,715 yards, and 10 touchdowns, Nacua faced scrutiny after a Week 16 loss in Seattle. Days earlier, he appeared on a livestream where he made a gesture later linked to antisemitic themes. Nacua apologized, saying he had “no idea” of the gesture’s meaning. He was later fined $25,000 after criticizing officials.Sean McVay said Nacua was not distracted, but the moment required guidance. Adams stepped in quietly. “He was checking in on me,” Nacua said. “I know he was a listening ear and it was greatly appreciated.”McVay sees the connection clearly. “He’s really leaned into Davante,” McVay said. “I think Davante’s helped him continue to take his game to another level.” Now, Nacua and Adams will face Kupp’s Seattle Seahawks in the NFC Championship Game on Sunday at 6:30 p.m. ET on Fox. The moment ties the entire story together.“I think there’s no way the football gods would rather have it be than for us to go back up there and see the all-father,” Nacua said. Kupp taught Nacua how to work. Adams taught him how to think.

Brutal reality of being an NFL head coach

Pressure is showing on face

Sports media personality Dov Kleiman recently shared footage of San Francisco 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan’s first press conference from the 2017 NFL Combine. Kleiman then placed the coach’s current photo [from 2025 season] next to it.The NFL aggregator captioned it: “𝗧𝗥𝗘𝗡𝗗𝗜𝗡𝗚: 49ers HC Kyle Shanahan has gone viral with fans SHOCKED at how different he looks from his first press conference at the NFL combine compared to now. He literally looks like a completely different person. Kyle has aged 25 years in just nine seasons. [three exploding head emojis].”Nine seasons are nine long years. It is not nine days, weeks, or months, but years. Almost a decade. After nearly 10 years, facial aging begins to show: prominent wrinkles, sagging skin, loss of volume at the cheeks, thin skin, dryness, bone changes, and eventual loss of a youthful look.In 2017, Shanahan was 38 years old. In 2026, he will be 47 in Dec. From 38 to 47 is a span of 9 years, and certain facial changes are bound to appear. However, some cybercitizens say otherwise. They blame the substation next to Levi’s Stadium, claiming electromagnetic field from a nearby substate is somehow causing the aging effect on the head coach.“All those practices next to that power plant will do that to ya,” said one X user. Another speculated, “Probably that massive substation.” A third urged, “They really need to move that substation.” A fourth said, “You would too if you worked next to that power station.”A fifth user captioned: “Kyle Shanahan before and after experiencing the low-frequency electromagnetic field at the Niners practice facility” and shared images of Ian McDiarmid as Sheev Palpatine and his alter ego, Darth Sidious fromOne user blamed it on the head coach’s position and thanked X’s AI Grok for the answer, saying,“That’s ruff, take care of your body and mind yall ‘Shanahan's visible aging is far more plausibly explained by the brutal reality of being an NFL head coach: high stress, long hours, playoff disappointments, roster pressures, and the general toll of the job’ Thanks Grok.”Another wrote, “This is what happens when you play in the NFC west.” A third user expressed, “Thats what happens when half your roster is injured year after year.”A fourth user said, “Pressure is showing on his face,” while another called it “The Brandon Aiyuk effect.” There have been contract disputes with the 27-year-old wide receiver.Finally, a user declared, “He [Kyle Shanahan]’s almost 50 years old. He looks exactly his age.”","In 2017, Shanahan was 38 years old. In 2026, he will be 47 in Dec. From 38 to 47 is a span of 9 years, and certain facial changes are bound to appear.

Philadelphia prioritizes stability at quarterback as Brown’s frustration draws outside attention

Bill Belichick to Buffalo Bills? + Steelers, Giants, Eagles | Colin Cowherd: THE HERD NFL

The Philadelphia Eagles are entering the offseason with less uncertainty than the outside noise suggests. While speculation around AJ Brown continues to build, league insiders believe the organization has already settled its internal debate. Speaking on The Herd with Colin Cowherd podcast, Dianna Russini emphasized that the Eagles have no interest in letting the situation linger and cannot afford to repeat past mistakes.She explained that the team is committed to reshaping its approach for the upcoming season and has no intention of moving on from Jalen Hurts. If a choice must be made between Brown and Hurts, she pointed out that the organization will always side with the quarterback, especially one the owner strongly supports and who is also the reigning Super Bowl MVP.Russini made it clear where the Eagles stand, saying, “They’re not going to waste their time. They can’t go through what they just did again. This team has to revamp how they approach this season. And they’re not moving on from Jalen Hurts, right? So you’re picking AJ Brown, or you’re picking Jalen Hurts. Who are you picking? You’re picking the quarterback.”Hurts is the Super Bowl MVP, beloved by ownership, and the foundation of the franchise.Brown, meanwhile, has been open about his dissatisfaction. Russini further addressed that “He [A.J. Brown] is not happy. He was not happy going back to last year… So here we are this year. And, I think it’s going to be up to him. I think the bottom line [is] Philadelphia is not stupid.”Signs of tension surfaced as early as 2024, when Brandon Graham hinted at a strain between Hurts and Brown, saying, “11 [Brown] could be a little better with how he responds to things.” Brown’s one-word response after a quiet passing game, followed by a cryptic Bible verse post in 2025, only fueled speculation. Even after a reported positive meeting with Hurts and Saquon Barkley, Brown’s silence kept questions alive.On the field, Brown’s performance dipped despite crossing 1,000 yards. The offense leaned more on Dallas Goedert, and Brown averaged fewer catches and yards than in prior seasons. About Brown’s possibilities, Cowherd stated, “I think Buffalo should be interested.” Russini imagines Kansas City showing interest and the potential of pairing Brown with Patrick Mahomes",Dianna Russini said the Eagles have no intention of moving on from Jalen Hurts. Russini added that A.J. Brown is not happy with the way the team played last season. Brown has been open about his dissatisfaction with the team's direction.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127158608,imgsize-50660,width-400,resizemode-4/aj-brown-and-jalen-hurts.jpg"

Roman Josi’s journey to 1,000 NHL games, from overcoming injuries and leading the Nashville Predators



Roman Josi, Nashville’s leading defenseman, is set to join the 1,000-game club in the NHL when he attends his 1,000th game with the Nashville Predators against the Ottawa Senators this Thursday. At 35, Josi is the first player in Nashville history to join this prestigious group. He has been an integral part of Nashville since 2008.Over 15 seasons, Josi has established himself as one of the NHL’s elite defensemen. Drafted 38th overall in 2008, he has amassed 752 points (198 goals, 554 assists) in 999 games. A Norris Trophy winner in 2019-20 and two-time runner-up, he also leads Nashville in all-time points. Beyond statistics, Josi’s influence resonates in the locker room and in the wider hockey community, particularly in Switzerland, where he has helped inspire the next generation of NHL talent.Josi’s path to 1,000 games has been full of challenges. Last season, an upper-body injury and a POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome) diagnosis forced him to miss critical games. Returning to the league completely healthy for this season, he has so far racked up 28 points from 37 games played while logging a team-high ice time of 23:27 per game. Even coach Andrew Brunette of the Predators complimented his awareness as a player who raises his level of play when it’s required.Off the ice, Roman Josi’s professionalism and character stand out just as much as his play on it. His teammates, including Filip Forsberg, speak of his commitment, dedication, and example he sets for all of them. His desire to develop every day, the way he rises above injuries, as well as his passion for hockey, are all qualities that make him not only an impressive player on the field but also an idol for all those up-and-coming young stars waiting in the wings for their turn at the NHL. His character is an inspiration, not only on the field but as a role model as well.Looking ahead, Josi’s milestone comes just before the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milano Cortina, where he will represent Switzerland for the second time. With several NHL players on the team, Switzerland is aiming for its first Olympic medal since 1948. Josi’s experience and leadership will be important as the team faces the world’s best players.","Roman Josi is set to play his 1,000th NHL game against the Ottawa Senators on Thursday.

Charles Barkley reflects on his ESPN role and limited Inside the NBA appearances

How Charles Barkley turned retirement into media empire?

Hall of Famer Charles Barkley , who played as a power forward, has always been special both on and off the court. After a very successful basketball career, Barkley turned to broadcasting, where his sharp personality and basketball mind quickly made him a fan favorite. Joining “Inside The NBA” on TNT alongside Ernie Johnson, Shaquille O’Neal, and Kenny Smith, Barkley helped turn the show into more than just a pregame program for basketball fans across the country.Following TNT’s loss of NBA rights, the show’s future became uncertain. Instead of disappearing, Inside the NBA was licensed to ESPN, offering a new but different approach. While Barkley never wanted to appear on every ESPN platform, he has recently voiced frustration over the team’s limited airtime this season, sparking conversations about how the iconic crew fits into the network’s current basketball coverage.Despite the excitement of moving to ESPN, Barkley’s enthusiasm has been tempered by the network’s approach to the show. The first half of the NBA season saw very few appearances by the Inside the NBA team, leaving Barkley and his colleagues with less time to be present and analyze games in the way fans had expected. Recently on “The Dan LeBatard Show”, Barkley admitted:“When I was talking about working all the time, I’m not going to do all these d--- shows.I’m not going to be on ESPN 1, 2, 3, Deportes, Nacho, Echo, whatever they call it. I’m not going to be doing all that. But I wish we’d have been on more during the first half of the season.”Barkley added by saying:“Well, they can fire me. I got seven years left on my contract. I’m 100% retired, but if I can do something just a little bit stupid, so they have to fire me. They don’t have to pay me for the whole seven years”.Charles Barkley signed a 10-year, $210 million contract with ESPN in 2022, taking on the role of NBA analyst for the Inside the NBA” show when the show shifted from TNT, after ESPN bought the show's rights. Charles Barkley implied that even if he didn't want to be over consumed by the show, he wished the team had more opportunities to appear this season. For Barkley, it was not just about being on TV, but about keeping basketball spirit alive among fans.Charles Barkley’s shift from the NBA to broadcasting wasn’t a one-night thing. After his retirement from professional basketball in 2000, Barkley found a platform to showcase his personality and also his off-court talent. Barkley’s ability to break down the game for viewers made him a natural fit for television. Over the years, he became one of the most recognizable sports analysts, proving that his impact off the court was as influential as his legendary basketball career.After joining “Inside The NBA"", it gave Barkley a platform to combine his basketball knowledge with his lively personality. The show’s mix of serious sports analysis along with Barkley’s presence, helped define the program’s identity and helped him become a household name for fans.","Barkley joined the Inside the NBA team after TNT lost NBA rights to ESPN.

Amber Glenn opens up on finding freedom, newly found confidence, and consistency ahead of Milan Cortina Games 2026



Amber Glenn | Get to know Team USA figure skater from Plano, Texas, headed to 2026 Winter Olympics

Amber Glenn had just left the ice when she screamed in shock. She was standing in the cooldown area at the USA Figure Skating Championships when her score appeared on the screen. The number, 83.05, was the highest short program score ever recorded at a U.S. women’s championship. That moment set the tone for the rest of the event. Two days later, Glenn sealed her third straight national title. No American woman had done that in more than two decades.The win also earned Glenn a place on her first Olympic team. At the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics next month, she will have a chance to make history again. She could become the first U.S. woman to win an Olympic singles medal since 2006. The achievement is even more meaningful because Glenn once stepped away from skating. She doubted her future and focused on her mental health. Today, her personal growth and athletic success are closely linked.Amber Glenn believes her career changed after she came out publicly as bisexual and pansexual in 2019. She said that decision helped her feel free. She explained to NBC news that she no longer felt pushed to live up to someone else’s expectations.Instead, she could finally be herself on and off the ice. According to Outsports, she will be the first openly out woman to compete in figure skating at the Olympics.Glenn grew up in Plano, Texas, and trained near Dallas. Her coming-out moment happened quietly in a local LGBTQ news story. She later said she expected very little attention. In reality, the story spread quickly around the world. That sudden spotlight made her nervous. She worried about competing in other countries. She also feared how judges, sponsors, and fans might react.Figure skating relies on judging opinions. Glenn said that always scared her. She felt she did not match the traditional image of a female skater. She worried people might see her as less graceful or unfairly judge her appearance. Over time, she realized change had to start somewhere. She felt that being visible could help future athletes feel less afraid.Her fears never became reality. Glenn said her scores did not suffer. Fans showed support, including Pride flags in the stands. Sponsors stayed with her. Still, success did not come overnight. Injuries, concussions, and illness slowed her progress. She missed key moments early in her career.After the 2022 Olympics, Glenn made big changes. She moved to Colorado, changed coaches, and worked with a mental performance coach. Breathing techniques helped her manage pressure. Results followed. She won Grand Prix medals, a U.S. title, and later the Grand Prix Final.","Amber Glenn believes her career changed after she came out publicly as bisexual and pansexual in 2019.

How Wilbur Wood built a long career and earned baseball’s respect

Wilbur Wood, the legendary Major League Baseball pitcher known for his knuckleball, has died at the age of 84. The Chicago White Sox confirmed the news on January 17, 2026. Wood passed away at a hospital in Burlington, Massachusetts, where he had been living after retiring from baseball.Wood played 17 seasons in Major League Baseball, with 12 of those years spent with the Chicago White Sox. He also pitched for the Boston Red Sox and the Pittsburgh Pirates. After news of his death broke, fans and former players shared memories of him. Many described him as a quiet, kind man who worked hard and threw a pitch very few could ever control.Wilbur Wood was born on October 22, 1941, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He signed with the Boston Red Sox and made his major league debut at age 19 on June 30, 1961.From there, Wood had a long journey before finding his greatest success with the Chicago White Sox.Wood became famous for throwing the knuckleball, a pitch that moves in strange ways and is very hard for hitters to hit. He mastered it and made it his signature pitch, which helped him last a long time in the majors.From 1967 to 1978, Wood appeared in hundreds of games for the White Sox.He was selected as an American League All-Star three times (1971, 1972, and 1974). He had four seasons with 20 or more wins, an achievement very few pitchers reach.One of his most amazing seasons came in 1972, when Wood pitched an incredible 376⅔ innings, a remarkable total that still stands out in baseball history.That same year he also started 49 games, a number no pitcher had reached since the early 1900s.Over his 17-year career, Wood finished with a 164–156 win-loss record, 1,411 strikeouts, and a 3.24 earned run average (ERA). He retired after the 1978 season, leaving behind a legacy of endurance and quiet greatness.Teammates, coaches, and fans remember Wood not just for his numbers, but for the way he played the game.“He was one of the toughest pitchers I ever saw,” one former White Sox player said on social media after Wood’s death.After news of his passing spread, the White Sox sent their condolences to his family, friends, and fans. The team said Wood was more than a pitcher, he was part of White Sox history.Former White Sox executive Roland Hemond said in a tribute, “Wilbur was a real competitor and a good man. He gave his all every day on the mound.”Fans also shared memories on social media, praising Wood for his toughness and character.Even now, many baseball historians say Wood’s records and unique pitching style will be talked about for years.His work with the knuckleball changed how many teams look at that pitch and the pitchers who throw it.","Wilbur Wood played 17 seasons in Major League Baseball, with 12 of those years spent with the Chicago White Sox.

Allan Donald on Virat Kohli’s legacy: Can he reach 100 centuries?

DHAKA/NEW DELHI: Bangladesh said on Thursday its cricket team will not travel to India for the upcoming T20 World Cup due to “genuine security risks”. On Wednesday, the International Cricket Council board had dismissed Bangladesh’s concerns regarding the safety of its players and fans in India, and rejected their demand that the team’s games be shifted out of India.“We’ll go back to ICC with our plan to play in Sri Lanka,” BCB president Aminul Islam said. “They gave us a 24-hour ultimatum but a global body can’t really do that. ICC will miss out on 200 million viewers (if Bangladesh is axed). It will be their loss...” BCB was responding to ICC’s deadline, after a meeting Thursday between board officials, players and the interim govt’s sports adviser. Bangladesh could be replaced by another team in the Feb 7-March 8 World Cup.“Bangladesh is not travelling to India to play the World Cup due to security risk — this is a decision made by Bangladesh govt. No other entity has any right to take this decision,” Asif Nazrul, sports adviser in the Muhammad Yunus-led interim govt, said.Nazrul’s statement overrode Bangladesh Cricket Board’s (BCB) attempts to negotiate and directly challenged the ICC’s insistence on the original schedule.“There has been no change in the security risk situation regarding playing in India at present. This concern is not based on any abstract or hypothetical idea. Rather, the concern stems from a real incident in which the Indian cricket board ( BCCI ) failed to provide security to one of our top players ( Mustafizur Rahman ) under pressure from extremists, and he was asked to leave India,” Nazrul said.The BCB and Nazrul, however, said Bangladesh still hopes ICC will do justice. There are many precedents in the world where matches are played at a different venue due to security risks and “we have not given up hope yet”, he said.“We are hopeful that ICC will give us the opportunity to play in Sri Lanka,” Nazrul said.Islam reiterated that ICC could have allowed the same arrangement as the one BCCI and Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) have where the two teams don’t travel to each other’s countries and play each other only at neutral venues. ICC struck down that suggestion.The ICC will only initiate a process to name a replacement team after the BCB formally communicates its decision.TOI has learnt that BCB president Aminul Islam has been making frantic calls to ICC in hope to find a middle path. The BCB will stand to lose around $500,000 in participation fees besides match fees and prize money from the tournament as per the ICC structure.",Bangladesh says its cricket team will not travel to India for the upcoming T20 World Cup due to “genuine security risks” International Cricket Council board had dismissed Bangladesh’s concerns regarding the safety of its players and fans in India. Bangladesh could be replaced by another team in the Feb 7-March 8 World Cup.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127232513,imgsize-205230,width-400,resizemode-4/bangladesh-cricket-team.jpg"

Arshdeep Singh press conference: on adapting to conditions, team roles & bowling plans | IND vs NZ 1st T20I

Poll Do you believe Abhishek Sharma's aggressive batting approach is the key to India's success? Yes No

RAIPUR: Abhishek Sharma has evolved into one of the most destructive T20I batters in recent times, but that does not stop him from continuing to seek improvement.After playing a crucial role in Wednesday’s win over New Zealand, the left-hander dissected his weakness, where he stated that he “doesn’t have a lot of shots” at his disposal and how he depends more on his “timing” to hit the ball over the boundary, as muscling it is not his forte.But he makes up for it with his ultraaggressive approach and not allowing bowlers to settle. That method has brought him rewards, and India the results. Post the 2024 T20 World Cup, the 25-year-old has hit the most sixes among full member nations, with 81 maximums from 33 innings, but if one thinks he just deals in sixes, you are mistaken, as he keeps rotating the strike as well. In Nagpur, where he hit eight sixes off the 35 balls he faced, but only seven of those deliveries were dots, including the ball on which he was dismissed.That “intent” to go hard from ball one has worked wonders for India as well.Since Abhishek’s debut, they never lost a match after posting 200-plus totals. With the Punjab batter in the mix of things, Men in Blue have crossed that mark on 10 occasions and won all those matches. During those wins, he has scored two centuries and three fifties.The numbers get scary when Sanju Samson is thrown in the mix of things, as eight of those wins came when both opened the innings, and either of them went on to score 50-plus runs in seven innings. Samson himself scored three centuries during that period.With Shubman Gill struggling to get going at the top, the team management decided to reunite the former partners ahead of a home T20 World Cup, in anticipation that they will reproduce the same fireworks.In the first T20I, Samson fell for a 7-ball 10, while Abhishek went on to score a 35-ball 84. They have another four matches to fine-tune things, starting with the second T20I at Raipur’s Shaheed Veer Narayan Singh International Cricket Stadium on Friday. In Nagpur, they dominated the game while scripting a 48-run win. The batters never wavered from their plan, and the bowlers gave crucial breakthroughs to keep the Kiwis in check.It has been a topsy-turvy home season for India, which saw them suffer defeats in the Test series against South Africa and the recent ODIs against the Black Caps, but when it comes to the shortest format, they look assured with their eyes fixed on the big prize.","India beat New Zealand by 48 runs in the first T20I in Nagpur.

Jay Shah’s 2036 Olympic blueprint for India: '8 Medals won’t cut it'

Having suffered three consecutive losses, the Gujarat Giants staged a comeback to secure a comprehensive 45-run victory over UP Warriorz at the BCA Stadium in Vadodara on Thursday. Their resurgence was built on Sophie Devine’s fighting 50, a disciplined bowling performance highlighted by Rajeshwari Gayakwad’s threewicket haul, and a significant dose of fortune.Chasing 154, the Warriorz’ reply was undermined by two bizarre dismissals. Kiran Navgire was unluckily stumped after the ball deflected off the keeper’s pads, while Meg Lanning inadvertently knocked the ball onto the stumps with her thigh pad.Reduced to 39/2 within the fifth over, the chase was further dented when Phoebe Litchfield (32 off 27) was dismissed by Ashleigh Gardner in the eighth over. In the space of just six balls, Harleen Deol (3 off 12) also departed for the pavilion. When Deepti Sharma (4 off 7) was dismissed shortly after, the required run rate skyrocketed to 9.5, and the Warriorz crumbled.Rajeshwari ended with figures of 3-16, and Renuka Singh Thakur claimed 2-20.Later, Devine (2/16) wrapped up the proceedings. Earlier, UP Warriorz restricted Gujarat Giants to 153/8 after Kranti Gaud struck twice in the Powerplay and the spinners maintained pressure through the middle overs.Before Thursday’s game, Kranti delivered economical spells for the UP Warriorz but found wickets elusive, with just one dismissal in five prior outings. However, on Thursday she flipped the script during the Powerplay.Opting to bowl first, the Warriorz were given an early advantage when Kranti used the new ball incisively, striking twice in quick succession. Her impressive start was seamlessly followed by the spinners, who applied relentless pressure through the middle overs.SCORES: Gujarat Giants 153/8 (Sophie Devine 50, Beth Mooney 38, Kranti Gaud 2/18) bt UP Warriorz 108 in 17.3 overs (Phobe Litchfield 32, Chloe Tryon 30, Rajeshwari Gayakwad 3/16, Renuka Singh 2/20, Sophie Devide 2/16)","Gujarat Giants staged a comeback to secure a comprehensive 45-run victory over UP Warriorz at the BCA Stadium in Vadodara on Thursday.

Candace Owens questions influence behind Brooklyn Beckham’s family break

IN MY LAWSUIT ERA: Our First 'Cease And Desist' Of 2026. | Candace Ep 294





The Beckham family rift has spilled far beyond private conversations, and now it is fueling a wider public clash. What began as cryptic Instagram posts has grown into a cultural flashpoint, drawing in commentators well outside the celebrity orbit. At the center of the latest escalation is Candace Owens, who used her podcast to weigh in on Brooklyn Beckham’s allegations against his famous parents.The debate sharpened after Brooklyn Beckham publicly accused Victoria Beckham and David Beckham of undermining his marriage to Nicola Peltz. His decision to cut off contact and insist on legal communication added fuel to an already tense narrative. Owens did not treat it gently.During her podcast, Owens framed Brooklyn’s actions as learned behavior, directly linking his response to what she described as Nicola Peltz’s past conduct. She questioned the legal boundary Brooklyn reportedly set with his parents and pointed to Peltz as the influence behind it.""Where is he learning that behavior from? Well, Nicola, it's what she does. It's a thing. She sues people over and over again when she doesn't get what she wants. She sues them because she experiences anxiety if she's told no. And she sues them when she wants to deal with her emotions.""Owens broadened her critique by placing the situation in a historical context, referencing other high-profile marriages that strained powerful families.She mocked what she portrayed as a lack of perspective, especially surrounding wedding disputes that Brooklyn previously raised online.""She had to get her wedding dress designed by Valentino Couture. Oh my gosh, the horror.""Owens also challenged Brooklyn’s claims about his mother’s behavior at the wedding, citing reports that the event included multiple dances and questioning why a late-night moment became a breaking point.""They had their first dance...And then late night started at 11:00 p.m...Nothing counts after 11:00 p.m. at a wedding... Victoria Beckham, do I think she was a little sloshed by 11 p.m.? Yeah, I do. I think she was... I bet Vicki B was boogieing. I bet she became Cardi B, and she was all over the place. But this is what you're ending the relationship over?""As the family silence deepens, the fallout now lives in podcasts, posts, and public judgment, with no sign that the tension is easing anytime soon.","Candace Owens criticized Brooklyn Beckham after he publicly accused his parents of undermining his marriage to Nicola Peltz.
