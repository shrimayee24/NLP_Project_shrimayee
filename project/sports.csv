As we turn 76 as a constitutional Republic, we should underline a lesserknown and unique facet of the Gita and the Bible of our governance. Most constitutions begin with black letter law; ours begins with art. If the aim of art is to represent not the outward appearance of things, but their inward significance, the best metaphor for the Indian Republic is a document that speaks to the soul before it speaks to the statute.India’s Constitution is widely celebrated as a legal masterpiece, a visionary consolidation of checks, balances, rights and responsibilities. But buried in the book is a quieter triumph: 22 handdrawn illustrations, each accompanying one of its first 22 Parts, and rendering a book of law into a living tapestry of our civilisational spirit.Nandalal Bose and his Shantiniketan associates were not decorating after the fact. They were intentionally and symbolically rendering the spirit of each constitutional Part. It is spirit, not text, that is reflected in the design. With each page we turn, we step into an art gallery of Indian being.This is where aesthetics meet authority. There are a handful of countries where the Constitution is also a work of art.Ours is one of them.Crafted in flowing calligraphy by Prem Raizada and illumined by Bose’s team, the Constitution is handwritten, hand-painted and heart-born. Every page radiates an aesthetic that marries legal form with cultural substance. The intricate patterns of the Preamble, the artistic flourish of the Ashokan Emblem, the quiet reverence of Himalayan magnificence: each stroke reminds us that beauty is not superficial, but constitutional.The artists, paid Rs 25 per page, made priceless manuscripts, which are today enshrined in helium-filled chambers in the Parliament Library, more revered than rare manuscripts, more sacred than statute books. As an illustrated ‘Gita of Governance’, the Constitution’s illustrated manuscript does not shout but whispers in ink. Its 22 illustrations serve as metaphors for the Parts they accompany, symbols that communicate through visual language the values, dilemmas and aspirations that laws alone cannot express.For instance, the pairing of Part III on Fundamental Rights with the conquest of Lanka by Lord Rama is no accident. It evokes the triumph of dharma over tyranny. The depiction of the Dandi March alongside Part XVII on official language is not a coincidence; it is a subtle nod to linguistic unity as an act of peaceful assertion. These aren’t annotations; they are visual philosophies.Such symbolic pairings do more than inform; they inspire. They transform the Constitution from a legal text into a national epic, in equal parts scripture, statute and story.The illustrated Constitution is a Republic in technicolor, where India is illustrated on every page: an India that is inclusive, plural, layered, and luminous. From the seals of Mohenjodaro to the Himalayas, from Nalanda’s scholarly calm to Noakhali’s pain, these illustrations span centuries, religions, regions and ideologies.This is not an India of slogans, but of symbols. Buddha and Mahavira stand alongside Netaji and Shivaji. It is a great way of conveying how the Indian philosophy consists of two binary elements — Yuddha (war) and Buddha (peace). Ashoka canvases along with Lakshmibai. Ram and Krishna converse with Guru Gobind Singh. These are not political choices; they are civilisational ones. The message is profound: India is not made by any one moment or man, but by the multitude.Each page tells a story — not just of governance, but of a people’s quest for meaning, dignity and justice. The illustrations don’t just depict India’s past; they foreshadow its constitutional future. They also reveal the imagination of our founding fathers — men and women who dreamt of a document that did not merely prescribe but evoked, that did not merely legislate but inspired. In doing so, they gave us a map of memory, a charter of culture and a mirror of our moral fibre.In an age of black-andwhite binaries, these lush illustrations are a reminder that Indian constitutionalism is not a single tone; it is a rainbow of responsibilities and rights, shades of heritage and hope. Such images comprise an unspoken preamble, another level of overture — a visual message of the part of the mind that believes, that preps the soul before the brain engages. This document is not just a blueprint for governance. It is a mirror of our moral inheritance.Where other constitutions speak in articles and amendments, ours breathes through allegory and art. This is not ornamental. It is transformative. The illustrated Constitution serves as a counter-narrative to the sterile image of law. It reveals that justice, too, can be beautiful. Democracy, too, can be drawn. Nationhood, too, can be painted.These illustrations also turn the Indian Constitution into an entity reflecting India’s unique constitutional identity. What other Constitution dares to blend Shiva’s cosmic dance with federal finance, or show Akbar while listing bureaucratic services? Where else do deserts, oceans and ancient sculptures frame legal architecture? The uniqueness of our illustrated Constitution lies in its fusion of text and texture, its legal gravitas softened by visual grace. It is India’s original ‘living document’, long before the courts used that phrase.The manuscript’s USP is its humanity, its ability to speak to citizens as much through sight as through statute. It underscores an oft-ignored truth: a Constitution is not just a legal contract; it is a cultural compact. It must speak to the head and the heart, to the reason and the rasa (aesthetic essence). The illustrated Constitution accomplishes this with quiet dignity.In an era of quick fixes and digital templates, the Indian Constitution’s illustrated version is a slow, deliberate and divine act of nation-building. It reflects the care with which India imagined herself. Not just legally, but visually, morally and spiritually.The 22 illustrations are India’s constitutional haiku — short, symbolic and stirring. They are not footnotes. In their silence, they speak. In their stillness, they move. And in their artistry, they awaken a nation’s conscience. They make the Indian Constitution a testament to timelessness.","As we turn 76 as a constitutional Republic, we should underline a lesserknown and unique facet of the Gita and the Bible of our governance.

Mark Tully dies at 90: Born in Kolkata to British parents; how BBC journalist made India his home,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mark-tully-dies-at-90-born-in-kolkata-to-british-parents-how-bbc-journalist-made-india-his-home/articleshow/127473310.cms,".

NEW DELHI: Mark Tully, one of the most well-known journalists to report from India, died at a private hospital in Delhi on Sunday. He was 90. He had been unwell for some time and was admitted to Max Hospital in Saket last week.Born in 1935 in Tollygunge, Kolkata, to British parents, Tully spent his early childhood in India. In the late 1930s, he was not allowed to socialise with local people. Ironically, India later became the centre of his life’s work.He studied at a boarding school in Darjeeling before being sent to England for further education. In a 2001 interview with the BBC after being selected for knighthood, Tully described England as “a very miserable place… dark and drab, without the bright skies of India”.The BBC reintroduced Tully to India in 1964 when it appointed him its New Delhi correspondent. This marked the beginning of his long association with the broadcaster, which lasted nearly three decades.In 1969, Tully was sent back to London after the Indian government barred the BBC following the broadcast of Phantom India, a French documentary critical of the country. He returned to Delhi in 1971 and became the BBC’s South Asia bureau chief the next year.During his career, Tully covered several defining moments in the region, including the 1971 Bangladesh war, the Emergency, the execution of former Pakistan president Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Operation Blue Star, the assassination of Indira Gandhi, the anti-Sikh riots of 1984, the killing of Rajiv Gandhi in 1991, and the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992.His first book, Amritsar: Mrs Gandhi’s Last Battle (1985), co-written with Satish Jacob, focused on Operation Blue Star and the Punjab crisis. In No Full Stops in India (1988), he wrote, “The stories I tell in this book will, I hope, serve to illustrate the way in which Western thinking has distorted and still distorts Indian life.”Tully went on to write 10 books, both fiction and non-fiction, including India in Slow Motion (2002), India’s Unending Journey (2008), and India: The Road Ahead.He was awarded the Padma Shri in 1992, knighted in 2002, and received the Padma Bhushan in 2005.Tully resigned from the BBC in 1994 after publicly criticising the organisation’s internal culture. However, he remained based in Delhi and continued writing as a freelance journalist.On his 90th birthday in October, his son Sam Tully wrote on LinkedIn: “I think my father’s achievements are particularly significant for UK-India ties because of his abiding ties and affection for both countries… ‘Dil hai Hindustani, magar thoda Angrezi bhi!’”","Mark Tully, one of the most well-known journalists to report from India, died at a private hospital in Delhi on Sunday.

Hinterland's 'unsung heroes' on Padma rolls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hinterlands-unsung-heroes-on-padma-rolls/articleshow/127517968.cms,"ANI file photo

.

NEW DELHI: In keeping with its practice of taking the Padma awards' focus away from big cities and well-known names and to recognise hinterland talents in a wide spectrum of fields, the Modi govt picked this year's awardees from 84 districts spread across 30 states and UTs. Ten districts figure on the list for the first time since Independence, officials noted.Among such ""unsung heroes"", as officials described them, are Taga Ram Bheel, recognised for reviving Rajasthan's fading folk instrument Algoza, and Meghalaya-based environmentalist Hally War.Former Indian tennis star Vijay Amritraj, based in the US, is among the six Padma Bhushan awardees under foreigners/NRI/PIO/OCI.A maximum 15 winners are officially from Maharashtra, including the likes of actors Dharmendra and R Madhavan - one of the key characters in 'Dhurandhar', said to have been inspired by NSA Ajit Doval - who found their calling in the state, followed by 13 from Tamil Nadu and 11 each from West Bengal and UP. Eight each are from Karnataka and Kerala, including Vellappally Natesan, a functionary of SNDP - an outfit that has positioned itself as the vehicle of Izhavas, the single most numerically preponderant caste in Kerala - and a BJP ally in Tamil Nadu.Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Kerala are heading to assembly polls, though official sources were quick to point out that govt has annually tried to give a diverse representation regionally, selecting the awardees from 84 districts across the country.Former IPS officer K Vijay Kumar, associated with the killing of notorious sandalwood smuggler Veerappan, Armind Fernandez, who established Asia's first human milk bank, and ex-Prasar Bharati CEO Shashi Shekhar Vempati, hockey player Savita Punia are among the other Padma winners besides politicians Bhagat Singh Kosher and late V K Malhotra, both from BJP.Achuthanandhan, a vocal and popular former Kerala CM, and Soren join other veteran politicians from non-BJP backgrounds like Mulayam Singh Yadav and Ram Vilas Paswan who got Padma recognition from this govt.Padma Shri awardees include former MHA functionary R V Mani, who had protested against a change of affidavit in the Ishrat Jehan encounter case. In his book, 'Hindu Terror: Insider account of Ministry of Home Affairs 2006-2010', Mani alleged he was pressured by the UPA govt to sign a second affidavit that fabricated a narrative of ""Saffron Terror"".Officials said govt made extensive efforts to identify achievers from all corners, highlighting that over 39,000 nominations were received and evaluated through an exhaustive and rigorous process of multiple rounds of scrutiny and consultation with ministry, state administration and domain experts. Awardees included 48 super senior citizens (80 years and above) and many from traditionally deprived sections of society."," Modi govt picks awardees from 84 districts spread across 30 states and UTs.

CHENNAI:

Rhinoceros, now found only in the swampy grasslands and riverine forests of Assam, Bengal and Uttar Pradesh, roamed the foothills of the Western Ghats near Coimbatore some 3,500 years ago, archaeologists say.A team identified four bone fragments — two metacarpals and two carpals of the foot of an Indian rhino — at Molapalayam, a neolithic site. During the two seasons of excavations in 2021 and 2024 at the site, archaeologists unearthed a huge collection of bone fragments of 28 species of animals, including the Indian rhino.“The anatomical features of the bones match the rhino bones available in the reference collection,” said Abhayan G S, a faculty member at the department of archaeology, University of Kerala, who studied the samples with research scholar Ajith M.This is the third such find in south India after the bone fragments of a rhino were found in Payyampalli in Tirupattur district, and a fragmented skull of a fossilised rhino in Sathankulam in Tuticorin district. “This is a significant find as rhinos survived up to the middle of the second millennium BCE. According to the current zoogeography, the animal is restricted to Assam and north-eastern plains of India,” Abhayan said.The animal needs grasslands and marshes. “The foothills of the Western Ghats might have had grassland, as a single rhino requires many square kilometres of grassland for food,” said zooarchaeologist Pramod Joglekar, a retired professor of archaeology at Deccan College.“In Gujarat and Haryana, too, we found bone remains of the Indian rhino from the Harappan period. We also found bone remains in Odisha. It shows that rhinos were once spread across the Indian subcontinent,” he said.Archaeologist V Selvakumar of the department of maritime history and maritime archaeology at Tamil University, Thanjavur, who excavated the Molapalayam site, presented a paper on the finding at an international symposium on recent scientific studies in archaeology of Tamil Nadu in Madurai on Saturday.“A faunal analysis reveals that people who lived here constituted a pastoral community that reared cattle, sheep and goat. They also hunted animals such as deer and antelope. Their food also included a diverse range of small millets and pulses,” Selvakumar said.Researchers Sathish Naik and Aditya of Deccan College identified plants from the site. An analysis of bone fragments at the site found 28 species of animals, including cattle, buffalo, goat, sheep, pig and dog, and wild animals such as nilgai, blackbuck, four-horned antelope, gazelle, chital and sambar deer, besides the Indian rhino.Radiocarbon dating has assigned 1,600 BCE to 1,400 BCE as the period of the site.","Rhinoceros roamed the foothills of the Western Ghats near Coimbatore some 3,500 years ago.

"'Where can they go?': After Shakeel Ahmed, Rashid Alvi flags 'communication gap' within Congress",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/where-can-they-go-after-shakeel-ahmed-rashid-alvi-flags-communication-gap-within-congress/articleshow/127466507.cms,"NEW DELHI: A day after former Congress leader Shakeel Ahmed’s scathing remarks against Rahul Gandhi, veteran leader Rashid Alvi on Sunday said that the lack of an effective platform for dialogue and limited access to the top leadership has created a serious communication gap within the organisation.Speaking to news agency ANI, Alvi said party workers complain that it is not easy to meet the Congress high command.“I haven’t seen Shakeel ji’s statement, but a major problem in the Congress party is that there is no forum where issues can be discussed. It is generally difficult to meet leaders. If people want to express their concerns, where can they go? Not everyone is a member of the CWC. There is definitely a communication gap. This is a major problem within the Congress party, and many people complain that it is not easy to meet the Congress high command. This communication gap must be eliminated,” Alvi said.He added that former prime ministers Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi made time to meet everyone.Alvi also raised concerns over the exit of several Muslim leaders from the grand old party and said that if Muslim leadership continues to be ignored, leaders like Asaduddin Owaisi will keep emerging.“Muslim leaders have not left out of greed for power. They have left, and this is a matter of concern, because Muslim leadership has been ignored in the Congress party,” Alvi said.“If Muslim leadership is ignored, then leaders like Owaisi will continue to emerge in the country. Today, Owaisi is becoming a powerful force,” he added.‘Must engage in comprehensive internal dialogue’Meanwhile, Congress leader Anant Gadgil also called for urgent “introspection” following the party’s lacklustre performance in the recent Maharashtra municipal elections.He said the Congress must reconnect with its core workers and rural base to survive. Gadgil stressed that the party needs to look inward at a time when the political discourse is dominated by the BJP’s victory and internal bickering within the ruling Mahayuti over mayoral posts.“Instead of holding any single individual responsible, the party must engage in a comprehensive internal dialogue,” Gadgil said.He also said that with rapid urbanisation in Maharashtra, the Congress must promote leaders who command genuine public respect and middle-class support, moving beyond the traditional arithmetic of “money and caste”.This comes after former Congress MP Shakeel Ahmed attacked Rahul Gandhi over the party’s consistent electoral failures.Taking a jibe at Rahul Gandhi, Ahmed said, “Even if Rahul Gandhi wants, he still can’t take Congress below the second position. The reason is that every other party is only in one state.”He also claimed that the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha is “uncomfortable” collaborating with popular veteran leaders.“There is no internal democracy in the Congress party. Whatever Rahul Gandhi says is final,” Ahmed alleged.This is not the first time a party leader has complained about lack of access to the Congress leadership. Recently, former Odisha MLA Mohammed Moquim wrote to Sonia Gandhi, calling for “open-heart surgery” in the party and flagging a growing disconnect between the leadership and workers.In his five-page letter, Moquim said he had not been granted an audience with Rahul Gandhi for nearly three years. “This is not a personal grievance … but a reflection of a wider emotional disconnect felt by workers across India, who feel unseen and unheard,” he wrote.",Rashid Alvi says lack of effective platform for dialogue and limited access to top leadership has created a serious communication gap. Alvi also raised concerns over the exit of several Muslim leaders from the grand old party.

Writing from middle, not end



Moments over milestones



Power of the ordinary



Once the preserve of people who had lived long, complicated lives — ageing film stars, war survivors, Nobel laureates — memoirs now follow a different timetable. From bookstore front tables to literary fest panels across India, writers in their twenties and thirties are redefining what a memoir looks like, and who gets to tell it.These are not tales of epic achievement or reflections after retirement, but lives still in motion with millennials and GenZs sharing their tales of growing up queer or disabled, surviving political violence, navigating family expectations, illness, ambition, and the ordinary challenges of becoming an adult, somewhere mid-journey.One such writer is K Vaishali, who was just 24 when she first thought of writing her life story. Growing up as a lesbian and dyslexic person in India, her life had been a tug of war between secrets and confessions — at home and on university campus — navigating double marginalisation. Even as the urge to pen her story grew, so did the hesitation.“I thought hiding under the garb of fiction would be easier. It was my editor who pushed me to make it a memoir,” says the author, now 33. While working on the book, Vaishali discovered queer memoirs by Western writers but struggled to find Indian reference points.“I wanted young people to know there is hope. I didn’t have that growing up,” she says.While many writers wrestle with questions about the relevance of their life story, Sanjana Ramachandran never did. Growing up in a Tamil Brahmin family, she was just 17 when she knew her “filmy” life had to be written about. Ramachandran never climbed Everest or entered the Limca Book of Records, but did something many women of her generation would recognise: appeared for competitive exams, pursued engineering followed by an MBA, clashed with a strict father, and explored her politics and sexuality. Titled ‘Famous Last Questions’, the memoir came out last year. She was 31.“There was no way to not write it,” she says. While working on the book, Ramachandran realised how closely her experiences mirrored those of other ’90s kids in India who lived double lives at home and struggled to be themselves. “I knew it would be helpful to me and to some others, no matter how small or large the number.”A similar zeal defined Tarini Mohan’s ‘Lifequake’, which traces how the young development professional’s life was turned upside down after an accident that led to a traumatic brain injury at 23. A decade later she began writing the book, eager to capture the details in case they became blurry later. “I didn't want it to be inspiring or a success story about ‘overcoming’ limitations, just a normal girl’s journey,” she says. “I hate that word. You don’t overcome disability. You live with it.” In the book, Mohan is vulnerable as she talks about not just slipping in and out of coma, but everyday things she took for granted. “Like going out dancing.”While personal stories are the staple of memoirs, some writers are also trying to find a balance between the political and the personal. Zara Chowdhary’s ‘The Lucky Ones’ recounts her 16-yearold self navigating the Gujarat riots of 2002 with family, and how that violence changed their lives.“I was always keenly aware of the lapses and voids. Memory, whether my own or that of survivors within my household or the larger community, is pliant. The gaps often tell a more profound story. Different versions only reveal how all nonfiction is also ultimately fiction,” she says.In the memoir, which was recently awarded the Shakti Bhatt Prize, the writer not only documents her family’s story but also braids it together with other witness accounts, and how the aftermath of the violence was navigated over generations. “It’s about keeping one’s conscience at the centre of one’s writing,” she adds, “and asking what is still urgent or relevant.”Tara Khandelwal, editor and founder of storytelling agency Bound, says such examples show that the definition of ‘memoir’ is finally changing in India. “There’s a growing awareness that a memoir doesn’t have to be the chronological story of your life from point A to Z. It can be about a year or a particular episode in one’s life,” says Khandelwal.To tap into this curiosity, Bound recently launched a new imprint, ‘Moments’. The submissions so far range from grandchildren writing about grandparents to a young cybercrime specialist documenting their cases. “Truth is sometimes stranger than fiction,” Khandelwal says. “That’s what makes it tick.”Another is “personal branding” in an age of algorithm-driven social media platforms, points out Karthika V K, publisher at Westland Books. “There’s a change in the way that personal experience rubs up against public expression. It’s no longer only the very senior or obviously successful person whose lives are worth sharing,” she says.This, of course, means that there are shallow narratives and vanity projects alongside many more courageous and inspiring attempts to articulate lived experience of conflict, growth, achievement and failure. From startup CEOs and social media influencers to therapists and young parents.“Selective or partial memoirs are now far more popular than the conventional autobiography,” she says. “And where readers are interested, publishers will follow.”","From bookstore front tables to literary fest panels across India, writers in their twenties and thirties are redefining what a memoir looks like, and who gets to tell it. These are not tales of epic achievement or reflections after retirement, but lives still in motion with millennials and GenZs.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127443426,imgsize-986965,width-400,resizemode-4/127443426.jpg"
Cooper Kupp’s wife Anna sparks debate after wearing Seahawks coat against Rams in NFC Championship showdown,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/cooper-kupps-wife-anna-sparks-debate-after-wearing-seahawks-coat-against-rams-in-nfc-championship-showdown/articleshow/127513903.cms,"Cooper Kupp and wife Anna Marie (Instagram)

Cooper Kupp finds strength in family as Seahawks journey turns personal



Cooper Kupp stood at the center of one of the most emotional Sundays of the NFL season, carrying history, heartbreak, and hope into a championship stage. Once celebrated as the face of a Super Bowl comeback in Los Angeles, the veteran wide receiver now wears different colors with the same quiet fire. The moment felt heavy and personal, shaped not just by football, but by family, loyalty, and a career that refuses to slow down.At 32, Kupp understands how quickly the league moves on. The Rams chose not to meet his expectations in free agency, closing a chapter that included a Super Bowl MVP and countless clutch catches. Seattle did not hesitate. A three year, $45 million deal with $17.5 million guaranteed gave him a fresh start, and it placed him face to face with the past sooner than anyone expected.The NFC Championship Game against Los Angeles was more than a playoff matchup. It was a collision of memories. Kupp embraced former teammates Matthew Stafford and Puka Nacua before kickoff, sharing smiles that hinted at mutual respect and unfinished emotions. Then he turned toward the stands, where his true support system waited.Anna Marie Kupp and their three sons made their presence impossible to miss. Cooper Jameson, born in 2018, Cypress Stellar, born in 2021, and Solas Reign, born in 2023, proudly wore Seahawks gear and Kupp jerseys.Anna added a custom “10” coat, blending style with meaning. The image spoke louder than words. This was a family fully committed to the next chapter.Their bond has deep roots. Cooper and Anna met as teenagers at a high school track meet in Washington, when she handed him a medal after a race. He has often described that moment as love at first sight. They married in 2015, long before the bright lights of Super Bowls and free agency drama.In a June 2022 conversation with PEOPLE, Kupp described his wife as the ""absolute warrior"" of their family. That strength has carried them through relocations, injuries, and now a rivalry that feels personal. Anna once shared a heartfelt note about moving back to the Pacific Northwest, a return that felt both emotional and empowering.For Cooper Kupp, revenge is not loud. It lives in preparation, precision, and purpose. Surrounded by family and fueled by unfinished business, he stepped onto the field not just to beat his former team, but to honor the journey that brought him there.","Cooper Kupp signed a three year, $45 million deal with $17.5 million guaranteed with the Seattle Seahawks.

Will Drake Maye play against the Denver Broncos today?

He has a chance to achieve something the franchise has never done by winning a playoff game in Denver. With the Patriots unbeaten on the road this season, Maye leads a confident team into a hostile, high-altitude environment.

Drake Maye injury update and what it means for New England

History hangs heavy in Denver, especially for the New England Patriots. The thin air, the noise, and the playoff scars of the past all return this weekend as the AFC Championship sets the stage for something the franchise has never pulled off. This is not about nostalgia or legacy alone. It is about opportunity, pressure, and a quarterback stepping into a moment that once swallowed even the greatest names.The Patriots arrive with momentum and belief. Road games have become their comfort zone this season, not a burden. The stakes could not be higher, and the quarterback at the center of it all understands exactly what is in front of him. Denver offers no sympathy, only resistance, history, and a direct path to the Super Bowl.Drake Maye is healthy and will start for the New England Patriots against the Denver Broncos in Sunday’s AFC Championship Game. No injury designation followed Maye into the weekend, clearing the way for him to lead an offense chasing history in one of the league’s toughest playoff environments.Maye has a rare chance to do something not even Tom Brady managed in a Patriots uniform. New England is winless in four playoff games played in Denver, with Brady going 0 for 3.That context is not lost on the rookie quarterback.“Just the AFC championship, the chance to go to the Super Bowl. That’d be huge,” Maye said. “Another road environment that’s had success in the past. … I know it would be a big-time win.”The Patriots earned this opportunity by beating Houston in the divisional round and finishing the regular season unbeaten on the road. That mentality has been reinforced all year under head coach Mike Vrabel.“Coach (Vrabel) has always been saying, ‘Road warriors,’” Maye said. “So, we’re trying to find that one more time and finish out strong what we’ve done this year.”Denver’s home record and altitude remain real obstacles, but New England enters healthy at quarterback and confident in its approach. For Maye, availability is not the question. Execution is.","Drake Maye is healthy and will start for the New England Patriots against the Denver Broncos in Sunday’s AFC Championship Game.

Shannon Sharpe's rise from being a college football standout in a tiny town to one of the most powerful voices in American sports media is also a narrative of consistent financial success. He had made a lot of money by 2025, not just from his NFL career but also from a very successful second act in television, podcasts, and business.He is widely regarded as one of the greatest tight ends in NFL history, transitioning smoothly from the field to the studio. That move proved just as profitable as his playing days.According to Celebrity Net Worth, Shannon Sharpe’s net worth is estimated to be around $30 million in 2025. His wealth came from his time as a player. He was picked in the seventh round in 1990, yet he went on to win three Super Bowls with the Denver Broncos and Baltimore Ravens. Sharpe made over $22.3 million in compensation over 14 NFL seasons. A strong figure for his era, even if modest by today’s standards.His biggest single-season paycheck came in 2000, when he earned about $5 million with the Ravens. By the time he retired in 2003, Sharpe had already positioned himself for a career in broadcasting.That is where his net worth truly accelerated.After working with CBS Sports and later co-hosting Skip and Shannon: Undisputed on Fox Sports, Sharpe became one of the most recognizable analysts in American television. In 2023, he joined ESPN’s First Take, signing a lucrative multi-year deal. While exact numbers were not made public, top ESPN personalities are believed to earn well into eight figures annually.The biggest driver of Sharpe’s wealth in recent years has been his podcast empire. His show Club Shay Shay exploded in popularity, especially after viral interviews like the famous Katt Williams episode in early 2024, which crossed 80 million views on YouTube. Sharpe later revealed that he made more money from that single episode than he ever made in any one NFL season.By 2025, Sharpe’s media network Shay Shay Media included multiple podcasts and partnerships, generating millions each year through YouTube ads, sponsorships, and licensing deals. Industry estimates suggest he was earning anywhere between $10 million to $15 million per year from media alone by 2025.He also added income through endorsements with brands like Nike, Reebok, Pepsi and Coors Light. In 2021, he launched his own premium cognac brand, Le Portier, which became a steady business venture tied closely to his personal brand.On the real estate side, he owns multiple high-value properties in Georgia and Los Angeles, including a custom-built 11,000-square-foot mansion.His wealth is still growing at 57, and his biggest financial years may still be ahead of him.","Shannon Sharpe's net worth is estimated to be around $30 million in 2025.

Cleveland Cavaliers vs Orlando Magic Key Matchups (January 24, 2026)

Thevisit theon January 24, 2026, at the Kia Center in a matchup that matters for Eastern Conference standings. Cleveland comes in at 26-20, while Orlando is 23-20, with both teams trying to stay in the playoff mix.Injuries are shaping this game on both sides. Rotations are thinner than usual, and several key players are unavailable. That puts more pressure on the starters and shifts the focus toward interior scoring, rebounding, and half-court execution.Cleveland is on the second night of a back-to-back and will be without several perimeter players. Darius Garland is out with a right great toe strain. Sam Merrill is sidelined with a right hand sprain. Max Strus continues to recover from left foot surgery (Jones fracture). Chris Livingston and Luke Travers are unavailable due to G-League two-way assignments.Orlando could get Jalen Suggs back, with his status listed as probable after missing three weeks with a right knee MCL contusion. Franz Wagner remains out with left ankle soreness. Colin Castleton is unavailable on a G-League assignment. With these absences, both teams are expected to lean heavily on their frontcourt players.Both teams are likely to play through the paint more than usual given the depleted backcourts.Cleveland leads the all-time regular-season series 67-62 across 129 games, though Orlando has traditionally performed well at home against them. This season, the Cavaliers hold a 2-1 edge, outscoring the Magic by an average margin of 10 points per game. Cleveland has averaged 120.0 points in those matchups, while Orlando has scored 110.0. Rebounding has been a key factor so far. The teams will meet again on January 26, March 11, and March 24.Cleveland holds a slight edge on offense, while Orlando has been more consistent defensively, even with recent lineup changes.Donovan Mitchell remains the engine of Cleveland’s offense, averaging a career-high 28.9 points per game and posting a strong on-court net rating. His matchup with Jalen Suggs, if Suggs plays, will be central, especially given Suggs’ impact on defense.In the frontcourt, Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen carry much of Cleveland’s interior workload, while Paolo Banchero and Wendell Carter Jr. anchor Orlando’s attack. Orlando averages 54.0 points in the paint per game, which could test Cleveland’s interior defense. Mobley is coming off a strong performance with 29 points and 13 rebounds.Orlando has played well at home, while Cleveland enters on a two-game win streak. With both teams short-handed, this game is likely to come down to execution, rebounding, and who controls the paint late.","The Cleveland Cavaliers host the Orlando Magic on January 24, 2026.

“The writing just dries up”: Travis Kelce romance fuels debate as Taylor Swift fears her lyrical storytelling is fading,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/the-writing-just-dries-up-travis-kelce-romance-fuels-debate-as-taylor-swift-fears-her-lyrical-storytelling-is-fading/articleshow/127390142.cms,"Taylor Swift recently admitted she once feared happiness could weaken her songwriting as her romance with Travis Kelce deepened. She worried that joy might replace the emotional tension that fueled her lyrics. However, her latest album proved otherwise, showing she can create vibrant, story-driven music even during one of the happiest chapters of her life.

Travis Kelce relationship changed how Taylor Swift views pain, joy, and creativity

The End of an Era: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce Love Story Secrets REVEALED!

Being an artist of emotional honesty, Taylor Swift has developed her career on the belief that doubt was lingering silently in the creative process unimpeded by the polished albums and sold-out tours. She struggled with having a troubling question that most artists dread but hardly confess to as her personal life became more placid and satisfied. But when pain is no longer the guide of creativity what becomes of it?This question became even more burning with the further development of her relations with Travis Kelce . The happiness that she felt offstage thus heightened some anxiety as to the implications of its effect on her songwriting. To an artist so much praised to transform heartache into brilliance, happiness was strange grounds even dangerous.Taylor Swift openly addressed that concern while reflecting on her mindset before completing ""The Life of a Showgirl"". Speaking candidly, she admitted, “I used to have this dark fear that if I ever were truly happy and free, being myself and nurtured by a relationship, what happens if the writing just dries up?” She continued, “What if writing is directly tied to my torment and pain?”Those doubts did not survive the creative process. The album emerged during a whirlwind chapter that included her Eras Tour and a stable personal life. Instead of dulling her edge, that happiness sharpened it.“It turns out, that’s not the case at all, and we just were catching lightning in a bottle with this record,” she wrote. “But it’s nice because you’re coming from a place of happiness and love, you can go back to those places. You can look forward to other things.”On Travis Kelce’s podcast, she described the emotional fuel behind the project. “This album is about what was going on behind the scenes in my inner life during this tour, which was so exuberant and electric and vibrant,” she said. “It just comes from, like, the most infectiously joyful, wild, dramatic place I was in in my life.”Kelce noticed the shift immediately. “I’ve been fortunate enough to hear every single song on here, so I know they’re all 12 bangers,” he said, adding, “It’s a lot more upbeat … like fun, pop excitement.… It’s a complete 180 from a lot of the songs on Tortured Poets.”Swift’s story challenges a tired myth. Creativity does not require suffering. Sometimes, it grows louder when life finally feels steady.","Travis Kelce relationship changed how Taylor Swift views pain, joy, and creativity.

Reggie Miller says Stephen Curry should make the call to Giannis as Father Time is knocking,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/reggie-miller-says-stephen-curry-should-make-the-call-to-giannis-as-father-time-is-knocking/articleshow/127283445.cms,"Giannis Antetokounmpo, Stephen Curry and Reggie Miller (Images via Getty)

The Warriors’ franchise in desperation after Jimmy Butler’s ACL

The Milwaukee Bucks ’ meltdown

Reggie Miller just tossed a grenade into the NBA rumor mill, and it’s landing right in the middle of Chase Center. Speaking on The Dan Patrick Show, the Hall of Famer didn’t mince words: he believes it is time for Stephen Curry to pick up the phone and recruit Giannis Antetokounmpo to the Golden State Warriors. With the Bucks currently languishing in 11th place in the East and the Warriors reeling from Jimmy Butler’s season-ending ACL injury, Miller argues that the Greek Freak might be the only answer to save Steph’s remaining prime.The logic is simple but devastating, as Miller suggests Curry needs to remind Giannis that while his Milwaukee legacy is secure, Father Time is officially knocking on the door in San Francisco. A Curry-Giannis pairing wouldn't just be a trade, it would be a shift in the league's tectonic plates, combining the greatest gravity in perimeter history with the most dominant interior force of this generation.When asked about the trade window closing, Miller said, “Halfway closed and especially now with the injury to Butler, almost closed unless something drastically happens.”The Warriors find themselves at a brutal crossroads. Before Butler went down, the vision was clear: a gritty, veteran-heavy squad capable of one last deep run. Now, sitting near the play-in line, the Dubs are a team with a superstar and a vacuum of secondary scoring. Mike Dunleavy Jr. has the assets, Jonathan Kuminga, Moses Moody, and a chest of future first-round picks, but the front office has been hesitant to empty the clip“If I'm Stephen Curry, maybe I open up my Rolodex. Wow. And maybe it's time that I call someone in the Midwest by the name of Giannis Antetokounmpo, and say, look, what you've done in Milwaukee has been fabulous.It's been great. You brought them a championship, their first in 50 years, but the time is now. You're You're getting older. I'm certainly knocking on Father Time's door,"" said Miller on the Warriors' need for another talent like Giannis, along with Curry and Green to make them an indispensable force for the championship run.For Giannis Antetokounmpo, the grass in the Bay might actually be greener, as despite his public loyalty, the Bucks are currently an 18-26 mess, struggling to find a rhythm under Doc Rivers. The 100-102 loss against Nuggets brought much bigger chaos for Bucks as Giannis left the match after a no-contact injury.Insiders suggest that while Milwaukee isn't answering the phone yet, the league feels an impending breakup between the two. If the Warriors can pull off the impossible, they wouldn't just be replacing Butler’s production, they’d be creating a nightmare for the rest of the league. A Giannis rim run with Steph and Buddy Hield spacing the floor is quite literally unguardable.",Reggie Miller believes it is time for Stephen Curry to pick up the phone and recruit Giannis Antetokounmpo to the Golden State Warriors.

NEW DELHI: A pair of abandoned slippers and a gap in a broken stone wall leading into a forested ridge helped police crack the case of a 10-year-old girl’s sexual assault in central Delhi’s Prasad Nagar. The child was allegedly abducted, raped and left unconscious in the secluded area by an e-rickshaw driver.In the absence of a name or registration number, investigators said they relied entirely on the visual identification of a red e-ricks-haw with a white roof. TOI had earlier reported the incident, which took place on Jan 11, and the arrest made on Jan 14. Fresh details have since emerged about the investigation that led police to the suspect. The survivor has since been discharged following medical treatment and counselling.The investigation began on Jan 11, when the girl — who supports her family by selling flowers at traffic signals — was brought to a hospital with injuries. She told police she was lured by an e-rickshaw driver on the pretext of being offered tea and taken to a forest patch. Despite being disoriented, she recalled fragments of her surroundings—a “blue-painted room” and a “broken entry point”—providing police with their first lead.DCP (Central) Anant Mittal formed three teams to crack the case. They scanned a 20-sq-km radius, manually inspecting 22 locations with similar features and analysing CCTV footage.The breakthrough came when police examined CCTV footage from Professor Ram Nath Vij Marg, which matched the details shared by the girl. On a deserted stretch of the ridge, officers found a broken stone wall leading to a small structure. The recovery of the girl’s slippers confirmed the crime scene, allowing forensic teams to reconstruct the route taken by the accused between 11 pm and 1 am.“Alongside the ground search, a second team scanned footage from over 100 CCTV cameras. A key lead emerged when a camera recorded a red e-rickshaw with a white roof carrying the minor. Based on this visual, a third team searched e-rickshaw stands in Karol Bagh and Rajendra Place,” a senior officer said.Photographs of suspected drivers were circulated among investigators until the vehicle was traced near a petrol pump in Rajendra Place. Police later spotted a man matching the victim’s description approaching the vehicle. He attempted to flee on noticing the police presence but was chased down and apprehended.The suspect, identified as Durgesh, 25, from Farrukhabad in Uttar Pradesh, later led police to the recovery of blood-stained clothes.","A pair of abandoned slippers and a gap in a broken stone wall helped police crack the case of a 10-year-old girl’s sexual assault in central Delhi.

Meaning of the quote of the day Microsoft co-founder by Bill Gates



Staying humble in a world of constant wins



Why failure is actually the better instructor



Bill Gates and the danger of overconfidence in 2026



Final thoughts on the Gates philosophy







Success is a concept we are all taught to chase from the moment we can understand the word. We see it in the headlines, on our social feeds, and in the lives of the people we admire. But Bill Gates, a man who has lived at the absolute peak of global influence and wealth for decades, has a different take on it. He famously said, ""Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose."" It’s a bit of a reality check, isn't it? Coming from someone who co-founded Microsoft and spent years as the richest person on the planet, you’d expect him to be success’s biggest cheerleader. Instead, he’s warning us that the very thing we want can actually be the thing that trips us up. He’s talking about that dangerous mix of ego and comfort that creeps in when things are going well.When Gates says success is a lousy teacher, he’s cutting through the fluff of typical motivational speeches. The core meaning here is about the psychological trap of ""winning."" When you fail, you’re forced to look in the mirror. You have to take apart your process, find the cracks, and figure out exactly where you messed up. That’s where the real learning happens. But when you succeed? You usually just pat yourself on the back.You assume that because you won, every decision you made along the way was the right one. This creates a blind spot.The second part of the quote—the idea that success ""seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose""—is even more pointed. Smart people are often the most vulnerable to this. If you’ve spent your life being right, it’s easy to start believing that you are inherently better or smarter than the market or the competition. Success makes you feel invincible. It lulls you into a state of complacency where you stop looking for risks because you don't believe they apply to you anymore. For Gates, this wasn't just a theory; it was a lesson he lived through at Microsoft during the rise of the internet and later the mobile era, where past dominance sometimes made it harder to see the next big shift coming.It’s hard to stay grounded when everyone is telling you how great you are. In today’s culture, we celebrate the ""win"" so loudly that we forget to check if the win was actually repeatable or just a stroke of luck. Bill Gates’ current work in 2026 shows he’s still trying to apply this logic. Despite his massive net worth—which still sits comfortably over $100 billion—he’s moved far beyond the world of software. He’s currently knee-deep in high-risk, high-reward projects like the ""Horizon 1000"" initiative.Just this month, in January 2026, the Gates Foundation partnered with OpenAI, committing $50 million to bring AI-driven healthcare to 1,000 clinics across Africa, starting in Rwanda. This isn't the move of someone who thinks they've already ""won"" everything. It's the move of someone who knows that the challenges of global health and climate change are much harder than building an operating system. He’s putting his resources into areas where failure is a very real possibility, which keeps that ""lousy teacher"" of success at a distance.If success is a bad teacher, then failure is the strict professor you hated in college but realised later taught you everything you know. Failure doesn't let you off the hook. It demands an explanation. When a project falls apart or a business goes under, the pain of that loss acts as a powerful motivator to never let it happen again. You become more observant. You look at the data more closely.I remember a time when I put everything into a project that I was certain would be a ""slam dunk."" I didn't even have a backup plan because I was so convinced of my own brilliance. When it inevitably tanked, I was crushed. But looking back, that failure taught me more about risk management and humility than any of my previous successes ever did. It stripped away the ego and made me a better strategist. I think that's what Gates is getting at. You have to be willing to be wrong to eventually be right in a way that actually lasts.Even now, as we navigate 2026, the tech landscape is shifting faster than ever. With AI moving from a buzzword to a fundamental part of our infrastructure, the risk of overconfidence is huge. Companies that were the kings of the hill five years ago are finding themselves scrambling. Gates has always been a student of history, and he knows that the graveyard of business is filled with ""smart people"" who thought they couldn't lose.Look at his recent investments in nuclear energy through TerraPower. On January 21, 2026, it was reported that South Korean energy giants are taking major stakes in his Natrium nuclear plant project in Wyoming. This is a sector where success is incredibly difficult to achieve and the regulatory hurdles are massive. Gates isn't playing it safe. He’s deliberately stepping into arenas where he has to prove himself all over again. He's avoiding the ""seduction"" of his past achievements by constantly starting new, difficult chapters.At the end of the day, Bill Gates isn't saying we shouldn't strive for success. He’s just saying we shouldn't trust it. Success is a temporary state, not a permanent trait. If you want to keep growing, you have to treat your wins with a bit of suspicion. Ask yourself: ""Did I win because I’m a genius, or did I just get lucky?"" Most of the time, it's a bit of both. By staying curious and keeping a bit of that ""loser’s hunger,"" you can avoid the trap of thinking you’re untouchable. It’s a tough way to live—always looking for the hole in your own boat—but it’s the only way to keep from sinking.","Bill Gates famously said, ""Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose"" The core meaning here is about the psychological trap of ""winning"" When you fail, you’re forced to look in the mirror and figure out exactly where you messed up.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127271649,imgsize-32814,width-400,resizemode-4/bill-gates-image-source-reuters.jpg"

Lara Trump shares viral golfing photos with Donald Trump and granddaughter

Bill Maher Clashes With Lara Trump After She Downplays Trump’s ‘Piggy’ Insult On Air Force One

Social media responds with warmth and nostalgia

How a shared family moment cut through public tension





Lara Trump has recently bestowed upon social media participants a rare treat with a glimpse into the less familiar, more personal side of the Trump family. Through the sharing of just a few images on X, she has reached the hearts of many with this intimate family picture involving her young daughter's fun-filled golf game with her grandfather, US President Donald Trump himself, with whom she gets to spend quality time while playing their favourite game, golf. This is one instance where the family, known for its political fervour, has been accepted with such fervour not for their political ideology but for this common family experience that speaks volumes about their humanity despite their fame and power, resonating widely with audiences who cherish authentic, tender moments beyond politics.The photographs depicted Donald Trump behind the wheel of a golf cart, with his granddaughter sitting alongside him, looking happy and carefree. Moreover, there were no signs of poses or dramatic settings, only a serene capture of moments spent with each other. The informal nature of this post was a major factor that led to its success. The post was not meant for any particular message or statement, but only for a casual share by Lara Trump. The post succeeded in gathering tens of thousands of views, not because it was political or held any significance, but because it was something that was widely understood.The online response was largely positive, with many people describing the photographs as “wholesome” and “heartwarming”. Several users reflected on the special bond between grandparents and grandchildren, sharing how the images stirred personal memories and emotions. One user wrote, “What a great moment for her! My kids miss their Gramps,” while another commented, “Core memory unlocked!”, capturing the sense of nostalgia the post evoked. Others reacted more light-heartedly, with remarks such as, “Awww, I was wondering what Grandpa Trump was up to today!” and “Cutest thing I have seen all day.”Part of the post’s impact lay in its timing and tone. At a moment when public discourse is often polarised, the photographs presented a version of public life stripped of commentary and conflict. They highlighted how figures who dominate global headlines also occupy familiar family roles, such as grandparents enjoying simple moments with their loved ones.","Lara Trump has shared intimate family photos on social media.

MUMBAI: Cameras equipped with facial recognition tech have helped Government Railway Police track down the suspected killer of a city college teacher in around 12 hours after the murder. The victim, Alok Kumar Singh (33), was stabbed to death after a fight on a local train at Malad station on Saturday evening.The 27-year-old suspect, Omkar Shinde, told police that he lost his cool after a tiff with Singh over alighting at the station. Shinde, who is into imitation jewellery and metal polishing, is believed to have used a small pair of tongs to stab Singh. He threw away the weapon while fleeing. Police are looking for it.Singh and his colleague S K Trivedi were heading home in a Borivli-bound slow local when the former was stabbed at the door of the coach. ""We may have scanned footage from close to 200 cameras in the span of a night,"" a Borivli GRP officer said. The GRP worked with Railway Protection Force and city police to track down the suspect.Explaining the sequence of events after the stabbing of the junior college teacher, police said Shinde ran on platform no.1 and climbed a foot overbridge. Cameras captured him exiting the railway premises towards Malad (E) a minute later.""We wanted to check if the suspect was a frequent railway commuter and started looking through surveillance footage from five days before the incident,"" a GRP officer said. Around 5-6 teams were formed. Logs were maintained for dates and timings that Shinde was captured on cameras, equipped with facial recognition tech, entering or exiting railway premises.""Shinde would typically board the 7.18am Up local from Malad and after work, he took board the 4.16pm local from Charni Road to head home,"" said another officer. Surveillance footage from outside Malad railway station showed that Shinde preferred walking home in the evening. But in the morning, he would take an auto to reach the station.After studying these patterns, investigators set up a trap at the auto stand outside Malad station around 7am on Sunday. ""We were not too sure if he would go to work as it was a Sunday. But we saw him getting off an auto,"" said an officer. The team pounced on Shinde and brought him to the Borivli GRP chowky. He initially claimed he wasn't aware of Singh's death. Shinde resides at Kurar village in Malad with his parents and a brother. He works at his father's metal polishing unit in Khetwadi, besides doing some imitation jewellery work on his own. Police said his father is a heart patient and has stopped working.On Sunday, Shinde was produced before a holiday court at Borivli which sent him to police custody till Jan 29. Police said he does not have a prior criminal record.","Alok Kumar Singh (33) was stabbed to death after a fight on a local train at Malad station on Saturday evening.

NEW DELHI: The 'He-Man' of Indian cinema, Dharmendra, and CPM stalwart V S Achuthanandhan were on Sunday named, both posthumously, as recipients of Padma Vibhushan, with the govt bestowing the Padma awards on 131 people - some celebrated like cricketers Rohit Sharma and Harmanpreet Kaur and actor Mammootty while several others were recognised for their impactful service away from the public glare.Former SC judge K T Thomas, journalist and author P Narayanan, who has been associated with RSS, are two other recipients of the second-highest civilian honour from Kerala, while violin maestro N Rajam from UP is another awardee in this category this year. The govt named 13 people for Padma Bhushan, including singer Alka Yagnik, celebrated late adman Piyush Pandey, industrialist Uday Kotak and the late former Jharkhand CM Shibu Soren. Like last year, no one was named for Bharat Ratna, the highest award. Congratulating the winners, PM Modi said, ""Their excellence, dedication and service across diverse fields enrich the fabric of our society. The honour reflects the spirit of commitment and excellence that continues to inspire generations.In keeping with its practice of taking the Padma awards' focus away from big cities and well-known names and to recognise hinterland talents in a wide spectrum of fields, the Modi govt picked this year's awardees from 84 districts spread across 30 states and UTs.Ten districts figure on the list for the first time since Independence, officials noted.Among such ""unsung heroes"", as officials described them, are Taga Ram Bheel, recognised for reviving Rajasthan's fading folk instrument Algoza, and Meghalaya-based environmentalist Hally War.Former Indian tennis star Vijay Amritraj, based in the US, is among the six Padma Bhushan awardees under foreigners/NRI/PIO/OCI.A maximum 15 winners are officially from Maharashtra, including the likes of actors Dharmendra and R Madhavan - one of the key characters in 'Dhurandhar', said to have been inspired by NSA Ajit Doval - who found their calling in the state, followed by 13 from Tamil Nadu and 11 each from West Bengal and UP. Eight each are from Karnataka and Kerala, including Vellappally Natesan, a functionary of SNDP - an outfit that has positioned itself as the vehicle of Izhavas, the single most numerically preponderant caste in Kerala - and a BJP ally in Tamil Nadu.Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Kerala are heading to assembly polls, though official sources were quick to point out that govt has annually tried to give a diverse representation regionally, selecting the awardees from 84 districts across the country.Former IPS officer K Vijay Kumar, associated with the killing of notorious sandalwood smuggler Veerappan, Armind Fernandez, who established Asia's first human milk bank, and ex-Prasar Bharati CEO Shashi Shekhar Vempati, hockey player Savita Punia are among the other Padma winners besides politicians Bhagat Singh Kosher and late V K Malhotra, both from BJP.Achuthanandhan, a vocal and popular former Kerala CM, and Soren join other veteran politicians from non-BJP backgrounds like Mulayam Singh Yadav and Ram Vilas Paswan who got Padma recognition from this govt.Padma Shri awardees include former MHA functionary R V Mani, who had protested against a change of affidavit in the Ishrat Jehan encounter case. In his book, 'Hindu Terror: Insider account of Ministry of Home Affairs 2006-2010', Mani alleged he was pressured by the UPA govt to sign a second affidavit that fabricated a narrative of ""Saffron Terror"".Officials said govt made extensive efforts to identify achievers from all corners, highlighting that over 39,000 nominations were received and evaluated through an exhaustive and rigorous process of multiple rounds of scrutiny and consultation with ministry, state administration and domain experts. Awardees included 48 super senior citizens (80 years and above) and many from traditionally deprived sections of society.","Dharmendra and V S Achuthanandhan named posthumously as recipients of Padma Vibhushan.

Shivam Dube press conference: On Ishan and Surya’s knock & his role with the ball

Poll Who was the standout player in India's latest T20 match against New Zealand? Abhishek Sharma Suryakumar Yadav Jasprit Bumrah Ravi Bishnoi

GUWAHATI: Following two high-scoring games in Nagpur and Raipur going India’s way, the full-house Guwahati crowd must have expected the script to unfold in a similar way here too. But the Indian batting was powered by Abhishek Sharma , and the bowlers had different plans.After the bowlers put in a superb effort to restrict New Zealand to a below-par score of 153 for nine, Sharma (68 not out of 20 balls) and skipper Suryakumar Yadav (57 not out of 26 balls) made sure the hosts reduced the T20 International to a T10 game, chasing the target in just 10 overs losing only two wickets.India also sealed the five-match series in the process, taking an unassailable 3-0 lead here at Barsapara Cricket Stadium on Sunday.Sharma went into record books, scoring the second-fastest T20I fifty by an Indian, behind only his mentor Yuvraj Singh , who had completed the feat in 12 balls. Sharma’s golden duck in the second match in Raipur looked like a dot between two blitzkriegs of innings as he followed up the first game’s 35-ball 84 in Nagpur, with an unbeaten 68 with seven fours and five maximums.As the chase began with Sanju Samson putting more pressure on himself with a golden duck in the very first ball of the chase, man in form Ishan Kishan joined Sharma and the duo hit the stride in tandem to put on 53 runs in just 3.1 overs before the Jharkhand lad picked up the deep midwicket fielder trying to clear a low Ish Sodhi delivery.However, Kishan’s departure didn’t slow down India’s scoring rate. In fact, the skipper, back among the runs, now in the middle made life all the more difficult for the Kiwi bowlers. As India’s 360-degree man started where he left off in the last game to score another unbeaten half century with six fours and three sixes, India made short work of the easy chase.Earlier, a superbly executed bowling plan combined with sharp fielding helped India restrict the Kiwis to a below-par total on a pitch which looked a nice one to bat on. India ensured that the visitors never got out of the pressure and saw them lose wickets at regular intervals barring a 52-run fourth-wicket stand between Glenn Phillips and Mark Chapman.Jasprit Bumrah returned after a one-match break to take three for 17 while wristspinner Ravi Bishnoi, a surprise inclusion in place of mystery spinner Varun Chakravarthy, made an instant impact with two for 18 from his four overs.Bishnoi was making a comeback to the Indian side after almost a year after his last match against England in Feb 2025. Not in very impressive form in domestic cricket this season, Bishnoi bowled a touch quick with great accuracy in pitching to strike at crucial moments on his international return. Hardik Pandya was excellent, bowling three overs for 23 runs and taking two wickets.","Abhishek Sharma and Suryakumar Yadav make sure hosts reduce the T20 International to a T10 game.

Anthony Edwards sends support to Minnesota community



Anthony Edwards' performance against the Warriors on Sunday



Anthony Edwards is optimistic about the upcoming game against the Warriors



At Target Center on Sunday, the Minnesota Timberwolves took the floor against the Golden State Warriors with the city still reeling from the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti, an ICU nurse killed a day earlier. The game, postponed from Saturday, became part competition and part communal pause.Amid that setting, Anthony Edwards emerged as both a leader on the court and a voice for the people he represents. After Minnesota’s 111-85 loss, the Wolves star addressed the pain surrounding the team and the city.Anthony Edwards was asked directly if he had a message for those affected across Minnesota. His response was candid as he revealed that he is praying for everybody.""I just love Minnesota, all the love and support that they show me. So I'm behind whatever they with. I don't really have social media, so I'm not in tune with everything. But I've heard about the stuff that's going on. Me and my family definitely praying for everybody.""Before tipoff, the Timberwolves held a moment of silence for Pretti, following a similar tribute earlier this month for Renée Good. The NBA Players Association released a statement addressing both deaths, while voices across basketball joined the conversation.Wolves coach Chris Finch, Warriors coach Steve Kerr, Stephen Curry, Karl-Anthony Towns, and Breanna Stewart all acknowledged the impact of the tragedy.Edwards delivered one of his strongest outings of the season. He finished with 32 points on 13-20 shooting, added 11 rebounds, two assists, and one block across 34 minutes. It marked his third 30-point game in four contests and his second double-double of the year.The performance extended an impressive scoring run. Edwards has now scored at least 20 points in 18 straight games dating back to December 8. During that stretch, he is averaging 31.4 points, 5.7 rebounds, 3.6 three-pointers, 3.4 assists, 1.3 steals, and 0.8 blocks, anchoring Minnesota’s offense through a demanding stretch of the schedule.Despite the lopsided result, Edwards did not deflect responsibility. He pointed to effort and fatigue without leaning on excuses.“We’re supposed to come out here and play hard,” Edwards said post game. “I don’t think we can make an excuse because we’re tired. Everybody tired, everybody ready to go to the break.”“We’re just getting outplayed on the effort part. So we gotta bring it on that side, for sure,” he added.Right now, Ant-Man is looking to get the team back on its A-game.","The Minnesota Timberwolves lost 111-85 to the Golden State Warriors on Sunday.

'BCB will consider if ...

Bangladesh cricket in turmoil: What it means for the T20 World Cup?

Bangladesh cricket officials have said former captain Shakib Al Hasan could be considered for a return to the national team, reopening the possibility less than a year after his retirement from international cricket.Shakib, who was also a lawmaker from the former ruling party that was removed in a 2024 uprising, had become a focus of public anger because of his association with ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina. He was among several people named in murder cases linked to a police crackdown on protesters. In 2024, Shakib announced his retirement but said last month that he was open to reversing that decision.Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) senior official Amzad Hossain said the board had taken a collective view on the matter.“The board has taken a unanimous decision that if Shakib Al Hasan's availability, fitness and accessibility allow it -- and if he can be present at the venue where matches are played -- then the board and the selection panel will consider him for the national team,” Hossain told reporters late Saturday.He said the BCB would also allow Shakib to play in overseas leagues if he wished.“If he wants to participate in other global tournaments, the board will provide him NOC as required,” Amzad added.Shakib had earlier apologised for staying silent during the student-led uprising, while also defending his decision to be part of the government that was later removed.The development comes at a time when Bangladesh cricket is dealing with the fallout of being excluded from next month’s T20 World Cup. On Saturday, the International Cricket Council (ICC) replaced Bangladesh with Scotland.The BCB had declined to send the team to India and asked for their matches to be moved to co-host Sri Lanka. The issue escalated earlier this month after the Indian cricket board asked IPL franchise Kolkata Knight Riders to release Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman.The ICC said there was no credible security threat to Bangladesh in India, but the BCB said the final call rested with the government.“This is a government decision taken on security grounds,” Amzad said. “Because of that, there was nothing more we could do.”Shakib was playing in a domestic T20 tournament in Canada when Hasina’s government fell and has not returned to Bangladesh since. He has represented Bangladesh in 71 Tests, 247 one-day internationals and 129 T20 internationals, taking a total of 712 wickets across formats.",Bangladesh cricket officials say former captain Shakib Al Hasan could be considered for a return to the national team. The development comes less than a year after his retirement from international cricket.

Poeltl appeared to be in line for a comeback during the team's five-game road trip, which ends today in Oklahoma City.The Toronto Raptors have provided an injury update on Jakob Poeltl, who has been sidelined for more than a month due to a back problem. Poeltl was back in Toronto for pain relief treatment.

A return timeline has not yet been established, and his status will be updated when he returns to practice…”However, the problem started much earlier. According to Michael Grange, the center has been dealing with a back issue that started back in training camp.This makes sense because even before the most recent game in Brooklyn, Poeltl was still missing time occasionally and was typically rested on one leg of back-to-backs.Meanwhile, the announcement further said:“Poeltl is averaging 9.7 points, 7.7 rebounds, 2.1 assists and 25.3 minutes in 21 games (all starts) this season. He last played Dec. 21 at Brooklyn before exiting the game midway through the first quarter…”On Sunday night, Toronto will travel to Oklahoma City to play the NBA's top team, the Thunder.The big man has had difficulty maintaining his health, and his absence creates a significant void in Toronto's frontcourt lineup. According to the Raptors, Poeltl has returned to Toronto and undergone specialized pain management. We'll update his status once he resumes practicing.The team and Yak have no choice but to return to Toronto in an attempt to resolve this problem after this setback. The Raptors, who have a 28–19 record and are in fourth place in the Eastern Conference, are still competitive despite Poeltl's injury.Due to a tiebreaker, the Raptors, who have won three straight games, are now fourth in the Eastern Conference at 28-19, behind New York. Toronto is six games behind Detroit and one game behind Boston, which is in second place. In 21 games this season, Poeltl has averaged 9.7 points and 7.7 rebounds.","Toronto Raptors still in the dark as Jakob Poeltl’s back issue shows no clear return timeline despite strong playoff push.

A cultural moment disrupted during IShowSpeed’s Africa tour

“Speed Does Africa”

“Africa is not doing itself any favors. Speed is highly popular and seeing him hurt will only show that Africa is not a place to visit.”

“Why did the bodyguards wait, till Speed was attacked?”





Popular streamer IShowSpeed had a terrifying moment during his Africa tour when he was attacked on camera in Ivory Coast. It happened while Speed was live and trying to do a local dance as part of his effort to immerse himself in the country's culture. What started off very lighthearted and positive quickly got tense as viewers were shocked when chaos briefly unfolded on stream.Videos of the stream captured a man, out of nowhere, coming up to Speed and becoming violent, which then required his bodyguards' involvement. Speed looked confused by what was happening and yelled in disbelief as security quickly escorted the man away. Fortunately, nobody suffered any serious injuries, and the stream went on a little after the situation was under control.The attack occurred during Speed’s stop in Ivory Coast as part of his ongoingtour. The streamer has been visiting multiple countries across the continent, aiming to explore local traditions, meet fans, and take part in cultural activities. In Ivory Coast, this included attempting the popular Zaouli dance in Abidjan’s Yopougon area and sampling traditional foods such as garba and foutou.However, the unexpected altercation shifted the tone of what was meant to be a celebratory moment. Fans watching the stream quickly took to social media to share their reactions. Some expressed concern about safety, with one fan writing,Others questioned the response time of security, asking,Despite the criticism, many viewers also pointed out that large crowds and high-profile appearances can be unpredictable, especially during live events. This was not the first tense moment on Speed’s Africa tour, as previous stops have also seen crowd control challenges due to his massive popularity and the number of fans eager to see him in person.The incident in the Ivory Coast underlines the dangers that are involved with live streaming in public spaces, especially when one is a globally recognized creator. While Speed's intention has been to celebrate African culture and connect with local communities, moments like this underline the need for strong security and careful planning.In the end, IShowSpeed was left unharmed, and the tour continued with no major setbacks; the on-camera attack has raised wider discussions about creator safety, crowd control, and how viral moments can turn serious in a split second when the cameras are rolling.","Streamer IShowSpeed had a terrifying moment during his Africa tour when he was attacked on camera in Ivory Coast.

Anrich Nortje on T20 World Cup momentum, SA20 conditions & team depth

Poll How confident are you about Tilak Varma being fit for the second match of the World Cup? Very confident Somewhat confident Not confident at all

NEW DELHI: With no warm-up matches lined up before the T20 World Cup gets underway on Feb 7, the Indian team is planning to arrange a match on Feb 4 to check its resources one final time given the injury concerns in the team. TOI has learnt that the selectors and the Indian board ( BCCI ) are looking at possible backup options with Washington Sundar and Tilak Varma still recovering from their respective injuries. Sources said that the BCCI is planning to play South Africa or bringing in India ‘A’ players for an intra-squad game.The Indian team will assemble in Mumbai on Feb 2. The warmup match is likely to happen at the Brabourne Stadium if the plan materialises. TOI understands that the Centre of Excellence (CoE) in Bengaluru has been conveyed to prepare Riyan Parag, who is recovering from a shoulder injury, for the warmup match if the need arises.“Washington’s recovery from the side strain is taking longer than expected. The selectors are preparing for a situation where he is unable to be fit in the initial matches of the World Cup. Tilak’s recovery has been good. His return to play is being chalked out at the moment.The team management is confident he will be in prime shape by the second match on Feb 12. The selectors want the team to settle down by the match against Pakistan in Colombo on Feb 15,” a BCCI source said.The selectors named Ravi Bishnoi as Washington’s replacement for the ongoing T20I series against New Zealand while Shreyas Iyer was brought back in place of Tilak for the first three T20Is. Bishnoi got a game in the third T20I in Guwahati on Sunday evening with Iyer on the bench in all three matches. BCCI didn’t announce if Tilak would be available for the last two T20Is in Visakhapatnam and Thiruvananthapuram.Changes to the team can be made till Jan 30 but tournament’s technical committee can always allow replacements in case of injuries even during the tournament.It has been learnt that Parag is slated to play two simulation matches on Jan 28 and Jan 30 before he is cleared by the CoE on Jan 31. He has been told to be ready to report to Mumbai on Feb 2.According to sources, the selectors are more concerned about Washington’s availability. It is understood that Washington has suffered an injury to a muscle that runs from ribs to the lower back. Rushing him back could even jeopardise his availability for the IPL. Parag is a like-for-like replacement option for the selectors. But they will look at other options if the warmup match happens.","The Indian team is planning to arrange a match on Feb 4 to check its resources one final time given the injury concerns in the team.

I can’t go through this anymore. I have to put a stop to it.’ But when I said I was going to put a stop to it — because you can say you’re going to put a stop to it, and you could go a month without being around somebody.”The “Am I the Drama?” artist added, “It’s not when you say so. It’s when your heart says so. I kept telling myself, ‘I would not contact this person for a month. I would not give in. I would not forgive this easily. I would not go back. I would not go to the pattern. I would not go through it.”Cardi B added, “But I was crying every day. I was hurt every day. I was thinking about it every single day.

Steve Kerr reveals somber atmosphere in Minnesota after shooting incident



Golden State Warriors secures win against the Timberwolves



Protests inside the arena after the Minnesota shooting



It was not the best of times as basketball felt secondary inside Target Center on Sunday night. A city in mourning gathered for a game that had already been postponed once, and the weight of recent events never lifted. The Golden State Warriors defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 111-85, yet the victory was gloomy as the shared sense of loss following the fatal shooting of ICU nurse Alex Pretti was visible everywhere.From the opening moments, the arena carried a heaviness. Players, coaches, and fans were affected, as it could be seen in their faces. After the final buzzer, Warriors head coach Steve Kerr candidly shared details of the atmosphere in the arena.Kerr spoke candidly about what he observed from the sideline after the Warriors win over the Timberwolves.“Honestly, what I felt was that their group was suffering,” Kerr said about the Timberwolves team and fans.“I thought the vibe in the stands, it was one of the most bizarre, sad games I've ever been a part of. You can feel the somber atmosphere. Their team, we could tell, was struggling with everything that's been going on, with what the city has been through.It was very sad. It was a sad night. Obviously, we got the win, and we're happy about that, but very difficult to see so many people struggling.”Before tipoff, the Timberwolves held a moment of silence for Pretti, mirroring a similar tribute earlier this month for Renée Good. Head coach Chris Finch, usually reserved, showed visible emotion when addressing the community.“I’m more than a resident. This is my home. I love living here,” Finch said. “It’s sad to watch what is happening.”On the court, Golden State eventually pulled away, outscoring Minnesota 38-17 in the third quarter. Stephen Curry led with 26 points, while Anthony Edwards scored 32 for the Timberwolves. Still, the game didn’t feel like a normal basketball event.“You definitely felt the weight of the city,” Warriors guard Moses Moody said. “Couldn’t imagine too many times where that group, that large of amount of people, are together in the midst of a situation like this.”Julius Randle shared his thoughts from the Minnesota locker room, “When somebody loses their life, you never want to see that,” Randle said. “It’s tough.”Outside the arena, protests continued, and it followed inside. Chants of “ICE out” surfaced during free throws and stoppages. Members of the arena’s dunk team wore shirts aligning the same message.Kerr acknowledged the pain surrounding the game.“There’s a pall that’s been cast over the city. You can feel it,” he said. “A lot of people are suffering, and obviously a loss of life is the No. 1 concern.”As the teams prepare to meet again, Minnesota will want to get back in the game despite the overwhelming sadness the city is feeling.","The Golden State Warriors defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 111-85 on Sunday night.

"Archaeologists uncover 800,000-year-old human footprints beneath the sands of eastern England",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/archaeologists-uncover-800000-year-old-human-footprints-beneath-the-sands-of-eastern-england/articleshow/127486937.cms,"Archaeologists uncover 800,000-year-old human footprints beneath the sands of eastern England (AI-generated)

The Happisburgh 800,000-year-old footprints mark the earliest human presence in northern Europe

Soft estuarine mud helped preserve the ancient footprints

Digital recording captured the footprints before they vanished

Foot size estimates suggest a mixed age group

The footprints align with evidence of Homo antecessor

Happisburgh sediments preserve a wider record of early life

The footprints offer a brief but direct human trace





Along a quiet stretch of coastline in eastern England, a short window of low tide revealed something rarely seen in Europe. Pressed into ancient mud and briefly exposed by shifting sands, a series of human footprints emerged on a Norfolk beach. The impressions were fragile and temporary, yet clear enough to record before the sea returned. Archaeologists later confirmed the prints date back around 800,000 years, making them the oldest known human footprints ever found outside Africa. Discovered near the village of Happisburgh, the site offers direct evidence of early humans living far further north than previously confirmed. The find adds physical detail to a deep period of human history that is usually known only through scattered stone tools and fragments of bone.The footprints were uncovered on the foreshore at Happisburgh on the Norfolk coast, an area already known for its early prehistoric remains. Researchers estimate the prints were made between one million and 780,000 years ago, during the Early Pleistocene. At that time, Britain was connected to mainland Europe by a land bridge, and the climate, while cooler than southern regions, could still support human groups.According to the research article “Hominin Footprints from Early Pleistocene Deposits at Happisburgh, UK” , the impressions include prints from adults and children, suggesting a small group rather than a single individual. Their size and shape fall within the range expected for early human species living in Europe at the time.Footprints rarely survive in the archaeological record. At Happisburgh, a specific set of conditions made preservation possible. The prints were formed in soft but stable estuarine mud, likely along the edge of a slow-moving river. Soon after being made, the surface was covered by layers of fine sediment, sealing the impressions before erosion could destroy them.Over hundreds of thousands of years, coastal processes buried and later re-exposed the surface. Modern coastal erosion finally brought the prints back into view, though only briefly.The footprints were visible for only a short time before waves and wind erased them. Archaeologists worked quickly, using multi-image photogrammetry to create detailed three-dimensional digital models. These models remain the only permanent record of the footprints.Through this method, researchers could identify heel marks, arches, and in one case, toe impressions. The orientation of the prints suggests the group was walking south across a muddy flat near the water’s edge.By measuring the length of the footprints, researchers estimated the individuals ranged from about one metre to nearly one point seven metres in height. This points to a group that included both children and adults.Such evidence is rare for this period. Early human fossils from Europe are extremely scarce, especially in Britain. The footprints provide information about body size, movement, and group behaviour that bones alone often cannot.No human fossils from this time period have been found in the UK. However, the footprints match the size range of Homo antecessor, a species identified from fossil remains in Atapuerca, Spain. Homo antecessor is currently the only known human species in western Europe from a similar age.While the species cannot be confirmed without skeletal remains, the footprints are consistent with what is known from southern Europe.The footprint surface sits within the Hill House Formation, a sequence of estuarine sands and silts laid down during a warm interglacial phase. These sediments have also yielded stone tools, animal remains, and plant evidence, building a picture of a landscape that early humans could inhabit.Together, these finds show that early humans were capable of surviving in northern environments far earlier than once assumed.Unlike tools or bones, footprints capture a moment rather than an object. At Happisburgh, that moment lasted only long enough to be recorded. The sea has since reclaimed the surface.What remains is a quiet record of people moving across a muddy shore, long before Britain was an island and long before history left written traces.","The 800,000-year-old footprints mark the earliest human presence in northern Europe.

How cool were Emmanuel Macron's sunglasses?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/how-to-buy-emmanuel-macrons-sunglasses/articleshow/127298460.cms,"‘What The Hell Macron’: Trump Mocks French President’s ‘Aviators’ During World Economic Forum

For sure. For sure

.





Albert Camus wrote in the opening lines of The Myth of Sisyphus, a must-read for anyone who feels low, or can read English: “There’s only one serious philosophical problem and that is suicide. Judging whether life is or is not worth living amounts to answering the fundamental question of philosophy. All the rest—whether or not the world has three dimensions, whether the mind has nine or twelve categories—comes afterwards.”It pains me greatly to disagree with the absurdity enthusiast, but there’s one question even more important than that: how cool were Emmanuel Macron’s sunglasses at the World Economic Forum? Say what you want about the French, they always know how to do things with style. Revolutions, republics, beheadings, exiles. Even their authoritarians have style. When Jean-Paul Sartre was arrested, Charles de Gaulle asked him to be released immediately, saying in a rather bathetic style: “One doesn’t arrest Voltaire.”All of which brings us to the current head of the Fifth Republic, Emmanuel Macron, who delivered a masterclass in French oratory with his emphasis on rule of law, standing up to bullies, and languid delivery (for sure, for sure).Yet the words coming out of his mouth were hardly as captivating as what he had on his face: a pair of Henry Jullien aviators worth 650 euros (US$750) or Rs 68,000.Even Donald Trump noticed, using his favourite words to describe them: “I watched him yesterday with those beautiful sunglasses—what the hell happened?”Macron’s office claimed it was to protect his eyes from a blood vessel; others wondered if it was another domestic tiff with his former teacher.But let’s cut to the chase. As Camus pointed out in the same essay, Galileo abjured the truth as soon as it endangered his life, because philosophical pursuits matter less than real-life questions, like: where can you get those glasses?Well all you have to do is head over to the company's temporary website.The glasses were crafted by Henry Jullien, a company founded in the Jura region of France—the Champagne region of French eyewear—that has been designing and producing high-end eyewear for a century, and like all French folks want to raise even utilatarian processes to philosophical pursuits.The company uses a technique called “doublé or” gold-laminate technology, a difficult and almost lost process where layers of pure gold are bonded to metal frames. It’s not mere plating; the gold becomes integral to the structure.Each frame is made through a rigorous artisanal process involving 279 individual steps.The impact showed up immediately in the markets. iVision Tech SpA, the Milan-listed parent company that owns Henry Jullien, saw its shares surge by nearly 28% in a single session after Emmanuel Macron’s sunglasses went viral at Davos, adding roughly €3.5 million (about $4 million) to its market capitalisation. The stock initially jumped around 6% before trading was briefly halted due to heavy volumes, and then continued climbing once trading resumed.But once Macron debuted them, the internet went berserk, crashing Henry Jullien’s website—perhaps undercutting Macron’s argument about Europe’s robust predictability. Thankfully, the French company found a workaround, setting up a temporary page and writing: “Following the significant visibility of the Pacific by Henry Jullien model, worn by President Emmanuel Macron at the Davos Forum, our eShop website is experiencing an exceptional volume of visits and enquiries. To ensure stable and secure access for everyone, we have enabled this official temporary page dedicated to purchasing the model.”So anyone who is part of the European Union can order them. If you are in any other part of the world, like the Americas or even post-Brexit UK, you will have to figure out some way to get your hands on them. Currently, the website says it will take seven days for them to be shipped.In his speech, Macron said: “…having a place like Europe, which sometimes is too slow, for sure, and needs to be reformed for sure, but which is predictable, loyal, and where, well, you know that the rule of the game is just a rule of law, it’s a good place. And I think this is a good place for today and for tomorrow.”We are not sure we agree with all that, but we do want those sunglasses.Because we imagine we would be as happy as Sisyphus wearing them.",Emmanuel Macron wore a pair of Henry Jullien aviators at the World Economic Forum.

The forgotten Red Sea port that helped build the Great Pyramid



Merer’s journal shows how the Great Pyramid was built



How professional labour and elite supervision built Egypt’s iconic pyramid



How the Great Pyramid was built with precise planning







One of the biggest unanswered questions in history for the past few thousand years is the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt. Since its erection, it has been an unsolved enigma as to how the ancient Egyptians moved stones into place, as they weigh in the order of several tons each, and the sophisticated techniques they employed to shape these enormous pieces of limestone and hold them in place, as they never utilised any machines or sophisticated technology in its erection. However, in the year 2013, an important discovery was unearthed at the site called the Wadi El-Jarf in Egypt’s Red Sea coastal town, holding the Red Sea Papyri, an ancient account left by the journal of Merer, a chief overseer of the Great Pyramid, providing previously unknown details about transporting limestone from quarries and organising large teams of workers efficiently.Wadi El-Jarf today seems to lie off Egypt's Red Sea coast as a quiet patch of desert meeting sea. Yet over 4,500 years ago, it was a bustling port of immense strategic importance. First found in 1823 by British traveller John Gardner Wilkinson, the site had been mistaken for a cemetery from Greco-Roman times. Much later, during the 1950s, French archaeologists François Bissey and René Chabot-Morisseau assumed it could have been a center for metalworking.It wasn't until 2008 that French Egyptologist Pierre Tallet realised its importance: Wadi el-Jarf was an important logistical port during the reign of Pharaoh Khufu, allowing for the transport of crucial construction supplies to Giza.Approximately 240 kilometres away from the pyramid, the port managed to facilitate the shifting of copper from the Sinai Peninsula and limestone from the quarries of Tura-all by vessels traversing the Red Sea.The most revolutionary discovery made at Wadi El-Jarf was a collection of ancient papyri, now named the Red Sea Papyri. The most interesting of these are the journals written by a person named Merer, a chief overseer tasked with documenting the day-to-day activities carried out while transporting limestone slabs to be used to construct the Great Pyramid of Giza. The writings are a glimpse into the unmatched ingenuity of the ancient Egyptians.Merer's diary shows the disciplined, military-organized schedule followed by Merer's 200-strong team over a span of three months. For example:Day 25: “Inspector Merer spent the day with his team moving stones to Tura-South; spent the night at Tura-South”Day 26: “Inspector Merer left Tura-South with his team on a boat, filled with limestone blocks, to Akhet-Khufu [the Great Pyramid], spending the night at She-Khufu [administrative area near Giza].”These detailed records demonstrate the scale and detail of the operation, which included multiple trips each day, visiting quarries and the pyramid site.Until recent years, the popular imagination has cast the pyramid builders as enslaved laborers, conscripted into service by a tyrannical Pharaoh. The journal kept by Merer, however, paints a very different picture. As skilled professionals, the workers were paid in rations of bread, meat, dates, beer, and legumes because money did not form part of the Ancient Egyptian economy.The journal also presents evidence of the elite of Egypt overseeing construction. Individuals like Ânkhkhâf, half-brother of Khufu and ""chief of all the king's works,"" are found directly overseeing operations. One such fragment reads:Day 24: Inspector Merer spends the day with his za hauling [text missing] with people in elite positions, aper-teams, and the noble Ankh-haf, director of Ro-She Khufu.This would have shown that the pyramid project was a highly organized venture that brought together professional workers' know-how with the overall strategic guidance provided by the most important figures in the kingdom.What is valuable about Merer’s journal is that, while it documents movement, it also gives us an idea about ancient project management approaches. Every single move with regard to these ships carrying stones was monitored, documented, and coordinated. This was clearly unprecedented for ancient times, giving us an idea that not only did work on such an ambitious project as the Great Pyramid require manpower and materials, but also an unprecedented level of coordination, monitoring, and project management.","Wadi El-Jarf was an important logistical port during the reign of Pharaoh Khufu.
