In a format where supremacy is often short-lived and margins razor-thin, the team has an opportunity to defend a men’s T20 World Cup title — an achievement that would further strengthen their legacy in the shortest format. India are also aiming to become the first nation to lift the T20 World Cup trophy on home soil.A successful campaign would also make India the first team to win the men’s T20 World Cup three times.India’s journey in the tournament began with glory in the inaugural edition in 2007, when they defeated Pakistan in the final at the New Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg under the captaincy of Mahendra Singh Dhoni. That iconic triumph laid the foundation for India’s dominance in T20 cricket.The second title, however, came after a long wait. Seventeen years later, India returned to the summit in 2024, with Rohit Sharma leading the side to a memorable title win. India edged past South Africa in a thrilling final to finally end their prolonged title drought.Now, with momentum on their side, India will look to script another historic chapter in T20 World Cup history.","India begin their T20 World Cup 2026 campaign against USA on Saturday.

"Love, but no passage: What a killing changed for Meitei-Kuki couples",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/love-but-no-passage-what-a-killing-changed-for-meitei-kuki-couples/articleshow/128176965.cms,"TOI

IMPHAL/CHURACHANDPUR: For months, Meitei–Kuki couples in the hills and plains of Manipur believed they had reached the safest point they were likely to get. Life had not returned to what it was before violence erupted in May 2023, but it had settled into something predictable — a fragile calm that was shaped by habit and caution. On Jan 21, that sense of predictability lay shattered.Mayanglambam Rishikanta Singh, a 31‑year‑old Meitei man who had been working in Nepal, was abducted and shot dead in Churachandpur. Singh had quietly entered the Kuki‑majority district on Dec 19 via Aizawl, Mizoram, to dodge the buffer‑zone checkpoints between Imphal and Churachandpur, kin close to Chingnu Haokip’s family said. He had come to see Chingnu, his fiancée, after she sought permission from local authorities and representatives of Kuki National Organisation — an umbrella body of Kuki insurgent outfits under the Suspension of Operation agreement — and had lived with her for nearly a month before the killing. Officials later confirmed Singh was abducted by armed militants from the Tuibong area and taken to a village under Henglep police station, where he was shot dead on camera.The chilling video circulated widely. It showed Singh kneeling with folded hands before armed men, prompting Churachandpur police to register a suo motu FIR. Chingnu was taken alongside him during the abduction but was beaten and thrown out of a moving vehicle, her family said.She was admitted to a trauma ward in Churachandpur, where doctors found her suffering from acute depression and shock. In the hospital, she would answer only with nods and could not hold on to what she ate, her loss too great to bear. A further terrible blow was yet to come: both sides of the ethnic divide ostracised her, with many accusing her of betrayal and circulating threats on social messaging groups.Chingnu has since been discharged from hospital, but is still in no condition to speak. Her family told: ""We do not want any more trouble”.The killing did not spill into fresh violence across Manipur as many feared. In Imphal and Churachandpur, schools stayed open. Offices functioned. Roads reopened intermittently. But something shifted.Across, in Meitei-majority Imphal valley, separation has been a defining condition since mid-2023 for Meitei–Kuki couples. Many were forced apart during evacuations, fleeing in opposite directions for safety. Over time, it became routine — marriages sustained through phone calls, reunions deferred without timelines. Late last year, there were faint signs that the worst might be over. Some couples began, carefully, to plan. The murder on Jan 21 shook everything up again.Mawaibam Bishorjit, 30, a Meitei man, and his wife Thaja Moirang, 27, a Kuki woman from Moreh, married in 2015. Bishorjit worked as a band member at wedding functions. The couple and their two kids — a three-year-old daughter, and an 11-year-old son — fled Moreh on the night of May 3, 2023, and have been living in a relief camp set up at Ideal Girls’ College in Imphal.“If the killing of Rishikanta had not happened, we probably would have continued to plan to return home,” Bishorjit said. “We want to go back, but there must be adequate security in Moreh,” Moirang added. “Without protection, it is not possible.”A 36-year-old Meitei schoolteacher in Imphal, separated from her Kuki husband since July 2023, said she had resumed conversations she once believed were closed chapters — where they might live, which school their daughter could attend. “We were talking about when, not if,” she said. Her husband, an electrician based near Churachandpur, now discourages even tentative plans. “He keeps saying, ‘We wait'.”In the 65km between Imphal and Churachandpur lies a network of buffer zones that have become part of daily calculation for separated couples. Officially meant to prevent clashes, they function in practice as lived borders — shaped by identity checks and ethnic profiling. A 42-year-old Meitei govt clerk, whose Kuki wife has been living with her parents in the hills since 2023, put it simply: “On paper, it’s a few hours’ drive. In reality, it’s a line you don’t cross unless you must.”The drive from Imphal to Churachandpur — which once took a little over an hour — is punctuated by at least seven checkpoints where identity cards are checked and names, Aadhaar numbers, and vehicle details recorded. People know where they are not allowed to go. Meiteis do not enter Churachandpur. Kukis do not travel into the valley. The road exists. Passage does not.Thogjam Haokip, 70, a retired Kuki church pastor, has been married to his Meitei wife Kim, 50, for nearly three decades. Their marriage predates the conflict. “We are not afraid. But we are not blind,"" Kim said. We often think about how things would have turned out had we been living in another place. Would we be safe elsewhere? The thought gnaws at us.”","Mayanglambam Rishikanta Singh, a 31‑year‑old Meitei man who had been working in Nepal, was abducted and shot dead in Churachandpur.

Government confident it did better in battle of wits with opposition,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-confident-it-did-better-in-battle-of-wits-with-opposition/articleshow/128180840.cms,"Opposition targets LS Speaker with no-confidence motion — rules, process & numbers – Explained

NEW DELHI: Any hope of normalcy returning to LS was apparently dashed when opposition stepped up their offensive and submitted a notice for the removal of the Speaker. In a twist, it turned out to be the end of a week-long impasse, laying bare faultlines within the opposition as pragmatic voices wanting to be heard on key issues in the House prevailed over those favouring uncompromising rigidity and confrontation.LS functioned normally even though the govt did not agree to the conditions set by Congress: allowing LoP Rahul Gandhi to speak, rectification of the Speaker’s “baseless” claim that he had to request PM not to speak during the debate on motion of thanks to the President for her address in view of plans of Congress’ MPs to do something unprecedented, and a probe into why BJP MP Nishikant Dubey’s mic was not switched off when he attacked Nehru-Gandhi family.The prevailing view within govt was that it had come out better in the battle of wits by not making any concession to the key Congress demand of allowing Rahul to speak first and revoking the suspension of eight MPs to defuse the crisis that had stalled proceedings.What helped the govt defuse the impasse was the keenness among some key regional BJP rivals for LS to function and allow discussion on regional concerns. Bengal and Tamil Nadu, where TMC and DMK are in office, are headed to polls, while political temperature is rising in UP, where Samajwadi Party is the main opposition party, with elections only a year away.While TMC made its differences clear by not signing the notice, MPs from different non-Congress oppn parties suggested many of them did not want the first half of the session to be consumed by the deadlock.Across the aisle, BJP’s allies stood firm with the govt, backing the Speaker and criticising the opposition for targeting a constitutional office.Taking high moral ground, Birla decided not to attend till the notice is disposed of, signalling the matter may be taken up later in the session.",LS functioned normally even though the govt did not agree to the conditions set by Congress.

Ten days of love: Times Prime's February celebration everyone's talking about,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ten-days-of-love-times-primes-february-celebration-everyones-talking-about/articleshow/128167796.cms,"February has always been a month of celebration, but this year, it's lasting longer than ever. Times Prime's Love All Members Fest is back for its second edition, running February 6-15, and it's bringing something the season has been missing: ten straight days of joy, surprises, and reasons to celebrate love in every form it takes.Imagine waking up each morning knowing that at noon, something delightful is waiting for you. That's the magic of Love All Members Fest. For ten consecutive days, the Times Prime app unlocks a brand-new exclusive offer—and the anticipation has become a daily ritual for members across India.Last year's fest was a revelation. Members set noon reminders, shared their favorite finds with friends, and made spontaneous plans around the offers. This year, the celebration has grown even bigger — experiences in four cities, and a lineup that truly reflects how beautifully diverse celebration can be.February 6 opens with a golden rose from IGP—perfect whether you send it to someone special or keep it for yourself. February 7 brings Rs 1,000 off travel bookings through Klook. GIVA offers Rs 1,000 off jewelry on February 8, while FlowerAura follows with 25% off on February 9.Members also get 60% off soft toys from FirstCry on February 10, and movie lovers can grab Rs 500 off Cinepolis tickets on February 11.The beauty days arrive next: complimentary full-sized perfume from OG Beauty on February 12, and Renee's Lip Drip Glossy Balm on February 13—both free with just shipping costs. February 14 brings the most indulgent offer: 100% cashback on services at Enrich Beauty. The fest closes on February 15 with Sbooch's Kombucha set, a refreshing wellness-focused note to end the celebration.What makes this year's fest truly special is how it extends beyond your phone screen. Times Prime is bringing members together through the Wine Affair activation—featuring Sangria-making workshops at Café Noir and wine-tasting sessions at Refuge.These aren't just perks; they're experiences worth making time for. There's something uniquely wonderful about learning to craft the perfect Sangria with fellow members or discovering new wine notes in good company.For anyone navigating February solo or simply wanting to meet new people, the Singles Meets happening across Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Hyderabad offer genuine connection without pressure. Last year's Mumbai gathering filled up in 48 hours, and participants left with friendships that lasted well beyond February.There's a reason Love All Members Fest resonated so deeply in its first year. In a season that can sometimes feel prescriptive about who should celebrate and how, this fest simply opens the doors wider.Couples absolutely celebrate—but so do friends planning group outings, parents treating their kids, colleagues surprising each other, and individuals choosing to invest in themselves. The beauty is in the choice. Every day brings something new, and you take what speaks to you.""What I loved most was the lack of pressure,"" shares Anjali Verma, a Delhi-based member who participated last year. ""Some days I claimed offers for myself, some days I surprised my sister. It felt personal, not prescribed.""This approach mirrors how Indians naturally celebrate. Just as Diwali festivities stretch across days or Navratri unfolds over nine nights, February becomes a season rather than a single date. There's room to participate when it suits you, in ways that feel meaningful to your life.The fest's growth speaks volumes. From experiences in two cities to four. And membership signups double during fest periods compared to regular months.Last year saw a 67% spike in daily app engagement, with 58% of participants purchasing for themselves or for non-romantic relationships. Social media fills with members sharing their daily finds and coordinating around experiences.Beyond the individual offers, there's something compelling about the cumulative experience. Ten days of checking in. Ten days of pleasant surprises. Ten days of feeling valued.The daily unlock creates a sense of occasion. Noon becomes a moment. Opening the app feels less like a transaction and more like unwrapping a gift chosen just for you. And because each offer is live for just that day, there's genuine excitement to being part of something happening right now.Throughout the fest, members also access ""hero deals""—gift hampers, gadgets, wallet offers, and a free two-month Crunchyroll subscription. It's a thoughtfully curated celebration that recognizes how diverse the Times Prime community is.For Times Prime members, participating is simple: open the app at 12 PM daily from February 6-15 and discover what's unlocked. For experiences like wine workshops and Singles Meets, book early—the best moments fill up fast.At its heart, Love All Members Fest is about something beautifully simple: celebrating love without boundaries. Love for partners, parents, friends, yourself. Love expressed through a thoughtful gift, a shared experience, a moment of self-care, or just something that makes you smile.This February, Times Prime is proving that celebration doesn't need to fit a single mold. It can be as diverse, vibrant, and personal as the people doing the celebrating. Ten days. Countless ways to participate. One joyful, inclusive season that reminds us all: everyone deserves to feel celebrated.","Times Prime's Love All Members Fest is back for its second edition, running February 6-15.

Drake Maye's offseason plans center on wife Ann after Super Bowl LX defeat



Drake Maye did not talk about stats, schemes or revenge tours. After the Patriots fell 29-13 to the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl LX, Drake Maye made it clear what matters most to him now. The season ended. The locker room emptied. And as New England enters a 10 week break before players return, the quarterback already knows where his focus lies.The loss hurt. It ended a remarkable run that pushed the Patriots further than many expected. Yet when Maye faced reporters for the final time this season, his mind was not on missed opportunities. It was on home. More specifically, on the woman who has stood beside him since middle school and became his wife in June 2025.What is Drake Maye looking forward to this offseason? His answer came without hesitation.""I got a beautiful wife, so I look forward to spending my offseason with [her]... that's gonna be the highlight of my offseason, I can tell you that,"" Maye said.That response says plenty about who he is beyond the helmet. While fans debate roster moves and draft needs, Maye plans to step away from the spotlight and lean into a relationship that began when he was just 12 years old.He and Ann Michael grew from childhood friends into partners for life, long before the NFL cameras arrived.They married last summer, months before Maye led New England on a deep postseason push. In February 2026, he reflected on that milestone with uncommon honesty.“Getting married is one of the best decisions I’ve made in my life,” Maye told reporters in February 2026. “Good things happen when you get married, and I think that’s been the case so far in my life.”Ann has also carved out her own space in the public eye. Her TikTok cooking videos gained traction during the playoff run, turning her into a fan favorite among Patriots supporters. Maye welcomes the attention she has earned.“She’s got her own little journey that’s been awesome. Just being herself — that’s the best thing about her and what I love her for,” Maye said.Those close to the couple say Ann has rarely missed a game since junior high. From small school fields to the Super Bowl stage, she has remained a constant. The championship result did not deliver the ending they hoped for. Still, their story feels bigger than one February night.For Maye, the offseason is not about escape.

Who is Tiffany Stratton’s new boyfriend?

What happened between Tiffany Stratton and Ludwig Kaiser?

WWE Superstar Tiffany Stratton has always made headlines when it comes to in-ring action, but her personal life has also been making headlines in the recent past as well. The former NXT Women’s title holder, known to fans as the Buff Barbie, has moved on from her relationship with WWE star Ludwig Kaiser. Pregnant speculation over their demise had been reaching for months, since the pair stopped publicly appearing together.Stratton's now seemingly moved on with a brand-new partner, and social media is already in a frenzy. This week, her rumored boyfriend made his homage to the WWE star more dramatic and arguably permanent, with a tattoo of Stratton's eye on his forearm. Needless to say, the bold move quickly went viral and proved to a lot of fans that this new romance is more than just a love affair.The man behind Stratton's new romance is Shady Elnahas, an up-and-coming star currently signed to WWE. Elnahas was a national-level judoka before transitioning into professional wrestling, and represented Canada on the international stage as well. That background as an athlete eventually led him to WWE, where he has spent the past several years in the NXT system, honing his craft.For months, Elnahas and Stratton had been seen appearing together at WWE events and in personal posts on social media.They never put a label on their relationship to the public, but their interactions said it all. The most conspicuous verification arrived when Elnahas displayed the huge tattoo of a definite picture of Stratton's eye on him, instantly catching the attention of wrestling fanatics around the world.Stratton casually showed off the tattoo in a short video he posted online, where he got it inked on his arm. Fans wasted little time commenting that the seriousness of the relationship must be great for this person to make such a permanent statement. The two have since continued making appearances together and further exciting fans in doing so.Stratton was previously in a long-term relationship with WWE star Ludwig Kaiser before she began dating Shady Elnahas. With both of them really rising up the WWE power ladder at the same time, the couple was one of the most buzzed-about couples in the company. They used to make many social media and public appearances together for some time.Fans started speculating about trouble when they realized the duo had stopped posting about each other. Afterward, Kaiser was spotted with another woman, and a presumed split appeared to be in order. Kaiser and Stratton never directly commented on the breakup, but their radio silence said more than enough.","Tiffany Stratton's new boyfriend is Shady Elnahas, an up-and-coming WWE star.

LATEST ON PATRICK LAINE: Canadiens Trade Plans, Interested Teams & Potential Landing Spots!

Calgary Flames and Nashville Predators evaluate trade options before the March 6 deadline

Nazem Kadri (Flames): Elliotte Friedman reported last Thursday that NHL teams lost interest in him because other centers were available for selection, who included Vincent Trocheck and Robert Thomas.

Blake Coleman (Flames): Friedman rejected all rumors that connected him to Montreal.

Jonathan Marchessault (Predators): Friedman thinks Jonathan becomes a potential candidate when he decides to lift his no-movement clause.

Ryan O’Reilly (Predators): The Canadiens still want O'Reilly, although Nashville's future remains uncertain because Barry Trotz will leave his GM position after the team finds his successor.

The Montreal Canadiens have improved their ability to compete this season, which has changed how people view Patrik Laine. Laine scored 20 goals during 52 games last season, which helped Montreal reach the playoffs. The Canadiens currently hold the second position in the Atlantic Division and maintain the third-highest scoring rate in the NHL with 3.46 goals per game, demonstrating their capacity to score points without depending on a single player.Laine, who is currently 27 years old, has returned to skating after completing his recovery from abdominal surgery. His current situation has become a focal point as the March 6 NHL trade deadline approaches. The Montreal decision makers must consider three elements of his contract, which include his $8.7 million cap hit, his eligibility for unrestricted free agency this summer, and his 10-team no-trade list.The Montreal Canadiens reportedly plan to retain 50 percent of Laine's salary, according to Sportsnet reporter Eric Engels. The Canadiens will not include extra assets for his trade, according to league sources.Marco D'Amico, who writes for RG.org, identified multiple teams that could match their needs.The Calgary team must sell its players because they lack playoff prospects. The Kings added Artemi Panarin to their roster, but need to strengthen their center position. Laine has two problems with his injury history and rental status, which prevent Carolina and Seattle from making strong trade offers.David Staples from the Edmonton Journal reported that Sportsnet analyst Nick Kypreos suggested that Edmonton should acquire Laine. Staples questioned the idea, noting the Oilers' tight cap situation.Trade discussions are still happening:The Montreal team demonstrates a long-term vision through its handling of Laine instead of making emotional responses to his situation. The Canadiens now possess the ability to wait for their players to develop because their scoring capacity has expanded and their operational methods have become more adaptable.","Montreal Canadiens could explore Patrik Laine trade options.

Erika Kirk breaks silence after TPUSA’s halftime tribute divides Super Bowl audience

The night of Super Bowl LX was more than just football and a show. A competing halftime show away from the main broadcast stirred up feelings, controversy, and political symbolism. Turning Point USA pushed its All American Halftime Show as a patriotic alternative, drawing attention not only for its message but for the personal grief woven into the production.In the hours after the show aired, Erika Kirk broke her silence. Her words reframed the night as something deeper than a ratings fight or culture war moment. For supporters, it became a tribute. For critics, it raised fresh questions about politics, platform power, and how grief is carried into public space.The alternative show, organized by Turning Point USA, aired opposite Bad Bunny ’s NFL halftime performance during the championship game between the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks. Headlined by Kid Rock, the event leaned heavily into honoring the late Charlie Kirk, who was killed in September.A montage played during the broadcast featured Kirk’s own words, including: “I want to honor God in all that I do. I want to be a great husband, a great father.I want to serve this country,” followed by: “I want to try to continue to lead this movement and to speak truth and to never lie, to stop thinking about yourself all of the time, and instead think about what you should do to help other people and defend this country above yourself.She further added, “I am so inspired by this army of freedom fighters. We’re going to be around for the next 100, 200 years because we know in the end our ideas will win.”Erika Kirk did not attend the event, but she later praised it publicly, calling the show “so incredible” and adding, “Charlie would’ve absolutely loved it. Thank you to the millions that tuned in.”She closed her message with a personal note that resonated across social media: “Ultimately, this is what it’s all about, making Heaven crowded.…I love you Charlie baby, this is all for you.”Despite being blocked from streaming on X, the broadcast claimed millions of viewers across platforms. Whether those numbers hold or not, the emotional weight of the tribute ensured the night would be remembered for more than just music or politics.","Erika Kirk spoke out after Turning Point USA aired its alternative Super Bowl LX halftime show honoring her late husband, Charlie Kirk.

How the Seahawks cornerback’s championship night became a shared, emotional milestone beyond the field



(Image via: Nijeria McClain's IG)

Devon Witherspoon’s first Super Bowl victory with the Seattle Seahawks was not just a career defining moment. It was also a deeply personal one shaped by the quiet presence of someone who has shared the highs and lows of his rise to the NFL. As the Seahawks secured a 29 to 13 win over the New England Patriots, the spotlight naturally fell on the players. But just beyond the bright lights, Witherspoon's partner Nijeria McClain was living the moment in her own unforgettable way.For Witherspoon, the night represented how quickly life can change in professional football. From draft-day expectations to Super Bowl confetti, the journey has moved fast. McClain’s support throughout that journey added emotional weight to the celebration, turning a championship win into a shared milestone rather than a solo achievement.On Monday afternoon, McClain shared a carousel of photos that captured the spirit of the night from her point of view. The images showed her celebrating Witherspoon and the Seahawks while also expressing her own personality. She wore a custom long sleeved, off the shoulder dress featuring Witherspoon’s image across the front. The look was paired with brown leather boots and a clear stadium style handbag, a mix of fashion and game day practicality.Her caption carried the emotion of the moment without overthinking it. “Gosh what a nightttt 💚💙Every win is sweeter with #21 , Especially a a SUPERBOWL WIN !” The words reflected pride, excitement, and the joy of standing beside someone at the peak of his profession.The pair then took photos on the field enjoying the view long after the final whistle. As the crowd thinned and the celebrations went on around them, the pictures became personal even with the huge stage. To Witherspoon, the victory was another milestone to a young career that had a bright future.Chosen at the fifth overall pick in the 2023 NFL Draft by the Seattle Seahawks, he was entering the league with big expectations and performance, and the night proved to be more than that. This was a reminder that behind every Super Bowl moment is a personal walk of support, belief, and shared dreams.","Devon Witherspoon and Nijeria McClain celebrate Seahawks' Super Bowl win.

Inside India’s net session ahead of T20 World Cup match vs Namibia

Aaram se, jaldi khaa liyo

Opener Abhishek Sharma has been hospitalised due to a stomach infection and remains doubtful for India’s next match against Namibia in New Delhi. It has been reliably learnt that he was unwell even before the previous game against the USA, and his condition worsened after he took the field in the T20 World Cup opener on February 7. The youngster was running a high temperature in Mumbai and was administered drips for immediate relief.The left-hander skipped the team’s first training session at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Tuesday. While “upset stomach” is the official word from the Indian camp, TimesofIndia.com has learnt that he is suffering from an infection.“Abhi (Abhishek) still has a few issues with his tummy. We are hopeful that he’ll be available for the game in two days’ time,” assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate said during a media interaction on Tuesday.After being dismissed for a golden duck in the tournament opener, the aggressive southpaw did not come out to field and was not spotted in the team dugout or dressing room. Sanju Samson fielded for the entire innings, forcing fielding coach T Dilip to wear the bib and handle drinks duties along with Kuldeep Yadav.This was because Washington Sundar had not yet joined the squad, while Jasprit Bumrah was also unwell. Although Bumrah made a brief appearance during one of the drinks breaks, the responsibilities were largely shared between Kuldeep and Dilip.Abhishek did not even come out for the post-match handshakes.Although he travelled with the team to Delhi, his condition deteriorated over the last 24 hours. Abhishek was seen with the rest of the squad outside head coach Gautam Gambhir ’s residence on February 8, but all was not well. Towards the latter part of the innings, Gambhir appeared visibly concerned when Abhishek was dismissed. “(take it easy, eat early),” was the Indian coach’s brief advice to the youngster.In Abhishek’s absence during the practice session, Sanju Samson was the first batter to take to the nets and looked uncomfortable while facing Hardik Pandya and Arshdeep Singh. The wicketkeeper-batter appeared low on confidence and had a scratchy session before receiving extended treatment on his left arm.“We’re waiting on Abhi’s fitness more than anything, and that will again open up a few different combinations,” ten Doeschate said while discussing possible Playing XI options.Wednesday’s net session and the pre-match press conference are expected to provide greater clarity on Abhishek’s fitness and recovery timeline.",Abhishek Sharma has been hospitalised due to a stomach infection.

How PCB, ICC, BCB reached a resolution on India vs Pakistan T20 World Cup match

NEW DELHI: Sri Lanka batter Bhanuka Rajapaksa has clarified his recent comments about the bats used by Indian cricketers after they sparked major controversy during the T20 World Cup 2026.His earlier remarks were interpreted by many as an allegation of “bat-tampering” or unfair equipment advantages for Team India, but Rajapaksa said his words were misunderstood and taken out of context.In a social media post, Rajapaksa explained that his intention was to praise India’s cricketing setup and equipment standards, not accuse anyone of wrongdoing.“Hi all, just a quick clarification about comments from a recent interview that have been interpreted differently and, in parts, lost in translation,"" he wrote.“My point was meant as praise: Indian cricket is incredibly advanced, from its systems and infrastructure to its equipment standards. Their bat manufacturers are truly among the best in the world. In hindsight, I could have provided clearer context. Nothing but respect always,"" he added.The controversy began after Rajapaksa was quoted as saying, “Indian players have bats that are far superior to the best bats we get. It feels as though a layer of rubber has been applied. I can’t imagine how that’s possible. These bats can’t even be bought by others — all players know this.""These comments led to online debates and speculation about whether Indian players were using special or modified bats.However, no official complaint was made to the ICC, and neither India nor Sri Lanka issued any formal statement on the matter. The episode mainly remained a social media and fan discussion.In cricket, ball tampering has long been a sensitive topic, but bats have also been discussed in the past, especially regarding size and power.The ICC has rules on bat dimensions, such as the maximum thickness of the edges, but there are no regulations on the quality of the willow used to make bats.With English willow becoming rarer and more expensive, some fear that wealthier teams and players could gain an equipment advantage.",Sri Lanka batter Bhanuka Rajapaksa has clarified his recent comments about the bats used by Indian cricketers.

Why is Ahmedabad likely to be the sporting capital of India? | Bombay Sport Exchange

The ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026 continues on February 11 with three major group-stage matches featuring Afghanistan vs South Africa, Australia vs Ireland, and England vs West Indies. These games bring together former champions, title contenders, and dangerous underdogs, making it a crucial day in the tournament.In Group D, Afghanistan face South Africa at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. Afghanistan will be eager to bounce back after a five-wicket loss to New Zealand in their opener. Despite the defeat, they are considered a dangerous side, having beaten teams like New Zealand and Australia in the previous World Cup and reaching the semi-finals.Led by Rashid Khan , Afghanistan have a strong spin-heavy squad with key players like Rahmanullah Gurbaz, Mohammad Nabi, Mujeeb Ur Rahman, and Noor Ahmad.South Africa, meanwhile, started their campaign strongly with a 56-run win over Canada. The Proteas, led by Aiden Markram, are one of the strongest teams yet to win a T20 World Cup and boast stars like Quinton de Kock , David Miller, Kagiso Rabada, and Anrich Nortje. Historically, South Africa have dominated Afghanistan, winning all three of their previous meetings.Recent form suggests South Africa have been more consistent, while Afghanistan have had mixed results.In another Group D match, Australia take on Ireland. Australia, the 2021 champions, begin their campaign against Ireland, who are looking for their first win after losing to Sri Lanka. Mitchell Marsh captains the Australian side, which includes key players such as Travis Head, Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Adam Zampa , and Tim David.Although Australia’s recent form has been inconsistent, they are expected to build momentum as the tournament progresses. Ireland, led by Paul Stirling, have a history of causing upsets and previously beat England in the 2022 edition.Their squad includes Josh Little, Curtis Campher, Harry Tector, and George Dockrell. Australia have won both previous T20 World Cup encounters against Ireland, but Ireland’s recent form suggests they could be competitive.In Group C, England and West Indies meet at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai in a high-profile clash between two-time champions. England, captained by Harry Brook , narrowly beat Nepal in their opener, while West Indies started with a comfortable win over Scotland.England’s squad features Jos Buttler, Jofra Archer, Phil Salt, Sam Curran, and Adil Rashid, while West Indies are led by Shai Hope and include power-hitters like Shimron Hetmyer, Rovman Powell, and Sherfane Rutherford, along with all-rounders Jason Holder and Romario Shepherd.The head-to-head record between England and West Indies is extremely close, with England leading 19-18, highlighting how evenly matched these sides are.Recent form shows both teams coming in with strong momentum."," ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2026 continues on February 11 with three major group- stage matches.

Inside India’s net session ahead of T20 World Cup match vs Namibia

Washington provides options

NEW DELHI: India’s pacers and spinners split into two separate nets on either of the centre square here at the Ferozeshah Kotla on Tuesday evening. For the next two hours, the bowlers bowled with full intensity, a rare scenario in the middle of a long and important tournament, in which players look to preserve energy for the big moments. The batters’ persistent assault has hogged headlines for over a month. Under the Kotla lights, the spotlight fell firmly on the bowlers going flat out two days out ahead of the game against Namibia here.Only Abhishek Sharma, still recovering from a stomach illness, didn’t turn up for the rigorous session.The prep, expectedly, was for beyond just the match against Namibia. From the looks of it, the Indian team is carrying out a distinct change in their approach. With the match against Pakistan in Colombo on Feb 15 clearing all administrative and political hurdles late on Monday night, it’s time to put attention to detail. The scare against USA last Saturday notwithstanding, the tournament truly gets underway from Sunday for India. The conditions in Colombo, which have been distinctly different to what India have been playing in recently, are going to consume a lot of mind space.“We understand the sentiments and the different politics between the two countries. But I think it’s really important for us just to focus on the cricket side of things. It’s going to be a challenge going to Colombo, where Pakistan have been (stationed) for the last two weeks. We are fully focused on bringing our best game to that fixture next week,” India’s straight-talking assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate said on Tuesday.The nature of pitches in the tournament in general has not encouraged big scores so far. The comparatively sluggish pitch at the Premadasa stadium in Colombo, in particular, definitely isn’t going to escape the attention of the Indian think-tank. Hence, there’s this urge to deviate from the all-out-aggressive brand of batting, with the pitches expected to get tired and slower as the tournament progresses.“Judging how the pitches have played in the first five or six days of the tournament, there might be a slight revision in strategy and how we go about that,” Doeschate said.“The pitches haven’t played quite the way we thought yet and again we want to be adaptive. We should have been a lot better than we were in Mumbai (against USA). We have been going all out but with the kind of pitches around, you want a bit of technique,” he added before shifting the focus on the bowling attack.“I don’t think our bowlers have fired yet,” Doeschate said. “It’s maybe a little bit easy to look at the USA game and say that was a really good bowling performance, but you have to analyse it objectively in terms of where we put the ball and how we used the ball. We expect a lot more from the bowlers as well.“Having the world-class bowlers that we have, it does give the batters that freedom to make mistakes in this format. If you’re shooting for 250 all the time, you’re going to make mistakes. But we need to react to situations as well,” Doeshcate said.With Washington Sundar going through his first practice session after recovering from a rib injury he sustained a month ago, the team has started reviewing combinations based on pitch conditions. “You know the luxury of having four allrounders is that you can change the combination. This is where Washington fits in,” Doeschate said.","India's pacers and spinners split into two separate nets on either of the centre square here at the Ferozeshah Kotla on Tuesday evening.

Mizkif reflects on Maya Higa breakup while discussing JasonTheWeen and Sakura split,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/mizkif-reflects-on-maya-higa-breakup-while-discussing-jasontheween-and-sakura-split/articleshow/128175138.cms,"Image Via Instagram

Mizkif draws parallels between his breakup and JasonTheWeen–Sakura split

“This is a very similar situation to me and Maya. I was the popular one, she came into my circle, and all of her friends became my friends,”

“This is actually going to make Jason’s career grow. People are going to be more invested in his life and what’s next,”

“The person who’s really going to struggle is Sakura. Where do you go from here when all of your friends are his friends?”





Streamer Mizkif highlighted his past relationship in the course of reacting to the breakup between JasonTheWeen and Sakura. Speaking at a Kick stream, Mizkif related that watching their breakup brought back memories of his breakup with the streamer Maya Higa. His remarks were unique because the personal experience was correlated with a current and widely discussed streamer breakup. Fans immediately drew upon the comparison because all parties involved have online audiences and public personal lives.This, however, happened just a day after JasonTheWeen and Sakura revealed that they had parted ways on February 9, 2026. The two, however, made a joint post where they revealed that they had broken up while still maintaining their respect for each other. The breakup evidently did not come as a surprise, as there had been rumors developing online, including the possibility of Jason cheating on his partner, which he vehemently denied while streaming. The breakup is not the first, either, as the two had parted ways in August 2025 before reuniting.While discussing the situation, Mizkif directly compared it to his own past with Maya Higa.he said.He explained that in streaming relationships, one partner is often more established, which can shape how friendships and careers grow during the relationship.Mizkif also shared his thoughts on how the breakup could affect JasonTheWeen and Sakura differently.he said, suggesting that public attention often increases after major personal events. However, he added that Sakura may face a harder path forward.he asked.His words touched on the common phenomenon where, in the world of streaming, the lines between relationships, work, friendships, and online communities sometimes blend. The experience of having gone through a breakup can find a person starting from scratch or feeling isolated in their social and professional life.Ultimately, however, it was Mizkif's reflections that provided a wider overview on the impact of public break-ups, beyond the emotional toll they can take on an individual. Shared fan bases ensure that, even when a relationship comes to an end, it can have a lingering effect on both parties, and it was with this recognition that JasonTheWeen and Sakura are now moving forward, as illustrated with Mizkif's reflections on this all-too-familiar situation within live stream culture.","JasonTheWeen and Sakura announced their breakup on February 9, 2026.

Was Lil Baby involved in the Keion White shooting? What we know about the nightclub incident,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/was-lil-baby-involved-in-the-keion-white-shooting-what-we-know-about-the-nightclub-incident/articleshow/128175319.cms,"Image - X

Keion White shot at San Francisco nightclub; Lil Baby was present before gunfire, police say

Super Bowl LX was supposed to be a night of celebration for San Francisco, but for 49ers defensive lineman Keion White, the party ended with a literal bang. Just hours after the Seattle Seahawks hoisted the trophy at Levi's Stadium on February 8, 2026, White found himself trading his jersey for a hospital gown after a heated confrontation at a club.Around 4:00 a.m. on Monday, February 9, Dahlia, a popular nightclub in San Francisco’s Mission District was buzzing with the usual post-Super Bowl energy and floors literally carpeted in dollar bills, according to police reports.White was hosting an exclusive, private party in the club’s basement. Enter rapper Lil Baby (Dominique Jones), who tried to crash the downstairs VIP section. What followed wasn't a friendly ""Who’s Who"" of the Bay Area, but a heated verbal sparring match between the 6'5"" lineman and the Grammy winner’s crew.As the argument reached a boiling point, the music was interrupted by two gunshots. White was struck in the left ankle, causing the crowd to scatter in what witnesses described as ""utter pandemonium.""When the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) arrived, they found a 9mm and a .45-caliber shell casing, evidence that at least two guns were in play. But here’s where it gets interesting, despite being the victim, Keion White has been famously ""uncooperative"" with investigators.When asked who pulled the trigger, White reportedly kept his lips sealed, sticking to a strict ""no-snitch"" code that has left police scrambling for surveillance footage to identify the shooter.The good news? White underwent successful surgery at San Francisco General Hospital, and the 49ers expect a full recovery before the 2026 season kicks off.As for Lil Baby, while he was physically present and involved in the argument, he has not been named a suspect or charged. For now, the shooter remains an ""unknown suspect"" lost in the sea of post-game revelry.It’s a bizarre, high-stakes reminder that sometimes the most dangerous hits don't happen on the turf, they happen after the clock hits zero.","49ers defensive lineman Keion White was shot in the ankle at Dahlia, a popular nightclub in San Francisco's Mission District.

Radko Gudas is looking forward to adding another Olympic medal to his family’s collection



Radko Gudas smiled when talking about his father, Leo, who won bronze as a defenseman for Czechoslovakia at the 1992 Albertville Olympics. He was just 18 months old at the time, but the medal has been part of family lore ever since.He has held it many times. He thinks he wore it as a kid. And his father makes sure he never forgets about it. The 35-year-old Anaheim Ducks captain and Team Czechia alternate is making his second Olympic appearance and wants nothing more than to bring an Olympic medal to the national side.With Gudas on the Czech squad at Sochi 2014, he brings much-needed veteran presence to his side. While he would’ve loved to be part of the 2018 Games in PyeongChang or the 2022 Games in Beijing, NHL players didn’t participate in either.But his dad’s medal continued to be his motivation till he got his second chance at the Winter Olympics. ""My dad is always waving at me the bronze medal from Albertville, so it's kind of like, I need to beat him to be able to wave at him something too,"" Gudas said after practice at Santagiulia Arena on Tuesday.Gudas has played 872 games over 14 NHL seasons with Tampa Bay, Philadelphia, Washington, Florida, and Anaheim. He remains one of the league's most physical players, ranking second in hits since 2012-13 with 3,205, behind only Matt Martin.When asked if he's aging like fine wine, Gudas offered a different comparison. ""I'm more of a beer guy than wine,"" he said with a laugh. ""But yeah, I never thought I was going to be at this age at this level, so I'm really happy.""Vancouver Canucks center David Kampf, a Team Czechia teammate, knows what it's like facing Gudas from the other side. ""It's always tough to play against him,"" Kampf said. ""He's a heavy, heavy guy and playing hard, so it's nice to have him on my side.""Gudas said his father will travel to Milan later in the tournament, perhaps for the most important games. His mother, wife, and kids are already there, soaking in the experience.""It's a fun time in our family,"" he said. ""The kids are really enjoying it. We show the kids that their grandpa was at the Olympics, too. Now I'm here too, so they're kind of soaking it in.""The Czechs open against Canada on Thursday in what Gudas called one of their biggest challenges. He believes this team can compete with anyone in the tournament despite facing powerhouse nations loaded with NHL talent.","Radko Gudas is looking forward to adding another Olympic medal to his family’s collection.

Starting against Slovakia, Juuse Saros will try to redeem himself with his national side



Things have not gone the way Juuse Saros wanted this season. The Nashville Predators' goalie has struggled to find consistency, posting career-worst numbers through 56 games. Now, on the eve of the men's hockey tournament at the Olympic Winter Games Milano Cortina 2026, Saros is looking for a hard reset with Team Finland.Saros has been one of the busiest netminders in the NHL this season, tied with Karel Vejmelka of the Utah Mammoth for the league lead with 44 starts. But the workload has not translated to success, as his .892 save percentage ranks as the lowest of his 10-season career. The Predators sit at 26-23-7, fifth in the Central Division.The 30-year-old will get the nod when Finland opens Group B play against Slovakia on Wednesday at 10:40 a.m. ET at Santagiulia Arena. Saros said he is viewing the Olympics as a completely different challenge from his NHL struggles.""This is a completely different game and a different tournament, and I am trying to focus on this for as long as we are here,"" Saros told reporters Tuesday. He is expected to be Finland's No. 1 throughout the tournament as the defending gold medalists chase back-to-back titles.Despite his NHL struggles, Saros has earned the trust of his teammates and coaching staff.Boston Bruins defenseman Henri Jokiharju dismissed the redemption storyline surrounding his goalie. ""I don't think he has to prove himself to anyone,"" Jokiharju said.""He's a top goalie in the NHL and in this tournament, and he doesn't need to prove himself to anyone."" Saros struggled at last season's 4 Nations Face-Off, but he rebounded brilliantly at the 2025 World Championships.He posted a 4-2-0 record with a .943 save percentage and a 1.67 goals-against average, showing the form that made him one of the league's elite netminders. Finland coach Antti Pennanen referenced that performance when discussing his No. 1 goalie.""He is one of the best goalies in the NHL, and last [Worlds] he was really, really good,"" Pennanen said. ""We trust in him because he is a really good goalie."" Vancouver Canucks goalie Kevin Lankinen, who will back up Saros, praised his teammate's work ethic and athletic ability.""He's obviously super talented,"" he said. ""He's not the biggest guy, but he's athletic."" Lankinen also pushed back on the notion that Saros needs to redeem himself, calling the Olympics ""a clean slate for all of us.""Finland will face Sweden on Thursday at 6:10 a.m. ET before concluding Group B play against Italy on Saturday at 10:40 a.m. ET.

Speculation intensified when Cardi left the event early and reports surfaced alleging Diggs was seen with another woman in a hotel room hours after the loss.

Cardi B and Stefon Diggs face split speculation after hotel room claim

Tension around Cardi B and Stefon Diggs has moved from whispers to full-blown speculation, with fans closely watching every digital and public move. What once looked like a high-profile romance backed by public appearances and loyalty now appears strained, especially after Super Bowl weekend triggered a fresh wave of questions.Online observers were quick to notice subtle but telling changes. Social media connections vanished. Public support faded. Cardi, who had long defended Diggs and showed up for his biggest career moments, appeared distant during a night that usually brings couples closer together. That silence spoke louder than words for many fans following the pair closely.The speculation intensified after reports surfaced about an alleged incident following the Super Bowl loss. According to circulating claims, Diggs was seen with someone unexpected shortly after the game, sparking renewed debate about trust within the relationship. One claim spreading rapidly online states:“caught TONIGHT (February 8) sneaking his girl bestfriend into his hotel room not even an hour after he lost the superbowl.”Neither Cardi B nor Stefon Diggs has publicly addressed the allegation. Still, fans connected the dots after Cardi reportedly left the Super Bowl event early following her appearance during Bad Bunny’s performance. She did not stay on to support Diggs, a move that felt unusual given her past commitment to cheering him on from the stands.The timeline has just contributed to the mystery. Later that year in late 2024, the couple started dating and created the first child together named Baby Brim in November, 2025.The abrupt change of tone also seemed more acute with that milestone because it was more personal to people following their story.At this, all is still unproven. But in the celebrity relationship world, silence can be called upon to draw conclusions. No matter which way this chapter is closed, be it reconciliation or separation, the allure around Cardi B and Stefon Diggs is not going to decrease.","Cardi B and Stefon Diggs face split speculation after hotel room claim.

Group B preview: Who leads Men's Hockey at Olympic Winter Games Milano Cortina 2026?

The Men’s Hockey at the Olympic Winter Games Milano Cortina 2026 is set to commence this Wednesday, with 12 teams divided into three pools competing against one another for playoff spots. The Group B bracket, which includes Sweden, Finland, Slovakia, and the home team, Italy, is arguably one of the more evenly contested in the draw, boasting both medal contenders and dark horse candidates.Each team will play the others through a round-robin schedule, with the winners of the groups as well as the best second-placed team qualifying for the quarterfinals. Qualification playoffs will be on Feb. 17 for the eight teams, while the quarterfinals will be on Feb. 18. The medal games will wrap up the tournament, with the gold medal determined on Feb. 22. The coverage will be shown on NBC outlets in the USA and CBC in Canada.Sweden will start as a group B team and will be expected to win gold. Sweden won silver medals at the last Sochi Winter Olympics, held in 2014, and they have top talent in their lineup as well as a level of roster depth that will be valuable. Gabriel Landeskog will be their leading forward, who will be backed by Nylander, Zibanejad, and Forsberg, while the team’s strength will lie at the back, where Hedman, Karlsson, Dahlin, and Forsling will be an unmatchable combination of talent and depth.Only between the pipes will they be uncertain, with Gustavsson expected to start, though their main challenge will be against rival Finland, which will be their potential rivals for top honors.Finns, the current Olympic champions after claiming the top prize in 2022 without NHL players, once again rely on structure, discipline, and work ethic. While they boast offensive weapons in Mikko Rantanen, Sebastian Aho, and Roope Hintz, defensive and goaltending issues remain areas of concern, especially with the loss of Aleksander Barkov to injury into the arms of goalies Juuse Saros, Kevin Lankinen, and Joonas Korpisalo. Mikael Granlund takes on the role of team captain.It looks like the dark horse that might spoil the party is Slovakia. As the bronze medal winners of the last tournament in 2022, they have some young talents such as Juraj Slafkovsky and Simon Nemec. Additionally, they have some older and more experienced players, such as the NHL defensemen Erik Cernak and Martin Fehervary. The other contributor to the forward line is the veteran Tomas Tatar.Italy completes the group, serving as the host and underdog. Under the guidance of the 2022 world champions’ head coach, Jukka Jalonen, Italy aims for improvement and contention. Damian Clara helms the predominantly European-based Italian squad from their home country with dreams of upsetting the opposition and gaining valuable world championship exposure.","The Men’s Hockey at the Olympic Winter Games Milano Cortina 2026 is set to commence this Wednesday.

Iliia Malinin's early life



Iliia Malinin's career



Iliia Malinin's earnings



Ilia Malinin has become one of the most significant figures in the history of men's figure skating. Universally known by his self-coined nickname ""Quad God."" His competitive dominance has been striking. However, Malinin's significance goes beyond the stats. Ilia has highlighted an unusual appreciation for skating as entertainment, purposefully incorporating non-scoring elements, such as backflips and signature transitions, to excite audiences and increase the sport's popularity. According to Celebrity Net Worth , the American Olympian has a net worth of $1 million.Ilia Malinin was born on December 2, 2004, in Fairfax, Virginia. He comes from an elite family of skaters. Tatiana Malinina, his mother, who represented Uzbekistan in the 1998 Winter Olympics and went on to win the Grand Prix Final, and his father, Roman Skorniakov, represented Uzbekistan at the 1998 and 2002 Winter Games. Valery Malinin, his grandfather, was a Soviet athlete and coach for many years.Malinin did not take to skating right away, even with the lineage. As a child, he also preferred soccer and other activities, but his dedication began to stand out once his jumping ability did.The moment skating became a vehicle for self-expression rather than inheritance.Malinin's first significant international breakthrough marked his victory at the 2022 World Junior Championships. That victory followed a controversial setback earlier that year, when he was left off the U.S. Olympic team. The transition to senior competition came quickly. Malinin won his first senior U.S. national title and soon established himself as a regular on the Grand Prix podium.He became the first skater to land a quad axel in competition, a 4½-rotation jump long viewed as impossible under pressure. He became the only skater to do seven quadruple jumps in a single free skate, giving him a significantly higher scoring ceiling far above his rivals.Malinin popularized characteristic moves like the ""raspberry twist,"" a horizontal spin leap that was named after the translation of his Russian surname, and spectacular backflips that never win points but always electrify audiences.Malinin's career took a significant shift when he brought Hall of Fame coach Rafael Arutyunyan to his club. Under his guidance, he refined his efficiency and competitive strategy. Choreographer Shae-Lynn Bourne helped him hone his musicality and performance quality.Malinin has also emerged as the Winter Olympics' most commercially valuable figure skater. He earned roughly $700,000 over 12 months leading up to the 2026 Olympics, making him the highest-paid skater at the Games. The majority of his income has come from official Olympic sponsors, including Coca-Cola and Xfinity, with agreements structured to limit overexposure and safeguard long-term value.Athletes like Chloe Kim and Lindsey Vonn, who turned their Olympic victories into multimillion-dollar yearly salaries, have drawn comparisons to Malinin.","Iliia Malinin was born on December 2, 2004, in Fairfax, Virginia.

Justin Verlander officially returns to the Detroit Tigers

Tarik Skubal reacts with excitement on social media

The return of Justin Verlander to his old stomping grounds has created quite the stir in Major League Baseball. The Tigers made it official Tuesday by announcing that the franchise icon is returning on a one-year, $13 million contract. The now 43-year-old Verlander returns to the organization that originally drafted him in 2004, where his Hall of Fame-caliber career began. The move immediately adds a veteran presence and a familiar face as the team attempts to build on a recent step forward.When the centers were announced earlier this month, fans and players created plenty of buzz in the immediate aftermath, but few reactions stood out more than current Tigers ace Tarik Skubal. The newly acquired left-hander took to the social media platform to celebrate the signing, adding some context on how pleased he was for Verlander to join the clubhouse. Detroit baseball had already delivered a lot of excitement, but his response added to the viral moments of the day.On Tuesday, the Tigers announced that Justin Verlander will once again pitch for the state of Detroit during the regular season. This one-year, $13 million deal is almost poetic for the former MVP and multi-time Cy Young Award winner.Verlander made his debut with the Tigers in 2005, developing into one of the most dominant pitchers of his generation in the Old English D.Verlander was traded away in 2017, but later accomplished even more with a few other teams. He won more titles, achieved more career milestones, and kept showing he could play with the best in the world well into his 40s. As he heads back to where it all started, Detroit is looking to his experience and leadership to help guide a burgeoning, young, talented roster back to the postseason.Number one on that celebration list was Tarik Skubal, the current guy at the front of the line in the Detroit rotation. Not long after the team announced the signing, Skubal took to X (formerly Twitter) to post an animated reaction that really summed up his excitement. Tigers fans and media outlets latched onto Verlander's exquisite self-portrait.Skubal also had a particularly weighty quip to offer, given that over the previous two seasons he's risen to become one of the better pitchers in baseball. Now the American League Cy Young winner of 2021, he has been the anchor of Detroit's rotation, and the idea of a Verlander-to-Skubal pairing immediately gained the attention of the fanbase. The respect and love the veteran commands within the game was noted by many supporting Skubal over the weekend.","Justin Verlander returns to the Detroit Tigers on a one-year, $13 million contract.

When does NFL Free Agency start in 2026?

When is the 2026 NFL Draft?

Thursday, April 23rd - Round 1 (8 p.m. ET)

Friday, April 24th - Rounds 2 and 3 (7 p.m. ET)

Saturday, April 25th - Rounds 4 to 7 (12 p.m. ET)

With Super Bowl LX now over, the focus across the league quickly shifts from celebrations to roster building. For fans of the Seattle Seahawks, and the rest of the NFL the offseason is just as important as the regular season.Two of the biggest dates on the NFL calendar are free agency and the NFL Draft. Here’s a simple guide to when they happen and what to expect in 2026.NFL free agency officially begins on March 11th 2026, at 4 p.m. ET, which marks the start of the new league year.However things start heating up even before that. The legal tampering period opens on March 9 at noon ET. During this two-day window, teams are allowed to negotiate with agents of players whose contracts are set to expire. While deals cannot be signed yet, agreements are often reported during this period.Before free agency, teams also have the option to use the franchise or transition tag on key players. The designation window runs from February 17th to March 3rd. The tag allows a team to keep a player on a one-year deal, usually at a high salary while preventing him from immediately hitting the open market.Free agency often brings major headlines that include blockbuster signings, surprise team switches and big-money contracts.With the salary cap expected to rise again in 2026, this year’s free agency period could be particularly active.The 2026 NFL Draft will take place from April 23 to April 25, 2026. This year’s draft will be held in Pittsburgh, with events centered around Acrisure Stadium and Point State Park. The draft spans three days:The first round usually draws the most attention, as teams select franchise-changing players. This year’s class is expected to feature top prospects at quarterback, wide receiver and edge rusher, with Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza widely projected as a potential No. 1 overall pick.Before draft night, teams evaluate prospects at the NFL Scouting Combine which takes place on February 23rd to March 2nd in Indianapolis. They also attend pro days and conduct private visits.From free agency in March to the draft in April, the NFL offseason moves quickly. While there may be no games on Sundays, the drama never really stops.","NFL free agency officially begins on March 11th 2026, which marks the start of the new league year.

"4 men meet in Tihar jail, walk out and gang up for burglaries; held after theft spree in Ghaziabad",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ghaziabad/4-men-meet-in-tihar-jail-walk-out-and-gang-up-for-burglaries-held-in-ghaziabad/articleshow/128182697.cms,"4 meet in Tihar, walk out & gang up for burglaries





GHAZIABAD: Four men, recently released from Tihar jail, were arrested for a series of burglaries targeting homes and jewellery shops in the city.According to police, the suspects regrouped after they recently walked out of Tihar, where some had been lodged in connection with theft cases. Investigators said the gang carried out multiple burglaries between Feb 1 and 5, striking residential properties and attempting to break into jewellery showrooms.A senior police officer said the first incident was reported on the night of Feb 1, when a group broke into a bungalow in Raj Nagar while the owners were away. The burglars made off with a small locker containing documents and a passport. The homeowner, Ashwani Chaudhary, found the theft on returning the following day and lodged a complaint at Kavi Nagar police station.On Feb 5, police received another complaint after seven men attempted to break into two jewellery showrooms on Ambedkar Road. Officers said the group broke the lock of one showroom around 3am and was trying to cut chain locks on the rear door of an adjacent store when neighbours noticed the activity and alerted police. The suspects fled before stealing anything, but a robbery case was registered. Later the same night, police got information about a burglary at a locked flat in SPS Apartment Society in Sahibabad.The suspects allegedly stole gold, silver and cash before escaping in a white Ertiga.ADCP Piyush Kumar Singh said CCTV footage from multiple locations, along with eyewitness accounts describing seven men, helped investigators establish that the same gang was behind the series of thefts.On Tuesday, a crime branch team arrested four suspects near an underpass close to Sahibabad railway station. They were identified as Roshan Yadav (26), Nimish Aggarwal (34), Raghu Kumar (42), and Aman Saxena (28). During questioning, Aggarwal allegedly told police that he had previously worked as a sales manager at one of the jewellery stores targeted in the break-in, but was later dismissed. He then took up a job at a jewellery showroom in Delhi, from where he allegedly stole ornaments and was jailed. While serving his sentence in Tihar, he came into contact with Raghu Kumar and other associates, police officials said. After he was recently released on bail, he allegedly failed to find work. He regrouped with his fellow inmates and planned the burglaries, police added. Some gold jewellery has been recovered from the accused, and efforts are under way to trace and arrest other gang members.","Four men arrested for a series of burglaries targeting homes and jewellery shops in the city.

Jay Shah’s 2036 Olympic blueprint for India: '8 Medals won’t cut it'

Chennai: Federico Gomez’s journey in competitive tennis has been anything but straightforward. Last year in March, the Argentine spoke in a social media post about battling ‘suicidal thoughts’ and mental health struggles. He found himself rebuilding not just his career but his relationship with the sport itself. Central to that process was the steady presence of Novak Djokovic , whose guidance has helped Gomez rediscover confidence and belief.“I am working a lot on myself. Like I said in the post, last year was not easy. Novak has been helping me a lot, and we have shared many practice sessions together. I am happy with the way I managed to get through that phase and I’m feeling good right now. Being called up to play the Davis Cup (last week) and represent my country for the first time was something that really helped me,” Gomez said after defeating India’s Manish Sureshkumar 6-1, 6-2 in the Chennai Open Challenger first round on Tuesday.“Djokovic kind of told me about his background, maybe not a lot of people know. Everything that he went through and how he managed it. One thing he consistently told me was to find my own way. Obviously, a lot of people will suggest do this or do that or see this person or see that person. But you kind of know what is helping you and what works best for you. I think that really helped me focus on myself, understand what truly helps me, and stick to that,” Gomez, who is currently ranked 196 in the singles ATP chart, added.While the 29-year-old endured a tough time last year, he made it to the main draw of the Grand Slam for the first time. Gomez reached the second round of the French Open as the lucky loser and made it to the US Open first round. “Financially, it (playing in Grand Slams) helped me fund the entire year. At the same time, it allowed me to understand where my level is and what I can build on. I am working hard to raise my level and become more consistent week in and week out. ”Before his mental health struggles, Gomez had to juggle playing tennis and coaching at the Cannas Tennis Academy (run by former Argentine pro Guillermo Canas) in Miami to stay financially afloat. After three years of coaching, he became a full-time professional in October 2022.Despite numerous challenges, Gomez found his way to doing what he loves most: playing tennis.","Federico Gomez beat India's Manish Sureshkumar 6-1, 6-2 in the Chennai Open Challenger first round on Tuesday.

India batters destruct | End of Ishan Kishan vs Sanju Samson

Chennai: New Zealand are showing why they are one of the best teams of the T20 World Cup. After beating Afghanistan easily in the first game, they didn’t put a foot wrong on Tuesday afternoon to take down UAE by 10 wickets in the MA Chidambaram Stadium. With South Africa also in the group, things can get tight later. So, the NRR boost (+1.9) that they got, should stand the Black Caps in good stead going forward.UAE put up a fight with the bat and their second-wicket partnership of 107 runs off 77 balls between Muhammad Waseem (66*, 45balls; 4x4, 6x3) and Alishan Sharafu (55, 47balls; 5x4, 2x6) helped them reach a respectable 173-6. But whatever promise that effort held was swiftly eclipsed by New Zealand openers Tim Seifert (89*, 42balls; 12x4, 3x6) and Finn Allen (84*, 50balls; 5x4, 5x6), who erased the target in 15.2 overs all by themselves.Seifert and Allen lit up Chepauk as the sun dipped at the far end. It was the highest stand for any wicket in a men’s T20 World Cup. Seifert, who continued his rich vein of form with a second successive half-century in the campaign, said the familiarity with Allen made the partnership seamless.“We’ve been with each other way back in the New Zealand academies during the winter, so we’ve known each other for a long time now.It’s nice to open the batting together. We’ve played against each other a lot in domestic cricket and we’re best mates off the field. We just enjoy the cricket, look to put pressure on the bowlers and, most importantly, have fun,” Seifert said after the match.They did exactly that, putting the bowlers under constant ‘pressure’ and leaving them boundary-scorched. The pair began cautiously: the first eight balls of their innings brought four singles and four dot balls. After that, it was complete mayhem, with sixes and fours flowing as New Zealand knocked off 78 runs from the target in the Powerplay itself. While Seifert unfurled a couple of audacious reverse sweeps against the UAE spinners, Allen countered the pace with clean, down-the-ground shots.And fittingly, Seifert closed the show with a towering straight six to cap an evening of pure fireworks that enthralled the 17,000 fans in attendance.Earlier, UAE’s Waseem and Sharafu made the most of the red-soil surface, with the even-paced pitch allowing the ball to come onto the bat nicely. The pair displayed clinical, versatile batting and unfurled a range of strokes, including the occasional eye-pleasing upper cut, to keep the New Zealand bowlers under pressure and expose gaps in their attack.New Zealand’s attempts to wrest back control, including a turn to spin, backfired. Glenn Phillips endured a torrid outing, conceding 27 runs in the 18th over. Though the UAE lost four wickets in the final five overs, they still added 51 runs to post their highest total in T20 World Cup history.Brief scores: UAE 173-6 in 20 overs (M Waseem 66*, A Sharafu 55). New Zealand 175-0 in 15.2 overs (T Seifert 89*, F Allen 84*). NZ won by 10 wickets.",New Zealand beat UAE by 10 wickets in their second T20 World Cup match.

Washington All-Pro Barry Wilburn Dies in House Fire; Cause Under Investigation

The football world is mourning the tragic loss of Barry Wilburn, the former All-Pro defensive back and Super Bowl XXII champion, who passed away on February 6, 2026. Wilburn, a native of Memphis, was 62 years old.The tragedy occurred in the early morning hours in the Orange Mound neighborhood of Memphis. The Memphis Fire Department responded to a house fire at a residence on Douglass Avenue around 2:00 a.m. After battling the blaze, firefighters discovered Wilburn unresponsive in a rear hallway. He was pronounced dead at the scene. While the local community and the NFL have been rocked by the news, the Memphis Fire Department has stated that the official cause of the fire remains under investigation. His identity was confirmed by his family and later by his former team, the Washington Commanders.Wilburn was a standout athlete whose career spanned both the NFL and the CFL. Born in 1963 and the son of Olympic medalist Margaret Matthews Wilburn, he excelled at Ole Miss before being drafted by Washington in 1985.His breakout year came in 1987, a season that cemented his place in football history:He led the NFL with nine interceptions and was named a First-team All-Pro.In Super Bowl XXII, he intercepted Denver Broncos legend John Elway twice, helping Washington to a dominant 42-10 victory. Wilburn is one of a select few players to win both an NFL Super Bowl and a CFL Grey Cup (which he won with the B.C. Lions in 1994).Following the news, the Washington Commanders released a statement expressing deep sadness for the loss of a franchise icon. Former teammates and the Memphis community have remembered him not just as a fierce competitor with ""ball-hawk"" instincts, but as a local role model who inspired younger generations of athletes in his hometown.Wilburn’s legacy is defined by his 20 career regular-season interceptions and his reputation as one of the most reliable cornerbacks of his era. He is survived by his family, including his children, Jordan and Dominique.",Washington All-Pro Barry Wilburn Dies in House Fire; Cause Under Investigation.

Why Edmonton Oilers' complacency, defensive struggles and roster composition fuel concerns for its future



OILERS MIC'D UP | Episode 42

Why Have The Edmonton Oilers Been So Bad? | SDP

As the Edmonton Oilers' NHL season is off to an unimpressive start, the team is coming under heavy fire, with even a respected insider such as Frank Seravalli fairly dismissing the Edmonton Oilers as a team that is failing to achieve their aspirations of a coveted Stanley Cup, as he explained to Oilers Now with Bob Stauffer.With only 28 wins thus far in 58 games, presently sitting out of the league’s elite club, the Oilers are likely on pace to finish the season with 91 points, a figure that may or may not guarantee a postseason spot. As Frank Seravalli wrote, the very indecision to which he drew attention is, in itself, reason enough to be pressing on, rather than to latch on to it reassuringly, as some have. He warned that being in a dangerous frame of mind is particularly dangerous in the NHL.Apparently, there’s a growing level of complacency that has trickled down from the dressing room to the coaching staff and even into the fan base, and that’s according to Frank Seravalli, as the Oilers have become accustomed to winning Stanley Cup Final appearances over recent years.The insider surmised that the team seems to be holding on to the idea of an external solution, whether in terms of a trade deadline deal or an impetus from beyond the bench.However, he also wants to stress that ""the status quo is not an option when you are 19th in the overall standings and a claimant to a championship.""In terms of defensive strategies, Seravalli did not hold back. He pointed to Darnell Nurse as a problem. Seravalli explained that for a defender to be making $9.25 million yearly, he should be a major factor, not a hindrance. Rather, he said that many times the Oilers are forced to go out and win games in spite of Nurse's play, rather than because of his play.Seravalli identified the fractured nature of the forward contingent and the chasm that exists between the top six and bottom six forwards in the NHL. Players in the bottom six are fighting for ice time, while those in the top six feel they are being asked to do it all alone.Ultimately, however, in the view of Seravalli, what is likely to be the Oilers' biggest problem is simply that they do not have that critical sense of urgency. Until they do, their hopes of capturing another Stanley Cup trophy seem much weaker than anyone might imagine.","The Edmonton Oilers are currently 19th in the NHL standings. The team is off to a poor start this season, with 28 wins in 58 games. Frank Seravalli believes that the team's biggest problem is that they do not have a sense of urgency. He also pointed to the fractured nature of the forward contingent.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128153589,imgsize-46954,width-400,resizemode-4/edmonton-oilers.jpg"

Sidney Crosby of Team Canada's security incident during Winter Olympics media session



An off-ice situation at the 2026 Winter Olympics involved a bizarre encounter by Team Canada Winter Olympics captain Sidney Crosby as he was approached in the middle of a media engagement. The NHL 's most recognizable star, the captain of the Pittsburgh Penguins, was reported to have met an unknown who breached an exclusive area of the media, which right away raised eyebrows of both the journalists and the event personnel.Although the person may have been a fan who only wanted an autograph as opposed to a person with bad motives, this has brought controversy in NHL updates, as well as the discussion on the Olympics in general. Elite sport events involve high-profile security operations, and any small failure is likely to attract attention to the possibilities of such failures, and the organizers may need to take remedial actions within a short period.Reports were doing rounds in NHL news roundup coverage that the individual was in the media pool without being properly accredited, and it is then questionable how the access checkpoints were breached in the course of the session.The media members immediately intervened and drove the person away before the situation got out of hand, and Sidney Crosby was saved.Crosby was able to take the sudden turn with calmness and displayed the same composure that he has shown over the years in his life and as a player in the NHL with the Pittsburgh Penguins. Nevertheless, according to the analysts, security gaps should not be compensated for through the athlete's professionalism. Such accidents are just a reminder that international competitions should be under strict security provisions, particularly when the world superstars, such as Crosby, are given all the attention they receive from fans and journalists.",Sidney Crosby met an unknown who breached an exclusive area of the media.

Travis Kelce seems to be worried about Taylor Swift

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce publicly distanced themselves from the pop star’s former best friend, Blake Lively, and her husband, popular Hollywood actor, Ryan Reynolds, ever since their legal drama with Justin Baldoni began.While Taylor Swift could be called to court after her controversial text exchange with Blake Lively was made public, it seems Travis Kelce was never fond of their company.A few hours ago, as per Rob Shuter, a source revealed that, “He hated the double-dating…He felt like it was all optics and no authenticity.”The source added, “Travis is blunt and real…Ryan is curated. That contrast never worked.”Just two months before Taylor Swift was dragged in the legal chaos between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni, the pop star and Travis Kelce were spotted on a double date with the Hollywood power couple.That was the last time either Taylor Swift or Travis Kelce were spotted alongside Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds. The two have remained publicly distant from the Hollywood power couple ever since.Around a year ago, there were also strong speculations of Travis Kelce removing Ryan Reynolds from his social media.But neither Travis Kelce nor Ryan Reynolds addressed the speculations in public.While Taylor Swift remains private about her emotions about the situation, it seems Travis Kelce is pretty concerned about her and his future in the league after a pretty poor season on the field.According to The U.S. Sun, a source has said, ""Between a difficult season, the reality of preparing for retirement—which has left him stressed and a bit depressed…”The insider added, “And the looming possibility of Taylor being called to court as a witness, it's been emotionally exhausting and increasingly frustrating for him to handle.""This has also led to many insiders claiming that Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have decided to put their “wedding on hold” until they are able to deal with the issues in their lives.However, both Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have stayed away from confirming these speculations in public.",Travis Kelce reportedly felt awkward and forced during outings with Taylor Swift’s former friend Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds.

Rare Mercedes supercar badly damaged in incident

Pre-season plans for Andrea Kimi Antonelli remain unchanged

Formula 1 prospect Andrea Kimi Antonelli was involved in a scary car accident over the weekend when his high-performance Mercedes AMG GT crashed into a roadside barrier close to his home in San Marino. The 19-year-old, seen as one of modern motorsport's preeminent talents, escaped from the crash unscathed. A team spokesperson confirmed that Antonelli was the only person in the car at the time and that no other cars were involved in the accident.Antonelli was just days away from participating in key pre-season testing alongside the Mercedes Formula 1 squad when the accident occurred.
