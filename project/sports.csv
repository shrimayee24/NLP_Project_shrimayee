Mike Hesson on India's handshake snub: 'We were disappointed that our opposition didn't do that'

NEW DELHI: India’s commanding seven-wicket victory over Pakistan in the Asia Cup on Sunday may have looked routine on the scoreboard, but the aftermath turned the Dubai International Stadium into the stage of a diplomatic drama. Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha refused to attend the post-match presentation ceremony in protest after Indian players declined to shake hands, an incident now at the centre of what many are calling “handshake-gate.”The flashpoint unfolded moments after India captain Suryakumar Yadav sealed the match with a towering six. Instead of waiting to exchange the customary handshakes with his opponents, Suryakumar shook hands only with batting partner Shivam Dube before leading his teammates straight into the dressing room. Within seconds, India’s support staff shut the door, leaving Pakistan’s players stranded in the middle of the ground.Pakistan head coach Mike Hesson expressed frustration at the snub. “We were ready to shake hands at the end of the game. We are disappointed that the opposition did not do that. We went over there and they were already gone to the changing room, so that was obviously a disappointing way to finish the match,” he told reporters.The Pakistani players lingered on the field for a couple of minutes before retreating. Hesson, visibly agitated, rushed towards India’s dressing room, only to find the doors locked. He was later spotted in a tense conversation with match referee Andy Pycroft. In solidarity with his team, captain Salman Ali Agha chose not to appear at the post-match presentation, leaving broadcasters scrambling.Pakistan’s team management confirmed their protest in a statement. “The behaviour of Indian players was against the spirit of sportsmanship. That is why skipper (Salman) Agha was not sent to the post-match ceremony,” it read.India, however, stood firm. At his press conference, skipper Suryakumar Yadav said: “The team was aligned with the government and Board of Control for Cricket in India in not shaking hands with the Pakistan team. We stand with the victims and families of the Pahalgam terror attack and we express our solidarity. We want to dedicate today’s win to the armed forces.”The political overtones were impossible to ignore. The match was the first between the neighbours since a military conflict in May. That escalation followed an April terror attack in Pahalgam, Kashmir, which India accused Pakistan of supporting.While India’s spinners and Suryakumar’s unbeaten 47 scripted a dominant on-field win, the real talking point was India's refusal to shake hands after the match and Pakistan’s captain protesting in silence — by refusing to show up at the presentation, amplifying the rift that cricket could not bridge.",India captain Suryakumar Yadav refused to shake hands with Pakistan players.

Suryakumar Yadav's Instagram post

Despite being a one-sided contest filled with standout individual performances, the India–Pakistan clash at the Dubai International Stadium may still go down as the tournament’s most talked-about game — but for reasons beyond cricket.By Monday morning, the ‘handshake-gate’ will dominate the popular narrative on social media feeds and airwaves, and be a hot topic of conversation at water coolers and coffee machines in schools and offices.The cast of characters — Team India captain Suryakumar Yadav , his counterpart Salman Ali Agha, Pakistan head coach Mike Hesson, and match referee Andy Pycroft — were all involved in the drama.As is cricket’s longstanding tradition, the players usually “shake hands and make up” after the game. They do it for the sake of sportsmanship.However, the Indian cricket players were not in a mood to forgive and forget, and instead took a stand for all the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack Team India captain Suryakumar Yadav posted on Instagram: ""This win is dedicated to the armed forces of India and the victims of the Pahalgam attack. Jai Hind.""Surya's deputy Shubman Gill echoed his skipper's sentiments. He wrote on Instagram: ""Today’s win is dedicated to the victims of Pahalgam and to our brave armed forces who continue to safeguard us.The spirit of India lives on both on and off the field. Jai Hind.""Interestingly, at the start of the tournament, Team India captain Suryakumar Yadav, during the captains’ press conference, shook hands with Mohsin Naqvi, chief of the Asian Cricket Council (ACC), president of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), and also Pakistan's Federal Interior Minister. But he refused to shake hands with his counterpart Salman Ali Agha — first at the toss and later at the end of the match.Suryakumar hit the winning six to finish the game, walked towards batting partner Shivam Dube, shook his hand, and then walked off, leaving the Pakistani players in the middle of the ground.The Pakistan team, led by Salman Ali Agha, stood in the middle for a couple of minutes before starting to walk back to their dressing room.Seeing his players head back, Pakistan coach Mike Hesson raced towards Team India’s dressing room, but by then the doors were shut.A visibly upset Hesson was seen having a long conversation with match referee Andy Pycroft. After standing there for four to five minutes, a frustrated Hesson walked back towards the pitch.In response, Salman Ali Agha skipped the post-match presentation in protest against the behaviour of the Indian team, as the ceremony host was also an Indian — former India captain and coach Ravi Shastri.India captain Suryakumar Yadav defended the snub in his post-match press conference, saying that the team was ""aligned with the government and the Board of Control for Cricket in India"" in not shaking hands with the Pakistan team.""We stand with the victims and families of the Pahalgam terror attack and we express our solidarity,"" Suryakumar said. ""We want to dedicate today's win to the armed forces.""Pakistan's head coach Mike Hesson told reporters he was ""disappointed"" with the Indian team's decision.""We were ready to shake hands at the end of the game,"" the former Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) coach said.""We are disappointed that the opposition did not do that. We went over there and they had already gone to the changing room, so that was obviously a disappointing way to finish the match.""Team India head coach, while talking to the broadcasters, hailed the team’s stand.“The match was important for us because as a team we wanted to show our solidarity to the families of the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack, for everything they have gone through. More importantly, we want to thank our armed forces for their successful Operation Sindoor, and I’m sure we will try and make our country proud and happy,” Gambhir told Sony Sports Network.It was the first time that the arch-rivals faced off in a cricket match since the Pahalgam terror attacks earlier this year in April.TimesofIndia.com had reported that the boycott trend on social media was discussed by the players in the team meeting, which was later confirmed by assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate at the press conference.""We obviously are aware of the sentiments and the strong feelings. And Gauti’s (coach Gautam Gambhir ’s) message has just been very professional, about not worrying about things that are not in our control,” he had said.However, at the end of the game Team India players didn’t take their coach's advice of being ""professional"" to heart and instead did the opposite.And yes, India did win the match comprehensively by seven wickets and cemented their place in the Super Four, where they might again face Pakistan.",Team India captain Suryakumar Yadav refused to shake hands with Pakistan's Salman Ali Agha at the toss and at the end of the match.

Mystery of Agatha Christie's India story finally solved,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mystery-of-agatha-christies-india-story-finally-solved/articleshow/123877784.cms,"Agatha Christie autographs copies of her books

WHY DIDN’T THEY ASK MATHEW? There was constant speculation over whether Agatha Christie ever came to India, but never any proof, even though she was known to be an avid traveller. Now, her grandson tells writer Manjiri Prabhu that she definitely had visited — not once, but twice

Mathew Prichard (also in photo right), who’s settled the India question once and for all, with his grandmother Agatha Christie

The following are extracts from two letters that Christie wrote to Edmund Cork in Cyprus, her literary agent and lifelong friend.

Jan 11, 1960 |

Jan 20, 1960 |

Another letter was from Christie, then staying at the Ashoka Hotel in New Delhi, to Rosalind, her daughter.

Feb 16, 1960 |

Oct 30, 1961 |

From Delhi, she wrote again to Rosalind.

Some mysteries need to be actively cracked, but some solve themselves with time.There has been constant speculation about Agatha Christie’s India connection. One question has recurred over the years, but has never really been accurately answered: did Agatha Christie ever visit India? The internet and popular belief will state that she did not. I, too, had often puzzled over how Christie, a world traveller, had never actually been to India. In fact, in a video in 2021, I had even concluded that she indeed hadn’t.Until one cool but sunny Easter day in Wales.In March 2024, I met Christie’s grandson, Mathew Prichard, and his lovely wife Lucy, at their charming home in Wales. Prichard, now in his 80s, had been very close to his grandmother.It was a memorable day, but it turned momentous when Mathew showed me Christie’s personal memorabilia — her passports, her first typed and edited manuscripts, rare photos, her camera, and her last portrait painting, which hung on one of the walls of his house.When Mathew signed and gifted me a copy of his grandmother’s latest biography, I also realised what a mammoth task he had been entrusted with — to preserve her legacy, and how he had upheld that trust: a proud grandson of the Queen of Crime.It was when I mentioned how strange it was that Christie had never visited India, that he glanced at me with a twinkle in his blue eyes, and said, “Oh, but she did!” I was startled. This was contrary to all that we believed. A few minutes later, as I skimmed through the numerous black-and-white, well-preserved photos, I found some that made my heart race — pictures of Christie with a garland, descending from an Indian Airlines plane. Here, finally, was the missing link to a long-standing puzzle.I was on the threshold of solving a real mystery, but I needed to know more. At my request, the archivist Joseph Keogh dug deeper and came up with some fascinating, unpublicised facts. Christie had indeed visited India — not once, but twice. From her passport stamps, he traced her travel itinerary for the two trips.Her first trip was in Jan 1960, when she visited Ceylon (present-day Sri Lanka), then India and Pakistan. From Jan 11 to Feb 2, she travelled to Bombay (now Mumbai), headed to South India’s Madras (now Chennai), did some sightseeing at the Ajanta Caves, and then on to Delhi. Between Feb 2 and 9, she went to Nepal and returned to Patna and Delhi, finally leaving for Karachi on Feb 17.Some letters were also found that referenced her trips. It appeared that the 1960 trip was for a lecture tour by her second husband, the archaeologist Max Mallowan.Future plans are, roughly, leave for Madras today — go via southern India to Bombay arriving 17th or 18th — Then some sightseeing near Bombay Agenta Caves (sic) etc and on to Delhi and then to Nepal on Jan 31st for a week — c/o British Embassy would find us there as I’m not sure what the hotel is.Our plans are a bit different at the moment as accommodation at hotels is very hard to get exactly when one wants it but we shall be in and out of the Ashoka Hotel at Delhi between Jan 28th and Feb 2nd — and then Nepal (c/o British Embassy Kathmandu) 2nd to 9th then in and out of Ashoka again finally leaving it on Feb 17th for Karachi. So forward anything you think I ought to see to the Ashoka at Delhi — but nothing that I needn’t!!On our arrival here yesterday evening, several archaeologists were waiting with two porters and loads of archaeological material from their… dig. The examination of same intrigued the Ashoka guests very much.Christie’s second trip to India, a year later, seemed to be for leisure. The passport has a Palam, New Delhi stamp (month not specified) in 1961. This time she visited Srinagar in Kashmir and stayed at the Oberoi Palace. This is what she wrote to her daughter Rosalind:Lake and mountains rather lovely. This is a Hotel rather like at Jaipur — converted Rajah’s Palace — miles and miles of corridors — enormous rooms and we are in a kind of supersuite looking over lake. It’s all terribly dried up by this time of year — one ought really to come in May-June. Now one must be content by rich beds of red salvia and dahlias in the Hotel garden. Temp is about 50 at night. Delicious hot sun to sit in and about 60 in day. Suits me very well. We made some excursions — to the various Mogul gardens — and to a lake… which is very beautiful and ringed with snowclad mountains. You can see the mountains now after the rain. We have to leave here and go to the Hotel in the town — but expect that our booking for Nov 2nd to Delhi will be all right.Here we are in the Ashoka. I’m glad we had a good ten days and in a perfect Hotel for old ladies (very few of them nowadays) where I could sit, in the sun — and look at a view like a Japanese print. Lovely! The letters revealed Christie’s bright, chirpy personality and tongue-in-cheek humour, her eagerness to explore India and her appreciation of scenic beauty. She seemed happy to be in India.But I pondered why her trips were not well-known. Was it because photographs were a rarity then or because she checked into the hotels in her husband’s name — or perhaps simply because Agatha Christie was a private person?Whatever the reason, I was thrilled with my discovery. That sunny day with Mathew, Lucy and Gwynnie the dog carried an extra fulfilling zing because of this exciting revelation.I had always sensed a deep connection to Agatha Christie. But being the chosen one to unravel the mystery of her India trips felt truly special.The author is an award-winning writer of mystery novels[Extracts and photographs used with permission from Mathew Prichard and The Christie Archive Trust.

Sidney Crosby and the trade whispers



What the future holds for Sidney Crosby



For nearly two decades, Sidney Crosby has been the face of the Pittsburgh Penguins, but reports suggest the bond may finally be fraying. The franchise’s timeline no longer matches the ambitions of its captain, raising speculation that the three-time Stanley Cup champion could consider life outside the Black and Yellow. While nothing appears imminent, insiders believe this is the closest Crosby has ever come to pondering a future away from Pittsburgh.The thought of Crosby leaving Pittsburgh once felt impossible. Yet cracks are beginning to show. “I never thought a Crosby trade was imaginable. Now, I’m not so sure,” wrote The Athletic’s Josh Yohe, pointing to growing frustration with the Penguins’ struggles.The Penguins, built on an aging core, no longer look like a contender. Meanwhile, the NHL is watching closely, knowing that if Crosby ever gives the green light, a bidding war would erupt. Among potential destinations, the Montreal Canadiens stand out. Elliotte Friedman revealed on his 32 Thoughts Podcast that Montreal’s front office may already be shaping decisions with Crosby in mind, saying, “[Canadiens’] Jeff Gorton and Kent Hughes are they sitting there and saying ‘we’re not doing anything with X player because we think it may prevent us from doing a Crosby deal‘.Montreal not only offers Crosby a shot at fulfilling his childhood dream but also the chance to mentor a young core hungry for playoff success. A move north would instantly inject leadership and championship pedigree into a team still learning to win.Despite the noise, a trade remains unlikely before the 2025-26 season. Crosby reportedly wants to finish this year alongside Evgeni Malkin, honoring their shared legacy in Pittsburgh. At the same time, distractions from a move to a market like Montreal could pull focus away from his primary goal: representing Canada at the 2026 Winter Olympics.The decision, whenever it comes, will not be taken lightly. Crosby has built his career on loyalty and excellence, but time is not on his side. The choice may eventually come down to chasing a final Stanley Cup or staying with the team that defined his career. Either way, when Sidney Crosby makes his move, the NHL will never look the same.Also Read: Oilers GM addresses Connor McDavid contract uncertainty, urges fans to avoid panic while stressing team’s championship priorities",Sidney Crosby has been the face of the Pittsburgh Penguins for nearly two decades.

KaVontae Turpin shines before injury scare



KaVontae Turpin remains vital to Cowboys game plan



The Dallas Cowboys breathed a sigh of relief after their nail-biting 40-37 overtime win against the New York Giants in Week 2. Wide receiver and return specialist KaVontae Turpin, who left the field with a scary neck injury, now appears to have avoided serious damage. Early reports from the team point toward encouraging signs, easing the concerns of both fans and teammates.Turpin’s impact was felt long before he exited the game. On a second-half kickoff return, he went down awkwardly, sparking immediate worry. Yet his numbers on the day spoke volumes about his importance. The explosive wideout piled up 157 all-purpose yards, including four catches for 47 yards, two carries for six yards, and an impressive 102 kick return yards. He also found the end zone, a key contribution in helping Dallas bounce back from their Week 1 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles.Offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer delivered a reassuring update after tests were conducted, telling reporters, “Sounds like most of the tests have come back pretty clear.” Those words provide the Cowboys not only relief but also momentum as they prepare for their next matchup against the Chicago Bears.A two-time Pro Bowler, Turpin brings a rare blend of speed and versatility that transforms Dallas’ offense and special teams. Whether stretching the field as a receiver or flipping momentum with electric returns, he is a player opposing defenses and coverage units must account for. His presence also offers stability for quarterback Dak Prescott, who benefits from the field position and explosive options Turpin creates.As the Cowboys eye Week 3, his potential availability changes the outlook. Injury scares often shape the tone of a season, but in this case, the news fuels optimism rather than setback. For now, it seems Dallas avoided a major blow, and Turpin remains a key weapon in their push to stay competitive in a loaded NFC.Also Read: Brittany Mahomes’ fiery red crop top look goes viral as baby Sterling enjoys her Arrowhead Chiefs debut","Dallas Cowboys wide receiver KaVontae Turpin suffered a neck injury against the New York Giants in Week 2.

Strategic Implications of this Golden State Warriors Trade

Theare reportedly considering a blockbuster trade for., a move that could reshape the Western Conference landscape. With Stephen Curry entering the final stages of his career, the Warriors are weighing bold risks to extend their championship window, while Memphis faces a transitional phase after trading Desmond Bane to the Orlando Magic.Golden State is preparing a significant offer built around its young talent and draft assets. The proposed package may include Jonathan Kuminga, Moses Moody, and three future first-round draft picks (2026, 2029, 2031). Pick swaps and the inclusion of Brandin Podziemski have also been floated.A sign-and-trade involving Kuminga’s new contract could help the Warriors navigate salary cap challenges while keeping core veterans like Draymond Green and Jimmy Butler. For Memphis, this package would align with its decision to pivot after moving Bane, centering the roster around Ja Morant and opening financial flexibility.Landing Jaren Jackson Jr. gives the Golden State Warriors a 25-year-old Defensive Player of the Year and former All-Star who averages over 20 points per game while shooting 37.5% from deep. His versatility on defense complements Draymond Green, while offensively, he provides another reliable scorer next to Curry and Butler.Financially, Jackson’s $35 million cap hit for 2025-26 is manageable, making the deal feasible without destabilizing the roster. Most importantly, the Golden State Warriors inject youth and athleticism into a veteran core that remains focused on winning now.For Jaren Jackson Jr., the move could mean stepping into a title-contending environment filled with championship pedigree. Playing alongside Curry in a system built on ball movement and spacing might elevate his offensive game.Relocating to the Bay Area also enhances his visibility and marketability. However, the adjustment comes with challenges: sharing the spotlight with established stars and shouldering expectations in one of the league’s most scrutinized markets.Memphis would gain significant draft capital and promising players to reshape the roster around Ja Morant. Moving Jackson frees up long-term salary obligations and provides flexibility for future roster adjustments.The Grizzlies’ decision would be risky, as parting ways with a Defensive Player of the Year-level player is never easy. Still, it may represent a necessary step in refreshing their trajectory after falling short of playoff breakthroughs.• For Warriors: Elite defensive upgrade, proven scorer, long-term fit alongside Curry, Butler, and Green.• For Jackson: Chance to compete for a championship, offensive development in Warriors’ system, bigger market exposure.• For Grizzlies: Draft picks for rebuilding, salary relief, roster flexibility, commitment to Morant’s leadership.• For Warriors: Loss of promising young players and multiple future first-rounders could hurt long-term flexibility.• For Jackson: New pressures in a high-stakes market, role adjustment next to multiple stars.• For Grizzlies: Losing a cornerstone defensive star, uncertainty if draft assets translate into success.Jackson recently signed a five-year, $240 million max extension starting next season. Despite the size of the deal, his 2025-26 cap figure is relatively modest at $35 million. This makes the trade workable for Golden State without creating immediate financial strain. For Memphis, the deal provides long-term relief and strategic flexibility.This potential trade captures the delicate balance between present-day contention and future building. Golden State’s willingness to part with young assets and picks reflects urgency to maximize Curry’s remaining prime years. Memphis, meanwhile, appears ready to prioritize long-term sustainability, even at the cost of losing one of its brightest young stars.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers Predicted to Land $240 Million Utah Jazz Superstar to Support LeBron James and Luka Doncic in Title Push If finalized, this deal could become one of the defining moves of the 2025-26 season.

Bucs’ offensive and defensive starters hit with injuries

Baker Mayfield’s condition leaves Bucs in uncertainty



Tampa Bay’s injury troubles are mounting fast in their early-season matchup, raising serious concerns for the team’s playoff hopes. In what should have been a strategic battle, the Buccaneers are now scrambling to stay competitive as injuries pile up before halftime.Right tackle Luke Goedeke was the first to leave the field after suffering a foot injury, forcing Tampa Bay to adjust their offensive line on the fly. Losing a key blocker so early puts immense pressure on quarterback Baker Mayfield, whose mobility and pocket protection are already tested.The defensive front also took a hit. Calijah Kancey, one of the team’s most promising defensive linemen, was seen being evaluated after a pectoral injury. His presence in stopping the run and pressuring the quarterback has been a bright spot for the Bucs this season, and his potential absence could weaken an already struggling defensive line.Most alarming was Baker Mayfield appearing to hold his knee after taking a brutal sack from Danielle Hunter. Mayfield has shown resilience this season, but repeated hits have raised questions about his durability. His ability to continue in the second half is uncertain, and the Bucs’ offensive rhythm heavily depends on his leadership.Head coach Todd Bowles and his staff now face the challenge of making swift halftime adjustments. “We’re going to see what we can do. We’ll make the necessary moves to stay competitive,” Bowles remarked.Also Read: Dallas Cowboys WR KaVontae Turpin escapes major setback with positive news after scary neck injury With the game still a toss-up, the Buccaneers must rally to overcome this injury onslaught if they hope to secure a win.

This influence sparks debates among fans, altering the game-day experience with visible displays of support and contrasting views on political neutrality in sports. The NFL now reflects America's broader cultural divisions.

Why Charlie Kirk’s voice resonates with specific NFL fan groups

How this political influence is changing the game-day experience

In 2025, the NFL has become far more than just a sports league—it’s a powerful cultural battleground. Conservative commentator Charlie Kirk has emerged as a key figure influencing fan behavior, social media conversations, and the overall atmosphere at NFL games. His messages of patriotism, tradition, and opposition to ""woke culture"" are finding an audience among certain segments of NFL fans, while stirring controversy in others.Charlie Kirk’s emphasis on American pride, family values, and tradition strongly appeals to older generations, rural and suburban fans, and military or veteran supporters. These fans often view football Sunday as a celebration of community and national identity.Kirk’s followers are not shy about displaying their support—many bring signs echoing his language, stand louder during the national anthem, or share his clips on social media. One notable fan behavior in 2025 includes more vigorous patriotic chants and wearing merchandise featuring Kirk’s slogans during games.However, the reaction isn’t universal. Younger, progressive NFL fans argue that the league should focus solely on the sport, not politics.“Sports should remain neutral,” many of these fans argue online, calling for players’ skills and performance to take center stage instead of political narratives. Social media now serves as a virtual stadium where Kirk’s views are shared alongside game highlights, often sparking fierce debates in the comments of NFL posts.The political divide extends into the stadium experience itself. Some fans see anthem ceremonies and military tributes as unifying moments, while others view them as politicized distractions. Coaches and players are not immune either, often mediating tensions in locker rooms caused by the growing cultural divide. As a result, the NFL increasingly reflects the broader cultural wars shaping America today.Also Read: Which NFL stadium is hosting Charlie Kirk’s public funeral service and what makes it significant Going forward, the NFL faces a critical decision: embrace this politicized identity or risk alienating fans seeking a pure sports experience.","Conservative commentator Charlie Kirk has emerged as a key figure influencing fan behavior, social media conversations, and the overall atmosphere at NFL games.

Sourav Ganguly makes honest confession: 'I stopped watching India vs Pakistan after just 15 overs',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/asia-cup/sourav-ganguly-makes-honest-confession-i-stopped-watching-india-vs-pakistan-after-just-15-overs/articleshow/123905361.cms,"Sourav Ganguly (PTI Photo)

India’s Handshake Snub at Asia Cup Leaves Pakistan in Full Meltdown, ICC Dragged Into Drama

Former India captain Sourav Ganguly had little patience for Sunday’s Asia Cup clash between India and Pakistan in Dubai, admitting that the one-sided nature of the contest made him switch channels to football’s Manchester derby.“I am actually not surprised by what I saw. I actually stopped watching after the first 15 overs and started watching Manchester United and Man City (in English Premier League),” Ganguly quipped on Monday.India cruised to a seven-wicket victory over Pakistan, extending a decade-long dominance.But the post-match buzz was dominated by controversy after Indian players collectively refused to shake hands with their opponents as a mark of solidarity with victims of the Pahalgam terror attack . Pakistan later lodged a formal complaint with the ICC, terming the act “unsporting.”Ganguly side-stepped the handshake debate but made his position clear on the bigger picture.“Terror must stop, that's most important, all around the world, not just India and Pakistan. You've seen so many things happening, so that also must stop. But sports also cannot stop. Terror has to stop all around the world,” he said.Asked about the players’ actions, he deferred responsibility.“You will have to ask Suryakumar Yadav, he has to answer. I'm too far, launching my ethnic brand.He's also answered it... Everyone has their own side of the story, that's what it is,” Ganguly remarked.On the cricketing side, the former BCCI president was blunt about Pakistan’s decline.“Pakistan are no match. I say that with respect, it's just because I've seen their team was. It's the lack of quality in the side,” he said.For Ganguly, the India–Pakistan hype no longer matches reality.“There is no competition… I would rather watch India play Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, England, Sri Lanka or even Afghanistan. I don’t think India and Pakistan are a contest anymore. We keep hyping it and for the last five years every hype has been shattered. It’s been one-way traffic,” he concluded.","Sourav Ganguly says he stopped watching India-Pakistan Asia Cup clash after 15 overs.

The Monday Night RAW edition of Sep 15 is the last one before WWE 's next PPV, Wrestlepalooza 2025. The show went live from MassMutual Center in Springfield, Massachusetts, with quite a few stars appearing tonight before they take center stage at the big event in Indianapolis on September 20. From John Cena showing up to AJ Lee and CM Punk confronting Becky Lynch and Seth Rollins before their big matches, tonight was already expected to be action-packed. And the promotion did not disappoint, as they gave the fans a night to remember.After a chaotic start to the show where fans saw LA Knight jump Jey Uso, and the referees and RAW General Manager Adam Pearce having to get involved, the show finally started with John Cena getting to the stage. He made his usual iconic entry, this time in his home state, where he spoke of how he spent a lot of time playing football down the street at Springfield College. He also mentioned that it was his niece's, and wished her on her special day.He inevitably mentions Brock Lesnar, who he is set to face at Wrestlepalooza. The crowd keeps cheering him on, and Cena says although he could have rejected the match against Lesnar after he showed up twice to knock him out, the only reason he didn't was the fans. He’s only got six appearances left in WWE, he is not going to give up and back out. He ends his segment with a simple message to Lesnar, if you want some, come and get some.Backstage, Jey Uso and LA Knight are in Adam Pearce’s office, where the RAW GM asks them what he needs to do to keep the peace. Knight says he wants a tag team match partnering with Jimmy Uso, to take on Bron Breakker and Bronson Reed. Jey is not happy, but there's nothing he can do about it.The first match of the night is between Lyra Valkyria and The Judgment Day member, Roxanne Perez. Both women square off right away, and it's pretty evenly matched. After a nearfall, Valkyria gets under Perez for a Fireman’s carry, and finally takes her out with a Nightwing for the pin and win.Of course, it's the Judgment Day, so Raquel Rodriguez comes in right after to attack Valkyria. But then, none other than Bayley runs in to make the save. After taking out both the tag team partners, she turns to face Valkyria, who looks a little scared and moves away. Bayley then does a switch and gets out of the ring to hug everyone - from the commentators to the referee to the ring announcer to some random guy in the audience to a crewmember in a Metallica T-shirt.Backstage, Adam Pearce is with IYO SKY and Stephanie Vaquer, where both women have signed their contract for their upcoming match at Wrestlepalooza. They'll be competing for the vacant WWE Women’s World Championship, and both women politely shake hands.Asuka suddenly shows up out of nowhere with Kairi Sane, where she squares off against Vaquer and challenges her to fight Kairi Sane, who looks confused for a second, but agrees. Pearce makes it official.Elsewhere, LA Knight finds Jimmy Uso, who is not too happy with Knight wanting to partner with him, especially because of his issues with Jey. Knight says he chose Jim because unlike his brother, he had his back, and trusts him, but this is putting Big Jim in a tough spot. Uso says that they are already set to face the Bron's at Wrestlepalooza, so Knight needs to find someone else for tonight.New Day, alongside Grayson Waller, shows up for Kofi Kingston's fight against Penta. Kingston has help from his team, including Waller but Penta is like a one-man army, ready to take out anyone in his path. Waller tries to taunt Penta, and instead gets slapped for his troubles. Xavier Woods runs interference, as does Waller, but Penta is not one to be fazed by any of that. He finally goes for a springboard flip piledriver to take out Kingston for the win.Backstage, Jimmy rolls up to his brother Jey, who is talking on the phone. The former asks who he was talking to, but the latter budges, instead saying if LA Knight asks him to partner up, he has to say no. Jimmy gets put off about being ordered around, and says he had already said no, but he is not taking orders from anyone. Jimmy tells him to change his tone, because he is not the Tribal Chief, and storms off. Next we see him with Knight and asking if he still needed a partner. Knight says he doesn't want to put him in a spot, but Jimmy says he is ready. We have a tag team match set for tonight!The next segment starts with Seth Rollins and Becky Lynch making their entrance, wearing matching black leather outfits. The crowd chants ""CM Punk"" upsetting Rollins, but he brushes it off to introduce WWE's Intercontinental Champion - the Man - Becky Lynch. Lynch says a few words about saying everything to the face before AJ Lee and CM Punk, also dressed in matching set - blue jeans and AJ’s merch, make their entrance.It's a lot of words and a little action. The segment goes for a while, as both couples brag about their significant other and talk down on their opponents. At one point, Lee slaps Rollins, who looks shocked and looks at Lynch to take care of the problem. But Lynch doesn't seem to be on the same page and storms off the ring.Rollins then piefaces Punk and bails for the latter to chase him. Lynch, who everyone thought had left, Lynch slides back in and hits the Manhandle Slam on Lee. She then slaps Punk across the face a few times before running off to her husband, while Punk checks on his wife to make sure she is okay.Backstage, a newly-crowned AAA Mega Champion Dominik Mysterio is getting interviewed after the Worlds Collide show. He talks about him and El Grande Americano, and calls himself the Mega Intercontinental Champion. But his interview is cut short when a fight breaks out. The camera turns to see the New Day going off on Penta with a steel chair after their loss. The War Raiders arrive to check on their friend, who looks to be in a bad shape.Dragon Lee looks ready for El Grande Americano as soon as the fight starts. He has control over the fight, but soon, El Grande Americano 2 enters the stage. AJ Styles arrives to help out Lee, against the two, but then a third man with the El Grande mask shows up to take out Styles. 3 runs interference aa 2 knocks Lee off the turnbuckles, while 1 grabs their opponent with a Steiner Recliner to take the win.After the match, El Grande Americano 1, 2, and 3 have a pointing Spider-Man moment with each other.Lyra Valkyrie goes to thank Bayley for helping her out against the Judgment Day duo tonight, but gets chewed out by Bayley instead. Next we see Rhea Ripley come up to Stephanie Vaquer, and tell her, whether it's her ir IYO SKY who wins the title at Wrestlepalooza, she is coming for it.Kairi Sane and Stephanie Vaquer show off inside the ring as both women go after each other with power. The two look on par with each other as they trade blows one after the other - with one sometimes outpowering the other, only for things to take a turn for the opposite side. It's Kabuki Warriors next, as Asuka tries to help Sane, but Vaquer is able to take them both out. Vaquer then finally goes for her special Sliced Bread to take out Sabe for good.After the match, Asuka runs in to confront Vaquer, but IYO SKY shows up to stop her. They argue in Japanese before Asuka storms off. Vaquer looks on with a smile and SKY offers a hand, as both women shake ahead of their match for the vacant title.Backstage Asuka yells at IYO SKY who says she needs to face Vaquer on her own, without anyone's help. Asuka eventually fires off a ""fine but you’re not gonna win” and storms off, and Kairi Sane is left to stumble after her.In the Judgment Day clubhouse, the members are toasting to Dominik Mysterio - now a double champion. Balor tries to ask him about El Grande Americano, but Dom brushes them off. Rusev then shows up and introduces himself but Dominik, who doesn't shake his hands. The former then says he is the next Intercontinental Champion and walks off.Jimmy Uso and Bron Breakker start the match, but soon it's a tag to Knight, as he uses all his power to overcome his opponent. Next tag goes to Reed, and it's one after the other as the four of them square off. At the end, Bronson Reed then goes for the running Death Valley Driver on Jim Uso, to pin him for the win.After the match, Breakker and Reed try to take out Jimmy before their upcoming match at Wrestlepalooza, but Jey Uso runs in to save the day with a steel chair. Knight is also there as they clear the ring off the Bron ‘n Bron Connection. Jey then offers a hand to Knight, and they exchange a few words before the latter shakes his hand. But then Knight pulls a Hey on Jey himself, and as soon as he turns away, he pulls Jey back in and hits the BFT!

The Detroit Lions didn’t just bounce back in Week 2 — they stomped the Chicago Bears into the turf at Ford Field. Coming off a sloppy Week 1 loss to the Green Bay Packers, head coach Dan Campbell and new offensive coordinator John Morton led the Lions to a massive 52–21 victory on Sunday. Quarterback Jared Goff threw five touchdowns. The offense put up 500+ yards. The defense overwhelmed rookie QB Caleb Williams. But the moment that really captured the postgame buzz? A single, silent Instagram post from Dan Campbell’s wife.Hours after the game, Holly Campbell posted a single photo on her Instagram: a giant, scratched-up lion hoisting a tiny bear cub in its mouth. No caption. No hashtags. The message landed instantly. Detroit didn’t just beat Chicago — they owned them. Fans immediately picked up on the symbolism, and the post quickly went viral across NFL fan circles. It was savage, sure, but also hilarious. And for many Lions fans, it was the perfect way to sum up what this win meant after a rocky offseason and a disappointing Week 1.From the very first drive, Detroit looked locked in. Running back Jahmyr Gibbs scored early, and the offense never took its foot off the gas.Amon-Ra St. Brown caught three touchdowns. The Lions averaged 8.8 yards per play — a franchise record — and pushed the score to 52–21 by the final whistle. And just to put an exclamation point on it, Dan Campbell called a gutsy fourth-and-goal in the fourth quarter with the game already well in hand. Goff found St. Brown for his third score of the day. Asked about it after the game, Bears head coach Ben Johnson didn’t seem thrilled. He said, “What’s he supposed to do? It’s fourth-and-goal, what do you want him to do? Yeah, he could’ve kicked a field goal, they don’t kick field goals, they go for it there.”This game carried more weight than most. Ben Johnson was the offensive mastermind behind Detroit’s top-ranked offense in 2024. When he took the Bears’ head coaching job after the Lions’ playoff loss, fans felt betrayed – and so did some inside the building.Inside the locker room, he kept the focus on the team. “Man, there’s nothing like gettin’ your first win of the season… and playing better than we did last week. A lot freakin’ better.” But outside the locker room, Holly Campbell’s post spoke louder than any press conference ever could.",The Detroit Lions beat the Chicago Bears 52-21 on Sunday.

Stephanie Niles’ outfit goes viral during Bengals game



Who is Stephanie Niles?

When Jake Browning took the field for the Bengals this week, fans expected him to make headlines for his arm, not his love life. But while Browning delivered in his big moment, it was his girlfriend, Stephanie Niles, who had the internet buzzing. Her bold gameday outfit turned just as many heads as his play, sparking viral debate, social media cheers, and plenty of “who is she?” curiosity.Sitting front row in Cincinnati orange, Niles showed up in a halter top with Browning’s jersey number on the front paired with standout orange leather pants. The look was anything but subtle- a playful, backless design that instantly made her one of the most talked-about figures of the night. Cameras caught her celebrating during the game and later sharing a sweet postgame moment with Browning, cementing her place as a viral star alongside the Bengals QB.Sports blogs quickly jumped on the clip, calling her outfit “risky,” “immodest,” and even “game-winning in its own right.” For Bengals fans, though, it was simply another reason to celebrate, Browning getting the win on the field and the couple serving major spotlight energy off of it.It didn’t take long for social media to light up. TikTok edits and X posts flooded timelines, some praising Niles as “the real MVP,” while others argued the outfit was “too much” for the sidelines. Still, the majority of comments leaned supportive, with fans joking that she “stole the show” and comparing her to some of the NFL’s most iconic WAGs.For those suddenly curious, Niles isn’t new to the Bengals community. She and Browning have been engaged and frequently share glimpses of their relationship on Instagram. Now, with Browning stepping into a bigger role for Cincinnati, it looks like Niles will be more in the public eye too, something Bengals fans don’t seem to mind.Browning’s strong showing on the field was the moment he’s been waiting for, but it was that postgame interaction with Niles, hugs, smiles, and all that truly sealed the night. Between the win and the viral spotlight, the couple has suddenly become one of the NFL’s unexpected storylines this season.If Browning keeps this momentum going, expect to see a lot more of Stephanie Niles in the stands and all over social media for months to come.Also read - “So in love”: Miley Cyrus gushes over Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s fairytale romance","Stephanie Niles’ outfit goes viral during Bengals game.

Carlie Irsay-Gordon takes charge

A new type of NFL owner

Also Read:

For Indianapolis Colts fans, seeing a team owner wearing a headset and jotting down notes on the sideline isn’t exactly an everyday sight. Yet that’s exactly what unfolded during a recent preseason game, when co-owner and CEO Carlie Irsay-Gordon caught attention for her active game-day involvement.Her approach signals a new era for the Colts, one shaped by a mix of family tradition and fresh leadership. Following the passing of her father, longtime Colts owner Jim Irsay, in May 2025, Carlie has stepped into the lead role, becoming the face of a new chapter in the franchise’s story.Ownership of the Colts has now transitioned into a true family affair. Carlie serves as principal owner and CEO, while her sisters Casey Foyt and Kalen Jackson hold key roles as executive vice president and chief brand officer.Together, they represent the next generation of leadership. But it’s Carlie who has stepped into the spotlight, and her actions already suggest she wants to run things in a far more engaged style than many NFL owners.Her game-day presence has been the clearest sign yet. During the Colts’ second preseason contest against the Packers, Carlie joined the broadcast team in the third quarter, headset on, notepad in hand.She wasn’t just there for show.By listening to play calls and jotting notes, she has made it clear she is serious about understanding the technical and strategic details of the game. It’s a continuation of the tradition set by her father, who was famous for his visible, passionate presence with the team.Carlie has been equally vocal off the field about her approach to leadership. In recent interviews, she’s stressed the need for owners to truly understand every aspect of their organization. That means being involved, asking hard questions, and ensuring executives are held accountable for their choices.She believes this kind of hands-on leadership helps avoid costly mistakes, and her direct, no-nonsense style has already struck a chord with both fans and players. Safety Cam Bynum, for example, praised her commitment and energy, a reflection of how her involvement is being received inside the locker room.Of course, not everyone agrees on her style. Some fans online have debated whether her sideline presence veers into micromanagement, while others see it as refreshing and forward-thinking. What’s clear is that Carlie isn’t content to simply sit in the luxury box and let others do the work. She wants to learn, participate, and shape the Colts’ future firsthand.As the Colts move forward under her guidance, Carlie Irsay-Gordon is redefining what it means to own an NFL franchise. By blending passion, accountability, and presence, she has positioned herself not just as the heir to her father’s legacy but as a leader determined to leave her own.","Carlie Irsay-Gordon is co-owner and CEO of the Indianapolis Colts.

Jayson Tatum and Tyrese Haliburton nearly got their hands on a $1 million paycheck



NBA stars Tyrese Haliburton and Jason Tatum are dealing with injuries



The two crown jewels of the NBA , Jayson Tatum and Tyrese Haliburton, are currently on the sidelines due to injuries throughout the offseason. So, the talented NBA player duo decided to switch things up and head for a major event in Atlantic City amidst their road to recovery. However, despite their presence, Tatum and Haliburton missed out on a million dollars in an interesting twist.Jayson Tatum and Tyrese Haliburton were in attendance for the second edition of the Casino Night Gala, hosted by REFORM alliance in Atlantic City. It is one of the most significant philanthropic events. This year, it raised more than $20 million for criminal justice reform, and the NBA star player duo were in the spotlight alongside other top invitees.American journalist Taylor Rooks posted photos from the event on her Instagram. In some of those snaps in her carousel, it was revealed that a competition was held for the invitees to win $1 million. Unfortunately, the magicians of the NBA court failed in their quest at the event, as the winners were other people.Furthermore, Rooks herself entered the contest and made it to the semi-finals, missing out on the prize herself.Apart from them, the other NBA stars who lost the contest at the Casino Night Gala were Karl-Anthony Towns, Devin Booker, and Trey Murphy III, as seen in Rooks' Instagram post, so it was not such a victorious night for the basketball stalwarts outside the court.While they were shining bright at the Casino Night Gala, Tyrese Haliburton and Jason Tatum suffered injuries during the NBA playoffs. Tatum, who plays for the Boston Celtics, tore his Achilles tendon in a match against the New York Knicks. On the other hand, the Indiana Pacers player Haliburton also injured his Achilles in Game 7 of the NBA Finals against the Thunder a few weeks later.However, after a tough six-week period, Tatum was back on his feet and attended the annual Jayson Tatum Foundation Charity event in St. Louis. Similarly, Haliburton hosted a camp for young players for three weeks and recently revealed that he was out of his precautionary boot. With both NBA stars rehabilitating at their best, it seems that they will be ready to go when the NBA season begins.Also read: Former NBA Champion Andrew Bogut reveals how Charlie Kirk's death posed an impact on Australians

The growing conspiracy and public reaction

Former NFL star Antonio Brown has ignited a firestorm of controversy on social media after posting a bizarre and inflammatory claim regarding George Zinn, a man now at the center of a growing conspiracy theory.

The Jew that was used as a decoy in the Charlie Kirk assassination was also used for 9/11 propaganda? YOU CAN’T MAKE THIS SH*T UP.""..Antonio Brown's comments followed a tweet from Jackson Hinkle, who claimed a resurfaced video shows George Zinn confessing to being part of a diversion during the alleged Charlie Kirk assassination attempt. The video allegedly shows Zinn linking Al Qaeda to the 9/11 attacks immediately after witnessing the collapse of the Twin Towers.Antonio Brown’s tweet quickly drew widespread attention, but it also raised significant backlash. Many have condemned the post as anti-Semitic and dangerous, noting that it fuels baseless conspiracy theories while putting individuals at risk.The identity and role of George Zinn remain highly controversial, and there has been no verified evidence linking him to either 9/11 or the Charlie Kirk incident.Despite this, conspiracy theorists have latched onto the narrative, further muddying the waters of public discourse.

The sudden upsurge that changed everything

Jaylon Johnson’s net worth and multiple hustles

Chicago Bears star cornerback Jaylon Johnson has quickly become one of the NFL’s top-paid defensive backs. His net worth significantly increased, adding much to his already existing sum. Signing a massive contract extension in 2024, Johnson attained financial security. His future looks secure, with both steady salary earnings and through endorsements and investments.The turning point in his career came in March 2024 when Johnson signed a four-year contract. A $76 million extension with Chicago was something that could change everything in his life, and it actually did. The deal averages about $19 million per season, firmly placing him among the league’s highest-paid corners.Just as important as the headline figure, Johnson secured $43.8 million guaranteed at signing, with an overall sum of $51 million guaranteed. For the 2025 season specifically, his base salary is just under $16 million, while his cap hit for the Bears sits around $21 million.For the 2025 season specifically, Johnson is set to take home $15.9 million in cash, which includes a $3.9 million base salary, a $12 million restructure bonus, and a small workout bonus.His official cap hit for the Bears sits at just under $13 million, a manageable number for Chicago given his impact on the field.Also Read: How weather and stadium conditions impact the Bears vs Vikings win probability Johnson’s net worth in 2025 is estimated at around $8–10 million. While much of his wealth is tied up in guaranteed money from his contract, he has already pocketed more than enough to secure his financial future. With two more seasons left on his extension after this year, and potential for another payday down the line, his overall earnings could soar well past $100 million if he stays healthy and productive.Off the field, Johnson isn’t known for glittery endorsement deals yet, but that may change as he continues to anchor Chicago’s defense. With his reputation as a lockdown corner and the Bears’ resurgence under a young roster, his profile is only getting bigger.In short, Jaylon Johnson’s combination of steady on-field performance and a well-structured contract has made him one of the NFL’s most secure young stars, both professionally and financially. Additionally, as of 2024, he was associated with Nike, according to sources.At the age of 26, Jaylon Johnson has not only secured his place as a leader in the Bears’ secondary but also set himself up for a prosperous future. His net worth as of today is only a part of the ongoing story. The bigger picture is a player whose value, both on and off the field, is rising.","Chicago Bears star cornerback Jaylon Johnson has quickly become one of the NFL’s top-paid defensive backs.

Taylor Swift makes her stand clear in legal fight between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni

Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni’s court clash also pulls in Ryan Reynolds and Taylor Swift

On Saturday, September 13, 2025, Taylor Swift’s attorneys told the court that the pop star has nothing to do with the lawsuit between actress Blake Lively and actor-director Justin Baldoni. The legal fight is tied to Baldoni’s film It Ends With Us. His lawyers had asked a New York judge for permission to question Swift after the release of her new album The Life of a Showgirl in October.Taylor Swift’s lawyer explained that the singer had “no material role” in the case. He also said Swift never agreed to give a deposition but, if forced, her team would find time in her busy schedule during the week of October 20.On Friday, September 12, Judge Lewis Liman rejected Justin Baldoni’s request. He ruled that Taylor Swift cannot be dragged into the case. This ruling was reported by CNN.Back in May 2025, Taylor Swift’s team had already filed a statement. It said she was not on the set of the film, not part of the casting, and had not even watched the movie until weeks after its release.Also Read: Patrick Mahomes quiet after Charlie Kirk shooting at Utah as Randi Mahomes and Tavia Hunt speaks out Blake Lively filed her lawsuit earlier this year against Justin Baldoni, his production company Wayfarer Studios, his publicist, and his crisis PR team.She said Justin Baldoni sexually harassed her during filming and later tried to damage her reputation with a smear campaign. Baldoni has denied all of these claims.In response, Justin Baldoni filed a $400 million countersuit against Lively and her husband, actor Ryan Reynolds, accusing them of defamation and extortion. That case, however, was dismissed by a judge in June 2025.Court papers reviewed by People Magazine on January 16, 2025, revealed that in one text, Lively referred to Swift and Reynolds as her “dragons” and compared herself to Khaleesi from Game of Thrones. Baldoni’s side argued that Swift and Reynolds influenced the creative process of the film. They also pointed out that Swift’s song My Tears Ricochet was used in the soundtrack.According to US Weekly, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce has been a strong supporter for Swift while her close friend Blake Lively faces this legal battle. Sources said Kelce has been Swift’s “sounding board” since the lawsuit was filed. In a sign of strain, Kelce even unfollowed Ryan Reynolds on social media.The two couples have been seen together in public before. On October 11, 2024, Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce were photographed in New York City with Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds. Later, in August 2024, they also celebrated Blake Lively’s birthday at Swift’s Rhode Island home.Judge Lewis J.

Suryakumar Yadav statement on Pahalgam to handshake drama: How India HUMILIATED Pakistan

Poll Was Suryakumar Yadav's dedication of the win to the armed forces appropriate? Yes, it's a meaningful gesture. No, it mixed sports with politics.

PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi's post

The controversy over the missing handshakes in the high-voltage Asia Cup clash between India and Pakistan has escalated into a full-blown row, with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) formally lodging a complaint with the International Cricket Council (ICC).PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi confirmed on Monday that the board has demanded “an immediate removal of the Match Referee from the Asia Cup” over alleged violations of the ICC Code of Conduct and MCC Laws pertaining to the Spirit of Cricket.“The PCB has lodged a complaint with the ICC regarding violations by the Match Referee of the ICC Code of Conduct and the MCC Laws pertaining to the Spirit of Cricket. The PCB has demanded an immediate removal of the Match Referee from the Asia Cup,” Naqvi posted on X.The flashpoint came during the toss at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium when Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha and Indian skipper Suryakumar Yadav avoided the customary handshake. According to PCB’s statement, match referee Andy Pycroft had specifically instructed Salman to refrain from shaking hands.“The match referee Andy Pycroft had asked captain Salman Ali Agha, at the time of the toss, not to shake hands with his Indian counterpart.The Pakistan team management has lodged a protest, calling the behaviour against the spirit of sports,” the board said.The situation further worsened after the match when Suryakumar, who led India to a dominant seven-wicket win, shook hands only with batting partner Shivam Dube and walked straight off without acknowledging the Pakistani players.Pakistan coach Mike Hesson expressed disappointment at the gesture.“Obviously, we were ready to shake hands at the end of the game. We were disappointed that our opposition didn't do that. We sort of went over there to shake hands and they were already going to the changing room. That was a disappointing way for the match to end. In a match where we were already disappointed with the way we played, we were at least willing to go and shake hands,” Hesson said.In protest, Salman Ali Agha skipped the post-match presentation ceremony, which further fuelled the controversy.India’s captain Suryakumar Yadav, however, stood firm on his stance, dedicating the victory to the Indian armed forces and victims of the Pahalgam terror attack.“Perfect occasion, taking the time out, we stand by the victims and families of the Pahalgam terror attack. We express our solidarity. I want to dedicate the win to all our armed forces who showed a lot of bravery,” Suryakumar said at the presentation.“I feel a few things in life are ahead of sportsmanship. I said at the presentation as well that we stand with all the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack. And we stand with their families too, expressing our solidarity. Also, as I said at the post-match presentation, we dedicate this win to our brave armed forces who took part in Operation Sindoor.”He also confirmed that the decision to avoid handshakes was not his alone.“I think that was our proper reply. Our government and the BCCI were aligned, and together we took a call. We came here only to play cricket,” Suryakumar said.With PCB’s complaint now sitting at the ICC headquarters led by its chair Jay Shah, the matter has triggered fresh diplomatic and sporting tensions between the two rivals, overshadowing what was otherwise a one-sided encounter on the field.",The Pakistan Cricket Board has lodged a complaint with the International Cricket Council.

Tampa Bay Buccaneers facing more injury concerns beyond Chris Godwin Jr.

Chris Godwin Jr. has been one of Tampa Bay’s most reliable weapons over the years. But his lingering foot issue has fans wondering whether he’ll be on the field under the lights. The Buccaneers are set to face the Houston Texans in a primetime clash, and questions around Godwin Jr. ’s status are dominating the buildup. Let’s break it down.No, Godwin Jr. will not play against the Texans. The Buccaneers ruled him out on Saturday’s final injury report, citing the lingering foot injury that required a second surgery earlier this year to “tighten up hardware,” according to NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport.Godwin Jr. was limited throughout the week, logging DNP and LP practice designations, before being officially ruled out. His timeline for return is now targeting Week 5, but could extend into Week 6 or Week 7 depending on recovery.With Godwin Jr. sidelined, rookie wide receiver Emeka Egbuka will continue to see an increased workload alongside Mike Evans. Egbuka broke out in Week 1 with two touchdowns against the Atlanta Falcons, and expectations are high for him to fill the No. 2 role again in Houston.Here’s everything you need to know for Monday night’s matchup:This will be the seventh all-time meeting between Tampa Bay and Houston.The Texans lead the series 5-1, including a 39-37 win back in Week 9 of 2023. Both teams enter Week 2 with plenty at stake: Tampa Bay looking to stay perfect at 2-0, and Houston trying to avoid a 0-2 start.Godwin Jr. isn’t the only key absence for the Buccaneers. Starting left tackle Tristan Wirfs has also been ruled out with a knee injury, leaving Baker Mayfield without two of his most trusted pieces on offense.Right tackle Luke Goedeke is questionable with a foot injury, meaning Tampa Bay could take the field without both starting tackles. Against a Texans defense led by Will Anderson Jr. and Danielle Hunter, that’s a serious concern.The Texans aren’t at full strength either, with wideouts Christian Kirk and Braxton Berrios ruled out. That leaves Nico Collins as the top option for C.J. Stroud. Both teams will be leaning on depth pieces to carry the load on offense in tonight’s primetime showdown.",Tampa Bay Buccaneers wide receiver Chris Godwin Jr. has been ruled out with a foot injury.

Donald Trump slams the NFL kickoff rule in Truth Social post

“The NFL has to get rid of that ridiculous looking new Kickoff Rule.”

“the ball is moving, and the players are not, the exact opposite of what football is all about.”

NFL owners defend dynamic kickoff rule with record returns and fewer injuries

Donald Trump hit out at the NFL on Monday, September 15, 2025. He went on Truth Social, his own site, and ripped into the league’s new kickoff rule. Trump called it “sissy football” and told the NFL to scrap it. The rule was brought in before the 2024 season after team owners voted on it in New York. The NFL said it wanted to make kickoffs safer and bring back more returns. Donald Trump does not agree. He says it looks “ridiculous” and is not real football.Trump’s post came early on Monday morning. He wrote,He argued that the new play is as risky as the old one. He said it looks strange because,Donald Trump went further. He added, “‘Sissy’ football is bad for America, and bad for the NFL!” He also compared the idea to rolling back golf balls so they fly shorter. Trump finished by pointing out that college football has not changed its kickoff. He said he hopes it never will.The NFL voted in the new kickoff in March 2024. Out of 32 owners, 29 agreed. The league said the goal was clear: fewer head injuries and more exciting returns.The rule sets up a “landing zone” between the end zone and the 20-yard line. The kicker must aim the ball there. All other players line up five to ten yards apart between the 30 and 40 of the return team. They cannot move until the ball is touched or hits the ground.Also Read: Patrick Mahomes Takes Full Blame For Travis Kelce’s Huge Mistake In Chiefs Loss To Eagles If the kick misses the landing zone or goes out of bounds, the return team gets the ball at its 40. Touchbacks first went to the 30, but in the 2025 offseason, owners pushed it to the 35.The changes brought quick results. In 2023, only 21.8% of kickoffs were returned. In 2024, that rose to 32.8%. This season, through Week 1 of 2025, the rate shot up to 75.6%. That is the highest in Week 1 since 2010.The NFL also said injuries fell. Concussions on kickoffs dropped by about 43%. For the league, that proves the new setup works, even if critics like Trump do not like how it looks.","The NFL voted in the new kickoff in March 2024. Out of 32 owners, 29 agreed.

Taylor Swift media buzz and Travis Kelce distraction talk

Travis Kelce game moments when Taylor Swift attended

Experts on Travis Kelce performance and Taylor Swift effect

Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift’s relationship is one of the biggest stories in both sports and pop culture. Every time Taylor shows up to a Kansas City Chiefs game, cameras point at her, fans cheer, and the internet goes wild. This has made many people ask a big question: does Taylor’s presence hurt Kelce’s game on the field? Let’s look at the numbers, the facts, and what experts really say.When Taylor Swift is in the stands, Travis Kelce’s stats often look even stronger. In 2023, the Chiefs won most of the games she attended. Kelce averaged more catches and more receiving yards in those games compared to when she wasn’t there.In fact, reports show he had nearly seven catches and close to 80 yards per game with Taylor watching. He even recorded more 100-yard games when she was present. So far, the data does not prove she harms his play. If anything, he seems to shine more when she is there.Of course, there’s no denying that Taylor Swift brings huge media attention. Every time she walks into a stadium, the cameras follow her. Kelce has admitted this means more noise, more paparazzi, and more people watching his every move. Some fans worry this adds pressure.But Travis Kelce himself has never said she distracts him. In fact, he has called Taylor a positive influence in his life. He says she makes him feel confident, supported, and even lucky. That’s not what you’d expect if she was really hurting his focus.There have been games where Kelce struggled with big moments while Taylor was in the crowd. For example, in the Chiefs’ 2025 season opener against the Eagles, she attended and Kelce dropped a key pass that turned into an interception.Critics quickly linked it to the “Taylor Swift effect.” But when you look at the full game, his stats were solid and in line with his usual output. One bad play does not prove that Taylor’s presence caused the mistake. Players have off moments, and Kelce is no different.Football experts and analysts agree that Travis Kelce’s core skills have not gone down since Swift started attending games. His speed, strength, and teamwork remain strong. Chiefs owner Clark Hunt even said Taylor brings “good energy” to the stadium.Analysts point out that fans and the media highlight Kelce’s mistakes more whenever she’s present, which makes them look bigger than they really are. But overall, his game performance stays steady. Kelce himself says he’s enjoying football like a kid and remains focused on winning with his team.Also Read: Patrick Mahomes Takes Full Blame For Travis Kelce’s Huge Mistake In Chiefs Loss To Eagles In the end, Taylor Swift’s presence doesn’t hurt Travis Kelce’s performance. What it does bring is more cameras, more fans, and more headlines. The numbers show he often plays better when she is there. Experts say the attention is a challenge, but one he is handling well. Far from being a problem, Taylor looks more like a support system who motivates him both on and off the field.","When Taylor Swift is in the stands, Travis Kelce’s stats often look even stronger.

New York Rangers linked to Kirill Kaprizov as Artemi Panarin contract extension decision looms amid potential blockbuster moves,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/new-york-rangers-linked-to-kirill-kaprizov-as-artemi-panarin-contract-extension-decision-looms-amid-potential-blockbuster-moves/articleshow/123908532.cms,"Sergei Belski-USA TODAY Sports

New York Rangers delay Artemi Panarin contract extension while monitoring Kirill Kaprizov’s future and NHL trade rumors

The Athletic

Long-term strategy and implications for New York Rangers roster building, NHL free agency , and trade speculation

The New York Rangers and star winger Artemi Panarin appear to be taking a patient approach on contract-extension talks, a decision that could shape the franchise’s long-term direction. According to reports, Rangers GM Chris Drury is not in a rush to extend Panarin as the team explores flexibility for potential big-name acquisitions, most notably Minnesota Wild winger Kirill Kaprizov , who has already turned down a record-setting deal.Panarin, 33, is entering the final season of his seven-year, $81.5 million contract with the Rangers. Despite being one of the NHL’s premier offensive talents, reports fromsuggest that New York’s front office is content to wait before committing to another long-term deal.The hesitation ties directly to the uncertainty in Minnesota, where 28-year-old Kirill Kaprizov recently rejected the most lucrative contract offer in NHL history. The development signals that Kaprizov could be open to exploring opportunities beyond the Wild, and the Rangers, already known for their pursuit of top-tier talent, are expected to keep a close watch. Notably, both Panarin and Kaprizov are represented by agent Paul Theofanous, creating further intrigue.By keeping options open, the Rangers are positioning themselves for potential blockbuster moves that could reshape their roster in the coming years. The franchise is believed to be eyeing the possibility of multiple star players becoming available, either through trades or future free agency. Alongside Kaprizov, names like Connor McDavid, Jack Eichel, and Kyle Connor could headline upcoming markets, making flexibility a valuable asset.For now, Panarin remains a central piece of New York’s lineup. He posted 37 goals and 52 assists for 89 points in 80 games last season, reinforcing his importance to the team’s offensive production. Still, the looming contract question reflects a balancing act between rewarding a proven veteran and preparing for the next wave of NHL superstars.The Rangers’ decision to hold off on Panarin’s extension underscores a forward-looking strategy that could have ripple effects across the league. With Kaprizov’s future in Minnesota uncertain and the potential availability of other stars, New York appears determined to maintain flexibility for blockbuster opportunities. For now, Panarin remains pivotal, but the long-term picture is firmly tied to what happens with Kaprizov and beyond.Also Read: “Just getting paid fairly”: Anthony Stolarz outlines contract expectations with Toronto Maple Leafs amid NHL extension talks","The New York Rangers and star winger Artemi Panarin appear to be taking a patient approach on contract-extension talks.

Coach’s timing system may not suit Williams’ improvisational style

Rookie QB’s creativity clashes with strict playbook rules

Loyalty questions loom over Chicago’s high-stakes gamble

A rookie quarterback’s instincts clashing with a coach’s structure is putting Chicago in a precarious spot. Colin Cowherd expressed serious doubts about the Bears’ No. 1 pick Caleb Williams and head coach Ben Johnson , warning that their partnership may struggle to survive the NFL ’s high-pressure environment. Early results may look promising, but the mismatch in style and philosophy could quickly become costly.Cowherd explained, “Ben Johnson and Caleb Williams. I don't think it works. The coach is a timing coach who loves structure and Caleb likes to ad lib. … So we know that Ben Johnson’s play design works, because the first two opening drives there for two touchdowns.” He warned that once Williams strays from the script, issues emerge.“The further this quarterback gets away from the play script, the worse he is. He's like a studio musician having to go live, or a stand-up comedian who's totally reliant on joke writers,” Cowherd said. He added, “His (Caleb Williams) style in this league is not a timing style, and this coach craves it,” highlighting the growing tension between Johnson’s system and Williams’ instincts.Cowherd questioned the depth of Johnson’s commitment, noting, “Maybe there's a coach it works with, I don't think it’s Ben Johnson. … I don't think this marriage is gonna work. I think Caleb may work somewhere, but this head coach did not draft this quarterback.So how loyal is he gonna be?” The warning signals potential friction beyond Xs and Os.For a city desperate to stabilize at quarterback, Cowherd’s critique is a cautionary tale. Success may hinge on whether Johnson adjusts his timing-focused system or Williams tempers his improvisational instincts. Without compromise, the NFL’s pressure cooker could see this pairing unravel before it ever reaches its potential.Also read: ""Still not real football"": Former NFL QB Kurt Benkert slams Eagles’ Tush Push despite 20-17 win over Chiefs","Colin Cowherd expressed serious doubts about the Bears’ No. 1 pick Caleb Williams and head coach Ben Johnson.

How the Tampa Bay Buccaneers secured the win

Rachaad White powers Tampa Bay Buccaneers to game winning touchdown

Tampa Bay Buccaneers show clutch performance with Baker Mayfield and Todd Bowles

On September 15, 2025, during a thrilling Monday Night Football clash at NRG Stadium in Houston , the Tampa Bay Buccaneers managed to beat the Houston Texans 20-19, marking their fifth consecutive 2-0 start to an NFL season. This game was part of a doubleheader shown on ABC and ESPN, showcasing the grit of both teams, but it was the Buccaneers' late-game strategy that secured the win, putting the Texans at 0-2.The Buccaneers' win came down to an exciting final drive and some crucial defensive efforts that stopped Houston from taking control. With only 2:10 left and trailing 19-14, Mayfield directed an 11-play, 80-yard drive, converting important downs and sealing the deal with Rachaad White's 2-yard touchdown run with just six seconds remaining.The two-point conversion that was missed kept the score at 20-19, but Houston had no time to answer back. Earlier, Tampa Bay's defense made a significant goal-line stand at the start of the fourth quarter, preventing the Texans from scoring on downs at the 1-yard line after they had a first-and-goal from the 8. This stop maintained a narrow 14-10 lead at that moment and shifted the momentum, even as Houston later rallied with special teams plays.The game played out like a story of two halves. Tampa Bay was ahead 14-10 at halftime thanks to Mayfield's touchdown throws, but the second half was tough for both teams offensively, featuring punts and a missed field goal from Bucs kicker Chase McLaughlin. Houston shifted the momentum with a blocked punt by Jakob Johnson, which set up Ka'imi Fairbairn's 53-yard field goal, bringing the score to 14-13 with 5:22 remaining.After that, Jaylin Noel's impressive 53-yard punt return paved the way for Chubb's 25-yard touchdown run, putting the Texans ahead 19-14 following a two-point conversion attempt that failed when Stroud got sacked.Tampa Bay's last effort, featuring Mayfield's 15-yard scramble on fourth-and-10 from his own 20, kept the momentum going and set the stage for White's big moment.Running back Rachaad White played a key role in the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' rushing game and the game-winning score. His 2-yard touchdown dive with just six seconds left not only secured the victory but also showcased his knack for coming through in clutch situations.White was a vital part of Tampa Bay's well-rounded offense, working alongside rookie Bucky Irving, who topped the team with 17 carries for 71 yards, including a crucial 22-yard catch on the last drive. White's tough running style really took a toll on the Houston Texans' defense, especially in short-yardage scenarios, and his touchdown came right after Irving's play set up a first-and-goal situation.Baker Mayfield was the backbone of the offense, completing 25 of 38 passes for 215 yards, two touchdowns, and zero interceptions. His first-half touchdowns—a 20-yard completion to Ryan Miller that leveled the score at 7-7 and a 15-yard throw to Egbuka for a 14-10 lead—established the game's rhythm.Egbuka's touchdown marked him as the sixth player since the NFL merger to score three receiving touchdowns in his first two games. Mike Evans contributed with five catches for 56 yards, proving to be a dependable target.Even with pressure from Houston's Danielle Hunter, who had two sacks and five tackles, Mayfield's agility stood out during the game-winning drive.Also Read: Justin Herbert shocks NFL as he flips the middle finger on arrival at Allegiant Stadium before Raiders clash It was indeed a gritty win that shows how tough the Tampa Bay Buccaneers can be when guided by Baker Mayfield and coach Todd Bowles, and being prepared to host the New York Jets next.

NBA analyst claimed that Adam Silver’s new plan might hit fans’ wallets

Matt George, Locked on Kings - Kawhi Leonard, Adam Silver & the Kings

Will the new Adam Silver plan actually hit the pockets of NBA fans

Something is brewing inside the league, and Adam Silver knows it very well. Well, the topic of subscription came up, and it made NBA fans worried about the same. With platforms like Amazon Prime, Netflix, and Peacock, many fans are worried that the NBA might face similar occurrences of events. Adam Silver, NBA commissioner, has made it quite clear that there is a lot of content that has been literally made available to the NBA fans free of cost. His ultimate plan is to impose a subscription on the live matches of the Sacramento Kings. NBA fans are worried as they feel the real pressure now that the league has already priced them out of their favorite team.Adam Silver has made it very clear about his new plan and how he is going to impose a radical subscription to watch the Sacramento Kings’ matches. “There’s a huge amount of our content that people can essentially consume for free. I mean, this is very much a highlights-based sport. So Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, you name it”, said the NBA commissioner. It is indeed true that the league has absolutely made every possible information and headline available for its fans.Damien Barling believes that Adam Silver’s brand-new plan could burn a hole in the pockets of the NBA fans.“Adam Silver does not like regional sports networks, and he has made that ridiculously clear”, Barling said on ESPN 1320. “I’m of the belief what he wants to do is create some sort of subscription service where you subscribe to something to watch your Sacramento Kings play every night. I don’t know that for sure, but I think that’s what he wants”, he further elaborated.The real question is whether the new plan could actually take a hit on the wallets of the NBA fans. Damien Barling has made it pretty clear that it might affect the fans. However, given that so much is being made available to fans free of cost, paying a certain amount to watch their favorite team should be a fair deal.Barling said, “I don’t think this would be anything extravagant $50. I don’t think it would be anything like that, but I do think we’d be looking at 10 to 15, maybe $25 to watch the Sacramento Kings play every year”. A mere amount of $15 - $25 should be fair enough on the part of the fans. So, in order to watch the Sacramento Kings on every Tuesday night, fans might now have to subscribe to the league pass and that sounds like a sweet deal.Also read: “Aspiration took all the escrow money before”- Mark Cuban makes massive claim about Steve Ballmer’s involvement in Kawhi Leonard’s $28 million no-show scandal","Adam Silver, NBA commissioner, has made it quite clear that there is a lot of content that has been literally made available to the NBA fans free of cost.

Suryakumar Yadav statement on Pahalgam to handshake drama: How India HUMILIATED Pakistan

Who is Andy Pycroft?

A major controversy erupted after India's seven-wicket victory over Pakistan in the Asia Cup match in Dubai on Sunday. Indian captain Suryakumar Yadav and his team refused to shake hands with their Pakistani counterparts, dedicating their win to the armed forces following Operation Sindoor. This came after a Pakistan-backed terror attack in Pahalgam killed 26 tourists.The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) responded by filing a formal complaint with the ICC. They claimed match referee Andy Pycroft had instructed the captains not to shake hands at the toss. The PCB demanded Pycroft's removal from the Asia Cup through a complaint to ICC General Manager Wasim Khan.Andy Pycroft, a former Zimbabwe cricketer, has an interesting history in cricket. Though his playing career was brief, with just three Tests and 20 ODIs, he made notable contributions. His standout moment came when he scored 104 runs against an Australian B side that included cricket legends Shane Warne and Steve Waugh.Pycroft's journey in cricket didn't end with his playing days. He took on various roles in cricket management, including coaching Zimbabwe's Under-19 team and serving as a selector.He briefly coached the national team but stepped down during the 2003 World Cup due to selection disputes.Today, Pycroft is one of cricket's most experienced match referees. He has officiated 103 Test matches since 2009, making him the fourth most experienced referee in Test cricket history. His connection with India goes back to his Test debut in Harare in 1992, where he scored 39 and 46 runs. Recently, he was the match referee when Nitish Kumar Reddy scored his first Test century during India's tour of Australia in 2024-25.","India captain Suryakumar Yadav and his team refused to shake hands with their Pakistani counterparts, dedicating their win to the armed forces following Operation Sindoor.

Cam Newton takes aim at Shedeur Sanders as rookie QB faces growing Browns controversy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/cam-newton-takes-aim-at-shedeur-sanders-as-rookie-qb-faces-growing-browns-controversy/articleshow/123912491.cms,"Shedeur Sanders (Image via Getty)

Cam Newton says Sanders ignored priceless chance to learn

Browns leave rookie QB buried on depth chart

Sanders brushes off past as criticism intensifies

Shedeur Sanders has found himself in the eye of a storm just two weeks into his NFL career. Ahead of the Browns’ clash with the Ravens, Adam Schefter reported that Sanders discouraged Baltimore from drafting him, not wanting to share a quarterback room with Lamar Jackson . That choice, which altered the Ravens’ draft board and landed him in Cleveland instead, has ignited a wave of criticism—none sharper than Cam Newton’s pointed take.Speaking on ESPN, Newton didn’t mince words about the situation. He argued that Sanders turned down a golden opportunity to learn behind a quarterback who has already redefined the position. “Imagine being able to sit behind Lamar Jackson,” Newton said. “He’s a two-time MVP, arguably the best player in football. That’s the situation most young quarterbacks dream about.”Newton, who once walked the same rookie-to-MVP path, made it clear that patience and humility are often the missing ingredients for long-term success. To him, Sanders’ decision looked more like short-sightedness than strategy.If Baltimore was a missed chance, Cleveland hasn’t offered a clear path to the field either. Sanders sits third on the depth chart behind veteran Joe Flacco and rookie Dillon Gabriel. He was inactive against the Ravens in Week 2, watching from the sideline as his team suffered a lopsided defeat. For now, the Browns appear content to let their young quarterback bide his time.Since Schefter’s revelation, the scrutiny has only mounted. Former players and analysts alike have questioned Sanders’ readiness to embrace the grind of learning before leading. After the Ravens’ 41-17 drubbing of the Browns, Sanders brushed off the controversy. “Whatever happened in the past, it is what it is,” he told reporters, offering no direct denial or confirmation.But in the high-stakes world of the NFL, where perception often shapes opportunity, silence hasn’t eased the doubts. For now, Sanders remains a talented prospect stuck between expectations and reality—with Cam Newton’s words serving as a harsh reminder of what might have been.Also read: ""Still not real football"": Former NFL QB Kurt Benkert slams Eagles’ Tush Push despite 20-17 win over Chiefs","Shedeur Sanders has found himself in the eye of a storm just two weeks into his NFL career.

Lucknow: Shreyas Iyer will get a chance to reinstate his red-ball credentials when he leads an India ‘A’ team against Australia ‘A’ in the first of the two four-day matches here at the Ekana Stadium from Tuesday. The seasoned but discarded Iyer will be eager to make full use of this opportunity.Apart from Iyer, the performance of 30-year-old Abhimanyu Easwaran — who has been on the radar of national selectors for some time now, thanks to his consistent performances in Ranji Trophy — too will be watched.Easwaran had been part of the Test side on five overseas tours — in 2021 (England), 2022 (Bangladesh), 2023-24 (South Africa), 2024-25 (Australia) and 2025 (England) — but is yet to make the playing XI. In the domestic scene, though, he has been super consistent.India ‘A’ head coach Hrishikesh Kanitkar said, “It’s a great opportunity. Most of them have played the Duleep Trophy recently so this is the next step.”","Shreyas Iyer will get a chance to reinstate his red-ball credentials.
