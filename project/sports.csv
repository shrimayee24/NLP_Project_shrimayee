Gautam Gambhir faces setback as BCCI rejects his recommendations for support staff: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/gautam-gambhir-faces-setback-as-bcci-rejects-his-recommendations-for-support-staff-report/articleshow/111674262.cms,"NEW DELHI: Before officially stepping into his role as India’s head coach , Gautam Gambhir encountered a minor setback. Reports indicate that Gambhir’s recommendation for Jonty Rhodes as the fielding coach has been turned down by the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ).Gambhir, who has recently been appointed as India’s head coach, had proposed the name of Jonty Rhodes, widely regarded as one of the best fielders to have ever played the game.Rhodes had previously worked with Gambhir at Lucknow Super Giants, where Gambhir was a mentor. However, the BCCI remains steadfast in its policy of maintaining an all-Indian support staff for the national team, a practice that has been in place for the past seven years.According to a report by the Hindustan Times, the BCCI is not inclined to hire foreign personnel for the support staff. This decision comes as India transitions to a new coaching regime following the completion of the tenures of previous head coach Rahul Dravid and his support staff, which included batting coach Vikram Rathour, bowling coach Paras Mhambrey, and fielding coach T Dilip, post the T20 World Cup.As per the same HT report, Gambhir’s proposal for R Vinay Kumar as the bowling coach was also reportedly not supported by the board.Additionally, there were earlier reports from Cricbuzz about Gambhir advocating for the inclusion of former Netherlands international Ryan ten Doeschate in his support staff. Ten Doeschate, who served as the fielding coach for Kolkata Knight Riders, is also involved with the franchise’s teams in the Caribbean Premier League and Major League Cricket.Despite these recommendations, the BCCI has made it clear that the final decision on the composition of the support staff rests solely with them. Gambhir’s setback indicates the board’s commitment to maintaining its current strategy and structure for the Indian cricket team’s support personnel.The cricketing community now awaits the BCCI's final decision on the support staff that will work alongside Gambhir as he embarks on his new journey as India’s head coach.",Gautam Gambhir's recommendation for Jonty Rhodes as fielding coach turned down.

India's new head coach Gautam Gambhir wants Ryan ten Doeschate in support staff: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/indias-new-head-coach-gautam-gambhir-wants-ryan-ten-doeschate-in-support-staff-report/articleshow/111651202.cms,"The BCCI has lately advocated for Indian coaches in the setup, but Team India's new head coach Gautam Gambhir has reportedly asked for a slight deviation in the form of including former Netherlands international Ryan ten Doeschate as part of his support staff, according to Cricbuzz.The final decision, however, rests with the Indian board.Doeschate has always been openly backed by Gambhir as a thorough professional committed to team's objectives.The Dutchman was also one of Gambhir's assistants during the former India opener's role as mentor of Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) during the team's triumph in the 2024 season of the Indian Premier League.Doeschate was KKR's fielding coach and is also part of the teams that the franchise owns in the Caribbean Premier League and Major League Cricket.According to the Cricbuzz report, the BCCI is already discussing ten Doeschate's name but the board wants T Dilip to continue in his role as the fielding coach. In that scenario, the Dutchman could be considered for a different role. Notably, another member of Gambhir's coaching staff in KKR, Abhishek Nayar, is being considered for the role of India's assistant coach.Nayar was the batting coach for KKR in IPL 2024.If Gambhir and BCCI manage to rope in both Nayar and Doeschate, it will leave a major void in KKR's coaching setup.Gambhir replaced Rahul Dravid as India's head coach last week. Dravid's tenure ended with the T20 World Cup, which India won last month to end an 11-year wait for another ICC trophy.","Gautam Gambhir has reportedly asked for Ryan ten Doeschate to be part of his support staff.

NEW DELHI: India Champions emerged victorious over Pakistan Champions by five wickets in the 2024 World Championship of Legends final held in Birmingham.Led by Yuvraj Singh , India successfully chased a target of 157 runs in 19.1 overs. Ambati Rayudu set the stage with a quick-fire fifty, followed by crucial contributions from Yusuf Pathan , Gurkeerat Singh Mann , and the captain himself.Pakistan, opting to bat first, posted a total of 156 for 6. Indian bowlers, spearheaded by Anureet Singh's three-wicket haul, effectively restricted Pakistan's run flow. As a result, India's target appeared manageable, although they faced initial setbacks.Openers Robin Uthappa and Ambati Rayudu got India off to a promising start with a 34-run partnership. However, pacer Aamer Yamin swung the momentum back in Pakistan's favor by dismissing Uthappa and Suresh Raina in the same over, leaving India at 38/2.Rayudu then partnered with Gurkeerat Singh Mann, adding a 60-run stand for the third wicket, with Rayudu smashing a quick 50 off 30 balls. His innings featured two sixes and five boundaries. However, Pakistan's Saeed Ajmal provided a crucial breakthrough by dismissing Rayudu in the 12th over.Shoaib Malik then removed Gurkeerat, 34 off 33, to further dent India's chase in the next over.The Indian score stood at 108/4 when Yusuf Pathan and Yuvraj Singh joined forces. Pathan played an aggressive 30 off 16 balls, hitting three towering sixes, while Yuvraj held his ground with an unbeaten 15 from 22 deliveries. Their partnership of 42 runs in just 5.4 overs was pivotal.With Yusuf going for big shots, captain Yuvraj played an uncharacteristically slow knock. But their stand for the fifth wicket turned out to be the deciding factor in the end.In the 19th over, Wahab Riaz dismissed Yusuf Pathan, leaving India needing just seven more runs from 10 balls. Yuvraj and Irfan Pathan then ensured India reached the target, with Irfan hitting the winning boundary off Sohail Tanvir on the first ball of the final over.Earlier, Pakistan's innings was primarily held together by Shoaib Malik, who top-scored with 41 runs off 36 balls, including three sixes. Contributions also came from Sohail Tanvir, who added an unbeaten 19 off 9 deliveries.For India, besides Anureet Singh's standout performance with figures of 3 for 43, Irfan Pathan (1 for 12), Pawan Negi (1 for 24), and Vinay Kumar (1 for 36) provided essential support by taking key wickets.While Malik and Tanvir's efforts pushed Pakistan past the 150-mark, it wasn't sufficient to defend against a disciplined Indian side.

Irfan Pathans Hat-trick vs Pakistan

Irfan Pathan rolled back the years in Birmingham on Saturday when his famous late in-swinger went through the gate to castle Younis Khan during the final of the World Championship of Legends (WCL) between India and Pakistan, reminding of Irfan's famous hat-trick during the Karachi Test between the archrivals in 2006.Trying to play towards the on-side on a delivery that swung in late and just enough to go through the gap between the bat and pad, the Pakistan Champions skipper could only hear the sound of timber as Irfan's delivery ended up rattling the stumps behind him.Eighteen years earlier, when Irfan was in his prime, he claimed a famous hat-trick in third Test of the series in Karachi during India's tour of Pakistan. Coincidentally, Younis was the second wicket to fall in that hat-trick by Irfan, which is still the only instance of a hat-trick in the first over of a Test.The difference between the two dismissals was that Irfan generated more swing to dismiss Younis in 2006 and he was adjudged out lbw instead of getting clean bowled, which was the mode of dismissal on Saturday.Opner Salman Butt and Mohammad Yousuf were the other two batsmen that Pathan dismissed as part of his hat-trick in the Karachi Test.On Saturday in Birmingham, India Champions defeated Pakistan Champions in the final by five wickets to win the World Championship of Legends tournament that featured veteran players.Led by Yuvraj Singh, India successfully chased a target of 157 runs in 19.1 overs.

Novak Djokovic battles Carlos Alcaraz for historic Wimbledon glory,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/wimbledon/novak-djokovic-battles-carlos-alcaraz-for-historic-wimbledon-glory/articleshow/111719310.cms,"LONDON: When Novak Djokovic steps on Centre Court on Sunday afternoon it will be 38 days since his right knee went under the knife in a Paris hospital.At the time, the reasoning behind the express decision appeared to be the Olympic Games. Wimbledon may not have been on his radar at first, but then The Championships was never really off the seven-time champion’s mind either.Playing at SW19 this fortnight, is the miracle on a knee sleeve.The 37-year-old will take on the effervescent Carlos Alcaraz in what will be the Serbian’s 37Grand Slam final and the tenth here at Church Road . It’s a rematch of last year’s final, with Djokovic looking for a historic 25major title and Alcaraz a second Wimbledon crown and fourth major.“I'm aware that Roger (Federer) holds eight Wimbledons. I hold seven. History is on the line. Also, the potential 25th Grand Slam,” said Djokovic, owning the moment. “It is great motivation, but at the same time, it's a lot of pressure. Every time I step on the court now, even though I'm 37 and competing with the 21-year-olds, I still expect myself to win, and people expect me to win.”Djokovic, who reached the semifinals at the Australian Open and the quarterfinals at Roland Garros, is in his first final of the year.“This year hasn't been that successful for me. It's probably the weakest results in the first six months I've had in many years. I had to really try to find a way, also I had to regroup from the injury,” he said. “There have been seasons where I wasn't playing at a desired level, but then I would win Wimbledon and then things would change. Wimbledon brings the best out of me and motivates me to really always show up and perform the best I can.”It is the grass on which his game grows.Djokovic, who has been meticulously following medical guidance in his return to competition, wasn’t sure he would play Wimbledon until three-four days before the start of The Championships.Lorenzo Musetti , who finished on the wrong side of the scoreline against the world No.2 in the semifinals, said it was the best Djokovic had played against him in their seven meetings.Alcaraz, who trails the Serbian 2-3 in head-to-head clashes, having lost both matches he played against Djokovic after Wimbledon last year, knows what to expect in the final.“I know how it's going to feel playing against Djokovic,” the 21-year-old Spaniard said. “I know what I have to do. I'm sure he knows what he has to do to beat me. It's going to be an interesting one.”Djokovic applauded Alcaraz' coming of age on grass so early, given that it’s not a surface Spanish players grow up on.“I see a lot of similarities between me and him in terms of ability to adapt and adjust to the surface. He has the skills to play well on any surface,” Djokovic said, adding, “he's a complete player.”“I think he's going to win many Grand Slams in his career,” Djokovic said of Alcaraz. “I hope he's going to give me this one in two days… After that I'll cheer for him.”","World No.2 Novak Djokovic will play Carlos Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final on Sunday.

ICC members raise concerns over 'mismanaged' World Cup,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/icc-members-raise-concerns-over-mismanaged-world-cup/articleshow/111724102.cms,"NEW DELHI: The International Cricket Council ( ICC ) is going to audit the recently-concluded T20 World Cup at its next board meeting in Colombo next week. TOI has learnt that the board members have expressed disappointment over how the tournament was organized in USA and West Indies.Amidst these concerns, ICC’s head of events Chris Tetley tendered his resignation on Friday.Sources said that some member boards have written to ICC about the huge expenses incurred during the USA leg of the tournament.There are questions also over why New York, which organized a temporary stadium for the tournament, had become the central venue for the marquee matches in the first half of the tournament.“The auditing is still on. There are assumptions that ICC may have incurred losses in ticketing as well in the USA leg. The tournament looked mismanaged. The performance of the New York stadium wasn’t up to the mark,” an ICC source said.“The board will discuss how the organizing committee may have overshot the allocated budget. It was always going to be a herculean task to take mainstream cricket to USA. The ICC team has worked hard to conduct the tournament but expenses need to be checked at the same time,” the source added.As far Tetley’s resignation, sources said that Tetley had discussing it with ICC bosses for a year.“There are backto-back ICC events which started with the ODI World Cup last year. Tetley and another executive were asked to stay on for a while to oversee a smooth transition. They may be asked to stay on till the Women’s T20 World Cup in Oct or the Champions Trophy in Feb.

This final will mark the end of a month-long football extravaganza, during which Spain, led by their teenage prodigy Lamine Yamal, have been the standout team.Spain have already knocked out several of Europe's top teams while maintaining a perfect record of six wins on their way to the final. They are aiming to secure a record fourth European championship title, having previously triumphed in 1964, 2008, and 2012.England, on the other hand, have faced challenges against weaker opponents but delivered their best performance in the semi-finals, defeating the Netherlands 2-1 with a crucial goal from substitute Ollie Watkins.This marks England's second straight appearance in the European Championship final, as they seek to erase the painful memory of their penalty shoot-out defeat to Italy at Wembley in the previous edition three years ago. If Gareth Southgate's men can secure victory, it will be England's first major men's title in 58 years, since their 1966 World Cup triumph on home soil.""We know that we have to do this one, we have to get this trophy to really feel the respect of the rest of the football world,"" Southgate told reporters on Saturday as he reflected on the number of near misses his team has had in recent years.England's national football team has consistently performed well in recent international tournaments, reaching the semi-finals of the 2018 World Cup and the final of Euro 2020. However, they suffered a disappointing exit in the quarter-finals of the 2022 World Cup, losing to France.Despite boasting a talented squad led by captain Harry Kane and rising star Jude Bellingham, England struggled in the group stage of the current tournament, managing just one victory against Serbia and scoring only two goals across their matches.In the last 16, England faced a tough challenge against Slovakia, requiring a last-gasp intervention from Bellingham to force extra time. They eventually progressed through the additional period before triumphing on penalties against Switzerland and narrowly defeating the Netherlands.As England prepares to face Spain, they will be confronting their most formidable opponent yet. The two nations have not met at a major tournament since Euro 96, when an England team that included current manager Gareth Southgate as a player emerged victorious on penalties in the quarter-finals.""The belief has grown as we've gone through the tournament,"" Kane said.""What we have been through with the late goals and the penalty shoot-outs builds resilience and builds belief. The team is obviously confident.""Under the guidance of coach Luis de la Fuente, Spain's thrilling new generation has propelled the country to their first men's major tournament final since their incredible victories at Euro 2008, the 2010 World Cup, and Euro 2012.The team has illuminated an otherwise lackluster tournament, thanks to the commanding presence of Rodri Hernandez in midfield and the electrifying performances of wingers Nico Williams and Yamal, who celebrated his 17th birthday on Saturday.Spain dominated their group stage, winning all their matches without conceding a single goal, including impressive victories over Croatia, the 2022 World Cup semi-finalists, and Italy, the current European champions.In the quarter-finals, they triumphed over hosts Germany in extra time in Stuttgart. Then, in the semi-finals, a breathtaking goal from Yamal helped them overcome a deficit to defeat Kylian Mbappe 's France.""Tomorrow is when I will ask the least of my team. They have been giving everything. Tomorrow is simply about enjoying it,"" insisted the 63-year-old De la Fuente.""We are two great sides, the best two teams.

Part-time bowlers Shivam Dube and Abhishek Sharma played crucial roles in the middle overs.Zimbabwe's captain Sikandar Raza top-scored with a brisk 46 off 28 balls, including three sixes and two fours. However, the Indian bowlers managed to keep the overall scoring in check.Sharma, with figures of 1/20 in three overs, and Dube, with 1/11 in two overs, dismantled Zimbabwe's dangerous opening partnership.

Despite the team's efforts, they were unable to secure an IPL trophy during this period.Although the situation is still developing, there is a strong likelihood that Sourav Ganguly , who currently serves as the Team Director of DC, may take on the additional role of head coach in the upcoming season.“As you move on as our head coach, we are finding it incredibly difficult to put it down in words. The four things that you told us about in every huddle -- care, commitment, attitude and effort, they sum up our seven years together,” DC posted on their official 'X' handle.The franchise expressed their heartfelt sentiments in an emotional post, reflecting on their extensive partnership with the Australian. However, it has come to light that Ponting was unequivocally informed that his performance has failed to meet the expectations of the management, despite being granted an unprecedented seven-year tenure without delivering the desired results.Ponting, who led Australia to two World Cup victories, joined the franchise in 2019. Although the team reached its first-ever final in 2021, their performances in subsequent years have not lived up to the initial potential showcased during that promising run.“The top brass of Delhi Capitals has intimated Ricky that they aren't happy that the team didn't win a championship in seven years and they are trying to look at rejigging the support staff. He won't be continuing next year,” a source close to DC management told PTI on conditions of anonymity.The decision-makers want Ponting to be more involved in the auction process and team building, rather than just joining a couple of weeks before the start of the IPL.It remains uncertain whether DC will hire a new head coach or ask Ganguly to take on the head coach role.Praveen Amre , the diligent assistant coach, is set to continue.The DC co-owners, JSW and GMR group, are scheduled to meet either at the end of this month or early next month to discuss the future direction.Player retention is another issue up for discussion. If the retention limit remains at four, DC will have to release either Australia's Jake Fraser-McGurk or South Africa's Tristan Stubbs , as there is only one overseas slot available.Regarding the Indian core, retention choices are straightforward, with skipper Rishabh Pant , all-rounder Axar Patel, and wrist-spinner Kuldeep Yadav leading the list.A mega auction is anticipated ahead of the IPL 2025 , and there is a possibility that some retainable stars from each franchise might want to enter the auction pool to determine their true market value.","Delhi Capitals have ended their association with head coach Ricky Ponting.

While the legendary James Anderson bid farewell to Test cricket after a record-breaking career, a new generation of pace bowlers, spearheaded by Gus Atkinson, stepped into the limelight.England star Joe Root has expressed his confidence in Gus Atkinson's ability to play a pivotal role in shaping England's fast-bowling attack following Jimmy Anderson's retirement from Test cricket.Anderson, who has taken more wickets (704) than any other fast bowler in Test history, bid an emotional farewell to the game after the first Test against the West Indies at Lord's.Root acknowledged Anderson's status as ""our greatest ever bowler"" but also recognized the opportunities that his departure presents for a new generation of bowlers to emerge.Atkinson's remarkable Test debut, where he surpassed Anderson's career-best match figures with 12 wickets for 106 runs, has made the transition appear less daunting for Ben Stokes ' side.""I think the future does look very bright in the bowling department,"" Root stated, as quoted by AFP. ""We've lost our greatest-ever bowler, but for Gus to come in and do that shows a lot about where we are as a team. We are moving in the right direction.""With two more Tests against the West Indies and a three-match series against Sri Lanka scheduled for later in the summer, Root is already looking ahead to the highly anticipated Ashes clash with Australia, set to take place in late 2025 and early 2026.Anderson will remain involved with the team as a mentor for the rest of the summer, providing invaluable experience and knowledge to the young bowlers like Atkinson, Dillon Pennington, and Matthew Potts. Root emphasized the importance of this arrangement, stating, ""You can't buy that experience, can you? No fast bowler has played that amount of Test matches, taken that amount of wickets. So for young guys coming in, someone like Gus or the likes of Dillon Pennington and Matthew Potts , to have that knowledge to bounce off, it's invaluable really.""England will be aiming for their first series win over Australia since 2015, and Root believes Atkinson could emerge as a key figure in those conditions.""I think as a player, the Ashes is the series that you're always looking forward to, they're the ones you're always building towards,"" Root said. ""When teams have gone out there, what they need for those conditions is someone like Gus that can bowl in the late 80mphs, early 90mphs, and still move the ball around and make things happen at high pace.

However, Colombia is determined to thwart that ambition in a clash that sees the powerhouse confront the rising force in the championship match.The showdown will unfold on Sunday evening at Hard Rock Stadium, a venue that hosted two group stage encounters and is set to be the location for seven matches during the 2026 World Cup.In the lead-up to the game, both teams voiced apprehensions about security following an incident involving Uruguay's Darwin Núñez and several of his teammates. They entered the stands amidst a physical altercation between supporters at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, North Carolina, after Uruguay's semifinal victory against Colombia.Uruguay captain José Giménez stated that players went into the crowd to safeguard their families, while coach Marcelo Bielsa vehemently criticized tournament organizers for failing to adequately protect the families of players seated in the stands behind the Uruguay bench.“I’m concerned about what could happen tomorrow,” Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni said through an interpreter. Goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez added it “would be great if we could reinforce security.”CONMEBOL said in a news release that “any action that tarnishes a global football celebration will not be tolerated.”Argentina, the reigning champions of the Copa America in 2021 and the World Cup in 2022, has the opportunity to match Spain's achievement from 2008-12 by securing three major titles in a row.Despite Messi's leg injury, the Albiceleste reached the final without relying heavily on his dominant performances.The 37-year-old superstar, who has won the Ballon d'Or a record eight times, showcased his skills by weaving through defenders and creating chances for his teammates. However, his only goal came in the semifinal against Canada, where he deflected Enzo Fernández's shot past goalkeeper Maxime Crépeau, contributing to Argentina's 2-0 victory.Ahead of the final, Messi said he's battled discomfort at times throughout the tournament but assured it won't slow him down on Sunday.“In the final I’m going to feel better,” he said in an interview with DSports.Colombia is set to compete in its first Copa America final in 23 years, having extended its unbeaten run to a team-record 28 games, surpassing their previous best from 1992-94. This streak is currently the longest in men's international soccer.James Rodríguez has been Colombia's standout player and potentially the best in the entire tournament. With six assists to his name, he has set a new record for the most assists in a single Copa America since data tracking began in 2011, surpassing Messi's five assists in 2021.“James has had a great Copa America,” Colombia coach Néstor Lorenzo said through an interpreter. “We are lucky enough to have him at a very good level. The team has supported him. I can only hope that tomorrow his performance will be great.”Colombia's head coach, Lorenzo, commended the team's united effort in reaching the current stage of the tournament, which involved a hard-fought victory against 15-time champion Uruguay. He expressed gratitude towards the Colombian supporters, noting that their matches, alongside Argentina's, have drawn some of the largest crowds.However, Lorenzo emphasized that this level of performance should be the standard for the resurgent Colombian team, which secured its sole Copa America title on home soil in 2001, rather than an exceptional occurrence.“We’d love it if it wouldn’t be such a surprise to get to a final, so unexpected,” he said. “We’d like to be always on top. It’s not easy. ... Let’s hope this can last. Let’s hope we can keep on going.”The two teams previously met in the 2021 semifinal, where Argentina emerged victorious with a 3-2 win on penalties following a 1-1 draw in regular time.

NEW DELHI: After an exciting tournament featuring 50 matches and the departure of 22 teams, England and three-time champions Spain are set to clash in the Euro 2024 final in Berlin on Sunday.The competition has showcased a promising new generation of footballers, such as teenagers Lamine Yamal, Arda Guler, and Kobbie Mainoo. However, several established players who were previously under the radar have also demonstrated their skills on the European stage.Here are five stars who have broken through with impressive performances at Euro 2024A 26-year-old midfielder for Spain, has been crucial to his team's success in the tournament. The 26-year-old is well-known in Germany after four years at RB Leipzig but has made everyone else stand up and take notice of his ability with a string of excellent performances in his adopted country. Despite starting only two of Spain's six games, Olmo has scored three goals, tied for the most in the tournament, and provided two assists.England's Marc Guehi, playing in his first major international tournament at the age of 23, has quickly become a key player in Gareth Southgate's defensive setup. Just 23, he has been calm and assured alongside John Stones in central defence, with England conceding just three goals in five games with Guehi on the park. Guehi's importance to the team was highlighted when he was suspended for the quarter-final against Switzerland, and he also contributed to the attack with an assist for Jude Bellingham's last-gasp equaliser against Slovakia in the last 16.A forward for the Netherlands, has been instrumental in his team's run to their first Euros semi-final in 20 years. The orange shirt seems to bring the best out of the 25-year-old, whose impressive performances at the Qatar World Cup came before a big-money transfer to English giants Liverpool. Gakpo scored crucial goals against Poland and Romania and forced a late own goal against Turkey in the quarter-finals.Georgia's goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili has been a standout player for his country in their first-ever Euros appearance. Standing at nearly two meters tall, Mamardashvili made 30 saves in four matches, the second-most in Euros history. His performances have not surprised La Liga fans, as he has been among the best goalkeepers in Spain this season.Finally, Austria's Marcel Sabitzer has continued his stellar form from Borussia Dortmund's Champions League run at Euro 2024. The 30-year-old midfielder scored the winner against the Netherlands to secure top spot in their group and has been a constant goal threat, particularly from long range. His boundless energy has been key for Austria's high-intensity playing style under Ralf Rangnick.","England and Spain will meet in the Euro 2024 final in Berlin on Sunday. Dani Olmo, Marc Guehi, Cody Gakpo, Marcel Sabitzer and Giorgi Mamardashvili have all been key players for their countries.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111724064,imgsize-69766,width-400,resizemode-4/111724064.jpg"
Uruguay finish third in Copa America after beating Canada on penalties,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/uruguay-finish-third-in-copa-america-after-beating-canada-on-penalties/articleshow/111724053.cms,"Uruguay 's Luis Suarez scored a last-gasp equaliser against Canada in the Copa America third-place playoff on Saturday, forcing the match into a penalty shootout. The South Americans eventually triumphed 4-3 in the shootout at Charlotte's Bank of America Stadium.Canada had taken a surprising 2-1 lead in the 80th minute through Jonathan David's goal and appeared to be on the verge of a remarkable victory.However, Suarez, who entered the game as a second-half substitute, scored a neat finish from Jose Gimenez's assist in the 92nd minute to level the score at 2-2 and send the match to penalties.During the shootout, Uruguay goalkeeper Sergio Rochet saved Ismael Kone's spot-kick, while Alphonso Davies' attempted panenka hit the crossbar and bounced out, securing Uruguay's victory.The result was a disappointing conclusion to the tournament for the Canadians, who had been close to achieving a well-deserved and memorable win before Suarez's late goal.Uruguay had started the match strongly, with Tottenham midfielder Rodrigo Bentancur giving them the lead in the eighth minute. Sebastian Caceres outjumped his marker to set up Bentancur, who turned and swiveled before blasting a shot into the top of the net.The Uruguayans nearly doubled their advantage shortly after, but Maximiliano Araujo's shot was blocked by Canada goalkeeper Dayne St. Clair following a swift counter-attack that left Canada's defence scrambling.Kone then scored a brilliant improvised goal to level the match at 1-1 in the 22nd minute. Bombito's header from Shaffelburg's corner was met by Kone, who cleverly lobbed the onrushing Rochet.Uruguay appeared to have scored shortly after, but Pellistri's goal in the 23rd minute was disallowed due to an offside infringement in the build-up. Canada then wasted two excellent chances to take the lead just before the break, with Oluwaseyi heading wide from close range and Osorio seeing his effort cleared off the line.The second half was fragmented due to numerous substitutions, and the match seemed to be heading for a draw. However, with 10 minutes remaining, Kone made a powerful run from midfield and unleashed a fierce shot that Rochet could only parry into David's path, who calmly slotted home to give Canada a 2-1 lead.Instead of protecting their advantage, Canada continued to push forward, ultimately paying the price for their aggressive approach when Uruguay exploited space behind their defence, setting up Suarez's equalizer.",Uruguay beat Canada 4-3 in a penalty shootout in the Copa America third-place playoff. Luis Suarez scored a last-gasp equaliser in the 92nd minute to level the score at 2-2.

East Bengal too good for Mohun Bagan in CFL derby,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/east-bengal-too-good-for-mohun-bagan-in-cfl-derby/articleshow/111719397.cms,"KOLKATA: As the East Bengal team bus was preparing to leave the Salt Lake Stadium, a middle-aged supporter, donning a red-and-gold bandana and waving the club’s flag, tossed a remark towards the players in an appreciative tone: “Thank you for bringing back the July 13 memory.”On this day 27 Julys ago, East Bengal rode a Bhaichung Bhutia hat-trick to brush aside Mohun Bagan 4-1 in the Federation Cup semifinal in front of more than 1.3 lakh people at the same venue.The CFL Premier Division derby was in no way a match to that monumental derby in 1997 given that the Big 2 now field their reserve teams in the local league and foreigners are barred from taking part in it.However, the East Bengal youngsters outrun and outclassed Mohun Bagan SG 2-1 in such a dominant show that Bino George’s side could have ended up winning by a bigger margin.This was East Bengal’s third win on the trot in the CFL while Mohun Bagan — having drawn their first two matches — remain winless.Following a barren first half, Vishnu PV and substitute Jesin TK scored in a span of 15 minutes to set up the platform for the red-and-gold’s win. Once East Bengal were reduced to 10 men in the 77th minute when defender Joseph Justin received a marching order for his second booking from referee Pranjal Banerjee, they were forced to take their foot off the gas. This was the period when Mohun Bagan exerted some real pressure on the rival box. Deggie Cardozo’s Bagan eventually found a goal in the fifth of the seven-minute stoppage time when Suhail Bhat flew his body in the air to meet Tyson Singh’s cross with an excellent header and beat East Bengal goalkeeper Debjit Majumder in the first post.But Suhail’s goal came more like an aberration in a contest where East Bengal looked proactive and Mohun Bagan more reactive. Cardozo employed a defensive set-up, the like of Glan Martins and Dipendu Biswas happy to sit back and soak up the pressure as East BengalHowever, Sayan Banerjee’s introduction in the second half tilted the game in East Bengal’s favour. Soon after Aman TK missed a sitter, Vishnu put them ahead in the 50th minute when he controlled a Sarthak Golui freekick inside the box with consummate ease and steered clear of Raja Basfore’s challenge before beating goalkeeper Raja Barman with a left-footer.Jesin’s arrival added more impetus to the attack and his first touch saw him fail to beat the goalkeeper from a one-on-one position.Bagan defence, however, soon wilted under East Bengal’s relentless pressure as Saurabh Bhanwala made a mess of a pass from his goalkeeper, as Aman snatched the ball from him and laid it off for Jesin to finish the move with a simple tap-in in the 65th minute.Stung by the reversals, Mohun Bagan tried to stage a comeback against a 10-man East Bengal and Suhail’s brilliance fetched them a goal. But it was too late and too little to prevent East Bengal from rightfully earning their derby spurs and staying perfect so far in the season.",Vishnu PV and substitute Jesin TK scored in a span of 15 minutes to set up the platform for the red-and-gold’s win. East Bengal were reduced to 10 men in the 77th minute when defender Joseph Justin received a marching order for his second booking from referee Pranjal Banerjee.

Match Prediction:

NEW DELHI: The 2024 UEFA European Championship , commonly known as Euro 2024, is approaching its thrilling conclusion. On Sunday, the Olympiastadion in Berlin will host the final match between Spain and England , following a month-long tournament that spanned the length and breadth of Germany.Spain and England have taken contrasting routes to reach the final.The Spanish team has been the tournament's standout performer, consistently delivering impressive displays that showcase their cohesion and well-defined playing style.In contrast, England has often appeared to be less than the sum of their individual talents, but their star players have managed to dig deep and secure the necessary results to reach their second consecutive European Championship final.In the semifinals, England delivered their most impressive performance of the tournament by a considerable margin. There is a growing sense of momentum and belief within the team, fuelled by their ability to secure late victories.Jude Bellingham's 95th-minute equaliser against Slovakia, the penalty shootout win over Switzerland and Ollie Watkins' 90th-minute winner against Netherlands have fostered a feeling that England might be destined to end their 58-year wait for a major trophy.The match against the Netherlands showed promising signs of England's attacking talents beginning to gel, with exciting combinations between Kobbie Mainoo, Phil Foden, and Bukayo Saka. Goalkeeper Jordan Pickford has once again elevated his game to new heights during the tournament, while Marc Guéhi has emerged as a key discovery in the heart of the defense.The anticipated return of Luke Shaw, a natural left-footer, for his first start of the tournament will provide better balance to the team compared to Kieran Trippier, who has been filling in at left-back or left wing-back.Despite the early rounds' challenges, manager Gareth Southgate appears to have found a measure of stability in his likely starting lineup.Spain have been the standout team at Euro 2024, winning all six matches, including victories against hosts Germany and pre-tournament favourites France in the knockout stages. They have scored the most goals (13), created the most chances (96), and played attacking football.Wingers Nico Williams and Lamine Yamal have added verticality to a previously possession-heavy side, allowing them to go direct and cause problems in transition while still managing the ball well. The team presses diligently, has a nice balance, and a clear idea of how they want to play. Rodri, who might be the Player of the Tournament, is crucial to their success.The Manchester City midfielder's Ballon d'Or shouts are growing, and if he performs well, Spain will likely win. Despite City's FA Cup final defeat ending a run of 74 games unbeaten for his club, Rodri has seamlessly transitioned back into winning habits with his country.Spain, initially considered outsiders, have proven their quiet optimism justified since opening with a 3-0 win against Croatia. They enter the final as favourites.Bukayo Saka's consistency and application are often taken for granted. The Arsenal winger was a menace against Switzerland, scoring a brilliant equaliser in the quarterfinal, and particularly impressive in the first half against the Netherlands. His tactical intelligence is crucial to England when they adopt a hybrid system, using a back five out of possession with Saka tucking in at right wing-back, then switching to a four-man defence with the ball as he pushes forward as a conventional winger. His one-on-one ability is unmatched by many, and he will relish the matchup against Cucurella.While Rodri, Yamal, and Williams are key players for Spain, England must also focus on Dani Olmo. The RB Leipzig forward started the tournament on the bench but seized his chance against Germany when Pedri was injured, scoring one and assisting the winner. He then scored the winning goal himself against France. Even as a substitute, he had been making an impact. Olmo has a tournament-high five goal contributions (three goals and two assists) and is given the freedom to roam between the lines in front of Rodri and Ruiz.The recent performances indicate that Spain merits being considered the favorites as they enter this match. England has demonstrated a knack for securing victories, and they may manage to do so once more.However, this encounter will undoubtedly present the most formidable obstacle they have encountered thus far in the Euros.Throughout the tournament, Spain has exhibited a remarkably higher standard of play compared to their opponents. Their consistent excellence suggests that they are well-equipped to pose a significant challenge to England's aspirations of progressing further in the competition.","Spain and England have taken contrasting routes to reach the final.

However, Patten and Heliovaara matched their opponents' level.The tiebreak initially favored Purcell and Thompson, who gained five set points due to errors from the British-Finnish duo. Nonetheless, Patten displayed composure under pressure, saving four of those set points.Purcell and Thompson managed to find their groove once again, clinching the set when Heliovaara's return landed just outside the court.The Australian duo continued their impressive serving performance in the second set, with their ace count rising. Patten and Heliovaara struggled to find a way to break their opponents' serve, and the set remained on serve until it reached 6-5.At 6-5, Purcell and Thompson had their first opportunity to break and win the championship on Heliovaara's serve. However, Patten came to his partner's aid at the net, hitting a brilliant volleyed winner to push the set into another tiebreak.In the tense tiebreak, Patten and Heliovaara managed to save two championship points, engaging in some nerve-wracking rallies. They eventually secured the second set, forcing a decider as the crowd erupted in cheers, leaving the Australians perplexed during the changeover.The final set saw both pairs holding their serves, with more extended rallies as neither team wanted to be the first to falter. In the end, the relatively unknown pair of Patten and Heliovaara emerged victorious, collapsing to their knees in celebration.","Henry Patten and Harri Heliovaara beat Max Purcell and Jordan Thompson 6-7(7), 7-6(8), 7 -6(11-9) in the men's doubles final at Wimbledon.

She had written a letter to the legend, narrating her dilemma. Should she pursue tennis and turn pro or should she go with academics?“Going to Jana, knocking on her door, giving her the letter, changed my life,” she said, awash in the light of the evening sun, holding the glittering Venus Rosewater Dish . “In that period, when I finished juniors, I didn't know what I should do, Jana told me I have the potential and that I should definitely turn pro.

And I wasn't really in good shape before that because I was injured and ill and I didn't really have a good beginning of the season. It's unbelievable now to be standing here, I have worked extremely hard for it .”Krejcikova, who came into the tournament, ranked 32 in the world, will return to the top-10 of the rankings on Monday.“It's unreal what just happened.

Deborah Jevans, a former pro, and chair of The All England Lawn Tennis Club, pointed out Novotna’s name.

NEW DELHI: 28-year-old tennis player Barbora Krejcikova clinched her second Grand Slam title by winning the 2024 Wimbledon women's championship, defeating Jasmine Paolini in a three-set match on Saturday.This victory adds a prestigious accolade to Krejcikova's already impressive career. Here, we delve into five notable aspects of Krejcikova's life and career:Krejcikova engages in a unique hobby off the court; she is an avid Lego enthusiast.Her collection includes intricate models such as the Milky Way and a figure of Dobby from the Harry Potter series. Krejcikova has expressed a desire to one day construct a Lego model of the Wimbledon Centre Court.""I have many of them actually. Yeah, I even received some from my team here. If there's one for me, I'll do that,"" said Krejcikova, as quoted by AFP.Krejcikova experienced a significant change in her professional support team. She parted ways with Ales Kartus, her coach who was instrumental in her 2021 French Open victory, in July of the previous year.Since then, she has been collaborating with Pavel Motl, a former schoolmate and occasional training partner, in a less formal coaching capacity.Motl, who hesitates to label himself as a coach, emphasizes the journey they are on together, rather than the conventional coach-athlete dynamic.""Bara was 10 and she played in the village where I live. She was playing on court number three and beat our adult neighbour 6-0, 6-0,"" Motl once said, recalling their first meeting.Krejcikova also opts for a non-traditional approach during tournaments, particularly at Wimbledon. For the past ten years, she has chosen to stay with a local family instead of at the official tournament hotels. This decision reflects her preference for a more relaxed atmosphere, a tradition she shares with her late coach, Jana Novotna, who also stayed with the same family and won Wimbledon in 1998. Krejcikova has publicly acknowledged the influence of Novotna, who passed away in 2017, on her career and approach to the game.""I remember thinking about her a lot,"" said Krejcikova. ""I have so many beautiful memories and when I step on the court I fight for every single ball as that is what she would want me to do.""Krejcikova has aspirations for the Paris Olympics, where she plans to team up with Katerina Siniakova in an attempt to defend their doubles title from the Tokyo Olympics. Despite a temporary split in their partnership, with Siniakova initially deciding to pair with another player, circumstances have led to a reunion for the Olympic games.From a young age, Krejcikova demonstrated a strategic approach to her tennis career, linking her participation in junior finals to the opportunity to miss school.""I always liked playing the finals at minor tournaments, because we played on Mondays and I didn't have to go to school. That was my goal for the weekend,"" she said.",Bara Krejcikova won the 2024 Wimbledon women's championship on Saturday. The 28-year-old Russian is an avid Lego enthusiast. She has been staying with a local family during tournaments for the past ten years. She plans to team up with Katerina Siniakova to defend their doubles title from the Tokyo Olympics.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111718042,imgsize-71344,width-400,resizemode-4/111718042.jpg"

I was lucky enough to get in there and watch an exciting game,' Rohit told Star Sports after witnessing Alcaraz's triumph over Medvedev.Watch:When asked about his prediction for the second semi-final match, Rohit acknowledged that Novak Djokovic would likely emerge victorious. However, he remained reluctant to pick a clear favourite for the Wimbledon final, stating, ""I think it is going to be Alcaraz and Djokovic, that's my guess, and I don't want to say who is going to win (in the final). I would say, 'May the best player win.' I don't want to pick sides because I myself have been in that kind of position where people are picking names or sides.

Explained: Why Wimbledon stopped using 'Miss' and 'Mrs' on winners' honour roll,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/wimbledon/explained-why-wimbledon-stopped-using-miss-and-mrs-on-winners-honour-roll/articleshow/111714272.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Wimbledon women's singles final is set to take place on Saturday at the All England Club , featuring Italy's Jasmine Paolini, the seventh seed, and Barbora Krejcikova, the 31st-seeded player from the Czech Republic.It is a surprising matchup, considering Paolini had never won a match on grass until this summer, and Krejcikova, at 28 years old, had been experiencing a series of first-round defeats throughout the season.Nevertheless, one of these two players will emerge victorious and have the honour of holding the Venus Rosewater Dish on Centre Court.It is inevitable that one of these two players will lift the title at the end of the day. However, unlike in previous years, female champions will no longer have "" Miss "" or "" Mrs "" inscribed on the winners' honour roll .In the past, it was customary for women players to have ""Miss"" or ""Mrs"" written on the winners' honour roll. However, the All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC) decided to modernize Wimbledon's honour roll by removing these titles from the names of female champions, starting from the 2022 edition.Historically, Wimbledon has recorded men's champions using just their first initial and surname, such as ""N. Djokovic"" for Novak Djokovic. Conversely, women's champions were listed with titles, such as ""Miss V. Williams"" for Venus Williams or ""Mrs. J.M. Lloyd"" for Chris Evert when she was married to John Lloyd. This practice extended to using a married woman's husband's initials and surname, an outdated tradition that persisted until 2022.The decision to change the honour boards is part of a broader push to modernize the tournament and ensure parity between male and female champions. The previous system has often been criticized as a reflection of Wimbledon being out of touch with contemporary values.In 2018, The New York Times highlighted the different ways umpires addressed male and female players. A year later, Wimbledon stopped using titles during match calls, referring to Serena Williams as ""Williams"" rather than ""Mrs. Williams.""The change has been welcomed by many who see it as a necessary step towards equality. Now, all champions will be recorded by their initials and surnames only, regardless of gender or marital status.",Jasmine Paolini and Barbora Krejcikova will meet in the Wimbledon women's singles final on Saturday. Paolini had never won a match on grass until this summer. The Italian seventh seed will hold the Venus Rosewater Dish on Centre Court.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111714255,imgsize-61124,width-400,resizemode-4/111714255.jpg"

set for a heavy mettle clash

LONDON: They'll use the court, every nook and corner of it, they're both highly ranked in doubles and angles come naturally to them. They'll own the net and paint the lines. Run a marathon in a match if need be. When the No.7 seed Jasmine Paolini lines up against the 2021 French Open champion Barbora Krejcikova in the Wimbledon final on Saturday, expect a fight.The Italian, 5 ft 4 in her tennis shoes, is in the form of her life, making successive Grand Slam finals, after making the second week of a major for the first time in January this year.This time Paolini, who will debut in the top-five of the rankings on Monday, will be determined to cross the finish line first. ""She's a Grand Slam champion, she plays unbelievable,"" Paolini said of the Czech, who beat her in their only previous meeting six years ago when they were both ranked outside the top-100.""The Wimbledon final will be a different kind of match. The goal is always the same: to try to serve well, try to return as many balls as possible and to control the point.""Paolini, whose mother Jacqueline Gardiner is from Lodz in Central Poland, and father Ugo is Italian, speaks three languages - Italian, Polish and English. ""Two Grand Slam finals in a row is crazy to believe no?"" Paolini said. ""I'm surprised at how I'm living this. Maybe on Saturday I will be nervous, I don't know. But now I feel relaxed. I'm the same person. I'm doing the same things. I'm surprised a little bit by how well I'm managing this.""Krejcikova's play is picking up speed again. Despite being a regular in the top-10 for long spells in the last few years, Krejcikova's charge to the Church Road final is as unexpected as her 2021 Roland Garros title run, when she was an unseeded player, ranked No.33. With injury and illness hindering her this year, the Czech came into Wimbledon with a 7-9 win-loss record.Krejcikova, who started the year ranked just inside the top-10, suffered a five-match losing streak in the middle of 2024, including an 0-4 record on clay.""I feel I had to improve everything, I definitely got better on faster surfaces,"" Krejcikova said of her game. ""I feel like I had to develop my game because everybody else is developing their game.""Krejcikova, looking to become the fourth Czech player to win Wimbledon in the Open Era after Jana Novotna, Petra Kvitova and Marketa Vondrousova, will carry the memory of Novotna, her mentor, onto Centre Court.

LONDON: Carlos Alcaraz didn't get off to the best of starts in the Wimbledon semifinals, but he finished in sparkling fashion. His shot-making rivaled the sun on an afternoon when the Centre Court roof was open, the Spaniard reveling in the elements to make his second successive final in Grand Slams this season and at SW19.In a last-four clash where tennis rivaled the theatre, Alcaraz scored a 6-7 (1), 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 win over Daniil Medvedev , closing in just under three hours to make his fourth major final.If Centre Court ever had a darling, it is Carlos Alcaraz. They worship Roger Federer , the presiding deity of these grounds, they backed Andy Murray passionately, it was his fortress, and they revered Serena Williams , but Alcaraz - school-boy charm and staggering craftsmanship - they just adore.The near-15,000 capacity was on their feet applauding effort when he sprinted around the court, yo-yoing from baseline to net and then back again before topping it with a tweener that lands just wide. In the fourth set when he patted a sitter into the net and then bent his head and covered his ears, the groan from the crowd was followed by a cheer, as if they were cajoling a child, who had grazed his knees.Alcaraz struggled with his serve in the first set, where Medvedev was clearly the better player until an incident threw him on the backfoot mentally.The fifth seed let out a string of expletives after chair umpire Eva Asderaki called a 'not up' against him in the ninth game of the opening set. Alcaraz continued playing, ripping one past Medvedev, but the chair umpire called the score, believing the ball had bounced twice before Medvedev picked it up.Television replays only extended the debate and the mercurial pro exploded. Asderaki called for the supervisor and referee, leaving her chair to consult with them. When she returned, she gave the No. 5 seed a code violation for unsportsmanlike conduct.Medvedev did well to pull himself together and close the set, but thereafter it was Alcaraz all the way. Alcaraz, who was doing really well until then in his on court exchange then turned to the Euros where Spain clashes with England in the final on Sunday. ""It's going to be a really good Sunday for Spanish people with the football,"" he said as boos went around. ""I only said it will be a good day, I didn't say Spain will win,"" he clarified.But no one was buying that.","Carlos Alcaraz beats Daniil Medvedev 6-7 (1), 6-3, 6-4,6-4 to reach Wimbledon final.

Maharashtra government

to make amends & announce reward to boost shuttler's morale before Paris Games

MUMBAI: Badminton player Chirag Shetty 's comments regarding Maharashtra government ignoring his achievements while rewarding cricketers from the state for winning the T20 World Cup have stirred up a hornet's nest.Chirag along with Satwiksairaj Rankireddy - the No.3 ranked men's doubles team in the world - played a crucial role in India winning their maiden Thomas Cup in 2022. Chirag, though, wasn't recognised for his effort. After seeing the cricketers being feted, the aggrieved shuttler told TOI on Sunday that ""if the state government can honour World Cup-winning stars, they should also honour him and treat other sports equally"".Besides the Thomas Cup success, Chirag has also won doubles gold at Asian Games , Commonwealth Games and bronze at World Championships. The 27-year-old Malad resident has now found support from prominent sportspersons of the city, who urged the state government to resurrect the situation by rewarding Chirag. Uday Pawar , coach and mentor of Chirag, felt that his ward's achievement is on par with that of cricketers and he should have been rewarded for it.Former India hockey captain MM Somaya said that he had sympathy for Chirag as ""winning the Thomas Cup is a truly historic achievement"". He went on to add that the state government can make amends by announcing a reward for him just before the Paris Olympics begin which will be good ""for his morale as well"".Pawar, a former Asian Games medallist and a prominent badminton coach in the city, said: ""I am not comparing sports but like the cricketers who have brought honour to Maharashtra, so has Chirag. I feel his achievement is on par (with the cricketers). A person who has brought honour to the state shouldn't be demanding but the state should recognise his efforts on its own.""He added that players shouldn't ask for recognition and instead the state government should have a mechanism in place where once they have achieved something of national significance, they should be rewarded.""I think the state's sports ministry should be more active. They should do their own homework and should be aware of who the top players from Maharashtra are. If they don't know about his/her achievement, then the ministry is not functioning properly. They should have people who will keep in touch with the respective associations from state and take updates on how their players are performing,"" said Pawar.Somaya said: ""I would fully agree with Chirag and I would quite understand his position. Since he was the only player from Maharashtra, he deserves the recognition. Need not be such a huge amount that they have given to cricketers but in some manner, he should be rewarded. He is seeking recognition from the state government which I think is only natural and I think it will be fair even if the state govt does it now. He is one of the key players from Maharashtra to participate in the Olympics and has a good chance of winning a medal with Satwik.""He also urged the state government to have a ""consistent policy"" to reward the performers from other sports as well. ""They should reward the players as soon as they know that someone from the state has achieved something big. It should be a standard process. A person shouldn't be applying for it. You should make a person feel a sense of pride when a state government recognises a player on their own,"" felt Somaya.","Badminton player Chirag Shetty's comments regarding Maharashtra government ignoring his achievements have stirred up a hornet's nest.
