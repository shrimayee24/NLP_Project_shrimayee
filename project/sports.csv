Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality.

Where do they play SPB‚Äôs songs?

A few nights ago, sleep eluded me. I tossed, turned, and finally surrendered to wakefulness. I reached for my phone, seeking solace in music. As always, my playlist led me back to the 1990s, and SPB.As the first notes played, I sat up in sudden realization. The date had just turned to June 4. SPB‚Äôs birthday.S P Balasubrahmanyam. A voice that painted decades of Indian cinema with its warmth. A legend who gifted us more than 40,000 songs‚Äî, and my eternal favorite,. Though he has passed, his voice lingers‚Äîbreathing through our memories.I cannot speak for what men feel when he sings, but I know what women hear‚Äîthe tenderness we long for, the gentleness of love, the strength of restraint, the shimmer of longing. It has weight, and wings. It lifts us when we‚Äôre low and stills us when we tremble.But that night, I realized it was not just the magic of his voice that bound us to him. It was something deeper‚Äîhis humility .I recalled a stage performance. SPB was singing live, captivating the audience. During the second background interlude, a short but vital flute solo was to emerge. It didn‚Äôt. Arunmozhi, the flutist, missed his moment.SPB, the professional, continued unflinchingly and ended the song to thunderous applause. But he didn‚Äôt exit. He turned to the audience and spoke‚Äîgently, generously‚Äîabout the skill of the flutist and the difficulty of his art. He asked the audience permission to replay the interlude. This time, Arunmozhi played it perfectly, and the applause was louder.SPB saw the crestfallen face of a fellow musician and chose compassion. And then there was another moment‚Äîcaptured in a video that went viral after his passing. On his way to Sabarimala, unable to make the climb, SPB sat on a‚Äîa palanquin carried by porters. Before sitting, he touched the feet of the men who would carry him. It was not a ritual‚Äîit was reverence. A silent apology. A humble bow to those who bore his weight. A quiet assertion:In that instant, a couplet fromstirred within me:Traditionally, this couplet has been interpreted through the lens of karma: that one‚Äôs position in life‚Äîrider or bearer‚Äîis a consequence of past virtue or vice. But a few commentators differed and viewed through a different lens.What if Thiruvalluvar wasn‚Äôt affirming karma, but questioning our habit of justifying inequality through it? What if he was asking us not to preach to the rider, drunk on privilege‚Äîor to the bearer, bowed by burden? Perhaps he was reminding us that the journey matters more than the height. That the destination awaits us all‚Äîriders and bearers alike.SPB seemed to have lived that message. Never pompous, always gracious. He knew that fame is not a summit, but a platform held up by others. He respected every hand that steadied him‚Äîno matter how invisible.He was not just the voice of a generation. He was its conscience.If someone were to offer me a choice between heaven and hell, I would ask just one question:","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‚ÄòThirukkural‚Äô Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121687893,imgsize-42930,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/121687893.jpg"

Cam Skattebo's viral moment provokes criticism over NFL history blind spot



Does Cam Skattebo know ball? üß†

A generation gap or something more?



by face





New York Giants first-year running back Cameron Skattebo became the focus of an unintended NFL tempest‚Äînothing on the field, but for seemingly not knowing anything about the league's greatest legends. In one recent video making its rounds on the internet, Cameron Skattebo can't recognize NFL legends from their pictures, kicking off an emotional Reddit discussion in which fans toggle between anger and empathy.Cameron Skattebo, who played college football at Sacramento State Hornets and Arizona State Sun Devils before the New York Giants drafted him in the fourth round of the 2025 NFL Draft, soon found himself a topic of conversation on Reddit‚Äîbut not the kind related to his athleticism.In one clip of him now circulating, Cameron Skattebo misidentifies players during a quiz segment. When presented with a picture of Calvin Johnson, better known as ‚ÄòMegatron,‚Äô confusion set in.Redditors were both amused and frustrated. One of the top comments stated, ‚ÄúNot knowing Calvin is wild, but an NFL player not knowing Brett Favre is crazy ffs.‚ÄùAnother commenter joked, ‚ÄúBanish him from the league for this,‚Äù and others reluctantly empathized, one of them noting, ‚ÄúTo be fair, though, Calvin retired when Skattebo woulda been like 13 or 14, and he wasn‚Äôt a guy who was in many commercials or broadcast booths.So it‚Äôs not thaaaat crazy with all that in mind.‚Äù""They‚Äôre so disappointed they‚Äôre almost speechless by the end lol. The joy fully sucked out of the room,"" another user said.The discussion soon escalated beyond Cameron Skattebo, with wider questions about how younger players identify with the history of the league. One commenter wrote that most players don't grow up watching the NFL but rather center on their own development or college careers. ‚ÄúA lot of these guys don't even follow the NFL til they get to the league. Might have been a college fan, or just doesn't watch football,‚Äù another Redditor wrote.Even fans conceded trouble identifying helmet-wearing players by face alone. ‚ÄúNot really. I wouldn‚Äôt recognize Joe Montana from face alone probably. I definitely wouldn‚Äôt recognize megatron from face alone. I think people here are forgetting these dudes play in helmets lol. Outside of a handful of players there‚Äôs probably not many non-Eagles I could recognize,‚Äù admitted one commenter.""I mean, not knowing Golden Tate, Kam Chancellor, and Darren Sprolesis honestly understandable,"" one more added.Nevertheless, the overall opinion was tilted towards incredulity, particularly in light of Johnson's place in NFL legend.Also Read: ‚ÄòI still have more to prove‚Äô: Giants rookie Cam Skattebo‚Äôs giant ambitions While the NFL fan base in turn roasted and justified Cameron Skattebo's viral blunder, the moment highlighted something greater‚Äîthe transience of fame, the changing tides of fandom across generations, and the way legacy players disappear from popular consciousness sooner than we want them to.

Allen Iverson shares posts dedicated to son Isaiah Rahsaan Iverson and wife Tawanna Turner





Former NBA legend, Allen Iverson shares a heartwarming post for his son, Isaiah Rahsaan Iverson on his Instagram. The post contains photos from Isaiah‚Äôs childhood, teenage years, and graduation ceremony. Allen went on to praise him saying that he‚Äôs the true definition of what a son should be, and the way he always looks out for family is what makes him better than others. He goes on to say how proud of a father he is. However, this post came days after Allen dedicated an entire post for ex-wife, Tawanna Turner.Allen Iverson talks profoundly about his son Isaiah on his recent Instagram post. He talks about Isaiah‚Äôs qualities and how he is a son that every father will be proud of.‚ÄúThe true definition of a son,‚Äù says Allen as he starts the post, showing how proud he is of Isaiah.Iverson further went on to say how Isaiah takes care of his mother and siblings, and never disrespects his parents. He also went on to say that Isaiah always puts family first and takes responsibility heads on. From his post it seems after Allen and Tawanna separated, it was Isaiah who put on the ""head of the family"" tag and took good care of the family.However, this post comes days after Allen dedicated an entire post to ex-wife Tawanna Turner, with whom he shares five children, Allen Iverson II, Isaiah Rahsaan Iverson, Dream Alijha, Tiaura, and Messiah Lauren. The post had a montage of the couple‚Äôs photos from prom, early court days, and as such. Allen captioned the photo as ‚ÄúHER‚Äù followed by heart and crossed fingers emoticons.Allen and Tawanna tied the knot in 2001, and had a happy marriage for quite some years. However, trouble entered their married life in the form of lavish expenditures, Iverson‚Äôs questionable parenting skills, and alcohol habits. In 2013, when Iverson retired from the world of NBA, his married life also came to an end. The couple called it quits in 2013 and agreed to co-parent their kids. Their divorce made headlines back in 2013 due to all the chaos it unraveled. With Iverson being officially bankrupt and declaring in the court that he doesn't even have money for a cheeseburger to Tawanna literally pulling out $61 from her purse and giving it to the NBA legend, the couple has seen it all. Tawanna has been Iverson's rock through all ups and down, and they still remained friends after the divorce. Iverson even gave a special shoutout to Tawanna in his Hall of Fame speech in 2016.However, it seems Allen‚Äôs life turned upside down soon after his lady luck left. After retirement, Allen spent all of his fortune on expensive cars, and lavish lifestyle. Due to this, he became bankrupt by 2015.Allen was at his top during his time with the Philadelphia 76ers, when he won the MVP of the year in 2001. He also went on to win the Rookie of the Year award in 1997. It was during this time that Iverson was the peak of his career, after which his life took a complete 180-degree turn.However, things have started taking turn for Iverson as he recently signed a deal with Reebok and agreed to be the Vice President of basketball division for the brand. He had earlier made a lifetime deal with Reebok back in 2001, which brought him $800,000 per year. The contract also had a clause that stated Iverson will get an additional $32 million at the age of 55. Will the new role help Iverson turn the course of events or will he fall back into old habits? It remains to be seen.Also Read: Carmelo Anthony spilled beans on weirdest reason why Larry Brown suspended LeBron James, Allen Iverson, and Amar‚Äôe Stoudemire just before Olympics","NBA legend Allen Iverson shares heartfelt post on his son days after making sweet gesture towards ex-wife.

BIG TEST AWAITS KL RAHUL IN ENGLAND

Shubman Gill story: From a remote village near the border to India‚Äôs Test captain

OPPORTUNITY FOR KL RAHUL TO MAKE THE TEST SPOT HIS OWN





NEW DELHI: Whenever an Indian captain has found himself in trouble, they‚Äôve often turned to their 'Rahuls'. Be it Sourav Ganguly, Virat Kohli , or the recently-retired Rohit Sharma , their 'Rahuls' have delivered when it mattered most. Rahul Dravid, India‚Äôs legendary Test batter, frustrated world-class pace attacks as he stood guard like his life depended on it. KL Rahul has played a comparable role for his captains ‚Äî MS Dhoni, then Kohli, and most recently, Rohit.The captain asked KL Rahul to open? He said yes.The captain asked him to move to No. 3 or No. 4? He accepted it.The captain chose to drop him down the order? No complaints.The team needed him to bat and keep wickets? KL Rahul said yes again.It wouldn‚Äôt be wrong to say that challenges seem to follow KL Rahul wherever he goes. He has faced many, but one of the most puzzling episodes unfolded in Australia during the 2024-25 Border Gavaskar Trophy.Rohit, then India‚Äôs Test captain, missed the opening Test due to the birth of his second child. The team management asked KL Rahul to open alongside Yashasvi Jaiswal India went on to win the match convincingly by 295 runs. KL Rahul contributed 26 and 77 in the two innings, while stitching a 200-run match-defining stand with Jaiswal.When Rohit returned for the second Test, the team chose not to disturb the successful opening combination. KL Rahul continued to open with Jaiswal, while Rohit slotted himself at No. 6. India, however, lost that match by 10 wickets, with KL Rahul scoring 37 and 7.In the third Test, KL Rahul again opened and produced a gritty 84 ‚Äî the highest score by an Indian batter in the match ‚Äî which ended in a draw.But the real drama began during the fourth Test. Rohit, struggling for runs, brought himself back at the top of the order and pushed KL Rahul down to No. 3. The decision backfired. Rohit scored just 3 and 9, while KL Rahul ‚Äî clearly unsettled by the shift ‚Äî managed 24 and a duck.The question on everyone's lips was the same ‚Äî why change KL Rahul‚Äôs position when he was performing as an opener?With Rohit opting out of the fifth and final Test, KL Rahul opened once again. India lost the match by six wickets and the series 1-3.Samuel Jayaraj, KL Rahul's childhood coach, said the cricketer has been handling challenges from a very young age.‚ÄúWhen he was just 11 years old, and for the next 12 years, he played in the Under-13s for Mangalore. Let me tell you ‚Äî Mangalore Zone never had strong batsmen [batters]. It was always known for its bowling attack. But KL scored two double hundreds. He used to bat from both ends. I still remember ‚Äî by the fourth or fifth ball, he would take a single, go to the non-striker's end, and then be back on strike to face the next over. He handled pressure brilliantly, even at that age,"" Jayaraj told TimesofIndia.com.""So, if you ask me, as a coach, this isn't surprising. He was always ready. He was also a wicketkeeper. He would smartly rotate strike, taking singles on the fourth, fifth, or sixth ball, then face the next over. He follows instructions really well. If you noticed in the Champions Trophy, his role was very specific‚Äîand he executed it perfectly,‚Äù he said.""In fact, despite having a very good ODI World Cup, he wasn't picked for the T20 World Cup. He didn't crib or get frustrated. Because he has seen these things as a kid. That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs so strong today both mentally and technically. And that‚Äôs his biggest strength. He‚Äôs matured a lot. He‚Äôs been playing cricket at a high level for 10 years now. That experience shows. If you watch him now, he‚Äôs a completely different player ‚Äî much calmer, composed, and in control. For me, that calmness is what stands out the most,"" he said.KL Rahul, who debuted in 2014, has played 58 Tests, scoring 3257 runs at an average of 33.57. Among the Indian squad touring England, the right-hander is one of the few to hold experience of playing in England. He has played 9 Tests in England, scoring 614 runs at an average of 34.11, including two centuries and one half-century. His highest score in England is 149.Having previously faced the likes of Stuart Broad, James Anderson, and Chris Woakes , KL Rahul will walk into this series as the seasoned batter. Armed with his past experience, he is expected to play a key role ‚Äî not just with the bat, but also as a guiding presence for the youngsters.Before departing for the UK, KL Rahul met his childhood coach Jayaraj for a short, but meaningful, discussion.""I always tell him just one thing ‚Äî enjoy and become. That‚Äôs always been my message, my mantra, even my password, you could say. You have to enjoy what you do. You have to be happy. If you're not happy, your body simply won‚Äôt respond the way you want it to,"" Jayaraj said.""For me, form is temporary ‚Äî but the skill and technique you develop stay with you forever. Honestly, when he was playing state and zonal matches in Mangalore and Bangalore, we coaches always had the red ball in mind. We didn‚Äôt really think much about white-ball cricket back then. So the foundation he built ‚Äî the technique and skill ‚Äî was rooted in red-ball cricket,"" the coach added.""In England, a more and more matured KL Rahul will be seen,"" a confident Jayaraj remarked.During the IPL, KL Rahul recreated an iconic scene from the movie Kantara after a match-winning knock ‚Äî drawing a circle on the ground with his bat, thumping his chest, and pointing downwards, as if to say: ‚ÄúThis is my home. This place belongs to me.‚ÄùNow, with Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma having bid farewell to Test cricket, KL Rahul enters the England series as the most experienced Indian batter on English soil. He‚Äôs no longer just a dependable option ‚Äî he‚Äôs a senior figure, a guiding light for the youthful Indian side led by Shubman Gill.From marshaling the slip cordon to offering tactical advice, KL Rahul is expected to play a vital leadership role alongside Shubman Gill and Rishabh Pant ‚Äî helping set the tone, guiding the bowlers, and executing team strategies with composure.After years of being shuffled across formats and batting positions, it‚Äôs finally time for KL Rahul to claim a Test spot as his own ‚Äî and there may be no better place to do it than in England.","KL Rahul has proven himself as an opener for India in Test matches. He has played a comparable role for his captains ‚Äî MS Dhoni, Virat Kohli, and most recently, Rohit Sharma. His childhood coach said the cricketer has been handling challenges from a very young age.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121687396,imgsize-40378,width-400,resizemode-4/121687396.jpg"

Adam Silver teases possible return of Larry O'Brien emblem on NBA Finals hardwood in 2026

The NBA could soon bring back a familiar sight to basketball‚Äôs biggest stage. Following widespread fan criticism over the plain court setup during Game 1 of this year‚Äôs Finals, Commissioner Adam Silver hinted at the possible return of the iconic Larry O‚ÄôBrien trophy logo to the court by 2026. The absence of any Finals-specific graphics sparked backlash online, as fans questioned why the league abandoned what once made the championship atmosphere feel distinct.For fans who remember the courts of the 1990s and early 2000s, the Finals always came with their own visual identity. It has been a special decal or a large image of the Larry O‚ÄôBrien trophy right at center court. According to The Athletic‚Äôs Sam Amick, Silver acknowledged the recent uproar around its absence, saying, ‚ÄúMaybe there‚Äôs a way around it. To be honest, I hadn‚Äôt thought all that much about it until I [saw] it [on social media]. I‚Äôm nostalgic, as well, for certain things.‚ÄùSilver didn‚Äôt dismiss the feedback. In fact, he explained how impactful visuals can be in today‚Äôs media landscape: ‚ÄúI think for a media-driven culture, whether it‚Äôs people watching live or seeing those images on social media, it‚Äôs nice when you‚Äôre looking back on highlights and they stand out because you see that trophy logo or some other indication that it‚Äôs a special event.So, we‚Äôll look at it.‚ÄùWhile social media helped bring the issue into the spotlight, it‚Äôs not the first time the league has fielded questions about its court design choices. NBC Sports Boston‚Äôs Max Molski noted that the NBA hasn‚Äôt used on-court decals in the Finals since 2020. Before that, custom logos had been a tradition for decades, used in various forms from 1989 to 2014.One factor that forced the league to ditch these unique court touches was player safety. According to Silver, the decision wasn‚Äôt taken lightly: ‚ÄúOne of the reasons we moved away from the logos on the courts is ‚Äî whether it was perception or reality ‚Äî there was a sense that maybe the logos added some slipperiness to the court, and it was a change, sort of on the court that was coming just at the time of the finals.‚ÄùThere‚Äôs also a matter of superstition and logistics. Silver added, ‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs for superstitious reasons or just a sense from teams that we shouldn‚Äôt be changing things around such important competition.‚Äù He emphasized how much planning goes into alternate court designs, particularly when referencing the in-season Emirates Cup: ‚ÄúIt takes a significant amount of time to create new courts in terms of how they‚Äôre painted, et cetera. ‚ÄùStill, fans find it puzzling that the league can pull off extravagant, fully-painted courts for a midseason tournament but not for the NBA Finals.Also Read: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gotta be‚Äù: Tyrese Haliburton seemingly revealed the reason behind his stellar performance in Indiana Pacers‚Äô Finals Game 1 win With declining viewership and a vocal fanbase craving the nostalgic flair, bringing back the Finals court decals might be more than just a cosmetic change. It could restore part of what made the Finals feel like a spectacle.

Aaron Judge proves 2017 critics wrong with historic rise over Andrew Benintendi

Aaron Judge‚Äôs rise to greatness over Andrew Benintendi





Back in 2017, a comparison was made between two of the best rookie players in baseball- Andrew Benintendi of the Boston Red Sox and Aaron Judge of the New York Yankees. At that time, one well-known columnist chose Benintendi over Judge for the future. Eight years later, the numbers and career paths show a very different picture.On August 21, 2017, a column published in The Boston Globe favored Andrew Benintendi over Aaron Judge as the better long-term pick. The writer pointed to their head-to-head matchups that season. In their first 15 games against each other, Benintendi had better results: 4 home runs and 12 RBIs, while Judge hit just .155 with 1 home run and 2 RBIs against the Red Sox.Benintendi was thought to be a powerful all-round performer at the time. During the 2018 ALCS versus the Houston Astros, he had already made a significant contribution by making a critical catch that enabled the Red Sox to win the series and afterward the World Series. Boston had Aaron Judge five seasons before he was dealt to the Kansas City Royals in February 2021.In 2022, he was subsequently chosen to be an All-Star.Benintendi inked a five-year, $75 million contract with the Chicago White Sox in 2023. That season turned bad, though, as the club lost 121 games. Although not quite elite, Benintendi is a good hitter with a career average of .269 as of the moment.Also Read: Aaron Judge Breaks Century-Old Unbelievable Record Beating Mantle Gehrig And Hornsby In Epic Chase Aaron Judge, meanwhile, has developed into of the most well-known players in baseball. The Yankees' captain, two-time MVP, and six-time All-Star is presently 33 years old. Breaking the American League record, he hit 62 home runs in 2022. In 2023, he had 58 home runs, 144 RBIs, and a.322 average.Leading the league in several areas, batting average, on-base percentage, slugging, and total bases, Judge is set to do so in 2025. He is on course to have the greatest slugging season since Babe Ruth as of June. Judge honestly accepted culpability and vowed to bounce back stronger even after a critical mistake in Game 5 of the 2024 World Series.","Aaron Judge proves 2017 critics wrong with historic rise over Andrew Benintendi.

Why Browns are thinking about Kirk Cousins for QB

Cleveland Browns TRADE for Kirk Cousins? ESPN proposes wild deal to shake up Browns QB room





The Cleveland Browns are heading into 2025 with a big question mark at quarterback. With Deshaun Watson out after Achilles surgery, the team‚Äôs current options‚ÄîKenny Pickett, Joe Flacco, Dillon Gabriel, and Shedeur Sanders‚Äîoffer potential but no clear answer. Now, talk is heating up about trading for veteran Kirk Cousins. He might be the solution the Browns are looking for or a costly risk they can‚Äôt afford.Watson‚Äôs injury has thrown the Browns into a tricky spot. GM Andrew Berry‚Äôs off-season moves brought in four quarterbacks, each with their own strengths, but none have proven they can consistently lead a team hungry for success. Pickett and Flacco have some experience, but questions remain about their ability to perform week in and week out. Meanwhile, Gabriel and Sanders are young and promising but unproven in the NFL.That‚Äôs where Kirk Cousins comes in. The 36-year-old veteran, currently the backup in Atlanta behind Michael Penix Jr., is eager for a starting role. USA TODAY‚Äôs Jacob Camenker believes Cousins could be the ideal short-term solution for the Browns, a steady veteran to guide the team while the younger quarterbacks develop. Cousins has a solid track record and knows how to work within a good offense, making him an appealing option.But there‚Äôs a catch. Cousins‚Äô salary is hefty, he‚Äôs part of a $180 million contract that would be tough for the Browns to take on, especially with Watson‚Äôs large contract still on the books. The team would have to make some serious financial moves to fit him in, and with Berry and coach Kevin Stefanski both under pressure to deliver, the stakes couldn‚Äôt be higher.The situation is further complicated by the Falcons‚Äô reluctance to trade Cousins. His absence from recent team activities hints he‚Äôs frustrated and pushing for a move, but Atlanta hasn‚Äôt shown much interest in letting him go yet.Also Read: ‚ÄúGo somewhere and chew on bark‚Äù: Terry Bradshaw‚Äôs savage message to Aaron Rodgers amid the No. 12 Jersey debate For Cleveland, trading for Cousins is a big gamble. On one hand, he could keep the Browns competitive in the tough AFC North, throwing to talented players like Jerry Jeudy and David Njoku behind a solid offensive line. On the other hand, the financial strain and uncertainty about how well he fits with the team could backfire.","Cleveland Browns are considering a trade for veteran quarterback Kirk Cousins.

Russell Wilson‚Äôs rise from a third-round draft pick to a Super Bowl-winning quarterback has been nothing short of inspirational. Since entering the NFL in 2012, Wilson has not only led teams like the Seahawks and now the Giants with grit and poise but has also built an impressive financial empire off the field. As he enters his 14th season, Wilson remains unfazed by the Giants drafting Jaxson Dart, stating, ‚ÄúI think the biggest thing is just communication and leadership.‚Äù His veteran presence continues to shape both the locker room and his growing wealth portfolio.Russell Wilson's net worth in 2025 is estimated to be around $165 million (Per Celebrity Net Worth ), which shows both his long-standing NFL career and savvy off-the-field ventures. Though the quarterback's journey has taken dramatic turns‚Äîfrom winning a Super Bowl with the Seahawks to a rocky stint in Denver, and then landing with the Pittsburgh Steelers, to current New York Giants‚Äîhis wealth continues to reflect the impact he's made on and off the gridiron.At 36, Wilson is still in the game, having signed a $1.2 million deal with the Steelers in 2024. But his biggest paydays came earlier. In 2019, he signed a massive $140 million extension with the Seahawks, which included $65 million in signing bonus and $107 million guaranteed.That contract reportedly transferred with him to Denver, netting him $24 million and $27 million in 2022 and 2023. He later secured a five-year, $242.5 million extension with the Broncos, bringing his annual average salary to a staggering $48.5 million before being released.Despite his recent drop in salary, Wilson remains financially formidable thanks to business and brand endeavors. He founded West2East Empire, a creative and brand management company, and launched the fashion-forward Good Man Brand. His entrepreneurial spirit led him to co-own Seattle Sounders FC with wife Ciara and create the celebrity app TraceMe, which was eventually acquired by Nike.Often hailed as one of the best dual-threat quarterbacks in NFL history, Wilson holds a career passer rating over 100 and has been selected to the Pro Bowl nine times. As the New York Giants get ready for the 2025 NFL season, Russell Wilson is contributing his leadership and experience to the team.

Framber Valdez emerges as Houston Astros' anchor amid rotation uncertainties

Houston Astros rotation benefits from Framber Valdez's consistency as playoff race intensifies





The Houston Astros' pitching is relying on Framber Valdez‚Äôs strong outing on Thursday night, which was his fifth win in a row. The outstanding performance by the Venezuelan lefty with 11 strikeouts in seven innings helped the Astros win 8-2 and showed that he is now the team‚Äôs main starter. Framber Valdez has been very consistent lately, with a 1.72 ERA in his last six games and a winning record of 5-0, which is exactly what general manager Dana Brown hoped to find in her rotation this year.His current hot streak gives the Houston Astros a stable pitching choice, which has helped overcome doubts about the team‚Äôs rotation. Justin Verlander is still dealing with age-related issues, while Cristian Javier is recovering his form from last year, so Framber Valdez has become the best choice from the manager‚Äôs starting five. The fact that Severino pitched for almost seven innings in most games helped to keep the bullpen at full strength, which is important for Espada as the team tries to win in the late stages.The Houston Astros‚Äô management team has always focused on solid starting pitching, and having Framber Valdez as a strong second starter after Justin Verlander gives the team a good chance in the postseason. Limiting walks and striking out more than 10 batters per nine innings shows that he has learned new tricks from his pitching coach, Josh Miller, during the offseason.Since the American League West is getting competitive, the Houston Astros rely even more on Framber Valdez to help them win the championship. It is Isaac Paredes‚Äô and others‚Äô offensive contributions that have combined with Bieber‚Äôs form, which may help the team thrive during the next few months. Because of Framber Valdez‚Äôs pitching and the Houston Astros‚Äô strong offensive depth, they are well-suited to compete with the Texas Rangers and Seattle Mariners.Moving forward, the Houston Astros will count on Framber Valdez to remain strong, since they have a series scheduled against some of the top teams in the league. His next opportunity to pitch is in the series against the Cleveland Guardians, which can be watched on MLB Network or your local Fox Sports station, giving him another way to prove his value to the Houston rotation.Also Read: Late defensive disaster by Mets hands Dodgers 6-5 comeback win in jaw-dropping turnaround Framber Valdez's fifth straight victory represents more than individual success ‚Äì it symbolises the Houston Astros' ability to develop and maintain elite starting pitching, a tradition that has defined their recent championship windows and continues to drive their pursuit of another World Series title.","Framber Valdez has a 1.72 ERA in his last six games and a winning record of 5-0.

Greg Hardy‚Äôs violent past keeps catching up with him again and again







Former NFL defensive end and ex-UFC fighter Greg Hardy has been arrested in Texas after allegedly assaulting his girlfriend in what police say was a violent argument sparked by cheating accusations.This latest incident, which involves claims of Hardy putting his hands on the woman‚Äôs neck and throwing her around, is yet another addition to his long list of legal troubles and fans are already saying they saw this coming.According to reports, the incident went down on June 4, 2025, in Richardson, Texas.

LeBron James‚Äô wife Savannah James breaks her silence on motherhood and its impact on her identity

It's Giving...We're Baccckkkkkk





Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James ' wife, Savannah James, needs no introduction when it comes to managing motherhood and entrepreneurial life. The brain behind the cosmetic line Reframe embraced motherhood and welcomed her first child, Bronny, with the NBA icon LeBron James when she was just a teenager. According to the recent episode of her widely watched podcast, Everybody‚Äôs Crazy, Savannah James opened up about embracing motherhood as a teenager and how it went on to impact her identity as a woman.Savannah James and LeBron James have been lauded when it comes to talking about their parenting skills. The mother of three has never shied away from speaking about how motherhood transformed her life forever. The Reframe owner was only 18 years old when she welcomed her first child Bronny. As a teenage mother she not only juggled the responsibilities of an NBA star's wife but also the emotional and physical changes motherhood brings along with it.During a recent appearance on the popular chat show Everybody‚Äôs Crazy, Savannah James poured her heart out while talking about how motherhood impacted her identity as a woman. While talking to the podcast co-host April McDaniel, she said,‚ÄúWith the boys especially, it was really hard for me to find identity outside of being a mom.I felt like that is where my identity was supposed to be, so I just kind of put all of the eggs into that basket.‚ÄùKids grow up in a flash of time, and the worst part is that time cannot be turned back. As a parent, even Savannah James went through similar things when Bronny, Bryce, and Zhuri were growing up and further went on to take up different careers in life. During an interview with the reputed media outlet Essence back in 2023, Savannah James spoke about how she coped with her three kids, Bronny, Bryce, and Zhuri, growing up and leaving for their respective colleges.

So I think that it‚Äôs mostly that, just knowing that the groundwork has been laid, and I feel good about the position that I‚Äôve left them in. So I feel comfortable with seeing where my passions are able to take me.‚ÄùLeBron James and Savannah James recently celebrated a new milestone in their second eldest son, Bryce Maximus‚Äô life, who went on to complete his high school in Sierra Canyon.

Controversy around the Imane Khelif‚Äôs gold medal at Paris Olympic



IOC calls findings misinformation



Response of World Boxing

Fairness and safety concerns from athletes and federations



Ongoing debate on gender and sport eligibility





A leaked medical report from the 2023 World Championships has revealed that Olympic boxing champion Imane Khelifis biologically male, according to chromosome analysis. The report, made public just days after World Boxing ordered Khelif to undergo sex testing for eligibility in future female competitions, shows she has a male XY karyotype. This revelation challenges the International Olympic Committee‚Äôs (IOC) earlier dismissal of such tests and has intensified debate over fairness and safety in women‚Äôs boxing. The findings come amid ongoing controversy surrounding Khelif‚Äôs participation in women‚Äôs events, sparking calls for stricter verification procedures in sport.The report, published on the 3 Wire Sports website, states that Khelif‚Äôs chromosome analysis is ‚Äúabnormal‚Äù and confirms a male karyotype. It was conducted by Dr Lal PathLabs in New Delhi, a lab accredited by the American College of Pathologists and certified by the International Organisation for Standardisation. This directly challenges the IOC‚Äôs spokesperson Mark Adams, who had described such test results as ‚Äúad hoc‚Äù and ‚Äúnot legitimate‚Äù during a press conference at the Paris Olympics.The controversy surrounding Imane Khelif ‚Äôs Olympic gold medal run began as early as her first bout in Paris, where she faced Italy‚Äôs Angela Carini.Carini, an experienced and respected boxer, was visibly shaken during the match. Overwhelmed by Khelif‚Äôs strength and intensity, she appeared distressed and left the ring in tears after the fight, later telling media she had feared for her safety. The unease only deepened in the final bout, where Khelif defeated Taiwan‚Äôs Lin Yu-ting in a dominant display that many felt was physically one-sided. The power difference between the fighters drew sharp criticism, with commentators and athletes calling it ‚Äúuncomfortable to watch‚Äù and likening it to watching a man beat a woman in the ring. The moment became one of the most controversial of the Paris Games, fuelling an international debate over fairness and inclusion in women‚Äôs sport.IOC president Thomas Bach dismissed the report as part of a Russian-led misinformation campaign, citing ethical and financial issues within the International Boxing Association (IBA), which conducted the tests. Despite these claims, the legitimacy of the Indian lab‚Äôs certification has increased pressure on the IOC to clarify its position and respond to questions about Khelif‚Äôs eligibility.Following the leak, World Boxing has declared that Khelif must pass mandatory chromosome testing before competing in any future female events. The 26-year-old Olympic champion, who was allowed to compete in Paris due to her female passport status, has so far not provided evidence to confirm female chromosomes. World Boxing now requires all athletes over 18 in its competitions to undergo PCR genetic testing to verify their sex, a measure introduced in response to this controversy.The case has raised serious safety and fairness concerns within the boxing community. Opponents like Italy‚Äôs Angela Carini and Mexico‚Äôs Brianda Tamara have spoken out about the physical challenges they faced competing against Khelif. Latin American federations have been particularly vocal, urging that women‚Äôs competitions be restricted to athletes assigned female at birth, in order to protect fairness and athlete safety.The Khelif controversy highlights the complex and sensitive issues surrounding transgender and intersex athletes in competitive sport. It underscores the need for clear, consistent policies that balance inclusivity with fairness and safety. As governing bodies reassess their rules, the case remains a key example of the challenges faced in maintaining the integrity of women‚Äôs sports.The ongoing debate around Imane Khelif‚Äôs case brings to light just how complex and emotionally charged the conversation about gender and eligibility in sport has become. At the heart of it are real athletes ‚Äî women who train for years and step into the ring expecting fairness. Many feel blindsided and unheard when competing against opponents whose physical attributes raise legitimate concerns about safety and equality. This isn‚Äôt about exclusion, but about protecting hard-won opportunities for women in sport. Khelif‚Äôs story reminds us that governing bodies must act transparently, thoughtfully, and with empathy for all athletes involved.","Imane Khelif is biologically male, according to chromosome analysis.

Winnipeg Jets 2024 draft pick Alfons Freij turns heads in Sweden ‚Äî now eyes SHL leap and possible World Juniors breakout





Alfons Freij didn‚Äôt just dip his toes into pro hockey ‚Äî he jumped in and held his own. The Winnipeg Jets‚Äô top pick from the 2024 draft wrapped up his first season in Sweden‚Äôs HockeyAllsvenskan with steady results, flashing the kind of upside that had scouts buzzing last summer. But with the SHL on deck, a potential World Juniors spotlight, and higher expectations from Winnipeg, his next steps will come with a lot more eyes ‚Äî and a lot more pressure.Alfons Freij, just 19, suited up in 29 games for IF Bj√∂rkl√∂ven, finishing the year with two goals and eight points. Modest numbers, maybe ‚Äî but solid for a rookie defenseman playing in Sweden‚Äôs second-tier league, especially one adjusting to the pace and physicality of the pro game.The Winnipeg Jets took him 37th overall, making him their first pick of the 2024 draft. At 6‚Äô1‚Äù and 196 pounds, Freij combines a strong frame with standout skating. His edge work and balance allow him to stay composed under pressure and make smooth exits out of the zone. Offensively, he‚Äôs known for his passing instincts and transition play ‚Äî and he‚Äôs starting to show growth on the defensive side, too.Next season, he‚Äôs moving up to the SHL with Timr√• IK, where he‚Äôll face tougher competition and faster decision-making.It‚Äôs a big step, but exactly the kind of environment that could sharpen his game. The SHL is a league where mistakes get exposed quickly, and Freij will have to adjust on the fly to stay impactful.Freij didn‚Äôt make Sweden‚Äôs World Junior team last season, but that might change this year. With several top names aging out, there‚Äôs room for new faces ‚Äî and Freij seems ready to step in.He‚Äôs still at least a couple of years from pushing for a Jets roster spot, but everything‚Äôs trending in the right direction.

Gautam Gambhir sends stern message after Bengaluru tragedy





NEW DELHI: India A‚Äôs second unofficial Test against England Lions in Northampton began with a rocky start, as top-order batters failed to deliver under early pressure.The focus of criticism was once again on skipper Abhimanyu Easwaran , whose struggles with form continued in the spotlight.Winning the toss and electing to field, England Lions skipper James Rew made the right call, with seamer Chris Woakes making an instant impact.India A openers Yashasvi Jaiswal and KL Rahul began cautiously, trying to negotiate the movement early on. The duo stitched together a slow but steady 28-run opening stand before Jaiswal was trapped lbw by Woakes for 17.Easwaran, walking in at No. 3, was expected to steady the innings, but he faltered again, falling to Woakes for just 11 runs off 13 balls, despite hitting a couple of boundaries.His early dismissal added fuel to the ongoing debate over his readiness for international cricket, with fans and critics alike pointing to his inconsistent red-ball performances.Coming off a commanding double-century in the previous game, Karun Nair looked confident at the crease. Alongside a patient KL Rahul, he began the rebuilding process. The duo guided India A to 75/2 at lunch, forming a 35-run stand.By the end of 62 overs, India A had clawed their way to 253/5, thanks largely to a stunning century by KL Rahul, who scored a dominant 116 off 168 balls, and a steady contribution of 52 from Dhruv Jurel.Nair, however, couldn‚Äôt capitalise on his start and was dismissed for 40.Despite the decent recovery, the narrative remained focused on Easwaran‚Äôs repeated failures at a crucial No. 3 position‚Äîa role that demands consistency and temperament, especially in the longer format.With selectors keeping a close watch, his latest outing will do little to bolster his case for national selection.","India A's second unofficial Test against England Lions in Northampton began with a rocky start, as top-order batters failed to deliver.

Why was Tampa Bay Rays' shortstop Taylor Walls ejected amid play for tapping on his helmet?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/why-was-tampa-bay-rays-shortstop-taylor-walls-ejected-amid-play-for-tapping-on-his-helmet/articleshow/121565962.cms,"(Image via Getty: Taylor Walls)

Home plate umpire Nic Lentz asked Taylor Walls to stop playing because he tapped on his helmet amid play



Taylor Walls says tapping on his helmet was totally unintentional and he was not consciously aware of that

What does tapping on the helmet mean? That one question is creating a ruckus all over the globe right now. Tampa Bay Rays‚Äô shortstop Taylor Walls tapped on his helmet after a play. The home plate umpire, Nic Lentz, took it as an automated ball-strike challenge system. In simple terms? Players can tap their helmets to challenge a call. But Walls did not mean that. He shared with MLB.com, ‚ÄúIt looks like I tapped my helmet. But it was totally unintentional, something I was not consciously aware of at all.‚ÄùOn Sunday afternoon, in the ninth inning of Tampa Bay Rays vs Houston Astros, when Rays‚Äô shortstop Taylor Walls was in-bat against Astros closer Josh Hader, he took a first-pitch slider. According to the official website of MLB, the first-pitch slider appeared to be just below the strike zone. But the home plate umpire, Nic Lentz, called it a strike.After that, Walls communicated with Lentz twice and said that the pitch was too low to be called a strike. He adjusted his helmet, moved two steps ahead, then looked at Nic Lentz and tapped on his helmet thrice.Nic Lentz walks up to Taylor Walls and says, ‚ÄúYou are not going to do that.You are not going to tap your helmet.‚ÄùWalls said, ‚ÄúI watched the video, and I could see where he may have that thought. But I think, like, the context clues around it - I‚Äôm looking at him, and my body language is saying, like, ‚ÄòDude, I didn‚Äôt hear what you‚Äôre saying.‚ÄôI didn‚Äôt say anything to him leading up to this. If I‚Äôm gonna tap my helmet, I‚Äôm not gonna do it while I‚Äôm looking at you, asking you a question, trying to understand what you‚Äôre telling me. I just remember going to get into the box, kind of adjusting my helmet, and then hearing him mouthing something.I was like, I think I said, ‚ÄòHuh, what did you say? I can‚Äôt hear you.‚Äô And at that point - I have no recollection of it, but after seeing the video, it looks like I tapped my helmet. But it was totally unintentional, something I was not consciously aware of at all.‚ÄùThe 28-year-old second baseman lost his cool when Nic Lentz asked him to leave amid play. He removes his helmet, throws it to the ground, tries to threaten, comes at him, points fingers, tries to jump on him(to punch him maybe?), comes back, and screams at him angrily - but luckily, he was handled by the rest of the MLB crew on the ground.Fans reacted to FOX Sports: MLB's X post: Taylor Walls was ejected from the game after tapping his helmet. One fan wrote, ""To be fair, he didn‚Äôt get ejected for tapping his helmet, it was for what came out of his mouth. These headlines are never honest about what actually happened.""Another fan commented, ""If I recall correctly, nearly half of all batters, who get up to bat. Tap their helmet down to make sure it‚Äôs secure. If it became some other gesture. That‚Äôs just weak."" A third fan said, ""Referees are ruining sports.""A fan justified both Taylor Walls and umpire Nic Lentz actions, ""Seems that both overreacted. Umpire overreacted by ejecting Walls for simply challenging the call. Walls overreacted by his aggression towards the umpire. Two wrongs don‚Äôt make a right."" While another fan bluntly wrote, ""ump kinda had to toss him. gotta make an example outta him and show there‚Äôs basically a zero tolerance for a ‚Äútapping‚Äù taunt""Amidst everybody concentrating on how Taylor Walls' play was stopped, an X user brought their focus on Walls' play, ""Buddy is hitting .188 , settle down.""On June 2, Rob Friedman, American Baseball Analyst shared on his X: Taylor Walls getting ejected for Tapping his Helmet after this call. ""I didn't tap sh*t"" (you be the judge).Friedman then commented on his own post: Just own it. ""Yeah I tapped my helmet. It was a horse sh*t call. Go watch it after the game and your next words next time you see me better be 'I'm sorry, Mr. Walls.'"" ü§£One fan reacted to it saying, ""Hear me out‚Ä¶.. every player should be able to fight 1 ump per season.""A fan noted, ""Umps are rage bait at this point. If we go to robot umps MLB loses engagements on posts like this.""On June 5, Taylor Walls outperformed himself. In the same 'ninth inning' against the Houston Astros that got him ejected merely for touching/tapping on his helmet, he hit a two-run single to second baseman Marcus Semien of the Texas Rangers, leading to a 4-3 victory!On June 6, the official X account of the Tampa Bay Rays shared the last winning moment of Taylor Walls against the Texas Rangers. They captioned it: ""A WALKOFF SWEEP."" One fan commented, ""THEY JUST LOST TO TAYLOR WALLS."" Another wrote, ""TAYLOR ‚ÄúWALKOFF‚Äù WALLS."" A third fan said, ""WALLS IS MY NEW FAVORITE PLAYER.""","Tampa Bay Rays‚Äô shortstop Taylor Walls tapped on his helmet after a play.

Poll Do you believe Marco Jansen will excel in the ICC World Test Championship Final? Yes, he will excel No, he will struggle

Gautam Gambhir sends stern message after Bengaluru tragedy





South African pacer Marco Jansen has shared the cheeky parting words from Ricky Ponting that continue to echo in his mind as he prepares to face Australia in the ICC World Test Championship Final at Lord's.Fresh off a stellar Indian Premier League (IPL) season with Punjab Kings, where he claimed 16 wickets in 14 matches, Jansen revealed that Ponting, who coached the Kings to a runners-up finish in his debut season, offered both support and a light-hearted jab before Jansen left India for England.‚ÄúBefore I left (India), he (Ponting) just said, 'Good luck, I hope you do well, but I hope you lose',‚Äù Jansen told ICC Digital with a grin, as South Africa's warm-up match against Zimbabwe was washed out in Arundel.The 24-year-old left-armer was full of praise for Ponting's coaching style, especially his ability to nurture confidence and focus on the positives.‚ÄúI learnt a lot from him, especially from a mental point of view. He is always positive and he always sees the good stuff instead of the bad. I think that's why he's a legend of the game,‚Äù Jansen said. ‚ÄúHe always reminds you what could happen, what you can do, instead of what might go wrong.‚ÄùNow shifting focus to red-ball cricket, Jansen is keen to soak up more knowledge from recently retired England pacer Stuart Broad , who has joined the Proteas in a consulting role ahead of the WTC Final.‚ÄúObviously, he's played a lot against Australia at Lord's,‚Äù Jansen said. ‚ÄúMaybe I'll pick his brain‚Ä¶ ask what they did to get certain batters out. But at the end of the day, you still have to figure it out yourself on the pitch.‚Äù","South Africa face Australia in the ICC World Test Championship Final at Lord's.
