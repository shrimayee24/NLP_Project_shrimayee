"New weight-loss drugs work, but require long-term use: Doctor",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/new-weight-loss-drugs-work-but-require-long-term-use-doctor/articleshow/125448310.cms,"You have watched the evolution of weight-loss drugs through five decades of practice. Did you think they would emerge as such blockbuster drugs?

But there are concerns about their side-effects…

The experience in the West has shown that almost 50% of the patients stop the drug after a year or so. Why does this happen?

New weight-loss drugs came to India only recently. What can we expect next?

What are the points to consider before taking up weight-loss drugs?

If you start taking the new weight-loss medications, be ready to stay with it for a long time, says Dr V Mohan, Chennai-based senior diabetologist who has worked extensively on the epidemiology and genetics of the disease. Excerpts from his chat with TOI, which is partnering with Novo Nordisk India to spearhead the ‘Choose Your Weight’ campaign, which aims to change the narrative around obesity.Q:A: Efforts to develop effective weight-reduction medicines have been on for decades. In the late 80s and 90s, drugs such as sibutramine, phentermine and orlistat were introduced that facilitated modest weight loss of 1kg or 2kg, and rarely around 5kg. Some of these drugs had major side-effects and were eventually banned. We, as physicians, began to lose hope that any drug would come along that could offer significant weight loss without significant side-effects.Then, we started getting drugs such as the GLP-1 receptor analogs (GLP-1RAs). Exenatide was the first; it came from the venom of a Gila monster in South America, and ensured significant weight loss than earlier drugs.Initially, we didn’t know how they worked, but they delayed gastric emptying and increased insulin release and glucagon reduction... They work through the potentiation of certain hormones in the intestine called GLP, the glucagon-like peptide. Researchers tried to make glucagon-like peptide itself, but it was very short-acting in the body. So, they started producing GLP-like substances.Exenatide was followed by liraglutide. We found these mainly anti-diabetic drugs offered a two-in-one response by helping people reduce weight. Not everyone responded the same way; some had both weight reduction and HbA1c reduction, others had only one; a small percentage had neither.Then came semaglutide, which took the world by storm. Semaglutide was a weekly injection marketed as Ozempic for diabetes and Wegovy for weight loss. It got approved in the US separately for weight loss and diabetes, marking the first time an anti-diabetic drug was used solely for weight loss. It became a blockbuster drug with billions in sales, and millions started using it due to its unprecedented weight loss results, often 10-15 kg. The drug became so popular that it was hard to find, and new factories had to be built to meet the demand. Celebrities started using it, and before-and-after pictures were circulated widely. They were sold on the black market. This kind of success story with any drug had never been seen in the history of medicine.Q:A: These drugs, including liraglutide and exenatide, work on the stomach, causing nausea initially. They must be started at a small dose and gradually increased to minimise side-effects. After four to eight weeks, side-effects such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhoea usually settle.Stomach paralysis is a rare side-effect. Another rare but serious side effect is blindness due to anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. One in 7,000-10,000 people who take these drugs can go blind. Such rare side-effects will surface only when millions start taking a drug. It’s like the Covid vaccination: as mass vaccination was carried out, we saw side-effects. We don’t know why those idiosyncratic reactions occur, but we must remember there’s no big FDA warning so far. Clearly, its benefits far outweigh the risks.Q:A: Cost is a disadvantage, especially since there are no generic versions. The other reason is “plateauing”. After a patient loses 10kg, 15kg or 20kg, the drug’s effect plateaus off. In trials, those who stopped taking the drug started gaining weight. In one year, they regained 50% of the weight they lost. In practice, the minute people’s weight starts plateauing after taking the drug for a year or so, they stop as they don’t want to spend money on a drug that has seemingly stopped working.People think diet and exercise will help them, but obesity is complex. It’s not just calories in, calories out. If that was the case, there would be no need for these drugs. All these years people have been trying to lose weight but failed because of the brain: when one starts losing weight, the brain realises that you lost weight and immediately corrects itself trying to regain your weight. The point is that one needs to continue taking the drug to stay on that plateau.Q:A: In India, we were waiting for semaglutide and tirzepatide to become available. The injectable forms were delayed until recently, but by March 2026, the patent for semaglutide will expire, allowing generic versions to enter the market. There are over 20 companies that plan to make generic versions available.Companies are now developing a third drug, retatrutide, which targets three hormones: GLP, GIP, and glucagon. It’s in late stages of development and shows promise for even greater weight loss.These drugs offer numerous benefits beyond weight loss, including reduced risk of heart attack, improved kidney function, and potential cognitive benefits. They also help reduce snacking and other addictions, like smoking. One of my patients who was asked to undergo bilateral knee replacement decided to go on weight-loss medication first; he lost 20kg and didn’t need replacement as the knee pain vanished.Q:A: One has to consider that when one loses 10kg, it’s not 10kg of fat. It’s 7kg of fat and 3kg of muscle. That means from the little muscle you have, 3kg is going to go. Hence, people get ozempic facies with muscles gone… As your strength will be reduced, one needs to increase protein intake, do some weight training and muscle strength training.","If you start taking the new weight-loss medications, be ready to stay with it for a long time, says Dr V Mohan, Chennai-based senior diabetologist. Semaglutide, which took the world by storm, was a weekly injection marketed as Ozempic for diabetes and Wegovy for weight loss.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125448603,imgsize-861116,width-400,resizemode-4/representative-image.jpg"

The police has arrested two men after recovering from a drain, parts of 15 skeletons of girls and boys behind an industrialist's house. The caretaker of the house Subhash alias Surendra reportedly told the cops he had been sexually abusing and strangulating his victims before disposing of their bodies in the drain.

The Culmination

The painful truths

Investigative systems can fail, especially when constrained by corruption, negligence, or lack of urgency.

Evidence matters, but how it's collected — and whether due process is followed — can make or break a case.

Confession is a double-edged sword: powerful, but only if obtained fairly and documented properly.

NOIDA/NEW DELHI: For years, the narrow lanes of Nithari whispered the same story: children vanished, one after another, swallowed by a darkness no one could name.Inside D-5, where life seemed ordinary from the outside, investigators later uncovered fragments of a nightmare scattered through drains, courtyards and rooms that refused to give up their truth.Two decades on, Nithari remains less a crime scene and more a wound — a place where every unanswered question still walks the streets.The Nithari case remains one of country's most chilling and controversial serial-killing episodes. It centers around Bungalow D-5 in Nithari village, Noida and involves two men — the homeowner, Moninder Singh Pandher and his domestic helper, Surinder Koli The macabre tale that unfolded over years involved skeletal remains in drains, allegations of rape, murder, necrophilia, and organ trading — and a deeply flawed investigation that has haunted the judicial process for nearly two decades.The nightmare began in May 2006, when Nand Lal , father of a 22-year-old woman named Payal (also known as Deepika), reported her missing.Payal had visited Pandher’s bungalow D-5 in Sector 31, Nithari, allegedly to talk about a job for her brother — but she never returned.It was later reported that Koli had called her from a public phone booth.Despite the serious nature of the disappearance, the police response was strikingly delayed.According to a former investigator (then sub-inspector, later DSP), no FIR was registered for months.It was only after a court application under Section 156(3) of the CrPC, filed by Nand Lal, that an FIR was formally lodged on October 7, 2006 — nearly five months after Payal vanished.Things took a horrifying turn on December 29, 2006, when investigators discovered eight skeletal remains in a roadside drain next to the D-5 bungalow.This grim find, lead to the arrest of both Koli and Pandher. Within days, more bone fragments were unearthed in and around the drainage system.The discovery shook the nation and exposed the full extent of what had been a series of missing persons — children and young women — in and around Nithari.The initial investigation by the Uttar Pradesh Police came under criticism almost immediately. According to the first investigator, crucial delays had allowed the case to spiral: The FIR was filed only after months of pressure, and formal search operations began six months too late.These early lapses, he said, sowed the seeds of deeper problems.By January 10, 2007, due to mounting public outrage and the scale of the horror, the case was handed over to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).Within days, CBI teams conducted intensive searches around the bungalow and adjoining areas, recovering more human remains — skulls, bone pieces and dismembered body parts.The sheer scale of recovered remains made it difficult even for the investigators to determine how many victims there might have been.In the early months of the investigation, charge sheets were filed in 16 cases, spanning accusations of murder, rape, abduction, criminal conspiracy, destruction of evidence and more.On March 1, 2007, Koli made a highly detailed recorded confession.He reportedly admitted to murdering six children and one woman. He described luring them into the bungalow, strangling them, sexually abusing the bodies, dismembering them and discarding the remains in drains.He also made claims of cannibalism, stating that he sometimes cooked and ate flesh from the victims.The case proceeded in a special CBI court in Ghaziabad, and on February 13, 2009, both Koli and Pandher were sentenced to death in the first case.The trial court would go on to deliver verdicts over many years, across multiple hearings, more than 2,000 hearings were held during this prolonged trial.Koli was eventually convicted in 13 cases by the trial court and awarded death sentences in all, though one of these was commuted to life imprisonment.In a later case (May 2022), a special CBI court awarded him another death sentence for the rape and murder of a woman.While the trial court’s judgments were gruesome and seemed to close the case, the story was far from over.On September 11, 2009, the Allahabad high court delivered a big verdict: While upholding Koli’s death sentence, it acquitted Pandher in at least one prominent case, citing “no evidence” against him.Over time, Koli’s legal team mounted a fierce appeal. On October 16, 2023, in a landmark decision, the Allahabad high court acquitted Koli in 12 of the death-sentence cases and Pandher in two, overturning the trial court’s verdicts.The court did not mince words: It stated that the investigation had been botched up and that “basic norms of collecting evidence were brazenly violated.”A particularly scathing point in the high court’s judgment was the failure to probe possible organ trade — an angle raised by a high-level committee from the Ministry of Women and Child Development.Investigators, the court said, “opted for the easy course” by pinning blame on Koli and demonising him, instead of exploring deeper and more alarming conspiracies.The court also questioned the credibility of Koli’s confession. It noted procedural irregularities: the confession was allegedly recorded 60 days into police remand, yet there was no medical examination or independent witness.Moreover, the court highlighted contradictions in prosecution testimony about where and when the confession was made.Recovery of skeletal remains, according to the court, came from a drain outside the boundaries of Pandher’s house — not from inside, as had often been claimed.Ultimately, the court declared that the guilt of Koli and Pandher had not been proved beyond reasonable doubt, particularly because the case rested largely on circumstantial evidence.The judgment drew sharp criticism from victim families, who saw it as a deep betrayal after nearly two decades of pursuing justice.Following the high court’s 2023 acquittal, Moninder Singh Pandher was released from Luksar Jail on October 20, 2023, after spending 14 years behind bars.Surinder Koli, meanwhile, was not immediately freed — he continued to serve a life sentence in a separate conviction.But his legal fight was not over.In July 2025, the Supreme Court upheld the Allahabad HC’s acquittal of Koli in the 12 previously overturned cases. The apex court ruled that police lapses had rendered crucial evidence inadmissible.Then, on November 11, 2025, in a decisive moment, the Supreme Court accepted Koli’s curative plea (his last judicial recourse), acquitted him in the final pending case (Rimpa Haldar case) and ordered his immediate release.The man once dubbed the “Nithari killer” has now been acquitted in all major Nithari murder cases.When word of his acquittal reached his barrack, Koli had remained seated for some time, staring at the floor. Then a faint smile crossed his face. “He was relaxed, and there was a smile on his face,” a senior jail official told TOI.While Koli did give a detailed confession, the courts later scrutinised the conditions of its recording, It came long into police custody, without independent witnesses, and with no medical examination — casting shadows on its voluntariness and authenticity.Perhaps most damning was the court’s assertion that organ trade – a horrifying, but plausible, motive – was not properly probed.The investigation, according to the HC, seemed to choose the less difficult path of blaming a single man rather than confronting possible organised crime.One sacked officer, Simranjeet Kaur was arrested by the CBI in 2007 for allegedly framing false records to protect Pandher and Koli, having received payments.The mysterious death of a key witness, Jatin Sarkar, whose daughter was among the missing. His body was later found in a pond in Bengal.Parents of missing children watched as time passed with no clear answers. The high court’s 2023 acquittals were met with “dejection” by many, signaling that legal closure did not equal emotional closure.The community around Nithari, once traumatised by the gruesome revelations, still remembers the D-5 bungalow as a somber landmark.The Supreme Court’s acquittal in the 13th, and final, case against Koli left the families devastated.A 63-year-old Jhabbu Lal and his wife Sunita (60) continued seeking justice for their daughter Jyoti — one of the children who went missing in 2006 and was later found among the Nithari victims.“I had six children, and the fifth was Jyoti. She went missing in 2006,” Lal recalled, his voice shaking. “Her body was later found in the drain outside house number D5 (Moninder Pandher's bungalow where Koli worked).”Lal spent decades fighting in courts, selling valuables and even a house in Sangam Vihar, Delhi, to fund the case.Lal said, “If he didn’t commit the crime, then who did? If he is freed, that means someone else killed our children. Why was Koli kept behind bars for so many years?”Sunita Lal added, “Even after all these years, the pain hasn’t faded. Every time I pass that bungalow, it feels like I’m standing at the same place where my world ended. We never got our child back — only the memories and a lifetime of waiting for justice.”Another mother of a deceased said ""Moninder (Moninder Singh Pandher) and Surinder Koli, killed so many children. But the case is not being done anything about. Who is guilty now? Was there a ghost in that house which killed all children? They used to kill children and indulge in organ trafficking. Now they say that they are innocent. Law is letting them go; God won't.""When the Supreme Court finally granted his curative petition in November 2025 and ordered his immediate release, it marked the end of a long, fraught journey.The ruling underscored deep flaws in the original investigation: procedural lapses, contested confessions and weak evidence.Moninder Pandher, too, walked free earlier when the high court acquitted him.It was noted that during his release in October 2023, Pandher was frail, battling health issues including tuberculosis.The bungalow D-5, once infamous, now lies overgrown and decaying — a ghostly testament to the violence that took place there.Even when courts finally render a verdict, emotional justice may remain elusive for victims and their families.The Nithari killings case, is more than a crime story; it is a mirror to systemic failures, a cautionary tale about investigative hubris, and a study in how the quest for justice can stretch over decades.The courtroom battles — convictions, acquittals and final release — have reshaped public memory of D-5 bungalow.But the wounds remain: for the families who lost children, for a village scarred by horror, and for a nation forced to reckon with how easily its systems can be outpaced by darkness.","Nithari case remains one of country's most chilling and controversial serial- killing episodes.

Insult meted out to my sister is intolerable: Tej Pratap

PATNA/NEW DELHI: RJD patriarch Lalu Prasad's daughter Rohini Acharya's outburst at her brother Tejashwi Yadav and his close associates for ""abusing"" and ""throwing"" her out of home is snowballing into a full-blown family feud and hints at increasing internal rumblings over the decisions of the party's anointed heir after its bid for office unravelled spectacularly in the assembly polls.As she dropped another bombshell on Sunday by saying she was dissed for donating her ""dirty kidney"" to Lalu and was accused of extracting crores of rupees and a Lok Sabha ticket, three of her sisters - Ragini, Chanda and Rajlakshmi - left their parents' Patna residence.Their brother Tej Pratap Yadav, disowned by his father and ousted from the party last year, spoke up against Rohini's ""humiliation"".Lalu, his younger son and political heir Tejashwi and other family members have maintained silence, an indication of the division and conflicted emotions within. The party too has kept mum.Some party leaders suggested that differences among the siblings have long been simmering as Tejashwi took firmer control of the party and leaned on a set of advisers loyal to him to run its affairs. That arrangement has come up for questioning.But the Bihar assembly poll debacle has opened up this style of functioning to questioning. Rohini said everybody is wondering what fate has befallen RJD, a party that governed Bihar between 1990 and 2005.Tej Pratap said in a social media post, ""Yesterday's incident has shaken me. But the insult meted out to my sister is intolerable.""I tolerated whatever happened to me but her humiliation cannot be tolerated under any condition... The consequence of this injustice will be very dire.""He accused 'Jaichands' (betrayers), widely believed to be a reference to a couple of Tejashwi's close associates, including Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Yadav, of targeting the Yadav family. Appealing to Lalu, he said, ""Just one nod, and the people of Bihar will bury these Jaichands themselves. This fight is not for any party; it is for the honour of the family, the dignity of the daughter, and the self-respect of Bihar.""As the family fallout played out, TV footage showed three more daughters of Lalu's reaching Patna airport with their children to catch a flight, reportedly for Delhi. None of them spoke to the media. Incidentally, their departure came hours after Rohini advised women to ""look after your in-laws and families and take care of your children"" rather than parents.""I would tell all married women never to do anything to save their parents, and if they have a brother, they should ask him to donate his own kidney or ask his Haryanavi friend to do so,"" she said in an emotional post. She said she had committed a blunder by not obtaining permission from her husband and in-laws and not thinking about the future of her three children before donating a kidney to her father.Earlier, she alleged she was humiliated and abused, and a slipper was lifted to hit her. She said her parents, Lalu and Rabri Devi, both former CMs, were crying and blamed Sanjay Yadav and Rameez Nemat Khan, who hails from Uttar Pradesh and is said to be Tejashwi's friend, for her ""fate"".She named her brother too but directed most of her anger at his two associates.The developments followed RJD's disastrous performance in the just-held assembly elections in Bihar, in which the party could win only 25 seats after contesting 143. Tejashwi was officially projected as MGB's chief ministerial candidate.Meanwhile, the JD(U) asked Lalu to explain the developments and act. ""She is the daughter of entire Bihar, then why are you silent, Lalu ji... Please break your silence,"" JD(U) spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said.","Rohini Acharya's outburst at her brother Tejashwi Yadav is snowballing into a full-blown family feud.

4 of 5 Bihar seats with max & min SIR deletions won by NDA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/4-of-5-bihar-seats-with-max-min-sir-deletions-won-by-nda/articleshow/125446144.cms,"Nitish Kumar To Take CM Oath For Record 10th Time At Patna's Gandhi Maidan, PM Modi To Attend

NEW DELHI: Though a push from women supporters on account of incentives, including a Rs 10,000 transfer in their bank accounts, was a big factor in NDA's landslide win in Bihar, the alliance wasn't the only beneficiary of high participation in the polls by women. AIMIM walked away with three of the five seats with the highest women voter turnout - namely Kochadhaman, Baisi and Amour - indicating that the correlation between women turnout and electoral outcome was not always straight. AIMIM's total tally was 5 seats. JDU, meanwhile, won in Thakurganj assembly constituency (AC) where 90% of the women turned up, while BJP was the victor in Pranpur, which saw 89% women turnout.The special intensive revision (SIR) exercise in Bihar, conducted amid resistance from the opposition led by Congress, saw NDA parties winning four of the five seats that accounted for the maximum as well as minimum deletions of electors in SIR. Significantly, Congress, with an overall tally of six seats, won Kishanganj despite the AC having recorded the fifth highest deletion among the state's 243 ACs, as well as Chanpatia, which saw second lowest deletion.As per Bihar poll datasets released by EC on Wednesday, BJP won three of the five seats with the highest net deletions - Gopalganj, Purnia and Motihari - followed by JDU, which won Kuchaikote. As regards the five ACs with the least net deletions, BJP and LJPRV won from two each. The datasets linking SIR and poll outcome, thus, do not fit into a pattern. Even so, the four seats (of total five) with the maximum and minimum deletions bagged by NDA are proportional to its overall 83% share in Bihar's 243 seats. Four of the five ACs with the maximum additions made to the Bihar electoral roll between Sept 30 and Oct 20 (the last date of nomination for Phase 2) are now represented by NDA parties, with BJP having its candidates elected from Nautan and Tarari, JDU from Thakurganj, Congress from Araria, and LJPRV from Chenari. The seats that saw the least number of additions to the roll in this period are now represented by JDU, BJP and LJPRV. Among the five seats with the highest winning margin, JDU won in Rupauli and Gopalpur, BJP in Digha and Aurai, and LJPRV in Sugauli. The list of top five ACs with the lowest victory margin includes Sandesh and Nabinagar won by JDU, Ramgarh won by BSP, Agiaon by BJP and Dhaka won by RJD.Congress won from Manihari (ST), the last among the five ACs that clocked the highest male polling percentage. BJP won two of the seats with the highest male voter turnout and three with the lowest male turnout. JDU and LJPRV each bagged one of the five seats with the highest and lowest male polling percentage.Kasba, which recorded the highest total polling percentage at 81.9%, ended up in LJPRV's kitty, Barari and Thakurganj ACs went the JDU way with 81.7% and 81.6% polling, respectively, while Congress bagged Kishanganj with the fifth highest overall turnout of 80.2%. BJP won four of the five seats with the lowest polling percentage - namely Kumhrar, Bankipur, Digha (all in Patna) and Biharsharif - even as JDU bagged Nawada.","AIMIM walked away with three of the five seats with the highest women voter turnout.

ISRO Makes History As ‘Bahubali’ Rocket Places India’s Heaviest Communication Satellite In Orbit

BENGALURU: Scientists at Isro ’s Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) have captured new images and spectra of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it moves out of the inner Solar system after its recent perihelion passage.Using PRL’s 1.2m telescope at Mount Abu, researchers observed the comet between Nov 12 and 15. The images show a near-circular coma, the cloud of gas and dust that forms around a comet’s nucleus when solar heating causes surface ices to sublimate.“In the present geometry, any dust tail would lie behind the comet relative to the Earth, while deeper multiband images could reveal the ion tail,” Isro said.Ahead of morning twilight, the team also recorded a spectrum of the comet’s light. It showed clear emission features associated with Solar system comets, including CN, C2 and C3 bands at shorter wavelengths.“Researchers calculated the production rates of these molecular emissions, which describe how much gas is released from the nucleus into the coma. For 3I/ATLAS, the values are around 10²⁵ molecules per second. The ratios of these rates place the object among the ‘typical comets’ of the Solar system despite its interstellar origin,” Isro said.PRL’s Mount Abu telescope, situated at an altitude of 1,680m near Gurushikhar, supports studies ranging from exoplanets to high-energy sources. The team plans further observations as 3I/ATLAS moves into darker skies.","Scientists at Isro ’s Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) have captured new images and spectra of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS.

Hailee Steinfeld’s bold Governors Awards gown sparks wild pregnancy theories

Hailee Steinfeld is no stranger to turning heads on a red carpet, but her appearance at the 2025 Governors Awards sent the internet into full detective mode. The singer-actress, who attended the Los Angeles event alongside her husband and Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen, arrived in a sculptural Stéphane Rolland gown that instantly became one of the most talked-about looks of the night.While the ceremony was packed with standout fashion moments, Steinfeld’s choice stole the spotlight and not entirely for the reason she may have expected. Within minutes, fans began circulating theories about whether the exaggerated silhouette of her dress was hiding something more personal than couture design intent.Hailee Steinfeld stepped out in a greyish-brown gown featuring shimmering details near the knee and a dramatic, structured feature around the waist that resembled a soft, rounded bump. The ambitious mermaid cut, combined with the bold waist embellishment, opened the floodgates to speculation about whether the couple might be expecting.Fans didn’t hold back. “Is Hailee Steinfeld pregnant?” one wondered, while another joked, “Unclear what this dress is going to be, ruffles, mermaid, or latest in maternity wear.” Others took it further, asking, “Not to be that person, but is she pregnant because this is giving a hidden pregnancy dress?” One viewer even declared, “This couture is the kind you wear to hide a baby bump,” as another chimed in, “If ever a dress said ‘I’m trying to hide a pregnancy’ this is it.” Some fans, meanwhile, leaned into hopefulness rather than snark, writing, “I hope there’s a baby bump under that dress.”Steinfeld has not responded to any of the chatter, instead focusing publicly on a different celebration: hosting Thanksgiving festivities with Allen. Earlier this month, she shared a heartfelt post about their Friendsgiving gathering, revealing how much the couple enjoys preparing meals together.“We love cooking together, so instead of doing a potluck, Demitri and I challenged ourselves to make everything at home,” she wrote. She detailed their prep routine, emphasizing how they prepped most dishes in advance so they “weren’t stuck in the kitchen missing the party.”Whether her Governors Awards look was simply avant-garde fashion or something more symbolic, one thing is clear , Hailee Steinfeld knows how to keep the NFL world talking.Also Read: Cardi B and Stefon Diggs’ newborn already flashing Patriots pride as rapper shares first photos from the hospital","Hailee Steinfeld's bold Governors Awards gown sparks wild pregnancy theories.

Gisele Bündchen emphasizes her graciousness towards Brady, highlighting her focus on authenticity and fulfillment in her new chapter...

Gisele Bündchen's shifting balance between support, career and self-fulfillment

Moving from high-stakes partnership to reinventing life on her own terms





In her March 2023 interview with Vanity Fair, supermodel Gisele Bündchen opened up about her 13-year marriage to former NFL quarterback Tom Brady, how their lives evolved, and what she discovered in the space that followed. While details of their split had played out in headlines, Bündchen offered fresh context and a more nuanced perspective.Gisele Bündchen admitted that the marriage was “like a death and a rebirth,” and described her own shift from supporting a partner’s career to rediscovering her personal dreams. Her reflections reveal not just a high-profile breakup, but a woman reclaiming her voice and defining success on her own terms.When Gisele Bündchen met Tom Brady at age 26, she said she was, “so ready” for family and partnership. Traditionally one of the world’s highest-earning models, she gradually scaled back her runway work after 2015 to support the family life they were building.Gisele Bündchen describes relocating to Tampa without ever having lived there before, “When we moved to Tampa, I actually had never been there before. I just arrived and that was my life.”Yet despite her enormous success, much of the public narrative painted her as “against football” or overshadowed by Brady’s career, a portrayal she calls “very hurtful” and “the craziest thing I’ve ever heard.”Gisele Bündchen underscores that marriage didn’t unravel overnight. “That takes years to happen.” As she puts it, “Sometimes you grow together; sometimes you grow apart … When you love someone, you don’t put them in a jail and say, ‘You have to live this life.’ You set them free to be who they are..”Gisele Bündchen's message: supporting someone doesn’t mean losing yourself, and that truth became clearer to her as her kids grew and her dreams quietly changed..Today, Gisele Bündchen speaks of her next act in Costa Rica, building a home, raising her children, and exploring wellness and nature far from red carpets. She asserts, “I have my own dreams..”While Tom Brady continued his historic career, Bündchen’s focus shifted inward. She embraced spiritual practices, daily rituals, and the idea that success is not just professional acclaim but authenticity and fulfillment. She says the breakup felt like both a loss and a liberation, “I believed in fairy tales when I was a kid. I think it’s beautiful to believe in that.”Gisele Bündchen's reflection on Brady is remarkably gracious. “Listen, I have always cheered for him, and I would continue forever … If there’s one person I want to be the happiest in the world, it’s him.”In doing so, Gisele Bündchen rejects reductive headlines and stereotypes, choosing instead to present a fuller picture of love, change and self-discovery. As she said, “What’s been said is one piece of a much bigger puzzle. It’s not so black and white.”In the end, this isn’t a story solely of one of fashion’s biggest icons stepping aside. It’s the story of a woman stepping forward, redefining when a chapter ends, a new one begins..Also Read: Gisele Bündchen’s post divorce evolution raises question: did Tom Brady underestimate what letting her go would cost him?",Supermodel Gisele Bündchen opened up about her 13-year marriage to former NFL quarterback Tom Brady.

In the last season, while playing with Blake, Oladotun averaged 22 points, 7 rebounds and 3 assists.It was a special moment for Baba Oladotun. The high school star was seated with his parents, his siblings and was surrounded by his friends while making the announcement.Oladotun’s father kicked off the announcement video by thanking everyone present at the announcement.

He did not take much time after that and stated, “With that being said, I will be committing to the University of Maryland.”A surreal moment for both fans and the athlete, the whole family stood up to reveal their t-shirts. While Oladotun’s father and his brother, along with the athlete, were wearing t-shirts with Maryland written on them, his mother and sister were donning t-shirts with Terps written on them.Oladotun’s announcement received huge praise from everyone, primarily because he decided to stay with a local high school. It was also a win for the team’s coach, Buzz Williams. Oladotun is the first 5-star-ranked player Buzz received a commitment from throughout his career.

Potential Concerns

Will the Trade Actually Happen?

Thehave burst out to a strong 9-3 start, winning four of their last five games, but there’s still a noticeable gap in their backcourt. With Fred VanVleet sidelined for the entire 2025-26 season due to an ACL injury, Houston is operating without a true point guard - and that absence is shaping the conversation around the team’s long-term ceiling. Amen Thompson has stepped up admirably, yet the franchise ideally wants him back in his natural off-ball role, pushing the front office to explore creative options.That exploration has led to a surprising blockbuster trade idea: reuniting Kevin Durant with NBA champion Kyrie Irving. The concept, highlighted by CBS Sports’ Sam Quinn, suggests Houston could take advantage of Dallas’ uncertainty around Irving’s future while addressing its own need for a primary playmaker. With the Rockets already thriving without VanVleet and Dorian Finney-Smith yet to suit up, the proposal is gaining attention - especially with Irving expected to return later this season from his ACL setback.The Houston Rockets are navigating the season with Amen Thompson stepping into playmaking duties, but the organization ideally wants him back in his natural off-ball role. Meanwhile, VanVleet is expected to miss the entire 2025-26 season, leaving Houston without a veteran distributor.According to CBS Sports writer Sam Quinn, Kyrie Irving stands out as a surprisingly logical target given the Rockets’ roster construction and timeline. As Quinn wrote last Thursday, “Irving’s trade value is a total mystery. There’s really only one team that makes sense, and that’s Houston, where he could reunite with Kevin Durant.” (H/t: Sporting News)Irving is currently recovering from a torn ACL but is projected to return later this season - unlike VanVleet. Even with the risk, the potential reward of pairing Irving with Durant again is enough to generate intrigue for the surging Western Conference team.Here is the structure of the hypothetical deal outlined by Quinn, which brings significant star power to the Houston Rockets without heavy disruption to their rotation:Quinn notes that the Houston Rockets “wouldn’t really miss” Finney-Smith in this scenario since the veteran forward has yet to debut for Houston this year.Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving shared the court for 2.5 seasons with the Brooklyn Nets. Although their tenure fell short of championship expectations, the duo delivered some of the most electric basketball of the early 2020s.• Irving’s elite ball-handling and shot-making• Durant’s effortless scoring from all three levels• Their ability to take over games individually or interchangeably• Ratings-friendly, highlight-heavy playstyleThe Nets didn’t capture a title or even reach the Finals during their run, but few duos matched their entertainment value or scoring chemistry.• The Rockets are winning without a true point guard• VanVleet is sidelined all season• Irving is expected to return before the playoffs• Durant benefits from high-level shot creation next to him• The Western Conference race is tightening, making veteran experience valuableIf Houston continues its strong play deep into the season, taking a calculated swing on Irving could elevate the team into legitimate contender territory.• Irving’s health following ACL recovery• Contract commitment (three years remaining, $118 million)• Team chemistry with a young core• Fit alongside Durant in a new system• Long-term flexibility versus short-term upside• A true point guard with elite scoring ability• A proven playoff performer when healthy• Immediate pressure relieved from Amen Thompson• Championship-level tandem with Durant• Availability issues• Contract size• Risk of disrupting team rhythm• Defensive liabilities in certain matchupsEverything hinges on timing. If Houston maintains its momentum and Irving nears a healthy return, the franchise may find it worthwhile to “give the former Cleveland Cavaliers star a look on the trade market,” as the original article suggests.For now, the rumor exists as an intriguing hypothetical - one that connects an overachieving young team with two aging superstars who once formed one of the league’s must-watch duos.Also read: NBA trade rumors: Los Angeles Lakers could sign $54 million Dallas Mavericks superstar to for deadly duo with Luka Doncic And as Sam Quinn emphasized, “They’re not going to trade Irving just to trade him.

Taylor Swift Reveals Favorite Track, Talks Travis Kelce And New Album “The Life Of A Showgirl”

More coverage on NFL:

Taylor Swift’s latest track, “The Fate of Ophelia,” is sparking a fresh wave of online theories and Swifties are convinced she’s weaving real-life heartbreak into a Shakespeare-inspired narrative. The song, featured on The Life of a Showgirl, flips the tragic Ophelia storyline into one of revival, and fans immediately tie the imagery to Taylor’s emotional journey after her six-year relationship with Joe Alwyn.With lyrics that feel pointed, timing that feels deliberate, and symbolism that leans heavily into themes of rescue, rebirth, and choosing a new path, this track has become the latest cultural flashpoint as listeners dissect what Taylor may be saying between the lines.Swifties didn’t waste time pulling receipts. The lyric “dug me out of my grave” is being hailed as a symbolic nod to Travis, the man fans believe helped lift Taylor from the emotional stagnation she experienced during her long romance with Joe. And the shade? It’s there in sharpened form.When Taylor Swift sings, “All that time, I sat alone in my tower / You were just honing your powers,” listeners immediately connected it to Joe’s famously private lifestyle and his recent role in a new Hamlet film.The overlap between Ophelia, Hamlet, and Taylor’s real-life history is simply too on-the-nose for fans to ignore.What makes the moment hit even harder is how openly Swift seems to be reclaiming her narrative. Rather than turning her breakup into bitterness, she’s framing it as the final chapter of a darker era, one that allowed her to rise stronger and choose a love that fits her world rather than hides from it. Joe Alwyn, for his part, has subtly signaled he’s over the conversation, reportedly saying he’s moved on and suggesting fans do the same. But Swifties aren’t budging it.For Swift, this track feels like a mic-drop: a poetic goodbye to the past, a wink at the present, and a reminder that she’ll always turn heartbreak into art, even if some people would prefer not to be name-checked in her mythology..","Taylor Swift's new song, 'The Fate of Ophelia,' is fueling fan theories linking it to her breakup with Joe Alwyn.

Candace Owens claims the story about the day Charlie Kirk was shot does not make sense to her. She shared her thoughts during Myron Gaines’ livestream, which was uploaded to YouTube on November 18, 2025. Owens said she has been looking into the case on her own, and from what she has seen, the clips and details shown to the public feel incomplete. She pointed out that the public has not seen the exact moment when the shot was fired, and only a short clip of a person running after the shooting was released.Owens also said that Tyler Robinson, the man accused of shooting Charlie Kirk, may not have played the role many people think. She claimed that his fingerprints were found on the gun but said they were not the only fingerprints present. She also said another person named Lance Twiggs might have had a bigger role that day. Candace Owens stressed that these are her claims based on what she has seen so far.During the livestream, Candace Owens explained what she believed happened on the day Charlie Kirk was shot. She said she thinks the whole situation looked like a planned setup with many people involved, not just one person acting alone.Myron Gaines asked her why she thought the story felt wrong, and she said there were gaps that did not add up.Owens said that in her view, Tyler Robinson’s only real link to the case was that his fingerprints were found on the gun. She said his prints were not the only prints and claimed that this detail was not openly talked about.She also said that she does not believe Robinson stepped onto the campus that day. According to her, his “job” was only to pick up clothes and drop them near a Dairy Queen and then near a cemetery.She then discussed Lance Twiggs, who she said was the partner of the accused shooter. Owens claimed Twiggs was “much more involved.” She said she did not think he fired the shot, but she believed he had a deeper part in the plan.Candace Owens also pointed to a TMZ video from September 13.

Brady Tkachuk expected to return soon as Ottawa Senators captain aims for Thanksgiving,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/brady-tkachuk-expected-to-return-soon-as-ottawa-senators-captain-aims-for-thanksgiving/articleshow/125440006.cms,"Brady Tkachuk (Image Via Twitter)

When will Brady Tkachuk be cleared to play again?

The comeback timeline of Brady Tkachuk is gradually becoming clearer, which makes the Ottawa Senators fans have a much better idea of their captain's possible return to the ring. After a long period of recovery steps and increasing his on-ice load, the 26-year-old seems to be nearing an important change in his situation. His rehabilitation, which has incorporated skating, sessions, and doctor visits, has been positive and is now crossing over to a more promising stage.The most recent news came out of the Wingmen podcast, released on Wednesday, where Tkachuk said that he is aiming for a return around the Thanksgiving holiday in the US. This is in accordance with Postmedia’s Bruce Garrioch, who mentioned earlier in the week that Tkachuk had gone to New York to see a hand specialist to get permission to increase the level of his activities. The seven-game road trip ahead of Ottawa puts more pressure on his schedule, with the games against the Vegas Golden Knights and St. Louis Blues falling right in the period he hopes to be back on the ice.Brady Tkachuk has not played 16 games since he had the surgery to fix a torn thumb ligament on October 16, an injury that was expected to take 6-8 weeks to heal.He mentioned in the podcast that there will be another doctor’s appointment in the next few days, and he is hoping to be declared “all clear” so he can start his full-intensity competition again. Before the injury, he had three assists in three games, having come from a 55-point season in 2024-25. At present, in his seventh NHL season, he has in total 191 goals and 407 points in 515 games, proving once again that he is one of the cornerstones of Ottawa’s roster.The Senators are currently in the fifth position of the Atlantic Division, but they are just three points behind Detroit, which is atop the division, so Tkachuk's expected return next week could extremely benefit the team in gaining momentum. If he is given the go-ahead as expected, his coming back may happen at the time when Ottawa needs its captain the most.Also Read: NHL Rumors: Insider reveals money tension rising in Matthew Knies deal as Maple Leafs struggle with cap space","Brady Tkachuk has not played 16 games since he had the surgery to fix a torn thumb ligament on October 16.

His untimely death on November 16, 2025, has left his family and community in mourning, further complicated by the unanswered questions about what led to his health crisis. While the precise initial cause is still unclear in public discussions, family members have recounted the progression of events—from breathing difficulties to fatal brain injury—through social media and interviews.Bryce Dunlap passed away due to complications from an anoxic brain injury that followed a sudden medical emergency the week before. His stepmother, Nicole Dunlap, shared on Facebook on November 12, 2025, that Bryce Dunlap became unresponsive because of respiratory distress, which quickly escalated to cardiac arrest, cutting off oxygen to his brain and leading to irreversible damage.Despite being on a ventilator and showing short-lived signs of responsiveness, such as hand squeezes, he was unable to recover. Doctors informed the family that the anoxic injury—resulting from extended oxygen deprivation—was fatal, as mentioned in a GoFundMe update by his aunt Tracy McCanna on November 17, 2025. The family has not publicly shared any underlying reasons for the initial respiratory failure, like illness or outside factors, in their statements to outlets such as Fox 8 News Cleveland.In the haze of loss, the family turned to Bryce's prior wish to donate organs, a choice that brought purpose to their pain. Discussions with LifeBanc, the nonprofit organ procurement organization serving Northeast Ohio, began immediately after his passing. It was here that the connection to Bernie Kosar emerged.Kim Kane explained the major exchange to the Fox 8 I-Team on November 18, 2025: ""My ex-husband and I looked at each other and said Bernie Kosar is going through some terrible stuff. And we said put Bernie on the list.She said, ""Are you serious and we said yeah put Bernie on the list."" The ""she"" refers to a LifeBanc representative during the consultation. Kane added, reflecting on Bryce's fandom, ""This would have meant so much to him to do something.""The liver transplant was completed successfully on Monday, November 17, 2025, with Kosar recovering well enough to post a video update from his hospital bed that afternoon. LifeBanc confirmed to Fox 8 on November 18, 2025, that they handle all donations compassionately while adhering to federal privacy laws, but declined specifics on this case.The support we've received has been incredible. By November 19, 2025, the GoFundMe, which was set up to help with funeral and memorial expenses, had brought in $58,253, exceeding its original target to help the family financially. McCanna mentioned in the update, ""Bryce touched countless lives, and will continue to do so as an organ donor. We want to honor him in a way that reflects the love he shared so freely.""The suddenness of Bryce's passing still leaves us with so many questions. Family statements haven't really identified a specific cause apart from the respiratory issues, and medical privacy keeps us from knowing more. As Kane mentioned to the I-Team, the emphasis is on his legacy: a young fan whose last gift connected generations of Browns supporters.Also Read: Who is Damone Clark?

Shedeur Sanders' house was robbed while he played his first NFL snaps



Shedeur Sanders’ first regular season appearance in the NFL became unforgettable for reasons far beyond football. While he stepped onto the field for the Cleveland Browns and took over in the second half against the Baltimore Ravens, three masked suspects slipped into his Medina County home. Police confirmed that the intruders stole close to two hundred thousand dollars in property during the short window Sanders was at the stadium. The crime added a jarring twist to a milestone day for the rookie quarterback.Officials said the burglary began at 6:46 p.m., a time that lined up with the early moments of the Browns’ 23 to 16 loss. Sanders’ debut came after Dillon Gabriel entered concussion protocol at halftime. Sanders finished 4 of 16 for 47 yards with an interception and two sacks. Hours later, he learned his home had been targeted.The Medina County Sheriff’s Office released a detailed statement on Tuesday that described how the break-in unfolded. The department said, ""On November 16, 2025, at approximately 6:46 pm three suspects entered the residence of Cleveland Browns football player Shedeur Sanders. Surveillance cameras in the residence were able to capture video footage of the suspects as they entered and exited different portions of the home.The suspects were wearing masks and gloves and can be seen exiting the residence at approximately 6:58 pm with various property belonging to Mr. Sanders. It is estimated that approximately $200,000 in property was stolen. The Medina County Sheriff's Office is currently investigating the incident.""Investigators added that the burglary lasted only twelve minutes. No arrests have been made, but the sheriff’s office is urging anyone with information to contact Captain Eric Bors. The footage has become a key part of the active investigation.Sanders, 23, is now one of several athletes targeted in what law enforcement believes may be a wider pattern. Recent break-ins involving Joe Burrow, Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce, Bobby Portis Jr. and Mike Conley appear connected to a burglary ring under FBI review. Officials have warned athletes to avoid sharing their locations online, since many crimes happened when players were known to be away.In Sanders’ case, the incident happened during a home game, making the crime even bolder. Despite the shock, he is expected to start for Cleveland in Week 12 against the Raiders.Also Read: Drake Maye challenges Cam Newton’s claim that Patriots’ surprising 2025 campaign is just ‘fool’s gold’","Shedeur Sanders' house was robbed while he played his first NFL snaps.

More coverage on Cincinnati Bengals:

NFL WAGs know how to make the most of their time together. Some throw lively parties, others organize fun celebrations, and a few even break a sweat side by side. That’s exactly what Grace Uribe, girlfriend of Cincinnati Bengals rookie defensive end Shemar Stewart, did recently. She joined fellow Bengals WAGs at Orangetheory Fitness Newport for a group workout session. Grace shared a reel from the fitness center on her Instagram, showing the WAGs in stylish workout gear, powering through cardio under sombre orange lights, and tackling the challenging battling ropes. Trainers kept a close eye on everyone, ensuring no one slacked off. After their intense session, the group posed for a radiant post-workout photo, their faces glowing with accomplishment. Once refreshed, they enjoyed hydrating drinks and protein snacks. While Grace is embracing her new role among the NFL WAGs, her boyfriend Shemar Stewart faces a tougher spotlight and is reportedly listed as a bust: NFL’s Worst 2025 First-Round Pick at edge rusher.Shemar Stewart entered the 2025 NFL season with high hopes after resolving a contract dispute, and many expected him to make a strong impact. But just three months into his rookie year, his season took a tough turn.He suffered an ankle injury in Week 2 against the Jacksonville Jaguars, which kept him out for four games and delayed his return until Week 7. In Week 9 against the Chicago Bears, a knee injury led the team to place him on injured reserve, and he is expected to be out until at least Week 15. In his five games, Stewart has recorded only six tackles and one quarterback hit. Russ Heltman of Sports Illustrated reports that Stewart currently has the lowest rookie grade in the 2025 class on Pro Football Focus, ranking last among 120 edge rushers with a 36.9 grade. Heltman notes that the Bengals are experiencing another season without a significant contribution from their first-round pick. This contrasts with the immediate impact made by wide receiver Ja’Marr Chase and quarterback Joe Burrow; the only top Bengals picks to excel in their rookie seasons this decade.","Grace Uribe joined fellow Bengals WAGs at Orangetheory Fitness Newport for a group workout session.

Dana White’s long-term plan surfaces with UFC 324’s first official fight



Paramount Plus deal reshapes expectations for Dana White’s 2026 rollout



The UFC’s shift into its Paramount Plus era has taken a clearer shape after months of speculation about the promotion’s 2026 schedule. With only a handful of events left on the ESPN contract, fans had been left guessing about how Dana White would open the new broadcast partnership.Now that picture has sharpened. UFC 324, set for January 24 at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, will launch the new era with a confirmed light heavyweight matchup and the promise of a major card built for a global streaming audience.The announcement comes at a time when the organization is preparing for a massive transition. With Paramount’s $7.7 billion deal set to redefine how the UFC delivers its pay-per-views and international programming, even a single fight reveal draws attention.The first confirmed bout of 2026 will reportedly see Modestas Bukauskas take on Nikita Krylov in a matchup that sets an early tone for the Paramount era (per MMA Fighting). Bukauskas has rebuilt his career since returning to the promotion in 2023, stacking four consecutive wins and delivering highlight finishes. That run includes the knockout of Paul Craig in Paris that effectively ended Craig’s career. A victory in January would push Bukauskas into the light heavyweight top 15 and solidify his resurgence.Krylov arrives in a far more urgent place. The veteran has dropped two straight, suffering back-to-back knockout losses to Bogdan Guskov and Dominick Reyes. His experience and durability have long made him a tough assignment, but he enters UFC 324 needing to stop the slide. The matchup gives both fighters something significant to fight for as the new broadcast deal begins to take shape.White confirmed earlier this year that every UFC event beginning in 2026 will stream on Paramount Plus, with select cards appearing on CBS. The partnership has already expanded to include Latin America and Australia, creating a worldwide launch moment in January. That has raised expectations for UFC 324.Matchmaking for the card has only just begun. When asked whether lightweight champion Ilia Topuria could appear on the first Paramount card, White left the door open, saying, “We literally — today, matchmaking was today,” before adding, “It’s a possibility.”Also Read: Netflix scramble revealed as Jake Paul weighed three unexpected replacement fighters leaked by top boxing insider",UFC 324 is set for January 24 at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.

Braeden Bowman’s rise adds crucial edge to Golden Knights’ offensive setup



Rookie forward Braeden Bowman is rapidly becoming a story to watch in Vegas. In just his fourth NHL appearance, the 22-year-old delivered a crucial early goal against the New York Rangers, signalling a promising rise for the Golden Knights. His ability to read plays and react under pressure has given him an edge, especially on the power play, where he has already shown remarkable consistency.Bowman made his debut on November 13 against the Islanders and has since scored twice, both on the man advantage. Against Igor Shesterkin, he positioned himself perfectly to capitalise on a rebound after feeding Mitch Marner, one-timing the puck past the goaltender to put Vegas ahead. His previous goal in St. Louis also came on the power play, making him the fourth Golden Knight to score his first NHL goal on special teams. Impressively, his strike stood as a game-winner, making him just the fifth in franchise history to achieve this feat.Signed initially as an undrafted free agent, Bowman earned his AHL contract with Henderson in July 2024 before securing his entry-level deal with Vegas on March 3, 2025.His rapid progression reflects his strong work ethic and the Golden Knights’ ability to develop young talent effectively. Bowman’s early chemistry with experienced players like Marner hints at valuable long-term potential. His quick adaptation to NHL pace has impressed coaches and strengthened his case for increased ice time.With two power-play goals in just four games, Bowman is emerging as a reliable offensive option, particularly in high-pressure situations. His awareness around the net and ability to execute rebounds are proving valuable for a Vegas team pushing for consistent scoring depth. If his form continues, he could become one of the most impactful rookies of the season.Bowman’s journey from undrafted talent to early standout shows promise for the Golden Knights’ future. As his confidence builds and his role expands, Vegas may have uncovered a rising star ready to contribute when it matters most. If he continues developing at this pace, he could secure a key role for Vegas in the seasons ahead.Also Read: “Proud of YOU and US”: Brittany Lucic shares appreciation post for Milan Lucic on overcoming challenges two years after 2023 Boston case",Braeden Bowman has scored two power-play goals in four games for Vegas.

He shared his decommitment on Instagram on Wednesday, and the news spread quickly across Nebraska football circles.Right after the announcement, many fans wanted to know what this could mean for Dylan Raiola, who has been Nebraska’s starting quarterback since 2024.Dylan Raiola has thrown for 4,819 yards and 31 touchdowns in 22 starts. Nebraska is 13-9 with him under center, and he helped the team win its first bowl game in years.Dylan Raiola was having a big season under offensive coordinator Dana Holgorsen before he broke his fibula in the third quarter of a game against UCLA. He had surgery the next week and has been recovering.Some people wonder if Dayton Raiola decommitted because Dylan might consider a move once he is healthy.Dylan has transferred multiple times before college, and he also decommitted from Ohio State and Georgia before choosing Nebraska. Others believe Dayton simply saw too much quarterback depth at Nebraska.The room already includes Dylan Raiola, TJ Lateef, and Marcos Davila.

Matt Ryan set for NFL Christmas Day broadcast

More NFL coverage

Even though Matt Ryan hung up his cleats last year, the former Atlanta Falcons quarterback hasn’t exactly disappeared from football fans’ view. The 40-year-old has been everywhere, analyzing film and breaking down storylines on CBS’s pregame desk, joining a podcast with ex-Rams star Aaron Donald and longtime Atlanta reporter Zach Klein, and giving his unique insight into the league.Ryan’s connection to the Falcons remains strong. During the 2024 season, he mentored Michael Penix Jr., guiding the rookie through his first year as the team’s starter. Even in retirement, Ryan is clearly invested in helping the next generation of quarterbacks thrive. Now, he’s stepping away from the pregame desk for a bit to join the NFL Christmas Gameday broadcast, giving fans another reason to tune in over the holidays.The NFL recently unveiled its Christmas Day schedule, and Netflix is back in the mix for the second year in a row. The streaming platform will air the first two games of the holiday triple-header, starting with the Dallas Cowboys at the Washington Commanders at 1 p.m. ET, followed by the Detroit Lions at the Minnesota Vikings at 4:30 p.m. Matt Ryan will serve as a game analyst, joining CBS Sports’ Ian Eagle and Nate Burleson in the booth for the Cowboys-Commanders matchup.This allows him to remain front and center in the NFL world while providing fans with his perspective as one of the most accomplished quarterbacks of the last 15 years.Despite still being in excellent shape, Ryan has made it clear that returning to play is not on his agenda. Ahead of the Week 8 game between the Cincinnati Bengals and New York Jets, he joked with sideline reporter Aditi Kinkhabwala about picking up tips from Joe Flacco, another 40-year-old quarterback still active in the league.Kinkhabwala passed along Flacco’s advice: “Drink more water.” The moment drew laughs on the broadcast, and some even speculated that teams might be curious about Ryan making a return. But he quickly ended the conversation. “I’m good,” he said, smiling as he shut the door on the idea.For now, Ryan is focused on sharing his knowledge from the broadcast booth, mentoring young quarterbacks, and keeping fans engaged with his expert analysis. While he’s no longer taking snaps on Sundays, Matt Ryan is still very much a visible, respected voice in the NFL, proving that retirement doesn’t mean stepping away from the game entirely.",Matt Ryan will join the NFL Christmas Gameday broadcast on Netflix.

Details of the elevator confrontation involving Trevon Diggs

Legal fallout and implications for Trevon Diggs and his family

The new Trevon Diggs violence allegations claim his involvement in an elevator situation that has become highly publicized. Now, the surveillance footage of an incident taking place inside a Los Angeles apartment building has rekindled debate over who was ever in the lift that night and just what went on inside.The video, along with legal allegations made by the alleged victim, has given rise to speculation about the involvement of people associated with the Diggs family despite Trevon Diggs not being officially named in any criminal complaint. The authorities are closely monitoring further details as they become available.Surveillance video shows the alleged victim, Christopher Blake Griffith, remaining within an elevator when its doors opened for a man outside the doors. After a quick exchange of words on the ground level, Griffith tried to go back into the elevator when the person standing at the doorstep had the front elevator doors continue to open, thus preventing the doors from closing.A few moments later, two more men got into the elevator and began to attack Griffith. In the footage, one attacker is seen taking a chain from the victim's neck while the others punched him repeatedly.And they took a different elevator to leave post-attack. Later, police revealed a robbery report listed jewelry among the items taken.Although the clip doesn't name all those present, the incident has become controversial due to alleged connections of the Diggs family to the altercation. Diggs was never charged, though similar implications have ignited a media firestorm.Also Read: Jerry Jones breaks silence on Trevon Diggs after mysterious home accident before Washington game The legal fallout from the incident has drawn a civil suit from Christopher Blake Griffith, who claims he was physically injured, traumatized, and financially harmed during the attack. He is suing for damages and the value of the property he said was stolen, and his lawyers argue that several people helped plan for the attack.One of the Diggs brothers, Darez Diggs, has already faced legal proceedings connected to the confrontation and entered a no-contest plea to a related charge, resulting in probation. Meanwhile, separate accusations made by Griffith against Stefon Diggs prompted Stefon to file a defamation lawsuit aimed at clearing his name.The investigation continues, but analysts will certainly be monitoring whether Trevon Diggs will be charged further. If confirmed, it could affect his personal brand, team status, and sponsorship deals as well. The story is ongoing, and legal entities and the NFL community at large are watching the developments as they continue to unfold.","Surveillance video shows alleged victim, Christopher Blake Griffith, remaining within an elevator when its doors opened for a man outside the doors.

In a dramatic finish to Tuesday night’s game, Dallas Stars forward Mikko Rantanen leveled a controversial hit on New York Islanders defenseman Alexander Romanov, leading to widespread criticism among fans and NHL analysts. Despite facing sharp criticisms, no further discipline has been taken by the NHL against Ranatanen, and this no-action decision by the league has reignited debate, with some fans and analysts accusing the NHL of protecting its “cash cows.”As per reports, Romanov was hit by his contemporary in the final seconds of Tuesday's game between the NY Islanders and Dallas Stars. During the match, tempered flared up between the teams, where defenseman Alexander Romanov was driven into the boards behind the net, after he was hit by Mikko Ranaten. Following the incident, Romanov had to leave the game as he suffered an upper-body injury.This has concerned the fans and analysts, raising eyebrows and questioning the league as to why Ranatnen was not awarded any supplementary punishment for causing injury to Islanders defenseman Romanov.NHL has declined to issue any supplemental discipline to Dallas Stars forward Mikko Rantanen after his controversial boarding hit on New York Islanders defenseman Alexander Romanov late in Tuesday’s game.This has gained sharp criticisms from the fans and NHL analysts, too.As per reports, during the match, with just 27 seconds left in regulation, Rantanen drove Romanov face-first into the boards, resulting in a five-minute major game misconduct. Islanders head coach Patrick Roy blasted the hit as “disrespectful” and argued that Rantanen should have been awarded a penalty after Romanov’s injury. But, after careful consideration, the league decided that the in-game penalty was sufficient.As per Elliotte Friedman, he tweeted, “Per @Lassimak, no supplemental discipline expected for Rantanen. Contact with Mayfield before the collision was a factor in the outcome Islanders obviously very unhappy. Outlook for Romanov unclear, but he had shoulder surgery there a couple of years ago, so, unfortunately, there is concern.”Meanwhile, fans have also shown their concern and expressed their angst on X/Twitter. One user wrote, “Alright, Isles, take things into your own hands. Go get him.” While another wrote, “So the contact from Mayfield forced Rantanen to extend his arm into Romanov? @NHLPlayerSafety continues to be an absolute joke.” Another user wrote, “That is ridiculous. The contact with Mayfield had nothing to do with Rantanen extending his arms to shove Romanov in the back while in the danger zone. ”However, reports suggest that the NHL actually considered that Rantanen was knocked slightly off balance by a brief contact from Islanders defenseman Scott Mayfield just before the collision, contributing to the dangerous impact. In addition to this, Stars coach Glen Gulutzan echoed this view, calling it an unfortunate hockey incident rather than an intentional act to harm someone.","Dallas Stars forward Mikko Rantanen leveled a controversial hit on New York Islanders defenseman Alexander Romanov.

Angel Reese’s composed reaction wins over fans

Draymond Green addresses the situation and defends Reese

The “mebounds” brand and Reese’s business savvy

unexpectedly found herself in the middle of a viral NBA drama this week - despite not even being in the building. The Chicago Sky star became the talk of the hour after her name surfaced during a heated moment betweenand a courtside fan. The bizarre situation left fans both amused and confused, while Reese’s calm, witty response reminded everyone why she’s become one of the most charismatic personalities in modern basketball.Reese has been no stranger to headlines in recent months, often finding herself pulled into conversations that extend far beyond the WNBA. But this incident stood out because it had nothing to do with her actions. Instead, her name became a punchline in a taunt directed at another player - sparking discussions about respect, trolling culture, and how athletes handle sudden viral attention.The controversy started during a game between the Golden State Warriors and the New Orleans Pelicans. A courtside fan named Sam Green repeatedly heckled Draymond Green by calling him “Angel Reese” after a series of missed shots and failed rebound attempts. The taunt referenced an exaggerated internet meme suggesting Reese gathers “mebounds” - rebounds off her own missed shots - an inside joke that has circulated widely among fans online.At first, Draymond Green ignored the jeers, but when the taunting intensified, he confronted the fan.Referees quickly intervened to ensure the situation didn’t escalate further. Clips of the standoff spread rapidly across social media, dragging Angel Reese’s name into a situation she had no involvement in.Shortly after the video went viral, Angel Reese responded on X with a simple, pointed message: “literally minding my business 🫠.” Her four-word post instantly resonated with fans who have noticed how frequently she becomes part of conversations she never engages in. Supporters praised her composure and humor, noting that she keeps “getting dragged into drama while being nowhere near it.”Online reactions celebrated both her unbothered attitude and the irony of her name carrying enough cultural weight to become an NBA courtside insult.Following the incident, Draymond Green spoke on his podcast, criticizing the way Reese’s name was used as a negative label. He expressed admiration for her accomplishments and made it clear he wasn’t comfortable with the implication behind the fan’s taunt. The NBA issued warnings to both Green and the heckler but opted not to fine anyone since the conflict remained verbal.The insult itself stems from the long-running “mebounds” joke, which Reese has fully embraced. Instead of pushing back on critics, she trademarked the term and even used it for a sneaker colorway - turning trolling into marketing. Coupled with her self-aware “villain” persona, the trademark showcases her ability to turn online chatter into real-world business opportunities.Also read: LiAngelo Ball Makes Platinum History with Breakout Hit “Tweaker” featuring Drake In the end, Reese’s poise became the story.

How Lamar Odom’s paranoia led to the destruction of the journals

Why Khloé Kardashian refuses to return to journaling today

Khloé Kardashian shares shocking reason why she gave up on journaling forever. She says she stopped writing in her intensely personal journals after a traumatic occurrence in her marriage to former NBA forward Lamar Odom. On her podcast, she explained that Odom burned her journals in front of her, something that still affects her emotionally.Kardashian, in unsparing comments, said the incident rattled her so much that she gave up maintaining her diary. Her musings, which had always been her emotional release, her world, suddenly vanished and she has never returned to it. She said that losing those notebooks felt like losing years of her life.Speaking on her podcast, Kardashian explained that Odom set fire to countless notebooks she had filled with personal writings because he was so paranoid that she was writing something down to tell someone else about it. According to her testimony, he thought at times she was taking notes and passing them outside, something she said was entirely false.Kardashian said he confronted her over the journals and threw them in a fire as she watched.She described the scene as ""chaotic"" and ""heartbreaking"" as she recalled getting down on her knees and screaming as the pages went up in flames. It was years of her thinking, moments and milestones, emotions here one second and the next they were gone. That experience caused her to wonder if journaling was worth the risk of that level of painful loss.While Kardashian said she does miss journaling, she is not ready to revisit the practice because of how that night affected her emotionally in each journal entry. She mentioned that she just did not want to go through, again, everything that went with that night, and the thought of writing opened the door to nakedness that she was not ready for.But the event also serves as a nod to the dramatic reality of her marriage to Lamar Odom, which included frightening nights of fear, instability, and anxiety. While Kardashian has said previously that she learned from the experience, she has also made it clear that it is one she would never wish to relive.By sharing this personal chapter, she offered insight into how significant those journals were to her and how deeply the loss affected her. The destruction of her writing, she explained, was more than the loss of pages, it was the loss of a private sanctuary she has never truly replaced.Also Read: Vanessa Bryant released a heartfelt mural tribute honoring NBA icon Kobe Bryant and daughter Gianna",Kardashian says she stopped writing in her intensely personal journals after a traumatic occurrence in her marriage to former NBA forward Lamar Odom.
