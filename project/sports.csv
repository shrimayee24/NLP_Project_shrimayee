Magenta mail and a 13-minute leap into history



From balloons to biplanes: The making of Henri Pequet



On a winter evening in 1911, as the sun dipped over the confluence city of Prayagraj, a small crowd gathered on the banks of Yamuna to witness what many believed was little more than a spectacle. Kumbh Mela pilgrims thronged the city, traders and farmers moved through the UP Exhibition grounds, and curious onlookers looked out for a strange contraption of wood, fabric and wire. Few were aware that they were about to watch a moment that would quietly reshape global communication.At around 5.30 pm on February 18, 1911, French aviator Henri Pequet climbed into his Heavyland aircraft, its engine clinking against the evening air. In the cockpit, alongside fuel and instruments, were 6,500 letters — ordinary envelopes entrusted to an extraordinary experiment. When Pequet lifted off, crossing the Yamuna and steering towards Naini, he carried with him not just mail, but the idea that any distance could be conquered by air.The flight lasted just 13 minutes. It covered roughly 15 kilometres, from the exhibition grounds in Prayagraj to a landing site near Naini Junction, close to what is now the Central Jail. But the journey's brevity concealed its significance.This was the world’s first official airmail service, launched from colonial India at a time when powered flight itself was barely eight years old. Around one lakh people, according to contemporary accounts, watched in astonishment as the machine rose, crossed the river, and descended safely on the other side.The setting was as symbolic as the event. The UP Exhibition, an agricultural and industrial fair, had brought together innovation and tradition on the riverbanks. Two aircraft had been shipped in parts by British officers and assembled in full public view, turning engineering into theatre. The airmail flight was staged as a highlight, but its implications would ripple far beyond the fairgrounds.More than a century later, postal services have transformed beyond recognition, from fragile biplanes to drones and satellites. Yet, India’s role in inaugurating the airmail era remains a lesser-known chapter in aviation and communication history.On that February evening in 1911, amid pilgrims, farmers and curious citizens, a modest flight across the Yamuna quietly launched a global revolution in how the world sends its messages.Long before engines roared and wings of fabric and wood lifted off the ground, messages travelled on feathers. For at least two thousand years, pigeons have carried letters across distances that were otherwise difficult, dangerous or slow to traverse. A small note would be tied to the bird’s leg, released from a distant point, and the trained pigeon would instinctively fly back to its home loft—where the intended recipient waited.Ancient civilisations relied on this method with remarkable sophistication. The Romans used homing pigeons to relay military and administrative messages; the Greeks employed them to announce the results of sporting contests; Persian and Chinese networks also integrated pigeons into their communication systems. In many ways, these birds formed one of the earliest organised long-distance messaging systems.The practice did not vanish with antiquity. In the late 19th century, a structured pigeon-based postal service briefly operated in New Zealand. Between 1897 and 1901, the New Zealand Pigeon Post carried messages between the mainland and Great Barrier Island, issuing stamps that are today prized by philatelists. It was an ingenious solution to geographic isolation in an era when reliable telegraph or ferry services were still developing.Yet pigeon post had an inherent limitation that often went unremarked. The bird could only fly home. To send a message from a remote location, someone first had to transport the pigeon there—usually confined in a cage. Even the earliest “airmail” required its own logistics chain.Against this backdrop, the leap from pigeon legs to powered flight was not just technological; it was conceptual. When Henri Pequet carried mail across the Yamuna in 1911, he was building on centuries of experiments in conquering distance—this time with a machine, not a bird, and with the promise of transforming how nations would communicate.The idea itself was quite audacious for its time. According to Postmaster General Krishna Kumar Yadav, Colonel Y Wyndham first approached postal authorities with a proposal that sounded closer to fantasy than policy: sending mail by aeroplane. The postal chief of the day gave his consent, and preparations began for what would become a landmark experiment in communication.The mail bag prepared for the flight was intentionally distinctive. It carried the markings “First Air Mail” and “Uttar Pradesh Exhibition, Allahabad,” with an illustration of an aircraft printed on it. Instead of the customary black ink, magenta was used, giving the consignment a distinctive identity.Organisers were acutely aware of the aircraft’s limitations. Weight was a critical concern, and strict calculations were done to ensure the load would not exceed what the machine could lift. Each letter was weighed, restrictions were imposed, and finally, the number of items was capped at 6,500. The flight itself would last only 13 minutes, but everything leading up to it had been planned with military precision.Yadav, who has noted down India’s postal history in his book 'India Post: 150 Glorious Years' notes that the service was not merely symbolic; it was also structured as a special premium offering. A surcharge of six annas was levied on each letter, and the proceeds were donated to the Oxford and Cambridge Hostel in Allahabad. The hostel became the nerve centre of this unusual operation. Letters were accepted for booking until noon on February 18, and the rush was such that the building resembled a miniature General Post Office. The postal department had to deploy three to four staff members on-site to handle the volume.Within days, nearly 3,000 letters had reached the hostel for onward transmission by air, a testament to the novelty and prestige attached to the service. Among the senders were local elites—rajas, maharajas, princes, and prominent citizens of Prayagraj, eager to have their names associated with history.One envelope even bore a postage stamp worth Rs 25, an extraordinary sum at the time, underscoring how much symbolic value people placed on this pioneering flight.Henri Pequet’s journey to the banks of the Yamuna was anything but straightforward. Born on February 1, 1888, in Bracquemont, a small town in France’s Seine-Inférieure region, he was drawn to flight at a time when aviation was still an experiment more than a profession. He began in 1905 with balloon flights under the guidance of Baudry, later moving on to work with the dirigible Ville de Paris built by Paulham. These early years were spent learning the fundamentals of aeronautics, often through trial, error, and mechanical improvisation.By 1908, Pequet was working at the Voisin brothers’ aircraft factory in Mourmelon, one of the pioneering centres of European aviation. His transition from mechanic to pilot was almost accidental. While on an assignment in Châlons to repair an aircraft abandoned in a field after its Anzani engine failed, Pequet secured permission to test the plane himself. It was there that he experienced the thrill of controlling an aircraft for the first time, discovering a talent that would soon define his career.The following year, he was hired as a pilot and mechanic by Chilean aviation entrepreneur José Luis Sánchez. In 1909, Pequet travelled to Johannisthal, near Berlin, to attend an aviation meeting. Circumstances led him to replace another pilot, Edwards, on a flight, on a condition that he would no longer be employed as a mechanic. On October 30, he took off, executed a short but controlled flight, and landed smoothly. The performance marked his emergence as a professional aviator.Pequet soon returned to the Voisin factory and went on to participate in aerial exhibitions in Argentina, flying Voisin biplanes powered by 60-horsepower engines. On March 24, 1910, he made a notable flight at Villa Lugano. Later that year, he returned to France and enrolled at the Voisin brothers’ flying school in Reims, earning his pilot’s brevet from the Aéro-Club de France on June 10, 1910, with licence number 88.Less than a year later, the young French aviator would find himself in colonial India, piloting an aircraft over the Yamuna and writing a small but enduring chapter in the history of global postal and aviation.","In 1911, French aviator Henri Pequet carried mail across the Yamuna. It was the world’s first official airmail service, launched from colonial India. Around one lakh people watched in astonishment as the machine rose, crossed the river, and descended safely on the other side.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128510387,imgsize-424249,width-400,resizemode-4/image-national-postal-museum.jpg"

Burner account allegations on Kevin Durant explained



The Houston Rockets forward Kevin Durant faced reporters after screenshots from a private X group chat went viral, tying an account named @GetHigher77 to comments made about teammates. The posts spread like wildfire with a lot of speculation surrounding the NBA veteran.Durant did not engage in a lengthy defense. He did not confirm ownership of the account either. With Houston sitting at 33-20 and fourth in the Western Conference, the focus inside the building remains on basketball. However, outside the building, KD has been under scrutiny, which propelled him to respond to the allegations sparked against his name.Kevin Durant addressed the situation directly when asked after practice. “I know you got to ask these questions, but I’m not here to get into Twitter nonsense,” Durant said. “I’m just here to focus on the season, keep it pushing,” KD told the reporters.Watch KD’s backstage interview—When pressed about whether he had spoken with teammates regarding the chatter, he shared, “My teammates know what it is. We’ve been locked in the whole season.Enjoyed our break. Had a great practice today, looking forward to the road trip.”Durant neither claimed nor denied the account. He labeled the discussion “Twitter nonsense” and shifted attention back to the court.The controversy began when screenshots surfaced from a group chat on X. The account @GetHigher77 allegedly posted messages from Durant’s perspective and criticized teammates, including Alperen Şengün and Jabari Smith Jr. One message reportedly referred to the Rockets as a weak team with NSFW words. There is no verified proof that the account belongs to Durant.Fans reacted quickly because of history. In 2017, while with the Golden State Warriors, Durant admitted to using secret accounts to defend himself after leaving the Oklahoma City Thunder. He later acknowledged the mistake publicly.Durant is among the NBA’s most active players on social media, with millions of followers and years of frequent posting.For now, the facts remain limited. The account’s ownership is unconfirmed. Durant has dismissed the allegations and reiterated his focus on the season. The Rockets continue their push in the Western Conference while the online debate runs in parallel.","Houston Rockets forward Kevin Durant faced reporters after screenshots from a private X group chat went viral.

Pakistan batter Babar Azam drew fresh online criticism during his team’s Group A match against Namibia national cricket team at the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026 in Colombo after he did not get a chance to bat.The experienced batter, long seen as one of Pakistan’s leading run-scorers, has struggled for form in the competition. On X and other platforms, fans have questioned why he has not made an impact, even when opportunities might have arisen earlier in the tournament.The 31-year-old had originally been picked as a fail-safe option. He was expected to anchor the innings at number four and steady the side if wickets fell, an area where Pakistan have faced problems in the past.However, against the Netherlands and India, he did not play that role effectively when Pakistan's batting collapsed. In the must-win game against Namibia, Pakistan made a strong start, and team management — including coach Mike Hesson and captain Salman Ali Agha — chose to send more aggressive batters ahead of him.Pakistan lost their second wicket, that of skipper Agha, in the 13th over. Instead of sending Babar at number four, Khawaja Nafay was promoted.Even after Nafay managed only 5 off 5 balls, Babar was still not sent in. Shadab Khan joined Sahibzada Farhan in the middle instead.Online reaction was swift, with users posting memes, questions and criticism about his lack of runs and Pakistan’s batting approach.""Babar Azam ko team puri krny ke liay khilaya gaya hai?"" asked one viewer.Another user edited a well-known “depression mein hain” video using Babar’s voice after his demotion.A third user wrote on X, ""I think babar azam is promoted as finisher.""In the match, Pakistan rode on Sahibzada Farhan's scintillating, maiden hundred and their spinners' excellent display to beat Namibia by a handsome margin of 102 runs and enter the Super Eights of the T20 World Cup on Wednesday.","Pakistan batter Babar Azam drew fresh online criticism during his team’s Group A match against Namibia national cricket team.

Their stunning upset over Australia, coupled with a rain-abandoned fixture against Ireland, proved enough to see them through. The shared points from the washed-out game ultimately knocked Australia out, sealing Zimbabwe’s place in the Super 8s as unlikely but deserving qualifiers.Despite already advancing, Sri Lanka — captained by Dasun Shanaka — are expected to maintain their intensity.Finishing atop the group would not only preserve momentum but could also offer a more favourable draw in the Super 8 stage.The Sri Lanka vs Zimbabwe match will be played on Thursday, February 19.The match will be played at the R.Premadasa Stadium in Colombo.The match will start at 3:00 PM IST, with the toss scheduled for 2:30 PM IST.The match will be televised live in India on the Star Sports Network.Live streaming will be available on the Jio Hotstar app and website.The match can be followed live on TimesofIndia.com.Pathum Nissanka, Kamil Mishara, Kusal Mendis(w), Pavan Rathnayake, Kamindu Mendis, Dasun Shanaka(c), Dunith Wellalage, Wanindu Hasaranga, Dushmantha Chameera, Maheesh Theekshana, Matheesha PathiranaBrian Bennett, Tadiwanashe Marumani, Dion Myers, Brendan Taylor(w), Sikandar Raza(c), Ryan Burl, Tashinga Musekiwa, Brad Evans, Wellington Masakadza, Richard Ngarava, Blessing MuzarabaniDasun Shanaka (c), Charith Asalanka, Dushmantha Chameera, Dushan Hemantha, Janith Liyanage, Kamindu Mendis, Kusal Mendis (wk), Kamil Mishara, Pathum Nissanka, Matheesha Pathirana, Kusal Perera, Pramod Madushan, Pavan Rathnayake, Maheesh Theekshana, Dunith Wellalage.Sikandar Raza (c), Brian Bennett, Ryan Burl, Graeme Cremer, Ben Curran, Brad Evans, Clive Madande, Tinotenda Maposa, Tadiwanashe Marumani, Wellington Masakadza, Tony Munyonga, Tashinga Musekiwa, Blessing Muzarabani, Dion Myers, Richard Ngarava.","Zimbabwe take on Sri Lanka in an intriguing T20 World Cup clash on Thursday.

Chiefs Restructure Patrick Mahomes’ Contract to Clear $43.56M in Cap Space

Old Cap Hit: $78.2 Million



New Cap Hit: $34.65 Million



Total Savings: $43.56 Million



The Kansas City Chiefs are officially kicking off their 2026 offseason with a massive financial pivot. In a move that has become a February tradition in KC, the front office and superstar quarterback Patrick Mahomes have agreed to a major contract restructure.According to Jason Fitzgerald of Over The Cap, the move clears a staggering $43.56 million in cap space for the 2026 season.Before the restructure, Mahomes was slated to carry a cap hit of $78.2 million, a number that would have made it nearly impossible for the Chiefs to sign new talent or even retain their current roster.By converting $54.45 million of Mahomes’ 2026 compensation (including his base salary and roster bonus) into a signing bonus, the Chiefs were able to spread that cost over the remaining years of his deal.This wasn't just a ""nice-to-have"" adjustment, it was a necessity. Following a disappointing 6–11 campaign in 2025, a season marred by Mahomes’ season-ending knee injury, the Chiefs entered the 2026 offseason roughly $58 million over the salary cap.Even with this $43 million win, the Chiefs are still approximately $11 million in the red. General Manager Brett Veach still has significant work to do before the start of the new league year to get the team under the cap and ready for free agency.While this provides immediate breathing room, it ""kicks the can"" down the road once again. Mahomes’ projected cap hit for 2027 is now expected to soar past $85 million. This virtually guarantees that the team will either need to restructure again next year or negotiate a massive, long-term extension to lower that annual average.For now, the move allows the Chiefs to begin rebuilding a roster that missed the playoffs for the first time in the Mahomes era. Fans are now watching closely to see if this space will be used to protect Mahomes better or to convince veterans like Travis Kelce to return for another run.","Kansas City Chiefs restructure Patrick Mahomes' contract to clear $43.56 million in cap space.

Mikaela Shiffrin and Aleksander Aamodt Kilde show strong support after emotional Olympic gold

Mikaela Shiffrin finally got the moment she had been chasing for years. The American skier won gold in the women’s slalom at the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics on February 18, ending a long Olympic medal drought. Her victory was dominant, emotional, and historic. Soon after the race, congratulations poured in including a short but meaningful message from her Norwegian fiancé, Aleksander Aamodt Kilde, who wrote on Instagram, “She did it again.”The win was important because Shiffrin came into these Games with pressure and doubts after leaving Beijing 2022 without a medal. Earlier events in Milan were also disappointing, including an 11th-place giant slalom finish and a near miss in the team event. But in slalom, her strongest discipline, she delivered. Shiffrin finished with a combined time of 1:39.10, winning by 1.50 seconds over Switzerland’s Camille Rast, while Sweden’s Anna Swenn Larsson took bronze. The margin was one of the biggest seen in Olympic alpine skiing in decades.Mikaela Shiffrin’s gold also showed how much support she has around her. Kilde is missing the Olympics due to injuries following a serious crash and long recovery, but he publicly celebrated her success with pride.Team USA skier Breezy Johnson wrote, “So proud of this lady!!! 2x slalom champ!!!!” while Lindsey Vonn also shared congratulations online. For Shiffrin, this was more than just a medal.This became her third Olympic gold and fourth Olympic medal overall, making her the first American alpine skier to win three Olympic golds.She also became the first U.S. skier to win Olympic slalom twice, joining Swiss legend Vreni Schneider in that rare achievement. After crossing the finish line, Shiffrin dropped down with emotion before raising her fists to the crowd.She later said, “Today I showed up for the skiing. I wanted to have two runs with really strong slalom skiing… to also get to have a medal is unbelievable.”The moment felt bigger because she has openly talked about tough years, including injuries and mental struggles after past crashes.Through all of it, she and Kilde have supported each other. Their shared journey made this Olympic gold feel personal not just for the result, but for everything it took to get there.",Mikaela Shiffrin won gold in the women’s slalom at the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics on February 18.

Mick Cronin’s heated exchange and tough message grab attention after loss

Mick Cronin’s viral outburst sparks debate on discipline as UCLA struggles after back-to-back heavy defeats

Mick Cronin has long been known for his edge, accountability, and unreserved desire for toughness. That edge became something much more flammable on Tuesday night in East Lansing. His team's performance in Tuesday night's 82-59 loss to Michigan State did not satisfy him.Cronin was questioned about the chanting at Xavier Booker, a former Spartan player who transferred to UCLA, by the Michigan State student section. So, a question he got during his postgame news conference may have made him even more irate.Tuesday night, UCLA lost to No. 15 Michigan State by more than 20 points for the second time in a row. During the game, Bruins coach Mick Cronin seemed to remove one of his own players.UCLA center Steven Jamerson II, a former Michigan State student, was punished for a flagrant after fouling Carson Cooper from behind on a dunk attempt with 4:26 remaining in the Bruins' 82-59 defeat, with the team down 77-50.Michigan State supporters yelled the name of former five-star prospect Xavier Booker, a center for the Boston Bruins, during the game. After the game, Cronin got into a heated argument with a reporter who inquired about the Booker chants, saying:""I could give a rat's ass about the other team's student section. I would like to give you a kudos for the worst question I've ever been asked.. You really think I care about the other team's student section?”Cronin then accused the reporter of ""raising your voice at me."" Cronin said:""Yeah, you are.. Everybody is standing here listening to you.Everybody. This is on camera. They can hear you. I answered the question. I can give a rat's ass about the other team's student section.""When UCLA lost against the Michigan State Spartans 82-59, the coach's fury erupted in a way that Bruins supporters hardly ever saw. With just over four minutes left, UCLA center Steven Jamerson II fouled Carson Cooper hard during a dunk attempt, causing the team to fall behind 77-50. Authorities determined a flagrant. Cronin got farther.Cronin then explained after the game:""You know, true toughness is how you compete and how you go to work every day. Steve's a good kid. He made a bad decision… But if you want to be a tough guy, you need to do it during the game, for a blockout, for a rebound…”He said:""So, I was thoroughly disappointed; the guy was defenseless in the air. I know Steve was trying to block the shot, but the game's a 25-point game. You don't do that.""Coach Tom Izzo of the Spartans, whose team improved to 21-5, 11-4 in the Big Ten, had never seen such a strange situation before. Izzo made a joke:""I guess he upgraded that to a flagrant 2, huh?.. That's the first time I saw a coach do it, but that sounds like Mick. So, he'll get that straightened out.""Since then, the incident has gone viral, igniting a discussion on topics like player discipline, pure coaching ethics, and how to handle the growing frustrations within the Bruins team as they strive to earn a spot in the NCAA tournament.He opened himself when questioned about the chants after the game. He referred to it as the worst question he had ever received. He questioned the tone. He gave a forceful shove back. To put things in perspective, UCLA had just suffered a 30-point loss to No. 1 Michigan over the weekend.The Bruins are now 17-9 overall and 9-6 in Big Ten play after suffering yet another setback by more than 20 points, this time to a highly regarded Michigan State squad. Westwood hasn't had consecutive blowouts like this in many generations.","UCLA lost to No. 15 Michigan State 82-59 on Tuesday night.

Sidney Crosby exits after heavy collision, medical concerns mount

Team Canada adapts, but questions loom ahead of semifinal

Team Canada’s quest for Olympic gold at the Milano Cortina Winter Games took a bizarre and scary turn when captain Sidney Crosby had to exit a nail-biting quarter-final clash with Czechia early due to injury. The experienced forward left early in the second period following a heavy hit, sending alarm bells through the Canadian bench and fans watching in a high-pressure contest.Crosby's absence loomed large over the rest of the game with hopes of medals on the line. While Canada did eventually fight back to win in overtime, attention soon turned from the final score to the status of the team's leader and emotional pillar as the tourney reached its critical stretch.Crosby fell into the boards after getting caught between two Czech defenders while going through the neutral zone with the puck during a physical sequence. He stayed on the ice a few moments, then skated slowly to the bench and off down the tunnel under his own power. Later, team officials said he would not return due to a lower-body injury and would be re-evaluated.When he left, Canada was chasing in a game for the first time all tournament, an unusual spot for a team that is all about speed, depth, and experience at this level.Crosby had already made significant defensive and offensive contributions, playing heavy minutes and centering Canada’s top line. The unexpected absence forced head coach Jon Cooper to rearrange lines in a pinch, squeezing younger forwards into heavier minutes and responsibility roles.While that was a punch to the gut, Canada recovered, equalizing late in the game and clinching the win in overtime. Players spoke afterward about rallying around one another and feeding off the loss of their captain to spur each other on, but the reverberations of the celebrations were tempered by disbelief. Finding a replacement for Crosby, a captain who excels in the faceoff circle and has a knack for staying calm under pressure, isn’t going to happen easily, particularly with the competition heating up.With a semifinal on the horizon for Canada, the team must now wait for medical reports from trainers to help set strategy and expectations. Crosby was always going to be a big part of Canada’s gold-medal push, but his injury at least injects a bit of vulnerability, regardless of whether he returns to the lineup. With margins tightening and foes stiffening, the next few days may decide if Canada's Olympic fate rests on recovery, reinvention, or both.",Sidney Crosby left early in the second period following a heavy hit.

Earlier, Crosby set the record for points by a Canadian NHLer at the Olympics in Sunday’s 10-2 victory over France.According to TSN, Canada won Olympic gold with its NHL stars in 2002, 2010, and 2014 before the league skipped the 2018 event.

Gardner’s new Heat deal includes conditional guarantees as undrafted wing earns bigger NBA opportunity

Heat rookie Myron Gardner impresses with strong play and G League numbers as Miami plans bigger role

As Myron Gardner transitions out of his Two-Way contract, he and the Miami Heat have reached an agreement on a three-year conventional NBA contract. The Heat promoted Swingman to fill the void on their 15-man roster. Myron Gardner from his two-way contract, the organization said in a news release today.Agent Jake Cohen informs NBA source Chris Haynes that Gardner and the Heat have negotiated a three-year contract. Gardner has made 26 appearances with the Heat this season, averaging 9.8 minutes with 4.2 points, 3.0 rebounds, and 1.0 assists.Anthony Chiang of The Miami Herald claims that the contract won't be guaranteed beyond this season. The second- and third-year guarantees, according to Chiang, are ""conditional,"" meaning Gardner must stay under contract until specific dates in order to get his full compensation for those seasons.Chris Haynes wrote:“Miami Heat and swingman Myron Gardner have reached an agreement on a three-year deal, his agent Jake Cohen of Iconic Sports Management tells me.

Candace Drops 'SECRET' TPUSA Tape: Erika Kirk Heard Laughing Days After Charlie Kirk’s Killing

Candace Owens revisits bizarre “curse” narrative





Fresh controversy is swirling around Candace Owens after a viral social media post accused her of stirring up a modern-day “witch hunt” linked to the reported assassination of Charlie Kirk . The claim spread quickly online, drawing intense reactions as users debated whether Owens was promoting conspiracy thinking or simply revisiting a strange rumor that circulated in the confusion following Kirk’s death.The backlash intensified when critics shared a post alleging she was urging supporters to identify witches who supposedly placed a curse on Kirk. Allies pushed back, arguing the remarks were taken out of context and referred to an unusual narrative that surfaced at the time. Still, references to curses, occult practices, and religious intervention have reignited debate about misinformation, media influence, and how fringe theories can gain traction in moments of public shock.In a video clip now circulating widely, Candace Owens described an unusual sequence of events that she says emerged in the days following Kirk’s killing. She recounted claims that a journalist allegedly explored occult practices and published an article shortly before his death.“In the craziness of the aftermath of Charlie's assassination, we were told that there were witches who had put a spell on Charlie Kirk and they had, you know, been contacted by a journalist and then those witches put a spell on him.The journalist published the article on the 8th. Charlie somehow saw it very quickly on the 9th. A priest came over to pray over him and by the 10th he was dead.""Owens continued, ""I decided to revisit that and was kind of shocked to learn that that journalist was brand spanking new. Like she had started writing for the first time in May of that year and just a couple of months later she decides to head to Etsy. And of all people to cast a spell on and to try a witch's spell, she chooses Charlie Kirk. I don't know, all that just felt a little bit random to me.”The clip has fueled fierce online arguments. Critics say revisiting such claims risks amplifying misinformation. Supporters counter that Owens was questioning the odd timeline rather than endorsing supernatural explanations.She further added, ""I want the names of these priestess, their real names. I think that's fair. I think that's a fair ask. I have a feeling this might be another piece of the puzzle. Who put the quote-unquote spell on Charlie Kirk that he was so concerned about the night before, which I call BS on. There were a lot of crazy people who wrote articles about us.""She concluded, ""Charlie losing sleep over a priestess who didn't exist a month ago seems a little extra to me.

“He was my security guard”: Clavicular fuels controversy after Brianna Chickenfry questions his real age and past security job,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/he-was-my-security-guard-clavicular-fuels-controversy-after-brianna-chickenfry-questions-his-real-age-and-past-security-job/articleshow/128498824.cms,"Clavicular has come under scrutiny after Brianna Chickenfry questioned his age, claiming he worked as a bar security guard three years ago despite reportedly being only 20 now. The timeline sparked speculation online about whether he misrepresented his age or used a fake ID. The viral debate has raised broader questions about hiring rules and verification practices.

Viral clip raises questions about age and bar security rules





During her recent appearance in Logan Paul and Mike Majlak’s IMPAULSIVE podcast, Brianna Chickenfry found herself in the centre of a fresh controversy after she questioned the age of influencer Clavicular and suggested he may have misrepresented himself years earlier. The buzz began when fans connected an old bar security video with his current age, prompting speculation about whether he was underage when working the job.The discussion immediately went viral, and users analyzed trends and security measures of the nightlife. Some of them rejected the assertions on the basis of harmless confusion by other people with some claiming that the math offers valid questions.During the podcast conversation, Brianna Chickenfry recalled recognizing Clavicular from a past event and expressed doubt about his stated age. She described hosting a bar event in Cape Cod where he worked security and later noticing the clip had resurfaced online.Chickenfry claimed, “He was my security guard three years ago and this video like it went viral and he was a security guard down Cape Cod like I threw an event at a bar and he was our security guard. This is why I think he's lying about his age. He was literally security guard in 2022, 2023.”She added, “You can't be a security guard at a bar until how old? To which Logan Paul replied, Yeah, because he's 20 now allegedly.So that would put him at 17 if you're saying.”Mike Majlak also added, “Here's why. Here's why he's actually 20 because he can't, he can't get into bars and clubs. He's not old enough. So like that's like if anything like he's, he's, he's getting mogged by all the security guards at the different entrances. Cause why would he do that, dude? It's not, he's not gesture maxing.

Cam Newton show was over and he found out from a late-night email

Cam Newton is already turning the ‘106 & Sports’ check into a 2026 college tailgate tour

Former NFL MVP Cam Newton’s BET show ""106 & Sports"" is done after just eight episodes. BET told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution it will not order another season after the 2025 run, though the episodes from Oct. 15 to Dec. 3 remain on BET platforms.The news hit in mid-February 2026, months after taping wrapped. It comes right as Newton’s own comments and podcasts are back in the spotlight and just as he says he found out he was canceled by email, not a phone call. Instead of sitting in that, he is already flipping the short TV run into a 2026 college tailgate tour.""106 & Sports"" was built as a sports spin on ""106 & Park,"" co-hosted by Newton and Ashley Nicole Moss, produced by LeBron James and Maverick Carter’s SpringHill Company, and filmed at Tyler Perry Studios in Atlanta. It pulled in names like Brittney Griner, Claressa Shields, and Chad Johnson but never found the ratings or engagement BET wanted during a wider leadership reset at the network.On his ""4th&1 with Cam Newton"" podcast, Newton said he found out the Cam Newton show was done while going through a new rundown that suddenly turned into a cancellation notice. “When the show got sent to me, and I went through it, I said, okay, this [is] the hot topic.This is the first step. Hold on. What? We want it done,” he said. “Oh my goodness. I said, I thought we were going, I thought we had chemistry, I thought we had an understanding. I thought we were locked in.”He added that the email blindsided him late at night. “It’s unfortunate, though. That’s how I found out. Dang. I found out when you sent the show. And how it typically works, you typically send a show the day before. These are the topics that we are thinking about. I was completely taken aback. Clenched pearls.”Newton also made it clear it was never technically his show. BET and SpringHill owned it. He was on-air talent attached to a brand he called “something so prestigious, so iconic, something so cultural, and black with the 106 name.”Moss publicly showed support for everyone involved, writing on X that she was sad the show would not continue and wishing Newton and the crew well. The tone from her side has stayed professional, even as fans debate whether low ratings, BET’s strategy shift, or Newton’s own comments helped push the series to a quick end.Whatever the mix of reasons, the cancellation of the Cam Newton Show became official in February 2026. Newton has already moved the conversation to what comes next. On the same ""4th&1"" episode, he said he plans to pour the money he made from ""106 & Sports"" straight into his own project. “In the fall of 2026, I’m going to take every nickel, penny, dime, dollar that was given to me on this project. I’m going to reinvest it with the 4th&1 with Cam Newton College tailgate,” he said.He laid out a tour that hits HBCUs, PWIs, and campuses across the country, built around showing up in person and tapping into each school’s culture. In his words, “when you have the backing of Iconic Saga, when you have the backing of producers like yourself with people that share the vision of what you want, it’s HBCUs, it’s PWIs, it’s colleges around the nation and universities around the nation that we’re able to go on campus and garner their culture. ”Newton has already built a second act across TV and digital. He has a multi-year deal with ESPN and a growing role on ""First Take,"" while ""Funky Friday"" and ""4th&1 with Cam Newton"" give him direct access to his audience on YouTube and podcast feeds. Even with ""106 & Sports"" gone after a short 2025 run, he is treating it as a paid lesson and a launchpad, not a dead end.","Former NFL MVP Cam Newton’s BET show ""106 & Sports"" is done after just eight episodes.

Live stream confrontation turns physical between Larry Wheels and Deen the Great



The “FAFO” trend actions, bringing quick consequences, played out live on camera this week. Boxer Deen the Great, whose real name is Nurideen Shahid Shabazz, was involved in an awkward confrontation during Quinton “Rampage” Jackson’s double-date livestream. What began as a relaxed and friendly stream quickly turned tense after Deen the Great approached powerlifter and influencer Larry Wheels and his wife, Sheyla Wheels. He then started to behave in a manner which many viewers found disrespectful.Viewers active on the live stream said Shabazz appeared intoxicated and repeatedly ignored warnings. He openly tried to flirt with Sheyla while Larry Wheels stood beside her. The moment shocked viewers, and even Quinton “Rampage” Jackson stepped in to calm things down. However, the situation escalated when the 25-year-old kept pushing boundaries. Eventually, Wheels lost his patience and physically intervened, creating a viral moment. The moment is now spreading rapidly across combat sports and social media platforms.According to viewers, Nurideen Shahid Shabazz approached Sheyla Wheels and asked if he could hug her in front of her husband.Wheels immediately blocked him and made it clear that he needed to respect boundaries. Quinton “Rampage” Jackson also warned him not to insult or disrespect Wheels. Jackson even joked briefly by pretending to hug Sheyla himself, then apologized, hoping to defuse the tension.But Shabazz continued arguing. He complained that Wheels had spun him around and said he would not show respect. He also claimed the woman was fair game, which made the situation worse. When he moved closer again and attempted to touch her, Larry Wheels finally reacted. The powerlifter struck Shabazz across the face with a sharp slap that pushed him out of the camera frame. Afterwards, Wheels said he had been waiting for the moment, while Jackson laughed and told the boxer to leave.This was not Shabazz’s first controversy. At a December Misfits Boxing press event before his fight with Amado Vargas, he insulted Vargas’ mother from the stage, telling her to stay out of the situation and go back to the kitchen. The comments caused backlash. Months later, Vargas defeated him by unanimous decision, handing Shabazz his first career loss. Since then, he has not fought again.","Larry Wheels slaps Deen the Great after he flirts with wife Sheyla Wheels on Quinton “Rampage” Jackson’s double-date livestream.

They stressed that someone of his stature deserves humane treatment, medical care from specialists of his choosing, regular family access, and fair legal proceedings without delay.The appeal underscored cricket’s long-standing role in fostering respect beyond rivalry, urging authorities to uphold principles of decency and justice.

Everything to Know About the Rashee Rice and Dacoda Jones Lawsuit

Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Rashee Rice is once again under intense scrutiny as his longtime former partner, Dacoda Jones, has officially filed a high-profile civil lawsuit against him. The legal filing comes after months of public speculation and social media posts, escalating the situation from internet allegations to a formal courtroom battle. Jones, who is the mother of Rice’s two children, is seeking more than $1 million in damages, alleging a horrific history of domestic violence that spanned nearly two years.The details within the lawsuit are deeply concerning. Jones describes a ""nightmare"" period between December 2023 and July 2025, during which she claims Rice subjected her to a consistent pattern of physical brutality. According to the court documents, the alleged abuse included choking, hitting, headbutting, and strangling.One of the most serious aspects of the claim is that much of this violence allegedly occurred while Jones was pregnant. In addition to physical injuries like bruising, swelling, and bleeding, the lawsuit also describes aggressive behavior such as Rice punching walls, breaking furniture, and throwing objects at her during fits of rage.The NFL has confirmed that it is actively investigating these claims under its Personal Conduct Policy. This is a precarious situation for Rice because he is already on thin ice with the league. In 2024, Rice was involved in a high-speed multi-car crash in Dallas, which led to a six-game suspension at the start of the 2025 season and a sentence of five years' probation.Under the NFL’s rules, Rice is now considered a repeat offender. If the league’s investigation finds the domestic violence allegations to be credible, he could face a significantly harsher penalty than his previous suspension. Some analysts suggest he could be looking at a full-season ban or even indefinite suspension, which would put his future in the league in serious jeopardy.Currently, Rashee Rice has not been criminally charged in relation to these specific claims, and he has remained largely silent when questioned by the media. While the Chiefs have acknowledged the situation, they are waiting for the legal process and the NFL’s internal review to conclude before taking further action. For now, the focus remains on the district court where Jones’s $1 million lawsuit will proceed.","Rashee Rice's former partner, Dacoda Jones, has officially filed a civil lawsuit against him.

Toronto Maple Leafs recall defenseman William Villeneuve during the Winter Olympics 2026

William Villeneuve | Practice | January 30, 2026

The Toronto Maple Leafs have recently recalled a promising defenseman, William Villeneuve, from the AHL's Toronto Marlies, providing him a key opportunity to be a part of the club in the NHL, amid the Winter Olympics break. As reported by the club, Villeneuve was called up by the Maple Leafs on Wednesday.This opportunity came for Villeneuve as the Toronto Maple Leafs have taken on players taking part in the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan. As per reports, amidst this Olympic break, the NHL squad has returned to practice this week. It is to be noted that Villeneuve is a fourth-round pick in the 2020 NHL Draft.As per reports, he has spent four professional seasons with the Marlies, amassing 12 goals and 96 assists in 203 AHL games. Last season, he broke out with 40 points (4 goals, 36 assists) in 55 games, leading the team's defense in scoring and posting a +17 rating.To strengthen the team’s defense line, the Toronto Maple Leafs have recently announced that they’ve recalled defenseman William Villeneuve from the AHL's Toronto Marlies during the ongoing Olympic Games. The decision was made to add an extra defenseman at the practices for the time being while they await Oliver Ekman-Larsson‘s return, who is currently representing Sweden at the Olympics.Though Villeneuve has prior experience in the AHL, the 23-year-old player doesn't have any NHL experience yet. As per reports, Villeneuve played 55 games last season for the Marlies and recorded 36 assists. In addition to this, he has also recorded four goals and 40 points in 55 games during the 2024-25 campaign, before registering two assists in two playoff games.In this season, he has scored around 18 points through 40 games, and also has recorded 3 goals and 15 assists with the Marlies, despite the team's struggles. It is to be noted that the 23-year-old is also ranked as Toronto's second-best defensive prospect, as claimed by Terry Koshan of the Toronto Sun. But, his puck-moving skills address a need on the Leafs' blue line beyond Ekman-Larsson and Morgan Rielly.Reports suggest that for now, William Villeneuve will be only allowed to take part in the Leafs practices while the roster is short-staffed, marking his first promotion this year. As Toronto is facing challenges and a potential trade deadline shuffle, signs show that Villeneuve could make an NHL debut soon, boosting his path to the big club.","The Toronto Maple Leafs have recalled William Villeneuve from the AHL's Toronto Marlies.

All about Abhishek Sharma’s lonely net session in Ahmedabad

Brief scores

It's been four games and four wins but India are yet to have a complete performance with the bat in the ongoing T20 World Cup. Unlike the appetisers served in the bilateral which preceded the multi-nation tournament, the main course has fallen far short of expectations. The Men in Blue have had different heroes bail them out of precarious situations in all four games but it could well become a tight position in the Super 8 stage. Suryakumar Yadav vs USA, Ishan Kishan and Hardik Pandya vs Namibia, Ishan again vs Pakistan and now Shivam Dube's firepower at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Wednesday.The opening has been the biggest concern as the World No.1 T20I batter Abhishek Sharma is yet to score a run in the tournament. It exposed Tilak Varma early, and his newfound obsession of farming strike without showing any intent has sucked momentum from the innings. Surya's watchful start has further allowed opponents to apply a choke in the middle overs, meaning the lower order does most of the heavy lifting.Ishan has been India's primary aggressor, but after he walked off in the fifth over of the innings, the Netherlands gained significant control when Tilak combined with Surya in the middle overs.Together the duo faced 28 deliveries and scored only 30 runs. There was an early reprieve for the Indian captain and the fluency was far from ideal against an attack which stuck to their plans and was very disciplined in front of a capacity crowd.The boundaries had dried up and a sense of desperation was creeping in, prompting an immediate move. Tilak was back after scoring 31 off 27 and Surya found the fielder in the deep ending his knock at 34 off 28 balls. When the runs dried up, Dube, the gladiator, took matters into his own hands and was impeccable with his shot selection. There was a cautious effort by the opposition to mix pace but Dube was not falling in the trap. He seemed to be reading it well off the hand and his approach wasn't premeditated. The ball was hit where it was supposed to be hit, and there were no half-measures.With six sixes and four boundaries, he injected much needed urgency into the innings and even when Hardik was going at run-a-ball at the other end, Dube's approach kept India on course of a big total. The partnership between the two raced to 76 off just 35 balls, doing significant damage control for the cautiousness exhibited by the earlier right-left pair of Surya and Tilak in the innings.Chasing 194 runs on a pitch that offered something for bowlers was always going to be a daunting task for the Netherlands. They managed well against the new ball pairing of Jasprit Bumrah and Arshdeep Singh but had no response for Varun Chakravarthy. The mystery spinner, India's trump card in the tournament, picked three wickets in as many overs - two of those coming off consecutive deliveries, as the Netherlands batter looked clueless when he unzipped his bag of tricks.In their last group game, Surya used as many as seven bowlers - even giving an over to Abhishek Sharma - to ensure everyone is warmed up for the big game against South Africa on February 22. Lower-ranked teams have exposed the Indian batters' weakness on multiple occasions in the last couple of weeks and the defending champions will want to resolve this before hitting the business end of the tournament.Gerhard Erasmus, Aryan Dutt, Salman Agha, Saim Ayub and Usman Tariq have given enough cues for the teams set to face India in the Super 8. Aiden Markram (South Africa), Roston Chase (West Indies) and Sikandar Raza (Zimbabwe) will be eagerly waiting for Surya & Co.India 193/6 in 20 overs (Shivam Dube 66, Suryakumar Yadav 34; Logan van Beek 3/56, Aryan Dutt 2/19)Netherlands 176/7 in 20 overs (Bas de Leede 33, Zach Lion-Cachet 26; Varun Chakravarthy 3/14, Shivam Dube 35/2)",Shivam Dube hit six sixes and four boundaries in India's 193-6.

Franchise anchor, but unrealistic dream





Themade a major roster move in early February 2026, trading for. Golden State sent Jonathan Kuminga and Buddy Hield to Atlanta, signaling a clear shift toward competing now rather than building for the future.Porzingis has started adjusting to a lineup that includes Stephen Curry, Draymond Green, and Jimmy Butler. His arrival has led to questions around the league about how much he can change the team’s outlook and whether the risk attached to his health is worth it.General manager Mike Dunleavy pursued Porzingis to improve scoring and spacing in the frontcourt after Jimmy Butler suffered a season-ending injury. The trade became official on February 4 and reflected urgency from a team still focused on the playoffs.Letting go of Kuminga meant losing a young forward with long-term upside, while Hield’s departure removed reliable outside shooting. The Warriors accepted that cost to add a skilled seven-footer with prior championship experience in Boston.Porzingis came off the bench in his debut and has shared minutes with Quinten Post and Al Horford as the coaching staff works through rotations.Since the trade, Kristaps Porzingis has averaged about 17-20 points per game, hit over 40 percent of his threes in some appearances, collected 8-10 rebounds, and offered rim protection despite limited playing time.He can shoot from deep, which works well alongside Curry’s constant movement and long-range shooting. Defenses have to spread out to cover both of them, and that opens up room for everyone else. That extra space could make it easier for the team to adjust while Butler is out.The concern is availability. Porzingis has played only a handful of games since the deal, and his injury history remains part of any evaluation. He is also 30, which adds to the debate about long-term value.Porzingis has built his reputation on outside shooting and shot blocking, with a career three-point mark above 35 percent. Critics point to uneven defense and frequent injuries when arguing he is overrated.Before the trade, he averaged 17.1 points and 5.1 rebounds on efficient shooting. Some analysts have placed him among the league’s most overrated players due to declining athleticism. The Warriors are not expecting a franchise-level star, but rather a player who can raise their ceiling without forcing a full roster reset.Golden State Warriors had been linked to Giannis Antetokounmpo , but no trade developed. He publicly committed to Milwaukee, where he continues to play alongside his brothers Thanasis and Alex on a team sitting around the middle of the standings.With that option gone, the Warriors turned to a more realistic addition in Porzingis.Porzingis is not the star Golden State once hoped to land, but he gives them size, shooting, and lineup flexibility. If he stays on the court, the trade could help their postseason chances. If not, the decision to move young talent will face stronger scrutiny.","Kristaps Porzingis, nicknamed 'The Unicorn', is averaging 17.1 points, 5.1 rebounds, and 2.7 assists.

Governments promised support; communities offered sorrow.But over the past year, the global gaze has shifted to a different kind of widow, one not draped in quiet despair, but in spotlight and strategy. Over the past year, the world has been eagle-eyed over a particular widow. Talking, not about her loss but gain, not regret but happiness and not sympathy but indifference, all to remind her that they are watching and judging. That woman is Erika Kirk, widow of Charlie Kirk , founder of Turning Point USA.Ever since the assassination of her husband on September 10, 2025, at Utah Valley University, Erika has suddenly jumped into the limelight. But as much as she is illuminated by the spotlight on her, people are much more focused on the shadow behind her. The question echoing across media platforms is not simply who she is, but what kind of widow she has chosen to be.Born Erika Frantzve in November 1988 in Scottsdale, Arizona, she was raised by her mother in a Catholic household after her parents’ divorce.A political science graduate and former NCAA women’s basketball player, Erika’s early life blended discipline, ambition, and visibility.Before meeting Charlie Kirk, Erika was making it in life or trying to, like every other woman on the internet. She began her career as a model and won Miss Arizona USA in 2012. At 17, she set up a non-profit Everyday Heroes, aiming to promote existing charitable foundations in her community.A year after meeting Kirk, she set up a faith-based fashion brand Proclaim and also created her own religious podcast, Midweek Rise Up. She guest-starred in an episode of the Bravo reality series 'Summer House' in 2019. Before becoming the ideal conservative tradwife and taking over TPUSA, Erika's last job was as a real estate agent in New York with The Corcoran Group, a real estate agency founded by Shark Tank investor Barbara Corcoran.At 37, Erika Kirk is the CEO and chairperson of TPUSA, a conservative youth organisation co-founded by her slain activist husband. The couple met in 2018, when Kirk was interviewing Erika for a job at the Turning Point USA office. He invited her to a burger restaurant in New York and realised she was ""beautiful, smart, elegant and Christ-like"" which led him to ask her out on a date, leading to marriage in 2021. Together they built the image of a modern conservative family—faith-driven, politically active, homeschooling parents of two. That image would fracture in 2025.The first time the world saw Erika Kirk after her husband's death was in a video filmed in the studio where he used to record his podcast, The Charlie Kirk Show. ""You have no idea of the fire that you have ignited within this wife, the cries of this widow will echo around the world like a battle cry,"" she said before describing Kirk as the ""perfect"" husband and father. A week later she had been announced as the new CEO of TPUSA.However, she appeared in public on September 21st, 2025 at a memorial service in memory of Kirk at State Farm Stadium in Arizona. The memorial which began with a shocking firework included her forgiving her husband's murderer Tyler Robinson and also sharing a hug with US President Donald Trump.Over the course of the past year, Erika has gone on tours, interviews and hosted events as the head of the right-wing organisation that has been attached to Trump at the hip since 2016. She has firmly positioned herself as a political force rather than a grieving recluse. And that, perhaps, is the rupture.Gender roles have helped decide much of the trajectory of a man's and a woman's life in advance. From being a kid to a partner, the roles and responsibilities are pretty much the same for everyone, except for the timing. While some are able to follow the script entirely others face hiccups and exits.Widowhood is one such hiccup, the arrival of this stage in life is never expected and least, prepared for. Not because one doesn't know what to do now, but because they don't understand how to follow the path laid down by society already and just accept it as it is. Across cultures and centuries, widowhood has come with choreography.For women in the Victorian era this meant donning black, two years of isolation and mourning, only leaving the house for church, and waiting for her husband's will to reveal if she was rich or penniless.In South Asia, especially in countries like India, women donned white clothing, shaved their heads, and depended on their husbands' relatives. Till the 19th century, it also involved the custom of Sati, where a widow would immolate herself on her husband's pyre, willingly or unwillingly.African widows followed periods of mourning, cutting their hair, changing their name, along with rituals of cleansing and even becoming the younger brother's wife in some cultures.Islamic women practised a waiting period called Iddah of four months and ten days before considering remarriage. Widowhood has rarely been neutral. It is prescriptive. It demands silence, modesty, and containment. Erika Kirk appears to have declined the script.Critics describe her as theatrical—bold eyeliner replacing the traditional widow’s veil, speeches oscillating between tears and laughter, high-energy events instead of hushed remembrance.When it comes to being a widow, Erika has been teetering away from the guidelines since the very beginning. Earlier, the woman was an ideal housewife and claimed to ""love submitting to Charlie."" She was the idol of every conservative household that was swayed by TPUSA. She joined her husband in his tours, home-schooled her kids and portrayed the picture of every conservative American family that followed the path of god.However, post the death of her husband, Erika stopped ticking the societal boxes. Rather than weeping at home and greeting visitors who came to mourn, she was on a phone call with TPUSA employees, just 15 days after the assassination, ensuring them that everything was ""stable and safe.""Unlike most public personalities in politics, she was not ushered in as the new head by some established figure, she took the helm herself. Rather than being spotted protecting her children or supporting her in-laws, she is seen crying AND laughing on stage, preaching the right path of Christianity to the American youth.And for all of this, the last thing she needed was public support. Erika is backed by the President and Vice President of the United States of America. She has her hands and mind on an organisation that has already been set up for success and now, the only task on her hands is to ensure that people are watching.This, she makes do in her own way. From her 'demonic' stare to reality TV past, from hosting an alternate Super Bowl half-time show to subtly removing her wedding photo from her husband's bookshelf. Erika has people obsessed with everything she does, in sympathy or hate. And as an observer on the internet, you could call this a planned character assassination of a woman or a strategic plan of relevance executed by a sharp-minded widow.For supporters, this is resilience. For critics, it is a contradiction. But is it hypocrisy or evolution forced by circumstance?If you go into the base of Erika Kirk's tussle with the media, it all lies in her being a female. As a matter of fact, the very behaviour she executes stands against the organisation's aspirations for women. As per a Southern Poverty Law Center report, at a TPUSA conference for young women before Kirk's death both he and Erika emphasised the importance of young women choosing to have families and leave the workforce. “I don’t want you to be chasing a paycheck and a title and a corner office and sacrifice such a short window” to have children, Erika told the audience, while Charlie told young women to “be clear” that the reason to go to college is to obtain an “MRS degree”—that is, to find a husband.But Erika's situation is different. She is now a widow, who has dabbled in numerous careers and stuck to none. The only stable and massive source of income she has is TPUSA along with her media interviews and appearances. When asked about balancing her role as a new CEO and a mother, she herself said there is ""no such thing as balance."" ""There is really no blueprint for what I’m going through. It’s really a one-of-one type of situation,"" she said. Thus, even if it was not her passion for the limelight, or need for a career, she would have had to pick a job.A video of her 2014 audition for 'The Amazing Race' along with her boyfriend at the time, JT Massey had the internet in shock. But isn't it normal? Don't numerous women, men and couples audition for reality shows in their lives? And many have a dating life prior to the one they get married to. Why is it a problem for her to have done reality TV or dated men before Kirk?Many might argue that she hasn't practised what she preaches, as is obvious in her speeches, but then, who hasn't been changed trajectories in life?The only difference is that once Erika Kirk was just another American conservative wife, confined to the worship of god and the boundaries of her home. Now, she has taken her man's place, his stage, his organisation. And thus, a world that wanted nothing to do with her, is now enraged at her for doing everything.There are women being killed in Iran for protesting against the administration, in America one was fatally shot down by ICE in Minnesota and another was dragged away from her car by agents. Yet as a society or social media user, one is more obsessed with Erika Kirk. Why? Because fighting for a woman- her rights, her freedom, is against the agenda of fighting against her- her behaviour, her operations.Men in the spotlight have had much more scandalous lives than Erika Kirk, but they are not trending on X every week. The owner of the app itself has fourteen children from multiple different women and he can still be a ""tech tycoon"". The President can have attended Jeffrey Epstein's parties and still bravely claim to have no connection to a convicted child sex offender. But can Erika Kirk not have a life after her husband?When a widow who steps into power, speaks loudly, and appears unbroken? That unsettles. The backlash may reveal less about Erika Kirk and more about what society expects from women in grief.Conspiracy theories are the life of internet users. From Erika Kirk having plotted her husband's murder to her ""demonic"" stare and ""fake"" crying, everything sparks up a suspicion. From sociopath to psychopath, followers of different principles have dubbed her personality with every term on the internet.While her behaviour can completely be attributed to a single woman ensuring that all her tasks are done to the T, people fixate on her usage of fireworks, crying sessions mid-interviews and connections to the who's and who's of America.This is where, a curious parallel of one of the most famous American widows of the Gilded Age, Theresa Fair Oelrich comes to life. Oelrich approached social supremacy like an experienced engineer, mapping out human relations and engagements with extreme precision. In 1871, Theresa Fair was born in Virginia, Nevada in a family that had earned its wealth from mining. Her father James Graham Fair struck what came to be known as the 'Big Bonanza' in 1872, the largest deposit of gold and silver ever discovered in American history. Her mother, Theresa Rooney Fair was a former boarding operator, divorced her husband in 1883, citing habitual adultery and gained custody of the couple's two daughters while the father kept the sons.Soon in childhood, Tessie realised that money could take you to the best of places and have you accepted in any social circle. At 18, she met Herman Oelrichs, a 40-year-old Yale-educated man belonging to an established Baltimore family. The pair tied the knot in 1890 in San Francisco and represented the merger of new money with old prestige.While the couple settled in their lavish mansion at the 5th Avenue, Tessie's interests lay at Newport, where America's wealthiest families conducted social warfare through invitation lists and elaborate parties. In 1891, she and her husband purchased Rosecliff, an oceanfront property known for its rose gardens and commissioned Stanford White to create her an 'American Versailles'. Constructed for $2.5 million back then, the palace boasted of Newport's largest ballroom and 30 rooms. Tessie's prowess of social engineering lay bare in the fact that she manipulated her way into the triumvirate, consisting of Mamie Fish, Alva Vanderbilt Belmont and herself, controlling the access to the American high society.Tessie was known to keep detailed records on every suitable and unsuitable guest and even had a list of her employees, segregated into good, bad and rotten. By the 1900s, no social season was complete without appearances at Rosecliff. In 1904, she hosted Bal Blanc, which came to be known as one of the most legendary parties of the Gilded Age. She imported white swans to float in the fountains and commissioned the construction of 12 full-sized white ships to be illuminated in the night with guests dressed strictly in white. Through her sheer force of will, Tessie had established herself at the supremacy of the elite American society, all the while her marriage existed in a cracked gulf. In 1906 when Herman died, he left his entire estate to his brother, leaving Tessie to survive on the money she inherited from her father and revealing the truth about the life of a gilded queen.If by now you have found it difficult to relate Tessie to Erika Kirk, a simple explanation might just be enough. During her childhood, Erika realised the importance of a successful life and money, just like every child raised by a single parent does. Throughout her life growing up, she has ventured into every field be it entertainment or fashion to be able to create a name for herself in the world.Finding love in Charlie Kirk, may have been fate, but it did help her gain a stable ground in the American social circle, possibly a dream of hers. While being Kirk's wife gave her just the perfect amount of interaction and reprieve from social engagements, his loss pushed her to the brink. It was a do-or-die situation, she could either cement herself and her future by rising and taking the power into her hands, or wait for the world to decide whether she would have a place in the Kirk empire or not.Resembling Tessie's sheer will of power, Erika has made herself a part of America's modern triumvirate, consisting of Melania Trump, Usha Vance and herself. Together these three hold the access to America's elite, whether you like it or not. The fireworks, the weeping are all a part of the performances in her ballroom to keep America participating. And the alternate Super Bowl halftime show, was her Bal Blanc. Like Tessie, she appears to understand that visibility is currency and that in elite circles, power rarely waits for permission.Widowhood today has no universal blueprint. In a hyper-digital age, grief unfolds under algorithmic scrutiny. Tears are replayed. Outfits dissected. Body language analysed. The internet does not simply observe widows, it audits them. And perhaps that is why Erika Kirk provokes such intensity. She is not invisible. She did not recede. She did not dim. She stepped forward.What example is she setting? To conservative purists, she complicates the narrative of submission and domestic priority. To feminists sceptical of her politics, she represents power built atop structures they oppose. To observers fatigued by performative outrage, she may simply be a woman navigating grief and survival in real time. And perhaps what unsettles the world most is this: she is neither saint nor villain, just a widow who refused to disappear. In an age where women are still expected to shrink in sorrow, that alone is enough to ignite fireworks.","Erika Kirk is the widow of Charlie Kirk, founder of Turning Point USA.

Tyson Fury and John Fury relationship under spotlight as heavyweight comeback raises questions

Tyson Fury is stepping back into boxing again, and this time the biggest debate is not about his opponent but it is about his family. The former heavyweight champion, who announced retirement after losing twice to Oleksandr Usyk in late 2024, is returning to the ring for another comeback fight scheduled in London. Fury’s decision has already sparked strong reactions, especially from his father, John Fury, who publicly said he is unhappy with the way things are going.The comeback has quickly become a talking point because Fury’s inner circle appears divided. While the boxer is focused on training and preparing for his next challenge, his family worries about his health and the direction of his career. Reports also suggest tension at home, making the buildup to his return feel more personal than sporting. As Fury prepares for another high-pressure fight, questions about family support and long-term safety are growing louder.John Fury has openly shared his frustration, saying he feels pushed away from his son’s team. Speaking to the Daily Mail, he explained that people around Tyson have influenced their relationship.He said, “I don’t think he listens to me because of the people around him. I just think there have been that many people in his ear about me… If you get told enough times, ‘your father’s this, your father’s that,’ you start believing it.”John has worked closely with Tyson since the start of his career, so his comments carry weight. Even though he supports his son’s return, he wants him fully prepared.He added, “I want to see him coming in against this man with a pair of shoulders, big, solid, muscled up for him. I don’t want to see a thin, fat guy who’s done a bit of skipping and some bag work.”Tyson Fury has also admitted family relationships have been tense.In another interview with the Daily Mail, he said his father, brothers, and even his wife Paris had stopped speaking to him for a period.At the same time, Fury says recent events made him rethink life and push toward another fight.Now, as the London bout gets closer, the focus is not only on boxing skills but also on whether Tyson Fury can balance family pressure, public expectation, and one more shot at success inside the ring.","Tyson Fury is returning to the ring for another comeback fight scheduled in London.
