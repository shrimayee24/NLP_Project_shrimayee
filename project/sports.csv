Kofi Kingston Throws Shade at WWE Raw Audience

For the first time in over eight years, The New Day has gone through a dramatic character change that has shocked the audience and set off debates across the WWE Universe. Of late, Kofi Kingston and Xavier Woods have turned heel, rejecting their longtime friend and former stablemate Big E from being their manager. The shocking betrayal reached its height on Monday's episode of WWE Raw when Kingston and Woods tried to address their actions and were greeted by flooded ""boos"" from the crowd in Wichita, Kansas. Kingston took to the X platform to spill the tea on the backstage drama.Kingston’s X (formerly known as Twitter) post reads, ""I'm still so incredibly disappointed in the people of Wichita, Kansas for not letting us speak, I'm also disappointed in the WWE Universe for your lack of sympathy on social media platforms. I really think that if you'd just hear us out, you'd change your minds.""The disappointment has become all greater with the fact that Big E hasn't wrestled since March 2022 due to an apparent neck injury raising concerns about whether he may ever make a return to the ring. Though he has come out, speculating if his retirement would be better dependent on his health, he has also been included in a recent New Day storyline that is being debated on possibilities for a return.Fans were left heartbroken as Kingston and Woods coldly dismissed Big E, who had once been the heart and soul of their trio. The New Day's rejection of their former leader has added an emotional depth to the storyline and made it one of WWE's most compelling narratives heading into 2024.This heel turn marks a seismic transformation for the group that has created a legacy as one of WWE's most successful and entertaining factions. Their babyface run of eight years allowed them to win a slew of tag team titles while becoming icons of positivity and fun. With this full embrace of their darker side, fans get ready for a new chapter filled with fresh rivalries and surprising twists.ALSO READ: Rhea Ripley Spilled Beans on Dominik Mysterio's 'Daddy Issues' As fans await further developments, one thing is clear; The New Day's heel turn has freshened up their narrative and revived programming on WWE.

How can India still qualify for World Test Championship final?

IND vs AUS: Rohit Sharma has had a terrible time with the bat in whites

NEW DELHI: India pacer Mohammed Siraj responded to the ICC 's penalty over his send-off gesture to Australian batter Travis Head , during the pink-ball Test in Adelaide, with a composed statement while digressing from the burning issue.According to a report in Sydney Morning Herald, pace duo Siraj and Jasprit Bumrah did not participate in Tuesday's morning practice session in Adelaide, with only four days remaining before the Brisbane Test at the Gabba.During the team's batting and bowling practice at the nets, Siraj was questioned about his response to the penalty, which amounts to approximately AUD 16,500 or Rs 8,95,340.Replying to the question, Siraj said, ""Yeah man, it’s all good.""When asked further whether he was upset by it, the Indian pacer said, ""I am going to the gym now.""The incident took place on Day 2 after Head's dismissal by Siraj's yorker, which ended his match-winning innings of 140 runs from 141 deliveries.

Rishabh Pant trusted his defence before unleashing an assault on the Australian attack last time he was at Gabba. (Photo by Saeed Khan/AFP via Getty Images)

India will hope a return to The Gabba can inspire batter to reprise past heroics

IND vs AUS: India batting has been a major cause of worry

BRISBANE: Now, as then, India appear bereft of hope heading into a Gabba showdown. Now, as then, India will look to their miracle man to deliver.In the 20-odd months Rishabh Pant spent away from the longer format while recovering from his car accident, there hasn't been a Test match played in which his absence wasn't a talking point.It is perhaps once in a generation that a batter redefines the bounds of the possible. For this era, Pant is the man and Gabba was the ground.To understand the true impact of Pant in red-ball cricket, it's worth revisiting Jan 2021, the later part of the Australian summer, and the 138-ball 89 not out at the venue which helped a depleted India chase down 328, 324 of those runs on the final day.Pant was 23 then, just 15 Tests old, and his knock helped break Australia's 32-year undefeated streak at the ground.That time, India still needed 161 runs, with 56.4 overs having played out, when Pant walked in to bat. In the final session, from about 37 overs, India needed 158. Cheteshwar Pujara importantly helped one end firm, but his eventual strike rate of 26.54 before Pat Cummins got him out with the second new ball would have, at best, helped save the game, not win it. It did help take the game deep, though, along with Shubman Gill's 91.A few overs before that second new ball was due, Pant went on the rampage, hitting Lyon straight out of the ground, slashing the likes of Starc past backward point, hooking Cummins for six, cheekily notching up boundaries over the slip cordon and generally embracing a limited-overs approach which knocked the wind of Australia's pace battery.It was an onslaught not yet considered within the realms of the possible in a Test match chase.The knock predated Brendon McCullum 's appointment in May 2022 as England's Test coach and the start of the ' Bazball ' era of consciously adopting a high-risk, high-strike-rate batting approach to stir things up in the red-ball game.Perhaps it's not presumptuous to say England doesn't own the copyright to 'Bazball', Pant does. In his wake have followed the Yashasvi Jaiswals and Nitish Kumar Reddys, who have shed the diffidence of earlier eras away from home.Rohit Sharma said so, in as many words, in March earlier this year in Dharamshala, as the home series against England was winding down to a close. Ben Duckett had made the outrageous assumption, no doubt tongue firmly in cheek, that Yashasvi Jaiswal's breezy daddy hundreds were a result of 'Bazball' rubbing off on India's youngsters. ""There was a guy called Rishabh Pant in our team, probably Ben Duckett hasn't seen him play,"" Rohit chuckled.Now, as in 2021, the onus is on India's young breed of batters to bail them out of a rut, especially with some seniors struggling for form. Can Pant alter the course of a series which appears to be tilting Australia's way?In 2021, Pant was breezy but he wasn't looking to be in a frenzy all the time. His eventual strike rate of 64.49 was enough to win India the game. It is this balance that he has struggled to recapture this time.No doubt, his long absence, the severe injuries he picked up in the accident and subsequent major operations, have all had a role to play in this. Perhaps he is also putting too much pressure on himself?Since Pant announced his Test comeback with a century against Bangladesh in Chennai, his returns have been inconsistent, apart from the 99 in Bengaluru followed by 60 and 64 against New Zealand in Mumbai. After that Chennai ton, Rohit had said, ""We always knew what Rishabh could do with the bat. It was just about getting him back and giving him that game time.""In Australia, Pant's scores read 37 and 1 in Perth and 21 and 28 in Adelaide, where in the second innings under lights, his electrifying charge against Scott Boland became a talking point, including an astounding reverse-scoop off the same pacer.The next morning, though, in better batting conditions, he lasted just five more balls and looked fidgety. Was it the approach India needed at that time? Isn't Pant trusting his previously sound defensive game the way he used to?With the entire lineup floundering apart from Nitish Kumar Reddy, captain Rohit wasn't mentioning anyone in particular when he said after the Adelaide defeat, ""It's important in this short time that we have before the next Test to figure out certain things about our own selves. We hope everyone stands up to that challenge. It sometimes happens that you're trying everything and it still doesn't work out. We've had a lot of conversations about that in the group.""The glimpses of brilliance Pant showed in Adelaide may not be enough if India are to pull through this time around at the Gabba. Then again, the Pant of 2024 is in a very different place from the Pant of 2021.Amid all the expectation of another miracle, it's worth recalling that it's a miracle that Pant is back playing top-flight cricket.","Rishabh Pant scored 89 not out at The Gabba in Jan 2021. It helped India chase down 328, 324 of those runs on the final day. Pant was 23 then, just 15 Tests old, and his knock helped break Australia's 32-year undefeated streak at the ground. Now, as then, India will look to Pant to deliver.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116232452,imgsize-26360,width-400,resizemode-4/116232452.jpg"

Novak Djokovic will run out of energy: Andre Agassi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/novak-djokovic-will-run-out-of-energy-andre-agassi/articleshow/116235405.cms,"American legend

Andre Agassi

believes Djokovic will miss Federer & Nadal, the guys he came to the dance with

Excerpts:

Djokovic's longevity:

Andy Murray coaching Djokovic:

Carlos Alcaraz

and longevity…

American men haven't had results like the women:

Graf was the hardest victory I ever had: Agassi

BENGALURU: Andre Agassi wondered if the 24-time major winner Novak Djokovic would miss his greatest rivals -- the now-retired Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer -- in the last leg of a glittering career where the 37-year-old goes for more history.The eight-time Grand Slam champion, in the city for the TiE Global Summit, assessed Djokovic's run and the Serb's recent partnership with friend and rival Andy Murray in a candid chat with media.It's hard to say, Father Time always wins. He has already done so much for so long, it's hard to imagine longer. We said that about (Roger) Federer too. I think Novak will run out of energy more than capability. Cannot be easy, especially when the people you came to the dance with have left, that's a big thing.When Pete (Sampras) retired it was a blow to me, it set me back a little bit. It made me rediscover my inspirations on some level. Djokovic has lost the guys he made history with. It'll probably get tougher and tougher emotionally, but I would never bet against them. Bet against them at your peril.In any coach-student relationship you need trust and trust can take time, but it's nice when it starts with believing in somebody because you know that they know your experience. There's an asset to their history as competitors.Any success of a relationship is based on complete buy-in and that's always the part you have to wait and see. It's not what I know that changes your career, information doesn't lead to transformation, somebody has to counter that. That's the connector. I'm sure there's going to be a lot of trust immediately, we'll see how the results go.Alcaraz defends like Novak, has more power and spin like Nadal, hands and finesse like Federer but just because he has the best of all the three doesn't mean he can do what they did. There are so many parts to the game such as decision-making, injuries, luck. So how long can (Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner) do it (for)? They could do it for 20 years or not.The women's game hasn't had to deal with Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, Rafael, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, but they have their version of it. Serena Williams is the Novak of the women's game and you got Coco as a potential, like Alcaraz has potential and Sinner has potential.How the game evolves is interesting. The women's game has gotten very powerful, just straight power. For lack of a better example, Lindsay Davenport was powerful, tall, precise through the court and now you have a lot of that. There's still room for somebody who can offset that kind of power, like an Ash Barty.The men's game has changed in the sense that guys have gotten bigger with longer levers, which means they're better athletes, they can move and they need more time, they start playing further back. Soon you're going to start seeing the net game start coming back, everything morphs in its own way. But the biggest issue for American (men) not winning is an unfortunate set of decades where the guys were very stingy and very greedy -- 66 Grand Slams in the same generation. There's not a lot left there (for others)!Andre Agassi - the second of five men to achieve a career Grand Slam in the Open Era and the first man to complete a career golden slam - has won it all, including a stirring love match.""She was the hardest victory I ever had,"" said Agassi of his wife German tennis legend Steffi Graf, a 22-time major winner.Agassi, who has won eight major titles and the Olympic gold, speaking during a session at the TiE Global Summit, said, ""We all live a hero's journey - first part of life is about performing and achieving. Then life hits us with broken relationships and dreams. I went through it all. Finally, in the last phase of the journey, it's about serving others.""The 54-year-old said, ""At 28 my (tennis) career started over. Without the struggles, I would've never gotten Steffi to say yes. I tried to get her for years.""On a lighter note, Agassi said he likes to keep his trophies out of the house. ""I don't bring my trophies home, because if I bring my trophies home, then she brings her trophies home - and that's bad math!""",Andre Agassi believes Novak Djokovic will run out of energy more than capability.

"FIDE World Championship: All down to the wire with Ding, Gukesh locked at 6.5 each",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/chess/fide-world-championship-all-down-to-the-wire-with-ding-gukesh-locked-at-6-5-each/articleshow/116235288.cms,"D Gukesh will get his last two opportunities to become the 18th world champion at 18 years in Singapore. First, via the 14th and last classical game against reigning champion Ding Liren on Thursday. And if it doesn't happen, he gets a chance to disprove the notion that the Chinese is a better rapid player in tiebreak games on Friday.But before all that, what if the 32-year-old Ding wins with the white pieces and seals the deal on Thursday itself?Understandably, the Indian fans don't want this kind of heartbreak. But you never know. Ding has managed to keep that kind of intrigue.Gukesh and Ding have set up this finale after an exciting five-hour 68-move draw in the 13th game on Wednesday. The Indian challenger, world No. 5, pushed hard with white pieces. But the defending world champion, world No. 17 in live rating, was up to the task to force a draw and kept the match level at 6.5 points apiece.Both players are in the same situation for the last game: must-draw to survive and must-win to clinch the title without tiebreaks. And survival of the coolest being the well-accepted theme in such situations.Gukesh allowed Ding to go for French Defense for the third time in the match. Ding had won the opening game and drawn the fifth playing e6 as the black's first move though the variations were different.However, Gukesh's team again came up with a novelty (8.Be3) and surprised Ding. But the move of the day belonged to Ding's rook (31...Rf8) allowing the triple fork by knight on queen, rook and bishop. Ding chased the rival queen with rook and queen on successive moves and then moved his king to h8 against check. Any other move in this phase would have been curtains for Ding.Though Gukesh dared not to hide his king on h2 but brought it out to f2, queens were exchanged 10 moves later, ending all the remote chances of a victory. And though Gukesh had an extra pawn (3 vs 2) in the rook endgame, the Chinese stalwart was not going to spoil the great work he had done earlier.In a tense game, Ding again displayed his virtuosity to come up with precise defense nearing the time control and needing to make 15 moves in 15 minutes after a sub-par 8... Nb6 using 40 minutes.Besides the nervy queen, double rook, knight, vs queen, double rook, bishop (five pawns each) endgame, Wednesday's contest also witnessed all the eight squares in the a1 to h8 diagonal occupied after White's fourth move.The middle game could have been easily qualified as 'Three Knights Opposite Sides' variation. Gukesh moved his queenside knight to kingside (b1 to h5 journey) and kingside knight to queenside (g1 to c3). Ding had also taken his kingside knight to queenside (from g8 to b6).Gukesh's 17.Qf3 was not the strongest move according to engines but Ding's position at that point was far from safe. With better position without much risk and clock advantage, Gukesh's optimism was well-placed. Gukesh had managed to clear both Ding's knights outside the board in exchange of his own knight and bishop.Since the reunification of the World title in 2006, only V Anand has won the last game of the classical phase to clinch the title - against Topalov. Like Anand, even Gukesh will have black pieces in the last game. But sadly, Ding is a far more practical player than the Bulgarian. ""I want to be ready for the next classical game. Nothing else."" -Ding Liren""It's kind of fitting that we have reached Game 14. We both have shown fighting spirit and entertaining chess."" -D GukeshVishy Anand turned 55 on Wednesday. Anish Giri tweeted if Anand was calling his mentee D Gukesh for a birthday gift? The Dutch GM was referring to former champion Mikhail Tal, who on his 49th birthday asked Garry Kasparov for a gift as he was about to dethrone Anatoly Karpov in 1985 to become the youngest ever world champion. On the Chessbase India live stream, Anand was posed the question. And the five-time world champion quipped with a smile: ""Well, Anish knows his history.""","Gukesh and Ding have set up this finale after an exciting five-hour 68-move draw in the 13th game on Wednesday.

IND vs AUS: India batting has been a major cause of worry

IND vs AUS: Rohit Sharma has had a terrible time with the bat in whites

In all likelihood, India's ongoing tour could be the last one Down Under for stalwarts like Virat Kohli Rohit Sharma , Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja. But on pace-friendly Australian soil, which makes run-scoring a tough job, the focus is always on the batters and fast bowlers. And that puts the spotlight on Kohli and Rohit, who haven't been at the top of their game consistently of late.Kohli roared in Perth with a Test century after a long barren spell, but Rohit's poor run extended with scores of 3 and 6 in the two innings at Adelaide, after he missed the first Test following the birth of his child.It has also led to fans and former players questioning the legendary duo's extended run based on reputation despite not delivering, and former Australia captain Greg Chappell believes a cricket board needs the right set of selectors to have a tough word with players of the stature of Rohit and Kohli.""You know yourself whether you're at your peak or not. But they (big players) obviously love playing the game; they want to play it as long as they can, and they have every reason, every right to want to go as long as they can,"" said Chappell, who also had an infamous stint as India coach during Sourav Ganguly's captaincy days.With the players earning a lot of money while in the team, Chappell believes they want to keep going and that's when a selector's role becomes more important.""That's why you need good, robust selection policies and selection panels to make those tough decisions,"" he continued. ""It's not up to the players necessarily to make those decisions. They might want to make that decision, but it's a well-paid job. Who's going to walk away from it? Someone else has to make that decision. That's why you need robust selection panels and policies.""In his 10 innings across five Tests at home against Bangladesh and New Zealand before the tour of Australia, Rohit could score only 133 runs at an average of 13.10. In the same two series, Kohli too fared poorly and aggregated 192 runs at an average of 21.33.Chappell said talking about poor performance with big players is a tough proposition.""It's very tough. You've got to pick the right people to be selectors, the ones that are prepared to have those tough conversations...depends on the relationships between the various people in the room. But we all go through it, everyone that plays at that level. You'll have your ups and downs as a player. With good players, you prefer to give them a game too many than a game too few. So it's always tough to get that balance right,"" the Australia legend concluded.",Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli have struggled with the bat in recent weeks.

Cruise for Baroda

BENGALURU: At 36, Mumbai opener Ajinkya Rahane has taken fresh guard in T20 cricket . Continuing with his red-hot form in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy , Rahane, with a majestic 84 (45, 10x4, 3x6), powered the former champions to a six-wicket win over Vidarbha in the quarterfinals at the KSCA Alur Stadium on Wednesday.With his team chasing a competitive 222, Rahane was all class, finding the gap and timing the ball to perfection. Out-of-favour Prithvi Shaw (49, 26b, 5x4, 4x6) worked in tandem with Rahane during their 42-ball 83-run opening partnership.The early dismissal of Shreyas Iyer (5) and Suryakumar Yadav (9) did not hurt Mumbai.When Yash Thakur accounted for Rahane's wicket in the 16th over, Mumbai needed 65 runs. Rookie Suryansh Shedge (36, 12b, 1x4, 4x6), who had bagged two wickets, stepped up to change the complexion in the 17th over. The 21-year-old smashed off-spinner Mandar Mahale for three sixes and a four. His 67-run partnership with Shivam Dube (37, 22b, 1x4, 2x6) saw the team home as Shedge signaled the win with a six.Vidarbha, with half-centuries from Atharva Taide (66) and Apoorv Wankhede (51), put up a good total but their bowlers failed to stop the mighty Mumbaikars.There was a motley crowd at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium, primarily to watch Bengal pacer Mohammed Shami (2/43) and the Baroda's Pandya brothers - Krunal and Hardik. But it was Baroda's Lukman Meriwala (3/17), who stole the show, helping them win the tie easily.","Mumbai beat Vidarbha by six wickets in quarterfinals of Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy.

BUMRAH'S WORKLOAD AN ISSUE

(Stats by: Rajesh Kumar)

NEW DELHI: For most of the pink-ball Test in Adelaide, India's pace attack looked fractured. Every time Jasprit Bumrah operated, the edge returned. The only occasion where the Indian vice-captain seemed to have some support at the other end was when a face-off with Travis Head inspired Mohammed Siraj and he finished with a four-wicket haul. But for the most part, Indian pacers couldn't use the pink ball to their advantage, even under lights. It has left India to mull over the bowling combination for the third Test at Gabba , beginning this Saturday.There are no two ways about the fact that India need to take a look at the formation of their attack, while knowing that it will remain pace-dominated, especially at a venue that always has pace and bounce on offer. But there are few important points to ponder before any changes are considered.Harshit Rana remained wicketless in Adelaide after an impressive debut in Perth, followed by another good outing in the practice game in Canberra. His first Test with the pink ball didn't go according to plan, but he could make the red ball talk. And the remaining three Tests will be all red-ball games.Rana's tall frame and ability to hit the deck hard makes him capable of making the batters hop and duck on a juicy Gabba pitch, which is expected to offer more assistance withBrisbane hosting a game early in the Australian summer. Not to forget rain is predicted on all five days of the Test, which can bring the overhead conditions into play and make Rana more useful.India may strongly feel the need to replace allrounder Nitish Kumar Reddy with another pacer, most probably Akash Deep who has been one of the most impressive Indian pacers recently and waiting for his chance in Australia. But will the team do that at the cost of someone who has produced crucial runs lower down the order?Reddy has taken the Australian pacers head on with attacking cameos in Perth as well as Adelaide. India have used him sparingly as a fourth pacer and focused on his batting usefulness. If the aim is to bring in reinforcements on the bowling front, coach Gautam Gambhir and skipper Rohit Sharma could consider replacing him with Akash or the lanky Prasidh Krishna.The last time India played at the Gabba, registering a famous victory in 2021, Washington Sundar was the spinner of choice. He took four wickets and scored crucial knocks of 62 and 22, the latter of which came in a match-winning partnership under pressure with Rishabh Pant.Given his recent wicket-taking form against New Zealand, Sundar may replace senior offspinner R Ashwin. But Ashwin's credentials as a batter lower down the order are no less impressive, and his stature as India's premier spinner is unquestionable. And both have the height to extract bounce along with turn as the match progresses.Also waiting in the ranks is left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja, who is the most accomplished of the three for someone who can also produce runs down the order.Going with an all-out pace attack will be a little far-fetched and more of a gamble, when you need variation in the attack and have quality options available to do that.A comparison in performance of Indian pacers and spinners at the Gabba shows that the tweakers have played a role in India's past matches at the venue and can't be entirely overlooked.It's evident that Bumrah's body has already started taking a toll, as he had an injury scare in Adelaide, requiring medical attention after pulling up while holding his hamstring in the middle of an over. He also skipped the team's practice session on Tuesday, with speculation rife in the Australian media about his fitness.Siraj & Co will have to be more consistent and menacing in Bumrah's support and to keep up the pressure on the Australian batters, which wasn't the case when Head came on to bat in the first innings at Adelaide. With Bumrah off the attack, he took advantage and played his counter-attacking game freely to take the match away from India.The Indian management will be mindful of that and hope the bowling attack rises to the occasion as a unit.","India's over dependence on Jasprit Bumrah visible in Adelaide. India may feel the need to replace allrounder Nitish Kumar Reddy with another pacer, most probably Akash Deep. But will the team do that at the cost of someone who has produced crucial runs lower down the order? India have used him sparingly as a fourth pacer and focused on his batting usefulness.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116233856,imgsize-36010,width-400,resizemode-4/116233856.jpg"

How can India still qualify for World Test Championship final?

NEW DELHI: Travis Head 's stunning 140-run knock powered Australia to a 10-wicket win over India in the second Test in Adelaide and level the five-match series 1-1 in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy .The knock in Adelaide earned Head his eighth player-of-the-match award in just 51 Tests.Considered a big match player, Head also received the accolade in both the WTC final and the World Cup final last year, both against India.The 30-year-old has enjoyed a lot of success after being allowed to play his natural game.The official broadcaster of the series shared a video where former cricketers turned commentators shared their game plan on how India should tackle Head. Cheteshwar Pujara advised India to target Head's leg side as he has scored majority of his runs on the off-side. Pujara also advised India seamers to bowl short-pitched deliveries to Head, which the Indians did not do much in Adelaide. Pujara wanted Indian pacers to exploit the pace and bounce of the Gabba wicket and keep him on the back foot and after that, target Head's weakness outside the off-stump, with the ball coming in from an angle to dismiss him caught behind.Former Australian cricketer Matthew Hayden said, ""Certainly inside the first 30 runs that Travis Head scores there should be some short-pitched bowling. They (India pacers) should say to him 'we are coming at you short', have men around the bat, have catches in the deep and say let's take it on.""Former Indian spinner Harbhajan Singh also advised the Rohit Sharma-led side to bowl short-pitched deliveries and not bowl outside off-stump at all. Harbhajan wanted Indian to bowl the middle stump line with the balls well pitched up in the beginning of Head's innings and surprise him with bouncers, taking the cover and point fielders out of the equation, things will change then.Former Indian wicket-keeper Deep Dasgupta also lamented India's less use of the short ball in Adelaide and said the Indian seamers can take advantage of the long boundaries and extra bounce of the Gabba wicket and use the bouncers to negate the Head threat.Former Indian spinner Piyush Chawla said Head who is a headache for the Indian team, pointed out the Aussie's weakness against a short-pitched bowl aimed at his chest. Apart from that, Chawla said that Head doesn't come on the front foot too much and urged the Indian bowlers to tempt him to drive against the moving deliveries and dismiss him caught behind.The third Test is scheduled to get underway at The Gabba, Brisbane from Saturday.",Australia beat India by 10 wickets to level series 1-1 in Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

IND vs AUS: Rohit Sharma has had a terrible time with the bat in whites

BRISBANE: It's muggy and overcast here, and there's some chance of showers over the weekend. Luckily, the persistent heavy rain which affected Australia 's training plans this week is expected to abate, and Pat Cummins ' men will be happy they've got a pre-Christmas game at the Gabba this time around.The fresh, early season pitch promises more life and bounce, and though Australia themselves won't be immune to batting collapses if Jasprit Bumrah gets going, the team has a far better record in Tests played in mid-Dec here. Australia have lost the last two Tests at this venue, both of which were played in Jan - to West India in 2023 and India in 2021.""It can be a slightly different pitch earlier in the season,"" curator David Sandurski said here on Wednesday. ""Later on, the pitch might have a bit more wear and tear, while the ones early on in the season usually are a bit fresher and might have a bit more in them. We still prepare the pitch the exact same way every time to try and get the same good carry, pace and bounce that the Gabba is known for. We're just trying to make a traditional Gabba wicket like we do every year,"" he said.Australia, incidentally, have lost just seven of 61 pre-Christmas Tests here, while losing three of five played in Jan. Sandurski insisted the pitch wouldn't be like the one on which South Africa beat the hosts inside two days two years ago, a game played from Dec 17-18. A recent Sheffield Shield contest, played under lights with the pink ball last month from Nov 24-27, saw 15 wickets fall on the opening day, although eventual winners Victoria scored 439 in their second innings.""The aim is to be similar to that Sheffield Shield wicket where there was a good balance between bat and ball,"" Sandurski said. ""Hopefully there's a bit in it for everyone.""On another note, the Gabba's future as a Test venue is uncertain since the stadium is likely to be renovated in time for the Olympic Games in 2032. An early December Ashes Test scheduled for next year may well be the last Test here before work begins to increase the stadium capacity.This means Gabba's days as an iconic Test venue which shapes Australia's cricket summer are numbered.","Australia have a better record in Tests played in mid-December at the Gabba.

Before the season began, advancing to the next stage of the new format seemed inevitable for a side that had won the last four Premier League titles and was the 2023 European champion. However, that is no longer the case as City manager Pep Guardiola struggles with injuries and his players' seeming lack of faith.With goals from Dušan Vlahovic and Weston McKennie causing the most recent loss and igniting Juventus' hopes of qualifying, City has only won one of its last ten games across all competitions.Barcelona 's 3-2 victory over Borussia Dortmund propelled them into second position in the league rankings, behind Liverpool, and ensured their advancement. Ferran Torres and Raphinha each scored two goals for Barcelona.Bukayo Saka 's two goals helped Arsenal defeat Monaco 3-0, putting them in third position and ahead of six other clubs with 13 points.The clubs ranked No. 9-24 enter a two-leg playoff, while the top eight advance straight to the round of 16.The first of City's two remaining Champions League games comes against Paris Saint-Germain, another struggling powerhouse in 25th place, one point outside of the qualifying spots.With a powerful header aimed directly at City goalkeeper Ederson, who was only able to divert the ball over his own line, Vlahovic gave Juventus the lead in the 53rd minute. Juve won thanks to two American substitutes, including McKennie, who volleyed home from a cross from Timothy Weah.Juventus rose to 14th position.Last season's runner-up Dortmund was forced out of the top eight after Ferran Torres came off the bench to lead Barcelona to their fifth victory in six games.Robert Lewandowski, who had a quiet game against his old team, was replaced by Torres in the 71st minute. Torres scored on the rebound of Dani Olmo's shot just four minutes later.The score was tied at 2-2 after Serhou Guirassy's second goal of the match, but Torres scored again in the 85th minute after Lamine Yamal's counterattack.Barcelona took the lead thanks to Raphinha, and Guirassy equalized from the penalty spot. Lewandowski leads the league with seven goals, while Raphinha and Guirassy are tied for second place with six goals each.Saka scored goals in the 34th and 78th minutes and put in a shot that was converted into the net by substitute Kai Havertz in the 88th, giving Arsenal their third consecutive league-stage home victory without giving up.On goal differential, Arsenal leads Bayer Leverkusen, Aston Villa, Inter Milan, Brest, and Lille. On Wednesday, Lille defeated Sturm Graz 3-2 at home.AC Milan defeated Red Star Belgrade 2-1, with Tammy Abraham scoring the game-winning goal in the 87th minute to pull one point out of the top eight. In the first half, Milan lost Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Alvaro Morata to muscular ailments.Feyenoord defeated Sparta Prague 4-2, while Benfica drew 0-0 at home against Bologna to stop their five-game winning streak.","Manchester City fell to 22nd in the 36-team Champions League standings.

IND vs AUS: Rohit Sharma has had a terrible time with the bat in whites

NEW DELHI: The debate over Captain Rohit Sharma 's batting position for the third Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series against Australia in Brisbane has sparked discussions on social media. After missing the Perth Test due to his second child's birth, Rohit opted to bat at No. 6 in Adelaide, allowing KL Rahul to continue opening.However, this strategy proved unsuccessful as Rohit managed only nine runs across both innings in India's 10-wicket defeat.A notable discussion emerged between cricket legends Sunil Gavaskar and Matthew Hayden regarding Rohit and KL Rahul's batting positions for the upcoming Brisbane Test, scheduled for Saturday, with an amusing incident involving Hayden's on-air mistake.In his analysis on Star Sports post-second Test, Gavaskar advocated for Rohit's return to opening, suggesting it could provide India with a strong start. He proposed moving Rahul to No. 6, entrusting him with handling the second new ball.""I think he should come back to opening for the next Test because he likes the ball to come onto the bat. This innings, one can understand, because he hadn't played for a while, and Rahul and Jaiswal had a 200-run partnership in the previous game. But Rahul can come down the order and face the second new ball. I'm being optimistic that India will bat so well in the next game that Rahul will take care of the second new ball,"" he said.Hayden presented a contrasting view, advising against hasty changes despite the Adelaide defeat, supporting the ""technically-sound"" Rahul as opener.However, he mistakenly said "" Rahul Dravid "" instead of ""KL Rahul.""He stated: ""I'll be slightly more stubborn. I will not be changing at this stage. I know you would like a better outcome inside the top three. But from what I saw in Perth, technically, Rahul Dravid is right there. He just needs to do it for a longer.""Gavaskar humorously pointed out the error: ""I would love it if it was Rahul Dravid, as you said, but it is KL Rahul.""Hayden, amidst laughter, apologised and explained that Dravid's Adelaide Oval double century still haunts him.""Sorry, KL Rahul. My apologies. I was thinking of when he dominated here in Adelaide and got us smashed in 2003/04 series. That's a nightmare I'm stull living.""Dravid’s marathon 233 during India’s 2003/04 tour of Australia was a masterclass in grit. Chasing Australia’s 556, powered by Ricky Ponting’s 242, Dravid found stellar support from VVS Laxman.The pair’s record 303-run stand fueled India’s 523-run reply.Dravid’s 446-ball knock featured 23 fours and a six. He followed it with an unbeaten 72 as India chased 230, sealing their first win in Australia since 1981 and only their fourth ever Down Under.","Rohit Sharma will bat at No. 6 in the third Test against Australia in Brisbane.

What I can tell you is Alcaraz defends like Novak, has power and spin like Nadal and has hands and finesse like Federer,"" said Agassi during a talk session in Bengaluru.The eight-time Grand Slam victor Agassi elaborated on why excessive expectations shouldn't burden Alcaraz.""Just because he has the best of all those three doesn't mean he can do what they did because there're so many other parts to the game, which mean decision-making, injuries, you know, luck,"" he said.With Djokovic at 37, approaching retirement, Agassi noted that the Serbian's competitive edge might diminish without Nadal and Federer in the arena.""He's already done so much, so long, and it's hard to imagine longer. I think he'll run out of the energy for it more than the capability of it, I would imagine.""It cannot be easy, especially when the people you came to the dance with have left.""The American provided additional context to his assessment.""When Pete (Sampras) retired, it was a blow to me. It set me back a little bit. It made me have to rediscover my inspirations on some level.""And he's (Djokovic) lost the guys that he's made history with. So, it's probably emotionally going to get tougher and tougher quickly, but I would never bet against him. Bet against him at your own peril,"" said Agassi.Regarding Djokovic's recent appointment of Andy Murray as coach to extend his career, Agassi expressed interest in their partnership's development.""They've been fierce rivals on court, and now Murray will be coaching Djokovic.

Injury forces you to introspect. In 2017, PR Sreejesh had the world at his feet. Then came the injury. ""The next day someone else took my place,"" PR Sreejesh tells us. ""Even in the newspapers, you started to put someone else's picture. Everyone started to forget me. That day I realized, 'Okay, hockey is not your life. Hockey is part of your life'.""Sreejesh is a thinking man's sportsperson. Maybe it is to do with his unique position on the field. A persona forever in disguise - the hockey goalkeeper's elaborate armour and grilled helmet giving him that concealment - and watching the action before him, it probably gave him the most unique spot to think, about the game at hand, and the bigger game of life.The double hockey Olympic bronze medallist, current coach of the junior National team and Director of Hockey, Delhi SG Pipers in the revived Hockey India League, was in TOI's Delhi office for an exclusive interaction that went on and on, and still felt so brief when it ended.Because, in addition, when we found that he may have stowed away his hockey stick, he hadn't left his famous raconteuring skills behind, Sreejesh immediately became delightful company.He saved his best for the last. Posing for photographs at the wall with TOI editions on momentous events, Sreejesh remarked, ""Keep a place for the Olympic hockey gold, when I am the coach...""That was my initial plan. I was thinking like taking a break for one or two years, then take to coaching. But it (coaching the juniors) was the demand of the time. What do you do when you go back home? Get comfortable! Currently, you're still in a routine… wake up in the morning, go for training, set up all the training, analyse the players. It is easy for me to continue now. See, going to an office is more comfortable for us because you know there will be work, but it's not physically demanding. At 4 o'clock, you are done, you're going back home. Last two decades, I was in the same routine, just train, train, train. Now, it's like, okay, chill out... no problem. Now there is no Yo-Yo test. Secondly, it's also the demand of the situation. There was no coach for the juniors. I thought, okay, it is the right time. I spoke with my family; I discussed with them. My wife said, 'Take me with you and then you can go anywhere'. I said, 'Okay, that's a deal'.It's all up to you. How you are setting up your mind. It's not an overnight decision. In your career, you get indications from different areas, and I started to get that in 2016. People will start talking about your age and co-relate it with your performance. When a 35-year-old makes mistakes in comparison with a 20-year-old, people start saying 'Oh Sree is getting older, that's why he is making mistakes.' Then people even in the team start talking. It's not the main factor, but being a player, I wanted to say goodbye from a platform when I was on top of my game. In 2023, we won gold at the Asian Games . After that, I checked it was only nine months for Paris. I said to myself, okay, it's worth trying because that's the greatest platform.Goalkeepers play a different game on the field than other. In an entire game, I may touch the ball for 10 times, but in that I may concede three goals or maybe, I may not touch the ball but concede two goals, which is not even my mistake. The goalkeepers have a mentality of taking the blame on themselves. Even if it's not my mistake, I feel bad that I conceded a goal. That hurts. That's why we say goalkeepers play a mental game on the field. Goalkeepers need to be mature, understand that it's a goal against the team, not you. The other 10 people are making mistakes, that's why the ball reached you. So, don't be harsh on yourself.With the introduction of all these latest software and technology, the opposition teams analyse really well. I tell my defenders be prepared to tackle tough. And then the players become fearless. The idea is not to concede a goal Even goalkeepers are becoming better now.The game grows in different ways. The speed has increased. After the rolling substitution, a player is playing maximum 35-37 minutes. Every player plays 6-9 minutes in a quarter. So, the speed is increasing, the technique is changing and that's why the game looks tougher.Fitness! That's the most important part. In the last two Olympics, we got medals because of higher fitness standards. You should be able to play with the same intensity from the first till the last. When the tempo goes down, you start to concede and that puts you under scoreline pressure. Second, it's the basic skills. If your basics are good, then your performance is higher. Third, it's about modern hockey. It's not about how long you hold the ball, it's about how efficient your passes are.It's a tough question because every team lives in a different era. So, between 2006-2010 or the 90s, the individualistic and skilful players used to be pampered more. It wasn't about the team. It was not about one touch passes, but about skill. How beautifully you are holding the ball; how much you're running with it. Nowadays, if you do that, the opposition is going to kill you. They will not allow you to run with the ball or do all that dribbling. Teams are getting fitter. Dhanraj-bhai (Pillay) used to run like anything. Now we can't do that. The game is getting faster. Physically, players are getting stronger, and the better you can control the game. The equipment has changed, technology has changed.It's not about instinct or data. It's about your willpower. I'll give an example. Birendra Lakra , my roommate, my best friend, has a lower Yo-Yo test result than me. But can anybody dodge him on the field? No one. According to your data, is he eligible to play for the team? No! For cricketers, Yo-Yo result of 18-19 is top notch, but in hockey a score 19 means you are not fit. A 20 or 21 is borderline for us. Data is good for us only to make the players aware.Hockey is not cricket where captains make the decision. In hockey, whichever player has the ball, he's the captain. He makes the decisions. The captain's job basically is to manage the team off the field. A lot of conflicts happen, and they can impact the performance. We may not like each other but still we are playing for the same team, and we need to give our best. The captain's job is to keep the team together.It's a selfish mentality. I don't want the ball getting to me, that's why I make sure the defence is in the right place. On the field, goalkeepers take that role of a coach. You need to guide the team. You need to know when and what to instruct.There was no video recording or no GPS tracker then. People used to do whatever they wanted. But now it's visible, an open book. If something happens, then the coach will show the video in the team meeting, then you'll have to be answerable.The league will give a platform to perform and learn and express. Firstly, I am expecting around 5,000 to 10,000 people for every match in Rourkela. Almost 28 U-21 players are participating in the league. It will be a new experience for them, to play in front of a big crowd.There's a lot of shouting and abuse going on (laughs). In my first experience in 2006, the crowd and the goalpost was really close. We were playing Pakistan in the SAG final in Lanka and I mistakenly thought it was an Indian crowd. All Pakistan supporters, within two minutes, were abusing me. In 15 minutes, I was out, I just didn't know what to do. The same thing can happen with youngsters too, they are developing. Any negative comment can affect their performance. HIL can help them face the crowd. They get a platform where they can sit with and learn from a senior player.We do have a lot of hockey players, but they are not taking the sport seriously. I never chose hockey or thought about pursuing it professionally. I liked playing the game for five years, getting some grades to pass my 10th, 12th and then finishing my degrees in Physical Education. I planned to go to an international school abroad for a job and earn a salary of Rs 2-3 lakh. I never thought I'd reach this stage in my life. Things changed according to my journey.When I started, the first target was getting into a stadium and achieving 60 marks. Later, my teacher said, 'Sree, if you win a medal at the Nationals, you'll get 90 marks. Then the same Sir told me, 'If you play internationally, you get 120 marks.' So, I started working hard to achieve that goal. Then, somebody told me, 'If you keep playing hockey like this, you'll get a good job'. I was like 'Why do I need to study when I can play hockey and get a job'? When I turned 18, I got a banking job. I was told that if I perform well at the international level, I'll get promotions which was a good incentive. Over the years, I performed well, winning medals at the 2014 CWG and Asian Games. Then you started thinking about playing in the Olympics and securing a medal there. That's when you become a real sportsperson and take the game seriously. Now, I have changed my job and joined the state govt's general education department. I am more than happy because even after my career is over, I can be involved with sports.No, that won't happen. Seriously. Vijayan was one of the luckiest people. I know the whole story. What I'm saying is like you need to save your bread and butter first. The game is not your life. It's part of your life. I learned this lesson during my injury. Until 2017, I didn't know that I had a life beyond hockey. I was captain, the best player in the team. The day I got injured, someone else took my place the next day. I realised that hockey is not your life. Hockey is part of your life. You do have a family and people to take care of.Mentally, injury is part of game. You cannot predict it. The only thing that you can do is you can prevent it. You can work on your diet, do strength training or upgrade your fitness level. Before that injury, I never achieved anything. The two big medals (2020 Tokyo and 2024 Paris Olympics) came after that. I would only say I managed that injury period because of my job. It gave me a kind of financial security.Meditation is not really my thing. I have started to read, mainly autobiographies. For me, that's a kind of meditation. I keep a target, like finishing 50 pages or 100 pages in one sitting. That's the time I feel like I am doing meditation.Everything is happening but, at the same time nothing really is happening. An autobiography is on the way. As far as biopics go, an actor which comes to mind (to play me) is Tovino Thomas (Malayalam actor). He looks a lot like me.Yes, I did feel that divide. People judged you on your clothes and shoes. They never looked at your quality of play or why you were part of the team. That happened during the early stages of my career. I had a pair of pads which had a normal string to fasten, not Velcro straps. I would tie the pads with those strings, and people would come and say, 'Look at him'. I had only one basic jersey that time. The rest of them were normal T-shirts. So, people would say, 'Look, it's a sponsored jersey. It's old and torn.' It all mattered that time. A couple of times, I felt like quitting, I'm going back. It would happen in the national camps.Rather than thinking about all that, I was like 'Are you getting training?' 'Yes'. 'Are you getting a place to sleep?' 'Yes'. 'Are you getting food?' 'Oh yes, very good'. What else do you want, so I continued.The basic thing I want my players to do is to enjoy this tournament rather than putting pressure on them to win. It's a learning for all of us because we are playing the HIL for the development of this game and SG Pipers aren't putting any pressure on us. I want to tell my players is to just enjoy the tournament.If you ask me about good qualities, I don't know. But if you ask me what my bad qualities are, I can name 100. I'll give you five - some weak goals, I was sometimes vulnerable to penalty corners, sometimes I overran and other times I yelled a lot. I would also just slide a lot.But when the team needed me, I saved the strokes. I gave the team oxygen, that's why they had me as a goalkeeper. I'll also tell you about one more bad quality of mine. I don't remember my best saves.Yes. I miss them at the Asian level because of the viewership these games used to draw was something that can't be matched. I played several matches against them. It used to be an emotional war on the field. It wasn't just about hockey. It was something else. There's always this media, venue, match, fans and federation pressure. But now all that has changed. Now it's like just another Pakistan team. We beat them 10-2 at the Asian Games last year. Somewhere, I do miss that good quality match against Pakistan.That's a tricky question. I think the Asian Champions Trophy match against Pakistan in 2011 was the most memorable one. It was a thrilling finish. I think that was the first time India recognised my face as a goalkeeper even though I played the 2010 World Cup as well. I think, as an individual, that's something more special than these two matches. But as a player, the last match was different. Equally, the first match had an emotional connection because I spent almost an hour in front of the mirror in the bathroom after receiving my first India jersey. I made me realise that I have become an international player now. In the same way, I spent almost 15-20 minutes sitting atop the goalpost at the Paris Olympics to come to terms with the feeling that this was my last match. It more emotional than my first match.I want to take all these pictures off my wall. My era is done now, so I am just giving space to my kids. And this is what has happened. At home, I hang all my international medals at a special place. When my daughter won her first bronze in kindergarten, she took off my Asian Games medal and hung hers there. When my son got some medals, he also decided to hang it there on the wall removing some of my medals. So, I thought, let's give them this space. But I want to keep some of the pictures from my playing days, like when the team members bowed down before the goalpost with me standing in the front. And the top of the goalpost one.","PR Sreejesh is a double hockey Olympic bronze medallist.

India's over dependence on Jasprit Bumrah visible in Adelaide

NEW DELHI: Matthew Hayden , the former Australian opener, has suggested that Indian bowlers should focus on targeting the 'fourth, fifth stump line' while utilising the natural bounce at the Gabba pitch during the third Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy , commencing Saturday in Brisbane.Following Australia's decisive victory in the Adelaide pink-ball Test, the five-match series stands level at 1-1, with India having secured a 295-run win in the Perth opener.Hayden offered his insights on strategies to dismiss Australian batters at the Gabba.""India, when they do get a chance to bowl, they need to rely on hovering in that fourth, fifth stump line a bit more. And most importantly, they need to use their bounce,"" Hayden told Star Sports.""It's a key arsenal as part of a fast bowling unit in Brisbane. The red ball will definitely be more familiar in terms of Test match cricket. Australia have the running with the pink ball, they won so much with it.""The 53-year-old former opener emphasised the importance of Indian batters showing resilience in testing conditions.""India must bat better, they must bat for time. They must bat a day of Test match cricket. Under a day, unacceptable. Has to be in that 350 zone. India should bat first even if there are challenging conditions,"" Hayden said.""Brisbane, different ball game! It's a home game, but it's actually a very good game for India as well because they've got memories of the last time they encountered Australia in the BGT.""The Indian team's historic three-wicket victory at the Gabba in 2021, which secured a remarkable 2-1 series triumph, remains a significant memory for Indian cricket supporters.","Former Australian opener Matthew Hayden suggests Indian bowlers should focus on targeting the 'fourth, fifth stump line' during the third Test of the Border- Gavaskar Trophy.

IND vs AUS: Rohit Sharma has had a terrible time with the bat in whites

MELBOURNE: As Australia prepare for the third Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against India, David Warner has emphasised the crucial need for substantial runs from the top order, considering the persistent Indian bowling attack's effectiveness when working in tandem.The third Test commences on December 14 at the Brisbane Cricket Ground. After a decisive 295-run loss to India at Perth's Optus Stadium, where Jasprit Bumrah, KL Rahul, Virat Kohli, and Yashasvi Jaiswal excelled, the hosts bounced back impressively.Brilliant bowling from Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins, complemented by Travis Head 's aggressive century, secured Australia a comprehensive 10-wicket victory while pursuing a modest 19-run target.In his media interaction on Wednesday, Warner, as quoted by Wide World of Sports, called for improved batting performances to reduce pressure on the bowling unit.""I think the pressure is on all of the top order, not just Uzzie (Usman Khawaja). Travis came out and counterpunched with a brilliant hundred--we know he's capable of that--but it's about everyone else around him providing support,"" Warner remarked.""It's not just one player in particular; it's the top six scoring bulk runs and giving the fast bowlers a break. The first game was high-paced, but in the last one, we saw Mitchell Starc at his best with the pink ball. Come Brisbane, we need to see some big runs from the top order.""""This Indian bowling attack is relentless when they bowl in partnerships. If they maintain the intensity we saw with Bumrah the other day, the boys will need to dig deep and put big runs on the board,"" he added.Warner's observations are supported by statistics. Notable batters have underperformed this series: Khawaja (308 runs, avg. 25.66), Smith (232 runs, avg. 23.20), Labuschagne (309 runs, avg. 28.09), Marsh (272 runs, avg. 24.72), and Carey (317 runs, avg. 31.70).Travis Head stands out with 438 runs at 39.81, including two centuries. Despite fewer substantial scores, Head appears the most consistent amongst Australia's top-order batters.Warner praised Nathan McSweeney 's composure as an opener under testing conditions.""He's faced four of the five toughest challenges for an opening batsman and handled them well. The intent he showed the other day was promising. While there were questions about his selection, his performance shows why he was chosen. He has a good temperament and setup, and I think he has a bright future ahead,"" said Warner.McSweeney recovered from scores of 0 and 10 in Perth to register a solid 39 in Adelaide, forming a fifty partnership with Labuschagne, before an unbeaten 10 in the second innings.",Australia beat India by 10 wickets in the second Test in Adelaide.

The hero of the hour was Tashinga Musekiwa, who coolly navigated the pressure of the final over to score the crucial 11 runs needed for Zimbabwe to cross the finish line with just six wickets down.The foundation of Zimbabwe's successful chase was solidly built on a 75-run partnership between Brian Bennett and Dion Myers.

How can India still qualify for World Test Championship final?

NEW DELHI: India suffered an 83-run defeat against Australia in the third Women's ODI at Perth on Wednesday, despite opener Smriti Mandhana 's brilliant century, resulting in a 0-3 series whitewash.After winning the toss and choosing to field, India had Australia struggling at 78 for four. However, Annabel Sutherland 's outstanding 110 from 95 balls, along with significant contributions from Ashleigh Gardner (50) and captain Tahlia McGrath (56 not out), helped Australia post 298 for six in their 50 overs at WACA.India's response ended at 215 in 45.1 overs.Chasing 299, Mandhana's elegant 105 off 109 balls kept India's hopes alive. Her innings, which included 14 boundaries and a six, demonstrated excellent technique and timing.The Indian innings struggled due to lack of support for Mandhana after Alana King broke the 118-run partnership between her and Harleen Deol (39 off 64 balls).Gardner proved decisive with both bat and ball, claiming five wickets for 30 runs. Notable batting failures includedRicha Ghosh (2), Harmanpreet Kaur (12), Jemimah Rodrigues (16), and Deepti Sharma (0).Earlier, Australia recovered from Arundhati Reddy 's exceptional bowling spell to post a challenging total. Reddy achieved career-best figures in limited-overs cricket with four crucial wickets.The match began with Phoebe Litchfield (25) and Georgia Voll (26) building a solid opening partnership. Reddy's breakthrough over changed the momentum, dismissing both openers and subsequently removing Elysse Perry and Beth Mooney, reducing Australia to 78 for four.Sutherland and Gardner's 96-run partnership showcased Australia's batting depth. Sutherland particularly dominated the spinners, including a notable over against Deepti.She reached her century with a six off Deepti in the final over, whilst India's fielding showed room for improvement with three dropped catches.",India suffered an 83-run defeat against Australia in the third Women's ODI at Perth.

Is India's batting now over dependent on Yashasvi Jaiswal?

NEW DELHI: The Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy quarter-final witnessed a fiery moment as former Delhi player Nitish Rana , now playing for Uttar Pradesh , and Delhi skipper Ayush Badoni were involved in a heated exchange on the field in Bengaluru on Wednesday.The verbal confrontation escalated during the match, drawing attention from players and umpires alike. Both cricketers, known for their competitive spirit, seemed unwilling to back down, adding drama to the high-stakes encounter.Notably, Rana has a history of verbal duels with statemates, including an altercation with Mumbai Indians' Hrithik Shokeen during IPL 2023 . The incident occurred at the Wankhede Stadium when Shokeen, a fellow Delhi cricketer, dismissed then KKR skipper Rana cheaply during the match. As Rana walked back to the dugout, Shokeen exchanged words, prompting the KKR captain to stop and turn around, responding angrily.After being acquired for Rs 4.20 crore at the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 mega auction in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, Rana has moved from Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) to Rajasthan Royals (RR).Although Rana had delivered steady performances for the defending IPL champions KKR since 2018 and played a vital role in their achievements, the team opted neither to retain him nor bid for him actively during the auction proceedings.While Lucknow Super Giants retained rising star Badoni for Rs 4 crore, as an uncapped player, ahead of the auction.","Nitish Rana and Ayush Badoni involved in a heated exchange on the field in Bengaluru on Wednesday.

However, the outcomes seem predetermined as neither bid faces competition.The 2030 World Cup holds special significance as it marks the centenary of the inaugural tournament held in Uruguay in 1930. To commemorate this milestone, Uruguay will host one match, alongside Argentina and Paraguay.The unique arrangement involves three different continental confederations, creating an unprecedented hosting scenario.FIFA confirmed over a year ago that the Morocco, Spain, and Portugal bid was the sole contender for 2030. Other potential bids had withdrawn.A joint British and Irish bid was abandoned to focus on hosting Euro 2028. There were also unconfirmed suggestions of a joint bid from South Korea, China, Japan, and North Korea.Four South American countries initially launched a joint bid in 2019. They believed the centenary World Cup should be held entirely on the same continent as the first tournament.In late 2022, UEFA promoted a joint bid involving Spain, Portugal, and war-torn Ukraine. This was seen as a gesture of “solidarity” following the Russian invasion.Ukraine was subsequently removed from the candidacy. Morocco joined the Iberian nations, and South America agreed to host three symbolic matches in exchange.Following the “centenary celebrations” in the Southern Hemisphere winter, the participating teams and their fans will travel across the Atlantic for the remaining 101 matches.This extensive tournament will conclude with the final on July 21st. The venue for the final match is yet to be determined.Spain, which hosted the 1982 World Cup, is expected to play a central role, offering 11 of the proposed 20 stadiums.Morocco, having unsuccessfully bid five times previously, will become the second African nation to host the World Cup, following South Africa in 2010.Potential final venues include Madrid’s Santiago Bernabeu, Barcelona’s renovated Camp Nou, and the planned Hassan II stadium. The Hassan II stadium, located between Casablanca and Rabat, is projected to be the ""biggest stadium in the world"" with a capacity of 115,000.Portugal, which hosted Euro 2004, will contribute two stadiums in Lisbon and one in Porto, hoping to host a semi-final.Regarding the 2034 World Cup, FIFA invoked its continental rotation principle, welcoming bids only from Asia or Oceania. The 2026 World Cup, expanded to 48 teams, will be hosted across North America.FIFA gave potential bidders a short timeframe to submit candidacies, causing controversy. Australia and Indonesia quickly withdrew their interest.This left Saudi Arabia as the sole candidate. This paves the way for the World Cup to return to the Gulf region after Qatar hosted in 2022.Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been utilizing sport to enhance the nation's global image and influence.Securing the 2034 World Cup would be a significant achievement for Saudi Arabia. Currently, they possess only two stadiums with a capacity of 40,000, while 14 are required.Besides the logistical challenges, the extreme summer temperatures might necessitate rescheduling the tournament to later in the year, similar to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. The timing of Ramadan in December 2034 presents an additional complication.The awarding of the World Cup to Saudi Arabia is expected to reignite discussions surrounding human rights, as seen with Qatar in 2022.Rights groups have raised concerns about mass executions, allegations of torture, restrictions on women under the male guardianship system, and limitations on free expression in Saudi Arabia.Saudi Arabia, currently hosting high-profile events like Formula One and the WTA Finals, faces accusations of ""sportswashing.""
