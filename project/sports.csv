'Sarfaraz Khan's waistline...': How Sunil Gavaskar wants cricketers to be assessed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/new-zealand-in-india/sarfaraz-khans-waistline-how-sunil-gavaskar-wants-cricketers-to-be-assessed/articleshow/114422794.cms,"Sarfaraz Khan hit 150 against New Zealand in Bengaluru.

NEW DELHI: Sarfaraz Khan 's attacking 150 in the most recent first Test match against New Zealand was praised by legendary Indian batsman Sunil Gavaskar , who also said that his batting performances were even more impressive than his waistline.Following his duck in the first innings, which saw India bowled out for 46, Sarfaraz led India to 462 in the second innings with an explosive 150, his first Test century, that included 18 fours and three sixes.His daring and unconventional smashes, particularly through the square area at the off-side, delighted cricket fans at M Chinnaswamy Stadium.""Sarfaraz Khan has been denied a place in the Indian team for some years now, despite scoring runs by the hundreds in domestic cricket. This was largely because those in a position to make decisions believed he didn't have the slim waist they deemed necessary for international cricket. Sarfaraz's returns on the field with the bat were even more prodigious than his waistline. Sadly, Indian cricket has had too many decision-makers with ideas that are hard to fathom,"" wrote Gavaskar in his column for Sportstar on Monday.Gavaskar also gave the example of wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant , who, despite not having a particularly trim waist, excelled in Test cricket, making a brilliant 99 in Bengaluru and sharing a vital 177-run partnership with Sarfaraz in the second innings.""Rishabh Pant is another player who doesn't possess the slim waist that these fitness purists seem to want, but what an impact player he is. Let's not forget that he also keeps wickets all day, which not only requires getting up and down for around six hours of play but also running to the stumps to gather the throws.""""So, please discard these yoyo-yoyo tests and instead assess how strong a player is mentally. That will be a true indicator of a player's fitness. If a player can bat the whole day or bowl 20 overs in a day, he is match-fit, regardless of how slim or not his waist is.""Gavaskar questioned whether India's eight-wicket loss in Bengaluru could cause them to worry ahead of a crucial trip to Australia later this year given Rohit Sharma 's team's inability to handle bounce.""That their heroics went in vain, as the batters who followed them simply didn't have the technique or temperament to deal with a pitch that was different from the low-bounce ones where they dominate, only added to the frustration.""If anything, the way the Indian batting has struggled in Chennai - where again there was some bounce - and now in Bengaluru, does make one anxious about what lies in store in Australia.""Even the flattest of pitches there have more bounce than the usual Indian surfaces. That said, the Kookaburra ball should be an ally of the batters, as once a dozen overs or so have passed, the seam movement is almost negligible and batting becomes a lot easier,"" he concluded.",Sarfaraz Khan hit 150 in India's first Test against New Zealand in Bengaluru. Sunil Gavaskar said that Khan's batting performances were even more impressive than his waistline. The former India batsman also gave the example of wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114422780,imgsize-39932,width-400,resizemode-4/114422780.jpg"

We expected the pitch to be a little flatter than what it turned out to be. So clearly a misjudgment of the pitch. I am hurting a little bit because I made that call,” Rohit had said.With the defeat in Bengaluru Test , India also conceded crucial percentage points in the World Test Championship standings However, with eight wins and three defeats in 12 matches, Rohit and Co. still remain top of the table.The second India vs New Zealand Test starts on October 24 in Pune.","India collapsed to their lowest team total — 46 all out — at home.

Rohit Sharma revealed that as a precautionary measure, Pant was not behind the stumps on the final day despite batting in India's second innings during his dazzling knock of 99.""He has had a massive operation. We must be a little careful about where he is at and what he is to us. Even when he was batting, he was not comfortably running and was trying to only put the ball in the stands. When you are keeping, you need to bend every ball with your knee going down. And the wicket being what it was, we thought it was the right thing to do for him to stay inside and get 100% ready for the next one.""On handling Pant with care, the skipper stated, ""With someone like him, we just need to be extra careful.

And that is the kind of freedom we want to give to him because he has produced performances with that mindset. I don't think there is anything that you need to speak to him about.

INDIA NEED A FAST-BOWLING ALLROUNDER

NEW DELHI: Several things went wrong for Team India in the opening Test of the three-match series against New Zealand. First, captain Rohit Sharma misjudged the Bengaluru pitch, resulting in India being bowled out for mere 46 -- their lowest total at home. Second, the Indian bowlers struggled as New Zealand's batters dominated, building a massive 356-run lead.Lastly, apart from Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli Rishabh Pant , and young Sarfaraz Khan, India's batting collapsed again in the second innings, losing seven wickets for just 54 runs.Now trailing the three-match series 0-1, India may re-consider their playing XI as they head into the second Test, starting Thursday at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium in Pune. KL Rahul , whose form has been under scrutiny, particularly after his disappointing scores of 0 and 12 in the first Test, might be at risk of losing his spot. After the defeat in the first Test, allrounder Washington Sundar was added to the squad.However, former India bowler Venkatpathy Raju believes Rohit should stick with the same eleven, including the ""experienced"" KL Rahul, despite his recent struggles.""I don't think we should tinker with the playing XI. If I were the captain, I would go with the same side. You need experienced hands in your team. You can't bench KL Rahul after just one Test match. He is an experienced batter and should play the next Test. There's no need to panic. India are still on top of the WTC standings. Rohit is a positive captain. He goes in with a positive approach, and he knows that what's done is done, and now it's time to level the series. I’m sure he will,"" Raju told TimesofIndia.com.In his last five innings, KL Rahul has failed to make a significant impact, with only one fifty in India's recent series against Bangladesh. Earlier this year, he scored a half-century against England and a century in South Africa, but his inconsistency has sparked doubts about his place in the squad. His performance in Bengaluru has only added to the speculation surrounding his future in the Test team.""India already have three spinners who played the Bengaluru Test. Washington will only be included if there is an injury. On the basis of one match, we shouldn’t panic. Conditions were different in Bengaluru. No one knew how the pitch would behave. It happens. Weather is not in our hands. We’ve played good cricket, and that 46 all-out should be left behind. It’s in the past, and the past should be buried. We should learn and move on. Rohit’s focus should be on the next two Tests, and I’m confident India will bounce back and win the series,"" he said.""India should think about those five Tests in Australia and not panic. Let’s play KL Rahul in the second Test and give him a chance. He’ll bounce back. He has experience. India just need to pull up their socks. That’s it,"" Raju added.India have two experienced spin allrounders, Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja, but Raju feels they need a fast-bowling allrounder in their setup as well.Raju expressed surprise that Rohit chose to go with only two fast bowlers — Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj — in the Bengaluru Test.""India are missing a fast-bowling allrounder. A fast-bowling allrounder plays a huge role in the team. We have spin allrounders like Ashwin, Jadeja, and Washington, but not a single fast-bowling allrounder. I was surprised India picked only two fast bowlers for the Bengaluru Test,"" Raju said. Hardik Pandya is there, but is he willing to play red-ball cricket? Is he ready for Tests? I don’t think he wants to. If he’s available, it’s a huge plus for the team. A fast-bowling allrounder eases the captain's burden. You get an extra fast bowler and a batter at the same time,"" he added.","India's batting collapsed again in the second innings, losing seven wickets for just 54 runs.

NEW DELHI: Indian captain Rohit Sharma found himself in the spotlight after a cheeky comment aimed at a New Zealand batter was caught on the stump mic during India’s defeat in the first Test in Bengaluru.The viral moment occurred when Rohit was heard telling Ravichandran Ashwin , ""Lefty ko out karna hai yaar mereko. Zyada hero ban raha hai woh (I want to dismiss the left-handed batter.He is trying to be oversmart).""Watch:The comment appeared to target New Zealand’s Rachin Ravindra , who played a pivotal role in the match.Ravindra, who recently made headlines with a stunning 134 against India in the first innings, frustrated the Indian bowlers during the chase in the second innings and guided New Zealand to their first Test win on Indian soil in 36 years.New Zealand chased down 107 runs on the final day to register a remarkable eight-wicket victory at the Chinnaswamy Stadium.The win marked New Zealand’s first Test victory in India since 1988, when John Wright’s side had defeated the hosts by 136 runs at Mumbai’s Wankhede Stadium.After rain and a wet outfield delayed play by an hour on the last day, India’s bowlers—led by Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj—put New Zealand’s batters under early pressure. Bumrah dismissed Tom Latham for a six-ball duck and later trapped Devon Conway for 17, leaving New Zealand at 35/2.However, Rachin Ravindra (39 not out) and Will Young (48 not out ) steadied the innings with a crucial partnership to see their team home inside 28 overs.The calm partnership ensured that India’s hopes of a comeback slipped away as New Zealand clinched a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.Despite the loss, India displayed resilience after being bowled out for just 46 in the first innings.With the second Test starting on October 24 in Pune, Rohit Sharma and coach Gautam Gambhir face tough selection decisions—especially with Sarfaraz Khan scoring 150 in Bengaluru and Shubman Gill likely to return from injury.",New Zealand beat India by eight wickets in the first Test in Bengaluru.

Jets' struggles continue despite Adams' reunion



The New York Jets ' season continues to spiral downward after their fourth consecutive loss, leaving fans with little to be optimistic about as their playoff chances slip away. With each passing week, the team’s hopes grow dimmer, as their overall performance fails to meet expectations.Also Read: ""I’m kind of hurt"": Bill Belichick defends Patriots players against Jerod Mayo's 'Soft' criticism with passionate response Sunday night’s game against the Pittsburgh Steelers saw the Jets falling short once again in a 37-15 defeat.Although the first half seemed promising for the team, things quickly took a turn in the second half. A string of missteps by the Jets’ offense—including a punt, an interception, and a blocked field goal on their first three offensive drives in the third quarter—opened the door for Pittsburgh to take control. Russell Wilson and the Steelers capitalized on these errors, leading two touchdown drives and securing a field goal, leaving the Jets trailing and unable to recover.Davante Adams , the newly acquired Jets wide receiver, expressed his disappointment over the team’s failure to capitalize on opportunities. It was stated by Adams that the team ""just didn't execute in the opportunities or in the moments"" where they could have turned things around.""Just didn't execute in the opportunities or in the moments that we had to potentially put the ball in the end zone or finish a drive or get three, whatever it was,"" Adams told reporters after the loss. ""We just didn’t execute, didn't finish. That's been the underlying thing with this team this year.""Despite being reunited with his former quarterback Aaron Rodgers , Adams has yet to make the impact he hoped for on the scoreboard. During the game, Adams recorded just three catches for 30 yards, sharing a team-high of nine targets with Breece Hall and Garrett Wilson. While his chemistry with Rodgers remains evident, as shown in their prior seasons together, it hasn’t translated into significant production yet. However, his first touchdown as a Jet seems imminent, as he continues to adjust after his departure from Las Vegas last week.The larger issue, however, lies beyond individual performance. With a 2-5 record, the Jets face a daunting challenge to reach the postseason. Despite Adams’ potential contributions, the team’s collective flaws cast a shadow over their remaining season. The postseason has eluded the Jets for more than a decade, and while fans and players alike are desperate to break that streak, the odds appear stacked against them. As the losses pile up, it becomes increasingly clear that the Jets will need more than individual brilliance to overcome their long-standing playoff drought.Also Read: Tua Tagovailoa fires back at retirement rumors with short and blunt statement after concussion scare","The New York Jets lost 37-15 to the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday night.

There would be no dearth of the desire to win in the two teams taking field at Kalinga Stadium in Bhubaneswar on Tuesday. While hosts Odisha FC have managed just one win to take into the international break and sit on 10th spot on the Indian Super League table, visiting East Bengal FC are still on the lookout for their first point to take them out of the bottom of the 13-team table.However, the fans at the home turf are sure to anticipate a firework duel between these two eastern outfits — as has been the case earlier — and an end-to-end battle that pushes each team to put their best efforts forward to walk away with three points.Sergio Lobera and his men are finally discovering their mojo this campaign and this fixture might give them their best opportunity to go all the way, given their seven-game-long unbeaten streak against East Bengal in ISL, in which they have struck 23 goals.“Odisha FC need to get the best performance possible from the entire squad,” Odisha head coach Sergio Lobera said at the pre-match press conference on Monday.“We need to manage the squad well.

We need to manage the timings and substitutions well and this is our job as the coaches to get the best performance possible not only from the players who are starting the match, but also the ones who are coming from the bench.”While the coach’s tactics will be crucial, the hosts will depend on the likes ofDiego Mauricio and Hugo Boumous to fire as Lobera looks to move upwards on the table. It will be the same kind of expectation at the other end from their yet-to-fire stars like Dimitrios Diamantakos and newest recruit, Frenchman Madih Talal .One-match-old East Bengal coach Oscar Bruzon pointed at specific facets of the gameplan in which his team needs to uplift their performance and stressed on the importance of a win in raising the team’s confidence.“East Bengal need a positive result,” the Spaniard said on Monday. “We need to understand where to shape, the offensive triggers, to be more intense, to win duels, win second balls, to go big on the defensive transitions and to have fewer spaces in between our lines.

Vita Vea's Injury Scare: More of a Caution Than Worry



Why Vea's Return is of Utmost Importance to Tampa Bay?



Bucs Fans Breathe Easier



What's Next for the Bucs?



As the Tampa Bay Buccaneers prepared to face the Baltimore Ravens on Monday Night Football, an injury report heading into MNF worked in favor of Bucs fans. Defensive tackle Vita Vea , who was listed on the final injury report after a hamstring issue, reportedly should be alright for the Week 7 tussle against Lamar Jackson 's dynamic offense.Also read - Hailee Steinfeld's Christmas Gift Sparks ‘Official Girlfriend’ Status While Josh Allen’s Ex Leaves Fans Guessing Tampa Bay's star defensive tackle Vita Vea did a disappearing act on this past Saturday's injury report, and it wasn't an auspicious one.Sidelined all week by what the Bucs described as a hamstring issue, Vea's lack of participation in practice raised red flags about his availability for the big game. According to reports, it was mainly precautionary that Tampa Bay kept him out. Maybe the injury isn't that serious.As of now, the big man is expected to suit up for the game, much to the relief of Tampa Bay fans. The Buccaneers are hoping that Vea’s presence on the defensive line will help them neutralize the Ravens’ potent ground attack, led by dual-threat quarterback Lamar Jackson.Vea can't be overestimated when it comes to his importance to the Buccaneers' defense. He is a clogger in running lanes, disrupting the opponent's offense deep in the trenches, and those efforts have been big for Tampa Bay's defensive success this season. Having on the field a dominating force such as Vea should be critical to slow down Baltimore's run-heavy offense, with Lamar Jackson always a danger on the snaps.Baltimore's running game, one of the very best in the NFL, will also create some problems for Tampa if they cannot stop Jackson and his stable of backs. Vea gives the Bucs the size, strength, and agility that they needed to be the difference-maker stopping the run; his return will give Tampa Bay a fighting chance of keeping the Ravens' offense in check.For a tested crew this season, everything comes down to healthy roster presence: Vita Vea participating in the lineup could make all the difference for Week 7. While that initial check of the injury report had Tampa Bay fans panicking, news that Vea likely plays really gives the team what it needs before its primetime game. The Buccaneers' offense is bright-eyed and bushy-tailed this season, but it's going to be their defense which needs to step up if they're to keep Lamar Jackson and the Ravens' offense at bay.Watch for how Vea impacts the defense of Tampa Bay, particularly concerning shutting down the run. If he plays, it should totally change everything for the Ravens' offense and make them pass more, which, although possible, is not nearly as dangerous as their running game.Tampa Bay enters this critical game seeking its defense-mostly once again, with Vea-in this regard-to make a pristine performance against the running feast known as Baltimore's offense, who feed on whittling away the opposition's dead by the poundage of their running game. Indeed, Lamar Jackson continues to lead the charge on offense; however, the return of Vita Vea may well be the key that unlocks the door to victory for Tampa Bay.That is, the Buccaneers need to stay healthy and keep making crucial stops if they are going to make a deep playoff run this season. Monday night's game could be a defining moment for their season, and on that field, Vita Vea gives them so much better chances to go out there and get some wins.Also read - Hailee Steinfeld's Christmas Gift Sparks ‘Official Girlfriend’ Status While Josh Allen’s Ex Leaves Fans Guessing","Tampa Bay Buccaneers star defensive tackle Vita Vea was listed on the final injury report after a hamstring issue.

Last season in the Ranji Trophy, he scored 451 runs in six matches@50.11, with one hundred and one fifty.A dashing opener when in full flow, Shaw made a sensational start to his Test career, scoring a hundred on debut against West Indies at Rajkot in 2018. However, he found himself out of the Indian team after playing five Tests (339 runs@42.37, one hundred and two fifties), six ODIs (189 runs@31.50) and One T20I for India. The Mumbaikar has scored 4556 runs in 58 First-Class matches@46.02, with 13 hundreds and 18 fifties. In January 2023, he shot back into the limelight, smashing 379 off 383 balls-the second-highest score in the history of the Ranji Trophy.However, the knock failed to help him stage a comeback into the Indian team.Shaw's place in the squad has been taken by 29-year-old opener Akhil Herwadkar, who has been recalled after he left Mumbai to play for Chhatisgarh a few years back.Meanwhile, India's T20 captain Suryakumar Yadav will miss the game due to his ""family commitments,"" as a reliable source put it.The squad: Ajinkya Rahane (Captain), Ayush Mhatre, Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Akhil Herwadkar, Shreyas Iyer, Siddhessh Lad, Suryansh Shedge, Hardik Tamore (WK),Sidhaant Addhatrao (WK), Shams Mulani, Karsh Kothari, Himanshu Singh, Shardul Thakur, Mohit Avasthi, Mohd.

NEW DELHI: Star Indian batter Sanju Samson recently opened up on his relationship with captain Rohit Sharma and what happened after he had been dropped from the playing XI in the last T20 World Cup final.Speaking on journalist Vimal Kumar’s YouTube channel, Samson revealed that he was initially set to play in the final against South Africa in Barbados but was dropped at the last moment as the team decided to retain the same lineup.""I had a chance to play the final. I was told to stay ready, and I was ready. But just before the toss, they decided to stick with the same XI. During warm-ups, Rohit took me aside to explain the decision. He asked, 'You understood, na?'"" Samson shared. ""I told him, 'Let’s focus on winning the match first; we can talk later.'""Samson recalled Rohit returning shortly after, sensing Samson's disappointment. ""He said, 'I know you’re cursing me in your mind.' I told him that as a player, I wanted to play. It had been my dream to perform in moments like these. Rohit explained his pattern and the reasons behind the decision. I told him I respected his explanation, but I will always carry a regret—that I missed playing a World Cup final under a leader like him,"" Samson added.Samson admitted that the 10-minute conversation before the toss left a lasting impact, noting, ""I thought, in such a high-pressure moment like a World Cup final, the captain would usually focus on the game or the players who are playing. But Rohit took 10 minutes to explain his decision to me before the toss, and then he went for the toss. That gesture won him a place in my heart forever.""While Samson has often found himself on the fringes of the national team, he was part of India’s squad that won the 2024 T20 World Cup.However, he didn’t get a chance to play in any of the eight matches, with Rishabh Pant being preferred as the first-choice wicket-keeper batter.The tournament also marked Pant’s comeback to international cricket after his car accident, with the left-handed slogger slotting in at number three throughout the campaign.Despite missing out during the World Cup, Samson made a resounding in the recent T20I series against Bangladesh. In the second T20I, he hammered a stunning 111 off just 47 balls, leading India to a record-breaking total of 297/6— the highest-ever T20I score by a full-member ICC nation.His blistering knock, featuring 11 fours and eight sixes, was the second-fastest T20I century by an Indian, achieved in just 40 balls.",Sanju Samson opened up on his relationship with captain Rohit Sharma.

NEW DELHI: New Zealand batter Kane Williamson has been officially ruled out of the second Test against India, which starts on October 24 in Pune.Williamson is still recovering from a groin strain sustained during New Zealand’s recent series against Sri Lanka.Head coach Gary Stead confirmed the decision, stating that while Williamson’s recovery is progressing, he isn't yet fit enough for the physical demands of Test cricket .""Kane is moving in the right direction, but he’s not at 100% fitness yet,"" Stead explained. ""We’re hopeful that he’ll show further improvement and be available for the third Test.""The New Zealand team is taking a cautious approach with Williamson’s recovery, ensuring he gets the time needed to regain full fitness. “We’ll give him as much time as possible to get himself ready, but certainly continue to take a cautious approach,” Stead added.Williamson’s absence is a setback for the Kiwis, who are now leading 1-0 in the three-match series after a thrilling first Test win in Bengaluru.The New Zealand camp remains optimistic about Williamson’s availability for the third Test, with the team management closely monitoring his recovery.Meanwhile, New Zealand made history in the first Test by securing their first victory on Indian soil in 36 years.They chased down 107 runs on the final day, defeating India by eight wickets.

PUNE: A Test match loss at home is a rarity in Indian cricket. The defeat in the first Test to the Kiwis will have an impact on how the Indian team management goes about its task ahead of the second Test in Pune starting on Thursday.""India won't be bogged down after their defeat in Bengaluru despite getting all out for 46,"" said former India opener and former women's team coach WV Raman. ""This team has shown that it can bounce back quickly. They will continue to play aggressive cricket.""A change in the playing XI will be almost forced for the second Test. Not just because India are trailing and the Gahunje pitch is likely to be different than Bengaluru's, but also due to the Shubman Gill factor. The 25-year-old top-order batter is expected to be fit and available for the Test. And if India are to continue with the five batters, 'keeper and five specialist bowlers' combination, the axe will have to fall on KL Rahul after Sarfaraz Khan 's belligerent 150.""It's a good headache to have,"" said Raman. ""A young man (Sarfaraz) doing well at the start of his international career is always a good sign."" Though Raman said that India should look at ""one thing at a time"" (implying winning this Test and levelling the series), he also added that if India are looking at Rahul as a crucial member on the tour to Australia, he should be given some game time. ""He is a capable batter, who needs to get his form and confidence back.""This was always going to be a bilateral series with multiple layers. India need to keep an eye on the World Test Championship (WTC) table and Australia series. And they must manage the workload of Rishabh Pant and Jasprit Bumrah.Skipper Rohit Sharma has already hinted at the need to be extra careful with Pant, who did not keep wickets in the first Test but contributed a vital 99 with the bat. Will the management risk him in Pune?India adding Washington Sundar - a left-handed batter and off-spinner - to the squad has added to the intrigue. But he gets a look-in only at the expense of either offie R Ashwin or left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav, especially if both Pant and Rahul are not in the XI.Sundar (152 and 6/88 in both innings against Delhi in the Ranji Trophy) will boost the middle order and add flexibility. And we have not discussed left-arm finger spinner Axar Patel yet.Raman said, ""I look at Sundar as a batting allrounder. One way to play him is by asking him to open the innings."" But resting Yashasvi Jaiswal at this juncture may not make any sense.Giving Akash Deep a go in place of below-par Mohammed Siraj may look like a desperate act. But it has long-term gains considering the question mark over Mohammed Shami's availability for the tour Down Under. If Akash Deep is going to play as a third pacer in Australia, he would need game time too.The Bengaluru defeat means Bumrah cannot be rested now to give both Siraj and Akash game time together. Pant's 99 came after taking injections.While India wait for Rishabh Pant to recover from the knee injury, TOI has learnt that the wicketkeeper had taken injections on his knee to bat in the second innings of the Bengaluru Test.However, BCCI's medical team is confident he will be ready to keep wickets in the second Test in Pune starting Thursday.""He was in some pain after getting hit on the right knee during New Zealand's first innings. He was given injections. The limp while running between the wickets came from numbness in the affected region. He just has a bruise now and should be fit in a day or two,"" a BCCI source told TOI.",Rishabh Pant is expected to be fit and available for the second Test in Pune. Dhruv Jurel will replace KL Rahul in the playing XI if Pant is rested.

PUNE: After Pune was awarded a Test match against New Zealand , a recce team from the BCCI came calling to check the facilities at the Gahunje stadium .""Keep the grass on the pitch,"" was one of the instructions. Now, after the defeat in the first Test in Bengaluru, the tone of the message has slightly changed - ensure that the pitch will help spinners too.With no Mohammed Shami and a struggling Mohammed Siraj in the ranks, India are not in a position to beat NZ with only pace, unless Bumrah comes up with magical spells.And if the wicket is too spin friendly, it can backfire too.The authorities are understandably tight-lipped about the instructions coming from the Indian camp and no one was willing to speak on record about it. It is learnt that the BCCI curator has taken the charge of the pitch. Local curators are loath to share much information on the nature of the track.The stakeholders are aware that the nature of the pitch cannot be changed dramatically in a short time.

We could have easily been bowled out cheaply but proud of the effort. Everyone is on the edge of the seat when those two bat. Rishabh left a few balls and then played shots. Sarfaraz showed great maturity as well.""The Indian captain complimented the Kiwis for bowling well in the first innings saying, ""I said in my press conference that we knew it will be sticky early on but we didn't expect to be out for 46. New Zealand bowled well and we failed to respond to that.""Looking ahead to the second Test in Pune that starts from October 24, Rohit said, ""Games like these happen. We will move forward.

How much did India women earn at T20 World Cup?

Members of the New Zealand women's cricket team, which beat South Africa by 32 runs in the final of the Women's Twenty20 World Cup in Dubai on Sunday, will split prize money of around US$2.3 million (Rs 19 crore) for clinching the tournament. The $2.3 million prize money is a 134 percent increase from the 2023 edition. Runners-up South Africa pocketed $1.17 million (Rs 9.8 crore) for their run to the title showdown.That works out at around US$155,000 (Rs 1.3 crore) per team member, a huge windfall for players who for years have struggled for years to achieve financial parity with their male counterparts.New Zealand's first-ever victory in the T20 World Cup was a massive surprise. The White Ferns had lost 10 consecutive T20 matches coming into the World Cup.Their pre-tournament success, against South Africa, proved a turning point for New Zealand who beat India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan, losing only to Australia on the way to the semifinals.South Africa sent packing six-time champions Australia in a massive upset in the semi in which New Zealand beat the West Indies.The overall prize money pool of $7.95 million (about Rs 66.5 crore) was an increase of 225 percent from the previous edition. From the pool, the two semi-finalists - Australia and the West Indies - took home $675,000 (Rs 5.7 crore) each.Meanwhile, teams that finished ranked fifth to eighth, which essentially means the three best teams in the group stage, will earn $270,000 (Rs 2.25 crore) each.India, who were sent packing from the group stage, fall in this category. Harmanpreet Kaur-led India couldn't progress from Group A after two wins (against Pakistan and Sri Lanka) and two losses (against New Zealand and Australia).In the final, New Zealand made 158/5, batting first, helped by Suzie Bates who made 32, Amelia Kerr who made 43 and Brooke Halliday who made 38. Kerr then took 3/24 and Rosemary Mair 3/25 as New Zealand restricted South Africa to 126-9.""Pretty unbelievable to be honest,"" Mair said. ""Coming into the tournament all the odds were against us so for the group to bounce back like they have is unbelievable.""We just care so much about each other. We've been through a lot of lows in the last 18 months, and we've just stuck by each other and kept working hard for each other.""Captain Sophie Devine was leading the New Zealand team for the last time. She and Bates have played in all nine T20 World Cups since the inaugural edition in 2009. New Zealand reached the final of the first two tournaments - in 2009 and 2010 - losing to Australia on both occasions.""This means everything to us,"" Bates said. ""When you play team sport, you want to be a world champion.""We've fought our way back to the top. (Devie) has been so outstanding leading this team... so calm and believing in us. We'll probably have a cuddle for even longer later because there's been some dark times that only the people in the (locker room) understand.""The White Ferns' success was praised by the country's Sports Minister Chris Bishop. It came on a weekend where New Zealand won sailing's America's Cup and the men's cricket team beat India in a Test in India for the first time in 36 years.""And then to round out a truly amazing sporting weekend, at 3am Monday morning (NZT) the White Ferns, led by Sophie Devine, stepped up to face South Africa in the women's T20 World Cup final in Dubai and absolutely smashed it, bringing home their first World Cup since the One Day International in 2000,"" Bishop said.""Amelia Kerr's 43 runs off 38 balls and then taking 3 wickets for 24 set our team up for their magnificent performance.""",New Zealand beat South Africa by 32 runs in Women's T20 World Cup final.

Brief scores:

There were two mindsets on the field at Barabati Stadium in Cuttack on Monday.Having lost out on a crucial first-innings lead, Jammu & Kashmir were desperate to return home with a positive result from their second Ranji Trophy Group A match this season. But hosts Odisha , who have already registered three points from their first essay, were just fighting for a draw on Day 4 of the fixture.And at the end of the final day, it was the hosts who held fort and deprived the visitors of an outright win as J&K fell short by two wickets to garner any point and settled for a draw.The result meant that Odisha — having had to settle for a shared point with Tripura after a washout in their domestic season opener — climbed to the sixth spot on the eight-team list while J&K had to be content with a place on the second half of the Group A table on fifth.Resuming the day on 198/5, the visiting J&K were keen to put up a big score and at a fast pace to eke out an improbable victory on the final day. Aided by Sahil Lotra at the other end, their fighter-in-chief in both innings, Abdul Samad , raced to his second century of the match.Samad added 38 runs to his overnight score of 70 in a hurry and stayed unbeaten on 108 as the visitors looked eager to go all out for a win declaring on their identical first-innings score of 270, but for seven wickets. It took Samad and his lower-order companions 24.2 overs to add 75 runs and set Odisha a target of 272 to clinch all the points. Suryakant Pradhan was the most successful of the Odisha bowlers with three dismissals for 46 runs.However, already in the second session of the final day, Odisha were in no mood to go all out and played a defensive innings as the visiting bowlers put in a cumulative effort to dismiss them and win the match in less than two sessions.Just the stats for Sandeep Pattnaik , Odisha’s highest scorer in the second innings, made evident their strategy as he stayed unbetaen on 55, playing 222 balls. It was the same for all eight Odisha batters — with skipper Govinda Poddar amassing the highest strike rate of 27.27 for his nine runs.Four J&K bowlers claimed a wicket each as Odisha stood firm on 112/8 when stumps were called in their Ranji Trophy fixture.J&K 270 & 270/7 decl (A Samad 108 n.o., S Lotra 28; Pradhan 3-46).

NEW DELHI: New Zealand Cricket ( NZC ) faced backlash from Indian fans after posting a map of India on social media that depicted inaccurate borders of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh regions.The map was part of a creative announcement detailing the Kiwis' travel plans to Pune for the second Test against India, scheduled to begin on October 24.The now-deleted post drew heavy criticism across platforms, with many fans expressing anger over the incorrect depiction of India’s northern borders.Several users took to X (formerly Twitter) to demand corrections, with one fan tagging India’s External Affairs Minister, Dr. S. Jaishankar, and calling for action. ""Please look at this map, posted by New Zealand Cricket handle. They are showing the wrong map of India,"" the fan wrote.Another user commented, ""We can't imagine how you could post an incorrect map. Please correct this.""A different fan added, ""Do not post an incorrect map of India's northern border.""Following the uproar, NZC promptly deleted the post, but the controversy continued to brew online.The controversy follows New Zealand’s memorable eight-wicket win over India in the first Test at Bengaluru. The victory was New Zealand's first Test win on Indian soil since 1988.Rachin Ravindra, who was a standout performer in the match, anchored the chase with 39 not out, alongside Will Young’s unbeaten 48.India’s bowlers had briefly raised hopes on the final day after dismissing Tom Latham for a duck and trapping Devon Conway for 17, but the 75-run stand between Ravindra and Young sealed the game for the Kiwis.With the second Test starting in Pune on October 24, India will look to bounce back.","New Zealand Cricket posted a map of India on social media that depicted inaccurate borders of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh regions.

NEW DELHI: South Africa's Kagiso Rabada etched his name in the record books on Monday, becoming the fastest bowler to reach 300 Test wickets in terms of balls bowled, during the first Test against Bangladesh in Dhaka.This achievement led to a dominant performance by the Proteas, who bowled out Bangladesh for a paltry 106 before building a 34-run lead by the end of day one.Rabada reached the milestone in the 41st over of Bangladesh's innings, dismissing Taskin Ahmed to finish with figures of 3/34. This feat, achieved in just 11,817 deliveries, sees him surpass bowling legends like Waqar Younis (12,602), Dale Steyn (12,605), Allan Donald (13,672), and Malcolm Marshall (13,728).Despite the personal accomplishment, Rabada remained focused on the team's objective.""I was more focused on how we were going to win this Test, especially after losing the toss and bowling first. But when it happened, it was just a relief. Everyone plays for milestones, but it was a relief. The way my teammates support me, we support each other, and that felt really good,"" Rabada said after the end of play on the first day.Rabada also shared his observations on the Dhaka pitch, noting the unexpected seam movement despite initial expectations of turn.""We thought it was going to turn, and not really nip, but with the new ball, there was a bit of movement. Not really much swing, but off the wicket, there was quite a bit of seam movement,"" he added.Bangladesh, opting to bat first after winning the toss, struggled to build partnerships and were undone by a disciplined South African bowling attack. Opener Mahmudul Hasan Joy top-scored with a patient 30 runs, but the rest of the batting lineup crumbled under pressure.Wiaan Mulder and Keshav Maharaj complemented Rabada's three-wicket haul by picking up three wickets each, while Dane Piedt chipped in with one wicket.The Proteas' bowlers consistently challenged the Bangladeshi batsmen, exploiting the conditions effectively.South Africa's reply got off to a shaky start, losing skipper Aiden Markram early. However, a composed 30 from Tony de Zorzi and contributions from Ryan Rickelton (27) and Tristan Stubbs (23) steered them to 140/4 at stumps.Taijul Islam provided Bangladesh with a glimmer of hope, claiming a remarkable five-wicket haul, including the wickets of de Zorzi, Rickelton, and Stubbs. Hasan Mahmud also contributed with one wicket.As day two dawns, South Africa will aim to build on their lead and put the match beyond Bangladesh's reach.

It was mainly due to overnight or morning rains that left the outfield wet and the ground unfit for play.Even the toss could not take place. Although Bihar will be happy with one point after suffering an innings defeat against Haryana in the last match, Bengal must be ruing the missed chance of gathering maximum points against a relatively weak opposition.In a long tournament like the Ranji Trophy, teams always look to take the ‘home’ advantage but sadly Bengal failed miserably in that ground.In a nice gesture, the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) officials travelled to Kalyani to felicitate Abhimanyu Easwaran for his 100th first-class match, but they could have done better to ensure that the match actually happened.It seemed no one took good notice of the weather forecast and was thus caught completely off-guard when rain lashed the city.

Khalid Jamil may be a man of few words but evidently not a man of few feats. And on Monday, at JRD Tata Sports Complex in Jamshedpur, his men took another leap of success as Jamshedpur FC overtook Mohun Bgan Super Giant on the Indian Super League (ISL) table with a 2-1 win against Hyderabad FC .The win — scripted with first-half strikes from Rei Tachikawa and Jordan Murray — took the Men of Steel to the second spot on the table, banishing the Kolkata giants to third place with 12 points from five matches and staying just a point behind current leaders Bengaluru FC Hyderabad, meanwhile, could not climb out of the penultimate position with just one point from four games.The southern visitors’ desire to rise from their 12th spot on the table was evident from the beginning as Lenny Rodriguez, Ramhlunchhunga and Abdul Rabeeh all had shots on target in the opening 25 minutes.However, the deadlock was broken a little against the run of play in the 29th minute when Jamshedpur winger Sanan Mohammad sent a cross from the left of the box that reached Imran Khan at the other end of the box. But the midfielder’s shot was saved by Hyderabad custodian Arshdeep Singh before the rebound reached the feet of an onrushing Tachikawa, who ran in with the ball for his second goal of the season, continuing his goalscoring touch against the same opponents.The goal seemed to have raised the home side’s confidence as they went on the lookout for more. While Arshdeep was able to save an optimistic shot from Tachikawa in the 34th minute, he was not able to repeat the feat 10 minutes later.This time, too, it was Sanan who was the provider as he sent a through to Murray after a good transition and a pass from Tachikawa. The Australian was exquisite in his finish as he chipped the ball with his right feet over the reach of the onrushing Arshdeep.Hyderabad were more determined for a comeback after the change of ends as they produced some exciting moves that didn’t take long to attain the desired result. However, it was as much the miscommunication between the Jamshedpur backline as was the presence of mind of Cy Goddard that earned them the goal.The miscommunication led defender Pratik Chaudhari to duck the ensuing header in the box from a throw-in on a verbal call from Albino Gomes and Japanese Goddard made no mistake to sneak into the goalmouth medley and send it past the goalkeeper.The goal raised hopes in the Thangboi Sinto-coached side for an equaliser even as Jamshedpur began to get their act together after the shock of conceding. And, in the end, it was Jamil’s men who came out on top and made a statement and a place for themselves among the title contenders this season.","Jamshedpur FC overtook Mohun Bgan Super Giant on the Indian Super League (ISL) table with a 2-1 win against Hyderabad FC.

NEW DELHI: Brazilian superstar Neymar Jr marked his return to professional football after a year-long absence due to injury, featuring in Al-Hilal 's dramatic 5-4 victory over Al-Ain in the Asian Champions League group stage on Monday.The high-scoring encounter at the Hazza bin Zayed Stadium saw Al-Hilal establish a commanding 5-3 lead by the 77th minute, fueled by Salem Al-Dawsari's hat-trick and goals from Sergej Milinkovic-Savic and Renan Lodi .It was at this point that Neymar replaced the injured Nasser Al-Dawsari, marking his first appearance since suffering a cruciate ligament injury during a World Cup qualifier with Brazil in November 2022.Despite the lengthy layoff, Neymar displayed glimpses of his trademark flair and nearly found the back of the net late in the game, only to be denied after a swift counter-attack.Al-Ain, led by Soufiane Rahimi's own hat-trick, mounted a late comeback, converting a penalty in stoppage time to reduce the deficit to a single goal. Al-Hilal, however, weathered the storm in a tense period of added time to secure the victory and maintain their position atop the West Asian group standings.This win further solidifies Al-Hilal's dominance, as they also currently lead the Saudi Pro League with a comfortable 21 points.Understandably emotional after the final whistle, Neymar expressed relief and satisfaction with his return, stating, ""I feel good, it's so hard. I always have a good team. But I'm so happy. I'm back.""Neymar's return is a significant boost for Al-Hilal, who acquired the Brazilian forward from Paris Saint-Germain for a reported €90 million in August 2022.Prior to his injury, Neymar had only featured in five games for the Saudi Arabian club, grappling with persistent muscle issues.His return injects a much-needed dose of star power and attacking prowess into Al-Hilal's lineup as they aim to conquer both domestic and continental competitions.",Al-Hilal beat Al-Ain 5-4 in the Asian Champions League on Monday.

Kolkata: Mohammedan Sporting faced some home truth again as Kerala Blasters rode a second-half fightback to beat the Indian Super League debutants 2-1 at the Kishore Bharati Stadium on Sunday.The hosts went ahead in the 28th minute when Brazilian Carlos Franca earned a penalty and his Uzbekistani teammate Mirjalol Kasimov converted it much to the joy of the partisan crowd.But Kerala Blasters stormed back into the contest through goals from Kwame Peprah (67) and Jesus Jimenez (75).This was the first victory in three consecutive matches on the road for Mikael Stahre ’s Blasters, who had earlier drawn their clashes with NorthEast United FC and Odisha FC.Mohammedan SC , on the other hand, remain winless at home, their latest setback coming after a 0-3 mauling at the hands of Mohun Bagan SG two weeks ago. Their defensive frailties came to the fore again as they lost another plot after taking the lead. Andrey Chernyshov ’s side suffered an early jolt when Ghanaian defender Joseph Adjei had to leave the ground with a serious leg injury, thus paving the way for new recruit Frenchman Florent Ogier to make his debut in the black-and-white colours.The hosts, however, took the lead deservedly when Franca latched on to a brilliant ball from his half and fell under the challenge of Blasters custodian Som Kumar, leading to the penalty. Kasimov sent the goalkeeper the wrong way from the spot.Blasters announced their intention of a comeback when they finished the first half with Jimenez hitting the crosspiece.Franca missed a golden chance to extend the lead on the hour mark when he went for glory himself instead of sending the ball to an unmarked Fanai at the other end. Thus reprieved, Blasters came calling, Adrian Luna whipping in a long cross and Noah Sadaoui — who was a constant threat to the hosts’ box from the left — sent it back across the six-yard box for Peprah to make it 1-1, two minutes after replacing fellow defender Alexandre Coeff.Sadaoui then missed a sitter, failing to beat Mohammedan SC goalkeeper Padam Chhetri from a one-on-one situation.

They could make the most of the break time on offer, and on Monday, Jamshedpur FC and Hyderabad FC will retake the field in the last fixture of the fifth round of Indian Super League with a sense of optimism reigning at both ends.It will be another opportunity for Jamshedpur to continue their best ISL start in front of the home crowd at JRD Tata Sports Complex . With nine points from four matches, the Khalid Jamil-led side has surpassed their preceding league campaign so far and the Indian head coach backed his team to maximise the familiar conditions at home.“It is a very important game for us.We are playing in front of our home crowd. They’re a good team. They’re stronger than before. We must prepare well and take a positive result from this match,” Jamil said in the pre-match press conference on Sunday.Jamil’s stress on “a positive result” is guided by the fact that — currently lying in third spot — a win against Hyderabad on Monday would take the Men of Steel above Mohun Bagan Super Giant and a point behind leaders Bengaluru FC on the second position.With Jamshedpur’s creator-in-chief Imran Khan leading the charts among Indian players producing most goal-scoring chances, the likes of Jordan Murray and Javier Siverio are expected to be provided with ample scope to convert upfront. Jamil will also have the dependable Stephen Eze in backline to lead their defence.However, the hosts will take on a Hyderabad side — led by the only other Indian coach in the league Thangboi Singto — that secured a clean sheet in their last match against Chennaiyin FC , breaking a run of five games where they conceded at least two goals. They will be eager to build on it and achieve back-to-back clean sheets for the first time since March 2023.However, their attack — with the likes of youngster Devendra Murgaonkar — will need to step up as they remain winless this season.“The players have become stronger as a group, in terms of respect and camaraderie. Football is a team sport. If they can relate that respect on the pitch, then the results will speak for themselves,” head coach Singto said on Sunday.But an in-form Jamshedpur will be in their way with the aim of continuing their run this season, rejuvenated by a much-needed break. “It is good for everybody. They recovered. Everyone went for a break for a few days and then came back. The players who were not fit are fit now. So we are ready,” added Jamil ahead of their return to action at the Furnace.","Jamshedpur FC and Hyderabad FC will meet in the fifth round of the Indian Super League on Monday. The hosts are currently third in the table, a point behind leaders Bengaluru FC. Hyderabad are yet to win a game in the league this season and remain winless.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114411165,imgsize-78186,width-400,resizemode-4/114411165.jpg"

He has 14 goals in 11 matches in all competitions this season.Lewandowski, who received a standing ovation when he was substituted in the 65th, nearly got his hat track against Sevilla in a one-on-one situation in the first half.Pedri scored with a curling shot from outside the area in the 28th and Torre added to the lead from inside the area in the 82nd and with a free kick in the 88th.

The derby was interrupted for more than 15 minutes after fans threw the objects near Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois in a game that ended 1-1.Sunday's victory, which ended Atletico's three match winless streak in all competitions, moved Diego Simeone's team to third place in the league.

Rothe — who played a key role in Kiel earning promotion last season — made sure of the win when he headed in Union's second goal at a corner in the 85th.The win lifts Union to fifth in the Bundesliga, three points off leader Bayern Munich. Union recorded back-to-back wins in the league for the first time since February.Union stunned German soccer by finishing fourth in the Bundesliga to qualify for the Champions League in 2023 but last season was a failure. Union was winless on its Champions League debut and finished 15th in the Bundesliga.Promoted Kiel is in the relegation zone and is the only team yet to earn a point at home this season in the Bundesliga after losing its fourth home game in a row.Also Sunday, Werder Bremen recovered from 1-0 down to beat Wolfsburg 4-2 and rise to eighth.Tiago Tomas gave Wolfsburg the lead with his heel as the ball ricocheted around a packed penalty area, but Mitchell Weiser's volley deep into first-half added time got Bremen back into the game. Second-half goals from Bremen's Felix Agu, Marvin Ducksch and Marco Grüll secured the win.Wolfsburg coach Ralph Hasenhüttl will also have to do without attacking midfielder Patrick Wimmer, who faces a suspension after being sent off for a desperate lunging tackle on Grüll.Wolfsburg is 13th and has scored the opening goal in each of its last four Bundesliga games but won only one of them. It also has only one point in its four home games.Marseille got back to winning ways in style with a 5-0 thumping of Montpellier on Sunday to move within three points of Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain.A fast start to the season had raised hopes of Marseille challenging for a first title since 2010 under Roberto De Zerbi before they dropped off with a defeat by Strasbourg and draw with Angers.But OM were at their best at bottom club Montpellier, cutting the gap to PSG and Monaco who are separated by goal difference at the top of the table.Marseille will have the chance to draw level on points with PSG when they host their rivals next Sunday.""We know who we are, what our path is and what we still need to improve to reach their (PSG's) level. But we will prepare to win, like in every match,"" said De Zerbi, who took over at the Stade Velodrome in the close season after leaving Premier League club Brighton.The visitors got off to a flying start in Montpellier, as Elye Wahi nodded home Jonathan Rowe's header across goal in the first minute.Amine Harit added a second in the 36th minute, before Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg effectively wrapped up the points before half-time.Mason Greenwood collected Wahi's through ball and drove forward before picking out the bottom corner to score his first goal since August.Luis Henrique completed the scoring with 17 minutes left after Montpellier youngster Stefan Dzodic had been sent off.Montpellier sacked coach Michel Der Zakarian just a few minutes after the final whistle, with the team only on four points after eight matches.""He is no longer the coach of the first team.

In the first set, she showed her all-round skills to wrest the early advantage after one hour and 13 minutes of action. The Mumbai girl, who rallied from 1-3 down, taking the next three games, was consistent with her groundstrokes, landing winners from the baseline.
