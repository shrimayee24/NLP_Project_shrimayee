Anthony Edwards’ confident exchange with Barack Obama during Team USA event made headlines



Minnesota Timberwolves star Anthony Edwards has made a name for himself as one of the most promising young players in the NBA. The way the rising standout star has been playing his game led many to draw comparisons between Edwards and the legendary Michael Jordan . However, the 23-year-old guard has made it clear that he is not interested in being measured against the greatest player of all time.During All-Star Weekend, Anthony Edwards was asked about adding any of Michael Jordan ’s signature moves into his own game. Ant-Man did not hesitate to refute the comparison. “No moves, man. Shout out to MJ, he the GOAT. I just wish y’all would stop comparing me to him,” he said. Of course, Edwards appreciates the respect that comes with the comparison, but he seems to feel that it adds unnecessary pressure.Edwards has consistently shown that he wants to be recognized for his own unique style of play rather than living in the shadow of NBA legends.This isn’t the first time Edwards has downplayed his place in the sport. Despite being widely regarded as one of the NBA’s next big superstars, he doesn’t see himself as the future face of the league. When recently asked if he envisions himself as the league’s next top player, especially with legends like LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Stephen Curry nearing the end of their careers, his response was refreshingly candid, “No, not really.” Instead, Edwards pointed to San Antonio Spurs rookie sensation Victor Wembanyama, saying, “That’s what they got Wemby for.”He elaborated further in an interview with TNT, “I’m capable of being that guy. But I don’t want to be that guy, I’ll put it like that. I want to be the guy that just show up and hoop and just kill dudes and go home.”Edwards' confidence isn’t just limited to his performances on the court. Recently, he made headlines for his bold exchange with former U.S. President Barack Obama during Netflix’s Court of Gold docuseries, which provided a behind-the-scenes look at Team USA’s preparations for the Paris Olympics.In one interesting moment, Obama jokingly asked Philadelphia 76ers star Joel Embiid about Edwards, saying, “What do you think about this young guy? He can hoop a little bit, huh?” Embiid, with a smile, responded, “Just a little bit.” But Edwards, never one to back down, immediately responded with his usual candid manner, “Nah, y’all better stand down. I’m the truth.”Also Read: Jimmy Butler addresses beef with Miami Heat after blockbuster trade to Golden State Warriors: “It didn’t end the way everybody hoped” The 23-year-old Minnesota Timberwolves star player has been one of the best in the league with astonishing stats already added to his name.

’ status for the’ upcoming game against the Charlotte Hornets remains uncertain as he is listed as questionable due to a foot injury. The Lakers, holding a 32-20 record, are set to face the struggling Hornets (13-39) at Crypto.com Arena on Wednesday, February 19, at 10:00 PM ET. James’ potential absence could significantly impact the Lakers’ performance, as he continues to be a cornerstone of the team’s success. LeBron James , averaging 24.4 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 8.6 assists over the last 20 games, is not only the Los Angeles Lakers’ leading scorer but also their top rebounder and playmaker. His ability to dominate both ends of the floor has been crucial for Los Angeles, which ranks 14th in the league with 113.3 points per game. Without him, the team’s offensive rhythm and defensive presence could take a hit, especially against a Hornets squad that, despite their poor record, has shown resilience in certain areas.The Lakers’ injury report also includes Maxi Kleber, who is out with a foot injury. Kleber’s absence further depletes the team’s depth, putting additional pressure on role players like Austin Reaves and Rui Hachimura to step up. Reaves, averaging 20.2 points and 6.9 assists in the last 20 games, has been a reliable secondary option, but the Lakers’ chances of securing a win would undoubtedly be higher with LeBron James on the court.On the Hornets’ side, LaMelo Ball is listed as probable with an ankle injury, providing a glimmer of hope for Charlotte. Ball, averaging 27.3 points per game, is the Hornets’ leading scorer and a key facilitator. His presence could pose challenges for the Los Angeles Lakers’ defense, particularly if LeBron James is sidelined. However, the Hornets are dealing with their own injury woes, including season-ending absences for Grant Williams, Brandon Miller, and Tre Mann.The game will be broadcast on SportsNet LA and FDSSE, with live streaming available on Fubo. Fans can also engage with the action through FanDuel Fantasy, adding an extra layer of excitement to the matchup.Also read: Why are the Los Angeles Lakers and Charlotte Hornets playing today?

Carson Wentz's Journey: From MVP Contender to Sideline Supporter

The Foles-Wentz Dynamic: A Tale of Two Quarterbacks

Reflecting on 'What Could Have Been'

In a candid reflection, Carson Wentz has expressed a heartfelt desire to have been the one leading the Philadelphia Eagles to their historic 2018 Super Bowl victory . In a recent interview, Wentz admitted, ""I would love to trade places with Nick Foles and win that Super Bowl back in the day.""During the 2017 NFL season, Carson Wentz was on an MVP trajectory, steering the Eagles to an impressive 11-2 record. However, a devastating ACL injury in Week 14 abruptly ended his season. This setback paved the way for backup quarterback Nick Foles to step in. Foles not only filled the void but led the team through the playoffs, culminating in a stunning 41-33 victory over the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LII.Wentz's absence during this pinnacle moment was emotionally challenging. Reports from 2022 suggest that he ""voiced his displeasure with the Eagles' success"" to fellow injured teammates during the Super Bowl run. This sentiment led to a confrontation, highlighting the internal struggle Wentz faced watching his team achieve glory without him.Despite the emotional turmoil, Carson Wentz has consistently maintained respect and camaraderie towards Foles. Their relationship, though tested by circumstances, remained professional. Foles, after leading the Eagles to their first Super Bowl win, handled his return to a backup role with grace, emphasizing the team's success over individual accolades.The 2018 season saw Carson Wentz's return to the field, but lingering injuries and the shadow of the previous season's success created a complex environment. Foles once again stepped in towards the season's end, leading the Eagles to the playoffs, though they fell short of another Super Bowl appearance.Carson Wentz's recent admission sheds light on the personal and professional challenges athletes face when sidelined during critical moments. His longing to have been the one to secure the championship for Philadelphia underscores the weight of expectations and the unpredictability of sports careers.As Carson Wentz continues his journey in the NFL, his reflections serve as a testament to resilience and the complex emotions inherent in professional sports.Also read - Jason Kelce Hints That Taylor Swift Is Changing Travis Kelce—""He Was Like Peter Pan"" Before","Carson Wentz has expressed a heartfelt desire to have been the one leading the Philadelphia Eagles to their historic 2018 Super Bowl victory.

Team India undergoes intense training in Dubai ahead of Champions Trophy | Exclusive Visuals

India begin Champions Trophy prep | Rishabh Pant struck on knee

India's probable XI vs Bangladesh:

Hot favourites India will begin their Champions Trophy campaign against Bangladesh in Group A on Thursday, and with just four teams in each group of the eight-team competition, every game matters in the quest to finish in the top two to qualify for the semifinals.Besides Bangladesh, India's other competitors in the group are hosts and defending champions Pakistan as well as New Zealand.India, who will play all their matches in Dubai, have the advantage of playing the entire tournament at just one venue and the players won't have to adjust to different pitches, unlike the other seven teams who will play across four venues -- Lahore, Karachi and Rawalpindi in Pakistan as well as Dubai.But the first match remains tricky. Despite knowing the historical nature of the Dubai track to have something in it for both batters and bowlers, India will have to take a call on whether to go in with three spinners or three pacers from their spin-heavy 15-member squad.India suffered a blow just before the tournament, with ace fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah ruled out because of a back injury. And with Mohammed Shami only recently returning to the team after a year-long injury layoff and Arshdeep Singh short on ODI experience, India coach Gautam Gambhir and captain Rohit Sharma have work to do in order to pick the bowling combination they want to go ahead with.India have as many as five spinners in the squad; namely Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakravarthy, and all-rounders Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel and Washington Sundar. While the pace-bowling unit has Harshit Rana and all-rounder Hardik Pandya besides Shami and Arshdeep.The dew expected late in the evening in Dubai is one factor that may prevent India from picking three spinners as it makes it difficult to grip the dewy ball. But with Axar being used at No. 5 against England and doing well, his inclusion can give India the balance they seek with a left-handed batting option in the mix in top five.However, the batting order looks sorted as the likes of Rohit, Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul pick themselves, unless the think-tank wants Rishabh Pant to do the wicketkeeping duties instead of Rahul, who did the job during the three-match ODI series against England just before the Champions Trophy.Rohit Sharma (c), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, KL Rahul (wk), Ravindra Jadeja, Mohammed Shami, Kuldeep Yadav, Arshdeep Singh","India begin their Champions Trophy campaign against Bangladesh in Group A on Thursday.

Jayson Tatum’s impact on the Boston Celtics squad

Theare gearing up for a crucial matchup against the Philadelphia 76ers on Thursday, February 20, at the Wells Fargo Center. While the Celtics have been dominant this season, sitting at 39-16, all eyes are on their star forward,, as the team navigates its injury report. Jayson Tatum , the Boston Celtics’ leading scorer and one of the NBA’s most dynamic players, is not listed on the injury report for Thursday’s game. This is a significant relief for Boston fans, as Tatum has been instrumental in the team’s success this season.

Over the last 20 games, Tatum has posted impressive numbers, including 25.2 points, 7.6 rebounds, and 5.6 assists per game.The Celtics’ injury report features only one player: Xavier Tillman, who is out with a knee injury.

Key players like Tyrese Maxey and Kelly Oubre Jr. will need to step up in the absence of Jared McCain (out for the season with a meniscus injury), Eric Gordon (wrist), Kyle Lowry (hip), and Justin Edwards (ankle).Tatum’s availability is crucial for the Celtics as they look to maintain their momentum. His ability to stretch the floor with his three-point shooting—he averages 3.6 made threes per game, fifth-best in the NBA—adds a layer of versatility to Boston’s offense. Additionally, his leadership and clutch performances have been pivotal in close games.The Boston Celtics enter the game with a +499 scoring differential, the best in the league, and rank sixth in points per game (117.2). Their defense, allowing just 108.1 points per contest, is equally formidable. With Tatum healthy and in form, Boston remains a strong favorite against a struggling 76ers squad.Also read: Will Joel Embiid play tonight against the Boston Celtics?

NEW DELHI: New Zealand stormed to the top of Group A in the ICC Champions Trophy after a commanding 60-run victory over Pakistan in the tournament opener on Wednesday. The Kiwis' strong start was powered by sensational centuries from Tom Latham and Will Young, setting the tone for their campaign.The National Stadium in Karachi witnessed a historic moment as Pakistan hosted its first major ICC event in nearly three decades. However, the home side failed to deliver, leaving the 29,300-strong crowd disappointed as they fell short in their chase of 321.Despite notable contributions from Khushdil Shah (69 off 49 balls) and Babar Azam (64 off 90 balls), Pakistan could only muster 260 in 47.2 overs.New Zealand, batting first, recovered from an early setback to post an imposing 320-5.

When and where to watch the Charlotte Hornets play tonight (February 20, 2025)?

Theface an uphill battle as they prepare to take on the Denver Nuggets on Thursday, February 20, at Ball Arena. With a dismal 14-39 record, the Hornets are already grappling with a challenging season, and their injury woes have only added to their struggles. Star point guard, who leads the team with 27.3 points per game, is notably absent from the injury report, but the Hornets will still be without key players, including Grant Williams, Brandon Miller, Tre Mann, and Josh Okogie. LaMelo Ball will be playing tonight against the Nuggets. The Charlotte Hornets’ injury report reveals significant setbacks. Grant Williams is out for the season with an ACL injury, while Brandon Miller (wrist) and Tre Mann (back) are also sidelined indefinitely. Josh Okogie remains out with a hamstring issue, further depleting Charlotte’s roster. Despite these absences, LaMelo Ball’s availability provides a glimmer of hope for the Hornets, who have been outscored by an average of 5.4 points per game this season.Ball’s performance has been a bright spot in an otherwise dim season. Over the last 20 games, he has averaged 13.4 points, 4.1 assists, and 2.0 three-pointers per game. His ability to create plays and knock down shots from beyond the arc will be crucial against a Nuggets team that ranks third in the league in scoring, averaging 121.5 points per game.The Nuggets, sitting at 36-19, have their own injury concerns but remain a formidable opponent. Michael Porter Jr. (hamstring), Aaron Gordon (calf), and Jamal Murray (knee) are all listed as probable, while DaRon Holmes, Vlatko Cancar, and Peyton Watson are out. Denver’s depth and star power, led by Nikola Jokic, who averages 29.8 points and 12.6 rebounds per game, make them heavy favorites in this matchup.For the Hornets, the game represents another tough test in a season filled with challenges. With key players sidelined, the team will rely heavily on Ball and Miles Bridges, who has been a consistent contributor with 20.5 points and 7.3 rebounds per game over the last 20 contests.Also read: Victor Wembanyama sidelined indefinitely with crucial shoulder injury, San Antonio Spurs' season takes a hit Tip-off is set for 9:00 PM ET at Ball Arena, and fans can catch the action on ALT, KTVD, and FDSSE or stream it live on Fubo.

Mohammad Amir Exclusive: Champions Trophy hopes, India's absence & retirement talk

NEW DELHI: In-form Shubman Gill etched his name into the record books with a composed, unbeaten 101 as India began their ICC Champions Trophy campaign with a six-wicket victory over Bangladesh on Thursday. Gill’s knock anchored India’s chase of a tricky 229-run target on a challenging surface, with the team reaching the finish line with 21 balls to spare.The 25-year-old vice-captain continued his sublime form, securing his eighth ODI hundred in just 51 innings — making him the fastest Indian to reach the milestone. He surpassed the previous record held by Shikhar Dhawan , who took 57 innings, while Virat Kohli (68 innings), Gautam Gambhir (98 innings), and Sachin Tendulkar (111 innings) followed in the list.""Definitely one of my most satisfying innings that I have played and my first century in ICC events,"" Gill said after receiving the Man of the Match award. ""Very happy with the way I performed.""India's captain Rohit Sharma lauded Gill's efforts, emphasising the young opener's consistency and class. ""Gill, we know the class that he has, shouldn't surprise anyone.

In 51 matches, he has amassed 2,688 runs at an astounding average of 62.51, striking at 100.78. Alongside his eight centuries, he has registered 15 half-centuries, further cementing his reputation as one of India's most promising batters.Interestingly, Gill's century against Bangladesh was his slowest in ODIs, taking 125 balls to reach the three-figure mark. However, his measured innings proved vital in navigating India to victory on a testing pitch.Having recently won the Player of the Series award in India's 3-0 sweep against England, where he scored 259 runs, Gill's red-hot form bodes well for India as they continue their pursuit of Champions Trophy glory.","Shubman Gill scores unbeaten 101 as India beat Bangladesh by six wickets.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Bobby Portis Banned 25 Games Amid Milwaukee Bucks' Playoff Push



Impact on the Milwaukee Bucks



Despite the setback, Portis remains focused.



The Milwaukee Bucks just got hit with a major setback. Forward Bobby Portis has been suspended 25 games without pay after testing positive for Tramadol, a banned substance under the NBA/NBPA Anti-Drug Program. The announcement came Thursday, leaving the Bucks scrambling as they push for a strong playoff position. Portis, known for his high-energy play and physical presence, has been a key piece of Milwaukee’s rotation. His absence will force the team to adjust quickly, with just a handful of regular-season games left before the postseason. Bobby Portis expressed deep regret over the situation, taking full responsibility for his actions.""I feel horrible and take full responsibility,"" he said. ""I sincerely apologize to the Bucks organization, my teammates, coaches, family, and fans. I give everything I have on the court and will miss playing during this time.""His agent, Mark Bartelstein, defended him, claiming the violation resulted from an unfortunate mix-up.""Bobby unintentionally took Tramadol, thinking it was Toradol,"" Bartelstein explained. ""Toradol is an approved pain medication he has used before. The Tramadol pill came from an assistant with a valid prescription, who mistakenly told Bobby it was Toradol. This was an honest mistake.""Despite the explanation, the NBA enforced its strict anti-drug policy. Bucks GM Jon Horst acknowledged the difficult situation but stood by Portis.“This is tough for Bobby and the team,” Horst said. “He and the Bucks respect the NBA/NBPA Anti-Drug Program and will accept the decision. But we fully support Bobby—he’s an integral part of this team and our community.”The Milwaukee Bucks just got hit with a major setback.

He’s been one of the best bench players in the league, finishing top three in Sixth Man of the Year voting the past two seasons. Without him, Milwaukee will have to dig deep to stay competitive.The Bucks still have an open roster spot, so they could bring in a temporary replacement. But Portis’ toughness and energy aren’t easy to replace.“I will work hard and be ready for our playoff run.

India began their quest for another International Cricket Council (ICC) title by dominating Bangladesh in Dubai on Thursday, which concluded the first two matches in Group A, and action shifts to Group B today (February 21).After veteran pacer Mohammed Shami once again showed his liking for ICC events with a five-wicket haul (5 for 53), India's vice-captain Shubman Gill (101 not out) took over to lead India's six-wicket win with a century while chasing Bangladesh's below-par 228 at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium.""Definitely one of my most satisfying innings that I have played and my first century in ICC events,"" said Man-of-the-Match Gill. ""Very satisfying and very happy with the way I performed.""India went in with three spinners and preferred Harshit Rana over Arshdeep Singh as the second pacer, and the right-arm fast bowler justified that with his spell of 3 for 31.

Empty stands even for India's matches beg the question: Are ODIs dying?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-champions-trophy-2025/empty-stands-even-for-indias-matches-beg-the-question-are-odis-dying/articleshow/118435308.cms,"DESERTED STANDS IN DESERT: The sight of empty stands in Dubai for India's opening game vs Bangladesh made for bad optics. (Getty Images)

DUBAI: Is ODI cricket dying? That's the first question that popped up in one's mind as for the second day running several empty stands were witnessed at a venue in the ICC 2025 Champions Trophy.When proceedings began in India's opening match of the tournament-often referred to as the mini-World Cup- against Bangladesh in a Group A match on Thursday afternoon, there was hardly any crowd at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium- a rare, rare sight when Team India is playing.For a stadium which can accommodate around 30,000 spectators-25,000 is the official capacity, it was not a pleasant sight to see not more than around 10,000 fans at the magnificent DICS after Bangladesh chose to bat first after winning the toss.Soon, pictures of the empty stands during the first half of the match went viral on social media, as fans, justifiably, began wondering about the relevance and future of ODI cricket . Things, of course, were expected to get better when India would bat in the evening, as many spectators would turn up after work-Thursday being obviously a working day-to enjoy the action.However, the fact still can't be ignored that stadiums are packed to the rafters right from ball one when India play their matches in any part of the world, with every ball being cheered loudly, so the crowd no-show in the first half of this game was an even bigger shocker.That it's struggling to attract crowds is not just a hugely worrying sign for the Champions Trophy, being held after a gap of eight years, but also One-Day cricket in particular, which is already facing a question of mere existence in the face of continuous proliferation of glamorous T20 leagues.On Wednesday, there was a pathetic turnout for the opening game of the Champions Trophy between co-hosts Pakistan and New Zealand at the National Stadium in Karachi too, prompting former England captain-turned commentator Michael Vaughan to criticize the authorities on this front. Not only was this host nation Pakistan's first match of the tournament, it was also the start of the first ICC event in the country since 1996-after nearly a three-decade gap.""Great to see the champions trophy being played in Pakistan .. First major event since 1996 .. Have they forgotten to tell the locals it's on .. Where is the crowd ?? #ChampionsTrophy2025,"" wrote Vaughan on X.Highlighting the empty stand in the first match of the Dubai leg of the Champions Trophy, former IPL chairman Lalit Modi , who conceptualized the highly successful and cash-rich T20 league, wondered if the ODIs should be scrapped altogether.""Watching the @ICC champions trophy cricket match between #india and #bangladesh. Stands are empty. That would not happen at an #ipl game. Is the one day format becoming irrelevant to the fans ? What's your view ? Should one day cricket be scrapped and more test cricket?,"" wrote Modi on his X account.The deserted stands, and the lack of interest in this tournament and the ODIs tell you a story-unless this format and this event reinvents itself, their days are numbered.",Empty stands in Dubai for India's opening game vs Bangladesh made for bad optics.
