Jerod Mayo‚Äôs Wife Slams False Narratives Surrounding Patriots‚Äô Decision to Let Him Go



A Season of Struggles For Patriots and Jerod Mayo



After the New England Patriots ended their season with a 23-16 victory over the Buffalo Bills, the team parted ways with head coach Jerod Mayo, ending his one-season tenure. In response to circulating rumors, Mayo's wife, Chantel Mayo, took to Instagram Stories, defending her husband and addressing the speculation. Chantel directly challenged reports, signaling her disapproval of the narratives surrounding his firing.The abrupt firing of Jerod Mayo as the New England Patriots head coach after just one season has sparked controversy and ignited a public debate. While the team struggled mightily, with a dismal 4-13 record, the circumstances surrounding Mayo's dismissal and the subsequent public discourse have raised eyebrows.Mayo's wife, Chantel, took to social media to express her frustration with the ""fake stories"" circulating about her husband. In a series of Instagram Stories, Chantel did not mince words about the treatment her husband has faced since his firing. She revealed that the family had remained silent until now, despite the spreading of false narratives. ‚ÄúIt never even crossed our minds to tell the truth‚Ä¶ but I couldn‚Äôt even fathom all the lies we‚Äôve read that are being told to save face. What happened to the class?????‚Äù she questioned.Chantel‚Äôs frustration underscores the emotional toll the situation has taken. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been taking the high road and letting everyone do their thing since Sunday. But playing with someone‚Äôs name won‚Äôt be tolerated,‚Äù she added, suggesting the false stories circulating have crossed a line.Her posts also included a re-shared message of resilience: ‚ÄúThe attack against you only indicated the potential that‚Äôs within you.‚ÄùChantel and Jerod have been together since their college days and have 4 children.Jerod Mayo‚Äôs transition from a celebrated two-time Pro Bowl linebacker to a head coach was marred by challenges from the outset. The Patriots ended the 2024 season with a disappointing 4-13 record, mirroring their 2023 performance under legendary coach Bill Belichick. This came amid reports of Mayo being placed in an unprepared position for a role of such magnitude.Patriots owner Robert Kraft openly admitted his role in the debacle, stating, ‚ÄúI feel terrible for Jerod because I put him in an untenable situation. I know that he has all the tools as a head coach to be successful in this league. He just needed more time before taking the job.‚ÄùThe sudden departure of Bill Belichick after the 2023 season forced the Patriots to accelerate their succession plan, which had initially aimed for Mayo to take over in 2025. The lack of mentorship and guidance Mayo was supposed to receive from Belichick prior to taking the reins added to the strain of his responsibilities.Reports from The Athletic painted a chaotic picture of Mayo‚Äôs time as head coach. One incident involved him playing cards with players instead of reviewing film following a Week 15 loss to the Arizona Cardinals. Another highlighted a miscommunication during Week 17, where a decision to bench running back Rhamondre Stevenson was not properly relayed, resulting in Stevenson being fielded with the starting offense.Also Read: Where Could Aaron Rodgers Go Next After Speculation of Leaving the Jets? These controversies, coupled with an undermanned roster and an inexperienced coaching staff, proved insurmountable for Mayo. The Patriots‚Äô decision to fire him just hours after a season-ending win against the Buffalo Bills reflected their eagerness for a fresh start.As the Patriots look to rebuild, they have wasted no time in searching for Mayo‚Äôs replacement. Interviews have been conducted with notable candidates, including Mike Vrabel, Ben Johnson, Byron Leftwich, and Pep Hamilton, signaling the team‚Äôs intent to turn the page swiftly.","Jerod Mayo's wife, Chantel, took to social media to express her frustration with the ""fake stories"" circulating about her husband.

Her freshman year, I think at Providence, they took second in the state and she was the most viable player in the state.But Ashley‚Äôs such a great athlete, she could have gone to any school in the country with three different sports: Basketball, track and field and volleyball. She winded up in gymnastics, she wanted to be a flyer and she outgrew that.‚ÄùHe further stated where this inspiration came from, he stated, ‚ÄúShe ended up coming to see my [WWE Hall of Fame] induction in 2012, my second ring for The Four Horsemen. Somebody asked her ‚ÄòWhy aren‚Äôt you wrestling?‚Äô and she walked out of the room and I could tell she was thinking about it.She came back and said ‚ÄòDo you think I could do this?‚Äô and I said ‚ÄòI‚Äôm sure you could do it but do you really want to?‚Äô But she‚Äôs at the top of the hill now, the best in the business.‚ÄùALSO READ: Charlotte Flair's Comeback is Happening Sooner Than You Think, Details Inside!

The Great Khali: 10 Controversies That Shaped His WWE Legacy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/wwe/top-stories/the-great-khali-10-controversies-that-shaped-his-wwe-legacy/articleshow/117152389.cms,"1. The Botched Debut Attack on The Undertaker (2006)

8. His Sudden Exit from WWE (2014)

9. The Unplanned Return at Battleground 2017

10. WWE Hall of Fame Induction (2021)

The Great Khali, WWE‚Äôs first Indian World Heavyweight Champion, was one of the most physically imposing superstars in wrestling history. Standing at 7 feet 1 inch and weighing over 350 pounds, he was a spectacle in the ring. However, his career was not without controversy making Khali‚Äôs run in WWE as polarizing as it was legendary.Here are 10 major controversies that defined The Great Khali‚Äôs time in WWE:When The Great Khali debuted in April 2006, he was immediately placed in a feud with The Undertaker. During his first attack, he delivered a series of sloppy and stiff strikes, causing legitimate concern about his in-ring safety. Many felt he was too inexperienced to be working with a legend like The Undertaker so soon.Khali‚Äôs sheer size and lack of agility made him a dangerous opponent in the ring. He accidentally injured multiple superstars, including: The Undertaker in 2006 with a botched move nearly caused serious injury, Hornswoggle in 2008 where a mistimed chop during a segment led to real bruising and John Cena in 2007 where rough handling in a match left Cena banged up. Many wrestlers and fans questioned whether Khali was too unsafe for the WWE ring.Khali was supposed to compete in the first-ever Punjabi Prison Match against The Undertaker at The Great American Bash 2006. However, he was pulled due to medical concerns, and the match was given to Big Show instead.When Khali finally competed in a Punjabi Prison Match against Batista at No Mercy 2007, the match was widely panned as slow and boring. Despite being named after him, the Punjabi Prison Match became infamous for its confusing rules and lackluster action.One of Khali‚Äôs biggest wins also became one of WWE‚Äôs most criticized booking decisions. At Judgment Day 2006, Khali defeated The Undertaker clean‚Äîone of the rarest feats in WWE.Many fans hated the decision, feeling that a newcomer like Khali didn‚Äôt deserve to beat one of WWE‚Äôs biggest legends in such a dominant fashion.In July 2007, The Great Khali won a battle royal to become the World Heavyweight Champion. While historic for Indian wrestling, many fans and critics believed he was one of the worst champions in WWE history due to poor in-ring ability, lack of promo skills and sluggish match pacingHis reign lasted 61 days before he dropped the title to Batista, and many felt his push was purely for WWE‚Äôs expansion into India, rather than based on his skills.After his main-event run ended, WWE repurposed Khali into a comedic character with the ‚ÄúKhali Kiss Cam‚Äù. This gimmick saw him kissing female fans in the audience, often awkwardly and uncomfortably.Many hated this gimmick, calling it cringeworthy and forced, especially since Khali had been built as a monster just a year earlier.One of Khali‚Äôs strangest storylines was his mini-feud with Hornswoggle, where WWE booked a 7-foot giant against a 4-foot tall character.The matches were filled with bizarre comedy, including Khali pretending to be scared of Hornswoggle and eventually ‚Äúadopting‚Äù him as a friend. The feud was universally mocked for making Khali look foolish.After years of declining relevance, The Great Khali‚Äôs WWE contract expired in 2014, and WWE chose not to renew it.However, his exit was met with controversy, as reports surfaced that WWE officials felt he was too immobile and unsafe to continue performing. Some even claimed he was quietly pushed out due to WWE shifting creative directions.Khali shocked fans when he returned unexpectedly at Battleground 2017, helping Jinder Mahal retain the WWE Championship against Randy Orton in another Punjabi Prison Match.While the moment was intended to be dramatic, many fans criticised it as random, unnecessary, and a desperate nostalgia grab.He disappeared again after this return, making it feel even more pointless.When The Great Khali was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2021, the decision was highly controversial. Many fans and analysts argued that his in-ring career was below average, he had no classic matches and also that he was mostly used as a marketable giant rather than a great wrestlerDespite this, WWE defended the decision, citing his impact on Indian wrestling and WWE‚Äôs global outreach.The Great Khali‚Äôs WWE career was a mix of shocking moments, questionable booking, and occasional highlights. While he is celebrated in India as a pioneer for Indian wrestlers, his overall wrestling ability and legacy remain highly debated.","The Great Khali was WWE‚Äôs first Indian World Heavyweight Champion.

David White on New Zealand Cricket's revival and their Champions Trophy chances

New Zealand squad:

Mitchell Santner (capt), Will Young, Devon Conway, Rachin Ravindra, Kane Williamson, Mark Chapman, Daryl Mitchell, Tom Latham, Glenn Phillips, Michael Bracewell, Nathan Smith, Matt Henry, Lockie Ferguson, Ben Sears, Will O'Rourke

The New Zealand cricket team has announced its 15-member squad for the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 , set to be held in Pakistan and the UAE. The highly anticipated tournament marks the Champions Trophy's return to the international calendar after an eight-year hiatus.The announcement took place at a special event at the Pullman Hotel in Auckland, with excitement centering on the inclusion of pace trio Will O'Rourke, Ben Sears, and Nathan Smith, who are set to make their debuts in a senior ICC event.Sears, a traveling reserve for last year's ICC T20 World Cup, returns to the international fold following a knee injury that kept him out of action for much of the past season. The 26-year-old made his comeback during the Wellington Firebirds' Super Smash match last Thursday. Meanwhile, O'Rourke and Smith have seen their stock rise in recent seasons, becoming key contributors for the Blackcaps across formats.The squad features a mix of youth and experience, led by newly appointed white-ball captain Mitchell Santner. Santner takes the reins for his first major ICC event as skipper, supported by senior players Kane Williamson and Tom Latham. Latham, who will also don the wicketkeeping gloves, and Williamson, the team's most experienced batter, bring valuable expertise, having featured in the 2013 and 2017 editions of the tournament.The pace attack is bolstered by veterans Matt Henry and Lockie Ferguson, with Jacob Duffy named as a standby player should Ferguson face availability issues due to ILT20 play-offs. Santner leads the spin department, supported by all-rounders Rachin Ravindra, Glenn Phillips, and Michael Bracewell. Devon Conway and Will Young add stability at the top of the order, while Daryl Mitchell and Mark Chapman provide depth and power to the middle order.The Champions Trophy holds special significance for New Zealand, as the team famously won the inaugural edition - then known as the ICC KnockOut Trophy - by defeating India in a memorable final in Nairobi in 2000.The Blackcaps, who have reached at least the semi-finals in four of their last five ICC events, are drawn in Group A alongside hosts Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh. Only the top two teams will progress to the semi-finals.Head coach Gary Stead congratulated the players, particularly the three newcomers, and acknowledged the tournament's unique challenges.""ICC tournaments represent the pinnacle of our game, and it's a huge honor to be selected,"" said Stead. ""The Champions Trophy's format requires teams to hit the ground running, and our preparations during the Tri-Series against Pakistan and South Africa will be crucial.""The team departs for Pakistan on February 3 to begin its campaign, with the opening match scheduled against Pakistan in Karachi on February 19. The Blackcaps' support staff includes batting coach Luke Ronchi, bowling coach Jacob Oram, and specialist spin coach Rangana Herath, who brings valuable subcontinental experience.","The New Zealand cricket team has announced its 15-member squad for the ICC Champions Trophy 2025.

India squad for England T20Is

MUMBAI: Almost 14 months after he last played for India, in the 2023 ODI World Cup final against Australia at Ahmedabad on November 19 before he was sidelined due to an ankle injury which needed surgery and then suffered from swelling in his knees, veteran pacer Mohammed Shami is finally back.The 34-year-old fast bowler, who was out of the Indian team for a long time due to a knee injury, was on Saturday recalled for the five-match T20I series at home against England, which will start from Jan 22 at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata.The other big development that emerged from the meeting of the Ajit Agarkar-headed national selection committee, which assembled at a five-star hotel here to pick the team for the T20Is (the meeting was also attended by India‚Äôs T20I captain Suryakumar Yadav, was the appointment of left-arm spinning allrounder Axar Patel as the vice-captain of the side, and the exclusion of star wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant, dashing opener Yashasvi Jaiswal and opener Shubman Gill from this team.The in-form Sanju Samson and Dhruv Jurel are the two wicketkeepers in the side, while Samson and Abhishek Sharma are the two openers in the team.This is the first time that Axar has been elevated to the position of vice-captaincy of the Indian team in any format, and the Gujarat bowler seems to have been rewarded for his fine all-round show in India‚Äôs triumphant campaign in the T20 World Cup in June June last year, where he took nine wickets in eight matches@19.22, and scored 92 runs @23.00, including a crucial 47 off 31 balls in the final against South Africa.A source insisted to TOI that ‚ÄúPant, Jaiswal and Gill have been rested from this series to allow them to recover fully after a gruelling five-Test Border-Gavaskar series in Australia, for the ODIs against England and the Champions Trophy in February.‚ÄùDuring the T20I series against South Africa in November last year, Samson had become the first Indian cricketer to score back-to-back centuries in T20 Internationals when he scored 107 runs off 50 balls, with seven fours and ten sixes, following up on his 40-ball hundred against Bangladesh.‚ÄúIt was impossible to exclude Sanju when he‚Äôs been in this blazing form,‚Äù a source in the BCCI told TOI. For all his incredible talent and the ability to tear apart an attack, Pant‚Äôs white-ball returns have nowhere ben similar to his massive achievements in Test cricket. In 76 T20Is, all the Delhi man has managed is 1209 runs@23.25, with three fifties.With fears around ace pacer Jasprit Bumrah ‚Äôs injury being serious, it's now almost certain that Shami will also be picked for the three-match ODI series against England, and the ICC Champions Trophy after that, in what will be a huge boost to India‚Äôs pace attack, since Bumrah is set to be rested from the ODI series too.As expected, Bumrah, who suffered a back injury during the fifth and final Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy at Sydney due to his heavy workload, and his fellow fast bowler Siraj, who too played in all the Tests of the series, have been given a break from the T20I series, while express pacer Mayank Yadav is out due to a back injury which caused him to miss the T20I series against South Africa last year too.Even as Bumrah fired all cylinders, India felt Shami's absence heavily in the recently-concluded Border-Gavaskar Trophy, which they lost 3-1. For the past couple of months, there was some drama and lack of clarity around Shami‚Äôs fitness status. During the BGT, Indian captain Rohit Sharma had urged the BCCI's National Cricket Academy to issue a statement to give clarity on Shami's fitness status.A BCCI release on December 23 had stated: ‚ÄúBased on the current medical assessment, the BCCI medical team has determined that his knee requires more time for controlled exposure to bowling loads. Consequently, he has not been deemed fit for consideration for the remaining two Tests of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.‚ÄùHowever, since his return from injury, Shami has been bowling consistently across formats for Bengal in domestic cricket -he played a match in the Ranji Trophy, and then in the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy, and then took five wickets in three matches in the Vijay Hazare Trophy.All-rounder Riyan Parag is not a part of the squad due to injury, while allrounder Nitish Kumar Reddy, who was India‚Äôs find of the series in Australia, scoring a memorable maiden ton at the MCG, has been picked ahead of Ramandeep Singh, who was a part of the Indian T20 team in South Africa last year. Washington Sundar and Varun Chakravarthy are the other spinners in the side.Suryakumar Yadav (C), Sanju Samson (wk), Abhishek Sharma, Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya , Rinku Singh, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Axar Patel (vc), Harshit Rana, Arshdeep Singh, Mohammad Shami, Varun Chakaravarthy, Ravi Bishnoi, Washington Sundar, Dhruv Jurel (wk).","Mohammed Shami has been recalled for the T20I series against England. The 34-year-old fast bowler was out of the Indian team for a long time due to a knee injury. Axar Patel has been appointed vice-captain of the side. Star wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant, dashing opener Yashasvi Jaiswal and opener Shubman Gill have been rested.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117151482,imgsize-43896,width-400,resizemode-4/117151482.jpg"

Will Ferrell's Hilarious Take on Travis Kelce's Dunk Fail and Record-Breaking Feat



Travis Kelce Remains Hungry After Breaking Chiefs' Touchdown Record



Playoff Preview, Rest vs. Records, and Blind Ranking the Best Plays of the NFL Season | Ep 121

The NFL world and comedy collided when Emmy-winning actor Will Ferrell made a guest appearance on Travis and Jason Kelce's ""New Heights"" podcast. Known for his unmatched humor, Ferrell didn't hold back, especially when recalling one unforgettable moment from Travis Kelce ‚Äôs career‚Äîa missed dunk that followed a historic touchdown.In Week 17's Christmas Day game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Travis Kelce broke the Kansas City Chiefs ‚Äô all-time touchdown record , surpassing the legendary Tony Gonzalez. As a tribute to the Hall of Famer, Kelce attempted to dunk the ball over the uprights after scoring the historic touchdown. However, his dunk attempt fell short, a moment Ferrell gleefully dissected during the podcast.‚ÄúI gotta bring something up,‚Äù Ferrell said, diving straight into the topic. ‚ÄúI happened to be watching, during the holiday break, the Pittsburgh game. When you scored, you went to go dunk the football, you missed the dunk.‚ÄùKelce, ever the good sport, admitted to the mishap, responding, ‚ÄúI did not dunk it. I did not dunk it.‚Äù Ferrell took the banter a step further, jokingly questioning Kelce‚Äôs athleticism. ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt have the same hops,‚Äù Ferrell quipped, prompting Kelce to acknowledge, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt have the ups anymore. I used to.‚ÄùStanding 6-foot-5 and at the age of 35, Kelce might not possess the same explosiveness he once had, but his accomplishments remain unmatched. Drafted by the Chiefs in 2013, the three-time Super Bowl champion and 10-time Pro Bowler has cemented his legacy with 77 career touchdowns.Despite the lighthearted exchange with Ferrell, Kelce took a reflective moment on the ""New Heights"" podcast to discuss the significance of his achievement. While he appreciates the magnitude of breaking the Chiefs‚Äô touchdown record, Kelce is far from complacent.""I feel like towards the end of your career, when you hit these milestones, anybody playing past 10 years is gonna hit some type of milestone,"" Kelce remarked. ""... It's cool but ... I feel like I'm in such a mode of trying to be better than I was yesterday. I'm always thinking of, 'I need to be better.'""Kelce emphasized that he remains laser-focused on growth, striving to reach new heights in his career. ""I'm not about to sit here and think about how far I've come when I'm still striving to go somewhere that's even greater than where I'm at,"" he added.Over the years, Kelce‚Äôs perspective on greatness has evolved. Early in his career, stats were his primary measure of success. Now, he values his broader impact on the game.""I know how to influence a game more than just what the stat book says. And I kind of pride myself on that now,"" Kelce explained. This mindset reflects his relentless drive to be the best version of himself, transcending numbers to leave a lasting legacy.Also Read: Brittany Mahomes Rocks Fitness Goals With 'Baddie' Workout Routine While Awaiting Baby No. 3 Kelce‚Äôs achievements showcase his dedication to excellence, while his words provide a glimpse into his elite mentality. Even after making history, Kelce‚Äôs hunger for improvement remains insatiable‚Äîa true testament to why he‚Äôs one of the NFL‚Äôs greats.

LIVE: India batters had a miserable show Down Under | Here‚Äôs what went wrong

SYDNEY: India captain Rohit Sharma was all set to call it a day after the fourth Test versus Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) but it is understood that some ""well-wishers"" from the outside forced him to change his mind.After batting in the middle order in Adelaide and Brisbane, Rohit returned to open for the Boxing Day Test and the move forced Shubman Gill out of the playing XI. Even that didn't help as the right-hander failed to get going in both the innings and India suffered a comprehensive defeat.""Rohit had made up his mind after MCG. Had his well wishers from the outside didn't force him to change his mind, we could have well seen another retirement in Australia,"" said a source aware of developments. With just 31 runs in five Border-Gavaskar Trophy innings and six defeats in the last six Tests as captain, Rohit had made up his mind. There was, however, a change of heart before the New Year Test in Sydney and it is learnt that it didn't sit well with coach Gautam Gambhir . Rohit didn't feature in that final Test, which India lost to lose the series 3-1, but all is still not well between him and Gambhir.The head coach's statement on the captain's participation in the final Test did raise some eyebrows and Rohit's indifferent conduct during the team's final training session Down Under was a strong sign of things to come. He didn't even feature in the 15-member squad for the fifth Test but assured the fans and stakeholders that he's not going anywhere. In an interview with broadcaster Star Sports, he added that he is sensible enough to take his calls and felt it wasn't ideal to feature in the XI when runs weren't coming off his bat.More than the runs, it's the coach-captain dynamics which are worth taking note. They have disagreed on plenty of matters in the past few series. From squad composition to toss decisions, it's understood that there have been occasions where the two continue to be in different corners.The two have no option but to co-exist at the moment as they will be back together for the ICC Champions Trophy, which starts next month, and it could well be the last hurrah for some senior India cricketers in the ODIs. Rohit Sharma Virat Kohli and Ravindra Jadeja have already announced retirement from T20Is and it now remains to be seen who keeps going beyond the multi-nation tournament.","India captain Rohit Sharma was all set to call it a day after the fourth Test versus Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) It is understood that some ""well-wishers"" from the outside forced him to change his mind.

SA20: Faf du Plessis on Joburg Super Kings squad, the Wanderers, and longevity

MI Cape Town 's Dewald Brevis stole the spotlight with a jaw-dropping boundary catch to dismiss Joburg Super Kings ' skipper Faf du Plessis during a rain-affected SA20 clash at the Wanderers on Saturday. The incredible moment unfolded on the first ball of the eighth over, bowled by Kagiso Rabada , when du Plessis, batting on 30, appeared to have struck a certain six.Brevis, nicknamed ""Baby AB"" for his remarkable skills, defied the odds on the slippery Johannesburg outfield. He intercepted the ball inches from the boundary rope, threw it into the air, and dived back in to complete the catch, leaving spectators and players in awe. After a careful review by the third umpire, the decision was confirmed, drawing widespread acclaim.The league celebrated the feat with the caption: ""Dewald Brevis! You absolute beauty! What a catch that is!!!"" alongside a video of the stunning effort, which quickly went viral.Despite Brevis' heroics and a stellar bowling display from Kagiso Rabada (2/10), MI Cape Town fell short as persistent rain handed Joburg Super Kings a six-run victory via the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern (DLS) method.Joburg Super Kings were set a revised target of 136 runs after multiple rain interruptions. They were comfortably ahead at 82/3 in 11.3 overs when rain returned to halt proceedings for good. Leus du Plooy (24 not out) and Wihan Lubbe (0 not out) were at the crease when the match was called off, securing four crucial points for the Super Kings.Earlier, MI Cape Town struggled at 30/4 before George Linde (48) and Delano Potgieter (44) powered them to a respectable 140/6 with a crucial 65-run stand. However, their efforts were overshadowed by the rain and Brevis' unforgettable moment of brilliance in the field.","MI Cape Town's Dewald Brevis stole the spotlight with a jaw-dropping boundary catch to dismiss Joburg Super Kings'skipper Faf du Plessis during a rain- affected SA20 clash.

When India head coach Gautam Gambhir lost his cool in Australia

Gautam Gambhir press conference: On Kohli, Rohit and dressing room

NEW DELHI: Gautam Gambhir 's tenure as India's head coach has been a topic of intense discussion, with mixed performances across formats drawing attention to his leadership. While his influence in T20 cricket has been widely praised, the results in Tests and ODIs have raised questions about the challenges he faced early in his stint.India began well under Gambhir in Test cricket with a 2-0 series win over Bangladesh, but things quickly turned difficult with a 0-3 defeat to New Zealand and a 1-3 loss to Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Reflecting on this, Dinesh Karthik , speaking on Cricbuzz, commented, ""The Bangladesh series was a success, and I think post that, things have gone downhill for him in Tests.""Karthik acknowledged the difficulties Gambhir faces, stepping into the role after Rahul Dravid 's successful stint. ""You've got to give Gambhir some slack. He has come in at a very tough time post the successful regime of Rahul Dravid. It's never easy to fill those shoes,"" Karthik said.Gambhir's remarks about the future of senior players Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli following the Australia series also sparked interest. On this, Karthik shared, ""He [Gambhir] wants them [Rohit and Kohli] to take a decision as to what they feel is best.""In the ODI format, India has played only a handful of matches under Gambhir, including a series loss to Sri Lanka. ""When it comes to ODIs, they haven't played too much, but also remember they lost the series against Sri Lanka. So, it hasn't been easy in Tests and a very small sample size for ODIs,"" Karthik noted.The coach's success in T20 cricket, however, has been a bright spot. ""He has found immense success in T20 cricket. He has a lot of young boys, and he has been able to have a massive influence over them,"" Karthik remarked, contrasting this with the struggles in Tests.When assessing Gambhir's impact, Karthik pointed to the importance of harmony between the coach's vision and the players' mindset. ""The biggest decision for him to make is: Is he very happy with this current set of players? Is he able to influence them over decision-making? Are they aligned with his thought process? If these players are fitting in, then great. If not, then we have to figure out what is the best way moving forward. Test cricket has been hard for Gautam Gambhir as the coach.""Karthik concluded by acknowledging the challenges Gambhir faces and the limited influence a coach can have during matches. ""The pressure is mounting. All he can do is give them freedom, give them the security they want in the dressing room, and try to keep a very nice and safe even sort of place there. But when the player walks out, he has to find a way to counter his demons and the opposition's questions,"" he concluded.",Gautam Gambhir's tenure as India's head coach has been a topic of intense discussion.

Joe Root lauds Lhuan-dre Pretorius after SA20 debut heroics

NEW DELHI: Teenager Lhuan-dre Pretorius has catapulted himself into the spotlight after a breathtaking 97 off just 51 balls on debut during the SA20 league , guiding the Paarl Royals to a commanding nine-wicket win over Sunrisers Eastern Cape at Boland Park on Saturday.At just 18, the SA20 rising star exhibited extraordinary composure, strength, and range in an innings that included 10 fours and six towering maximums.Pretorius was electric from the start, unleashing a mix of audacious pulls and commanding drives that set the stage for a 132-run opening stand with the ever-reliable Joe Root The England batting maestro, calm and calculated, played the perfect foil, remaining unbeaten on 62 off 44 deliveries. Together, they dismantled a Sunrisers attack filled with experienced campaigners.Root heaped praise on his young partner after the match. ‚ÄúPhenomenal,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen what he‚Äôs capable of during the warm-up games, but to replicate that on this stage, against such quality bowlers, was scintillating. He made my job a lot easier. Hopefully, he can build on that for the rest of the tournament now.‚ÄùRoot commended Pretorius' ability to remain unfazed under pressure. ‚ÄúHe's such a strong boy, hits the ball so cleanly. He's got such wide-ranging areas where he can score and access the ground. It's more a case of just trying to keep things simple for him. The more he trusted his ability, the cleaner he struck it, and the harder it was for them to keep him quiet,‚Äù Root added.The Sunrisers looked in a strong position earlier, thanks to captain Aiden Markram ‚Äôs elegant 82 off 49 balls, forming a crucial 102-run partnership with Tristan Stubbs (28 not out).However, the Royals‚Äô bowlers, led by teenager Kwena Maphaka (2/35) and spinner Mujeeb Ur Rahman (2/27), kept the Sunrisers to 175/5.The Royals now head confidently into a Western Cape derby against MI Cape Town on Monday, while the Sunrisers aim to regroup ahead of their Centurion clash against the Pretoria Capitals on Tuesday.READ ALSO: Dewald Brevis takes a spectacular boundary catch in JSK-MICT SA20 clash - Watch",Paarl Royals beat Sunrisers Eastern Cape by nine wickets.

Tony Gonzalez , a legendary tight end in NFL history, achieved 15,127 receiving yards, 1,325 receptions, and 111 touchdowns. His iconic goal post dunk celebration was banned by the NFL after his retirement, leaving fans nostalgic for a simpler era of celebratory football. Travis Kelce , who has redefined the tight end position with over 12,000 receiving yards and seven consecutive 1,000-yard seasons, decided to pay homage to Gonzalez with the move. As a result of the lighthearted moment that mixed two eras of NFL glory, Kelce was fined for the joke that came from Jon Runyan's adoration of the number 69.Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce was expecting punishment after celebrating his Christmas Day Game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Kelce's 77th career touchdown on December 25 passed Tony Gonzalez for the most receiving touchdowns in Chiefs franchise history , surpassing Hall of Famer.All-Pro tight end Kelce honored the Chiefs icon by dunking the football on the crossbar after scoring a historic touchdown, a gesture that was a special way to commemorate his historic feat. The league eventually fined Kelce $14,069 for his celebration. It was deemed unsportsmanlike conduct after the Chiefs star used the crossbar as a prop.Travis Kelce discussed an incident on his ""New Heights"" podcast with his brother, Jason Kelce, stating that he was ""of course"" punished by the NFL for his antics. He said, ""They said since I touched the goal post it was a fine."" Kelce admitted that his dunk did not go as planned and that it wasn't his best moment.""I was trying to get my (expletive) old ass up there, man,"" Kelce said. ""Fourth quarter of the game, my (expletive) legs are tired after a 10-play drive. ... I'm just like, 'Screw it, I'm gonna send it one time for old time's sake.'""... That was me slapping the backboard. That wasn't me actually flushing it.""In November, Tony Gonzalez offered Kelce a fine if he dunked the ball, but Kelce declined, stating that while he appreciated the gesture, there was no need for the same. ""Tony, you don't have to do that, dude,"" Kelce said on the podcast. ""It was so cool to hear you even say it, dude, but you don't have to help me pay that fine.""Also Read: ‚ÄúDumb frat boy‚Äù: Fans trash Travis Kelce claiming he is out of his league to marry superstar Taylor Swift Tony Gonzalez set a record for the greatest tight end of all time, but Kelce is making a strong case for the title.

ILT20 CEO David White on the upcoming third edition, surge in New Zealand cricket

ILT20: Captain speak on media day ahead of third season

DUBAI: UAE players are sharing the same roof with cricket legends from around the globe at the ILT20 . The tournament has significantly helped UAE cricketers elevate their game, offering them the opportunity to share the dressing room with players who have proven their mettle on the biggest stages.Former New Zealand cricketer Simon Doull believes the ILT20 provides local players with invaluable experience, allowing them to spend four to five weeks alongside seasoned international professionals and top-tier coaches.This exposure, according to Doull, is instrumental in shaping the future of UAE cricket.Doull, who represented New Zealand in 32 Tests and 42 ODIs between 1992 and 2000, returns to the commentary panel for the third consecutive season of the ILT20.The commentary team for ILT20 Season 3 boasts an impressive lineup of cricket icons, including Ian Smith, Ian Bishop, Simon Doull, Virender Sehwag, Wasim Akram , Waqar Younis, Shoaib Akhtar, Harbhajan Singh, Niall O‚ÄôBrien, and Alan Wilkins. Adding further depth and diversity are Anjum Chopra, Saba Karim, Rohan Gavaskar, Nikhil Chopra, Daren Ganga, Urooj Mumtaz, Vivek Razdan, Reema Malhotra, and Ajay Mehra.""From Season 1, you're never quite sure what to expect, but all the teams have improved year after year. Last season was fantastic, both from an international and local perspective. Every season, the local players get the invaluable experience of spending four to five weeks in the dressing room with senior players from around the world - highly experienced professionals and top-quality coaches,"" Doull said.""This exposure naturally helps improve cricket in the region. In the future, I'd love to see three local players in the playing XI, but for that to happen, the talent needs time to develop. And to develop, local players need consistent opportunities to learn alongside international stars. Progress is happening, but it won't come overnight - like when you dye your hair, it doesn't turn black immediately,"" he said.""I'm just looking forward to some great games. Sometimes, a low-scoring thriller can be even more exciting than a match with 200-plus scores. With the quality and balance across all the teams, we'll see a lot of changes as the tournament progresses - injuries, player replacements, and some players joining later after finishing other commitments""What's also fascinating is how the different venues, even though they're just an hour and a half apart, each offer unique challenges. The surfaces play differently - you might need high-quality seamers here, more seam options in Abu Dhabi, and perhaps world-class spinners when you're in Sharjah.""The development of teams and the strategic use of impact players will be crucial once again. It's shaping up to be another thrilling season,"" he said.",Former New Zealand cricketer Simon Doull says the ILT20 provides local players with invaluable experience. Doull represented New Zealand in 32 Tests and 42 ODIs between 1992 and 2000.

Dinesh Karthik makes SA20 debut, praises Joe Root‚Äôs impact at Paarl Royals

Joburg Super Kings (JSK) secured a six-run victory over MI Cape Town via the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern (DLS) method in a rain-marred SA20 clash at the Wanderers on Saturday.Persistent thunder showers on the Highveld caused multiple interruptions, ultimately leading to a curtailed contest where JSK emerged victorious.The match was initially set for a target of 141 runs, but a lengthy delay after the innings break revised the chase to 136 runs from 19 overs. JSK were well-positioned at 82/3 after 11.3 overs when rain returned, putting them six runs ahead on the DLS calculation. With the downpour persisting, the game was called off, handing JSK the victory and four valuable match points.At the crease for JSK when play stopped were Leus du Plooy (24 not out) and Wihan Lubbe (0 not out). Captain Faf du Plessis provided a steady foundation earlier in the innings with a 30-run knock, off 23 balls, before a stunning dismissal, caught by Dewald Brevis at the cover boundary. Brevis showcased exceptional athleticism, tipping the ball back into play and completing a diving catch in the same motion.For MI Cape Town, Kagiso Rabada impressed in his first appearance of Season 3, claiming 2/10 in a fiery spell. However, his efforts were in vain as the rain thwarted Cape Town's chances of a comeback.Earlier in the day, MI Cape Town‚Äôs innings struggled for momentum, with JSK reducing them to 30/4. George Linde played a crucial role in the recovery, anchoring the innings with an unbeaten 48 off 35 balls, laced with five boundaries and two sixes.Linde found brief support in Brevis, who contributed 14 runs in a 43-run fifth-wicket partnership, but further setbacks followed as Azmatullah Omarzai fell for just one.Delano Potgieter continued his fine form from the season opener, smashing a rapid 44 not out off 22 balls. His knock, featuring four boundaries and three sixes, came in an unbroken 65-run partnership with Linde, propelling MI Cape Town to a respectable 140/6.Despite their spirited effort, the weather ultimately decided the outcome, with JSK emerging triumphant in the rain-curtailed encounter. The victory boosts JSK's campaign as they look to maintain momentum in a highly competitive tournament.","Joburg Super Kings beat MI Cape Town by six runs in SA20 clash.

'Get ready for a bigger and better ILT20': Ashish Sehgal

Dubai Capitals secured a dramatic one-run victory over MI Emirates in the opening match of ILT20 Season 3 at the Dubai International Stadium on Saturday. In a contest that went down to the wire, the Capitals overcame a brilliant half-century by Nicholas Pooran to register the narrowest win in the tournament's history.Chasing a modest target of 134, MI Emirates seemed to have the upper hand as they required just 16 runs off the final 15 balls. However, the Capitals' bowling unit, led by Player of the Match Gulbadin Naib , staged a remarkable comeback. Naib bowled with precision, claiming 3 for 13 in his four overs, including the vital wicket of Pooran in the 18th over. Olly Stone, who returned figures of 2 for 14, also played a key role by conceding just one run in the 19th over.The pressure was on the experienced Kieron Pollard to finish the chase in the last over, with MI Emirates needing 13 runs to win. However, Farhan Khan held his nerve, giving away only 11 runs and denying Pollard the finishing touch, as MI Emirates fell short on the final ball of the match.Pooran was the standout performer for MI Emirates, scoring a brilliant 61 off 40 balls, studded with three boundaries and four sixes. After MI Emirates slumped to 23/4 in 4.3 overs, Pooran stitched a crucial 79-run partnership with Akeal Hosein (30 off 31 balls). Their effort revived the innings and brought MI Emirates within touching distance of victory. However, Naib's double strike in the 18th over, including the dismissal of Pooran, turned the game in the Capitals' favour.Earlier, the Dubai Capitals struggled to put up a competitive total, finishing at 133/8 in their 20 overs. Fazalhaq Farooqi was the star with the ball for MI Emirates, claiming an extraordinary five-wicket haul (5 for 15). His clinical performance included a toe-crushing yorker to dismiss Rovman Powell (25 off 20 balls) in the 19th over. Farooqi's late burst also saw him send Dasun Shanaka (13) and Olly Stone back to the pavilion, leaving the Capitals with an underwhelming total to defend.Scottish batter Brandon McMullen was the anchor for the Capitals' innings, scoring a gritty 58 off 42 balls, which included four boundaries and three sixes. McMullen's effort helped the Capitals recover from a slow start after both openers, Shai Hope and Adam Rossington, were dismissed for single-digit scores. Rovman Powell contributed a quickfire 25, but the Capitals struggled to accelerate in the death overs, managing only four runs in the final over.Despite their low total, the Capitals' bowlers stepped up to the occasion.""That is the beauty of cricket and T20,"" said Naib after the match. ""Not a good total on the board, but we defended it, with the guys giving 100%. The pitch was helping the bowlers a lot. Not easy for the batters. We just tried to keep it stump to stump, and we did it.""The thrilling victory sets the tone for an action-packed ILT20 Season 3, promising more edge-of-the-seat moments in the weeks to come.","Dubai Capitals secure dramatic one-run victory over MI Emirates in opening match of ILT20 Season 3.

India are coming off a 1-3 series defeat in Australia and now face England in the limited-overs series at home. Do you think they will be under a lot of pressure?

What‚Äôs your prediction for the series?

Do you think England will miss Ben Stokes?

The England series will be an important platform for out-of-form Rohit and Virat to rediscover their touch ahead of the Champions Trophy. What‚Äôs your take on this?

You‚Äôve spent considerable time with Bumrah at Mumbai Indians. How crucial a role do you think he will play for India in the Champions Trophy, should he be fit to play?

Is there any upcoming Indian bowler who has particularly impressed you?

DUBAI: All eyes will be on Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli when India take on England in the limited-overs series at home, as both the star batters aim to regain form and get into rhythm ahead of the ICC Champions Trophy next month.India will play five T20Is and three ODIs against England.England left-arm pacer Tymal Mills , currently playing in the ILT20 Season 3 for Gulf Giants in the UAE, believes that Rohit and Virat will soon find their form with the bat. Mills, who has played alongside both the players at Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) and Mumbai Indians (MI) in the Indian Premier League (IPL). He was part of the RCB squad in 2017 before joining MI in 2022.In an interview with TimesofIndia.com, Mills shared his thoughts on the upcoming India vs England series, Virat and Rohit's form, Bumrah and more.There's always pressure in Indian cricket, as you know. The media gives them high praise and also high scorn, so I'm sure it'll be a great series. A full white-ball tour of India is always a great experience. I've been lucky enough to tour there and play international cricket against India in their home conditions, so it's obviously a very daunting task.They're obviously very strong. Their talent pool is very deep and experienced, but the England team will go there confident. They've got a lot of young players, a lot of players who are keen to express themselves ahead of the Champions Trophy. So I'm sure there'll be a lot of eyes on the series. I'll be keeping an eye on it for sure.England will win both the series ‚Äî ODIs and T20Is.Yeah, of course. Stokes had another bad hamstring injury, which is a shame. He's obviously one of the best players in the world. Anytime you lose a player like that to injury, it hurts your side. England have a lot of depth and quality, particularly in white-ball cricket. I'm sure guys will be confident in replacing him.You don't get the reputation for scoring the amount of runs these guys (Virat and Rohit) have scored in their careers just by luck. It's because they're two of the best players to have ever played (the sport). They'll be able to ride the highs and the lows better than anybody else, and they'll obviously have a lot of self-belief in their abilities.They've gone through tough times before and come out the other side, and they'll know what they need to do to come out on the other side (once again). Hopefully, not too much against England, but you won't be surprised to see them both scoring runs again.Jasprit is definitely the best bowler in the world across all three formats. He's a special bowler in Test cricket, 50-over cricket and T20s. A lovely guy as well. I really enjoyed my time at Mumbai, spending time with him and speaking to him both on and off the field. Any team that has him is very lucky. He's an excellent bowler in all phases of the game.He's obviously a prized asset, and you have to look after him. If you need to give him rest sporadically to keep him at his best for long periods, then I'm sure they'll do that. He's obviously a fantastic bowler.It's difficult. Obviously, the fast bowler who burst onto the scene in the IPL ‚Äî Mayank Yadav. Anytime you find a fast bowler like that, it's exciting. I like Arshdeep Singh, the left-arm seamer. I know he's not new or up-and-coming, but he's got great skills and swings the ball both ways. There are lots of fast bowlers in India now who are coming up, improving themselves and getting opportunities in the IPL.",Tymal Mills believes Virat and Rohit will soon find their form with the bat.

David, as a former New Zealand cricketer, how does it feel to have a New Zealand legend like Tim Southee participating in this tournament?



Can you share your thoughts on the involvement of Indian players in the ILT20?



Former New Zealand batter David White , who served as the chief executive of New Zealand Cricket for over a decade, now holds the position of CEO for the ILT20 .In an exclusive interview with TimesofIndia.com, White shared insights on the upcoming third edition of the ILT20 in the UAE, the enthusiasm among fans, the inclusion of veteran pacer Tim Southee , and much more.White, a former New Zealand cricketer, represented his country in two Tests and three ODIs during his playing career.Season three brings massive excitement. We have a Bollywood-style pre-match opening ceremony followed by the opening match of the tournament. The tournament will be fantastic. The planning for the entire event is looking really good. We're expecting great numbers, with a lot of interest and tremendous talent within the teams‚Äînot just the international players but also the UAE players. Additionally, I think the associate players will add great value. We have players from Nepal, Malaysia, Namibia, Scotland, and the Netherlands, offering a fantastic array of talent.I think what's unique about the UAE is, firstly, the fantastic facilities, including three world-class stadiums. We're here at the Dubai Stadium now, which is truly top-notch. The weather is great, and the conditions are excellent for cricket, with good wickets and practice facilities. Another unique aspect is that players don't need to travel by plane. They're all based within a compact area and travel by bus, which allows them to bring their families along. Additionally, having nine overseas players in each team makes this league exceptionally strong.What a player! I've known Tim for many, many years. He's not only a fantastic cricketer but also a wonderful person. He'll be a great leader too, and it's fantastic to have him here.You'd need to talk to the BCCI about that (laughs). We know Indian players don't participate in leagues around the world, and that's just how it is. Indian cricket has contributed a lot to the global game, and the IPL, along with the advent of T20s, has been transformative. But yes, for retired Indian players in the future‚Äîwhy not? If they're still fit and able, I'm sure the franchise teams would be interested in them.","Former New Zealand batter David White now holds the position of CEO for the ILT20.

Former South African cricketer Jonty Rhodes has defended Indian batsmen Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma after their performance in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. India lost the series 1-3 to Australia.Kohli and Sharma faced criticism for their contributions with the bat. Rhodes suggests that Indian fans might have become accustomed to the team's recent success in Australia. He emphasizes the difficulty of playing in Australian conditions.‚ÄúEverybody's entitled to their opinion. Cricket is that kind of game and I think the cricket players themselves in this day and age, there is no escape from the public, whether it's fans who love them or fans who are criticizing them with social media, journalism these days. Everybody seems to be a cricketing expert and players learn to live with that,‚Äù Rhodes told IANS.Rhodes believes that blaming just two players for the series loss is unfair. He acknowledges India‚Äôs previous successes in Australia but reminds fans that those victories were hard-fought. He indicates that this time, the team couldn't replicate those performances.‚ÄúTouring Australia is really tough. And I think maybe the Indian fans have forgotten that because India have been so successful in the past in their last two tours to Australia. But it wasn't easy. You know, some great performances by the team almost resurrected the previous tours. And it didn't quite happen this time around so to lay the blame at the feet of two people is harsh.‚ÄùKohli started the series strongly with a century in the first Test in Perth. However, his form declined, resulting in a total of 190 runs for the series. He was frequently dismissed while chasing deliveries outside off-stump.Rohit Sharma missed the Perth Test due to the birth of his second child. He managed only 31 runs in the three Tests he played. He chose to sit out the final Test in Sydney.Both Kohli and Sharma will be under scrutiny during the 2025 Champions Trophy in February. The tournament will follow a hybrid model after India refused to travel to Pakistan Rhodes declined to comment on the political aspects surrounding the tournament‚Äôs arrangements. He expressed his happiness as a fan that India and Pakistan will participate in the Champions Trophy. He believes that missing such a contest would be a loss for all cricket fans.‚ÄúFortunately I'm not really involved in the politics of cricket. I'm a big fan of the game and I'm just happy that India are going to be playing Pakistan in this Champions Trophy. Because that sort of game, if it's not taking place, we all as fans lose out a great deal.‚ÄùRhodes also praised Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi ‚Äôs presence at the Viksit Bharat Young Leaders Dialogue and National Youth Festival.

Real Madrid's coach, Carlo Ancelotti, believes his team can avenge their previous defeat against Barcelona in the Spanish Super Cup final on Sunday. He emphasized the importance of learning from past mistakes to secure a victory.Barcelona had convincingly defeated Real Madrid 4-0 at the Santiago Bernabeu in La Liga earlier in the season. However, Real Madrid managed to surpass them in the league standings before the winter break.‚ÄúWe have to think about that game obviously, they beat us, we had a clear evaluation of what happened.‚ÄùAncelotti acknowledged the significance of the previous encounter and the need to analyze their performance. He stressed the importance of replicating the positive aspects of their play while avoiding past errors.‚ÄúWe started the game well, then had problems in the second half, so we have to try and repeat the good things we did and avoid the mistakes we made.‚ÄùThe added pressure of a final against their rivals adds another layer of complexity to the upcoming match. Ancelotti acknowledged the unique nature of Clasico finals.‚ÄúThe Clasico is even more pressured when it's a final, we've played a lot against Barcelona and playing a final against them is always something special.‚ÄùReal Madrid's challenge lies in finding a balance between their attacking prowess and defensive solidity, especially after Kylian Mbappe 's arrival. The attacking quartet of Mbappe, Vinicius Junior, Jude Bellingham, and Rodrygo Goes offers significant offensive firepower. However, their defensive contributions are crucial for team balance.‚Äú(In recent Clasicos) individual quality has prevailed over team balance.‚ÄùAncelotti highlighted the importance of collective effort and defensive stability in such high-stakes matches.‚ÄúAn important aspect tomorrow will be balance and collective work -- defending.‚ÄùHe firmly believes that a strong defensive performance increases their chances of winning.‚ÄúIf you defend well, there's more chance of winning.‚ÄùDespite a successful 2024 season with La Liga and Champions League titles, Ancelotti admitted that the heavy defeat against Barcelona remained a low point.‚ÄúWe're close to another trophy, we're thinking positively, but we know that in football anything can happen, above all when the opponent is strong and competes well like Barcelona.‚ÄùAncelotti acknowledged the unpredictable nature of football, particularly against a strong opponent like Barcelona. He also highlighted Real Madrid's progress and improvement as a team.‚ÄúOur team has improved, nobody can argue with that.‚ÄùHe expressed confidence in their continued progress regardless of the outcome of the Super Cup final.‚ÄúA defeat wouldn't be good but the team is not going backwards, it will keep moving forwards.‚ÄùDani Olmo's availability for Barcelona after a controversial temporary license approval by the Spanish national sports council (CSD) presents a challenge for Real Madrid.‚ÄúOlmo will play and we have to minimise his quality.‚ÄùAncelotti chose to focus on minimizing Olmo's impact on the game rather than commenting on the controversy surrounding his eligibility.Barcelona coach Hansi Flick confirmed Olmo's readiness to play but hinted at a possible starting role for Gavi.‚ÄúGavi had a great performance against Athletic, he's got confidence... I think he's is going to play, but I am not 100 percent sure of who will play.‚ÄùThe Super Cup final represents Flick's first opportunity to win a trophy with Barcelona. He acknowledged the importance of a victory for the team's confidence.‚ÄúIf we win, we will have more confidence for the rest of the season.‚ÄùHe further emphasized the significance of winning the game for everyone involved.‚ÄúWinning the game would be something really big for everyone.‚Äù",Real Madrid face Barcelona in the Spanish Super Cup final on Sunday.

Aston Villa came from behind to end Graham Potter 's debut as West Ham United manager on a losing note in the FA Cup on Friday.West Ham squandered a 1-0 lead to concede twice and lose 1-2 in the third round of the tournament .Potter was appointed as Julen Lopetegui's successor just a day before the match, as West Ham couldn't build on the early advantage after Lucas Paqueta's strike.In bitter cold conditions, Unai Emery's squad demonstrated their resilience with a commanding second-half performance that highlighted West Ham's defensive weaknesses. Amadou Onana drew Villa level before Morgan Rogers struck the decisive goal, leaving Potter visibly dejected.The defeat marked Potter's return to management following his departure from Chelsea in April 2023. His tenure at Stamford Bridge had been brief and challenging, with 11 defeats in 31 matches and a disappointing 11th-place position in the Premier League.With merely one training session before travelling to Villa and the absence of crucial strikers Jarrod Bowen and Michail Antonio, Potter faced significant challenges.Despite these limitations, the attacking display from West Ham showed promise, though addressing their defensive vulnerabilities remains the primary concern.Lopetegui struggled to maintain the robust framework established by David Moyes, who secured the Europa Conference League in 2023 before departing at the season's conclusion.Potter demonstrated his ability to address these tactical concerns as West Ham displayed impressive attacking prowess against Villa in the first half.Paqueta nearly provided Potter with an ideal beginning when the Brazilian's attempt from the area's periphery narrowly missed the target.It was a warning Villa failed to heed as Paqueta opened the scoring in the ninth minute.Summerville displayed his skill by outmanoeuvring Villa's Maatsen during a decisive run into the box, before delivering a precise pass to Paqueta, who finished expertly past Olsen.The new manager's jubilant celebration was short-lived, as German forward Fullkrug had to leave the pitch with an injury shortly after the goal.Continuing his impressive performance, Paqueta tested Olsen again following another penetrating attack.Villa's persistence after the interval paid off in the 71st minute. A corner kick saw Mings direct the ball towards Maatsen, whose shot was parried by Fabianski into Onana's path, allowing him to score from close range.Villa, sensing an opportunity, pressed forward in the 76th minute. Watkins advanced into West Ham's penalty area and set up Rogers, who finished precisely into the bottom corner.",West Ham squandered a 1-0 lead to concede twice and lose 1-2 in the third round of the tournament.

NEW DELHI: Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta on Friday acknowledged the difficulty of securing impactful January signings to bolster their trophy ambitions as they aim to break a five-year drought.Recent performances, including a 2-0 League Cup semi-final loss to Newcastle and a 1-1 draw against Brighton, highlighted Arsenal's attacking deficiencies.The results have impacted their Premier League title hopes.Winger Bukayo Saka's hamstring injury, requiring surgery and sidelining him until March, further complicates Arteta's attacking options.Arsenal currently trail Premier League leaders Liverpool by six points, with the Reds having a game in hand. However, Arsenal remain well-positioned for Champions League knockout stage progression.Arteta dismissed the notion that simply adding more forwards in January is the solution. He emphasized the importance of acquiring players who can immediately enhance the team's performance.""Bringing in bodies doesn't help us all,"" said Arteta ahead of Sunday's FA Cup third round tie against Manchester United.""It's just about somebody who can immediately impact our performance and can bring something that we don't have. To find that in this market is very difficult to achieve.""The circumstances (can) change because we have certain injuries for some big players, so it's always a possibility but always it's about somebody that is really going to make us much better.""Arteta's post-Newcastle defeat comments about the match ball being ""tricky"" and ""flying differently"" compared to Premier League balls drew widespread ridicule.Arteta clarified that his remarks were not intended as an excuse for Arsenal's missed chances.""It's not an excuse, it's a reality,"" added Arteta. ""Every pitch is different, the weather conditions are changing in football, that's the beauty of it.""That's it, we adapt to that, and I never use it as an excuse.""","Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta acknowledges difficulty of securing impactful January signings.

Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca has announced that Ben Chilwell 's difficult period at Stamford Bridge is approaching its conclusion, with the England defender seeking a transfer during the January window.On Friday, Maresca confirmed that the injury-prone Chilwell would be permitted to depart if suitable terms are agreed in January.The left-back will be absent from Chelsea's FA Cup third round match against Morecambe on Saturday, as Maresca aims to protect the player's prospects of securing a new club.The 28-year-old, having played merely 45 minutes this season, is reportedly considering a move to West Ham, where former Chelsea boss Graham Potter has recently taken charge.Since his arrival from Leicester in 2020, Chilwell has accumulated over 100 appearances for Chelsea, securing a Champions League victory in his inaugural season.However, he has remained unused since Maresca's appointment during the pre-season, with Marc Cucurella being the preferred choice at left-back.Cesare Casadei and Carney Chukwuemeka are also expected to depart and won't participate against League Two outfit Morecambe.""Chilwell is thinking he's going to leave, it's better to avoid using him to avoid injury,"" Maresca told reporters.""Cesare will not be in the squad, same situation as Chilwell. It's best in this moment not to allow him to play in case there's opportunity for him to leave.""Despite limited appearances, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, who followed Maresca from Leicester, maintains a position in the club's future plans, according to the manager.Maresca remained non-committal regarding speculation about potential defensive reinforcements from Crystal Palace.Marc Guehi, a Chelsea academy graduate who impressed with England at Euro 2024, is reportedly of interest, whilst recalling Trevoh Chalobah from his Selhurst Park loan remains an option.With Wesley Fofana potentially missing the remainder of the season and Benoit Badiashile sidelined until February, defensive options are limited.""Guehi is a Palace player. I like him, for sure, but he's not our player,"" Maresca said.""I like the central defenders we have, I like different defenders in Italy and France but it does not mean we're going to buy them. When you have an injury the speculation is there.""Trev is a good player but a Palace player.""",Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca confirms that Ben Chilwell will be allowed to leave the club in the January transfer window.

""Like any player that is coming out of contract in the summer, with every player that I've ever worked with, there's always that feeling of doubt.""He will naturally want some conclusion to his future, whether that's a new contract with us, whatever the outcome. But he's certainly played very well and I've been really pleased with him.""Dubravka's emotional response after Tuesday's Arsenal match, where he appeared tearful, led to speculation about his departure. Since joining Newcastle under Rafael Benitez in January 2018, he has primarily served as backup to Nick Pope, including a stint at Manchester United Regarding Sunday's FA Cup fixture against Bromley, Howe acknowledged Dubravka's connection to the club: ""I know how much Newcastle means to him and you can see that emotionally, he's very invested.""Reports suggest Newcastle's interest in Burnley's England under-21 keeper James Trafford as a potential replacement.When questioned about Pope's position as first-choice goalkeeper, Howe remained non-committal, stating: ""It's always in a state of flux. It's always changing and moving because that's down to the player's performances.""",Newcastle goalkeeper Martin Dubravka's contract expires in six months. The 35-year-old Slovak has been in superb form for the Magpies. Newcastle boss Eddie Howe remains optimistic about keeping him at St James' Park.

Rithvik looks forward to maiden Slam and more in 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/rithvik-looks-forward-to-maiden-slam-and-more-in-2025/articleshow/117163910.cms,"Rithvik Choudary Bollipalli is looking forward to the 2025 season with a mix of excitement and nervous energy.The 23-year-old, who began to focus on doubles from the word go, will be making his slam debut at the Australian Open with American Ryan Seggerman as partner.Rithvik is hoping to build on a successful 2024 in which he lifted his first ATP doubles title with Arjun Kadhe in Almaty in October and also won three Challengers with Niki Poonacha (2) and Sriram Balaji.""Looking back at 2024, it's just amazing, especially the second half of the season, because Arjun and I had been doing very well, just getting solid performances overall in all the matches that we played and heading in the right direction. And the most special one was obviously winning the 250 (in Almaty). So, yeah, it's been a great year,"" Rithvik said.If the maiden appearance in a major is a cause for celebration, the optimism is tinged with a bit of caution as he is yet to find a long-term partner. He has tied up with Seggerman only for the Melbourne fortnight.The Hyderabadi was supposed to be in Melbourne Park in tandem with Kadhe, but those plans came to a nought after the latter injured his knee during the Bratislava Challenger and was rendered out of action for at least three months.Rithvik played with Dutch veteran Robin Haase in the season opener in Brisbane and the duo lost in the second round.""Yeah, it's just really, really unlucky for us and especially Arjun for that to happen right after the 250 (Series event) and the way we were playing. It is just very unfortunate. It definitely did affect me as well, because I still don't have a partner,"" Rithvik, who broke into the top-10 with a year-end ranking of 72, said.""I'm glad I got in (to the AO), but it's really different for me to play with different partners in different weeks, because I'm not used to that. So, it's definitely a challenge, and I hope Arjun gets (back) soon on court, recovers pretty well.""A back injury early in his career meant Rithvik chose to play doubles full-time right after college - University of South Florida in the US.He believes breaking into the top-100 is a stepping stone to bigger things ahead.""It's really satisfying to be in the top-100 and climbing up the rankings. But I think it's part of the process for me, and I did believe that this could happen,"" he said.""So I'm definitely happy it's happened, but I'm also hungry for what's coming up, because it's getting exciting playing against higher ranked opponents. Yeah, looking forward to what's coming up, trying to stay healthy and be fit to be able to compete at the highest level.""Rithvik said combining with Haase has been a learning experience for more than one reason.""Playing with Robin was obviously super exciting. It was completely new for me to play with a singles player, because I haven't really done that (until now),"" he said after their outing in Brisbane where the pair lost in the second round.""I mean, he's obviously playing doubles, but he was top-35 in the world in singles and been a top singles player for a very long time. So it was really interesting and really fun to play with him.""I definitely learned quite a lot from Robin. We had a lot of conversations off the court. It was interesting, because he's been on the tour for a very long time, and he shared a couple of experiences, which were super awesome to hear and learn from as well.""He's very open, very friendly, so it was fun time playing with him on court.""Rithvik will have one more first after the Australian Open when he plays in the Davis Cup tie against Togo in New Delhi.""It is a dream for everyone to play in the Davis Cup team. I did play in the junior Davis Cup team, which felt unbelievable when I got selected. But, this one feels better for sure,"" he said.""I'm really excited to be playing alongside Mukund (Sasikumar), Ram (Ramkumar Ramanathan), Karan (Singh) and Bala (Sriram Balaji).""Mukund and I, we've known each other for so many years, and as soon as we got the news, he texted me saying he was very happy for me because we've done this.""We've been doing fitness sessions and stuff when we were very young, and from that to being on the same team representing India is super cool.""",Rithvik Choudary Bollipalli is looking forward to the 2025 season. The 23-year- old will be making his slam debut at the Australian Open.
