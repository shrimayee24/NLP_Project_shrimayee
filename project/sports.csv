After leading India to victory in the T20 World Cup earlier this year, Rohit Sharma decided to quit the format in the international arena, while many felt he is still fit enough to play both the white-ball formats besides Test cricket .India defeated South Africa in a thrilling final to become the T20 world champions once again in June this year. Soon after the triumph in Barbados, both Rohit and Virat Kohli announced their retirement from T20Is .In a recent podcast, Rohit, who was also part of MS Dhoni's team that won the inaugural T20 World Cup in 2007, shed light on the reasons why he felt it was time for him to bid T20Is adieu.'The only reason I retired from T20Is is because I have had my time, I enjoyed playing the format, I played for 17 years, I did well and all of that,"" said Rohit. ""Then, you won the (2024) World Cup. This was the best time for me to decide that 'okay, this is now time for me to move on and look after the other things'. There are a lot of good players who can do well for India.""""It (decision to quit T20Is) was not because I felt anything. I just felt this was the right time. I could still play all three formats easily. That's why I say fitness is in your mind, how you train your mind.""""I believe everything is in the mind. I am a person who has got a lot of self-belief because I know that I can control my mind when I have to. Sometimes it's not easy. I know most of the time I can do that. If you tell your body that you are young, you can do this, you can do that, (then) of course you can,"" Rohit added.Rohit played 159 T20Is and ended up with 4231 runs at an average of 31.34 and strike rate of 140.89, including 5 hundreds and 32 fifties.After Rohit quit T20Is, the BCCI appointed Suryakumar Yadav in the role.",Rohit played 159 T20Is and ended up with 4231 runs at an average of 31.34 and strike rate of 140.89.

India vs Australia: Can Akash Deep make the difference Down Under?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/india-vs-australia-can-akash-deep-make-the-difference-down-under/articleshow/113778037.cms,"PROMISING START: Akash Deep has been impressive against both England and Bangladesh.

With uncertainty over

's fitness, selectors need to zero in on pace slots for all-important 5-Test tour of Australia

KANPUR: Akash Deep is only into his third Test match but he has managed to bring assurance and calm to the proceedings. These are anxious times for the Indian team management and the selectors as they wait for veteran pacer Mohammed Shami to get back to competitive cricket after a yearlong absence due to his Achilles tendon injury.With another three home Tests to go before India embark on the five-Test tour of Australia in Nov, the pace attack is still quite a distance from being formalized.It was in Australia four years ago that India declared themselves as one of the superpowers in fast bowling as they unleashed all of their resources. This time, India are again in rebuilding mode.Unlike the scenario five years ago when there were four fast bowlers in Ishant Sharma Jasprit Bumrah , Mohammed Shami and Umesh Yadav who would pick themselves - with Mohammed Siraj waiting in the wings - the team management has to first zero in on its first three pacers keeping the uncertainty around Shami in mind.India's previous bowling coach Paras Mhambrey feels Akash fits the bill. He has seen Akash's impressive debut against England at home earlier this year.""Akash has done a lot of bowling in domestic cricket. He understands what needs to be done. He also relies a lot on seam movement. You need that kind of bowler in Australia who can nip it around off the seam,"" Mhambrey told TOI.The selectors' challenge will be to pick five pacers for the Australia tour. Workload management is expected to be in full swing. Even if Shami gets fit, there needs to be one more pacer besides Bumrah , Siraj and Akash. ""We are lucky to have someone like Bumrah who loves to play Test cricket. But Bumrah and Shami need to be rested in the middle of a long series. That's when the strategic selection comes into play,"" Mhambrey said.The team management and the selectors are keen on having a left-arm option, it is learnt. Yash Dayal is already with the team in the ongoing Test series against Bangladesh. Khaleel Ahmed and Arshdeep Singh are the other two con tenders. Dayal, at the moment, seems to be ahead in the race.""With Ashwin in the team and hopefully Kuldeep Yadav, a left-armer could be a strategic pick to create rough outside the off-stump. I feel Arshdeep maybe needs a bit more time to grow with the red ball but Dayal looks as someone who could hit the deck,"" feels Mhambrey.""First things first, you need bowlers who can hit the deck hard and derive seam movement in Australia. The Kookaburra balls are best to bowl within the first 30 overs. After that the conditions become very flat. That's where someone like Prasidh Krishna could come in handy. Like Akash, Krishna is also tall and can extract more out of the surface. Our team management had invested heavily,"" he added.Here's the catch. The ones who engineered the dramatic win in the last Australia tour were groomed thoroughly by Rahul Dravid and Mhambrey at NCA through a rigorous India 'A' programme. Familiarity with the Kookaburra ball in overseas conditions wasn't a problem for the fresh faces who had come into the team five years ago even when Ishant, Shami and Umesh weren't available.""It's true that we used up all the resources we had created at NCA. But these boys are given Kookaburra balls in India itself to get used to before going on a tour. Akash Deep has done so much bowling over the last five-six years that his body is ready to go through that kind of grind. Krishna has a bit of experience of bowling with these balls since he was a big part of our programme,"" Mhambrey opined.""Even if either of Bumrah and Shami is unavailable, you don't need to speak a lot to these boys to boost their confidence to lead an attack because of the number of overs they bowled to get to this level,"" he added.The next three Tests against New Zealand and Shami's possible return in domestic cricket next month should offer some clarity on how well our pace resources are placed for the Australia tour.",Akash Deep has been impressive in his first two Test matches for India. India are in rebuilding mode ahead of 5-Test tour of Australia in November. India's previous bowling coach Paras Mhambrey feels Akash fits the bill.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113778033,imgsize-31946,width-400,resizemode-4/113778033.jpg"

The new Indian Premier League (IPL) Player Regulations for the period 2025-27 were announced by the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) on Saturday after a meeting of the IPL Governing Council (GC), and the mention of ""will get banned"" in the press release draws attention.Called the 'Big Auction', the regulations require all overseas players to register for it. In case a foreign player doesn't do that, ""then he will be ineligible to register in the following year's player auction.""But in the next instruction on the eight-point list of the regulations, the BCCI cautioned players who decide to register themselves, get picked by a franchise and then opt out of the season.""Any player who registers in the player auction and after getting picked at the auction makes himself unavailable before the start of the season, will get banned from participating in the tournament and player auction for 2 Seasons.""The 'Big Auction' is expected to be held in the second half of November at an overseas location, most likely in the Gulf.Among the most awaited part of the regulations was the number of players a franchise will be allowed to retain.The IPL GC ended that wait by declaring that ""the IPL franchises can retain a total of 6 players from their existing squad. This can be either via retention or by using the Right to Match (RTM) option.""The press release further stated, ""It is at the discretion of the IPL franchise to choose their combination for Retentions and RTMs. The 6 retentions / RTM's can have a maximum of 5 capped players (Indian & Overseas) and a maximum of 2 uncapped players.""The regulations made it clear that a capped Indian player will be considered uncapped ""if the player has in the last five calendar years preceding the year in which the relevant Season is held, not played in the starting XI in International Cricket (Test match, ODI, Twenty20 International) or does not have a Central Contract with BCCI.""","The new Indian Premier League (IPL) Player Regulations for the period 2025-27 were announced by the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) on Saturday.

Each franchise to have purse of Rs 120 crore; Impact rule to stay

'Uncapped'

can be retained

New stringent availability rules

Landmark match fee introduced

BENGALURU: Ahead of the mega auction in Nov, the IPL governing council has decided that the 10 franchises can retain a maximum of six cricketers. Also, the Right to Match (RTM) card, which was done away with before the 2022 mega auction, has been brought back.""It is at the discretion of the IPL franchise to choose their combination for retentions and RTMs.The six retentions/RTM's can have a maximum of 5 capped players (Indian and overseas) and a maximum of 2 uncapped players,"" the IPL said in statement announcing the big changes.Interestingly, the IPL GC, which met here on Saturday, has also come up with a rider which is a 'pay more to retain more' formula, wherein the price for the fourth and fifth retentions come at a higher cost. With each team having an increased auction purse of Rs 120 crore each, there will be a reduction of Rs 18 crore, 14 crore and 11 crore respectively for the first three retentions.The subsequent fourth and fifth retentions will see the franchise purse getting lighter by Rs 18 crore and 14 crore. Effectively, five retentions will come at a cost of Rs 75 crore, leaving the franchise with Rs 45 crore to complete the line-up.The price for the uncapped player has been pegged at Rs 4 crore, which further reduces a franchise's purse. Also, for the subsequent seasons the purse has been increased to Rs 151 crore (2026) and Rs 157 crore (2027).In another key decision, the GC has decided to retain the Impact Player rule . The same will continue for the 2025-27 cycle. Chennai Super Kings can retain their former captain MS Dhoni as an 'uncapped' player because an old rule first introduced in 2008 and scrapped in 2021 has been brought back: Indian players who have been retired from international cricket for a period of at least five years can go into the auction pool as an 'uncapped' player.Dhoni, for example, retired from international cricket in 2020 and can be retained for Rs 4 crore. CSK had shelled out Rs 12 crore to retain him ahead of the 2022 auction.The GC has laid down rules for players registering for the auction, bringing in some strict regulations. ""Any player who registers in the player auction and after getting picked at the auction, makes himself unavailable before the start of the season, will get banned from participating in the tournament and player auction for two seasons,"" the IPL said.There have been plenty of instances of players pulling out after being picked in the auction, especially England and Australia players, and this rule may prevent such late withdrawals.In an important step, players featuring in IPL-2025 are set to receive a match fee of Rs 7.5 lakh per game. This is apart from the auction fee they earn from their respective franchisees, BCCI secretary Jay Shah posted on X. Effectively, if a player features in all league matches, he will get an additional sum of Rs 1.05 crore.

NEW DELHI: Virender Sehwag 's 309 in Multan, often referred to as the ""Sultan of Multan"" innings, is one of the most iconic knocks in the history of Indian cricket . It took place during India's 2004 tour of Pakistan in the first Test at Multan.Sehwag became the first Indian to score a triple century in Test cricket , achieving the feat in just 364 balls.Sehwag had a 336-run stand with his idol batting legend Sachin Tendulkar for the third wicket.Sehwag has more than once shared numerous anecdotes about his time with Tendulkar on the field, in the dressing room, during team dinners, and while traveling.And in a video that is viral on the internet, Sehwag narrated an interesting incident during his partnership with Tendulkar when he was warned against hitting a six.Sehwag says in the video, ""When he (Tendulkar) came to bat after the dismissal of Rahul Dravid , I was on 120, and just after his arrival I hit Saqlain Mushtaq for a six, the ball just went over the long-on fielder who tried for a catch but he could not take it. Master came with his bat and said 'ab agar tune chakka maara na toh main tere bat maarunga kheench ke'.""Sehwag continues, ""When I reached 295, I said if Saqlain Mushtaq comes in the attack, I will step out first ball and hit a six. He (Tendulkar) said are you mad? You'll become the first Indian player to hit 300. I replied no Indian has ever hit 295 even, I have become the first Indian. He walked back saying you are mad. Saqlain came, I stepped out and hit a six to reach 300 and Tendulkar was happier than me.""Sehwag's knock helped India post a massive total of 675/5 declared in the first innings, leading India to win by an innings and 52 runs.This innings is remembered not only for its historical significance but also for the aggressive and fearless manner in which Sehwag played against a strong Pakistani bowling attack that included Shoaib Akhtar , Mohammad Sami, and Saqlain Mushtaq.Though both Tendulkar and Sehwag were batting legends with different styles, their camaraderie and mutual respect on and off the field created a unique partnership that benefited the Indian team for many years.Their camaraderie extends off the field as well. Their bond, despite differences in personalities (Tendulkar being calm and composed, Sehwag more carefree and humorous), has always remained strong.The Tendulkar-Sehwag friendship stands as a testament to the spirit of Indian cricket during their playing days and continues to be celebrated even after both have retired from the game.",Virender Sehwag became the first Indian to score a triple century in Test cricket.

Even with multiple covers, substantial parts of the field were left uncovered.With some rain expected on Saturday night and early Sunday morning, it will be a huge task for the groundstaff to get the ground ready for the match to resume on time even on Day Three.",Day Two of the second Test between India and Bangladesh was called off without a ball being bowled due to overnight and early morning rain.

IPL GC meeting: Impact Player rule to continue,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/ipl-gc-meeting-impact-player-rule-to-continue/articleshow/113771812.cms,"The following decisions were taken in the IPL Governing Council meeting:

BENGALURU: The IPL Governing Council which was convened on Saturday decided to continue with the hotly-debated Impact Player rule for the IPL 2025 season. The Impact Sub was introduced during the IPL 2023 and since then the rule has vertically divided opinion.Even in the meeting the BCCI had with the team owners earlier this July, some franchises like Delhi Capitals were not entirely in favour of retaining the Impact Player rule, primarily because it reduced the importance of the all-rounders.In fact, the nine highest totals in the IPL were made since the introduction of the Impact Player rule and the team often effortlessly crossed 220s and even 250s in the IPL 2024.""We had a chat with the franchise owners recently. The impact player rule has its pros and cons. The negative is that it makes the allrounder's role redundant. The positive is that it creates a spot for an Indian player to showcase his talent,"" BCCI secretary Jay Shah had said recently.The Impact Player rule allows a team to replace a player from the starting eleven and bring in a specialist batsman or bowler as per the match situation.The IPL franchises can retain a total of 6 players from their existing squad. This can be either via retention or by using the Right to Match (RTM) option.It is at the discretion of the IPL franchise to choose their combination for Retentions and RTMs. The 6 retentions / RTM's can have a maximum of 5 capped players (Indian & Overseas) and a maximum of 2 uncapped players.The auction purse for the franchises has been set at INR 120 Crore for IPL 2025. The total salary cap will now consist of auction purse, incremental performance pay and match fees. Previously in 2024, the total salary cap (auction purse + incremental performance pay) was Rs. 110 Crs which will now be Rs. 146 Crs (2025), Rs. 151 Crs (2026) and Rs. 157 Crs (2027).A match fee has been introduced for the first time in the history of IPL. Each Playing member (Including the Impact Player) will get a match fee of INR 7.5 Lakhs per match. This will be in addition to his contracted amount.Any Overseas Player will have to register for the Big Auction. In case the overseas player doesn't register, then he will be ineligible to register in the following year‚Äôs player auction.Any player who registers in the player auction and after getting picked at the auction, makes himself unavailable before the start of the season, will get banned from participating in the tournament and player auction for 2 Seasons.A capped Indian player will become uncapped, if the player has in the last five calendar years preceding the year in which the relevant Season is held, not played in the starting XI in International Cricket (Test match, ODI, Twenty20 International) or does not have a Central Contract with BCCI. This will be applicable for Indian Players only.The Impact Player Regulation will continue for the 2025 to 2027 cycle.",The IPL Governing Council decided to continue with the Impact Player rule.

NEW DELHI: Mayank Yadav 's journey from the alleys of Delhi to his maiden India call-up is the stuff of dreams. A fast bowler , who clocks in speeds that send batters ducking for cover, Mayank is now set to don the Indian jersey for the first time in the upcoming T20I series against Bangladesh, beginning October 6.Known for his blistering pace, Mayank caught the world's attention when he made debut for Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) in the IPL 2024.In that unforgettable match against Punjab Kings, Mayank‚Äôs fiery deliveries wreaked havoc in such a manner that opponent skipper Dhawan was forced to uplift the excellence.‚ÄúWe started off well, but Mayank bowled well with his pace. It was nice facing him, I was surprised at his pace,"" Dhawan said after the match.The numbers speak for themselves - figures of 3/27 in his four overs and a reputation for unsettling even the most seasoned batters.His impact was felt not just by the crowd, but also by the likes of fast-bowling legend Brett Lee, who hailed him as ""India's fastest bowler.""His flamboyant bowling, backed by smooth action, continued to inspire in the match against Royal Challengers Bengaluru as he swept Australia international Cameron Green aside with a delivery clocking 156.7 kph.But behind the raw speed is a story of perseverance. Injuries sidelined Mayank for much of his young career, including the latter part of IPL 2024.Despite this setback, his talent has led to a focused rehabilitation program, with the youngster bowling 14-15 overs per day at the NCA.The upcoming Bangladesh series offers a valuable chance for the national selectors to assess his international readiness in a limited bowling capacity, before potentially introducing him to longer formats like the Ranji Trophy.From being the kid in New Delhi's Motinagar who rattled batters with head-high deliveries, to now being hailed as India‚Äôs new pace sensation, Mayank‚Äôs ascent has been both thrilling and inspirational.The 22-year-old has had notable mentors like the late Tarak Sinha, who also coached Rishabh Pant Despite not having played U-14 or U-16 cricket , his rise in Delhi‚Äôs cricketing circles was meteoric.

Martinez strikes for Inter

Dusan Vlahovic fired Juventus top of Serie A with a brace in Saturday's 3-0 win at Genoa who were forced to play behind closed doors as punishment for fan disorder in their midweek Italian Cup defeat to local rivals Sampdoria.Juventus are a point ahead of Torino, AC Milan and Inter Milan , who were 3-2 winners at Udinese earlier on Saturday, after Vlahovic settled a match played in an atmosphere that harked back to the Covid-19 pandemic.The Serbia striker has struggled for form in the early weeks of the season, only netting in one of his previous six Juventus appearances.But he opened the scoring from the penalty spot two minutes after half-time before rifling home from Teun Koopmeiners' fine pass in the 55th minute.""People talk, say that you're the best when you score goals and a flop when you don't. I do my talking on the pitch,"" said Vlahovic to DAZN.""I know very well that there is a lot expected of me and I am not running away from that.""Thiago Motta's team, who also scored in the final minutes through substitute Francisco Conceicao, are yet to concede a league goal this season and snapped a run of three consecutive goalless draws in Serie A with a professional display.Juve could have won by more as Koopmeiners somehow failed to push home Conceicao's low cross in the 64th minute, hitting the crossbar from inside the six-yard box.The away side's task was made easier with Genoa's passionate support shut out of the Stadio Luigi Ferraris in the aftermath of the encounter with their second-tier neighbours Sampdoria.Prolonged clashes between the hardcore ultras before and after Wednesday's fraught derby cup tie led to dozens of injuries to fans and police and a crackdown by Italy's security authorities.A third defeat of the season left Genoa in 16th place and one point above the relegation zone.Lautaro Martinez struck his first goals of the season in Inter's entertaining win at Udinese.Davide Frattesi's deft finish after just 43 seconds was followed by Argentina forward Martinez's strikes moments before and after half-time.The win in Udine helped Inter bounce back from Milan derby defeat last weekend and move up to fourth, on 11 points after six matches.""After the derby we kept quiet and worked hard and I think you saw that on the pitch,"" said Martinez to DAZN.Martinez's brace will be great news for coach Simone Inzaghi whose team host Red Star Belgrade in the Champions League on Tuesday night.Before Saturday, last season's Serie A top scorer had not scored since netting the winner for his country in the Copa America final in July.""It definitely important for me because a striker is always on the hunt for goals,"" he said.""I always say that first I work for the team, and if I manage to score then so much the better.""Lazar Samardzic snatched a late 1-1 draw at 10-man Bologna with a brilliant 90th-minute leveller ahead of their Champions League trip to Shakhtar Donetsk.Midfielder Samardzic rammed home his equaliser seconds after striking the post, saving a point after playing with an extra man for almost all of the second half following Jhon Lucumi's 51st minute sending off.Atalanta are ninth and level on seven points with Bologna, who face a daunting Champions League trip to Anfield to take on Liverpool on Wednesday.",Dusan Vlahovic scores twice as Juventus beat Genoa 3-0 in Serie A.

Reinforcements

Osasuna shattered La Liga leaders Barcelona 's perfect start to the season with an emphatic 4-2 victory on Saturday.The Catalans won all seven of their opening fixtures but Hansi Flick's rotated side came badly undone in Pamplona as Ante Budimir scored a brace either side of Bryan Zaragoza's strike.Pau Victor had given Barca a lifeline to pull them back into the game before Budimir bagged his second from the penalty spot.Abel Bretones added a sensational fourth from the edge of the box, before Lamine Yamal pulled one back with a fine effort of his own.Victory would have matched Barcelona's best ever start to a league campaign with eight consecutive wins, but they were not able to build on their four-point lead on second-place Real Madrid.The Spanish champions visit Atletico Madrid, third, in a derby clash on Sunday.""It's normal there are rotations, there are a lot of games, it's not an excuse,"" Barcelona midfielder Pedri told Movistar.""In the second half we deserved a bit more but we let in goals when we were at our best.""Ahead of a Champions League match against Young Boys on Tuesday, Flick shuffled his pack.The coach handed starts to defenders Gerard Martin and Sergi Dominguez as well as Pablo Torre in midfield and Victor in attack.The coach rested Spain Euro 2024 starlet Yamal and Brazilian winger Raphinha among other regular picks.As a result Barcelona failed to ignite in the first half and Osasuna winger Zaragoza took centre-stage.Last season Zaragoza struck twice while playing for Granada in a 2-2 draw against Barca, a performance which helped earn him a move to Bayern Munich.On loan from the German giants, Zaragoza created the opener for target-man Budimir with a fine cross, which the Croatian nodded home with ease in the 18th minute after escaping the attentions of Dominguez.Zaragoza finished the second himself 10 minutes later after being sent through on goal, with the winger bypassing goalkeeper Inaki Pena with a fine ball roll and then slotting into the empty net.Barcelona complained there had been a foul on Victor in the build-up but the referee waved their complaints away.The leaders created little themselves, with the best opening falling to Ferran Torres. However the Spanish winger miscontrolled on the edge of the box and was quickly swallowed up by the Osasuna defence.Yamal, Raphinha and Ansu Fati warmed up at half-time, with Barcelona needing to turn to their stars to mount a comeback.Before Flick had time to send them on, Victor pulled Barcelona back into the game.Osasuna goalkeeper Sergio Herrera gave the ball away with a poor throw, intercepted by Martin, who fed Victor.The forward took an early shot from distance which Herrera, who slipped as he made it back to his goal, should have kept out but could not.Flick took off top scorer Robert Lewandowski, largely uninvolved, with 20 minutes remaining and moved Torres into the middle to fill the gap.However Osasuna almost immediately stretched their lead when 19-year-old centre-back Dominguez scythed down Budimir in the area as he went to shoot.The striker buried the penalty with a low effort hit hard enough to beat Pena although he dived the right way.Ruben Pena wasted a glorious chance to grab a fourth as he ran in on goal but was caught in two minds whether to pass or shoot, and Eric Garcia charged back to dispossess him as he dawdled.Bretones, on the other hand, was lethal from the edge of the box when he won the ball back and powered an effort past Barca goalkeeper Pena.Yamal hit back brilliantly from range and teed up Torres who struck the post, but it was too little, too late.Osasuna rose to sixth and Zaragoza said his team had been determined to beat the leaders.""We knew Barca were an incredible team, they had won everything and we knew we had to get stuck into it, and that's how we went out there,"" explained the winger.""It's a special game and really nice to play in.""","Osasuna shatter La Liga leaders Barcelona's perfect start to the season with an emphatic 4-2 victory on Saturday.

WOLVERHAMPTON: Ibrahima Konate headed home his first ever Premier League goal and Mohamed Salah converted a penalty as Liverpool climbed to the top of the Premier League table with a 2-1 victory over struggling Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday.Arne Slot's men have 15 points after six games, one more than both Manchester City and Arsenal, while Wolves are bottom with a single point.Konate scored in first-half injury time after Diogo Jota beat his man down the left then served up a pinpoint cross that the 25-year-old centre back leapt to head home.Wolves capitalised on some sloppy defending by Konate, however, to level in the 56th minute. The French centre back appeared to be leaving the ball to run out for a goal kick but Jorgen Strand Larsen kept it in, and Rayan Ait-Nouri scored from close range.Yet Salah silenced the celebratory home crowd at Molineux five minutes later when Liverpool were awarded a penalty for Nelson Semedo's foul on Jota, Salah sending keeper Sam Johnstone the wrong way.""I think a team like Liverpool has to be in the top four for sure; we keep pushing, we keep pushing, but it's really early,"" Liverpool midfielder Ryan Gravenberch told Sky Sports after another impressive display from the Dutch midfielder.""This season I wanted to show myself again and I am really happy. He (Slot) put me in the starting 11 and gave me a lot of confidence.""Dominik Szoboszlai had squandered a brilliant chance to get Liverpool on the scoreboard when he connected with a cross from Andy Robertson, but Johnstone stopped the Hungarian's point-blank shot.The Reds had a few more chances in the dying minutes including a corner that Konate headed over the bar and a shot to the bottom corner by Curtis Jones after a one-two with Salah that Johnstone saved.Liverpool's victory comes amid a busy schedule, with Slot's side crushing West Ham United 5-1 in a League Cup third-round tie on Wednesday, while they host Bologna in a Champions League match in four days' time.Gary O'Neil's struggling Wolves side have gone 18 games without a clean sheet, since a 1-0 win last February at Sheffield United.Wolves captain Mario Lemina looked distraught after the final whistle, pulling his shirt over his face before a couple of teammates arrived to console him.Aston Villa could draw level on points with Liverpool at the top of the table on Sunday with a win at Ipswich Town, although Unai Emery's side trail 10-3 on goal difference.","Ibrahima Konate scores first Premier League goal as Liverpool beat Wolves 2-1.

KOLKATA: Enduring a poor start to the season, Odisha FC put up a dominating offensive performance in front of the home fans to overcome their defensive woes for a 2-1 victory over Jamshedpur FC in Bhubaneswar on Saturday. The win also brought the Kalinga Warriors their first points of this Indian Super League (ISL) season following consecutive losses.Diego Mauricio (20') and Mourtada Fall (42') scored one each for the Juggernauts before Fall netted an own goal (62') after the change of sides.Though the scoreline doesn't reflect the authority the hosts had over their visitors, Odisha were at their attacking best for the entire first half which virtually sealed the fate of the match in the hosts' favour. They scored two in the first 45 minutes but could have easily been 4-0 up going into the breather.However, the first real chance of the match came in JFC's way only to be denied by the woodwork in the 18th minute. Spanish midfielder Javi Hernandez 's left-footed shot from well outside the area shook the right post following an assist by Jordan Murray.The shot not only shook the woodwork but also the hosts from their stupor as two minutes later Mauricio put Odisha in the lead. Although the assist came from Hugo Boumous, the chief architect of the move was Mizo winger Isak Vanlalruatfela (Ralte), who left behind three-four JFC players with his deft run on the right combined with dribbling before delivering a pass to Boumous near the centre of the box.After a swift first touch, the French midfielder released the ball for Mauricio on the left and the Brazilian was spot on to give Odisha a deserving lead with his left-footed shot, which took a little deflection off a JFC defender before going in at the bottom right corner.Odisha then could have easily doubled their lead in the 27th and 34th minute.First, right-back Amey Ranawade hit the side netting with a close-range header following a Mauricio through, which should have been put into the net.The next one was a brilliant goalline save by Pratik Chowdhary.A livewire on the flanks and Player of the Match Isak was again at the centre of the move as he sent in a defence-splitting through to Jerry Mawihmingthanga down the middle, and the Mizo winger did very well to shoot it past an onrushing JFC goalkeeper Albino Gomes to his right, only to be denied by an alert Pratik on the line.However, Odisha's relentless pressure helped them double their lead three minutes from the break when Fall beat Gomes with a low, free header near the far post from a Boumous corner from right.Khalid Jamil's Men of Steel returned a better lot after the half-time, but Odisha did well to keep the scoresheet clean till the hour mark. In the 62nd minute, centre-back Fall, in a loose attempt to clear a JFC corner, headed into his own goal to reduce the margin for the Red Miners.For the last 30 minutes or so the match became mostly a cagey affair and ended 2-1 despite some late attempts for the equalizer by JFC.",Diego Mauricio (20') and Mourtada Fall (42') scored one each for the Juggernauts.

KOLKATA: It was not a homecoming East Bengal fans were awaiting. After suffering two away defeats, the red-and-gold brigade completed a hat-trick of defeats in this ISL as they went down 2-3 to FC Goa in their first home match at the Salt Lake Stadium here on Friday. This time it was Borja Herrera who returned to haunt his former club, netting a hat-trick to give his side their first win of this ISL season while Carles Cuadrat 's disorganised unit was left looking for their first point in this edition.FC Goa dominated proceedings right from the word go as East Bengal were down by two goals within the first 20 minutes of play. Cuadrat brought in Debjit Majumder in place of out-of-form Prabhsukhan Singh Gill, but Ghosh had little chance to keep Borja at bay as poor defending saw the Spanish midfielder scoring from inside the box twice.In the 13th minute of play, Drazic kept the ball inside the box getting past East Bengal defender Anwar Ali on the left. Majumder did get a hand to punch it away but a lurking Borja collected the rebound to slot the ball inside the net.The next goal came soon after when Jordanian Hijazi Maher made a crucial blunder to lose the ball inside the box to Boris Singh, who cut inside and put it across to an unmarked Borja, who made a perfect finish giving Majumder no chance. In both the goals, none of the East Bengal defenders were in their positions.With most of the play being restricted inside the East Bengal half, it looked like the hosts were staring at another humiliation in front of the home crowd. But East Bengal managed to pull one back when they earned a penalty after Madih Talal was rather unnecessarily brought down inside the box by Goa defender Nim Dorji . Talal himself found the net from the spot in the 29th minute.The visitors continued to create opportunities and could have increased the lead had Majumder not made some vital saves. Borja once again found the target to complete his hat-trick in the 71st minute when Udanta Singh won possession from Hijazi and squared it to the Spanish player to push it in.However the Goa side suffered a setback when Carl McHugh saw a second yellow for a reckless tackle and received his marching orders in the 81st minute. East Bengal got their second goal when Goa goalkeeper Laxmikant Kattimani failed to collect Anwar's long ranger properly and substitute David Lalhlansanga was quick to pounce on it and fire it on the roof of the net from a close distance.Although East Bengal kept pushing for the equaliser in the final minutes, FC Goa managed to hold fort.",Borja Herrera scored a hat-trick to give FC Goa their first win of this ISL season. East Bengal were down by two goals within the first 20 minutes of play. Madih Talal and David Lalhlansanga scored for the hosts. Carl McHugh was sent off for the visitors.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113757243,imgsize-85732,width-400,resizemode-4/113757243.jpg"

BEIJING: Top-ranked Jannik Sinner rallied to beat Roman Safiullin 3-6, 6-2, 6-3 in the second round of the China Open on Saturday and learned afterward that his steroid case is far from over.While Sinner was on court in Beijing, the World Anti-Doping Agency announced it was seeking a ban of one to two years for the U.S. Open champion who tested positive twice for an anabolic steroid in March but was not suspended in a decision by an independent tribunal announced by the International Tennis Integrity Agency on Aug.20 because the ITIA determined he was not to blame.Sinner's fate will now be determined by the Switzerland-based Court of Arbitration for Sport after WADA said it filed an appeal on Thursday.""Obviously, I'm very disappointed and also surprised of this appeal, to be honest, because we had three hearings,"" Sinner said at a press conference after his match Saturday. ""All three hearings came out very positively for me.""You know, I was not expecting it. I knew it couple of days ago, that they were going to appeal, that today it's going to go official. But yeah, it's surprise.""On court Saturday, the two-time Grand Slam champion again found himself behind in the Chinese capital after Safiullin broke serve twice to claim the opening set.Sinner's power and laser-like accuracy from the baseline gradually chipped away at his Russian opponent and helped the Italian to win seven straight games from 2-2 in the second set to take the ascendancy and close out a gritty win.Sinner, who has reached at least the quarterfinals at every tour-level event he has played in 2024, will next play Jiri Lehecka, who earlier defeated Roberto Bautista Agut 3-6, 6-2, 6-1.Third-seeded Daniil Medvedev , who lost to Sinner in this year's Australian Open final, also reached the last eight after beating French veteran Adrian Mannarino 7-6 (6), 6-2.Medvedev, the 2021 U.S. Open champion, had eight aces and broke Mannarino's serve four times as he advanced to his 75th tour-level quarterfinal.""Titles are more important obviously than finals. But even then 75 quarterfinals are great,"" said Medvedev, who is Russian. ""When I made my first quarterfinal (it) was (in) Moscow and I was pretty happy. And now it's 75. I am still happy, but not the same way.""He next faces Italy's Flavio Cabolli, who advanced with a 6-4, 6-2 win over Pavel Kotov.In the women's draw, U.S. Open champion Aryna Sabalenka advanced to the third round with a 6-4, 6-1 win over Thai qualifier Mananchaya Sawangkaew.""In the first set, I was struggling a little bit with the rhythm,"" said Sabalenka, who's best run in Beijing has only been to the quarterfinals. ""In the second set, seems like everything started working much better. I think that's why it was more smooth and better quality.""The second-ranked Sabalenka is the top seed in Beijing in the absence of Iga Swiatek .Next up for the three-time major winner is American Ashlyn Krueger, who beat New Zealand's Lulu Sun 6-1, 7-6 (4).Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen of China, seeded fifth, also advanced with a 6-1, 6-1 win over unseeded Kamilla Rakhimova. Her next opponent, Nadia Podoroska of Argentina, is also unseeded.Third-seeded Jasmine Paolini of Italy rallied from a poor first set to beat Denmark's Clara Tauson 1-6, 7-5, 6-4. Paolini, the French Open and Wimbledon runner-up, will play Poland's Magda Linette after the 31st-seeded player also needed three sets to progress past Moyuka Uchijima 6-4, 4-6, 6-3.Ninth-seeded Daria Kasatkina of Russia beat Croatian Jana Fett 6-1, 6-2. She will play Amanda Anisimova, who beat Camila Osorio of Colombia 1-6, 6-3, 6-4.Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova was upset 1-6, 6-4, 7-5 by Romania's Jaqueline Cristian.American Madison Keys, seeded 18th, won 6-2, 6-1 against Spaniard Sara Sorribes Tormo and next faces 13th-seeded Beatriz Haddad Maia of Brazil.Japan Open Tomas Machac upset fifth-seeded Tommy Paul 2-6, 6-3, 7-6 (4) to advance to the quarterfinals and continued a disappointing week for the top-seeded players in Tokyo.Top-seeded Taylor Fritz, third-seeded Casper Ruud and fourth-seeded Stefaos Tsitsipas were all beaten in the first round, before second-seeded Hubert Hurkacz was also eliminated as he lost to U.S. Open semifinalist Jack Draper 6-4, 6-4 in the second round.Sixth-seeded Holger Rune is the highest-ranked seed remaining in the draw. Rune, from Denmark, beat home favorite Yoshihito Nishioka 6-2, 6-4.Defending champion Ben Shelton , the No. 8 seed, is the only other seeded player left in the quarterfinal draw.Alex Michelsen of the U.S. also advanced after a 6-1, 6-4 win over Australian Christopher O'Connell to set up a quarterfinal match against Machac.Kei Nishikori beat Jordan Thompson 6-2, 6-3 and will play Rune in the quarterfinals.","Top-ranked Jannik Sinner rallies to beat Roman Safiullin 3-6, 6-2,. 6-3 in the second round of the China Open.

Vijay turns his tennis around despite financial challenges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/vijay-turns-his-tennis-around-despite-financial-challenges/articleshow/113769629.cms,"Vijay Sundar Prashanth during the ATP 250 men's tennis event in Hangzhou, China, last week

PUNE: Sometimes the sequel can be better than the original.If his tennis career were to be divided in two halves, there would be no prizes for guessing which one Vijay Sundar Prashanth would cherish more.The 37-year-old has been living his dreams these past couple of years. He notched up three Challenger doubles titles in 2023 in partnership with Anirudh Chandrasekar , 11 years younger to him.The pair played the Australian Open this year, first appearance in a Grand Slam for both, before a string of poor results saw them part ways.Vijay, however, found his mojo back quickly after starting to combine with his childhood friend Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan from May.The duo reached the final of the clay-court Challenger in Bonn in August and took it up to another level last week by clinching the ATP 250 Series event in Hangzhou, China.""I mean, it's a great feeling after having gone through the journey. And, I would say some type of validation that we are doing the right things and on the right path,"" said Vijay of his maiden success on the ATP Tour in a measured tone, belying the overwhelming emotions he was experiencing.Except in the opening round, all three teams the Indian combination subsequently defeated enroute to the trophy featured top-50 ranked players - Julian Cash (38) and Lloyd Glasspool (42) in the second round, Ariel Behar (45) and Robert Galloway (40) in the semis, and Constantin Frantzen (47) and Hendrick Jebens (47) in the final.""To be honest, we didn't expect to win the title. I mean, we always believed in ourselves and our talent, and we believed that we can match any team at the highest level,"" Vjay said.""With the doubles format, we knew that we had to play good on big points. I think we did it well this week.""Actually, to do it back to back for four matches and against top 50 teams, that really surprised us. But also not in a big way, because I think both of us truly believed that we could match any team in this tournament.""Playing with Jeevan seems to bring out the best in him.""We are very familiar with each other, we've known each other for almost 25 years, on court and off court. We grew up together in Chennai. So that makes it easier to work as a team,"" Vijay said.""We acknowledge each other's analysis after the match and feedback with an open mind, so it helps the team progress.""We kind of know we are in it for a long run, and we are not going to judge the partnership based on a few bad results or a few first-round defeats. That's how we've taken it, so that‚Äôs helped.""But the journey has not always been a bed of roses. The covid pandemic disrupted his career right when he was shifting focus to doubles and the prolonged period of uncertainty was much harsh on someone who has had to deal with financial constraints right through his career.""Yes, after covid, it was tough, because for most tennis players who weren't playing at the highest level, they had to, I had to re-evaluate my whole career, my life, how to take it forward,"" he said.""That's when I felt doubles could be a viable option to continue, because at least I would be playing the Challenger tour, which technically would help me progress up the ladder and financially help me sustain playing the sport.""Since then, I've had a lot more clarity on how to approach doubles. And I have this blind belief that I can be a very good doubles player. That has just translated (to) on-court.""The revival began when his contemporary and former Tamil Nadu state-mate PC Vignesh asked him if he was willing to combine with his younger brother Anirudh.Anirudh had made a pretty early decision to play doubles full-time and Vignesh felt the seasoned Vijay would be the ideal partner to guide Anirudh.""The partnership with Anirudh was good because we kind of made use of each other's strengths,"" Vijay said.""He made use of my experience, and I made use of his young, enthusiastic energy, which I was lacking.""Because I was coming back after lockdown, (I was) searching for answers, and someone who had that motivation and enthusiasm, it rubbed off on me, and I was giving him the experience.""Then we kind of worked our way. So, it was actually a good partnership because we had to climb different levels.""We had to work as a team. For the first time in my career, I worked as a team with someone, and we had to cross many barriers. We played the first slam (for both) together. So, it was really good, yeah.""While he has managed to turn things around on the tennis court, it is yet to translate into financial security - given the low purse offered in doubles.""To be honest, what's always been the challenge for me my entire career is the financial aspect of playing the sport professionally,"" Vijay said.""I don't know how long I can sustain because now I am married, I have a five-month-old baby. So, I have to think about that aspect of life as well.""So, I've accepted that it's never going to go away. It's up to me to start doing well, and then I can generate my own funds and sustain myself playing at this level.""So, for me personally, that's the only challenge, everything else, I'm very confident about myself, my work ethic, the partner that I have, and the circle that I've created around myself.""My wife has been very supportive of my career, which is really crucial at this stage.""So, the only challenge for me is the financial aspect. Hopefully there comes a stage where I don't have to worry about it.""","Vijay Sundar Prashanth won the ATP 250 Series event in Hangzhou, China. The 37-year-old has been living his dreams these past couple of years.

NEW DELHI: Jannik Sinner ‚Äôs ongoing doping controversy has ignited discussions about doping in tennis once again. While Sinner, ranked among the top tennis players in the world, continues to appeal his case after testing positive for an anabolic steroid, the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) is seeking a ban.The tennis world is watching closely, as this case brings back memories of other high-profile doping bans in the sport.That said, we look at five tennis stars who were banned for doping.In 2016, the tennis world was stunned when Maria Sharapova, one of the most celebrated female players, tested positive for meldonium at the Australian Open.Meldonium, which had just been added to the banned substances list, was a heart medication Sharapova had been using legally for many years. She was initially handed a two-year ban by the International Tennis Federation (ITF), but after appealing to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), her suspension was reduced to 15 months.Sharapova admitted to not being aware of meldonium‚Äôs addition to the banned list, and though the ban affected her career, she returned to the sport in 2017.Five-time Grand Slam champion Martina Hingis shocked the tennis world in 2007 when she announced she had tested positive for cocaine at Wimbledon.Hingis denied ever taking the drug, but chose not to contest the result. She retired from tennis soon after and was handed a two-year ban by the ITF.Despite the ban, Hingis's legacy remains strong, and she later made a successful comeback in doubles tennis, further cementing her place in tennis history.Simona Halep, a two-time Grand Slam champion, was handed a four-year ban in September 2023 after testing positive for the banned substance Roxadustat at the 2022 US Open. However, it was later cut to nine months.Halep has consistently maintained her innocence, claiming the result was due to contamination or an unintentional error. Despite her defence, the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) pursued a thorough investigation, leading to the suspension.The case has raised questions about doping regulations and the challenges athletes face in proving their innocence when contamination is alleged. Halep's career now hangs in the balance as she fights to restore her reputation.The Croatian tennis star Marin ƒåiliƒá was banned in 2013 after testing positive for the stimulant nikethamide. ƒåiliƒá claimed he had inadvertently ingested the banned substance through glucose tablets and contested the severity of the ban.Initially banned for nine months, the suspension was later reduced to four months by CAS.ƒåiliƒá went on to win the 2014 US Open, proving that a doping ban, while damaging, doesn‚Äôt necessarily end a player‚Äôs career.In 2009, French tennis player Richard Gasquet tested positive for cocaine and was handed a 12-month ban by the ITF. However, Gasquet's defence was one of the more unusual in sports doping history.He claimed that he had ingested the drug inadvertently by kissing a woman who had consumed cocaine in a nightclub. An independent tribunal accepted his explanation and reduced his ban to two and a half months, allowing him to return to competition soon after.The current case with Jannik Sinner bears some similarities to these past incidents, especially in terms of contested explanations and appeals.Sinner, who tested positive for low levels of Clostebol, a banned anabolic steroid, claims the substance entered his system accidentally through his physiotherapist's treatment. Despite three hearings that ruled in Sinner‚Äôs favour, WADA has appealed the case, seeking a one-to-two-year ban, which could disrupt the young player's rising career.","Jannik Sinner tested positive for Clostebol, a banned anabolic steroid.

BEIJING: Jannik Sinner said he was ""disappointed and surprised"" Saturday after the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) appealed the decision to clear him in his steroid case, seeking a ban of up to two years.The Italian world number one twice tested positive for traces of the banned substance clostebol in March but was exonerated and allowed to carry on playing.The 23-year-old went on to win the US Open earlier this month for his second major crown, weeks after the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) found he ""bears no fault or negligence"".The ITIA accepted his explanation that the drug entered his system when his physiotherapist used a spray containing it to treat a cut, then provided massage and sports therapy to the player.WADA on Thursday appealed the high-profile case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport .""It is WADA's view that the finding of 'no fault or negligence' was not correct under the applicable rules,"" it said in a statement on Saturday.WADA made the appeal announcement as Sinner was on court at the China Open, where the defending champion fought back to beat 69th-ranked Russian Roman Safiullin 3-6, 6-2, 6-3 in Beijing.""WADA is seeking a period of ineligibility of between one and two years,"" it added.Sinner has consistently denied knowingly doping and said after his win: ""Obviously I'm very disappointed and also surprised.""We had three hearings. All three hearings came out very positively for me.""Clostebol is an anabolic agent prohibited at all times by WADA.After winning the US Open, Sinner said that the controversy over his failed tests was still on his mind.He defeated Taylor Fritz in straight sets to add the New York title to his Australia Open triumph in January.""It was and it's still on my mind. It's not that it's gone, but when I'm on court, I try to focus about the game, I try to handle the situation the best possible way, communication with the team, in the practice courts,"" said the world number one.""It was not easy, that's for sure, but I tried to stay focused, with which I guess I've done a great job.""The decision to clear the Italian was met with scepticism by some players in the locker room who suggested that Sinner had benefited from preferential treatment due to his status in the sport.Australia's Nick Kyrgios said in a post on X that the lack of a suspension was ""ridiculous"".Canadian player Denis Shapovalov said the decision proved that there are ""different rules for different players"" suggesting that Sinner was saved by his ranking.On court in Beijing, Sinner fell behind against the ""lucky loser"" Safiullin on Saturday after also dropping a set in his opening victory over Chile's Nicolas Jarry.The second set went with serve until the sixth game when Sinner finally broke to go up 4-2, celebrating with a subtle fist pump.Sinner took control early on in the deciding set on the way to an ultimately comfortable victory to reach the last eight, where he faces Jiri Lehecka of the Czech Republic.In-form Sinner has reached at least the quarter-final of every tournament he has played this year.","Jannik Sinner says he is ""disappointed and surprised"" by World Anti-Doping Agency's appeal.

The first round at any tournament is never easy and playing against him is very tough.""But I am happy about the performance and how I ended the match.""The two went toe-to-toe in the first set but it was the Chilean who got in front when he broke for a 4-3 lead when the world number one fired long.The 28-year-old Jarry consolidated without losing a point in the eighth game and, after double-faulting on his first set point, sealed the set with his fifth ace of the match.Going behind seemed to sting a re-energised Sinner into action.The top seed raced to a 3-0 lead in the second set, eventually wrapping the set up after briefly threatening to blow his advantage.Sinner tamed Jarry's big serve to start the deciding set and grab an early break, winning the game with a terrific crosscourt backhand.Sinner broke again for 4-1 and was well on the way to an ultimately comfortable win.His main rivals in the Chinese capital will be four-time major champion Carlos Alcaraz and the Russian duo of Daniil Medvedev and Andrey Rublev , the third and fourth seeds. Novak Djokovic is not in Beijing, where a WTA 1000 event is also taking place at the same time.","World number one Jannik Sinner beats Nicolas Jarry in straight sets.

For Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan , the ATP Tour doubles title in Hangzhou marks a sort of Jeev 2.0 ‚Äî not only has his game has matured and become more solid since he won his maiden title at his home town of Chennai, but he is also able to understand better the significance of triumph and what it means to his career going forward.The 35-year-old left-hander claimed the ATP 250 Series event in Hangzhou, China, in the company of his friend and fellow Tamil Nadu player Vijay Sundar Prashanth , beating Constantin Frantzen and Hendrik Jebens of Germany 4-6, 7-6 (5), 10-7 in the hard-court final on Sunday.Jeevan‚Äôs first title had come in 2017 at the Chennai Open in the company of veteran Davis Cupper and Australian Open Grand Slam champion Rohan Bopanna.‚ÄúI think (I am) a little bit more experienced. I remember the first title was a little sooner than I thought,‚Äù Jeevan, who has climbed 27 spots on the ATP ladder to be ranked 86 in doubles, told The Times of India.‚ÄúAfter switching to doubles, Rohan and I had won Chennai in 2017 and I didn't really know where that title was going to take me, you know.‚ÄúI was just kind of excited to be playing Grand Slams , because that title happened to push me into the top 100. And ironically, this title has also pushed me into the top 100.‚ÄúBut I would say, (in) 2017 I was kind of naive without any real path to move forward after achieving a 250 title. But now, I'm feeling much calmer after winning a title of this stage, because I have a set partner and I have schedule which works in our favour.‚ÄúAnd I'm healthy, I'm able to see that there is definitely going to be an exciting path to be playing with the same partner and consistently at a higher level.‚ÄùIt has been an eventful year for him so far, and Jeevan, wiser with experience, feels things are falling in place for him.‚ÄúThis year has not been very easy, there have been a lot of ups and downs. But very happy to be playing with Vijay, who's one of my closest friends, not just on tour, but in life,‚Äù he said.‚ÄúWe've been patient as a team. We've been learning how to get to our best ability together.‚ÄúAs the as far as the emotions are concerned, I think in goal setting, it was very clear for me that this was going to be the year for me to build something, because I'm always looking at long term with my partners.‚ÄúI have only played with a handful of people my whole career. So with Vijay, we are just building something to give ourselves an opportunity to be, you know, a set team in the Grand Slams next year.‚ÄùA long-term partnership has become a rare phenomenon in modern doubles and Jeevan looks at it practically.‚ÄúA lot of teams are looking to build partnerships together. You can see (that) even with the Double Dream of India. So many teams are sticking together, and we're just trying to figure out what best combinations are going to get us all into the Grand Slams,‚Äù he said.‚ÄúToday was a good day for Vijay and me, but the season has been good for Balaji and even Yuki has been doing very well.‚ÄúThe ideal goal for this program is to see all the players sitting at the Slam, taking a group picture.‚Äù","Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan wins ATP Tour doubles title in Hangzhou.

South Korean Lee Hyun Il is Sindhu's consulting coach

BENGALURU: After a disappointing Paris Olympics , PV Sindhu has a new coach, though temporarily, in former Olympian Anup Sridhar . The two-time Olympic medallist will work with the Karnataka man for the remainder of the year and the duo will sit down by the year-end to decide upon the future.Sridhar came into the picture after Sindhu's coach Indonesian Agus Dwi Santoso's contract got over after the quadrennial event.The former international player was taken on board after a successful meeting with the star player and her team. For the last three weeks, the ace shuttler, who trained at the Prakash Padukone Badminton Academy (PPBA) before Paris, has been sweating it out for almost five hours daily under the watchful eyes of Sridhar at the Gachibowli Stadium in Hyderabad. She has been involved in sparring sessions and fitness routines too. The current coaching team also includes former Korean shuttler Lee Hyun Il .Sridhar is pleased with the way the new partnership has begun and is keen to work on different aspects of Sindhu's game in the coming weeks. ""The start has been good so far. The first thing was to get her pain free, playing and moving freely on the court, which we have achieved. Now we're working on getting her speed and endurance levels up. There's a decent amount of improvement,"" Sridhar told TOI. ""I have tried to devise training programmes and routines around the areas that she's finding a little bit difficult.""The last 21 months has not been great for Sindhu as she did not win a single BWF singles title. The task is now cut out for Sridhar as her results in the next three months could prove to be the difference between a long or short-term association with Sindhu. However, the Bengaluruean is looking beyond the results.""The results are certainly important, but I wouldn't say it is the only important thing to look at. No miracles are going to be performed either by me or by anybody else, real change takes time. But I think this period is important from the point of view of how we work together, how we communicate. The working relationship will be important,"" he said.To start with, Sindhu has marked two events for next month, the Arctic Open in Finland (Oct 8-13, Super 500), and Denmark Open in Odense (Oct 15-20, Super 750). ""She's hungry to do well,"" said Sridhar NEW DELHI: PV Sindhu will have South Korean great Lee Hyun Il as her consulting coach on interim basis as she bolstered her coaching team ahead of her anticipated return to action next month.",Former Olympian Anup Sridhar will work with the Karnataka man for the remainder of the year.

HYDERABAD: Amid the uneasy quiet caused by Saina Nehwal 's repeated hints at retirement and PV Sindhu 's indifferent form of late, Anmol Kharb has quietly announced her arrival on the big stage with two back-to-back titles.Many pundits, including Pullela Gopichand , say the 17-year-old shuttler from Haryana can fill the gap, following her international triumphs in Belgium and Poland in the last two weeks.Sunday last, she routed Milena Schnider of Switzerland 21-12, 21-8 in the final of the Poland Open . A week before that, Anmol started the Belgium Open as a qualifier and went on to win her first women's singles title with a 24-22, 12-21, 21-10 victory against Amalie Schulz of Denmark in Leuven.And to think that she nearly missed the event. Anmol reached the Belgium Open venue an hour before her match after a long flight due to a visa issue. But she won seven straight matches to clinch the title.Anmol is also credited with helping the Indian women win the Badminton Asia Team Championship by pulling off crucial matches against top-ranked opponents in February. A gritty player, Anmol became the women's national champion last year when she was just 16.It is this never-say-die attitude and her willingness to work hard with a smile that makes Gopichand see a Saina in Anmol.""She is like Saina, very gritty and never leaves without putting up a tough fight,"" Gopichand told TOI on Tuesday after Anmol won her second international title in Poland.Gopichand, who shaped the careers of Saina, Sindhu, Kidambi Srikanth and several others, is not surprised by Anmol's progress. ""I am not at all surprised by her results. She will win more tournaments. A few basics in her game need correction. She has a good future and is on the right track,"" Gopichand added.A big fan of Saina, Anmol is being trained by Saina's husband Parupalli Kashyap, RMV Gurusaidutt and former international Rahul Yadav.Currently ranked 165th, Anmol's target is to get into the top-15 as soon as possible. In a bid to improve her ranking, the teen is busy collecting ranking points by winning as many tournaments as possible.","Anmol Kharb has quietly announced her arrival on the big stage with two back-to- back titles.

NEW DELHI: PV Sindhu is continuing her quest for success with new motivation from coach Anup Sridhar . Sridhar, a former Olympian, began working with Sindhu on a trial basis following the Paris Games . Despite not winning a medal in Paris, Sindhu has been training under Sridhar for the past three weeks at Gachibowli Stadium in Hyderabad.PV Sindhu's recent notable achievements include her victories at the Singapore Open and the Commonwealth Games in 2022.In 2023, she was the runner-up at the Madrid Spain Masters and at the Malaysia Masters Super 500 in May.""I spoke with Sindhu's team a few weeks ago, and she has been training under me in Hyderabad since the start of this month. We've made significant progress, and in two weeks, we'll head to tournaments in Europe,"" said Sridhar, who previously coached Lakshya Sen.PV Sindhu exited the Paris Games in the pre-quarterfinals, losing to China's He Bingjiao. Sindhu will now turn her attention to the European leg of the BWF World Tour . Her next event will be the Arctic Open in Vantaa, Finland, scheduled for October 8-13, followed by the Denmark Open in Odense from October 15-20.""I'm taking it week by week,"" said Sridhar, who was brought on for the rest of the season after Agus Dwi Santoso 's contract ended post-Paris Olympics.""Since we haven't committed to anything long-term, it's hard to plan for 2025. However, there are a couple of tournaments in 2025 that Sindhu should aim to peak at,"" he said.""You can plan for physical peaks, but not for form. I have my eye on a few tournaments next year, but the immediate focus is to enhance her consistency and get her back on the podium -- that's the big goal.""Reflecting on the current training, Sridhar noted, ""I've spent this time understanding her situation, and I'm pleased to report that she's completely physically fit, with no signs of aches or pains.""""We've followed our training schedule without missing any sessions. I'm working on helping her unlearn certain things while introducing new elements to her game,"" he added.Sindhu had a challenging period after a knee injury during the French Open last October, returning to competition only five months before the Paris Games.""She faced a tough couple of years with some good results but lacked consistency during that period,"" Sridhar said.""In just three weeks, I've noticed decent improvements, but there's still more work to be done,"" said Sridhar, a 2007 Asian Championships bronze-medallist.""If we can get her to a level where she's consistently advancing past the early rounds, regardless of her draw or opponent, she'll have a realistic chance of making a strong comeback.""""...yet her hunger remains. She works extremely hard and is a great role model for the rest of India's badminton players."" he added.PV Sindhu has seen multiple coaching changes leading up to the Paris Olympics. After securing a bronze medal at the Tokyo Olympics , her South Korean coach, Park Tae Sang, left her team in early 2023.Following his departure, Sindhu collaborated with SAI coach Vidhi Chaudhary for several months. She then appointed Muhammad Hafiz Hashim, a former All England champion, as her coach.This partnership, however, was short-lived. Sindhu then moved to Bengaluru to train under Prakash Padukone. Later, Padukone's academy brought in Agus Dwi Santoso to prepare her for the upcoming Olympics.","PV Sindhu is continuing her quest for success with new motivation from coach Anup Sridhar.

""I altered my strategy in the dying stage of both the games. Despite holding a 19-18 lead, I struggled to convert due to the drift, which I countered by varying my strokes, causing confusion for my opponent.
