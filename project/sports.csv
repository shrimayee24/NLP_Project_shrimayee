Tonight's match -- will take place at United Center in Chicago. It will be interesting to see if Giannis Antetokounmpo's Bucks can carry their momentum into this match after the Emirates Cup victory.In this article, we will walk you through everything you need to know about the matchup, including injury reports, key players, broadcast details, and more.- Ryan Rollins- Andre Jackson Jr.- Khris Middleton- Giannis Antetokounmpo- Brook Lopez- Zach LaVine- Coby White- Josh Giddey- Patrick Williams- Nikola Vucevic(Note: Projected starters are subject to change. This is not the finalized roster and this applies to both the teams playing tonight.)- Giannis Antetokounmpo- Brook Lopez- Zach LaVine- Nikola VucevicIn a recent matchup on November 8, 2024, the Bucks defeated the Bulls 112-106. Giannis Antetokounmpo was the highest scorer of the game with 41 points.- Moneyline: Bucks (-121) vs. Bulls (+101)- Spread: Bucks -1.5 (-110) vs. Bulls +1.5 (-110)- Total (O/U): Bucks o233.5 (-112) vs. Bulls u233.5 (-110)With his points over/under set at 34.5, Giannis Antetokounmpo is scoring 32.7 points per game on average this season. Antetokounmpo is poised for another outstanding effort as Damian Lillard may miss his third straight game. Nonetheless, it is advised to wager on ""The Greek Freak"" to score fewer than 34.5 points in their matchup with the Chicago Bulls.For Monday's game, Zach LaVine's points over/under is set at 21.5 with even odds. LaVine can heat up quickly, as evidenced by the fact that he has scored 22 points or more in three of his last five games. It looks safer to bet on him to score more than 21.5 points.Against the Bucks, Nikola Vucevic is predicted to score less than 18.5 points. Giannis Antetokounmpo and Brook Lopez could pose a threat to him, even though he has scored 19 points or more in two of his last five games. The recommended bet is on Vucevic to score 18 points or less.Coby White is favoured to score at least 16 points, with an over/under of 15.5 points. His season average of 17.7 points per game makes it reasonable to wager on the Bulls guard to score more than 15.5 points, even though he has fallen short of this total in three of his previous six games.The Milwaukee Bucks are expected to defeat the Chicago Bulls, even if they face potential lineup challenges. Giannis Antetokounmpo's exceptional performances have propelled him into the MVP discussion. The projection leans toward a Bucks victory, with the total score likely exceeding 233.5 points.The match between the Bucks and the Bulls will take place on December 23, 2024, at 8:00 pm ET.

Jordan Love reacts to the wild theory that his incredible season might have more to do with Toyota’s Toyotathon than anyone could have guessed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/jordan-love-reacts-to-the-wild-theory-that-his-incredible-season-might-have-more-to-do-with-toyotas-toyotathon-than-anyone-could-have-guessed/articleshow/116607067.cms,"Image via Cooper Neill/Getty

Jordan Love’s Success On The Field Is Being Credited To The Car Manufacturer Brand Toyota



Jordan Love Also Participates In This ‘Toyotathon Carspiracy’



Jordan Love has been having one of the best seasons of his life but his fans are crediting someone else other than Jordan for his success. It’s not a person though the fans are crediting the success to - it is none other but ‘Toyatathon’. Toyatathon is the annual sales event held by Toyota's car manufacturer, which takes place every year, around November and December. Fans have found a pattern that every year when Toyota hosts Toyotathon , somehow Jordan and his team, the Green Bay Packers win every match.Coincidentally, this year the same pattern is being followed. The Toyotathon started on 15th November this year. The annual sale programme will be held by Toyota till 6th of January. Since 15th November, the Green Bay Packers have played five games and have already won four out of the five games played.Many fans have taken to X and have started comparing Jordan Love’s performance as the quarterback of the Green Bay Packers, before and during the Toyatathon sale. Turns out before the Toyota’s annual sale Toyatathon began, Jordan’s performance was average; he had 3,829 yards, 29 Touchdowns and 25 interceptions. These scores changed the moment Toyatathon began and now his scores are 3,283 yards, 26 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. But is it only because of Toyotathon? Surely not, since Jordan is an exceptional player in the Green Bay Packers and the team is heavily dependent on this quarterback.But it looks like Jordan also keeps a watch out for what his fans have been thinking. He was also probably laughing at the theories people are coming up with regarding his exceptional performance and success on the field since the last four matches. But instead of complaining about his success being credited to something else, he has participated in this interesting theory. Jordan recently uploaded a photo on his Instagram where he is seen posing next to his Toyota SUV which is grey in colour. Jordan is seen wearing a red t-shirt that is Christmas themed. But instead of wishing ‘Merry Christmas’ to his fans, the shirt has the words ‘Merry Toyotathon’ written on it with a logo of the car manufacturer brand Toyota in the middle of the shirt. He is wearing a black vest jacket on top of it and looks like a dapper.As Jordan participated in this hilarious conspiracy regarding his success in the last four matches, he also tagged Toyota USA in his picture and wrote a caption that said, “Toyotathon is on. #ToyotaPartner #CarspiracyTheory. Toyota USA also reposted Jordan’s picture of him wearing the ‘Merry Toyotathon’ t-shirt on their story but have not added a caption.Also Read: Travis Hunter slams online haters targeting fiancée Leanna Lenee: “Why would I break up with my girl just because of the internet?” Jordan Love will be next seen tomorrow as his team, the Green Bay Packers goes against the New Orleans Saints.","Jordan Love’s Success On The Field Is Being Credited To The Car Manufacturer Brand Toyota.

After missing the Hornets' previous game due to injury management for a lingering left calf issue, Ball is no longer listed on the team's injury report. This allows the team to breathe a significant sigh of relief as the team has struggled to find consistency this season.LaMelo’s absence was strongly felt during Friday’s 108-98 loss to the Philadelphia 76ers at the Wells Fargo Center. Without their All-Star guard, the Hornets failed to create the offensive pressure needed to put up a fight against the 76ers.

In his most recent outing, a 123-114 loss to the Washington Wizards, Ball put up 34 points, 4 rebounds, 13 assists, and 4 steals in 34 minutes.

“Absolutely ridiculous”: Keanu Reeves provided a humorous response to the rumor that the Ravens offered him a chance at quarterback,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/absolutely-ridiculous-keanu-reeves-provided-a-humorous-response-to-the-rumor-that-the-ravens-offered-him-a-chance-at-quarterback/articleshow/116522105.cms,"Image via Getty Images

Keanu Reeves was once approached to try out for quarterback by the Baltimore Ravens

Keanu Reeves & Idris Elba Talk Shane Falco, Michael Jordan Movie & Auto Racing

One popular rumor suggests that Keanu Reeves became so good as a quarterback during the movie ""The Replacements"" that he got invited to try out for the Baltimore Ravens. It is indeed well-known that the internet can mix truth and gossip or fiction with claims like this. Rumor has it that Reeves is preparing for this coming NFL season. Most blended with this idea of Reeves trying out for an NFL team fit well with his reputation for hard work and intense preparation for his film roles.The Replacements is a 2000 sports comedy film directed by Howard Deutch and starring Keanu Reeves, Gene Hackman, Orlando Jones, Brooke Langton, Rhys Ifans, Jon Favreau, and Jack Warden in his last film appearance before his death in 2006.Keanu Reeves's role in The Replacements, playing Shane Falco in 2000, was among the most defining moments of his illustrious career as an actor. In the film, Reeves was the quarterback for the Washington Sentinels, signed after a strike, as Falco is the quarterback needed by coach Jimmy McGinty, played by Gene Hackman.In an interview on Sports Illustrated, Reeves together with Idris Elba discussed their upcoming movie, Sonic the Hedgehog 3, and rumors of an NFL try-out with the Baltimore Ravens after playing Falco in The Replacements. ""That's absolutely ridiculous,"" Reeves said with a huge smile. ""I got OK, but that is ridiculous. Yes! Yes! Yes! Yeah, I was out there, 'Blue 87!' [throwing] 50-yard outs no problem,"" he added laughing.The Baltimore Ravens, led by Brian Billick at that time, won Super Bowl XXXV less than six months after ""The Replacements"" premiered. While some sources suggest Billick might have expressed interest in Reeves, no official records or statements confirm that the Ravens extended a tryout invitation. Reeves' reputation for intense preparation in film roles and his portrayal of Shane Falco as a comeback-story quarterback make the rumor of him trying out for an NFL team plausible.Also Read: Will Taylor Swift attend the Chiefs-Texans game to cheer for Travis Kelce? Fans wonder if it's her final regular season appearance The Replacements was inspired very loosely by the 1987 NFL strike; in its story, one team-the won-out Washington Redskins-won three replacement games while all of its regular players were lost and then went on to win Super Bowl XXII after that. The story may center on replacement players, but the Falco–Martel quarterback controversy is reminiscent of the post-strike Washington controversy involving Doug Williams and Jay Schroeder.Squeezed in as the third position on the box office chart, the movie made $11,039,214 within its opening weekend in North American box office standings, following Space Cowboys and Hollow Man - which both made their way to this spot for the second consecutive week. By the end, it grossed about $44.7 million in domestic figures and about $5.3 million internationally, at more than $50 million worldwide.Although there is no official record, there are indications that Keanu Reeves was indeed offered the chance to play on the Ravens. However, Shane Falco was praised by Brian Billick, who at that time was the quarterback of the Baltimore Ravens. The team won Super Bowl XXXV six months after the movie had been released.","Rumor has it that Keanu Reeves was once approached to try out for quarterback by the Baltimore Ravens.

Is Deshaun Watson still the future for Browns?



Browns' Myles Garrett Speaks on Deshaun Watson's Allegations | THE ODD COUPLE

Could Cleveland Browns part ways with Deshaun Watson in 2025?



When the Cleveland Browns made the unprecedented move to sign Deshaun Watson to a fully guaranteed, five-year, $230 million contract, they aimed to solidify their quarterback position for years to come. Fast forward to today, and the future is clouded with uncertainty. Watson's performance has failed to live up to the hype, leaving the Browns with a costly contract and an uncertain quarterback situation.When the Cleveland Browns signed Deshaun Watson to a fully guaranteed, five-year, $230 million contract, it sent a bold message. Whether it was the right one remains up for debate, but now the Browns are stuck with this massive deal for years.Watson's play hasn't come close to justifying the contract. He was sidelined with a shoulder injury in October, and since then, he's been largely out of the spotlight, with the exception of a trip to Miami with his girlfriend, Jilly Anais.With Watson out, the Browns turned to Jameis Winston, but he was inactive in their recent loss to the Bengals. Dorian Thompson-Robinson stepped in but struggled, throwing for just 157 yards, no touchdowns, and two interceptions. The Browns fell to their 12th loss of the season.Afterward, Myles Garrett was asked about Watson's future, as questions linger about the quarterback position in 2025.“Once he’s ready and willing to come back, I’m going to support whoever’s behind center,"" Garrett said. ""That’s no dig at Deshaun. I’m hoping he’s ready when the time comes but that’s a tough injury to come back from. We don’t know his timetable. Always hoping for the best with him.""He’s been a hell of a teammate and a hell of a person while he’s been with us. Even off the field helping support so many things we’re passionate about. It’s definitely no dig or any smoke between us.” (via: Sportskeeda)Also Read: Trevor Lawrence's wife, Marissa, dismisses pregnancy rumors as her due date approaches In recent years, NFL teams have shown an increasing willingness to part ways with their hefty investments in star quarterbacks. Russell Wilson’s eye-watering contract didn’t prevent the Denver Broncos from moving on, and now the Atlanta Falcons are seemingly following suit, despite locking Kirk Cousins into a hefty four-year, $180 million deal with $100 million guaranteed this past summer.But when it comes to Deshaun Watson, the situation is far more complicated. His contract, often regarded as one of the worst in the league, presents a significant financial dilemma for the Cleveland Browns. If the team were to part ways with Watson this summer, his dead-cap hit for 2025 would skyrocket to a staggering $118.9 million—$92 million of that in cash. And the following year wouldn’t offer much relief, with the 2026 dead-cap hit reaching $53.8 million. These numbers would shatter records, standing as the largest dead-cap hits in NFL history.","Cleveland Browns signed Deshaun Watson to a five-year, $230 million contract.

Shawn Michaels On TURNING DOWN WWE Dream Matches

Shawn Michaels has been retired for many years now. However, WWE attempted to bring the Showstopper out of his retirement for dream showdowns with some of the legendary names in the business.Shawn Michaels will go down in history as one of the greatest in-ring performers of all time. The Heartbreak Kid had a illustrious 20+year career in WWE and retired in 2010 following his loss to The Undertaker in a ‘Career vs Streak’ match in the main event of WrestleMania 26.While Shawn Michaels did come out of retirement for one-off match after 2010, WWE had made more attempts to bring back HBK for more in-ring matches. This was recently confirmed by Michaels himself who elaborated on WWE plans to tempt him out of retirement.During an interview with Inside the Ropes, Shawn Michaels revealed that WWE pitched several times to bring him out of retirement for matches. One of them was against The Phenomenal One, AJ Styles. Michaels always maintained that he was retired, but WWE made constant efforts in case he changed his mind.Furthermore, the former four-time WWE Champion also stated that the only formal return that was pitched to him was to compete against either AJ Styles or his iconic rival, The Undertaker.As mentioned, Shawn Michaels came out of retirement to team up with Triple H to battle The Undertaker and Kane at WWE Crown Jewel 2018. The match was heavily panned for its poor delivery and performance by the veterans. This might have been another reason Michaels chose to never return to the ring again.Moreover, he seems content with his current role in WWE. Mr. WrestleMania is currently the Senior Vice President of talent in WWE NXT. He is majorly involved in the creative process and oversight with Matt Bloom and other top officials, shaping up the next generation of in-ring athletes and taking WWE NXT to greater heights the developmental territory has ever seen.Also read: WWE Throwback: Shawn Michaels retires with a heartfelt speech after losing the “Career vs Streak” match","Shawn Michaels retired in 2010 after losing to The Undertaker in a ‘Career vs Streak’ match in the main event of WrestleMania 26.

Nineteen-year-old Sam Konstas is set to debut in the Boxing Day Test, becoming the 468th Australian men's Test cricketer. This will make him the youngest Australian Test debutant since Pat Cummins in 2011.Konstas's inclusion was confirmed by coach Andrew McDonald on Tuesday, ahead of the fourth Test between Australia and India. He will be the youngest player to wear the Baggy Green since an 18-year-old Cummins debuted in 2011.Konstas struck 107 from 97 balls against India three weeks ago in a practice match. India's attack in Canberra that day included Akash Deep, Mohammed Siraj and Ravindra Jadeja.The last time Konstas played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, he made 73 not out for Australia A against India A.Konstas will become Australia’s youngest ever Test opener and fourth youngester debutant when he steps up to the MCG. But McDonald said he had the temperament to succeed.“He’s been very similar to what I’ve seen on the outside … he’s composed, relaxed,” McDonald said.“He’ll play Boxing Day, so I’ll get that one out of the way.“What he’s shown is an array of shots and an ability to put pressure back on his opponents.”However, Travis Head 's participation in the crucial Test against India is uncertain. He suffered a quad strain during the third Test at the Gabba.“He picked up a quad strain during the third Test at the Gabba.” said McDonald.McDonald expressed confidence in Head's recovery but acknowledged there were still fitness tests to be cleared. The coach remains hopeful Head will be fit to play.Head, who didn't train on Monday due to the issue, did get involved on Tuesday with a short stint in the nets when he received throw downs for about 20 minutes.Head had a lengthy chat with McDonald and team physio Nick Jones before returned to the dressing room.Other batters Steve Smith, Usman Khawaja and Marnus Labuschagne, meanwhile, had extended periods in the nets facing the likes of Mitchell Starc.Scott Boland is near-certain to replace Josh Hazlewood in the playing XI.

MCG curator reveals how the pitch will behave in Boxing Day Test

MELBOURNE: MCG curator Matt Page on Monday fended off allegations of having provided inferior practice pitches to India ahead of the Boxing Day Test , saying that it was ""standard procedure"" to provide fresh pitches only three days in advance of a Test.The Indian team took a break on Monday after two consecutive days of intensified nets session, although captain Rohit Sharma had an injury scare on the second of those days. Rohit was hit on the left knee after missing a throwdown. After the incident, pacer Akash Deep, who was also hit on the hand while batting, expressed some dissatisfaction with the pitches in the nets, saying, ""The ball was keeping a bit low at times. They look like white-ball pitches.""Page admitted as much, saying, ""For us, three days out, we prepare pitches for here. If teams come and play before that, they get what pitches we've had. So today, we're on fresh pitches (Australia had an optional practice session). If India had trained this (Monday) morning, they would have been on those fresh pitches. It's stock standard procedure for us, three days out.""Asked if he was aware of India's schedule, which was sent out two months in advance, and the need to change the procedure, Page said, ""Yes, they gave us the schedule. There has been correspondence between CA and Indian board and the extent of those conversations, I don't know.""There have been attempts by sections of the Aussie media to stir up minor controversies around the Indian camp leading into the Test, with Virat Kohli being criticized for stopping a reporter from filming his children and Ravindra Jadeja copping flak for not answering questions in English.Former player Simon Katich became the latest to join the bandwagon when he suggested ""mind games"" were being played by India. ""Obviously, there's been a few things unfolding in the last week or so that haven't gone down well at that (India) camp. It's probably just the mind games being played, given the enormity of this series,"" Katich said.As for the MCG pitch, Page said it would be a ""rinse and repeat job,"" meaning pace, bounce and carry if recent trends are anything to go by. Page, however, said it would not be as ""lively"" as some Sheffield Shield pitches earlier in the season.""In 2017, we sat down as an organization and discussed where we wanted to go and we agreed that it was about producing wickets for thrilling Test matches. It gives bowlers a chance to come into the game but also batters if they play well. All quick bowlers get excited when they come here now, although it's not as quick as Perth or Brisbane, but we've managed to get some pace on it,"" Page said, adding that spinners wouldn't get much help. ""It doesn't really break for spinners. If you see long-format games over the last four to five years, it has been more seam-friendly than spin.""There's a heat wave alert for Boxing Day, with temperatures expected to exceed 40 degrees, but Page said preparations wouldn't be affected. ""It's been factored in. As we know with Melbourne, the weather can change quite quickly. It might quicken up more than it would if it was 20 degrees. Whether we'll leave a bit more moisture in it, I can't say at this stage.""","MCG curator Matt Page says it is ""standard procedure"" to provide fresh pitches only three days in advance of a Test.

Questions linger over the format's feasibility but for now, the five-day game is enjoying a fine run in Australia. The

contest will only ramp up the expectations

MCG CEO Stuart Fox: 'We're going to go well over 2,50,000 through the gates'

MELBOURNE: The 'G' is calm. The picturesque Yarra Park offers shady trails and a pleasant afternoon breeze. In the distance, Melbourne's famous trams roll by. They are the soul of this city's public transport, not relics of a bygone era like elsewhere. People walk their dogs. An old lady sits on a bench, reading a book. Even the usually frenzied cyclists take a minute to slow down and soak in the vibe. In the distance, there's the sound of bat on ball.A nets session is on. The players are dressed in Test-match whites. It's open to public viewing. The superstars are training. There are people watching but there's no heckling, no mad rush for a glimpse. The pace is unhurried.It's the calm before the storm. Come Thursday, for the first time in an Australian summer, the 90,000-capacity colosseum that is the Melbourne Cricket Ground will see a full house for a Boxing Day Test . Across this rare five-Test series, it has seemed as if the crowds just can't stop pouring in. Even in Brisbane, where rain marred the contest on all days, the Gabba notched up the highest total attendance for a non-Ashes Test at 91,195.Earlier, Adelaide broke the record for an India-Australia Test match as 1,35,012 total spectators turned up for the pink-ball Test. In Perth, the opening two days broke attendance records.It's become fashionable to run the Test format down but talk to young fans across venues and there's no moaning over the format's length. Here, during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy , it's a good time to be a cricket traditionalist. Yet, peel away the layers and concerns linger over the future. This is a marquee series between two top teams on a strong financial footing and boasting a rich tradition. Even here, though, in the commentary boxes, in the members' stands, among the top cricket brains soaking in the action, there are murmurs of concern.Why are only the top teams playing so many Tests? Why are there so many uneven contests? Why is the format being allowed to fade away in the poorer cricketing nations? Why is it so hard to prepare a perfect Test-match pitch these days? Why aren't players playing out sessions anymore? Should there be four-day Tests? And most important of all, will the format still be financially viable if India loses interest?Through the course of this series, the questions have always lingered, and some of Australia's top cricketing minds have weighed in on the issue. Greg Chappell , former India coach, former Australia captain, has taken the pragmatic view. He believes it's a blessing, not a curse, that the big teams are playing the most Tests.""It's important for India, South Africa, Australia, England to at least keep playing Test cricket, otherwise the T20 format can completely take over,"" he said. ""The top players still love playing Tests, but it's the rung just below that which is vulnerable. These players can play 20-over cricket, even 50-overs, but Tests are sometimes too hard for them. We forget how hard it is to actually play Test cricket.""Chappell believes the decline of the West Indies, not the birth of One-Day Internationals, was a huge blow. ""One of the tragedies has been losing West Indies. Sri Lanka have declined because they don't produce enough fast bowlers. They just need to look towards India. In the last 15 years or so, India have made a focus of producing pacers. Now they're beating everybody everywhere,"" he said. Former Australia heavyweight Adam Gilchrist said the attitude of modern batsmen has altered the natural rhythm of the format.""It's been a really entertaining period of Test cricket to watch. Is it very difficult for batters to be defensive these days? I have a different theory here. They've got the ability to do it. At this level, they also have the skills to do it. It's just a mindset thing,"" he said.""In general, teams are playing a more attacking style of Test cricket. There were teams in previous eras who could do that too, but there's definitely been an effect of T20 cricket filtering into long-version cricket. The best players still know when they can slow down a bit, when they've got more time.""Gilchrist is convinced four-day Tests would work better. "" Michael Vaughan (former England captain) mentioned that maybe you can have four-day Tests. That will help with scheduling and workloads. Then you can put it in the calendar, like a weekend thing. It's very hard to follow any Tests, where it's on, when it's on. Maybe there's something in that idea to invest in. I think we're going to see more and more shortened Tests just because of what we spoke about, the attacking part.""The legendary Allan Border , an Australian institution, has a different view. ""Sometimes the pitches dictate the contest,"" he said. ""Four-day Tests would be a bit artificial. You won't get the 300s, the guys making the big scores. No one wants boring draws but with five days, you really get the time to resolve matters. The wickets have to be more natural. I'm also not sure Pakistan have declined along with the rest. They just need a good captain to bring it all together, like when they had Imran Khan . The West Indies have become a T20 team.""In the end, like Chappell said, ""the administrators are going to go with the money"". This has been an interesting year for Test cricket in general, with West Indies beating Australia in Brisbane, India winning in Cape Town, New Zealand whitewashing India, Bangladesh beating Pakistan in Pakistan, Pakistan beating England. Even India beating England at home was an absorbing series earlier in the year.The BCCI poured money into the format to keep players interested. The World Test Championship race has been intriguing. However, smaller teams kept slipping away because of broadcaster disinterest. It's unclear how the ICC's mooted 'Test match fund' will work. Tests have ceased to be a level-playing field.This has been a frenetic series so far, so perhaps the biggest question going into the MCG Test is, how long will it last? With huge demand for tickets, broadcasters would want a longer game but as always with Tests, there are no guarantees.Happily, for now, Test cricket seems to be in its natural habitat here in Australia. Much like the Melbourne weather though - blazing hot one moment and bone-chilling the next - there could be turbulence ahead.","Questions linger over the format's feasibility but for now, the five-day game is enjoying a fine run in Australia.

Jacob Bethell: A 'generational talent' in the making?

Caribbean roots, cricketing dreams

The evolution of Jacob Bethell: From classy Test batter to explosive white-ball cricketer

Stadium Walkthrough series: Inside The Gabba

What can RCB expect from young Bethell?

NEW DELHI: The cricketing fixture between Rugby School and Marlborough College, two of Britain’s most historic independent schools, is a cherished tradition in the English sporting calendar. Dating back to the mid-1800s with the only recent interruption being the COVID-19 pandemic, which disrupted life as we knew it, this storied rivalry holds a special place in the hearts of cricket buffs across Wiltshire and Warwickshire.In 2021, during one such historic encounter, English cricket was on the brink of discovering what Indian spinner R Ashwin has recently described as a potential ""generational talent"". The player in question? None other than Royal Challengers Bengaluru 's newest Rs 2.6 crore recruit, Jacob Bethell .Representing the shades of Rugby School, where he honed his cricketing skills after moving to the UK, Jacob Bethell chose the first innings of the annual two-day fixture to demonstrate his overall mettle. With a stunning knock of 202, he caught the attention of many, including Michael Powell, Rugby School’s Director of Cricket and a former Warwickshire captain.""We had scored over 400 before tea on the first day, with Jacob contributing 200 of those runs. He was playing at a different level from everyone else that day. Then, he went on to take nine or ten wickets in the match as well. The way he went about his business was remarkable,"" recalled Michael during an exclusive interaction with TimesofIndia.com.Michael Powell, however, finds it hard to decide what is more remarkable — the dazzling innings from that fixture or the meteoric rise of young Jacob Bethell, now 21.Over the past few months, Bethell has achieved what few can claim: making his ODI, T20I, and Test debuts within the span of just three months. Even more striking, he became the first English batter since Mike Gatting in 1978 to earn a Test cap without a first-class century to his name, showcasing the high regard in which England Cricket holds him.Coach Michael is a firm believes that his protégé Jacob is destined for greatness. Hailing from a family deeply rooted in cricket — his father and grandfather both being former professional cricketers — Jacob has justified his decision to leave the Caribbean and test his legacy with the willow in the UK.""I took a call from a good friend of ours who was on a cricket tour in Barbados - a cricket tour that I had set up at my previous school in Scotland but had subsequently left. This friend, whose sons were in my boarding house because I was a housemaster there, said that there was a young boy, about 11 years old, who was smashing all their 17-and 18-year-old bowlers around Barbados at the moment. He used to work with the boy's father, Graham Bethell, and that was my first point of contact,"" shared Michael.""He put me in touch with Graham and Giselle Bethell, Jacob's parents, and we started a dialogue. Eventually, they brought Jacob to Rugby School. I then took him over to Edgbaston, to Warwickshire, and introduced him to the academic director, Paul Greetham. That’s how it all began. They explored quite a few schools in the UK because Jacob had trained with the Franklyn Stephenson Academy before. Eventually, they decided on Warwickshire and Rugby School.""Recalling his first meeting with Jacob around a decade ago, the former Warwickshire cricketer continued, ""Jacob was only 11 years old when he first came to visit. He met me, and we had a great afternoon looking around the school. I had already seen a few videos that had been sent to me, including one that has since become quite famous on Instagram — showing him pulling shots as a very young 10-year-old batsman [batter] in the West Indies.""Barbados-born-and-raised, Jacob is known for being deeply family-oriented. The 21-year-old manages to carve out time for his father Graham, mother Giselle, and sister Rebecca, who followed her brother's footsteps and joined Cheltenham College a year later, marking a shared commitment to education and opportunity in the UK.The siblings spent around 32 weeks annually in the UK, dedicating the rest of the year to cherished family moments back home in Barbados.The cricketing blood in Jacob’s veins runs deep, with his father Graham spending many years playing for Sheffield Collegiate in England, where he was teammates with Joe Root ’s father, Matthew Root. Meanwhile, his grandfather, Arthur, was the former captain of the Barbados cricket team in the West Indies.""When he was growing up as a youngster, he probably had a bat in his hand by the age of three. Just the way he operated as a young player at the time — in all aspects, batting, bowling, and fielding — was remarkable. He had a really natural bat swing, as if the bat had been in his hands since his earliest days.""Growing up in Barbados, cricket was in the family and in his genes. He lived an outdoor life in Barbados, blessed with good weather. At home, he had a lovely little setup with a rope and a ball at the end of it, and he would spend hours swinging and hitting the ball. His bat swing was incredibly natural,"" noted Michael.Understood to be a natural athlete, Jacob grew up immersed in a variety of sports — surfing on the beaches of Barbados, playing cricket in the sand, and enjoying golf, tennis, and squash. His innate sporting talent has likely been a key factor in his seamless transition from a graceful stroke-maker in Test cricket to a dynamic power-hitter in white-ball formats.""His early setup and approach to batting were very much Test-match-oriented. As a young player, he was very respectful in how he played and left the ball, yet positive in how he looked to score. However, when he was younger, he didn’t have the power he has now. That’s something he’s gained over the last four or five years,"" explained his childhood tutor.From a young age, Jacob was incredibly stylish, particularly excelling against short-pitched bowling, having grown up facing tall West Indian bowlers who frequently bowled bouncers, which helped him develop his ability to handle the short ball.""I remember the first time I saw him bat — a tall West Indian lad ran in, bowled a bouncer, and Jacob pulled it away. Not many 9-or 10-year-olds could do that. He had a real fluency and fluidity in his bat swing, with great energy and rhythm in how he picked up and swung the bat. He handled taller, faster young West Indian bowlers remarkably well,"" Michael said.""His game has since developed to adapt to the modern game, particularly the white-ball format. Now, as we’ve seen more recently, he can hit the ball out of the park. When I first met him, he struggled to hit the ball off the square or in front of the wicket. He was fantastic with the pull shot and a great sweeper of spin bowling but lacked the physical power to pierce gaps in front of the wicket,"" he added, ""Of course, that power develops with time as a young player grows, and now he’s a strong, athletic young man. He has the ability to hit 100-metre sixes just as easily as he can play the softer game: rotating and manipulating the ball with finesse.""With RCB stacking up their top-order with right-handers, Jacob Bethell, as a left-hander, could be the perfect solution. With Virat Kohli and Phil Salt likely to open the innings, Bethell could slot in at No. 3, with Rajat Patidar following at No. 4, creating a balanced lineup. This versatility, along with his handy slow left-arm orthodox bowling and wicket-keeping skills, has many RCB fans predicting that the English talent will be a regular fixture in the playing XI.""To me, he always looked like a top-order batsman. He thinks like a top-order batsman. The nature of T20 cricket, The Hundred, and white-ball cricket, in general, has pushed him to develop his skills further. Fundamentally, his technique is built for Test cricket, but he’s also developed into a very potent white-ball cricketer. You could class him as an all-rounder or a top-order batsman who bowls very effectively, keeps wicket and fields brilliantly,"" Michael told TimesofIndia.comIn terms of attitude, Michael thinks he is a natural leader. ""As a youngster, Jacob was in England's senior team very early on, and he’s always been a natural leader by example. He’s in a fantastic environment, surrounded by the likes of Joe Root, Ben Stokes, Brendon McCullum , and Marcus Trescothick , who have all performed at the highest level for extended periods. He has the benefit of learning from some of the best minds in the game,"" he added.""For him to be put into the IPL auction, to be chosen, and to have the opportunity to play cricket in that environment is incredible. The IPL is the biggest league in the world, and now he has the chance to be around players like Virat Kohli,"" the man, who has seen Jacob blossom in front of his eyes, concluded.""I know Jacob is made for this—he’s been working toward this his whole life. It’s an incredible opportunity for someone who has put in so much effort. I’m sure RCB fans will thoroughly enjoy watching him, as he’s looking forward to becoming part of the RCB family.""","Jacob Bethell is Royal Challengers Bengaluru's newest Rs 2.6 crore recruit.

Fans protest with banners

KOCHI: The usual fanfare surrounding a home fixture of the Kerala Blasters at the Jawaharlal Nehru International Stadium was missing as they took on Mohammedan SC here on Sunday night. There was an unprecedented silence at the stadium when the Blasters players took the field for the match, as the home fans held the Blasters’ management responsible for their poor run in ISL this season.However, by the end of 90 minutes, Blasters not only rediscovered their winning touch by blanking MSC 3-0 but also managed to turn that silence into cheer from a small turnout of 15,000 who came in for a holiday fixture.With this win, Blasters are now in tenth spot in the points table with 14 points from 13 matches, while MSC remain at the bottom of the heap with five points from 12 matches.Though the first half of the game was more about missed passes from both teams, the dynamics changed after MSC goalkeeper Bhaskar Roy’s goalkeeping blunder helped Blasters open their account in the 62nd minute,. MSC defender Joe Zoherliana conceded a corner, which was taken by Adrian Luna. Goalkeeper Bhaskar Roy tried to punch the ball away but his mistiming saw the ball falling into his own net, giving the hosts a 1-0 lead.After conceding the lead, MSC were forced to attack, but they were guilty of opening up space in their defence, which Blasters striker Noah Sadaoui exploited. In the 80th minute, MSC failed to clear the line as Korou Singh, after receiving a pass from Luna, found Sadaoui with a long cross from the right. With a brilliant header, Sadaoui doubled the lead for Blasters.In the 90th minute, Alexandre Coeff, who came on as a substitute replacing Sadaoui in the 86th minute, scored Blasters' third goal. Coeff received a pass from Luna and beat Bhaskar Roy to complete the tally for the hosts.On Sunday, Manjappada, the official fan group of Kerala Blasters, stayed away from their usual stadium activities, including chanting and singing the anthem. Around 15,000 spectators turned up for the match, of which a group came with a banner that read ‘Leaders or Liars’, venting their ire at the team management.
