Punjab cross the 300-run mark

NEW DELHI: After enduring a series of low scores on his comeback to the domestic T20 tournament - Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy - as Punjab ’s captain, young India opener Abhishek Sharma produced a breathtaking counterattack on Sunday morning, hammering a record-breaking century against a seasoned Bengal bowling attack at the Gymkhana Ground in Hyderabad.Came out to open the innings after Punjab opted to bat first, Abhishek found his rhythm immediately. He blasted his way to a half-century in just 12 deliveries, launching into his former Sunrisers Hyderabad teammate and senior India pacer Mohammed Shami for 23 runs in a single over.The scale of the assault by the Punjab batter was astonishing. By the time he reached his fifty, the left-handed sensation had scored 50 of his first 51 runs in boundaries only, smashing five sixes and five fours to leave Bengal stunned.Alongside him, Prabhsimran Singh also fired up early, helping Punjab surge past 120 inside eight overs. Abhishek continued to muscle sixes straight down the ground, repeatedly targeting the V region with brutal precision.The carnage didn’t stop. Abhishek stormed to a century in 32 balls, finishing with 11 sixes and seven fours before reaching triple figures. This knock marked his eighth T20 hundred in 157 innings, bringing him level with Rohit Sharma.Among Indian batters, only Virat Kohli (nine) has more T20 centuries.Just last season, Abhishek smashed a 28-ball hundred against Meghalaya, the joint-fastest by any Indian in T20 cricket. He also struck 87 sixes in T20s in 2024, the most by an Indian man in a single year.With 16 sixes in this innings alone, Abhishek went past his 2024 tally, becoming the first Indian to cross 90 T20 sixes in a calendar year.Abhishek eventually departed for a spectacular 148 off 52 balls, with 16 sixes and eight fours, but not before powering Punjab to a score beyond 300. They have now become only the second Indian T20 side, after Baroda against Sikkim in 2024, to breach the 300-run barrier.",Punjab's Abhishek Sharma smashes a record-breaking century against Bengal.

"Parl forum for delivery, not drama, says PM Modi",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/parl-forum-for-delivery-not-drama-says-pm-modi/articleshow/125707046.cms,"Winter Session Of Parliament: Bills On Atomic Energy, Excise On Agenda; Oppn Gears Up For SIR

Modi: Some using Parl as extension of state politics

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Monday asked the opposition not to turn Parliament into a platform for venting its frustration over the crushing defeat in Bihar, emphasising that the legislature should be a place for delivery, not drama.“They (opposition) should consider that the country is not accepting the game they have been playing for the past 10 years. They should now change their strategy. I am willing to give them tips as to how they should perform,” he told the media at Parliament complex before the two Houses assembled for winter session.In a sharp takedown of opposition, which has conveyed its intention to disrupt parliamentary proceedings if govt does not agree to its demand for a discussion on SIR, PM Narendra Modi in his customary remarks before winter session began said some parties are using Parliament for “warming up” before polls and as an extension of their state politics.As opposition insists on a debate on SIR, Modi hit back saying he thought these parties would get their act together in the period since Bihar poll result but the defeat continues to trouble them. Similar protests from Congress, Left and regional parties had all but washed out the last session. “Parliament should be a forum for discussing policies and not raising slogans,” he said. These parties can raise slogans anywhere in the country as they did where they were defeated, and they can do where they are going to be defeated, he added.This winter session, he said in a message to the governing NDA members, should also not be a show of arrogance over the alliance’s victory. Modi’s jibe was as much aimed at Congress — whose member Rahul Gandhi led a yatra against SIR in Bihar before polls and framed his campaign around the charge of ‘vote chori’ — and regional parties like TMC, DMK and SP.While TMC-governed Bengal and DMK-governed TN are going to assembly polls in the first half of 2026, elections will be held in UP (where SP is principal challenger to BJP) early 2027. CPM-governed Kerala is also among poll-bound states. All these parties are united in demanding a discussion over the ongoing SIR of electoral rolls in 12 states and UTs.Turning up the heat on rivals, Modi, said, “I have seen that there is so much anti-incumbency against the parties in office in some states that they are unable to face the masses there. They are venting their anger in Parliament.” “Negativity,” he emphasised, “may help to some extent in politics but opposition should also contribute positively to nation-building and raise strong issues.”Citing high voter turnout in Bihar polls coupled with the country’s robust economic growth, he said India has shown the world that democracy can deliver. Modi lamented that first-time MPs are especially sad that they are unable to raise their issues and show their performance due to repeated and long disruptions in Parliament. He expressed hope that this session will not be seen as merely a ritual but energise efforts toward progress.","PM Narendra Modi asks the opposition not to turn Parliament into a platform for venting its frustration over the crushing defeat in Bihar.

NEW DELHI: Accusing PM Narendra Modi of “delivering dramabazi” on the first day of winter session of Parliament, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge said BJP govt has shattered parliamentary conventions over the past 11 years by refusing to debate issues of public concern and by bulldozing bills detrimental to the common man, like the farm laws. Opposition will continue to demand a discussion on ‘vote chori’ in the wake of deaths of BLOs, he stressed.Kharge said govt passed 12 bills without discussion in less than 15 minutes during Monsoon session, while the PM had remained completely silent on the Manipur turmoil till opposition was forced to move a no-confidence motion on the issue.“BJP should now end this drama of distraction and engage in debate on real issues facing the people. The truth is that the common man is struggling with unemployment, inflation, economic inequality and looting of the country’s precious resources, while those in power are playing the game of dramabazi in arrogance of authority,” he said.Slamming Modi’s hurling of “drama” jibe at opposition, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav asked if the death of BLOs is a “drama” too and if police-BJP nexus in UP polls which saw “cops flashing revolvers” to stop voters from voting was also a “drama”.Akhilesh demanded that EC pay Rs 1 crore compensation to families of BLOs who have died because of the stressful SIR exercise.Demanding a discussion in Parliament on SIR, he said, “There is chaos. BLOs were not properly trained to enrol voters. It is EC’s job to enrol voters, but here political parties are running around to ensure that voting rights are safeguarded.”He alleged, “SIR is being done to help BJP win after they lost (LS) elections. Big IT companies are helping BJP weed out voters and identify who should be included. In UP and Bengal, we can clearly see that BJP wants to oust voters at the booths where opposition parties won in (LS) elections.”","Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge said BJP govt has shattered parliamentary conventions over the past 11 years.

Jaxson Dart 's necklace: The deeper meaning behind a Giants good luck charm



Jaxson Dart's necklace sparkles during every New York Giants game, but beneath the bright stadium lights, it stands for something far more personal. This small piece of jewelry has been with him through bowl games, draft day expectations, and now the roaring NFL stage. It is never just part of his outfit. It is a ritual, a reminder, a heartbeat from home woven into every snap and every throw.He takes the field with confidence, toughness, and real emotion. It is a demanding job to step into the spotlight as a rookie quarterback in New York, but Dart brings a piece of family faith to steady him in every moment. That little chain carries a lot of heart.When asked about the necklace, Dart explains it openly. ""I haven't missed a game with it. I make sure it's one of the first things that I pack,"" Dart said. For him, it is not crafted from diamonds or forged by luxury jewelers. It is something much more meaningful. It came from his sister.He still remembers the moment he first picked it up. ""I remember I was walking out the door, and I was just grabbing my headphones, whatever it may be on the table, and I saw this necklace,"" he said. ""I looked at it and I was like, dang, I like that necklace. I asked my mom, I said, 'Whose is it?' And she's like it's your sister's.""That day, he wore it into a college bowl game and threw four touchdowns.From then on, it became tradition. ""It started out because I felt like it looked cool, you know, during the games. And that was kind of a swag piece that I'd put together each game day,"" he said. ""It's a good luck charm for sure. But at the same time, it's a cool thing between me and my sister.""Through every rough tackle and every triumphant first down, it stays with him. ""I try to do my best to adjust it if it's kind of messed up when I come back on the sideline,"" Dart said. ""It's definitely held its own because I've taken a lot of hits.""The hearts on the chain are not real gemstones, but they might as well be priceless. ""It's definitely very valuable to me, because like I said, it's a relationship thing between me and my sister,"" Dart said. Then he shared the meaning that goes beyond football. ""I've kind of thought of it as a deeper meaning to love all that you're around ... a special reminder that we live in a world where maybe not everybody agrees with everybody's opinion. I think that's kind of the beauty of our identity as people. But at the same time, I think it's important to share love and bring people together. So that's just kind of like the emoji of a heart, bringing people together and kind of spreading joy and love to all.""In a league full of glare and glitter, Jaxson Dart reminds us that the most powerful symbols are not worn for show. They are carried from home, from family, and from the people who held belief long before the world ever did.Also Read: While Drake Maye prepares for Giants, his wife Ann’s Patriots-themed cookies become unexpected pre-game sensation","New York Giants rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart wears a necklace as a good luck charm.

Leon Draisaitl and Connor McDavid still carry the Oilers’ offense

Leon Draisaitl made news when he gave a short and cold answer to people talking about the Edmonton Oilers’ leadership. A podcast online said the team’s top players, like Leon Draisaitl and captain Connor McDavid, were not showing enough strong direction when the team struggled. The video spread fast, and many fans talked about it. When Leon Draisaitl saw the clip, he replied with just one word: “Lol.” His reply was simple, but it got a lot of likes and showed he did not agree with the talk about weak leadership.The podcast hosts said the team’s main leaders should be the ones pulling everyone together during tough nights. They felt the Edmonton Oilers still leaned too much on older veteran players for guidance. They also said Draisaitl and McDavid are now older and should not need as much help. This started a big discussion because both players have already led the Oilers to long playoff runs.The Edmonton Oilers reached the Stanley Cup Final in both 2024 and 2025. Connor McDavid played a huge role and won major awards. Leon Draisaitl also had strong numbers and scored many big points. They were the two players who pushed the team forward each year.Because of this, some fans feel the criticism is unfair, while others think it is needed for the team to grow.But even with their talent, this season has not been smooth. The Oilers have been up and down. They have wins and losses that keep them in the middle. Their offense still shines because of Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl, who both continue to score and make plays. But the team’s biggest problem is still on defense. They give up too many goals, and the goalies face too much pressure each night. This hurts their chances to move up in the standings.Connor McDavid has many points this season and still drives the attack every game. Leon Draisaitl also has strong numbers and helps the team stay in games. Their power play is strong, and they create many chances. But offense alone cannot fix everything. The team needs better defense and better support if they want to reach the Stanley Cup Final again.Leon Draisaitl’s “Lol” reply showed he is not worried about outside noise.

How Leon Draisaitl and Mitch Marner have forced a rethink of what a true Selke contender looks like,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/how-leon-draisaitl-and-mitch-marner-have-forced-a-rethink-of-what-a-true-selke-contender-looks-like/articleshow/125696969.cms,"Leon Draisaitl shocks critics by surging into Selke race as Mitch Marner becomes unexpected defensive star (Getty Images)

Mitch Marner’s two-way transformation fuels Selke buzz while Leon Draisaitl rises as elite defensive force





The NHL ’s early stretch has shifted the spotlight toward a new kind of player impact. Coaches and analysts are tracking not just point totals, but how forwards influence momentum, shut down lanes, and change the pace of a game without requiring a highlight-reel goal. The result is a Selke Trophy race that feels more open and unpredictable than in recent seasons. It has allowed players typically viewed as offensive dynamos to showcase their defensive evolution, reshaping the conversation around who truly drives winning hockey.This year’s early standings have also highlighted a refreshing reality. When reputations take a back seat and performance speaks louder, new names rise. That shift has widened the door for forwards whose on-ice value extends beyond scoring touch, and it has pulled Leon Draisaitl and Mitch Marner directly into the heart of the Selke discussion.In a recent column assessing the Selke Trophy race, NHL analyst Dom Luszczyszyn of The Athletic placed Leon Draisaitl and Mitch Marner squarely in the top tier of defensive forwards. He laid out the early contenders through his Defensive Rating model and emphasized the chaos of this year’s race. “With no Aleksander Barkov this season, the Selke trophy race will likely be this season’s most fascinating,” he wrote, pointing to a rare window of opportunity for two-way excellence.His analysis positioned Nick Suzuki as the early leader, noting how effectively his presence suppresses opposing chances. Beyond Suzuki, Luszczyszyn paid attention to forwards whose defensive impact shows up in subtler ways. It was in this layer where Marner and Draisaitl emerged as standouts. Luszczyszyn stated that “Mitch Marner, Leon Draisaitl, and Matty Beniers have all put up excellent results,” reinforcing the credibility of their defensive progress.Draisaitl’s recognition comes during another season where he remains Edmonton’s offensive engine. Even with the Oilers enduring inconsistent stretches, Draisaitl has sharpened his engagements in the defensive zone. He reads plays early, supports defenders during sustained pressure, and uses his size and timing to disrupt transitions. These moments rarely appear in the box score, yet they have played a substantial role in stabilizing Edmonton when it matters.Marner’s shift is just as compelling. In Vegas, he has taken on more responsibility and handled it with poise. The trademark playmaking is intact, but now it sits beside strong pursuit habits and smart defensive recovery. Marner often turns defensive stops into fast-break opportunities, and that dual-threat element has boosted Vegas during tight matchups.The broader analysis also acknowledged sturdy campaigns from Mikael Backlund, Tyson Foerster, and Mika Zibanejad. Yet the standout story is how natural scorers like Draisaitl and Marner have layered defensive maturity into their game. They may not be traditional shutdown specialists, but they are proving that elite offense can live within a balanced, disciplined two-way identity.Also Read: Connor Bedard’s fearless statement after Ducks game shows he’s ready to change the NHL narrative","NHL analyst Dom Luszczyszyn placed Leon Draisaitl and Mitch Marner squarely in the top tier of defensive forwards.

“Such a low character player”: Fan outrage erupts over Cal Foote’s return as sexual assault case acquittal divides NHL community,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/such-a-low-character-player-fan-outrage-erupts-over-cal-footes-return-as-sexual-assault-case-acquittal-divides-nhl-community/articleshow/125706517.cms,"Cal Foote's return to North American hockey sparks debate following his acquittal in a sexual assault case. While reinstated by the NHL, his AHL signing with the Chicago Wolves has ignited fan backlash and cautious optimism. The hockey community is divided on whether performance can be separated from character, raising questions about redemption and trust.

Fan backlash, cautious optimism, and the bigger question of redemption in hockey culture

Cal Foote’s re-entry into North American hockey is emerging as a lightning-rod moment for the sport, touching not just on one player’s return but on how the NHL and its fanbase grapple with cases involving conduct, trust, and reintegration. After being acquitted in the 2018 Hockey Canada sexual assault case, Foote received NHL reinstatement, though the league was clear that the players’ actions “fell woefully short” of its standards.That lingering tone of condemnation, even alongside legal acquittal, has kept emotions high. Now that the Chicago Wolves have given Foote a one-year AHL deal, with the potential for a path back to the Hurricanes’ NHL roster, the hockey community is openly wrestling with whether performance and character can ever fully be separated in today’s game.Once the Wolves publicly stated: ""Defenseman Cal Foote has signed a standard AHL contract."", the internet reactions arrived immediately and loudly. Some comments were blunt and unforgiving, like “That’s disappointing” and “disgusting.” One fan went further, warning: “Keep him far far away from any of the Cane’s prospects… adding such a low character player is not a good decision.”Others echoed concerns about proximity to younger players, team culture, and locker-room influence.Yet there was also a contrasting pocket of support, comments like “Nice signing need more blue line depth” suggest that some fans are ready to move forward and judge Foote strictly on his performance, not past accusations.Foote’s strong season in Slovakia, 30 points in 38 games, makes him a hockey-asset on paper. But the backlash shows that for many, the story isn’t about stats; it’s about trust. The comparison to Carter Hart’s return adds context: cleared, reinstated, and telling fans, “I’m just looking forward to moving ahead… and showing the community here what I’m really about and my true character and who I am.”The NHL may have ruled on eligibility, but public acceptance is a separate court entirely. Foote’s challenge now isn’t just to play well, it’s to convince a skeptical audience that professional redemption can exist without erasing what came before.Also Read: Is Sidney Crosby engaged?

Auston Matthews’ captaincy questioned as former Leafs GM hints the team elevated the wrong figure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/auston-matthews-captaincy-questioned-as-former-leafs-gm-hints-the-team-elevated-the-wrong-figure/articleshow/125697194.cms,"Former Leafs GM slams current leadership and claims Auston Matthews was the wrong choice for captain (Getty Images)

Former Leafs boss criticizes leadership group and suggests Matthews isn’t the captain Toronto desperately needs





The Toronto Maple Leafs find themselves in a moment of uncomfortable reflection. What began as a bold shift in leadership by handing Auston Matthews the captaincy has now become a topic of pointed criticism, sparked by a former executive who feels the team lost its compass. The question drawing attention across the hockey world is simple. Did the Leafs pick the wrong captain, and are they now paying the price through uninspired play and fragile identity?Former Leafs GM Gord Stellick spoke plainly about the heart of the issue. He believes leadership and talent are not synonymous. He said, ""There's nothing wrong if your best player isn't a leader. All I can say is last year, you couldn't be more of a team guy, a classy guy, the way he (John Tavares) handled the transition, and then the leadership meant nothing, it's not even a visible thing. It's almost like an award to wear the C. "" His words echo the sentiment of many frustrated fans who now look back at that decision with uneasy hindsight.Stellick did not stop at questioning Matthews as captain. He revealed who he would have chosen. ""If you would have asked me a few years ago, I would've picked Morgan Rielly. He kind of strikes me as a captain, but its an important thing being the captain, and the leadership group is important.""Rielly has longevity and presence, but like Matthews, has never quite taken command of the locker room in that commanding way a captain must.Tavares remains the quiet constant. A professional who knows when to speak, when to deliver and when to let his play do the talking. Yet the captaincy shift forced him to take a step back in title, even if not in spirit. Stellick suggested the leadership change carried symbolism more than substance, raising the concern that the Leafs valued optics over intrinsic leadership dynamics.Still, accountability now rests on the current leaders.

Sitanshu Kotak press conference: Big statement on Virat Kohli, India win and more

Poll How challenging do you believe it is for bowlers to dismiss Virat Kohli once he settles in? Extremely challenging Moderately challenging Somewhat challenging

NEW DELHI: South Africa all-rounder Marco Jansen offered a candid and striking assessment of what it feels like to bowl to Virat Kohli , admitting that world-class batters of the Indian superstar's calibre become “almost impossible to stop” once they settle in. Kohli's masterful 135 in the first ODI in Ranchi not only powered India to a 17-run win and a 1-0 series lead, but also reaffirmed the challenge bowlers face against him — a challenge Jansen says leaves little room for error.Reflecting on the knock, Jansen said the only genuine opportunity a bowler has comes right at the start of a batter's innings.“When you bowl to world-class players, it's quite difficult to get them out. I always try to get a batter in his first 10 or 15 balls. That's when they're still getting used to the wicket,” Jansen explained.But with Kohli, he said, the equation changes rapidly.“Once they're in, and they get on a roll, it's very difficult to stop them. Everyone here knows how to play — that's why you go to plan B or C.”Kohli's 52nd ODI century on Sunday was classic Virat — tempo control, smart risk-taking, and an extended stay that he has made a hallmark of his greatness.For Jansen, the difficulty lies in the completeness of Kohli's batting.Jansen first bowled to Kohli as a 17-year-old net bowler during India's 2017–18 South Africa tour, and the impact remains vivid.“It's nice to watch him play. Growing up watching him on TV to actually bowling to him now… it's annoying but it's fun at the same time,” he said. “He drives well, he pulls well, cuts well, plays with his pads well. I don't think much has changed — he's just batting longer and longer.”On his own form, Jansen said a strong top order is giving him the freedom to express himself with the bat lower down. “I'm just watching the ball and playing it as it comes. At the moment it's working for me.”Despite trailing 0-1, Jansen insisted South Africa were “not disheartened”, saying the team believed they were “doing the right things” and only needed to stack good spells consistently. He added that injury updates would be clearer before the second ODI in Raipur, with Aiden Markram continuing to lead in Temba Bavuma 's absence.India and South Africa now shift focus to Raipur, where the high-stakes second ODI awaits.",Virat Kohli's masterful 135 in the first ODI in Ranchi reaffirmed the challenge bowlers face against him.

Sidney Crosby calls for change



The Pittsburgh Penguins are in a challenging phase this season, and Sidney Crosby’s voice has become the stabilizing force amid the turbulence. After their crushing 7–2 loss to the Toronto Maple Leafs on November 29, the frustration was evident. Yet, Crosby still managed to carve his name even deeper into hockey history with his 641st career goal on a night that otherwise few in Pittsburgh would want to remember. It was a reminder that even in defeat, he continues to produce greatness.That disappointment followed a season that began with thrilling promise. The Penguins raced into the 2025–26 campaign with energy that felt familiar, almost nostalgic. Crosby was scoring like the game’s most dominant force and Evgeni Malkin was setting up plays with the touch that once defined entire highlight reels. But by mid-November, the slide had already begun, and the rhythm that fueled their hot start faded.Crosby didn’t hide from accountability. After the loss to Toronto, he spoke directly about the core issue. “We must take care of prime scoring areas,” he asserted. “You cannot allow teams high-quality chances and expect to win.” It was a message rooted in experience. He has worn the captain’s voice through every stage of this franchise, from parades to painful rebuilds.His season, though, remains on an incredible trajectory. Crosby is pacing for a potential 55-goal, 92-point campaign, which would be his best goal scoring output since 2009–10. He continues climbing the record books. He now sits 15th on the all-time goals list. He already surpassed Steve Yzerman for ninth place in assists. He even registered his 500th multi-point performance, becoming the third-fastest player in NHL history to reach that mark.But numbers alone aren’t the story. Longevity is. These days, almost every Penguins game feels like another milestone evening. With Crosby, Malkin, and Kris Letang still sharing the ice more than two decades after their early ascents, the historic moments stack up in a blur. Fans know the names. They don’t need repeating. The city has watched them grow, and now watches them fight the clock.Crosby’s detailed response to how the team must improve resonated like a coaching directive. “Well, I think just focusing on making sure that the slot and the prime scoring areas, that we take care of that. Every team’s gonna have guys who are dangerous and they’re gonna be opportunistic, so you can’t give them chances of that quality and expect to win games. So I think just focus on our own end and let everything else kind of take care of itself. ”For Pittsburgh, this is now about urgency. Their defense needs reliability. Letang must rediscover steadiness. The blue line needs punch and presence. If this group wants one more Stanley Cup run, it won’t happen on skill alone. It will require the mindset Crosby still carries: responsibility, precision, and belief that this story isn’t finished yet.Also Read: Auston Matthews’ captaincy questioned as former Leafs GM hints the team elevated the wrong figure","Pittsburgh Penguins lost 7–2 to the Toronto Maple Leafs on November 29.

Why Cincinnati Makes Sense for Buxton

Astros’ Motive: Rotation Stability

Twins’ Return: Prospects to Support a Transition

Why the Deal Still Feels Unlikely

The Cincinnati Reds may be approaching the offseason with several areas to evaluate, but one need sits clearly above the rest: adding more power to a lineup that struggled to produce consistent thump. A new trade concept from MLB.com’s Anthony Castrovince puts forward a dramatic solution - one that involves making a push for Minnesota Twins star Byron Buxton through a multi-team blockbuster. It’s an idea built around the Reds’ pitching depth and the possibility of acquiring a dynamic, game-changing outfielder without diving into the expensive end of free agency.But the proposal isn’t limited to a simple two-team exchange. Castrovince outlines a three-team structure involving the Reds, Twins, and Houston Astros, each addressing a different roster priority. For Cincinnati, it’s about landing a high-impact bat. For Houston, it’s securing a mid-rotation arm. And for Minnesota, it’s about collecting a group of prospects to support their transition. The concept may be unlikely to materialize, yet it brings together several logical elements that make it worth exploring.Castrovince’s concept revolves around the Reds leveraging their pitching depth, the Astros reinforcing their rotation, and the Twins securing a wave of prospects.Here is how the deal would look based on the proposal:Buxton, who has spent his entire career with Minnesota, is seen as an ideal fit for a Reds club that has been searching for a dynamic bat. As Castrovince wrote, “Buxton would be perfect for a Reds team that could use its pitching depth to address a lineup in need.”One of the major selling points is Buxton’s contract. He is owed roughly $15 million annually for the next three seasons, a number that sits well below what top free-agent hitters will command on the open market. That affordability naturally increases his appeal across the league, though Buxton previously declared himself “a Minnesota Twin for life,” a statement that could complicate any trade discussions.Houston’s inclusion centers on adding right-hander Brady Singer, who is entering his final year of arbitration. The Astros are facing the likely departure of Framber Valdez in free agency, leaving a gap in the middle of their rotation. Singer fits both their competitive timeline and their payroll.Castrovince noted, “Singer, who is entering his final year of arbitration, does not fit a Twins team in transition but does fit an Astros team that needs an affordable mid-rotation arm.” (H/t: Sporting News)Minnesota’s role in the deal is centered on long-term roster building. The Twins would receive four prospects, two from Cincinnati and two from Houston: Tyson Lewis, Mason Neville, Walker Janek, and Cole Hrtzler. The organization is navigating a transitional phase, and a multi-prospect return aligns with their broader strategy.Even with the pieces seemingly aligned, the proposal faces a major hurdle - Buxton’s ability to veto a trade. His long-standing connection to the Twins organization and his recent comments make any potential move difficult to finalize.Also read: MLB trade rumors: New York Yankees could bag $30 million Milwaukee Brewers 2x All-Star to improve title odds ahead of deadline Castrovince admitted that this is likely a trade that never happens, though he added that the framework hits several logical points for all involved clubs.

Shedeur Sanders’ performance and mom Pilar’s unwavering support





Shedeur Sanders stepped onto the field for his first professional home start with the Cleveland Browns on Sunday against the San Francisco 49ers, and all eyes were on both him and his supportive mom, Pilar Sanders. The rookie quarterback, drafted in the fifth round despite high expectations, has already started making waves after a victory over the Las Vegas Raiders last week. Throwing for 209 yards, a touchdown, and one interception, Shedeur proved he could rise to the occasion when given the opportunity.This week, after being named QB1 over Dillon Gabriel, Sanders balanced preparation with family support. He spent time at his mother’s home with brother Shilo, enjoying home-cooked meals and studying film before the big game. But pregame attention wasn’t reserved for his on-field performance alone. Shedeur made headlines with a self-promoting outfit from his Legendary brand, and Pilar followed suit with a bold statement fit of her own. Browns fans and media couldn’t help but notice, as she continues to turn heads with her stylish game-day ensembles.Despite the cold, mom Pilar was at the stadium to cheer her star son on in person. She previously stole the spotlight during Shedeur’s NFL debut with a custom t-shirt, and Sunday’s winter-ready look was just as memorable.On the field, Shedeur completed 16-of-25 passes for 149 yards, adding a touchdown and a seven-yard rush. While the Browns fell short against the 49ers, the young quarterback’s potential remains clear.“Very committed to working at it, doing a great job, communicating with coaches, with the players,” Browns coach Kevin Stefanski said of Sanders. “Good work week, but nothing different. I think any player, though, once you get one game under your belt, you got the next one coming. I think it can only help.”Shedeur Sanders is not only focused on proving himself on the field but is also buoyed by the confidence and style of his mom. Whether he maintains the starting role for the rest of the season remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: Pilar Sanders will be there, front and center, cheering him on every step of the way.Also Read: While Drake Maye preps quietly for Giants, wife Ann’s viral gym photo brings unexpected buzz to Patriots fans","Shedeur Sanders made his NFL debut against the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday.

Phoenix Suns Injury Report vs the Los Angeles Lakers (December 1, 2025)

Los Angeles Lakers Injury Report vs the Phoenix Suns (December 1, 2025)

What to Expect in This Clash

The Los Angeles Lakers and Phoenix Suns collide on December 1, 2025, at Crypto.com Arena in a matchup carrying major Pacific Division implications. Phoenix arrives at 12-9, trying to snap a two-game losing streak, while the 15-4 Lakers ride into the night on a commanding seven-game win streak. With both teams searching for separation early in the season, injuries on each side could play a defining role in how this contest unfolds.This meeting also highlights contrasting storylines: the Phoenix Suns lean heavily on Devin Booker and Dillon Brooks to stabilize a roster depleted on the wings, whereas the Los Angeles Lakers enter with momentum, depth, and a potential return from one of the greatest players of all time. Add in Luka Dončić’s dominance and Phoenix’s NBA-leading activity in transition defense, and the stage is set for a tightly contested battle despite the teams’ differing recent trajectories.Phoenix Suns’ injury situation is clearer - and more concerning - heading into this matchup. The Suns confirmed two players as out and listed one as probable, continuing the trend of a narrowed rotation following losses to Oklahoma City and Denver.Jalen Green remains unavailable due to a right hamstring strain that has kept him out since early November. The timetable for his reevaluation stands at 4-6 weeks, limiting him to just two games this season. Isaiah Livers also remains sidelined with a right hip strain, a recurring setback that hinders the Suns’ bench depth and scoring options.A positive development comes with Ryan Dunn upgrading to probable after missing five games with a right wrist sprain suffered in a fall over Rudy Gobert. His 8.4 points per game and defensive presence provide Phoenix with much-needed energy. Mark Williams and Grayson Allen avoid the injury report entirely - Williams working past calf soreness from the Denver loss, and Allen returning from a quad contusion. With Booker averaging 25.7 points, Brooks contributing 21.5, and Allen adding 17.9 points and 3.8 threes per game, Phoenix leans heavily on its perimeter trio. Their ability to capitalize on the Suns’ league-best 10.6 steals per game will be critical.The Los Angeles Lakers had not submitted their official injury report by midday, but early indications point toward a positive update. LeBron James, who missed the first 14 games with sciatica and continued left foot management, is expected to suit up. In his four appearances since returning, he has averaged 16.5 points and 8.3 assists, with coach JJ Redick describing the situation as a past issue now under control. Marcus Smart’s back spasms made him questionable or out against New Orleans, though his status appears precautionary.Deandre Ayton, facing his former team, also appears ready to go after dismissing concerns about a minor knee bump. His recent 22-point, 12-rebound outing underscores his impact alongside Dončić, the league’s scoring leader at 35.1 points per game, and Austin Reaves, who is in the midst of a career-best season at 28.8 points per game. The Lakers also continue to keep Bronny James in the G League.Phoenix’s limited depth puts pressure on its starters, but the probable return of Dunn and a healthy Williams could disrupt LA’s interior rhythm and spark defensive momentum. Meanwhile, the Lakers’ explosive offense, supported by Dončić and Reaves delivering back-to-back 30-point performances, makes them difficult to slow down. The Suns’ ability to force turnovers—against an LA squad averaging 15.9 giveaways - may be their best equalizer. Tip-off at 10 p.m. ET on Peacock promises a high-energy battle shaped by star power, durability, and execution in crucial possessions.","The Los Angeles Lakers and Phoenix Suns collide on December 1, 2025, at Crypto.com Arena.

The scene around Lane Kiffin’s move to LSU already felt tense, but the spotlight has quickly shifted toward his daughter, Landry Kiffin. Her reaction to the backlash from Ole Miss fans has turned into its own headline, adding a personal layer to what was already a high emotion coaching departure. On the day Lane Kiffin was officially introduced as the head coach of the LSU Tigers, Landry took a shot at the angry Ole Miss Rebels faithful who have not handled the breakup quietly.Lane Kiffin’s exit from Mississippi ends a six season run that saw him build a genuine connection in Oxford. Landry herself attended school there and was even the emotional anchor that kept her father from leaving for Auburn in 2022. Yet on Monday, LSU rolled out the purple and gold carpet and made it official. Lane also admitted during his LSU press conference that “the last 48 hours sucked” and that he understands the wave of emotions from Ole Miss fans who watched him board that private jet toward a new chapter.Landry’s presence around Ole Miss football had always been friendly and popular. Fans loved her all white game day looks and the family atmosphere around her, mom Layla and Knox. That image shifted this season when she publicly confirmed her relationship with LSU star linebacker Whit Weeks right before Ole Miss faced LSU.She even skipped several of her dad’s games to attend Weeks’ instead, wearing LSU themed looks, including her white tiger style at Alabama. Photos even showed her in custom LSU gear, which already hinted that her loyalty was drifting.There were more breadcrumbs. She reportedly showed up at an LSU booster event last week before the news broke. Then, while Ole Miss fans in Oxford were venting and airing their bitterness, Landry was in Nashville at a friend’s birthday party filming TikTok dances. She even missed the Egg Bowl and Knox’s playoff game. After the LSU announcement, her first post was a sarcastic jab at the critics where she wrote, “Wish I could be as creative as angry football fans 🫶🏻“ followed by the hashtag “#itsnotthatdeep. ”Oxford once embraced the Kiffins as family. Now the relationship feels fractured.

Song Sung-mun gives Los Angeles Dodgers a young and affordable third-base choice

Song Sung-mun is now linked to the Los Angeles Dodgers as the team looks for new help after winning two straight World Series titles. Several Korean news outlets reported on November 20, 2024, that the Dodgers are studying the third baseman after the Kiwoom Heroes posted him. The Dodgers want younger players for the future, and they want to prepare early for the 2026 season.The front office sees Song Sung-mun as a cheaper choice than Munetaka Murakami, who could cost around $90 million. Song Sung-mun is expected to sign for about $12.5 million. With Max Muncy turning 35 and Miguel Rojas turning 36 in 2025, the Dodgers want fresh legs in the infield. The team also had the oldest Opening Day roster in 2025 with an average age of 31.48.From 2015 to 2024, Song Sung-mun worked for the Kiwoom Heroes. In 2024, he rose to team captain; he finished with a remarkable.315 batting average, 26 home runs, and 90 RBIs.Even if the Heroes finished last in the KBO at 47–93, Song Sung-mun still had one of his finest years and collaborated with Los Angeles Dodgers utility player Hyeseong Kim and San Francisco Giants outfielder Junghoo Lee during his tenure with Kiwoom.Reports from Seoul say the Dodgers are also watching Munetaka Murakami and Yomiuri Giants hitter Kazuma Okamoto as possible third-base options.But Song Sung-mun stands out because he costs much less and still offers solid hitting and defense. Scouts believe he fits the Dodgers’ long-term plans since he is younger and can take on a full season at third base.Los Angeles Dodgers star Tommy Edman also shared news about his health on Tuesday when he joined “The Sedano and Kap Morning Show” in Los Angeles.Tommy Edman talked about the ankle surgery he had earlier in November. He said, “It’s doing all right. I recently got the surgery, so hoping that fixes it for good. They said everything went smooth.”First hurt the ankle in April 2025, missed time until mid-May, then reopened it in August. For two weeks he was on the injury list and returned in September for the playoff run.Tommy Edman primarily played in the center infield in 2025 because of his injury in order to avoid lengthy runs in the outfield. After recovery, the Dodgers hope he can be at full strength.Also Read: Bo Bichette Contract Talks Hit Another Pause After Analysts Explain Major Risks Facing The Toronto Blue Jays","Song Sung-mun is expected to sign for about $12.5 million.

Travis Kelce’s uplifting message arrives during a tough stretch for Kansas City as the star tight end remains a stabilizing force

In the middle of an up-and-down NFL campaign, Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce carved out a moment away from the grind to celebrate a special milestone for longtime friend and media personality Pat McAfee. The ESPN host announced that he and his wife, Samantha, are expecting their second child, a baby boy due in June 2026, after a long and emotionally demanding IVF journey. McAfee shared the news with a heartfelt Instagram message detailing the difficult road the couple travelled to expand their family. Kelce, never short on enthusiasm, jumped into the comments with a lively burst of support that instantly stood out amid thousands of congratulatory notes.McAfee’s announcement resonated deeply across the sports world, largely because of the vulnerability he expressed. He revealed on Instagram that the path to this pregnancy “was filled with needles, hormones, countless appointments, and more emotion than we ever knew two hearts could hold,” adding that IVF “pushed my body to its limits and stretched our spirits in ways we never expected.” When he concluded by saying they are “overjoyed to share that we are expecting a baby boy,” Kelce wasted no time firing off an energetic, “Let’s goooo!!! Congratulations!!!”The timing of Kelce’s celebration is notable. The Chiefs have stumbled to 6-6 after a narrow 31-28 loss to Dak Prescott and the Dallas Cowboys on Thanksgiving Day, a game that once again exposed Kansas City’s struggle to close out high-powered opponents.While frustration builds around the team, Kelce has remained one of the few constants, posting 59 receptions for 719 yards and five touchdowns through 12 games. His production has not only steadied the offence but has also surpassed his touchdown total from last season.Now, with a must-win Week 14 matchup against the Houston Texans on December 7 looming, the Chiefs are fighting to stay alive in a tightening AFC playoff race. But Kelce’s reaction to McAfee’s joyous news offered a reminder that even amid on-field turbulence, moments of genuine happiness still carry weight—and sometimes, three excited words are enough to say it all.Also read: “ Kelce’s last season”: Travis Kelce ignites retirement battle with statement performance against Cowboys","Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce congratulated ESPN host Pat McAfee on Instagram.

Anthony Davis Delivers a Three-Word Message to His Former Coach

JJ Redick’s Challenge: Coaching Against His Former Star

Anthony Davis Faces His Old Team in a “Revenge” Matchup

The bonds between NBA players and coaches often extend beyond team changes or on-court battles. Even when careers move in different directions, genuine respect can remain intact - somethingmade clear after he faced off against his former team.Friday’s matchup between the Dallas Mavericks and the Los Angeles Lakers wasn’t just another regular-season game. For Anthony Davis, who was traded last season in one of the biggest deals of the year, it carried emotional weight. Not only was he up against the franchise he once anchored, but he was also competing against JJ Redick, the first NBA head coach he ever played under.Following the Mavericks’ loss to the Lakers, Anthony Davis was asked about Redick and his experience competing against him for the first time since the trade. His response was simple but telling: “That’s my guy.”Davis went on to explain that despite the distance and the changes, his relationship with jj Redick remains strong. The two haven’t had the chance to sit down and talk this season, but Davis recalled a brief interaction they shared in Las Vegas when their teams met earlier. According to him, both expressed interest in having a longer conversation at some point.He reflected on their time together during Redick’s debut season as a head coach in 2024-25, describing it as a period where both sides were still learning each other.Davis said Redick was figuring out his coaching style and preferred systems, while he was simultaneously trying to understand the game plans and how they applied to him and the rest of the roster. He made sure to add that despite no longer playing for him, he wishes Redick “the best for sure. ”JJ Redick probably felt conflicted about the game. In his debut season under Redick, Anthony Davis was a force, averaging 25.7 points, 11.9 rebounds, 2.1 blocks, and 1.3 steals per game in 42 games. He contributed significantly to the Lakers' competitiveness prior to the trade deadline by shooting an effective 52.8% from the field.Yet on February 2, the Lakers made the blockbuster decision to send Davis to Dallas in exchange for 26-year-old superstar Luka Doncic - a move that reshaped both franchises.Naturally, Davis entered Friday’s matchup with extra motivation. But while he contributed 12 points, five rebounds, five assists, and three blocks, the Los Angeles Lakers ultimately secured a 10-point win, leaving his revenge incomplete.Also read: NBA star Josh Hart robbed as $185K jewelry heist targets New York Knicks guard in a shocking SoHo incident Still, the bigger takeaway wasn’t the final score.

Toronto’s defence struggles without Chris Tanev, Morgan Rielly takes on bigger role



Tanev stretchered off after awkward hit - Full Incident

The Toronto Maple Leafs are feeling the full impact of Chris Tanev’s absence, and the timing couldn’t be more damaging. Known for his cool presence on the blue line and ability to stabilise pressure in the defensive zone, Tanev’s injury has left a noticeable gap in the team’s structure. Without him, Toronto has struggled to regain control in crucial moments, raising concerns as the playoff race intensifies.Defensive inconsistencies have become increasingly evident, with opposing teams exploiting hesitation and rushed decisions. Toronto’s lack of composure without Tanev has resulted in costly errors, making it difficult to string together consistent wins. As the season moves into a decisive phase, every mistake carries more weight, making his absence one of the team’s most challenging setbacks.Morgan Rielly has shouldered increased responsibility as Toronto’s longest-serving defenceman, recording an impressive 20 points in 24 games. However, growing concerns over his defensive positioning have raised questions about his reliability in high-pressure matchups, underscoring the urgent need for stronger support on the blue line. Jake McCabe has remained consistent and defensively sound, but beyond him, depth issues are becoming harder to overlook.Carlo has shown potential but struggles with consistency and physical edge, while Simon Benoit brings size and strength but offers limited overall impact.Injury call-ups Dakota Mermis, Philippe Myers, and Troy Stecher have delivered mixed performances. Myers has been the weakest link, often exposed in defensive sequences, while Stecher has been the most dependable of the trio, though still not strong enough to compensate for Toronto’s broader defensive concerns. Meanwhile, Oliver Ekman-Larsson has emerged as the Maple Leafs’ most effective defenceman this season, using his offensive instincts to provide valuable contributions from the back end, despite not being a traditional shutdown option.Chris Tanev’s eventual return is expected to bring much-needed stability, helping Toronto manage pressure situations and improve clearing along the boards. Still, relying solely on one player won’t be enough. For the Maple Leafs to stay competitive in the playoff race, the entire defensive group must elevate its game—tightening zone coverage, making smarter reads, and winning more puck battles. If internal improvement fails to materialise, a move for an experienced defenceman could become a necessity as the trade deadline approaches.At this stage, Toronto’s playoff hopes depend not only on Tanev’s recovery but also on how quickly the rest of the defence responds in his absence before their opportunity slips away.Also Read: The untold story of Connor Bedard and Mason McTavish: Friendship that fuels one of the NHL’s most exciting rivalries","Chris Tanev’s injury has left a noticeable gap in the Toronto Maple Leafs’ defence.

Mike Majlak has spoken up to stop a big rumor that spread fast after SteveWillDoIt appeared on Logan Paul ’s Impaulsive podcast. The rumor said that Mike Majlak gave SteveWillDoIt alcohol during the taping, which many people believed was the reason the show went out of control. The episode became very messy online, and fans on both sides shared many posts about it. Because the talk kept growing, Mike Majlak decided to show the real truth.On Instagram, he posted a behind-the-scenes video from the Impaulsive set. In the clip, SteveWillDoIt can be seen asking for a cigarette or tequila during the interview. Logan Paul quickly told him that smoking was not allowed. Right after this, Parker, who is SteveWillDoIt’s manager, walked up with a bottle of tequila. This made it clear that Mike Majlak did not give Steve alcohol, and that the rumor was wrong.After sharing the video, Mike Majlak also posted a screenshot of an Instagram user who accused him of using SteveWillDoIt’s drinking problem for views. Mike wrote in his caption that the rumor was “categorically untrue.” He said he was open to talking about the episode and how things could be better next time, but he needed to fix the false story because he had received many messages about it.The rumor grew stronger after SteveWillDoIt posted Instagram Stories calling Mike Majlak the “biggest loser ever,” and also calling him fake and a bad person. This pushed more people to believe that Mike gave him alcohol on the set.All of this started last month when SteveWillDoIt, whose real name is Stephen Deleonardis, was asked to leave the Impaulsive studio. Many of his words were censored, but Logan Paul told him he had crossed the line and needed to calm down. When Steve kept talking, Mike Majlak said they should end the show and thanked him.Later, Logan Paul said on the show that he was shocked no one had hit Steve and that he would have slapped him if they were not filming.

Okay, so imagine minding your own business, scrolling through your feed, and suddenly Stefon Diggs pops up calling Cardi BNot “bae,” not “my girl,” but wife in Spanish. And he wasn’t even trying to make a viral moment. He was casually ordering hoodies for Cardi and their newborn son, and dropped the line like it was nothing. But the internet? Oh, it absolutely stopped breathing. Now everyone wants to know whether Cardi and Diggs tied the knot without telling us. Let’s break down the moment that has every fan playing detective.The clip that started it all shows Stefon Diggs ordering hoodies for Cardi B and their newborn son, cute enough already but then he casually calls herAnd that ONE word flipped the internet upside down. Fans instantly clipped it, translated it, slowed it down, zoomed in, and basically treated it like evidence from a court case.The tone wasn’t dramatic or even performative. Diggs said it with the confidence of a man who knew exactly what he was saying, and that’s why people can’t stop replaying it. It felt soft, intentional, and low-key romantic which explains the chaos that followed.Diggs calling Cardididn’t come out of nowhere. Their relationship has been public, fans adore them as a couple, and they just welcomed a baby boy together. So the “wife” line naturally refueled ongoing speculation that they may have quietly gotten married.People already had suspicions earlier when Diggs posted clips of him and Cardi dancing bachata, sparking “are they newlyweds?” conversations. So when he used the word esposa, fans took it as confirmation. But as of now, there’sofficial announcement, no ring reveal, and no paperwork in sight. If anything, it looks like Diggs using the word as an affectionate nickname but that hasn’t stopped the internet from planning their imaginary wedding album.The timing of the clip also mattered. Cardi B and Stefon Diggs recently welcomed their first child together, a baby boy making this one of their softest public family moments yet.For fans who have watched their relationship evolve, seeing Diggs order matching hoodies for Cardi and the baby felt like a wholesome dad move. It added warmth, emotion, and “OMG he’s obsessed with her” energy to the moment. And that made the “wife” label hit harder than it already did.Whether they’re legally married or not, one thing is clear: fans are fully invested in Cardi and Diggs’ family era, and this “mi esposa” clip only added fuel to the fire. Expect more viral moments because this duo stays winning the internet without even trying.Also read - “She’s never beating the gold digger allegations”: Fans roast Kayla Nicole after saying she’s done with athletes and now eyeing team owners","The viral moment where Stefon Diggs called Cardi B his wife left fans spiraling.

Washington Wizards Injury Report vs Milwaukee Bucks (December 1, 2025)

Overall Impact on the December 1 Matchup

Thewill enter their December 1, 2025, regular-season matchup against thewith renewed urgency, looking to build momentum after snapping a prolonged losing streak. The game will carry significant weight for Milwaukee, not only for standings but for their confidence as they continue to navigate a challenging first quarter of the season. With injuries shaping both teams’ rotations, the matchup is expected to be heavily influenced by player availability and depth.For the Wizards, the contest will represent an uphill climb from the outset. Their rough 2-16 start to the season has been marred by constant injury setbacks, undermining their ability to maintain consistency or competitiveness. Facing a Milwaukee squad regaining rhythm - and potentially with its superstar back - Washington’s road to an upset appears increasingly steep as tip-off approaches.Milwaukee Bucks’ primary concern will center around Giannis Antetokounmpo, who is listed as probable despite nursing a left adductor strain first suffered on November 17 against the Cleveland Cavaliers. Even with the lingering injury, the two-time MVP recently delivered an impressive performance, logging fewer than 19 minutes and still putting up 29 points in his return outing.The Bucks will be cautious with his workload, fully aware of how vital his two-way presence is as they attempt to stabilize their season.Beyond Giannis, the Bucks will manage a relatively thin rotation. Taurean Prince remains out indefinitely after undergoing neck surgery, while Mark Sears will be unavailable due to his G League assignment. These absences will limit Milwaukee’s flexibility, placing additional responsibility on complementary contributors such as Ryan Rollins and Myles Turner. Still, with a decisive win over the Brooklyn Nets already boosting team morale, the Bucks will enter the contest eager to shed their sub-.500 standing.The Washington Wizards will arrive with a far more troubling injury sheet. Sharife Cooper will be sidelined with a right calf strain, Corey Kispert will be out with a fractured right thumb that will keep him unavailable for several weeks, and Tre Johnson will continue to miss time due to a strained left hip flexor. The team will also face uncertainties regarding Alex Sarr, who is questionable with right adductor soreness, while Will Riley is doubtful because of a sacral contusion. These accumulating injuries will leave Washington’s rotation severely depleted at a time when they desperately need stability.Also read: Is Giannis Antetokounmpo playing tonight vs the Washington Wizards? Latest update on the Milwaukee Bucks star's injury report (December 1, 2025) Giannis’ presence alone will significantly shape expectations. Averaging 30.9 points, 10.9 rebounds, and 6.6 assists per game, he remains the heartbeat of Milwaukee Bucks’ success. With secondary scoring stepping up around him and the Washington Wizards lacking depth and scoring options, the game will highlight how health and availability can swing competitive balance. The contrast between Milwaukee’s cautious optimism and Washington’s mounting challenges will set the stage for a pivotal early-season clash.","The Milwaukee Bucks host the Washington Wizards on December 1, 2025.

Coach Tourigny supports Clayton Keller during an extremely difficult time

Clayton Keller is going through one of the hardest times of his life, but the captain of the Utah Mammoth, who just lost his father, Bryan Keller, has decided to go on the ice the very next day. The matchup against the Dallas Stars is emotional for Keller, who is a 27-year-old star forward, but it is also a decision based on loyalty and his inner strength. Keller, who has already scored 21 points in 24 games this season, has always been the emotional support for the Mammoth, and his decision to play shows both his commitment to the team and the ties he has with his father.The word came out very fast and left the team in shock. Keller's father died unexpectedly in his sleep, and it was an extremely deep sorrow for the whole Keller family. But Keller was firm that he did not want to leave his mates and, at the same time, he wanted to pay tribute to his father by continuing to play. This very difficult case has only added to the aura of the player who is famous for his leadership, coolness, and grit. Thus, he becomes a greater being in the eyes of the league and the locker room.Utah Mammoth coach Andre Tourigny, who became the organization’s spokesperson on Friday, was also the one to give a really touching speech that mainly stressed Keller and his family.Tourigny pointed out that the team's first concern is to support their captain in the midst of his great loss. He emphasized over and over that no words can truly express the suffering Keller is undergoing, but that presence and loyalty are the most important things. Tourigny says, “Clayton wants to play and be with the team” and that the Mammoth will be there for him in every way they can.Tourigny pointed out that the real loyalty is revealed during the hardship, stressing that the Mammoth consider themselves a family first and a hockey team second. His communication clarified that the whole organization is together with Keller, honoring his choice and at the same time making sure that he gets the support he needs.During a period characterized by sorrow, Keller’s decision to go on and Tourigny’s calm direction reflect the strong trust and bond that exists in the Mammoth organization.Also Read: NHL Updates: Marcus Foligno placed on injured reserve, will miss upcoming games for Minnesota Wild","Clayton Keller, captain of the Utah Mammoth, lost his father, Bryan Keller, on Friday.

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has revealed his annual holiday reading list as the 2025 comes to a close. Gates has recommended five books and he believes that all these titles spark curiosity and reflection during the quieter days of the winter season. “Each of these books pulls back the curtain on how something important really works: how people find purpose later in life, how we should think about climate change, how creative industries evolve, how humans communicate,” wrote Gates.In the blog post, Gates has also explained that holidays are the perfect tome to slow down and also catch up on reading. “There’s something about the quieter days around the holidays that makes it easier to sit down with a good book,” he wrote. His list on 2025 book recommendations reflects on his fascination with how the world works and how you can start a great conversation.The book belongs to the fiction genre and its a story of an aging janitor and a wise octopus captive hime with its empathy and storytelling. “Van Pelt's story made me think about the challenge of filling the days after you stop working—and what communities can do to help older people find purpose,” said Gates.The books explains about the climate challenges. The book structures 50 big questions on climate change, nuclear power and renewables. “ I’ve followed Hannah’s work at Our World in Data for years, and her new book is one of the clearest explanations of the climate challenge I’ve read. She’s realistic about the risks but grounded in data that shows real progress,” said Gates.It is a memoir which recounts the Diller’s extraordinary career in Hollywood, media, and technology, blending personal anecdotes with reflections on power, risk-taking, and the evolution of entertainment and digital industries. “He’s spent his life betting on ideas before they were obvious, and the industries he’s transformed show how much those bets can pay off,” said Gates.The book explains about the mysteries of human behaviour and how people communicate. “Although the topic itself is pretty complicated, the book is readable and practical, and it made me see everyday social interactions in a new light,” added Gate.The books offers a glimpse of at why America seems to struggle to build things and what it will take to fix that. The book argues that progress depends not just on good ideas but on the systems that help ideas spread.","Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has revealed his annual holiday reading list as the 2025 comes to a close.

Poll Which T20 league do you think has the highest level of competition? ILT20 SA20 BBL BPL

In its short but eventful journey, the ILT20 has fought for breathing room in cricket’s most congested window — going head-to-head with the SA20, the Big Bash League (BBL) and the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL). Players are forced to choose, schedules collide, and the tug-of-war grows each year. Yet, amid the chaos, the ILT20 has carved out its own turf and is quietly thriving, brick by brick.On Monday evening at the captains’ press conference at the Dubai International Stadium, the ILT20 trophy sat between two generations of cricketing stars. On one side were Sharjah Warriors captain Tim Southee, MI Emirates skipper Kieron Pollard and stand-in MI Emirates captain Moeen Ali . Opposite them stood Dubai Capitals’ acting captain Gulbadin Naib, Desert Vipers skipper Lockie Ferguson and Abu Dhabi Knight Riders captain Jason Holder . At the centre glimmered the ILT20 trophy, a reminder of what the six teams will battle for under the desert lights over the next few weeks.Former West Indies all-rounder and MI Emirates captain Kieron Pollard, one of the OGs of T20 cricket, refused to rank the ILT20 among other franchise tournaments.""It's a tough question,"" Pollard said in response to the TimesofIndia.com query about where he would rank the ILT20 among other competitions he has featured in.""I don't want to rank it. You don't want to put a number on where a tournament is ranked. Each tournament has its own, however way you like to put it.""This tournament will have a lot more international players because of where it is situated. Again, it is a great tournament where you see the best of the international players playing at this time of the year as well, with other tournaments around. So in itself the competition is going to be very, very high. So, I am not going to put a number on it,"" he says.Pollard, who has taken over the reins from fellow West Indies superstar Nicholas Pooran, adds: ""We love the place itself. The UAE is always exciting, and it's a good place to play cricket, which gives us an added incentive.""ILT20 CEO and former New Zealand cricketer David White said that the tournament has grown significantly in the last three years and will only get better.""The quality of cricket is going to be really high with nine overseas players per team,"" he says.In this year's tournament, the league has also included players from other Gulf countries like Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.""Now we've also introduced some Kuwait players and Saudi players as well. And we see the future of this league being very much a Gulf region league, not just the UAE,"" he says.White’s words were echoed by Laxmi Shetty, Head – Advertisement Revenue, Broadcast and Digital, Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. Laxmi, in an exclusive interaction with TimesofIndia.com, said the tournament has grown into the world’s second most-watched T20 league, and the addition of three Indian players is expected to further boost its global and Indian viewership.""The season has actually grown year on year. We've seen viewership growing across the globe. It's the second most-viewed league, I would say, globally,"" she says.""From an India point of view, with three Indian players coming in, it would only add more to the viewership. India is a very big cricket-loving country, so this is another big opportunity for the fans,"" she explains.Laxmi also revealed that the tournament has now started making a recovery after not making any money in the previous three editions.""Every tournament takes 3-4 years (to break even) and having seen that, yes, I'd say we're on track for recovery. In fact, much more. Recovery is not just about money. There is also an entertainment portion on the channels. This cricket is also some kind of entertainment.""We broadcast on all the movie channels, and it is free viewing and streaming on Zee5. So it gets you a new set of audience as well, which will benefit us in the future as well. So there are two types of benefits,"" she says.Gulf Giants head coach Jonathan Trott believes the ILT20 is moving in the right direction and with so many international players in the league, it will only enhance the skill sets of the local players.""Well, you just looked today at the captains’ and coaches’ meeting. You look at the quality of coaches around the league and the other sides. You look at the quality of captains that are there. You have Pollard and Tim Southee, a vastly experienced international player here in the tournament,"" says Trott in a free-wheeling conversation.""For the local players, they have the best opportunity in the world to learn and watch some of the greatest players, certainly in this format and in franchise cricket. You're going to get a vast number of local players getting that exposure in a dressing room, in a hotel environment, in the gym — watching, learning, talking. So I think it can only grow, and hopefully that transcends onto the field,"" says Trott.Giants bowling coach and former New Zealand great Shane Bond calls the ILT20 a ""unique"" tournament.""I think it's a unique league because you have so many overseas players from different countries, and obviously you've got the local players,"" Bond tells this website.""That's the part that I really enjoy — seeing the local players get the opportunity to play in the league. So I think it's the responsibility of the cricket communities to bring a whole lot of different countries up, and this is a league that's definitely helping those UAE players,"" he says.""To come here, and for me as a coach, it's also a little bit more challenging because you're dealing with things like language, culture, trying to bring people together. And so it gets you to think about your own coaching and how you go about it. I mean, it's invigorating,"" adds Bond.Gulf Giants' England all-rounder Moeen Ali, whose side lifted the trophy in its inaugural edition, said his local players will hold the key to the team's success.""The quality has gone up, and I'm excited to be part of a new team. We've gone in a different direction with our players. I think what's important is how good our local players are, and we're hoping to get back to where our squad belongs, which is competing for the title,"" Ali says.In this edition, the ILT20 has invited seven emerging African associate players as net bowlers.The initiative offers young talents from Botswana, Uganda, Sierra Leone, Rwanda, Kenya, Nigeria and Tanzania rare access to elite environments, training alongside international stars across ILT20 franchises.The selected group features Katlo Piet (Botswana) with Sharjah Warriorz, Juma Miyagi (Uganda) with Gulf Giants, Samuel Conteh (Sierra Leone) with Sharjah Warriorz, Martin Akayezu (Rwanda) with ADKR, Francis Mutua (Kenya) with Desert Vipers, Peter Aho (Nigeria) with Dubai Capitals, and Mohammed Yunusu Issa (Tanzania) with MI Emirates — a diverse cohort stepping into cricket’s biggest learning curve.The tournament will kick-start on UAE National Day with a rematch of last season's final between defending champions Dubai Capitals and Desert Vipers.","ILT20 CEO and former New Zealand cricketer David White said that the tournament has grown significantly in the last three years. In this year's tournament, the league has also included players from other Gulf countries like Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Former West Indies all-rounder Kieron Pollard refused to rank the ILT20 among other franchise tournaments.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125709322,imgsize-118400,width-400,resizemode-4/ilt20-captain.jpg"

Musk, India, and the worldview behind the children



So how exactly is Shivon Zilis Indian?



The Musk dynasty after the podcast







When Nikhil Kamath sat down with Elon Musk, everyone expected the usual: a little H-1B talk, a little Starlink optimism, a little population-crisis sermon. What nobody anticipated was the moment that detonated across Indian social media. Musk casually acknowledged that one of his children is half-Indian through Neuralink executive Shivon Zilis, and the internet declared it the real highlight of the episode.Within hours, the conversation shifted from satellites and semiconductors to Musk’s gene pool, which now includes a tiny but symbolically powerful Indian branch. The memes were instant. The pride was disproportionate. And India, without lifting a diplomatic finger, had found itself woven into the Musk family saga.It helps that Musk’s family tree is not so much a tree as a continent. Four mothers. Fourteen children. A naming style that feels like a collaboration between Greek mythology, computer science, and a baby-name generator that malfunctioned. And a parenting philosophy that treats reproduction as a form of civilisation maintenance. The podcast simply reminded the world that this is no ordinary family, and that India has now entered the story in the most unexpected way.Shivon Zilis has always maintained a calm, almost monastic presence in Musk’s otherwise chaotic narrative. She is an AI researcher, a Neuralink executive, and the mother of four of Musk’s children. What many people had not fully processed until the Kamath podcast resurfaced the fact is that Zilis’s mother is of Indian origin.One offhand remark from Musk, one clip on social media, and India suddenly felt like it had gained a new, unofficial ambassador in the Musk household. Not through politics or policy, but through lineage. Even by Musk’s standards, it was an unintended plot twist.One detail that rarely gets attention is the physical world these children inhabit. Zilis moved into Musk’s vast Austin compound in 2023, a property large enough to raise a small civilisation and quiet enough to stay out of the tabloid circus. Multiple Musk children live there, forming a strange hybrid of family, futuristic commune, and personality cult.If someone pitched this as a Netflix series, it would be described as equal parts Silicon Valley fable and sci-fi domestic drama.Musk’s first marriage brought six children, including twins and triplets. Their story had tragedy, IVF struggles, and a long divorce that shaped Musk’s early years as a parent.This was the era of X, Y, and Tau. A relationship built on art, technology, and surreal naming conventions that eventually unravelled into a messy custody battle.The quietest and most intriguing partnership. Four children. A shared interest in brain-machine interfaces. A mixed Indian-Canadian heritage that the internet has now placed front and centre. A move to the Austin compound that marked the creation of a new household cluster.The most controversial twist. A conservative influencer who revealed she had a child with Musk in 2024. The public reaction was immediate and intense, amplifying the drama already surrounding Musk’s ever-expanding family.During the podcast, Musk repeated his belief that the world’s biggest problem is declining birth rates. He admires India’s demographic strength and insists that civilisation survives only if people have more children.This belief is not theoretical for him. It is operational. He lives it. His fourteen children are not just family. They are an ideology in motion. And the India angle adds an unexpected cultural layer to a man whose personal life already reads like an experiment in futuristic parenting.Her mother is of Indian descent, giving her a mixed heritage that rarely featured in coverage of her work. Zilis is not the flamboyant, festival-posting, diaspora stereotype. She embodies the quieter, intellectual version of Indian ancestry that finds its way into global spaces without making a sound.It is only because Musk mentioned it so casually on Kamath’s show that the world suddenly connected the dots. And India, which never lets a global cultural tie go to waste, adopted the detail with full enthusiasm.The family remains the same. The list of names remains the same. The pace at which children appear probably remains the same.What has changed is the narrative. India now sits inside the Musk family tree, not through a boardroom deal or a Tesla factory, but through the lineage of one woman who built her career around AI.Kamath went in expecting a tech conversation. Musk gave India a genealogical cameo. And the internet, as always, made it larger than life.","Musk casually acknowledged that one of his children is half-Indian through Neuralink executive Shivon Zilis.

Sitanshu Kotak press conference: Big statement on Virat Kohli, India win and more

KOLKATA: Carrying his Test form with the bat into the ODIs, Marco Jansen looked a little disappointed not to see his team cross the line despite a powerpacked batting effort on Sunday. The 25-year-old Proteas all-rounder, however, felt players like Virat Kohli make all the difference as it’s very difficult to bowl to them according to set plans.“When you bowl to world-class players, it’s quite challenging to dismiss them. I always aim to target a batter in his first 10 or 15 balls when they are still adjusting to the wicket,” Jansen said after South Africa suffered a 17-run loss chasing 350 for victory in the first ODI at JSCA International Stadium.“That’s when they’re still getting used to the wicket. But once they are in, and they get on a roll, it’s very difficult to stop them. Everyone here knows how to play — that’s why you go to plan B or C.”“It’s nice to watch him (Kohli) play. Growing up watching him on TV, bowling to him during the 2017 series as a net bowler (along with his twin brother) to actually bowling to him now — it’s annoying but it’s fun at the same time. He drives well, he pulls well, cuts well, plays with his pads well.I don’t think much has changed — he’s just batting longer and longer,” added Jansen.Asked if they could have bowled a little better on the day, the lanky leftarm pacer said, “We didn’t bowl too badly. They (India) got early wickets, we were on the back foot, then we pulled it back. It’s just about adding the good things on top of each other like we have been doing in the Test squad.”",South Africa suffered a 17-run loss chasing 350 for victory in the first ODI at JSCA International Stadium.
