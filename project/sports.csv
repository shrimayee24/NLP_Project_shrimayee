Charming Figure in the Crowd

Swift and Kelce's Future Programs

Ross Travis , Travis Kelce ‚Äôs best friend is filling out for the star NFL player who is away with playing football. Due to Kelce‚Äôs football engagements, Ross has been quite visible in Swift's life, which is sending tongues wagging among the fans.Pop superstar Taylor Swift opened up the final leg of her much-talked-about Eras Tour with three shows this weekend in Miami. But Lady Luck wasn't on her side as her beau, Travis Kelce, will miss out on these defining games for the Kansas City Chiefs tight end, who had a schedule conflict with his commitment to the NFL.Also Read - How NFL Players Invest Kelce missed Swift's concert, so the former tight end of the Kansas City Chiefs took it upon himself to bring in support for Swift. He can be seen spending his time because he was happy with what was happening during the concerts while honouring his best friend. That status brought up the rumour among fans, as some joked that Ross took Travis's place in the whole love story unfolding between Kelce and Swift.Ross had a great time during the concert because he wore a 'Tortured Poets Department' hoodie from Swift's official merchandise line. That attired, chosen as this fits the identity of both fans and the news needed someone related to both Swift and Kelce-so engrossing more fuel for the rumors surrounding the three.Upcoming performances on her tour for the Eras, Taylor Swift will be performing on October 25 in New Orleans at the Caesars Superdome. Meanwhile, the football player Travis Kelce is preparing for what may be a do-or-die game on October 27, as his Kansas City Chiefs will take on the San Francisco 49ers. The two remain quite busy; fans are therefore looking forward to when they might appear together again.Also Read - Record Breaking Viewership of NFL","Ross Travis, Travis Kelce's best friend, is filling in for the star NFL player who is away with playing football.

Brett Lee: 'Take Mayank Yadav to Australia if...',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/take-mayank-yadav-to-australia-if-brett-lee/articleshow/114506811.cms,"(PTI Photo)

'India don't want to bow down'

NEW DELHI: Brett Lee , a legendary fast bowler known for his devastating pace, strongly believes that if Mohammed Shami is unavailable for selection, Mayank Yadav should be included in the Indian squad for the upcoming tour of Australia. Lee has high expectations from the young Indian pace sensation, particularly on the true and bouncy pitches in Australia.India, who are aiming to secure a spot in their third consecutive World Test Championship (WTC) final, will be traveling to Australia next month to defend the Border-Gavaskar Trophy .However, there are uncertainties surrounding the selection of experienced seamer Mohammed Shami for the five-match Test series.""I can tell you that batters are okay when you bowl that 135-140 kmph speed, but when you bowl high 150s, I don't care who it is, no one wants to face that.""He looks like someone who is a complete package, if Mohammed Shami is not ready, at least get him (Mayank) in the squad. I think he would do pretty well on these Australian wickets,"" Lee told Fox Cricket.Shami's last appearance was in the ODI World Cup final in November, and despite his recent intense training sessions the Indian captain Rohit Sharma is reluctant to include him in the squad for Australia if he is not fully prepared.Lee is well-versed in the challenges batsmen face when confronting high-speed deliveries.Lee said, ""The great thing is with me that I get to work on the IPL and see a lot of good young Indian cricketers. Mayank Yadav, to watch his first IPL game recently, hit 157 kmph first up in his first game.""Unfortunately, his franchise probably brought him a little early and he did his side again.""They put him in cotton wool for a bit. The great thing about India is that they are not worried about how much cricket someone has played or hasn't played, if he is ready to go, get him in there. I actually love that theory,"" Lee added.India possess a formidable bowling lineup capable of challenging Australian batsmen on their home turf. Lee recognized the potency of the Indian bowling unit.""Ashwin is approaching 600 wickets, he has got that beautiful shape when he bowls spin. He can bowl with the new ball as well but I think if India have to win there, then Shami (provided he is fit) can definitely hold the key.""Jasprit Bumrah, we all know how good he is, he can bowl both ways, he is a great exponent of reverse swing. Mohammed Siraj knows how to make the new ball talk.""On wickets like Perth, Adelaide, for me it's the combination, these three fast bowlers with Ashwin as the spinner. Then they have got options with guys like who are part-time spinners. But you need to have those three quicks firing if India wants to win,"" Lee said.Lee described the Indian team as a ""powerhouse that refuses to bow down"" to any opponent, issuing a warning to his fellow Australians ahead of their clash with the Asian giants starting on November 22.His comments followed India's eight-wicket loss to New Zealand in the Bengaluru Test earlier this week.""This day and age, India is a powerhouse that don't want to bow down. They know how to win, and they know they can beat Australia; they know they can beat the Kiwis. They know they can beat anyone on any given day,"" Lee said.Reflecting on India's performance in the Bengaluru Test against New Zealand, Lee suggested that they might have been influenced by the 'Bazball' approach, which led to some loose shot selection.""India just didn't go into their shell. Maybe it's Bazball brushing off on other cricketers around the world,"" he noted.""I know that India won't be proud of the way they played. They played some pretty loose shots.""India's decision to bat first in overcast conditions raised concerns, as the team was dismissed for just 46 in the first innings of the opening Test - their lowest Test score at home.Lee remarked that the team needs to ""weigh up the risk factor"" and emphasized that the Indians should have assessed the conditions more carefully.""But, you've got to weigh up the risk factor as well. There are times when you've got to go, 'Okay, well, maybe the big shots aren't working today'.""Maybe, just rein it in a little bit. I don't think they sort of summed up the conditions as quickly as what they should have done,"" Lee said.India play two more Tests against New Zealand -- Pune (October 24-28) and Mumbai (November 1-5) -- before leaving for Australia.","Brett Lee believes that if Mohammed Shami is unavailable for selection, Mayank Yadav should be included in the Indian squad.

PALLEKELE: Skipper Charith Asalanka struck an unbeaten half-century as Sri Lanka defeated the West Indies by five wickets in the second one-day international on Wednesday to clinch the three-match series.Chasing a tricky 190, Sri Lanka reached the target with 34 balls to spare at the Pallekele stadium, with Asalanka making an unbeaten 62 off 61 balls.The match was reduced to 44-overs a side after the start was delayed by two hours because of rain.Sri Lanka lost two early wickets but they were rescued by a third wicket stand of 62 between Nishan Madushka (38) and Sadeera Samarawickrama (38).Asalanka then saw the team through with his doughty knock that included one six and seven fours.He also brought up his 14th ODI half-century in the process and shared a stand of 55 with Janith Liyanage (24) for the fifth wicket.This was Asalanka's second consecutive half-century, following his match-winning 77 in the first ODI.The victory secured a 2-0 series win for the hosts, having won the opening game by five wickets on Sunday.This was the fifth successive bilateral ODI series win for Sri Lanka this year and the tenth consecutive home series victory.The third and final match will be played at the same venue on Saturday.Earlier, Sherfane Rutherford (80) shared a record 119-run partnership for the ninth wicket with Gudakesh Motie (50 not out) to lift West Indies from a precarious 58-8 after they were put in to bat in overcast conditions.This was the highest ninth-wicket partnership for West Indies in one-day internationals, eclipsing the 85-run stand between Yannic Cariah and Alzarri Joseph against New Zealand in Barbados in 2022.Rutherford, dropped twice on 23 and 72, hit four sixes and seven fours in his 82-ball knock for his second successive half-century of the series and his career-best ODI innings.Motie's maiden ODI half-century included six fours, before the visitors were bowled out in the 36th over.Leg-spinner Wanindu Hasaranga claimed 4-40 on a pitch that offered variable bounce and turn.","Charith Asalanka hits unbeaten 62 as Sri Lanka beat West Indies by five wickets in second one-day international at Pallekele.

India's captaincy under scrutiny



India Women and New Zealand Women are gearing up for a three-match ODI series in India, just two days after the conclusion of the 2024 Women‚Äôs T20 World Cup. New Zealand enters the series with high spirits, having claimed their first-ever T20 World Cup title, while India is looking for redemption after a disappointing group-stage exit in the same tournament.This ODI series will serve as a crucial warm-up for the upcoming Women‚Äôs ODI World Cup, which India is set to host in 2025.The White Ferns, fresh off their championship victory, will be full of confidence, especially after their dominant win over India in their T20 World Cup opener. On the other hand, India will aim to turn the tables and regain momentum ahead of the major tournament next year.New Zealand has included wicketkeeper Polly Inglis, who has received her maiden call-up for the series. Additionally, batter Lauren Down is making her return to the squad following her maternity break in July, adding further strength to the team. On the Indian side, wicketkeeper Richa Ghosh will miss the series as she prepares for her class 12 board exams. Leg spinner Asha Sobhana is unavailable due to injury, and all rounder Pooja Vastrakar has been rested for the series.The India vs New Zealand Women's ODI series will be broadcast live on Sports 18, with live streaming available on the JioCinema app and website.Harmanpreet Kaur's leadership will be under the spotlight following India‚Äôs underwhelming performance in the T20 World Cup. Speculations regarding her future as captain have been circulating, with some suggesting that the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is considering a change in leadership. However, this ODI series presents a crucial opportunity for Harmanpreet to reassert her command and guide India to a strong performance against the World Cup champions.","India Women and New Zealand Women are gearing up for a three-match ODI series in India.

üî¥ LIVE: Can India Bounce Back in Pune? | KL Rahul and R Pant to Enter IPL Mega Auction 2025

PUNE: Idealism and modern cricket don't go hand in hand.Those who have bought season tickets for the second Test between India and New Zealand, starting at the Gahunje stadium on Thursday, will be hoping that the match enters the fifth day. But they may have to recalibrate expectations.The venue has a history of only two Tests.The first in 2017 against Australia was over on the third day, with India being all out 105 and 107 and left-arm spinner Steve O'Keefe taking a match haul of 12-70. In the second, India beat South Africa on the fourth day in October 2019.The Gahunje pitch is not expected to be as lively as the one in Bengaluru, but it will provide the spin spice. How severe the bite will be is the question. India head coach Gautam Gambhir termed the strip as a ""typical Indian pitch"" where both batters and bowlers have to ""do their jobs"".He said that reading the pitch and reading too much in to it can be hazardous and no one could precisely predict the behaviour of any surface.Veteran cricket watchers don't want a premature finish to five-day Tests and hence doctored pitches and over-aggressive batters are looked at as culprits.But even the first Test in Bengaluru last week ended in four days, despite having a great pitch, if we take into account the fact that the first day was entirely washed out.Many things have to fall in place if a Test is to last the distance. That means evenly matched teams, a good sporting wicket having the potential to last five days and a just reward system for guts, gumption, patience and defensive technique over thrill.Even on a good wicket, it's the batters who play for a draw and not the bowlers.""Draws are boring. The teams are going for wins these days. Decisive games are fun,"" said Gambhir. Wins carry handsome points (12) too in the race for the World Test Championship final. The draw gets only four points.Dying by the sword is not looked at as taboo. Speed is the buzzword. Applying the slow squeeze is out of fashion, especially if other paths are available.Gambhir himself batted for almost 11 hours (137 runs, 436 balls) in the Napier Test of 2009 and eked out a memorable draw for India.""The T20 cricket had just started around that time. Now, the batsmen are conditioned to play shots. It's understandable and natural evolution. We can't complain too much about it.""The Kiwi middle-order batsman Daryl Mitchell said, ""We were taught to play defensive shots first, which is no longer the case now.""The famed yesteryear draws with dogged batting contributions was also a result of time-wasting tactics and not completing enough overs over five days.Now, umpires and match referees are given powers to ensure that at least 430 overs are bowled over five days if time is not lost due to weather intervention.","Second Test between India and New Zealand starts at Gahunje stadium on Thursday.

NEW DELHI: In one of the greatest turnarounds in Test cricket history, India overcame adversity to clinch a memorable 2-1 series win against Australia during the 2020-21 tour.After the humiliation of being bowled out for their lowest-ever total of 36 in Adelaide, many wrote the team off, especially with captain Virat Kohli departing after the first Test for the birth of his first child.However, under the leadership of stand-in captain Ajinkya Rahane , India mounted a remarkable comeback, securing a thumping eight-wicket victory in Melbourne before sealing the series with a thrilling three-wicket win in Brisbane.Looking back on the defining moments of the series, Kohli, in a video shared by Star Sports, admitted to being anxious ahead of the second Test but was soon swept up by the team's incredible performance.""I will be very honest. Before the Melbourne Test, I was a bit anxious, but then the way the whole team played in Melbourne, I was cheering every ball. Jumping up from the couch every now and then as well, every time a wicket fell. Probably not as loud as I am on the field but still the cheers were loud enough,"" Kohli shared. ""So, Melbourne was the game that I really felt like this is exactly what the team needed.""India's resurgence in Melbourne, led by Rahane‚Äôs composed century and stellar bowling from the likes of Jasprit Bumrah and Ravichandran Ashwin , set the stage for one of the most iconic comebacks in cricket. Ravi Shastri , the then-head coach, revealed the mindset he instilled in the team after the Adelaide disaster.""I think, one of the mornings where I said 'wear that 36 as a badge'. So that you never forget it when things are going your way, cash in and make the most of it. Melbourne turned it around. The win coming on the back of the 36 so quickly really lifted the spirit,"" Shastri recalled.Kohli was full of praise for the stand-in skipper Rahane and the squad.""The character and the belief shown by the whole squad‚Äîa group of young guys, which was led beautifully by Jinx (Ajinkya Rahane) in those three Test matches,"" Kohli said, highlighting the mental strength the team displayed in bouncing back.As the series continued, India drew the third Test in Sydney and pulled off a stunning three-wicket victory in the final Test in Brisbane. Reflecting on the series, Shastri went as far as calling it the biggest moment in Test cricket.""You talked about Indian performances. I will go one step forward: 'I don't think cricket has seen anything like this or anything bigger than this‚Äô. And that includes world Test match cricket. I don't think you would have seen anything as big as this,"" Shastri declared, emphasizing the enormity of the achievement.",India beat Australia 2-1 in one of the greatest turnarounds in Test cricket history.

Nothing makes me happier than playing for my country.""Kohli recently achieved a significant milestone by becoming the fastest player to reach 27,000 international runs.He accomplished this feat during the Kanpur Test against Bangladesh.Kohli surpassed Sachin Tendulkar's record, reaching the milestone in 594 innings, 29 fewer than Tendulkar's 623 innings.",Hardik Pandya recalls India's encounter against Pakistan in the 2022 ICC Men's T20 World Cup.

NEW DELHI: England skipper Ben Stokes faced some amusing confusion with a Pakistani reporter ahead of the third Test match against Pakistan.As the England captain prepared to discuss his team's performance, the reporter struggled to frame a question about England's impressive 823-run total from the first Test in Multan, specifically inquiring whether Stokes believed his team could replicate that feat in the upcoming third Test.Stokes found himself asking the reporter to repeat the question three times, leading to palpable confusion in the room.Watch:Despite the language barrier, Stokes maintained a humble demeanour as another Pakistani reporter claimed that the Englishman met the reporter after the press conference and apologized for all the miscommunications.With England looking to bounce back from the defeat in the second Test, Stokes on Wednesday emphasized the importance of the upcoming match, noting that the spin-friendly conditions at Rawalpindiwill likely play a crucial role in determining the outcome.Stokes expressed confidence in his trio of spinners‚ÄîJack Leach, Shoaib Bashir , and Rehan Ahmed‚Äîstating, ‚ÄúWe don't know exactly how the wicket will play, but we've taken as much information from it as we can.""As both teams prepare for the decisive encounter, Pakistan have retained their spin-heavy bowling lineup of Sajid Khan , Noman Ali, and Zahid Mahmood , supported by a sole fast bowler.With Pakistan hoping to build on their spin success from the previous match and England looking to dominate again, the pitch conditions will be pivotal.Stokes highlighted the need for both teams to bat first, stressing how spin will become more significant as the match progresses.With Pakistan aiming to turn around a disappointing year in international cricket, a victory over England would signal a significant turnaround in fortunes.Pakistan head coach Jason Gillespie echoed Stokes‚Äôs sentiments, stating that the near-bald pitch is expected to favour slower bowlers, meaning that Pakistan will be looking to take good advantage of their home condition once again.","Ben Stokes faced some amusing confusion with a Pakistani reporter ahead of the third Test match against Pakistan.

FROM THE DUG-OUT

Mohd Siraj has taken just 19 wickets in the 13 Tests that he has played at home.

Kuldeep Yadav has played nine of his 13 Tests at home with an average of 23.39 and a strike rate of 38.

New dad Sarfaraz Khan, who turned 27 on Tuesday, was to join the team later.

PUNE: 'Home advantage' seems to be the rallying call ahead of the second India-New Zealand Test starting here from Thursday. Already trailing 0-1 in the three-match series, India need a win, not just in a bid to clinch the series but also to keep them in the hunt for a World Test Championship final spot.The importance of the match could be gauged by two contrasting practice sessions on Tuesday.The visitors, who will again be without star batter Kane Williamson , had a three-hour stint in the morning. The match pitch was largely covered during this time. However, when the Indians arrived at 1:30 pm, the covers were removed and the pitch was allowed to breathe easy.What followed was a game of instructions to the groundsmen. Captain Rohit Sharma , coach Gautam Gambhir, MCA curator Jyotiram Phalke and BCCI curators Ashish Bhowmick and Taposh Chatterjee were the centre of attraction. First, four members of the ground staff were seen scrubbing the entire 22-yard strip, with emphasis on certain areas. The pitch already looked devoid of grass before this exercise began.Then the grass cutter came out. Are India trying to edge the Kiwis out of the game before it begins? Or is it a simple case of utilising home conditions to the fullest?India's assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate indicated that all is well with Rishabh Pant - who injured his knee in the Bengaluru Test - and he is in a position to keep wickets too. Pant was at the centre, looking eager to play and observing the pitch closely. Ten Doeschate also said there was nothing wrong with KL Rahul's batting form but they (the team management) ""have to fit seven pieces into six spots"" as recovering top-order batter Shubman Gill is ""good to go"" for thePune Test .The assistant coach also said Akash Deep was ""not far off getting on the team"" since he was bowling really well, and hailed Mohammed Siraj 's quality spell in the second innings in Bengaluru. He also clarified that R Ashwin is not carrying any niggle and didn't blame India's spin unit for the below-par show in the first Test, reminding that there wasn't much help from the pitch.In a nutshell, the home team is playing their cards close to their chest regarding the likely combination and playing XI.Ten Doeschate said, ""Rest assured, we (Team India) are going to do everything in our capability to give the best assessment of that wicket. We got it slightly wrong in Bengaluru the other day. I don't think it was a massive miss. The conditions just caught us on the back foot a little bit (choosing to bat first and getting all out 46). So you can be sure that the preparation and the assessment of the wicket is going to be as close to perfect as we can make it.""Visiting middle-order batsman Daryl Mitchell said, ""One thing we can't do is, we can't change the surface. It's about reacting to what's coming at us and adapting on the fly. As Kiwis, that's what we pride ourselves on. We get stuck in the moment, we stay where our feet are and we stay in the present. And we can't change the wicket. What will be, will be. But I'm sure we'll come up with a plan and find a way to take 20 wickets and score a few runs.""The former WTC winners, who shattered India's dreams in Southampton in 2021, experienced another high on Sunday by winning a Test in India after 36 years. Their women's team also won the World T20 for the first time on the same day.","India's assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate indicated that all is well with Rishabh Pant - who injured his knee in the Bengaluru Test.

He has been named in the India A squad and is being prepared by the BCCI as a seam-up all-round option.India A will travel to Australia and also play an intra-squad match with Team India ahead of the first Test of the Border Gavaskar Trophy beginning next month.The interesting part of the selection will be the decision around veteran pacer Mohammed Shami and the official update on his fitness and availability for the tour.India captain Rohit Sharma had said in one of the press conferences that they would not want to take an ""undercooked"" Shami to Australia.Meanwhile, the trio of Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, Akash Deep are automatic choices for fast bowlers, with Avesh Khan and Yash Dayal among the likely back-up seamers in the squad.",The Board of Control for Cricket in India is expected to announce India's Test squad for the tour of Australia on October 28.

, on the other hand, will be chasing a historic series win as second Test begins in Pune today...

üî¥ LIVE: Can India Bounce Back in Pune? | KL Rahul and R Pant to Enter IPL Mega Auction 2025

PUNE: India head coach Gautam Gambhir 's assertion that trying to win the second Test against New Zealand is the top priority - and that it will take precedence over planning for the tour of Australia - has cleared the fog.It makes sense because not taking any chances, taking their best XI to the park and winning this series will put India in the best position to qualify for the World Test Championship (WTC) final at Lord's from June 11. The first of five Tests in Australia starts in Perth on November 22.It can now be said with certainty, barring last-minute fitness issues or a change of heart, that Shubman Gill is taking the place of KL Rahul in the team for the second Test of the series starting at the Gahunje stadium from Thursday. There is a strong possibility of pacer Akash Deep coming in for Mohammed Siraj.The strategy of playing three spinners will continue, albeit with a change in personnel - meaning either left-arm spinner Axar Patel or off-spinning left-handed batsman Washington Sundar is likely to take left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav 's spot. Gambhir said Gill and Rishabh Pant were fit and available for selection.Kiwi captain Tom Latham said, ""Our job is to adapt as quickly as possible. We can't control the pitch. Going into the match without preconceived ideas is a strength of this team.""New Zealand, however, will have to decide whether to keep their three-man pace attack from the first Test - Tim Southee, Matt Henry and William O'Rourke - or bring in an additional spinner in Mitchell Santner.Sometimes, the playing XI also decides your preference at the toss. And that can backfire too.On his achievement of leading the Black Caps to their third-ever Test win on Indian soil in the preceding Test, Latham said, ""That was last week. We celebrated what was a special performance. But our attention turned quickly to this game. We don't want to rest (on the laurels) of last week.""But we do want to take confidence from that win going ahead. The win shows that we can come over here and we can compete. But we realise that both teams start on zero for this game. We are hoping to put India under pressure by doing correct things on a consistent basis,"" Latham added.One of those correct things could be not going into a shell and using decisive footwork - like Rachin Ravindra did in Bengaluru - against the Indian spinners.In the last Test against South Africa at this venue in 2019, Virat Kohli had slammed a well-controlled double hundred. If the pitch behaves like a typical Indian wicket, the former India skipper, expected to be back at his favoured No. 4 batting spot behind Shubman Gill, could well come up with another big one.Latham said, ""We expect India to be at their best over the next few days.""Not allowing the home team - especially openers Rohit Sharma and Yashasvi Jaiswal - to be at their best will be their primary task.If the track is a raging turner, India will not be safe either. Unfancied spinners have troubled India big time in the past.Besides Ajaz Patel's 10 wickets in an innings in Mumbai in 2021, there are examples of Aussies Steve O'Keefe (12-70, Pune 2017), Matthew Kuhnemann (6-76, Indore 2023) and England's Tom Hartley (7-62, Hyderabad, January 2024) troubling India big time with their left-arm spin.","India head coach Gautam Gambhir says trying to win the second Test against New Zealand is the top priority.

Brief Scores

Massive challenge against India: Devine

AHMEDABAD: India women's head coach Amol Muzumdar exhorted the side to push behind the ""hurt"" of the Women's T20 World Cup and regroup for the three-match ODI series against New Zealand, beginning Thursday.New Zealand, who eventually lifted the ICC showpiece, had beaten India in their World Cup opener in the UAE recently, as the Harmanpreet Kaur-led side failed to enter the knockouts.""It'll be an understatement to say that we were disappointed from the World Cup, as the team and the players have been hurting. But we need to gather ourselves and look at the positives that we have done in the last 10 months as a group,"" Muzumdar told the media on the eve of the first one-dayer.Muzumdar reminisced about the team's dominant run over South Africa recently in Bengaluru, winning the ODI series 3-0, and asked the team to concentrate on its strengths.""We'd won 3-0 against South Africa just a couple of months back in Bangalore. So, we are really looking forward to the series (against NZ). It's an important series.""We are a formidable team and we want to focus on our strengths and work on the areas to improve. I'm sure this is going to be a very well-fought series,"" he added.India will miss the services of injured spinner Asha Sobhana and Richa Ghosh, who is sitting for her board examination, for this series.However, Muzumdar said his team has enough depth.""A couple of them were forced changes. There won't be many changes (as season goes ahead) because this team is very capable. We have got enough depth. We believe in their talent and ability and move ahead,"" he added.New Zealand skipper Sophie Devine said her side is all set to face India in the ODI series, which she termed a ""massive challenge.""""It's always going to be a massive challenge playing India in their conditions. So, we're really excited about that challenge. Obviously, we are building off the momentum that we've been able to create from the (T20) World Cup,"" she said.Devine also said the Kiwis are looking to bag points and qualify for the Women's ODI World Cup to be held in India next year.""Qualification points are still on the table, so our first priority is securing qualification for next year's World Cup. I think we're in a really good position to come in here and have some success.""However, the 35-year-old all-rounder cautioned the Kiwis against taking India lightly after beating them at the recent World Cup.""I know they'll be disappointed after the recent WC, but the thing is India at home are incredibly strong. They've got depth throughout their line-up with both bat and ball.""The way Harman leads them is going to be crucial. We've got to find ways to negate that and to be able to take wickets at regular intervals,"" she noted.","India women's head coach Amol Muzumdar exhorted the side to push behind the ""hurt"" of the Women's T20 World Cup.

Shreyas Iyer out of of Mumbai's next Ranji Trophy game,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/shreyas-iyer-out-of-of-mumbais-next-ranji-trophy-game/articleshow/114513410.cms,"(PTI Photo)

MUMBAI: Shreyas Iyer will miss Mumbai's next Ranji Trophy match, against Tripura at Agartala from October 26. Iyer did not travel with the Mumbai team to Agartala on Wednesday morning.‚ÄúIyer had mailed the Mumbai chief selector (Sanjay Patil), asking for a one-match break, so we have given him a break for this match,‚Äù Mumbai Cricket Association secretary Abhay Hadap told TOI.However, a reliable source in the MCA revealed that Iyer has decided to skip this match has he is suffering from a shoulder injury.""Yes, Iyer complained of shoulder pain after the last match (against Maharashtra at the MCA ground in BKC. He scored 142 in the first innings) and went for an MRI scan. He has been advised 'rest' for around 10 days. He should be fine for Mumbai's next match after this,"" the source said.Iyer should thus be fit and available for Mumbai's Ranji match against Odisha from November 6 at BKC.The 29-year-old India batsman had undergone shoulder surgery in April 2021 to treat a partially dislocated left shoulder, an injury which forced him to miss the second of the IPL and the T20 World Cup later that year.Talking to reporters after scoring a century in the last Ranji match, Iyer had said that he had played seven consecutive domestic matches, and mentioned that he needed to rest his body, regardless of what others might think. ""No matter whatever people think outside, I have to listen to my body because I know the amount of threshold I've carried over the last few years and based on that I'll be taking the right decision and I hope that my team will also back (me),"" he had said.The MCA had announced a 16-member squad for Tripura on Monday, leaving out opener Prithvi Shaw on ""fitness grounds."" No replacement has been made for Iyer so far.This injury is the latest blow to Iyer's career. The Mumbaikar had spent a considerable time out of the game due to a back injury for which he had to ultimately undergo a back surgery in London. He played in both the Asia Cup and the World Cup, but lost his spot in the Indian team in both the Test and T20 formats.After scoring a ton against Maharashtra-his first in first-class cricket since 2021-Iyer pressed hope for a national comeback. ‚ÄúAbsolutely! That's why I've been playing. I mean, or else I would have given a reason and sat out,‚Äù Iyer responded, when quizzed about whether there was still a drive in him to wear the white jersey. ‚ÄúI am absolutely keen for a comeback but yes, as we say, control the controllables, and my job is to keep performing and keep participating (in matches) as much as possible and also see that my body is in the best shape. So, I'll take the best decision possible according to that,‚Äù stressed the 29-year-old.""I'm in a good space right now. I'm doing what I'm meant to do, that is training and playing matches consistently and I feel that all the matches I've played right now have helped me gain that fitness level as well, along with my training program. So, this is my seventh match on the trot, and the body has taken a lot of load at the same time. So, we have to manage here and there and see to it that I strategize in terms of how I play,‚Äù he had said.Having suffered from serious injuries to his shoulder and back that required surgeries, Iyer had said that he has now become ""smart"" in terms of managing his body as a cricketer. ‚ÄúSee, now I have to be smart in terms of what decisions I make. I need to see to it that my body is in the best shape possible. I have to decide according to that, no matter what people think. I have to listen to my body because I know the amount of threshold I have carried over the last few years and based on that, I'll be taking the right decision and I hope that my team will also back (me),"" Iyer explained.","Shreyas Iyer will miss Mumbai's next Ranji Trophy match, against Tripura.

Table-topping Villa

Real Madrid came from behind to beat Borussia Dortmund 5-2 in the Champions League on Tuesday with Vinicius Junior scoring a hat-trick, as Aston Villa maintained their 100 percent record to go top of the table.Vinicius struck three times in the second half as Madrid bounced back from two goals down to inflict further anguish on Dortmund -- in the repeat of last season's final which Real won 2-0.First-half goals in quick succession by Donyell Malen and Jamie Gittens had given Dortmund a two-goal lead at half-time.""Things were very quiet when we got to the dressing room 2-0 down at half-time,"" Vinicius, 24, told Movistar.""But we listened to the boss (coach Carlo Ancelotti) and agreed one simple thing: if we can score first then we'll fight back and win once again.""The 15-times champions duly struck back early in the second period via Antonio Rudiger and Vinicius, before Lucas Vazquez sent Real ahead and the Brazilian netted two more inside the final 10 minutes.After the surprise defeat at Lille last time out, Madrid's hunt for a record-extending 16th Champions League crown is back on track as they move to ninth in the standings, on six points.Malen swept the Germans into the lead on the half-hour following a deft pass from Serhou Guirassy that split open the defence.Madrid defender Eder Militao was then left beating the turf in frustration four minutes later when Gittens flew in at the back post to double Dortmund's lead.Rudiger halved the deficit with a powerful header from a Kylian Mbappe cross on 60 minutes.Vinicius equalised two minutes later by tucking away a stray ball, the goal being awarded by VAR after Mbappe was shown to have been onside in the build-up.A rare Dortmund foray forward resulted in a fine Thibaut Courtois save, with the holders then racing straight down the other end and Vazquez lashing home on 83 minutes.Vinicius then completed his hat-trick in the 86th and 93rd minutes, his second coming after a lung-busting sprint down the line from inside his own half.Arsenal emerged 1-0 winners at home to Ukraine's Shakhtar Donetsk thanks to an own-goal from the visitors' goalkeeper.Dmytro Riznyk could only grasp at thin air after Gabriel Martinelli had cut in from the left and smacked the ball against the near post before it rebounded back off the goalie and over the line.Leandro Trossard missed a penalty near the end, but Arsenal had already done enough to secure their second win of the tournament.Fellow Premier League side Aston Villa are enjoying an excellent return to European football's top table after 41 years as they won their third match in three Champions League outings this term with a 2-0 victory against Bologna.""We are playing seriously, we are playing focussed, responsible and the team is progressing and mature in everything,"" manager Unai Emery told TNT Sports.John McGinn opened the scoring at Villa Park 10 minutes after the interval and Jhon Duran wrapped up the points in the 64th minute, sending Emery's side to the top of the league phase table on nine points with zero goals conceded.Stuttgart sank Juventus 1-0 in Turin, thanks to a stoppage-time winner by El Bilal Toure.The Italians were reduced to 10 men when Danilo picked up a second yellow while conceding a penalty in the 84th minute.Mattia Perin looked to have saved his side when he stopped the resulting spot-kick from Enzo Millot, but Toure slammed home in the 92nd minute for Stuttgart.PSV Eindhoven surprised Paris Saint-Germain with a Noa Lang goal against the run of play in the first period, before Achraf Hakimi hit back on 55 minutes to ensure the points were shared.AC Milan beat 10-men Club Brugge at the San Siro with Christian Pulisic and a Tijjani Reijnders brace giving the Italians a 3-1 victory.Monaco won 5-1 at home to Red Star Belgrade, while Sporting Lisbon beat Sturm Graz 2-0 in Austria.Last season's Spanish league surprise-packages Girona picked up their first points in the competition with a 2-0 win at home to Slovan Bratislava.On Wednesday, five-time winners Barcelona host six-time champions Bayern Munich and Liverpool visit RB Leipzig.",Real Madrid come from behind to beat Borussia Dortmund 5-2 in the Champions League.

Lothar, can you share your thoughts on Bayern Munich‚Äôs impending clash with Hansi Flick‚Äôs Barcelona in the Champions League?

Will you be happy if Barcelona tops Bayern Munich?

Last season Bayer Leverkusen got the better of Bayern. Your thoughts on how this season will unfold‚Ä¶

You just said that Bayern Munich is fun to watch again‚Ä¶

So, tell us a bit more about how Kompany is bringing fun to Bayern‚Äôs game‚Ä¶

How do you see the German national team shaping up?

You played two World Cup finals with Maradona. He admired you as his best rival. Which one did you enjoy the most, Mexico 1986 or Italy 1990?

(Watch Bayern Munich in action in Bundesliga on October 27,2024 against VfL Bochum Live on Sony Sports Ten 2 SD & HD from 8:00 PM IST)

Lothar Matthaus started playing two years after Pele retired and hung up his boots two years before Cristiano Ronaldo made his international debut. In between, the only German to win the FIFA Player of the Year award, Matthaus won everything for club and country, including the World Cup in 1990 as the captain of Die Mannschaft. A Bayern Munich legend, Matthaus talked toabout the Bavarian giants‚Äô impending Champions League clash against Barcelona, Leverkusen‚Äôs rise and his memories of his greatest rival Diego Maradona Excerpts from a video interview...You know, I am going for the match tomorrow (Wednesday) to work for my TV channel! I was watching Barcelona play Sevilla, and I saw both teams playing the same style, very high line, attacking early and playing with the fourth defenders on the middle line. They leave a lot of space between the defence and the goalkeeper. This can be the space for the striker. And I am happy for my friend Hansi Flick who is doing a fantastic job in Barcelona. I think it's similar in Bayern Munich with Vincent Kompany who has given Bayern its DNA back. I was missing it for the last two years. It will be a nice game, especially for football fans.I think it's a special game for Hansi because he will not forget his time with Bayern as a coach and as a player. He played four years in Bayern Munich and got good results as a coach when he won seven titles in twelve months. I think it's a fantastic story for him and for Bayern Munich. I think he found in Barcelona a place where he can impart the style he wants. Hansi likes to work the same with the young players and Barcelona has a lot of young, talented players.For me it‚Äôs a football game. I‚Äôm a fan of Bayern Munich. Because I played twelve years for this club. I‚Äôm friends with Hansi. And for this, the best will be if nobody wins (with a cheeky smile). But both teams have lost one game each already. And this means when you lose now, you can have a maximum of 18 points if you win the next five. But nobody can give you the guarantee. You go with 18 points straight into the next round. Or, one must go through a playoff game. No team likes that. The team that loses tomorrow will find it very difficult to qualify straight to the second round. Both Bayern and Barca are leading in their domestic leagues. And both teams have played in the offensive mode. Both have players with similar styles. Two experienced strikers, Harry Kane (Bayern) and Robert Lewandowski (Barca), are in fine goal-scoring form. Both have fast wingers. I think Bayern has the edge because of Manuel Neuer, their goalkeeper who is far more experienced than Pena Sotores, the Barca goalkeeper who is filling in place of injured Marc-Andre ter Stegen.Last year Bayer Leverkusen were almost perfect. Last year they were playing with a positive energy. They were under no pressure. Now the fans and journalists expect similar standards from Leverkusen. That is not possible this season. And Bayern Munich will not play like the last two years. They will be better. Bayern Munich‚Äôs curve in on the rise. Leverkusen‚Äôs graph has somewhat plateaued. Now they have to fight 95 minutes to win every game. Last year things were looking much easier. They were moving the ball around at will and were controlling the game. Now when they played Bayern, they had 30% possession. Last year they enjoyed 60% possession against them. There is more surround sound that Leverkusen is dealing with this season regarding transfers. You have a lot of stories now around the team in Leverkusen than last season. It creates pressure.Yes.Kompany has understood the pulse of the players. Thomas Tuchel never could do that. Kompany had a good conversation with the players. He allows the players to express themselves, go for attack and score. That‚Äôs what players like to do. He has given the players confidence to show their quality. See how Musiala (Yamal) is playing freely. Kompany has been a great defender but if he tries to teach Musiala how to dribble, then it will be a mistake. Tuchel tried to change players. Tried to make them do things that didn‚Äôt come naturally to them. Tuchel tried to give the team a style that‚Äôs not in their DNA. And I think this was the problem between Tuchel and the team. Tuchel is a good trainer but was not the right coach for Bayern Munich.We cannot be happy with Germany‚Äôs results in the last two World Cups where we could not escape from the group. But now we are very happy with our current national coach Julian Nagelsmann. He gives them happiness on the field. They come to the national team with a smile. There was too much disturbance in the German federation, and it affected the national team. Now, director Rudi Voeller is acting as the wall to keep the disturbance away from the team. The teams in Russia and Qatar had quality, no doubt. But outside problems affected the team. Now Voeller is cleaning things up before it reaches the team. Voeller and Nagelsmann's relationship is good for the national team. And we must remember that the fate of the German team and Bayern Munich are intertwined. When Bayern performs well, the national team does well too.I enjoyed Italy 1990 more not only because we won the World Cup. I was playing for Inter Milan at that time. I won the World Cup in my ‚Äòhome‚Äô country. I am a German who was living in Italy, and I felt like I was at home. It was a home World Cup. And we had a fantastic team. We were the team to beat. When somebody will win this World Cup, they must first win against Germany. This was not the feeling in Mexico, when we lost the final to Diego Maradona‚Äôs Argentina. We lost our third game against Denmark. We played a draw against Uruguay. The feeling was not the same. In Italy, we got tremendous support too. The final in Rome was a ‚Äòhome‚Äô game for us. In Mexico City, it was a ‚Äòhome‚Äô game for Argentina. We had 65,000 supporters for Germany in Rome. Italian fans also supported us. because most of our national team players then were playing in Serie A. For me, 1990 was better.

Even as Odisha FC ‚Äôs fortunes seem to be on the rise, there appears to be no change in the fate of East Bengal .And on Tuesday, at Kalinga Stadium in Bhubaneswar, hosts Odisha added to their woes as they eked out a convincing 2-1 victory over the Kolkata giants, who were also reduced to 10 men for the last 15 minutes on way to their sixth defeat in as many games.Dimitrios Diamantakos did cancel out a Roy Krishna 22nd-minute opener with the last kick of the first half, incidentally from the spot. However, Oscar Bruzon‚Äôs men had no answer to a Mourtada Fall aerial winner as Sergio Lobera ‚Äôs men climbed to the sixth spot on the Indian super League table with seven points from five matches.There was, however, no respite for East Bengal who are languishing at the bottom of the 13-team table ‚Äî still waiting for their first point after a run of six defeats so far.The visitors made their aggressive intent clear from the first whistle and Amrinder Singh had to come to Odisha‚Äôs rescue in the 5th minute to clear a Nandhakumar Sekar shot after Mohamad Rakip sent in a swerving cross to the far left box from the right wing to his onrushing teammate.Just a minute later, it was Diamantakos who challenged the Odisha custodian again with his left-footed shot from the right side of the box. In the 11th minute, Amrinder was once again called into action as East Bengal‚Äôs Majih Talal made a run into the middle of the box, past the Odisha defenders, but could not beat the outstretched right hand of the Odisha goalkeeper.The missed chances gave Odisha the time and determination to grow into the game and soon they found the weak link in Bruzon‚Äôs tactic of high press that left a huge space for the Odisha playmakers to utilise and feed the poaching skills of Krishna.With East Bengal‚Äôs most expensive player ‚Äî Anwar Ali ‚Äî clearing the Fijian‚Äôs attempt just a minute earlier with a brilliant tackle, an inch-perfect Isak Ralte cross from the Odisha half found Krishna just outside the box in the 22nd minute. And the veteran ISL striker made no mistake to send it past East Bengal goalkeeper Prabhsimran Singh for his first goal this season.East Bengal, who had nine shots on target till the 45th minute but none inside the net, were lucky to have not fallen behind again as the Odisha counter-attacks became more optimistic. However, they lacked Krishna‚Äôs perfect final touch to increase the lead.Meanwhile, the Kolkata giants found the lifeline in the 4th minute of added time when a shot from Frenchman Talal struck the hand of defender Thoiba Singh and the referee pointed to the spot. The visitors equalised with their 10th shot on goal as Diamantakos‚Äôs penalty kick was powerful enough to beat Amrinder despite the ‚Äôkeeper going the right way for the save.Both teams came back stronger after the change of ends and kept up their pursuit for a winner. While Nandhakumar‚Äôs optimistic piledriver went over the Odisha goal in the 67th minute, Odisha were awarded a foul in the 69th with their next attack.Despite having an off-season so far, Fall put Odisha in the lead again by rising above his marker and converting the header from the ensuing freekick by Ahmed Jahouh.While East Bengal tried to get back on their feet and find another answer, it was Odisha who looked more likely to change the scoresheet with Krishna, and substitute Diego Mauricio in the last 10 minutes, failing to make the most of some positive moves into the box.The frustration, however, got the better of East Bengal as Provat Lakra was sent off for his second yellow card of the game for an unnecessary tackle on Jahouh in the 76th minute. The visitors seemed to have given up as Odisha kept toying near their defence, with Bruzon ‚Äî who, too, earned himself a yellow ‚Äî not a witness to the disappointment on the field.",Odisha FC beat East Bengal 2-1 at Kalinga Stadium in Bhubaneswar.

There would be no dearth of the desire to win in the two teams taking field at Kalinga Stadium in Bhubaneswar on Tuesday. While hosts Odisha FC have managed just one win to take into the international break and sit on 10th spot on the Indian Super League table, visiting East Bengal FC are still on the lookout for their first point to take them out of the bottom of the 13-team table.However, the fans at the home turf are sure to anticipate a firework duel between these two eastern outfits ‚Äî as has been the case earlier ‚Äî and an end-to-end battle that pushes each team to put their best efforts forward to walk away with three points.Sergio Lobera and his men are finally discovering their mojo this campaign and this fixture might give them their best opportunity to go all the way, given their seven-game-long unbeaten streak against East Bengal in ISL, in which they have struck 23 goals.‚ÄúOdisha FC need to get the best performance possible from the entire squad,‚Äù Odisha head coach Sergio Lobera said at the pre-match press conference on Monday.‚ÄúWe need to manage the squad well. If you have a very good squad, you have more chances to win the game. If you have good options coming from the bench, we can change the game. We need to manage the timings and substitutions well and this is our job as the coaches to get the best performance possible not only from the players who are starting the match, but also the ones who are coming from the bench.‚ÄùWhile the coach‚Äôs tactics will be crucial, the hosts will depend on the likes ofDiego Mauricio and Hugo Boumous to fire as Lobera looks to move upwards on the table. It will be the same kind of expectation at the other end from their yet-to-fire stars like Dimitrios Diamantakos and newest recruit, Frenchman Madih Talal .One-match-old East Bengal coach Oscar Bruzon pointed at specific facets of the gameplan in which his team needs to uplift their performance and stressed on the importance of a win in raising the team‚Äôs confidence.‚ÄúEast Bengal need a positive result,‚Äù the Spaniard said on Monday. ‚ÄúWe need to understand where to shape, the offensive triggers, to be more intense, to win duels, win second balls, to go big on the defensive transitions and to have fewer spaces in between our lines.

Khalid Jamil may be a man of few words but evidently not a man of few feats. And on Monday, at JRD Tata Sports Complex in Jamshedpur, his men took another leap of success as Jamshedpur FC overtook Mohun Bgan Super Giant on the Indian Super League (ISL) table with a 2-1 win against Hyderabad FC .The win ‚Äî scripted with first-half strikes from Rei Tachikawa and Jordan Murray ‚Äî took the Men of Steel to the second spot on the table, banishing the Kolkata giants to third place with 12 points from five matches and staying just a point behind current leaders Bengaluru FC Hyderabad, meanwhile, could not climb out of the penultimate position with just one point from four games.The southern visitors‚Äô desire to rise from their 12th spot on the table was evident from the beginning as Lenny Rodriguez, Ramhlunchhunga and Abdul Rabeeh all had shots on target in the opening 25 minutes.However, the deadlock was broken a little against the run of play in the 29th minute when Jamshedpur winger Sanan Mohammad sent a cross from the left of the box that reached Imran Khan at the other end of the box. But the midfielder‚Äôs shot was saved by Hyderabad custodian Arshdeep Singh before the rebound reached the feet of an onrushing Tachikawa, who ran in with the ball for his second goal of the season, continuing his goalscoring touch against the same opponents.The goal seemed to have raised the home side‚Äôs confidence as they went on the lookout for more. While Arshdeep was able to save an optimistic shot from Tachikawa in the 34th minute, he was not able to repeat the feat 10 minutes later.This time, too, it was Sanan who was the provider as he sent a through to Murray after a good transition and a pass from Tachikawa. The Australian was exquisite in his finish as he chipped the ball with his right feet over the reach of the onrushing Arshdeep.Hyderabad were more determined for a comeback after the change of ends as they produced some exciting moves that didn‚Äôt take long to attain the desired result. However, it was as much the miscommunication between the Jamshedpur backline as was the presence of mind of Cy Goddard that earned them the goal.The miscommunication led defender Pratik Chaudhari to duck the ensuing header in the box from a throw-in on a verbal call from Albino Gomes and Japanese Goddard made no mistake to sneak into the goalmouth medley and send it past the goalkeeper.The goal raised hopes in the Thangboi Sinto-coached side for an equaliser even as Jamshedpur began to get their act together after the shock of conceding. And, in the end, it was Jamil‚Äôs men who came out on top and made a statement and a place for themselves among the title contenders this season.","Jamshedpur FC overtook Mohun Bgan Super Giant on the Indian Super League (ISL) table with a 2-1 win against Hyderabad FC.
