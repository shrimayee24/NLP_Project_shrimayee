Poll Do you think the investigation will lead to significant changes in the HCA's management? Yes, change is likely No, things will stay the same

HYDERABAD: Telangana police on Wednesday arrested five people, including three of the most senior office-bearers of the Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA), in a case of forgery and misappropriation of funds. Among those arrested are president A Jagan Mohan Rao, treasurer C J Srinivas Rao and CEO Suneel Kante. Two top executives of a city-based cricket club too have been arrested. The role of another senior HCA office bearer is being probed.Sources said the investigators also took into account the findings of a vigilance and enforcement inquiry report on allegations against the HCA chief and others of harassing the SRH management for free tickets during IPL.Based on a complaint by Dharam Gurava Reddy, general secretary of Telangana Cricket Association (TCA), filed on June 9, CID filed a case under Sections 465 (punishment for forgery), 468 (forgery for the purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged document or electronic record), 403 (dishonest misappropriation of property), 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by banker, merchant or agent), 420 (cheating) read with 34 (common intention).TCA is not recognised by BCCI . The complainant alleged president A Jagan Mohan Rao contested the HCA elections using a forged document. It was also alleged Rao, along with some HCA apex council members, misappropriated over Rs 2.3 crore from the association.CID officials told TOI they discovered Rao had used a forged cricket club membership to qualify for the 2023 HCA elections. ""Rao furnished a forged membership of Gowlipura Cricket Club to contest in the elections and won,"" said a CID official.CID arrested Gowlipura Cricket Club president G Kavita and her husband Rajender Yadav, who is the general secretary of the club, for aiding Rao in committing the offence. CID officials also alleged that Rao, along with treasurer C J Srinivas Rao and CEO Suneel Kante, who are apex council members of HCA, misappropriated HCA funds under the guise of performing their official duties.CID picked up Rao from his residence in Gachibowli, Srinivas from Padma Rao Nagarand Kante from Begumpet. Rajender Yadav and Kavita were taken into custody later in the night.HCA had copped a lot of flak this IPL season over excessive demands for complimentary passes. SRH had alleged illtreatment by HCA and threatened to shift their operations out of the city. The team management alleged that as against the agreement of giving 3,900 complimentary passes to the association for every match — 10% of the stadium’s capacity — the HCA president was asking for 20 more passes. The issue even threatened to derail a match between SRH and LSG.","Telangana police on Wednesday arrested five people, including three of the most senior office-bearers of the Hyderabad Cricket Association.

HOT ROD: 20 minutes of Evan Rodrigues 23-24 season highlights

Brad Marchand’s decision affects Toronto’s trade urgency



The NHL offseason has shaken up the Toronto Maple Leafs. Following the trade of star forward Mitch Marner to the Vegas Golden Knights, the pressure has mounted on Auston Matthews and the front office to make up for the void. Although the Maple Leafs failed in their reported attempt to acquire veteran Brad Marchand during free agency, their focus remains locked on the Florida Panthers roster.Toronto’s interest is practical. The team seeks a playoff-proven forward to reinforce their top-six rotation. Rodrigues, known for his two-way reliability and postseason experience, would offer exactly that. And for a team still reeling from the loss of Marner’s speed, vision, and chemistry with Matthews, his addition could help steady the ship heading into the new season.While the Maple Leafs are active suitors, they are far from the only ones. The Chicago Blackhawks, Detroit Red Wings, and Minnesota Wild are also reportedly in the mix for Rodrigues’ services. Unlike Toronto, those three clubs play in the Western Conference, a factor that may sway Florida’s preference when choosing a trade partner.Evan Rodrigues’ trade could follow the same pattern. While his value is recognized across the league, his departure would serve a dual purpose: relieving the cap and avoiding strengthening a direct Eastern Conference rival.For Toronto, this presents a critical challenge. Convincing Florida to part with Rodrigues; without overpaying; may be their toughest task yet.Brad Marchand choosing to stay in Florida, rather than test free agency, may have added urgency to Toronto’s pursuit of Rodrigues. The Maple Leafs were reportedly interested in bringing in Marchand’s experience and leadership, but that window closed quickly. Marchand remains part of Florida’s championship core, a decision that reinforces Toronto’s need to look deeper into the Panthers’ roster for realistic options.As the NHL offseason continues, the Maple Leafs’ path forward hinges on whether they can outmaneuver rival teams and land a player who might not replace Mitch Marner, but can at least help stabilize a shaken core. Florida, on the other hand, must decide whether the cost of aiding a potential rival is worth the financial relief.Also Read: Former NHL enforcer Nick Tarnasky destroys drunk man in wild viral golf course brawl","Evan Rodrigues is a two-way forward who plays for the Florida Panthers.

Eric Mangini questions whether Travis Hunter can play WR and CB in the NFL



Teams can tire Travis Hunter out, Tua's No. 91 ranking in Top 100 is ""too high"" | FIRST THINGS FIRST

Travis Hunter's dream of being the first full-time two-way player in the NFL in decades has been called into question by some of the sport's veteran statesmen, including former New York Jets and Cleveland Browns coach Eric Mangini. The Jacksonville Jaguars drafted a rookie wide receiver and cornerback mesmerized by his two-way play at the University of Colorado. But Eric Mangini thinks the grind of the pro game could be too much even for a talent as unusual as Travis Hunter's.Travis Hunter made headlines last year playing with the Colorado Buffaloes and their head coach, Deion Sanders. He took an eye-popping 118 snaps a game, playing leading roles on offense and defense and making a serious bid for the Heisman Trophy. The Jacksonville Jaguars are now counting on his unusual skill set to remake their roster and play him at both wide receiver and cornerback. That move might not be as smooth, though.""He's shown that he's built different, but there's a significant difference between college football and the NFL,"" said Eric Mangini.""You're adding the five games plus whatever you're playing in the preseason. The quality of players you're playing against is good every week.""On the Breakfast Ball podcast, Mangini outlined why that might not work:“I don’t think that plan is necessarily going to work,” said Mangini. “It’s one of those things where, okay, if Travis Hunter is covering their best receiver, you’re going to tell your best receiver, ‘Hey, go run a go route all day. You’re a decoy. We’re not going to throw you the ball.’ You’re not going to know where he’s going to be defensively.”In the meantime, the Jacksonville Jaguars are slowly acclimating Travis Hunter to the pro pace. In OTAs, he lined up nearly exclusively as a wide receiver, with few reps at corner. That could be part of a building-once-you-get-there plan—or an indicator of how the Jaguars plan to utilize him in the near term.Also read: Travis Kelce’s performance questioned as Eric Mangini cites his relationship with Taylor Swift Travis Hunter’s NFL journey will be closely watched, not just for his undeniable athleticism, but also for the way he challenges traditional roles in professional football.",Eric Mangini questions whether Travis Hunter can play WR and CB in the NFL.

Source: X

Why did Calvin Ridley miss playing football most of his senior year?

Calvin Ridley is set to enter his second season as the lead wide receiver for the Tennessee Titans. Despite an inconsistent first season, he did manage to prove his mettle and became the ninth player in NFL history to have a 1,000-yard season with three different NFL teams.Calvin Ridley’s journey to NFL stardom wasn’t without some early roadblocks. One of his most unexpected came during his senior year of high school, when a technicality left him sidelined for much of the football season.Calvin Ridley was born on December 20, 1994 and was older than most of his classmates in school. By the time his senior season at Monarch High School in Coconut Creek, Florida, rolled around, he was already 20 years old.Unfortunately, Florida High School Athletic Association (FHSAA) rules strictly prohibit anyone over the age of 19 years and 8 months from participating in high school athletics. And Ridley was declared ineligible for most of his final year of high school football.It was no doubt a crushing blow to the young athlete. In high school football, missing an entire senior season meant Ridley had limited scope for college recruiters to evaluate, and far fewer chances to prove himself in front of scouts.But it goes without saying that Ridley’s talent was impossible to ignore.Even with limited playing time, he had already made a strong impression, especially with his speed and sharp route running. Ridley eventually committed to the University of Alabama, where he quickly became a star and helped them win a national championship and earning All-SEC honors.","Calvin Ridley is set to enter his second season as the lead wide receiver for the Tennessee Titans.

According to PEOPLE, the couple dined with their close friend and sportscaster Erin Andrews at the resort’s supper club, the Auric Room at Lone Mountain Ranch.

He paired it with a cap from his alma mater, Cleveland Heights High School, grounding the look in both hometown pride and romantic sentiment.While the couple keeps their more intimate moments off the grid, these subtle cues continue to feed the fandom.

Edmonton bets on Hobey Baker winner Isaac Howard to deliver immediate impact

Divided fan reactions: was O’Reilly the safer long-term bet?

Desperation or strategy? The high-stakes gamble to end the drought

The Edmonton Oilers are done waiting. After two gut-wrenching Stanley Cup Final losses, the franchise has made it clear they’re pushing all their chips in for a win-now run—starting with the controversial acquisition of college star Isaac Howard. The trade, which sent top prospect Sam O’Reilly to the Tampa Bay Lightning, has ignited a passionate divide among fans and analysts alike.Howard, the 2025 Hobey Baker Award winner, lit up the NCAA last season with 52 points in 37 games for Michigan State. Yet for the 21-year-old forward, individual accolades weren’t the priority. “I want to win a national championship. I didn’t play to win a Hobey,” he told NHL.com. That drive may have been exactly what the Oilers needed to see.NHL insider Frank Seravalli reported that Edmonton believes Howard is ready to make their opening night lineup, calling the move “fascinating.”And that’s where things get complicated.While Howard’s credentials are impressive, so were O’Reilly’s. The 19-year-old center, drafted 32nd overall by Edmonton in 2024, racked up 71 points in the OHL with the London Knights. Some fans questioned the logic of trading a right-shooting center over a smaller winger. “O’Reilly could have been our Lundell,” one Oilers supporter argued, referencing Florida Panthers standout Anton Lundell. “Howard? Don’t we already have a Savoie?”Indeed, comparisons to Matthew Savoie—another undersized, offensive winger the Oilers traded for last year—are already surfacing, along with concerns that Howard could land in the AHL “by game 10.”With Connor McDavid, Leon Draisaitl , and Evan Bouchard in their primes, the Oilers know their Cup window is now. Cap constraints have forced Edmonton into risky moves, and this latest trade reflects the franchise’s urgency.“Neither guy has proven anything,” one skeptical fan noted, “but I’d rather take the guy who plays C, shoots right, and is over 6 feet.”Also Read: Toronto Maple Leafs accused of downgrading as Nino Niederreiter pitched as Mitch Marner’s replacement Still, as Seravalli noted, Howard’s NHL readiness might tip the scales.

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce ’s low-key summer has fans watching their every move

A history of support: Swift continues to show up for Kelce

As the American Century Championship gears up for a star-studded weekend in South Lake Tahoe, all eyes are not just on NFL star Travis Kelce , who is set to attend — but on whether pop superstar Taylor Swift will be by his side. While the couple has remained intentionally quiet about their public appearances, speculation is heating up as Swift’s summer travel history and inner circle point toward a possible surprise appearance.Though Taylor Swift is in the middle of her record-breaking Eras Tour, she's been spending significant downtime with Travis Kelce during tour breaks. A source recently told People, “Taylor and Travis are soaking up every minute of this slower season together. They've been splitting their time between New York, Nashville, and a few quiet getaways, just enjoying each other’s company without all the usual chaos. This kind of downtime is rare for both of them, and it’s really allowed their bond to deepen. ”That insight has only fueled speculation that Swift may show up at Lake Tahoe to support Kelce at the celebrity golf tournament. The pair have been virtually inseparable in recent months — from vacationing together to appearing at key events in each other’s worlds.Back in June, Swift made headlines when she attended Tight End University, an NFL event co-hosted by Kelce. She surprised the crowd by jumping onstage and performing her hit “Shake It Off” alongside the event's headliner, Chase Brown. It wasn’t just a brief appearance — it was a moment that confirmed just how involved she’s become in Kelce’s off-the-field life.That unexpected moment has fans now wondering: if she showed up for a private NFL event, why wouldn’t she pop in for a golf tournament where her boyfriend will be front and center?Another reason fans believe Swift may attend is the confirmed presence of Keleigh Teller — wife of actor Miles Teller — who will also be at the tournament. Swift and Keleigh share a close friendship and have frequently been spotted together at Kansas City Chiefs games. With Kelce, Keleigh, and Miles all in Lake Tahoe, the stage seems perfectly set for another Swift appearance.Also Read: Swifties believe Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's romance began with this Eras Tour moment So while there's been no official confirmation, the clues are stacking up.

Robert Downey Jr. & Tom Holland Talk Basketball

Sometimes, it only takes one game to flip a fan’s heart—and that’s exactly what happened to Tom Holland . Back in 2016, he sat courtside at MSG as Steph Curry’s Warriors dominated the Knicks. The buzz, the energy, the performance—it was all too convincing. Holland walked in as a rookie to the sport and walked out a die-hard. “So you’re a front-runner?” Kimmel asked. “For sure,” he grinned.During an interview with host Jimmy Kimmel, Holland was questioned about his basketball knowledge, and he admitted he was ""not great"" at it—but that didn’t prevent him from being a fan of the game. Holland reminisced about his first NBA game in January 2016, where the Warriors faced off against the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden. The Golden State team, fresh from a championship win that season, crushed the Knicks with a score of 116-95.Despite the Garden being Knicks territory, Holland was unapologetic: “the first ever basketball game I went to was the Golden State Warriors … in New York,” He laughed, asserting that cheering for the champs didn’t mean he was a glory hunter. When Kimmel poked fun, ""So you’re a front-runner, right?"" he proudly responded, ""For sure.I’m not ashamed at all.""By June 2017, Holland’s fandom was so genuine that he proudly proclaimed his loyalty to Curry and the Warriors—and it wasn’t some fleeting celebrity trend.In the 2015–16 season, Steph Curry's Warriors broke the NBA record with an amazing 73–9 regular-season record, followed by a powerful championship run. Holland was there to see it all unfold live, which laid the groundwork for his love for the team. That one moment of seeing the Warriors in their prime clearly made a difference.Over the years, Holland has been spotted courtside at Golden State home games—particularly in May 2023 at the Chase Center during the playoffs—often alongside his fiancée, Zendaya.Tom Holland's tale illustrates just how significant live sports experiences can be. Instead of selecting a team based on stories or where they're from, his dedication was shaped by the electrifying vibe of watching Steph Curry's Warriors excel in person.

Oilers’ trade gamble sparks concern for Connor McDavid ’s future ahead of 2025-26 pressure season



Oilers Trade O'Reilly to Tampa for Howard, Hakstol Added to Avs Coaching Staff

In a surprising mid-July prospect swap, the Edmonton Oilers and Tampa Bay Lightning executed a trade that could have long-term implications beyond just player development. The Oilers shipped off their 2024 first-round pick, Sam O’Reilly (No. 32 overall), to Tampa in exchange for Isaac Howard, the Lightning’s 2022 first-rounder (No. 31) and the 2024 Hobey Baker Award winner.This wasn’t a casual shuffle of prospects. It was a calculated move by Edmonton—one clearly influenced by the urgency of their championship timeline. O’Reilly, who tallied an impressive 28 goals and 71 points in 62 OHL games last season, was widely regarded as the Oilers’ No. 2 prospect. He’s coming off back-to-back Robertson Cups and a Memorial Cup win with the London Knights. Despite this, Edmonton chose to part with him, a sign of their all-in mindset heading into the 2025-26 season.On the other side of the deal is Isaac Howard, a name that’s already causing buzz in Oil Country. NHL insider Frank Seravalli remarked that Howard is “more NHL-ready than O’Reilly” in the eyes of many around the league. That’s a key detail for a team like Edmonton, who aren’t just building for the future—they’re desperate to win now.The motivation behind the trade goes beyond roster depth. It’s also about sending a message to franchise cornerstone Connor McDavid. With the superstar center becoming an unrestricted free agent after the season, the Oilers must prove they’re serious about winning. “Finally capturing that Cup he so desperately covets is the best chance of securing him for the long term,” Seravalli emphasized.Howard may not have suited up in an NHL game yet, but his arrival is already being viewed as a move to address Edmonton’s offensive shortcomings—especially those exposed in their recent struggles against the Florida Panthers. Whether or not he can meet the lofty expectations remains to be seen, but the message is clear: Edmonton isn’t waiting around.Anything less than a Stanley Cup is bound to disappoint a city longing for a return to the Gretzky-era glory days. And if Howard can rise to the occasion, he might just become the unexpected catalyst in Edmonton’s push for greatness—and McDavid’s decision to stay.Also Read: Ex-NHL player Nick Tarnasky caught in violent golf course brawl, an internal investigation will take place","The Edmonton Oilers traded Sam O'Reilly to the Tampa Bay Lightning in a mid-July deal.

Ryan Reaves talks Toronto media, Evander Kane rivalry and more

The recent trade involving Mitch Marner, has been a significant talking point, a long-time fixture with the Toronto Maple Leafs, with teammate Ryan Reaves enlightening on the fan impact that might have bestowed to the move. After dedicating his entire nine-year career to the Maple Leafs, Marner was sent to the Vegas Golden Knights in a sign-and-trade deal last week. While the Maple Leafs acquired center Nicolas Roy, this transaction saw him secure an eight-year, $96 million contract with Vegas.Speaking on ""The Cam & Strick"" podcast, Reaves accentuated Marner's deep commitment to the Toronto franchise. He stated, ""Mitchie earned the right to go wherever he wants. He's dedicated a lot of his career—his whole career—to Toronto."" Reaves highlighted Marner's local connection and effort, adding, ""A hometown guy. He's poured everything he had into it. Sometimes it's just time to move on.""Reaves also underscored the relentless criticism Marner often faced from Toronto's passionate, yet sometimes unforgiving, fanbase. He observed, ""I think they can be a little ruthless to him.I guess just because he's the hometown guy, and sometimes fans want to point fingers at somebody."" Reaves further narrated the split nature of the Leafs' supporters: those who demand victory at any cost, even ""dragging anybody through the dirt,"" and the steadfast loyalists.He lamented, “Unfortunately, there's a lot of fans there, so you get a lot of both… I think it's tough for any player when you're just reading all the hate that you get. It's probably just frustrating."" Marner's significant contributions included 741 points in 657 games, placing him fifth in team history.Simultaneously, Maple Leafs General Manager Brad Treliving is tussling with the challenging task of finding a suitable replacement for Marner. With limited cap space and a scarcity of top-tier offensive players available, Treliving endorsed the difficulty on the ""Real Kyper & Bourne"" podcast. ""It's not as simple as just going to replace Mitch,"" he admitted.He also indicated the current market conditions, noting, ""There wasn't a huge appetite for people to move players. You have a rising cap, and you've got a shortage of top players."" Treliving remains committed to enhancing the team, despite the obstacles, stating, ""I don't think you're ever finished. You're always looking to try to improve your team.""

“Note taken! Will not slap his a**,” Julian Edelman and Rob Gronkowski discuss a funny incident about Tampa Bay Buccaneers nose tackle Vita Vea

Rob Gronkowski is taller than Vita Vea, but he got intimidated by him

Locker room experiences are fun as long as they are taken with a stride. Once they are not, someone has to face the consequences. And that’s what happened with former Tampa Bay Buccaneers tight end Rob Gronkowski. He playfully slapped Vita Vea’s buttocks one day in Tampa Bay’s locker room. And the next thing? The nose tackle for the Buccaneers looked at Gronkowski and said, “Never slap my a** again.” Scared-looking tight end replied then, “No problem, Vita. Whatever you say, I will do.” Where did the current FOX Sports Analyst share this amusing experience? What was the whole incident? Let’s discover.Julian Edelman, co-host of the Dudes on Dudes podcast show, says, “Vita Vea. He’s huge.” Rob Gronkowski, co-host of Dudes on Dudes, replies, “Just never slap his a**, Julian. One time, I slapped Vita Vea’s a**. I was like, ‘Let’s go, let’s have a day!’ And he looked at me like he was about to kill me, bro, and he was like, ‘Never slap my a** again.’ And I was like, ‘No problem, Vita. Whatever you say, I will do.’ To this day, I never slapped his a** again, Jules. ” Edelman replies, “Note taken! Will not slap his a**.”Vita Vea stands tall at 6-foot-4, whereas Rob Gronkowski is 6-foot-6. When Vea said, “Never slap my a** again,” Gronkowski got intimidated and took it very seriously, even though he was taller than him. But what really might have terrified him would have been his weight. The nose tackle weighs 346 pounds, and Gronkowski weighs 265 pounds. A heavier body with significant mass muscle can be perceived as more intimidating by some people.

A new video has started going viral and has shocked many sports fans. Former Olympic gold medalist Mary Lou Retton appears to be distressed during a police sobriety test. This tape dates from her DUI arrest in May 2025. Although she used to be well-known for her grace in gymnastics, this scene gives the story a very different hue. Viewers across social media have expressed disbelief, with many recalling her iconic 1984 Olympic triumph and struggling to reconcile that image with her current public challenges.Mary Lou Retton was stopped by the Fairmont City Police Department in Marion County, West Virginia on May 17, 2025; officers were responding to a report of suspect behavior in an AutoZone parking lot. Retton was in her automobile with a wine bottle in the passenger seat when they arrived.Police bodycam footage, first released by Entertainment Tonight, shows the 57-year-old athlete appearing anxious and out of breath while trying to complete a field sobriety test. During the test, she repeatedly gasped “Oh my God” and had difficulty following directions. She was asked to lift one foot off the ground and count, but could not get past nine seconds.Retton, a five-time Olympic medalist, told officers she needed oxygen, referencing her severe battle with double pneumonia in 2023. She used a nasal oxygen tube during the test. The officers also reported that she refused to take a breathalyzer test at the scene.In the released video, Mary Lou Retton repeatedly told police she was an “Olympic gold medalist.” At one point, she complimented an officer’s “beautiful blue eyes” and joked during the test, saying, “Yeah, I mean upside down.” When told to walk a straight line, she continued expressing disbelief and said, “I’m gonna go to jail.”She also told a woman at the scene, “Gia, they think I’m drunk.” Later, at the station, she said, “I nearly died from double pneumonia. I’ll die here, and you guys will live with that.”Court records confirm that Retton entered a no-contest plea to a non-aggravated DUI charge. She was fined $100. Through her lawyer, she apologized in a statement to People, saying: “I make no excuses. I have let you down, and for that I am deeply sorry.”","Former Olympic gold medalist Mary Lou Retton appears to be distressed during a police sobriety test.

The world of cyberspace is plain, simple, and boring without rage bait, we can all agree. Especially, the ones that say something but mean something else. Likewise was noticed in one of the recent tweets of MLFootball. So, the official X account of MLFootball wrote, “27-year-old Justin Herbert would be the Philadelphia #Eagles all-time leader in passing yards and touchdowns throughly 7 seasons — despite Justin only playing in 5. 😱😱😱Herbert would have already been the greatest quarterback in Philly team history.” When it clearly meant - “Los Angeles Chargers” instead of Philadelphia Eagles, and J-H(Justin Herbert) of Los Angeles Chargers instead of J-H(Jalen Hurts) of Philadelphia Eagles! Both of them belong to the 2020 NFL Draft. The Los Angeles Chargers picked Herbert, and the Philadelphia Eagles picked Hurts. Anyway, MLFootball’s word play is interesting, so is the rage bait, but Justin Herbert’s stats? They are truly insane.In December 2024, Omar Navarro of the NFL Network reported that Justin Herbert surpassed 20,619 career passing yards, which passed Hall of Famer Peyton Manning for the most in NFL history through the first five seasons.The NFL legend had secured 20,618 career passing yards in his first five seasons. That is not all! That one mark separated these two history creators elsewhere, too. Hear us out. In the first five seasons, Peyton Manning threw 138 touchdowns. And, the Chargers quarterback? He threw 137 touchdowns! No wonder it was an insane stat! Now, let’s check out some fan reactions.On July 9, when MLFootball shared a rage-baiting stat record of Justin Herbert, netizens reacted immediately. From one fan wondering, “Why are we doing this?” to another calling it, “This is dumb.” A third netizen mentioned Philadelphia Eagles’ star quarterback Jalen Hurts, “Would have won a Super Bowl like hurts though. Hurts is a winner and gets the job done ✅” Majority of the fans added another stat to the insane record of Chargers quarterback - that he had never won a Super Bowl - “0 Super Bowl wins,” “How many super bowls has he been to and won? Oh that’s right. ..0,” “Passings yards and TDs don’t dictate “best franchise QB” LOL, Super Bowls do.

Why Did OKC Bet Big on Holmgren?

1. Defensive Anchor

2. Offensive Versatility

3. Championship Pedigree

The Risks: Health and Cap Management

What’s Next for the Oklahoma City Thunder?

Fan and Analyst Reactions to Chet's New Contract

Thehave made a seismic move in the NBA landscape, agreeing to a five-year, fully guaranteed maximum rookie contract extension with star center. The deal, which could reach a staggering $250 million, cements Holmgren’s place as a foundational piece of the Thunder’s championship core. Chet Holmgren’s journey to this contract has been anything but straightforward. Drafted second overall in 2022, Holmgren missed his entire rookie season due to a foot injury. Undeterred, he bounced back with a stellar sophomore campaign, finishing second in Rookie of the Year voting after averaging 16.5 points, 7.9 rebounds, 2.4 assists, and 2.3 blocks per game while shooting 37% from three-point range.Despite a fractured pelvis that limited him to just 32 regular-season games in 2024-25, Holmgren returned in time for the playoffs, where his defensive prowess and versatile skill set helped propel the Oklahoma City Thunder to their first NBA championship. In the Finals, Holmgren delivered a memorable Game 7 performance with 18 points, eight rebounds, and five blocks, solidifying his reputation as a game-changer.- Length: 5 years- Value: Up to $250 million (fully guaranteed, with escalators based on performance)- Cap Impact: The contract will account for roughly 25% of the NBA salary cap, with potential to rise if Chet Holmgren earns All-NBA honors or other accolades.- Comparison: Only a handful of players in NBA history have secured rookie extensions of this magnitude, underscoring Holmgren’s perceived value.Holmgren’s elite rim protection and ability to guard multiple positions have transformed the Oklahoma City Thunder’s defense from solid to formidable. His shot-blocking instincts and length make him a nightmare for opposing offenses.Standing 7’1” with guard-like ball-handling and shooting touch, Holmgren spaces the floor and creates mismatches. His three-point shooting and ability to run in transition fit perfectly with the Thunder’s up-tempo, positionless style.Holmgren’s contributions during the Thunder’s title run proved he can deliver on the biggest stage. His performance in the playoffs, particularly on defense, was instrumental in OKC’s championship breakthrough.While Holmgren’s talent is undeniable, his injury history has raised eyebrows. He’s missed significant time in two of his three NBA seasons, making this massive financial commitment a calculated risk for the Oklahoma City Thunder.The extension also means OKC will soon have three players—Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Holmgren, and Jalen Williams (expected to sign a similar deal)—taking up the lion’s share of the team’s salary cap. This will test the Thunder’s front office acumen as they try to maintain depth and flexibility in a league with strict luxury tax and “second apron” penalties.With Chet Holmgren and MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander both locked in on long-term deals, the Oklahoma City Thunder have doubled down on their young core. The next order of business is securing Jalen Williams, another rising star from the 2022 draft class, to a rookie max extension. If successful, OKC will have a trio of stars under contract through their primes, positioning themselves as perennial contenders.The reaction to Holmgren’s extension has been a mix of excitement and cautious optimism. Oklahoma City Thunder fans are thrilled to see the franchise invest in its homegrown talent, while analysts note the risk-reward balance of betting big on a player with an injury history. Many believe Holmgren’s unique skill set and upside justify the gamble, especially after his championship heroics.Also read: Deandre Ayton Calls Team-Up with Luka Doncic “Like a Video Game” as Lakers Eye Championship Run Chet Holmgren’s $250 million extension is a bold statement by the Oklahoma City Thunder: they are all-in on their young stars and committed to building a dynasty.

The NBA is never too far from the music industry, as many athletes have also been successful artists in their careers. After all, Shaq might be an NBA legend, but he is also a certified rapper. But in this instance, we are talking about two different people - a rapper and an NBA star, only this time, they are seemingly together. Rapper Megan Thee Stallion recently released a few pictures of herself, enjoying her time off while taking pictures by the pool. But that's not the only thing that caught the eyes of fans, as Dallas Mavericks shooting guard Klay Thompson was seemingly spotted in not one, but two of those pictures.Tina Snow, aka rapper Megan Thee Stallion, is taking some time off after her SummerFest show and is enjoying the summer in a bikini by the pool. She recently took to her Instagram to post a few pictures of herself enjoying the pool, wearing a pastel green bikini. But while fans were overjoyed to get a glimpse of her daily life in this summer heat, there was one other thing that had many stumped, or should we say, one other person. Dallas Mavericks star Klay Thompson, who was last romantically linked with singer, songwriter, and actress Coco Jones until 2023, seems to have found a new beau. Thompson was seemingly spotted in the background of two pictures that were recently posted by rapper Megan Thee Stallion, and fans are all over social media trying to figure out if it really is him, or just someone who looks like the NBA star.Or this could just be Megan pulling a trick out of the bag and messing with her fans for fun.Megan Thee Stallion until now, was known to be dating Torrey Craig, but that has been a while, and maybe they broke up. It is also possible that, if it is Klay Thompson, which is still not confirmed, maybe he is just friends with the rapper and was hanging out with her. Or even, chances are both of them were just there at the same time, and he became a part of the background of her pictures unknowingly. But if the chaos on social media is anything to go by, the summer holidays are looking a lot more exciting with this bit of revelation.Also Read: Emirates NBA Cup: 30 teams have been rounded up into 6 groups as the 2025 group draw results are revealed","Rapper Megan Thee Stallion recently released a few pictures of herself, enjoying her time off while taking pictures by the pool.

Henderson / Getty Images)

Trevor Bauer’s life changed when he was accused of sexual assault but then he accused the woman of “fraud”



T revor Bauer, once considered to be one of the most talented and popular players in the league, had his whole life change in December 2022 when a woman accused him of sexual assault. While the MLB later reinstated him, the Los Angeles Dodgers fired him in January 2023 due to the allegations against him. But things changed in 2024, when Trevor Bauer accused the same woman, Darcy Adanna Esemonu, of “fraudulent schemes and artifices”.Back in 2022, Darcy Adanna Esemonu accused Trevor Bauer of sexually assaulting her in late 2020 which had then resulted in a pregnancy. This news had sparked uproar in the league and had sent shockwaves across his fans.The serious allegations led to Trevor Bauer being fired from his team in January 2023 but in 2024, the woman was charged by Trevor Bauer for getting undisclosed benefits “by means of fraudulent pretenses, representation, promises, or material omissions.”Apparently, as per CNN Sports, according to the police report, Darcy Adanna Esemonu had demanded a whopping $1.6 million from Trevor Bauer for an abortion. While Trevor Bauer did pay $10,000 for pregnancy needs, as per his lawyer, the woman was actually never pregnant when she demanded the amount from the MLB player.When Trevor Bauer was accused of sexually assaulting Darcy Adanna Esemonu, he strongly denied charges of getting intimate with her without her consent. The former Los Angeles Dodgers’ player even shot a video where he denied any charges related to sexual assault.In the YouTube video, Trevor Bauer had said, “If there comes a time in the future where I need to defend myself further, I will not hesitate to do so.”The former Los Angeles Dodgers’ player added, “For now, there is no reason to speak further on this topic, though, because outside of Adanna – who’s now been indicted with felony fraud – there are no claims against me, no ongoing investigations, and no outstanding lawsuits.”At this point in time, there are no further public updates about the case between Trevor Bauer and Darcy Adanna Esemonu.Also Read: What went wrong for free agent Julio Urías?

"NHL trade watch: Erik Karlsson deal now more realistic after paid bonus, says Elliotte Friedman",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-watch-erik-karlsson-deal-now-more-realistic-after-paid-bonus-says-elliotte-friedman/articleshow/122350588.cms,"NHL- Erik Karlsson (Image Via Getty)

32 Thoughts

What this actually means for NHL teams



“The bonus is paid, the actual cash is really down… we’ll see,”

“We’ll see”: It’s not a done deal but the math looks better now

Handle that massive cap hit



Possibly negotiate some salary retention



Make the roster math work long-term



Will Karlsson move again?

Just when you thought the Erik Karlsson trade talk had cooled off, Elliotte Friedman dropped a quiet bomb on the latestpodcast: the bonus on Karlsson’s contract has already been paid, and that changes everything.Karlsson is still carrying a $10 million+ cap hit, which has made moving him tricky for the Penguins. But with his bonus money already paid, the actual dollars owed over the rest of his deal are now way lower than the sticker shock suggests.Friedman said, keeping things vague but clearly signaling that a Karlsson trade is back on the radar.So, for teams who are tight on cash but still want a top-tier defenseman? This is suddenly a very different conversation.Even with the reduced cash, any team trading for Karlsson will need to:That’s why Friedman didn’t say a deal is imminent but the financial piece of the puzzle might be the biggest hurdle that's now cleared.After one full season in Pittsburgh, it’s still unclear whether Karlsson fits the Pens’ longer-term plans or if they’re ready to reset and move that contract elsewhere.For a playoff-ready team looking to add serious blue-line firepower, Karlsson could be a game-changer. And now that the money’s not quite so scary, the phones might start ringing again. Elliotte Friedman’s update just quietly reignited the Erik Karlsson trade market. With the bonus money paid and the real cost lowered, NHL teams are suddenly looking at Karlsson through a very different lens.The cap hit is still huge. But the cash isn’t. That makes this story one to watch closely in the coming weeks.Also read - Leon Draisaitl sends 29 mysterious boxes a year to his former team — the reason is actually heartwarming","The bonus on Erik Karlsson’s contract has already been paid, and that changes everything.

Former NBA player LiAngelo Ball recently filed for divorce from Rashida Nicole. This happened days after the influencer revealed that she was expecting the couple's child. However, TMZ Sports claims that they have already decided to part ways. According to the publication, the former NBA player went to a Southern California courthouse on July 3 to file the divorce. Although it's unclear when the couple were married, witnesses have reported seeing them leave the same SoCal courtroom in February while holding a big packet and dressed all in white.Once again, LiAngelo Ball is in the news, but this time, not for basketball. The rapper and former UCLA baller, who gained popularity for his viral song ""Tweaker,"" has formally filed for divorce from his wife, Rashida Nicole. The announcement came just a few days after she made her pregnancy public.Since there didn't seem to be any recent turmoil between the couple, at least not on the internet, fans were taken aback by the decision. Moreover, there had been no recent indications of conflict between the two as well.Furthermore, when Rashida Nicole disclosed on June 26 that she and her now-former husband were expecting a child together, he ""liked"" the post.He even commented with a lock and key and a heart emoji. Nevertheless, this sudden news shocked everyone.However, this wasn’t the first time LiAngelo Ball made the news in recent days. Nikki Mudarris, the mother of his other children, recently claimed that the rapper abandoned her and the family soon after she gave birth to their second child. Mudarris said on her Instagram page:""We spent 3 1/2 years together, and last week he decided to walk out on his kids and tell me he got someone else pregnant (allegedly) and now is creating a new life with her.”The former NBA player retaliated shortly after Nikki made her accusations. He said that although he had broken up with Nikki, he had not left his kids behind. He further commented:“I’ll never leave or ‘abandon’ any of my kids, so we can dead that right now… I love all my children,” he declared.Now, with a baby on the way and a divorce underway, both the rapper and the influencer are entering a new chapter of their lives. As of now, neither party has made a public statement regarding the divorce filing. Fans will likely be watching closely for any updates in the coming weeks.Also read: Lonzo Ball fires back at critics of LaMelo, LiAngelo, and Ball family legacy: “It doesn't really change my life”","LiAngelo Ball filed for divorce from his wife, Rashida Nicole, on July 3.

(Getty Images)

Joe Burrow gave off “serial killer vibes” at 9, according to his sociology professor coach



“His blood pressure doesn’t change. Thank God he’s not using his talents for bad—he could be the next Dexter.”

“He is a stone-cold killer,”

Good thing Joe chose touchdowns, not true crime



Long before Joe Burrow became Joe Cool and started torching NFL defenses with the calm of a heart surgeon, he had already left one adult genuinely shook with how unbothered he was even as a nine-year-old. And we’re not talking about some random rec league coach.His youth basketball coach, who was also a sociology professor at Ohio University, once told Joe’s parents that their son was so emotionally controlled, so laser-focused, he could either be a first responder… or a serial criminal.Yes, Dexter. The fictional serial killer.The context behind the quote is just as wild. Joe’s team was down late in a game, and he coolly dropped nine points in the final 30 seconds, including seven straight free throws to complete the comeback. While the crowd lost its mind, Joe? Ice cold. No flex. No emotion. Just business.That was the moment his coach, studying human behavior as part of his actual job, realized Joe Burrow was built differently. And maybe a little scarily.We’ve seen this same demeanor time and again in the NFL, throwing darts in a collapsing pocket, calmly dissecting playoff defenses, walking into Arrowhead and treating it like his backyard. This isn’t something Joe Burrow learned. It’s just how he’s wired. Even his childhood coach could see that “killer instinct” from day one.the coach reportedly added, clearly impressed, but also a little shook.Thankfully for Cincinnati (and let’s be honest, the entire population), Joe Burrow’s laser-focused intensity and eerie calmness found a home on the football field not in some Dexter-style double life. Imagine what that level of emotional control could’ve meant in the wrong hands.It’s no surprise, really. Burrow has become known for staying ice-cold under pressure whether it’s the national title game or a playoff drive in Arrowhead. But what’s chilling is that his now-famous composure was spotted way before he ever threw a football on national TV. A college professor-slash-coach saw that steely stillness in 9-year-old Joe and seriously wondered if he was too calm to be normal.The kid could hit game-winners and walk away like he just took out the trash. No emotion. No heartbeat spike. Just... silence.He didn’t just earn the nickname “Joe Cool” in college, he was born that way. Calm, calculated, and quietly dangerous. And that’s exactly what makes him terrifying to play against.Also read - Cardi B and Stefon Diggs just shut down breakup rumors with a surprise workout video",Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow has become known for staying ice-cold under pressure.

Inside Edgbaston: A Complete Stadium Tour

Kohli says age is catching up

London: The Indian team got an opportunity to spend some time with former players at a charity event here on Tuesday night, where they got a taste of the growing buzz around them after the dominating win at Edgbaston.The event saw stars like Sachin Tendulkar, Ravi Shastri, Brian Lara, Ashish Nehra, Chris Gayle and Kevin Pietersen heap praise on the Indian team’s turnaround in the series. For most of the evening, Yuvraj Singh , who has been one of Shubman Gill ’s early mentors, emphasised the role of chief selector Ajit Agarkar and head coach Gautam Gambhir for the promising performances by the Indian players.“Agarkar and Gautam don’t get enough credit when the team does well. They get criticized when the team loses. Since Agarkar has come in as chief selector, India have played the final of the ODI World Cup, won the T20 World Cup, won the Champions Trophy and now they have created history at Edgbaston.Both of them are doing great work,” Yuvraj said at the gala dinner organized to raise funds for cancer treatment through the YOUWECAN foundation. Yuvraj also said that both Gill and Rishabh Pant are doing great work with the team. He has seen Gill from a very young age.“I have seen Gill’s growth. He was always the hardest worker in a team. He has taken the responsibility of Test captaincy head on and he is the perfect man for the job.I must say Rishabh has been fantastic because of the way he has come back from the accident and is now part of this leadership group,” he added. Virat Kohli arrived after the Indian team had left the venue. He candidly highlighted how he is ageing fast and that is that prompted him to take a call on his career.“I have to dye my beard every second day. Once that starts happening, you know it’s time,” he smiled. “It was great to watch the Indian team win the Edgbaston Test. Nothing beats doing well in Test cricket.”Shastri chose to credit Kohli for India’s aggressive attitude in the ongoing Test series. “If this young team is playing the cricket that we are seeing, it’s because of Virat. He has been the best ambassador for Test cricket in the last decade. He is the reason why India is competing hard in Test cricket,” Shastri said.","The Indian team got a taste of the growing buzz around them after the dominating win at Edgbaston.
