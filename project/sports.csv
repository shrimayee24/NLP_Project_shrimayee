Looking back at phase 1



Bihar is all set for the second and final phase of assembly elections on Tuesday, November 11, with the stakes high for both the ruling NDA and the opposition INDIA bloc. The electoral fate of 1,302 candidates, including over half a dozen ministers in the Nitish Kumar-led government, will be decided by 3.7 crore voters across 122 constituencies.Security arrangements have been tightened across Bihar, with more than four lakh personnel deployed to ensure smooth polling. Bomb disposal squads and paramilitary forces are on alert, and senior officials have been instructed to personally oversee arrangements on polling day.The final round of voting spans several northern and eastern districts -- West Champaran, East Champaran, Sitamarhi, Madhubani, Supaul, Araria, and Kishanganj -- any of which border Nepal.The Seemanchal belt, stretching across Araria, Kishanganj, and Supaul, is being closely watched for its religious and caste complexities. The Champaran region, on the other hand, will test the BJP’s hold among traditional upper-caste and OBC voters.This region holds a significant Muslim population, making it a decisive battleground for both alliances.For the NDA, which accuses the opposition of “protecting infiltrators,” and for the INDIA bloc, which relies heavily on minority support, the Seemanchal vote could shape the final outcome.Among the most high-profile candidates is Bijendra Prasad Yadav, a veteran JD(U) leader and the state’s senior-most cabinet member, who seeks to retain his Supaul seat for an eighth term.His colleague Prem Kumar (BJP), contesting from Gaya Town, hopes for an eighth straight victory since 1990. Other ministers in the fray include Renu Devi (Bettiah), Neeraj Kumar Singh “Bablu” (Chhatapur), Leshi Singh (Dhamdaha), Sheela Mandal (Phulparas), and Zama Khan (Chainpur).Former deputy CM Tarkishore Prasad of the BJP will test his strength in Katihar, aiming for a fifth consecutive term.For smaller NDA allies like Jitan Ram Manjhi’s Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) and Upendra Kushwaha’s Rashtriya Lok Morcha (RLM), this phase is a litmus test.HAM, which is contesting six seats, including Imamganj (held by Manjhi’s daughter-in-law Dipa), will look to retain its turf.RLM, still new to Bihar politics, has fielded Upendra Kushwaha’s wife Snehlata (Sasaram) and Madhaw Anand (Madhubani), both making their debut.On the INDIA bloc’s side, Congress state president Rajesh Kumar is defending Kutumba, while CPI(ML)’s Mehboob Alam (Balrampur) and Congress’s Shakeel Ahmad Khan (Kadwa) aim for hat-trick wins.A fresh face to watch is Chanakya Prakash Ranjan, son of JD(U) MP Giridhari Yadav, who defected to the RJD and is contesting Belhar — a contest that’s stirred interest for its dynastic twist.This phase also features several political turncoats:Voting will take place at 45,399 polling stations, with 40,073 in rural areas. Of the 3.7 crore voters, 1.75 crore are women, and more than half (2.28 crore) are aged between 30 and 60 years.The Hisua seat in Nawada has the largest electorate at 3.67 lakh, while Lauria, Chanpatia, Raxaul, Triveniganj, Sugauli, and Banmakhi each have 22 candidates vying for victory.The first phase of polling, held across 121 constituencies, recorded the highest-ever voter turnout in the state's electoral history, over 65%, setting the stage for a nail-biting finale in phase 2.","Bihar is all set for the second and final phase of assembly elections on Tuesday, November 11.

Klay Thompson apologizes to Megan Thee Stallion after airport mishap





Megan Thee Stallion on her relationship with Klay Thompson





Klay Thompson might be known for his calm demeanor on the court, but off it, the Dallas Mavericks star recently showed his softer side. After arriving late to pick up his girlfriend, rapper Megan Thee Stallion , from the airport, Thompson went viral for his heartfelt apology and his remorse. The clip, shared by Megan on social media, captured the NBA star trying to make amends with flowers in hand and genuine regret on his face.The moment quickly became a talking point among fans, who couldn’t get enough of the couple’s chemistry and Thompson’s down-to-earth approach. It also comes at a time when both are thriving in their respective careers, with Thompson beginning his new season in Dallas and Megan releasing new music inspired by their relationship.In the video posted online, Klay Thompson can be seen handing Megan a bouquet while apologizing repeatedly for showing up late. “Roses for my boo,” he said while driving her home. “I’m sorry I was late, babe. Damn it. I’m sorry. I thought I timed it well. Ah, just sorry. There’s no excuse.”Fans immediately flooded social media with amused and affectionate reactions, praising Thompson’s gesture as “adorably human.” The incident added another viral moment to their growing list of public appearances since confirming their romance earlier this year.Over the summer, the couple enjoyed a fishing trip that gave fans a glimpse into their playful dynamic. “So today, Klay is taking me on another adventure and we’re going fishing,” Megan said at the time. Thompson responded lovingly: “I got my queen on board, of course I feel cool. I’m the coolest guy in this harbor!”For Megan, whose real name is Megan Jovon Ruth Pete, the relationship marks a new chapter. “This is my first relationship where I’ve ever been with somebody who’s genuinely a nice person, and he makes me genuinely happy,” she told Page Six.“I just never dated somebody like him before and I’m just grateful that he’s here by my side and he feels the same way about me.”Despite occasional public skepticism — even from personalities like Shaquille O’Neal, who jokingly doubted their relationship on The Big Podcast — fans have embraced the pair’s authenticity. O’Neal later called Megan “athletic, so beautiful, and so gorgeous,” insisting his remarks were lighthearted.For now, Thompson and Megan seem unfazed by outside opinions. Their recent viral moment only serves to extend a genuine connection between two stars from different worlds. The duo has been very active on social media to share their personal moments of joy and love. Megan has over 32.7 million followers on Instagram, while Thomson has 16.8 million fans on the platform.Stallion is fully embracing her lover girl era — and fans are loving it. The three-time Grammy winner took to Instagram to tease a behind-the-scenes look at her new single “Lover Girl,” a song she openly admits is inspired by her boyfriend, NBA star Klay Thompson.“This is my song about Klay,” Megan said in the clip with a shy smile. “First n**** in life that has ever gotten a song outta me.” Fans quickly flooded the comments, cheering for the rapper’s happiness and her growing romance with the four-time NBA champion.Listeners have already picked up on the deeper meaning behind “Lover Girl.” In the track, Megan raps about finding someone who truly matches her energy and confidence. “Ayy, your n**** fantasy, my man reality,” she spits, celebrating a relationship built on mutual respect and balance.Also Read: NBA’s highly anticipated Europe-based league’s potential release date revealed","Klay Thompson arrived late to pick up his girlfriend, rapper Megan Thee Stallion, from the airport.

Chiefs tight end Noah Gray earns NFL Salute to Service nomination as Travis Kelce successor buzz intensifies in Kansas City,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/chiefs-tight-end-noah-gray-earns-nfl-salute-to-service-nomination-as-travis-kelce-successor-buzz-intensifies-in-kansas-city/articleshow/125197721.cms,"Buzz is that Noah Gray might replace Travis Kelce as latter nears season ends.

Noah Gray’s off-field leadership draws praise



More NFL coverage:

The Kansas City Chiefs could soon face a major transition. With Travis Kelce widely expected to retire after the 2025 NFL season, the franchise is preparing for life without its future Hall of Famer. Since confirming his return earlier this year, the 36-year-old has hinted that this might be his final run, telling reporters back in September, “Man, it’s the last one on the contract right now. ”As the season unfolds, attention has shifted toward finding the right player to carry the torch. Inside the organization, tight end Noah Gray has quietly earned respect both on and off the field and his recent nomination for the 2025 NFL Salute to Service Award shows just that. The recognition, presented by the NFL and USAA, honors individuals across the league who have showed exceptional commitment to supporting members of the U.S. military.Noah Gray’s passion for service is rooted in his close partnership with Friends in Service of Heroes (FISH), a Kansas City nonprofit that aids active-duty personnel, reservists, veterans, and their families. His involvement with the organization began in 2021 and has since become a cornerstone of his community work.Through FISH, Gray has helped provide service dogs and adaptive equipment to assist veterans, supported families during the holidays, and offered comfort to those struggling after service. His efforts have not only strengthened the Chiefs’ local ties but also highlighted his character as one of the team’s most respected young leaders.Still, while Gray is gaining momentum, the Chiefs’ long-term succession plan may extend beyond their current roster. NFL Draft analyst Nick Baumgardner of The New York Times recently projected Oregon tight end Kenyon Sadiq as a player to watch. Standing 6-foot-3 and weighing 245 pounds, Sadiq has totaled 22 catches for 311 yards and five touchdowns this season, averaging 14.1 yards per reception. He earned an 80.4 grade from Pro Football Focus, ranking second nationally among returning tight ends, and Baumgardner has him listed as the No. 26 overall prospect in the 2026 NFL Draft.For now, Chiefs fans are showing their support for Gray, who has become a symbol of consistency and heart within the locker room. The NFL will reveal the finalists for the Salute to Service Award in January, with the winner honored during the NFL Honors ceremony leading up to the Super Bowl. Regardless of who follows Travis Kelce, Noah Gray’s leadership, on and off the field, is already helping define the next chapter in Kansas City.",Noah Gray has been nominated for the 2025 NFL Salute to Service Award.

“We recognized some things were going wrong with her about ten years ago… We thought it was menopause… We buried my mom. She had Alzheimer’s. My mother-in-law was living with us because she had Alzheimer’s. And now we thought my wife was going through menopause at 49 because she’s coming at 50.”

She detailed her journey of shifting from supporting her partner's career to rediscovering her own dreams and defining personal success. Bündchen emphasizes her graciousness towards Brady, highlighting her focus on authenticity and fulfillment in her new chapter.

The shifting balance between support, career and self-fulfillment

Moving from high-stakes partnership to reinventing life on her own terms





In her March 2023 interview with Vanity Fair, supermodel Gisele Bündchen opened up about her 13-year marriage to former NFL quarterback Tom Brady, how their lives evolved, and what she discovered in the space that followed. While details of their split had played out in headlines, Bündchen offered fresh context and a more nuanced perspective.Gisele Bündchen admitted that “It’s like a death and a rebirth,” and described her own shift from supporting a partner’s career to rediscovering her personal dreams. Her reflections reveal not just a high-profile breakup, but a woman reclaiming her voice and defining success on her own terms.When Gisele Bündchen met Tom Brady at age 26, she said she was “so ready” for family and partnership. Traditionally one of the world’s highest-earning models, she gradually scaled back her runway work after 2015 to support the family life they were building.Gisele Bündchen describes relocating to Tampa without ever having lived there before: “When we moved to Tampa, I actually had never been there before. I just arrived and that was my life.” Yet despite her enormous success, much of the public narrative painted her as “against football” or overshadowed by Brady’s career, a portrayal she calls “very hurtful” and “the craziest thing I’ve ever heard.”Bündchen underscores that marriage didn’t unravel overnight. “That takes years to happen.” As she puts it: “Sometimes you grow together; sometimes you grow apart … When you love someone, you don’t put them in a jail and say, ‘You have to live this life.’ You set them free to be who they are.”Gisele Bündchen's message: supporting someone doesn’t mean losing yourself, and that truth became clearer to her as her kids grew and her dreams quietly changed..Today, Gisele Bündchen speaks of her next act in Costa Rica, building a home, raising her children, and exploring wellness and nature far from red carpets. She asserts, “I have my own dreams.”While Tom Brady continued his historic career, Bündchen’s focus shifted inward. She embraced spiritual practices, daily rituals, and the idea that success is not just professional acclaim but authenticity and fulfillment. She says the breakup felt like both a loss and a liberation, “I believed in fairy tales when I was a kid. I think it’s beautiful to believe in that.”Gisele Bündchen's reflection on Brady is remarkably gracious. “Listen, I have always cheered for him, and I would continue forever … If there’s one person I want to be the happiest in the world, it’s him.”In doing so, Bündchen rejects reductive headlines and stereotypes, choosing instead to present a fuller picture of love, change and self-discovery. As she said, “What’s been said is one piece of a much bigger puzzle. It’s not so black and white.”In the end, this isn’t a story solely of one of fashion’s biggest icons stepping aside. It’s the story of a woman stepping forward, redefining what a chapter ends and a new one begins.Also Read: Gisele Bündchen’s post divorce evolution raises question: did Tom Brady underestimate what letting her go would cost him?",Supermodel Gisele Bündchen opened up about her 13-year marriage to former NFL quarterback Tom Brady.

Trey Benson Week 11 update: Jonathan Gannon details Cardinals RB’s recovery and return





More coverage in NFL:

The Arizona Cardinals are navigating a critical stretch in their 2025 season as running back Trey Benson works toward returning from a knee injury suffered in Week 4. Benson has been on injured reserve for several weeks, forcing the team to adjust its backfield rotation. While he became eligible to return last week, he did not play against the Seattle Seahawks, leaving his Week 11 status uncertain.The Cardinals’ rushing attack has faced challenges in Benson’s absence, especially with fellow back Bam Knight exiting Week 10 with an ankle injury. With the team balancing player health and roster flexibility, Benson’s potential return is under careful evaluation, and his activation could have significant implications for Arizona’s offensive game plan in Week 11.The team continues to monitor Benson’s progress closely, assessing his readiness before making any roster decisions. His rehab has shown steady improvement, and the Cardinals are taking a cautious approach to ensure he returns fully healthy. The backfield situation remains a top priority as the team prepares for Week 11. Benson’s Week 11 availability could be a game-changer for the Arizona Cardinals’ rushing attack.“He’s doing well. Take it day-by-day there,” head coach Jonathan Gannon said regarding Benson’s progress. “He’s not gonna be out there today, but he is doing better. What does close mean? I don’t know what close means. Take it day-by-day, but he’s doing well. He’s progressing.”Benson must first be designated to return from injured reserve, which would trigger a 21-day window for activation to the 53-man roster. If he is not activated within that period, he would miss the remainder of the 2025 season. His availability is particularly important with Bam Knight’s ankle issue leaving the backfield depth uncertain. Should both Benson and Knight be unavailable, Emari Demercado is expected to lead the backfield, with Michael Carter providing backup support.Monitoring Wednesday’s roster updates will provide clarity on whether Benson will suit up for Week 11. His activation could be crucial for the Cardinals’ rushing strategy and offensive flexibility as the team navigates a critical part of its 2025 schedule. With the season entering a decisive stretch, Benson’s status may influence how Arizona approaches its remaining games and manages its running back rotation.","Trey Benson has been out since Week 4 with a knee injury.

Tom Brady reacts publicly to Drew Brees replacing Mark Sanchez at FOX Sports

Drew Brees steps into Mark Sanchez’s former role as Brady highlights the accuracy conversation





Tom Brady reacted to Drew Brees taking over Mark Sanchez’s spot at FOX Sports, and the response instantly pulled attention across the NFL . The move puts two of the most accurate quarterbacks in league history under the same network roof, and Brady made sure the focus keyword, Tom Brady, was in the first line as he set the tone with his usual dry-fire humor.Brees’ hiring comes as FOX Sports officially parted ways with Sanchez following his ongoing felony case. The network announced Brees’ arrival with a highlight reel, and Brady immediately jumped in with a punchy, public welcome. The two quarterbacks now headline a reshaped analyst lineup built on production, accuracy and career-long credibility.Tom Brady did not hold back when FOX Sports confirmed Drew Brees as the new analyst replacing Mark Sanchez. Brady shared FOX Sports’ announcement clip and attached a line that instantly made waves across social media. His message read:“And just like that I become the 3rd most accurate QB at @FOXSports (Terry still has both of us beat) Welcome to the family @drewbrees!!!”The accuracy comment was rooted in fact. Drew Brees retired with a 67.7% completion rate, which places him third all time behind Joe Burrow and Tua Tagovailoa. Brady’s reaction added a layer of self-awareness and competition that people rarely hear from him, and it worked because the numbers back all of it.Brees is stepping into a major role. FOX Sports expects him to call games with Adam Amin starting next week and remain on the team through at least 2026. He already has experience across NBC Sports, ESPN’s “First Take” and Netflix’s international game coverage. FOX Sports is betting on a quarterback who built his legacy on precision, control and film-room mastery.Mark Sanchez’s exit shifts the balance of FOX’s broadcast team. According to multiple outlets, FOX Sports cut ties as Sanchez faces a felony battery case in Indiana. He pleaded not guilty, and the legal process is ongoing. FOX Sports confirmed to The Athletic that he is no longer part of the broadcast crew. The decision opened the lane for Brees, and Brady’s reaction shows that the quarterback fraternity is already treating the move as a major shakeup.Brady and Brees owned their era, stacking numbers that still look unreal. Tom Brady started 333 games, threw for 89,214 yards, 649 touchdowns, and finished with a 251-82 record, putting him first all time in passing yards, passing touchdowns, completions, attempts, and starts. Drew Brees wasn’t far behind, going 172-114 with 80,358 yards and 571 touchdowns while completing nearly 68% of his throws. He ranks second in league history in completions, attempts, yards, and touchdowns, sitting right behind Brady in every major category.Tom Brady completely lost it in the booth after Matthew Stafford uncorked a filthy no look touchdown during the Rams-49ers matchup, and the moment was pure chaos in the best way. Stafford was cooking all afternoon, dropping 280 yards and four scores as the Rams buried San Francisco 42–26, but that no look dart to Colby Parkinson flipped Brady into full fan mode on live TV. The man practically bounced in his seat with Kevin Burkhardt as he shouted, “Look at those eyes. Don’t look at me! Don’t look at my eyes! Don’t look at my eyes!” Stafford barely glanced at his target before firing a laser into the end zone, and Brady reacted like he’d just watched a magician pull off the trick of the year.Drew Brees enters FOX Sports at a moment when the network needs stability, professionalism and credibility in the booth. He retired with 80,358 passing yards, 571 touchdowns and one of the most efficient careers the league has ever seen. The numbers place him behind Tom Brady in yardage and touchdowns but ahead of almost everyone in accuracy and consistency.Brees shared his own statement following the announcement. He said:“I appreciate the opportunity FOX has given me in the booth and with their team. I hope my passion for this game is reflected in the knowledge and insight I provide to fans each Sunday.”His arrival is rooted in a reputation built across two decades with the New Orleans Saints and the San Diego Chargers. Former teammate Darren Sproles described Brees’ leadership on “Up & Adams,” saying:“For him, to mention me out of all the weapons that he had. That is very special. With Drew, you didn’t have to think like that on the field. Drew always put you in the right place at the right time.”These details matter because FOX Sports is replacing a quarterback known for chaotic storylines with one known for structure and precision. Mark Sanchez’s legal issues removed him from the booth as he deals with felony battery and multiple misdemeanor charges after an incident in Indianapolis earlier this year. He had already been sidelined after being stabbed and arrested on the same night. He pleaded not guilty and awaits further proceedings.Drew Brees offers none of the uncertainty, and that is part of the reason FOX Sports moved quickly. He already worked on NBC’s Notre Dame broadcasts, contributed to Football Night in America, and appeared on “First Take” before signing with FOX Sports. His presence turns the broadcast team into a high-accuracy, high-football-IQ group, which pairs naturally with the tone Tom Brady wants to bring to television.Brady himself is walking into his own broadcast era. He will be in the booth this Sunday covering the Detroit Lions and Washington Commanders, while the New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers face each other in one of the biggest matchups of the weekend. Brady refused to pick a side in the game, saying:“Just... don’t ask me to pick any sides here.”","Tom Brady welcomed Drew Brees to FOX Sports after Mark Sanchez’s exit. The move puts two of the most accurate quarterbacks in league history under the same network roof. The network announced Brees’ arrival with a highlight reel, and Brady immediately jumped in with a punchy, public welcome.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125185386,imgsize-19200,width-400,resizemode-4/tom-brady-reacts-drew-brees-replaces-mark-sanchez-fox-sports.jpg"

The untold story of Josh Jacobs’s parents and their fight to give him a better life



More NFL coverage

When Josh Jacobs locks in, the world fades. Inside the red zone, his focus narrows to one thing — the end zone. The roar of the crowd, the shuffle of defenders, even the sidelines disappear from view. “We call it flow state,” Jacobs said last month. “You become out of body almost.” That rare mental clarity has turned him into one of the NFL ’s most relentless running backs — a player who thrives under pressure and makes the impossible look effortless.Selected to the NFL All-Rookie Team in 2019, Jacobs’ rise was fast and fearless. He hit the 1,000-yard mark in his first two seasons, earned a Pro Bowl selection in 2020, and by 2022, led the league with 1,653 rushing yards. His move to the Green Bay Packers in 2024 marked a new chapter — and he’s wasted no time making his mark. With 42 carries, 150 rushing yards, and two touchdowns in his first two games of 2025, he’s already extended his touchdown streak to 10 consecutive matches, just shy of an NFL record. But beyond his on-field glory, fans are just as intrigued by the story behind the star — his family.Josh Jacobs’ father, Marty Jacobs, has long been the heart behind his son’s success.After divorcing Josh’s mother, LaChelle, in 2006, Marty took custody of their four children despite having little money. They lived out of a car or in low-cost motels in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Marty juggled multiple jobs, often skipping meals so his children wouldn’t go hungry. His strength and sacrifice shaped Josh’s resilience and drive — qualities that later defined his career. Today, Marty watches proudly from the stands and mentors young athletes, passing forward the lessons that carried his family through hardship.Josh’s mother, LaChelle Jacobs, also played a part in his early life. Following the divorce, she initially raised their five children alone. However, their relationship eventually grew strained, with reports of financial disputes and emotional distance. Josh ultimately chose to live with his father, whose perseverance became his guiding light.Of Filipino and African American descent, Jacobs celebrates both sides of his heritage. His Filipino grandmother, from Angeles City, left a lasting impression on him — so much so that he tattooed her portrait on his left hand. His dual heritage is a badge of pride, one he carries into every game as one of the few Filipino Americans in the NFL.From sleeping in cars to lighting up stadiums, Josh Jacobs’ journey mirrors his father’s unbreakable spirit. Their bond, forged through struggle, remains his greatest victory.","Josh Jacobs’ father, Marty Jacobs, has long been the heart behind his son’s success.

Bill Belichick and the North Carolina Tar Heels are finding their rhythm after a rocky start to the season. The Tar Heels defeated Stanford 20-15 on Saturday, earning their second straight win and improving to 4-5. With three games left, they need two more victories to become bowl eligible, a goal that now looks much more achievable under Belichick’s leadership.Yet, the attention after the game wasn’t only on the field. Belichick’s girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, became a trending topic when she was spotted wearing a “banned” necklace. The statement accessory appeared to reference earlier reports claiming she had been barred from UNC’s football facilities. Her appearance quickly caught media attention and fueled discussions online, adding a new twist to the Belichick era in Chapel Hill.Following the victory, Belichick openly admitted that he could have handled certain aspects of the season better. The veteran coach said he and his staff have learned more about their players as the season has progressed and have made key adjustments that have led to improved performance.“I think we have tried to do that more as we’ve gone forward, and I think it’s benefitted some of them.Some of those if we could have identified it a little bit sooner, that would have been helpful, but we didn’t and it’s nobody’s fault, it’s just kind of the way it was. ” Belichick said after the game.Those adjustments are starting to show results. The Tar Heels have tightened their defense, improved communication on the field, and found balance on offense. Belichick’s focus on player development and situational football has helped turn close losses into hard-fought wins. His willingness to evolve has given the Tar Heels a renewed sense of confidence and direction.Meanwhile, UNC officials clarified that Jordon Hudson has not been banned from the program. The university stated that she remains welcome at team facilities and continues to assist with Belichick’s personal brand management outside his official football duties.As the Tar Heels push for bowl eligibility, Belichick’s leadership and adaptability are shaping the team’s late-season identity. While off-field stories may grab headlines, the focus in Chapel Hill remains on finishing strong and proving that the team’s recent success is no coincidence.","Bill Belichick and the North Carolina Tar Heels are finding their rhythm after a rocky start to the season.

Donald Trump and Taylor Swift end up linked again after the Commanders crowd boos him

The Taylor Swift reaction follows Donald Trump into every NFL moment he attends

Donald Trump’s old Taylor Swift post is back in the spotlight after he was loudly booed during the Washington Commanders and Detroit Lions game on Nov. 9. The moment spread online almost instantly because the history between Donald Trump and Taylor Swift has become its own cultural storyline inside and outside the NFL.The resurfaced Truth Social post hit social media within minutes of the crowd’s reaction. The timing brought Trump’s long list of comments about Taylor Swift back into circulation at the exact moment he faced the same treatment she experienced at Super Bowl LIX.Donald Trump appeared at Northwest Stadium with House Speaker Mike Johnson, becoming the first sitting president in nearly fifty years to attend a regular-season NFL game. When he showed up on the videoboard during the first half, the crowd reacted with clear boos and some scattered applause. A similar response followed during a halftime military oath ceremony.The online reaction moved fast. X account @dontblamealex posted the clip of the boos alongside an old Truth Social message Trump wrote about Taylor Swift in February. The caption referenced Swift’s lyric “Karma is a relaxing thought,” and the clip passed a lot of views as it continued to spread.Trump’s original post came from Super Bowl LIX, where Swift was shown on the stadium screen and met with loud boos from Eagles fans. Trump wrote, “The only one that had a tougher night than the Kansas City Chiefs was Taylor Swift. She got BOOED out of the Stadium. MAGA is very unforgiving!”NBC News and the Associated Press reported at the time that the boos came from Eagles fans who were responding to their rivalry with the Kansas City Chiefs. Trump framed it as a political moment, which kept the story alive long after the Super Bowl ended.Swift reportedly laughed at the reaction in New Orleans. The public tension between Donald Trump and Taylor Swift dates back to her endorsement of former Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 election cycle. Trump previously wrote, “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,” which remains one of his most widely circulated posts.The resurfaced post created a fresh wave of conversation around Donald Trump, Taylor Swift, and the way their names keep colliding with NFL storylines. Trump has alternated between attacking Taylor Swift online and praising her relationship with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. In August, he congratulated the couple on their engagement and said, “Well, I wish them a lot of luck. I think he’s a great player, he’s a great guy. I think that she’s a terrific person, so I wish them a lot of luck.”The White House then brought Taylor Swift into the center of attention again when its official TikTok account used her track “The Life of Ophelia” in a new video. The clip paired her lyrics with Trump’s mug shot and other footage related to his political career. Fans called out the video across TikTok, including one comment that said, “His obsession with her needs to be studied it’s wild really.”There is more history behind all of this. Trump previously posted AI-generated images that falsely suggested Swift endorsed him during the 2024 race. Those images were debunked immediately, and Swift has never supported him politically.Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce has kept his responses measured when asked about Trump’s presence at major games. Ahead of Super Bowl LIX, Kelce told reporters on Feb. 5, “That’s awesome. It’s a great honor. I think you know, no matter who the president is, I know I’m excited because it’s the biggest game of my life, you know, and having the president there, it’s the best country in the world, and that’s pretty cool. ”The resurfaced post now adds another layer to the long, tense timeline between Donald Trump and Taylor Swift. Every time either one appears at an NFL event, the conversation connects them again. With Trump back in public stadiums and Swift still tied to the league through Kelce, this cycle is not slowing down any time soon.","Donald Trump was booed during the Washington Commanders and Detroit Lions game on Nov. 9.

How the fight between Daron Payne and Amon Ra St Brown escalated and why the league stepped in

What losing Daron Payne means for a Washington Commanders team collapsing under its own weight

Daron Payne’s suspension dropped on Monday, and it hit a Washington Commanders team that already looks broken. The defensive tackle was punished one game after punching Detroit Lions wide receiver Amon Ra St Brown during Sunday’s 44 to 22 loss. The league called it a violation of the rules that prohibit striking an opponent in the head or neck area.The punch happened after Detroit scored in the second quarter. Amon Ra St Brown walked through the middle of the field, said something to Daron Payne, and Payne responded by swinging at him. The moment went viral because the celebration before it involved Amon Ra St Brown pointing toward a suite where President Donald Trump was sitting. The Commanders fell apart from there.The NFL reviewed the play and announced the suspension without pay. NFL Network’s Mike Garafolo reported that Daron Payne can appeal, but he is expected to miss Washington’s game against the Miami Dolphins in Madrid. The league’s decision aligned with earlier discipline in 2025, including the one game handed to Philadelphia Eagles defensive tackle Jalen Carter for spitting on Dak Prescott.Washington players argued that Daron Payne reacted to an earlier hit. Defensive tackle Javon Kinlaw insisted Amon Ra St Brown threw the first punch.Kinlaw told reporters, “It’s some bulls… 100 percent. Daron retaliated. The refs literally saw the first punch. I do not blame him for the way he reacted. Tempers got to flaring.”Amon Ra St Brown gave a different account. He said, “Two plays before that we got into a little scuffle, back and forth. Then we end up scoring and I go up to him. I say a little something, nothing crazy, and then he decides to swing on me.”The touchdown that sparked the situation came on a drive where Detroit controlled the field. Amon Ra St Brown scored, pointed up at the suite where Trump was located, and did his signature dance. Daron Payne punched him moments later, and officials ejected him.Detroit dominated from that point on. Jared Goff threw for 320 yards and three touchdowns. The Lions averaged 8.8 yards per play, and Washington delivered its worst defensive outing since 2014. Washington committed three personal fouls during the game. Javon Kinlaw struck an official during the same sequence. Quan Martin said he was kicked during a separate play, which led to another unsportsmanlike conduct flag.Former Washington quarterback Robert Griffin III also weighed in. He posted on X, “As a leader of Washington’s defense, Daron Payne should know better than to throw a punch on the field. He should be suspended. There is no place for this in sports.”The suspension hits a team that is already hanging together by threads. Washington is 3 and 7. It has lost four straight games by at least 20 points. The Commanders entered the year as a trendy NFC pick after reaching the NFC Championship Game last season. Now they have a 1 percent playoff chance and no clear path out.Rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels remains sidelined with an elbow injury. The team has not placed him on injured reserve, but there is no timeline for return. Marcus Mariota has stepped in and has not been able to produce enough offense to keep games competitive. The locker room looks frustrated, and the sideline looks lost.Head coach Dan Quinn made it clear that Washington has not met its own standard. He said, “We make a big deal about our Commander standards, and we sure as hell are not coaching or playing up to it. We are way off, and that is up to us to fix that.”Losing Daron Payne only deepens the problem. He holds a 76.0 PFSN impact grade, ranking 37th among eligible defensive tackles. He is one of the highest paid interior defenders in the league and is due more than one million dollars per game. If the suspension stands, he loses that check. It was also the first ejection of his career.The fallout goes beyond money. Washington’s defense has struggled to generate pressure or stop the run. Removing one of the only stable veterans makes a weak unit weaker. The mistakes on Sunday showed a team losing emotional control during the hardest stretch of its season.The moment exposed what the record already said. Washington is not disciplined, not healthy, and not close to the version of itself that played deep into January last year. Daron Payne will be eligible to return after the Dolphins game. The bigger issue is whether any part of this season is still salvageable.",Washington Commanders defensive tackle is suspended one game after punching Amon Ra St. Brown during Washington’s 44 to 22 loss.

Leadership mistakes that led to Brian Daboll’s firing and Giants’ losing streak



More coverage in NFL:

Brian Daboll’s tenure with the New York Giants has come to an end. Once hailed as the NFL Coach of the Year after leading the team to its first playoff win since Super Bowl 46, Daboll’s early success masked underlying issues that ultimately derailed his career in New York. The Giants’ leadership decided to part ways following yet another fourth-quarter collapse, extending the team’s losing streak and highlighting deeper problems both on and off the field.The fall from grace has been swift. Daboll’s four-year run began with promise, including a 7-2 start in 2022 and a high-profile playoff victory, earning him league-wide accolades. However, since 2023, the Giants’ record has plummeted to 5-22, leaving Daboll with a career record of 20-40-1 and a dismal NFC East performance of 5-17-1. Frustration mounted as repeated blown leads, sideline outbursts, and questionable decision-making overshadowed his early achievements.Reports indicate that internal conflicts and inconsistent leadership played a major role in Daboll’s downfall. Feuds with defensive coordinator Wink Martindale, sideline meltdowns, and clashes over player accountability created a fractured environment. Daboll’s player-friendly approach, while initially praised, failed to instill discipline, resulting in costly mistakes and a lack of cohesion on both offense and defense.Controversial decisions, including risky play calls for rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart, further fueled criticism, especially after multiple injuries raised concerns about team safety.Daboll’s firing also raises questions about the Giants’ long-term direction. With Kafka stepping in, the team faces an uphill battle to stabilize its roster and culture. Analysts point to a combination of coaching missteps, draft struggles, and player development issues as key factors in the franchise’s decline. The organization now must rebuild trust, accountability, and consistency if it hopes to return to playoff contention.The Giants have named offensive coordinator Mike Kafka as interim head coach for the remainder of the season. As the organization evaluates its future, the spotlight also turns to general manager Joe Schoen, whose draft decisions have contributed to roster instability. Brian Daboll’s exit marks only the second in-season firing for the franchise since 1976, underscoring the severity of the situation. His rapid fall from NFL Coach of the Year to leading one of the league’s most struggling teams serves as a stark reminder of the high-pressure, results-driven world of professional football.","Brian Daboll's four-year run began with promise, including a 7-2 start in 2022 and a high-profile playoff victory.

“Sometimes a slap in the face…!”: Leon Draisaitl opens up on Edmonton Oilers' humiliating 9-1 loss

Avalanche score NINE GOALS against Oilers 🤯🏔️

The Edmonton Oilers faced a crushing defeat against the Colorado Avalanche, suffering a crushing 9-1 loss on Saturday night. The humiliating loss has critics calling for an upgrade in goal, as the loss showed a stark wake-up call for a team aiming for the Stanley Cup. Criticising the team’s gameplay, Oilers forward Leon Draisaitl has recently explained why “sometimes a slap in the face is just what you need.” The forward has discussed why the team's 9-1 loss to the Avalanche could be what the group needed.According to the current standings, after 16 games, Edmonton sits at 6-6-4, placing them seventh in the Pacific Division, which falls short of the expectations placed on a team widely considered a Stanley Cup contender. The match actually exposed every weakness, ranging from poor defense to lackluster goaltending and a faltering offense. Let’s take a look at what Oilers forward Leon Draisaitl has to say about the team’s performance and defeat.Leon Draisaitl has shared his perspective on the Edmonton Oilers after their recent 9–1 loss to the Colorado Avalanche. He believes that such a defeat, while painful, could serve as a harsh wake-up call for the team.The defeat was required as it could act as a reality check or motivation booster for the Oilers. Draisaitl opened up about the team's defeat in a recent interview, where he also emphasized the importance of focusing on consistency and teamwork over perfection.Speaking to the media, Leon Draisaitl stated, “Oh yeah, sometimes it's, you know, easier to get really whacked across the face instead of, you know, pity-patting around for another couple of weeks and, you know, win one, lose two and, you know, you never really find it. So, sometimes a slap on the face is just what you need, and you know, again, we got to respond.”Emphasizing about the team’s consistency, the Oilers player further added, “Why? You don't need every guy playing at their absolute best. This is not the time for that. But you need, you know, a B-plus game from everyone. And if you have a B-plus game from most guys, and some guys are playing great, then you start to look like a team, and you can build some momentum…. Not everyone plays their A game every single night, but we need more consistency in our B-plus game. ” (source: TSN)Draisaitl’s comments reflect leadership and a practical approach towards their game. For the loss, he’s not blaming anyone, but he’s clearly challenging his teammates to be more consistent. His advice seemed more grounded and accountable, serving as a reminder that unity and teamwork are essential to dodge difficult moments like this.","Edmonton Oilers lost 9-1 to the Colorado Avalanche on Saturday night.

Andy Bichel Interview | Why the former Australia cricketer compared Virat Kohli with Ricky Ponting

NEW DELHI: India head coach Gautam Gambhir has stirred debate with his recent remarks about not celebrating series losses, which many fans have interpreted as a subtle criticism of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli following India’s 2-1 ODI series defeat in Australia. The controversy arose despite the duo’s much-praised partnership that powered India to victory in the final match.India clinched a consolation win in the third ODI in Sydney, thanks to a commanding 168-run stand between Rohit and Kohli — a performance that drew widespread applause from fans and pundits alike. Rohit Sharma remained unbeaten on 121 off 125 balls, while Virat Kohli scored 74 not out off 81 deliveries, guiding India to a successful chase of 237 runs in 38.3 overs.Shortly after the celebrations, Gambhir shared his perspective in a video released by the BCCI on social media.“Look, I don't think so, honestly. I think I've always been a believer that it's not about the individual performances. Yes, I can be very happy with the individual performances, yes. And I will always remain happy with individual performances, but ultimately, we lost the ODI series. That's the bottom line. And I can never celebrate a series loss as a coach,” Gambhir stated.He further explained his viewpoint on the responsibility of representing India.“As a player, I can appreciate individuals, but as a coach, I think it is my moral responsibility that we as a nation and we as individuals should never, never celebrate a series loss. Ultimately, we are representing the country,” he added.Although Gambhir did not name any players, many fans online believe his remarks were aimed at Rohit and Kohli’s post-match celebration, sparking intense debate across social media.",Gautam Gambhir has stirred debate with his recent remarks about not celebrating series losses.

No off days as captain Shubman Gill, coach Gautam Gambhir arrive in Kolkata for Test series

NEW DELHI: India head coach Gautam Gambhir has opened up about the recent debate over his decision to bench key players Arshdeep Singh and Kuldeep Yadav during the T20I series against Australia. In a video interview with the BCCI, Gambhir discussed the challenges of balancing team combinations, managing expectations, and ensuring transparent communication — especially when in-form players are left out of the playing XI.The move to rest Arshdeep Singh, India’s leading T20I wicket-taker, for the first two matches to accommodate Harshit Rana drew widespread criticism. Arshdeep made a strong comeback later in the series, picking up three wickets in the third T20I and following it with 1/22 in the fourth match.Acknowledging the difficulty of such calls, Gambhir said that having to leave out deserving players is one of the toughest parts of his job.“That is the toughest part for me as a coach, and that is the toughest job I have. Sometimes, when I know there is so much quality sitting on the bench, and I know everyone deserves to be part of the playing XI, but ultimately, you can only pick 11, thinking about what is the best combination to do the job on that particular day,” Gambhir said.He further emphasised the importance of open dialogue and honesty within the team.“But for me, the most important thing is the conversation and the communication as well. The communication needs to be very clear, very honest. Sometimes, obviously, those are tough conversations to have. If you tell someone that he is not playing, it is probably the toughest conversation for both the coach and the player, because I know the player would be upset when he deserves to be part of the playing XI,” he added.Gambhir also highlighted the positive, transparent environment within the Indian dressing room, insisting that discussions between players and coaches must remain private.“But if you are honest, if you are straightforward, if you know that what you are saying comes from the heart and there is nothing beyond that, some players do understand. And it's a communication between a player and the coach, and I think it should stay there, rather than people making a lot of outcry and different theories about it. And that is something this group and the support staff have done brilliantly, because it has been a very transparent dressing room, an honest dressing room, and that is exactly how we want it to be,” Gambhir concluded.",Gautam Gambhir has opened up about the recent debate over his decision to bench key players Arshdeep Singh and Kuldeep Yadav during the T20I series against Australia.

Why Mohammed Shami has been ignored again by selectors

NEW DELHI: Former India captain Sourav Ganguly said on Monday that Mohammed Shami should return to the national team in all formats. Ganguly said Shami is fit and bowling well, but the selectors appear to be looking beyond the 35-year-old pacer, who has not been picked for the upcoming two-Test series against South Africa. Shami last played for India in the Champions Trophy in March.""Shami is bowling exceptionally well. He is fit and we saw in the three Ranji Trophy matches, where he's won Bengal on his own,"" Ganguly said on Monday.Shami took 15 wickets for Bengal in the first two Ranji Trophy matches this season. He bowled 91 overs in the three matches, going wicketless in the game against Tripura.Shami had undergone ankle surgery after the 2023 ODI World Cup, where he ended as the leading wicket-taker with 24 wickets at an average of 10.70.""I'm sure the selectors are watching and there is a communication between Mohammad Shami and the selectors. But if you ask me, in terms of fitness and skill, it’s the Mohammad Shami we know of. So, I really don't see any reason why he can’t keep playing Test matches, One-day cricket and T20 cricket for India. Because that skill is enormous,” Ganguly said, as quoted by news agency PTI.Prasidh Krishna and Akash Deep are now key members of the pace attack in Tests.With the 2027 ODI World Cup still two years away, Shami’s injury history could be a factor for the selectors.Shami, 35, has not been picked in India’s 15-member squad for the two home Tests against South Africa, starting Friday at Eden Gardens in Kolkata. Before this, Shami had expressed his disappointment over not being part of India’s recent Test matches.","Former India captain Sourav Ganguly says Mohammed Shami should return to the national team.

Shreyas Iyer’s condition critical after suffering life-threatening injury in Sydney | Inside details

NEW DELHI: Star Indian batter Shreyas Iyer has finally broken his silence after suffering a scary spleen injury during the third ODI against Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) on October 25. The Indian ODI vice-captain, who spent nearly a week in hospital — including a few days in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) — took to social media on Monday to share his first picture since the incident.In his Instagram post, Iyer offered a wave of relief to anxious fans, posting a cheerful picture from a beach alongside a friend. The caption read, “Sun been a great therapy. Grateful to be back. Thanks for all the love and care.”The post marks the first public update from the 30-year-old since his near-fatal fall while taking a running catch to dismiss Alex Carey during the Sydney ODI. Iyer landed awkwardly and was in visible pain before being rushed to the hospital. Later, it emerged that he had suffered a spleen laceration, an injury that caused internal bleeding and required an emergency medical procedure.According to medical reports, Iyer’s vitals had dropped dangerously low, prompting his ICU admission. Swift intervention by the Indian team’s medical staff and local doctors in Sydney proved crucial. He was discharged on November 1, though he stayed back in Sydney for follow-up treatment, accompanied by his sister Shreshta Iyer.A BCCI official had stated that talk of a cricketing comeback was “premature,” adding, “Physical and mental well-being is of utmost importance right now. There’s no question of thinking about cricket at the moment.”In its official statement, the BCCI had thanked Dr Koroush Haghighi in Sydney and Dr Dinshaw Pardiwala in India for their roles in Iyer’s treatment. The star batter’s recovery will determine his return timeline, though he is expected to miss the upcoming ODI series against South Africa starting November 30.For now, Shreyas’ heartfelt message — and his smile in the sun — have offered fans the best news yet: he’s healing, and grateful to be alive.",Indian ODI vice-captain Shreyas Iyer posts first picture since injury.

Vancouver Diaries: Home Holiday Decorating + Healthy Food

How Elias Pettersson and Katelyn Byrd got into the Christmas spirit early

The twinkling lights, the soft laugh, and the sweet chaos of early Christmas decorating — it was as if the holidays had come. For Katelyn Byrd, it was not just another cozy weekend; it was a long-awaited day with her husband, Elias Pettersson, who was finally back after a Canucks road trip. The couple’s warmth and playful teasing made the fans feel as if they were sitting in the living room with them, watching love and laughter fill the space.In Katelyn’s latest YouTube vlog, she recorded their day, which began with a drive to her nail appointment, a small moment that became emotional when she revealed that it had been very hard for her while Elias was away. He smiled, gently teasing her, but their connection was real. Afterwards, the mood lightened as the duo shifted their attention to a more pleasant subject: bringing Christmas to life, even though it was early November.Once back at home, the couple dived into decorating with candles, ornaments, and a sparkling tree that filled the room with festive charm. Elias joked that it might be “too soon,” but he still helped hang up decorations, thus earning himself the title of “Santa’s little elf.” The vlog felt like a combination of romance, humor, and domestic chaos — a peek into a life that was far removed from the NHL pressure and the bright lights of the arena. The laughter of the players and their collaboration gave a sense of realness to the situation that the fans love to experience from the normally introverted hockey player.Their day came to an end with a chill lunch date, Katelyn dubbing herself a ""happy girl"" and playfully twirling pasta and laughing over the table.The vlog showed the heart of hockey — two people finding happiness in the usual, not only in the holiday preparation. For the public, it was an infrequent glimpse into Pettersson’s life outside of the rink, which was undoubtedly full of warmth, balance, and a love that sparkled just as brightly as their Christmas lights.More coverage on NHL","Elias Pettersson and Katelyn Byrd's Christmas vlog brings cheer before Christmas.

“The prognosis is excellent for me and my family,”

“For Broncos fans, I fully expect to return to the field very soon.”

More coverage on NFL:



Sometimes, a twist of fate can save a life. Denver Broncos linebacker Alex Singleton learned that the hard and miraculous way when a routine NFL drug test turned into something far more serious. What began as a standard league procedure revealed a testicular tumor that doctors quickly removed the day after Denver’s win over the Raiders. Now, the 30-year-old linebacker says his prognosis is “excellent,” assuring fans he’s already focused on getting back to football soon.In a story that stunned both teammates and fans, Alex Singleton shared that a random NFL drug test two weeks ago flagged unusual results, leading to further medical testing. Those tests revealed a cancerous testicular tumor, a diagnosis that came completely out of the blue for the veteran linebacker.Singleton underwent successful surgery just one day after the Broncos’ Thursday Night Football victory over the Raiders. The procedure went smoothly, and doctors say his prognosis looks very positive, with no signs the cancer has spread. It’s a turn of events that Singleton himself calls “life-saving,” especially since the tumor was caught early.After recovering from surgery, Singleton took to social media to share the news directly with Broncos Nation.he said.His message struck a chord with fans across the league, who flooded his posts with encouragement and prayers. Broncos teammates, including Patrick Surtain II and Justin Simmons, reshared his announcement with messages of love and support. The team is reportedly rallying around Singleton during his recovery, with head coach Sean Payton describing him as “the definition of toughness.”Singleton’s experience is a powerful reminder of how early detection can make all the difference. Testicular cancer is one of the most treatable forms of cancer when caught early, and Singleton’s story proves how even an unexpected drug test can lead to a life-saving diagnosis.Other athletes, including NFL running back James Conner, have also beaten similar diagnoses and returned to professional play. Singleton’s transparency about his health journey has already sparked conversations about awareness, regular checkups, and removing the stigma around men’s health discussions.While no specific return date has been announced, all signs point to a swift recovery. Singleton’s resilience both physical and mental has long defined his career, from his CFL beginnings to becoming one of Denver’s most reliable defenders.For now, he’s focused on healing, resting, and inspiring others in the process. As he put it best, this isn’t a setback, it’s just another challenge to tackle.","Denver Broncos linebacker Alex Singleton was diagnosed with testicular cancer after a random drug test.

Is Nico Harrison’s tenure in Dallas Mavericks coming to an end?

Nico Harrison’s job in jeopardy as Dallas Mavericks ownership weighs in-season front office change

Despite requests from the fan base to dismiss general manager Nico Harrison , the Dallas Mavericks had apparently previously granted him a special privilege this season. Since he dealt Luka Doncic to the Los Angeles Lakers in February, Harrison has been unpopular in Dallas.Now that the storm clouds over Dallas are getting darker, Nico Harrison is the center of attention. Marc Stein claims that it is now ""unavoidable at the highest levels"" for the Mavericks to avoid thinking about making a front-office change in the middle of the season. Hired in 2021 to modernize the team and improve player relations, the once-promising executive is now in danger of losing his job before the All-Star break.Now that Harrison is becoming quiet unpopular, the Mavericks must take action. This is because as per the insiders, the idea that could result in Harrison's dismissal is ""based on the premise that the front office executive who conceived and pushed for the widely criticized Doncic deal can no longer be the one trying to pilot the organization past it.""Internal discussions on Harrison's future are being driven by three main factors, according to Stein's most recent report.They are the necessity for a change in attitude, the desire to win back upset supporters, and the growing perception that ""the GM who traded Luka Doncic, can no longer be the one who tries to move the Mavericks past it.""Insiders have also revealed certain reasons as to why Nico should have been fired long back. He recommended Luka Doncic be traded. Additionally, when he exchanged Quentin Grimes for Caleb Martin, they should have dismissed him.The moment they won the Cooper Flagg lottery, they also should have fired him. Furthermore, when Flagg was forced to switch to point guard due to the reported unbalanced roster he built, they ought to have dismissed him during the preseason.Any of those times would have been the ideal time to fire Nico Harrison. However, now, it appears that Dallas is finally taking it into account. Insider Marc Stein tweeted on Sunday:""The rising and virtually ceaseless negativity that surrounds the franchise is indeed wearing on and troubling ownership.""Although club governor Patrick Dumont would prefer to give Harrison more time, Stein points out that ""contemplating whether an in-season change is the wisest course for the Mavericks to try to forge ahead post-Doncic has become unavoidable at the highest levels of the organization.""However, having said that, the Mavs' management haven't said anything as of yet regarding Harrison's firing. They have neither accepted nor refuted the rumor.Also read: Has Nico Harrison been fired?

Aaron Rodgers shocked everyone with his quiet marriage announcement

Post

Fans are losing their minds over Rodgers’ secret marriage



“At this point, I think Aaron married ChatGPT.”

“It is pretty funny for a 41-year-old man to do the “my girlfriend goes to another school” bit.”

“Some things are just better left private.”

Aaron Rodgers has always marched to the beat of his own drum, but his latest move has fans and teammates scratching their heads. It’s been five months since the quarterback casually dropped that he’s a married man yet no one, not even his family or fellow NFL wives, has met his so-called wife.Dubbed the “phantom wife” by curious fans online, Rodgers’ mystery partner has become the NFL’s biggest off-field riddle, sparking endless theories, jokes, and a side of mild disbelief across social media.In June 2025, Rodgers stunned fans when he confirmed during a local Wisconsin interview that he’d tied the knot “a couple of months ago.” That low-key reveal came after fans noticed a sleek black wedding band on his finger at the Kentucky Derby earlier that spring.He didn’t drop a name or post a single photo, just a grin and a simple statement confirming he was off the market. Since then, curiosity about who Mrs. Rodgers really is has turned into a full-blown internet mystery.Reports suggest Rodgers may have married someone named Brittani (with an “i”), a woman he briefly referenced during a December 2024 podcast. But months later, there’s been zero sign of her online, no photos, public appearances, or interactions with team insiders.According to reports, not even Rodgers’ family or teammates’ spouses have seen or spoken to his supposed wife. One Steelers WAG reportedly called her “a phantom,” adding that Rodgers keeps his private life “on total lockdown.”Family sources told thethey remain “completely in the dark,” with some unsure if the marriage is even legally documented. Despite that, Rodgers insists his wife simply prefers to stay out of the spotlight, describing her as “private, grounded, and not interested in fame.”It’s a total 180 for Rodgers, who’s previously dated big names like Shailene Woodley , Olivia Munn, and Danica Patrick, all of whom were very public relationships.Social media has gone full detective mode. On Reddit, one user joked,Another fan on X wrote,Despite the wild speculation, Rodgers seems totally unbothered. Insiders say he’s focused on football and prefers to keep his personal world sealed off from the noise. During a recent interview, he shrugged off the chatter, saying,So while fans might not get a wedding album anytime soon, Rodgers seems perfectly content letting the mystery linger. In an age when everyone overshares, the four-time MVP might just be playing the ultimate long game keeping everyone guessing while living quietly behind the curtain.More coverage on NFL:","Aaron Rodgers shocked everyone with his quiet marriage announcement in June 2025.

Cade Cunningham’s family and daughter Riley



Detroit Pistons guard Cade Cunningham has continued to evolve as one of the NBA’s most promising young stars. While his career on the court is widely followed, fans remain just as curious about his life off it. The 24-year-old point guard has always maintained a low profile when it comes to his relationships, leading many to wonder, who is Cade Cunningham dating in 2025?The Oklahoma State standout, who became the No. 1 overall pick in the 2021 NBA Draft, has balanced professional success with the responsibilities of fatherhood. Beyond his leadership on the floor, Cunningham’s personal life reveals a more private, grounded side that rarely makes headlines. Yet, interest in his rumored relationship with Nikia Withers continues to grow among fans and followers.Cade Cunningham is reportedly dating Nikia Withers, a California native with a background in both athletics and business. The two were first linked in 2021, and although they’ve kept their relationship out of the spotlight, speculation about their connection hasn’t faded. Withers, born on June 29, 1996, is five years older than Cunningham and has built a career that extends beyond her athletic past.Before gaining public attention for her relationship with the Pistons star, Withers played volleyball at the University of Southern California, where she also majored in law. She later coached high school volleyball and even joined the professional ranks through Athletes Unlimited in 2022. Currently, she works as a Human Resources Specialist at Supreme Concepts and maintains a strong social media presence, where she shares glimpses of her professional life.She’s also known as the half-sister of NFL veteran Marcedes Lewis and was previously linked to NBA players Klay Thompson and D’Angelo Russell. Despite her public background, Withers and Cunningham have both remained discreet, never officially confirming their relationship.Away from basketball, Cunningham’s proudest title is being a father. He has a daughter named Riley, born in 2018 from a previous relationship. Riley lives primarily in Texas with her mother but remains a central part of Cunningham’s life. In a 2021 interview, he opened up about fatherhood, saying how important it was for him to be closer to his daughter after spending time away during his early playing years.“I mean regardless, I know my parents would’ve did whatever it took to close that gap for me but yeah, being a four-hour drive away isn’t too bad for sure,” Cunningham said at the time. “It definitely isn’t too bad and I’ve been super lucky to be able to have her be at a bunch of games and things like that.”Cunningham approaches his personal life quietly, maturely, and with intention. Although he is not keen on revealing too many details of his family, his love and focus for them remain at the center of Cade Cunningham’s world.Also Read: “You’ll be missed” – LeBron James mourns NBA legend who leaves behind a storied basketball legacy","Detroit Pistons point guard Cade Cunningham is reportedly dating Nikia Withers.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan batter Azam Khan , son of former cricketer Moin Khan , has opened up about the lowest phase of his international career, recalling the struggles he faced during his stint with the national team — especially a forgettable match against England in 2024.Despite featuring in 14 T20Is between 2021 and 2024, Azam failed to register a single half-century and often drew criticism for his fitness and fielding, leading to his exclusion after Pakistan’s disappointing 2024 T20 World Cup campaign.Azam’s time with the national side was marked by inconsistent performances and questions over his wicketkeeping.His last appearance came during the 2024 T20 World Cup, where Pakistan crashed out before the semi-finals.In a recent video interview, Azam revisited one of his toughest experiences — facing England’s express pacer Mark Wood ""Mark Wood ne mujhe pehla bouncer mara. I left it. I was like, ha theek hai. Matlab sahi hai. Humare yahan bhi 150 wale bowler hain (Mark Wood bowled the first bouncer. I left it. I thought, okay, we have 150 kph bowlers in Pakistan too),"" Azam Khan was heard saying in a video.""When he bowled the second bouncer, I was like, woah, yeh matlab kya ho gaya mere saath? Like meri zindagi ekdum ruk gayi, bhai yeh mere saath kya ho gaya!!!?? (When he bowled the second bouncer, I thought, what just happened to me? My life paused for a moment, and I was stunned).""He also recalled a painful moment at The Oval, where he faced brutal criticism from the crowd.""When my finger started hurting, I knew I was out. Oval ka crowd gaaliyan de rha tha (The Oval crowd started abusing me). There was a Pakistani reporter who asked a drunk Englishman about his favourite Pakistan player. He replied, 'Azam Khan, he can't bat, can't field.' That broke me. Kya yeh izzat hai meri? (Is this my reputation?) I dropped easy catches too. I was in tears. I kept thinking, yeh mere saath kya ho raha hai? (Why is this happening to me?)""Watch the video here The match Azam referred to ended in a heavy defeat for Pakistan — bowled out for 157 in 19.5 overs, with Azam dismissed for zero as England chased down the target in 15.3 overs with seven wickets to spare.","Pakistan batter Azam Khan has opened up about the lowest phase of his international career.

Poll Do you agree with Gautam Gambhir's philosophy of prioritizing impact over statistics in T20 cricket? Strongly Agree Agree Disagree

NEW DELHI: India head coach Gautam Gambhir has shed light on the fearless and flexible philosophy driving the national team's T20 resurgence, stressing that his focus lies on impact rather than numbers like averages and strike rates.Speaking in a BCCI video interview after India's 2-1 T20I series win against Australia, Gambhir underlined that his ideology hasn't changed since taking over as head coach following the 2024 T20 World Cup. He said that while the openers have defined roles, the rest of the batting order will always remain fluid.“That has been the ideology from day one when I took over as the head coach, from Sri Lanka till now. It has not changed. Batting orders are very overrated, except the openers, obviously. The two openers are permanent, the rest shuffles, because it's not the amount of runs that matter in T20 cricket — it's the impact that matters,” said Gambhir.Under his leadership, India have introduced a dynamic approach built on adaptability and aggression, with players like Tilak Varma, Sanju Samson, and Axar Patel freely switching positions in the order.Gambhir insisted this flexibility is by design, not experimentation.“That's the reason from day one, it has been a fluid batting order, and that is how we want to play the game. We don't want to play thinking about averages, strike rates, and all that stuff. It's about how much impact a person can create in what situation,” he added.The former opener also said that his coaching philosophy is rooted in staying ahead of evolving T20 trends.“With time, T20 cricket will evolve. We as coaches must evolve too. We want to be ahead of T20 cricket, ahead of time. The most important thing is that these young boys have adapted and hopefully continue evolving in future,” he said.Gambhir concluded by noting that while individual brilliance is appreciated, he would never celebrate a series loss.“As a nation and as individuals, we should never celebrate a series loss,” he said.India next face South Africa at home in a full tour beginning November 14.",Gautam Gambhir says India's batting order will always remain fluid.

Will Matthew Golden play tonight? (Nov. 10)



Eagles vs. Packers Monday Night Football: How to watch, start time, TV, and stream details

Date: Monday, Nov. 10

Time: 8:15 p.m. ET

Venue: Lambeau Field

Location: Green Bay, Wis.

Records: Eagles 6-2; Packers 5-2-1

Why Matthew Golden’s absence matters: Eagles defensive shakeups and Packers offensive pressure

Matthew Golden has become one of the Green Bay Packers’ most interesting young pieces. His early-season flashes made his workload worth watching, but the timing of his first real injury could not be worse. The Packers are fighting to stay afloat in a tight NFC race, and tonight’s matchup against the Philadelphia Eagles may determine how far they can push in November.Green Bay enters Monday Night Football thin at pass catcher. Jayden Reed is on injured reserve, Tucker Kraft is out for the season, and two more receivers are banged up. Fans want clarity. Jordan Love wants stability. Golden’s health sits at the center of both questions.So where do things stand?Matthew Golden is listed as questionable tonight against the Eagles. The wide receiver entered Week 10 as questionable with a shoulder injury, but his practice trend made his status doubtful from the start. Golden logged a limited session on Thursday before missing practice entirely on Friday and Saturday. That is the exact pattern that typically results in a player being ruled out.Reporters around the Packers believe Golden was “fighting to play,” but multiple outlets, including the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, have noted that he did not suffer a setback.This indicates the team is prioritizing long-term availability over short-term risk.Golden has been efficient when healthy, recording 23 receptions for 262 yards this year. He has also added value as a runner with eight carries for 45 yards. His absence removes another layer of versatility from Green Bay’s offense, which is already stretched thin.The Packers will rely heavily on Christian Watson and Romeo Doubs. Doubs, who has seen 41 targets over his last five games, projects as Jordan Love’s volume receiver again. Savion Williams and Dontayvion Wicks were limited in Saturday’s practice and are more likely to be active than Golden, though neither is fully healthy.Golden’s absence also matters for Green Bay’s late-season evaluation. As a first-round pick expected to grow into a major contributor, missing primetime reps slows his development curve. If the Packers cannot stretch the field against Philadelphia, tonight’s game may show exactly how much they lose without Golden’s speed and yards-after-catch ability.Here are the full Week 10 broadcast details for tonight’s matchup at Lambeau Field:The Eagles come off a Week 9 bye, while the Packers are trying to recover from a 16-13 loss to the Carolina Panthers. The Arizona Republic projects a 27-24 Philadelphia win, but national predictions remain split.This game carries more depth than a single injury update. Both teams enter Lambeau with significant defensive and personnel storylines. For Philadelphia, cornerback Jaire Alexander has already been ruled out. ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported that Alexander remains “acclimating to the defensive system” and recovering from a knee injury, so the Eagles kept him home to focus on his preparation.The Eagles have already tried multiple fixes at cornerback this year. Adoree’ Jackson and Kelee Ringo struggled early, leading to trades for Jakorian Bennett and Alexander. Bennett is expected to suit up tonight after missing time with a pec injury, and Eagles analysts have pushed for him to get extended snaps.Green Bay faces challenges of its own. With Golden out and Kraft sidelined for the season, the Packers are relying on narrow depth at receiver and tight end. Doubs has emerged as the primary target, while Watson remains the explosive but inconsistent threat.Golden’s situation also intersects with betting conversations. Analysts are wary of expecting production from a rookie who played only 36.9% of snaps last season and has not exceeded six targets in any 2025 game. Without him tonight, the Packers offense becomes easier to predict but harder to diversify.Defensively, Philadelphia enters the matchup improving their pass rush. After losing Josh Sweat in free agency, the team leaned on Josh Uche, who has produced 20 pressures and holds the No. 11 PFF grade among 110 edge rushers. The Eagles then traded for Jaelan Phillips and brought Brandon Graham out of retirement to stabilize their front.For Green Bay, that means more pressure on Love without one of his key security valves. If Wicks or Williams struggles, the offense could become one-dimensional.","Green Bay Packers wide receiver Matthew Golden is listed as questionable with a shoulder injury.

Video shows President Donald Trump personally giving Presidential Challenge Coin to young NFL fan at Sunday's Commanders vs. Lions game

What is a Presidential Challenge Coin?

More coverage on the NFL:

Margo Martin, Special Assistant to the President and Communications Advisor, shared a touching video capturing a young Jayden Daniels fan’s unforgettable moment with President Donald Trump . As Trump exited Northwest Stadium in Landover, Maryland, a crowd of supporters gathered around him. Spotting a boy in a Jayden Daniels jersey, number 5 gleaming on his back, Trump called him over and presented him with a Presidential Challenge Coin. The boy, dressed in grey cargo pants and a Commanders cap, approached the President with wide eyes and awe. He shook Trump’s hand and said, “Thank you, Mr. President. I’m honored.” It was a memory sure to last a lifetime. When FOX News’ Nick Sortor posted the video on X, one fan quickly remarked, “Say what you want, but Trump knows how to connect with people in a way that feels genuine.”As the young fan received a challenge coin from the US President, the crowd’s reactions poured in, each more heartfelt than the last. One fan delighted in the boy’s playful display, noting how he flexed his muscles with pride on his way back. Another marveled at the boy’s courage, praising his confident handshake and eye contact with President Trump, and commending his parents for raising such a respectful young man.Others reflected on the significance of the moment, suggesting that while the coin itself might fade from memory, the feeling of being truly seen would last a lifetime. Fans agreed that gestures like these can leave a powerful, lasting impression on young people, regardless of politics, and that this boy would carry the memory with him forever.Watching the heartwarming moment when a young fan received a challenge coin from the US President, fans quickly shared their reactions. One noticed how the boy flexed his muscles after getting the coin, saying, “That boy flexed on his way back good boy there.” Another admired the boy’s courage, saying, “WOW! What an amazing young man. He stuck his hand out, made eye contact while he spoke to President Trump, and shook his hand. Well done, Mom and Dad.” A third fan added, “Kudos to the parents for raising a respectful young man!”A fourth reflected on the memory, “Every man has a moment in life when he is no longer just a child. A moment of recognition. A moment when someone respected by millions looks directly at him This boy will not remember the coin. He will remember that he was seen.” A fifth praised the kid, saying, “Seems like a very respectful kid. I would’ve been star struck and stood there like a child and asked a series of questions with intertwined compliments until the secret service shoved me away. ” Another said this gesture would stay with the boy forever, “Such gestures can definitely leave a lasting impression, especially on young people. To experience such a meaningful moment firsthand is something they’ll remember. Regardless of political views, personal gestures like this often have a powerful impact.”A US Presidential Challenge Coin is a small medallion presented by the President as a personal sign of appreciation, recognition, and honor for an individual’s service or achievements. The tradition has its roots in military history and was officially adopted by the White House during the Bill Clinton administration. President Donald Trump gave a Presidential Challenge Coin to a young fan on Sunday at the Washington Commanders game against the Detroit Lions.
