KOLKATA: Richa Ghosh is ready to wear a new cap. The World Cup-winning cricketer was appointed Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) in the state police by the Bengal government on Saturday. Later in the evening, a glittering one-hour felicitation ceremony was organised for Richa by the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) at the iconic Eden Gardens here.The 22-year-old cricketer went to the police headquarters in Kolkata in the afternoon to meet higher officials of state police where her appointment was finalised.She thus joined her World Cup-winning teammate Deepti Sharma (UP Police) along with other cricketers Mohammed Siraj (Telangana Police) and Joginder Sharma (Haryana Police) in the same post.At the Eden Gardens, Richa was presented with a golden bat and ball, while chief minister Mamata Banerjee personally handed over the Banga Bhushan medal, the DSP appointment letter and a gold chain. The CAB also handed her a cheque of Rs 34 lakh - Rs 1 lakh each for every run she scored in the World Cup final.Sharing the dais with former India captains Sourav Ganguly and Jhulan Goswami, Richa stood tall as the first from the state to bring home a World Cup.CAB president Ganguly emphasised on the batter's strike rate.

Richa's strike made the difference for India's campaign in this World Cup,"" he said.Legendary Jhulan recalled the days when she first saw Richa. ""It was 2013 when Bengal cricket was not doing well. So I requested CAB officials to start a talent hunt programme. As they gracefully agreed, I had the opportunity to move to the districts and that was how I first saw Richa,"" Goswami, who later fought to get young Richa into the senior state side, stated.",Richa Ghosh appointed Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) in the state police.

India women's cricketers get a grand welcome in their respective hometowns

Bengal's first World Cup-winning cricketer Richa Ghosh received multiple honors at Eden Gardens on Saturday. The ceremony brought together cricket legends Sourav Ganguly, Jhulan Goswami , and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.The 22-year-old wicketkeeper-batter from Siliguri received the Banga Bhushan award and was appointed Deputy Superintendent of Police. The West Bengal government also presented her with a gold chain.The Cricket Association of Bengal awarded her Rs 34 lakh, calculated at Rs 1 lakh for each run she scored in the final match.""The World Cup triumph is a special, special win and only Richa can tell us what that feels like. Your career has just begun. Women's cricket will grow massively in the next four to six years, and there will be more opportunities,"" Ganguly said.""I hope you make the most of them and one day, like Jhulan, we'll stand here and say: 'Richa -- India captain'. You're just 22... You've got time. All blessings and heartiest congratulations.""Richa's contribution to India's victory was significant. Batting at number 7, she scored 34 runs off 24 balls, including three fours and two sixes in the final against South Africa.India posted 298 for 7, while South Africa managed only 246 runs.""The role she plays batting lower down the order is very difficult. You get fewer balls but you have to score the most runs. People may remember Jemimah's 127 not out or Harmanpreet's 89 in the semifinals, but Richa's strike rate of 130-plus made the difference. What she's done so simply is equal in value to Smriti or Harman.""Jhulan Goswami, India's highest ODI wicket-taker, discovered Richa during Bengal's 2013 district trials in Siliguri.""In 2013, we were struggling so I suggested for trials in districts. During the under-15 trials in Siliguri, I spotted Richa. I requested the officials to support her. She was so talented at that age, I'd never seen that before. I wanted her to be in the senior team, and the rest is history. Finally, tor haath diye amader World Cup ta aslo — onek onek dhonnobad.""Richa expressed her gratitude and amazement at the reception she received.""It feels like a dream -- the way I was received in Siliguri and now here. It's like living a dream.""She shared insights about her training methods.""When I bat at open nets, I set a target — how many runs I can score in a specific time. That helps me in big matches. They always praise my sixes, so I try for more big hits. It's about choosing the right ball.""Richa discussed her approach to handling pressure.""I like to take pressure, but I keep myself calm by watching movies and staying away from home.

Factors Affecting a Possible Reunion

Accepting the New Reality

Trade rumors have linked NBA’s one of the most iconic sharpshooters with the Golden State Warriors. As Klay Thompson’s struggles continue with the Dallas Mavericks, a familiar storyline has resurfaced - could the four-time NBA champion find his way back to where it all began? A recent piece by Blue Man Hoop’s Peter O’Keefe floated the intriguing idea of a potential reunion between Thompson and the Golden State Warriors, the team with which he built his Hall of Fame legacy.At 35 years old, Thompson’s performance has taken a noticeable dip, raising questions about his future with the Luka Doncic-led Mavericks. O’Keefe suggested that the veteran guard might benefit from a change of scenery - perhaps even a return to the franchise that defined his prime years. The idea isn’t just rooted in sentimentality; it reflects the growing uncertainty surrounding Thompson’s fit in Dallas and whether a reunion with the Warriors could help rejuvenate the final stretch of his career.At 35, Thompson’s productivity has noticeably dipped in his first season with the Luka Doncic-led Mavericks. O’Keefe’s column questioned whether Dallas could continue justifying his current role, especially with Kyrie Irving sidelined due to injury.“There’s no doubt that another team could certainly utilize (Klay) Thompson far more productively than what the Mavericks currently are,” O’Keefe wrote last Monday. (H/t: Sporting News)He added that the Mavericks might soon face a difficult decision: wait for Irving’s return or explore trade options involving Thompson.The idea of a return to Golden State - where Thompson rose to stardom - was one of the potential scenarios O’Keefe mentioned.The numbers tell a clear story of decline for the veteran sharpshooter. Thompson is on pace for the worst statistical season of his career, averaging just 8.7 points per game while shooting 33.3% from the field and 29.4% from beyond the arc.For a player once renowned for his effortless shooting and off-ball movement, these numbers represent a dramatic downturn.No matter how his current stint in Dallas unfolds, Thompson’s legacy with the Golden State Warriors remains untouchable. Alongside Stephen Curry and Draymond Green, he helped the franchise rise from playoff hopefuls to dynasty builders.Their partnership led to four NBA championships and helped the Warriors break through in the highly competitive Western Conference after an early playoff exit in 2014.However, after the 2023–24 season, it became clear that Golden State had to pivot away from their long-time star. The team’s decision to move on was seen as both practical and painful - a recognition that Thompson was no longer the same elite two-way player who defined their championship era.While O’Keefe entertained the idea of a reunion, he noted that financial realities could complicate the move. “Perhaps a reunion between Thompson and the Warriors could be on the cards at some stage, but on his current deal, it seems unlikely that the franchise would trade for one of their greatest ever players,” he wrote.• Contract Value: Thompson’s current deal is substantial, limiting trade flexibility.• Age and Decline: At 35, teams may hesitate to take on his salary given his declining efficiency.• Roster Fit: Golden State’s focus has shifted toward developing younger talent.While Warriors fans may still dream of a nostalgic reunion, the current version of Thompson is far removed from his prime. His body has endured years of wear, and his shot no longer carries the same lethal consistency.The question remains: would returning to Golden State rekindle that spark, or has time simply caught up with one of the greatest shooters in NBA history?Also read: NBA trade rumors: Dallas Mavericks predicted to acquire $130 million Miami Heat superstar to improve standing in Western Conference For now, the consensus seems to lean toward acceptance. Klay Thompson will always be remembered as a cornerstone of the Warriors dynasty - regardless of how the remaining chapters of his career unfold.","At 35, Klay Thompson’s productivity has noticeably dipped in his first season with the Luka Doncic-led Mavericks.

Klay Thompson apologizes to Megan Thee Stallion after airport mishap



Megan Thee Stallion on her relationship with Klay Thompson



Klay Thompson might be known for his calm demeanor on the court, but off it, the Dallas Mavericks star recently showed his softer side. After arriving late to pick up his girlfriend, rapper Megan Thee Stallion , from the airport, Thompson went viral for his heartfelt apology and his remorse. The clip, shared by Megan on social media, captured the NBA star trying to make amends with flowers in hand and genuine regret on his face.The moment quickly became a talking point among fans, who couldn’t get enough of the couple’s chemistry and Thompson’s down-to-earth approach. It also comes at a time when both are thriving in their respective careers, with Thompson beginning his new season in Dallas and Megan releasing new music inspired by their relationship.In the video posted online, Klay Thompson can be seen handing Megan a bouquet while apologizing repeatedly for showing up late. “Roses for my boo,” he said while driving her home. “I’m sorry I was late, babe. Damn it. I’m sorry. I thought I timed it well. Ah, just sorry. There’s no excuse.”Fans immediately flooded social media with amused and affectionate reactions, praising Thompson’s gesture as “adorably human.” The incident added another viral moment to their growing list of public appearances since confirming their romance earlier this year.Over the summer, the couple enjoyed a fishing trip that gave fans a glimpse into their playful dynamic. “So today, Klay is taking me on another adventure and we’re going fishing,” Megan said at the time. Thompson responded lovingly: “I got my queen on board, of course I feel cool. I’m the coolest guy in this harbor!”For Megan, whose real name is Megan Jovon Ruth Pete, the relationship marks a new chapter. “This is my first relationship where I’ve ever been with somebody who’s genuinely a nice person, and he makes me genuinely happy,” she told Page Six.“I just never dated somebody like him before and I’m just grateful that he’s here by my side and he feels the same way about me.”Despite occasional public skepticism — even from personalities like Shaquille O’Neal, who jokingly doubted their relationship on The Big Podcast — fans have embraced the pair’s authenticity. O’Neal later called Megan “athletic, so beautiful, and so gorgeous,” insisting his remarks were lighthearted.For now, Thompson and Megan seem unfazed by outside opinions. Their recent viral moment only serves to extend a genuine connection between two stars from different worlds.Also Read: NBA’s highly anticipated Europe-based league’s potential release date revealed","Klay Thompson arrived late to pick up his girlfriend, rapper Megan Thee Stallion, from the airport.

Micah Parsons makes emotional pledge to the family of Marshawn Kneeland after the confirmed details of Kneeland’s death

Dallas Cowboys defensive end Marshawn Kneeland died Wednesday night at 24. The Marshawn Kneeland mental health conversation has taken over the NFL after police confirmed he died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound hours after a pursuit on the Dallas North Tollway. Two days earlier, Marshawn Kneeland scored his first NFL touchdown. The timeline has left fans, teammates, and coaches stunned.The details are confirmed by police, dispatch audio, and team statements. Nothing about this is speculation. Everything about this is difficult. And the Marshawn Kneeland mental health story now sits at the center of a larger conversation the NFL has spent years trying to address.DPS troopers tried to stop a vehicle around 10:30 p.m. on the Dallas North Tollway near Keller Springs. Video from NTTA showed the trooper chasing a speeding car. Investigators said the trooper lost visual contact. Minutes later, the same car, registered to Marshawn Kneeland, was found crashed off the Dallas Parkway near The Star.Initial reports said Marshawn Kneeland left the scene on foot. Officers began searching after receiving information that he had expressed suicidal thoughts. Plano police went to the apartment listed to the vehicle around 11 p.m.,found no one inside, returned at 11:40 p.m. after another welfare call, and again made no contact.Frisco police found Marshawn Kneeland at 1:30 a.m. with what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The Tarrant County Medical Examiner confirmed the cause as suicide, according to Nick Harris of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.TMZ published police dispatch audio that directly referenced the Marshawn Kneeland mental health crisis. Operators relayed information from Marshawn Kneeland’s girlfriend and the NFL. She told police he was armed, had a history of mental struggles, and told officers he said he would “end it all.” Dispatchers said the NFL told Plano PD that Marshawn Kneeland had been texting his family goodbye.A cousin of Dallas Cowboys defensive end Marshawn Kneeland has publicly questioned the circumstances surrounding his death. The Marshawn Kneeland mental health conversation intensified after his family said the events of Wednesday night did not match the person they knew.His first cousin, Jasmin Kneeland, told the Daily Mail she does not believe he died by suicide and said she is struggling to accept the official account. “I truly think they killed him, I truly do,” she said. She questioned why he would run and then die by suicide in a portable toilet. “Marshawn is not a violent person. He is not a hot head. Something here is just not right. Something made him really scared and he ran.”How former coaches, teammates, fans, and the league responded to Marshawn Kneeland and why the Marshawn Kneeland mental health conversation has become unavoidableThe Dallas Cowboys released a statement:“It is with extreme sadness that the Dallas Cowboys share that Marshawn Kneeland tragically passed away this morning. Marshawn was a beloved teammate and member of our organization. Our thoughts and prayers regarding Marshawn are with his girlfriend Catalina and his family.”Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni opened his press conference by saying, “The NFL is a brotherhood, you know, and so obviously that was on our mind this morning. And our thoughts and prayers go out to, you know, his family and the and the Dallas Cowboys.”FOX 4 spoke with former Cowboys defensive coordinator Mike Zimmer and former assistant defensive line coach Greg Ellis. Mike Zimmer said he could have named countless players he worried about before he ever imagined Marshawn Kneeland would be in crisis. Greg Ellis called Marshawn Kneeland a second son. He was watching on Monday as Marshawn Kneeland scored his touchdown off a blocked punt.Greg Ellis said walking back into the locker room next week, seeing Marshawn Kneeland’s locker, and feeling that missing presence will hit the team again. Both coaches pointed out how difficult the timing is because the Dallas Cowboys are spread out during the bye week.Tampa Bay Buccaneers wide receiver Sterling Shepard said, “It hurts your heart… this is the real-life stuff people go through.”San Francisco 49ers defensive lineman Solomon Thomas, who lost his sister to suicide, wrote, “I wish you knew it was going to be OK… I wish you knew how bad we wanted you to stay.”Fans gathered at The Star, leaving candles, flowers, and handwritten signs. Some had met him after Monday Night Football and said the loss felt personal.Marshawn Kneeland’s agent, Jonathan Perzley of Sportstars, posted his own statement:“I am shattered to confirm that my client and dearest friend Marshawn Kneeland passed away last night.”He added, “I watched him fight his way from a hopeful kid at Western Michigan with a dream to being a respected professional for the Dallas Cowboys. Marshawn poured his heart into every snap, every practice, and every moment on the field.”The Marshawn Kneeland mental health conversation is not new inside the league. The NFL and NFLPA mandated in 2019 that every team must have a licensed behavioral health clinician. The Indianapolis Colts launched “Kicking The Stigma” in 2020. Former Philadelphia Eagles star Brian Dawkins spoke publicly about his own depression and suicidal thoughts during his Hall of Fame induction.Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott lost his brother Jace to suicide in 2020. Defensive tackle Solomon Thomas lost his sister Ella in 2018. Marshawn Kneeland’s death has reopened those wounds. The NFL has more resources than ever, but this tragedy shows gaps that still exist.No one is guessing. The facts are confirmed. The reaction is real. The grief is everywhere. And the Marshawn Kneeland mental health conversation will not go away, because it cannot go away.Green Bay Packers linebacker Micah Parsons spoke for the first time on Friday about the death of Dallas Cowboys defensive lineman Marshawn Kneeland. The Marshawn Kneeland mental health conversation continues to ripple across the league, and Parsons made it clear that his former teammate’s family will not face this alone.Parsons and Marshawn Kneeland played together last season in Dallas. He described Kneeland as someone who brought respect and ease into the locker room.“Marshawn’s a guy who loved his anime, loved his video games, like anybody else,” Parsons said. “To me, he always showed me nothing but respect from the moment he came into the locker room.”Parsons said the loss has hit him harder than he expected.“He respected me as a player. He respected me as a person, so I have nothing but high respect for him. If there’s anything his family needs, I’ll be the first person to help or offer anything I can. I just hope that he finds his peace and his family finds his peace in the situation.”As Parsons prepares for Monday Night Football against the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 10, he said he is still processing the news.“I would say I was extremely shocked. I was extremely hurt by the news. Anyone I know, I don’t want to see anyone go this soon at this age. I don’t want anyone to go, but that’s kind of the reality.”Parsons ended by reflecting on how moments like this force players to confront their own fears, especially as parents.“I think the first key is accepting. I kind of accept it, but now I just gotta pray he finds his peace and what he was looking for. How he felt in that moment, you just really don’t know. For me, I have kids. How do I make sure my kids don’t end up in that similar situation?”","Dallas Cowboys defensive end Marshawn Kneeland died Wednesday night at 24.

She detailed her journey of shifting from supporting her partner's career to rediscovering her own dreams and defining personal success. Bündchen emphasizes her graciousness towards Brady, highlighting her focus on authenticity and fulfillment in her new chapter.

The shifting balance between support, career and self-fulfillment

Moving from high-stakes partnership to reinventing life on her own terms





In her March 2023 interview with Vanity Fair, supermodel Gisele Bündchen opened up about her 13-year marriage to former NFL quarterback Tom Brady, how their lives evolved, and what she discovered in the space that followed. While details of their split had played out in headlines, Bündchen offered fresh context and a more nuanced perspective.Gisele Bündchen admitted that “It’s like a death and a rebirth,” and described her own shift from supporting a partner’s career to rediscovering her personal dreams. Her reflections reveal not just a high-profile breakup, but a woman reclaiming her voice and defining success on her own terms.When Gisele Bündchen met Tom Brady at age 26, she said she was “so ready” for family and partnership. Traditionally one of the world’s highest-earning models, she gradually scaled back her runway work after 2015 to support the family life they were building.Gisele Bündchen describes relocating to Tampa without ever having lived there before: “When we moved to Tampa, I actually had never been there before. I just arrived and that was my life.” Yet despite her enormous success, much of the public narrative painted her as “against football” or overshadowed by Brady’s career, a portrayal she calls “very hurtful” and “the craziest thing I’ve ever heard.”She underscores that marriage didn’t unravel overnight. “That takes years to happen.” As she puts it: “Sometimes you grow together; sometimes you grow apart … When you love someone, you don’t put them in a jail and say, ‘You have to live this life.’ You set them free to be who they are.”Gisele Bündchen's message: supporting someone doesn’t mean losing yourself, and that truth became clearer to her as her kids grew and her dreams quietly changed.Today, Gisele Bündchen speaks of her next act in Costa Rica, building a home, raising her children, and exploring wellness and nature far from red carpets. She asserts, “I have my own dreams.”While Tom Brady continued his historic career, Bündchen’s focus shifted inward. She embraced spiritual practices, daily rituals, and the idea that success is not just professional acclaim but authenticity and fulfillment. She says the breakup felt like both a loss and a liberation, “I believed in fairy tales when I was a kid. I think it’s beautiful to believe in that.”Bündchen's reflection on Brady is remarkably gracious. “Listen, I have always cheered for him, and I would continue forever … If there’s one person I want to be the happiest in the world, it’s him.”In doing so, Bündchen rejects reductive headlines and stereotypes, choosing instead to present a fuller picture of love, change and self-discovery. As she said, “What’s been said is one piece of a much bigger puzzle. It’s not so black and white.”In the end, this isn’t a story solely of one of fashion’s biggest icons stepping aside. It’s the story of a woman stepping forward, redefining what a chapter ends and a new one begins.Also Read: Gisele Bündchen’s post divorce evolution raises question: did Tom Brady underestimate what letting her go would cost him?",Supermodel Gisele Bündchen opened up about her 13-year marriage to former NFL quarterback Tom Brady.

Brittany Mahomes’ new advisory board appointment adds a cultural shift moment to a growing NWSL era





More coverage on NFL:

The Kansas City Chiefs are in the middle of a painful reset week and not just because Patrick Mahomes is coming off a rare touchdown-less performance. Kansas City’s QB1 is regrouping, refocusing, and trying to recalibrate an offense that suddenly looks uneven.But while conversations around the Chiefs have been dominated by red-zone issues, missed opportunities, and Mahomes admitting “I got to be better,” there’s another Mahomes headline hitting at the exact same time, one that has nothing to do with football mechanics. Brittany Mahomes isn’t just the loudest supporter inside the CPKC suites anymore. She’s officially stepping into the boardroom of women’s sports and Patrick had no words. Just a silent repost.The Kansas City Current’s rise has already been one of the most impressive business stories in American women’s sports. Now, Brittany Mahomes is moving from co-owner to shaper of direction. The NWSL confirmed she has joined a star-loaded advisory board of “athletes, investors, and cultural icons who will focus on marketing, branding, fan engagement, and player initiatives starting in 2026.”Jessica Berman said the group “will serve as mentors and cultural connectors while helping expand the league’s reach through partnerships and appearances. ”Names like Magic Johnson, Sue Bird, Ken Griffey Jr., Eli Manning, Aly Raisman, Chris Paul and more are in the same room. That is not just optics, that is a statement. Patrick posted the announcement to his Instagram stories with zero caption, letting the moment speak for itself.Kansas City is now a two-sport dynasty incubator, one on the field, one in expansion mode. CPKC Stadium changed the landscape. A $52 million facilities expansion is in motion. The Current already own a league-leading revenue mark.Mahomes said it himself about the Chiefs: “You got to kind of learn from it fast.” Brittany is applying that philosophy, system-wide.","Brittany Mahomes has joined a star-studded advisory board for the NWSL, focusing on marketing, branding, and player initiatives starting in 2026.

Potential Benefits for the Philadelphia Phillies

Themay be gearing up for a major offseason rotation, with reports linking them to formeras a potential replacement for Harrison Bader. Following another postseason run that fell just short of a World Series berth, the Phillies are looking to strengthen their outfield and add more firepower to their lineup - and Bellinger’s combination of elite defense, power hitting, and versatility could be exactly what they need.Bellinger’s market value has surged after a strong season with the New York Yankees, and with his decision to opt out of his $25 million player option, he’s expected to command a lucrative multi-year deal worth around $80 million. As one of the most dynamic free agents available, the 30-year-old outfielder’s ability to play multiple positions makes him an attractive fit for Philadelphia, especially as they aim to take the next step toward championship contention.After a strong season in New York, Cody Bellinger officially opted out of his contract with the Yankees, making him one of the most coveted free agents this winter. The 30-year-old had a $25 million player option for the upcoming season but is now set to explore a long-term deal that could reportedly reach around $80 million.ESPN’s Jorge Castillo broke the initial news, writing: “As expected, New York Yankees outfielder Cody Bellinger plans to opt out of his contract and become a free agent next month, a source told ESPN.Bellinger, 30, has a $25 million player option for next season. After a rebound season in his first year in pinstripes, he presumably will receive widespread interest in free agency -it should yield a lucrative multi-year contract. ” (H/t: Sporting News)Following the World Series, MLB Network insider Jon Heyman confirmed the move, stating that Bellinger had officially opted out.Cody Bellinger’s time in New York proved to be a revival of sorts. After being traded from the Chicago Cubs in what many described as a salary dump, the outfielder delivered one of his best all-around seasons in years.His power numbers and improved plate discipline - highlighted by a career-best 13.7% strikeout rate - reaffirmed his value as a premier offensive weapon. His defensive flexibility further boosts his market value, with the ability to play all three outfield spots and even first base when needed.While both New York teams - the Yankees and Mets - are onsidered strong contenders to bring him aboard, Sports Illustrated’s Will Laws and Nick Selbe see the Philadelphia Phillies as a realistic and strategic fit for Bellinger.They wrote: “After being traded to New York in what was essentially a salary dump for the Cubs, Bellinger swatted 29 home runs - his most since hitting 47 in his MVP campaign in 2019 - to go along with a career-best 13.7% strikeout rate. Add in plus outfield defense in the corners and capable coverage in center field, and the decision to opt out of his contract was an easy one. Bellinger is clearly one of the premier bats available this winter - not too bad for a guy who was non-tendered by the Dodgers just three years ago. ”Adding Cody Bellinger would not only fill the gap left by Harrison Bader but also provide lineup versatility for manager Rob Thomson. Bellinger could handle center field duties while occasionally stepping in at first base to give Bryce Harper rest days as a designated hitter.• Reliable left-handed bat with power• Defensive depth across multiple positions• Veteran leadership and championship experience• Proven postseason performerBellinger’s offensive consistency and defensive reliability could be exactly what the Philadelphia Phillies need to make another deep playoff run after falling short of a World Series appearance.Cody Bellinger’s decision to hit the open market sets the stage for an intense bidding war, but the Philadelphia Phillies appear to be a logical and appealing destination. His combination of power, defense, and playoff experience makes him an ideal fit for a franchise eager to turn near misses into championships.Also read: MLB trade rumors: New York Mets predicted to land $120 million Boston Red Sox superstar to reset lineup and boost playoff push If Philadelphia lands the former MVP, it could be the decisive move that propels them back to the World Series conversation.","Cody Bellinger officially opted out of his contract with the New York Yankees, making him one of the most coveted free agents this winter.

A Calculated Gamble

Theare reportedly exploring a bold move this offseason that could redefine their bullpen and playoff aspirations. Rumors suggest that the team is eyeing formerfor a potential one-year, $10 million deal - a calculated attempt to solidify their late-inning pitching. After a rollercoaster 2025 season with the New York Yankees, Williams could be the piece Detroit needs to make a serious run.As TJ Morin noted, “The Detroit Tigers seem to only have one more chance at a title run with their Cy Young, Tarik Skubal, if they don’t trade him this offseason.” With Skubal’s future uncertain, adding an elite reliever like Williams may be Detroit’s final push toward championship contention. (H/t: Sporting News)Devin Williams’ 2025 season was far from his usual dominance. The right-hander, who built his reputation between 2021 and 2024 with a sub-2.50 ERA, struggled in New York’s pressure cooker environment. He finished the year with a 4.79 ERA, 18 saves, 90 strikeouts in 62 innings, and several blown opportunities. Analysts attribute the dip to Yankee Stadium’s hitter-friendly setup and the unrelenting scrutiny of New York’s media.Now entering free agency, Williams is unlikely to return to the Bronx.A fresh start in Detroit could help him rediscover his rhythm, while the Detroit Tigers gain a much-needed veteran presence in a bullpen desperate for consistency.Comerica Park’s spacious dimensions and reputation as a pitcher-friendly venue make it an ideal landing spot for Devin Williams. Detroit’s bullpen has lacked a high-strikeout closer since Gregory Soto’s departure, and Williams - still boasting a 13.06 K/9 rate - fits that need perfectly. For Williams, Detroit offers a lower-pressure market and the perfect rebound setting.• Acquire a proven late-inning reliever with elite strikeout potential• Improve bullpen depth and mentorship for younger arms• Low-risk, high-reward one-year deal• Opportunity to reset his market value• A ballpark that minimizes home runs and hard contact• Freedom from the high expectations of New York• Free up payroll for more consistent bullpen options• End uncertainty around Devin Williams’ rebound potentialFor both sides, this rumored deal is a strategic test. The Detroit Tigers get a potential game-changer for a short-term price, while Devin Williams gets a chance to rebuild his image in a friendlier environment. The Yankees, meanwhile, gain financial flexibility.Also read: MLB trade rumors: Los Angeles Dodgers potentially eyeing $57 Million Chicago Cubs star in blockbuster deal to bolster squad before trade deadline If the deal materializes, it could mark a turning point for Detroit’s bullpen - and perhaps Williams’ career.

Suryakumar Yadav and Abhishek Sharma press conference: On touching a trophy, Women's World Cup, more

NEW DELHI: India’s final T20I against Australia at The Gabba in Brisbane ended without a result as persistent rain and lightning forced the match to be abandoned on Saturday. Before the weather intervened, India had raced to 52 for no loss in just 4.5 overs, sealing the five-match series 2-1.This result gave India their fifth consecutive T20I series win over Australia, underlining their continued dominance in the shortest format. Openers Abhishek Sharma (23 not out) and Shubman Gill (29 not out) provided a brisk start, treating the crowd to some delightful strokeplay before the skies opened up and forced the players off the field.Abhishek, who became the second fastest Indian to reach 1000 T20I runs, was given two early lives in the powerplay — first when Glenn Maxwell dropped him at long-off off Ben Dwarshuis, and then when Dwarshuis himself put down a chance at the boundary off Nathan Ellis. Making the most of those reprieves, the left-hander struck two elegant boundaries and looked set for a big score before rain had the final say. Gill, meanwhile, looked in sublime touch, timing his shots beautifully and hitting six boundaries.Once play was called off, India were declared series winners, having earlier registered victories in Hobart and the Gold Coast after losing the opening match in Melbourne.After the match, Abhishek Sharma and captain Suryakumar Yadav addressed the media.During the press conference, a reporter asked Abhishek about his partnership with Shubman Gill, which has often been described as an “Ice and Fire” combination.Abhishek smiled and responded, “I’d actually say we’re more like fire and fire.

“Play with me”: Shohei Ohtani's heartfelt words to Miguel Rojas after game-changing World Series home run win hearts online,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/play-with-me-shohei-ohtanis-heartfelt-words-to-miguel-rojas-after-game-changing-world-series-home-run-win-hearts-online/articleshow/125148678.cms,"Shohei Ohtani (Image via: Gary A.

Shohei Ohtani’s message shows his bond with teammates runs deeper than the game

Miguel Rojas wasn’t supposed to be the headline hero of the World Series — but baseball loves surprises. When the veteran infielder crushed a game-changing home run in the Fall Classic, he gave the Los Angeles Dodgers more than just a lead — he gave them momentum. The 36-year-old, who’s built his career on grit and defense, found himself at the center of one of the most emotional moments of the Dodgers’ championship run. And what followed in the dugout turned that swing into something unforgettable.Rojas later shared that as he returned to the bench, he was greeted by none other than Shohei Ohtani — the two-way superstar who has transformed the Dodgers’ clubhouse with both talent and heart. Speaking to MLB broadcaster Chris Rose, Rojas revealed how Ohtani walked up to him, smiling, and said something that instantly became a story fans can’t stop talking about. “I think one of the coolest things that happened in my life so far. ... I’m by the bat rack like laying my helmet, and Shohei came to me and say ‘Miggy, you can’t retire next year. You’re playing with me for 10 more years,’” Rojas recalled, laughing as he relived the moment.It was just one line, but it spoke volumes. Rojas, who has often hinted at nearing the end of his playing career, replied with humor and heart: “Shohei, I’m old, and I don’t know if I can play for 10 more years, but I’ll play with you next year for sure.”That lighthearted exchange summed up everything fans love about this Dodgers team — a blend of experience, youth, and unshakable camaraderie. Ohtani, known for his calm presence and relentless work ethic, has not only redefined the game with his two-way brilliance but also transformed the dugout energy. His bond with veterans like Rojas proves that leadership isn’t just about home runs or strikeouts — it’s about lifting the people around you.Moments like these remind fans why the Dodgers continue to feel more like a family than a franchise. Behind the fireworks and the trophies lies a team built on mutual respect and shared joy. When Shohei Ohtani told Rojas, “Play with me,” it wasn’t just a joke — it was a glimpse into the heart of a champion.For Rojas, that simple gesture from one of baseball’s biggest stars turned a personal milestone into something bigger — a moment of connection that defined the Dodgers’ back-to-back World Series triumphs. And for fans, it’s a reminder that the best stories in baseball don’t just happen on the field — they’re written in the dugout, one heartfelt word at a time. Because sometimes it's not the swing that makes history - it's the bond behind it. And in that quiet dugout moment, Shohei Ohtani and Miguel Rojas showed the world exactly what championship heart looks like. Moments like this remind everyone that baseball's real magic isn't in the stats - it's in the people who make it unforgettable.Also read: ""Falling in love again"": Shane Bieber’s wife Kara turns Toronto Blue Jays’ World Series heartbreak into a sweet family moment fans can’t stop talking about","Miguel Rojas hit a game-changing home run in the World Series for the Los Angeles Dodgers.

Sidney Crosby’s frustration grows as Penguins’ offense sputters



More NHL coverage

The Pittsburgh Penguins fell 2-1 in a shootout to the New Jersey Devils in a tense divisional battle on Saturday night, and captain Sidney Crosby’s emotions afterward said it all. Despite a strong outing in net by Arturs Silovs, the Penguins’ offense couldn’t capitalize on their opportunities, leaving Crosby visibly frustrated by the team’s inability to find the back of the net. It wasn’t a lack of effort—it was about execution, and the Penguins captain made that clear.“We can’t accept just getting one [goal], but sometimes the game’s going to dictate that. Sometimes it’s not going to go your way, [but] we’ve just got to continue to play the right way. I thought we did that,” Crosby said following the defeat. “We didn’t try to cheat for offense. We had some good looks, [but] unfortunately they didn’t go in.”The Penguins dictated much of the game’s tempo, especially through the first two periods, outshooting and out-chancing the Devils. Arturs Silovs was solid in goal, making 23 saves and keeping the Penguins within striking distance. Ryan Graves provided the lone tally for Pittsburgh, but the lack of finish around the net proved costly against a sharp Jake Allen, who turned away several high-quality chances.Saturday’s result was more than just another loss—it was a missed opportunity. With first place in the Metropolitan Division on the line, the Penguins now sit just one point behind the Devils. The performance was strong, but the inability to convert when it mattered most highlighted an ongoing concern for a team looking to establish consistency.The frustration is understandable, especially for Crosby, who continues to lead by example in his 19th NHL season. Earlier in the year, he was at the center of trade rumors linking him to the Montreal Canadiens, but his focus remains fixed on one goal—winning another Stanley Cup with Pittsburgh. Under new head coach Dan Muse, who took over after Mike Sullivan’s departure, the Penguins have found renewed energy and structure.Whether they can maintain that edge deep into the season remains to be seen. For now, the message from Crosby is simple: effort alone isn’t enough. The Penguins must turn strong play into tangible results if they want to stay on top of one of hockey’s toughest divisions.","Pittsburgh Penguins lost 2-1 in a shootout to the New Jersey Devils on Saturday night.

A Battle of Momentum at Fiserv Forum

Thereceived a huge boost ahead of their NBA Cup matchup against the Chicago Bulls on November 7, 2025, as superstar. This update comes as a relief for Bucks fans who were concerned after the Greek Freak dealt with left knee soreness in recent days. With his name officially removed from the injury list, Giannis is set to lead Milwaukee in a must-win clash against a red-hot Bulls team that currently sits atop the Eastern Conference with a 6-1 record.This game is shaping up to be one of the standout fixtures of the NBA Cup group stage, featuring two franchises with contrasting trajectories. The Bucks are looking to regain momentum after a recent loss to the Toronto Raptors, while the Bulls have been one of the league’s early-season surprises, combining solid defense with balanced scoring. Having Giannis back on the floor gives Milwaukee the competitive edge they need to keep pace with their conference rivals.Giannis Antetokounmpo has been nothing short of dominant this season, averaging 32.3 points, 12.6 rebounds, and 6.3 assists per game. His performance continues to solidify his reputation as one of the most impactful players in the NBA. The Milwaukee Bucks will rely heavily on his leadership and all-around game, especially considering their current injury situation.Despite the good news surrounding Giannis, the Bucks will be missing other key contributors. Kevin Porter Jr. is out after undergoing surgery on his right knee, and Taurean Prince remains sidelined with a neck strain. These absences could shorten Milwaukee’s rotation, making Giannis Antetokounmpo’s presence even more vital to the team’s success.The Chicago Bulls enter the matchup in excellent form but are also dealing with health setbacks. Star guard Coby White has been ruled out, while Ayo Dosunmu’s availability remains uncertain. Even so, the Bulls’ depth has shined this season, with standout performances from Josh Giddey and Nikola Vucevic helping Chicago maintain its strong early record. The Bulls’ combination of youth and experience has created a winning formula, but missing White could test their offensive rhythm against a resilient Bucks squad.Tonight’s showdown promises intensity, as both teams aim to solidify their positions in the NBA Cup standings. The Milwaukee Bucks, led by a determined Giannis Antetokounmpo, will look to bounce back on their home court at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

Cam Thomas’ sudden setback forced the Brooklyn Nets to rethink its strategies in a early-season twist

Due to an injury to the same problematic left hamstring that destroyed the previous season, Cam Thomas, the Brooklyn Nets ' top scorer was forced to miss Wednesday night's 112-103 victory over the Indiana Pacers. With 6:46 remaining in the first quarter against the Pacers, Thomas missed a 15-foot stepback jumper, seemingly hurting himself on the landing.Cam Thomas was later classified as OUT by the team prior to tonight's game against the Detroit Pistons. He was sidelined indefinitely as a result of the setback, in addition to being out for the rest of the match. The great shooting guard may face future difficulties after re-injuring the same hamstring that prevented him from playing in 59 games the previous season.Cam Thomas, who recently sustained a hamstring injury, will be missing from Brooklyn. Even though he will be missed, this might be the ideal chance for the rookies. Thomas had a great start to the season prior to the injury , averaging 21.4 points on 40.2% field goal and 35.6% three-point shooting.However, in his eight starts, he has only contributed 2.6 assists per game, which is indicative of his ongoing scoring-first role.Even so, Thomas has been making every effort to enjoy playing basketball some more.Thomas may miss Friday's game against the Detroit Pistons , and the team will reevaluate him on Thursday, according to head coach Jordi Fernandez. Although it's regrettable that Brooklyn's 23-year-old star might not be playing, this presents a chance that the team should take advantage of right away.His absence comes at the worst possible moment for the Nets. With Drake Powell and Ben Saraf out for tonight's game, the squad has already suffered several blows to its depth. Brooklyn still lacks a starting point guard who can reliably move the ball within the offence without Thomas.The Brooklyn Nets now have a number in the victory column that is greater than zero. On Wednesday night, the Nets defeated the Indiana Pacers 112-103 to secure their first victory of the season away from home.For a team that had its worst start in ten years, it was a breath of relief. Brooklyn is rebuilding, so dropping games makes sense. Now, they are ready for their upcoming matches, with or without Thomas.Also read: Is Cam Thomas playing?

How Connor McDavid's wife Lauren Kyle’s bold interior design identity is redefining what an NHL power couple looks like,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/how-connor-mcdavids-wife-lauren-kyles-bold-interior-design-identity-is-redefining-what-an-nhl-power-couple-looks-like/articleshow/125149911.cms,"Lauren Kyle, fiancée of NHL star Connor McDavid, is redefining the role of athletes' partners. She's built a powerful personal brand centered on sophisticated home design, proving WAGs can be influential entrepreneurs. Kyle's approach challenges traditional NHL masculinity, pushing the league towards a more modern, visually driven era and establishing herself as a significant market voice.

Lauren Kyle’s brand narrative reflects the shift toward design-led, CEO-style WAGs rather than just “player wives”





More coverage on NHL:

There was a time when the partners of pro athletes were barely seen, rarely quoted, and almost never included in the marketing conversation, especially in the NHL, which historically hosts one of the most “closed doors, keep it all quiet” cultures in North American sports. But Lauren Kyle, the fiancée of Edmonton Oilers superstar Connor McDavid , doesn’t exist in that old template.She’s not an accessory. She is the architect of a personal brand that leans into design, refinement, and highly curated home aesthetics. The conversations around her work have been loud, polarizing, and surprisingly influential. And now, she’s becoming a case study in how WAG entrepreneurship can shape cultural direction, not just add gloss to a player’s fame.Lauren Kyle’s rise isn’t simply about the “white and metallic house” moment that went viral. It’s the fact that she doubled down, she didn’t run from the discourse. She recast the reaction as proof that her vision evokes emotion. And in a luxury economy, emotion sells.Modern NHL fans tend to assume hockey culture = traditional masculinity + limited visual references. But Kyle is pushing an entirely different energy, magazine spreads, reflective surfaces, lifestyle-forward execution, and design-first storytelling.And that is exactly why her entrepreneurial trajectory matters. She isn’t evolving alongside the NHL brand, she’s dragging parts of the league into a more visually modern era with her.And it also reframes McDavid’s public image: not just athlete, but cultural architecture subject. Today, when people say things like “Lauren Kyle has an aesthetic,” that’s not gossip, that’s branding evidence. It means she has moved from a partner role to a market voice.Her message isn’t subtle: hockey wives aren’t background props anymore. Lauren Kyle is shaping the stage itself and the NHL has never seen a design-forward power couple quite like this.","Lauren Kyle, fiancée of NHL star Connor McDavid, is redefining the role of athletes' partners.

Trigger warning:

Dak Prescott lost his older brother Jace to suicide and now his defensive end Marshawn Kneeland to apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound

More news on Dallas Cowboys:

This story contains references to suicide.Three days ago, Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott ’s teammate Marshawn Kneeland, the 24-year-old defensive end scored his first career touchdown of the 2025 season. Now, the world is reeling from the devastating news of Kneeland’s death, reportedly from a self-inflicted gunshot wound after a police chase. Frisco police said they were called to locate a vehicle that had evaded officers during a pursuit. They found the car crashed on the southbound Dallas Parkway near Warren Parkway. Officers said Kneeland had fled the scene. As police were searching for him, they were informed that he had “expressed suicidal ideations.” At 1:31 AM, they found him “deceased with what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound.” The Collin County Medical Examiner’s Office will determine the official cause of death.Heartfelt tributes poured in after his tragic passing. Among them was the quarterback who had lost his defensive end. He spoke about Kneeland with CBS Sports Texas at his alma mater, Haughton High School, during a special field dedication ceremony.“It’s been a very tough day,” Dak Prescott said. “As you said, it started early this morning, finding out the news—tragic loss. I hurt. Heavy, heavy heart today. I hurt for Marshawn. I hurt for his family. I’m hurt for his girlfriend. I hurt for every single one of my teammates. This is a pain that you don’t wish upon anybody. You wish none of us had to go through this. You wish Marshawn didn’t have to go through what he had went through. And just thankful for each moment we have in this life. And don’t take it for granted, and hug and love those that you do. It’s okay to feel however you’re feeling. And I’ll tell you, first and foremost, I don’t always have the answers and today is not a day that I felt like I had answers.”“Triggering day for many reasons,” Prescott said. “On top of just knowing that I had today, and hard to balance my emotions today and not have a day that I have words other than I love you for friends and families, and people who may be struggling. Yeah, I love them. Obviously, we had a Zoom call, and a few people who spoke did an amazing job, but as I said, it’s to tell that person how I feel about them when I see them. Tough moments for this team. As I said, I feel hurt for everybody that’s involved in this and Marshawn’s family and loved ones.”The Dallas Cowboys are on their bye week now, and this tragic news has shaken them, especially the quarterback, who lost his brother to suicide. Jace Prescott died by suicide in April 2020 at 31 years old. In September 2020, the star signal-caller spoke about his older brother, Jace, to Pat Doney of NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth. Prescott appeared as a guest on “In Depth with Graham Bensinger.”“Honestly, a couple of days before my brother passed, I started experiencing depression,” Prescott said. “I didn’t know what I was going through, to say the least, and hadn’t been sleeping well at all. But for one night, I sleep the best I’ve slept, missing ten-plus calls from (my brother) and giving my dad enough time to come in my bedroom and tell me what had happened. So, I woke up after the best night of sleep I’ve had in 2020 from the worst news, some of the worst news I’ll ever get. ”He recalled receiving the news from his father. “I mean, obviously, there were tears and tears and tears,” he told Besinger. “I sat there and tried to process what had happened and wanted to ask why for so many reasons...and as much as you want to ask why, I know my brother, and he had a lot of burdens on him.”The burdens he mentioned were linked to their mother’s colon cancer treatment, with Jace as her primary caregiver. They lost their mother, Peggy Prescott, in November 2013. After his brother’s passing, Prescott and his other brother, Tad, promised to be more open with each other.","Dak Prescott lost his older brother Jace to suicide and now his defensive end Marshawn Kneeland to apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. “It’s been a very tough day,” Dak Prescott said.

Buffalo Sabres stunned as Rasmus Dahlin takes personal leave,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/buffalo-sabres-stunned-as-rasmus-dahlin-takes-personal-leave/articleshow/125171976.cms,"Rasmus Dahlin (Image Via Twitter)

How the Buffalo Sabres will adjust Without their Captain on the Ice



The Buffalo Sabres are getting ready to go without their captain and mainstay on defense, Rasmus Dahlin, who has left the team for an unspecified period for personal reasons. The team made the announcement on Friday that Dahlin will be away while he returns home to Sweden to be with his fiancée, Carolina Matovac. The 25-year-old defenseman has been a consistent contributor to Buffalo's defense this season, with nine points in 14 games, but now the focus understandably shifts from hockey to family.Dahlin's choice coincides with a very personal and emotional story in his life. Matovac, suffering from sudden heart failure in summer, needed emergency CPR, life support, and finally a heart transplant. She has been recuperating in Sweden while Dahlin has been in North America to start the NHL season. The Athletic's Matthew Fairburn reports that Sabres coach Lindy Ruff has revealed that Matovac's condition is stable and the whole team is behind Dahlin's move. Ruff added, ""I don’t think you can describe it. I don’t think you can feel what he’s feeling. I’m very passionate about the fact that no one would want to walk in his shoes and have dealt with what he dealt with. He has the support of everybody on this.""With Dahlin gone, Buffalo will have to make adjustments both in terms of playing style and atmosphere in the locker room. His absence as captain and one of the best defensemen in the NHL creates a huge gap in both leadership and playmaking.It is anticipated that defensemen Owen Power and Mattias Samuelsson will take the extra defensive workload during Dahlin's leave of absence, as the Sabres will try to remain competitive. Ruff might also depend to a greater extent on inexperienced defensemen in the areas of keeping the puck and changing the play, which will be a challenge that can uncover maturity and depth in Buffalo’s young core that is already going through an emotional period.The Sabres are now looking at the picture beyond just victories and defeats. The number one thing on their list is to continue taking care of Dahlin and his family till the latter is able to come back — something that even in top-level sports, there are instances that are more than just the match.More coverage on NHL","Rasmus Dahlin will be away while he returns home to Sweden to be with his fiancée, Carolina Matovac.

Tyreek Hill’s future remains uncertain as he weighs recovery, retirement options



More NFL coverage

Tyreek Hill isn’t letting the speculation about his future with the Miami Dolphins slide. Rumors spread like wildfire after NFL reporter Omar Kelly suggested the star wide receiver could be cut in 2026 to free up cap space, pointing to his season-ending knee injury and the potential financial benefit of an insurance policy if he retired. Hill reacted to it immediately on social media with a blunt and bold, 5-word message: “Omar you don’t know shiii.”The injury, suffered in Week 4 during Miami’s 27-21 victory over the New York Jets, was a major blow for both Hill and the Dolphins. He tore multiple ligaments in his knee, forcing surgery the following day and ending his 2025 season. Before the injury, Hill had already shown flashes of his usual explosiveness, compiling 265 yards and one touchdown in just four games. Hill’s NFL journey began with the Kansas City Chiefs before he was traded to Miami in 2022. He signed a four-year, $120 million extension with the Dolphins, placing him among the league’s highest-paid receivers. Over his four seasons in Miami, Hill has amassed 4,733 receiving yards and 27 touchdowns, helping the team reach the playoffs twice and serving as one of the offense’s primary weapons.Despite the rumors, Hill has been candid about weighing retirement depending on his physical and mental readiness.On the “The Set” podcast with former teammate Terron Armstead, Hill reflected on the toll football takes. He stressed that he wants to be thoughtful about any decision and appreciates the balance between family life and career accomplishments. “It’s supposed to happen real soon, so wish us both luck,” Hill remarked, acknowledging the uncertainty surrounding his next steps.Miami as a franchise is also facing turbulence. After a disappointing 2-7 start, general manager Chris Grier was let go, and head coach Mike McDaniel’s job has come under scrutiny. Hill’s absence has amplified the team’s struggles, raising questions about how the Dolphins will perform without one of their top playmakers.For now, Hill’s message to fans and critics is clear: speculation will not dictate his path. Recovery and preparation remain his priorities, and Miami supporters will be watching closely to see if he can return to his elite form and continue shaping the team’s offense.","Tyreek Hill responded to speculation about his future with the Miami Dolphins on social media.

Tom Brady reacts publicly to Drew Brees replacing Mark Sanchez at FOX Sports

Drew Brees steps into Mark Sanchez’s former role as Brady highlights the accuracy conversation



Tom Brady reacted to Drew Brees taking over Mark Sanchez’s spot at FOX Sports, and the response instantly pulled attention across the NFL . The move puts two of the most accurate quarterbacks in league history under the same network roof, and Brady made sure the focus keyword, Tom Brady, was in the first line as he set the tone with his usual dry-fire humor.Brees’ hiring comes as FOX Sports officially parted ways with Sanchez following his ongoing felony case. The network announced Brees’ arrival with a highlight reel, and Brady immediately jumped in with a punchy, public welcome. The two quarterbacks now headline a reshaped analyst lineup built on production, accuracy and career-long credibility.Tom Brady did not hold back when FOX Sports confirmed Drew Brees as the new analyst replacing Mark Sanchez. Brady shared FOX Sports’ announcement clip and attached a line that instantly made waves across social media. His message read:“And just like that I become the 3rd most accurate QB at @FOXSports (Terry still has both of us beat) Welcome to the family @drewbrees!!!”The accuracy comment was rooted in fact. Drew Brees retired with a 67.7% completion rate, which places him third all time behind Joe Burrow and Tua Tagovailoa. Brady’s reaction added a layer of self-awareness and competition that people rarely hear from him, and it worked because the numbers back all of it.Brees is stepping into a major role. FOX Sports expects him to call games with Adam Amin starting next week and remain on the team through at least 2026. He already has experience across NBC Sports, ESPN’s “First Take” and Netflix’s international game coverage. FOX Sports is betting on a quarterback who built his legacy on precision, control and film-room mastery.Mark Sanchez’s exit shifts the balance of FOX’s broadcast team. According to multiple outlets, FOX Sports cut ties as Sanchez faces a felony battery case in Indiana. He pleaded not guilty, and the legal process is ongoing. FOX Sports confirmed to The Athletic that he is no longer part of the broadcast crew. The decision opened the lane for Brees, and Brady’s reaction shows that the quarterback fraternity is already treating the move as a major shakeup.Drew Brees enters FOX Sports at a moment when the network needs stability, professionalism and credibility in the booth. He retired with 80,358 passing yards, 571 touchdowns and one of the most efficient careers the league has ever seen. The numbers place him behind Tom Brady in yardage and touchdowns but ahead of almost everyone in accuracy and consistency.Brees shared his own statement following the announcement. He said:“I appreciate the opportunity FOX has given me in the booth and with their team. I hope my passion for this game is reflected in the knowledge and insight I provide to fans each Sunday.”His arrival is rooted in a reputation built across two decades with the New Orleans Saints and the San Diego Chargers. Former teammate Darren Sproles described Brees’ leadership on “Up & Adams,” saying:“For him, to mention me out of all the weapons that he had. That is very special. With Drew, you didn’t have to think like that on the field. Drew always put you in the right place at the right time.”These details matter because FOX Sports is replacing a quarterback known for chaotic storylines with one known for structure and precision. Mark Sanchez’s legal issues removed him from the booth as he deals with felony battery and multiple misdemeanor charges after an incident in Indianapolis earlier this year. He had already been sidelined after being stabbed and arrested on the same night. He pleaded not guilty and awaits further proceedings.Drew Brees offers none of the uncertainty, and that is part of the reason FOX Sports moved quickly. He already worked on NBC’s Notre Dame broadcasts, contributed to Football Night in America, and appeared on “First Take” before signing with FOX Sports. His presence turns the broadcast team into a high-accuracy, high-football-IQ group, which pairs naturally with the tone Tom Brady wants to bring to television.Brady himself is walking into his own broadcast era. He will be in the booth this Sunday covering the Detroit Lions and Washington Commanders, while the New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers face each other in one of the biggest matchups of the weekend. Brady refused to pick a side in the game, saying:“Just... don’t ask me to pick any sides here.”","Tom Brady welcomed Drew Brees to FOX Sports after Mark Sanchez’s exit.

Artemi Panarin sparks Rangers’ record-setting victory over Red Wings

More coverage on NHL:

The New York Rangers extended their remarkable start to the season with a dominant 4-1 victory over the Detroit Red Wings at Little Caesars Arena on Friday night. Under head coach Mike Sullivan, the Rangers have been virtually unstoppable on the road, securing their seventh consecutive away win—a new NHL record to open a season. The triumph not only underscored their balance and depth but also highlighted Artemi Panarin’s world-class scoring touch.Panarin was at his electric best, recording a goal and two assists to lead the charge. His third-period strike, set up by Mika Zibanejad, was the defining moment of the night, so precise and composed that even Sullivan couldn’t help but praise his star forward, saying, “That was a goal-scorer’s goal.” The victory also featured contributions from Alexis Lafreniere, who scored his 200th career NHL point, and goaltender Jonathan Quick, who stopped 32 shots to keep Detroit’s offense in check.With every game, Artemi Panarin continues to prove why he’s one of the NHL’s elite offensive talents. His creativity, puck control, and finishing ability have become the backbone of the Rangers’ early-season dominance. Against Detroit, Panarin not only created scoring chances but dictated the pace of play, leaving the Red Wings struggling to contain his line. Sullivan credited Panarin’s consistency and leadership, emphasizing that his ability to elevate those around him is what drives the team’s success.For the Red Wings, Patrick Kane’s return from injury provided a spark, but it wasn’t enough to shift the momentum. J.T. Compher netted Detroit’s lone goal, while goaltender Cam Talbot faced unrelenting pressure from New York’s deep offensive unit. The Rangers’ cohesive play and defensive poise continue to set them apart, with veterans and young stars performing in sync.As the Rangers return home, they carry both confidence and momentum, looking to build on a record-setting start that has turned them into early Stanley Cup contenders. With Panarin leading the offense and Mike Sullivan steering a disciplined, high-energy roster, the Rangers look every bit like the team to beat this NHL season. Their combination of elite scoring depth, veteran goaltending, and strong two-way play has firmly positioned New York among the NHL’s top contenders in 2025.","The New York Rangers extended their remarkable start to the season with a dominant 4-1 victory over the Detroit Red Wings at Little Caesars Arena on Friday night.

During its recent Board meeting in Dubai on Friday, the global cricket body confirmed that six teams each from both men's and women's categories will feature in cricket's first appearance at the Games since the 1900 Paris Olympics.The ICC has been in a huddle discussing the possible arrangements, and the initial idea of just the top six teams as per the ICC T20I rankings has been put to rest. It will now be an arrangement where the top team from each region/continent will make the cut, and the sixth team will come through a global qualifier.""There have been discussions around the participation of teams, and it has been decided that the six teams will come through the top-ranked team from each region/continent, while the sixth comes from the global qualifier. The details will be shared by the ICC in due course, but the roadmap has more or less been frozen,"" says a veteran administrator who was part of the meeting in Dubai.The arrangement means every top side from each continent/region will make the first five teams. That essentially means that, based on current rankings, India qualify from Asia, Australia from Oceania, England from Europe, South Africa from Africa, and it will be interesting to see whether the USA — considering they are hosts — qualify from the Americas or West Indies would take the spot. The details of the global qualifier are likely to be shared by the global cricket body soon.Additionally, there is a small possibility of seeing an India vs Pakistan contest at LA28, as the details of the global qualifier are still unknown. In the detailed statement after the meeting, the ICC mentioned the success of women's cricket and shared an update on the LA28 Games.""The Board reviewed the ICC’s ongoing engagement with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games (LA28), as cricket deepens its footprint in the global multisport landscape. At LA28, both the men’s and women’s T20 events will feature six teams each, comprising 28 matches in total,"" read the media release.",Cricket set to return to the Olympics after over a century. ICC has finalised how the six participating teams will be picked for the 2028 Los Angeles Games. Six teams each from both men's and women's categories will feature in cricket's first appearance at the Games since the 1900 Paris Olympics.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125176463,imgsize-95554,width-400,resizemode-4/india-pak-fans-0911-c.jpg"
NHL Injury Update: Calgary Flames rookie Zayne Parekh injured in game against Chicago Blackhawks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-injury-update-calgary-flames-rookie-zayne-parekh-injured-in-game-against-chicago-blackhawks/articleshow/125186604.cms,"Zayne Parekh (Image Via Twitter)

Ryan Huska shares concerning update on Zayne Parekh’s Injury

The night turned out to be tragic for the Calgary Flames as Zayne Parekh, the rookie defenseman, suffered an upper-body injury, leading to his leaving the match against the Chicago Blackhawks. This unpleasant occurrence took place during the second half of the match at the Scotiabank Saddledome when the 19-year-old player was getting a hard body-check by Nick Foligno, the captain of the visiting team. Parekh immediately disappeared into the locker room and later was branded by the team that he would not rejoin the match, which Calgary lost by zero to four.His exit, Parekh had already played 6:25 ice time in just seven shifts, revealing his offensive confidence that was the reason for him being a top-10 draft pick. Nonetheless, it was still an off night for both teams as Blackhawks winger Frank Nazar also went out with a supposed injury after the second period when he awkwardly collided with Joel Farabee, who had just left the ice. There were many scrums and three fights through the first two periods, indicating the physical contact between two inexperienced teams still finding their way and trying to get into the season of play.The day after, Flames' head coach Ryan Huska stated the negative aspect of the injury situation for Calgary fans as he told the reporters that Parekh ""gonna miss a little bit of time."" This is, in reality, a blow for both the player and the club since Parekh had started to assert himself in the NHL after being chosen as the number nine overall in the 2024 NHL Draft. The native of Markham, Ontario, has recorded one assist in eleven games this season while switching through the bottom defensive pairs of Calgary.The absence of Parekh creates yet another void in a Flames lineup that is having a hard time getting wins and is placed at the bottom of the NHL standings with a record of 4-10-2. His condition will receive special attention, more so with the IIHF World Junior Championship round the corner - a tournament he could participate in if he gets better and the team gives him the green light.More coverage on NHL","Zayne Parekh, the Calgary Flames rookie defenseman, suffered an upper-body injury, leading to his leaving the match against the Chicago Blackhawks.
