NEW DELHI: BJP leader and West Bengal's leader of the opposition Suvendu Adhikari on Thursday 'felicitated' the three men arrested for allegedly assaulting two chicken patty vendors at a Gita recital event in Kolkata, shortly after they were released on bail.Adhikari, once a close aide of chief minister and Trinamool Congress (TMC) supremo Mamata Banerjee , posted photos of the event on Facebook.""I want to tell Mamata Banerjee that you cannot suppress ‘sanatanis’ by unleashing your loyalist police on them. The fight to protect religion will continue, and in this fight, I stand with every Hindu, along with countless supporters of Hindutva,"" the Nandigram MLA wrote.Later, speaking to reporters, Adhikari remarked that “the voice of justice still prevails silently in India.” Referring to Banerjee’s earlier comments on the controversy, he alleged that the chief minister had “arrogantly” claimed credit for the arrests.""Who is she to decide arrests?"" he asked.He emphasised that while he is a legislator, leader of the opposition and BJP member, his identity as a Hindu comes first. “If my Hindu brothers and sisters are in trouble, my primary duty is to protect my dharma. That is what the Gita has taught me,” he asserted.Adhikari also took credit for the trio’s release, noting that he had sent his legal team to the Maidan police station—where the case was registered—and coordinated with several lawyers who worked together to secure their bail.The three were released by the Bankshall court on personal bonds of Rs 1,000 each.The vendors had complained that a group of youths assaulted them for selling non-vegetarian food at the religious event and forced them to do sit-ups while holding their ears. Police intervened after a purported video of the incident went viral on social media.","BJP leader and West Bengal's leader of the opposition Suvendu Adhikari 'felicitated' the three men arrested for allegedly assaulting two chicken patty vendors at a Gita recital event in Kolkata.

Smriti Mandhana breaks silence after wedding cancelled: 'I don’t think I love anything more than cricket',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/smriti-mandhana-breaks-silence-after-wedding-cancelled-i-dont-think-i-love-/articleshow/125892786.cms,"Smriti Mandhana (X)

NEW DELHI: India's batting sensation and ODI World Cup-winning vice-captain Smriti Mandhana said that one truth has become clearer to her than anything else over the past 12 years as a professional cricketer — there is nothing she cares about more deeply than the game of cricket.India’s most accomplished left-handed batter in women's cricket looked back on her journey, from her international debut in 2013 to helping India lift the ICC ODI World Cup last month for the first time in their history, while speaking at the Amazon Smbhav Summit on Wednesday. Mandhana spoke openly about what fuels her commitment each day as an India cricketer. “I don’t think there is anything I love more than cricket. Putting on the India jersey is the biggest motivation. No matter what you’re going through, that one thought helps you block everything out,” she said.Even as a child, she knew exactly what she wanted after growing up. “The obsession with batting was always there. People around me didn’t really get it, but in my head I wanted only one thing — to be known as a world champion.”She described the ODI World Cup win as the result of years of hard work and disappointment.“This trophy was the outcome of everything we’ve been fighting for.I’ve played for more than a decade, and so many times things didn’t fall into place. Before the final, we pictured that moment over and over again. When it finally appeared on the screen, it genuinely gave us goosebumps. It was emotional in every way.”The occasion was even more overwhelming with legends Mithali Raj and Jhulan Goswami watching from the stands. “We desperately wanted to win it for them too. Seeing tears in their eyes felt like the whole of women’s cricket had achieved something. It was a victory for everyone who came before us.”Mandhana shared the biggest lessons she carried from the triumph: “You always start from zero, regardless of what you scored previously. And never play for yourself — that’s something we kept telling one another.”This event also marked Mandhana’s first public appearance since she confirmed the cancellation of her wedding with musician Palash Muchhal .",India's ODI World Cup-winning vice-captain Smriti Mandhana spoke at the Amazon Smbhav Summit on Wednesday.

Duo purchased flight tickets on Dec 7, lookout circular issued within 24 hrs

Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, co-owners of 'Birch by Romeo Lane' nightclub in Goa, were detained by Thai police early on Thursday on the request of Indian law enforcement agencies. As their passports were suspended, they became persona non grata in Thailand, prompting the local police to take them into custody, sources said.Sources said that a team of Thai police located them at Hotel Indigo in Patong, Phuket, based on their travel and passport details and seized their belongings and luggage. Their pictures in Phuket police's custody were released on Thursday and showed the duo handcuffed. They were subsequently shifted to the immigration detention centre where they are likely to be lodged till their deportation. The cops are hopeful of the brothers' return to India by the end of this week with formal channels in communication with each other. India and Thailand had signed a formal extradition treaty in 2013, which came into force in 2015.A team has been sent to Phuket to coordinate the deportation, sources said. The brothers have turned 'wanted' after fleeing the country following last week's blaze at their club in Goa that claimed 25 lives. They had fled to Phuket, Thailand and were staying at a hotel.Goa police had requested Interpol, through MEA and CBI, for their apprehension. A blue corner notice was subsequently issued against them by Interpol.The regional passport office in Delhi had issued a notice to the brothers seeking an explanation from both as to why action should not be initiated to impound their passports within seven days. Their passports were subsequently declared invalid, easing the execution of Indian request for their detention.According to Goa police, the brothers purchased seats on a Phuket-bound flight at 1.17 am on Dec 7, even as firefighting operations were under way. By 5.30 am, they were airborne on IndiGo flight 6E-1073.By morning, a Goa police team had reached Delhi with an arrest warrant for the Luthra brothers and searched their residential and office premises, but they were not found. ""Since they were unavailable, a notice under the appropriate sections of law was pasted at their residence. By the evening of Dec 7, a lookout circular was issued against both by the Bureau of Immigration at the request of Goa police,"" a police officer said.The blaze broke out around 11.45pm Saturday (Dec 6) during an event attended by more than 150 tourists. A preliminary investigation by Goa police and Directorate of Fire Services found it was triggered when electric firecrackers struck the wooden ceiling. As flames coursed through the roof, guests and performers bolted. While most of them were able to step out of the club, many were trapped in the basement after the exit caught fire.Besides a partner named Ajay Gupta, five staff members of Birch, chief general manager Rajiv Modak, gate manager Priyanshu Thakur, bar manager Rajveer Singhania, general manager Vivek Singh, and operations manager Bharat Kohli have been arrested till now.","Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, co-owners of 'Birch by Romeo Lane' nightclub in Goa, were detained by Thai police early on Thursday on the request of Indian law enforcement agencies.

Troy Aikman takes shots at Fox

Also Read:

ESPN analyst and former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman has offered his clearest explanation yet for why he left FOX Sports after more than two decades and his comments point directly to leadership at his old network. Speaking on Sports Media with Richard Deitsch , Aikman said the move was less about chasing a bigger platform and more about how communication broke down behind the scenes.Aikman contrasted his experience at FOX with the more corporate, layered structure at ESPN. Calling ESPN “a conglomerate” and “like the U.S. government,” Aikman noted that FOX once felt far more direct and personal.“At Fox, it was really more of a mom-and-pop operation because of David Hill and Ed Gorin,” he said, describing how early network leaders handled decision-making and talent issues personally. Even after leadership changed, he said, executives like Eric Shanks and Brad Zager continued that model - at least initially.But when it came to his own contract situation in 2022, Aikman claimed that communication suddenly evaporated. Despite being one of FOX’s most recognizable faces, he said key executives did not give him clarity about his future.Aikman revealed that he never received a final offer from FOX before his move to ESPN.Instead, he said the network simply congratulated him after news broke that he had signed a new deal.“The reason that I’m no longer at Fox is mostly due to a lack of communication,” Aikman said. “Which is ironic since we’re in the communications business.”Aikman said he specifically asked FOX Sports CEO Eric Shanks about comments he’d heard regarding his contract status, but Shanks declined to address them. According to Aikman, longtime broadcasting partner Joe Buck also raised similar questions, and got the same lack of response.“I never had a conversation with Eric Shanks until he called to congratulate me on the ESPN contract,” Aikman said. “Joe had asked him the same questions… and he refused to answer.”Now ESPN’s lead NFL analyst under a reported $65 million net worth, Aikman says he enjoys the network’s scale and professionalism, even if it’s more “corporate” than FOX. He has also made headlines recently for criticizing college football’s NIL system after a UCLA recruit failed to thank him for a donation, a misunderstanding later attributed to school policy.But regarding his exit from FOX, Aikman remains firm: the issue wasn’t money or opportunity, but communication. And for one of the NFL’s most respected broadcast voices, that was the deal-breaker.","Troy Aikman says he never received a final offer from FOX before his move to ESPN.

'Execute Tomorrow...': Candace Owens Claims Charlie Kirk Sent Alarming Texts Before Assassination

Erika Kirk tells Fox News she wants “one thing” kept private as Candace Owens links message to herself







Candace Owens reacted fast after Erika Kirk went on Fox News and asked people to stop searching for the secret place where her husband Charlie Kirk is buried. Erika Kirk told the public she wanted “one thing” left private for her family. But soon after, Candace Owens posted a video saying Erika Kirk’s words were really pointed at her. Candace Owens said in her new clip, “Super fun show today. You’re probably seeing the clips … it’s about me. It’s indirect, but it’s also about me. And don’t worry, in case you think it’s not about me, she is going to name check me on stage.”This reaction came as many conspiracy theories continue to grow around Charlie Kirk’s assassination. Charlie Kirk was shot and killed on September 10 while giving a speech at Utah Valley University. His body’s location has never been shared. This has only made more people online push strange theories, something Erika Kirk finally addressed on TV.When Erika Kirk sat with host Harris Faulkner on Fox News, she looked tired and upset as she spoke about the rumors. Harris Faulkner asked her, “Talk to me about this part of the conspiracies that are out there.This disturbing part that people are trying to guess where Charlie is.”Erika Kirk answered with strong emotion:“Can I have one thing? Can I have one thing? Can my children have one thing? Everything was public. We will be building the most beautiful memorial for my husband at Turning Point USA… But can I have one thing? Can my babies have one thing where we hold it sacred?”She also said she feared someone might try to damage Charlie’s grave.“Where my husband is laid to rest, where I don’t have to be worried about some secular revolutionary coming and destroying my husband’s grave while my daughter is sitting there praying. One thing. This is my husband.”Soon after Charlie Kirk’s death, Erika Kirk received money from life insurance and public donations.While Erika Kirk asked for privacy, Candace Owens continued to question the official story of Charlie Kirk’s murder. Owens has pushed many unproven ideas, saying the killing was a “hit” and claiming she got secret “military” tips.Also Read: “Some Ignorant Black…”: Nick Fuentes Warns He Will Expose Candace Owens If TPUSA Livestream On Charlie Kirk Fails",Erika Kirk told the public she wanted “one thing” left private for her family.

What we know about Sherrone Moore’s firing





Sherrone Moore’s swift fall from one of college football’s most respected sidelines has stunned the Michigan community. The former Wolverines head coach, once celebrated for guiding the team through high-pressure moments, now faces a storm of allegations and uncertainty. His dismissal came only hours before police in Saline, Michigan confirmed he had been detained, adding another layer of tension to a day already marked by upheaval.The sudden collapse of Moore’s tenure unfolded at a pace that left players, fans and analysts scrambling for clarity. Accusations of an “inappropriate” relationship with a staffer triggered an internal investigation at the university, and the outcome was severe. While officials have not shared the specifics, the decision to terminate him with cause and hand the matter to law enforcement points to a situation far more serious than anyone inside the program expected.The University of Michigan released a series of statements outlining the reasons behind coach Sherrone Moore’s dismissal, though key details remain concealed. “U-M head football coach Sherrone Moore has been terminated, with cause, effective immediately,” the school wrote, adding that “credible evidence was found that Coach Moore engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a staff member.”The university emphasized that “this conduct constitutes a clear violation of University policy, and U-M maintains zero tolerance for such behavior. ”Hours after the firing, the City of Saline Police Department confirmed Moore’s detention. “The City of Saline Police Department assisted in locating and detaining former University of Michigan football coach Sherrone Moore,” the department said. “Mr. Moore was turned over to the Pittsfield Township Police Department for investigation into potential charges.” The nature of the incident that required police action has not been disclosed.With Moore out, Michigan moved quickly to stabilize the program. Veteran assistant and former Charlotte head coach Biff Poggi was appointed interim coach, stepping into the role for the second time this year after previously filling in during Moore’s suspension stemming from the sign-stealing scandal.Moore’s exit closes a chapter that once held enormous promise. Hired in 2018, he climbed through the ranks, helped engineer the team’s championship season in 2023, and made history as Michigan’s first Black full-time head coach. His record stood at 18-8, and he had three years left on a contract worth more than six million dollars for the upcoming season. The firing for cause means the university avoids paying his multi-million-dollar buyout.Michigan now begins its search for a permanent successor at a moment of turmoil, entering an already crowded and fast-moving coaching market with more questions than answers.Also Read: Who is Sherrone Moore’s wife Kell Moore?

Baker Mayfield and Emily Wilkinson’s combined net worth



Baker Mayfield has always lived in that unpredictable space where talent meets turbulence. Every twist in his NFL story has shaped how fans see him today. He has gone from college star to top draft pick, from being praised in Cleveland to bouncing across teams that never seemed ready to commit. Yet this winding path didn’t weaken his name. It strengthened it. It gave him a brand built on grit, confidence, and a willingness to bet on himself.That same willingness carried him through seasons where the stakes felt heavier than the spotlight. From record-breaking rookieman energy to a prove-it season in Tampa Bay worth only $4 million, Mayfield kept pushing until the league was forced to view him differently. His deals eventually reflected his climb, but what truly stands out is how his personal world grew right along with it, shaped largely by the woman who has been with him through every high and low.Money often follows influence, and together, Baker Mayfield and Emily Wilkinson bring both. Mayfield currently plays on a three-year, $100 million contract with the Buccaneers. The deal includes $50 million in total guarantees and $40 million guaranteed at signing with a $28.9 million signing bonus.His annual $33.3 million salary puts him among the highest-earning players in the league. According to reputable outlets such as Celebrity Net Worth, Baker Mayfield’s net worth in 2025 is $50 million.Wilkinson has carved her own place financially as well. Her work across bartending, patient coordination, modeling, and later influencing helped her find a steady lane long before she stepped into the NFL spotlight. Her collaborations, brand promotions, and media presence eventually built a career worth around $1 million. “Emily Wilkinson’s current net worth stands at $1 million approximately,” supported in part by an estimated $300,000 yearly income from partnerships, hair-care advice, brand deals, and work with well-known skincare companies such as Rodan+Fields. the couple's combined networth is at around $52 million.Their financial success is rooted in two very different backstories. Mayfield’s football rise began at Lake Travis High School, where he completed 429 passes for 6,255 yards with 67 touchdowns and eight interceptions. Wilkinson’s path started in Nebraska, followed by a move to Los Angeles where she juggled jobs and discovered who she wanted to be. The marriage they built in 2019 blended those paths into one steady partnership.Today, the couple shares influence that reaches beyond money. They show stability in a world that rarely hands it out freely, reminding fans that behind the touchdowns and brand deals are two people working as one through every season life sends their way.Also Read: Russell Wilson vs Ciara Net Worth: how the Giants QB’s massive career income compares to the Grammy winner’s empire","Baker Mayfield and Emily Wilkinson’s combined net worth is at around $52 million.

Sherrone Moore scandal deepens as disturbing details emerge



Sherrone Moore’s downfall stunned Michigan’s football community long before anyone could make sense of it. The coach who once embodied stability for a powerhouse program found his career collapsing in a single afternoon. Hours after being removed from his post, he was arrested on suspicion of assault, leaving fans and insiders grasping for answers as a troubling series of events came into focus. What had been a season preparing for the Citrus Bowl suddenly shifted into a story that shook college sports.Moore’s fall from grace unfolded at a pace few expected. The University of Michigan dismissed him after evidence surfaced of an affair with his executive assistant, Paige Shiver, and authorities soon accused him of breaking into her apartment with a knife. At just 39, the coach who made history as the school’s first Black head coach is now sitting in a Washtenaw County jail cell, with questions piling up faster than the facts.What followed the firing offered a far darker picture. Reports indicated Moore was “suicidal” when he arrived at Shiver’s apartment, and a 911 caller described a frightening encounter. In the audio, a male voice said, “Male at the location is attacking her … said he’s been stalking her for months.”Police said Moore threatened to hurt himself during the exchange before dropping the knife and running.Shortly after, a dispatcher relayed, “It’s gonna be at the Well Church, 211 Willis Road … suicidal … driving a black Chevy Tahoe blacked out.” Officers tracked him down at the church and arrested him without further incident. Public records show the call came from Shiver’s Ann Arbor address, although authorities have not confirmed her as the victim.Police stressed the situation was not random. Their statement read, “The incident does not appear to be random in nature, and there appears to be no ongoing threat to the community.” Prosecutor Eli Savit confirmed the case is under investigation, noting, “The matter involving Mr. Moore remains under active investigation by law enforcement, and as a result, we do not expect charging decisions or an arraignment today. ”Moore’s personal life had long appeared stable. He married his wife, Kelli, in 2015 and they have three daughters. Yet insiders now say he had “been acting strange, berating assistant coaches,” a shift that hinted something was unraveling behind the scenes.Author and Michigan instructor John Bacon added new weight to the allegations, saying Moore “broke into an employee’s home in Pittsfield Township … grabbed a knife, and threatened to harm her and harm himself.” He also claimed Moore is currently in protective custody and “surrounded by mental health professionals.”As the investigation continues, Michigan football is left grappling with the swift, stunning fall of a coach once seen as its future.Also Read: ""Sore ladies out there"": Sherrone Moore’s old post about women resurfaces after his firing and arrest over inappropriate relationship with Paige Shiver","Sherrone Moore was fired by the University of Michigan after an affair with his assistant.

Why online rumors about Paige Shiver pregnancy spread during the Sherrone Moore scandal and what is actually confirmed

The Sherrone Moore scandal has turned Michigan football upside down in less than twenty four hours. The university fired Moore for cause after an internal investigation found he engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. Hours later, police detained him in Saline and transferred him to Pittsfield Township for investigation into potential charges. The Sherrone Moore scandal has now shifted from a personnel crisis to a legal storyline that is still developing.New updates indicate that Sherrone Moore will appear in court on Thursday afternoon, less than a day after his firing and sudden arrest near Michigan Stadium. Records show he is still being held in the Washtenaw County Jail, though officials have not released why he was detained or whether bond has been set.The fallout has pulled his wife, Kelli Moore, into public conversation, pushed an unnamed staffer into rampant online speculation, and forced Michigan to hand the program to interim head coach Biff Poggi while the fanbase tries to make sense of the timing, the investigation, and the sudden law enforcement involvement.Michigan athletic director Warde Manuel announced that Moore had been terminated immediately.Manuel said the university found “credible evidence” that the head coach engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. The findings constituted a violation of university policy, which allowed Michigan to remove him for cause.Moore, 39, had only been in the role for two seasons after replacing Jim Harbaugh. He posted an 18 8 record and finished the 2025 regular season 9 3. His tenure had already included previous suspensions, including discipline connected to the Connor Stalions sign stealing investigation and a COVID recruiting rules violation in 2023.The Sherrone Moore scandal intensified Wednesday night when ESPN reporter Dan Wetzel posted that Saline police located and detained Moore. Wetzel wrote that officers “assisted in locating and detaining” the coach before turning him over to Pittsfield Township authorities for further investigation. Law enforcement has not confirmed whether this detention is directly tied to the conduct that led to his firing, but the timing pushed the story into a new phase.Michigan quickly elevated Biff Poggi to interim head coach. Poggi previously filled the role during Moore’s earlier suspension this season. The program must now stabilize itself with a bowl game approaching and a full coaching search looming.The Sherrone Moore scandal drove a spike in searches for “Sherrone Moore wife” and “is Sherrone Moore married.” His wife, Kelli Moore, has stayed mostly private throughout their ten year marriage. She describes herself on her profile as a “Jesus follower, Coach Moore’s wife, mom, and LGBTQ+ ally.” She is also a former college goalkeeper who played at Centre College in Kentucky. The couple has three daughters, which increased public attention as questions about the coach’s conduct took over the news cycle.The university has not identified the staff member involved in the investigation. That gap created space for speculation, and one name surfaced repeatedly online: executive assistant Paige Shiver. No verified report has named her as the staffer. The attention began after users noted that her social profiles went private or inactive as the story unfolded. Larry Brown Sports previously reported that she served as Moore’s executive assistant after beginning as an on campus recruiting staffer. Her father, Jeff Shiver, is a longtime Chicago Bears scout. None of these details confirm any connection to the misconduct, but the pattern of online speculation made her part of the conversation.The Sherrone Moore scandal continues to ripple through the program because no one outside the university’s investigation has a full picture of the timeline. Michigan confirmed only one fact. Moore engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. Everything else, including the extent of the conduct and the role of law enforcement, remains undisclosed.The Sherrone Moore scandal took another chaotic turn after rumors about Paige Shiver's pregnancy began trending on social media. Shiver, who served as Moore’s executive assistant, was never named in Michigan’s official statement, nor have police identified her in connection with any ongoing investigation. However, following Moore’s firing and police detention, several viral posts, claimed she was pregnant. None of these claims have been confirmed.The rumors gained traction after users noticed her social accounts going private and circulated screenshots that alleged a personal relationship with Moore. Some users also pointed to a wedding ring visible in older photos of Shiver, but again, no credible source has provided verification. As of now, the university, Moore, and Shiver have not publicly addressed any pregnancy claim, and it remains unsubstantiated internet speculation.Everything confirmed by the university is unchanged. Michigan stated that Sherrone Moore had an inappropriate relationship with a staff member, but it has not identified who that staff member is. The online theory that it was Paige Shiver or that a pregnancy played any role has no verified evidence behind it.","The Sherrone Moore scandal spiraled fast. Michigan fired him for cause over an inappropriate relationship, and police detained him hours later. The program is in chaos, his family is under scrutiny, and the investigation is still active. The fallout has pulled his wife, Kelli Moore, into public conversation, pushed an unnamed staffer into rampant online speculation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125904956,imgsize-49846,width-400,resizemode-4/sherrone-moore-scandal-michigan-coach-detained-fired-investigation.jpg"

Tom Brady doesn't want Michigan stars leaving amid Sherrone Moore fallout



Tom Brady’s voice carries weight in any football conversation, but it hits differently when the University of Michigan is involved. As the school faces a storm of uncertainty after the arrest of former head coach Sherrone Moore, the program’s identity has been shaken. In the middle of this tension, Brady stepped forward, not as an NFL legend, but as an alumnus trying to steady a team at risk of falling apart. His words arrived at a moment when rival programs were circling, eager to lure away the Wolverines’ top talent.What could have been a quiet recruitment battle quickly turned into a public tug-of-war. With fans confused, players uneasy and critics loud, Brady pushed for unity. His stance was not about looking back at Michigan’s past, but about protecting the athletes who must carry the school forward during its most fragile moment.The arrest of Sherrone Moore created a wave of reactions inside and outside Ann Arbor. Reports about an alleged “inappropriate relationship” placed the entire program under a harsh spotlight as the City of Saline Police Department confirmed it had detained Moore after investigators found “credible” evidence. Pittsfield Township Police later added that an “alleged assault” had been reported and that the suspect was held at Washtenaw County Jail pending charges.The investigation remains open, and the distractions continue.Amid this turmoil, the spotlight shifted to Michigan’s prized quarterbacks, especially Bryce Underwood. Rivals did not waste a second. Former LSU star Tyrann Mathieu jumped in publicly, urging Underwood to consider a fresh start in Louisiana. On X, he wrote: “Come home son @BryceUnderwoo16. We are waiting & will accept you with open arms. FOREVER LSU.”Brady was watching, and he refused to let the pitch go unchallenged. Commenting under Sports Illustrated’s post about Mathieu’s message, Brady fired back with clarity and purpose. “He's a wolverine !!! And gonna get back to work and lead us next year!!! LFG.”Fans reacted in every direction, with some calling for Brady to coach the team himself, while others mocked the timing. But beneath the noise, his point was simple. Michigan cannot afford to lose its foundation while navigating a crisis. Stability matters. Loyalty matters. And to Brady, the Wolverines’ future leaders should stay right where they are.If Michigan is going to rebuild its footing, it will need players who choose commitment over chaos. Brady made sure Underwood, and everyone watching, heard that message loud and clear.Also Read: Fired Michigan coach Sherrone Moore reportedly felt “suicidal” after police responded to tense visit at assistant’s apartment","Tom Brady doesn't want Michigan stars leaving amid Sherrone Moore fallout.

Meet Kelli Moore: Everything to know about Sherrone Moore’s wife after his shocking firing





Unexpected news has shocked University of Michigan football. Sherrone Moore, the Wolverines' head coach for just two seasons, was fired after it was alleged that he had a ""inappropriate relationship with a staff member. "" Fans, players, and the larger college football community were all taken aback by the December 2025 announcement. Athletic Director Warde Manuel confirmed the decision, stating, “U-M head football coach Sherrone Moore has been terminated, with cause, effective immediately. Following a University investigation, credible evidence was found that Coach Moore engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. This conduct constitutes a clear violation of University policy, and U-M maintains zero tolerance for such behavior.”Moore’s departure has also turned attention toward his personal life, particularly his wife, Kelli Moore. Married since 2015, the couple has long maintained a balance between the high-pressure world of college football and a private family life. Kelli has mainly avoided the spotlight despite Sherrone's prominence in the sports world, giving their three daughters: Shiloh, Solei, and Sadie--a consistent presence.Curiosity about Kelli and her place in the Moore family has grown since the scandal has taken center stage in the media.Kelli Moore has quietly stood beside her husband through years of demanding seasons and public scrutiny. She and Sherrone Moore tied the knot in July 2015 after he proposed in December 2014. Reflecting on their early years together, Sherrone shared a heartfelt tribute in 2018 on Instagram: “Happy three year anniversary to my life partner and best friend. So proud of you and all your accomplishments. I am so happy and blessed beyond measure to call you my wife as the man upstairs leads us to live through him. Love you soo much and excited about what the future holds for us! #skforevermoore #bestfriends #Lifegoalsmeet.”The couple shares three daughters: Shiloh, born in 2019; Solei, born in 2022; and Sadie, whose birthdate has not been publicly shared. Kelli has been a familiar figure at games, whether supporting Sherrone during his time with the Central Michigan Chippewas or cheering from the sidelines and stands at the University of Michigan. While she avoids social media limelight, friends describe her as devout, family-oriented, and deeply committed to raising their children in a values-driven home.The Moore family is currently under intense scrutiny. Sherrone's dismissal has caused a stir in college football, bringing Kelli's personal life into the spotlight. She must manage the fallout from her husband's career-altering controversy while providing stability for their young daughters as the couple nears their tenth wedding anniversary. Although the specifics of the alleged improper relationship are still unknown, Michigan has reaffirmed its zero-tolerance policy. For Kelli Moore, this time represents an unanticipated and difficult phase in a life she has carefully avoided media attention.Also Read: Why Sherrone Moore ended up in police custody amid Michigan firing him for alleged ‘inappropriate relationship’ scandal","Sherryrone Moore was fired by the University of Michigan.

On December 10, Jon Rhoades of The Big Ten Huddle shared a swirl of rumors, much of it traced back to Justin Spiro (Host of “The Spiro Avenue Show”), who first broke news about former head coach Sherrone Moore. Spiro had been hinting since mid-August, even before the season began, that Moore could face serious trouble or even be fired by the University of Michigan. After the Ohio State game, Spiro predicted Moore’s dismissal could come within a week or as late as two months.The heart of the rumor is that Moore was fired due to an alleged relationship with Paige Shiver, his executive assistant, who was promoted when Moore took over for Jim Harbaugh. Now, the latest twist claims Shiver is pregnant and that Moore is confirmed as the father. Paige Shiver’s news has sent shock waves through cyberspace. But Shiver’s ties to football run deeper than college sidelines. She is the daughter of Jeff Shiver, a respected NFL scout. To understand her father’s story, let’s revisit Dan Pompei’s 2019 biographical interview in The Athletic.On a spring day in 1987, Jeff Shiver was flipping a hamburger in his Lafayette, Indiana, kitchen when the phone rang with a call that would change his life.Bill Tobin, the Chicago Bears’ personnel chief, was on the line, offering Shiver a chance to join the NFL’s scouting ranks. At the time, Shiver was earning $18,000 a year as a BLESTO scout, but Tobin’s offer of $25,000 felt like striking gold. Shiver eagerly accepted, feeling as if he had just won the lottery.As they sealed the deal with a handshake, Tobin promised, “You’re going to be with the Bears a long time.” More than three decades later, Shiver is still a fixture in Chicago, outlasting every other personnel man in the team’s hundred-year history. Only Scott DiStefano has served (five years) longer as a continuously employed NFL scout for the Denver Broncos. From fullback Brad Muster in 1988 to running back David Montgomery in 2019, Shiver has played a role in every Bears draft pick.“Jeff worked out even better than I thought,” Tobin said via The Athletic in 2019. “He’s a wonderful person and damn good scout. He’s been a giant in the scouting industry.”“I think the world of him,” said former Bears general manager Jerry Angelo. “I don’t know of anybody more respected and or revered in the scouting business than Jeff. I saw it from afar when I was with other teams, and I saw it firsthand when I got to Chicago. Whatever he says, you can take it to the bank.”Shiver credits his impeccable endurance to his faith and to Laura, his wife of 34 years (at the time of the 2019 The Athletic interview, now they’ve been together for roughly 40 long years). “It’s a hard job,” Shiver said. “To be able to do it begins with a great wife. Not once did I walk in the front door and hear her complain about me not being there.”Laura’s patience is all the more monumental given that Shiver spends up to 275 nights a year away from home, crisscrossing the country in his Ford Edge and tallying about 30,000 miles annually. Life on the road has brought him moments of pure bliss, like hearing, “Honey, I think I’m pregnant,” and heartache, like learning, “Your brother-in-law was in a car accident, and he didn’t make it.” His fondest travel memories are the late-night phone calls from his young children, Brittany, John, Paige, and Nicole, soft voices asking, “Dad, when are you coming home?”The former Bears general manager, Ryan Pace, told The Athletic in 2019 that Shiver’s experience on the staff is invaluable. Think about the relationships he’s built and the resources he has. He can call people and get information that a younger scout can’t. He also has a mental library of players.In a draft meeting, he’ll quickly point out when one player reminds him of another and explain why. Sometimes, he’ll mention players from way back that nobody else remembers. David Montgomery reminds Shiver a bit of Matt Forte. He does a great job of describing players. He has a million one-liners that make everyone laugh. He brings passion and energy while keeping things fun.Rod Graves, the former Bears personnel director, told The Athletic in 2019 that he always relied on Jeff for core evaluation. He would be shocked if Ryan (Pace) and those who followed did not lean on Jeff in the same way. Shiver was the definition of dependability, an astute evaluator, and someone Graves trusted without a doubt. Few people ranked higher on his list, both as friends and as professionals. Graves has only praise for Shiver and says with complete honesty that he loves the man.Dan Pompei of The Athletic revealed in 2019 that one of the earliest and most profound lessons Shiver absorbed as an NFL scout was to appreciate everyone he encountered, not just those with influence or something to offer. He made it a point to value the everyday people: the gas station attendant, the custodian, the security guard. Shiver’s philosophy was simple: the mission never outweighs the people you meet along the way: “The mission never is greater than the people you come in contact with. ”Pompei also painted a picture of Shiver’s upbringing, shaped by his late parents, John and Myrtle. Jeff inherited his strong work ethic from his father, who spent over 80 years as an auto mechanic at Shiver’s Auto Service, often working twelve-hour days, six days a week. During World War II, John served as a flight engineer and gunner in the Army Air Corps. Meanwhile, Myrtle managed the books and cared for Jeff and his two sisters.Talking to Pompei in 2019, Jeff said he still feels his mother’s love when he bakes her Sour Cream Pound Cake. And when the call came that brought him to the Bears’ front office, he was in the middle of cooking a hamburger. Distracted by the life-changing news, he burned it, but as he told Pompei, it was still the best burger he ever tasted: “By far, the best burger I ever tasted.”Jeff Shiver currently serves as Executive Scout for the Chicago Bears. Since 1987, Shiver has been a staunch presence with the Bears. His decades of commitment were commemorated in February 2020, when he received the first-ever C.O. Brocato Award for Distinguished Service to Scouting. This prestigious honor pays tribute to a legendary scout who dedicated four decades to the Houston Oilers, now known as the Tennessee Titans, and inspired countless others in the profession.","Jeff Shiver has been with the Chicago Bears since 1987.

When someone truly relishes their sport on every level, staying in the game for the long haul feels natural. But for those who lose that “fun” aspect, stepping away becomes a way to protect their well-being. This crossroads may be where Cincinnati Bengals star quarterback Joe Burrow now stands. At a recent press conference, the 29-year-old signal caller revealed that while his toe injury did not dull his competitive drive, it did prompt a deep shift in his outlook.For Burrow, joy is essential to endure the mental and physical grind. To keep thriving in his demanding career, he must find genuine enjoyment in the journey. Without that sense of fun, he wonders what the point is. His enigmatic words, which rippled with hints of early retirement, were: “If I wanna keep doing this, I have to have fun doing it… I’ve been through a lot… If it’s not fun, then what am I doing it for?”Burrow stunned fans by returning from a Grade 3 toe turf injury two months ahead of the recovery timeline, defying the odds and expectations. He stormed back onto the gridiron on Thanksgiving Day, leading his team to an effortless 32-14 victory over the Baltimore Ravens, fueled by sheer determination. Yet, the celebration was short-lived as the Buffalo Bills edged them out in a suspenseful thriller, 39-34. Now, with playoff hopes on thin ice and only a 1-3% chance of advancing, the future looks grim for the Bengals.The devastating Week 14 defeat to the Bills dropped their regular season record to 4-9, leaving them third in the AFC North and 12th in the conference.With so many setbacks, it’s easy to imagine Burrow questioning his path forward, perhaps explaining his mysterious hint at early retirement at his recent press conference.“How did the injury change the way you view the game?”“No, it certainly doesn’t change my desire to win. If I wanna keep doing this, I have to have fun doing it… I’ve been through a lot… If it’s not fun, then what am I doing it for? That’s the mindset I’m trying to bring to the table.”“Is it difficult to have fun given the season, what you’ve been through physically, emotionally, all of it? Is it tough?”“Yeah, certainly.”“How much of it was fun before? Winning is always fun, but in general, was it fun before you got hurt? Did you view it that way at least?”“No, I wouldn’t say I viewed it that way.”“What was the changing point?”“I’m not sure if there’s a singular moment or a time. It’s just a reflection on a lot of things that I’ve done and been through in my career. I’ve been through more than most and certainly not easy on the brain or the body, so just trying to have fun doing it.”","Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow hints at early retirement.

Subriel Matias proven innocent as the B-sample confirms ostarine levels under permissible limits



Subriel Matias will still defend his WBC super lightweight title against Dalton Smith on January 10, even after testing positive for Ostarine. The fight was first announced earlier this year and was scheduled to take place at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. But everything changed when Matias returned a positive VADA test on November 9. Notably, Ostarine is a banned substance known for increasing testosterone levels and boosting endurance. It was the same drug found in Ryan Garcia’s system that earned him a one-year suspension. Yet Matias’ case took a very different turn.Despite the positive result, he was not suspended. Reports now say his B-sample has also come back positive. Still, he is safe to compete. Boxing journalist Dan Rafael reported the update on X and confirmed that the levels found were below the punishment threshold in New York. With the fight staying on the schedule, Matias is now set to move forward with his title defense against the unbeaten star Dalton Smith.Subriel Matias’ drug test case became a major talking point in boxing, especially because most fighters must prove their innocence even when contamination is suspected.Dan Rafael revealed the latest update earlier today. He wrote on X, “Per multiple sources with direct knowledge of the test results, Subriel Matias’ B sample was also positive for Ostarine,” he posted. “But was, as expected & how it should be, the same as his A below the 0.1 ng per milliliter threshold for punishment in NY, so [the] Smith fight remains on.”Earlier reports noted that Matias would be placed on a one-year probation and must pay for additional testing before fight night. The WBC had already backed him before the B-sample was tested. WBC President Mauricio Sulaiman said they believed the result came from contaminated supplements used during training.“He is not guilty; he has not been found at any level of consuming performance-enhancing drugs,” Sulaiman had stated.Sulaiman also said their Clean Boxing Program needs updating because many supplements contain banned traces.Meanwhile, the pre-weigh-in numbers for the fight are also confirmed. Matias came in at 153.8 pounds, while Smith weighed 155.6 pounds.Both fighters will now gear up for the ultimate fight. Despite setbacks, the road is now clear for Matias to defend his world title on January 10.Also Read: “You turned gay"" - UFC legend Nate Diaz brutally trolls Ryan Garcia for wanting to train under Khabib Nurmagomedov",Subriel Matias tested positive for Ostarine on November 9.

A long-term commitment to giving back

Also Read:

Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes is no stranger to headlines, but this time the spotlight has shifted off the field. The three-time Super Bowl champion is earning widespread praise after his foundation helped generate more than $3.2 million in community impact, a milestone that has drawn admiration from fans, nonprofit leaders and even his wife, Brittany Mahomes.The figure was highlighted by the Youth Volunteer Corps, which announced that young volunteers inspired by Mahomes completed 92,714 hours of service, translating to millions of dollars’ worth of support for local communities. Brittany Mahomes acknowledged the achievement on Instagram, liking the post celebrating the foundation’s work and the volunteers driving it.Founded in 2019, the 15 and the Mahomies Foundation has grown into one of the NFL’s most active philanthropic programs. Its efforts include three main pillars: Read for 15, Volunteer for 15 and 15 for 15, each designed to support education, leadership and youth development across Kansas City.For many young participants, Mahomes is more than a sporting icon. One volunteer, Luke from Hampton, explained that the quarterback’s commitment to service inspires him to do more. “Patrick Mahomes has inspired me to volunteer because of the way he uses his platform to give back,” he said, adding that Mahomes’ leadership reflects a belief that success carries a responsibility to help others.The foundation has scaled its impact steadily. In October, Mahomes and Brittany helped raise $1.5 million at the sixth-annual gala, attended by more than 900 supporters. That event funded 27 Kansas City charities focused on everything from education to health services.Mahomes’ community work has also extended into the holiday calendar. While the Chiefs faced pressure during their Thanksgiving game against the Cowboys, the quarterback made sure that families back home were supported. His foundation partnered with Shelter KC to provide over 300 food bags as part of its annual Family Feast initiative.Shelter KC praised the partnership, calling it an essential effort during one of the busiest periods for community support organizations. Mahomes’ involvement, they added, continues to set a standard for active player engagement in local issues.While Kansas City navigates a challenging 6-7 season and sits on the brink of playoff elimination, Mahomes’ reputation as a community leader remains unaffected. Analysts have questioned the Chiefs’ dynasty and the sustainability of their current roster, but few dispute Mahomes’ influence beyond football.As the postseason outlook grows narrower, his growing role as a humanitarian has only strengthened his standing among teammates and supporters. With Brittany by his side and the foundation expanding each year, Mahomes is shaping a legacy that reaches far beyond touchdowns and trophies.In a season defined by adversity, his $3.2 million community impact may be the clearest reminder of what leadership looks like, even when the scoreboard goes the other way.","Patrick Mahomes' foundation has generated more than $3.2 million in community impact.

What Gronkowski actually said about returning to the NFL

“I’d need a solid bonus, and the schedule has to work with my life,”

Rob Gronkowski, one of the NFL ’s most electrifying tight ends, just gave fans the ultimate tease. While he’s been retired for a few years, Gronk floated a playful idea of how to lure him back to the field. At 36, Gronk isn’t committing to a return but his humor, charm, and legendary status make this “what if” scenario irresistible for NFL fans everywhere.During a recent interview, Gronkowski shared the very specific conditions under which he might consider unretiring. He joked that he would only practice Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, and that a $1 million bonus would be essential to make the deal worthwhile. True to his playful personality, Gronk also estimated the chance of this happening at just 1 percent, signaling that this is more a fun thought experiment than a real plan.Gronk said, keeping fans guessing but entertained. While he’s clearly not rushing back, the scenario alone sparked excitement across social media.Naturally, the internet went wild. Imagining Gronk in full gear on a practice squad kept fans joking about him only showing up for three days a week, reactions were instant. Some users celebrated the idea of his infectious energy returning to NFL practices, while others pointed out that Gronk’s legendary partying and personality might clash with a structured team schedule.Even those who doubt a real comeback are enjoying the fantasy of seeing him back in action. After all, few players have been as fun and memorable on and off the field as Gronk.Despite the buzz, a return seems extremely improbable. At 36 years old and after multiple seasons of retirement, Gronk would face physical challenges and lifestyle adjustments. No NFL team has officially expressed interest, and his playful terms, limited practice days and a hefty bonus aren’t typical for active roster spots.History does show that players sometimes stage surprising comebacks (think Brett Favre or Michael Jordan ), but Gronk’s scenario remains more of a fan fantasy than a likely reality.Even as a joke, Gronkowski’s hypothetical return illustrates his lasting influence on both football and pop culture. His larger-than-life personality, marketing appeal, and connection with fans keep him relevant long after his retirement. Whether on the field or in the media, Gronk is a figure who can make headlines with just a tease.Also read - Sherrone Moore’s firing triggers Shannon Sharpe’s reflection on his own lawsuit involving an OnlyFans model","Rob Gronkowski, one of the NFL’s most electrifying tight ends, just gave fans the ultimate tease.

Charlie Kirk’s Widow Delivers Emotional Message To People Mocking His Death

Erika Kirk frames the narrative around faith, fear, and truth while dismantling claims about Charlie's final messages







A new wave of controversy has erupted online after Graham Allen shared a clip of Erika Kirk directly refuting Candace Owens’ widely circulated claim about her late husband, Charlie Kirk . Owens had suggested that Charlie spent his final hours texting people that he was going to die, an allegation Erika swiftly and firmly rejected.As the conversation spreads across political circles and social media, Erika’s response is offering the first deeply personal insight into what she and Charlie were actually facing behind the scenes, and why she believes this narrative is not only false but damaging. Her clarity, shaped by grief, faith, and firsthand experience, has shifted the tone of the conversation entirely.In the emotional conversation shared by Allen, Erika responds to a question that many followers had quietly wondered: Did Charlie have any sense that danger was coming? Her answer was layered, honest, and rooted in the reality of living under constant threats.“Do you think Charlie knew to some degree and had made the conscious choice that I may be taken out early… that he had any inkling that this might come his way?” she was asked. Erika acknowledged that the danger was never theoretical for them. “I still, I have unbelievable amounts of death threats. My kids have kidnapping threats, death threats. Our whole team has death threats.”She explained that she and Charlie accepted the risks of their work but made a pact: “We promised each other we would never live in fear.And he would say, if they're going to get me…” That resolve, she said, shaped how they navigated every tour, every speech, every hostile message.But Erika drew a sharp line between accepting danger and predicting death. “He was not messaging people the day before saying, I'm going to be murdered… someone’s going to kill me. He didn’t say that. And I had his cell phone, didn’t say that.”Instead, she said, their final night together sounded achingly ordinary for a couple used to traveling and working under pressure: prayer, gratitude, and surrender to God’s will. “We believe in the power of prayer… and that night before, we did what we usually did… we said our prayer and we asked the Lord to protect us… and that his will be done.”Erika’s calm but decisive rebuttal reframes the narrative: not as a conspiracy, but as a story of faith, danger, and devotion, without sensationalism.Also Read: “She is jealous Charlie married Erika instead of her”: Laura Loomer blasts Candace Owens for attacking Erika Kirk","Erika Kirk has publicly refuted Candace Owens' claim that her late husband, Charlie Kirk, predicted his death in his final texts.

Tim Pool says these people told him that Candace Owens said she “hated” Charlie Kirk before he was killed in September. Pool says he even has their names, but they are afraid to talk. He says, “These people are scared to speak out, because they fear that Candace will do things like put them on a thumbnail that says who benefited from Charlie Kirk’s death, like she did to me.”Tim Pool also says these people fear they will face hate, lies, and harassment online. He says, “They fear that they will get, people will start harassing them, make up lies about them, which is happening to us here at TimCast.” Pool even said they worry some “psychotic retard” follower of Owens might harm them.Tim Pool’s video has generated massive views, as many users reacted to his claims. Some agreed with him and said they also felt worried about the online fight around Charlie Kirk’s death.Candace Owens has talked many times about the case since Charlie Kirk was killed three months ago. She repeated different theories on her podcast, including talk about an underground tunnel and a problem with Kirk’s security.Owens also said she believes the killing was an “inside job” at TPUSA.On the other hand, Erika Kirk, Charlie Kirk’s wife, asked the public to stop spreading theories. She said on Outnumbered, “My silence does not mean that somehow Turning Point USA and all of the handpicked staff that loved my husband… are somehow in on it. We are busy building.”Erika Kirk did not name Candace Owens, but Owens reacted and said the comment was “about me.” Owens said, “It’s indirect, but it’s also about me… she is going to name-check me on stage.”Erika Kirk also shared that her team has received kidnapping and death threats since Charlie was killed.

Charlie Kirk’s Widow Delivers Emotional Message To People Mocking His Death

Candace Owens says Erika Kirk shared private moments before, so the new request feels confusing





The fight between Erika Kirk, the widow of Charlie Kirk, and her friend and former TPUSA director Candace Owens is getting stronger. It started again after Erika made one simple request during her interview with Harris Faulkner on Fox News’ Outnumbered on 10 December. She asked everyone to keep Charlie’s grave private. Erika said she did not want to “be worried about some secular revolutionary coming and destroying my husband’s grave.” This came as many people online were making strange claims about Charlie’s death and even asking where he was buried.Candace Owens later spoke about this on her podcast Candace. She said she understood Erika’s fear, but she also said she disagreed with how Erika wanted privacy only in this one part. Candace called it “Meghan Markle Syndrome,” saying, “You want privacy when you want it, but you want publicity whenever you want it, and that just doesn’t work.”After Charlie Kirk was killed in September, people began spreading rumors online. Some even claimed Charlie was still alive because no burial details were shared. Erika tried to stop these rumors by asking for privacy. But Candace Owens said Erika could not choose what to show and what to hide.Candace said, “I objectively agree with Erika because funerals are a very private matter. But I subjectively disagree because of what transpired following Charlie’s assassination.” She used a story from Bethenny Frankel on The Real Housewives of New York to explain that someone cannot show only the good parts of life and hide the bad parts later.Candace Owens also talked about Erika Kirk’s earlier video where she cried over Charlie’s body in the casket. Erika kissed his hands and said, “I love you,” many times. Candace called this “an incredibly personal and incredibly intimate moment,” but noted that Erika still shared it online. So Candace asked why the burial must now stay secret, saying, “It doesn’t work like that. You have to make a decision.”Candace Owens has also said on her podcast that TPUSA is hiding details about Charlie’s death, which has added more heat to the argument.Also Read: “It’s About Me”: Candace Owens Fires Back Hard As Erika Kirk Asks The Public To End Charlie Kirk Conspiracy Stories","Candace Owens says Erika Kirk shared private moments before, so the new request feels confusing.

Philip Rivers comeback reaction from Aaron Rodgers



The NFL woke up this week to something few expected to see again. Philip Rivers, freshly 44 and four seasons removed from his last snap, suddenly appeared back in the Indianapolis Colts building. The news moved fast, and it stirred reactions that ranged from shock to pure delight. Among those caught off guard was Mike Tomlin, who kept his focus locked on the Miami Dolphins. He brushed off any deeper discussion with a simple line. “That’s none of my business. I’m trying to be ready for the Dolphins.” Aaron Rodgers , however, welcomed the topic with a smile. The Steelers quarterback, who celebrated his 42nd birthday earlier this month, treated the moment with humor. “Well, I’m not the oldest guy in the league. Love that,” he said, clearly amused by Rivers’ return. It became one of the lighter moments in a tense playoff stretch.Rodgers did not stop at jokes. He laid out what made Rivers’ return so astonishing. “It’s pretty incredible though. He’s been out for I believe four full seasons, plus part of this season,” Rodgers said. He added that his friends immediately asked what he would do in the same situation.His answer was honest and quick. “I said, without missing a beat, ‘I’m retired. I’m staying retired.’”For Rodgers, the respect runs deep. He praised Rivers in a way that felt personal. “Big credit to Phil. I’ve been a fan of his forever,” he said. Rodgers admired the way Rivers competed and carried himself, calling him “not the most gifted player” but “cerebral as all get out.” He also pointed out what fans always loved about Rivers, describing him as a “hilarious trash talker,” and ended by wishing him “nothing but the best. ”Rivers now joins a very small group of active players aged 40 or older, which includes Rodgers, Marcades Lewis, Matt Prater, Nick Folk and Joe Flacco. If Rivers starts this week, he will line up against the Seattle Seahawks, an almost surreal twist after years away from the huddle.Meanwhile, Rodgers continues to show he can guide Pittsburgh through pressure moments. His recent performance in the Steelers’ 27-22 win over the Ravens included his first rushing touchdown in three years. He even brought back the discount double check celebration, a reminder that he can still find joy in the grind.With a one game AFC North lead and Miami up next, Rodgers is focused on the present. Rivers, returning to help the Colts, is stepping right back into a league that never stops moving. Both stories collide in a season where every week seems to create another headline worth watching.Also Read: ""Slap in my face"": Cam Newton vents frustration as Colts turn to 44-year-old Philip Rivers","Philip Rivers returned to the NFL this week, four seasons after his last snap.

Suryakumar Yadav Press Conference: on Sanju, Dube & India’s T20 Gameplan for South Africa

#arshdeepsingh #viratkohli #indiancricket

NEW DELHI: India pacer Arshdeep Singh has emerged as much a digital entertainer as a match-winning bowler — and now he has revealed the surprising moment that pushed him into creating his wildly popular YouTube content. Speaking on JioHotstar, the left-arm quick said the idea struck him during one of the most frustrating phases of his career: when he was dropped from India's Playing XI for the opening match of the Champions Trophy 2025 in Dubai.India had opted for a spin-heavy combination throughout the tournament, leaving Arshdeep on the bench. But instead of sulking, he turned the setback into an opportunity. “When I got to know that I wouldn't be playing in the first game of the Champions Trophy, I was very bored in my room — and that's when I started my YouTube channel. It turned out to be a blessing in disguise,” he said.Arshdeep explained that he tries to find positivity even in disappointment. “Sometimes you just have to be grateful that you are playing at this level. You also have to wait for your chances, and when you get an opportunity, make sure you make the most of it,” he added.His fun, self-deprecating humour quickly resonated with fans, none more so than his recent viral reel with Virat Kohli, which has already crossed 1.3 million views. The banter came after Kohli missed a third straight ODI century in the series decider against South Africa in Visakhapatnam, where he finished unbeaten on 65 as India chased 271 with ease.Arshdeep, sensing content gold, joked to Kohli: “Paaji, run kam reh gaye… century aaj pakki thi waise.”Kohli's response was instant and hilarious: “Toss jeet gaye, nahi toh teri bhi pakki thi dew mein.”With India's bowlers having struggled under heavy dew in the earlier games in Ranchi and Raipur, Kohli's quip left the all in splits — and gave Arshdeep yet another viral moment.",India pacer Arshdeep Singh has revealed the moment that pushed him into creating his wildly popular YouTube content.

Duo purchased flight tickets on Dec 7, lookout circular issued within 24 hrs

GOA: Trouble seems to be mounting for Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, co-owners of the ‘Birch by Romeo Lane’ nightclub in Goa, who were detained by Thai police early on Thursday, as they are likely to undergo corporate scrutiny after probe agencies discovered that the brothers’ north Delhi office address (2590, Ground Floor, Hudson Lane) was also used for multiple companies and Limited Liability Partnerships.According to documents and GST details, brothers are linked with 42 firms, some of which are suspected to be shell entities.The findings have been communicated to agencies concerned for actions, sources said.This pattern of multiple entities sharing a single address and directors is a classic indication of corporate layering & potential money laundering,"" a sleuth said.A team has been sent to Phuket to coordinate the deportation, sources said.

Flames were seen rising from the garbage mound in the early hours of Wednesday, prompting hospital staff and authorities to take immediate action, and they doused the fire.In the morning, passersby noticed what appeared to be the burned remains of infants amid the charred waste.

She joked “everyone has been so rude” after learning engagement etiquette and then revealed why her proposal from Travis Kelce still feels unreal. (Images via Getty)

Taylor Swift’s etiquette reaction on Colbert becomes the moment everyone is replaying

Taylor Swift explains why the Travis Kelce engagement still feels unreal despite public obsession

Taylor Swift’s engagement to Travis Kelce has been dissected for over a year, but the most unexpected moment finally arrived on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.” Taylor Swift spoke openly about how unreal the Travis Kelce engagement still feels to her and then delivered the line that instantly took over social media: “Everyone has been so rude. ” What was meant to be a quick etiquette correction became the internet’s favorite clip.This appearance was part of Taylor Swift’s promo push for her Eras Tour docuseries. Instead, she ended up walking viewers into a rare look at why getting engaged to Travis Kelce still feels impossible to her, why she never assumed it would happen and why this year changed the trajectory of her life and career.Taylor Swift was listing three people she trusts most when Stephen Colbert stepped in to congratulate her on the Travis Kelce engagement. He then paused and corrected himself, reminding her of an etiquette rule she had never heard.He told Taylor Swift that tradition requires “best wishes” for the bride and “congratulations” for the groom. She stared at him and answered with the line that exploded online: “I never heard that until right now. Everyone has been so rude.”Stephen Colbert explained the reasoning. The man gets congratulations for securing the relationship.The woman gets best wishes because marriage was assumed. Taylor Swift processed the logic and said she loved learning something so oddly specific. She even told him she would come to him for wedding advice, and she meant it.Stephen Colbert highlighted her viral Instagram announcement next. He read her caption out loud, pointed to the framed photo on his desk and called the post a fan favorite. The moment also reminded viewers of how massive this year has been for her. Taylor Swift dropped a new album, “The Life of a Showgirl,” released a docuseries and regained her masters. She agreed with Stephen Colbert when he said she had a “good year. ” She knew exactly what he meant.Once the laughter passed, Taylor Swift spoke about the part of the Travis Kelce engagement fans rarely hear. She said two major events this year always felt out of reach: getting her music rights back and getting engaged to Travis Kelce.“Like getting engaged to the love of my life, getting all my music back. Those were two things that just never could have happened. They could’ve just never happened. It wasn’t like, ‘Oh, it’s just a matter of time.’”Taylor Swift repeated the point because it matters to her. She never assumed either milestone was guaranteed. She said both could have missed her completely, and her gratitude was obvious.Earlier in the interview, she named Travis Kelce alongside Stevie Nicks and Max Martin when talking about the people she trusts for long-term advice. She told Stephen Colbert she can talk to Travis Kelce about everything from her career to her personal life. The audience reaction made it clear the relationship has reached a different level publicly.This adds context to the moment she described on “The Tonight Show.” She told Jimmy Fallon how much effort Travis Kelce put into his proposal and how long he held onto the custom cushion-cut ring before giving it to her. She admitted she still catches herself staring at it.“I look at it constantly. It does not feel in any way normal for me. I am just like, oh man, whoa.”Then she explained why it means more than the ring itself.“He is just my favorite person I have ever met. The fact that this is the person that I get to hang out with every day forever is just like, that is the whole thing.”Taylor Swift may have gone viral for a joke, but her interviews over the past few months tell a different story. She is stunned by the timing of the Travis Kelce engagement. She is still adjusting to the scale of her year. She is grateful because none of it felt guaranteed.Her line about everyone being rude might be the meme, but the truth beneath it is simple. Taylor Swift is living a year she once thought she would never experience, and the Travis Kelce engagement sits at the heart of it.","Taylor Swift’s Colbert moment set the internet off.

Jensen Huang personally delivered a supercomputer to Elon Musk





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang once said that he wished to be involved in everything that the Tesla CEO Elon Musk does. Speaking at a CNBC interview earlier this year, Huang said “Almost everything that Elon is part of you really want to be part of as well”, adding he is super excited about investing in the tech billionaire-owned AI company, xAI. Jensen Huang got candid during the interview when he revealed that he regrets not investing enough in Musk’s OpenAI rival.A video of Jensen Huang from the interview is now going viral where he can be seen saying “For xAI, I'm super excited about the financing opportunity that they're doing. We're an investor already.”“The only regret I have is I didn't give him more money. Almost everything that Elon is part of you really want to be part of as well, and he gave us the opportunity to invest in xAI, I'm just delighted by that,” Huang added.Notably, this was not the only time when Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang showed support for Elon Musk and his AI company. In a recent podcast with Joe Rogan, Huang applauded the Tesla CEO, recounting an episode when he was the sole early buyer of the DGX-1 AI supercomputer in 2016. Huang further said that later he personally delivered the machine to Musk in a small room that turned out to be OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.“When I announced this thing, nobody in the world wanted it.I had no purchase orders—not one. Nobody wanted to buy it. Nobody wanted to be part of it, except for Elon. He was at the event, and we were doing a fireside chat about the future of self-driving cars,” he told Rogan.However, the excitement was quickly dampened when Musk told him that he has a non-profit company.“And he goes, ‘You know what? I have a company that could really use this.’ And I said, ‘Wow, my first customer.’ I was pretty excited about it. And he goes, ‘Yeah, we have this company. It’s a non-profit company’,” Huang said, recounting the moment during a fireside chat.","Jensen Huang once said that he wished to be involved in everything that the Tesla CEO Elon Musk does.

U-19 Asia Cup press conference: What Ayush Mhatre said before the tournament

Poll How confident are you in Suryakumar Yadav's leadership ahead of the T20 World Cup? Very confident. Somewhat confident. Not confident.

NEW DELHI: India assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate has thrown his full support behind Shubman Gill and Suryakumar Yadav , insisting there is “absolute faith” within the camp that the out-of-form batting stars will rediscover their touch ahead of next year's ICC Men's T20 World Cup.Across the opening two matches of the ongoing T20I series against South Africa, Gill and skipper Suryakumar have combined for only 21 runs. Both players are now more than a year removed from their last T20I fifty — a drought that would typically ring alarm bells this close to a global tournament. But India, Ten Doeschate stressed, are not panicking.Gill endured a first-ball dismissal during India's 51-run defeat in New Chandigarh on Thursday as South Africa levelled the five-match series 1-1. Suryakumar fared little better, managing just five off four balls.Yet Ten Doeschate was quick to defend the pair.“I saw some good signs of a change of mentality (from Gill) on the backend of that Australian tour,” he said, pointing to November's away series that offered glimpses of a shift in Gill's approach.He added crucial context to the young opener's recent failures. “The two dismissals in this series… in the first game we asked the guys to go out there and attack the Powerplay and it wasn't a great wicket at Cuttack, so I will let him off that one.And I thought he got a good ball today which can happen when you are short on form.”Ten Doeschate underlined India's unwavering belief in Gill's pedigree. “We also know the class. If you look at his IPL record where he stacks up 700 runs, 600 runs, 800 runs, 600 runs. We believe in his class and we believe he will come good.”The assistant coach expressed a similar stance on Suryakumar, backing the captain to thrive with added responsibility at the T20 World Cup.“It's exactly the same with Surya… I think you back quality players and quality leaders like that and they will come good,” he said. “I can understand from the outside it looks like a concern, but I have got absolute faith in both of them coming good at the right time for us.”",India assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate has thrown his full support behind Shubman Gill and Suryakumar Yadav.

Some of India’s leading golfers Gaganjeet Bhullar, Jeev Milkha Singh, Shiv Kapur and SSP Chawrasia won’t be allowed to tee-off in the forthcoming ‘72 The League’, a multi-city, franchise-based national league launched by the Professional Golf Tour of India (PGTI), the controlling federation for professional golf in India, on Thursday here.The PGTI has imposed a prohibition on their participation for competing in the rival private league – Indian Golf Premier League (IGPL), backed by former international cricketer Yuvraj Singh.In Sept last, the PGTI issued show-cause notices to 17 golfers, including Bhullar, for featuring in the IGPL at Jaypee Greens, Greater Noida, from Sept 17-19, an event that clashed with its own Chennai Open tournament. Other names on the list included Aman Raj, Harendra Gupta, Karandeep Kochhar and Sachin Baisoya.All 17 golfers will not be allowed to compete at the PGTI-sanctioned league, scheduled across three Delhi-NCR courses – Classic Golf and Country Club, Jaypee Greens and Qutab Golf Course – from Feb 21 to March 6 next year. These golfers will not be part of the auction pool for the league, and their names will not be shared with prospective franchises.The players, after being served the show-cause notice, had described the move as “suspension” by the PGTI. However, PGTI president Kapil Dev took a different line during the launch. “There was no suspension, no ban in place for golfers (who played in the IGPL),” he told the gathering.PGTI officials told TOI that the only pathway available for these players to compete in the league was to follow the due process which included “ensuring they won’t compete in a conflicting/rival league at the same time when the PGTI’s events are underway, take necessary permission and release clearance from the PGTI to play in the conflicting/rival league, writing a letter to the PGTI expressing their interest to play in the sanctioned league, appear before the PGTI’s disciplinary committee to explain reasons for defecting to the IGPL and commit to the PGTI’s calendar of tournaments”.“The PGTI will then take an informed decision and look at the golfers’ rankings (Order of Merit) to take them back into the fold,” the official said.These golfers also run the risk of losing their PGTI membership, as officials explained. “PGTI is a registered society which has around 350 professional golfers as its members. Every year, the membership is renewed. For those who continue to feature in the IGPL without seeking the requisite clearance or continue participating in rival tournaments whose dates are clashing with that of PGTI’s events, their membership won’t be renewed. So, you can very well understand, all those playing in the IGPL will automatically have their PGTI membership cancelled, and they won’t be able to compete in any PGTI event in future,” the official said.However, other professional golfers such as Gaurav Pratap Singh, Gurki Shergill, Shankar Das, Bikramjit Singh Sandhu, Arjun Sharma, Rohit Baisoya, Jairaj Singh Sandhu, Varun Parikh, Arjun Prasad, Shaurya Bhattacharya, Yuvraj Sandhu, Dhruv Sheoran, Saptak Talwar, Joshua Seale and Kshitij Naveed Kaul, who played in various IGPL tournaments since the launch of its Tour in Sept last, will be allowed to participate in the PGTI-sanctioned league.“They sought clearance from the PGTI to play in the IGPL. There was no clash of dates with the PGTI events, so the permission was granted. These players went there (IGPL), came back, and now they are competing in the Vishwa Samudra Open tournament, currently underway at the DGC. These players, along with others, will be part of the auction pool, as they remain part of the PGTI family,” the official added.The IGPL, which is backed by the Indian Golf Union (IGU) and the Women’s Golf Association of India (WGAI), is set to bring its own league in Jan 2026. The league has been described as India’s “LIV Golf moment” for the financial incentives it offers.Earlier this year, golfer Sachin Basoiya petitioned the Delhi high court, seeking relief and direction from the judiciary to allow him to compete in third-party tournaments, particularly the IGPL. Basoiya approached the court fearing that PGTI’s rules might prevent him from participating in the IGPL, potentially leading to a ban or suspension by the golf body. The court had, in Aug last, ruled in favour of Basoiya and ordered that permission be granted for participation in any third-party tournaments.Several other golfers have taken a similar legal recourse, approaching the Delhi HC, and the cases are being heard.Key details of the ‘72 The League’-- Total 60 golfers-- 6 Teams-- 6 crore overall purse for six franchises-- 1 crore to be spent by each franchise on buying golfers-- Rs 5 crore estimated prize purse","Gaganjeet Bhullar, Jeev Milkha Singh, Shiv Kapur and SSP Chawrasia won’t be allowed to tee-off in the forthcoming ‘72 The League’ The PGTI has imposed a prohibition on their participation for competing in the rival private league – Indian Golf Premier League (IGPL)","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125925361,imgsize-123060,width-400,resizemode-4/pgti-launches-franchise-based-professional-golf-league.jpg"

NAGPUR:

GM Bibisara Assaubayeva Exclusive: Sindarov’s World Cup win, Candidates ambitions, and more #chess

Five-time world champion Viswanathan Anand is looking forward to the Candidates chess tournament where Praggnanandhaa and three Indian women (Divya Deshmukh, Koneru Humpy and Vaishali R) will compete in Cyprus in March-April next year.Anand, who turned 56 on Thursday, said he felt warmed up after his recent competitive streak with Garry Kasparov, Arjun Erigaisi, and Faustino Oro during the ‘clash of generations’ exhibition match.“Given that I didn’t play for many months this year, I feel warmed up, and with Garry — the recovery and my performance in Jerusalem — I think it’s something to build on. With Arjun as well, it’s something to build on,” Anand, mentor of Ganges Grandmasters in the Global Chess League, said.On the league’s decision to add time increment for the GCL, Anand said, “I think it’s very nice. You still get the 40-move excitement, but losing games just because you can’t win with an extra queen when you have only three seconds is not very nice. I think it’s a good addition.”When asked about India’s presence in the 2026 Candidates, he said, “Last time there were three boys and two women. This year we have three women but only one boy.And given that Gukesh is world champion, he is essentially our candidate for the next match. He is already qualified. It’s also very good for Pragg — he had a great year and I’m looking forward to the Candidates.”On Arjun’s so-near-yet-so far affair with the Candidates, Anand said, “What Arjun is doing is correct — he keeps improving. He remains a fascinating player and will be exciting to watch in GCL as well. He will definitely have (his) chances. And with many new tournaments and the fast chess/total chess circuit, he will get many opportunities.”Continuing with the concept of the Total Champion initiative of Norway Chess and FIDE, which brings Magnus Carlsen back and validates the world title in a new format, Anand said, “It’s a pleasure to work with Norway Chess — they have a serious long-term proposal. And like I keep saying, the sport benefits when Carlsen competes.”Asked to pick his favourite Indian woman in the Candidates field, Anand said, “Humpy shows a lot of tenacity and continues competing at a high level. Divya and Vaishali are very motivated and work very hard. It’s exciting that they are in the Candidates.”Anand wasn’t surprised by the rise of women’s world cup winner Divya Deshmukh. “It was obvious she had a lot of potential. It’s nice that the World Cup happened and she got to show it. And it’s great that she’s competing in multiple events — Grand Swiss, World Cup, etc.”Asked who will be the next big name in Indian chess after the trio of Gukesh, Praggnanandhaa, and Arjun, Anand said, “There are many youngsters. Pranav Venkatesh is getting strong. Pranav Anand is having a good year. I don’t know who will break out first, but we have a lot of depth and some of them will break through soon.”","Five-time world champion Viswanathan Anand is looking forward to the Candidates chess tournament.
