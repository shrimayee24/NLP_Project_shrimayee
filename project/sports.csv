Top Picks For You Jasprit Bumrah to be Rohit Sharma's deputy in home Test series against New Zealand

WHY SHAMI MISSES OUT?

INDIA ON TOP

NEW DELHI: The Indian selectors have announced a 15-member squad for the upcoming three-match Test series against New Zealand, with some notable changes. Experienced pacer Mohammed Shami has been omitted from the team, while Jasprit Bumrah has been appointed as the vice-captain.The selectors have decided to drop left-arm pacer Yash Dayal, who was part of the squad for the Bangladesh series.The three Tests will be played in Bengaluru (Oct 16-20), Pune (Oct 24-28), and Mumbai (Nov 1-5).""The Men's Selection Committee has picked India's 15-member squad for the upcoming three-match IDFC FIRST Bank Test series against New Zealand,"" BCCI secretary Jay Shah informed in a release on Friday.Bumrah, who captained India in the Birmingham Test against England in 2022, has been elevated to the role of vice-captain.This move suggests that the selectors are grooming him to be the stand-in skipper when regular captain Rohit Sharma is unavailable. Bumrah's promotion is likely part of the team's plans for the upcoming five-match series against Australia.In the pace department, Bumrah will be supported by Mohammed Siraj and Akash Deep if the team management opts for a three-pronged pace attack. The travelling reserves include young pacer Mayank Yadav, who impressed on his debut against Bangladesh, and Prasidh Krishna, providing additional cover if needed.Shami, who has been out of action since the Men's World Cup final against Australia in November last year, remains unavailable for selection.He underwent surgery after sustaining an injury during the World Cup and is targeting a return for the Australia series.The spin-friendly wickets in India have allowed Shami more time to recover and prepare for the crucial series against Australia.The squad remains heavily reliant on spin, with Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel, and Kuldeep Yadav vying for spots in the playing XI.The selectors have not picked a backup opener, with Rohit Sharma and Yashasvi Jaiswal expected to take on the responsibility, as they did against Bangladesh.Shubman Gill is likely to continue batting at No.3, while Rishabh Pant and Dhruv Jurel are the wicketkeeping options.India currently lead the World Test Championships (WTC) standings, while New Zealand, the 2021 title-winners, sits in sixth place.The series against New Zealand is crucial for India to consolidate their position in the WTC standings ahead of the important tour of Australia later this year.India aim to reach the WTC final for the third time, having lost to New Zealand and Australia in the previous two editions.New Zealand last visited India in 2021-22 for a two-match series, which the hosts won 1-0.","India announce 15-member squad for three-match Test series against New Zealand.

Tom Brady admitted to one Lamar Jackson record that he could never complete

Lamar Jackson 's MVP performance in the Baltimore Ravens ' 41-38 overtime win over the Cincinnati Bengals was a standout. The two-time and reigning league MVP completed 26 of 42 pass attempts for 348 yards and four touchdowns, while rushing for 55 yards on 12 carries.

He complimented Lamar's statistical analysis of the Ravens QB's performance. “Lamar’s been unbelievable this season. This is one record that I would have no chance to ever complete. He’s the first player in history to have 300 pass yards, 50 rush yards, and 4 touchdowns in multiple games"", Brady said.Brady has a career record of 132 games with at least 300 passing yards and 41 with four or more touchdowns. However, he never had a game with 50 rushing yards. Jackson, on the other hand, is one of the greatest dual-threat quarterbacks in NFL history, having only gone past the 30-yard mark once in his career.Lamar Jackson became the first NFL quarterback to finish a game with 300+ passing yards, 50+ rushing yards, and 4+ passing touchdowns in Week 5 of the 2021 season. He completed the game with 442 passing yards, four touchdown passes, and 62 rushing yards on 14 carries. Only eight other players have achieved this feat, including Josh Allen, Mitchell Trubisky, Alex Smith, Deshaun Watson, Michael Vick, Bobby Hoying, and Steve Young. Jackson's historic performance helped the Ravens extend their winning streak to three.Brady praised Lamar but missed mentioning Bengals QB Joe Burrow, who had a career-high five touchdowns and 392 yards rushing.

India's probable XI for 3rd T20I against Bangladesh:

Sanju Samson (wk), Abhishek Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav (c), Nitish Reddy, Hardik Pandya , Riyan Parag, Rinku Singh , Washington Sundar, Varun Chakaravarthy, Mayank Yadav, Harshit Rana

NEW DELHI: India's youthful and energetic cricket squad is set to face Bangladesh in the final T20I of the three-match series on Saturday at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad.With the series already secured through two dominant performances — a seven-wicket win in Gwalior and an 86-run victory in Delhi — India are eyeing a clean sweep to cap off a successful campaign, which includes a 2-0 win in the preceding Test series against the visitors.The big question for fans now is whether India will make significant changes to their playing XI, potentially giving fresh faces a chance. India's assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate hinted at this possibility, acknowledging that the team might hand opportunities to youngsters in the squad.The first two matches saw impressive debuts from fast bowler Mayank Yadav and all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy. Yadav impressed with his pace, while Reddy shone with both bat and ball, showcasing his all-around talent.Ryan ten Doeschate confirmed in the pre-match press conference that the team is keen to test more players, including Harshit Rana , who could make his debut.""Yeah, that was always the plan. Obviously, there's nice depth in the squad, and a lot of guys have got IPL experience. We try to expose as many guys as we can to international experience with what we've got coming up. So someone like Harshit Rana we're keen to give a game to,"" he said.Additionally, he mentioned that although Jitesh Sharma is also an option, the team management wants to give Sanju Samson another opportunity. ""Jitesh is there as well, but we want to give Sanju another chance. So there are options, and certainly the plan originally was to win the series, get the series won and then try a few new faces for the last game,"" Ryan added.However, ten Doeschate emphasized that under the new regime, opportunities are earned, not simply handed out.""Someone like Nitish, an emerging player of the IPL last year, impressed us with the work he's done, and that goes for everyone who comes into these squads. They're very carefully selected,"" he noted. ""Jitesh (Sharma) and the guys that haven't played, Tilak (Varma) and Harshit, just having them around and seeing how they operate will be important in the next 18-month period.""India’s approach highlights their focus on depth and preparing a solid bench for upcoming international tournaments.

India in no mood to take foot off pedal as they seek 3-0 verdict in final

T20I

against

Bangladesh

HYDERABAD: With the series already in the bag, India look to complete a 3-0 rout when they take on Bangladesh in the final T20 International at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium on Saturday. The houseful will hope for a Dussehra special from the hosts, who will want openers to make good the opportunity and the rain to stay away.The first two matches were lop-sided affairs with India, under Suryakumar Yadav 's captaincy, completely outplaying Bangladesh in all three departments.And the visiting side is unlikely to get any respite with the hosts in no mood to take their foot off the pedal.The contest in Gwalior was a low-scoring affair as the visitors were bundled out for 127, which India chased down in 11.5 overs for a seven-wicket victory. The Delhi match was made to look easy by the belligerent batting of Nitish Kumar Reddy and Rinku Singh Visakhapatnam lad Nitish, playing only his second game, showcased his potential - with bat and ball - in India's crushing 86-run win. With India struggling at 25/2 in three overs, Nitish blazed his way to a 34-ball 74 that revived the hosts and put them on course for a 220+ total.His big hitting abilities that were on show during the IPL, came to the fore and his show with the ball (2/23) gave the team management a glimpse of a star in the making. While Nitish is a clear positive for the side, the below-par show of Sanju Samson and Abhishek Sharma wouldn't have missed the attention of the Indian think tank. Despite the license to go all out in the powerplay, Samson has only managed a 19-ball 29 in a chase of 128 in Gwalior and 10 off seven deliveries in Delhi.Abhishek, who like Nitish will be playing at his IPL home ground, has been equally flat as Samson, scoring 15 and 16 in the last two matches. With Jitesh Sharma waiting in the wings, Samson especially would not want to squander the opportunity.The hosts will be happy with the bowling unit. Mayank Yadav was impressive and Chakravarthy claimed three wickets in his first outing for India in three years. But it remains to be seen if the hosts want to give some game time to leg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi and all-rounder Harshit Rana .The visitors have been lacklustre, as admitted by captain Najmul Hossain Shanto .

Pakistan captain Shan Masood expressed his disappointment after the team's loss in the first Test against England. Despite scoring 556 in their first innings, Pakistan lost by an innings. This marks the first time in Test cricket history that a team has lost after posting over 500 runs in their first innings.Shan Masood commented on the performance, saying, ""It is disappointing to lose again.England found a way to win the match; they created their window of opportunity. Harsh reality is that test cricket quality sides find a way to win matches.""In the first innings, Shan contributed significantly with a score of 151.However, England surpassed Pakistan's total, declaring at 823 for 7, thanks to 317 from Harry Brook and 262 from Joe Root Shan mentioned the team's expectations and strategy: ""I wouldn't say my team is mentally weak but we expected this pitch to break by the third day onwards that is why we prolonged our innings. But at the end of the day, you have to find ways to take 20 wickets and we are not doing that in recent times.""He acknowledged that both teams played on the same pitch but emphasized the importance of taking wickets. He also noted that Pakistan had not played a Test in Multan since 2022 and had limited interaction with the curator or groundsmen.Shan admitted that the team was repeating mistakes and not learning from them. He stressed the need to adapt to changing pitch conditions daily.Reflecting on the match, he stated, ""We can't blame anyone but ourselves. Where we made lapses they didn't and capitalised on their opportunities. The pitch character did change on the fourth day when we came to bat as some cracks had opened up and there was a little something for the bowlers with the new ball.""When asked about Babar Azam 's poor form, Shan said they would review the situation before making any decisions. ""We will sit down and reflect on this test and then make decisions on the squad for the next test,"" he added.",Pakistan lost the first Test against England by an innings.

It's the way we've bowled that has made it difficult for Bangladesh to hit sixes. But the guys all play enough IPL where there's that opportunity to learn about hitting sixes and how to do it.

However, they crumbled to an innings and 47-run defeat in Multan.This marked a historic low in Test cricket, as Pakistan became the first team to lose by an innings after scoring over 500 runs in their first innings.This defeat extends Pakistan’s losing streak in Test cricket to six consecutive matches and their seventh home loss in nine Tests, highlighting their ongoing struggles.Remarkably, this Test was only the second in history to produce a result despite both teams scoring over 550 runs.The other was the 2022 Rawalpindi Test, also between Pakistan and England.In contrast, all 15 previous Tests with two 550-plus totals had ended in draws.The run rate of 4.51 across the three innings in Multan is the second highest for a Test match that lasted over 2,000 balls, surpassed only by the 4.54 rate in the 2022 Rawalpindi Test between these sides.Pakistan bowled 150 overs, conceding just one maiden, setting a new record for the most overs bowled in a Test innings with only one maiden.The previous record was 709 balls (88.5 eight-ball overs) by South Africa against England in Durban, 1939.England’s monumental 823/7 declared was powered by Harry Brook’s triple century and Joe Root ’s career-best 262, leaving Pakistan reeling before they were bowled out for 220 in their second innings, sealing the dominant victory for England.""We've spoken about the third innings or fourth innings, but at the end of the day it's a team game. Everything has its advantages or repercussions as a team. When you put up 550 on the board, it's important to back it up with 10 wickets. 220 runs in the third innings, depending on what kind of lead you have can also be a good score. England found a way to get those 20 wickets. We also have to find a way to do that. That's the challenge a side has to go forward,"" Pakistan captain Shan Masood said after the match.""We're in the middle of the series, we've talked about squad mentality and consistency. No matter how the pitch is, we have to find a way out. England showed that. Sometimes you get conditions in your favour, sometimes you don't. It's a non-negotiable of Test cricket to perform on a consistent basis. We love playing the game. We're obviously hurt by the results, hurt as a nation. I never try and shy away from responsibility. What hurts is that we're not getting the results that Pakistan cricket deserves. We are trying to turn it around,"" he said.","England beat Pakistan by an innings and 47 runs in the first Test in Multan.

Explained: India's Women's T20 World Cup semis qualification scenarios after Australia's big win over Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-womens-t20-world-cup/explained-indias-womens-t20-world-cup-semis-qualification-scenarios-after-australias-big-win-over-pakistan/articleshow/114155973.cms,"(Photo credit: BCCI Women)

NEW DELHI: Defending champions Australia were at their brutal best on Friday as they demolished Pakistan by nine wickets in their third Group A game at the Women's T20 World Cup in Dubai.After restricting Pakistan to a lowly 82 all out, the Aussies stormed past the finish line in just 11 overs, grabbing their third straight win of the tournament.With their 14th consecutive win at the cricketing extravaganza, Australia maintained their top spot in Group A which also has India, New Zealand, Sri Lanka alongside Pakistan.The win for Australia has now all but secured their semi-final spot from the group. With three wins in three matches, Australia now have a mighty impressive NRR (net run rate) of +2.786.Before the game against Pakistan, Australia had a NRR of +2.524 which went a notch higher after their lop-sided win Friday evening.The Australia win comes as good news for India as it has significantly hurt Pakistan's chances of advancing further.Before the Australia vs Pakistan game, India and Australia were at 4 points each and Pakistan and New Zealand were at two points each.The heavy defeat against Australia pushed Pakistan to the fourth place in Group A, with New Zealand creeping up to the third spot.India -- second on the table and at 4 points -- will now have to win their final league match against Australia. Pakistan's loss today also means that India will now have only New Zealand as their main challenger for the second semi-final berth.New Zealand have 2 matches remaining against Sri Lanka and Pakistan. While India have one match remaining.Considering Australia are already through, India win in their final group game will mean they end up at 6 points. To challenge India for the semis berth, New Zealand will have to win their both remaining matches and with decent margins so that they improve their NRR.Currently India have a NRR of +0.576 and New Zealand have an NRR of -0.050.For New Zealand to pip India for a semis berth, they have to better their NRR along with winning their two games. If India win their final group game and New Zealand win their two matches, the team with better NRR goes through as both will have 6 points each.In case India lose their final group game and New Zealand win both their matches, New Zealand go through along with Australia.In the third scenario, if India lose and New Zealand win and lose one each of their remaining two matches, both teams will be tied at 4 points each and that's where the NRR will come into play again.So, India will have to ensure that even if they lose their final match against Australia, they do not lose it with a big margin as it will hurt their NRR badly. In this case, if New Zealand finishes with one win and one defeat and Pakistan also win their final group game, then all the three teams will be tied at 4 points each. The team which has the best NRR out of the three will advance.Sri Lanka are already out of the semis race but they can also help India's chances for semis qualification, if they manage to beat New Zealand in their final game.","Australia beat Pakistan by nine wickets in their third Group A game at the Women's T20 World Cup in Dubai.

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal launched a blistering critique of the current Pakistan team , likening them to a ""locality team"" and accusing the players of prioritizing personal milestones over the team's success.Pakistan found themselves in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons after suffering a humiliating defeat against England in the first Test in Multan on Friday.England dominated across all five days, ultimately securing victory by an innings and 47 runs in the sweltering heat of Multan.Pakistan made unwanted history by becoming the first team in Test cricket to lose a match despite posting a total of over 550 runs in their first innings.Disheartened by the team's performance, Kamran slammed the hosts, labeling them a ""locality team"" and asserting that Pakistan can only manage to win against weaker opponents.""The world must be amazed by the way Pakistan lost.

""The last series came down to the last session at the Gabba on the last day of the last Test match.""That's a good thing to keep in mind.

Ranji Trophy: Vidarbha falter big time on Day 1 against Andhra,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/ranji-trophy-vidarbha-falter-big-time-on-day-1-against-andhra/articleshow/114154879.cms,"NAGPUR: Five specialist batters failing to go past the 20-run mark, with two ending up having ducks against their names; first innings lasting for just over a session, crumbling at a paltry score of 118; bowling lynchpin Umesh Yadav getting injured.Vidarbha’s cup of woes was filled to the brim on Day 1 of their Ranji Trophy Elite, Group B match against Andhra Pradesh at VCA Civil Lines Ground on Friday.The visitors ended the day on 114 for 1, four behind Vidarbha’s first innings total. Young opener Abhishek Reddy scored a solid unbeaten 62 with No. 3 Shaik Rasheed giving him company on 49. With the likes of Rickey Bhui and Srikar Bharat in the line-up, Andhra would look to further their dominance in the match and exploit the weakened Vidarbha bowling unit.Opting to bat first, Vidarbha suffered an early blow as Aman Mokhade was caught short of crease by a direct throw on the third ball of the match. Mokhade’s first outing as opener of the senior team ended without him facing a ball.Things went from bad to worse pretty quickly for Vidarbha. Yash Rathod (0;8b), Atharva Taide (17;24b;3x4), Karun Nair (12;13b;3x4), Danish Malewar (8;21b;2x4), and Harsh Dubey (5;11b;1x4) were dismissed inside 18 overs as Vidarbha slid to 6 for 62.At the other end, skipper Akshay Wadkar (46;92b;4x4) tried his best to stem the rot. But none of the other specialist batters showed inclination to stay at the crease and stand by the captain. “The first hour of the day is always crucial; we should have played out that phase. Unfortunately, we lost too many wickets in the first session,” Wadkar said later in the day.“This is the season opener, players are playing after a long gap. ‘kabhi rhythm baithta hain, kisika nahi baithta hain’,” Wadkar added.The batters’ slipup could prove costly for Vidarbha. With Umesh Yadav all but ruled out of the match, things look bleak for Vidarbha. “We need to take wickets in the first hour of play tomorrow. If we fail to do that, going on the defensive will be the only option left for us,” Wadkar added.Umesh injured, unlikely to take field in this matchUmesh Yadav who limped off the ground on Day 1 of the match on Friday is unlikely to take the field again in Vidarbha’s Ranji Trophy opening match. Vidarbha skipper Akshay Wadkar said that the pace spearhead has some problem with his heel.“Looks like Umesh bhai won’t be able to play further in the match. He has some issues with his heel. He is not able to even walk properly. I don't think he can take the field again in this match,” Wadkar said after the end of play on Day 1.With the batters faltering big time on Day 1, Umesh’s injury has added to the Vidarbha woes.

Pellegrini sees red

A 94th-minute winner by Vangelis Pavlidis gave Greece a 2-1 victory on Thursday against England in a Nations League clash overshadowed by the death of Greek player George Baldock on the eve of the game, while Italy were held to a draw by Belgium.Greek striker Pavlidis netted a brace, either side of a late Jude Bellingham goal, to send Greece top of Group B2.Greece's first-ever victory against England came in an emotionally-charged evening at Wembley, which started with a minute's silence prior to kick-off for Baldock, an English-born Greece international who drowned in his swimming pool in Athens on Wednesday.""It was a really special day for us because of George. We are people and it's a special night because of him,"" Pavlidis told ITV.""A difficult moment for us because George was part of the team. Special guy. We have to play for him and it doesn't matter the score today. We gave everything for him.""The Greeks took a deserved lead in the 49th minute when Pavlidis danced through flimsy defending in the England box, before driving the ball past Jordan Pickford.The visitors had three disallowed goals in the match -- the last of which came just minutes before Real Madrid's Bellingham hammered in an 87th-minute equaliser for England.However, Greece were not to be denied a third win in three Nations League matches as England failed to clear the danger in their area and Pavlidis took full advantage and drilled home a late winner.In Group A2, Italy and Belgium played out an eventful 2-2 draw in Rome.The Italians raced into the lead inside 60 seconds when Andrea Cambiaso got his first international goal by bundling home from close range.Mateo Retegui doubled the hosts' lead on 24 minutes, sweeping home with his left foot after a spilled save.Italy looked comfortable and were dominating the encounter until they suffered a double blow inside the final 10 minutes of the first half.Lorenzo Pellegrini initially picked up a yellow card for his late lunge on Arthur Theate in the 38th minute but, after a VAR review, the Italy playmaker was instead shown a straight red.Belgium then duly halved the deficit from the resulting free-kick, with Maxim De Cuyper finishing emphatically from 25 yards following a clever set-piece move.Arsenal forward Leandro Trossard completed the Belgian comeback on 61 minutes.A deep corner was nodded back across goal and Trossard ghosted past the static defence to prod the ball past Gianluigi Donnarumma from close range.""There are episodes that can change a game, like their goal immediately after we went down to ten men,"" said Italy coach Luciano Spalletti.""A result doesn't always depend on the football you play and your tactics. Certainly, we could have played better in the second half after a very good first half.""Italy remain top of their group with France sitting second after they beat Israel 4-1 in Budapest.Eduardo Camavinga gave France a seventh-minute lead when the goalkeeper fumbled his tame effort, allowing the ball to bounce over the line.Omri Gandelman levelled on 24 minutes, before Christopher Nkunku restored France's advantage four minutes later with a sharp finish.As the clock wound down, the visitors added two more goals to their tally via Matteo Guendouzi and Bradley Barcola.Erling Haaland scored a brace as Norway eased past Slovenia 3-0 in Oslo to sit top of Group B3, three points ahead of Austria who beat Kazakhstan 4-0.Republic of Ireland came from behind in Helsinki to beat Finland 2-1, they sit third in Group B2 behind England.On Friday, Germany visit Bosnia and Herzegovina and Hungary host the Netherlands in Group A3, while Iceland take on Wales in Group B4.","Greece beat England 2-1 in a UEFA Nations League clash at Wembley.

Terceros stunner

Argentina were held to a 1-1 draw by Venezuela on Lionel Messi 's return as Brazil got their 2026 World Cup qualifying campaign back on track with a last-gasp 2-1 victory over Chile on Thursday.The return of Lionel Messi to Argentina's starting line-up looked to have put the world champions on the way to victory after the Inter Miami superstar's free-kick set up an opening goal for Nicolas Otamendi after 13 minutes.But a battling performance by Venezuela in front of their home fans in Maturin was rewarded midway through the second half when the 35-year-old Rondon met Yeferson Soteldo's cross with a header that flew past Argentina goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli.Despite the dropped points, 2022 World Cup winners Argentina remain firmly on course for a place at the 2026 finals, which are being staged in the United States, Canada and Mexico.With the tournament expanded to 48 teams, the top six finishers in South America's 10-team round-robin qualifying competition will earn a ticket to the finals.Argentina lead the standings with 19 points from nine games, three points clear of second-placed Colombia, who suffered a shock 1-0 defeat to Bolivia in other qualifying action on Thursday.Yet while Argentina look poised to qualify comfortably, rivals Brazil continue to make hard work of their qualifying campaign.Chile, who are one place off the bottom of the standings, rocked Brazil after just two minutes when veteran striker Eduardo Vargas steered a looping header over Manchester City goalkeeper Ederson to make it 1-0.But Brazil drew level in first-half stoppage time after Savinho worked himself into space before crossing for Botafogo forward Igor Jesus to head home.The match looked destined to finish in a draw until the 89th minute, when Brazil substitute Luiz Henrique arrowed in a low shot from the edge of the area to make it 2-1.The win moves Brazil into fourth place in the standings with 13 points from nine games, six points adrift from leaders Brazil.Bolivia recovered from the first-half dismissal of midfielder Hector Cuellar to dig out victory in a game played in the thin air of El Alto, which is situated at around 4,150m (13,600 feet) above sea level.A superb individual goal from Miguel Terceros handed the Bolivians their fourth victory of qualifying and vaulted them up into the automatic qualification positions.Bolivia's fortunes have taken a dramatic upturn since the team started playing home qualifiers in El Alto, which is just over 500m higher than the Bolivians' usual home venue of the Estadio Hernando Siles in nearby La Paz.Bolivia opted to move fixtures to El Alto after losing two out of their opening three home qualifiers in La Paz last year.The move has paid off, with Thursday's 1-0 win coming after a 4-0 rout of Venezuela at the same venue in September.After claiming a shock 2-1 win away to Chile last month, Bolivia are now sitting in fifth place in the South American standings with 12 points from nine games.Bolivia last qualified for the World Cup at the 1994 finals in the United States, and played at the 1930 and 1950 tournaments after receiving invites to compete.Terceros's winning goal arrived in the 58th minute, with the 20-year-old winger who plays for Brazilian club Santos cutting in from the right flank, shimmying past Colombian defenders Jhon Lucumi and Kevin Castano and unleashing a left-footed thunderbolt that flew into the top corner.Bolivia are level on points with Ecuador, who moved up to fourth place in the table on Thursday after a 0-0 draw with Paraguay in Quito.In Thursday's other game, struggling Chile — who are one place off the bottom of the standings with just five points from eight games — host sixth-placed Brazil.","Argentina were held to a 1-1 draw by Venezuela on Lionel Messi's return.

Reports suggest Al Nassr's plea to move the game to Dubai as been approved.Similarly, Mohun Bagan’s participation in the AFC Champions League Two was halted when the Indian club declined to travel to Iran for their 2 October match against Tractor FC.Their refusal was driven by escalating security issues amid political unrest in Iran, notably after the passing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, which led to widespread protests and a five-day mourning period. The safety of players and officials was a paramount concern for the Indian team.Despite multiple requests to either reschedule the match or move it to a neutral venue, the AFC dismissed Mohun Bagan’s appeals. As a result, the AFC announced the club’s withdrawal from the tournament, nullifying all their matches. Many viewed this decision as an unjust penalty, particularly given the valid safety concerns raised by the team.The AFC’s handling of Mohun Bagan’s case raises concerns of bias and inconsistency in its decision-making processes. While the Indian club were immediately sent out for their concerns about traveling to Iran, the AFC have been more accommodating toward Al Nassr’s request for a neutral venue, suggesting a potential double standard.","The AFC has reportedly decided to relocate AFC Champions League match away from Iran.

Despite the early setback, Odisha showed their intent of going forward, with opponent striker Nhu continuously threatening the rival defence.Odisha’s first real attempt came in the 12th minute with Neha Sillay’s long-range shot, but it was Nishka Parkash’s setup for Yeboah that nearly levelled the score shortly after, only to be saved by the Ho Chi Minh goalkeeper.However, the home side maintained pressure, and it bore fruit just before half-time when Odisha failed to clear a deep cross, giving the hosts a comfortable two-goal cushion heading into the break.In the second half, Odisha stepped up their game and created chances on the counter. Their persistent effort paid off when Malati Munda initiated a promising attack culminating in Yeboah’s powerful finish that reduced the margin and gave the Juggernauts their first goal in the group stage. Riding on the momentum, Odisha continued to press forward in search of the equaliser but that was not to be.The home side put the game to rest in stoppage time, securing a win with their third goal of the evening.

The rivalry I had with him has impacted me the most in my career by far.""We knew that that moment is coming sooner than later, but it's still a shock, you know.""Roger a few years ago, when he announced retirement and Andy as well this year. I mean, it's a bit overwhelming for me to be honest. I don't know what to make out of it. I still enjoy competing. But part of me left with them, a big part of me.""In his 6-7 (4), 6-1, 6-4 win over Mensik, who was born over a year after Djokovic played his first match on the ATP Tour in 2004, the Serb was pushed hard but fought back to clinch the win.It ensured his progression to a record-extending 78th ATP Masters 1000 semi-final - two more than Nadal.""These kind of matches, against teenagers, it's something that really motivates me,"" Djokovic told reporters after the win.""It keeps me going, and pushes me to really dig deep, and to show to the world that I still got it in my legs, that I can still go the distance with the young guys.""I'm super glad that I managed to win this very challenging match.""Djokovic faces world number seven Taylor Fritz in the semi-finals on Saturday after the American defeated Belgian David Goffin 6-3 6-4 earlier on Friday.""I'm going to have a big server opponent tomorrow, Fritz, so I have to be ready for another difficult match,"" the 24-times Grand Slam champion said.""Quick conditions, if you serve well it's quite a big advantage.""We are entering the last couple of matches of the tournament, and now is the time for me to really try to step it up even more, and hopefully I can get a chance to be in the finals.""","Novak Djokovic says the retirement of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal has been overwhelming. The former world number one beat Jakub Mensik 6-7 (4), 6-1, 6-4 in the Shanghai Masters quarter-finals. The Serb faces Taylor Fritz in the semi- finals on Saturday after the American defeated David Goffin.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114155903,imgsize-93932,width-400,resizemode-4/114155903.jpg"

Federer-Nadal rivalry

was a clash of styles, the Spanish legend's duels with the Serbian master were nothing short of gladiatorial.

TOI takes a look at the best five from both these famous rivalries:Federer was the undisputed king and even though he had lost to Rafa the previous year, the Swiss was just unstoppable at that point.Nadal had won the first two sets and was well on course to stopping Federer from winning his first Sunshine Double, but the experience of the Swiss helped him win 2-6, 6-7, 7-6, 6-3, 6-1.Rafa had beaten Federer in the 2005 French Open semifinal, but the rivalry on clay hadn't been settled yet. The Rome final was the first of the clay swing that year and if Federer had won this match, the head-to head on this surface might not have looked as lop-sided. Federer had two match-points in the fifth set Nadal prevailed 6-7, 7-6, 6-4, 2-6, 7-6.Rafa's autobiography starts with how he was feeling when there was a rain-break in this final during the fifth set. The Spaniard had lost the earlier two Wimbledon finals to his greatest adversary and when he went two sets up. Federer then played some of his best tennis to win the next two in tie-breakers. The rain breaks, the fading light - everything added to the drama, till Rafa held after breaking Federer in the 15th game of the fifth set to win 6-4, 6-4, 6-7 , 6-7 , 9-7.Though Nadal had won the Wimbledon final the year before, the popular mandate was Federer was the better player on faster courts. This was the first time they were playing in a Grand Slam outside Roland Garros and SW19, and the stakes were massive. In a match that went to and fro, Nadal prevailed 7-5, 3-6, 7-6, 3-6, 6-2. The loss left Federer in tears and as he cried, it was Rafa who consoled him on the podium.Both were coming back after massive injuries and it was a surprise that the two made the final. Federer attacked like never before using his single-handed backhand as an explosive weapon. But Rafa weathered the storm and was up a break in the fifth set. The last four games of that match was probably the best Federer had ever played while trailing against Nadal. He eventually won 6-4, 3-6, 6-1, 3-6, 6-3.Nadal was trying to emulate Federer and a select few in the history of men's tennis to win all four Majors. Djokovic, around that time, was establishing himself as the best player on hard courts. But Nadal was just in a league of his own that year after winning his second Wimbledon title and went on to beat Novak 6-4, 5-7, 6-4, 6-2 and make a place for himself in history.Five hours, 53 minutes - it went on for that long and by the end of it, the two struggled to stand on their feet in the humidity of Melbourne during the prize distribution ceremony. The fortunes fluctuated, but Novak stood strong. Nadal led 4-2 in the fifth but Novak's resilience came through in a 5-7, 6-4, 6-2, 6-7(5), 7-5 win.Many call it the greatest clay court match of the new millennium. Novak was desperate to break his Roland Garros jinx but Rafa was just being Rafa. He said after winning the four hour 37 minute thriller 5-7, 6-4, 6-2, 6-7, 7-5: ""You need to love this game…I lost a similar one in Australia, but this one was for me.""Another epic encounter that rolled over to the next day, the match carrying on for an unreal 5hr 15min on grass-court. Novak wasn't at his best after coming back from an injury, but he refused to give up. On Saturday afternoon, the final scoreline read 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (9), 4-6, 10-8 in favour of the Serb as the tennis world revelled at the jaw-dropping resilience of the two champions.Nadal had blown away Novak in the 2020 French Open final. The battle for most Slams was also on and Nadal desperately wanted to win. The quality of the points played was outstanding, the two matching each other shot for shot. Novak won 3-6, 6-3, 7-6, 6-2.","Rafa Nadal and Novak Djokovic have been rivals for more than a decade. Nadal leads Federer 24-16 on head-to-head and DjokNovak edges Rafa 31-29. The pair have met five times in Grand Slam finals, with Federer winning three.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114137838,imgsize-43790,width-400,resizemode-4/114137838.jpg"

Vamos forever: 22-time

Grand Slam

champion

says he'll retire after next month's

finals

The 1000-watt lighting will flicker to life again and there will be another spring, but Roland Garros , located at the edge of Paris' Bois de Boulogne, once the hunting ground of French royalty, will never be the same.As of today it has become a kingdom without its king.Rafael Nadal, the 14-time winner on this ochre-hued stage, will be riding into the sunset. He'll pull out his Babolat Pure Aero for the last time as a professional tennis player in the Davis Cup Finals in Malaga, starting Nov 19. The announcement that slipped quietly into the inboxes of tennis reporters around the world was hardly unexpected given that the 38-year-old could play just two tournaments in 2023, and was only marginally better this year, 12 wins from seven tournament starts.He grit his teeth to hide the grimace, but the grunt was never quite that roar which echoed across the tennis landscape more times than it was possible to count.Nadal's 38-year-old frame has been creaking and splintering, and his spirit, stubborn and indefatigable in the trenches, was finally out of reserve. It's that thing called time. It's not always strapped on a wrist, sometimes it's the song a body sings as the summer runs out.In the video message, where he announced his retirement from the sport, the Spaniard said, he could no longer 'play without limitations', that has been Nadal's goal for most of his career, but never more than when he could sight the finish line.If anything then those words were testimony to the way he competed - stretching, straining, dragging it out, leaving it all out there. It's the only way he knew.Nadal, winner of 22 Grand Slam titles, along with Novak Djokovic (24), and Roger Federer (20) stand as tennis' trinity.While Djokovic is the Greatest Of All Time, having gone past his peers in the numbers game, Nadal, is the greatest ever to walk the red earth, having emerged triumphant at the French Open more times than any player has reigned at a major.He won in Paris on his tournament debut in 2005 as a 19-year-old, wearing white pirate pants and a sleeveless tee that showcased his biceps, and for the 14th time 17 years later in shorts and a V-neck shirt. That journey from boy to man capsuled in a stat that reads 112 wins from 116 outings at Roland Garros. Of Nadal's 92 Tour level titles, 63 have come on clay courts. His 81 consecutive wins on clay from 2005 to 07 constitute the longest single surface win streak in the Open Era in men's singles.In a sense Nadal's spirit embodied the clay - its relentless nature, the texture of the surface, which while neutralising power and pace, is easier on the body, while asking for more with every swing. It lends time and saps energy. Give and take. It even seemingly aligned forces with the left-handed Nadal's spin and supreme range, the extra step or shot, cutting edge angles, and most of all the willingness to wait.Djokovic paid the ultimate compliment to Nadal after beating him in the semifinals at Roland Garros in 2021. ""It's hard to find superlatives for Rafa's achievements here,"" the Serbian said. ""Each time you step on the court with him at Roland Garros, you have to climb Mt. Everest to win.""On a balustrade across the upper tier of Court Philippe Chatrier the words - Victory Belongs To The Most Tenacious - are engraved. The quote- which French aviator Roland Garros made his own, even inscribing it on his planes' propellers -is attributed to Napoleon I. It also sums up the 14-time champion's spirit.While Nadal - finicky with the way he places his drinks at courtside, and obsessively tugging at his shorts between points, a childhood habit he has never been able to get rid of -is notorious for winding down the shot clock and picking up time violations, he has been the very definition of sportsman-like on the court. No cussing at his box or breaking rackets.Around the grounds, he has a smile and a kind word for fans and staff. A photograph, an autograph. A memory for someone. And always for Roland Garros, a part of its earth itself.","Rafael Nadal will retire after next month's Davis Cup Finals in Malaga. The Spaniard has won 22 Grand Slam titles, including 14 at Roland Garros. The 38-year-old could play just two tournaments in 2023, and was only marginally better this year, 12 wins from seven tournament starts. Nadal's spirit embodied the clay - its relentless nature, the texture of the surface, and the extra step or shot.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114137510,imgsize-39276,width-400,resizemode-4/114137510.jpg"
