India vs Pakistan in the Asia Cup Super 4s on Sunday had not just cricket on the field but gestures that drew criticism for bringing off-field aspects into it. Both the controversial and politically-motivated gestures were made by Pakistani players on a night they suffered a 6-wicket loss at the Dubai International Stadium.The first gesture involved Sahibzada Farhan who celebrated his half-century by pointing his bat like a gun , drawing further criticism from Indian fans who accused the Pakistani team of unsportsmanlike behaviour.In the second, Pakistan fast bowler Haris Rauf made a provocative gesture towards Indian fans . While stationed near the boundary, Rauf responded to spectators' jeers by signalling ""0-6"" with his fingers, referencing to Pakistan's unverified claims of downing six Indian fighter jets during the Operation Sindoor border clash in May.The incident occurred in the second innings when Indian fans were chanting ""Virat Kohli"" to tease Rauf , despite Kohli's absence from the match following his retirement from the format last year. The chants were meant to remind Rauf of the 2022 T20 World Cup match at Melbourne Cricket Ground, where Kohli had hit memorable shots against him.Videos of Rauf's gesture quickly spread across social media platforms, drawing criticism from Indian supporters.The match also saw Rauf involved in a heated exchange with Indian opener Abhishek Sharma . The confrontation took place after the final ball of the fifth over when Gill hit a four through a short-arm jab.The situation required umpire Gazi Sohel's intervention to separate the players.Despite the controversies, the match saw Pakistan posting their highest T20I total against India while batting first, reaching 171/5.India successfully chased down the target, with Abhishek scoring 74 runs and Shubman Gill contributing 47 runs.

'My job is to play': Haris Rauf stays calm as Pakistan ride out Asia Cup drama

WATCH:

WACTH:

NEW DELHI: The high-octane India vs Pakistan clash in the Asia Cup 2025 Super Four at Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Sunday, did not just serve up a six-wicket win for the defending champions India — it also delivered fresh controversy.Pakistan pacer Haris Rauf found himself in the middle of a storm after he taunted Indian fans with a provocative “6-0” gesture near the boundary ropes, a moment that has since gone viral on social media.The gesture, captured in multiple videos and photos, showed Rauf raising his hand to signal “6-0,” a reference to Pakistan’s unverified and politically charged claims of downing six Indian fighter jets during a four-day military scuffle following Operation Sindoor. During the match in Dubai, the pacer even acted out the motion of a crashing plane in front of the fans, further fuelling tensions.The incident unfolded while Rauf was fielding close to a packed Indian section of the crowd near the boundary rope. Fans had been chanting “Kohli, Kohli” to rile him up, a reminder of Virat Kohli’s iconic straight six off his bowling in the T20 World Cup 2022. In response, the 31-year-old pacer gestured towards them with the controversial signal, triggering loud boos from Indian supporters and sparking outrage online.The cricket, however, was dominated by India. Chasing 172, Abhishek Sharma hammered a blistering 74 off just 39 balls, including six fours and five towering sixes. His 105-run opening stand with Shubman Gill (47) laid the perfect platform, as Tilak Varma (30*) and Hardik Pandya (7*) sealed the win in 18.5 overs.While Rauf opted to gesture in a provocative manner, India's Abhishek Sharma took the other route, as he held up his hand to gesture the letter 'L'. He later explained that the 'L' stood for 'love' and that it was aimed at the Indian supporters.On-field tensions between Rauf and Indian players also flared. In the fifth over, after Gill cracked a crisp boundary, Rauf exchanged heated words with Abhishek Sharma, forcing umpire Gazi Sohel to step in. Though tempers cooled quickly, the episode added to the charged atmosphere.",Haris Rauf taunts Indian fans with provocative '6-0' gesture.

Mahagathbandhan in Bihar: Will arithmetic of seat-sharing overshadow chemistry of vote yatra?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mahagathbandhan-in-bihar-will-arithmetic-of-seat-sharing-overshadow-chemistry-of-vote-yatra/articleshow/124003792.cms,"Rahul Gandhi with Tejashwi Yadav and RJD Chief Lalu Prasad during the Voter Adhikar Rally in Sasaram.

'No Confusion Regarding CM's Face' Tejashwi Yadav’s Sharp Reply on INDIA Bloc CM Candidate

Poll Should Congress support RJD's Tejashwi Yadav as the Chief Minister candidate? Yes, he deserves it. No, Congress should lead.

Why seat-sharing deal may be a tough nut to crack?

CPI's D Raja

VIP's Mukesh Sahani

Congress's Krishna Allavaru

RJD, Congress under pressure?

NEW DELHI: Rahul Gandhi's ""Voter Adhikar Yatra"" in Bihar was a picture-perfect show of unity - with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and RJD 's Tejashwi Yadav joining hands to unleash a coordinated offensive against the Election Commission and the BJP, accusing them of stealing elections. It was a campaign that brought together all the Mahagathbandhan leaders.The chemistry between the allies was obvious and was aptly summed up by Rahul Gandhi when he asserted during the course of the yatra: ""A very strong partnership had been forged. All the parties (in the bloc) are working in sync. There's no tension, and there's mutual respect for each other as we are ideologically and politically aligned. The result will be good.""Ironically though, Rahul made this statement to evade a direct reply to a pointed question - ""Why Congress was not backing RJD's Tejashwi as CM candidate?"" Clearly, the bonhomie on display notwithstanding, the Congress leader was not willing to endorse the leadership role of the senior partner in the Bihar alliance. This despite the fact that Tejashwi had already openly proclaimed during the yatra that if the opposition is voted to power in the next Lok Sabha elections, Rahul will become the Prime Minister.Little wonder then, with the yatra over, realpolitik has taken over. The yatra bonhomie between the allies seems to have given way to pressure games as they finalise the seat-sharing deal. While claims and counterclaims by allies do point to fissures in the alliance, most of this could be posturing to extract the best deal.In the 2020 assembly elections, RJD had contested 144 seats and won 75. The Congress had the worst strike rate as it contested 70 seats but won only 19. The Left parties had performed very well five years back with the CPI-ML winning 12 out of 19 it got under seat-sharing, while CPM won 2 out of 4 and CPI 2 out of 6.This time around, there are at least three more parties joining the opposition alliance: Vikasheel Insaan Party of Mukesh Sahani, JMM and the breakaway faction of LJP - headed by Chirag's uncle.Interestingly, five years back, VIP was part of Mahagathbandhan till the seat-sharing deal was announced. While the announcement was being made, VIP's Sahni walked out of the opposition alliance and crossed over to the NDA. This time around he has sought 60 seats and the post of deputy chief minister if the alliance wins.Sample some of the statements made by the allies for a better bargain this time around, and one understands why finalising a deal may not be easy.""We will try to get more seats. If other parties are demanding, our party has a great history in Bihar and it has a widespread presence and organisational strength and our party can decide the political course in different district. So we should get reasonable number of seats.""""The Vikasheel Insaan Party will contest 60 seats in 2025, with candidates from our allied parties contesting all remaining seats.""""We have always believed that if new parties come into the alliance, then every party will have to contribute from their kitty. In every state there are good seats and bad seats (in terms of winnability) and we believe that one party should not get all the good seats and the other gets the bad ones. In the sharing of seats, there should be a balance between good and bad seats.""""Hopefully, Congress would adopt a ""more realistic"" approach in the ongoing seat-sharing talks for the upcoming assembly elections, drawing lessons from its performance in the 2020 polls when it had ""bitten off more than it could possibly chew. Maybe contesting fewer seats than last time but winning more and performing better... would be in the interest of the Congress, and definitely that of the entire INDIA bloc. ""The pressure is mostly on the RJD, which is the biggest party in the alliance and has maximum stakes. Little wonder, Tejashwi has already embarked on a solo yatra to perhaps assert his dominance in the coalition.For the Congress also, its 2020 performance is a hurdle notwithstanding the claimed gains from Rahul's 'Voter Adhikar' yatra. It remains to be seen how much the two parties are willing to compromise to accommodate the other parties. Clearly, for the Mahagathbandhan, after a smooth yatra, the road ahead appears to be bumpy.",Congress's Krishna Allavaru says the alliance is working well. But he says there is still a way to go before the coalition can be fully formed. He says the coalition should be able to win more seats than it did in the last election.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124052672,imgsize-67218,width-400,resizemode-4/overshadow.jpg"

Derrick Henry dominates early to lift Ravens



Derrick Henry’s pivotal role in Ravens’ offense



Baltimore Ravens running back Derrick Henry wasted no time erasing the disappointment of last week’s game. After a subdued performance against the Browns, where he was held to just 23 yards on 11 carries, Henry made it clear he was ready to bounce back. From the very first drive against the Detroit Lions, he showcased why he remains one of the most feared backs in football, turning opportunity into dominance.The game opened with the Lions marching down the field for a touchdown, but the Ravens’ response was swift and decisive. Quarterback Lamar Jackson orchestrated a nine-play, 75-yard drive that set the tone for the night. Derrick Henry was central to the drive, rushing three times for 36 yards, including a stunning 28-yard touchdown run where he remained untouched. Henry’s explosive performance was more than redemption—it was a reminder of his unmatched power and skill.Henry himself had acknowledged all week, “I have to do better,” and he delivered on that promise. His touchdown run against Detroit alone exceeded the total yardage he gained in his 11 carries against the Browns. With the offensive line creating wide lanes, Henry’s combination of speed and strength made scoring look effortless.Derrick Henry is more than just a running back—he is the engine of Baltimore’s offense. Ravens offensive coordinator Todd Monken’s strategy to get Henry rolling early proved effective, as the Lions’ defense struggled to contain him. One week can hold a player back, but two is nearly impossible, and Henry’s performance made that evident. His dominance on the field is a message to opponents: underestimating King Henry comes at a cost.With every carry, Derrick Henry reminds fans and rivals alike why he is considered one of the premier backs in the NFL. Against the Lions, he not only bounced back but also set the stage for a Ravens offense that looks stronger and more determined than ever.Also Read: Lions’ Aidan Hutchinson’s mom becomes unlikely internet sensation during during Lions vs Ravens game",Derrick Henry is more than just a running back—he is the engine of Baltimore’s offense.

Beyond football: Melissa Hutchinson’s passions



Before the Detroit Lions and Baltimore Ravens squared off on Monday night, it wasn’t just the players drawing attention. Aidan Hutchinson’s mom, Melissa, became the unexpected star of the evening as social media lit up with her presence. For many fans, this moment wasn’t surprising—she has been a familiar face since her son’s draft journey in 2022.Melissa first captured the hearts of fans during the 2022 NFL Draft, documenting Aidan’s leap from Michigan to the professional stage. As a professional photographer, she chronicled every milestone with artistry and emotion. In one heartfelt Instagram post leading up to draft week, she wrote, “One week until we board that plane to Vegas… all I can say is meeting and working with some of the most incredibly kind, hard-working, beautifully-spirited people has by far been some of the greatest experiences of my own life. ”Her words reflected not only pride in her son but also the gratitude she felt for the entire journey. Since then, Melissa has rarely missed a chance to stand by Aidan’s side, whether at games or key career moments. On Monday, her presence at Baltimore’s stadium sparked comments like, “Hot Mom alert–Aidan Hutchinson,” proving once again that she commands attention in her own right.While football fans often spot her cheering in stadiums, Melissa Hutchinson’s life extends far beyond the sidelines.She continues to pursue her love for photography, sharing striking images from across the globe. Her work carries the same authenticity that defined her draft posts, blending personal storytelling with creative flair.Fashion is another arena where Melissa shines. In 2020, she became an ambassador for Savvi, an athleisure brand that reflects her style-forward yet approachable personality. Between her photography projects, fashion ventures, and raising three children, she manages to balance artistry with motherhood in a way that resonates with fans.For Aidan, who recently returned to the field after a season-ending injury in 2024, having his mother’s unwavering support is invaluable.

Tom Brady’s unexpected ‘kick the dog’ remark on live TV sparks backlash



PETA responds while Brady’s past with pets resurfaces



Tom Brady is once again at the center of attention, but this time it has nothing to do with his performance on the football field. During Fox Sports’ broadcast of the Dallas Cowboys and Chicago Bears game on September 21, the seven-time Super Bowl champion drew heavy criticism for a remark that many fans and animal rights advocates found troubling.As Cowboys receiver George Pickens slammed his helmet on the sideline, Brady tried to explain the frustration he saw on screen. “Those helmets can be … it’s like the dog at home. Kick the dog, throw the helmet, whatever it takes,” he said.The comment landed awkwardly. Broadcast partner Kevin Burkhardt did not respond, but viewers quickly did. Social media lit up with reactions ranging from disbelief to anger. One critic posted, “Tom Brady just promoted animal abuse on national television,” while another asked, “Did Tom Brady just casually admit to animal abuse?”The backlash grew strong enough to attract a response from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). While the organization stopped short of accusing Brady of endorsing cruelty, it made its stance clear. “PETA encourages Brady to remember that millions of people listen to him, that the language we use can encourage kindness or violence towards animals, and that we should never normalize taking our frustration out on a beloved companion,” the group said in a statement.Adding to the storm, sports commentator Skip Bayless joined the debate, writing, “I hope Brady didn’t go home after bad losses and angrily throw the dog.”The remark drew attention to Brady’s well-documented affection for his own pets.In 2016, Brady and then-wife Gisele Bündchen adopted a rescue dog named Fluffy. They also had a pit bull mix named Lua, who passed away in 2023. At the time, Brady posted a heartfelt tribute on Instagram, writing, “We love you Lua. Forever in our hearts,” alongside photos of his children hugging their beloved pet.That history has made the comment even more confusing to fans who know Brady as an animal lover. Still, the criticism underscores how closely the public watches every word from high-profile figures.For Brady, now in his second season as Fox Sports’ lead analyst, this episode adds to what has already been a rocky run in the booth. Between scrutiny over his minority ownership stake in the Las Vegas Raiders and the pressure of his $375 million broadcasting contract, the future Hall of Famer has found that life behind the microphone can be just as intense as it was under center.Also Read: Nick Foles explains two powerful reasons why the NFL must not ban Eagles’ controversial tush push play","Tom Brady sparks backlash with controversial ‘kick the dog’ comment during NFL broadcast.

Jalen Hurts and the offensive line at the heart of the success



As the debate around the Philadelphia Eagles’ famous tush push continues, franchise legend Nick Foles has stepped in with a strong defense. The Super Bowl MVP believes the league has no valid reason to eliminate the controversial short-yardage maneuver, which has become a cornerstone of the Eagles’ identity.Speaking on Front Office Sports Today, Foles said the play’s dominance is more about execution than unfair advantage. “It’s just because the Eagles are so good at it,” he explained, pointing to the frustration of opponents who can’t seem to stop it. While he acknowledged officiating concerns—such as ensuring false starts are called correctly—he stressed that banning it would punish creativity. “You can’t get rid of a play just because a team can’t be stopped on it. ”Foles also highlighted the entertainment value the play brings to the NFL. “I think it also creates a fun energy throughout the league,” he said. “Any time it’s fourth-and-1 or third-and-1, you know what’s coming. It’s like, who’s gonna be the first one to stop it?” With Jalen Hurts’ unique skillset and the Eagles’ powerhouse offensive line, the answer has rarely been anyone.While many believe the tush push works solely because of Hurts’ strength, Foles credited the unit in front of him.“Jalen Hurts is so good at doing it. He’s a powerful runner, fierce runner. I think the key, though, to the tush push, and he would tell you this as well, is the O-line. The O-line does a great job of getting leverage early.”The play narrowly survived an offseason motion to ban it, but calls have resurfaced this year after more Eagles success and some questionable no-calls. With the conversation heating up again, the question remains: will owners listen to Foles’ defense, or could this be the final season for the tush push?Also Read: Patriots fan Bill Simmons slams Bill Belichick’s public humiliation with Jordon Hudson during shocking UNC drama","Nick Foles says the tush push is more about execution than unfair advantage.

Detroit Lions send film to NFL after repeated low blocks against Aidan Hutchinson raise concern

NFL rules on low blocks and chop blocks

The Detroit Lions are worried about the blocking methods being used against their standout defensive end Aidan Hutchinson in the first few games of the 2025 NFL season. Reports say the team has sent video proof to the NFL league office, pointing out cases of low blocks during their games against the Green Bay Packers in Week 1 and the Chicago Bears in Week 2.Aidan Hutchinson suffered a broken tibia and fibula in the fifth game of the 2024 season. This injury ended his season, even though he was on track for a record-breaking performance with 7.5 sacks at that time.After that, he made a complete recovery and showed impressive form during the 2025 training camp. In the first two games of the 2025 regular season, he recorded two combined tackles and one sack, raising his career total to 29.5 sacks. His sack in Week 2 was against Chicago Bears quarterback Caleb Williams.The issues arise from the early games where opponents looked to target Hutchinson's legs with low blocks. Adam Schefter, an ESPN insider, reported this during the Monday Night Countdown on ESPN before the Lions faced the Baltimore Ravens in Week 3 on September 23, 2025.He pointed out that the Detroit Lions provided film from their matches against the Packers and Bears, showcasing specific examples of what they believe to be illegal or intentional low blocks.The Detroit Lions decided to send the film because they noticed Hutchinson was getting hit with low blocks repeatedly, which they think could lead to more injuries after his recent recovery. Schefter talked about it on Monday Night Countdown, ""The Detroit Lions have taken notice, and they've asked the league office to monitor the plays against Aidan Hutchinson. Not that that will protect him out there, but clearly people have noticed some of the plays, and the Lions want the league office to notice as well. ""Schefter further elaborated on the context of Hutchinson's injury history: ""He’s coming off the fractured tibia and fibula. If you watch his performance the first two games of the year, what stands out about that is the fact that it feels like opponents have been going low on him, so much so that the Lions have raised the issue with the league office."" He directed viewers to review film from the Week 1 game: ""If you go back and look at the film from the first game, take a look at how Green Bay is coming at Aidan Hutchinson's legs. ""Another way to look at it is that in the NFL, you can legally make low blocks targeting a player's legs or below the thigh, as long as it's done in isolation. But if a player is already engaged high by one opponent and then gets hit low by another, that's a chop block and it's against the rules. This kind of foul results in a 15-yard penalty for the team on offense.Former NFL defensive lineman and ESPN analyst Marcus Spears talked about this in the same Monday Night Countdown segment. Spears mentioned, ""It’s unfortunate, and obviously, (the complaint) is raised because of the injury that he suffered. Obviously, I’m not a fan of the cut block. I think it should have been banned a long time ago, with game safety. But that is a normal football play. And because of those tight ends, they are not going to try to block you straight up. They are going to try to get you on the ground. It’s taught that way.""Also Read: Kansas City Chiefs charge against New York Giants with Taylor Swift nowhere in sight Spears recognized that some cut blocks are legal, but he shared his personal concerns about using them, particularly against players like Hutchinson who are coming back from leg injuries.","Detroit Lions send film to NFL after repeated low blocks against Aidan Hutchinson raise concern.

England boss Sarina Wiegman won best women’s coach.Dembele’s triumph ends years of Ballon d’Or dominance by Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, and more recently Rodri, underlining PSG’s rise as a true European powerhouse. With his name etched into football history, the 2018 World Cup winner admitted the award had never been a career target but reflected: “I worked hard for the team to win the Champions League — this is the reward.”",Paris Saint-Germain winger Ousmane Dembele wins Ballon d'Or 2025.

Bill Belichick faces mounting pressure after UCF loss



AI distractions overshadow UNC’s on-field reality



It used to be a lighthearted storyline, but now the situation surrounding Bill Belichick at North Carolina feels more troubling. The legendary former New England Patriots coach, now 73, has stumbled badly in his first month leading the Tar Heels. A 34-9 blowout loss to UCF dropped his team to 1-3, leaving fans wondering if this experiment is unraveling faster than anyone imagined.Belichick’s transition to college football was never going to be simple, but the early signs have been brutal. Three lopsided defeats in four games have tested both his legacy and patience. Adding to the drama is his 24-year-old girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, whose constant presence on the sidelines and in the tunnel after games continues to stir debate. Her visibility has become part of the conversation around Belichick’s tenure, whether he likes it or not.Sports media voices have not held back. Bill Simmons, speaking on The Bill Simmons Podcast, admitted his dismay at watching his football hero endure such struggles. ""[Me and] all my Pats fans, we're just like, 'wow',"" Simmons said. ""Could this be going worse? Like this is the greatest NFL coach of all time. This has been the most humiliating year ever.He's getting his a* kicked in these games. He's got this 25 year old coming on the sidelines when he's trying to coach. Like, how did he get to this point?""*As if defeats weren’t enough, digital noise has made the situation even murkier. A viral AI-altered video appeared to show Belichick and Hudson sharing a sideline kiss. The clip, viewed nearly 5 million times, later proved fake. Yet it only intensified the circus, leaving the on-field product overshadowed by online chatter.For now, UNC fans are desperate for wins, not memes. But until Belichick finds a way to stabilize the Tar Heels, his coaching comeback may remain defined less by football and more by the noise surrounding it.Also Read: Chiefs’ Travis Kelce and Andy Reid get into fiery sideline argument on live broadcast: Is everything going well between these two?","Bill Belichick's North Carolina team is 1-3 after a 34-9 loss to UCF.

WATCH:

NEW DELHI: The Pakistan U-17 football team’s dramatic 2-3 loss to India in the SAFF U-17 Championship on Monday, in Colombo, not only highlighted the thrilling nature of the match but also drew attention for a controversial celebration that went viral on social media.The pulsating encounter at Racecourse International Stadium saw India top Group B, with goals from Dallulmuan Gangte (31’), Gunleiba Wangkheirakpam (63’), and Rahan Ahmed (73’) securing victory. Pakistan had responded through Muhammad Abdullah’s penalty (43’) and Hamza Yasir’s rebound strike (70’) to keep the contest on even keel.However, it was Muhammad Abdullah’s post-goal antics that caught the public eye. After leveling the match at 1-1, Abdullah ran to the corner flag, sat down, and mimicked sipping tea — a move interpreted by many as a provocative nod to the 2019 incident involving Indian Air Force Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, who was filmed drinking tea after being captured in Pakistan. The gesture sparked debate online, with opinions divided over whether it was playful or inflammatory.The controversy comes hot on the heels of Pakistan pacer Haris Rauf’s infamous “6-0” gesture during India’s six-wicket win in the Asia Cup Super Fours clash.Rauf, stationed near the boundary rope, used his fingers to indicate “0-6” in response to Indian fans, referencing unfounded claims about a past border incident. Videos of the action went viral, with Rauf facing widespread criticism from Indian fans for the provocative display.On the field, the match itself was tightly contested. India struck first through Gangte, only for Abdullah’s penalty to level the score. The second half saw India regain the lead via Wangkheirakpam, before Yasir equalized with a rebound. Ultimately, Rahan Ahmed’s winner in the 73rd minute sealed a tense victory for India, showcasing composure under pressure and clinical finishing.The game featured a mix of tactical battles and high-intensity moments, with goalkeepers Manashjyoti Baruah and Saamar Razzak making key saves. India’s precise passing and coordinated attacks exploited gaps in Pakistan’s defence, while Pakistan’s physicality and pressing strategy kept the contest alive until the final whistle.While India celebrated topping Group B and progressing to the semi-finals, the viral “tea celebration” ensured the match remained a talking point off the pitch, adding to the ongoing debate sparked by Haris Rauf’s controversial gesture in cricket hours earlier.","Pakistan lost 2-3 to India in the SAFF U-17 Championship on Monday.

Poll Do you think Vaibhav Suryavanshi will be a future star in Indian cricket? Yes, definitely No, he needs more experience Maybe, depending on his future performances

NEW DELHI: After a stellar showing in England, India U19 sensation Vaibhav Suryavanshi wasted no time making his mark Down Under, delivering a rapid-fire 38 off 22 balls in the first Youth ODI against Australia U19 at the Ian Healy Oval on Sunday.Suryavanshi’s cameo, featuring seven fours and a six, came at a strike rate of 172.73, setting the tone for India’s dominant performance in the three-match series. His aggressive approach earned praise from Cricket Australia, who shared clips of the innings on social media, calling it “seriously entertaining.”Batting first, Australia posted 225 for nine, thanks largely to a counterattacking 77 from John James , who steadied the innings after Australia slumped to 35 for four and later 107 for six. Seamer Henil Patel (3/38) led the Indian bowling effort, supported by Kanishk Chouhan (2/39), Kishan Kumar (2/59), and RS Ambrish (1/50), restricting the hosts well below par. Tom Hogan (41) and Steven Hogan (39) struggled against disciplined Indian bowling, reflecting the visitors’ control over the game.In reply, India’s chase began explosively with Suryavanshi and skipper Ayush Mhatre putting on a 50-run opening partnership.Suryavanshi dominated before being dismissed by Hayden Schiller. Two balls later, Mhatre’s departure triggered a mini-collapse, with Vihaan Malhotra falling for nine, leaving India at 75 for three in the 10th over.However, Abhigyan Kundu (87 not out) and Vedant Trivedi (61 not out) rebuilt the innings with an unbroken 152-run fourth-wicket stand, cruising to a comprehensive seven-wicket victory with 117 balls to spare. Kundu’s innings featured five sixes and eight fours, while Trivedi struck eight boundaries off 69 balls, ensuring the chase remained smooth.Suryavanshi’s cameo, though brief, sent a clear message: the 14-year-old prodigy is ready to assert his dominance in Australia, complementing the mature, steady contributions from Kundu and Trivedi. With his aggressive flair and natural power, Suryavanshi has firmly announced himself as one to watch in the Youth ODI series.","India U19 sensation Vaibhav Suryavanshi scores 38 off 22 balls in first Youth ODI against Australia U19 at the Ian Healy Oval on Sunday.

What to expect from the Lions in Monday night’s primetime spotlight

The 2025 NFL season rolls into Week 3 with a high-stakes Monday Night Football matchup between the Detroit Lions and the Baltimore Ravens at M&T Bank Stadium. Both teams enter the night with 1–1 records after dominant Week 2 wins, and now meet under the lights in what could be one of the most physical and fast-paced games of the early season.The biggest headline for Detroit ahead of kickoff? Quarterback Jared Goff is officially cleared and ready to start. Goff, who’s coming off a strong performance last week, is expected to lead the Lions offense without any injury concerns as they face a banged-up Ravens defense.Yes, Jared Goff is fully cleared and will start for the Detroit Lions in tonight’s primetime clash against the Baltimore Ravens. Goff is not listed on the injury report and will be under center as the Lions try to build on their Week 2 blowout win over the Chicago Bears. The veteran quarterback has thrown six touchdown passes through the first two weeks of the season, along with just one interception. He’s shown strong command of the offense and enters Week 3 with momentum and full support from the coaching staff.With a clean bill of health, Jared Goff steps into his biggest test of the season so far against a talented but injury-hit Baltimore defense. The Lions will look to lean on Goff’s poise and accuracy as they attack a Ravens front seven that will be missing key starters, including Nnamdi Madubuike and Kyle Van Noy.Goff will have plenty of firepower around him. Amon-Ra St. Brown continues to be a reliable weapon across the middle, while Jameson Williams adds deep-threat potential. In the backfield, expect Detroit to mix in a heavy dose of the run game and play-action looks to keep Goff clean and the Ravens’ pass rush off balance.This primetime battle could come down to execution in key moments. With Jared Goff healthy and in rhythm, the Lions offense is expected to target Baltimore’s weakened defensive front, especially between the tackles. Bijan Robinson and Detroit’s ground game could play a big role in setting the tone early. Look for matchups across the middle, especially with St. Brown working against Baltimore’s coverage. If Goff can avoid pressure and limit turnovers, Detroit has a strong shot at stealing a road win and moving to 2-1.On the other side, Lamar Jackson will look to keep Detroit’s defense off balance with his legs and creativity. The Ravens will need big plays from depth defenders like Aeneas Peebles and Mike Green as they look to replace production from injured starters.It’s a true test for both teams — but with Goff healthy and in form, the Lions are hoping to make a major statement in front of a national audience.",Detroit Lions host Baltimore Ravens in Monday Night Football (8:15 p.m. ET) Quarterback Jared Goff is fully cleared and ready to start for the Lions.

Sidney Crosby and Pittsburgh Penguins camp updates



Ville Koivunen impresses alongside Justin Brazeau

Sergei Murashov challenges Tristan Jarry in the net



The Pittsburgh Penguins kicked off their 2025 training camp with intensity and focus. And new head coach Dan Muse and his staff ensured the pace was high from the start. Along with practices that were loud, competitive, and physically demanding, Sidney Crosby, Bryan Rust, and Evgeni Malkin led the veteran group. While young players like Ville Koivunen showed they could make an immediate impact.Sidney Crosby has been skating at full speed during every drill. His work ethic is evident, and he consistently leads by example. Bryan Rust and Evgeni Malkin joined Crosby on several key drills, creating chemistry that was visible on the ice. Veteran defensemen, including Kris Letang, responded well to the fast pace, and the energy was noticeable in the locker room and on the ice.Kevin Hayes suffered an upper-body injury during practice and will miss the start of the regular season. This puts more responsibility on forwards like Blake Lizotte, Noel Acciari, and Tommy Novak. Filip Hallander, returning from a standout season in the Swedish Hockey League, is getting attention as a possible third-line center. His two-way play impressed the coaching staff during early drills.Ville Koivunen has emerged as one of the brightest young players at camp.Skating alongside Sidney Crosby and Justin Brazeau, he demonstrated quickness, skill, and scoring ability, and his first step has improved. It helped him stay ahead of defenders. Koivunen’s chemistry with Crosby is seamless, and he is scoring consistently during practice.Rutger McGroarty’s injury opened a door, but Koivunen’s performance suggests he would have earned attention regardless. The Penguins’ management will likely consider him for the roster if he continues at this level during preseason games. Coaches are impressed with his poise and hockey sense, signaling a possible permanent spot on the team.Goaltender Sergei Murashov has been the standout in net during the early days of training camp. His athleticism and calm under pressure make him a top performer. Murashov moves quickly post-to-post and handles rebounds efficiently. He rarely appears flustered, even against high-pressure drills.Tristan Jarry and Arturs Silovs have also shown solid form. Joel Blomqvist will join them in the first preseason game against the Montreal Canadiens. Murashov may still need AHL experience to develop fully, but his early displays are impressive. The Penguins are watching closely, as his performance could influence goaltending decisions for the season.The Pittsburgh Penguins’ training camp is off to a promising start, and veterans are leading, young players are rising, and the team’s energy is high.Also Read: NHL star Connor McDavid’s wife, Lauren Kyle, opens her cottage retreat","Pittsburgh Penguins kicked off their 2025 training camp with intensity and focus.

“The perception is that we nail the Ryder Cup and America don't. What we do is win at home. And what American nail is winning at home. Both teams have been poor on the road.""

A decade without an away win for Europe

Experience and preparation at the core

""If you take Viktor, Jon and Rory out the last Ryder Cup you are looking at maybe 10 points, which would only leave four and a half points from the rest of the team to get over the line.

Paul McGinley has poured cold water on the belief that Europe holds a special advantage in the competition. With this week’s Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black in New York, McGinley has warned that Europe faces the same struggles on American soil as their rivals do when crossing the Atlantic.McGinley, who led Europe to victory at Gleneagles in 2014, now serves as a strategic adviser to Luke Donald’s team. Speaking ahead of the contest, he made it clear that the idea of European superiority is a myth,Europe has not won a Ryder Cup on U.S. soil since the Miracle at Medinah in 2012. They overturned a 10-6 deficit on the final day. Since then, the hosts have dominated. Europe has won comfortably on home ground in 2014, 2018, and 2023, while the Americans crushed their visitors in 2016 at Hazeltine and 2021 at Whistling Straits, where the margin was a record 19-9.Donald, who captains Europe for the second consecutive time, has taken these warnings seriously. He has overseen one of the most detailed preparation campaigns ever attempted for an away Ryder Cup.From flying the squad out for an early practice trip to building temporary gyms and tailoring nutrition with local chefs, the effort has been about removing every possible excuse.McGinley revealed that Europe deliberately leaned on experienced players to handle the intensity of Bethpage’s famously vocal New York crowd. The data, he explained, shows that rookies often struggle away from home. That has led to a team where 11 of the 12 players have previous Ryder Cup experience.Donald has also kept communication channels wide open with his squad for the past year. Thus, ensuring players are mentally ready for the hostile atmosphere. Guest speakers from other sports have even been brought in to prepare the team for the noise and pressure.Also Read: Brooklyn Beckham joins celebrity lineup for Ryder Cup All-Star Match at Bethpage Black Despite the planning, McGinley knows success will depend on Europe’s leaders.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan cricket is being taken to the cleaners from all sides — batting, bowling, and fielding have all crumbled, and now their handling of the media has become a fresh embarrassment. Not only are they struggling on the field, but they also appear reluctant — even fearful — when it comes to facing the press, particularly the Indian media.Captains are expected to show up after matches, win or lose, and face tough questions with courage. That, however, has not been the case with Pakistan.During the Asia Cup group match between India and Pakistan on September 14, the “handshake controversy” became the centre of attention.After India crushed Pakistan by seven wickets in Dubai, the Pakistan captain skipped the mandatory post-match press conference. Instead, after a long delay, coach Mike Hesson was pushed in to face the media.The pattern continued ahead of Pakistan’s game against the UAE. Skipper Salman Agha was scheduled to speak but cancelled the press conference altogether, clearly avoiding the barrage of questions expected from the Indian media.When India beat Pakistan again — this time by six wickets in the Super Four stage on Sunday — the burning question resurfaced: would Pakistan finally hold a proper post-match press conference? This became the biggest talking point after their second defeat in the tournament.A press conference did happen, and Salman Agha eventually turned up. But controversy followed once more. Indian journalists sat waiting for their turn, but the microphones were never passed to them.Instead, Pakistan’s media manager Naeem Gilani ensured that only Pakistani journalists were allowed to ask questions.This blatant one-sidedness highlighted Pakistan’s biased media management.The Indian media, however, did not remain silent.When PCB chief Mohsin Naqvi visited the ICC Academy ahead of the Super Four clash, Indian reporters rushed to him for answers. Why were Pakistan not holding regular press conferences? Why were Indian journalists being ignored? Naqvi merely smiled and gave a vague response: “We will talk soon.”The drama shows no signs of ending. With Pakistan losing twice to India in the same tournament, serious questions remain: Will skipper Salman Agha or PCB chief Naqvi hold an open press conference to address this once and for all? Will Pakistan’s management show professionalism in media communication? Do they have the courage to face tough questions from Indian reporters?If not, perhaps they could learn from India’s T20I captain Suryakumar Yadav.In a recent press conference, a Pakistani journalist asked him about the handshake controversy. Surya didn’t avoid the question — he welcomed it with a smile and responded with pride. That’s how it’s done.Pakistan, you need to learn from India.","Pakistan cricket is being taken to the cleaners from all sides. Their handling of the media has become a fresh embarrassment.

Olden Polynice says LeBron James never admits mistakes and that is why the Los Angeles Lakers always shift blame,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/olden-polynice-says-lebron-james-never-admits-mistakes-and-that-is-why-the-los-angeles-lakers-always-shift-blame/articleshow/124056257.cms,"(Image Source - Getty Images)

What Olden Polynice said about LeBron James

What did Olden Polynice mean

LeBron James' current status and career achievements

Olden Polynice, a former NBA player, recently shared his perspective on LeBron James , emphasizing a concern he has about how responsibility is allocated during the wins and losses of James ' teams. Polynice, who played for 15 seasons in the NBA and was the No. 8 pick in the 1987 draft, expressed his admiration for James while also pointing out what he considers a flaw in the narrative surrounding the Lakers' star.Olden Polynice shared his thoughts while guesting on Byron Scott's Fast Break podcast. During the chat, Polynice mentioned, “The one thing I’ve always hated about LeBron — here it comes — it’s like, when they win, it’s all him. When they lose, it’s all them. I’ve always hated that narrative. We could have spoken more to his greatness if one day he had said, ‘That’s on me.’ Just one time, ‘That’s on me.’” He continued, “And to me, that’s the problem. Again, one of the greatest ever, one of the greatest ever. I admit it. I’m a fan. I love LeBron James, people. But dammit, facts are facts. Reality is reality.”During a chat about James' career and his public image, Polynice directed his comments to podcast host Byron Scott, a former Lakers player and coach.The episode delved into NBA discussions, especially focusing on James' accountability, and it came out in mid-September 2025, as noted in articles covering the remarks around September 16-18, 2025.The insights of Polynice are actually found in the observation of some of the common themes people have been making in the media and fan chatter concerning LeBron James' teams. His is of the opinion that if James teams are doing well, he receives the lion share of accomplishments, but if they are not doing well, blame is placed on the fault of his team members or other reasons.This outlook was one that was mentioned when talking about the fact that the Los Angeles Lakers did not make it out of the WBAcellence (The 2025 NBA Playoffs), as being a top three seed in the Western Conference in five games by the Minnesota Timberwolves who were near sixth seed.After the Lakers' playoff exit, NBA discussions have pointed out the need for upgrades, especially at the center position, instead of putting too much emphasis on James' contribution to the defeat.James had impressive individual stats throughout the series, yet he received less public backlash than other star players typically would in the same scenario. Polynice's comments suggest that James has never fully owned up to a loss by saying ""That's on me,"" which he believes would improve James' legacy.The podcast episode was part of the ongoing NBA offseason talks, where Byron Scott chatted with former players like Polynice to break down the current stars and team dynamics.Polynice, who is a fan of James even though he has critiqued him, took the chance to share his long-standing frustrations.LeBron James, now 40, is the oldest player still active in the NBA as of September 2025. He's set to be the first player ever to play in a 23rd season. James has clinched four NBA championships and four MVP awards.During the 2025 playoff series with the Timberwolves, James had a solid individual performance, but the team didn't make it further. There have been ongoing talks about how long he can keep playing, with Polynice having previously shared his thoughts on James' career length in other discussions.Also Read: Stephen Curry voted best American player in ESPN poll as Golden State Warriors enter 2025–26 season For instance, in June 2025, he mentioned that James' prolonged playing time might be 'a little bit too much.'

Andy Reid drops key Rashee Rice update amid Chiefs’ offensive struggles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/andy-reid-drops-key-rashee-rice-update-amid-chiefs-offensive-struggles/articleshow/124055978.cms,"Rashee Rice suspension status (AP Photos)

Andy Reid says Rashee Rice can rejoin the team this week but won’t practice



“We do get 4 back, and I know the guys will be fired up to see him. He can’t practice, he can’t be on the field. But it’ll be good to have him around,”

What this update means for the Chiefs offense

Rashee Rice’s suspension and comeback timeline

Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid has finally given fans clarity on Rashee Rice’s status, dropping a big update ahead of the team’s next matchup. Even though the wide receiver remains suspended, Reid revealed that Rice will be back around the team this week just not on the practice field.In his latest comments, Reid addressed the big question surrounding his young wideout.Reid said. The statement confirms what fans had been speculating: Rice is eligible to return in a limited capacity under NFL suspension rules.That means the receiver can attend meetings, be around teammates, and stay engaged in the system but he cannot practice or play until his suspension ends after Week 6. For a Chiefs offense that’s been searching for consistency, having Rice’s presence back in the locker room could be a much-needed boost.The Chiefs have looked out of sync at times this season, with Patrick Mahomes struggling to find a reliable rhythm in the passing game. Rice’s return won’t immediately fix that since he can’t suit up yet but Reid’s update signals the start of reintegration. The chemistry between Mahomes and Rice was building last year before Rice’s legal troubles derailed things, and Kansas City clearly sees him as a key piece moving forward.Reid’s comments also show just how much the team values having Rice around, even if he’s only in the building for film sessions and strategy talks. The mental reps could help him hit the ground running once Week 7 arrives.Rice is serving a six-game suspension for violating the NFL’s personal conduct policy following his involvement in a 2024 high-speed crash. While the suspension prevents him from participating in practices or games, the league allows suspended players to gradually rejoin facilities before their return.Rice will be eligible to take the field again in Week 7 against the Las Vegas Raiders, a divisional clash that could carry major playoff weight. Until then, the Chiefs will continue to rely on Travis Kelce, Marquise Brown, and rookie Xavier Worthy to shoulder the passing load.Also read - Will Lamar Jackson play against the Detroit Lions tonight?

Mammoth closely monitor top-line centers Logan Cooley, Jack McBain, and Barrett Hayton after preseason injuries

Nate Schmidt’s return strengthens Utah Mammoth defense and team outlook

The Utah Mammoth have reported multiple injuries following their first preseason game against the Colorado Avalanche. Top-line center Logan Cooley, along with centers Jack McBain and Barrett Hayton, were all designated day-to-day with undisclosed injuries. Mammoth head coach Andre Tourigny emphasized caution and hopes their absences are brief, while defenseman Nate Schmidt is expected to return to strengthen the team’s defensive lineup. Fans and analysts are closely monitoring the situation, as the health of these key players will be vital for Utah’s early-season success.Cooley suffered a hit from behind by Avalanche winger Zakhar Bardakov and left the ice immediately. He was a standout performer last season, tallying 25 goals and 65 points in 75 games, and also contributed 12 points in 10 games at the World Championship this summer. Tourigny expressed his displeasure at the hit and remains optimistic that Cooley’s absence will be short-lived.Jack McBain and Barrett Hayton, who play the two center spots behind Cooley, were also listed day-to-day with minor injuries. Both players set career-high scoring marks last season while appearing in all 82 games, Hayton with 20 goals and 46 points, and McBain with 13 goals and 27 points.The Mammoth will monitor their progress closely, as missing all three top-line centers, even temporarily, could pose a challenge for the team in the early regular season. Their quick recovery will be key to maintaining team chemistry and offensive consistency.On a positive note, defenseman Nate Schmidt is expected back in the lineup after previously being day-to-day. Schmidt, who won the Stanley Cup with the Florida Panthers last season, recorded 19 points in 80 regular-season games and 12 points in 23 playoff contests. He could provide stability on the back end and compete for the second-pair left-defense position against rookie Dmitri Simashev.While the Mammoth face a short-term challenge with their top centers sidelined, the team is hopeful that Cooley, McBain, and Hayton will return quickly. Schmidt’s return adds depth and experience to the defensive unit, giving Utah a stronger foundation heading into the 2025–26 regular season. Fans will be watching closely to see how the Mammoth navigate these early preseason injury concerns and adjust their lines accordingly.Also Read: NHL insider confirms Sidney Crosby trade to the Montreal Canadiens a real possibility","The Utah Mammoth have reported multiple injuries following their first preseason game against the Colorado Avalanche.

In a touching moment of history and humanity, King Charles III visited the world’s oldest living person, 116-year-old Ethel Caterham, at Hallmark Lakeview Care Home in Lightwater, Surrey. The meeting took place shortly after the King completed his official duties, including bidding farewell to US President Donald Trump at the end of his state visit and attending several high-level diplomatic events.Unlike formal royal ceremonies, this encounter was deeply personal and heartfelt. For the King, it was an opportunity to pay respect to a remarkable woman whose lifetime spans more than a century of world events and societal transformations, and for Mrs. Caterham, it was the fulfillment of a cherished wish she had expressed—to meet the monarch in person after celebrating her extraordinary milestone birthday.Ethel Caterham was born on 21 August 1909, in Shipton Bellinger, Hampshire, making her a witness to over 11 decades of world history. Her long life has seen humanity transition through wars, revolutions, pandemics, and technological transformations that reshaped the modern world, including the rise of aviation, space exploration, global communications, and major cultural shifts across continents.In April 2025, she officially became the world’s oldest living person following the death of Brazilian nun Sister Inah Canbarro Lucas, who was also 116 at the time of her passing. Beyond her age, what makes Mrs. Caterham’s life even more extraordinary is that she remains the last surviving subject of King Edward VII, connecting her directly to the Edwardian era and Britain’s early 20th-century monarchy, bridging history in a truly remarkable way.Throughout her 116 years, Ethel Caterham has lived through defining moments in global history. As a young child, she grew up in the aftermath of the Edwardian period, only to witness the First World War during her formative years. By the time she was 20, the world was in the grip of the Great Depression, and within a decade, she would see the devastation of the Second World War unfold.She also lived through monumental shifts such as the Russian Revolution, the decline of colonial empires, the rise of modern technology, and most recently, the Covid-19 pandemic. Few people alive today can claim to have seen the world transform in so many profound ways.As BBC reported, when King Charles III greeted Mrs. Caterham, the interaction was filled with warmth and wit. She reminisced about his 1969 investiture as the Prince of Wales, telling him: “I remember when your mother crowned you in Caernarfon Castle.”She went on to add with a smile that during his youth, “all the girls were in love with you and wanted to marry you.” The King responded with laughter and a humorous grimace, joking: “Yes well, all that’s left of him anyway.”This exchange highlighted not only Mrs. Caterham’s sharp memory but also her sense of humor, which continues to shine even after 116 years of life.Ethel Caterham’s personal life is as rich as her historical experiences. She was the second youngest of eight siblings and grew up in Tidworth, Wiltshire. At 18, she moved to India to work as an au pair for a military family, an adventure that shaped her independence at a time when international travel for women was rare.She returned to the UK at 21, where she met her future husband Norman at a dinner party in 1931. Together, they raised two daughters, building a family legacy that now includes three granddaughters and five great-grandchildren.Remarkably, she lived an active life well into her later years, even driving until the age of 97. For the past 50 years, she has made Surrey her permanent home, remaining close to her family.When Mrs. Caterham turned 115 in 2024, she received a personal congratulatory letter from King Charles, praising her for reaching a “truly remarkable milestone.” While her birthday celebration was kept quiet, she expressed that she would have gladly traded the occasion for a meeting with the King.This year, her wish came true. The King’s personal visit underscored the royal family’s long-standing tradition of honoring the nation’s oldest citizens. In the UK, it is customary for monarchs to send birthday greetings to those turning 100 or older, but in Mrs. Caterham’s case, the tribute went even further—a royal encounter in person.Supercentenarians, people who live beyond the age of 110, are extremely rare. There are fewer than 100 verified individuals alive worldwide who have reached this milestone, making Mrs. Caterham’s achievement extraordinary on a global scale. Longevity researchers study individuals like her to understand the genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors that contribute to such remarkable lifespans.In Ethel Caterham’s case, her resilience, sense of humor, and family support appear to be key contributors to her well-being. Her ability to drive until nearly 100 and remain mentally sharp well past her centenary suggests an active lifestyle played a role in her long life.","Ethel Caterham was born on 21 August 1909, in Shipton Bellinger, Hampshire.
