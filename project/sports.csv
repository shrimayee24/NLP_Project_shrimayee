Nikola Jokic’s influence on the Denver Nuggets squad

Theare set to face the Indiana Pacers on Monday, February 24, at Gainbridge Fieldhouse, but all eyes are on the injury report, particularly the status of reigning MVP.

His ability to elevate Denver’s offense, which ranks third in the NBA with 121.3 points per game, will be crucial against a Pacers team that allows 115.5 points per game (21st in the league).The Pacers, meanwhile, are dealing with their own injury woes. Myles Turner (neck) and James Johnson (illness) are out, while Isaiah Jackson (calf) is sidelined for the season. Despite these absences, Indiana remains competitive, led by Pascal Siakam’s 20.5 points per game and Tyrese Haliburton ’s playmaking, averaging 7.7 assists.The game tips off at 7:00 PM ET and will be broadcast on FDSIN, ALT, and KTVD, with live streaming available on Fubo. Fans can also stay engaged by participating in daily fantasy leagues on FanDuel.As the Nuggets aim to maintain their momentum in the Western Conference, Nikola Jokic’s health and performance will be pivotal. With Gordon and Murray likely available, Denver’s supporting cast must step up to alleviate the pressure on their star center.Also read: Will Tyrese Haliburton play tonight against the Denver Nuggets?

2. Greed to reach bigger heights of success

Cody Rhodes might get enticed by The Rock 's offer and choose to accept it at the WWE Elimination Chamber 2025 event.Cody Rhodes has been a remarkable, Undisputed WWE Champion for almost a year. It has been noticed by every member of the WWE Universe, but unknown to all until now, The Rock was also paying close attention to his title reign. This led to The Final Boss returning to SmackDown last week and extending a lucrative offer to become his champion and take his career to the same level as The Rock.With Cody Rhodes asked to deliver his answer to The Rock at the WWE Elimination Chamber 2025, here are the three reasons Cody Rhodes would be enticed to accept his offer:The WWE Universe might have missed it, but the babyface and fan favorite Cody Rhodes has already dropped multiple signs of a heel turn over the last few months. The first was witnessed at the WWE Saturday Night's Main Event in December 2024 in his match against Kevin Owens when he picked up a controversial win by delivering the Cross Rhodes on him on a steel chair. He showed his remorseful side even in their ladder match at the Royal Rumble 2025 PLE and had no sympathy for beating down KO. This could have been the early signs of his heel turn, which would have been triggered by his accepting The Rock's offer at Elimination Chamber.As The Rock mentioned, Cody Rhodes has achieved immense success in his WWE career. But it is nowhere close to the worldwide fame commanded by The Final Boss. The Rock made it clear that Rhodes can have those same opportunities if he sells his soul to him. In the greed to claim more success and, as The Rock said, secure the future of his family, Cody Rhodes might just accept his offer.It is heavily rumored that John Cena is set to win the 2025 Men's Elimination Chamber match. In doing so, he will earn the opportunity to challenge Cody Rhodes for the Undisputed WWE Championship at WrestleMania 41 . With Cena on his farewell tour, he has been garnering huge positive reactions. This makes it a perfect scenario for Cody Rhodes to turn heel in their feud by becoming The Rock's Corporate Champion against the babyface Cena, making it more intriguing on the road to Las Vegas.","Cody Rhodes has been a remarkable, Undisputed WWE Champion for almost a year.

Bruins battle key injuries: Brad Marchand’s health, Hampus Lindholm’s absence, McAvoy Charlie’s recovery

Boston Bruins GM Don Sweeney has provided concerning updates on team captain Brad Marchand’s health. The star forward has been dealing with injuries throughout the season, raising concerns about his availability for key games.Brad Marchand had three surgeries in summer 2024 for elbow, groin, and abdomen issues but returned for the season opener. Concerns about his durability grew when he was kept out of overtime and the shootout against Ottawa, though coach Joe Sacco said it was a tactical decision. Fans remain worried about his long-term health.In addition to Brad Marchand’s situation, the Bruins are also struggling with major injuries to key players. Hampus Lindholm, a crucial defenseman, is unlikely to return this season after undergoing surgery for a fractured patella. He sustained the injury during a game against the St. Louis Blues on November 12, 2024.According to Bruins insider Conor Ryan, Hampus Lindholm is “unlikely” to return this season. “It’s going to take a little more time to heal naturally and we don’t want to put a timeline on when he’ll be back to 100 percent,” Sweeney stated, via NHL.com.Another significant setback is Charlie McAvoy, who remains hospitalized due to an infection and a serious right shoulder injury. He suffered an AC joint injury during the 4 Nations Face-Off tournament and later developed an infection that required treatment at Massachusetts General Hospital. There is no clear timeline for his return.Marchand’s health is crucial for the Bruins' playoff hopes.He is in the final year of his eight-year, $49 million contract.In the final year of his contract, he hopes to play until 40, but injuries and his future with the team remain uncertain.Also Read: New Jersey Devils Nico Daws recorded his first NHL shutout with 29 saves in a 5-0 victory over the Nashville Predators With important games ahead against teams like the Maple Leafs, Islanders, and Penguins, the Bruins will need Marchand at full strength. His leadership and scoring ability are crucial, but staying healthy will determine how much he can contribute. Additionally, with Lindholm and McAvoy sidelined, the Bruins’ defense will need to step up in their absence to keep the team competitive.","Brad Marchand had three surgeries in summer 2024 for elbow, groin, and abdomen issues but returned for the season opener.

Tua Tagovailoa’s tenure with the Dolphins might come to an end as the team might replace the QB by drafting Jalen Milroe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/tua-tagovailoas-tenure-with-the-dolphins-might-come-to-an-end-as-the-team-might-replace-the-qb-by-drafting-jalen-milroe/articleshow/118506789.cms,"Image via Getty Images

Jalen Milroe might replace Tua Tagovailoa

Jalen Milroe , despite a subpar 2024 season at Alabama, is a promising quarterback prospect in the 2025 NFL Draft. If he finds the right scheme, he could become a franchise quarterback. Tua Tagovailoa , currently the Miami Dolphins quarterback, may be considering a move due to concussions and inconsistent performances.Tua Tagovailoa, a Dolphins quarterback, has a decent record with 15,760 yards and 101 touchdowns over five years. However, he has thrown 45 interceptions and taken 113 sacks. In the lone playoff game against the Kansas City Chiefs, he failed under pressure, completing 51.3% of his passes for 199 yards and a touchdown.Tua Tagovailoa is a game-managing quarterback with mobility to avoid pressure but not necessarily take off and win on the ground. Mike McDaniel's system hides his inefficiencies, as he lacks arm strength to consistently throw the ball down the field.McDaniel's scheme helps condense the field, make reads easier, and have more routes schemed open underneath. However, this works against weaker defenses, which are not the recipe for success for the Dolphins to win a championship. A new quarterback under center is needed.Jalen Milroe, a talented quarterback from Alabama, demonstrated advanced IQ through pump fakes and eye movement, resulting in 2,834 yards, 16 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions. His rushing ability, which included 879 yards and 20 touchdowns on the ground, opened up opportunities for the Miami offense that uses RPOs and play action. Milroe's versatility on the ground would improve offensive efficiency, as he could disguise plays better and open up opportunities for the Miami offense.Jalen Milroe, a talented quarterback, has shown the ability to open up through the air and has accurate throwing abilities. His anticipation helps him lead receivers and adjust under pressure. Despite a drop in stock due to sporadic play and inconsistency in the Senior Bowl, the upside is there. The Dolphins will likely choose Milroe as their franchise quarterback, similar to Anthony Richardson, and it will depend on the right team's draft.Also Read: “He can't do anything”: AJ Brown expressed skepticism about Travis Hunter's dual-player ambitions Jalen Milroe was a junior at Tompkins High School in Katy, Texas, and threw for 2,689 yards and 29 touchdowns as a junior. He also rushed for eight touchdowns and 378 yards. As a senior, he passed for 1,136 yards and 13 touchdowns. Milroe led Tompkins to over 30 wins in three seasons.","Jalen Milroe is a promising quarterback prospect in the 2025 NFL Draft. If he finds the right scheme, he could become a franchise quarterback.

The Dodgers are gearing up for their two-game series in Tokyo against the Cubs, starting March 18.

Bill Simmons Weigh in on LeBron James vs. Michael Jordan Debate While Addressing Luka Doncic’s Los Angeles Lakers Struggles



Do the Celtics Own the Knicks? Are the Lakers Actually Scary? | The Bill Simmons Podcast

LeBron James' Greatness Continues to Be Challenged as Michael Jordan Fans Keep GOAT Debate Alive on Elon Musk’s X

""

The debate over who is the greatest basketball player of all time—LeBron James or Michael Jordan—has been one of the most talked-about topics in sports history. Social media, especially Elon Musk’s X, has turned this discussion into an endless cycle of hot takes, arguments, and heated debates. Fans on both sides spend hours crafting narratives, statistics, and comparisons to push their preferred GOAT.Recently, NBA podcaster Bill Simmons and analyst Ryen Russillo weighed in on the issue in a humorous way, suggesting that users who dedicate half their posts to LeBron vs. Jordan should be banned from the platform. Their conversation also touched on Luka Doncic’s transition to the Lakers and how critics unfairly blamed James for the star guard’s early struggles.During the latest episode of ‘ The Bill Simmons Podcast ’, Russillo proposed a drastic—albeit joking—solution to the endless GOAT debate: ""If 50% of your tweets are on LeBron or Jordan, you should just be banned from the platform."" Simmons, amused by the idea, played along, saying, ""It's fair, we'll talk to Elon about it.""The discussion was sparked by the reactions to Luka Doncic ’s slow start with the Los Angeles Lakers following his shocking midseason trade from the Dallas Mavericks . Some critics claimed that James’ ball dominance was holding Doncic back after he struggled in his first three games. However, Simmons and Russillo pushed back against those claims, explaining that Doncic’s early struggles were more about his conditioning and the mental adjustment of leaving Dallas—a team he had envisioned playing for long-term. LeBron James ’ impact on the Lakers remains undeniable, but he still faces relentless criticism—especially from Michael Jordan supporters. Addressing this ongoing scrutiny, Lakers guard Austin Reaves told ESPN,He really doesn't have anything else to prove. And if people say he does, then they're [Michael] Jordan fans.""James continues to prove his doubters wrong, even in his 22nd NBA season. In a recent game against the Portland Trail Blazers, the 40-year-old put on a scoring clinic, dropping 40 points on the second night of a back-to-back, leading the Lakers to a hard-fought 110-102 victory. His ability to dominate at this stage of his career further cements his case as one of the all-time greats.Despite playing in different eras with different styles, the LeBron James vs. Michael Jordan debate continues to rage on. With James still adding to his legacy, his supporters argue that his longevity and all-around game make him the greatest. Meanwhile, Jordan’s fans hold firm that his six championships and perfect Finals record set him apart.Also Read: Luka Doncic and LeBron James Lead Los Angeles Lakers to Victory Over Denver Nuggets, Jamal Murray Reacts to Losing Streak Break While Simmons and Russillo’s comments about banning X users were clearly tongue-in-cheek, they highlight the obsession surrounding this debate.

Magic Johnson Sees Championship Potential in Los Angeles Lakers' New Core

Snoop Dogg’s Unexpected Luka Doncic Fandom

“Who crying now, motherf

The Los Angeles Lakers took one of the biggest gambles of the season by acquiring Luka Doncic at the trade deadline. His arrival in Los Angeles came with sky-high expectations, but his transition hasn’t been entirely smooth. That changed in a statement win against the Denver Nuggets, where Doncic delivered his best performance yet in purple and gold. His 32-point outing had fans buzzing—including Lakers legend Magic Johnson and hip-hop icon Snoop Dogg , who reflected on when he first became a fan of the star guard.After an up-and-down start in LA, Luka Doncic finally found his rhythm, leading the Lakers to a commanding 123-100 victory over the Nuggets. He spearheaded the offense with 32 points, 10 rebounds, and seven assists, proving he could carry the load when needed. LeBron James controlled the tempo, finishing with 25 points, while Austin Reaves and Rui Hachimura added 23 and 21 points, respectively. Their ability to complement Doncic’s playmaking helped LA dictate the pace. Defensively, the Lakers tightened their rotations, forcing Nikola Jokić into tough shots and disrupting Denver’s offensive flow. The dominant win gave Lakers fans a much-needed confidence boost as the team pushes for a higher playoff seed.The Los Angeles Lakers legend Magic Johnson didn’t hold back after their dominant win over Denver. Taking to X, he praised the way Luka Doncic, LeBron James , and Austin Reaves worked together, highlighting their ability to thrive under head coach JJ Redick’s system.“Big win for the Lakers tonight! This game proves that Luka, LeBron, and Reaves can thrive in JJ Redick’s offense, and Rui helped out a lot tonight too,” Johnson posted. “If the Lakers keep this up, they have a real shot at playing in the Western Conference Finals.”Johnson’s confidence stems from their blend of star power and strong role-player contributions—something the Lakers have lacked in past seasons. If this chemistry continues to develop, LA could be hitting their stride at the perfect time. Snoop Dogg has never been shy about his Lakers allegiance, often voicing his thoughts on the team’s highs and lows. While he’s primarily been known as a LeBron supporter, an old clip resurfaced after Doncic’s dominant performance, revealing an unexpected moment when Snoop first became a fan of the Slovenian superstar.The rap legend recalled witnessing Doncic’s competitive fire firsthand during a game when a fan heckled the young guard relentlessly.

Jose Quintana: Could ex-Cardinals star Jose Quintana make a surprise return to the New York Mets after Sean Manaea’s injury?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/could-ex-cardinals-star-jose-quintana-make-a-surprise-return-to-the-new-york-mets-after-sean-manaeas-injury/articleshow/118539703.cms,"(Photo by Dilip Vishwanat/Getty Images)

Sean Manaea's injury puts Mets rotation in a tough spot



Jose Quintana: A familiar face and a reliable option



Why Quintana makes sense for the Mets



What’s next for the Mets?



The New York Mets are facing yet another curveball ahead of the 2025 MLB season. Left-hander Sean Manaea, a key part of their rotation, has been sidelined due to an oblique injury — and it couldn’t have come at a worse time. With the clock ticking down to Opening Day, the Mets are scrambling for solutions, and one familiar face might be the answer: former Cardinals All-Star pitcher Jose Quintana.Sean Manaea’s injury saga started early in spring training when he experienced discomfort in his right side. What initially seemed minor took a more serious turn when an MRI confirmed a strain, forcing the Mets to shut him down for at least two weeks. If everything goes smoothly, Manaea might return by mid-to-late April — but that still leaves the Mets with a significant gap in their pitching rotation.Enter Jose Quintana . The left-hander, who pitched for the Cardinals in 2022, remains unsigned as spring training rolls on. Quintana was a solid force for St. Louis after being traded from the Pittsburgh Pirates, even earning the honor of starting Game 1 of the National League Wild Card Series against the Philadelphia Phillies.After his short stint with the Cardinals, Quintana inked a two-year, $26 million deal with the Mets, helping them reach the National League Championship Series last year. His stellar performance against the Phillies in Game 4 of the NLDS cemented his reputation as a clutch postseason pitcher.With Manaea out, bringing Quintana back seems like a no-brainer. The Mets need stability, and Quintana's familiarity with both the team and the high-pressure moments of New York baseball makes him an ideal fit. He knows the roster, the rotation dynamics, and what it takes to perform under the bright lights of Citi Field.Plus, with the Cardinals staying quiet this offseason — failing to land big-name free agents or move players like Nolan Arenado — there’s little standing in the way of Quintana reuniting with the Mets.While Manaea works on his recovery, the Mets’ front office has a decision to make. With options dwindling and Opening Day looming, a reunion with Quintana might be the boost the Mets need to weather this storm.The clock is ticking — will the Mets bring back their former ace to stabilize their shaky rotation? Fans will be watching closely.Also read - Rafael Devers races against time to reclaim Red Sox third base spot as Opening Day approaches","New York Mets left-hander Sean Manaea has been sidelined due to an oblique injury.

Potential season-ending surgery on the horizon

Alejandro Rosario’s promising career put on hold

Tough news on one of the Texas Rangers ' best pitching prospects, Alejandro Rosario, who is now facing a big setback. The 23-year-old right-hander is all but certain to miss the entire 2025 MLB season due to an elbow injury. According to initial reports, Alejandro Rosario may need Tommy John surgery , though the Rangers are still working through medical evaluations.Chris Young, the Rangers' president of baseball operations, confirmed the concerning news in a statement to MLB.com on Sunday.“He’s going to require surgery,” Young said. “As with all these things, we want to check the boxes and make sure we get multiple opinions. We don’t want to sit on this and not announce it when we know he’s going to be out, but we’re still figuring out the next steps.”If Tommy John surgery is indeed required, Alejandro Rosario will likely be sidelined for at least a year, impacting both his development and the Rangers’ pitching depth. The team is expected to consult with medical experts before making a final decision on his treatment plan.Rated as the #50 overall prospect on MLB’s official website, Alejandro Rosario was considered a top prospect in the Texas Rangers team. A terrific pitcher at the University of Miami, he was taken in the fifth round of the 2023 MLB Draft, and he showed flashes in his time down the road earlier this season with his electric arm and a potential future piece in the rotation.For the Texas Rangers, who had high hopes for his development, his injury is a big blow. As the team waits for a clear path forward, Rosario’s road to recovery should be long and difficult. Should he require surgery, he will turn his attention to rehabilitation with hopes of returning strong in the future.As Texas Rangers navigate this difficult situation, their player development staff will look to adjust their plans and continue monitoring Alejandro Rosario’s recovery closely.Also Read : 'We Need Him': Texas Rangers bank on Tyler Mahle’s healthy return to strengthen rotation","The 23-year-old right-hander is all but certain to miss the entire 2025 MLB season due to an elbow injury.

Ryan Pressly Works Through Early Jitters in First Chicago Cubs Appearance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/ryan-pressly-works-through-early-jitters-in-first-chicago-cubs-appearance/articleshow/118538937.cms,"(Image Via Getty)

Early Challenges Against Texas Rangers Lineup

High Pitch Count Raises Eyebrows

On Sunday afternoon at Sloan Park in Mesa, Arizona, Ryan Pressly toed the rubber for the first time as a member of the Chicago Cubs . The former Houston Astros closer, who was acquired in a trade to solidify the Chicaco Cubs’ bullpen, is expected to provide much-needed stability at the back end of the team’s late-inning relief corps. Though he was far from perfect in his debut, he offered the first glimpse into how he may fit into his new position.Ryan Pressly entered the game in the second inning, facing a tough stretch of the Texas Rangers' batting order, which included shortstop Corey Seager, first baseman Jake Burger, and third baseman Josh Jung. Although his delivery appeared smooth, his command was inconsistent.The fourth pitch of that at-bat was a single by Corey Seager, from which the very outset of the at-bat, left Ryan Pressly in a difficult position. But he bounced back amazingly against Burger, freezing him with a well-located four-seamer on the outside corner for his first strikeout this afternoon.The biggest battle of Pressly’s outing was against Josh Jung. He mixed his pitches well, showing the ability to spin a sharp slider and a curveball with a good vertical break. But his position was far from precise enough to distract Jung, who appeared to be in mid-season form. Like a lot of pitchers in early spring appearances, Pressly focused less on a specific pitch and more on the arsenal, working deep into the count.With Ryan Pressly’s pitch count rising, Chicago Cubs’ manager Craig Counsell made a curious choice to keep him in the game. Since it was his first spring training outing, 26 pitches did seem like a lot for a reliever beginning to ramp up to the regular season.Pressly ended the outing with two runs allowed on two hits, with one walk and one strikeout. Despite the rough start, there are no immediate concerns about his role. Ryan Pressly was acquired by the Cubs’ president of baseball operations Jed Hoyer on the understanding that he would serve as the team’s primary closer, and it should be noted that this early performance isn’t likely to alter that plan.Had there been stiff competition for the closer’s role, this outing might have sparked more discussion. However, with over a month remaining before the regular season, Pressly has plenty of time to fine-tune his mechanics and regain his sharpness. Sunday’s appearance was merely a first step in that process, a low-stakes outing focused more on knocking off rust than delivering mid-season results.Also Read : “He’s a solid dude”: Cubs pitcher Ryan Pressly praises Alex Bregman while revealing wanting him in 'Chica","Ryan Pressly made his debut as a member of the Chicago Cubs on Sunday.

AJ Brown: A champion who still wants more

AJ Brown praises Eagles' new OC



AJ Brown just won it all, but he’s far from satisfied. Fresh off a Super Bowl LIX victory, the Eagles ’ star receiver isn’t ready to crown himself the best because in his mind, there’s always more to prove. From stacking up numbers to making impossible catches, his hunger for greatness never fades. And as he sat on the sidelines during the Eagles’ Wild Card win, engrossed in Inner Excellence by Jim Murphy, it was clear that his mental game is just as strong as his physical one.AJ Brown stood in the confetti storm, soaking in the Super Bowl LIX glory. The Eagles had conquered the league, but even with a championship ring, he wasn’t ready to call himself the best.That’s the mindset of elite athletes. Brown has been stacking numbers, making impossible catches, and delivering on the biggest stage. During the Eagles’ 22-10 Wild Card win over the Packers, he sat on the sidelines reading Inner Excellence by Jim Murphy, a testament to his mental game. Even now, Jalen Hurts ’ top weapon refuses to lower his standards.On the MILLION DOLLAZ WORTH OF GAME podcast (Feb 23), Brown surprised many by ranking himself third among receivers, behind Justin Jefferson and Ja’Marr Chase.“If we want to talk about top receivers in the league, I’m definitely going to say Justin Jefferson, Jamar Chase, then I put myself third. I put myself third now even having the ring cuz you just got to go off of what happened this past year. I was banged up, and I missed four and a half games and my numbers were right with them until the end,” Brown said.He followed up with a warning: “Personally speaking for myself, I definitely feel like I’m the best in the league right now.” (via: EssentiallySports)The numbers speak for themselves. Chase’s Bengals missed the playoffs. Jefferson’s Vikings fell in the Wild Card round. Meanwhile, Brown and the Eagles steamrolled their way to a 40-22 Super Bowl victory over the Chiefs.Looking at the 2024 regular-season stats, Jefferson and Chase had strong campaigns, but in the end, Brown had the last laugh. And as for those four missed games? The Eagles kept it real. They still do.Also Read: Tom Brady fires back at Greg Olsen’s criticism of his $375M FOX deal in two words After Kellen Moore’s departure to take over as the Saints’ head coach, the Eagles found themselves facing a crucial decision. Head coach Nick Sirianni turned to his existing staff, elevating Kevin Patullo to the role of offensive coordinator, a move that sparked mixed reactions among fans. However, AJ Brown quickly set the record straight.Speaking on the February 20 episode of NFL Insiders, the Eagles’ star receiver backed the promotion, urging fans to embrace the change. “For our fans, they need to understand everything has to change. I know we just won, but it has to change. We have to get better, and we have to do things different. But I truly feel like it’s a great hire; he already has been involved in almost everything. Him, Kellen (Moore) and Nick (Sirianni) basically called the plays already. So, it’s a great hire, and he’s already familiar with us.”His message is loud and clear; the Eagles are making strategic moves, not hasty ones. Change is inevitable, but what matters is adapting early, giving the team ample time to fine-tune their approach. Fresh off their Super Bowl LIX triumph, their confidence is sky-high. Now, it’s time to see that championship mindset carry into 2025.","Eagles star receiver Jalen Hurts is far from satisfied with his Super Bowl LIX win.

Did the Eagles Really Decline a White House Invite? Not So Fast

""disagrees with their President because he insists that they proudly stand for the National Anthem.""

The Philadelphia Eagles are back in the spotlight, but this time, it's not just about their Super Bowl victory. Recent buzz suggested the team had turned down an invitation to visit the White House, but it turns out — that's simply not true. The White House has officially stated that President Donald Trump has not extended an invitation to the Eagles yet, shutting down the viral rumors.Speculation spread like wildfire across social media, with claims that the Eagles had collectively refused a White House visit — a gesture traditionally extended to championship teams. However, the truth is much simpler: there was never an invite to decline in the first place.According to a White House official, President Trump has not invited the Eagles to celebrate their Super Bowl win. If and when the invitation comes, the team plans to vote on whether or not they will attend. This directly contradicts the viral reports suggesting the team had already made up their minds and refused the honor.This isn’t the first time the Eagles have found themselves in the middle of a White House-related controversy. Back in 2018, after winning Super Bowl LII , the team was invited to visit the White House — but the situation quickly turned chaotic. Several players had already indicated they wouldn’t attend due to their political beliefs, and just a day before the event, President Trump abruptly canceled the visit altogether.At the time, Trump cited the players' stance on the national anthem protests as the reason for the cancellation, stating the teamThe event was replaced with a ""Celebration of America"" ceremony, but the fallout left a lasting mark on the team's relationship with the White House.While the drama surrounding the Eagles' potential White House visit has grabbed headlines, it’s crucial to remember the facts: there has been no invitation yet, and the team will decide collectively if and when one arrives.For now, the Super Bowl champs are enjoying their victory lap — and the rest of us can sit tight and wait to see how this story unfolds.Also read - Jalen Hurts’ WR asks Ja’Marr Chase and Justin Jefferson to make way after Eagles OC decision","The Philadelphia Eagles were invited to visit the White House after winning Super Bowl LII.

Internally, at Zomato, we have been trying out personalised “match scores” instead of traditional restaurant ratings, and we're loving it.

Match score

reduces bias from mass opinions that might not match your taste. As a result, we’re discovering more relevant restaurants than ever before.

""Kohli always knew he'd perform against Pakistan"" | Rajkumar Sharma | Exclusive interview

NEW DELHI: Australian cricket legend Ricky Ponting has heaped praise on Virat Kohli , acknowledging the Indian superstar's consistency and longevity in One Day Internationals (ODIs). Speaking on The ICC Review, Ponting — himself one of the highest run-scorers in ODIs — expressed confidence in Kohli's ability to finish as the format's all-time leading run-getter.Kohli, during his stunning century against Pakistan in Dubai at the ICC Champions Trophy , surpassed the 14,000-run milestone, and is ahead of Ponting, who is fourth with 13,704 runs, in the all-time ODI run charts. With 14,085 runs, Kohli trails only Kumar Sangakkara (14,234) and Sachin Tendulkar (18,426).""He's obviously been a champion player for a long, long time. And particularly in the white-ball formats, where he's been an unbelievably good 50-over player,"" Ponting said. ""I don't think I've ever seen a better 50-over player than Virat Kohli. Now that he's gone past me and with only two ahead of him, I'm sure he would want to give himself the best chance to be remembered as the all-time leading run scorer in the game.""Ponting believes Kohli's fitness and hunger will play a crucial role in his bid to surpass Tendulkar's 18,426-run landmark, a record many once deemed untouchable. ""As long as the hunger's there — obviously physical-wise, he's probably as fit as he's ever been and works exceptionally hard on that side of his game,"" he added.Despite Kohli needing over 4,000 more runs to overtake Tendulkar, Ponting refuses to rule him out. ""It's crazy when you think about it, isn't it? Just how good Virat's been over such a long period of time, yet he's still 4,000 runs behind Sachin. It just goes to show how good Sachin was, but also his longevity in the game,"" Ponting said. ""But with someone like Virat, you never write him off. If the hunger's still there, then I'm never going to write him off.""Kohli's century against Pakistan was another testament to his brilliance in high-pressure situations. His unbeaten knock not only steered India to a six-wicket win but also cemented his legacy with more individual milestones.The Indian bowlers, led by Kuldeep Yadav (3/40) and Hardik Pandya (2/31), restricted Pakistan to 241, ensuring a manageable chase. India stumbled early, but Kohli's unshakable presence in the middle, combined with Shreyas Iyer's composed 56, helped the Men in Blue get across the line comfortably.","Ricky Ponting hails Virat Kohli's consistency and longevity in ODI cricket. Ponting is himself one of the highest run-scorers in ODIs. Kohli needs over 4,000 more runs to overtake Sachin Tendulkar.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118545205,imgsize-45198,width-400,resizemode-4/118545205.jpg"

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.
