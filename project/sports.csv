NEW DELHI: A 26-year-old businessman was assaulted by a group of men after he intervened to stop youths from harassing three women in south Delhi's Mehrauli on Monday. Police have arrested all the four men allegedly involved in the assault. Mukesh Kumar (26) lives with his family in Sangam Vihar and runs a transport business.The family said the attack took place after they attended a wedding at Mukesh’s maternal uncle’s house on Monday.While the rest of the family returned home that night, Mukesh decided to return later the same night.

Four young men and three women were already at the stall.A police source said, ""The men began making lewd remarks and harassing the women.

GHAZIABAD: Three sisters, aged 16, 14 and 12, were found dead in the early hours of Wednesday after falling from the ninth floor of their apartment building in Ghaziabad, near Delhi.The girls were discovered lying next to each other on the premises of Bharat City residential complex, directly below a bedroom window of their flat. Police say all three died on the spot.A resident of the complex, Arun Kumar, told local media he witnessed the incident at around 2am while standing on his balcony in another tower.Also read: Inside the troubled Ghaziabad home: 2 marriages, wives leaving, no schooling for kids, mounting debts and more He said the eldest girl was seated on the window ledge with her back facing the compound, while the two younger girls stood in front of her, holding her tightly.“Suddenly, the girl on the window leaned back and fell. Within seconds, the other two jumped,” Kumar said. He added that he ran downstairs and repeatedly called for an ambulance, which arrived at around 3.15am.Police took the girls to hospital, where doctors declared them dead on arrival.1.45 am2.00 am3.15 amLater in the day‘Didn’t go to school, were lonely’According to investigators, the three sisters were sleeping with their mother in one room of the flat, while their father, Chetan Kumar , slept in another room with their son.“At around 1.45am, the girls woke up on the pretext of getting water,” said Nimish Patil, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Trans-Hindon). “They went instead to the puja room and locked it from inside.”Police say the girls used a plastic stool to climb up to the window. Their mother woke up and knocked on the door, asking them to open it, but received no response.Also read: ‘You made Devu like Bollywood’: Did rift over youngest sibling push 3 Korea-obsessed Ghaziabad sisters to brink? Patil said that, according to the father’s statement, when he later woke up, he found the eldest daughter lying in the compound below. The two younger girls also jumped shortly after.A police field unit later broke open the puja room door. Inside, officers found childhood photographs of the three sisters scattered across the floor, along with a mobile phone and a pocket-sized diary.Police said the girls had taken their mother’s mobile phone before entering the puja room. The phone has been sent for forensic examination.A one-page handwritten note addressed to their father was also recovered. The note contained an apology — “Sorry Papa” — and urged him to read their diary, with the words “READ NOW” written in capital letters.Police and family members say the diary offers insight into the girls’ state of mind.According to officers familiar with the investigation, the diary reveals a deep attachment to Korean popular culture, including K-pop music, television dramas and what is known as BL (boy love) content. The girls wrote that Korea had become central to their lives and expressed anger towards their father for opposing their interest.“How did you even dare to take this from us?” reads one line in the diary.Police sources say this may refer to an incident around 15 days earlier, when Kumar allegedly took away the elder daughter’s mobile phone and sold it.Police also said this could be a reference to their father Chetan Kumar, a stock trader allegedly deep in debt , taking away the elder daughter’s phone 15 days ago and selling it.He has not denied the girls’ interest in Korean culture. “They listened to Korean music, watched Korean films, dramas, web series and cartoons. They also wanted to go to Korea,” he said. “All three wanted us to accept Korean culture, but when we refused, their behaviour changed. They went into a shell and lived in their own world.”Investigators say the girls had not attended school since the Covid-19 pandemic and were not being homeschooled. They also did not play with other children in the housing society.Writings found on the wall of their room point to a sense of isolation. Phrases such as “I am very, very alone”, “My life is very very alone” and “Make me a heart of broken” were scribbled on the wall.According to police, the sisters spent nearly all their time together and appeared to have withdrawn from social life. In their diary, they referred to each other by names borrowed from television shows — Maria , Aliza and Cindy — and appeared to see themselves as living in a separate world.The diary lists 19 things the girls said their parents disapproved of, including Korean dramas and music, as well as Chinese, Japanese, Thai, American and British entertainment. They also mentioned cartoons such as Shin-chan and Doraemon, and several mobile games.“You don’t know how much we loved Korea,” the girls wrote. “The way we loved Korean actors and K-pop groups, we didn’t even love family members that much.”The diary also refers to tensions within the family involving a younger sibling, a four-year-old girl referred to as “Devu”.The sisters wrote that they wanted to introduce Devu to their interests, but that their parents objected and instead encouraged her to watch Bollywood films. This, they wrote, caused further distress.“You made her Bollywood, which we hated more than life itself,” the diary reads.There are also references to physical punishment, although it is unclear who the girls were referring to. “Did we live in this world to get beaten by you?” one line reads. “Death would be better for us than beatings.”Another passage mentions marriage, without detail. “The mention of marriage caused tension in our hearts,” the diary says.Police believe the diary may have been written by the 14-year-old sister and estimate it was penned one or two days before the incident, possibly after an argument with their father. It has been sent for forensic analysis.Police say the family’s circumstances were complex. Kumar lives with three women who are sisters and claims to have married all of them. The eldest of the three girls who died and a younger boy are from his first wife. The two younger girls who died were born to her younger sister. The four-year-old girl mentioned in the diary is the child of the youngest sister.Officers say two of Kumar’s partners left the house in May 2025, prompting him to file missing persons reports. They returned a few days later.Investigators say Kumar suffered financial losses during the Covid-19 period and took loans thereafter, adding to stress within the household.Police say there were frequent arguments in the family over the girls’ interests and lifestyle. No foul play has been suspected so far, but officers say the investigation is ongoing and forensic reports are awaited.“This is a tragic case involving children and a family under severe emotional and financial stress,” Patil said.","Three sisters, aged 16, 14 and 12, were found dead in the early hours of Wednesday after falling from the ninth floor of their apartment building in Ghaziabad, near Delhi. Police say the girls had not been going to school since Covid, nor were they homeschooled. ‘K-culture’ seemed to have become their refuge; the sisters even called each other by names borrowed from TV shows and appeared to be living in a parallel world.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127921707,imgsize-60902,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/-.jpg"

T20 World Cup | 'Our flight is booked and we are going' - Suryakumar Yadav on Pakistan's boycott

Poll What do you think was the key factor in RCB's WPL title win? Smriti Mandhana's performance Teamwork and synergy Effective coaching Support from fans

NEW DELHI: Royal Challengers Bengaluru sealed a historic second Women’s Premier League title with a stunning win over Delhi Capitals in Vadodara on Thursday, but for spinner Shreyanka Patil, the triumph meant something far more personal — a tribute to skipper Smriti Mandhana , who delivered a match-winning performance after navigating a turbulent phase in her personal life.Mandhana, who recently faced turmoil after her wedding was called off, responded in the most emphatic way possible — smashing 87 in the final, the highest individual score in a WPL title clash. Her knock, alongside Georgia Voll’s 79, powered RCB to a record-breaking chase of 204, sealing the trophy in dramatic fashion.After the victory, Patil dedicated the title to her captain, underlining the emotional weight behind the win. “Would love to mention three people — number one, Smriti, because she has gone through a lot in the last couple of months. Would love to dedicate this win to her. Malo and Anya… Today is Anya’s son’s first birthday. And again, Malo — first time he’s the head coach and it’s a special win for all of us,” she said.Calling it a “very special” season after her comeback, Patil thanked fans for backing the team despite the daunting 200-plus target.She finished the 2026 campaign with 11 wickets in nine innings, playing a crucial role in RCB’s title run.Mandhana’s heroic innings not only anchored the highest successful chase in a WPL final but also reinforced her status as one of the league’s biggest match-winners. Delhi Capitals, meanwhile, were left searching for answers after ending their fourth straight season without a trophy.All-rounder Radha Yadav praised the management’s backing and the team’s situational training sessions, saying the hard work behind the scenes played a big role in the title run.For RCB, however, the night belonged to Mandhana — a captain who turned personal adversity into championship glory.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru sealed a historic second Women’s Premier League title with a stunning win over Delhi Capitals in Vadodara.

T20 World Cup | 'Our flight is booked and we are going' - Suryakumar Yadav on Pakistan's boycott

India wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant has singled out Abhishek Sharma as the most dangerous batter in world cricket right now, citing the youngster’s consistency and fearless approach at the top of the order.Speaking on India Today’s Salaam Cricket, Pant said Abhishek ’s current run of form is no coincidence, stressing that sustained success at the highest level can only come from a solid process backed by belief.“Going by current form, it is Abhishek Sharma. He is so consistent. Even in the IPL, he has maintained his peak, which means his process works and he is backing it with belief. Every day cannot be tukka,” Pant said.Pant, himself known for his aggressive style, pointed out that performing at a high level across multiple IPL seasons is a strong indicator of a batter’s quality and mental strength.Abhishek is set to feature in his maiden T20 World Cup and goes into the tournament as one of the most prolific batters in the format. Since making his international debut in mid-2024, the left-hander has been in red-hot form, scoring close to 1,300 runs from 38 matches at a remarkable strike rate of 195.Pant also reflected on the influence Rahul Dravid has had on his career, revealing that the former India head coach’s advice continues to shape his mindset.“I think the key is not thinking about it too much and not dwelling on it. There’s one really good line I learnt from Rahul (Dravid) bhai. He always told me one thing: ‘Rishabh, no matter what happens, try to be the same person when you score a hundred and when you score a zero,’” Pant said.The wicketkeeper-batter admitted that maintaining emotional balance remains one of the toughest challenges for any athlete.“I think, as an athlete, that’s the hardest thing to do — to remain who you are. Emotions sometimes get the better of you, but that line always stays with me. So personally, I try that. Whether I score zero or a hundred, I want to be the same guy. Maybe when I get out, it hurts more. I don’t enjoy scoring runs as much as I feel the pain of getting out,” Pant concluded.","India wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant has singled out Abhishek Sharma as the most dangerous batter in world cricket right now.

Poll Do you support Sri Lanka Cricket's plea for Pakistan to reconsider the boycott of the India-Pakistan T20 World Cup match? Yes, I support the plea No, I do not support Unsure

Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) wrote a letter to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Thursday, urging it to reconsider its decision to boycott the India vs Pakistan fixture at the T20 World Cup 2026, scheduled for February 15 at the R. Premadasa International Cricket Stadium in Colombo.TimesofIndia.com is in possession of the two-page letter written by SLC, in which it reminded the PCB of Sri Lanka’s past support to Pakistan during challenging times and urged the board to reconsider its stance. The letter also highlights significant financial, logistical and reputational consequences for the co-hosts if the game does not go ahead as planned.“We wish to place on record that Sri Lanka is highly anticipating the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026, particularly in its capacity as a host venue for matches assigned to Sri Lanka. All commercial, operational, logistical and security-related arrangements in respect of these matches have already been finalised. This includes, inter alia, hospitality planning and the sale of match tickets,” the letter read.“It is pertinent to note that ticket sales for the matches scheduled to be hosted in Sri Lanka, in particular the India versus Pakistan fixture, have already been finalised and have recorded exceptionally strong demand, with tickets being sold fast, reflecting unprecedented public interest and significant commercial expectations for Sri Lanka Cricket.Any non-participation in a scheduled marquee fixture of this nature would therefore have wide-ranging implications, including substantial financial exposure for SLC and the potential loss of anticipated tourism inflows and broader economic benefits arising from heightened international interest in the tournament. ”The board pointed out that tickets for matches in Sri Lanka, especially the India–Pakistan fixture, have been sold amid exceptional demand, underscoring unprecedented public interest and significant commercial expectations.SLC cautioned that non-participation in a marquee fixture of this scale would have far-reaching consequences, exposing the board to major financial losses while also impacting tourism inflows and the broader economy.“The Government of Sri Lanka is attentive to the potential impact of a boycott, given the significant economic benefits expected from hosting these matches. Any change to the scheduled fixtures would therefore affect not only Sri Lanka Cricket but also the wider range of stakeholders involved in ensuring the successful conduct of the tournament.""Six Sri Lankan players were wounded in March 2009 when gunmen opened fire on their team bus as it was driving to Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore for a Test match.The incident led to international teams staying away from Pakistan for nearly a decade. That streak was broken when Sri Lanka became the first to play a Test match in Pakistan after a 10-year gap (in 2019).“In this context, we respectfully recall that Sri Lanka Cricket and the Sri Lanka National Team have, on several occasions, toured Pakistan and participated in international fixtures notwithstanding exceptionally challenging and sensitive circumstances, including serious security-related incidents. These have included, inter alia, the attack on the national team convoy, as a result of which certain Sri Lankan players and officials sustained injuries, some of whom continue to carry physical impacts from those injuries to date, while others were left with profound and lasting psychological trauma. In more recent instances, further security incidents, including bombings in the region, placed additional emotional and professional strain on team members, with some compelled to contemplate withdrawal from ongoing engagements,” SLC said in the letter.Newswire, a Sri Lankan media outlet, has reported that Sri Lanka’s tourism and hospitality sector has already felt the impact of Pakistan’s reported decision to skip the February 15 match in Colombo, with widespread hotel booking cancellations across several Colombo-based properties.“Notwithstanding the gravity of these circumstances, Sri Lanka Cricket, in close coordination with the Government of Sri Lanka, remained steadfast in its support of Pakistan and the Pakistan Cricket Board, and continued to honour its commitments to international cricket in the broader interests of the game and international solidarity, at times when several other cricketing nations were hesitant or unwilling to tour Pakistan,” the letter read.“In light of this longstanding support and cooperation, SLC respectfully expects the same spirit of reciprocity and mutual respect to prevail, particularly where the matches in question are scheduled to be played in Sri Lanka, a country that has extended every assurance with regard to security, neutrality and professionalism.“In view of the foregoing, and if any decision has indeed been taken to boycott or abstain from participating in the India vs Pakistan match scheduled for February 15, 2026, we respectfully and earnestly request the PCB to reconsider such a decision. We urge you to take into account the exceptional circumstances, the enduring relationship between our two Boards and the broader interests of the game of cricket.“We humbly request that the Pakistan team participate in all scheduled matches in Sri Lanka, including the aforesaid fixture, in the true spirit of sportsmanship and without selective abstention, for the benefit of the tournament, its stakeholders and the millions of cricket fans worldwide.“We thank the Pakistan Cricket Board and the Government of Pakistan for the highest consideration given to this matter and respectfully look forward to receiving a positive response at your earliest convenience.”On Sunday, the Pakistani government announced that its men’s cricket team will not take the field against arch-rivals India on February 15, without stating the reason behind the decision.“The Government of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan grants approval to the Pakistan Cricket Team to participate in the ICC World T20 2026; however, the Pakistan Cricket Team shall not take the field in the match scheduled on February 15 against India,” the Pakistan government said in a post on X.Also Visit: England Under-19 vs India Under-19 Final: Match Details, Teams, Date and Venue","Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) wrote a letter to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Thursday, urging it to reconsider its decision to boycott the India vs Pakistan fixture.

NEW DELHI: Royal Challengers Bengaluru captain Smriti Mandhana summed up a historic night with a familiar chant — “Ee sala cup namdu” — after guiding her side to a second Women’s Premier League title and completing what she called an “amazing” run of success for the franchise across formats.RCB women had broken the title drought with a landmark triumph in 2024 before the men lifted the IPL trophy last year. Now, Mandhana’s side sealed another chapter in the franchise’s resurgence by defeating Delhi Capitals by six wickets in the WPL final, chasing down a daunting 204.“Very pleased. RCB fans are the best in the world, wherever we play we get a lot of support. Three titles in three years for the franchise — it is amazing,” Mandhana said after the win, dedicating the moment to the loyal fan base. “This one’s for you guys… Ee sala cup namdu 2!”Despite conceding 203 in the summit clash, Mandhana revealed the dressing room remained calm. “We definitely thought it was a good surface to bat on. Of course, 200-plus in a final is a good score, but the way we bowled in the last four overs helped,” she said, singling out Lauren Bell’s economical spell as the match-winning moment.Mandhana also credited Georgia Voll’s aggressive intent at the top for setting the tone in the chase. “Volly led the way… I had a feeling 10–15 days back that she would play a match-winning knock in the final.She has been working extremely hard and I’m happy it paid off,” she added.A key theme throughout Mandhana’s remarks was the role clarity provided by the support staff. “Right from the auction, everyone knew what was expected — the batting order, the phases to bowl. That makes our job easier,” she said, praising head coach Malolan Rangarajan and the management group.She highlighted the team’s collective work ethic as the driving force behind their belief. “When girls are putting in hard yards in the gym and training, you feel you can chase any score,” she noted.While Delhi Capitals suffered a fourth straight final defeat, skipper Jemimah Rodrigues praised her team’s fight, saying, “Could not be more proud of this group… everyone gave their best.”",Royal Challengers Bengaluru win second Women's Premier League title.

T20 World Cup | 'Our flight is booked and we are going' - Suryakumar Yadav on Pakistan's boycott

England Test captain Ben Stokes has revealed the extent of a nasty facial injury after being struck flush on the face by a cricket ball during a training session. The all-rounder shared an image on Instagram showing a badly bruised and swollen right eye, a cut on his cheek and lip, and a bandage packed into his nose.Despite the severity of the blow, Stokes took the incident in good humour, captioning the post: “You should see the state of the cricket ball,” accompanied by a laughing emoji.Stokes is currently not part of England’s white-ball plans and will miss the upcoming T20 World Cup. He is expected to make his return during England’s Test series against New Zealand in June.The incident comes in the aftermath of a difficult Ashes campaign for England, which ended in a heavy 4-1 defeat in Australia. Expectations had been high ahead of the tour, with England aiming to win the Ashes Down Under for the first time since 2010–11. However, defeats in the first three Tests meant Australia retained the urn within 11 days. England managed a consolation win in the Boxing Day Test at the MCG before losing the series finale in Sydney.Stokes himself endured a tough series with the bat, averaging just 18.40 across 10 innings. He was more effective with the ball, finishing with 15 wickets at an average of 25.13.His leadership also came under scrutiny. Fast bowling legend James Anderson questioned Stokes’ public praise of his players following the defeat, expressing surprise at the tone of the captain’s comments.“When I saw Stokes come out and say, the way (Josh) Tongue and (Brydon) Carse have just run in like consistently, I had a Roy Keane moment,” Anderson said on BBC Radio. “I was like, that’s your job. If you’re not willing to run in all day for your team, don’t bother. You’re in the wrong sport.”Stokes defended his side after the fifth Test, insisting effort and commitment were not the issue.“We’ve dropped a lot of catches on this tour which have been very costly to the overall situation of the games. In terms up of stepping up, I can never fault anyone’s commitment or energy that they’ve given into this. We haven’t performed well, we know that, we hold our hands up to that. But no one should question the care and commitment to try and go out there and give it your absolute best. It’s just been down to the lack of execution,” he said.Stokes later admitted he had made significant mistakes as captain during the series. England’s tour was also marred by off-field controversy, with a mid-series trip to Noosa drawing attention amid reports of a drinking culture within the camp.As Stokes recovers from his facial injury, the focus now shifts to his return in the longest format, where England will hope for a reset after a bruising Ashes campaign, both on and off the field.Also Visit: England Under-19 vs India Under-19 Final: Match Details, Teams, Date and Venue","England Test captain Ben Stokes reveals extent of a facial injury.

The duo boasts a recently amassed joint fortune worth nearly 60 million USD, a figure fuelled largely by that of Sterling’s years at the head of the Premiership pack and Milian, an increasingly influential force in property and lifestyle fronts.The couple combines public acclaim with a financial order, which is what makes it stand out. Whereas Sterling made his money via a series of football contracts and endorsements, Milian is known for creating rather than spending money, with a focus on long-term viability, property, and investment. What has grown is a contemporary alliance of power that marries sporting success with entrepreneurial vision.The pair's wealth has mainly been built through Raheem Sterling's rise in the world of football. Since then, from his early years in the Premier League to becoming an England staple, Sterling has secured contracts that would make even the best clubs in Europe envious.The marquee moves and celebrity status that led him to become one of the highest-paid stars of his era also garner him weekly wages that reflect his stature worldwide.However, Sterling has enjoyed lucrative commercial endorsements and sponsorship agreements in addition to his club salaries. Brands around the world have been keen to feature his image alongside theirs, and his wealth has surged ever since. Over the course of his career, careful financial management and a steady stream of earnings have pushed his personal net worth toward the 45 to 50 million USD range. His success highlights how modern footballers can transform talent into lasting financial security.Although Sterling is well known for his successes on the field, Paige Milian has been building a career of her own. Milian is an astute investor best known for her business and real estate interests. The value added through property ownership and development has been a key factor in solidifying the couple's overall wealth.Milian developed her own presence, creating revenue streams through fashion, modeling, and social media to supplement Sterling's earnings on the field. The duo is thought to jointly own several properties and assets, thus comprising the base of the team fanning their empire. Part of their ability to function in a world far removed from the orbit of football has been vital in determining their financial legacy in the long term.",Raheem Sterling and Paige Milian are one of sport's richest couples.

"Who is Rich Ruohonen? From semi-retirement to the Olympics, Team USA curling skipper’s remarkable comeback at 54",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/international-sports/who-is-rich-ruohonen-from-semi-retirement-to-the-olympics-team-usa-curling-skippers-remarkable-comeback-at-54/articleshow/127937033.cms,"Rich Ruohonen (via Getty Images)

Veteran curler Rich Ruohonen finds new purpose with Team USA



Eighteen months ago, Team USA curling skipper Danny Casper was fighting a serious autoimmune condition that left his future in the sport uncertain. On some days, even simple tasks were difficult. Sliding a 44-pound granite stone down the ice felt impossible. His team began searching for a backup who could step in when needed. They wanted experience, leadership, and tactical sharpness. What they did not expect was to find all of that in a 54-year-old lawyer from Minnesota.That call changed Rich Ruohonen’s life. He had quietly stepped away from elite curling after repeated Olympic Trials heartbreak. The plan was to slow down and focus on senior events. Instead, a temporary favor turned into an Olympic dream. Now, Ruohonen is headed to the 2026 Winter Games with Team Casper, defying age, expectations, and his own doubts.Rich Ruohonen joined the team as an emergency option while Danny Casper recovered from Guillain-Barré Syndrome. At first, the role was meant to be short-term. But Ruohonen thrived. He fit in quickly with teammates half his age and impressed them with his calm leadership.Even after Casper regained strength, the team asked Ruohonen to stay on as their fifth player.Earlier this winter, that decision paid off. Team Casper qualified for the 2026 Olympics by winning a tense U.S. Trials final and then dominating a last-chance qualification event weeks later. For Ruohonen, it ended more than 20 years of Olympic disappointment. Speaking to Yahoo Sports , he said reaching the Games after thinking his career was over felt unreal and deeply rewarding.If he plays in Cortina, Ruohonen could become the oldest American to compete at a Winter Olympics. He hopes to get at least a moment on the ice. He said his main wish is for the team to stay healthy and win, but admitted he would love to throw a rock or two.Ruohonen’s journey began decades earlier. He learned curling from his father as a child and became an elite junior by his teens. Even while building a legal career, he trained before sunrise and saved vacation time for tournaments. Success came later than most. He won U.S. titles but also suffered painful near misses, including heartbreak at the 2022 Olympic Trials.Those losses convinced him his Olympic hopes were finished. He believed no team would want a curler in his 50s. Fate proved him wrong. Casper later praised Ruohonen’s game-calling ability, experience, and intelligence, saying the team was excited to learn from him.Now, Ruohonen brings strategy, humor, and unity to the group. He jokes about being the team’s “old guy,” while teammates tease him about his age. He says the banter shows their bond. Whether or not he plays much, Ruohonen’s presence has already made this Olympic run unforgettable.","Rich Ruohonen joined the team as an emergency option while Danny Casper recovered from Guillain-Barré Syndrome.

Giannis Antetokounmpo responds to Milwaukee Bucks' trade rumors via Instagram story

Giannis Antetokounmpo Instagram story

Giannis Antetokounmpo has battled several injuries this season



When it comes to the Milwaukee Bucks, they will never take a chance to let go of their star player, that is, Giannis Antetokounmpo , and the feeling is quite mutual. As the NBA trade deadline saw players like Anthony Davis and James Harden being traded from their former teams, fans assumed the same would happen with Antetokounmpo as well. However, the Bucks star’s Instagram story had put a stop to all the ongoing online speculations.Giannis Antetokounmpo had earlier posted an Instagram story citing news about his future with the league and with the Milwaukee Bucks. The 2x NBA’s Most Valuable Player remained injured during most of the recent matchups; however, his scores remain intact. Let us see what the Bucks star said about his trade speculations on social media.Giannis Antetokounmpo is a star player of the Milwaukee Bucks, and there’s no way the franchise is letting him go due to some mere injuries. Whatever the reasons may be, he remains the talk of the league because of his tremendous scores. The Instagram story featured the Bucks star wearing his jersey, paired with a sign that said, “proceed with caution”, meaning that the Bucks are going to keep him throughout the deadline.Most importantly, Giannis Antetokounmpo has consistently emphasized that he wants to stay with the Milwaukee Bucks and has therefore pledged his loyalty to the team. He said, “There will never be a chance, and there will never be a moment that I will come out and say, ‘I want a trade.’”Appearing on ESPN’s “First Take”, NBA analyst Brian Wildhorst cited the possibility that the Bucks could shut Giannis Antetokounmpo down after the deadline to protect the draft positioning. Most importantly, the Bucks star has sustained many injuries this season. As of December 5, 2026, Antetokounmpo had been suffering from a right calf strain.However, his excellent scores compelled teams like the Golden State Warriors, New York Knicks, and the Miami Heat to acquire him. But, as of now, Antetokounmpo has set barriers and doesn’t wish to be parted from the Milwaukee Bucks for another year or two. He has also expressed how he wanted to compete while playing for his current team.","Giannis Antetokounmpo had earlier posted an Instagram story citing news about his future with the league and with the Milwaukee Bucks.

Will Vincent Trocheck, Nazem Kadri, Boone Jennerbe and more be the next big trade targets?



Elliotte Friedman joins NHL Now to talk the Artemi Panarin trade

FIRE SALE: Artemi Panarin, Vincent Trocheck, Robert Thomas headline NHL trade rumor mill

TSN’s Darren Dreger Talks Schaefer Leading The Islanders, Kadri Future & More | The Insider Hotline

The NHL trade market experienced its biggest transformation yet when the New York Rangers sent Artemi Panarin to the Los Angeles Kings right before the Olympic trade freeze. The league now directs its attention to other players who can make an impact because Panarin has become unavailable through his signing with the Los Angeles Kings.Olympic roster freeze starts today and will end on February 21, after which no transactions involving players will be entertained until February 22. After the freeze ends, teams will begin to evaluate players such as Vincent Trocheck, Robert Thomas, Dougie Hamilton, Nazem Kadri, and Boone Jenner, who possess center depth and blue-line stability and playoff experience.Vincent Trocheck currently stands as the most desirable center that teams can sign. The 32-year-old player signed a contract that extends until 2028-29, while his team-friendly salary stands at $5.625 million during the current salary cap increase. The number of top-six centers available in the market will create an opportunity for him to generate substantial trade value.Robert Thomas exists as a distinct category that differentiates him from all other existing classifications. The Minnesota Wild has slightly hinted that they may consider trading for a center, looking at their assessment of current players.According to some reports, the Blues would only trade it for a high-priced deal that includes young elite players. His trade value certainly makes him a player to watch as the trade period approaches.The situation with Dougie Hamilton remains silently interesting to people who follow it. The Devils defenseman has been linked to trade rumors for several months, while reports from earlier times showed he might change his preferred list of teams to trade with. NHL playoff teams seek right-shot defensemen who can move the puck because these players help teams build their defense long-term through their contractual agreements.The ongoing trade rumors about Nazem Kadri continue because Calgary keeps changing its player roster. He has three years left on his contract, which pays him $7 million each year, and his playoff experience, combined with his physical playing style, makes him an attractive option for teams that need veteran players.The name of Boone Jenner continues to exist in current discussions. The Blue Jackets captain will become a UFA this summer, and Columbus will begin handling its assets when contract negotiations reach an impasse.The trade that sent Panarin to another team ended the most significant news story of the day, but the market still contains players who can make an impact. The playoff teams will start their recruiting efforts after the Olympic freeze ends. The upcoming weeks will bring multiple changes to championship teams before the final deadline arrives.","The NHL trade market experienced its biggest transformation yet when the New York Rangers sent Artemi Panarin to the Los Angeles Kings.

Travis Kelce drops first fun detail about Taylor Swift wedding reception and it involves a lot of beer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/travis-kelce-drops-first-fun-detail-about-taylor-swift-wedding-reception-and-it-involves-a-lot-of-beer/articleshow/127953449.cms,"Image - New Heights Podcast

“I can’t even count that high”: that’s Travis Kelce’s response about Garage Beer at the reception

New Heights

“Man, I can’t even count that high.”

So what do we actually know about the Swift–Kelce wedding plans?

They’re engaged. Swift and Kelce announced their engagement in August 2025 with a joint Instagram post.







They’ve hinted at wanting a memorable but intimate celebration, possibly with close friends and family. Some reports suggest a smaller, more personal wedding rather than a huge celebrity spectacle.







Kelce’s beer quip is the first public comment about the reception vibe, not the wedding itself.







More concrete details are still unconfirmed and likely to stay private until the couple chooses to announce them.







If you thought the biggest scoop about Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s wedding would be a date or location, think again because we got better news instead. On Thursday, the Kansas City Chiefs star casually teased that his reception with Taylor Swift won’t be dry, literally, and fans are already imagining the party.At a Super Bowl week party for hispodcast, Travis Kelce gets asked how many kegs of Garage Beer, the brand he co-owns with his brother Jason, will be at his wedding reception with Taylor Swift. Kelce laughed, shrugged, and said:That’s essentially our only concrete detail right now, if this wedding happens, it’ll probably have a lot of beer flowing. Whether that means dozens of kegs or something even bigger is anyone’s guess, he didn’t elaborate.Let’s be clear: no official wedding date, venue, or guest list has been confirmed by the couple or their representatives. What Kelce did was a lighthearted, off-the-record comment, not a formal announcement.In fact, multiple sources now say that planning for the Swift–Kelce wedding isn’t even fully underway, with some reports calling it “on pause” as the couple focuses on careers and enjoying the engagement.So while the idea of a beer-fueled reception is catchy, we’re still a long way from the logistics most readers actually crave.Kelce isn’t just a football player who eats beers for breakfast, he’s a businessman who’s helped grow Garage Beer into a brand people talk about. Having that show up at a reception makes sense from a branding and personality perspective.And from a cultural angle, this kind of comment plays perfectly into the narrative of an NFL superstar who likes to have fun even amid massive life changes like a wedding.Here’s the reality based on verified info so far:","Travis Kelce teased that his reception with Taylor Swift won’t be dry, literally.

Thevisit the Kia Center on Thursday to face thein an Eastern Conference matchup between teams in very different positions. Brooklyn sits at the bottom of the standings, while Orlando is trying to stay in the playoff picture.Injuries will influence this game. The Nets are missing their leading scorer, and the Magic will be without one of their main forwards. Recent meetings, team trends, and available depth provide a clearer sense of what to expect.Brooklyn Nets has five players ruled out and no game-time decisions.Cam Thomas is out for personal reasons, removing the team’s primary scoring threat. Haywood Highsmith is still recovering from right knee surgery and is not close to returning. Tyson Etienne, Chaney Johnson, and E.J. Liddell are unavailable due to G League two-way assignments, leaving the Nets with limited depth at guard and forward.With no questionable players listed, the rotation is mostly set, though short.Orlando Magic will also be without two players but does not have any uncertain statuses.Franz Wagner remains out with a left high ankle sprain, affecting the team’s scoring, playmaking, and defensive flexibility.Colin Castleton is unavailable on a two-way assignment, reducing depth behind Wendell Carter Jr. and Bol Bol.Paolo Banchero is expected to carry more of the offense, while Jalen Suggs and Cole Anthony should take on larger ball-handling roles.Orlando leads the all-time regular-season series with 77 wins to Brooklyn’s 60 across 137 games, helped by strong runs in the 2000s and early 2010s.The teams have already played at least once this season, with Orlando generally controlling the matchup. Defense, rebounding, and transition scoring have helped the Magic create separation in competitive games. With Brooklyn again missing Cam Thomas, Orlando enters this contest in a stronger position.Brooklyn averages about 113-115 points per game while shooting roughly 45-46% from the field. The offense relies heavily on three-point attempts, producing around 15 makes per game at about 35%.Defense has been a consistent problem. Opponents score approximately 125-128 points per night, and the Nets rank near the bottom of the league in defensive rating. Transition defense and second-chance coverage remain areas of concern.Without Thomas, half-court scoring becomes harder, often shifting responsibility to Nic Claxton and supporting guards who have been less efficient.Orlando scores around 114-116 points per game on 47-48% shooting. The team averages about 13-14 made threes at a 35-36% rate but generates much of its offense inside and on the break.The Magic allow roughly 110-112 points per game and rate well defensively. Carter Jr. and Bol Bol help control the boards and protect the rim, giving Orlando a steady defensive base.Brooklyn’s guards vs Orlando’s perimeter defenseWith Thomas unavailable, the scoring burden moves to available guards such as D’Angelo Russell, along with rotation players like Ryan Dunn or Jordan Walsh. Suggs and Anthony will try to pressure ball handlers, limit drives, and force difficult shots while Orlando looks to run after turnovers.Nic Claxton faces a physical challenge against Carter Jr. and Bol Bol. Orlando’s size could lead to an advantage on the glass and create extra possessions.Brooklyn is likely to rely on a tighter lineup because of injuries. Orlando has more flexibility and can stagger minutes to keep its main players fresh late in the game.Brooklyn’s offense without Cam Thomas will be a major factor. Shot creation and efficiency will determine whether the Nets can stay close.Orlando’s transition play is another area to watch. If the Magic force mistakes and convert quickly, they can build a lead against a defense that has struggled most of the season.Rebounding may shape the flow of the game. Controlling the glass and limiting second chances usually leads to better tempo and shot selection.Orlando enters the matchup with advantages in defense, rebounding, and overall depth. Brooklyn likely needs efficient shooting and timely defensive stops to stay competitive, but the Magic appear better positioned heading into February 5.","Orlando leads the all-time regular-season series with 77 wins to Brooklyn’s 60 across 137 games. The teams have already played at least once this season, with Orlando generally controlling the matchup. The Nets are missing their leading scorer, and the Magic will be without one of their main forwards.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127952963,imgsize-408874,width-400,resizemode-4/brooklyn-nets-vs-orlando-magic.jpg"
Tyler Shough wins NFL Rookie of the Year after breakout Saints season,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/tyler-shough-wins-nfl-rookie-of-the-year-after-breakout-saints-season/articleshow/127953579.cms,"Image via IMAGN

A turnaround season for New Orleans Saints

How Tyler Shough changed the narrative

New Orleans Saints quarterback Tyler Shough has added a major honor to his debut NFL season. The 26-year-old has been named the Pepsi Zero Sugar NFL Rookie of the Year, an award decided by fan voting across the league.The announcement came just hours before the annual NFL Honors ceremony, creating some confusion among fans about whether Shough had officially won the Associated Press Offensive Rookie of the Year award. However, the fan-voted honor is separate from the AP award, which is decided by a panel of 50 media members.The recognition marks a big milestone in what turned out to be a breakthrough season for the Saints’ young quarterback. Shough did not begin the season as the Saints’ starting quarterback. He stepped into the spotlight in Week 8 after replacing Spencer Rattler and quickly changed the direction of the team’s campaign.Once he became the starter, New Orleans finished the season with a 5-4 record over the final nine games. During that stretch, Shough completed nearly 69 percent of his passes, averaging around 250 yards per game. He threw 10 touchdowns, six interceptions, and added three rushing scores.What made his performance more impressive was the situation around him. The Saints dealt with multiple injuries, including key offensive players like Alvin Kamara and Rashid Shaheed missing time. The team also relied on several practice squad players in the second half of the season.Despite those challenges, Shough showed calmness in the pocket, strong decision-making, and leadership beyond his rookie status.“It’s an honor to be recognized by the fans,” Shough said in a team statement. “I couldn’t have done it without my teammates and coaches supporting me all season.”When the Saints selected Shough with the 40th overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, many questioned the decision. Some believed the team reached too early for a quarterback.Shough completed 67.6 percent of his passes for 2,384 yards in his rookie season. While his numbers may not have led the league, his impact was clear. He helped transform the Saints from a struggling squad into a competitive team with hope for the future.The fan-voted award also places him in notable company. Past winners include established quarterbacks who went on to have strong NFL careers.Shough is also a finalist for the Associated Press Offensive Rookie of the Year award, which will be announced during NFL Honors. Whether or not he wins that honor, his rookie campaign has already made a strong statement.Under head coach Kellen Moore, the Saints appear to have found their quarterback of the future. With a full offseason to prepare as the clear starter, expectations will only grow.","Tyler Shough has been named the Pepsi Zero Sugar NFL Rookie of the Year.

TheBurntPeanut’s rapid Twitch rise sparks viewbotting accusations on social media,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/theburntpeanuts-rapid-twitch-rise-sparks-viewbotting-accusations-on-social-media/articleshow/127953754.cms,"Image Via YouTube

Viewbotting claims grow as TheBurntPeanut’s Twitch numbers explode

“normie”

“more dead than someone with under 500 viewers.”





Twitch streamer TheBurntPeanut is facing growing scrutiny online after a sudden and massive jump in viewership raised questions across social media. Over the past few months, the streamer has averaged more than 55,000 viewers per broadcast, with some streams peaking close to 90,000 viewers. The numbers have drawn attention not just because of their size, but because of how quickly they appeared, leading many users on X and Reddit to accuse him of viewbotting.These accusations are aimed at the claim that TheBurntPeanut is somehow using bots in order to inflate viewer count artificially, which would fall into a serious allegation in the streaming world. Critics argue that this growth does not necessarily match normal audience behavior. While no proof was given, the debate has become one of the most talked-about topics on streamer timelines.TheBurntPeanut is known for streaming games like ARC Raiders and Escape from Tarkov, and his recent success has been linked to strong performance on YouTube Shorts and other social platforms. Supporters say his short-form content helped him reach a wider, more casual audience, often referred to as thespace. They believe this explains the sudden rise in viewers without any wrongdoing.However, skeptics argue that they notice unusual patterns within his viewership. There are instances where people have pointed out streams where the number of viewers suddenly increased tremendously over a very short time from as few as zero to tens of thousands. Some people also argue that there is very little activity in his Twitch chat compared to other streams, which are much less viewed compared to his content. Just as someone said about him, the chat isDiscussions comparing the situation to past Escape from Tarkov streamer controversies have also fueled the fire. Viewbotting has been a recurring issue on Twitch for years, and past incidents have made the community quick to question sudden success stories. Still, it is important to note that no official action or statement has been made by Twitch regarding TheBurntPeanut.As it stands, the allegations are unproven, based largely on conjecture and observation online. TheBurntPeanut has not issued any public statement about the claims, and his streams remain incredibly popular. Until there is something said by Twitch or the streamer himself, the debate is sure to continue just another case of how success on the platform can easily swing into controversy.","Twitch streamer TheBurntPeanut is facing growing scrutiny online after a sudden and massive jump in viewership raised questions across social media.

Chicago Bulls vs Toronto Raptors Betting and Game Outlook (February 5, 2026)

Theon Thursday in a meeting between two teams trying to stay competitive in the Eastern Conference playoff race. Neither side has found sustained form this season, and both are dealing with roster changes that have affected continuity.This is an important game in which Chicago will be playing after multiple trades and injuries decided the rotation. On the other hand, Toronto is managing its own absences. With several regular contributors unavailable, this matchup is likely to depend on how each team deals with absences and rotation fillers rather than star power.The Chicago Bulls are adjusting to a roster that looks very different from earlier in the season.• Zach Collins - Right first-toe sprain• Ayo Dosunmu - Not with team (trade-related)• Noa Essengue - Recovering from left-shoulder surgery• Josh Giddey - Left hamstring strain• Tre Jones - Left hamstring strain• Julian Phillips - Not with team (trade-related)• Dalen Terry - Not with team (trade-related)• Nikola Vucevic - Not with team (trade-related)• Ousmane Dieng - Trade pending• Collin Sexton - Trade pendingProbable / Expected to Play• Jaden Ivey - ProbableChicago is expected to rely more on younger guards, and the frontcourt depth is limited.Toronto Raptors is also dealing with availability issues, particularly in the paint.• RJ Barrett - Managed right-knee sprain• Jakob Poeltl - Lower-back strain• Chucky Hepburn - G League assignment• A.J. Lawson - G League assignment• Ayo Dosunmu - Bilateral quad-tendon issue• Tre Jones - Left hamstring strainWithout Barrett and Poeltl, Toronto loses a primary scorer on the wing and its main rim protector. That places more responsibility on the backcourt.• Chicago Bulls - 4 wins• Toronto Raptors - 0 winsChicago has won each matchup by an average of about 7.5 points and has outscored Toronto by roughly 15 points per 100 possessions.• Total games: 110• Bulls wins: 61• Raptors wins: 49Chicago is 24-27, placing 10th in the East and third in the Central Division.• Points per game: ~117.2• Field-goal percentage: ~47.3%• Three-point percentage: ~36.8%• Turnovers: ~14.4Ball movement remains a strength, but the absence of Nikola Vucevic and the injury to Josh Giddey have shifted more creation to the perimeter.• Points allowed: ~120.2• Rebounds: ~45.3 (3rd in NBA)• Net rating: about -3.0The Bulls rebound well but have struggled defensively, especially around the rim and on perimeter rotations.Toronto is close to the .500 mark with results largely driven by defense.• Points per game: mid-110s• Three-point shooting: roughly 34-35%• Assists: just over 28The offense relies on pick-and-roll sets and transition scoring, but outside shooting and turnovers have limited efficiency.• Points allowed per 100 possessions: around 113-114• Net rating: slightly positiveToronto defends the perimeter effectively, though Poeltl’s absence reduces interior protection.With Giddey, Jones, and Collins out, Chicago will depend on Jaden Ivey and its remaining ball-handlers to attack the defense and create second-chance opportunities. The Bulls’ rebounding advantage could matter against a smaller Toronto lineup.Toronto is likely to push the pace and force contested shots. Defensive communication and help coverage will be important without a traditional interior anchor.Rebounding and second-chance points favor Chicago, while Toronto may attempt more three-pointers despite a lower percentage. Based on the season series and current injuries, the spread is expected to lean slightly toward the Bulls.Both teams enter the game dealing with lineup changes and missing players. Chicago has controlled the season series, but Toronto’s defense has kept games competitive. The result may come down to which team handles the rotation gaps more effectively and executes late in the game.","Chicago Bulls host Toronto Raptors on February 5, 2026. The Bulls are 24-27, placing 10th in the East and third in the Central Division. The Raptors have won just one of their last five games.

Forget Victoria Secret, the real action this Super Bowl week is happening on the sand. Sports Illustrated just dropped its February 2026 digital issue, and it’s a full-blown takeover by the NFL’s most powerful partners. But don't call them ""plus-ones,"" the magazine is officially rebranding the ""WAG"" label, proving that while their husbands play for rings, these women are busy building empires.SI didn't settle for one cover star, they give six individual digital covers featuring a heavy-hitting lineup of entrepreneurs, athletes, and artists:This issue leans heavily into the ""real life"" behind the glam. Ronika Love stole the headlines by posing for her cover while pregnant, a move she called her ""most powerful season yet."" She also threw out the best quote of the shoot, suggesting that if they are WAGs, the men should be called ""HABs"" (Husbands and Boyfriends).Meanwhile, Christen Goff made her return to the magazine just seven months after giving birth to her daughter, Romy, in July 2025. She used her feature to talk about the ""transformative"" confidence of motherhood, marking a shift for SI toward celebrating the diverse stages of a woman's life.Shot by photographer Katherine Goguen at the South Seas Resort on Captiva Island, the fashion was a ""kitschy"" nod to the NFL. Every model wore custom pieces in their partner's team colors, think Steelers Gold for Normani and Chiefs Red for Brittany. It was a clever way to bridge the gap between their independent brands and their famous Sunday sidelines.This issue effectively kills the ""trophy wife"" trope, replacing it with a group of women who are launching tequila brands, winning volleyball matches, and owning pro sports teams.","Sports Illustrated just released its February 2026 digital issue.

T20 World Cup | 'Our flight is booked and we are going' - Suryakumar Yadav on Pakistan's boycott

The impasse over the India-Pakistan T20 WC match showed no signs of being resolved, after Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif weighed in on the issue, calling their boycott of the February 15 match against India in Colombo an “appropriate decision”. It was a “considered stance” to support Bangladesh, he said.“We have taken a very clear stand on the T20 World Cup that we won’t play the match against India because there should be no politics on the sports field. We have taken a very considered stance, and we should completely stand by Bangladesh, and I think this is a very appropriate decision. We are with Bangladesh,” the PM said.Meanwhile, Bangladesh Youth and Sports Advisor Asif Nazrul acknowledged Sharif’s decision. “Thank you, Pakistan,” Nazrul wrote in a social media post.As the start of this contentious World Cup nears, speaking at a pre-tournament captain’s press conferences from two different locations – Mumbai’s BCCI headquarters and from Colombo — both teams’ captains broke their silence on the issue.“We haven’t refused to play against Pakistan. They have refused. The mindset is pretty clear. We have not said no, it has come from them,” India skipper Suryakumar Yadav said.“The ICC has given a fixture, BCCI and the (Indian) govt has decided with the ICC on playing at a neutral venue. Our flight is booked for Colombo and we are going,” he added.Salman Ali Agha, his Pakistani opposite number, said, “The India game is not in our control. It’s the govt’s and PCB’s decision and we respect that. Whatever they are going to say, we will do that.”“If we have to play them again in the semifinal or final, we will have to go back to them (govt) and act on their advice,” added the Pakistan skipper. The Indian captain acknowledged that the situation is “not easy” for those involved in the issue, including the ICC.“I feel it is not an easy job. It is not my call. I am sure they (the ICC) might be working out something as well but it has come from the other govt or the nation, how can they (the ICC) help as well? Their (Pakistan’s) decision is not in my control. I wish I could take their decisions, but then it is their call,” said Suryakumar.“We have been told that we have to play a game in Colombo on Feb 15th. We played them three times in the Asia Cup, we played some good cricket. We won (all the matches) and we were very happy. Similarly, if we get an opportunity in Colombo, we will definitely play,” he added.Earlier, Inter national Cricket Council (ICC) had expressed serious concerns over the Pakistan govt’s decision.“This position of selective participation is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental premise of a global sporting event where all qualified teams are expected to compete on equal terms per the event schedule,” it had said. “This decision is not in the interest of the global game or the welfare of fans worldwide.”","Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif calls their boycott of the February 15 match against India in Colombo an “appropriate decision’ India captain Suryakumar Yadav: “The ICC has given a fixture, BCCI and the (Indian) govt has decided with the ICC on playing at a neutral venue”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127969189,imgsize-493153,width-400,resizemode-4/india-vs-pakistan.jpg"

NHL Insider reveals how Los Angeles Kings were able to secure Artemi Panarin after frantic bidding war,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-insider-reveals-how-los-angeles-kings-were-able-to-secure-artemi-panarin-after-frantic-bidding-war/articleshow/127942936.cms,"Artemi Panarin with the Rangers (Via Getty Images)

Los Angeles Kings remained clear favorites to secure Artemi Panarin despite multiple contenders

Artemi Panarin is headed to Los Angeles. The deal is done. The 34-year-old winger will join the Kings on a two-year contract worth $22 million after the Rangers finally moved their franchise player. But the path to get there was absolute chaos.Multiple teams pursued Panarin aggressively as the trade deadline approached. The Florida Panthers and Tampa Bay Lightning were at the top of his wish list, with Florida especially appealing to the veteran forward. Neither worked out. Now one insider reveals how LA sealed the deal.According to Sportsnet's Elliotte Friedman, those discussions never gained serious traction despite the mutual interest. Panarin's focus shifted to the West Coast. The idea of reuniting with Joel Quenneville in Anaheim held appeal, but the Ducks refused to commit to an extension.San Jose showed interest, though the extent of those talks remains unclear. ""From the beginning, they were nervous about the term on an extension for the 34-year-old winger,"" Friedman said of the Kings. ""But the two sides were discussing something in the $45 million range.""Then everything fell apart Tuesday. Los Angeles walked away from negotiations. Panarin's agent, Paul Theofanous, contacted several teams to create a bidding war, and word spread quickly about Carolina and another team willing to pay $60 million on a four-year deal with a $15 million cap hit.The Seattle Kraken emerged as a major player with an aggressive bid. Multiple sources indicated Seattle offered a four-year extension with an average annual value higher than Leon Draisaitl's $14 million.""We had discussions with Paul Theofanous just like numerous other teams,"" Kraken general manager Jason Botterill said. ""We will continue to be aggressive at improving our team."" In addition to them, the Capitals and the Hurricanes also remained in contention, with the Mammoth also showing their interest in the 34-year-old.But Panarin made his choice clear Wednesday when he told the Rangers he would only waive his no-movement clause for Los Angeles. The Kings re-engaged and landed on the two-year, $22 million structure they were comfortable with.Panarin wanted California badly enough that he may have left $30 million on the table. The Kings sit at 23-17-14 and occupy a wildcard position in the Western Conference.They return from the Olympic break on February 25 against Vegas before hosting Edmonton the following night in a crucial Pacific Division matchup that could define their playoff positioning down the stretch.","Artemi Panarin is headed to Los Angeles.

Moise Kouame announced his arrival on the big stage at the 2026 Open Occitanie in Montpellier. At only 16 years of age, the French teenager became the sixth-youngest player to reach an ATP main draw since 2000. It was a landmark moment that has placed him alongside famous names like Rafael Nadal , Richard Gasquet, and Ryan Harrison.Kouame entered the tournament through the qualifiers after strong results on the ITF circuit. His debut ended in a first-round defeat. However, the experience marked a big step forward in his young career. His performance and recent results suggest that he is a player to watch closely in the coming years.Moise Kouame arrived in Montpellier with confidence after winning titles at ITF Bressuire and ITF Hazebrouck. Those victories earned him a place in the qualifying rounds, where he booked a spot in his first ATP main draw. His tournament ended with a three-set loss to Aleksandar Kovacevic, who won 7-6(5), 2-6, 2-6. Despite the defeat, Kouame showed maturity.After the match, Kouame explained that the opening set demanded huge physical effort. Speaking in the post match conference, he said that the atmosphere and crowd support made the experience special and helped push him through difficult moments.He admitted that the final two sets were more challenging physically, but felt the match clearly showed areas where he needs to improve. According to him, the intensity on court was enjoyable, and he hopes to return stronger and compete deeper in future events.Kouame’s progress in recent weeks has been impressive. Ranked outside the top 800 in January, he has already moved into the top 650. He is currently the youngest player inside the ATP top 1000. His rise has drawn comparisons to Rafael Nadal, who made his ATP debut at a similar age, though Nadal famously won his first match in Mallorca in 2002.Beyond Montpellier, Kouame has been gaining experience at major events. He competed in singles and doubles in Paris last year and pushed hard in qualifying rounds. He also attempted to qualify for the Madrid Open, where he faced tough opposition.Tennis also runs in the family. His older brother, Michael Kouame, is a professional player as well, though he is still waiting for his ATP Tour debut. For Moise Kouame, Montpellier may have ended early, but his journey is clearly just beginning.","Moise Kouame made his ATP Tour debut at the 2026 Open Occitanie in Montpellier.

New England Patriots injury update: Drake Maye and Harold Landry III head the list ahead of Super Bowl LX

The New England Patriots are officially on the clock, and it's not about just the kickoff for Super Bowl LX. With their massive showdown against the Seattle Seahawks at Levi’s Stadium just days away, the focus has shifted from the playbook to the training room. The team just dropped their latest injury report, and it’s a bit of a mixed bag for fans in Foxborough. While some big names are back on the field, others are still struggling to get healthy before Sunday’s flight to Santa Clara.This game is a huge deal, it’s a rematch of that classic 2015 Super Bowl, and the Patriots are gunning for a record-breaking seventh title. But to get there, they need their stars at 100%. According to the official team report, five key players are currently being monitored. The good news? The energy at practice has been high, but there are still some nervous ""will they or won't they"" vibes hanging over a few position groups.The biggest sigh of relief this week came when Drake Maye was listed as a full participant in Wednesday’s practice. The 23-year-old quarterback has been nursing a right shoulder injury that gave everyone a scare after the AFC Championship win. He’s been really open about it, though, telling NFL.com, ""I feel good.I'll be just fine. I threw as much as I would at a normal practice."" It’s a massive relief because Maye is about to become the youngest QB to start a Super Bowl since the legendary Dan Marino back in 1985.While Maye looks ready to go, the defense is a bit more of a puzzle. Linebacker Harold Landry III has been dealing with a nagging knee issue that kept him out of the win against the Denver Broncos. He was back this week but only as a limited participant. It’s a similar story for offensive tackle Thayer Munford Jr., who is also limited with a knee injury. On the brighter side, defensive tackle Joshua Farmer seems to have put his hamstring troubles behind him, practicing fully and looking like a lock for Sunday.The real wildcard is captain Robert Spillane. He’s struggling with an ankle injury and was the only one on the list who didn't practice at all on Wednesday. Even though he told NFL Network he’s ""100% confident"" he’ll play, sitting out practice this late in the week is always a red flag. The Patriots have a deep roster, but losing a leader like Spillane right before facing a tough Seahawks offense is the last thing they want.","Drake Maye and Harold Landry III head the list ahead of Super Bowl LX.

Strategic Recruitment and Financial Realities



Lebron James’s stable with Los Angeles Lakers

The Cleveland Cavaliers have shown the intention to shift gears into winning mode after acquiring James Harden in a blockbuster deal that sent the 26-year-old Darius Garland and a 2026 second-round pick to the Los Angeles Clippers. The 11-time All-Star joining Donovan Mitchell has sparked some immediate speculations about LeBron James’ third homecoming.By moving Garland ($39.4 million) and acquiring Dennis Schröder and Keon Ellis (combined $16.4 million) from the Kings in exchange for De'Andre Hunter ($23.3 million), the Cavs have generated approximately $50 million in potential cap space, as per ESPN's Bobby Marks. With Donovan Mitchell and Harden on the roster, this financial flexibility allows the Cavaliers to pursue LeBron James if he enters free agency this summer.In a recent report by ESPN’s Dave McMenamin, it was stated, “Multiple team and league sources told ESPN the Cavaliers would gladly welcome James back this summer if he wanted to return to Cleveland for his 24th NBA season and third stint with the team.”With the Cavaliers willing to complete the trio of LeBron James, Donovan Mitchell, and James Harden, all there’s left is the King James nod. Cavalier Nation in a tweet said, “Sources tell us that Donovan Mitchell and James Harden are expected to recruit LeBron to the Cavs in the offseason.”The 29-year-old Mitchell is currently averaging the league’s 6th-best PPG, 28.8 points, along with 5.9 assists and 4.6 rebounds while shooting at a 48.4% efficiency from the floor. He remains the Cavs' cornerstone. But with Harden’s addition, who was averaging 25.4 points, 4.8 rebounds, 1.3 steals, and 8.1 assists (3rd best this season) while shooting 41.9% from the floor for the Clippers, the roster will have a veteran master who would complement Cleveland’s elite frontcourt of Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen.The prospects to join such a team would be tempting, but for LeBron James, a return would require him to wave goodbye to his current financial situation. Even at 41, James is playing on a $52.6 million pay slip with a player option that becomes active next season. Analysts Joe Vardon and Jason Lloyd of The Athletic wrote, “LeBron James’ salary would not be close to the $52.6 million he's earning now in Los Angeles, but at age 41, he is aware of the market realities facing him if he extends his career. ”Despite the growing momentum. LeBron James’ immediate exit from the West Coast is off the table. According to ESPN’s Dave McMenamin, James is expected to finish the 2025-26 season with the Los Angeles Lakers as he maintains a full no-trade clause that grants him total control over his next destination.The Lakers are at 6th with a 30-19 record. With Luka Doncic’s arrival, the Lakers have gotten themselves an offensive maverick as he is currently leading the league in PPG with 33.4.The Cleveland Cavaliers are 4th in the East with a 31-21 record. With the addition of Harden, an offensive roster upgrade is expected.",The Cleveland Cavaliers have shown the intention to shift gears into winning mode after acquiring James Harden in a blockbuster deal that sent the 26-year- old Darius Garland and a 2026 second-round pick to the Los Angeles Clippers.

Daniel Cormier on Conor McGregor’s comeback challenges



Ariel Helwani hopes for a possible Conor McGregor vs. Paddy Pimblett fight



Conor McGregor is undoubtedly one of the wealthiest MMA fighters in the world. After changing their lives and enjoying a luxury lifestyle, many fighters would rather avoid octagon action. Is that the same in McGregor’s situation as well? Daniel Cormier, a member of the UFC Hall of Fame, has responded to that. After losing to Dustin Poirier in 2021, ""The Notorious"" has been away from the UFC octagon since. Although he was expected to make a comeback and fight Michael Chandler at UFC 303, McGregor had to withdraw due to an injury. That was in the year 2024. And to this date, the Irishman is yet to step inside the UFC Octagon. Amid that, McGregor has been involved in business pursuits to increase his share of prosperity.“Here’s the thing about Conor, though: obviously, Conor has started to live the gimmick a little bit, right? He lives like Ric Flair. Do you all think Conor will fight again? Do you think he can pull himself away from all that lifestyle?” Daniel Cormier wanted to know whether co-hosts Shannon Sharpe and Chad Johnson believe Conor McGregor will make a comeback to fighting.He further analyzed the harsh reality of McGregor’s alleged hesitation to return to the Octagon. “I fought in front of millions of people in my underwear. You got some shorts and all gloves, so nothing makes me nervous anymore, right?” Cormier stated during the Nightcap show. “But to do that as a very, very rich man? Yes, and get hit and get kneed and elbowed. But what if you get cut? You start going. God, I don’t really need to do this anymore. ”McGregor's business portfolio expanded considerably as well. Amid that, he still wants to compete, as he hopes to make a comeback to the historic UFC White House card. Although the potential opponent for ""The Notorious"" has not yet been determined, an MMA journalist names a fighter apt for the Irishman’s return.The moment the UFC White House event was confirmed by President Donald Trump, Conor McGregor was among the first individuals to express their desire to compete on the card. And for that, the matchmaking around McGregor’s possible opponent could be tough. However, MMA analyst Ariel Helwani thinks that Paddy Pimblett may be an interesting matchup.“The big fish for the White House card is Conor McGregor, right? That’s the big dog; that’s the big draw,” said Helwani on his show. “If [McGregor] is involved, I can see a scenario where it’s him vs. Paddy.”Recently, Pimblett defeated Justin Gaethje at UFC 324. In that fight, he also lost out on winning the interim lightweight title. Currently, ‘The Baddy’ is scheduled to be suspended due to his sustained injuries. However, he might be cleared for the White House event, which is expected to take place on June 14.","""The Notorious"" has been away from the UFC octagon since losing to Dustin Poirier in 2021.

Tom Brady explains how he talks to Benjamin Brady on Instagram and what being a good father means to him



Tom Brady may be done playing football, but he is still very active as a dad. This week, the retired NFL star opened up about how he talks to his kids, especially online. Brady, 48, appeared with his 16-year-old son, Benjamin Brady, on Instagram’s show Instagram Carversations. The two spoke openly about social media, messages, and how they stay connected as father and son.Instead of talking about football, the focus stayed on everyday life. Brady explained what he sends his son in private messages and why he does it. Benjamin also shared what he sends his dad and how their chats feel very normal, not serious or strict. The moment gave fans a rare look at Brady as a parent first, not a sports legend. It also showed how he tries to guide his kids in a digital world without forcing rules.During the conversation, Benjamin said he usually sends funny and random videos to his dad. Brady laughed and agreed. Still, he explained that his own messages come from a different place.“I think it’s funny to send you some goofy stuff on occasion,” Brady told his son. “But I think for the most part, if I’m going to share stuff with you, I want you to look at it and see a real value in it. Like, ‘Why would Dad send me that?’”Later, Brady asked Benjamin what he would do if he had access to his father’s Instagram for one day.Benjamin did not hesitate. He joked that he would message clothing brands and famous musicians.“All right, so first of all, I want some cool clothes. I’m going to DM some really cool businesses, some really cool people, maybe like Travis Scott, Drake, some musicians I like,” Benjamin said. “I’ll be like, ‘Hey, I need some clothes. I’m going to this thing. Make sure it’s a size smaller, though. I’ve started losing some muscle recently.’”“So you’re going to pretend like you’re me?” Brady replied.“Yeah! I’m going to be you,” Benjamin said.Brady is a father to three children. He shares his oldest son, Jack, 18, with actress Bridget Moynahan. He also shares Benjamin and daughter Vivian, 13, with his former wife Gisele Bündchen.In a July post from his weekly newsletter, Brady also reflected on parenting. He wrote, “I think part of being a great father is being a great example of doing what it takes to take care of your family.” He added that being present is not just about bedtime stories. “Your children are watching everything,” he wrote. “Being a great football player didn’t make me a great dad, but how I became a great player certainly had an impact. ”","Tom Brady opened up about how he talks to his kids, especially online.

Ilia Topuria’s legal settlement clears the path for a UFC return and possible Justin Gaethje fight

Ilia Topuria is back in full training, and the biggest roadblock in his career is now out of the way. The UFC lightweight champion has reached a legal agreement with his ex-wife, Giorgina Uzcategui, bringing an end to a dispute that pushed him away from the Octagon late last year. The deal was first reported by Marca and later confirmed by TMZ Sports.After weeks of silence, Topuria gave fans a clear signal on Thursday when he shared a photo from the gym on Instagram. His message was short but clear: “The Champ is back!!!” According to TMZ Sports, the 155-pound champion actually returned to training weeks ago. While no fight date is set yet, all signs now point toward a comeback sometime in mid-2026. For the UFC, this timing could not be better, as the lightweight division is already heating up.The agreement closes a chapter that began in December 2025, when Ilia Topuria announced he was stepping away from fighting. At that time, he said he was facing false domestic abuse claims tied to financial demands. In a public response to a lawsuit filed by Giorgina Uzcategui, Topuria said, “This evidence has been submitted to the appropriate judicial authorities in order to pursue legal action for attempted extortion, falsification of evidence, misappropriation of funds and personal property, and multiple threats.With the settlement now in place, that lawsuit is no longer a factor. Sources told TMZ Sports that Topuria is focused only on training and moving forward with his career. The UFC also stands to gain from his return. Less than two weeks ago, Justin Gaethje was named interim lightweight champion after a brutal fight with Paddy Pimblett at the UFC 324 main event.There is already talk about where Topuria could fit next. The UFC has a major event planned at the White House on June 14. Dana White told Babcock that the promotion would start building that fight card the Monday after UFC 324. With Topuria training again and Gaethje holding interim gold, a matchup between the two would make sense and draw massive attention. For now, fans will have to wait, but Ilia Topuria’s return to the Octagon feels closer than it has in months.","Ilia Topuria has reached a legal agreement with his ex-wife, Giorgina Uzcategui.

Largest raise in MLB history: Tarik Skubal beats Tigers in landmark $32M arbitration win,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/largest-raise-in-mlb-history-tarik-skubal-beats-tigers-in-landmark-32m-arbitration-win/articleshow/127952857.cms,"Tarik Skubal (Image Source: Getty)

Tarik Skubal sets a new standard in arbitration

What the ruling means for the Detroit Tigers and MLB

This is a monumental win for two-time American League Cy Young Award winner Tarik Skubal, and one that will resonate throughout Major League Baseball for many seasons to come. According to ESPN’s Jeff Pasan, Skubal had a huge win in salary arbitration, taking home $32 million from the Detroit Tigers for the 2026 season, marking the largest single-year arbitration salary in MLB history after months of failing to come to an agreement. It is also the largest year-to-year increase for a player through the arbitration process.That was the end of the story after a long-drawn stalemate between player and club. The Tigers filed at $19 million, and Skubal's camp argued that his top-shelf production was worthy of a much bigger number. MLB arbitration rules state that the panel will have only the two numbers presented and cannot compromise. Ultimately, the panel ruled entirely in favor of Skubal, giving the star left-hander a huge win and resetting the market for top-end starters.His $32 million bounty officially obliterates the previously marked territory for arb-eligible players. The previous record was held by outfielder Juan Soto, who made $31 million in arbitration for the 2024 season. In the case of pitchers, the old mark was the $19.75 million salary David Price received from Detroit over a decade ago. Skubal may have blown that ceiling higher than ever.Also, as important as the magnitude of the raise that Skubal got.Compared to his 2025 salary of $10.15 million, it equates to an increase of $21.055 million in a single year, by far the largest jump in arbitration history. Until now, the highest raise for a pitcher, $9.6 million, belonged to Jacob deGrom. That number, of course, is dwarfed by the one Skubal posted recently in his last two seasons, which were so dominant.On purely the merit of his on-field prowess, the left-hander made a strong case for himself. In 2025, he turned in one of the best seasons in recent memory, racking up a brilliant 2.21 ERA with 241 hitters in 195+ innings. And with a pair of Cy Young Awards and then some, Skubal walked into the arbitration hearing with foundational credentials seldom seen from someone still in his pre-free-agency years.It's a painful outcome for the Tigers. Arbitration has a file-and-try policy at the club; once figures are swapped, it doesn't negotiate. And that strategy rendered the organization vulnerable to precisely this type of decision. Now, Detroit is giving its ace a mammoth one-year deal as he approaches free agency in his final season before the eventual payday.The ruling is sure to have league-wide ramifications. That will cause agents and players to continue to reference Skubal's case as evidence that arbitration panels are no longer reluctant to reward performance at record levels among the very elite of the sport. Now, a major impetus for teams could be to ink big-name talents to multi-year deals prior to making it this far in the process.","Detroit Tigers ace Tarik Skubal was awarded $32 million in salary arbitration.

Are India favourites to win 2026 T20 World Cup? | Greenstone Lobo makes a HUGE PREDICTION

NEW DELHI: India all-rounder Tilak Varma marked a spirited return from injury with an impactful performance and an emotional message of gratitude after the defending champions defeated South Africa by 30 runs in their T20 World Cup warm-up match at the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai on Wednesday.Fresh from rehabilitation, Tilak admitted he did not expect to be back in action so soon and credited the BCCI and the Centre of Excellence (CoE) for accelerating his recovery. “To be honest, I did not expect that I will be back on the field this early. Really thankful for CoE and BCCI. I always say that playing the World Cup is my biggest dream,” he said in a video shared by the BCCI.Walking into a packed stadium chanting his name gave the youngster an emotional lift. “When I entered the ropes and everyone was shouting ‘Tilak, Tilak,’ I really felt nice. It boosted me a lot,” he added, describing the electric atmosphere even during a warm-up game.Inspired by the aggressive intent around him, Tilak said the team’s batting energy pushed him to play freely. “The way Ishan was batting, the way Abhishek and everyone was going, I was also like, ‘Mai bhi maarunga jaake.’The vibe was really terrific, and yeah — Tilak and the Indian team is ready for the World Cup,” he said.On the field, Tilak backed up his words with a brisk 45 off 19 balls as India piled up 240 for five, building on Ishan Kishan ’s explosive start. The bowlers then held their nerve to restrict South Africa to 210, sealing a confident win.With his comeback timed perfectly, Tilak’s return has added fresh energy to India’s campaign as they shift focus to their World Cup opener against the USA on Saturday.",Tilak Varma scores 45 as India beat South Africa by 30 runs in T20 World Cup warm-up match in Navi Mumbai.

Elevated solar activity keeps auroras visible across high-latitude regions



Solar activity continues to feed the auroral system



























How aurora maps show intensity and location



Visibility can extend far beyond the oval





Solar activity remains elevated this week, shaped largely by one persistent sunspot region and the steady stream of solar material it has released. Measurements from the US Space Weather Prediction Center show continued flare activity and a disturbed solar wind passing Earth. None of it points to extreme geomagnetic storms, but it is enough to keep the upper atmosphere active. Currently, the effects primarily manifest near the poles. NOAA describes the situation as fluid rather than dramatic. Where auroras might be visible depends on timing, darkness, and whether the sky cooperates during long winter nights across the north.Auroras are expected to stay largely confined from 5th to 7th February to high-latitude regions, including Alaska, northern Canada, Greenland, and parts of Scandinavia. These places sit under the usual auroral oval and tend to respond first when Earth’s magnetic field becomes unsettled. Even modest disturbances can produce visible light there, though nothing is guaranteed. Clear skies still matter, as does darkness. Space weather can create the necessary conditions, but cloud cover or daylight can also abruptly end the spectacle.The present pattern traces back to ongoing activity from a single dominant sunspot group.Over recent days, it has produced several strong flares and several eruptions that sent charged particles outward. Some of that material has already brushed past Earth, stirring the magnetic field slightly. The effects are mild, not the kind that trigger major storms, but enough to keep energy flowing into the upper atmosphere, where auroras take shape.Forecast maps usually show auroral activity as a green oval wrapped around Earth’s magnetic pole. That shape marks where displays are most likely. When conditions become more active, the oval brightens and can shift in colour, sometimes turning red to signal stronger intensity. The same maps also show daylight areas in lighter tones, a reminder that auroras are hidden when the Sun is up. Most viewing happens after sunset or before sunrise, in the quieter edges of night.Auroras do not always need to be overhead. When displays brighten, they can sometimes be seen from far outside the main oval, appearing low along the horizon from hundreds of kilometres away. These moments are brief and depend on many small factors coming together. For now, the activity looks steady rather than expansive, keeping most auroras anchored to far northern skies, with occasional hints rather than wide-reaching displays.","Auroras expected to stay largely confined from 5th to 7th February to high- latitude regions, including Alaska, northern Canada, Greenland, and parts of Scandinavia.

Suryakumar Yadav press conference: on the India vs Pakistan clash, T20I world cup preps & Washington Sundar injury

85.71% - Rohit’s success percentage in T20 World Cups, the best among captains who have led in 10+ matches.

2 - Rohit is one of only two players to have appeared in the first nine editions of the T20 World Cup between 2007 and 2024, the other being Bangladesh’s Shakib Al Hasan. Rohit also has the most appearances in the T20 WC (47) followed by Shakib’s 43 matches.

1 - Rohit is the only cricketer to win the T20 World Cup both as player (2007) and captain (2024).

9 - Series won by India, including the last 8 in a row, out of 10 T20I series played under Suryakumar Yadav since Nov 2023. The two-match series vs South Africa in South Africa in Dec 2023 ended in a draw.

165.48 - Suryakumar’s strike rate is the highest among batters with 3000+ runs in T20Is.

MUMBAI: When Team India lines up for the National Anthem at the Wankhede Stadium prior to their T20 World Cup opener against USA on Saturday, they will be watching former captain Rohit Sharma place the coveted trophy — which he lifted on June 29, 2024 in Barbados — on the podium. Rohit is the tournament ambassador for this edition of the World Cup.While his selfless explosiveness as opener is being probably matched by another Sharma, in Abhishek, one wonders whether Rohit, who has been part of every T20 World Cup since 2007, will be missed more as a leader. Of course, under Suryakumar Yadav too, India have built up a stellar record in the shortest format.In a pressure-soaked environment of a home World Cup though, Rohit, who often was the zen architect with excellent man-management skills, coupled with tactical empathy for his bowlers and clutch composure, will probably be on SKY’s speed dial during the course of the event.Former India pacer and bowling coach Paras Mhambrey , who combined superbly with head coach Rahul Dravid and skipper Rohit Sharma for three ICC events (2022 T20 WC, 2023 ODI WC and 2024 T20 WC), feels the current regime’s pragmatic approach is based on the reality that Rohit is not with the squad. “The question of missing him does not arise.”Mhambrey, though, hails the impact of Rohit the captain, especially when India ended an 11-year ICC trophy drought in the USA and West Indies.He also endorsed Jasprit Bumrah’s views of Rohit as a “bowler’s captain”, who allows the bowlers to set fields and steps in only when their plans do not work. Paras explains the reasons why he became such a bowler’s captain, despite being such a destructive and classy opening batter who prioritised impact over milestones.“He was completely involved during bowlers’ meetings. When you’re the captain and are playing a World Cup, there’s so many other things happening. Yet, he gave so much of his time to the bowlers and to us as coaches. He was there for discussions. That gave us great communication on the field, knowing the captain was very clear with plans. The bowlers were locked in on them too. If things didn’t work out, he h a d o p t i o n s ready. And what really makes great captains is instincts to read situations and rely on an option which is contrary to the popular one.”That perhaps explains the way he rotated his resources in two high-stakes encounters in the 2024 T20 WC. In the defence of 119 in the league phase vs Pakistan in New York, he kept holding Bumrah back rather than use him up in desperate search of wickets on a pitch that had begun to ease out. Conversely, in the final, when South Africa needed 30 off 30 balls with six wickets left in Barbados, he used Bumrah in the 16th and 18th over, rather than waiting for him to bowl the 18th and 20th.Paras feels the bowlers and the team look for calmness in the leader when things are not going well, and that is something which Rohit gave them. “Rohit is not very expressive and exudes a calm body language. That dilutes pressure and stops it from getting transferred to the bowler. In that game vs Pakistan, despite him wanting the bowlers to defend 120 and look for wickets, he never looked desperate.”Apart from prioritising high batting tempo in the powerplay, the Rohit-Rahul Dravid era will also go down in history probably as India’s most data-driven think-tank. Paras conforms to that view and highlights how Rohit often called Hari Prasad Mohan, the analyst, late at night before games during the WC, saying he needed data on some player.“Another fab guy, Hari, who worked very hard behind the scenes. During conversations, he used to often tell me and Rahul: ‘Rohit called me late at night, wanting a particular bit of data.’ Just shows how much Rohit was thinking all the time,” Paras stresses.The challenge, though, in team environments is often making people see your point of view or buy into what plans you have. Data, something which Rohit was heavily invested in, was one aspect. How did he make others accept the fact that data is important and filter it in a way that did not complicate things? “I don’t think anyone told him that they weren’t comfortable with data,” reveals Paras, and adds that he had the gift of filtering information in a way that the bowlers felt comfortable using. “Maybe, individual X wanted to know four points. Someone else wanted to know only two, depending on what stage of the game he was bowling and to whom. He addressed both quite well.”While SKY has imbibed most things from Rohit’s captaincy style, Paras feels it would be wrong to compare individuals. “When you entrust a captain with responsibility, you got to allow him to function the way he wants. Not every game will run the way you want it to run, but as long as you are consistent with your thought processes, things should be fine.”—Stats: Rajesh Kumar",Rohit Sharma is the only cricketer to win the T20 World Cup both as player (2007) and captain (2024) Rohit is one of only two players to have appeared in the first nine editions of the T 20 World Cup between 2007 and 2024.

India batters destruct | End of Ishan Kishan vs Sanju Samson

Mumbai: Devdutt Padikkal has played enough domestic cricket to understand the importance of not letting Mumbai batters settle. That is exactly what he expects from his Karnataka bowling unit when two of the most successful sides in Ranji Trophy history lock horns in the quarterfinals at the MCA ground in BKC from Friday.“They always come up with guys who can bat long, and that’s something we must be aware of. We need to get those early wickets because once they get set, it’s very hard to get them out,” said Karnataka skipper Padikkal, who expects the likes of Prasidh Krishna and Shreyas Gopal to go hard from word go.His task may have become a tad easier with Mumbai once again forced to rejig their batting order. While they will be boosted by the return of Yashasvi Jaiswal at the top of the order, the 42-time champions are fretting over the fitness of Sarfaraz Khan, who was hospitalised with viral fever on Thursday. The team management will take a call on his participation before the toss.Mumbai will also be without Suved Parkar, who scored fifties in the last two matches and was involved in a crucial partnership with Siddhesh Lad that helped the home side take a first-innings lead against Delhi in their last group game. The right-handed batter broke his finger and had to undergo surgery.If Sarfaraz fails to take the field, Jaiswal and Lad will have to carry the line-up on their shoulders.In his only match this season, Jaiswal scored a century and a fifty against Rajasthan, while Lad has displayed the best form of his career, scoring 737 runs in seven matches at an average of 92.12, including five centuries—only the third Mumbai batter to achieve the feat in a Ranji season after Rusi Modi and Sachin Tendulkar.While Mumbai are left scratching their heads to get their batting line-up right, Karnataka’s spirits must be lifted by the return of Karun Nair, their top scorer this season with 614 runs in six matches at an average of 87.71, including two centuries and as many fifties. Add to that the presence of India batters Devdutt Padikkal, KL Rahul and Mayank Agarwal, who will make life difficult for the Mumbai bowlers led by Shardul Thakur and supported by Tushar Deshpande, Shams Mulani and Tanush Kotian, who returns after injury. Youngster R Smaran has also enjoyed a fabulous season, scoring 605 runs to be Karnataka’s second-highest run-getter so far.Whatever final XIs the two teams put out, there will be no let-up in intensity in the middle, as has been the case in the past, and both skippers vouch for it.Mumbai have not been able to field the same XI consistently, but captain Shardul, who himself returns to action after sitting out a couple of matches due to a niggle, feels that whoever comes into the side will be ready to tackle the challenge.“You want the same set of players playing throughout the year, but sometimes there are forced changes. At the end of the day, our preparation for the knockouts—for the big occasions—starts in the off-season, with 30–35 players going through the grind for nearly three months. So whoever comes in is expected to perform,” said Shardul.Padikkal, meanwhile, wants Karnataka to carry forward the momentum from their final group game against Punjab, where he led from the front with an unbeaten 120 off 85 balls as the eight-time champions chased down a 250-run target in just 27.5 overs.“Every single player stepped up for us against Punjab. Moving into the knockouts, it’s important that all those characters come out, stand up and do well for the side,” said Padikkal, who will hope to guide Karnataka to their first Ranji title since the 2014–15 season.","Karnataka and Mumbai will meet in the quarterfinals of the Ranji Trophy.

Hajj early start tied to long term planning goals





Hajj service and accommodation contracts completed





Hajj camps allocated and coordination ongoing





Focus on smoother operations during the season









Saudi authorities have moved early on preparations for the next Hajj, opening the visa process months before pilgrims begin their journey, a step aimed at tightening planning and easing pressure during the peak season.The Saudi Ministry of Hajj and Umrah has announced that visas for the 2026 Hajj season, corresponding to 1447 AH, began being issued on Sunday, February 8, which falls on Sha’ban 20. The early start places the Kingdom nearly four months ahead of the rituals, setting the tone for a more structured and predictable pilgrimage season.Officials said the advanced timeline is part of a broader push to raise service readiness and improve pilgrim comfort. The move aligns with Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 framework, which prioritises efficiency, service quality, and better crowd management across the Hajj and Umrah ecosystem.By initiating visa issuance well in advance, authorities aim to give pilgrims, service providers, and Hajj affairs offices more time to prepare, coordinate, and address logistical requirements before arrivals begin.The ministry said contracts covering all services at the holy sites for pilgrims arriving from outside the Kingdom have been finalised.Accommodation agreements in Makkah have also been completed in full through the Nusk platform, clearing a major operational milestone early in the cycle.In terms of demand, 750,000 pilgrims have registered so far. Packages have already been booked for 30,000 pilgrims directly from their home countries, reflecting early engagement with the system.Preparations at the holy sites are advancing alongside visa issuance. Around 485 camps have been allocated for international pilgrims, while 73 Hajj affairs offices have completed their basic contractual arrangements.The ministry said coordination is continuing with Hajj affairs offices and service providers both inside and outside Saudi Arabia to finalise remaining operational details and ensure consistency across services.Officials described the early visa rollout as part of a proactive approach designed to reduce last minute challenges and deliver a more organised Hajj experience.The step forms part of a wider set of organisational and technical measures already under way. These include completing service contracts at the holy sites, approving accommodation and transport agreements, and preparing and allocating camps. Together, these measures are intended to support smooth operations and improve service delivery for millions of pilgrims expected to arrive for Hajj 2026.","Saudi Arabia will begin issuing Hajj 2026 visas from February 8, four months ahead.
