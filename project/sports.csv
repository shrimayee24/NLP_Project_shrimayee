Team India are set to pocket a record-breaking sum from the International Cricket Council (ICC) following their historic victory in the Women’s World Cup 2025 final against South Africa at the DY Patil Stadium on Sunday.With the win, India not only lifted their maiden Women’s World Cup title but also secured the highest-ever prize money in the history of cricket - a whopping USD 4.48 million (Rs 39.78 crore).The amount is part of a total tournament pool of USD 13.88 million (about Rs 123 crore), which was announced by the ICC ahead of the event. This was a whopping 297 per cent increase from the USD 3.5 million purse at the 2022 edition in New Zealand.The winners’ prize of USD 4.48 million represents a 239 per cent jump from the USD 1.32 million that Australia received for winning the last edition, while runners-up South Africa will earn USD 2.24 million (Rs 19.88 crore).Each losing semi-finalist is entitled to USD 1.12 million (Rs 9.94 crore), while all eight teams were guaranteed USD 250,000 for participation, plus an additional USD 34,314 for every group-stage win.According to a PTI report, the BCCI is also considering matching the prize and bonuses that the men’s team received after their T20 World Cup 2024 win.A senior BCCI source told PTI, “The BCCI supports equal pay for men and women and hence there are lot of discussions that if our girls win the World Cup, the reward won't be anything less compared to the men's global triumph. But it isn't nice to make an announcement before they win the Cup.”The Rohit Sharma-led men’s team was awarded ₹125 crore for their T20 World Cup victory last year, a figure that could now serve as a benchmark for the women’s side following their landmark success.As the celebrations continue in Navi Mumbai, India’s triumph, and the record prize it brings marks a defining moment for women’s cricket and reflects the ICC’s stated goal of “a world-class Women’s Cricket World Cup” and “a clear commitment to long-term growth.”The final saw Team India women defeat Laura Wolvaardt's South Africa by 52 runs in Navi Mumbai.","India women secured a historic win at DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai to secure a record sum in prize money from the ICC.

BJP targets NC for ‘cricket scam’ as IHPL collapse sparks political firestorm in J&K,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-targets-nc-for-cricket-scam-as-ihpl-collapse-sparks-political-firestorm-in-jk/articleshow/125066634.cms,"J&K CM Omar Abdullah

BCCI sends a stern message to Mohsin Naqvi over Asia Cup trophy row

SRINAGAR: The Indian Heaven Premier League (IHPL) fiasco triggered a political uproar Monday, with opposition BJP calling it an “international disgrace” and demanding that National Conference-led J&K government reveal who was behind the event.“Who were these scamsters who deceived umpires, players, and those who participated in the cultural programmes?” BJP spokesperson Altaf Thakur asked in Srinagar alongside party colleague Sajid Yousuf Shah.The T20 league, launched with fanfare on Oct 23 to promote grassroots cricket and tourism in Kashmir, collapsed after its organisers — a non-profit called Yuva Society — fled their Srinagar hotel Saturday, leaving international players, staff, and umpires unpaid and stranded.Thakur said J&K Cricket Association (JKCA) and BCCI had confirmed they had no connection with IHPL. “Govt must clarify who invited the international cricketers to Kashmir, who brought in players from different parts of J&K, and how matches were allowed at Bakshi Stadium without proper approval,” he said.NC-led govt distanced itself from the debacle. “It was a private event, not a govt-organised one,” said sports minister Satish Sharma.“Police have launched a free and fair investigation and an FIR has been filed. All details will come to light soon.” J&K Sports Council also denied involvement, saying it had no role in the tournament.The league was announced on Sept 18, promising to run Oct 23–Nov 7. IHPL had listed 32 international players, including former West Indies star Chris Gayle, New Zealand’s Jesse Ryder, and Sri Lanka’s Thisara Perera.Official documents show govt engagement in IHPL’s preparations. An Oct 22 press release detailed a meeting chaired by divisional commissioner Anshul Garg “to take first-hand appraisal of IHPL readiness”. Garg had predicted 25,000–30,000 spectators at Bakshi Stadium and directed security forces to assist with crowd management.However, attendance was poor from the opening day. Ticket prices were slashed as stands remained empty, except for matches featuring Chris Gayle, the tournament’s biggest draw.BJP said IHPL’s collapse had dealt a blow to the region’s image. “Cricket was the only sport showing promise this year, with tourism and horticulture struggling. Many children aspired to become the next Virat Kohli, but J&K govt has played with their future,” Thakur said.","The Indian Heaven Premier League (IHPL) fiasco triggered a political uproar Monday.

Jason Kelce may be retired from the NFL, but his personality still pulls as much attention as it did when he was the unstoppable anchor of the Philadelphia Eagles. Now, with PEOPLE preparing to reveal its 2025 Sexiest Man Alive, Jason is weighing in with two surprising picks of his own.Instead of playing it safe, he went straight for star power, nominating Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson first and then gave love to a rising NFL name, rookie Cam Skattebo, who recently suffered a devastating injury. For someone who himself held the title in 2023, Jason is hilariously humble about his place in the “attractive rankings,” and is using his new fragrance launch to joke that maybe his sexy label was accidental.Jason told PEOPLE, “I just had The Rock on the podcast and it's hard to say that anybody's sexier than that.” That’s a headline in itself, because Dwayne Johnson remains one of the most influential entertainment figures on earth. And Jason knows firsthand the marketing, athleticism and charisma The Rock carries, all qualities that Sexiest Man Alive voters lean into.Jason doubled down on a more unconventional selection, adding Cam Skattebo to his list, saying, “He's sexy with the way he operates, so I respect that.” Skattebo recently earned sympathy and respect after a brutal season-ending injury.That Jason included him shows this year’s conversation isn’t just about movie-star faces, but energy, grit, and narrative.Jason has always roasted himself, even back when his own name was called by PEOPLE in 2023. When asked whether he agreed with the title back then, he famously laughed: “I'm not even the sexiest man in my family.”That authenticity is why fans keep showing up for him post-retirement. And why Jason’s Sexiest Man Alive picks, of all celebrities, almost feel like the people’s vote.",Jason Kelce has revealed his choices for PEOPLE's 2025 Sexiest Man Alive.

Who is Gemmi Schottenheimer?



How Gemmi Schottenheimer supported Brian through NFL challenges



More coverage on NFL:

In the high-stakes world of the NFL, where coaches are constantly under pressure to deliver results, few pause to notice the steady forces that keep them grounded. For Dallas Cowboys head coach Brian Schottenheimer, that unwavering force is his wife, Gemmi Schottenheimer. Her life may unfold away from the sidelines and flashing cameras, but her presence has shaped Brian’s career and family in ways only those closest to them can truly understand. Behind every play call and every move across teams, Gemmi has been the quiet constant—strong, patient, and deeply supportive.Gemmi Schottenheimer has lived through the highs and lows of the NFL lifestyle. From team changes to unexpected firings, she has been Brian’s anchor in an unpredictable profession. Before their marriage, fate brought her close to his family in a rather unusual way. While working for the Washington Redskins, Gemmi crossed paths with legendary coach Marty Schottenheimer, who happened to be Brian’s father. She recalled in a 2024 podcast with Stacey Bell, “I had not met Brian at that point. I sort of became an assistant to him [Marty] while he was trying to find one. I was on his voicemail. I did all these things and just sort of had an opportunity to watch him lead without being in the family or dating Brian.”Ironically, when she finally met Brian, she didn’t even realize who his father was. “When I met Brian, didn’t even know that he was Marty’s son in the beginning… So it was just kind of unique for me to transition into a daughter-in-law,” Gemmi said. Over the years, their relationship only grew stronger, especially during the toughest times — like when Marty was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in 2016. Through those painful moments, Gemmi held the family together, showing the same calm strength that defines her today.Life with an NFL coach demands patience and adaptability. For Gemmi, that meant managing home life, raising two children, and maintaining a sense of stability while Brian juggled long hours and constant team transitions. Her resilience shone through even during career shocks. Reflecting on tough times, she said, “The Seattle firing, you know, was definitely something we didn’t see coming. We had just won the division. And as you know, I mean, Marty was fired after a 14 and two season. So these firings, it can happen when you least expect it.”Beyond the sidelines, Gemmi’s support also extended to moments of celebration. When Brian was named Cowboys head coach in 2025, Gemmi learned the news directly from Jerry and Stephen Jones. “I got out of [Brian’s] truck and started saying, ‘Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!’ I didn’t have anyone to talk to. I was by myself, but it was really special,” she recalled.Gemmi may not wear a headset on game day, but she’s every bit a part of Brian’s success. Her quiet strength and enduring love have shaped his journey. Together, the Schottenheimers have shown that true partnership — built on trust, loyalty, and resilience — is the real foundation of greatness.","Gemmi Schottenheimer has lived through the highs and lows of the NFL lifestyle.

How Michael Irvin discovered his wife’s early-onset Alzheimer’s

“We recognized some things were going wrong with her about ten years ago… We thought it was menopause… We buried my mom. She had Alzheimer’s. My mother-in-law was living with us because she had Alzheimer’s. And now we thought my wife was going through menopause at 49 because she’s coming at 50.”

Michael Irvin On Wife Having Alzheimer's In Her 50s | CLUB SHAY SHAY

“It’s quite hard to take care of someone 24 hours a day… I have to keep a 24-hour nurse with her all the time.”

“If anyone has earned the right to stay in her house, MY WIFE HAS!!! … That I shall honour. No matter what it takes.”

Being a football legend is one thing, but facing life’s toughest plays off the field is a whole different ballgame.

At the time, they thought it might be normal aging or menopause but it soon became clear that something more serious was happening and it needed attention. His emotional revelation gives fans a glimpse of the human side of a public figure often celebrated for his athletic prowess.Talking candidly, Irvin shared:This initial uncertainty highlights how subtle the early signs of Alzheimer’s can be especially in someone so young.Very early-onset Alzheimer’s (diagnosed under 65) is rare, and Irvin’s story shows the complex emotions families face when symptoms first appear.Irvin didn’t shy away from describing the realities of caring for his wife:Balancing the responsibilities of caregiving with his public life has been a profound challenge. Yet, Irvin’s dedication never wavered. He emphasizes the emotional labor behind every decision, reflecting a side of him fans rarely see, the deep and unwavering devotion of a husband navigating one of life’s hardest battles.For Irvin, the focus has always been on Sandy’s comfort and dignity. He explained :Rather than placing her in a facility, the couple relies on a live-in caregiver to ensure Sandy remains in the home they built together. This choice underscores both love and respect, showing that Irvin’s heroics aren’t just on the football field they’re at home, too.Michael Irvin’s story is a reminder that real strength often comes in quiet, daily acts of love and care. Through sleepless nights, emotional trials, and public attention, he stands by Sandy, determined to honor her wishes and protect her dignity.

Brittany Mahomes felt the line was crossed and she wanted the public to know it

As Patrick Mahomes returns to Buffalo, the stakes are different — but emotions are always present





For most NFL spouses, game week tends to mean travel, schedules, childcare adjustments, and a flood of national attention, but for Brittany Mahomes, there’s history attached to Buffalo. And not the fun, competitive kind. Before this weekend’s Chiefs-Bills showdown, an old incident involving a Bills supporter is circulating again online, reminding fans that not every rivalry moment lives only inside the stadium walls.Brittany, who has been in the public eye alongside Patrick Mahomes since college, once publicly reacted to a fan display that crossed a major line. Now, with yet another high-stakes meeting on the schedule, the memory of that moment is once again part of the conversation.Ahead of a previous Chiefs-Bills matchup, Brittany Mahomes addressed what she considered to be one of the ugliest fan moments she had ever seen involving her family. A Kermit the Frog puppet, wearing a Patrick Mahomes No. 15 jersey, was hung publicly in Buffalo.Brittany's reaction was immediate, emotional, and blunt. “Do we remember this, Buffalo? Absolutely disgusting,” she posted. She also followed that with a pointed reminder about basic decency in sports culture, writing, “So as you go home tonight, I pray we become better people.”Those words weren’t just about trash talk. They were about human respect and they still land heavily today.Sunday's meeting wasn't just another regular season date. Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen have developed the kind of on-field rivalry that dictates national windows, defines postseason eras, and fuels nonstop football debate. Kansas City enters with momentum. Buffalo enters with swagger. Both enter with pressure.And on the periphery of all that football energy sits a memory from November 2024, a moment Brittany Mahomes hasn’t forgotten, and clearly never wanted normalized. It proves one thing: rivalries can be electric. But respect still matters, especially when the entire world is watching.Also Read: “A sad, pathetic, nobody loser”: Swifties unleash fury on Kayla Nicole after Halloween stunt reignites drama with Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift","Brittany Mahomes publicly condemned a disrespectful Kermit the Frog puppet mocking Patrick Mahomes, urging for basic decency.

Blake Treinen’s tribute hat photo sparks Charlie Kirk confusion after Dodgers’ World Series win

Social media users wrongly claim Blake Treinen wore the Charlie Kirk hat in the World Series

A new rumor about Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Blake Treinen spread online after the team’s World Series win on Saturday, November 1, 2025. The claim said Treinen wore a hat with “Charlie Kirk” written on it during the World Series celebration. But this claim is false. The viral picture that started it all was not from the World Series.It was from a September 12 game against the San Francisco Giants, weeks before the championship series. The image began circulating after a Facebook post by user Scott Mandel falsely said Treinen wore the hat “during the World Series.” Several pages, including The Dodgers TOP, then reposted the same image, spreading the wrong information further.The photo is real, but it’s old. During the September 12, 2025 game in San Francisco, Blake Treinen wore a special white hat with “Charlie Kirk” written on it and two small Christian crosses. This was to honor Charlie Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA (TPUSA), who was shot and killed on September 10 during an event at Utah Valley University.According to Fox News, Blake Treinen, who is known for his strong Christian faith, wore the tribute hat as a personal gesture. Musician Sean Feucht shared photos and a short video from that game on Instagram, writing:“My friend and pitcher for the Dodgers, Blake Treinen, played with this on his hat last night.”Feucht later posted another video from October 8, showing Treinen giving the hat away after a game against the Philadelphia Phillies, and thanked him for “remembering Charlie Kirk tonight.”After the Dodgers’ World Series win, the same September photo began to recirculate on Facebook and X. Some users wrongly claimed the hat appeared during the World Series celebration.Also Read: Barack Obama Sends Heartfelt Reaction To Los Angeles Dodgers’ World Series Triumph After Nerve-Racking Game 7 Over Toronto Blue Jays Fact-checking sites including Primetimer and Fox News confirmed that the image was not taken during the World Series.

How Dallas Cowboys could reshape their roster in the final hours before NFL trade deadline",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/pass-rushers-cornerbacks-or-nothing-how-dallas-cowboys-could-reshape-their-roster-in-the-final-hours-before-nfl-trade-deadline/articleshow/125060835.cms,"Will Dallas make a big trade to fix its defensive woes before the NFL deadline?

Dallas Cowboys looking for a pass-rusher to boost a struggling defense

Adding pass-rushers may not fix the real issues

More on NFL trade coverage

The Dallas Cowboys are heading into the NFL trade deadline with questions to answer. Sitting at 3-4-1, the team has shown flashes of offensive firepower but has struggled on defense. After Monday night’s game against the Arizona Cardinals, the front office will need to decide whether to make a move to strengthen the defensive line and improve their chances down the stretch. The Cowboys face pressure to address glaring weaknesses in the secondary and defensive consistency, with fans and analysts watching closely to see if big trades or strategic adjustments will salvage their playoff hopes this season.Dallas has made no secret that adding defensive help is a priority. Ian Rapoport of NFL Network reported that the Cowboys are eyeing edge rushers to improve their pass rush. “We haven’t talked about the Cowboys enough because they play Monday night. But in advance of the trade deadline, every time he is asked, Jerry Jones talks about the possibility of the Cowboys making a big trade. Not like Micah Parsons, they did that this offseason but I wouldn’t be surprised if the Cowboys trade for a pass-rusher.My understanding is they are in the market for a D-line or defensive end. A couple of names to keep an eye on: Bradley Chubb, the Dolphins veteran, Jaelan Phillips, another standout Dolphins edge rusher. Arden Key of the Tennessee Titans, too, among the names to keep an eye on for Dallas.”While beefing up the defensive line makes sense after losing Micah Parsons, the Cowboys’ bigger problem is the secondary. According to Pro Football Focus, the team ranks 32nd in coverage, while pass-rushing efficiency is 17th. Even with high-paid corners like Trevon Diggs (on IR) and DaRon Bland, the secondary remains a glaring weakness that a single trade may not solve. Another challenge has been continuity on defense. Matt Eberflus is Dallas’ third defensive coordinator in three seasons, following Mike Zimmer in 2024 and Dan Quinn prior.“It’s not ideal,” said coach Brian Schottenheimer. “The biggest change was when [Quinn] left. It’s an adjustment, and what people don’t realize is whether you’re playing 3-4 [and] 5-1 with DQ, or [Zimmer’s] four-down, or [Eberflus’] four-down, they’re not the same systems, and they’re not built on the same things.”Even if the Cowboys make a trade, it may only provide a short-term fix while deeper defensive issues remain unresolved.","Dallas Cowboys looking for a pass-rusher to boost a struggling defense.

LeBron James’ Sciatica Injury and Recovery Timeline

Los Angeles Lakers Focus on Depth and Leadership in His Absence

Theare once again set to take the court without their franchise cornerstone,, as they face the Portland Trail Blazers tonight, November 4, 2025. The four-time NBA champion continues to recover from a persistent sciatica injury that has kept him sidelined since the start of the 2025-26 NBA season. As the Lakers navigate through a challenging stretch of games without their superstar, the focus remains on maintaining momentum and managing LeBron’s long-term health.LeBron’s absence has forced the Los Angeles Lakers to adapt quickly and rely heavily on their depth, testing the resilience and chemistry of the roster. Despite missing their leader, the team has shown flashes of promise through younger contributors, particularly guard Austin Reaves, whose increased scoring and playmaking have been pivotal in keeping the Lakers competitive early in the season. LeBron James ’ ongoing battle with sciatica has been a central storyline for the Lakers since early October. The condition, which involves inflammation and irritation of the sciatic nerve on his right side, causes radiating pain from the lower back through the leg - a particularly difficult injury for an athlete known for explosive movement and endurance. The issue first surfaced when the Los Angeles Lakers announced his diagnosis on October 9, initially estimating a 3-4 week recovery period.However, that timeline has since been extended as the medical staff opted for a more cautious approach. The 40-year-old veteran has now missed at least the first 10 games of the season, including tonight’s matchup in Portland. Team officials remain optimistic about his progress, with hopes of a return in the second or third week of November, depending on how his body responds to rehabilitation.While LeBron James’ leadership and experience are irreplaceable, several Lakers have stepped up to fill the void. Austin Reaves , in particular, has emerged as a key contributor, shouldering more offensive responsibilities and showing strong chemistry with teammates. The Lakers’ ability to stay competitive despite multiple injuries reflects the team’s depth and growing confidence in younger talent.The organization continues to emphasize patience and health management over rushing LeBron James’ return. Sciatica can be unpredictable, and any attempt to accelerate recovery could risk aggravating the condition further. Thankfully, medical experts and team sources have clarified that there are no career-threatening concerns tied to this injury - it’s simply a matter of time and proper rehabilitation.Also read: Los Angeles Lakers vs Portland Trail Blazers regular season game: Full injury report, expected lineup, and more (November 3, 2025) As the Los Angeles Lakers prepare to face the Trail Blazers tonight, they’ll continue to rely on their evolving lineup while LeBron works toward full recovery.

NHL Highlights | Maple Leafs vs. Flyers - November 1, 2025

Nick Robertson’s resilience paying off in defining season for Maple Leafs



When William Nylander suffered a lower-body injury, it initially seemed like a major setback for the Toronto Maple Leafs. Losing one of their top offensive weapons could have easily disrupted the team’s rhythm and chemistry. Instead, it opened the door for 24-year-old Nick Robertson — a player who had long been waiting for a chance to prove his worth in a top-six role.Robertson hasn’t wasted a second. Sliding in alongside captain Auston Matthews, the winger has quickly turned heads with his speed, energy, and finishing touch. In just three games playing on Matthews’ line, Robertson has produced three goals and two assists, emerging as one of Toronto’s most dynamic offensive contributors during Nylander’s absence.For Robertson, this is more than just a short-term audition, a chance to solidify his place in the Maple Leafs’ future. “It’s a blessing for sure,” he said after the team’s 5-2 win over the Philadelphia Flyers. “I try to take advantage of it. They’re just such good, talented players, him and Kniesy (Matthew Knies), and I just want to do my best to complement them out there.” His relentless puck pursuit and quick release have helped the Leafs sustain pressure in the offensive zone, giving Matthews and Matthew Knies the freedom to attack more creatively.The Leafs have spent much of the season trying to find the right fit next to Matthews after Mitch Marner’s offseason departure. Nylander initially filled that role, but Robertson’s emergence could change the equation. Head coach Craig Berube has taken notice, rewarding him with increased ice time, including a career-high 17:22 against Columbus. Matthews has praised Robertson’s efforts, saying, “He's fast, he's tenacious on pucks, he wins battles. ”Robertson’s journey to this point hasn’t been easy. Between injuries, trade speculation, and limited opportunities, he’s had to fight for every shift. Now, with Nylander out, he’s showing the consistency and poise Toronto has been hoping for. If he continues to perform at this level, the Leafs may have finally found a long-term solution next to Matthews and a new breakout star emerging right when they needed one most.His growth also highlights the organization’s renewed faith in developing homegrown talent rather than relying solely on external additions. More importantly, Robertson’s rise could reshape Toronto’s offensive identity, balancing veteran leadership with youthful hunger and speed.Also Read: Steven Stamkos trade rumors: Struggling Predators star linked to Canadiens and Canucks amid slow start","Nick Robertson has emerged as a key player for the Toronto Maple Leafs.

Robert Griffin III’s legacy: How injuries stopped a once-generational NFL talent

More coverage on NFL:

Robert Griffin III’s rookie season with the Washington Commanders in 2012 was nothing short of cinematic. Armed with blazing speed, pinpoint accuracy, and a confidence that electrified FedEx Field, RG3 transformed Washington’s offense overnight. He guided the team to its first NFC East title since 1999 and was crowned Offensive Rookie of the Year, a rare feat for any first-year quarterback.Yet, behind the excitement was an unfolding tragedy. Griffin’s style of play, fearless, fast, and high-impact, made him both thrilling and vulnerable. During Washington’s Wild Card playoff game against the Seattle Seahawks in early 2013, his right knee finally gave out. The diagnosis was brutal: a torn ACL, LCL, and meniscus. That single fall didn’t just end a game; it altered the course of a career that once seemed destined for superstardom.Following surgery, Griffin returned only eight months later, determined to reclaim his spark. But his game had changed. The explosiveness that once defined him was replaced by caution. He finished the 2013 season with 3,203 passing yards and 16 touchdowns, but lacked the rushing brilliance that made him special.Washington benched him for the final stretch, signaling the beginning of an uncertain future.Over the next few years, injuries piled up like unwelcome guests. A dislocated ankle in 2014, concussions in 2015 and 2016, and a fractured shoulder during his brief stint with the Cleveland Browns chipped away at what was left of his prime. Later, while serving as a backup for the Baltimore Ravens, Griffin endured a thumb fracture and hamstring injury, ultimately leading to his NFL exit in 2021.RG3’s legacy is a bittersweet one — the story of a quarterback whose rookie brilliance reshaped expectations for mobile passers, only to be undone by the physical toll of the same play style that made him great.Had Griffin avoided that devastating 2013 injury, he might have stood alongside legends like Lamar Jackson and Patrick Mahomes as one of football’s most dynamic dual-threats. Instead, his career remains a powerful reminder that in the NFL, even the brightest stars can fade overnight.","Robert Griffin III’s rookie season with the Washington Commanders in 2012 was nothing short of cinematic. He guided the team to its first NFC East title since 1999 and was crowned Offensive Rookie of the Year. But behind the excitement was an unfolding tragedy. In 2013, his right knee gave out during a playoff game against the Seattle Seahawks. The diagnosis was brutal: a torn ACL, LCL, and meniscus.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125065912,imgsize-34778,width-400,resizemode-4/robert-griffin-iii.jpg"

A slight tap on the helmet by Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Nick Bolton had Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen going for an Oscar-level performance. Allen threw his head back as if he were auditioning for a blockbuster. Broadcast announcers watching the Bills vs. Chiefs matchup couldn’t help but joke, saying, “Oh, that’s a little acting,” and “He’s got an offseason home in Hollywood. ” It wouldn’t be Hallie Steinfeld’s influence, would it? A fan even pointed out, “His wife is an actress,” but let’s not go there.

Fast forward to today, Josh Allen faked a head hit from Nick Bolton in the fourth quarter of the Bills vs. Chiefs game. He snapped his head back as if Bolton’s light tap had seriously hit him. During the replay, broadcast announcer Tony Romo said, “Oh, that’s a little acting…” and veteran announcer Jim Nantz added, “He’s got an offseason home in Hollywood. ..may be setting up a few more commercials down the road.” Fans compared it to LeBron James, joking—“Looks like someone's caught a case of the LeBrons,” “The LeBron of the NFL,” “Graduate of LeBron James Theater School,” and “LeBron would be proud….”Fans quickly zeroed in on Josh Allen as he supposedly flopped like Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes during Sunday’s matchup. The moment sparked memories of a November 2024 tweet where ESPN’s David Newton wrote: “Panthers OLB Jadeveon Clowney says Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes, who had one of his better days scrambling, does a lot of flopping on the sideline when asked about the calls Mahomes gets.” With Josh Allen’s performance fresh in mind, fans compared Allen’s dramatic move to Mahomes’ alleged flopping. Although, one supporter defended Mahomes, exclaiming, “And yet people call Mahomes a flopper 😭🫵.” Another dubbed Allen’s move “Pure Mahomery on that slide.” A fan taunted Mahomes and wanted Allen to get an award: “Give that man an award, he out Chiefed the Chiefs.

A fall from grace



8 Hours in Hell: A Shocking Firsthand Experience of What Really Awaits in the Afterlife.

In his book Eight Hours in Hell: A Journey Through Death and Back, Steve Kang recounts his terrifying descent and miraculous return.

“I was in hell”



Redemption and faith



Belief, doubt, and the unexplained







Ever since the first flicker of human consciousness, one question has haunted civilisation: what happens after we die? From ancient myths to modern neuroscience, humanity has been trying to decipher the mystery of what lies beyond. With scientific advancement came desperate attempts to map the unseeable: studies measuring brain activity moments after death, experiments tracking flickers of consciousness as the body shuts down, and near-death research probing the line between the physical and the spiritual. Yet despite decades of effort, science has barely begun to scratch the surface.And then came a case that defies reason.For Steve Kang, the story began not with faith, but with despair, and what followed has baffled even those who study the limits of human awareness. Raised as a practising Buddhist with no exposure to Christianity or the Bible’s depictions of heaven and hell, Kang says that when he attempted to take his own life in 1998, he found himself in a place that mirrored the Biblical description of hell, a world of darkness and torment that he could not have imagined.His account, unsettling and eerily consistent with Christian theology despite his unfamiliarity with it, would later mark a profound turning point in his life.What began as a near-fatal act of hopelessness led him to reevaluate his beliefs and eventually embrace Christianity, a transformation that continues to intrigue psychologists, theologians, and scientists alike, as they grapple with what consciousness might truly encounter after death.1998 had been a devastating year for Steve Kang. His father, once a successful businessman in South Korea, lost everything in the country’s financial collapse. At just 19, while studying at the University of California, Irvine, Kang suddenly found himself on his own, scrambling to find work, a scholarship, and somewhere to live.Up until then, he had been a diligent student and a devout Buddhist. But hardship drove him into darker places. “During that entire summer,” he told The Daily Mail, “I do not remember being sober for more than an hour here and there. We partied and got into trouble.”By the time the fall semester began, he was too addicted and disoriented to attend classes. Then, at a college party, Kang made a mistake that would change his life forever. He smoked what he thought was marijuana, but the bong contained a lethal mix of heroin, cocaine, and PCP, a combination known as a “death bowl.”“Something in there messed with my brain,” he recalled. “I stayed awake for ten straight days. I didn’t get a second of sleep after that.”Ten days without sleepBy the fifth day, his sense of reality began to crumble. “I didn’t know what time of the day it was,” he wrote in his book“By the sixth and seventh day, when I looked in the mirror I saw that my pupils were so big and black, the white parts of my eyes were hardly visible.”He phoned Buddhist monks back in Korea, his mentors, seeking help. Their reply cut deep: “We are in the middle of a silent prayer. We cannot help you.”“It was a very dark time,” he said. “My birthday fell during those ten days, and friends would be like, ‘Steve, happy birthday,’ and I couldn’t reply. I still attended classes, but when teachers and my friends were talking to me, I could not process even a sentence of what they were saying.”He described feeling haunted, cups falling, metallic noises echoing from a temple poster, convinced he was under a spiritual attack.Then, on the eighth day, a vision appeared. An elderly Asian man with a long white beard, what Kang believed to be a Buddhist spirit, told him that if he “sacrificed his body,” he would receive “50,000 fewer years in hell.”“It sounded like a good deal at the time,” Kang said.He wrote his mother a letter of apology. Two days later, he stabbed himself repeatedly in the stomach and neck with a kitchen knife. His terrified mother found him in a pool of blood and immediately called 911.As surgeons fought to keep him alive, Kang felt himself falling, not rising, as if pulled down an endless, echoing shaft. “I knew I was dying,” he said. “It was like a roller coaster, an elevator, just falling. The fear and the anxiety kept building. After what felt like five minutes, I landed and looked around. I was in hell.”The Asian grandfather he thought would guide him toward nirvana was nowhere to be found. Instead, Kang sensed a dark, overpowering presence, and in that moment, he realised the truth. The figure who had once urged him to take his life was not a guide at all, but Satan himself. “I felt betrayal right away. I felt so lonely,” he said.As doctors worked to restart his heart, Kang said he was fighting for his soul, trapped in a place of unbearable darkness that he had never imagined could exist.The world he described was one of bleak desolation, a cracked, barren wasteland. “For some reason, I could still see,” he said. “People ask me, ‘How can you see if there's no sunlight?’ But you can still supernaturally see. There's sand pebbles everywhere. There's no grass, there's no flowers, there's no plants, there's no food, there's not even a drop of water.”“To the left, I saw purplish-red cliffs. There were people on top of the cliff, on the bottom of the cliff. When I looked up, evil spirits were there, not small, like in cartoons. These things were really tall, as tall as buildings, wearing capes. And I knew they were in charge of this place.”He said the agony was worse than anything imaginable. “It’s not a place you want to go,” Kang said. “I almost feel like I don’t even want Kim Jong-il or Hitler to go there. I don’t want my worst enemies to go there.”“You're just in this agony, and there's no ability to converse with people. It was so much pain, so much accusation, so much fear. It was like anxiety multiplied, fear of condemnation multiplied.”For eight hours, surgeons worked on him, repairing torn arteries and blood vessels. Doctors told his mother to prepare for the worst. But she refused.“She prayed to every god she could think of, Allah, Buddha, Muhammad, Confucius, Taoist gods, Shinto gods,” he recalled. “Then she remembered her friend in California, Mrs Kim, was a Christian. And she called her.”“No more Buddhism, no more drugs… I love you”Kang says it was those prayers that pulled him back. “I heard a voice in my heart,” he wrote. “A voice I have never heard before. He said, ‘No more Buddhism, no more drugs… I love you.’”He believes that voice was Jesus.“The doctor said it was a miracle that I awakened,” he said. “There were staples holding my skin together around my stomach and neck, and tubes going in and out everywhere.”The recovery took a decade. Kang suffered constant panic attacks and insomnia, relying on 20 medications, including Xanax, Lithium Carbonate, and antidepressants, just to function. “For ten years, I never slept one night normally. I had visions of demons laughing at me.”Then, around Christmas 2012, he said he experienced what he called a “heavenly visitation.”“I was standing on the top of a hill, and before my very eyes, the mountains, fields, and valleys stretched out,” he said. “A heavenly, bright light shone in all directions. I clearly heard the voice of the Father God with my own ears. I even heard the heavenly choir of angels worshiping God… no human choir could sing that beautifully.”He threw away his pills and, for the first time in years, slept peacefully. He later joined the US Army as a chaplain and met his wife, Goeun Kim.Now 47, he lives in California as an evangelical pastor, his body still marked with scars, his faith forged from trauma. “God saved me from hell,” he said, “to help prevent other people from attempting suicide.”Sceptics have suggested that Kang’s experience was merely a hallucination brought on by trauma and drugs. Kang disagrees.“That can be a common objection,” he said. “I love objections. I love having a good dialogue. They use the same argument for the resurrection of Jesus Christ, they say the disciples hallucinated because they wanted to see him so much. For me, evidence is everything.”He referenced research by megachurch pastor John Burke, who interviewed nearly 1,000 people claiming near-death experiences. “Same exact story,” Kang said. “Same turnaround of life. So, I respect everyone’s beliefs and the scepticism, but what they saw is what I saw, and it’s what is in the Bible.”As a man raised outside Christianity, Kang finds that fact hard to ignore. “I had no idea how the Bible described hell,” he reflected. “So, it can’t be a hallucination.”His story, one that straddles faith, psychology, and the mysteries of human consciousness, raises the same question that science still cannot answer: what really happens when we die?","Steve Kang claims he descended into a place identical to the Biblical hell, despite never reading the Bible. Kang was raised as a practising Buddhist with no exposure to Christianity or the Bible’s depictions of heaven and hell.

Canadiens and Canucks emerge as top contenders for Steven Stamkos amid Nashville uncertainty

Steven Stamkos faces crucial stretch to revive season and secure future in Nashville



Steven Stamkos’ time with the Nashville Predators is facing early turbulence in his second season. After signing a four-year, $32 million deal in July 2024, the veteran forward has struggled to find his footing. With just one goal and two points in 13 games, Stamkos’ offensive slump has become a major concern for a Predators team sitting sixth in the Central Division at 5-6-2.For a player of Stamkos’ caliber, known for his leadership, experience, and scoring instincts, such a slow start has quickly fueled questions about his future in Nashville. While the Predators aim to regain consistency, NHL insiders suggest the 35-year-old could be on the radar of other teams searching for veteran scoring help.According to NHL insider Jeff Marek, the Montreal Canadiens and Vancouver Canucks could emerge as potential destinations if Nashville explores trade options. The Canadiens, currently dealing with Patrik Laine’s long-term injury absence, might look to Stamkos as a short-term offensive solution. Meanwhile, the Canucks could see him as a seasoned addition to strengthen their forward group for a playoff push.Marek stated on Sekeres & Price via NHL Rumour Report, “I could wonder about the Canucks, and I could wonder now that Patrik Laine is out, I could wonder about the Canadiens too; something probably has to give here.”However, a trade would be far from straightforward. Stamkos holds a full no-trade clause, allowing him to veto any potential deal. That clause gives him significant leverage and limits Nashville’s flexibility. Still, speculation about a possible reunion with the Tampa Bay Lightning, where Stamkos won two Stanley Cups, continues to gain quiet traction.The veteran remains under contract through the 2027-28 season, but Nashville’s front office will be keeping a close eye on his performance in the coming weeks. If the Predators continue to slide and Stamkos’ production doesn’t improve, a midseason shake-up could be on the table.If Stamkos can rediscover his scoring touch soon, he could silence the trade rumors and help Nashville steer its season back on course. For now, all eyes remain on how the veteran responds to growing pressure.Also Read: “They’re Engaged”: Boston Bruins star Jeremy Swayman and Alessandra Iacaboni’s love story reaches a beautiful milestone",Steven Stamkos has struggled to find his footing in his second season with the Nashville Predators.

Random Musing: Why Zohran Mamdani will find it hard to be another Barack Obama,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/random-musing-why-zohran-mamdani-will-find-it-hard-to-be-another-barack-obama/articleshow/125060895.cms,"New York Is Not America





Nepo Baby vs Outsider





The Identity-Box Gamble vs a Real Constituency

Obama Was a Moderate; Mamdani Is Not





The Kamala Harris Cautionary Tale





Islam, Socialism and the American Ceiling





The Israel Factor: New York Exceptionalism





A Movement Candidate, Not a Messiah









Since Barack Obama became the first Black president of the United States — and the patron saint of slightly deracinated global liberals who feel increasingly alienated as global politics lurches right — liberals have been waiting for the next Obama: the Aragorn who will again lead the righteous army and rid America of the evil forces of Sauron.The latest to have that mantle thrust on him is Zohran Mamdani — a reel champion who has borrowed from the Trump playbook, turning authenticity into theatre and populism into performance. As political analyst Ross Barkan noted in a recent profile: “He is, like a young Obama, very compelling, has a great back story. He has a real charm, a way with people. He has great social media, but you need the charm to make the social media work.”Ironically, Mamdani even wrote that he was Black and Asian in his SAT application where he scored 2140 — below the median for Columbia — before going on to study Africana Studies at Bowdoin College. That one slightly clumsy sentence is a neat metaphor for why Mamdani cannot be another Obama. Obama made the system bend to his will. Mamdani, on the other hand, is trying to game a system that still resists seeing someone like him as fully American.The Obama analogy flatters everyone — liberals nostalgic for 2008, Mamdani himself, and commentators desperate for a “narrative.” But it is also wrong, for reasons that have less to do with Mamdani’s talent and more to do with where he is, who he is, and the country he is trying to win.Lest we forget, Obama came out of Chicago but ran as the candidate of the United States. His coalition stretched from Black voters in Detroit to white retirees in Florida. His Yes We Can message resonated across demography and geography. Zohran Mamdani, however, born in Uganda, cannot even run — the US Constitution bars the foreign-born from seeking the presidency.Mamdani, by contrast, is the frontrunner to run a very specific city — post-pandemic, Trump-era New York. His campaign is built on an affordability crisis that is genuinely apocalyptic here: freeze the rent on nearly a million rent-stabilised apartments, make buses free, promise universal childcare funded by higher taxes on the rich.That programme speaks directly to tenants in Queens, overworked parents in Brooklyn and young professionals wondering why they need three roommates and a side hustle just to afford groceries. It does not automatically speak to a homeowner in Arizona whose mortgage is fixed and whose main worry is crime and gas prices.New York’s electorate is younger, more immigrant, more secular and far more accustomed to left-of-centre rhetoric than the rest of America, which just rehired Donald Trump and JD Vance after a campaign powered by a visible rightward shift.Obama’s genius was to make Chicago feel like a metaphor for America. Mamdani’s politics are aggressively, proudly local. That works brilliantly for Gracie Mansion. It is not a dry run for the White House.Read: Why some liberals think Mamdani is the new Obama For all his outsider rhetoric, Zohran Mamdani is not the self-made underdog that Barack Obama was. Obama’s rise from a single mother’s son in Hawaii to the first Black president was powered by intellect, discipline and rhetorical grace. Mamdani, by contrast, was born into Manhattan’s liberal intelligentsia: the son of Oscar-nominated filmmaker Mira Nair and scholar Mahmood Mamdani. He grew up surrounded by art, activism and academia — the politics of someone who can afford to play with fire without being burned by it. Obama adapted to the establishment before being adopted by it; Mamdani was born into it.Mamdani’s Columbia application, where he ticked both “Asian” and “Black,” has become a symbol of how different his relationship to race is from Obama’s. Critics spun this as a teenager’s attempt to find the least-hostile category in a hostile system. Strip away the outrage and you’re left with something more telling.Obama was Black in the way America understands Blackness — a Black man in a Black church on the South Side of Chicago, married to a Black woman, rooted in a historically oppressed constituency. That did not make his life easy, but it made his claim to represent Black America undeniable and authentic.Mamdani, born in Uganda to Indian parents and raised in New York, is something else: East African, South Asian, Muslim, cosmopolitan. His attempt, at 17, to tick every box that might approximate that messiness has now been retrofitted into a morality play about elite hypocrisy. Obama’s identity anchored him to a massive, motivated voting bloc. Mamdani’s identity is an essay question that can be — and is being — pulled apart on cable news.Obama ran on “hope and change,” but his agenda was packaged as pragmatic and centrist. He annoyed the left almost as much as the right.Mamdani is not selling technocracy. He is an open democratic socialist who talks about rent freezes, public housing, free buses and taxing the rich, rooted in years of movement work around foreclosure, taxi debt and Palestine activism. He went from campus protests to a 45-day taxi strike.This is not “Obama 2008 but browner.” It’s Bernie with a Spotify playlist.Since Obama’s victory, the centre of American politics has shifted right. Trump’s 2024 win over Kamala Harris was powered by gains among Latino, Asian and even some Black voters. Obama surfed a liberalising wave. Mamdani is trying to swim against a conservative tide — a very different current.If you want proof that America is not in the mood to manufacture another Obama, look at Kamala Harris.On paper, she was the sequel: Black and South Asian, prosecutor turned progressive, the first woman and first Asian-American vice president, then the Democratic nominee against Trump in 2024. She had Obama’s blessing, Biden’s incumbency and the full strength of the Democratic armada. She still lost, as Trump improved his margins across demographics and sliced into Democratic strongholds.Harris’s identity and moderate progressivism were not enough to withstand a right-leaning electorate furious about inflation, immigration and culture wars. If a former vice president with the full weight of the party behind her cannot replay the Obama script, the idea that a Muslim socialist mayor from Queens will do so in a harsher climate starts to look like fan fiction.Obama’s middle name was Hussein, and the right still tried to turn him into a secret Muslim. His project was to reassure white America that he was safe, respectable and Christian. Even then, the birther conspiracy lasted years.Mamdani does not have that luxury. He is openly Muslim, prays, and refuses to sandpaper that identity down. He is also explicitly socialist. In an America shaped by 9/11, Gaza and Trump, that is a double burden in national politics.In New York, a critical mass of voters hears “Muslim socialist” and thinks: finally, someone speaking to tenants and immigrants. In most of America, it still sounds like the villain in a Homeland reboot.Obama faced racism and hysteria but had the armour of moderation and churchgoing normalcy. Mamdani walks into the same minefield wearing a DSA badge and a keffiyeh.Then there is Israel-Palestine, the issue that has turned Mamdani into a folk hero on the left and a bogeyman for much of organised Jewish America.His record as an anti-Zionist activist is not a footnote. He has defended the phrase “globalise the intifada,” accused Israel of genocide and apartheid, and once said the NYPD boot “has been laced by the IDF.”In New York, this hasn’t destroyed him. Some Orthodox and progressive Jews still support him because they like his housing agenda or stance on policing. The city’s unique mix of anti-Netanyahu liberals and transactional machines gives him enough space to be radioactive on Israel and still viable.That is not the country. In a presidential race, his Israel record would be on loop in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Georgia. A line that energises Brooklyn leftists becomes electoral napalm in suburban synagogues.Obama calibrated his Israel criticism carefully enough to drive Netanyahu mad while keeping AIPAC on side. Mamdani is the opposite: morally consistent from the left, politically lethal outside deep-blue enclaves.None of this is to deny Mamdani’s skill. He has borrowed from the Trump playbook and inverted it: constant social media, viral stunts like diving into the Atlantic in winter to dramatise “freeze the rent,” campaign rallies that feel like concerts, and an army of first-time volunteers who talk about him the way 2008 kids talked about Obama.He’s fused old-school organising with meme-literate aesthetics. In New York, that looks like the future of politics.But he is an organiser who legislates, not a national messiah. His project is to prove that a Muslim socialist can run the capital of capitalism and have the sky remain intact. That’s radical enough; demanding that he also be the next Obama is unfair to him and unserious about America.Obama was a once-in-a-generation convergence of biography, temperament, timing and a country briefly willing to believe in its better angels. Mamdani is the product of a harsher, more polarised era.That is important work. It just isn’t the same story. Zohran Mamdani can be many things — New York’s first Muslim mayor, a proof-of-concept for left urban governance, even a future senator. But he cannot be another Obama, because there are no more Obamas to be had. The age of liberal messiahs is over; the age of contested mayors with messy SAT forms and even messier coalitions has begun.Barack Obama was, like Bill Clinton before him, a spanner in the works, upsetting the applecart. He rose up to his level through grit, gumption, and intellect, not to mention remarkable oratory skills. He has the kind of voice that would make Morgan Freeman jealous, a promise of assurance even in the deadliest of storms. And yet, he became the reason that the Democratic party finds himself at the crossroads. But his rise inevitably created Trump’s. And at this moment, assuming ceteris paribus, which is always a faulty thing to assume, it seems quite unlikely that Zohran Mamdani is messiah the Democrats need or deserve right now.","Zohran Mamdani is the frontrunner to run a very specific city — post-pandemic, Trump-era New York.

Just two days after the tragic loss of his brother, Jabari “Baby Uiie” Henley, who was fatally shot in Los Angeles, Los Angeles Chargers linebacker Daiyan Henley showed remarkable courage by taking the field against the Tennessee Titans. While most would have taken time to grieve, Henley chose to play, determined to honor his brother’s memory through the game he loves.The emotional weight was visible throughout the matchup, yet Henley delivered one of his best performances of the season. Despite dealing with immense pain, the 25-year-old recorded nine total tackles and sacked Titans quarterback Cam Ward, dropping to his knees in a heartfelt moment that spoke louder than words. His resilience drew respect from teammates, fans, and coaches across the league.Speaking to the media for the first time since the incident, Henley admitted the past 48 hours had been some of the hardest of his life. “Everything hit me pretty hard,” he said, acknowledging that this season had already been filled with personal challenges. “It’s been a long ride for me since the beginning of the season.” Still, he explained his decision to play came from a sense of duty to his team and his family.Henley’s emotional performance became a moment of both mourning and tribute. “I just wanted to talk to my brother one more time,” he said, reflecting on the sack that brought him to his knees. “It was just an emotional moment for me to make a play on a day like this.” His words captured the heartbreak of loss and the unbreakable bond between brothers.The Chargers linebacker also expressed gratitude to those who supported him during the ordeal, including teammates Denzel Perryman, NaVorro Bowman, and head coach Jim Harbaugh. “I wasn’t going to let them down. I wasn’t going to let my family down,” he said.According to reports, authorities have not yet made any arrests in connection with Jabari Henley’s Halloween-night shooting. As investigations continue, Daiyan Henley’s decision to take the field remains a powerful symbol of strength, love, and perseverance in the face of unimaginable grief.

Mitchell Robinson's involvement in trade rumors over the past few months has a purpose. The former second-round choice is a useful backup who knows how to position his body for both offensive and defensive rebounds. However, he has recently become a frontcourt presence plagued by injuries.Robinson has already been declared out for the New York Knicks ' next game against the Washington Wizards, meaning his injury problems will continue throughout the 2025–2026 season. Robinson is a game-time decision for Friday, according to coach Mike Brown. Brown recognizes the potential, even though the center's availability will probably continue to be a recurring part this season.Mitchell Robinson finally made his season debut on Friday night against the Chicago Bulls , which was fantastic news for the New York Knicks. Due to a left ankle injury, the center had missed the first four games. He is now ready to be back on the court, contributing to the improvement and strength of the Knicks defense.However, Robinson, who is still dealing with a sore ankle, might make his debut after practicing on Thursday for the first time since the regular season started. Talking about it, the coach said:“Mitch brings a lot to the table. Obviously, he hasn’t played in a while too.So he’s not going to be Mitch Robinson in the next five games probably, no matter when he plays or how much he plays..”He further said:“But his length, his versatility, in terms of being able to guard one through five, his ability to offensive rebound, defensive rebound, he just brings a lot to both ends of the floor. You get a vertical threat offensively and an anchor defensively, that it’s hard to replace because he’s a special player at that position.”Robinson had not exercised or played since the third preseason game, when he was inexplicably benched for ""left ankle injury management."" His ankle seems to be getting better enough for him to continue playing.He is labelled as questionable for today's game, but he should play 20 to 25 minutes against the Bulls. Whatever the cause, there has been a push for his comeback. A source claimed that Robinson even took part in the morning shootaround prior to Tuesday's Milwaukee game.At any point, getting Robinson back into the starting lineup would be considered a victory for New York. It doesn't, nonetheless, alter the truth that the team is reportedly getting tired of his injuries.In 13 minutes during Sunday's 128-116 victory over Chicago, Robinson recorded zero points (0-3 FG), five rebounds, one assist, and two blocks. His workload was extremely light on Sunday as the Knicks continued to exercise utmost care.Robinson's load management was the subject of numerous concerns prior to the season, and this seems like a problem for his team. His availability for the Wizards game on Monday is still up in the air.He has averaged 5.6 points and 8.5 rebounds in 2023–24 and 5.1 points and 5.9 rebounds in limited time last season. He also played in three preseason games with the Knicks this season. However, right now, he is in a precarious position.Also read: Tyrese Haliburton injury update: Indiana Pacers star's health status against Milwaukee Bucks revealed (11-03-2025)","Mitchell Robinson finally made his season debut on Friday night against the Chicago Bulls.

Poll What do you think about the Indian women's team's gesture of acknowledging past players after their World Cup victory? It's an inspiring and humble gesture. It's good but shouldn't be necessary. I don't see the value in it. Other sports should do the same.

Ashwin lauds Harmanpreet Kaur ’s team: 'They remembered those who sprinkled the seeds — men never did'Former India cricketer R Ashwin has lauded the Indian women’s team for their gesture of acknowledging past players after winning the ICC Women’s World Cup, saying it reflects the spirit and humility of true champions.Speaking on his YouTube channel Ash Ki Baat, Ashwin said he found the moment “unbelievably good” when the current team celebrated their triumph with legends like Mithali Raj , Anjum Chopra and Jhulan Goswami , who were present at the DY Patil Stadium.“I am actually taking my hat out to the Indian women's team. The Indian men’s team has never done something like this. We say it in front of the media, but I’ve never seen them give credit to the previous generation. They always talk like ‘my generation team is better than yours’,” Ashwin said.“But this women’s team… Anjum Chopra was there, Mithali Raj was there to see them in delight. You are the people who sprinkled the seeds and watered them — the seeds that are standing as winners today. I found that fascinating. I found that unbelievably good.”Ashwin added that India’s World Cup victory was the culmination of years of struggle, resilience, and groundwork laid by generations of women cricketers.“The victory that Indian women have got today has not been achieved today. It’s been a work of 25 years — probably three decades,” he said.“What about your Diana Eduljis? What about your Sudha Shahs? What about your Anjum Chopras? What about your Jhulan Goswamis?

I’ve always said Jhulan Goswami is the Ishant Sharma or probably Zaheer Khan of women’s cricket.”Ashwin also criticized the habit of constantly comparing men’s and women’s cricket, calling it a “conditioning” that must change.“I am so sorry — the way they’ve been compared with men’s cricket is wrong. That’s conditioning. I want to change. All of you should change. Please don’t compare. This is a pure inspirational story.”For Ashwin, what stood out most was the humility of Harmanpreet Kaur’s team in celebrating those who came before them.“That’s why I find this women’s team amazing. After winning, you are on a real high — still, you remember to celebrate your previous generation of cricketers who were there in the dressing room. No one asked them to do it. That’s what makes them special,” he said.",Former India cricketer R Ashwin has lauded the Indian women’s team for their gesture of acknowledging past players. Ashwin said he found the moment ‘unbelievably good’ when the current team celebrated their triumph with legends like Mithali Raj and Anjum Chopra.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125074699,imgsize-90764,width-400,resizemode-4/mithali-anjum-and-jhulan.jpg"

The youngest debutant of the World Cup, Faustino Oro, known as the Messi of chess in Argentina, took the blitz route to secure his spot in the second round and emerged as the showstopper at the Resort Rio in Goa on Monday. The 12-year-old will be among the 78 qualifiers who will be paired with the top 50 seeds, including world champion D.

Aronyak (2514 Elo) stunned higher-ranked and 40-year-old Poland GM Bartel Mateusz in game 1 of the tie-breaker.

Jake Paul reacted to abuse allegations against Gervonta Davis



The highly anticipated Netflix boxing match between Jake Paul and Gervonta “Tank” Davis has been officially canceled, just days before the two were set to face off in Miami.The cancellation comes amid serious allegations against Davis, who has been accused of physically assaulting his ex-girlfriend in a lawsuit filed in Miami-Dade County. What was initially promoted as a groundbreaking sports entertainment event has now turned into a major controversy that has shaken the boxing world and halted one of Netflix’s most ambitious live sports ventures to date.Most Valuable Promotions (MVP), co-founded by Jake Paul, confirmed the decision to withdraw the fight after reviewing the situation. The fight, set for November 14 at the Kaseya Center, had drawn huge attention since its announcement — both for the star power involved and the weight disparity between Paul and Davis. However, the legal developments surrounding Davis left the organizers with no choice but to cancel the bout.MVP CEO Nakisa Bidarian released a statement Monday night confirming the fight’s cancellation, saying, “Our team has worked closely with all parties to navigate this situation responsibly. While we will not be moving forward with this event, our plan still remains for Jake Paul to headline an event on Netflix in 2025.”According to court documents obtained by multiple outlets, Davis’s ex-girlfriend filed a civil lawsuit accusing the boxer of battery, kidnapping, and false imprisonment. The complaint also includes charges of intentional infliction of emotional distress.The Miami Gardens Police Department confirmed that the case remains under active investigation, and a judge has reportedly granted the woman a temporary restraining order.Fans who purchased tickets will automatically receive refunds within 14-21 days, as confirmed by MVP. The company also warned buyers from secondary markets to contact their ticket vendors directly.Jake Paul didn’t hold back when addressing the controversy. In a fiery statement posted to X, he said, “Gervonta Davis is an actual walking human piece of garbage. Working with him is an absolute nightmare. The unprofessionalism, the bizarre requests, the showing up hours late to shoots. To the numerous arrests and related accusations and lawsuits. If you support this man you support the most vile sin a man can commit. ”Paul continued, “I didn’t want to give this woman abuser a platform to grow his fans and to grow his bank account. My company champions women. I’m so sorry to everyone involved... Mostly to the undercard fighters and my team who worked so hard prepping for this fight.”While the bout’s cancellation has disappointed fans worldwide, Paul’s focus now shifts toward his next opponent. “As for me it’s on to the next one as always. Anyone. Anytime. Any place,” he wrote. Both Bidarian's and Paul’s comments left the door open for another major Netflix fight in 2025 with another popular boxer.Also Read: Prince William stuns Brazil crowd as he jumps barefoot into beach volleyball with Carolina Solberg","The highly anticipated Netflix boxing match between Jake Paul and Gervonta ‘Tank’ Davis has been officially canceled.
