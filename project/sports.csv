Anna Kournikova, 44, reveals pregnancy with Enrique Iglesias after health scare

Anna Kournikova and Enrique Iglesias‚Äô family life in Miami

‚ÄúIt was just meant to be sweet in the moment. I honestly didn‚Äôt mean to confuse people.

I thought it‚Äôd be easier for the audience to understand than if I said ‚Äòmy girl.‚Äô‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve never really thought marriage would make a difference. Maybe it‚Äôs because I come from divorced parents, but I don‚Äôt think you love someone more because of a piece of paper.‚Äù

Former tennis star Anna Kournikova, 44, is pregnant with her fourth child with long-time partner, singer Enrique Iglesias, 50. The news was reported on Thursday by Spanish magazine Hola, which said that the Russian athlete is already halfway through her pregnancy and ‚Äúeverything is going well. ‚Äù This comes only months after she was spotted in a wheelchair in Miami, wearing a protective boot, sparking concern about her health.The couple, who have been together since 2001, already share three children- twins Lucy and Nicholas, both 7, and their younger daughter Mary, who is 5.Anna Kournikova was last photographed in early August in Miami, where she was seen taking her children to martial arts classes, a rare public outing that reassured fans after earlier health concerns.Anna Kournikova retired from professional tennis in 2003 at just 21 after repeated injuries to her back and feet. Her health history made the sight of her in a wheelchair in January this year especially worrying for fans. She was seen at Bal Harbour Mall in Miami, wearing an orthopedic boot, but later appeared to recover well.Anna Kournikova and Iglesias have built a private family life in Miami, where the Spanish singer has lived since the late 1990s. The couple first met in 2001 when Kournikova appeared in Enrique Iglesias‚Äôs music video for his hit single Escape. Although they have been together for over two decades, they have never confirmed if they are married. Iglesias once explained in 2012:He also shared his views on marriage, saying:The couple recently expanded their property portfolio in Miami by purchasing a five-bedroom home in Bay Point for $6.5 million, according to the Miami Herald.Also Read: ‚ÄúNo Room For Emotions‚Äù: Novak Djokovic Reveals How Athlete Stereotypes Hurt His Relationship With Wife Jelena While Enrique Iglesias continues touring worldwide, Kournikova has kept a very low profile.

Neighbors in Miami often see them enjoying beach walks, outdoor barbecues, and cheering at their kids‚Äô weekend sports practices.

Who Wins the Trade?

A new trade rumor has thelinked to San Antonio Spurs guardin a blockbuster scenario that could shake up both franchises‚Äô short- and long-term plans. According to a proposal first discussed by NBA writer Zach Buckley of Bleacher Report, the deal would send Brandin Podziemski, Gui Santos, and a top-3 protected 2028 first-round pick to San Antonio in exchange for the reigning Rookie of the Year.The suggested trade package looks like this:The idea rests on the Golden State Warriors‚Äô need to fortify their backcourt defense while the Spurs juggle an abundance of young guards.Golden State is still in win-now mode as Stephen Curry approaches the latter stages of his career. The front office has long sought a defensive-minded guard who can also grow into a franchise cornerstone. Stephon Castle, with his 6‚Äô6‚Äù frame, athleticism, and elite defensive instincts, fits that mold.While Podziemski has shown strong playmaking, shooting, and basketball IQ, his defense remains a limitation. Castle offers two-way versatility that Podziemski may never reach.Bringing him in not only strengthens Golden State‚Äôs immediate title push but also lays a foundation for life after Curry.‚Ä¢ Defensive upgrade in the backcourt‚Ä¢ Castle could be Curry‚Äôs successor‚Ä¢ Balances present contention with future planning‚Ä¢ Losing Podziemski, a fan favorite‚Ä¢ Risky to give up a protected 2028 first-round pick when post-Curry decline is possible‚Ä¢ Castle‚Äôs offensive ceiling remains unprovenThe Spurs are currently managing a crowded backcourt that includes De‚ÄôAaron Fox, Stephon Castle, and lottery pick Dylan Harper. While Castle has proven he can be a two-way contributor‚Äîaveraging 14.7 points, 4.1 assists, and 3.7 rebounds in his rookie year‚Äîhis role could be squeezed as Fox and Harper take on larger workloads.Podziemski‚Äôs shooting and playmaking skills would provide balance alongside Fox and Harper, while Gui Santos adds depth and flexibility. The 2028 pick also gives San Antonio future options.‚Ä¢ Podziemski complements Fox and Harper‚Ä¢ Santos adds depth to the rotation‚Ä¢ Future draft asset increases flexibility‚Ä¢ Trading away a 20-year-old Rookie of the Year candidate‚Ä¢ Risk of fan and media backlash for ‚Äúselling low‚Äù‚Ä¢ Podziemski and the pick may not match Castle‚Äôs long-term valueMost analysts view this trade as unlikely unless the Spurs feel pressure to rebalance their roster or Stephon Castle‚Äôs fit becomes untenable. As Zach Buckley noted when outlining the idea, the Spurs would probably only consider moving Castle if offered a more established star.‚Ä¢ Stephon Castle: Would step into Golden State‚Äôs rotation as both Curry‚Äôs running mate and heir apparent, with the Golden State Warriors‚Äô strong development staff guiding his growth.‚Ä¢ Brandin Podziemski: Likely to take on more responsibility in San Antonio, benefiting from a larger role in a rebuilding environment.‚Ä¢ Gui Santos: Could finally establish himself with more consistent minutes in San Antonio.‚Ä¢ Warriors come out ahead if Castle grows into a legitimate two-way star and bridges the gap between eras.‚Ä¢ Spurs only benefit if Podziemski thrives, the draft pick gains value, or if roster fit issues make Castle expendable.‚Ä¢ Current sentiment suggests San Antonio would reject this package, keeping Castle as part of its long-term plans with Victor Wembanyama and Fox.For the Golden State Warriors, a deal like this would be a bold attempt to remain relevant at the top of the league while preparing for the inevitable end of the Curry era. Castle could anchor their next great team if his development continues on its current trajectory.Also read: NBA Trade News: Los Angeles Lakers Sign $ 3,507,541 Defensive Center on Exhibit 10 Deal; How It Impacts Title Odds For San Antonio, trading Stephon Castle would represent a significant pivot, moving away from a rising star in favor of balance and draft flexibility.

Why This Move Makes Sense

Los Angeles Lakers‚Äô Roster Outlook

When thepulled off the blockbuster deal for Luka Doncic back in February, it came at a steep cost. Anthony Davis was shipped out in the process, leaving the Lakers without a reliable presence at center. Despite Jaxson Hayes stepping into the role, his minutes dwindled by the time the playoffs arrived. A near-deal for Charlotte Hornets big man Mark Williams fell apart due to a failed physical, only deepening the Lakers‚Äô frontcourt issues.Now, with DeAndre Ayton penciled in as the starting center, questions remain about whether Los Angeles has found the right fit - or if a smarter trade option is still on the table.A recent trade idea from Bleacher Report has reignited discussion around the Los Angeles Lakers‚Äô roster. The report suggests that Austin Reaves, one of L.A.‚Äôs most valuable assets, could be the key to unlocking a frontcourt upgrade.Here‚Äôs the deal as proposed:This trade would reunite Doncic with Dereck Lively II, a young center who already knows how to complement the Slovenian star‚Äôs style. Caleb Martin, meanwhile, adds depth as a two-way wing with postseason experience.Trading away Reaves wouldn‚Äôt be an easy decision for the Lakers.He‚Äôs a homegrown fan favorite who has shown his ability to score, distribute, and take big shots. But in the bigger picture, his fit alongside Doncic is less than ideal.A backcourt featuring both Reaves and Doncic raises defensive concerns, while the Lakers‚Äô more pressing need lies in the paint. Lively provides cornerstone potential defensively, while also offering the chemistry with Doncic that the team desperately needs.As Bleacher Report‚Äôs Zach Buckley explained, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a really good player. He‚Äôs also not a great trade asset. His growth potential is probably limited by his age (27), and he might be super expensive by this time next year.‚ÄùBuckley added that rather than paying Reaves long-term, the Lakers could package him in a deal that better complements their new superstar.If the Los Angeles Lakers want to maximize Doncic‚Äôs prime years, tailoring the roster around him should be the priority. That means surrounding him with players who:‚Ä¢ Can defend at a high level‚Ä¢ Space the floor when needed‚Ä¢ Already understand Doncic‚Äôs playmaking rhythmBoth Lively and Martin check those boxes, while Ayton offers additional interior scoring. Together, they could provide a more balanced structure that gives Los Angeles a shot at competing deep in the postseason.The Los Angeles Lakers are at a crossroads. Do they hold onto Austin Reaves and gamble on his long-term value, or do they flip him now for a younger, defensive-minded center who has proven chemistry with Luka Doncic?Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers‚Äô Path to Reuniting Luka Doncic with $90 Million Dallass Mavericks Star Could Become a Reality It‚Äôs a tough call, but for a team looking to win immediately, the trade for Dereck Lively II and Caleb Martin could be exactly the kind of move that defines their championship chances.","The Los Angeles Lakers are at a crossroads.

Also Read:

In the last episode of Netflix‚Äôs sports docuseries,a glimpse is shown of the camaraderie between now former Dallas Cowboys defensive end Micah Parsons and Cowboys owner Jerry Jones. During the 2023 playoffs, after the Cowboys were eliminated, Jones went to the locker room, hugged Parsons, and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm proud of you, you know that, okay? It‚Äôs a disappointment, but it wasn‚Äôt because of you. ‚Äù Micah heartbreakingly responded, ‚ÄúAll I wanna do is win.‚Äù Jones replied, ‚ÄúI know that. But I love you.‚ÄùHowever, more recently, Jones stated in a press conference that there was no question that Parsons could bring in a lot of resources in a trade, noting that this strategy had been on his mind since the hiring of the head coach Brian Schottenheimer: ‚ÄúThere was no question in our mind that Micah(Parsons) could bring a lot of resources in a trade. This has been on my mind since we hired Brian(Schottenheimer). So there was no question. ‚ÄùThe 26-year-old defensive end recently got traded to the Green Bay Packers.Michael David Smith of NBC Sports reported that the Cowboys freed up $19 million by trading DE Micah Parsons for defensive tackle Kenny Clark.The Cowboys now have an estimated $42 million in cap space for 2025, which gives them more room to sign other players and extend contracts of the current players, like cornerback DaRon Bland and left guard Tyler Smith.Discussing the importance of the freed-up cap space, Jerry Jones said, ‚ÄúWe got a lot of capital that is required to build a team. It takes many players to be tried to play in the NFL.It takes 11 on the field at the same time, it takes a minimum of 30 or 40‚Äìat minimum‚Äìto have both offense and defense, not including players that are involved in our special teams.So, it takes more than one. You do have to allocate your resources, whether it be draft picks or whether it be finances. You have to allocate those resources.There was no question in our mind that Micah(Parsons) could bring a lot of resources in a trade. That has been on my mind since we hired Brian(Schottenheimer). So, there was no question.As it turns out, all the publicity about not having a contract-certainly you did your part in making sure that it was known that he was potentially available, and I appreciate that very much, and I say that a little tongue and cheek. I'm not really as serious about it.But I will say this, that it was important that we did get-if we could get it-the kind of interest that we got in making a trade for Micah.He was an asset that we got four great years out of. But when you're talking about a contract, the kind that he got and for the future, that's quite a commitment. And none of that counts about what he did those first four years, it all goes against what he can do for you in the future-the length of that contract and maybe more.Well then, you've got to really weigh how many players-and I'm just going to give you this-not only do we immediately get a player, but those draft picks could get us-I'm talking top Pro Bowl-type players.‚ÄùIn 1989, Jerry Jones traded a premier running back, Herschel Walker, in exchange for eight draft picks, which included Minnesota‚Äôs next three first-round picks.The trade happened between three teams‚Äìthe Cowboys, Minnesota Vikings, and the San Diego Chargers‚Äìand involved eighteen players and draft picks.A similar situation was at stake in the present scenario with Micah Parsons‚Äô trade.Regarding the acquisition of draft picks, Jerry Jones said,‚ÄúThose draft picks could get top, Pro Bowl-type players. Could. Not necessarily. Let me be quick to say‚Äìyou won‚Äôt necessarily get those players.You‚Äôve got to draft them or acquire them. But they can get us as few as three or any many as five outstanding players.Now, not only do they contribute in a game that needs a lot of players on the field‚Äìnot to be elementary‚Äìbut they also give you better odds that they‚Äôre going to be a high percentage of those are going to be available just from the standpoint of attrition or from the standpoint of just sheer limit on how far one player can go.Very few players are Deion (Sanders) playing a hundred plays a game out there at the time. So this was not just thought about today.This (Micah Parsons)trade has been going on in our minds and our strategies and being talked about--it's been going on all spring. It culminated today, and it came quick, but that's the way things go. It does happen fast when it happens.But you've laid a lot of things out there on the water to make it happen. I want to be sure that our fans understand I think a lot of Micah, and I wish him so much success.Micah Parsons did an outstanding job for us for four years, and a little bit of the way Herschel Walker may have had his greatest contribution to the Cowboys, what he brought to us when he left could be a tremendous thing for our fans and the success of this team.Kenny Clark. We really knew beginning this spring that if we could pick up a top interior defensive lineman, just to offset not having a pass rusher, even though it's Micah-but where we're long, where we're strong, it's in our pass rushing depth.And we knew, if we could get an interior lineman that that was at least something that would improve us right there on a top interior lineman. He comes in strong for us. And he comes in accomplished for us.So we're glad to have him. It was a prerequisite. We went down the teams. We only picked teams that had room on their cap that could pay Micah, and we only picked teams that had top tackles.‚Äù","The Dallas Cowboys have a history of making blockbuster trades like the Herschel Walker deal.

Poll Do you think Lalit Modi was right to release the unseen footage of the 'Slap-gate' incident? Yes, it was necessary to reveal the truth No, it reopened old wounds Unsure

NEW DELHI: Former Indian Premier League IPL ) commissioner Lalit Modi has defended his decision to release an unseen video of the infamous 2008 ‚ÄúSlap-gate‚Äù incident, saying he only spoke the truth when asked and had no intention of reopening old wounds. His remarks came in response to criticism from Bhuvneshwari, wife of former India pacer S Sreesanth , who slammed Modi and former Australia captain Michael Clarke for reviving the episode through a podcast discussion.The controversy reignited after Modi appeared on Clarke‚Äôs Beyond23 Cricket Podcast, where he disclosed previously unseen footage showing Harbhajan Singh striking Sreesanth with a backhanded slap during post-match handshakes between Mumbai Indians and Kings XI Punjab. Harbhajan was later handed an 11-match suspension, and both cricketers have since reconciled, with the former off-spinner publicly apologising multiple times.""I don‚Äôt know why she (Sreesanth‚Äôs wife Bhuvneshwari) is getting angry. I was asked a question, and I shared the truth. I can‚Äôt do anything about that. I am known to speak the truth. Sree was the victim, and that‚Äôs exactly what I said. No one had asked me this question earlier, so when Clarke quipped, I responded,"" Modi told IANS.In the podcast, Modi explained how his private security camera had recorded the exact moment after the broadcasters had stopped theirs. ""As players were exchanging handshakes, Bhajji just looked at Sreesanth, said something, and gave him a backhander. That's what the footage shows. I've had it for 18 years,"" Modi said, stressing that the clip had never been made public until now.Bhuvneshwari, however, described the release as ""disgusting, heartless and inhuman."" In a scathing post on social media, she wrote: ""Shame on you @lalitkmodi and @michaelclarkeofficial. Both @sreesanthnair36 and Harbhajan have long moved on in life and are fathers now with school-going children, and yet you try to throw them back into an old wound.""She added that the revival of the controversy was deeply painful for their family: ""@sreesanthnair36 has rebuilt his life with dignity and grace after every hardship he faced. Families are being forced to relive trauma that was buried decades ago. This doesn‚Äôt just hurt the players; it scars their innocent children who now have to face questions and shame for no fault of theirs.""Meanwhile, cricket commentator Harsha Bhogle shed light on why the footage had remained suppressed for years. ""Interesting that the Harbhajan-Sreesanth video has found its way out after 17 years. Very few of us had seen it and we had given our word that it would stay out of the public domain because the IPL was in its first year and it wouldn't have been the best bit of news for it,"" Bhogle posted on X.","Lalit Modi defends decision to release unseen video of 'Slap-gate' incident.

Vaibhav Sooryavanshi's impact

NEW DELHI: Before the England tour, Vihaan Malhotra was on the brink of losing his place in the Indian U19 team. The runs had dried up, he was not able to convert his starts. The 18-year-old from Patiala had sacrificed his designated opening role to his two superstar teammates -- Vaibhav Sooryavanshi and Ayush Mhatre. Overall, the southpaw was not in a good space.Right before the tour of England, while training at the Cricket Hub Academy in Patiala, Malhotra's coach Kamalpreet Sandhu, who has trained the likes of Prabhsimran Singh, Anmolpreet Singh, Naman Dhir, and Kanika Malhotra, gave him an ultimatum, that he needs to stop cribbing and start working on his new role.""He has opened all his life. Batting at No. 3 was an adjustment for him. I just gave him the reality check that Vaibhav and Ayush had earned it, and what had he done? He should make that No. 3 spot his own,"" Kamalpreet told TimesofIndia.com.Then a day before the big tour, VVS Laxman , the Head of Cricket at the Centre of Excellence (CoE), also shared a few valuable suggestions with the youngster. He ended up scoring 233 runs in five Youth ODIs and was instrumental in India's success in two Youth Tests, with 277 runs with the bat and three crucial wickets with his off-spin.He shied away from disclosing what VVS Laxman told him but said the small input changed his game. He told TimesofIndia.com, ""He just wanted me to enjoy my game. He never goes technical. He gives inputs, small ones, but it was perfect.""""It was an excellent and enthralling experience for me. It was the first time I went to England. I had heard a lot about English playing conditions. The seam movement, the weather, and it tests the technique of the subcontinent batters. There were nerves but I enjoyed the way I batted in England. I made a few technical adjustments and by the end of the tour, I became a better batter,"" he said.His performances have been rewarded with the vice-captaincy for the Australia tour, where the India U-19 side will play three one-day games and two multi-day matches, starting September 21.From battling the seam and swing, he is getting ready for the bouncy tracks of Australia.""For the past one month, he has been training 12 hours a day. I am training him on a wet cement track, sometimes with plastic balls, sometimes with the tennis ball. There are a few bruises but he has improved significantly,"" said Sandhu.For this current India U-19 setup, Vihaan suggests they don't need to look elsewhere for inspiration. They are sharing a dressing room with superstars, who had lit up IPL 2025 with their power-packed batting. Among the opponents, there were two England prodigies -- Rocky Flintoff and Archie Vaughan -- sons of legendary England cricketers Andrew Flintoff and Michael Vaughan , respectively.""The focus on Vaibhav and Ayush kind of helped me as I went under the radar,"" said Malhotra with a laugh.""They knew about Mhatre and Vaibhav. They wanted to get them out early. All the bowlers wanted to get the wicket of IPL players.""Barring his two centuries -- one in Youth Test, the other in Youth ODI -- and watching Shubman Gill's special at Edgbaston, the most enjoyable memory of the England tour was teasing Vaibhav Sooryavanshi, when his fans came over to meet him in one of their matches.""Vaibhav ke fans aaye hue the. Wo bol rahe the ki Vaibhav ko bulao, aur use sharm aa rahi thi. Hum use chidhate rehte the (Vaibhav's fans came to meet him. He was signing autographs but was really embarrassed and we also teased him a lot). He is the youngest of the lot, so we always kind of try and take care of him,"" said Malhotra.""In the fourth one-day, I put on 209 runs for the second wicket with Vaibhav. We both scored centuries but he smoked 10 sixes and I had the best seat in the house. His bat swing is something we are in awe of,"" he added. Vihaan scored 129 off 121 balls, whereas Sooryavanshi had tonked 143 runs in 78 balls, studded with 13 fours and 10 sixes.Malhotra does seek inspiration from Sooryavanshi and Mhatre but believes their presence has only enhanced his appetite.""Cricketing field always teaches you new things. For example, in my case, I have two absolute superstars in my team. Competition is there, and in the future, people will compare us with them as well but it is good for us. When Vaibhav was hitting sixes for fun in the IPL, it pumped me to work hard,"" he said.Malhotra doesn't have any lofty deals. For now, he is getting ready for the Australia tour, followed by the U-19 World Cup to be held next year in Namibia and Zimbabwe. But he has his eyes set on playing domestic cricket.""I really want to break into the Punjab Ranji Trophy team. I want to do well for my state.""Malhotra wants to follow in his idol Shubman Gill's footsteps -- do well in the U-19 World Cup, score heaps of runs in domestic cricket and then, if all goes well, the obvious will happen.",Vihaan Malhotra was on the brink of losing his place in the Indian U19 team. The 18-year-old from Patiala had sacrificed his designated opening role to his two superstar teammates. He ended up scoring 233 runs in five Youth ODIs and was instrumental in India's success in two Youth Tests.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123609506,imgsize-13936,width-400,resizemode-4/vihaan-malhotra.jpg"

Refused ‚Äòbroader‚Äô role

Parag captaincy the sticking point?

Is there a chance Samson might stay?

In a major shake-up at Rajasthan Royals , former India captain Rahul Dravid has stepped down as head coach ahead of the IPL-2026 season. This surprise move comes just one year into Dravid‚Äôs much-heralded return to the franchise and adds to the uncertainty surrounding the team following reports that regular captain Sanju Samson too wants to move on.Royals confirmed in an official statement on Saturday that Dravid would not carry on as head coach, cutting short a multi-year deal after just a single, disappointing season. The 2025 campaign was a disaster for the 2008 champions ‚Äî they finished a dismal ninth, with only four wins. The poor performance was compounded by personal challenges for Dravid, as a foot injury sustained in a club match forced him to coach from a wheelchair for much of the season.Dravid has had a long and fruitful association with the franchise. Before this, he played and captained from 2011-2013 and served as mentor in 2014 and 2015.The Royals‚Äô decision comes after a ‚Äòstructural review‚Äô, following which Dravid was offered a broader, more expansive role within the franchise. However, the cricket legend turned down the offer and expressed a desire to move on. Sources told TOI the franchise‚Äôs review meeting was held last month in the UK and was also attended by Dravid.‚ÄúRahul has been central to the Royals‚Äô journey over many years. His leadership has influenced a generation of players, built strong values within the squad and left an indelible mark on the culture of the franchise,‚Äù the Royals statement read.The decision follows rumours of reported discord between the Royals management and skipper Samson. The wheels started to come off the franchise‚Äôs 2025 campaign when such tensions entered the realm of public speculation following some bizarre decisions during the first three games.Because Samson ‚Äòlacked‚Äô full clearance for wicketkeeping duties after a finger surgery, the management used him only as an ‚Äòimpact sub‚Äô while Assam player Riyan Parag was made stand-in captain, particularly for matches in Guwahati, the franchise‚Äôs second ‚Äòhome‚Äô.The move backfired and drew fierce criticism from fans and pundits alike, who pointed to Riyan‚Äôs own inconsistent performances, especially with the likes of established talents like Yashasvi Jaiswal too available to lead. Later on in the season, rumours of a reported rift between Dravid and Samson also surfaced, which the former denied saying ‚Äúwe are all on the same page‚Äù.With Dravid‚Äôs storied second stint now over and the captain potentially on his way out, the franchise is faced with a monumental rebuilding task. Sources say the onus is now on director of cricket Kumar Sangakkara to forge a path forward for the team.‚ÄúThe decision on Sanju is still under consideration,‚Äù the source added.","Rahul Dravid has stepped down as head coach of Rajasthan Royals.

Poll Do you think Pakistan can maintain their winning streak leading up to the Asia Cup? Yes, they are in great form No, they will face tougher opponents

Pakistan continued their impressive run of form ahead of the Asia Cup, registering their second consecutive victory in the ongoing T20 tri-series with a 31-run win over the United Arab Emirates in Sharjah on Saturday.Opener Saim Ayub and youngster Hasan Nawaz were the architects of Pakistan‚Äôs commanding total of 207, both striking blistering half-centuries. Ayub top-scored with a 38-ball 69 laced with seven fours and four sixes, while Nawaz stole the show with a 26-ball 56, hammering six maximums including a hat-trick of sixes off spinner Haider Ali. Their counter-attacking knocks rescued Pakistan from an early wobble at 74 for three and gave the innings its momentum.Ayub, named Player of the Match, downplayed personal recognition in favour of the team‚Äôs collective success. ‚ÄúDifferent players are performing in different games. Good for the team. I don‚Äôt like individual awards, feel it is over-rated. It is a team game. It is all about execution,‚Äù he said, adding that he has been working on his bowling as well. ‚ÄúIt is challenging in T20s.You need to believe in your thought process. ‚ÄùHasan Nawaz, touted as a rising star, shared a 57-run stand with Mohammad Nawaz (25 off 15) to power Pakistan past 200. Faheem Ashraf chipped in with a useful 16 as Pakistan plundered 64 in the final five overs.Despite Junaid Siddique and Saghir Khan‚Äôs three-wicket hauls, UAE were left chasing a steep target. Their innings revolved around Asif Khan‚Äôs breathtaking 77 off 35 balls, which briefly threatened to turn the game on its head, but he fell in the last over. Skipper Muhammad Waseem also contributed a brisk 33 but admitted afterwards: ‚ÄúWe gave 15-20 runs extra. Asif has calibre‚Ä¶ we needed someone to score 30-40 runs in the middle overs. We will try our best in the next game.‚ÄùPakistan captain Salman Ali Agha praised his side‚Äôs intent while acknowledging room for improvement. ‚ÄúPerfect batting effort. Last five overs in the bowling we need to work. Hasan Nawaz is a generational talent, one for the future. I want my team to play an aggressive brand of cricket,‚Äù he said.With back-to-back wins, including a 39-run victory over Afghanistan on Friday, Pakistan look primed and confident as they build momentum heading into the Asia Cup showdown.","Pakistan beat United Arab Emirates by 31 runs in T20 tri-series.

New Jersey Devils prospect Arseniy Gritsyuk, who previously had a stellar run at the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL), is all set to arrive in New Jersey this week. It has been revealed by New Jersey Devils assistant general manager Dan MacKinnon to NHL.com recently that Gritsyuk is expected to arrive in New Jersey soon.As per reports, the 24-year-old Russian player was selected 129th overall in the 2019 NHL Draft, the same year the Devils took Jack Hughes first overall. After several seasons in the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL), the winger is now ready to compete for a spot in the NHL. Let‚Äôs take a look at what Dan MacKinnon is expecting from Arnesiy this season. Arseniy Gritsyuk , a promising prospect for the New Jersey Devils , is gearing up for a major milestone in his career. This week, he‚Äôs making his way to New Jersey to pursue his NHL debut after his stellar run in the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL).As per reports, he officially signed with the Devils in May and is confirmed to be traveling to North America. Fans and the team‚Äôs expectations are already set high, as last season, Gritsyuk tallied 17 goals and 27 assists for 44 points in 49 games.Speaking about Arnesiy, the New Jersey Devils assistant general manager Dan MacKinnon said, ‚ÄúIf you're looking for an NHL comparison, I look at Evgenii Dadonov, who came over early, but it didn‚Äôt work.He went back to the KHL for several years and then came over the second time, which was more in line with the age Gritsyuk is now, and it went very well. He further added, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre hoping the added time that Arseni took in the KHL means the first audition sticks. ‚ÄùEarlier, while speaking to Russian outlet TASS, MacKinnon stated, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have any favorite hockey players ‚Äî you evaluate them from a professional point of view. I studied the team‚Äôs roster. Yes, there‚Äôs Jack Hughes, Nico Hischier ‚Äî top-six center forwards. I‚Äôd like to join them, but we‚Äôll see how ready I am.‚ÄùNew Jersey Devils assistant general manager Dan MacKinnon has shared the exciting lineup of players in his team, including Arnesiy Gritsyuk. He praised the Devils‚Äô two franchise centers, speaking out about their contrasting style of work.Speaking about the dominance of centers, Jack Hughes and Nico Hischier, MacKinnon stated, ‚ÄúHughes skates well, Hischier is more of a two-way forward, and he can also fight in defense. It is clear that Hughes is a superstar, and the whole team is built around him to get results. So it will be harder with him in the line ‚Äî you will have to do more work. But it makes no difference to me which of them I play with.‚ÄùMeanwhile, Gritsyuk and the Devils‚Äô staff are waiting in anticipation to see how he transitions to the North American game. Reports suggest that the debutant will make his debut at training camp this month, giving fans their first real look at what he can bring to the ice.","Arseniy Gritsyuk, a promising prospect for the New Jersey Devils, is gearing up for a major milestone in his career.

Sidney Crosby sets the tone at Canada‚Äôs Olympic camp



Connor McDavid follows Sidney Crosby‚Äôs subtle leadership cue



Sam Reinhart completes the chain of respect in the interview moment

Crosby‚Äôs influence extends beyond goals and trophies



Canada‚Äôs men‚Äôs hockey stars gathered this week to prepare for the 2026 Winter Olympic Games. The orientation camp brought together elite names such as Sidney Crosby, Connor McDavid , and Sam Reinhart. In the middle of it, a quiet moment stood out. Crosby, known for leading without fanfare, once again showed why he is still viewed as the standard for Canadian hockey.On Friday, players lined up for interviews following practice. Crosby stood next to McDavid and Reinhart, preparing for questions. Before anything began, Crosby leaned toward McDavid and gave a quick nudge. The signal was simple: remove the team hat as a sign of respect for those asking the questions.The act was small, but it captured what Crosby has represented throughout his career. He has never needed speeches to prove his point. His actions consistently show teammates and rivals alike what professionalism looks like. At 38, Crosby is still shaping the culture around him, even with Canada‚Äôs brightest young stars beside him.Connor McDavid, already the face of the Edmonton Oilers and one of the game‚Äôs most dominant players, reacted immediately.He slipped off his cap and gave a nod of recognition. The moment showed that even hockey‚Äôs biggest current star is still learning from Crosby‚Äôs approach.Crosby has long been seen as a mentor for McDavid, whether in international tournaments or casual settings. On Friday, the exchange underscored that influence. Without a word spoken, Crosby reminded McDavid of an unwritten standard. Respect for the game and those who cover it is part of what defines Canadian hockey tradition.McDavid then leaned toward Sam Reinhart with the same cue. Reinhart followed suit, removing his cap as well, and in just a few seconds, Crosby‚Äôs gesture had shaped the actions of both men. It was leadership passed down in real time.Reinhart, fresh off a Stanley Cup win with the Florida Panthers, is not short on confidence or credentials. But like McDavid, he responded to the example Crosby set. For observers, it showed how habits at the top can influence everyone around, and the chain reaction became a symbol of unity within Canada‚Äôs Olympic camp.The brief sequence may not appear on any highlight reel. But it reflects what makes Crosby unique, and he has defined Canadian hockey for nearly two decades. Not only with championships and medals, but also with conduct that embodies humility, his influence remains strong even among players who have built their own legacies.As the countdown to Milan 2026 continues, Canada will lean on experience and skill. Crosby brings both, along with an instinct for moments that remind teammates what respect looks like. In a camp filled with stars, Crosby once again stood apart, not for scoring, but for setting the tone.Also Read: Keep an eye on these NHL sophomores in 2025-26: Cutter Gauthier, Zack Bolduc, Marco Kasper, Will Smith, Mackie Samoskevich","Sidney Crosby once again showed why he is still viewed as the standard for Canadian hockey.

On Tuesday, August 26, Indiana Fever shooting guard Lexie Hull and Seattle Storm's Gabby Williams were involved in an on-court collision. The whole thing looked pretty nasty to onlookers, and the Fever star definitely looked like she had suffered an injury. And it was revealed 2 days later, on August 28, when, after a fan asked about her well-being, that she is now sporting 2 very distinct black eyes. Not a good look on her for sure!On August 26, the WNBA teams, Indiana Fever and Seattle Storm, met for a pretty standard game of ball. The Fevers won 95 to 75, with Hull making 5 points, 9 rebounds, and 1 assist in the game, before an on-court collision with Seattle Storm's power forward, Gabby Williams, made her go back to the locker room. The whole thing looked pretty awful, and fans were obviously worried about Hull, and if she was okay.Answering a fan question on TikTok, Hull revealed her face in a video, where she was seen with two prominent black eyes. She said, ""It's not doing great, I wish this was a filter, but this is insane... The knot is gone. Instead, I just have two black eyes. So, yeah, this is me!"" Hopefully, the injury more superficial than anything else.The Indiana Fever are all set to face the Los Angeles Sparks on August 29 at the latter's home base. The Fever are the favorites to win the match, even with their star player, Caitlin Clark, missing out after suffering from a right groin injury back in mid-July. And now with Lexie Hull sporting two black eyes, things look even more dicey. But fans aren't confident that the second-to-last team in the WNBA Western Conference will be able to prevail against the Fever.As for Hull, she has not yet been listed on the injury report against the Sparks for their Fever's game on Friday. She even boarded the plane with the rest of her teammates, even if she was still wearing those big sunglasses. The match starts in a few hours, but fans are hoping that Hull will be well enough to be back on the court, even if it's for a little while.Also Read: Ex-NBA player explains what Giannis Antetokounmpo needs to bring in the FIBA EuroBasket","Indiana Fever shooting guard Lexie Hull and Seattle Storm's Gabby Williams were involved in an on-court collision on August 26.

Kai Cenat has a history of live-stream explosions



Kai Cenat‚Äôs Mafiathon 3 has been in the spotlight since the release of its trailer. While the event‚Äôs content cannot be predicted, the one thing that remains certain is that, with the stakes skyrocketing, it‚Äôs going to be much bigger than Mafiathon 2. Especially with some of the unexpected challenges and outrageous dares being received, it has made the 30-day event a must-watch.Here is all you need to know about it.In a recent clip circulating online, popular streamer xQc can be seen reacting to the Kai Cenats Mafiathon 3 trailer. Instead of criticism or appreciation, he seemed to have stepped up the game with chaotic advice.xQc did not hold back while he suggested Kai Cenat must commemorate hitting 1 million subscribers by literally blowing up his house.xQc said with a smile, while enthusiastically trying to mimic the sound of a massive explosion.Watching the trailer ahead, he even offered an alternative proposal of organizing a massive giveaway in the middle of the city. He further advised on turning New York City intoThe explosive suggestion coming from him just amplified all the anticipation that surrounds the final subscriber goals of the event.The wild idea coming from xQc is not random. It comes after he watched Michael B. Jordan in Mafiathon 3‚Äôs trailer daring Kai Cenat with an unexpected challenge, for going bigger than Mafiathon 2.In the trailer, the Hollywood star dared Cenat to cut his signature hairstyle on reaching 1 million subscribers during a 30-day stream. After some reluctance, Cenat agreed to it, putting his personal style right on the line to commemorate his success.The combination of personal change and property damage has perfectly set the stage for an unforgettable conclusion of the streaming trilogy. It also makes one question whether the dare or the challenge will be fulfilled.While the ideal coming from xQc seems surprising, it‚Äôs important to note that this isn‚Äôt the first time destruction has been part of the streaming narrative for Kai Cenat. It was just last year when the news spread like fire about how, on July 4, 2024, Cenat‚Äôs stream devolved into a fireworks war. The incident involved AMP Davis and, of course, left Cenat‚Äôs streaming room in complete ruins. While fans believe it was pre-planned, the memory of the explosive event makes the suggestion of xQc more terrifying and plausible.The precedent that was set by the chaotic celebrations previously confirms that the streamer isn‚Äôt a stranger to such explosive challenges and celebrations. It therefore leaves viewers wondering, How far will things go this time? With Mafiathon 3 called the final in the series, there‚Äôs already immense pressure on delivering a memorable finale. Only time can tell which advice Cenat accepts and what he ignores.Mafiathon 3 will begin on September 1, 2025.","Kai Cenat‚Äôs Mafiathon 3 has been in the spotlight since the release of its trailer.

The August 29 edition of WWE Friday Night SmackDown was the last regular show of the promotion before the upcoming PPV in France - Clash in Paris. The event was held at the LDLC Arena in Lyon, France, and featured quite a few exciting fights before the big show on August 31.From appearances by John Cena , Cody Rhodes, Tiffany Stratton, and Randy Orton, to high-stakes matches like the United States Title match between Solo Sikoa and Sami Zayn to Charlotte Flair & Alexa Bliss facing off the Secret Hervice (Piper Niven and Alba Fyre) for the WWE Women‚Äôs Tag Team titles, the night was filled with action. Let's take a look at everything that went down.The night started with a face-off between John Cena and Logan Paul , who have a match set for Clash in Paris. Paul begins by trying to hype himself up to the audience, who, of course, go about booing him from start to finish. He also talks smack about Cena, but before he can continue, Cena himself shows up to interrupt his tirade. The crowd, of course, is thrilled to have the Cenation Leader there, chanting his name and giving him standing ovations.Cena tells Paul that without the fans, he is nothing, and calls him a wannabe who understands nothing about the business. After a little more back and forth, John Cena leaves the ring while talking about respect. He then sees the boy he had called ""toxic"" during his heel run and apologizes to him with a sorry and a thank you before leaving.The first match of the night is the WWE Women‚Äôs Tag Team title match between Charlotte Flair & Alexa Bliss vs Secret Hervice. Bliss and Flair are blindsided by Alba Fyre while walking up to the ramp, who injures Flair before the match can even begin. Security takes her away, and the fans are told that the match has now been changed to a singles match between Alexa Bliss and Chelsea Green.The match started off with both women on equal footing, but soon Green took control. They both tried to use their finishers to end the match in their favour, but the other always seemed to kick out before the three-count. Even with Fyre interfering multiple times, in the end, Bliss managed to roll Green for the win.But after the match, it turned into a numbers game when Green and Fyre ganged up on Bliss to take her out. An injured Flair runs in to save her partner, and though it looked like she had things in control, the Secret Hervice had the two beat to stand tall in the end.Michin makes her entrance into the ring before Kiana James shows up, flanked by Giulia - the Women‚Äôs U.S. Champion. One of the shortest matches ever, it ended in less than 10 seconds. James tried to hit Michin with her purse, but Michin managed to sidestep and rolled her up for a pin and win.Giulia then attacked Michin after the match and drove the latter's face into the steps.Drew McIntyre makes his way to the ring to talk about the RKO from Randy Orton that took him out last week. He asked Michael Cole if there was any update on Cody Rhodes , who replied in the negative. He then called out Orton, who emerged to the fans singing his name.They have a little back and forth, before McIntyre drops a Glasgow Kiss headbutt on Orton. He tries to go for a Claymore Kick, but Orton dodges it and hits McIntyre with a Draping DDT, followed by a Viper's Pose. The officials soon run in to stop Orton from doing more damage and McIntyre is seen rolling out of the ring and walking away.Backstage, Bo Dallas interrupts Melo Don't Miz while the tag team partners are seen warming up for their upcoming match. The three have a little exchange before Dallas walks away, and Melo is seen doing a fist bump with Miz.We also have a short stint involving SmackDown General Manager Nick Aldis who admonished Orton for attacking the security guards. He gives Orton a bottle of Fireball whiskey, but he leaves without it. R-Truth then makes his entrance and asks Aldis if he is going to drink that, to which Aldis says that, after the day he's had, he just might.With both tag teams coming from a win, this match promised an exciting premise. The Street Profits beat MFT's JC Mateo and Tonga Loa with a little help from Sami Zayn and Jimmy Uso, while the Melo Don‚Äôt Miz duo beat Fraxiom. Now they face each other for the #1 Contenders match for the WWE Tag Titles, with TSP making their entrance alongside B-Fab, followed by Melo Don't Miz.It's a pretty evenly matched fight, with both tag teams having good and some not-so-good moments. Montez Ford hit The Miz with a top rope frog splash followed by Carmelo Hayes hitting Ford with a top rope splash. But things take a turn when The Wyatt Sicks make an entrance, distracting Miz. Angelo Dawkins runs over Miz and throws him off the apron, before the duo hit The Revelation on Hayes, leading to Dawkins getting the pin on Melo.The winners - The Street Profits, will now face The Wyatt Sicks - the current champions at Clash in Paris for the WWE Tag Team Championship.The United States Championship title has been challenged once more, and Solo Sikoa came down to face Sami Zayn to retain his title belt. The final match of the night is here, with Zayn and Sikoa making their way into the ring. It's a numbers game from the beginning, and the MFTs try to interfere multiple times. Sikoa hits a Spinning Solo on Zayn for a near fall, but then Jimmy Uso shows up. The MFTs are there to stop him, but then Jacob Fatu comes in to take Talla Tonga.Zayn in the meantime, hit Sikoa with a Blue Thunder Bomb for a near fall, while the latter was distracted with all the chaos around him. The MFTs are busy fighting Uso and Fatu, and Zayn takes the chance to once again go after Sikoa, this time without any hindrance on his way. Though Sijoa sidesteps a Helluva Kick, he could not escape a Spinning Solo on the broadcast table. At the end, Zayn hit a couple of Helluva Kicks to take the win and become the new United States Champion.Also Read: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs an absolute maniac!‚Äù: Former WWE writer alleges Vince McMahon‚Äôs sexual misconduct with Ashley Massaro","The August 29 edition of WWE Friday Night SmackDown was the last regular show of the promotion before the upcoming PPV in France - Clash in Paris.

India Asia Cup squad press conference: What Ajit Agarkar, Surya said on shocking calls

Poll Do you agree with Sunil Gavaskar's stance on foreign players commenting on Indian cricket selections? Yes, they should stay out No, they can share their opinions

NEW DELHI: Former India captain Sunil Gavaskar hit out at overseas stars like South Africa legend AB de Villiers for questioning Shreyas Iyer ‚Äôs omission from India‚Äôs Asia Cup 2025 squad.De Villiers, speaking on his YouTube channel, had suggested that Iyer's absence was not purely performance-based and hinted at ‚Äúsomething going on behind the scenes.‚Äù He also claimed that the batter's inclusion could have led to an ‚Äúego clash,‚Äù citing Iyer's recent exploits as captain in the IPL and domestic circuit.Gavaskar, however, minced no words in dismissing de Villiers' comments. Writing in his column for Sportstar, he blasted foreign players for interfering in Indian cricket matters.‚ÄúWhat is baffling, though, is that foreigners with no stake in Indian cricket and little knowledge about it wade into the debate, adding fuel to the fire. However great they may be as players, the selection of the Indian team is strictly none of their business. They should focus on their country's cricket and let us Indians worry about ours,‚Äù Gavaskar wrote.The legendary opener stressed that Indian cricketers never comment on the selection matters of other nations.‚ÄúIt's almost as if the selection is perfect and they have no comments to make. So why butt your nose into the selection of the Indian team? Have you ever heard Indian ex-cricketers talk about the selection of other countries' teams? No, we mind our own business,‚Äù he added.Gavaskar didn't spare the Indian media either, accusing them of amplifying overseas opinions for validation.‚ÄúTo an extent, the Indian media is also responsible, as they go to overseas cricketers and ask them about Indian cricket. How often do we see Indian journalists chasing foreign players ‚Äì whom even their own countries have forgotten ‚Äì just to get a quote on India? It's as if our cricket needs validation from them,‚Äù he argued.With India gearing up for the Asia Cup, Gavaskar's fiery words have reignited the debate over external influence in Indian cricketing discourse.",Gavaskar hits out at overseas stars like AB de Villiers for questioning Shreyas Iyer's omission from India‚Äôs Asia Cup 2025 squad.

The Indian men‚Äôs hockey team might be the seventh-ranked team in the world and No.1 in Asia, but they were given quite a scare by the Chinese side in their Asia Cup opener at Rajgir Sports Complex here on Friday.So much was the domination by the Chinese players that the Indian side failed to hold their own on numerous occasions. They made errors, failed to keep their structures and their defenders gave away the balls easily because of which China, in the end, won as many six penalty corners and converted three of them.It was quite uncanny to see India concede three PCs considering the hosts have always done well in defending them. And that is one of the major areas that the team will have to improve upon as they face off against Japan in their second group game of the tournament here on Sunday.Speaking after the match on Friday, Craig Fulton clearly pointed it out. Even Amit Rohidas , one of the best rushers in the world, was disappointed with the team‚Äôs efforts and said, ‚ÄúWe failed to take our chances. Also, we will have to be ready at the back because the one or two balls that they got, we made mistakes there and we will have to rectify them in the upcoming match.‚ÄùHowever, it‚Äôs easier said than done because, as Fulton said, being the best team in the competition, all the other teams will play out of their skin against the hosts.‚ÄúWe are going to be their biggest game. So that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs always going to be. We are supposedly the highest-ranked team and we‚Äôre the favourites. So, every team is going to lift themselves to play us. We have to manage that challenge,‚Äù the coach added.India, meanwhile, will take heart from the fact that Harmanpreet Singh looked in great touch and scored a hat-trick in the first match. He is making a comeback of sorts after struggling with injuries during the Pro League games in India as well as in Europe. He did miss a few PCs and failed to convert a penalty stroke against China, but he showed his class when he sent in the winner into the top-right corner of the net.Hardik Singh was also as good as ever and the way he connected with Mandeep Singh upfront on a couple of occasions was a delight to the eyes. But the goalkeepers will have to pick up their game if India are to maintain the scoreboard pressure on their opponents.Besides their opponents, India‚Äôs other challenge will be the extreme heat that has been making life difficult for most of the players. It was no different on Saturday as the players continued to struggle. But it did rain a little during the match between Malaysia and South Korea and there are chances of scattered showers on Sunday, too.Meanwhile, Japan are coming into the game after a 7-0 win against Kazakhstan but in the last five games against India, they have lost four times. Only once during the 2023 Asian Champions Trophy in Chennai, they earned a 1-1 draw and will be more than happy if they can achieve the same result on Sunday.",India's men's hockey team were beaten 3-1 by China in their Asia Cup opener.

The ankle twist

Experts weigh in





A bruise on the hand of a 79-year-old man wouldn‚Äôt normally make headlines, unless that man is Donald Trump, the president who campaigned in 2024 on being sharper, stronger, and healthier than Joe Biden What began as a curious blotch on his hand has spiraled into months of speculation, with the White House offering shifting explanations that have only deepened doubts about Trump‚Äôs health.The saga began on February 24, 2025, when a Getty photographer snapped Trump greeting French President Emmanuel Macron.The close-up revealed a dark bruise smeared with makeup, clumsily concealed but unmistakable.Observers soon realized the mark had been visible as far back as spring 2024, when Trump himself dismissed it as the byproduct of ‚Äúoverzealous handshakes.‚Äù‚ÄúA woman gripped my hand so hard, the Secret Service had to step in,‚Äù Trump told the Washington Examiner in 2024. He repeated the story to Time magazine later that year.But as the bruise lingered into 2025, the explanation began to unravel.By summer, Trump was regularly spotted with mismatched concealer caked on his hand.A C-SPAN cameraman zoomed in on the blotchy makeup during a July press event, sparking fresh scrutiny.The White House doubled down, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt calling the bruise nothing more than ‚Äúsoft tissue irritation‚Äù from endless handshakes and daily aspirin.Then came the curveball. At the FIFA Club World Cup Final in New Jersey on July 13, Trump was photographed with swollen ankles. Days later, the White House abandoned the handshake defense and admitted the president had been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), a vascular condition common in older adults that hampers blood flow from the legs to the heart.Trump‚Äôs doctor, Sean Barbabella, assured reporters there was ‚Äúno evidence of heart failure or serious illness.‚Äù But crucial details about treatment remain undisclosed, with Leavitt insisting, ‚ÄúYou see the president every day, he‚Äôs working, he‚Äôs moving, he‚Äôs continuing.‚ÄùNot everyone is convinced the story adds up. Dr Peter Henke, a former chair of the American Heart Association‚Äôs vascular council, told New York Magazine that the bruising on Trump‚Äôs hand is ‚Äúunrelated to venous insufficiency.‚Äù Instead, Henke suggested, aspirin use could explain the unusual bruising.The White House has not allowed Dr Barbabella to face questions directly, despite earlier promising transparency.","Donald Trump, 79, was photographed with a bruise on his hand in February 2025.

At 19, Barron Trump may be the youngest member of the Trump family, but insiders say his place among the siblings tells a story of contrasts. While Donald Jr, Ivanka, and Eric grew up together under Donald Trump‚Äôs first marriage to Ivana, Barron was born more than two decades later to Melania, a gap that has shaped how he relates to his brothers and sisters.Those close to the family say Barron has never quite clicked with his older siblings. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not tension so much as distance,‚Äù one insider told Daily Mail, noting that the age difference left Barron more like a nephew than a brother to the Trump trio. Tiffany Trump , however, is different. At 31, she is the closest in age to Barron and, like him, grew up away from the family‚Äôs first household. Tiffany was raised by Trump‚Äôs second wife, Marla Maples, which, some say, gave her an understanding of Barron‚Äôs ‚Äúoutsider‚Äù position in the family.That bond is evident on Tiffany‚Äôs social media, where she has posted heartfelt birthday messages to her youngest brother. One from 2020 reads: ‚ÄúHappy 14th birthday to the best ‚Äòlittle‚Äô brother I could ever ask for! You mean so much to me, Barron‚Ä¶ Love you!‚Äù Another photo from 2021 shows the pair smiling together next to a giant Minnie Mouse.Melania has often described Barron as ‚Äúmini Donald,‚Äù but unlike his father, the NYU student is shy and reserved. Those who know him say Tiffany‚Äôs warmth and protective streak make her the sibling he trusts most.As Barron grows into adulthood, it‚Äôs Tiffany, not Ivanka, Eric, or Donald Jr, who seems poised to remain his closest confidant, giving the Trump dynasty‚Äôs youngest member an anchor within the sprawling, complicated family.","At 19, Barron Trump may be the youngest member of the Trump family, but insiders say his place among the siblings tells a story of contrasts.

Barack Obama‚Äôs 2011 state visit to London left behind more than polished speeches and diplomatic handshakes, it also produced one of those dry, razor-sharp Queen Elizabeth II moments that courtiers and politicians never forgot.In Power and the Palace, a new book by royal author Valentine Low serialized in The Times, the late monarch is quoted asking then‚ÄìChancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne to do the unthinkable: politely tell the President of the United States that it was time to call it a night.‚ÄúWill you tell President Obama it‚Äôs time to go to bed?‚Äù the Queen reportedly whispered to Osborne as the state banquet carried on past midnight.Osborne admits he froze. ‚ÄúI could see Obama surrounded by this big crowd.

Ultimately, the Queen‚Äôs private secretary Christopher Geidt stepped in, assuring the flustered minister, ‚ÄúWe are handling the situation, Chancellor.‚ÄùThe anecdote paints a vivid picture of Elizabeth II‚Äôs sharp humor and no-nonsense pragmatism, qualities that defined her reign as much as her tiaras.Low‚Äôs book also delves into weightier matters, claiming the Queen once expressed quiet skepticism about Brexit, telling a minister, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs better to stick with the devil you know.‚Äù But for many, it‚Äôs the image of the world‚Äôs most powerful woman, weary of late-night pleasantries, hinting that even the leader of the free world needed to mind the clock, that best captures her unmatched style.",Queen Elizabeth II reportedly asked then-Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne to tell Barack Obama to go to bed.

The simmering tension between Prince Harry and Queen Camilla, long splashed across tabloids, has been reignited, but this time by someone unexpectedly in the middle of royal history. Former royal butler Grant Harrold, who served the monarchy for decades, is challenging the Duke of Sussex‚Äôs stark portrayal of his stepmother in his memoir Spare.In the explosive book, Harry branded Camilla ‚Äúevil‚Äù and ‚Äúwicked,‚Äù accusing her of tearing apart the family he cherished with Princess Diana. Yet Harrold‚Äôs recollections paint a different picture, one of warmth, laughter, and shared family moments.In his upcoming biography, The Royal Butler: My Remarkable Life of Royal Service, Harrold recounts the day Charles and Camilla wed in April 2005. ‚ÄúCharles and Camilla were catching a flight to head straight to Birkhall. We all went outside to wave them off and laughed as we saw William and Harry had decorated their car with ‚ÄòJust Married,‚Äô‚Äù he writes. He added that the brothers ‚Äúraced after the car‚Äù as the couple drove off ‚Äúthrough the arches to cheers,‚Äù a scene far removed from the cold animosity Harry described.Harrold insists he witnessed ‚Äúno animosity‚Äù between Harry and Camilla. ‚ÄúThe four of them, I promise you, got on so well. I saw them having dinners together, I saw them having drinks together, I saw them going to parties together,‚Äù he recalled.He also praised King Charles for his calm demeanor, noting, ‚ÄúHe works hard and doesn‚Äôt suffer fools‚Ä¶ he doesn‚Äôt once raise his voice.‚ÄùA royal insider corroborated Harrold‚Äôs account, telling GB News that Harry seemed genuinely happy during the wedding celebrations and even took the lead in decorating his father‚Äôs Aston Martin. ‚ÄúI am sure there were mixed emotions over the years, but all I can tell you is how he seemed at the time,‚Äù the source said.Yet Harry‚Äôs memoir paints a more bitter picture. He claimed Camilla was ‚Äúdangerous,‚Äù accused her of leaking details of his past drug use, and even compared her to the ‚Äúwicked stepmothers in storybooks.‚Äù The stark contrast between Harry‚Äôs narrative and those who witnessed the events firsthand has sparked a debate over truth, perception, and memory within the royal family.As Harrold prepares to release his biography, royal watchers are left wondering: did Harry‚Äôs version of events obscure a more nuanced reality, or was it a reflection of long-held personal pain?","Former royal butler Grant Harrold is challenging Prince Harry's portrayal of his stepmother in his memoir Spare. In the explosive book, Harry branded Camilla ""evil"" and ""wicked,"" accusing her of tearing apart the family he cherished with Princess Diana.

From feud to a possible reunion: Is a royal homecoming for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle with children on the cards? Royal experts spill the beans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/from-feud-to-a-possible-reunion-is-a-royal-homecoming-for-harry-and-meghan-with-children-on-the-cards-royal-experts-spill-the-beans/articleshow/123503589.cms,"Harry Reaches Out? Prince Invites King Charles Amid Hopes Of Reunion

For years, the rift between the royal family and the Sussexes has been the stuff of palace whispers, glossy magazine covers, and endless ‚Äúsources close to‚Äù speculation. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have built a life on the other side of the Atlantic - swapping Buckingham Palace for Montecito mansions, royal duties for media deals, and the London fog for Californian sunshine. But is there a chance the family feud could finally ease? Some royal watchers say the door might just be creaking open.Royal expert Ian Pelham Turner told Fox News Digital that trust remains the sticking point. ‚ÄúI believe it to be totally correct that members of the royal family do not trust Meghan. And of course, she does not trust some members of the royal family in return,‚Äù he said.Still, Turner hinted that the narrative isn‚Äôt as black-and-white as it seems. ‚ÄúIf every member of the royal family doesn‚Äôt trust Meghan, then why did King Charles instigate a meeting with his senior advisor and that of Harry and Meghan‚Äôs team? Is it all the royal family, or is it perhaps William?‚ÄùOptimism, however, lingers. Turner hopes Harry, Meghan, and their children‚ÄîArchie and Lilibet‚Äîwill eventually be welcomed back ‚Äúwarmly‚Äù into the fold. Fellow commentator Ingrid Seward echoed the sentiment, telling Fox News Digital, ‚ÄúI feel that [this] won‚Äôt go on forever. I just feel that at some stage‚Ä¶ they will begin to come together.‚ÄùThat said, Seward was quick to admit that Meghan remains deeply unpopular with hardcore royalists.The speculation is being fueled further by Harry‚Äôs scheduled trip to the UK in September. According to PEOPLE!, he‚Äôs set to appear at a charity event for WellChild, which supports children with life-limiting conditions.Whether this visit sparks a reunion with King Charles remains to be seen, but it has reignited questions about the Sussexes‚Äô long-term ties to Britain.One factor pulling them back could be education.Former royal butler Grant Harrold told Style Caster that Harry may want Archie and Lilibet to experience the same schooling system he grew up with. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very likely and it‚Äôs completely possible‚Ä¶ But then it depends on how the relationship is with the rest of the family when the time comes.‚ÄùBut here‚Äôs the royal-sized hurdle: security. In ITV‚Äôs Tabloids on Trial, Harry admitted that safety concerns are the main reason Meghan avoids the UK. ‚ÄúThey are genuine concerns for me‚Ä¶ It's one of the reasons why I won‚Äôt bring my wife back to this country,‚Äù he said.A source close to him doubled down in Us Weekly: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll always be fond of his home country, but the way he views it, his wife and kids are his priority.‚Äù","Royal expert Ian Pelham Turner says trust remains the sticking point.

A pilot was rescued within 30 seconds after his flight ended in a shocking splashdown off Oak Island, North Carolina, when the single-engine plane‚Äôs motor suddenly cut out mid-air.Mark Finkelstein, who‚Äôs been flying for 17 years, was forced into a dramatic emergency water landing. The small aircraft somersaulted as it hit the waves, flipping upside down in front of stunned beachgoers who gasped, shouted ‚ÄúOh my God!‚Äù, and rushed to watch the rescue unfold, The Sun reported.Within seconds, heroic rescuers yanked Mark out of the submerged cabin‚Äîlegs first‚Äîbefore whisking him to safety on a Jet Ski. Despite his head being underwater during the extraction, he managed to breathe once clear of the aircraft.Two rescuers then assisted him onto a waiting Jet Ski, ensuring his safe return to shore. The plane remained afloat with its wings on the surface and the nose pointing downward.Oak Island Fire Department reported that the aircraft came to rest mostly submerged in an upright position. Finkelstein survived by clinging to a small pocket of air in the rear of the cabin and was guided to safety by the rescuers.He sustained only a cut on his leg, which required stitches at a hospital. Reflecting on the ordeal, Finkelstein said, ‚ÄúI was so fortunate that the impact didn‚Äôt injure me and doubly fortunate that the Oak Island Water Rescue got to me so quickly. That was huge. That was the key to the whole thing.‚ÄùHe added, ""I wasn‚Äôt focused on what I was going to do as a result of the crash, I was focused on the training and what I felt I needed to do. You know, get the door open before I landed, that sort of thing. I just focused on what I needed to do and wasn‚Äôt thinking further ahead than that."" The swift response of the Oak Island Water Rescue was crucial in ensuring Finkelstein's survival, demonstrating the effectiveness of emergency preparedness and training in crisis situations.","Mark Finkelstein, who's been flying for 17 years, was forced into a dramatic emergency water landing.

Prince William & Kate Middleton's ‚ÄòForever Home‚Äô Dream Leaves Neighbours Homeless





Princess Anne turned 75 on August 15. To mark the day, the Prince and Princess of Wales posted a short birthday wish and shared her newly released portrait of the Princess Royal. Their message read, ‚ÄúWishing Her Royal Highness The Princess Royal a very Happy 75th Birthday!‚ÄùThe image is part of a set released for the milestone. Shot at Gatcombe Park by John Swannell, the portrait keeps the tone formal and restrained‚Äîvery Anne. Swannell has photographed her across multiple milestone birthdays, a continuity that suits the Princess Royal‚Äôs preference for understatement.There was also an earlier portrait released the week before: a two-shot of Anne with Sir Tim Laurence , taken at Windsor Castle by Chris Jackson ahead of July‚Äôs French state banquet. That image drew attention to a sleeker, pulled-back hairstyle, a look Anne also wore at the banquet with her longtime Festoon Tiara.The post from William and Kate landed during the family‚Äôs summer break, but the message stayed classic: a clear portrait, a brief line, and no long caption. It matches Anne‚Äôs public style and allows the picture to do the talking.As ever, the focus around her birthday was service. Anne is widely cited as one of the monarchy‚Äôs hardest-working royals, and official birthday coverage emphasized her decades of engagements and patronages.Family figured in the week‚Äôs imagery, too. The Windsor channels highlighted Anne and Sir Tim‚Äôs quiet partnership, as well as archival moments from her life‚Äîreminders of a career defined by duty, sport and charity more than spectacle.Why does a single post matter? It shows how the Wales household and the Princess Royal present milestones now: warm but minimal, with the visuals carrying the sentiment. For Anne, the emphasis stays on the work rather than the social-media flourish.As the summer break continues, the family is expected to spend time together in Scotland, with no indication of a large public event for the occasion. For the Princess Royal, a steady calendar and a modest celebration remain the norm‚Äîand the Waleses‚Äô short message matched that mood.The takeaway: a milestone birthday, a clean portrait, and a brief wish from nephew and niece-in-law‚Äîsmall gestures that say plenty about how Princess Anne works, and how the royal family marks personal events today.","Princess Anne turned 75 on August 15.
