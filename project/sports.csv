Cody Rhodes has been a part of the WWE family since 2007. One could say that he’s been a part of it his whole life, given that Rhodes is a second-generation boxer. Throughout the years, the 39-year-old has won multiple Championships and still reigns as the undisputed WWE Champion.This year at MITB Rhodes will be teaming up with Randy Orton and Kevin Owens to take on the Bloodline , who are now being led by Solo Sikoa.The long-standing issues between these groups of stars have the potential to make this one of the best matches of the night. Before we get to witness Rhodes’ sixth MITB appearance, let’s take a look at how he’s fared throughout the years.Cody Rhodes made his first-ever MITB appearance back in 2010. He featured alongside the likes of Kane, Big Show, Randy Orton, The Miz, Jeff Hardy, Chris Jericho, and more. Rhodes was the first to set up a ladder and try to get his hands on the briefcase. However, Kane and Big Show, the big men in the ring, quickly put him out of commission. He took his revenge on Big Show by helping the other competitors take him out.Rhodes even managed a beautiful disaster on Kane. Rhodes even took out Big Show all by himself at one point by hitting him with a Ladder. More than once, Cody got his hands on the suitcase. However, he was chased up the ramp by Kane and slammed into an ambulance. That was the last we saw of Rhodes at Money in the Bank 2010.Cody Rhodes got a second shot at the contract just a year after his loss in 2011. He faced off against. Daniel Bryan, Heath Slater, Justin Gabriel, Kane, Sheamus, Sin Cara, and Wade Barrett. Rhodes was brilliant throughout the fight, landing plenty of acrobatic moves on his fellow stars. However, he took a beating so hard that he couldn’t even make one final push for the contract.In the end, Daniel Bryan and Wade Barrett were the only men left standing. Bryan hit Barrett with a kick to the face and lifted the coveted briefcase. This marked Cody Rhodes’ second loss at Money in the Bank.His appearance at MITB 2012 made it three years in a row where Cody Rhodes failed to get his hands on the coveted briefcase. Rhodes defeated Christian about 12 days before the PLE to earn himself a place in the MITB match. He faced off against Dolph Ziggler, Christian, Damien Sandow, Santino Marella, Sin Cara, Tensai, and Tyson Kidd.Unfortunately, this just wasn’t the night for Cody. He was resilient throughout and kept going after the belt even after taking a heavy beating. In the end, Dolph Ziggler caught a lucky break and was able to snatch the contract away from the other competitors.2013 marked Cody Rhodes’ fourth consecutive appearance at Money in the Bank. This year, he was one of the favorites to win as he went up against a cast of Dean Ambrose, Jack Swagger, Antonio Cesaro, Fandango, Wade Barrett, and Damien Sandow. However, something that nobody saw occurred during the closing moments of the match.Rhodes was moments away from taking the briefcase and riding off into the sunset. He could’ve finally ended his MITB losing streak. However, Damien Sandow got up at the worst possible time and pushed his former Tag Team partner, Cody Rhodes, off the ladder, which put him out of commission. After betraying Rhodes, Sandow took the briefcase for himself and thus began the bitter rivalry between the two stars.After four years of losing back-to-back MITB ladder matches, Cody Rhodes finally managed to get his first win at MITB 2014. Unfortunately, Rhodes wasn’t himself and made his appearance disguised as Stardust, the tag team partner to Goldust. Also, Cody wasn’t part of the Money in the Bank match and instead made a Tag Team appearance against Curtis Axle and Ryback.The brothers secured victory by pinfall and this marked Rhodes’ first win at MITB. A decade later, he will be returning to the PLE to face off against the Bloodline. Does Rhodes have another win in store for his fans, or will his MITB record continue to get worse?",Cody Rhodes has been a part of the WWE family since 2007. The 39-year-old has won multiple Championships and still reigns as the undisputed WWE Champion. This year at MITB Rhodes will be teaming up with Randy Orton and Kevin Owens to take on the Bloodline.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111543279,imgsize-126564,width-400,resizemode-4/111543279.jpg"

NEW DEHLI: India leg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi emphasised the importance of the team's resilience and ability to recover from their surprising loss to the relatively inexperienced Zimbabwean team. He urged his teammates to approach the second T20I with a renewed mindset and determination.Despite setting a modest target of 116, the Indian side struggled in their pursuit and were ultimately dismissed for a mere 102 runs in the opening match of the series on Saturday.With the second encounter scheduled to take place on Sunday at the same venue, Bishnoi stressed the need for a strong comeback performance from the Indian squad.“We are trying our best and we need to bounce back stronger. We just need to come back tomorrow (Sunday) with a fresh mind for the second match,” said Bishnoi in the post-match press meet.Bishnoi said India failed to stitch together good partnership.“It was a good game of cricket, but we collapsed, lost continuous wickets. A partnership would have made the game better for us. We could not do that. I think that made the difference,” he said.“Zimbabwe's bowling and fielding were really good. They did not allow us to build partnerships,” he added.Bishnoi, who claimed a career-best 4/13, said he is trying to improve his craft.“We can learn something from every match. I am trying to learn from every match and get better at what I am doing,” he said.Bishnoi believes that the moment has arrived for the next generation to step up and carry the team forward. His comments come in the wake of the retirement of several senior players, including Virat Kohli , Rohit Sharma , and Ravindra Jadeja, who have been integral to the team's success in recent years.“It's time for new players. The senior players are retired and handed over the mantle to us. It's our responsibility to take the flight ahead.”Despite the loss in the opening match of the series, Bishnoi said captain Shubman Gill led the side well.“Shubman's captaincy is very good. His bowling changes were spot on, it's a sign of good captaincy,” he added.",Ravi Bishnoi says India need to bounce back stronger in second T20I.

It was never my intention, and I can never think negatively about anyone's religion. I have made that clear. It should be done because I am younger, they are seniors and a great off-spinner in Indian and world cricket.""""Then we talked, and you might have seen Babar being mocked. No doubt, Babar is also a great batsman in Pakistan cricket; he has scored the most hundreds for Pakistan. No doubt,Brian Lara and Babar's class don't match, and they shouldn't be compared. But as cricketers, we shouldn't mock anyone. So I talked about it, and he (Harbhajan) also agreed that it shouldn't have happened from his side either,"" he added.The controversy stemmed from an inappropriate remark made by Kamran Akmal during Pakistan's T20 World Cup match against India, which India won by a narrow margin of six runs.Reacting to Akmal's comment, Harbhajan said, ""Kamran Akmal should understand that there is no need to say anything about anyone's religion and make fun of it. I would like to ask Kamran Akmal if he knows the history of Sikhs, who are Sikhs and all the work that Sikhs have done to save your community, your mothers, and sisters.""In the aftermath of the backlash, Kamran Akmal issued a public apology. ""I deeply regret my recent comments and sincerely apologize to @harbhajan_singh and the Sikh community. My words were inappropriate and disrespectful. I have the utmost respect for Sikhs all over the world and never intended to hurt anyone.

A borrowed bat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/india-vs-zimbabwe-abhishek-sharmas-secret-a-borrowed-bat/articleshow/111563982.cms,"Abhishek Sharma announced his arrival on the international stage with a sizzling century in the second T20I of his career against Zimbabwe at the Harare Sports Club on Sunday, and he did it with a borrowed bat.After scoring 100 off 47 balls, which powered India to a mammoth 234 for 2 and eventually helped the visitors win by 100 runs to level the five-match series at 1-1, the 23-year-old Abhishek revealed that he did with skipper Shubman Gill 's bat.""Today I played with Shubman Gill's bat...whenever I think there is a pressure game or this is a match where I should perform, I usually take his bat,"" said the batting sensation, who, like Gill, hails from Punjab and is also mentored by India great Yuvraj Singh.Coming out to open, Abhishek smashed 8 sixes and 7 fours in his innings that came at a strike rate of 212.77, before being dismissed by left-arm spinner Wellington Masakadza.Ruturaj Gaikwad contributed an equally blistering 77 not out off 47 balls, followed by Rinku Singh who smashed an unbeaten 48 off 22 balls.Pacers Avesh Khan and Mukesh Kumar then took three wickets each to complete India's big win.Abhishek and Gill have been playing together since their under-12 days.“It has been quite beautiful, starting as kids of 11-12 years...When I was selected for the country, the first call I received was from Shubman,” said Abhishek in the post-match press conference.Abhishek said it's not the first time he borrowed Gill's bat.“It happened from the under-12 days, as whenever I play a pressure game I ask him for a bat. It had happened in the IPL as well. Today was no exception as it went well as it usually happens,” said Abhishek, who played IPL 2024 for Sunrisers Hyderabad and knocked on BCCI selectors' doors with his big-hitting prowess.The left-handed opener credited his father and Yuvraj for his success and ability to play fearlessly.“Yuvi paaji has made a big contribution. I don't consider myself as sixer-king or something like that. Special thanks to my dad for allowing me to play lofted shots. Generally, coaches don't allow a young batter to hit lofted shots. But my dad always said if you wanted to play a lofted shot, then it should go out of the ground. So I wanted to follow that,” he added.India lost the first match of the series, where Abhishek made his debut and got out for a duck. However, he said he didn't feel any pressure.“I think the IPL plays a big role in this (handling pressure). We did not feel much pressure when we came here to represent the country as debutants. Unfortunately, we didn't start well in the first match. But my mindset and approach were pretty much similar – to show the right intent,” he explained.“Of course, my execution was better today (in the 2nd T20I ) than yesterday. I was just calculating the risk that I should take in the first over, or whether to play according to the merit of the ball. Whenever I get boundaries or sixes in the first few balls, then I believe that it's my day,” he concluded.",India beat Zimbabwe by 100 runs in second T20I at Harare Sports Club. Abhishek Sharma scored 100 off 47 balls and hit 8 sixes and 7 fours. India captain Shubman Gill's bat was used in the innings.

Zimbabwe

captain talks to TOI on why India will move on quickly from the retirements of Kohli, Rohit and Jadeja in the shortest format...

Excerpts from an exclusive chat...

How do you see the next generation taking Indian cricket forward?

Who are the players from the India squad that you'll keep an eye on in Zimbabwe?

What are your expectations from Zimbabwe?

As the head coach of RCB, you've seen Virat Kohli from close quarters. Did you have an inkling he was going to retire from T20Is?

According to a survey, the T20 World Cup is gaining in popularity, even among players, and is on course to becoming the most important ICC event...

We had an IPL where 250-plus scores were achieved with regularity, and then the T20 World Cup where bowlers held sway...

(Watch India tour of Zimbabwe (5-match T20I series, July 7 onwards 4 PM IST) live on Sony Sports Ten 5 channels)

NEW DELHI: After their T20 World Cup triumph, India are back in action with a T20I series against a feisty Zimbabwe side. Nearly all the main team players have been rested from the India squad for this trip, while three heavyweights in Virat Kohli , Rohit Sharma and Ravindra Jadeja have retired from the format.Andy Flower , former Zimbabwe captain and current RCB head coach, spoke to TOI about what to expect from the five-game series.This India-Zimbabwe series is going to be really interesting. It's a very strong side the Indian selectors have put out. All these guys have not only shown a lot of talent in the IPL but also have the attitude required to play international cricket. There are readymade replacements for the guys who've retired, even though they are genuinely great cricketers. The strong domestic structure in India means there will always be readymade replacements. It's certainly nothing to be scared of. India will keep producing these greats. There is always someone ready to come in. Whenever some of the great cricketers have retired, you think they won't be and cannot be replaced. But people move on very quickly. All eyes adjust and focus on the next talent that comes along.If I put my IPL coaching hat on, then I'll have to keep a keen watch on the players. (Yashasvi) Jaiswal didn't play a single match in the T20 World Cup but he is an incredible option. Shubman Gill , by his standards, had a quiet IPL but he looks a very intelligent player. He plays in a similar way to Virat Kohli. I'm looking forward to Abhishek Sharma performing. I really like the look of Dhruv Jurel. Watching him in the Test series against England, he did brilliantly. Riyan Parag has the swagger that you need in international cricket.Their biggest player is Sikandar Raza even though he is 38 years old. He has been quite a late bloomer. I want to see how Blessing Muzarabani, a very tall, right-arm fast medium bowler, performs. Muzarabani with his bounce can trouble the Indian batters.I hadn't thought about it (Kohli's retirement). I was a little surprised. I really enjoyed working with Virat in the IPL last season. I have utmost respect for him, obviously as a player but also the way he supported Faf du Plessis and myself and Mo Bopat, the director of cricket. He is a brilliant role model. He is an outstanding professional sportsperson. He looks after himself really well. He is disciplined without being robotic. He laughs and has fun, has a cheeky sense of humour and takes the mickey out of people. He always mixes in with team gatherings and he is very approachable. He has a very good cricket brain and can think out of the box too.I'm surprised. I think the 50-over World Cup, because it's played every four years, holds more importance. I think there's a danger in playing a T20 World Cup every two years... it becomes commonplace. I wouldn't like anything called the 'World Cup' to be a commonplace. I like the rarity of a World Cup. But I also do feel that T20 World Cups help in growing the game globally. Two of the best stories to come out of the recent World Cup would be Afghanistan and the USA.The next IPL may see big scores again. I'm not sure what'll be done about the 'Impact Player' rule. It wasn't a favourite in the dressing room. The tempo and the power game is going to continue in the IPL. In the World Cup, some of the small scores were mainly due to the pitches on offer. The ICC will need to be careful about the surfaces that are being provided for marquee tournaments like the World Cup. In cricket, there should always be a healthy balance between the bat and ball.","Andy Flower, former Zimbabwe captain and current RCB head coach, spoke to TOI about what to expect from the five-game series.

1st T20I: Bowlers shine as unfancied Zimbabwe stun India by 13 runs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-zimbabwe/1st-t20i-bowlers-shine-as-unfancied-zimbabwe-stun-india-by-13-runs/articleshow/111541579.cms,"NEW DELHI: A spirited Zimbabwe stunned a youthful India by 13 runs in the series opener in Harare on Saturday, registering their first win against cricketing powerhouse in eight years.Pulling of an upset of gigantic proportions, minnows Zimbabwe, who had failed to qualify for the recently concluded T20 World Cup, handed India them first T20I defeat of the year.Despite restricting Zimbabwe to just 115 for nine, India was bowled out for 102 in 19.5 overs, thanks to a determined effort by the Zimbabwean bowlers, led by Tendai Chatara (3/16) and skipper Sikandar Raza (3/25).India, having recently won the T20 World Cup with a different squad, were expected to easily handle the Zimbabwean but failed to do so, folding for their fifth joint-lowest T20I total.India's bowlers, led by leg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi (4/13), performed commendably on a pitch with some extra bounce and carry. Off-spinner Washington Sundar (2/11) also played a pivotal role as Zimbabwe struggled to build meaningful partnerships.Zimbabwe began their innings briskly, reaching 40 for two in the Powerplay. However, soon after that their batting frailties soon emerged.Following Kaia’s early dismissal, Wessly Madhevere (21 off 22 balls) and Brian Benett (22 off 15 balls) added 34 runs quickly before Benett was outfoxed by Bishnoi's googly. Bishnoi repeating the trick later claimed the wickets of Madhevere, Blessing Muzarabani, and Luke Jongwe, reducing Zimbabwe to 74 for three.Zimbabwe's middle and lower-order batters seemed to lose their way with their innings punctuated by runouts and soft dismissals. One such moment saw Jonathan Campbell, son of former Zimbabwe captain Alastair Campbell, involved in a mix-up that led to his dismissal. Campbell pushed an Avesh Khan delivery to the covers and set off for a single but changed his mind as his partner Dion Myers crossed the crease, eventually forcing Campbell to walk back.Despite the setbacks, Zimbabwe’s innings was buoyed by Clive Madande’s 29 not out off 25 balls, pushing their total past the 100-run mark. This resilient effort proved critical, as those extra runs became decisive.India's chase started poorly, faltering in the Powerplay itself. Abhishek Sharma , one of the three debutants alongside Riyan Parag and Dhruv Jurel , fell without scoring in the very first over. Sharma's cross-batted attempt off Brian Benett was caught in the outfield by Wellington Masakadza.Ruturaj Gaikwad (7) was next, succumbing to a slightly bouncier delivery from Blessing Muzarabani, which was edged to Innocent Kaia at first slip.Tendai Chatara then delivered a double blow, removing Parag (2) and Rinku Singh (0) within three balls in the fifth over. Parag’s attempt to loft over mid-off went to substitute Brandon Mavuta while Rinku Singh fell to a short-pitched delivery.Skipper Shubman Gill briefly steadied India with a sensible knock of 31 off 23 balls, including five boundaries.However, Raza soon disrupted his composure, bowling him out with a skidding delivery that breached Gill’s defense. With India at 84 for eight and soon 86 for nine, the chase seemed all but over.Avesh Khan (16 off 12) and Washington Sundar (27 off 34) added 23 runs for the eighth wicket, offering some hope, but Avesh's dismissal—caught by Raza at long-off off Wellington Masakadza’s full-toss—ended any prospects of recovery. India needed 16 runs in the final over, but could muster only two, as Zimbabwe celebrated a famous victory.Bishnoi’s career-best performance of 4/13 was a highlight for India’s bowling attack, which had otherwise managed to keep Zimbabwe largely under control.Bishnoi received significant support from Washington Sundar’s two wickets. Zimbabwe’s dissolution from a somewhat promising position of 74 for three to 115 for nine was primarily due to these two spinners, alongside the pace attack's contributions.The Indian team will need to regroup quickly with the second match of the series set for Sunday.The defeat calls for introspection, primarily concerning their batting approach under pressure. Despite the disappointment, the Indian bowlers showed promise and effectiveness, an area they would be keen to capitalize on in the upcoming clashes.","Zimbabwe stun India by 13 runs in T20 series opener in Harare.

When the runs stopped flowing after the Powerplay, Kapp, who was deadly while going straight down the ground, decided to take the aerial route again. But this time she mistimed it as the ball flew off the toe end of her bat and went straight into the hands of Sajana at mid-off.

Eventually, the umpires decided to abandon the match.Tazmin Brits scored a measured fifty to help South Africa reach a challenging total after India chose to bowl first.

By then, Ronaldo will be 41 years old, raising questions about his ability to continue playing at the highest level, where he holds the men's record for international goals (130) and appearances (212).But he has now gone eight consecutive games without scoring in major tournaments.
