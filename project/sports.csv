Kevin Durant shares his ambition for future



Kevin Durant ‚Äôs presence on the court is always a game-changer, but lately, it‚Äôs been off the court where his star power has been making waves. As the Phoenix Suns face a tough road ahead without him due to injury, Durant‚Äôs influence extends beyond basketball, even reaching the NFL. From missed predictions to social media jabs, KD‚Äôs passion for the game and his Commanders is as strong as ever, proving that his competitive fire burns brighter than ever‚Äîeven when he's sidelined.Also Read: With the Chiefs undefeated, their billionaire owner celebrates North Texas SC‚Äôs MLS Next Pro Championship victory Kevin Durant will miss at least six regular-season games and three NBA Cup games due to a left calf strain, casting a shadow on Phoenix just as things started looking brighter.

She shared a screenshot of the final score on Instagram, tagging KD and another account (@vtdvito), with the caption, ‚ÄúOhhhhhhh (crying emojis) BLACK & YELLOW!‚Äù It was a jab Durant won‚Äôt forget. (via: EssentiallySports)Before the weekend‚Äôs games, KD predicted his Commanders would win by three on the Up & Adams show. However, Russell Wilson led the Steelers to victory, leaving Durant‚Äôs prediction in the dust.Though Durant isn‚Äôt on the NFL field, his passion for football‚Äîespecially his hometown Commanders remains strong. As a partner of FanDuel, he stays actively involved, discussing games on social media. With aspirations of one day owning a team, KD‚Äôs competitive spirit shows no signs of slowing down.While LeBron James and Stephen Curry have openly expressed their ambition to own an NBA team, Kevin Durant is eyeing a different path‚Äîone that leads to NFL ownership. Durant has shared his dream of owning a team in the league, a goal he hopes to pursue as his career winds down.‚ÄúI‚Äôd definitely love to own a team,‚Äù Durant told Matthew Berry of ESPN in a 2015 interview. ‚ÄúHopefully one of these years towards the end of my career.‚Äù But which team is at the top of Durant‚Äôs list?

NEW DELHI: India's batting line-up faces a critical test as they aim to bounce back against an in-form South African side on the challenging SuperSport Park pitch in the third T20I on Wednesday. In the second T20I, India's top order struggled, managing just 124 for six as they faltered against South Africa‚Äôs pacers, and Centurion‚Äôs pace-friendly surface could bring similar challenges.At the top, Abhishek Sharma‚Äôs prolonged dry spell has become a concern. The team management might consider partnering Tilak Varma with Sanju Samson and introducing Ramandeep Singh in the middle order for added depth.Key batters Suryakumar Yadav, Hardik Pandya, and Rinku Singh have also had inconsistent performances. While Pandya scored 39 in the last game, he was slow to find boundaries, leaving room for improvement. Samson, in form, will need support, or the others must step up if he has an off day.On the bowling side, Arshdeep Singh will seek redemption after conceding 28 runs in his last two overs, possibly making way for alternatives like Yash Dayal. The spinners, Varun Chakravarthy and Ravi Bishnoi, have excelled, and the bounce here could further aid them.For South Africa, seasoned batsmen like Aiden Markram, David Miller, and Heinrich Klaasen have yet to make an impact, and their contributions could be crucial against India's spinners.The third T20I between India and South Africa will be played on Wednesday, November 13 at Supersport Park in Centurion.The third T20I between India and South Africa starts at 8:30 PM IST and the toss will take place at 8:00 PM IST.The third T20I match between India and South Africa will be telecast on Sports18 and Sports18 HD channels.Follow the Live coverage of third T20I match between India and South Africa on","The third T20I between India and South Africa will be played on Wednesday, November 13 at Supersport Park in Centurion.

Joining LeBron and Jokic in Assists Milestone

Responding to the Doubters

The Role of Green‚Äôs Playmaking in Warriors‚Äô Success

Draymond‚Äôs Defensive Value to the Warriors

A Renewed Focus on Discipline

Draymond Green ‚Äôs presence on the court has long been a backbone for the Golden State Warriors , even if his contributions don‚Äôt always light up the scoreboard. Often praised by coaches and teammates for his leadership and defensive expertise, Green recently marked a significant career milestone, showcasing his playmaking skills and taking his place alongside NBA stars LeBron James and Nikola Jokic .Also read - ""Will Joe Lacob‚Äôs Tribute to Klay Thompson Reopen Old Wounds at Chase Center?"" During the Warriors‚Äô recent 127-120 victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder, Green recorded 11 assists, contributing to the highest point total the Thunder have conceded this season. This marked Green‚Äôs entry into an exclusive group: he now holds the third-most games with 10 or more assists for a non-guard, joining only LeBron James and Nikola Jokic. Reflecting on his achievement, Green posted on Instagram, ‚ÄúSometimes I pinch myself‚Ä¶ You have done great things young man from Saginaw.‚ÄùWhile Green is typically humble about his stats, this moment led him to acknowledge the hard work behind his success.Despite his accomplishments, Green has faced criticism throughout his career. Known for his ‚Äúintangibles‚Äù rather than flashy scoring numbers, he addressed his critics in his Instagram post: ‚ÄúLet me guess‚Ä¶ I only got assists because someone had to make a shot,‚Äù adding a laughing emoji to underline his point. Green has often been underestimated for his unconventional impact on the game, but he takes pride in his ability to silence doubters with his on-court contributions.Green‚Äôs playmaking is integral to the Warriors‚Äô offense. His ability to organize plays and set up shots helps Golden State maintain one of the league‚Äôs most effective offenses. The Warriors are nearly unbeatable when Green records 10 or more assists, holding a record of 99-21 in such games, per StatMuse. Without Green, the team has struggled; last season, the Warriors posted a 13-14 record in the 27 games he missed.Steve Kerr considers Green indispensable, and Stephen Curry has praised him as a favorite teammate. While Curry and Klay Thompson handle scoring, Green‚Äôs organizational role keeps the offense running smoothly.Green‚Äôs defensive skills are another critical part of his game. Known for his versatility, he covers positions across the board and has been a key player in some of Golden State‚Äôs greatest victories. His impact goes beyond numbers; during the 2016 Finals, when Green‚Äôs suspension in Game 5 coincided with the Warriors‚Äô 3-1 series lead over the Cavaliers slipping away, his absence was widely seen as pivotal. This moment has since solidified Green‚Äôs value in the eyes of the Warriors and their fans.This season, Green has committed to avoiding the behavioral issues that hurt the Warriors last year, acknowledging that past incidents affected the team‚Äôs focus. His dedication to maintaining a steady presence speaks to his role as a veteran leader, as the Warriors push forward with a strong start to the season, holding an 8-2 record.Green‚Äôs contributions to the Warriors‚Äô success over the years have been invaluable, and this recent achievement is just another testament to his critical role in one of the league‚Äôs most celebrated franchises.Also read - ""Without Kevin Durant, Can the Suns Maintain Their Winning Streak?""","Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green recently recorded 11 assists against the Oklahoma City Thunder.

Mike Williams' sly dig on social media at former Jets teammate Aaron Rodgers

Mike Williams landed a sly dig on social media at former Jets teammate Aaron Rodgers, scoring the game-winning touchdown for the Steelers. Williams made a 32-yard touchdown catch in the Steelers' 28-27 win over the Commanders, which accounted for his only target and reception of the game.His time in New York included being thrown under the bus by Rodgers after slipping on a fourth-quarter interception in a loss to the Bills last month.

""Thankful #WholeLotta #WeBack #RedLine,"" Williams wrote.

Vinicius under pressure

Unfinished business

Argentina and Brazil will have two of their leading stars available again as South American qualifying for the 2026 World Cup resumes with the last two rounds of games this year. Defending World Cup champion Argentina will once again count on goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez , who was suspended for two international matches in October. Brazil will bring back winger Vinicius J√∫nior , who missed the last two qualifiers through injury but has recovered.South American leaders Argentina will play at Paraguay on Thursday, shortly after fourth-place Brazil visits Venezuela.Also on Thursday, host Ecuador and Bolivia will face off in Guayaquil.Potentially the most interesting match of the 11th round will be played on Friday in Montevideo, where third-place Uruguay hosts second-place Colombia. The bottom two in the 10-team standings, Peru and Chile, will meet the same day.All teams play again next Tuesday in the 12th round of games, when Argentina hosts Peru and Brazil has a home game against Uruguay.Argentina currently has 22 points, three more than Colombia, with Uruguay and Brazil third and fourth with 16 points each. Ecuador and Paraguay, with 13 points, complete the top six which are direct spots in the next World Cup.Bolivia has 12 points, and its seventh place would qualify the Andean team for an international playoff. Venezuela (11), Peru (6) and Chile (5) complete the standings.Argentina can move even closer to a spot at the World Cup by beating Paraguay and Peru.Captain Lionel Messi will be his team's best hope for goals once again after his hat trick and two assists in the 6-0 win against Bolivia in October, with the 37-year-old the top scorer in the current South American qualifying.Argentina will travel to Asuncion with an additional challenge since Paraguay has been unbeaten since coach Gustavo Alfaro, an Argentine, took over in the middle of the year. In September, the Paraguayans beat Brazil 1-0.Coach Lionel Scaloni faced a last-minute injury that could force even more changes in Argentina's defense. Lisandro Martinez suffered an apparent abdomen injury during Manchester United's 3-0 Premier League victory over Leicester and was discharged from international duty. Scaloni had already lost Germ√°n Pezzella.Pressure on Brazil coach Dorival J√∫nior was eased in October after two wins in qualifying over Chile and Peru. And Vinicius wasn't on duty in either of them.Fans will pay close attention to the winger's performances against tough defenses at Venezuela and later against Uruguay, as he tries to reproduce for Brazil the same decisive performances for Real Madrid.Brazil once again will not have Neymar, who picked up a muscular injury earlier this month. There's no big name as a center forward because Rodrygo is injured, too, and Endrick was not chosen. Vinicius will likely have to link up effectively with Raphinha and Luiz Henrique.Vinicius will face two teams that are in a degree of turmoil. Venezuela hasn't won any of its last six qualifiers, and Uruguay coach Marcelo Bielsa is still under fire from former players for his handling of the team.Two wins for Brazil won't secure the team a spot at the next World Cup just yet, but they will give fans and players some reassurance after a turbulent year.Colombia is hardly expecting a friendly reception in Montevideo on Friday. After all, there's unfinished business with Uruguay since their turbulent semifinal encounter at the Copa Am√©rica in the United States in July.Colombia's victory kicked off a brawl between Colombian fans and relatives of the Uruguay players. Led by striker Darwin N√∫√±ez, the Uruguayans went into the stands to defend their relatives. N√∫nez was later suspended for five matches.Uruguay's Bielsa will be without two key midfielders, Nicol√°s de la Cruz and Giorgian de Arrascaeta, both injured.

Joel Embiid ‚Äôs return from his 193 days of hiatus has been one of the most discussed NBA news of recent times. The return of the Philadelphia 76ers star also grabbed headlines as all eyes are on the 7-foot-tall star player hoping that he will lead the team to win future matches.

Amid the heated rivalry, Joel Embiid's return was supposed to be the spark of the match as all eyes were locked on the star. However, the star center struggled to find his rhythm in his return game.In the first half, Embiid attempted just three shots but to the surprise of all fans and critics, he missed all of them. His slow start caught the attention of Lakers legend, O‚ÄôNeal and he didn‚Äôt hold back during the halftime show. O‚ÄôNeal reflected on Embiid's return while breaking down his performance alongside the Inside crew.‚ÄúThis is the fear I have for Joel Embiid.

Vidarbha:

Gujarat:

NAGPUR: Vidarbha, with one foot already in the knockouts, will look to cement their quarterfinal spot by putting up a dominating performance against Gujarat from Wednesday.With four wins in as many matches, including one by an innings margin, Vidarbha are sitting atop the Ranji Trophy Elite Group 'B' with 25 points. Another win will almost ensure a knockout berth for them. The former champions, though, face their toughest opponent of the season so far.Gujarat, with 18 points, occupy the second spot in Group 'B'. After winning their first two matches, against Hyderabad and Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat were held to draws in the last two. They managed three points in both the stalemates by virtue of securing the first innings lead.As far as the playing surface is concerned, there won't be any home advantage for the hosts. The recently relaid pitch at Jamtha Stadium is as much an unknown entity for Vidarbha as for Gujarat.Vidarbha skipper Akshay Wadkar had acknowledged the fact after his team's innings win over Himachal in the last match. ""Since the wicket was re-laid, we haven't played at Jamtha. Yet to see if the surface is the same or has changed. Earlier it was a mix-soil (red and black) pitch. I don't know much about the present pitch,"" Wadkar said.Going by current form, though, Vidarbha have their nose ahead. All in the batting line-up - Atharva Taide, Dhruv Shorey, Karun Nair,Yash Rathod , skipper Akshay Wadkar and Danish Malewar - are among runs. Rathod, with three centuries in as many matches, is third in the list of leading run scorers of the season.Vidarbha bowlers have achieved the feat of dismissing the rival batting line-up twice in all their matches of the season. Young left-arm spinner Harsh Dubey , leading wicket-taker of Ranji Trophy so far in the season, would again lead the Vidarbha bowling unit. Veteran off spinner Akshay Wakhare, with 20 wickets, too is in good form.Vidarbha won't be looking to tinker with the winning combination much. Only if forced by the nature of the pitch, the Vidarbha team management may change the bowling unit a bit like bringing in a spinner in place of a pacer.Unlike Vidarbha, Gujarat played most of their matches on pitches less favourable to bowlers and it reflects in the team stats. Left-arm spinner Siddarth Desai, with 14 wickets, is the leading bowler of the visitors. Desai is followed by left-arm medium pacer Arzan Nagaswalla (13 wickets).Among the batters, Aarya Desai, brought into play after two matches, is in great form. The southpaw opener has scored 291 runs, including a double ton, in his last two matches.Others in the batting lineup like Umang Kumar, and Manan Hingrajia, too are among runs. Priyank Panchal, after an indifferent start to the season, posted a ton against Rajasthan in Gujarat's third match.Akshay Wadkar (Captain & WK), Atharva Taide (vice captain), Karun Nair, Dhruv Shorey, Yash Rathod, Danish Malewar, Akshay Wakhare, Harsh Dubey, Aditya Thakare, Praful Hinge, Nachiket Bhute, Akshay Karnewar, Aman Mokhade, Siddhesh Wath (WK), Yash Kadam, Shubham Kapse, Parth RekhadeChintan Gaja (Captain), Priyank Panchal, Umang Kumar (vice captain), Arzan Nagaswalla, Manan Hingrajiya, Aarya Desai, Jaymeet Patel, Urvil Patel (WK), Het Patel (WK), Rishi Patel, Tejas Patel, Rinkesh Waghela, Sidharth Desai, Priyajit Jadeja, Kshitij Patel, Vishal Jaiswal",Vidarbha are top of the Ranji Trophy Elite Group 'B' with 25 points.

The off-colour Ding, meanwhile, hasn't won a game in the classical format this year.""Gukesh is a player who doesn't make any mistakes at all. Sometimes, the accuracy level is so great that he doesn't make a mistake unless he has got fatigue or something. We will not see a 12th game,"" Thipsay said during a symposium organised by the Sports Journalists Association of Mumbai here at the MIG Cricket Club on Tuesday.Averring with Thipsay, Kunte said, ""I think Gukesh will win by round 12.""Thipsay even went on to say that the teenaged Gukesh was ""more mature"" than the 32-year-old Chinese player, who, he recalled, even ""started crying during a World Championship final after the fourth round"".""One is a young boy at 18 against somebody who is matured at the age of 32. We would presume him to be mature. But if you look at the personality, the character, the strength of the person, I would say that Ding is like a child and Gukesh is like a grown up person. Because after the fourth game we saw Ding start crying in the World Championship match. He probably played the worst game. But he came out with a reaction that it was the worst game in his lifetime,"" he explained.Thipsay felt that Gukesh's solid mindset, in comparison, is like Russian GM Anatoly Karpov.""There is Gukesh, there is so much strength of the character - 'Okay, if I do it badly now, I will do it better tomorrow'. Very much like (Anatoly) Karpov had. Even if you look at the styles of the players, Gukesh's style resembles very much Karpov's. They want to leave everything to open imagination. They don't want to win the game by theoretical novelties.

Ranji Trophy: Ayush Badoni is new captain in Delhi shakeup ahead of Jharkhand tie,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/ranji-trophy-ayush-badoni-is-new-captain-in-delhi-shakeup-ahead-of-jharkhand-tie/articleshow/115238081.cms,"NEW DELHI: Forever in course correction mode, the Delhi and District Cricket Association 's (DDCA) latest move is to appoint Ayush Badoni as captain for their Ranji Trophy match against Jharkhand starting here on Wednesday. Himmat Singh , who captained till now, has been relieved of his duties. This is the third season in a row that Delhi have changed a captain in the middle of the first-class season. This is, incidentally, the last match of the first leg of the Ranji Trophy this season. The Delhi team management ran out of patience with Himmat, who apart from being in poor form also led a team which has looked increasingly fragile in the first four matches.Badoni takes charge at a time when the selectors are ringing in major changes. The new captain will be hoping the team can turn a corner against a Jharkhand team which is languishing in bottom half of points table. The selectors even contemplated dropping Himmat from the team altogether, but persisted with him since they needed experience in the middle order.In a significant development, the selectors seemed to have finally moved on from the perennial underperformer Kshitiz Sharma . Kshitiz's selection, despite his struggles over the y ears, was always controversial and it is learnt it disturbed many in the dressing room. Incidentally, he was picked a head of stable middle-order bat Jonty Sidhu , who had scored a hundred two matches ago.Off-spinning allrounder Hrithik Shokeen too has been dropped from the team. Interestingly, despite his proven utility up the order, Shokeen batted at No. 10 in the last match. The selectors felt that Badoni has been bowling better off-spin than Shokeen at the moment.Badoni realizes it's a critical time for Delhi in the competition. ""I don't want to complicate the boys. We know we can come up with special performances. We can't spend time brooding over what has gone wrong. We need to pick ourselves up and turn up with intent on Wednesday,"" Badoni said on Tuesday.","Ayush Badoni will captain Delhi in their Ranji Trophy match against Jharkhand.

Gautam Gambhir horoscope | IND Coach Will Win At Least 1 ICC Trophy | StarPlay: Cricket & Astrology

India's head coach Gautam Gambhir 's pre-departure press conference set an aggressive tone for the Border Gavaskar Trophy , when he told former Australia captain Ricky Ponting to mind his own business and not question the form of Virat Kohli . In an expected retort, Ponting has said that he is not ""surprised"" about that reaction from a ""prickly character"".Gambhir threw his weight behind Kohli and skipper Rohit Sharma when quizzed about their poor run against Bangladesh and New Zealand in the home Test series before flying to Australia and also questioned Ponting for his comments.‚ÄúWhat does Ponting have to do with Indian cricket?‚Äù Gambhir had said. ""He should think about Australian cricket. I don't have any concerns. They (Kohli and Rohit) are incredibly tough men; they've achieved a lot for Indian cricket and are going to achieve a lot in future as well.""In the three-Test series against New Zealand, which India lost 0-3, Rohit scored 91 runs and Kohli 93 in their respective six innings.Responding to Gambhir's comments, the 49-year-old Ponting told 7News: ‚ÄúI was surprised to read the reaction but knowing the coach, Gautam Gambhir ... he‚Äôs quite a prickly character, so I‚Äôm not surprised it was him who said something back.""Toning down his previous comment, the Australian added that his intentions were not to hit out at the former India captain.""In no way was it a dig at him (Kohli). I actually followed it up by saying he‚Äôs played well in Australia and he‚Äôll be keen to bounce back over here...If you ask Virat, I'm sure he would be a little bit concerned that he hasn't been able to make the same amount of hundreds as he has in previous years,"" he said.""So it's amazing how little things can get cut up, but he's a class player and he's played well in Australia in the past.‚ÄùTalking about Kohli's form in 2024, he has scored just 488 runs in 25 innings across formats in 19 international matches this year at an average of 20.33.Meanwhile, India had their first practice session at the WACA stadium in Perth on Tuesday and will open the series at the Optus Stadium in the same city on November 22.The five-Test series is crucial to India's chances of qualifying for the World Test Championship (WTC) after sliding to number two in the WTC points table.","Gautam Gambhir told Ricky Ponting to mind his own business and not question the form of Virat Kohli.

Premier India pacer to turn out for Bengal in Ranji game, reigniting talk of a possible late entry into India's Test squad in Australia

IND have what it takes to challenge this AUS team in upcoming #BGT | #beyondtheboundary

KOLKATA: India fast bowler Mohammed Shami is all set to play for Bengal in their next Ranji Trophy Elite Group 'C' game, putting to rest all speculation over his comeback plans after being left out of India's squad for the five-Test series for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia.Bengal will take on Madhya Pradesh in Indore from Wednesday.TOI has learnt that the 34-year-old pacer's movements will be closely monitored by physio Nitin Patel, who has travelled with the Uttar Pradesh-born cricketer and will be stationed in Indore over the next four days.Shami's fitness status was closely monitored ahead of India's BGT squad announcement but captain Rohit Sharma 's assertion that ""we don't want to take an undercooked Shami to Australia"" was indication the team management was not fully convinced about the fast bowler's Test-match recovery.Shami, however, was positive he could take the flight to Australia after playing a few Ranji matches. He can, however, play only one red-ball game to prove his fitness because the Ranji Trophy season will be played in two halves.In Shami's absence, India picked a largely inexperienced pace attack - including Akash Deep, Harshit Rana, Nitish Kumar Reddy and Prasidh Krishna - to back up Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj. Mukesh Kumar, Navdeep Saini , and Khaleel Ahmed are in the reserves.The Bengal team management has said the Indian cricket board ( BCCI ) has not issued any guidelines or restrictions on Shami. ""We are happy to have him back,"" Bengal coach Laxmi Ratan Shukla told TOI from Indore. ""Shami was bowling at full throttle at the nets for some time and it will be good to see how he fares in a competitive match now.""Shami met his Bengal teammates in Bengaluru after the team's Ranji Trophy match against Karnataka last week. ""He was keen to make a comeback at that time, saying that he was feeling fine,"" Shukla stated.Shami has been sidelined for a year with an ankle injury. His name did not feature in the initial Bengal squad list but he made a late entry after getting the necessary clearance on Monday night from the National Cricket Academy (NCA), which had become almost his second home for the last six months as he rehabilitated from a surgery in February for an Achilles tendon injury which he carried into last year's ODI World Cup.In spite of not being at peak fitness, he ended up as the top wicket-taker in the World Cup with 24 scalps in seven matches.Shami had made steady progress and last month announced that he was ""100 per cent pain-free"" after bowling with full run-up at the Chinnaswamy Stadium following the conclusion of the first Test between India and New Zealand. He has always maintained that ""it's better that I play one or two domestic matches before going to Australia"".It was anticipated that Shami would be able to return in time for the red ball in Test cricket has been quite phenomenal,"" Ponting said.""You talk to all the players that face him as well, they talk about how hard and difficult he is. And then, when you think about where the first two Tests are (in Perth and Adelaide), he'd be perfectly suited to bowling in those conditions. So, I think that's the only real chink in India's armour,"" Ponting said.It remains to be seen if Shami will get on the flight to Australia if he performs well for Bengal.",Mohammed Shami set to play for Bengal in their next Ranji Trophy Elite Group 'C' game.

NEW DELHI: Former Australia pacer Brett Lee believes India underestimated New Zealand, leading to their 0-3 defeat in the home Test series. India's batters, struggling against New Zealand spinners Mitchell Santner and Ajaz Patel , were unable to find answers, resulting in repeated low scores in the series. Lee pointed out that India may have entered the series with overconfidence due to their strong home record.On his YouTube channel, Lee said, ""They went into the series thinking that we'll just whitewash the Kiwis, thinking that's going to be an easy series. And that's no disrespect to the Kiwis. It's just that India are so powerful, so strong on home soil. The Kiwis caught India off-guard.""The former fast bowler highlighted a concerning pattern in India's batting approach, which lacked patience. He suggested that India's aggressive mindset may have backfired as they forced their game against the disciplined Kiwi bowlers.With the Border-Gavaskar Trophy on the horizon, starting on November 22 in Perth, Lee remains confident that India can bounce back and prepare themselves for the crucial series against Australia.""This is a great learning curve for all out there. Probably not for Aussies because now they've got to understand that India will be much-better prepared. They are going to come in strong. They would have got a kick up the backside from their coach, Gautam Gambhir . This is atrocious, the way they played but they are still a team of champions. They have had a downfall over the last couple of weeks; it does happen in cricket,"" Lee added.Lee also weighed in on the poor form of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli , both of whom have struggled with the bat this year. He advised the duo to take time off, refresh, and focus on refining their techniques ahead of the Australian series.""When you have a couple of bad runs back-to-back, that's when the pressure could set in. I guess the thing now is someone like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma just have to go back to the drawing board. Work on that technique, freshen up, get away from cricket as much as they can and then hit the ground running when they go to Australia, because I can promise you - these Australian fast bowlers will attack Rohit Sharma with that brand new ball,"" Lee warned.With a spot in the World Test Championship final up for grabs, Lee believes India will come back stronger and well-prepared for the upcoming series against Australia.","Brett Lee believes India underestimated New Zealand, leading to their 0-3 defeat in the home Test series.

Adams made this statement on Tuesday while discussing the upcoming Border-Gavaskar Test series between India and Australia.Both Lyon and Ashwin are considered among the best spinners in contemporary cricket, with over 500 Test wickets each.

He contrasted this with Ashwin, whose carrom ball brings a different dimension to his bowling.Adams also commented on the absence of Indian fast bowler Mohammed Shami from the upcoming series against Australia.

NEW DELHI: The big-ticket Border-Gavaskar Trophy has become one of cricket's most iconic Test rivalries, pitting India against Australia in a clash of contrasting styles.Named after two cricketing greats, Allan Border and Sunil Gavaskar, the series has seen incredible displays of skill, resilience, and determination.Over the years, the Border-Gavaskar Trophy has evolved into a platform where batsmen have risen to extraordinary challenges, fighting in the swing and seam-friendly pitches of Australia to spin-laden tracks in India.From iconic knocks in the heat of Chennai to match-winning innings in the cauldrons of Melbourne, the batsmanship at display in the series has been nothing short of marvelous.As the countdown to BGT 2024-25 tickles down, here's a look at the all-time the top 10 run-getters:Legendary Sachin Tendulkar sits right at the top pile 3262 runs in the India vs Australia BGT series. In the 34 matches that Sachin featured between 1996 and 2013 in the series, he had 9 tons and 16 half-centuries to name. The batting maestro had a stupendous average of 56.24 and had a highest score of 241 not out, which was also his highest Test total in an innings. Sachin was also dismissed for a duck four times in the series.Australian great Ricky Ponting is second behind Sachin on the list of most run-getters in the India vs Australia BGT series. In the 29 Tests that Ponting was part of in the rivalry, he scored 2555 runs at a stunning average of 54.36. Ponting notched up 8 centuries and 12 fifties while he too like Sachin was dismissed 4 times for a duck in the series. The former Australian captain had a highest score of 257 in the series.Batting maestro VVS Laxman had a special relation with Australia. Whenever the Aussies were against him, Laxman was at his absolute best. In the 29 Tests Laxman played against Australia between 1998-2012, he scored 2434 runs at an average of 49.67. Laxman's epic -- one of the greatest knocks in Test cricket's history -- knock of 281 in Kolkata came against the Aussies. Laxman had 6 centuries and 12 fifties to his name against Australia.'The Wall' Rahul Dravid was another Indian batter, who scored heavily against Australia. In the 32 matches between 1996-2012, Dravid amassed 2143 runs that came at an average of close to 40. He had a couple of hundreds and 13 fifties to his name and a highest score of 233 against the Aussies.Former captain Michael Clarke sits fifth on the list with 2049 runs in 22 Tests played between 2004-2014. With the highest score of 329 not out, Clarke is the lone triple centurion in India vs Australia Tests. The top-order batter had 6 tons and 7 fifties to his name against India and boasted an average of 53.92.Cheteshwar Pujara was the hero of India's 2018-19 Border-Gavaskar Trophy triumph Down Under where he smashed 521 runs in the single series. Overall, in 24 Tests that Pujara played against the Australians between 2010 and 2023, he scored 2033 runs at a stunning average of 50.82. He had 5 centuries and 11 fifties to his name and had the highest score of 204.Australia has been superstar Virat Kohli's favourite country where he has had tremendous success over the years. Since 2011, Kohli has been part of 24 Tests against Australia and has 1979 runs to his name at an average of 48.26. Kohli has scored 8 tins and 5 fifties against Australia in the longest format and has a top score of 186. Kohli currently sits at the 7th spot on the list of most run-getters in BGT and will look to climb further up the ladder in the upcoming tour.Former Australian opener Matthew Hayden looked at his absolute best when playing against India. In the 18 Tests Hayden featured between 2001 and 2008, he scored 1888 runs at a jaw-dropping average of 59. Hayden scored 6 tons and 8 fifties against India and was dismissed for a duck twice.Just like Virat Kohli, eyes will also be on Steve Smith in the upcoming Border-Gavaskar Trophy as he will also be looking to climb up the ladder of most run getters in the iconic rivalry. In the 18 Tests Smith has played so far between 2013-2023, the right-hander has 1887 runs to his name at a stunning average of 65.06. Smith has so far hit 8 tons and 5 fifties in Tests against India.Explosive former India opener Virender Sehwag sits 10th on the list with 1738 runs in 22 matches. Sehwag boasted an average of 41.38 and had 3 tons and 9 fifties to his name against the Aussies. Sehwag had the highest score of 195 and was also dismissed for a duck thrice against Australia.",The Border-Gavaskar Trophy has become one of cricket's most iconic Test rivalries. Sachin Tendulkar sits right at the top of the list with 3262 runs in the India vs Australia BGT series. Australian great Ricky Ponting is second behind Sachin on the list of most run-getters.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115206781,imgsize-50504,width-400,resizemode-4/115206781.jpg"

Virat & Rohit‚Äôs Home Struggles: Left-Arm Spin & Lost Intent? | Beyond the Boundary Highlights

NEW DELHI: The year was 1996. Even though Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium in New Delhi, now called the Arun Jaitley Stadium, still referred to as 'Kotla' by the locals, had hosted 23 Tests, it wasn't a venue cricket enthusiasts had on their wishlists. Kotla was in urgent need of care despite being one of the venues of the ODI World Cup the same year. The players seeking a foray into international cricket or a farewell, didn't necessarily mind the setting.That would have been the case for Australia's Brad Hogg and India's David Johnson in October, who made their debuts. Meanwhile, Peter McIntyre played his last for Australia.India and Australia had played 12 series before this, starting in 1947/48, with the Aussies winning six and India just once - under the leadership of Sunil Gavaskar in 1979.This series, helmed by Mark Taylor and Sachin Tendulkar, had a different look and feel. Instead of the multi-match format, it was going to be a one-off Test. The fewest matches in a series played between these two were three, while the most were five.More importantly, the series had been branded as Border-Gavaskar Trophy named after legends from both countries - Allan Border and Sunil Gavaskar. In so doing, it had joined the likes of Anthony De Mello Trophy (between India and England), Frank Worrell Trophy (between Australia and West Indies), Wisden Trophy (between England and West Indies), Trans-Tasman Trophy (between Australia and New Zealand) and of course the iconic Ashes (between Australia and England) to get a name attached to itself.Fitting for the occasion, a gluttony of players were making their debut at First-Class level or featuring in a Test in India for the first time. Besides Johnson and Hogg, others that adorned this list included Ian Healy, Taylor, Mark Waugh, Paul Reiffel, Sourav Ganguly, Michael Slater, Glenn McGrath, Venkatesh Prasad, Michael Bevan, McIntyre, Ricky Ponting, Rahul Dravid, Vikram Rathour and Sunil Joshi.The one that stood out, though, was Nayan Mongia , playing his 14th Test for India. The wicketkeeper-batter had top-scored with 80 runs against West Indies by then. But he was more renowned for being a safe pair of hands behind the stumps. Having succeeded Kiran More, Mongia was believed to have entered a line of fine Indian wicketkeepers after Farokh Engineer and Syed Kirmani. He was steady with the gloves to both spin and pace.As a batter, he was known for being a tough character when the challenge presented itself. Against Australia, he was presented with such a daunting aspect. Having otherwise been a middle-order batter, he was lately elevated to the opening slot.""I was told well in advance that I'm going to open the innings. I knew how to play the new ball from junior cricket and Ranji Trophy so I had some idea. I was well prepared but not well prepared to get 100 or 150! But otherwise my job was to make sure the new ball gets old,"" recalled Mongia in an exclusive conversation with""To get 100 as an opener, you know, in a Test match it's always a pleasure. And getting a Man of the Match as a wicketkeeper that time (was rare). In a Test match, even if you took five-six catches, you don't get Man of the Match unless you score 100 or match-winning 50 or match-winning innings. So 100 was a big thing... 150 in fact. It was a big hundred,"" added Mongia.Mongia slogged it out for three days straight in the process. He started by keeping wickets as Australia batted first and scored 182 with Slater top-scoring as Anil Kumble took four wickets in the first innings, and collected nine wickets in total.Then 26 years old, Mongia would bat on for over eight hours for his 366-ball 152. ""Yeah, my fitness was always good. I used to do a lot of running, and do a lot of training. So that kept me going, from childhood - from under-15, under-19 age group I was doing a lot of training. (A) Keeper has to have good fitness - 90% (of the job) was doing keeping and then batting.""At Under-19 and Ranji Trophy, I used to open or bat at No. 3, so for that I need to have good fitness. If you have good fitness then only you will be able to do more concentration. Running was the main thing. I used to run for half-an-hour or 40 minutes every day,"" said Mongia who would retire after 44 Tests, rather prematurely many feel.Australia, still a key Test side back then, and a bigger player in money-churning quarters of cricket than India, chose to travel to the Asian sub-continent for just one contest as the series found a new name.Now, the tables have shifted. India are the bigger beast at the ICC and in producing money in the sport. So, for the first time since the 1991-92 season, India and Australia will indulge in a five-match Test series starting November 22. The BGT will go around Perth, Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney.Did Mongia envision the series getting this big and becoming such a rivalry? ""Not really because the main rivalry was India-Pakistan that time still. Australia (rivalry) was just growing up. Slowly West Indies cricket team went low. Pakistan had some internal problems,"" said the former stumper.""Border-Gavaskar Trophy gave a platform to have such a huge rivalry. Both the teams are very highly competitive and (have) top-class players in both sides. It's great fun to play this kind of series. You try to give your best shot and you make (your) country proud. You make your name in cricket when you play against these two countries,"" he added.With India going for three away Border-Gavaskar Trophy wins in a row, they do so on the back of a dreadful show with the bat against New Zealand which resulted in a 0-3 humbling at home.""It is going to be 50-50 for me right now, looking at India's performance and Indian batsmen are struggling. Playing against Australia in Australia is not going to be easy. But we have top-class bowlers as well. We will miss Mohammed Shami, there is no doubt about it. But we have other good bowlers who can step up leading from the front. Mohammed Siraj is there. Other young bowlers are there. But if you want to win a Test match, you have to put runs on the board and the batsmen have to come good,"" he concluded.","Nayan Mongia scored his first, and only, century of Test career against Australia in 1996. India and Australia had played 12 series before this, starting in 1947/48. The series had been branded as Border-Gavaskar Trophy named after legends from both countries.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115203200,imgsize-71504,width-400,resizemode-4/115203200.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Team India's decision to cancel their practice match in Australia did not sit well with cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar , who called the move ""beyond belief.""The team's initial plan included a practice match against India A at the WACA ground ahead of their opening Test match , which begins on November 22 at Perth Stadium.""For Indian cricket's sake (I hope) whoever has taken the call to do away with the warm-up game and then reduce the match between the first and second Test against the Australian Prime Minister's XI to two days will be proven right,"" Gavaskar wrote in his column for Mid-Day.Gavaskar stated that the batters needed the practice game in Australia, especially given their struggles at home against New Zealand.""To be fair, the Indians did score over 400 in the second innings (of the first Test) in Bangalore, but after that, in four innings they looked utterly clueless against a spin attack that by no stretch of imagination was so dangerous that India couldn't chase 150 in the fourth innings. Yes, there was turn on offer, but again the pitches were not impossible to play on,"" he said.""That is why the cancellation of the team's warm-up game in Perth against the India 'A' team beggars belief. There is no better feeling for a batter to spend time out in the centre and feel the ball hit the middle of the bat. No amount of net practice is ever going to replace that feeling of flow and bat speed that one gets even after a short stay at the crease.""Gavaskar emphasized the importance of playing in real practice matches over just facing bowlers in net sessions. He acknowledges that some may argue that 'A' team bowlers might hold back against top players in practice games to avoid injuries, but he points out that in the nets, batters often face less prepared pitches and bowlers who sometimes bowl no-balls without penalty.""Yes, there's a possibility that the 'A' team new ball bowlers may not go flat out because of the worry of injuring a key batter, but that's more likely to happen in the nets where the pitches are usually not as well prepared as in a match and where the bowlers bowl no-balls without any repercussion. The batters know that in the nets they can be dismissed three or more times and yet continue to bat and then play with no tension or pressure at all. So temperamentally, it's never going to be the same as playing in a proper match,"" he said.""For the bowlers too, getting into a proper rhythm with run-up and get confident about not overstepping is crucial. What line and length to bowl is also something that one can learn in a proper game and not in the nets.""","Team India's decision to cancel their practice match in Australia did not sit well with cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar.

'I am not facing any heat': Coach Gautam Gambhir

'Transition or not, seniors are hungry to succeed'

MUMBAI: Despite their recent slump in form, India's head coach Gautam Gambhir is standing firmly behind veterans, skipper Rohit Sharma and star batter Virat Kohli , whose places in the team have come under scrutiny.As India prepared to leave for Australia for the much anticipated Border-Gavaskar Trophy-a five-Test series for the first time since 1991-92- Gambhir, in characteristic style, fired back at Australian legend Ricky Ponting for questioning Kohli's form and place in the Indian team, suggesting Ponting should focus on cricket in his country.Ponting had voiced concerns about Kohli's prolonged slump, noting that the great batter has scored only two Test centuries in the last five years. Nonetheless, Ponting also backed the former India captain to roar back to form against Australia in Australia, given that he loves playing against the Aussies, and has a great record in Australia.""What does Ponting have to do with Indian cricket?"" Gambhir questioned during a media interaction on Monday. ""I think he should think about Australian cricket. More importantly, I have got no concerns whatsoever for Virat and Rohit.""Kohli has averaged merely 22.72 in six matches in 2024, the lowest in his career. The 36-year-old has scored just one fifty this year - 70 against New Zealand in the second innings of the first Test at Bengaluru, while his last Test century came in July 2023 against the West Indies. Kohli scored 93, and Rohit 91 runs in the India's humiliating 0-3 Test series loss to New Zealand at home.When asked if the senior batters' poor form is a concern, Gambhir was quick to reply, ""Not at all."" ""They are incredibly tough men. They have achieved a lot for Indian cricket, and they will continue to achieve a lot in future as well. For me, the most important thing is that they still work really hard, and they are still passionate, they still want to achieve a lot more and that is something which is very important,"" he stressed.As a head coach, Gambhir is bound to have a sense of deja vu as he boards the flight to Australia. He was a part of a team full of veteran players, which crumbled and went through a complete transition after the high of the 2011 World Cup with a new coach Duncan Fletcher in charge.Asked if he was feeling the pressure like Fletcher, Gambhir replied: ""I am not thinking about transition but the five Tests. Transition or no transition, if that has to happen, will happen but I see some incredibly tough characters in that dressing room who are hungry to do well. The only thing in my mind is, we are going to Australia to play five Test matches.""Batting continuously for senior pros Rohit and Kohli , the former India opener said it was the media which was obsessed with the word ""transition"".""You guys can keep talking about the transition and all that stuff. For me, they are still very hungry. I am sure they have got a lot of fire to achieve a lot of success for the nation and you should never doubt their passion for the country,"" Gambhir said.Reflecting on his own career values, Gambhir said, ""I've told them to put the team above personal milestones."" When asked if he felt pressure following India's recent home defeat to New Zealand, Gambhir replied, ""What difference does it make? Tell me, social media, what difference does it make in my life and for that matter, anyone's life?Gambhir made it clear that when he accepted the job, he was aware that coaching India would not be an easy task.""When I took up this job, I always thought that it was going to be a highly difficult job and highly prestigious job as well. I don't think as if I am feeling the heat because my job is to be absolutely honest and there are some incredibly tough people in that dressing room who have achieved some great things for the country and will continue to achieve some great things for the country. It is an absolute honour to be coaching them and coaching India,"" he said.Gambhir admitted that he was open to the criticism following the New Zealand series loss, saying he's ""ready to accept it with both hands.""However, he expressed confidence in India's ability to tackle Australia's fast and bouncy tracks. ""We don't control what wickets they give. It is their wish, whatever they want to dish us with. We are absolutely ready to play in any kind of conditions and we have got all the bases (covered) out. What difference does it make whether they give us a turning track or bouncy tracks or green wickets?""",Head coach Gautam Gambhir says he is not facing any heat from media. Says he has 'no concerns whatsoever' for Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma. Says it was the media which was obsessed with the word 'transition',"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115198426,imgsize-85072,width-400,resizemode-4/115198426.jpg"

He has been batting beautifully not only in the limited format but also in the Test, we all saw what classy innings he played against Bangladesh, so having a young hard-hitting batter and a terrific fielder in your side will always benefit the franchise. He is the future of Delhi Capitals,"" Adams told IANS.The 22-year-old has impressed in previous seasons with his aggressive batting and efficient fielding, marking three half-centuries in his IPL career.For the 2025 season, alongside Stubbs, Delhi Capitals have also retained Axar Patel Kuldeep Yadav , and uncapped player Abishek Porel, aiming to solidify their core team. They will be looking to fill the remaining slots in the squad during the upcoming mega IPL auction on November 24 and 25.""With Axar, Kuldeep and Porel other in the retention list, DC actually has tried to retain their core strength, but with Rishabh going out it will be interesting to see who will lead the team,"" he added.Stubbs, who made his IPL debut in 2022, has scored 405 runs in 18 matches at an average of 36.82, including three fifties. Acquired for Rs 50 lakh in the 2024 IPL Auction, his performance showcases his potential as a long-term asset for the team.Adams also heaped praise on the emergence of young talent like Gerald Coetzee and praised the SA20 tournament for its positive impact on South African cricket , attributing part of its success to the involvement of IPL franchises.""Gerald Coetzee‚Äôs been around here, played from the under-19s system all the way through, always able to contribute as well with the bat. And his innings the other night was absolutely amazing. Coming in, taking that pressure immediately off Tristan Stubbs. So having a player like that down the order and also South Africa to be able to have the batting depth these days within the T20 setup is important,"" Adams added.""It allows batters to continue to keep going hard. And also you've got to understand that the game's never finished. Gone are the days of that. You've got to make sure that you've got length in your batting and be able to have batters down the order that can clear the ropes.

A new era begins at Manchester United as Ruben Amorim becomes the latest coach to take on the challenge of reviving the storied English club.After more than a decade of on-field decline the 20-time English champion has turned to a 39-year-old Portuguese who has delivered trophies and a thrilling style of soccer to Sporting Lisbon , but takes over a club that has made a habit of wrecking even the biggest reputations.High-caliber managers have come and gone, more than $1 billion has been spent on player signings, yet United just can't seem to get it right.""If anybody knew the answer (for that), we wouldn't have had the last 10, 11 years,"" Andy George, a 40-year-old United fan from Worcestershire, told The Associated Press. ""I always back the manager ... but it needs to work now.""George said he had been a supporter for 30 years and traveled around 100 miles (160 kilometers) for last week's 2-0 win against PAOK in the Europa League.Proven winner Amorim - a former Portugal international - was Lisbon coach from 2020 and ended its 19-year wait for the Portuguese title in 2021. He won it again in 2024 and his achievements led to links with jobs at Liverpool , Manchester City and Barcelona before he was hired to replaceErik ten Hag at the start of the month.""I'm not naive, I know that it's going to be very different, very tough,"" Amorim said Sunday after his final game with Sporting. ""But I feel that I'm ready. I'm at peace now, I can focus on my new job.""He is United's sixth permanent coach since club great Alex Ferguson retired in 2013 after winning his 13th Premier League title. Ferguson won 28 major trophies, including two Champions Leagues, and his record has cast a shadow over all of his successors.David Moyes was the first to try to step into his shoes, lasted eight months and began what has been a cycle of hiring, firing and reboots in an attempt to return the club to its past glories.Since then United has gone through Champions League winners (Louis van Gaal and Jose Mourinho), an iconic former player (Ole Gunnar Solskjaer) and one of Europe's emerging coaching talents (Ten Hag), but has not been able to stop City from dominating English soccer, while Liverpool, Chelsea and even Leicester have lifted the title in that time.High expectations United hopes Amorim will be the man to finally break the cycle.""We cannot ignore how he has changed Sporting,"" United midfielder Casemiro said Sunday. ""We know that Sporting won many titles, changed the club with titles, with trophies. He has already proved that he is a coach that has won a lot.""Amorim made a spectacular statement even before officially taking up his new role when, while serving out his notice at Lisbon, his team routed City 4-1 in the Champions League last week.""I was like, 'Oh, my gosh!' I lost my mind,"" said Joshua Hanley, a United fan from Kansas City who had flown to England to watch the PAOK game. ""We were changing airplanes and I'm sitting there kind of watching the score on my phone.""It was a fantastic start.""Amorim joked that he would be considered the new Ferguson if he beat City.Hanley's expectations are more modest to begin with.""If we can make top six, it would be a fantastic end of the season,"" he said, adding that he wants Amorim to ""make football exciting again"".New structure Amorim is the first head coach hired since British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe became a minority owner of United in February, assumed control of soccer operations and installed a new leadership team as part of his overhaul.Chief exectuive Omar Berrada was lured from City and sporting director Dan Ashworth came from Newcastle. Dave Brailsford, who helped Britain become a global force in cycling, is a director on United's soccer board.While Ten Hag was given a contract extension following an end of season review in the summer, he was appointed under a former regime. United's woeful start to the campaign - losing four of its opening nine league games - ultimately cost him.Amorim has the benefit of being chosen by United's new hierarchy and the final piece of leadership team assembled by Ratcliffe, which should afford him time implement his plans.Ambition Not that he is likely to get a free pass this season. The timing of the decision to fire Ten Hag could be considered instructive in terms of United's ambition.There have only been 11 rounds of the league campaign and Amorim takes over a team that, although 13th in the standings, is only four points off third place. It also remains in three cup competitions.Champions League qualification remains very much in play and after United spent around $230 million on transfers in the offseason, Amorim will be expected to quickly deliver winning soccer to a club that has been playing catchup for too long.In the long term, the challenge is to return United to the summit of English and European soccer - a task that has proved beyond any of his last five predecessors.",Ruben Amorim becomes Manchester United's sixth permanent coach since Alex Ferguson retired in 2013.

The match witnessed an early goal from Hugo Boumous in the fourth minute, while Manvir Singh found the equaliser for the visitors in the 36th, keeping the spectators engaged throughout the 90 minutes.Mohun Bagan had the lion's share of possession (61%) and 11 corners to Odisha's nil, but they failed to convert those into goals as the Kalinga Warriors dug deep to soak in the pressure and charge on the counterattack. Couple of good attempts by former Bagan striker Roy Krishna and midfielder Lalthathanga Khawlhring, aka Puitea, for the hosts went abegging as the scoreline stayed level till the final whistle.The hosts, Odisha FC, drew first blood when their midfield maestro, Hugo Boumous, found the back of the net with a well-placed right-footed shot from close range. The goal came after a set-piece situation inside the box, with Ahmed Jahouh providing the assist with a fine touch. The ball took a deflection off a MBSG defender before nestling into the back of the net, leaving goalkeeper Vishal Kaith with no chance of making a save.Odisha FC's resolute defence, led by the towering presence of Mourtada Fall, stood tall against the fancied MBSG attack, which had scored 12 goals before this encounter. The young Odisha backline thwarted the visitors' attempts to find an equaliser, frustrating their potent attacking force.However, MBSG's persistent threat paid off when Manvir Singh restored parity for the Mariners. The winger's well-timed header from the centre of the box found the bottom-right corner, leaving Odisha goalkeeper Amrinder Singh helpless despite getting his hands to the ball. The assist came from the pivotal midfielder Dimitri Petratos, who delivered a precise cross following a corner kick. Saviour Gama, who had conceded the corner, was stationed on the goal line but could not prevent the header from crossing the line.The first half ended with the scores level at 1-1, setting the stage for an exciting second period. Both teams displayed resilience and determination, with Odisha backline standing firm against MBSG's relentless attacks, while the visitors' defence remained vigilant to thwart any potential threats from the hosts.In the end, the tie ended in a keenly-fought draw.While Odisha FC will be pleased with their defensive resilience after conceding 13 goals before this game, MBSG will rue their missed chances to secure all three points. With one point from their seventh game MBSG consolidated their second place on the league table with 14 points while Odisha remained on ninth spot with nine points after eight games.","Mohun Bagan Super Giant (MBSG) and Odisha FC (OFC) played out an enthralling 1-1 draw in Bhubaneswar on Sunday.
