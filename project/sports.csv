Mumbai Indians bought New Zealand all-rounder Amelia Kerr, last season’s joint-highest wicket-taker, for Rs 3 crore.Australian batter Meg Lanning and New Zealand’s Sophie Devine were also among the major picks in the marquee group of eight players. Gujarat Giants bought Devine for Rs 2 crore, while UP Warriorz acquired Lanning — who took Delhi Capitals to three straight finals — for Rs 1.90 crore after a bidding war with DC.Also read - WPL 2026 full squads: Complete players list for all teams after auction

Former US Rep and economist Dr Dave Brat trained the guns at India over the H-1B visa program and said that while the national cap for H-1B is 85,000, one Indian district got 220,000 H-1B visas which is 2.5 times the limit. ""When you hear H-1B, think of your family, because these fraudulent visas just stole their future,"" Dr Brat said, appearing on Steve Bannon's podcast, adding that China contributes only 12% to the H-1B program.In 2024, India's Chennai consulate reportedly processed roughly 220,000 H-1B visas and 140,000 H-4 dependent visas. The H-1B visa program allows US companies to hire foreign skill.US diplomat Mahvash Siddiqui , an Indian-origin US Foreign Service Officer, called out the industrialized fraud in the H-1B visa program as she recounted her experience at the Chennai consulate in India 20 years ago. Siddiqui revealed a shocking figure and claimed that 80-90% of the H-1B visas from India are fake -- either they have fake degrees or some other forged documents or they are not highly skilled as to be deserving an H-1B visa.""When I say H-1B visa, you need to think of your cousins, your aunts and uncles, and your grandparents. One of these folks comes over and claims they're skilled; they're not. That's the fraud. They just took away your family's job, and your mortgage, and your house, and all that,"" he said.Siddiqui said she was posted to the Chennai consulate from 2005 to 2007 when she adjudicated at least 51,000 H-1B visas. The Chennai consulate processed applications from four regions: Hyderabad, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, she said, adding that Hyderabad was the most concerning as Hyderabad's Ameerpet had shops not only consulting candidates on visa but providing them with forged documents -- be it an educational certificate or a marriage certificate. Siddiqui said she and the team she was working with quickly learned the fraud pattern and flagged it to the administration but there was a lot of political pressure. And their anti-fraud drive was called a 'rogue operation'. Siddiqui claimed many politicians were involved in running the operation and there was pressure on them not to pursue their investigation.",US diplomat Mahvash Siddiqui called out the industrialized fraud in the H-1B visa program.

Delhi Air Pollution Protest At India Gate Turns Violent Amid ‘Madvi Hidma Amar Rahe’ Slogans

An Indian man living in Sweden has gone viral after saying he is returning to Delhi because, despite Europe’s clean air and smooth systems, life in India is emotionally easier.Ankur Tyagi wrote on X on Monday that people often assume Europe means clean air, good roads and smooth systems, but the reality of building a life there is very different.His post came as a response to another user who said they understood why many people want to leave India, citing low talent density, high real estate prices, pollution, corruption and high taxes.""You do everything alone. You cook, clean, manage bills, raise your kid and fight the silence that hits you every single winter,"" Ankur said.He said friends are polite but distant and community is rare, unlike India where there is chaos but also constant human contact.He says, ""Community is rare. Back home, you fight corruption and chaos but at least you have people around you. In West problems are different and they cut deeper in ways you can’t explain unless you’ve lived it.""Ankur said he is returning to Delhi on 5 December despite the city’s pollution levels. “Every place has a cost. Most of us are just learning which costs we can survive. I’m coming to Delhi on 5 December,” he said, adding he needed “some real oxygen now of friends and family.See you soon, India,” he signed off.Also read: ‘Felt like a burden’: NRI couple says shift from US to India brought ‘peace of mind’ — viral video The man has been living in Sweden since 2021.

A third user shared that people who move young can integrate more easily, but those who arrive later often struggle with language and identity.Someone else warned him to be prepared for Delhi’s pollution, sharing how a colleague fell sick for a week after flying in from Kerala’s clean air.

'Biggest fault is your ...

Gautam Gambhir fiery press conference: On whitewash, Rishabh Pant shot, pitch and more

NEW DELHI: Former India spinner Harbhajan Singh did not hold back after India slipped to their second home Test series defeat against South Africa. He said that if Indian cricket wants to protect its “future generations”, the team management must rethink its approach to home pitches and move away from heavily spin-assisted surfaces that previously helped them dominate for over a decade — a run that ended when New Zealand handed India a whitewash last year.Speaking on his YouTube channel, Harbhajan criticised the current standards of Test preparation, saying Indian players have forgotten how to compete over five days because of surfaces that consistently produce two- or three-day matches. He added that the nature of these pitches contributed to declining batting numbers for stars like Virat Kohli Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane, eventually leading to their exit from the Test setup.""We do not know how to play matches for five days. We have got so used to playing so many matches on wickets where matches last for two-three days... Nowadays, it has reduced averages of our batters like Virat Kohli, Pujara, Rahane to 35-40 from 50... Our old greats were greats because they knew how to play five days of Test match cricket.""He urged Indian cricket to move on from its past and prioritise better pitches over favourable results.""For the betterment of Indian cricket, I think they should forget what has happened in the last 10 to 12 years... start playing on better wickets to save the future generation of Indian cricket.""Harbhajan added that Test cricket demands patience and discipline — qualities he feels have faded due to recent conditions.""The kind of temperament needed to play Test cricket requires effort, hard work, discipline, and I feel that for many years this has been missing.""He further argued that good wickets produce fair contests and reveal the true winner over the full duration of a match.""But what happens on a good wicket? A good wicket makes the game last five days... This lottery type situation, earlier New Zealand got lucky, now South Africa got lucky...""Harbhajan also analysed India’s performance in Guwahati, where the pitch appeared fair and the match reached the final day — yet India collapsed twice.""South Africa won the toss on this pitch and made 489... And then in the second innings, Team India collapsed for 140... So this is not just the fault of the pitch. I feel the biggest fault is your temperament.""South Africa dominated the Test through strong batting contributions led by Senuran Muthusamy’s maiden century and Marco Jansen’s explosive 93. Jansen, who also took 6/48 in the first innings, dismantled India’s batting order before Simon Harmer completed the rout with a match-winning 6/37 in the second innings. Ravindra Jadeja’s fifty and Sai Sudarshan’s gritty 139-ball vigil were among the few bright moments in a forgettable chase of 549.South Africa sealed a commanding 408-run win, with Harmer finishing as Player of the Series for his 17 wickets across two Tests, while Jansen claimed the Player of the Match award for his all-round brilliance.",Former India spinner Harbhajan Singh criticises current standards of Test preparation. He says Indian players have forgotten how to compete over five days because of surfaces that consistently produce two- or three-day matches. He added that the nature of these pitches contributed to declining batting numbers for stars like Virat Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125620587,imgsize-38310,width-400,resizemode-4/pant-gambhir-2711-bcci.jpg"
Why is Ilia Topuria stopping all UFC fights until 2026 and leaving the lightweight division wide open?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/international-sports/why-is-ilia-topuria-stopping-all-ufc-fights-until-2026-and-leaving-the-lightweight-division-wide-open/articleshow/125626794.cms,"Why is Ilia Topuria stopping all UFC fights until 2026 and leaving the lightweight division wide open? (Image via Getty)

Ilia Topuria steps back as Justin Gaethje and Paddy Pimblett wait for next move

UFC lightweight champion Ilia Topuria said he will not fight in the first quarter of 2026. He shared this in a short statement on social media. He said he is going through a “hard moment” in his personal life and wants to spend time with his children. Ilia Topuria said he needs to fix things at home first before he can fight again. He also said he does not want to “hold up the division,” so the UFC can book other fighters while he takes a break.This news is big for fans because Ilia Topuria is one of UFC’s biggest stars right now. He is the lightweight champion after beating Charles Oliveira with a first-round knockout at UFC 317 in June 2025. He also won two belts in two different weight classes. Many fighters were hoping to face him soon, but now they will have to wait until at least April 2026.Ilia Topuria had a huge last two years. He beat Max Holloway and Alexander Volkanovski in 2024 in featherweight title fights. Then he moved up to lightweight and planned to fight Islam Makhachev. But Islam Makhachev moved up to welterweight, so Ilia Topuria fought Charles Oliveira instead and won the lightweight belt.Now Ilia Topuria is the No. 2 fighter in the Pound-for-Pound list. Only Islam Makhachev is above him. Even with all this success, Ilia Topuria says he needs time for his family. He said that when everything is okay, he will tell the UFC he is ready to come back.This break changes things in the lightweight division. Justin Gaethje and Paddy Pimblett, who both want a title shot, will now need to wait. UFC may book new fights or even an interim title while Ilia Topuria is away. Fans are also curious because Max Holloway posted a message showing support for Ilia Topuria.For now, Ilia Topuria is taking time for his kids and his personal life. He wants to return only when everything feels right.Also Read: Who Was Fuzzy Zoeller?

How Dylan Cease’s Contract Shifted the Pitching Market

Impact of the Cease Deal on Remaining Starters

Why a Padres Reunion Looks Less Likely

Why Michael King Makes Sense for the New York Mets

Key Reasons the Mets Could Target King

The New York Mets may be preparing to make their next major pitching move, with multiple predictions linking them to San Diego Padres right-hander Michael King. Following Dylan Cease’s massive seven-year, $210 million contract with the Toronto Blue Jays, the pitching market has shifted quickly - and King now sits near the top of the remaining options.While a reunion with San Diego isn’t impossible, current indications hint that King could be heading elsewhere. One notable projection from Will Laws of Sports Illustrated places the Mets as the expected landing spot, making this a storyline worth watching as free agency continues.The New York Mets have publicly signaled their intent to spend aggressively on starting pitching this offseason. With Cease off the board, they are evaluating the next tier of talent - and King, despite concerns about his recent injury, offers significant upside.King excelled in his first full year as a starter with the Padres and, when fully healthy, has pitched at a level comparable to top right-handers across the league. Even if signing him requires an overpay, the Mets appear willing to explore that avenue.Before suffering a midseason shoulder injury in 2025, King was producing at a borderline elite level.Will Laws described the challenge teams now face evaluating his health, writing: “King has shown he can be great, but he’s a high-upside player with a good amount of risk.” (H/t: Sporting News)That assessment captures the balance clubs must weigh: King’s ceiling is undeniable, but his timeline for returning to peak form remains the main question.Dylan Cease signing with the Blue Jays at $210 million over seven years reset expectations. Cease’s deal established a new benchmark at the top of the free-agent class, and teams looking for high-end arms now have diminishing choices.• Raised expectations for multi-year commitments• Increased urgency for teams still seeking frontline pitching• Elevated the market for players like King due to scarcity• Made a Padres reunion less certain given King’s value relative to riskFor King, Cease’s signing both clarified his tier and underscored why teams like the Mets must act quickly before other rotation targets fall off the board.Although King found success with the Padres and a return can never be entirely ruled out, current reporting suggests it isn’t the likeliest outcome. His injury came at a difficult moment - right as his free-agent value was peaking - and San Diego may prioritize other rotation avenues after allocating resources elsewhere.For the Mets, the question is simple: do they want to gamble on upside?• They have publicly stated they intend to spend on starting pitching• They need another top-end arm after recent departures• King’s peak performance fits the profile of a high-strikeout, durable starter (when healthy)• The market scarcity may push them toward players with risk but significant rewardIf King returns to his pre-injury form, the Mets would be landing a pitcher capable of performing at the top of their rotation without paying the absolute premium required for Cease.As the market continues to develop, Michael King stands out as one of the most intriguing high-upside pitchers left. With Dylan Cease’s deal shifting attention to the next group of starters, the Mets are well-positioned to make a strong push. Whether they ultimately secure him will come down to their comfort with his medical evaluations - and their willingness to outbid a Padres reunion attempt.Also read: MLB trade rumors: Los Angeles Dodgers considering major defensive shuffle if they land $186 Million ex-Toronto Blue Rays superstar Jon Conahan’s reporting underscores the precarious but promising nature of King’s free agency, making this one of the most compelling pitching decisions left this offseason.","The New York Mets may be preparing to make their next major pitching move, with multiple predictions linking them to San Diego Padres right-hander Michael King.

Pros, Cons, and Overall Winner

Talk around the league has escalated as theare increasingly positioned as a potential landing spot for Milwaukee Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo . With the franchise eyeing a future built around Luka Dončić , the possibility of pairing him with another generational MVP has created a wave of speculation across NBA circles.This momentum is driven by recent indications that the Lakers are exploring aggressive paths to remain contenders beyond the LeBron James era. Reports suggest they are more willing than ever to make short-term sacrifices if it means strengthening their core around Dončić, who continues to perform at an MVP level.Among the most detailed proposals is a five-team structure that envisions the Lakers acquiring Giannis along with Olivier-Maxence Prosper from Dallas and Tyrese Martin from Brooklyn. In this scenario, LeBron James heads to Dallas, Brooklyn gains Dalton Knecht, and Los Angeles sends Milwaukee a haul of wings - RJ Barrett, PJ Washington, Caleb Martin, and Naji Marshall - along with extensive draft control. The Bucks’ return would include swap rights in 2026, 2028, 2030, and 2032, plus a 2031 first-round pick. Meanwhile, the Raptors and Nets secure young pieces and trade exceptions to reshape their flexibility.Alternate proposals maintain the same intention but reduce the complexity. One such idea involves the Lakers sending LeBron, Austin Reaves, and two first-rounders directly to Milwaukee in exchange for Giannis and Kyle Kuzma. These frameworks prioritize Milwaukee’s need for draft capital and young talent rather than retaining an aging LeBron.For the Lakers, landing a 30-year-old superstar in his prime alongside a 26-year-old Dončić offers a pathway to multiple championship runs. Their recent head-to-head battles - highlighted by Dončić’s 41-point performance in a dominant win - underscore the potential of their combined offensive strength.Milwaukee, on the other hand, would gain assets to address the team’s drop-off when Giannis is off the floor. Their pursuit of additional scorers such as Zach LaVine and Anfernee Simons shows a desire to rebalance the roster, and a major trade could accelerate a full-scale retool.Dallas would reload instantly with LeBron’s leadership beside rising talent. Brooklyn and Toronto would walk away with young guards like Knecht and Hardy, plus valuable exceptions.The Lakers benefit from a potential dynasty-forming duo capable of combining for over 65 points per game while boosting the league’s global appeal. The Bucks secure valuable rebuilding tools but risk alienating fans by moving their franchise icon. The complexity of multi-team negotiations and Knicks-related timing issues remain hurdles.Also read: NBA trade rumors: Golden State Warriors could chase $54.2 million Dallas Mavericks superstar in blockbuster 3-team trade to fix center depth If such a scenario were to play out, the Lakers emerge with the clearest long-term upside, while Milwaukee transitions into a new era fueled by assets and flexibility.","The Los Angeles Lakers are increasingly positioned as a potential landing spot for Milwaukee Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo.

At 36, his clutch plays and football IQ demonstrate a level of play that suggests years of elite contribution remain. His strategic approach to career decisions, coupled with his on-field indispensability, makes him a vital asset, regardless of this season's outcome.

Taylor Swift Reveals Favorite Track, Talks Travis Kelce And New Album “The Life Of A Showgirl”

Travis Kelce’s performance sends a message about longevity and leadership

For months, the talk around Travis Kelce has been less about catches and more about calendars, specifically whether this season would mark the final chapter of his storied NFL career. But on Thanksgiving night, under the bright lights of AT&T Stadium, the 36-year-old tight end delivered the kind of performance that didn’t just help the Kansas City Chiefs turn a game around, it shifted the conversation entirely.As fans scanned the stadium for his fiancée Taylor Swift, Kelce was busy doing what he has always done best: making clutch plays, boosting Patrick Mahomes , and reminding everyone that elite football IQ and relentless competitiveness age differently than the rest of the body. His game wasn’t just productive, it was defiant.Kelce’s first-half touchdown was the spark Kansas City desperately needed after trailing Dallas early. His two-yard score wasn’t flashy, but it was one of those emblematic “Kelce plays”, perfect timing, sharp awareness, and total trust from Mahomes. His second big moment, a 22-yard reception in Q2, further showcased that while defenses might be younger and faster, they still haven’t decoded how to neutralize Kelce’s intuition.Fans and analysts recognized it too. Chiefs insider Pete Sweeney posted: “I think we all came into this season thinking that this would for sure be Travis Kelce's last season, but he's been playing like he has year(s) left.” Another fan wrote: “Travis Kelce playing this great at 36 years old isn’t being talked about enough.His longevity isn’t appreciated enough.”Those words matter, but Kelce himself has been clear that career decisions won’t be emotional. They’ll be strategic. Reflecting on retirement talk earlier this year, he explained: “You know, seeing my brother go through it … I want to give the Chiefs a good opportunity to know whether I come back or not.”Kelce’s $34.25 million contract and locker-room legacy give him leverage, but Thursday’s game gave him something else: proof that he’s still indispensable. Whether or not this is his final season, one truth is undeniable, the Chiefs aren’t just better with Kelce on the field; they’re sharper, calmer, and more dangerous. If this was meant to be a farewell tour, Kelce is performing like someone who isn’t ready to leave the stage just yet.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s Eras docuseries faces fan backlash as Travis Kelce’s presence takes center stage","Travis Kelce's stellar Thanksgiving performance has silenced retirement speculation.

This distance is reportedly linked to Lively's legal battle with co-star Justin Baldoni, which inadvertently involved Swift.

Blake Lively’s ICY SILENCE Sparks Feud Talk After Taylor Swift’s Engagement Reveal Goes Unanswered

Blake Lively’s latest move suggests the Taylor Swift friendship isn’t healing anytime soon

For years, Blake Lively and Taylor Swift were one of Hollywood’s most beloved celebrity friendships; playful, outspoken supporters of each other, and famously intertwined in each other’s public lives. That’s why fans reacted with genuine excitement on October 3, 2025, when Blake finally liked Taylor’s Instagram post about her album ""The Life of a Show Girl"".It broke a long stretch of silence and made people hope the icy distance between them had finally begun to thaw. But just when fans thought the two were back on a path toward normalcy, Blake once again became notably absent from Taylor’s social media orbit, especially after Swift posted the trailer for her docuseries The End of an Era. Suddenly, the reconciliation narrative started feeling premature.The distance between them is intertwined with Blake Lively’s legal battle against Justin Baldoni, her It Ends With Us co-star. In her lawsuit, Lively accused Baldoni of sexual harassment and “waging a smear campaign against her.” When Baldoni countersued, things escalated and Taylor Swift got pulled into the firestorm.Justin Baldoni’s legal team claimed Lively had allegedly used her friendship with Swift as leverage during production, and even moved to subpoena the singer before ultimately withdrawing the request.Being dragged into a legal drama of that nature, unexpectedly and against her will, inevitably strained trust.Reports from PEOPLE added context in June, noting that “Swift and Lively aren’t as close and haven’t been spending as much time together as they did in the past.” Another insider emphasized the emotional distance: “Taylor is working to trust Blake again but it’s going to take some time.”From the outside, the silence looks like avoidance. From the inside, it may be caution, especially with Swift recently engaged to Travis Kelce and aware that every association of hers instantly becomes a headline.Today, Blake’s quiet non-engagement with Taylor’s latest post doesn’t just speak to social media patterns; it hints at unresolved tension and emotional processing behind the scenes. The reality is less dramatic than “feud”, and more human: two friends navigating trust, hurt, and public scrutiny in real time, with the world watching closely and guessing loudly.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s Disney+ docuseries faces unexpected legal threat from Florida courtroom as Travis Kelce remains silent","Hollywood's once-tight Blake Lively-Taylor Swift friendship appears strained.

Fuzzy Zoeller’s cause of death

Fuzzy Zoeller’s legacy at a glance



Fuzzy Zoeller, one of golf’s most familiar and charismatic figures, has died at 74, leaving the sport reflecting on a career defined by talent, humor, and moments that shaped his legacy. The two-time major champion, who won both the Masters and U.S. Open, remained a recognizable presence long after his final competitive rounds. News of his death surfaced Thursday, with tributes pouring in from across the golf world, though the cause has not yet been disclosed.Zoeller’s passing has sparked an outpouring of emotion from fellow players, fans, and prominent figures who remembered him for both his achievements and the joy he brought to the game. His death marks the end of an era for a golfer whose personality once drew galleries as much as his skill.Details surrounding Fuzzy Zoeller’s cause of death have not been released, but the news was confirmed after his daughter informed Brian Naugle, tournament director of the Insperity Invitational.His death also prompted immediate tributes from influential names. “Very sad to hear that the highly respected and beloved Professional Golfer, Fuzzy Zoeller, has passed away,” President Donald Trump wrote, adding, “A truly remarkable person and player, he will be missed!”The PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan said, “Fuzzy was a true original whose talent and charisma left an indelible mark on the game of golf.”Monahan highlighted Zoeller’s mix of competitive fire and humor, a combination that helped define his appeal.Zoeller built a distinguished résumé with 10 PGA Tour wins, including the 1979 Masters, where he became the last golfer to win the event on his first attempt, and the 1984 U.S. Open at Winged Foot. His playoff victory over Greg Norman remains one of the championship’s signature moments. Beyond the majors, he collected wins around the world and represented the United States in three Ryder Cups.Yet his career also carried a lasting controversy. During the 1997 Masters, Zoeller made racially insensitive remarks about Tiger Woods’ future Champions Dinner menu. Though he apologized repeatedly, the comments sparked a backlash that followed him for years. “I’ve cried many times. I’ve apologized countless times for words said in jest that just aren’t a reflection of who I am,” he later reflected. “Still, I’ve come to terms with the fact that this incident will never, ever go away. ”Fuzzy Zoeller’s legacy stretches far beyond scorecards. Born Frank Urban Zoeller Jr. in New Albany, Indiana, he rose from a standout high school athlete to a national champion at the University of Houston before turning pro in 1973. His Masters and U.S. Open triumphs cemented his place among the sport’s elite, while his easygoing personality made him a fan favorite.Zoeller also found success later in life on the PGA Tour Champions, winning the Senior PGA Championship in 2002. He finished his career with 19 global victories and left behind moments that remain etched in golf history.Zoeller is survived by his three children. His wife, Diane, died in 2021.Also Read: Who was Fuzzy Zoeller?

Bukayo Saka chooses luxury London hotel for heartfelt proposal



Bukayo Saka balances personal milestone with standout season for Arsenal



Bukayo Saka has stepped into a new chapter off the pitch, marking a major personal milestone after proposing to his longtime girlfriend, Tolami Benson, during a private evening at one of London’s premier hotels. The couple, both 24, have been together since 2020 and have kept their relationship mostly away from public view, choosing to share only selective glimpses over the years. Their engagement follows a stretch of standout performances for both club and country, adding a meaningful moment to an already defining period in Saka’s life.While the football world has grown used to seeing Saka deliver big performances for Arsenal and England, this moment unfolded far from stadium lights. The evening was described as intimate and meticulously planned, setting the tone for a proposal that insiders say left Tolami “totally blown away.” Their engagement now ties together a relationship that has quietly strengthened in the background while Saka’s career surged to new heights.The proposal came during what sources described as a “special night” inside a top London hotel. One insider said, “Bukayo went all out for the proposal – and the ring he chose is absolutely enormous.He’d organised a special night at a top London hotel and proposed there. It was incredibly special and Tolami was totally blown away” (via The Sun).The evening capped a five-year relationship that began privately before becoming publicly known during the 2022 World Cup, when Tolami was seen supporting Saka alongside the partners of other England players.Tolami later made appearances during Euro 2024, where she wore a jacket marked with the number 87, a nod to Saka’s first Arsenal squad number. The pair also shared a pitchside kiss after England’s draw with Slovenia in June, offering a rare look into their usually discreet dynamic. Tolami, who is originally from Hatfield, studied Public Relations and Media at Birmingham University and now works as a senior planning executive in London.Saka’s engagement arrives during a strong run of form for Arsenal, who sit atop both the Premier League and Champions League tables. He recently helped the Gunners defeat Bayern Munich, continuing a season where he has delivered goals, assists, and leadership, even wearing the captain’s armband in Martin Odegaard’s absence.With his personal and professional life aligning in a year full of milestones, Saka now looks ahead to Arsenal’s upcoming Premier League clash with Chelsea. Tolami, like always, will be by his side.Also Read: Fuzzy Zoeller's cause of death: Golf legend and two-time major winner dies at age 74","Bukayo Saka proposes to girlfriend Tolami Benson at top London hotel.

Steve Tasker responds directly to the viral death rumor



Steve Tasker’s legacy reinforces why the rumor spread so quickly



For a brief stretch on Thanksgiving, confusion rippled across social media after a misleading Facebook post claimed longtime Buffalo Bills great Steve Tasker had died. The post spread fast, fueled by glaring inaccuracies, and created a moment of chaos before Tasker himself shut it down.He quickly stepped in to clear the air, ending the speculation with a short but unmistakable message. The NFL world moved just as fast to correct the narrative once the truth surfaced.The false report listed the wrong birth year, the wrong age, and cited a nonexistent family announcement. Within hours, Tasker posted the screenshot on X with a two-word correction: “I’m fine.” It was enough to stop the rumor cold. Yet the speed at which it circulated left many questioning how such a sloppy claim gained traction in the first place.The fake post originated from a page called Frozen Charge and claimed that Steve Tasker had passed away at 62. It even included a fabricated statement from “his family.” The details immediately raised suspicions, especially as fans spotted the error that listed 1986 as his birth year. Tasker, who is 63, chose to address the situation himself rather than let the hoax linger.His brief message on X did exactly what it needed to do. Fans who had seen the rumor began sharing relief and frustration, calling out how easily misinformation spreads.What made the rumor even stranger was that Tasker had already appeared on The Sean McDermott Show earlier in the day, previewing Buffalo’s matchup with the Pittsburgh Steelers. His regular presence on the weekly program made the claim even more implausible to those who had watched the broadcast.Steve Tasker’s name carries weight across the league. Earlier this month, he was named one of nine semifinalists in the seniors category for the Pro Football Hall of Fame. His resume spans 13 NFL seasons, 12 of them with the Bills, and includes seven Pro Bowls and five first-team All-Pro selections.His reputation was built on relentless special teams play. Coaches designed entire schemes to slow him down. Hall of Fame head coach Marv Levy once said, “On special teams, he turned into a terror. He played the game the way it should be played.” Opponents knew what was coming—blocked punts, forced fumbles, and game-swinging moments that defined an era of Bills football.That impact explains why many reacted so strongly to the false report. Tasker remains a towering figure in Buffalo sports history, and his contributions continue to shape the conversation around special teams value.Also Read: Netflix's Stranger Things' passion helps shape Myles Garrett's identity in Gatorade's revived 1987 campaign","A false Facebook post claimed Buffalo Bills great Steve Tasker had died.

Latest Lamar Jackson Injury Update: Will the Baltimore Ravens QB suit up on Thanksgiving in Week 13?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/latest-lamar-jackson-injury-update-will-the-baltimore-ravens-qb-suit-up-on-thanksgiving-in-week-13/articleshow/125617947.cms,"Lamar Jackson is cleared for Week 13, but is he truly healthy?

Lamar Jackson’s Week 13 injury status and what it actually means for Baltimore

How to watch Ravens vs. Bengals on Thanksgiving (Week 13)

Date: Thursday, Nov. 27



Kickoff: 8:20 p.m. ET



Matchup: Cincinnati Bengals (3-8) at Baltimore Ravens (6-5)



Location: M&T Bank Stadium, Baltimore, Md.



Broadcast: NBC



Streaming: Peacock



Lamar Jackson walked into Week 13 with more questions than usual. The Baltimore Ravens quarterback has dealt with a hamstring strain, knee soreness, ankle issues, and now a toe injury that briefly stalled his practice week. It is the most physically taxing stretch of his eight-year career, and his play has reflected it.He is still expected to start on Thanksgiving night against the Cincinnati Bengals, but the conversation has shifted from availability to whether Jackson can look anything like the quarterback who once dragged Baltimore through games with speed and power. Even the Ravens know he is not moving the same. “God, he got me right there,” Jackson said earlier this week when asked about a hit from Dallas Turner that left him grabbing his lower back.Jackson is officially off the injury report. He practiced fully after sitting out Monday’s walkthrough with a toe issue. That checkmark looks good on paper, but nothing about his recent play looks fully comfortable.Baltimore has won five straight, but Jackson has been held under 200 passing yards for three consecutive games and has not scored in two straight. He is taking more hits, getting the ball out faster than any season of his career, and showing reluctance to run.His longest carry since returning from the hamstring injury is 17 yards. For context, last December he hit 21.25 miles per hour on a 48-yard touchdown run. This year, his top speed is 19.39.The Ravens will not publicly blame the injuries, but the numbers tell on him. His pressure rate is at 35.6 percent, which is on pace to be the highest of his career. He has been sacked 24 times in eight starts, already surpassing last season’s total. Even Patrick Ricard admitted “he’s a tough guy” and that the team will take Jackson even at “50%.”The matchup only raises the stakes. Joe Burrow is returning from turf toe surgery two weeks earlier than expected, and Cincinnati is treating this like a last stand. The Bengals have lost eight of their past nine, but Burrow’s presence always shifts the tone of the rivalry. Baltimore knows it. Zay Flowers said, “They got their quarterback back, so there probably won't be any more excuses.”Jackson has dominated Burrow historically with a 6-1 record, but that version of Jackson was healthier and more explosive. If Baltimore wants to keep control of the AFC North, they need something closer to that player tonight, not the slowed version from the past three weeks.If Jackson is healthy enough to move, Baltimore can control the game. If he is not, the Ravens will need the cleanest defensive performance of their season to hold off a Burrow return that Cincinnati has treated like a movie premiere. The Ravens have been first in the division for only a few days. They cannot afford a regression night now.","Lamar Jackson is officially off the injury report.

Offset, Stefon Diggs , and Jordyn Gorr ended up in the same headline on Nov. 24 after the model posted screenshots that she claims show Offset asking for Diggs’ location. The allegation came with the now-viral phrase “violating me,” and the story spread fast because of the ongoing tension between Offset and his estranged wife, Cardi B , who recently welcomed a baby with Diggs.The screenshots were first reported by TMZ.

Why Brand Luukkonen, Andrei Svechnikov, and more are driving this week’s NHL rumors



LUUUUUUUUK! Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen Highlights From 2024-25 Buffalo Sabres Season

The NHL rumor mill is again generating a lot of speculation around a few of the more persistent players. The Montreal Canadiens are looking for a solution in-goal, plus some of their other issues, such as Andrei Svechnikov's situation and Brad Lambert's contract, are making insiders quite interested and keeping them posted about several situations, depending on how these teams decide to evaluate their depth and long-term plans. Reports this week from Sportsnet, TSN, and The Athletic have ignited a debate throughout the league, and just about everyone has a theory about what might happen.The Canadiens’ campaign has been a tumultuous one, and the poor quality of their goaltending has not been a great help. The offense’s inconsistent performances have indeed made the discussions about a possible upgrade in the goal area servicing the team more and more. On the other hand, the situation in Carolina regarding Svechnikov's ice-time at the beginning of the season has taken an unpredictable turn, while on the other side of the league, Lambert’s name keeps coming up as the Jets contemplate their next step.According to Sportsnet’s Elliotte Friedman, the Montreal Canadiens have been very interested in the Central Predator thought to be the celebrity goalie of the moment - Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen, whose name has been going around the rumor mill after he had a slow start and an early-season injury.Although the young Finnish goalie has a contract through 2028–29 with a $4.75 million cap hit and has a five-team no-trade clause, Friedman pointed out that the Habs are considering each and every option out there. But on the other hand, Buffalo is not ready to be quite clear in its reluctance—the Sabres won’t risk losing their call-up goalie, Colten Ellis, on waivers, which rules out the possibility of trading Luukkonen for now.From Carolina's side, earlier this week, TSN's insider reports indicated that Andrei Svechnikov was not happy with his limited ice time, but now the scenario seems less tense. Svechnikov said to the media that the gossip was “not true,” while coach Rod Brind’Amour swayed over the player’s endorsement of his top-line role, which he traced back to an uptick in the forward’s performance since October.In Winnipeg, The Athletic’s Murat Ates has reported that Brad Lambert has been granted permission to hold talks with interested teams, but GM Kevin Cheveldayoff is not in a hurry to trade. The Jets have the upper hand as they can keep Lambert, who is waiver-exempt until next season and will only let him go if they get something significant in return—possibly along with a draft pick right before the March 6 deadline.Things are still shifting in all three cases; nevertheless, the insiders are in agreement: Montreal, Carolina, and Winnipeg are near each other with very important decisions on the trade talks.Also Read: NHL Trade Rumors: Vancouver Canucks considering trades as Montreal Canadiens show interest in Ryan O’Reilly","Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen, Andrei Svechnikov, Brad Lambert, and more are driving this week’s NHL rumors.

Trevon Diggs and the Dallas Cowboys explain his return timeline

Trevon Diggs has been away from the Dallas Cowboys for several weeks, and fans want to know when he will return. Trevon Diggs has missed games because of a concussion he suffered in an at-home accident, not during a game. The accident happened earlier in the season in Dallas, and the team has still not said exactly how it happened. Along with the concussion, Trevon Diggs has also been dealing with a knee issue, which made things even harder for him.Because of his injuries, Trevor Diggs was placed on Injured Reserve by the Dallas Cowboys, hence missing at least four games as per NFL rules. Though he was qualified to return this week, the Dallas Cowboys did not activate him, therefore, he would miss a fifth straight game. Many supporters are worried about his time outside as his comeback is yet uncertain.Trevon Diggs can be activated from Injured Reserve at any time, but the Dallas Cowboys did not take that step this week.They also did not designate him to return, meaning the earliest he can play is Week 14, and even that is not guaranteed.Once the team gives him the “return from IR” tag, the Cowboys will have 21 days to activate him, so his comeback could still take weeks after that.Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones tried to calm concerns when he spoke to reporters in Dallas.When asked if Trevon Diggs will return this season, Jerry Jones said, “Why not? Yes. Why not?” He added that the team will wait to see how Trevon Diggs heals and that the cornerback is “physically there in full shape for us.”His words show hope, but also remind fans that Trevon Diggs needs time. There has been good news at practice.Trevon Diggs has been working with the Cowboys’ rehab group during sessions in Frisco, Texas, which means he is moving closer to playing again.Coaches said the rehab work is a good sign, but they want to avoid rushing him because of his injury history over the last few years.The Dallas Cowboys also know Trevon Diggs’ long-term future is unclear. His contract has an option the team can use after this season, and many reports in Dallas suggest they may use it.For now, the team’s main focus is getting him healthy, one step at a time, as they wait to see when he can return to the field.Also Read: Is Drake London Playing In Week 13 Vs The Jets?

Golden State Warriors face tough moment as Stephen Curry’s health scare puts pressure on the team

Stephen Curry’s injury leaves Golden State Warriors with uncertain future

After limping off the floor following Wednesday's 104-100 NBA Cup loss to the Houston Rockets, Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry is scheduled for an MRI. According to the Warriors, the problem is a contusion involving the right quad area.When Curry hobbled out of the field late in the fourth quarter, the Warriors announced an MRI would be performed on Curry later on to determine the severity of the problem. Although he struggled with his shot and turned the ball over, he still managed 14 points, six rebounds, and five assists.Due to a right quad contusion, Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry departed Wednesday's game against the Houston Rockets, raising questions about his availability for the team's next game. The head coach of the Warriors found the news to be promising when he spoke to the media following the defeat. He said:“When I heard it was a quad, I was actually relieved… Better than an ankle or a knee. So, hopefully he can recover quickly and be okay, but we gotta hold down the fort..”Throughout the game, Curry was involved in multiple severe collisions. Earlier in the game, Houston center Alperen Şengün left Curry startled with a hard screen, while Rockets star Amen Thompson downed the four-time NBA champion with a shoulder on a drive to the basket in the fourth quarter.Eventually, Curry limped to the locker room with noticeable trouble after departing the bench with 35 seconds remaining in the game.He finished with 14 points, six rebounds, five assists, and seven turnovers in 33 minutes.Rookie Will Richard told reporters:“That's a challenge, if Steph is out everybody else has to kind of improve their game a lot to fill that void..”However, veteran Jimmy Butler said that ""it's just sad"" to see the club disregard their strategy in Curry's absence. He also urged his teammates to ""care more"" about the little things. Butler stated to reporters:“What will change the most? I think we're going to have to be damn near perfect.. We ain't going to have the ultimate bailout on our team, but even when he is on the floor we're going to have to do our job because we make the game real difficult…”He went on to say that even though Curry was a fantastic basketball player, he had a very demanding job every day.During the fourth quarter of the 104-100 loss to the Houston Rockets on Wednesday in San Francisco, Curry suffered injuries from two incidents. The 10-10 Warriors, who have lost four out of the past five games, will host the New Orleans Pelicans on Saturday.Curry's exact return date is not known and will be based on the MRI results. This year, Golden State is only 1-3 without Curry and has the 22nd-rated offense because of the struggles they’ve faced on offense.When the Warriors line up against the New Orleans Pelicans on Saturday, off guard Brandin Podziemski is expected to see increased play action if Curry is out. On the other hand, Curry is putting up 27.9 points, 4.0 assists, and 3.7 rebounds in 16 games started so far this year.Also read: Stephen Curry hints at reason for wearing Sabrina Ionescu’s Nike sneakers in Golden State Warriors–Utah Jazz clash","Golden State Warriors face tough moment as Stephen Curry’s health scare puts pressure on the team.

Hasan disputes Asmongold’s ‘finished’ narrative tied to China trip controversy

Hasan Piker has pushed back strongly against Asmongold’s recent reaction video, where the OTK co-founder framed a few criticism comments from Hasan’s community as evidence that the streamer wasThe controversy began after Hasan’s China trip content resurfaced, including segments where he visited a traditional Chinese medicine clinic and attended horse races. These clips sparked limited backlash within his fanbase, mostly centered on concerns about animal cruelty linked to horse racing. However, Asmongold used those reactions to build a broader narrative that Hasan’s own audience washim, prompting the political commentator to respond publicly.In a stream addressing the situation, Hasan called the framing wildly overstated, saying Asmon’s conclusion was based on minimal evidence. He argued that the idea of his subreddit melting down or his community turning against him was inaccurate and exaggerated for content. According to Hasan, there wasof significance, and treating it as a widespread revolt proved how easily narratives can spiral when built around selective screenshots or out-of-context reactions.The exchange has reignited ongoing conversations about how creator drama is shaped by reaction clips, algorithmic incentives, and parasocial expectations from online audiences.At the core of the disagreement is how both streamers interpret the extent of fan criticism. Hasan’s China trip included segments filmed with local crews, such as his visit to a traditional Chinese medicine setting and a day at the horse races where he mentioned winning roughly $30,000. While some moderators and fans expressed discomfort, particularly regarding horse racing and ethical consistency, Hasan insists these reactions weren’t significant enough to justify anarrative. Asmongold, however, reacted to a clip suggesting otherwise, leaning into the notion that Hasan’s mods were inand his audience was turning on him.In his rebuttal, Hasan emphasized that such portrayals distort reality and perpetuate unnecessary drama, arguing that Asmon’s video inflated the situation far beyond what happened. For Hasan, the issue isn’t disagreement from fans but the way isolated criticism can be weaponized to push a storyline about his reputation.The situation highlights the tension between content creation and creator accountability, especially when reaction videos amplify small incidents into large-scale controversies. Hasan maintains the backlash was minimal, while Asmongold treated it as symptomatic of deeper issues. As the back-and-forth continues to draw attention, it underscores how easily narratives can escalate when fueled by selective clips and the pressure to deliver compelling commentary.Also Read: Who is the Burnt Peanut?

Famous two-time major champion golfer dies at 74 after Masters history (Image via Getty)

Fuzzy Zoeller’s life, his big wins, his mistake, and his long legacy



Fuzzy Zoeller has died at the age of 74, as confirmed by Sky Sports and the USGA. Zoeller was one of golf’s most well-known players. He was the last player to win the Masters on his first try, which he did in 1979 after a three-man playoff. He also won the 1984 U.S. Open.Fans knew him for his happy personality, fast play, and funny moments on the golf course. One of his most famous moments came in 1984, when he waved a white towel because he thought Greg Norman had beaten him. But Norman had not won yet, and Zoeller came back the next day to win in an 18-hole playoff.Fuzzy Zoeller’s career had great wins, but he also faced a big problem in 1997 when he made a hurtful comment about Tiger Woods during the Masters. He later said sorry and called it “the worst thing I’ve gone through in my life,” as written in Golf Digest.Fuzzy Zoeller was born Frank Urban Zoeller Jr. in New Albany, Indiana. His father was also called “Fuzzy,” so he got the same nickname. He played junior college golf, later joined the strong Houston team, and turned professional in 1973.His biggest win came at the 1979 Masters, where he beat Ed Sneed and Tom Watson with a birdie on the second playoff hole. After the ball dropped, he threw his putter high in the air. Sky Sports wrote that he was the last Masters rookie to ever win the event.In the 1984 U.S. Open at Winged Foot, Zoeller thought Greg Norman had made a birdie, so he waved a white towel. Later he learned it was only a par. They played an 18-hole playoff the next day, and Zoeller won by eight shots, a huge margin. His only regret was giving the towel away to a kid before he knew he needed it for memories.Zoeller won two major titles, eight other PGA Tour events, and two PGA Tour Champions titles. He was given the Bob Jones Award by the USGA in 1985 for his sportsmanship.His wife, Diane, died in 2021. Zoeller had three children, including daughter Gretchen, who played with him in the PNC Championship.Fuzzy Zoeller leaves behind a life filled with big wins, fun moments, and lessons he said he would never forget.Also Read: Why Did A Biological Male Win The World’s Strongest Woman?

Look who is back! Virat Kohli arrives for the ODI series vs South Africa

WATCH: Dhoni driving Kohli back to hotel

NEW DELHI: In one of the most heart-warming off-field moments Indian cricket has witnessed in recent years, a video of MS Dhoni personally driving Virat Kohli back to the Indian team hotel after a private dinner at his Ranchi residence set social media into a frenzy on Thursday night. The clip, shared widely by fans on X, shows Dhoni behind the wheel of his SUV with Kohli seated beside him — a rare yet deeply nostalgic sight that instantly triggered a wave of emotional reactions across the cricket community.The former India captain hosted Kohli and wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant at his Ranchi farmhouse on November 27, a quiet evening that turned into an internet-breaking reunion once fans spotted Kohli entering the Dhoni residence. Hours later, Dhoni drove Kohli back — no security entourage, no flashy escort — resurrected memories of their long partnership that shaped Indian cricket for more than a decade. While sharing the video, Star Sports even captioned it the “Reunion of the Year.”Kohli, who returned to India from London on Wednesday, is in Ranchi ahead of the first ODI against South Africa on November 30. The series marks his comeback to Ranchi for a match after missing the England Test in February 2024, the last time the city hosted an international match, due to the birth of his son, Akaay.He last featured for India on October 25 in Sydney, where his unbeaten 74 helped India avoid a whitewash against Australia.As Team India prepares for the three-match ODI series — with KL Rahul leading the side due to injuries to Shubman Gill and Shreyas Iyer — Kohli is set to slot back at No. 3. His ODI numbers remain unmatched: 14,255 runs, 51 centuries, and record-breaking consistency across formats.Pant, meanwhile, returns to the ODI setup after more than a year as India aim to bounce back following the Test series defeat to South Africa. With Rohit Sharma , Yashasvi Jaiswal, and a revamped middle order, the team will look to start strong in Ranchi.","MS Dhoni personally drives Virat Kohli back to the Indian team hotel after a private dinner at his Ranchi residence.

Poll Which factor do you think had the biggest impact on Indian players' performance in the World Cup? Home pressure Format of the tournament Gameplay tactics Motivation and hunger

ALSO READ:

NEW DELHI: Chess-wise, Wednesday was a day of celebration. Edging toward its final month, the year produced its second 19-year-old, and youngest-ever, World Cup winner. The first, of course, was India’s own Divya Deshmukh, who brought home the women’s title earlier this year. The second is Uzbekistan’s Javokhir Sindarov, a name not many would have pencilled in while predicting the line-up for the 2026 Candidates.But with the title in Goa, Sindarov booked the ticket for the 2026 Candidates, where he will attempt to earn a shot at D Gukesh’s World Championship title.Much like Divya, who had entered the fray as the 15th seed during her career-defining triumph in Georgia, Sindarov too was far from the favourites. Remarkably just a day older than Divya, the Uzbek teenager began as the 16th seed and capitalised brilliantly on the knock-out format, stringing together a dream run that ultimately carried him to the title.Yet beneath the celebration lay disappointment and the void of a missed chance.India hosted the World Cup after 23 long years, with a record 24 home players in the field, but not one made the top three qualifying spots for the Candidates.Arjun Erigaisi came the closest before bowing out in the quarterfinals with a defeat to China’s Wei Yi, who finished runner-up.So the question remains: what went wrong for the Indians?Just around a month back, the journey of the World Cup began with 206 players from across the globe. Known for its gruelling 90+30 time control and subsequent rapid tie-breaks, it’s one of the few elite events that works entirely on knockout. In short: one bad day and you’re out.""FIDE World Cup is a type of tournament where everybody out of the top 10 or 20 has a 15% chance of winning,"" GM Levon Aronian had said before the tournament began.The match structure mostly favours the lower-rated player.“It’s just two classical games… quite often the sides that are more or less not as highly rated will make a draw with white and wait for their chance (with black). Everything can happen in one single game,” Levon recently told TimesofIndia.com.Playing with White, a higher-rated player often feels obliged to press, to prove an advantage from the first move. But that freedom can backfire. In a knockout format, the player with Black can simply stay solid, wait for a slip, and suddenly the burden shifts. This year, in both the Women’s and Open World Cups, several matches hinged on a single game where White overreached and paid the price.India’s top seeds weren’t immune. Gukesh, Arjun Erigaisi, Pentala Harikrishna, Vidit Gujrathi, and Aravindh Chithambaram, all ranked within the top 25, were knocked out by lower-rated opponents, and in every case, the decisive loss came with the White pieces.Who doesn't want to flaunt in front of the home crowd? The FIDE World Cup gave Indian players a chance. But were they ready?Playing at home brings comfort, support, and a very particular kind of pressure. A roaring crowd can uplift but also suffocate. Expectations aren’t spoken so much as felt.""Of course, it attracts so much pressure, but I think I would've to get into a mindset where it doesn't affect my chess,"" GM Pranesh M told TimesofIndia.com ahead of the FIDE World Cup.In a sport where calmness is oxygen, emotional wobble can flip a stable position into disaster. Hosting the event was a milestone for India, but also a weight not everyone carried equally well.Besides the title, branded as the Viswanathan Anand Trophy, three Candidates’ spots were up for grabs. With 206 participants, everyone had a realistic chance of making the Candidates.While the path is wider -- ratings, Grand Swiss, FIDE Circuit -- for top Indians, others saw the FIDE World Cup as their only way into the Candidates.Decades ago, World Championship qualification had one winding but clear pathway: nationals, zonals, inter-zonals, then Candidates""The world was divided into several zones, and if you played well in the interzonal championships, you would thereby qualify for the Candidates Tournament. So there was one single channel through which everybody could qualify,"" Veteran Grandmaster Pravin Thipsay told this website.""Today, if you look at it, there are at least 500 players strong enough to become surprise candidates and emerge into the last eight. At least 500 players are capable of doing that if they perform at their best.""But now we have various phases and various seedings. Some top players get seeded by rating, while others get seeded by virtue of playing in Grand Swiss tournaments, which are again restricted only to very strong players.""For many top Indians, having multiple routes to Candidates' qualification works as a safety net, whereas there is no such thing for others.""So a large number, five out of eight, qualify through these different channels, and only three players qualify through what may be called the proper channel… for a common player, this is the only channel. So one could say that the common player is more motivated in this particular tournament,"" the veteran Grandmaster added.And it was not as if Indians left the field without a fight; many showed that hunger. Diptayan Ghosh upset Ian Nepomniachtchi early, while Pranav V, SL Narayanan, and Harikrishna pushed deep into the field. But hunger is only one ingredient. Consistency in chaos is another.There is a growing concern in the Indian chess fraternity. With trainers and coaches more inclined towards AI and chess engines, the creativity on the board is somewhat evaporating.""Now everybody has the best engines and powerful hardware, so there’s very little that separates one player from another... Earlier, it wasn’t like that -- you had to sit for hours, work through lines, go deeper yourself. There was always a horizon effect; after a few moves, the engine stopped seeing clearly,"" Vidit Gujhrathi told TimesofIndia.com recently during an exclusive interview.""But today, with neural-network-based AI, engines give you answers immediately. So the barrier to learning openings has dropped significantly. And chess, by its nature, is a draw-ish game. If both sides play perfectly, the most likely result is a draw, maybe 51–49 either way.”And once a match enters a tie-break, it's anyone's game.""Are we really thinking about chess? Are we playing creative chess ourselves? Do we know where we end our preparation? Do we actually know what is to be done next?"" Thipsay asked.""Otherwise, this preparation has no value. And you end up playing to get a better position according to the engine. And you do not know what the plan is to be made. Those who are shrewd and intelligent enough to apply this policy of preparing well at the same time find out what is to be done next.""Both in the Women's World Cup and the Open section in Goa, those who put creativity over engines had the last laugh. It perhaps leaves a lesson for the future.And even if the Indian challenge faded in the air at the Goa World Cup, all hope is not lost, with R Praggnanandhaa closing in on securing the final Candidates spot available through the FIDE Circuit.For India, that would ensure at least one representation in the Candidates. The number could well have been more than one. But as they say, it's what it is.","Uzbekistan’s Javokhir Sindarov won the FIDE Chess World Cup 2025.

Smriti Mandhana To Skip 'Kaun Banega Crorepati' Episode?

NEW DELHI: India’s Women’s World Cup hero Jemimah Rodrigues has withdrawn from the remainder of the Women’s Big Bash League (WBBL) season, choosing to stay back home to support close friend and teammate Smriti Mandhana after her wedding was postponed due to a sudden health issue concerning Mandhana’s father. Jemimah, who had flown to India 10 days ago after Brisbane Heat’s match against Hobart Hurricanes for what was supposed to be a brief pre-arranged trip, was scheduled to rejoin her WBBL side this week. But with the unforeseen development, she requested a release — one the franchise agreed to without hesitation.“The Brisbane Heat have agreed to a request to release Jemimah Rodrigues from the remainder of the Women’s Big Bash League,” the club announced in a statement. It confirmed that Rodrigues “returned home to India” for Mandhana’s wedding but stayed back after the celebrations were “subsequently postponed due to a health issue with Mandhana's father.”The Heat said they fully supported Jemimah’s decision: “Rodrigues will stay in India to support her teammate, and the Heat has agreed to her not returning for the final four games of the WBBL season.”Jemimah, who was Brisbane Heat’s No.1 pick in the International Player Draft this year, had been in strong form and remains a key figure in India’s cricketing rise.She was instrumental in India clinching their maiden Women’s World Cup title, smashing an unbeaten century in the semifinal against seven-time champions Australia — a knock that has already entered Indian cricket folklore.Brisbane Heat CEO Terry Svenson called it “a challenging time” for the 24-year-old. “While it is unfortunate that she will take no further part in the WBBL, we were more than willing to agree to her request to remain in India,” he said. “The Heat club obviously wish her and Smriti Mandhana's family all the best. Jemi told us she was disappointed not to be coming back and has passed on her appreciation to the club and the fans for being so understanding. ”With Rodrigues staying back, the Heat will now play their final league games without one of their biggest international stars — but with full empathy for her decision.",Jemimah Rodrigues has withdrawn from the remainder of the Women's Big Bash League. The 24-year-old will stay back in India to support her teammate Smriti Mandhana. The wedding was postponed due to a sudden health issue concerning MandHana’s father.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125610275,imgsize-67892,width-400,resizemode-4/smriti-mandhana-jemimah-rodrigues.jpg"

A racial critique that dissolves into racial caricature

When real people are turned into disposable archetypes

Projection disguised as commentary





The ending that should disturb all of us









Since Donald Trump announced he would be picking JD Vance to be his running mate, Usha Vance has undergone the kind of scrutiny that has hardly ever occurred to an Indian-American. MAGA folks freaked out that she was a practising Hindu, and it was immaterial that her faith had helped JD find Christ again. Democrats wondered how a person with Usha’s credentials (Yale, academic family) could be with someone like JD or who followed JD’s politics. JD Vance hasn’t helped himself, like the time he told a Turning Point USA audience that he hoped his “agnostic” wife — what a way to erase her religion — would embrace Christ, even doubling down to claim that it was every Christian’s job to help others see the light. But even after all the disparaging rumours aimed at Usha Vance, a recent podcast featuring Joy Reid starkly shows how easy it is for people to dehumanise Indian-Americans.Reid, wearing a t-shirt that says F*** Trump, F*** ICE, Free Palestine, Unoccupy Chicago, and a bunch of other messages which combined explain the dire strait in which the Democratic Party finds itself, casually claims that JD Vance will drop his “brown Hindu wife” Usha for “white queen” Erika Kirk.What makes this moment especially disturbing is how neatly it fits into the rise of anti-India hate online and offline.In recent years, Indians in the West have found themselves cast into every role except that of actual human beings. They are colonial agents one day, fascist foot soldiers the next, tech bros on Monday, caste villains on Tuesday, and accidental beneficiaries of “white adjacency” by the weekend. It is a rotating caricature factory that reduces 1.4 billion people to whichever label best suits the Western cultural mood. And Indian-Americans are often caught at the intersection of all these projections. The same progressives who champion diversity suddenly talk as if Hindu identity is a contaminated category. The same conservatives who praise family values treat brown families as demographic threats. Usha Vance, unfortunately, becomes the perfect canvas for the week’s anxieties. Not because of anything she said, but because her existence unsettles the simplistic narratives both sides prefer.The moment Reid begins to speak, it is clear this is not analysis. It is improvisation dressed up as political insight. “They can’t have the successor to MAGA be the guy with the brown Hindu wife,” she declares, as if she has unlocked a hidden psychological truth about an entire voting bloc. She calls them “Christian nationalists,” insists Usha “won’t work,” and then suggests JD Vance is either sacrificing his wife for ambition or that Usha herself is complicit in the performance.She then fixates on JD Vance’s public hug with Erika Kirk, calling it “slap-and-tickle” and “the weirdest shit,” and pivots to critiquing Erika’s clothing with, “You’re supposed to be a widow. You in leather pants?” These are not the observations of a serious political thinker. They are the lines of someone scrolling through gossip threads and mistaking them for structural analysis.Finally she arrives at the centrepiece of her theory. “Wouldn’t it be the most perfect MAGA fairytale if he finally sees the light that he needs a white queen instead of this brown Hindu.” She adds a quick “I’m not saying that’s happening,” but the narrative is already complete. The hierarchy is drawn. The brown woman is written out.What is most striking about the segment is the contradiction between Reid’s t-shirt and her argument. She wears slogans about liberation, solidarity, resistance and justice. Then she denies every one of those ideals to a brown woman who did nothing except marry someone with different politics.Reid says she is calling out racism, but she ends up performing it. She does not see Usha Vance as a lawyer, a mother, a daughter of immigrants or a woman balancing two faith traditions. She sees her as a demographic problem. A cultural obstacle. An inconvenient symbol of brownness and Hindu identity that, in her mind, cannot fit inside a movement she despises.It is easy to condemn racism when it comes from the other side. It is harder to notice when it slips out while criticising the other side. The t-shirt says “Free Palestine.” The monologue denies empathy to an Indian-American Hindu woman who is, by every measure, as much a minority as anyone Reid claims to defend.Underneath the moral performance, the entire theory comes from three unrelated moments. Erika Kirk, grieving the murder of her husband, said she wished she had been pregnant when he died. “I was praying to God that I was pregnant when he got murdered,” she shared with Megyn Kelly during a tour stop in Glendale. It was a moment of pain, not a confession. JD Vance hugged her on stage in full public view. It was sympathy, not symbolism. And Usha Vance appeared without her wedding ring one afternoon. It was an ordinary oversight, not a marital crisis.None of these events belong together. They were stitched into a story only because the internet craves drama. And instead of challenging that logic, Reid absorbed it, embroidered it and presented it as something profound.The widow became an archetype. The wife became a liability. The husband became a character in a political telenovela.It was rumour inflated into racial prophecy.There is a special cruelty in dragging two women into a plot they never agreed to inhabit. Erika Kirk is barely beginning her life as a widow, yet she is recast as a “white queen” waiting in the wings. Usha Vance, who has kept an almost painfully private profile, is turned into an emblem of “brown Hindu” undesirability. Neither woman asked to be the heroine or the villain of this fever dream. Neither deserves to be reduced to the colour wheel of someone else’s political imagination.JD Vance, for all his flaws, becomes a piece on a board. In Reid’s story he is not a husband or father. He is a man conducting a marital reshuffle to please a base that exists only inside her claim.The humanity is lost. What remains is theatre.The problem is not simply that Joy Reid repeated a conspiracy. It is that she treated it as obvious. She began with the assumption that MAGA is racist and ended with the conclusion that its chosen successor must behave in ways that confirm her view. It is commentary built backwards: the conclusion arrives first, the justification later. This is the same logic she spent years accusing right-wing media of using. Start with the villain. Start with the allegation. Fill in the rest. Do not worry about the truth. Worry about the story.When the noise settles, the truth is small and human. A widow missing her husband. A woman who occasionally forgets her ring. A public hug meant as comfort. There is no conspiracy here. Only life happening in its messy, tender, inconvenient way.Yet three people were dragged through a podcast and reduced to plot points. Usha became the wrong kind of wife. Erika became the tempting “other woman.” JD became the protagonist of a love triangle that never existed.And this was said on a platform that presents itself as political thought.Imagine, for a moment, the mirror image. Imagine a conservative podcaster declaring that Michelle Obama was the “wrong kind of wife,” and that Barack Obama needed a “white queen” to be more acceptable to America. Imagine the outrage. Imagine the editorials. Imagine the rightly furious conversations about racism, misogyny and the dehumanisation of Black women.Now imagine what Usha Vance felt hearing her marriage framed the same way. This was not commentary. It was a small, callous story told with the confidence of someone who assumed there would be no consequences. It revealed how quickly empathy collapses when the woman in question does not belong to your political tribe. It showed how easily the language of justice can be used to justify the erasure of someone else’s dignity. The podcast will fade. The clip will scroll away. But the message remains. It tells us that for some commentators, solidarity is conditional. Dignity is selective. And some women are granted humanity only when their politics align. That should trouble us far more than any rumour ever could.","Since Donald Trump announced he would be picking JD Vance to be his running mate, Usha Vance has undergone the kind of scrutiny that has hardly ever occurred to an Indian-American.

Jordan Love injury explained: Here’s why he is switching to right-hand handoffs for the Packers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/jordan-love-injury-explained-heres-why-he-is-switching-to-right-hand-handoffs-for-the-packers/articleshow/125623939.cms,"Getty Images

Jordan Love’s shoulder injury and how it happened and why he’s using only right-hand handoffs



Fans couldn’t help but notice something strange in the Packers’ latest games, Jordan Love handing off the football with his right hand, even on plays that normally call for a left-hand motion. At first, it looked awkward, almost like a trick play gone wrong. But there’s a reason behind the odd technique, an injury. Here’s a closer look at why the Packers QB is adjusting his style and what it could mean for Green Bay’s offense.The root of the right-hand handoffs is Love’s left shoulder injury, specifically a separated shoulder / AC joint sprain. This is his non-throwing shoulder, so thankfully his passing arm isn’t affected. The injury occurred during a recent game when Love took a hit after scrambling, briefly leaving the field for X-rays before returning to finish the game.Despite the injury, Love insists he can still play through it. Coach Matt LaFleur confirmed that while the QB is dealing with soreness, it hasn’t forced him out of action, yet. Fans are now watching closely to see how this tweak affects the Packers’ overall offense.Because the left shoulder is injured, Love has been handing off the ball exclusively with his right hand, even on plays that normally would require a left-hand motion.Using the left hand could aggravate the injury, so the team adapted.Interestingly, this isn’t completely new for Love. Earlier in the season, he adjusted his technique due to thumb surgery on his left hand. Coach LaFleur has said that relying on one-handed handoffs is “not natural” and can put the ball at risk, making it a necessary but imperfect workaround.In short, while Love can still play, the Packers offense may be slightly more cautious and less dynamic until his shoulder heals.The good news? Love is tough and willing to play through discomfort, giving Green Bay a chance to stay competitive while the team adapts to his temporary limitation. While it’s affecting how he hands off the ball, it hasn’t stopped him from leading the Packers on the field. Fans will be watching closely in the coming weeks to see if this one-handed technique remains a temporary fix or starts shaping Green Bay’s offensive strategy for the rest of the season.Also read - Will George Pickens play against the Kansas City Chiefs today ?

Who is Clavicular? Inside the controversial looksmaxxing streamer behind the Kick injection scandal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/who-is-clavicular-inside-the-controversial-looksmaxxing-streamer-behind-the-kick-injection-scandal/articleshow/125623957.cms,"Image Via ""X""

“heartbreaking,” “evil,”

“deeply disturbing.”

Inside the rise of Clavicular and the controversy surrounding his Kick injection incident

“hardmaxxing”

“recessed mandibles,”

“self-improvement”





Clavicular, real name Braden Peters, has become one of the most polarizing figures in the growing looksmaxxing space, a subculture fixated on appearance enhancement that ranges from harmless grooming tips to extreme, medically questionable practices. Over the past year, the 20-year-old influencer has built a devoted but highly divided following across TikTok, Kick, and other platforms by dissecting facial structures, rating people’s attractiveness using pseudo-scientific language, and promoting aggressive self-improvement routines. But his latest on-stream stunt, injecting his 17-year-old girlfriend with cosmetic peptides, has pushed him into a different level of controversy entirely.The incident, which unfolded during a Kick stream, has drawn widespread condemnation, with viewers accusing him of exploiting a minor, glamorizing dangerous procedures, and potentially engaging in the unlicensed practice of medicine. The backlash was immediate, with dozens of viral posts calling the situationandFor critics, the stream confirmed what many feared: that the looksmaxxing world has quickly evolved from edgy self-help to reckless, real-world experimentation, and influencers like Clavicular are at the center of that shift.To understand why Clavicular resonates with a young male audience, one has to understand the roots of looksmaxxing itself. Emerging from incel forums in the 2010s, the movement promotes maximizing one’s physical appeal, sometimes through routine habits like skincare and fitness, but often through extreme methods such as limb-lengthening, steroid use, andtactics. Clavicular capitalized on this culture after claiming to undergo a dramatic glow-up, attributing his transformation to strict looksmaxxing practices. His content largely revolves around critiquing facial symmetry, jawlines, andoften rating celebrities harshly, including giving Michael B. Jordan a 3.5/10.Clavicular quickly aligned himself with other manosphere creators like Andrew Tate, Ed Matthews, and HStikkytokky, adopting a blend of hyper-critical beauty commentary and traditionalist gender expectations. This posture carried into his relationship, where he has publicly pressured his girlfriend to drop out of college, while simultaneously subjecting her appearance to his looksmaxxing standards. But injecting a minor on stream has crossed a legal and ethical line that even his usual critics didn’t foresee, sparking debates about exploitation, consent, and the dangers of online influence.As the backlash continues, Clavicular’s case has become a flashpoint in the broader conversation about the risks of unregulatedsubcultures online. Whether this marks a turning point for the looksmaxxing movement or simply the latest scandal in an increasingly extreme digital landscape remains to be seen, but for now, the spotlight on Clavicular shows no signs of dimming.Also Read: Hasan Pikar calls out Asmongold for ‘Hasan is finished’ video over China trip clips","Clavicular, real name Braden Peters, has become one of the most polarizing figures in the growing looksmaxxing space.

Zach LaVine and Hunter's soft Instagram family picture draws attention

Zach LaVine's surprising trade rumor adds fresh angle as Milwaukee Bucks reportedly eye the star

Zach LaVine has been making headlines as he and his wife Hunter LaVine celebrated Thanksgiving. Dressed in soft, neutral tones that blended beautifully with the warm holiday scene, the couple's three little ones posed for a picture outdoors with their parents.The pictorial record was made during the time when there were whispers about him possibly signing with the Milwaukee Bucks. LaVine was previously associated with the Bucks before the 2025 trade deadline, right before he was transferred to the Sacramento Kings. It is quite reasonable to keep the hunt going as the price to acquire him now is most likely lower than it was last winter.Zach LaVine’s wife, Hunter LaVine, uploaded the Instagram photo on November 27 and captioned it:“The best part of my every day! Happy Thanksgiving..”Zach LaVine, his partner, and his five-member family are shown in the picture posing outside in a bright garden. Hunter carries a light-clad newborn girl along with a bow.They are all in front of a large white background. A palm tree could be seen in the distance. The picture has a calm look as they are all wearing soft and neutral colors like beige and white.The picture came amidst the rumor of Zach getting into the Milwaukee Bucks.HoopsHype's Michael Scotto claims that the Bucks had done some ""background due diligence"" on Sacramento Kings guard Zach LaVine.LaVine was connected to Milwaukee before the 2025 trade deadline, before he relocated to Sacramento. Since acquiring him is presumably less expensive now than it was last winter, it makes sense to eye him now.Stating the same, Scotto said:""Should Milwaukee’s interest in LaVine become more serious, it’s worth noting that Bucks forward Kyle Kuzma and Kings Governor Vivek Ranadive both invested in a new women’s professional sports venture called Major League Volleyball, and Kuzma has been linked to the Kings via trade rumors for several seasons.""For context, trade rumors have connected Kyle Kuzma to the Sacramento Kings for years. The Milwaukee Bucks would be happy to send Kuzma to Sacramento if they receive an impact player like LaVine in exchange, sending the forward to California at last after years of speculation.Meanwhile, the 6'5"" guard is still a potent scorer. He is making 38.6 percent of his threes and averaging 20.5 points on 49.8 percent shooting. When he scored 31 points and made six three-pointers in a 135-133 victory for the Kings on November 1, the Bucks witnessed firsthand his offensive prowess.Also read: What is Zach LaVine's Net Worth in 2025?

Tom Brady’s slip sparks reactions across social media





Tom Brady made an unfortunate mistake while calling the Dallas Cowboys vs. Philadelphia Eagles game on Sunday. It happened in the final minutes, when the tension of the NFC East clash had already gripped the stadium and viewers at home. While analyzing the sack on Jalen Hurts by Osa Odighizuwa, Brady stumbled over the name of Eagles lineman Landon Dickerson. The slip briefly created a moment of confusion before Brady immediately corrected himself and continued his commentary with calm professionalism.The seven-time Super Bowl champion is in his second season working in FOX’s lead booth with Kevin Burkhardt. In May 2022, FOX brought him in on a 10-year, 375 million dollar deal, making him the highest-paid sports commentator in history. The NFL initially placed certain limits on him due to his ownership stake with the Raiders, but this season those rules were “relaxed,” allowing him into production meetings and private player sessions that make the job more immersive.Tom Brady nearly had an unfortunate on-air slip-up while calling Sunday's game between the Dallas Cowboys and Philadelphia Eagles. As viewers replayed the moment, some wondered whether they had heard correctly. Brady was describing the sack when he said, ""Odighizuwa just blasted through Nicker,"" before swiftly adding, ""Excuse me, [Eagles guard] Landon Dickerson right there.""That instant was enough to light a match online. One viewer wrote, ""Sounds like Tom Brady said the infamous 'N' word,"" while another demanded, ""WHAT DID TOM BRADY JUST SAY?????"" Others quickly defended him, arguing it was nothing more than a verbal mix-up.One person clarified, ""He said 'Nicker-' as in Nickerson,"" and another noted how easy it is for a broadcaster to get tongue-tied during a live call, saying, ""He said nicker when going to say Landon Dickersons name he just got tongue tied yall blow everything outta proportion. ""Away from the chatter, Jerry Jones' Dallas Cowboys made a historic comeback, erasing a 21-point deficit in a dramatic 24-21 victory. Cowboys wideout George Pickens explained the turnaround, saying, ""I feel like the first half we were just a little bit sloppy, just shooting ourself in the foot."" Dak Prescott helped drive the rally, finishing with 354 passing yards and becoming the franchise’s all-time leader in fourth-quarter and overtime comebacks.For Tom Brady, the moment tells us that live broadcasting demands precision. His legacy on the field is unquestioned, and that same credibility is what earned him the headset.Also Read: Nyier Daniels behind the bars as felony child cruelty and police evasion rock Georgia football program","Tom Brady made an unfortunate mistake while calling the Dallas Cowboys vs. Philadelphia Eagles game on Sunday.
