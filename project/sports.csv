Late Drama and Rain-Shortened Day

Looking Ahead

The first Test between Zimbabwe and Afghanistan in Bulawayo ended in a thrilling draw on Monday, with both teams achieving record-breaking feats.Zimbabwe's first innings saw them amass a colossal 586 runs, surpassing their previous highest Test score of 563/9 against the West Indies in 2001. Afghanistan responded with an even more remarkable 699 all out, establishing their own record for the highest innings total, beating their previous best of 545/4, also achieved against Zimbabwe in 2021.The Afghan innings was highlighted by captain Hashmatullah Shahidi 's historic 246, a national record, and Rahmat Shah's 234. Together, they forged a massive 364-run third-wicket partnership, the highest in Afghanistan's Test history for any wicket. Shahidi’s 246 eclipsed his previous best of 200 against Zimbabwe in Abu Dhabi. Wicketkeeper Afsar Zazai also contributed a maiden Test century with 113 runs, further solidifying Afghanistan's dominance in their first innings.Zimbabwe's Brian Bennett, a 21-year-old spinner in only his second Test, showcased his all-around brilliance. Bennett took a career-best 5/95 in Afghanistan's innings and earlier contributed an unbeaten 110 with the bat in Zimbabwe's first innings.Afghanistan’s innings ended in a collapse, with the last six wickets falling for just 20 runs in four overs, largely due to Bennett's spin. In their second innings, Zimbabwe reached 142/4, avoiding further damage thanks to an unbroken 54-run partnership between veterans Sean Williams (35) and Craig Ervine (22).The match's conclusion was impacted by mid-afternoon rain, which caused a delay of over an hour. Zimbabwe showed resilience, with debutant Ben Curran impressing with 41 runs before a run-out, and opener Joylord Gumbie contributing 24.The second and final Test of the series begins Thursday, also in Bulawayo, with both teams eager to build on the momentum from this high-scoring encounter.For context, Sri Lanka still hold the record for the highest-ever Test innings score with 952/6 declared against India in Colombo in 1997.","The first Test between Zimbabwe and Afghanistan in Bulawayo ended in a thrilling draw on Monday.

WATCH VIDEO

The closing stages of the Boxing Day Test between India and Australia in Melbourne were marred by controversy around Yashasvi Jaiswal 's caught-behind decision, which was given out by the third umpire.During the last session of the match, Jaiswal missed a pull shot against Pat Cummins and the ball went past his bat and gloves as the bowler went up in appeal, but the umpire shook his head in denial.Cummins signalled for a review straight away and the third umpire gave it out, overruling the on-field decision.Seeing no deviation on the 'Snickometer' during replays shown on the giant screen, Jaiswal had a long discussion with the umpires before walking back.Former players and experts remained divided in their opinion on the decision. However, a latest video released by the Australian media hints at Jaiswal possibly telling Travis Head that he did get a touch on the ball and the Australian batter could be seen raising his arms in delight, signalling 'out' to his teammates.The decision left India staring at a defeat, as Jaiswal, who scored 84, was the last hope to save the Test. But India slipped from 121 for 3 to 155 all out, resulting in a 184-run victory for Australia, which gave them a 2-1 lead in the five-match series with just the Sydney Test left to play.After the match ended, India captain Rohit Sharma was asked about his views on the controversial call during the press conference.He felt Jaiswal did get a touch.""It didn't show on Snicko, but with the naked eye there was a deflection. In all fairness, it looked like he touched it, but more often than not we fall on the wrong side of such decisions,"" Rohit said.Australia now need just a draw in the last Test at Sydney to reclaim the Border Gavaskar Trophy for the first time since 2014.","Yashasvi Jaiswal's caught-behind decision marred by controversy.

BUCKS at BULLS | FULL GAME HIGHLIGHTS | December 28, 2024

When and where to watch the Milwaukee Bucks vs Indiana Pacers game tonight (December 31, 2024)?

Milwaukee Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo is listed as “questionable” for his team’s game against the Indiana Pacers tonight. Giannis has been missing from the Bucks’ lineup for four consecutive games due to an Illness he picked up following the game against the Cavaliers. On a more positive note, Antetokounmpo participated in his team’s latest practice session.Doc Rivers is also hoping to see him play against the Pacers.When asked about a possible minutes restriction, Doc replied saying, “Just see how he plays...(No minutes restriction) that I know of.” The Bucks have been able to hold their own in Giannis’ absence and have a record of three wins and three losses. The team is currently sixth in the East with a record of 16-14 and looks poised to improve over the coming weeks.Antetokounmpo is averaging 32.7 points, 11.6 rebounds, and 6.0 assists per game while shooting a stellar 61.3% from the field. His efficiency on offense and tenacity on defense have played a huge role in helping the Bucks take the sixth seed in the tightly contested Eastern Conference. Giannis has also been historically good against the Pacers averaging 24.5 points, 9.9 rebounds, and 5.0 assists through 41 games against them.So, having him take the floor tonight will provide a big boost to the squad. If there are any road bumps and Antetokounmpo misses tonight’s game, we can expect a big performance out of Damian Lillard. The 34-year-old is averaging 25.9 points, 4.6 rebounds, and 7.7 assists per game and also shoots a respectable 44.8% from the field. However, it is worth noting that the Bucks are currently on a two-game losing streak, so Giannis’ presence will be very welcome tonight.This could turn out to be a close game, but if Giannis returns tonight, which he likely will, the Bucks should be able to overcome the Pacers. Indiana simply doesn’t have enough quality on their roster to keep up with the Bucks over four quarters of play. It'll be interesting to see how they plan on holding back the Bucks' potent offense tonight.ALSO READ: Milwaukee Bucks vs Indiana Pacers (12/31) game preview: Starting five, prediction, best betting props, odds and betting lines, injury report, how to watch, and more The Milwaukee Bucks will be traveling to the Gainbridge Fieldhouse to take on the Indiana Pacers on December 31, 2024.

Pat Cummins on India’s approach on Day 5, Rishabh Pant’s shot and Travis Head’s celebration

Australian batter Travis Head 's unexpected bowling heroics in the Melbourne Test came with a celebration that left fans and players alike buzzing. After dismissing Rishabh Pant in the final session of Day 5 - a breakthrough that triggered India's collapse — Head celebrated in a uniquely quirky way.The unusual gesture quickly went viral, with some hailing it as quirky and others questioning its intent.Head, however, was quick to clarify its meaning after the match.""Finger on the ice,"" Head said during an interview with Triple M Radio. ""I started it in Sri Lanka. I put my finger on the ice and be ready to go for the next one.""Head further elaborated on his unexpected bowling role in the Test. ""I didn't expect to be bowling. I thought Galle would be my next bowling. I'll go put it down in a little cup of ice, be ready to go up there next,"" he joked, referring to Australia's upcoming series in Sri Lanka.Australia captain Pat Cummins also chimed in on the lighthearted gesture during the post-match press conference. ""His finger is so hot that he is going to put it in a cup of ice. Yes, that's what it is,"" Cummins said with a laugh. ""That's normally the running joke. Was it at the Gabba or somewhere, where he got a wicket as well and just got straight to the fridge, grabs a bucket of ice, puts his finger in.""Head's celebration, while entertaining, has not been without criticism. Former India batter Navjot Singh Sidhu expressed disapproval and called on the ICC to impose penalties for what he deemed an inappropriate display.As social media continues to dissect his “finger on the ice” moment, Head's quirky celebration has become a highlight of an already memorable Test match.","Travis Head took wicket of Rishabh Pant in the final session of Day 5.

Christian McCaffrey’s dad fired a furious defense of the final game

Christian McCaffrey has been selected as the No. 23 for the 49ers even though the latter had a pretty disappointing season by losing to the Chiefs in Super Bowl LVIII . With only two games remaining on their schedule, San Francisco has nothing to play for. Ed McCaffrey , who won his first Super Bowl ring with the 49ers in 1995, wants the team to approach the game with a positive mindset as they have nothing to play for.Christian McCaffrey's father, Ed, defended his final game of the season after Patrick Mahomes prepared to play for the Kansas City Chiefs . The Cincinnati Bengals beat the Denver Broncos in overtime, keeping their hopes of making the NFL Playoffs alive. They need to beat the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 18 and hope the Broncos lose to the Chiefs, who secured their ninth consecutive AFC West title.The Super Bowl champions, Chiefs, are resting some of the key players to prepare for the next games. Running back Isiah Pacheco was nursing a rib injury, while Chris Jones sat out the Christmas Day win over the Steelers due to injury.Mahomes, who is nursing an ankle injury, is expected to be replaced by Carson Wentz at center. Travis Kelce is also limited with his age and importance to the Chiefs' game plan. The Chiefs are talking about the outcome of the game on social media, and three-time Super Bowl champion Ed McCaffrey said that the notion of ""meaningless"" games applies even to the Chiefs.In an Instagram story, Ed McCaffrey said, “I remember playing in so-called “meaningless” @NFL games at the end of the season. Let me tell ya something, every game has meaning. We play for our God, family, the respect of our coaches & teammates, fans, city & the list goes on and on… if you play today, make it count!”Meanwhile, Denver quarterback Wentz is likely to face the Broncos in the playoffs for the first time since winning Super Bowl 50, as Mahomes is set to sit out, revealed in a recent post. Mahomes and his Chiefs became the very first back-to-back Super Bowl champions since Tom Brady's 2004-2005 New England Patriots, and the AFC West franchise is aiming for the very first three-peat, with clinching the No. 1 seed highly benefitting the AFC West franchise.Also Read: Andy Reid remains uncertain about Chiefs starters' availability for Week 18 vs. Broncos, stating he won't disclose plans until he consults with players Chiefs head coach Andy Reid rests starters in meaningless games, ensuring Kansas City is fresh for the Divisional Round of the playoffs on Jan. 18 or 19, a potential 25-day break.

Rohit Sharma press conference: On his batting, captaincy, future, Rishabh Pant’s shot and more

NEW DELHI: As India lost the Boxing Day Test against Australia by 184 runs at the at Melbourne Cricket Ground on Monday, one of the turning points of the match was the dismissal of Rishabh Pant by Travis Head . Mitchell Marsh took a fine catch wide of long-on to dismiss Pant off Head but what followed after that was a unique but absurd celebration by the Aussie all-rounder.That celebration ruffled quite a few Indian feathers but during the post-match press conference, Australia captain Pat Cummins explained the reason behind it when asked by a reporter to clear up what the celebration was about.Cummins said, ""It's his fingers so hot, he's got to put it in a cup of ice. Yeah that's what it is. So that's normally the running joke. But it was at the Gabba or somewhere he got a wicket as well. And just goes straight to the fridge, grabs a bucket of ice, puts his finger in and just walks in front of Lyno (Nathan Lyon). Just like that. Think it's very funny. So that's what it would have been, nothing else.""But former Indian cricketer Navjot Singh Sidhu slammed Head's behaviour calling it an insult to 1.5 billion Indians.Sidhu posted on X: ""Travis head's obnoxious behaviour during the course of the Melbourne test doesn't auger well for for the gentleman's game…… sets the worst possible example when there are kids, women , young & old watching the game……. this caustic conduct did not insult an individual but a nation of 1.5 billion Indians……stringent punishment that would serve a deterrent for the future generations needs to be slapped on him so that no one dares follow suit !!!""India now need to win the last Test of the series, in Sydney, to draw level and retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy .","India lost the Boxing Day Test against Australia by 184 runs at the at Melbourne Cricket Ground.

Travis Hunter’s Mother Silences His Haters



The Trolling Began When Travis Hunter Received The Heisman Trophy



Travis Hunter , the college football star, ended his college football career by losing to the BYU Cougars at the 2024 Alamo Bowl. As he exited the venue, Travis walked hand in hand with his fiancee Leanna Lenee and ignored his fans which sparked widespread criticism, But amidst all the hate he and his fiancee Leanna have received over the last few weeks, his mother has stood by him and now has sent a powerful message to all his haters.Travis Hunter’s mother, Ferrante Edmonds, recently posted a picture on her Instagram where she is posing with her son on the field. The mother son duo look very excited and happy in the picture that she posted. Travis Hunter’s mother’s caption reads as, “I love you, baby @db3_tip, on to the next level. I’m so proud of you.”While Travis’ mother has plenty of things to be proud of her extremely talented son, the timing of this post makes it all the more special. In a way, it looks like Travis’ mother sends a message to all his haters that she stands by him no matter what happens. Many fans appreciated this gesture of hers as one wrote, “We are proud of him so I know as his mother you are extremely proud. Let’s go Travis!!! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾”. Another fan complimented her and how she has brought up her son by saying, “You are a great mom who has instilled integrity and humility and Travis. Proud of him and proud of you!”This is also not the first way that Travis’ mother, Ferrante Edmonds, has openly declared her support for him. While Travis has been getting a massive amount of hate in the last couple of weeks, his mother posted a picture with Travis and her younger son Trayvis from the Heisman Trophy night with a caption that read as, “I fight my battles in the Spiritual Realm not in the Natural. Everything that is said don’t need to be addressed. If I’m Silent Best Believe I’m Praying. #ThisIsHowIFightMyBattles🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾 #PrayingMother 🙏🏾”While Travis’ mother has not specifically addressed any issues, it is safe to assume she is referring to the controversy surrounding Travis’ fiancee Leanna and the trolling they have received as a couple.Coincidentally, all the trolling began on the day that was supposed to be a highly memorable day for Travis; the day he became the recipient of the prestigious Heisman Trophy. His fiancee Leanna did not stand up for him and moved only when his coach, Deion Sanders nudged him to stand up.This video quickly went viral shocking fans at this gesture of Leanna’s and left many fans questioning her love for Travis. Both Travis and Leanna have issued statements regarding this but nothing has helped.Also Read: Buffalo Bills' Josh Allen's fiancée Hailee Steinfeld’s thoughts on the “timing of life” may hold a deeper meaning about their engagement","Travis Hunter’s mother, Ferrante Edmonds, recently posted a picture on her Instagram where she is posing with her son on the field.

Taylor Swift Did Not Sell The Maximum Tickets In Australia



Travis Kelce And Taylor Swift Are Currently Relaxing In New York City



The NFL star and the quarterback of the Kansas City Chiefs, Travis Kelce is currently dating the most popular global pop star, Taylor Swift . While Taylor’s legendary Eras Tour generated a revenue of $2.2 billion, it turns out another artist in Australia sold more tickets (across Australia) than Taylor. This is none other than the popular pop star, Pink who is also known by her real name Alicia Moore.However, things were not easy for Pink when global pop star Taylor was performing in Australia. Even though Pink sold many more tickets than Taylor, Australian media was busy promoting and talking about Beyonce and Taylor’s tour rather than hers. As per Sam Fischer's interview on Nova’s Ricki-Lee, Tim & Joel, he said, “I have a friend who's Pink's background singer and my friend Danny said she's really just pi**ed off no one's talking about the fact that she's also selling out stadiums.”Pink sold out stadiums and yet no media promoted it that much. Pink had expressed gratitude to her audience and as per Daily Mail, Pink has also spoken about how she has the record for the maximum number of ticket sales held by a female artist who has performed in Australia.Pink has been performing in Australia for the last twenty years of her life and Michael Coppel of the Live Nation Australasia spoke to the Herald Sun about this. He said, “There is a palpable mutual love affair between the Australasian audience that love seeing her perform live, and an artist who clearly loves being here. Congratulations, Alecia, on yet another stunning record-breaking tour.”While it is unfortunate that Pink did not get as much media attention as Taylor did but Taylor herself has broken several records through the Eras Tour. With a revenue of $2.2 billion, her tour became the second most attended concert in the world, just a close second to Coldplay’s “Music of the Sphere.”In Australia itself, Travis’ girlfriend Taylor managed to sell 600,000 tickets. Taylor travelled the world for it and visited each continent for her Eras tour. Finally, Taylor managed to wrap up her Eras tour on 8th December after her final performance in Canada.Currently, Taylor has not announced any new project of hers and is enjoying her break in New York City with her boyfriend, Travis Kelce. Taylor has been spotted going out and about in the Big Apple, hand in hand with her boyfriend. She has recently been spotted on a date night and while celebrating her best friend’s birthday and fans cannot get enough of the two.While Travis is yet to enter the playoffs with his team next month, there has been no official statement from Taylor about her next project.Also Read: Buffalo Bills' Josh Allen’s fiancée Hailee Steinfeld becomes a part of the Bills’ family through a special gift","Pink sold out stadiums and yet no media promoted it that much.

NEW DELHI: The clamour of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli exiting Test cricket grew after the veteran batters endured another failure, resulting in India's crushing 184-run loss in the Boxing Day Test against Australia at the MCG on Monday.However, former India batter Sanjay Manjrekar voiced his support for Kohli, stating that the former Indian captain deserves a longer run in Test cricket. He also emphasised that comparisons between Rohit and Kohli are unwarranted.""I must say there is no comparison between Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli as Test batters. Virat Kohli is right up there. He's a great Test batter, and Rohit Sharma is a good Test batter. Rohit's white-ball batting great,"" Manjrekar said on Star Sports.""So Virat Kohli obviously deserves a longer rope. It's not so much about Virat Kohli. I want to know what the batting coach of India is doing. We can't solve the obvious problem of such a fine player. Enough has been said about Virat Kohli, we just have to leave him alone,"" he added.Manjrekar also remarked that Rohit old has the ability to make decisions in the best interest of Indian cricket, noting that he seems to be in the ""doldrums'.""It's not really up to Rohit Sharma. If you look at how the protocol and the hierarchy of team selection is, the chairman of selectors, he has the decision to make. He has the power to do what's best for Indian cricket, so it's not so much about Rohit Sharma himself, you know, deciding what should be the future,"" said Manjrekar.""The chairman of the selector has that power. That's with Rohit and he does look down in the doldrums. Virat Kohli is a different issue altogether,"" he added.Chasing a daunting target of 340, Rohit Sharma (9 off 40 balls) and Virat Kohli (5) struggled to overcome their technical flaws and mental hurdles, as India collapsed spectacularly, losing seven wickets for 34 runs in just 20.4 overs during the final session, eventually being bowled out for 155 in 79.1 overs.Australia took a 2-1 advantage ahead of the fifth and final Test which is scheduled to start on January 3 at the Sydney Cricket Ground.","Former India batter Sanjay Manjrekar says Virat Kohli deserves a longer run in Test cricket.

India's dismal show in the second innings of the fourth Test against Australia in Melbourne has been criticised by former players and experts, especially for the batting unit's failure to learn from mistakes -- highlighted by Rishabh Pant 's poor shot-selection that became the turning point of the match when there was just a session left to play out for a draw.The top order wore a changed look with Rohit Sharma returning to open, KL Rahul dropping to No.3 and Shubman Gill left out of the eleven. But the result didn't change as India's specialist batters, barring opener Yashasvi Jaiswal's twin half-centuries, continued to disappoint.Analysing India's 184-run defeat on Monday, former Pakistan batter Basit Ali qustioned the role of chief coach Gautam Gambhir and his staff.""Shabash hai Gautam Gambhir saab ko. One-day mei to bada left-right combination kar rahe the. Aaj bhejna tha No. 6 pe Nitish (Reddy) ko. Chahe woh jaldi out ho jata, pata toh chalta kuchh kiya aapne, (congratulations to Gambhir; he keeps advocating for left-right combination in one-day cricket, should have sent Nitish at No. 6; even if he had failed, it would have showed the coach tried something),"" said Basit.""Pata nahi kaun batting coach hai jisko yeh nahi pata ki kis tarah survive kiya jata hai aur kis bowler ko kis tarah khela jata hai (I dont know who is the bating coach who can't advise on how to survive and how to play a particular bowler),"" he continued.He also mooted the idea of India having format-specific coaches.""This is the time for India to appoint separate coaches for white ball and red ball. If they don't do it, the team will dip further,"" Basit reckoned.India were bowled out for 155 in their second innings, losing their last seven wickets for 34 runs. The batting collapse was triggered by a poor shot from wickekteeper-batter Rishabh Pant (30), who fell into a trap set by Australia captain Pat Cummins.With the partnership between Jaiswal and Pant reaching 88, Cummins brought on part-time spinner Travis Head in hope of Pant going after him. It happened exactly that way, and Pant got out playing an irresponsible shot, which gave Australia the opportunity they were looking for.""Boht hi bekar cricket kheli (very poor cricket),"" said Basit.""Brilliant planning by Australia. They didnt't give up and believed in themselves.""That's the difference between batters of the '90s and those who came after 2010. The ones from the '80s and '90s could understand the opposition's plan quickly, that this player has come on to buy a wicket -- the way Head came on. A player from the past would not have got out; even if he played a shot, it would have been a grounded one.""""Rishabh Pant ne wohi bewakoofi kari. Chhakka marne gaye. Kya hua? Kisko nuksaan hua? Mulk ko aur team ko (Pant did a foolish thing, went for a six. What happeed? Who suffered? His country and his team),"" Basit analysed.""That shot changed the entired match. Upar wale ne yeh (pointing at his head) diya hai na, isko use karte hain (God has given you the brain, it should be used).""The win gave Australia a 2-1 lead heading into the final Test in Sydney, beginning January 3.","India were bowled out for 155 in their second innings, losing their last seven wickets for 34 runs.

NEW DELHI: Former India head coach Ravi Shastri advocates for a two-tiered Test cricket system. He believes this is crucial for the format's survival, especially considering the growing popularity of T20 cricket. His comments follow the record-breaking attendance at the recent India-Australia Test match in Melbourne.The match attracted a staggering 373,691 spectators, surpassing the previous record of 350,534 set during the 1936-37 Ashes series.""To break crowd records that have stood for nearly a century... is testimony to the fact that when the best teams play, the toughest and best format of the game is still alive and thriving,"" Shastri said in a column for The Australian newspaper.He noted the impressive attendance figures demonstrate the format's relevance in the modern cricketing landscape.""It was also a sound reminder to the ICC that the best should play the best for Test cricket to survive. I will say that there's too much of a clutter otherwise,"" he said.Shastri argues that the International Cricket Council (ICC) should prioritize scheduling matches between the highest-ranked teams. This strategy, he believes, is essential for Test cricket’s continued existence. He feels that an excessive number of matches between mismatched teams dilutes the quality and appeal of the format.The 62-year-old proposes a two-tier system comprising the top 6-8 teams with promotion and relegation mechanisms. This structure, he contends, would ensure a consistently high level of competition.""You will not get these kinds of crowds if you don't have two proper teams playing,"" he added.Shastri also champions the preservation of the traditional five-day Test match format. This format has faced recent scrutiny, with some suggesting a reduction to four days.""The theatre in the end on [day five] Monday was further proof of why we need five days for a classic Test match,"" he pointed out.He points to the dramatic conclusion of the Melbourne Test as evidence of the value of the five-day format. He argues that it allows for compelling narratives to unfold and provides ample opportunity for exciting finishes.However, Shastri cautions that without a two-tier system, Test cricket risks a proliferation of mismatched contests. This, he warns, could diminish the quality of the game and alienate fans.""If you don't create a two-tier system, you'll continue to have unmatched teams up against each other and then it's very unlikely they'll be able to take a game into the fifth day. Then there'll always be talk of four-day Tests.""He suggests that if matches regularly fail to reach the fifth day due to one-sided contests, the argument for shortening the format will gain traction. He believes that this would be detrimental to the long-term health of Test cricket.","Ravi Shastri advocates for a two-tiered Test cricket system.

Stadium Walkthrough series: Inside The Gabba

NEW DELHI: Former England captain Kevin Pietersen has expressed his dissatisfaction with the World Test Championship (WTC) qualification process after South Africa made the final with their latest win in Tests over Pakistan.South Africa’s qualification for the 2025 WTC Final , despite playing only 11 matches during the 2023-25 cycle, has stirred debate.England, who played a demanding 22 matches, sit sixth despite winning 11 games - the highest by any team - due to the way Points Percentage (PCT) is calculated.Taking to social media platform X, Pietersen defended South Africa against criticism for their qualification, pointing instead at the structural flaws in the tournament framework."" Cricket South Africa didn’t create the FTP for their WTC qualification, so criticising them for qualification isn’t fair. You play the cards you get dealt. The qualification process is the issue and I’m sure it’s something Jay Shah will fix,"" he wrote, urging theICC Chairman to address the apparent inequality.Under the current system, PCT determines standings by dividing a team’s earned points by the maximum points available from matches played.While it incentivises consistent performance, disparities in the number of fixtures unfairly penalise teams with heavier schedules.England, for instance, played twice the matches South Africa did. This broader schedule naturally exposed them to a greater risk of point loss, leading to their exclusion from the final despite notable performances.The disparity extends across the table, with Australia (16 matches) and India (18 matches) rounding out the top three, while teams like Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, who play fewer matches, remain competitive largely because they face less fixture fatigue.Critics, including Pietersen, argue this creates an uneven playing field and compromises the credibility of the final standings.As the June 11 final approaches, the debate over the WTC’s structure calls for urgent reform.","Kevin Pietersen has expressed his dissatisfaction with the World Test Championship qualification process.

HOW THE STATE FARED THROUGH THE YEAR 2024

BELOW-PAR SHOW BY CSK

ASHWIN LEAVES THE STAGE

DRIVING THROUGH THE NIGHT

PARALYMPIANS BRING THE SMILES BACK

It was the turn of the century when Viswanathan Anand became the world champion for the first time. He ruled the chess world for more than a decade, and now, in 2024, India has produced a second world champion — D Gukesh . In these years, the country has become a powerhouse of 64 squares — a la USSR of the 1900s — and the epicentre of this chess revolution in India that Garry Kasparov and Magnus Carlsen had predicted — is Chennai.Anand’s success was the catalyst.What began as a ripple evolved into a wave, transforming Chennai from a quiet chess hub into a city that consistently produces top-tier talent. Chess boards became a common sight in schools and summer camps, tournaments flourished, and a generation of players emerged from academies. Today, Tamil Nadu , with its 31 GMs, has become the beating heart of the chess scene in India, which boasts of 85 GMs.This chess boom, though, didn’t happen overnight. Anand’s rise to prominence was pivotal, but it was the growing respect for chess within the state that truly fuelled the game’s explosion.During an interaction facilitated by the West-Bridge Anand Chess Academy (WACA), one of the prime promoters of chess in India, co-founder and five-time world champion Anand, told TOI: “TN has always taken chess seriously and the culture here respects it. When I became the first GM, several followed. I’m sure becoming world champion has motivated many to start playing. I think I was a catalyst for getting chess a lot more attention in the beginning.”As the chess community in Chennai expanded, so did its network of support. Coaches such as R B Ramesh, M Shyam Sundar and V Vishnu Prasanna played a pivotal role in shaping the city’s growing chess culture. Their academies became breeding grounds for young talent, while the surge of local tournaments helped hone the skills of many emerging stars.“Chess has become more popular, appreciated, recognised and visible,” says Ramesh, who has shaped the careers of many at his Chess Gurukul academy. “When we were young, we didn’t feel we could compete at an international level. But now, children dream of becoming world champions.”Another institution making waves in the chess world is WACA with Gukesh as one of its shining stars. “We’re constantly looking for new talent, younger players who can replicate Gukesh’s success,” says co-founder Sandeep Singhal.The growth of this ecosystem isn’t just measured in titles and trophies; it’s reflected in the stories of players such as Gukesh, R Praggnanandhaa and R Vaishali, all students of Velammal Vidyalaya, which has produced 20 GMs. It’s a school that stood by these talented players. Before this year’s Candidates tournament — the qualifier for the World Chess Championship final — it’s this ‘chess factory’ that arranged funds so Gukesh could have a super computer, which is crucial for preparation.While Gukesh is currently the toast of the town, Pragg, with his early successes, kept the flag flying as Anand was slowly taking a step back after years of domination. And it’s Pragg’s sister Vaishali who stood tall among the world’s top women players — both were a part of the historic gold winning Chess Olympiad 2024 teams. But it’s not just the teenagers. This year, 32-year-old P Shyaam Nikhil (from Nagercoil) became a GM after an excruciating wait of 12 years for his final norm.It wasn’t just a series of individual triumphs that fuelled this upswing. The 2022 Chess Olympiad in Chennai, became a landmark event that showcased the city’s prowess. The Chennai Chess Grand Masters tournament, inaugurated last year and now set to be an annual event, became a crucial stepping stone to the World Championship for Gukesh .“The event directly contributed to Gukesh qualifying for the Candidates, where he won and went on to challenge for the crown,” says Anand. “The event gave young players a platform to compete alongside the best players.” If Anand was the spark that ignited chess in India, Gukesh is the flame, burning brightly and showing the way for a new generation. “When I saw Anand becoming a Grandmaster in 1989, I took up chess to beome one. Now, everyone will be taking inspiration from Gukesh,” says Ramesh. “The young generation has more role models to look up to, we had only one.”Gukesh had told TOI there’s healthy rivalry amongst him and his peers. “One’s success drives the others. Chennai has been a chess hub for a long time, but good results at the top level are becoming more frequent, which is encouraging.” With Gukesh’s remarkable ascent and Pragg’s persistence, the prospect of a World Championship showdown between the two is no longer a distant dream. And when that happens, we can truly say Chennai has become the new Moscow of world chess.D Gukesh becoming the world champion was the highlight for the city sports fraternity, which otherwise had a middling year. TOI takes a look at the major sports happenings throughout the year.| Chennai Super Kings were not at their usual best, failing to make the last-four stage of the Indian Premier League (IPL). M S Dhoni missed a chance to play his farewell match in Chennai, but he returns to IPL this year too as an ‘uncapped’ player as the new-look CSK hope to put up a formidable fight.| India’s ace off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin shocked the world by calling time on his glittering 14year international career. He announced his retirement after the third Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia at Gabba in Brisbane. The 38-year-old took 765 international wickets across all formats.

Rahane to miss league stage of Vijay Hazare Trophy

Mumbai opener Ayush Mhatre etched his name in the history books with a record-breaking performance when he became the youngest player to register a 150+ score in a List A game while starring in his side's 189-run win over Nagaland in a Vijay Hazare Trophy Group C match at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Tuesday.Aged all of just 17 years and 168 days, Mhatre smashed a 117-ball 181 to eclipse the record previously held by another Mumbai batsman, Yashasvi Jaiswal , who accumulated 203 against Jharkhand in the 2019 Vijay Hazare Trophy when he was enjoying his breakout domestic season aged just 17 years and 291 days old.Feasting on a below par Nagaland attack, the Virar lad unleashed 15 fours and 11 sixes as he powered Mumbai to a mammoth total of 403 for seven in 50 overs. Mhatre stitched a 156-run opening stand alongside Angkrish Raghuvansi, who scored 56. The youngster was then involved in a 50-run stand with Siddhesh Lad (39), before allrounder and stand-in captain Shardul Thakur (regular captain Shreyas Iyer was rested) showed his batting prowess in a fiery 28-ball 73 not out (strike rate 260.71).In reply for Nagaland, their 'pro' Jagadeesha Suchith scored a century (104, 97b, 7x4, 4x6), while Sedezhalie Rupero laboured to a half century (53 off 110 balls), as Naga land finished at 214 for nine in 50 overs, with Thakur taking three for 17 in five overs. Mhatre had earlier scored 78 off 82 balls against Karnataka.Meanwhile, on a ""break"", senior batter Ajinkya Rahane will miss the league stage of the Vijay Hazare Trophy. Rahane hasn't featured in any of the games in the tournament so far and will miss the last two matches too. ""Rahane has requested for a break but has assured us that he will be available for the knockouts,"" Mumbai Cricket Association secretary Abhay Hadap told TOI.Having lost to Punjab and Karnataka, Mumbai are placed third in Group C with 12 points in five matches. With just two matches left now, they only have slim hopes of qualifying for the knockouts.Brief Scores: Mumbai: 403-7 in 50 overs (Angkrish Raghivanshi 56, Ayush Mhatre 181, Siddhesh Lad 39, Prasad Pawar 38, Shardul Thakur 73; Dip Borah 3-87) bt Nagaland 214-9 in 50 overs (Sedezhaile Rupero 53, J Suchith 104; Shardul Thakur 3-17, Royston Dias 2-44, Suryansh Shedge 2-25) by 189 runs",Ayush Mhatre becomes youngest player to score 150-plus in List A game.

As the match ended, cricket memes went viral on social media platforms. Here are some of the viral memes that just capture the emotion/sadness of Indian Cricket fans.

Record number of spectators

Australia clinched a thrilling 184-run victory over India in a dramatic final session of the fourth Test in Melbourne, taking a 2-1 lead in the five-match series. India, needing 340 to win, collapsed to 155 all out, losing their last seven wickets for just 34 runs in 20.3 overs. India appeared to be heading for a draw after Yashasvi Jaiswal (84) and Rishabh Pant (30) steered them to 112-3 at tea.However, Pant's dismissal, attempting a six off Travis Head, triggered a batting collapse.Controversy arose with Jaiswal's dismissal. Initially given not out to a caught-behind appeal, the TV umpire overturned the decision based on visual evidence of the ball changing direction, despite the absence of audible noise. Jasprit Bumrah was exceptional for India, taking 5-57 in the second innings and nine wickets in the match. He had reduced Australia to 91-6 at one stage, a lead of less than 200.The match set a record attendance for cricket in Australia, with 373,591 spectators. Head described the atmosphere as inspiring and hailed the match as one of the best he has been involved in.

In Indian cricket, sentimental retirements have often masked larger issues of selection & form. Superstars have usually extended playing careers and scripted their own exits. For India's captain, however, retirement talk is gathering steam ahead of the Sydney Test. For

, too, holding on to his spot looks increasingly difficult with each failure. Only one may be left standing after the final Test of this tour

Poll Who is your favorite Indian cricket captain of the modern era? Virat Kohli Rohit Sharma

Rohit Sharma press conference: On his batting, captaincy, future, Rishabh Pant’s shot and more

MELBOURNE: Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli aren't cut from the same cloth, but their careers are definitely fraying at the edges at the same time.With every predictable dismissal, the end is looming. It's not here yet. Maybe tomorrow. Or perhaps the day after. It must be an infuriating wait for these two declining stalwarts.Rumours are swirling as the caravan prepares to enter Sydney for the last stop on the Border-Gavaskar Trophy tour. Perhaps captain Rohit, the lesser of the two Test batsmen, will have his head on the chopping block first. If India don't make the World Test Championship final, Sydney, it is being presumed, could be Rohit's final port of call, a last chance to sign off with a hurrah.Kohli's may be a longer wait. A modern Test great, he still has time if he so chooses. Kohli still looks the part in patches, though the mind seems scrambled. It's getting easier and easier for opposition bowlers to plan his dismissals. Or, perhaps, there will be redemption round the corner, a Steve Smith-like turnaround, and a few more great knocks to add to the lore? The temptation to linger on is irresistible.Of course, a Rohit retirement now would be extremely convenient for the Ajit Agarkar-led selection committee. Celebrity worship and brand recognition is so deeply entrenched in Indian cricket's cloak-and-dagger management style that coaches and selectors struggle to make the tough calls.Even now, with the series on the line, the chatter - no doubt fuelled by whispers from within the machine - is always about 'retirement', never about performance. Indian cricket's super stars, apart from one or two exceptions, have never shared a healthy relationship with being dropped, or with the dreaded 'R' word.For selectors, too, 'retirement' makes it easier. The call appears to be voluntary. Just look at the way Ravichandran Ashwin bid goodbye in Brisbane.The talk should instead be about holding on to one's spot. Retirement, irrespective of age, is a personal thing and not the issue here. If a player doesn't perform, he cannot keep his place. Great players get a longer rope, but it still runs out at some point. What he subsequently decides to do with his playing career - retire or keep playing - is his own call to make. Whether to pick him or not is the call of the selectors and the coach, if he has a say in such matters.Unfortunately, that isn't how Indian cricket, or even its rabid fans, function. There are two ways to look at the Rohit problem which has dogged the team since the pink-ball Test in Adelaide. Going by performance benchmarks alone, his spot in the playing XI in Sydney shouldn't be a guarantee, even if he is the captain or it turns out to be his last Test with the Indian team. Ashwin, after all, didn't play in Brisbane.Rohit's problem isn't limited to Australian soil. He averages 24.76 from 26 innings in 2024. This includes two hundreds and two half-centuries. In India's last five defeats, he averages 11.20 from 10 innings. His last 11 Test innings have brought him returns of 2 and 52, 0 and 8, 18 and 11 (all vs New Zealand at home), 3, 6, 10, 3, 9 (all in Australia on this tour).Even as captain, his overseas record is middling. He has led in eight overseas Tests, losing four, winning two and drawing two. In these Tests, with the bat Rohit averages 29.92, which includes that magnificent 127 at the Oval. Before arriving here, India were whitewashed at home by New Zealand, an unthinkable blow. India have now lost five Tests under Rohit this season, equalling Sachin Tendulkar 's record from 1999-2000.Numbers, though, aren't everything when it comes to batsmen of pedigree. Rohit just hasn't looked like his old self out there in the middle. In Adelaide he took a blow for the team, shifting to the middle order from his regular opening slot since KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jasiwal had just engineered a Test win in Perth along with Jasprit Bumrah The move didn't work and at the MCG he batted better after returning as opener, though the runs still didn't come. In the first innings he was caught in two minds playing his favourite pull shot. In the second he stood firm with a Test to save, and some of that laidback swagger looked like returning when he perished trying to play an attacking shot.The other way is to treat it as an issue of form. While it's easy to gauge from the numbers - he has 164 runs in 15 innings this season, starting with the Tests against Bangladesh - that Rohit has had a horror run, it's been only four months or so, from September 19 (start of the Chennai Test against Bangladesh) till the end of the year. Some famous batters have been known to nurse poor form for far longer. So why talk of retirement and not form, even though Rohit is inching towards 38 years of age?Either way you look at it, Rohit's selection in Sydney shouldn't be an automatic choice. Kohli is in a similar bind but with a significant difference. With Kohli, the numbers make for equally dreary reading - he averages 24.52 this year - but he is at a superior level compared to Rohit as a Test batsman. The debate is different.Plus, he has a century in Perth on this tour, the one time he got to bat against the older Kookaburra ball. He has shown self-restraint. The first-innings 36 from 86 balls at the MCG was a small but significant knock which earned praise from the likes of Smith.Kohli's problem has been both technical - a tendency to reach out and drive at deliveries on the fifth or sixth stump line with askew footwork - and mental, motivated by the urgency to score some quick runs, since the runs aren't coming. The two are linked.Kohli too, has been in a long, gradual decline since the first Covid-enforced break. There could still be some gas left in the tank. Kohli may still have a prolific season or two in him. However, on current form, does he deserve to keep his place? Who can replace him at No. 4 in the present squad? These are questions the team management has to answer.As for Rohit, is this the end of the line? Sydney will provide.","Retirement talk is gathering steam ahead of the Sydney Test. For India's captain, too, holding on to his spot looks increasingly difficult. Only one may be left standing after the final Test of this tour of Australia. Rohit Sharma averages 24.76 from 26 innings in 2024.

Pat Cummins reveals Australia's XI for Boxing Day Test

NEW DELHI: Melbourne witnessed high-octane cricket and heated moments during the Boxing Day Test at the MCG, where Virat Kohli 's shoulder bump incident with Australian debutant Sam Konstas became a major talking point.Konstas, in his very first Test appearance, stunned the cricketing world with a fearless display against India's premier pacer Jasprit Bumrah . The young batter executed a daring ramp shot for six over wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant’s head, leaving the Indian team momentarily stunned.However, tensions boiled over at the end of the 10th over when Kohli brushed shoulders with Konstas. The heated exchange that followed saw Usman Khawaja step in to diffuse the situation.Former Australia captain Michael Clarke weighed in on the incident, suggesting Kohli’s reaction stemmed from frustration at the respect - or lack thereof - shown to Bumrah.""Virat is such a tough player. He will not take a backward step and never has throughout his whole career. I think Virat was getting frustrated with the lack of respect that Sam was showing as the best bowler in the world in Bumrah,"" Clarke remarked on the Beyond 23 Cricket Podcast.Despite the fiery exchange, Clarke defended Kohli's character, adding, ""I am sure he would have spoken to Sam after the game. Virat is a great guy. He is not a nasty person. I think it was Virat sticking up for his team.""Konstas went on to score an impressive 60 off 65 deliveries, including six fours and two sixes, before falling to Ravindra Jadeja. Australia secured a commanding 184-run victory, taking a 2-1 lead in the series.In the same game, another Indian star emerged - Nitish Kumar Reddy , whose maiden Test century came at a critical juncture for India. Clarke praised the 21-year-old all-rounder, calling him a ""genius"" and advocating for his promotion in the batting order. ""He has not feared any Australian bowler. He bats, bowls, and fields. This guy is a very good find for the Indian cricket team,"" Clarke added.","Virat Kohli's shoulder bump with Australian debutant Sam Konstas became a major talking point.

NEW DELHI: Indian captain Rohit Sharma 's clarification that Shubman Gill was not dropped for the Boxing Day Test against Australia did not sit well with legendary Sunil Gavaskar , who asserted that the decision could only be described as a drop.The decision to drop Gill and accommodate all-rounder Washington Sundar, aimed at strengthening the lower middle-order batting depth, drew criticism.However, Rohit clarified that the choice was not made solely by him.""Look, I had a chat with him. There's no way when you're leaving someone out, for whatever reason it is, you will have a chat. And the chat with him was clear that he was not dropped. We just wanted to have that extra bit of cushion in the bowling,"" Rohit said.""Hence, we opted for an all-rounder, which shouldn't weaken our batting line-up. Compromising a batter for a bowler was not something that I wanted to do.Gavaskar did mince his words when he was asked for his opinion during a discussion on Star Sports on Rohit's statement during the post-match press conference""How much bowling did you give to Washington Sundar? What cushion are you talking about? The requirement of the team is perfectly fine. You need to take decisions based on that, but you left him (Gill) out of the team, you can only call it dropped in whichever language you might speak,"" Gavaskar said.""You can say you omitted or dropped him, both are the same. Omit looks different, drop looks different, and left out looks different. I am talking about English but in the end, that guy was sitting in the dugout and was not on the ground,"" he added.Sundar bowled just 19 overs in the match, taking one wicket across two innings. With the bat, he contributed a responsible 50-run knock in India's first innings and remained unbeaten on five in the second.Chasing a target of 340 on the final day of the fourth Test, the Indian batters struggled once again, with only Yashasvi Jaiswal (84) standing out. The team fell short by 184 runs, resulting in a defeat and trailing 1-2 in the five-match series.",Shubman Gill was dropped by India for the fourth Test against Australia. Captain Rohit Sharma said the decision was not made solely by him. Sunil Gavaskar said that the decision could only be described as a drop.

'ROHIT KNEW YASHASVI WAS INDIA’S FUTURE'

NEW DELHI: Disappointment and frustration were clearly visible on Yashasvi Jaiswal 's face as he fell victim to a controversial dismissal during the final session of day five in the Boxing Day Test at the MCG. The third umpire overturned the on-field not-out decision for a caught-behind, even though the Snickometer showed no edge.Yashasvi, who was anchoring the innings brilliantly and batting on 84, attempted to hook a bouncer from Australian skipper Pat Cummins . He missed the shot entirely, and wicketkeeper Alex Carey claimed the catch.While Carey and Cummins celebrated exuberantly, on-field umpire Joel Wilson initially ruled it not out. Cummins, however, immediately opted for a review.The Snickometer displayed a flat line as the ball passed the bat, regular replays showed a noticeable deflection. Third umpire Sharfuddoula ultimately declared Jaiswal out, to the batter’s disbelief.The decision sparked widespread debate among former cricketers and fans alike. However, Indian skipper Rohit Sharma addressed the controversy during the post-match press conference, seeking to put the matter to rest.""I don't know what to make of that because the technology didn't show anything, but with the naked eye it seemed like he did touch something,"" Rohit told reporters after the match.""I don't know how the umpires want to use the technology, but in all fairness, I think he did touch the ball,"" he said.Yashasvi's childhood coach, Jwala Singh, who was at the MCG to witness the high-stakes match, expressed his shock over the incident but said he found clarity after Rohit addressed the matter.""I was shocked, actually. The umpires took time to make that decision, and there was doubt. So, if there was doubt, the benefit of doubt should have been given to the batter. But if Rohit Sharma, the captain himself, said that there was a deflection or that the ball touched the bat or gloves, then Yashasvi is out. Because the captain knows better than anyone else. I will go with Rohit,"" Jwala told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview.Jwala is well aware of Yashasvi's state of mind following the controversial dismissal but remains confident that Rohit, who has been a guiding figure throughout Yashasvi's career as a senior Mumbai teammate and now as India’s captain, will support the youngster through this challenging phase.""Rohit has given him a lot of opportunities and chances. Rohit has backed Yashasvi a lot. He has been his senior in the Mumbai team, and now he is the captain. Yashasvi has learned a lot from Rohit and continues to do so. Yashasvi was very disappointed, and any batter would be disappointed after such a decision. He needs to move on. Rohit will talk to him. Whenever Yashasvi is down or disappointed, Rohit is always there to motivate him and talk to him. He will ask him to move on. Not just Rohit, (Gautam) Gambhir also talks to him and motivates him. Rohit and Gambhir will help Yashasvi overcome this on-field disappointment,"" Jwala said.Yashasvi has been a standout performer in Tests in 2024, amassing 1,478 runs at an average of 54.74, including three centuries and nine fifties in 15 matches (including the MCG Test). His highest score this year was an unbeaten 214 against England.The youngster also surpassed Virender Sehwag’s 2008 tally of 1,462 runs to record the best calendar year for an Indian opener. He now ranks fourth on the all-time list for openers, topped by Graeme Smith’s 1,656 runs in 2008.Jwala recounted a story where Rohit had predicted Yashasvi's bright future for India.""I will share an incident when Yashasvi scored a double century in the Vijay Hazare Trophy some years back. Rohit was present there, and he appreciated Yashasvi and told everyone that this guy has got a bright future and will play for India. Yashasvi became emotional and worked really hard to reach this level. Rohit has always given Yashasvi a lot of support and helped him grow as an international cricketer,"" the coach said.""Yashasvi is a player to watch out for in the future. He was looking good, and I was confident he would take India to a draw or maybe even a win if he had good support from the other end. He was in good touch, but the controversial decision ended his innings. I am happy for him but also unhappy because he missed out on hundreds in both innings. He had a great opportunity to score centuries in both innings,"" he added.",Yashasvi Jaiswal was out for 84 on Day 5 of the Boxing Day Test at the MCG. The third umpire overturned the on-field not-out decision for a caught-behind.

NEW DELHI: Former Indian cricketer Irfan Pathan has offered a blunt critique of Virat Kohli 's recent performances, particularly his persistent issues with shots outside the off-stump. Speaking on Star Sports after India's heavy 184-run defeat to Australia in the Boxing Day Test, Pathan highlighted Kohli's struggles as a key factor in India's underwhelming display.""Both the seniors (Rohit and Virat) did not meet expectations.They did not meet their own expectations at all. They are making mistakes,"" Pathan said, addressing the form of both Kohli and skipper Rohit Sharma Focusing on Kohli's long-standing tendency to chase deliveries outside the off-stump, Pathan expressed frustration over the lack of correction in the batter's technique.""The shot by Virat Kohli - this is neither the first nor the last time. He is not letting go of the temptation to drive outside the off-stump,"" Pathan remarked, adding that the issue has plagued Kohli for years.Pathan also questioned why Kohli, renowned for his off-field discipline and meticulous preparation, has struggled to bring the same focus to his batting.""We all talk about his discipline - why can't he bring that discipline onto the field?"" Pathan asked, highlighting a puzzling inconsistency in Kohli's approach.Kohli's scores of 36 and 5 in the first and second innings, respectively, were emblematic of India's broader batting failures as they fell to a 2-1 series deficit in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy .With just one Test remaining in Sydney, India face an uphill task to reclaim the series and maintain hopes of qualifying for the ICC World Test Championship Final.",Former Indian cricketer Irfan Pathan criticises Virat Kohli's recent performances.

Rohit Sharma: 'Virat Kohli is a modern day great. He will figure it out'

Rohit Sharma hit on knee during nets session at MCG

Melbourne: The number of runs Rohit Sharma has scored in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy (BGT) so far is one more than the number of wickets (30) Jasprit Bumrah has picked since landing in Australia last month. Three Tests, five innings, 31 runs. That's all Rohit has managed in the ongoing series, and barely has he managed to take his runs tally ahead of Bumrah's 30 wickets.While the statistic is good for the laughs and social media memes, on a serious note it is a sorry reflection of Rohit the batter. Not that he has come across as a tactically sound and proactive Test captain, but the extended lean patch has clearly and further deteriorated his decision-making.Rain saved India in Brisbane but proper five days of Test cricket at the MCG has served another stern reminder of why the Indian captain's time is up in the whites. While there are murmurs of conversations with BCCI top brass and selectors over retirement, it's understood that Rohit has already made up his mind.When and where the announcement happens is anybody's guess but it's highly unlikely that the Indian captain will continue after the BGT. Rohit would undoubtedly like to convince selectors to allow him to stay for the World Test Championship (WTC) final, should India pull off a miracle and make it there. However, if they don't, Sydney is destined to be Rohit's last dance.That bit is absolutely clear and selectors are already in the know of what's approaching. However, the bigger question at this stage is not about retirement but whether Rohit deserves to be in the Playing XI at all?The runs aren't coming. Even after a decent series vs England at home, the Test average in 2024 has been in the mid 20s and he has only scored two centuries and two half-centuries in the 14 Tests he has played.619 runs in 14 Tests would have pushed any batter out of the setup but Rohit, because of captaincy and reputation, has managed to hang on longer than he should have.Apart from the lack of runs, the experiments in Melbourne -- Rohit at top, KL Rahul at No. 3 and Shubman Gill on the bench -- did more harm than good and it's just delaying the transition and opportunities to the next generation of superstars.If you play Rohit in Sydney, the same batting order is likely to continue and it would mean Shubman Gill returns home after playing just three innings -- two of which had fluent starts. And KL Rahul continues to do something which he hasn't done often in his career -- bat at No.3.Australia have seen numerous Test retirements in the past but for India, more important than the retirement is the smooth transition. Many moons ago, MS Dhoni, a visionary leader, did just that when he retired midway through the series and handed over the reins to Virat Kohli.Will Rohit follow suit or wait for the ""why nots"" to get louder?",Rohit Sharma has scored 31 runs in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy (BGT) so far. That's one more than the number of wickets (30) Jasprit Bumrah has picked since landing in Australia last month.

Getting physically fit and mentally ready for ILT20: MI Emirates skipper Nicholas Pooran

NEW DELHI: UAE off-spinning all-rounder Dhruv Parashar is aiming to present himself as a viable option to bowl in the powerplay overs for the Desert Vipers team in the upcoming ILT20 Season 3.With 12 out of his 18 senior international appearances involving bowling in the powerplays, Parashar has a credible case to make for this role.Parashar's approach to bowling in the powerplay is focused on bowling according to his field and forcing the batter to hit where he wants them to.He developed this method during his time as a net bowler with the Vipers in the previous season, where he had the opportunity to work with new balls and refine his skills.“I enjoy the challenge because there are not many spinners that bowl in the power play. My approach is that it is all about where I bowl the ball. I just make sure I bowl according to my field because we only (are allowed to) have two (fielders) outside the ring,"" Parashar told the Vipers Voices podcast.“No matter what I do, I just make sure I get the batter to hit me where I want him to hit me. That is my only goal. I keep it quite simple and it has been working, so I am just going to stick with that.”“I would take it back to a year ago when I started bowling with the new ball in the nets in ILT20 when I was there as a net bowler,” he added.“Because it is such a high-level tournament we got new balls for practice so I got the chance to work with them and the more I just bowled, I just developed a few things and worked stuff out that works for me. Then in the domestic games (afterwards) I kept bowling with the new ball, a couple of overs in the powerplay, and that is how it started for me (bowling at that stage of an innings).""Parashar's hard work paid off in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup Asia Qualifier B in Qatar, where he was the highest wicket-taker with an exceptional economy rate of 5.10 runs per over, helping the UAE clinch the title. This tournament boosted his confidence in bowling both in and out of the powerplay.“That tournament gave me a lot of confidence, not only in the power play, but also out of the power play too. And I was happy I was able to contribute. I think of it as my first proper achievement (at international level) in the grand scheme of things,” he explained.Rejoining the Vipers fold is a reward for Parashar's efforts, and he is excited to be back with the team he has a connection with. He credits the Vipers' bowling coach, Carl Crowe , for his guidance and support in his development as a spin bowler.“If I have any doubts, he (Carl) is the best person to seek help from about spin bowling . And he has helped me a lot,"" he continued.“It does not have to be major changes or anything like that. It is a lot of T20-specific stuff. There are skills, obviously, but there are the technical and tactical aspects of bowling and having someone like him around, who is really experienced, (is priceless) since he has been in all the leagues around in the world.“He has all the stats, he knows the mantra to success. So, I am really grateful that he has always been there the last few years and hopefully I continue to have a good relationship with him.”As a local player who grew up in the UAE, Parashar is a great fan of the ILT20 and believes it is having a transformative impact on cricket in the country.He sees it as a motivation for youngsters to break into one of the six franchises and hopes to inspire others through his participation.“I have been part of the tournament in some shape or form in all the three seasons now and it has really helped me personally, as a player, to grow,"" he opined.“And not only for me, but for all the youngsters in the UAE, it is a huge motivation (to break into one of the six franchises) because obviously, it is increasing awareness and popularity of cricket in the UAE because it is our own league, which is a proud thing for the country, and especially for UAE cricket and the Emirates Cricket Board .""Parashar is optimistic about the Desert Vipers' prospects for the upcoming season, aiming to win the trophy with their strong squad and management.“Obviously like any tournament and any team, we all need to go for winning the trophy. We want to become champions this time. And I think we have a very good squad and good management,” he concluded.","UAE off-spinning all-rounder Dhruv Parashar is aiming to bowl in the powerplay overs for the Desert Vipers team in the upcoming ILT20 Season 3. 12 out of his 18 senior international appearances involving bowling in thePowerplay have been for the UAE.

NEW DELHI: India captain Rohit Sharma bid an emotional farewell to 2024 with a heartwarming video that captured the essence of his journey throughout the year.

NEW DELHI: Michael Clarke , the former Australian skipper, has expressed his admiration for India's emerging all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy , suggesting he deserves more recognition in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy series and should bat higher in the order.Nitish has made a remarkable impression in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

He maintained his momentum and proceeded to achieve his first Test century .The emotional moment at the MCG saw Nitish secure his maiden Test hundred with a boundary, followed by grounding his bat and celebrating this significant milestone in his India career.""Reddy, this young kid batting at number eight, is a genius. I think he has definitely got to bat seven if not six. He has been India's leading run-scorer, 21 years of age, unbelievable. He has been underrated in the entire series,"" Clarke said on the Beyond 23 Cricket Podcast.His century boosted Indian morale and took his BGT series total to 294 runs, placing him as India's second-highest scorer in the series.Discussions have emerged about his batting position, as he currently occupies the number eight spot.

He has been patient when he has needed to be patient. He has batted with the tail extremely well. He has shown his intent. He bats, bowls and fields,"" Clarke said.""This guy is a very good find for the Indian cricket team. I think he is good enough to bat at number six. So what a great option for India going into the last Test match,"" he added.",Michael Clarke says Nitish Kumar Reddy should bat higher in the order. Reddy scored his first Test century against Australia at the MCG on Boxing Day.

Marnus Labuschagne explains what makes Jasprit Bumrah tough to bat against

NEW DELHI: Nathan McSweeney remains optimistic about potentially succeeding Usman Khawaja in Australia's Test team, despite being dropped from the squad.McSweeney's initial Test experience came as an opener during the first three matches of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against India. As Australia contemplates David Warner's replacement, they may soon need to address Khawaja's succession as well.With Khawaja, aged 38, suggesting the Ashes as his likely farewell series, McSweeney has expressed interest in stepping into the role.""I'd love to, there's no doubt about that. Ussie has been awesome, but when the opportunity comes - or if it does - I would love to do that. I haven't had heaps of time to think about it, to be honest, it all kind of happened fairly quickly, and then I was back here playing T20 cricket,"" McSweeney said, as quoted from The Sydney Morning Herald.""Those conversations will be had, and I've got to work out and speak with the selectors about where my opportunity may come and what I need to do to get back there. I'm flexible to bat wherever and wherever I see my role to, hopefully, one day again play Test cricket,"" he added.The 25-year-old's debut series proved challenging, scoring only 72 runs across six innings at an average of 14.40. Jasprit Bumrah particularly troubled McSweeney, dismissing him four times with an average of 3.75.Following these performances, selectors opted for Sam Konstas in the Boxing Day Test, resulting in McSweeney's exclusion from the squad.Despite this setback, McSweeney praised Konstas's performance against India's pace attack whilst maintaining confidence in his own abilities ahead of Australia's tour to Sri Lanka in January.""I think what I've done really well over the last couple of years is trusting my game and being able to bat long periods of time is where I've been able to make big runs. It's quite a unique game, and it's very individual at times,"" McSweeney said.""You've got your own way to go about it, and he [Konstas] obviously did it really well in that first innings. I think I've been able to play spin pretty well here in Australia over the last few years. It's a fair bit different over there ... [but] if I got the nod to go over there, I'd feel really confident in my game against spin,"" McSweeney added.","Nathan McSweeney remains optimistic about succeeding Usman Khawaja in Australia's Test team, despite being dropped from the squad.

NEW DELHI: Rohit Sharma faced wrath from fans and cricket pundits after he promoted himself to opening in the Boxing Day Test against Australia at MCG, a move that backfired miserably as the Indian captain's woeful run with the bat continued.Rohit has struggled, making only 31 runs from five innings, with scores of 3, 6, 10, 3, and 9, resulting in a dismal average of 6.20 - the lowest by a touring captain on Australian soil.Rohit's decision also led to KL Rahul being moved to number three, while Shubman Gill was dropped from the playing XI.Former India opener Aakash Chopra voiced his ire, highlighting that in the past, MS Dhoni and Virat Kohli made bold decisions to try Rohit as an opener in ODIs and Tests, respectively, in an effort to revive his career.""For the first time in his career, he has taken a call for himself. In the past, calls have been taken for him. MS Dhoni and Virat Kohli took calls for him to move him from middle-order to opener. Dhoni did in ODIs, Virat did in Tests because they wanted Rohit to fire,"" Aakash Chopra said on his YouTube show.Chopra emphasised that Rohit's call was totally in his own interests and not in the team's since dropping Gill and relegating Rahul to number three were not advantageous for India.""For the first time, captain Rohit took a call and it was totally in his interests. It was not in the team's interests. Let's be very honest. It can't be in the team's interests because Rahul was opening very well. Shubman Gill did well in 2023, he is the second-highest run-scorer. He has played in tough situations also. He was looking good in Adelaide too. But, he had to be dropped from the team,"" he added.""All this is because Rohit thought about himself, not in the best interests of the team. For the first time in his captaincy career. It didn't turn out fine. India were not able to draw,"" Chopra further said.India suffered a 184-run drubbing by Australia in the fourth Test and now trail 1-2 in the five-match series with the last Test in Sydney starting on January 3.","Rohit Sharma faced wrath from fans and cricket pundits after he promoted himself to opening in the Boxing Day Test against Australia.
