NEW DELHI: Putting all speculation to rest, LJP (Ram Vilas) chief and Union minister Chirag Paswan has said that there will be no repetition of 2020 when his party went solo in the last assembly election in Bihar. He said his party considers all NDA candidates as their own and hence LJP (RV) is ready to put in its entire effort in securing victory for them in all 245 seats in the state.In response to a question on the sidelines of the curtain raiser event of World Food India 2025, Chirag said, “I am reiterating that when I say LJP (RV) will contest all 243 seats, I honestly feel that till you don’t treat all alliance candidates as your own nominees, you can’t achieve the target for which you are working. The NDA alliance is working to win more than 225 seats out of 243. I feel that the candidates of JD(U), BJP and others in the alliance are my candidates. If anyone is feeling happy or enthused that I will repeat the role that I played in 2020 (last assembly election), then there is no reason within the alliance that I get back to that role. The NDA is contesting as a united force.”Responding to another question on whether Jan Suraaj founder Prashant Kishor was hijacking his ‘Bihar first, Bihari first’ plank, the minister said none can hijack or copy the idea of another leader.However, he appreciated Kishor for “making honest efforts” in the interest of Bihar.“Prashant ji is playing an honest role in Bihar politics, which I appreciate. I welcome all who appeal to people to go beyond caste and communal politics...There is nothing wrong when people have more options,” he said.It can be recalled that Chirag had gone solo in 2020 assembly polls and had put up a brave fight in all seats where JD(U) had its candidates.

When did Hulk Hogan die?



How long were Hulk and Linda Hogan married?



Was Linda Hogan still in touch with Hulk Hogan before his death?



Just five days before wrestling icon Hulk Hogan 's unexpected death at 71, his ex-wife Linda Hogan shared a deeply nostalgic tribute to their decades-long history together. Her post, seemingly simple at first glance, now carries a weight of eerie finality. “The good old days!” Linda wrote alongside a photo of the couple from their 26-year marriage. It’s a snapshot that now feels like a farewell— one she never knew she was giving.Linda Hogan, 65, was married to Hulk Hogan (real name Terry Bollea) from 1983 until their very public split in 2009. Together, they were once the picture of a superstar family, featured on the VH1 reality series Hogan Knows Best. But in recent years, Linda revealed that the once-united household had splintered badly.“It’s been 15—however long—years since I left Hulk Hogan, and my family is the worst mess,” she shared in a raw Instagram video. She spoke of estrangement from her daughter, Brooke, who got married and had twins without informing her parents. “She doesn’t talk to us. She got married, had kids, didn’t tell us. I don’t know how that reflected onto me, but she cut me out too.”The image Linda shared days before Hogan’s passing showed a moment frozen in time— him in his wrestling gear, her in a black evening dress, still smiling despite what would later unravel.“I have to be honest about what I went through in my marriage,” she said. “He’s a complete liar. He’s a s*x addict. Yet he marches on, like, ‘Oh, I'm promoting my own beer, Real American Beer. Yeah, look at me.’”Despite the emotional damage, Linda acknowledged Hulk Hogan’s role as a father. “He was a s----- husband sometimes,” she admitted in an interview with TMZ, “but always a good father.” She pointed to his unrelenting support for Brooke’s career, saying he spent “probably over $3 million on Brooke's career, with no questions asked.”Still, she lamented the emotional toll of their years together. “I’ve given him more opportunities to come back and make up the family. It’s been 20 years and I’m still this sad. Somebody please explain that.”Hulk Hogan died of suspected cardiac arrest at his home in Clearwater, Florida. Though his legacy as the most recognizable face in professional wrestling is sealed in history, the complexities of his personal life remain unresolved. Linda’s reflections, which were part grief and part closure, were never intended as a eulogy. But now, they serve as the final public words from someone who knew both the man in the ring and the one behind the scenes.Also Read: WWE legend Hulk Hogan passes on anniversary of 2015 scandal that nearly ended his legacy In her final remarks, Linda said, “I do love living alone.

Met Gala Surprise: Rihanna Stuns With Baby Bump Reveal, A$AP Rocky Confirms It’s Baby No 3

After days of unrelenting speculation, Vanessa Bryant took to Instagram Stories on Sunday, June 1, to put the rumors to rest. Her response wasn’t a press statement or a legal warning, it was a wild meme with a big middle finger to the internet trolls. The meme featured music icon Rihanna floating in water with a snorkel mask on her head, holding a drink, and flipping her middle finger.“Me protecting my peace, not pregnant & having fun all summer,” Vanessa Bryant wrote in the caption on her response to the online trolls who spread her pregnancy rumors about five years after her husband, Kobe Bryant ’s, untimely and devastating demise.It was clear, clever, and vintage Vanessa who shut down noise without saying a word about the origin of the gossip. No press release needed when you’ve got Rihanna energy with a direct middle finger gesture.The rumors had emerged out of nowhere, with some users pointing to photos allegedly showing a ""baby bump,"" though no timestamps or context were attached to those images. Vanessa hasn't been publicly linked to anyone romantically, and there’s been zero confirmation from her side—until now.In another Instagram Story later that evening, Vanessa Bryant shared a motivational quote that hinted at how she views the entire situation and what matters to her personally.“The only way to impress me, is by being a good person,” the quote read. “I don’t care what you have, what you wear, where you live, or what you drive. I just have deep respect for people with pure hearts and good intentions.”Adding one final touch to her trilogy of clapbacks, she posted another Rihanna meme, this one stating, “I’m not mean, I’m just not the one.”With the classic Rihanna memes, Vanessa showed that she is busy being a proud mom to her daughters while being the powerhouse of her business ventures. While she does not care about the rumor mill, her reaction explicitly showed that she is urging privacy.Vanessa Bryant, who shares four daughters with Kobe— Natalia, Bianka, Capri, and the late Gianna— has remained devoted to family and philanthropy. Most recently, she shared footage of a joyful family ski trip over the holidays, showing the tight-knit bond she maintains with her children.Natalia Bryant stepped into the fashion world just like her mother, officially joining IMG Models in 2021 at the age of 18. “Ever since I can remember, I wanted to model,” she shared in a statement posted by IMG on Instagram. “There is a lot to learn, but I feel this is a great opportunity for me to learn and express myself creatively.”Vanessa and Kobe Bryant tied the knot in April 2001. Tragically, in January 2020, Kobe and their 13-year-old daughter Gianna lost their lives in a helicopter crash that also killed seven others. They were headed to Kobe’s Mamba Sports Academy for a youth basketball game when the accident occurred. Kobe was 41 at the time. The loss shook the sports world and left a lasting impact on fans, friends, and loved ones across the globe. Kobe has left a huge legacy to his name as well, he is considered one the of the elite NBA superstars of all time with astounding stats, records and intense playmaking abilities. His demise created a huge void in the NBA world as fans are still mourning his untimely passing.Since their passing, she’s kept their memory alive through meaningful business ventures and charitable work. Kobe launched the Mamba Sports Foundation in 2016, aiming to support young athletes. After his death, Vanessa renamed it the Mamba & Mambacita Sports Foundation in honor of both Kobe and Gianna. Today, the foundation helps underserved boys and girls in sports, pushing forward the mission they believed in. It's her way of carrying on their legacy with purpose and heart.Vanessa Bryant’s response was indeed witty and empowering as she hinted that she deserves privacy and reminded the world that while she may be a public figure, her peace and dignity aren’t up for debate, especially not over unfounded gossip. After the viral response via memes, Vanessa has seemingly closed the chapter as she did not extend the matter any further with any other comments about it afterwards.Days after shutting down the pregnancy rumor, Vanessa Bryant made a glowing courtside appearance with her daughters at the New York Liberty vs. Chicago Sky game. The WNBA shared a sweet clip showing Vanessa alongside Natalia, 22, Bianka, 8, and Capri, 5, all smiling and waving for the camera.Later, Vanessa uploaded an image of her in a restaurant, candidly posing as she waited for the food to be arrive. Considering the dress, it appears that the photograph was shot after her recent attendance in the game.Their family moment quickly caught fans’ attention online, adding a warm highlight to the evening. It was a rare and heartwarming public outing for the Bryant family, showing their strong support for women’s basketball. It was Vanessa's first public outing since she debunked the horrendous pregnancy rumors.Recently, Vanessa honored her husband Kobe's memory with a heartfelt Instagram post on Instagram, sharing a throwback photograph of the family with the NBA legend, ""Happy Fathers Day @kobebryant 💕 You are so missed.

Daniel Cormier reveals that Brock Lesnar is banned from TKO



DANIEL CORMIER SOUNDS OFF on JON JONES, ASPINALL, MMA GURU?! | EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW

Will Brock Lesnar return to WWE?



FAQs

Is Brock Lesnar banned from WWE and professional wrestling?



Why was Brock Lesnar’s name linked to the Vince McMahon lawsuit?



When did Brock Lesnar last appear on WWE programming?



Brock Lesnar, once the most dominant force in both WWE and UFC, now finds himself in an unthinkable position. He has been sidelined, silent, and reportedly banned from professional wrestling altogether. As per reports, WWE is distancing itself from Lesnar. Additionally, insiders are dropping cryptic but serious comments, which have extended the speculation. Now the question remains, is this the end of The Beast Incarnate’s career?Daniel Cormier has recently shared up update on Brock Lesnar that put the wrestling world in a frenzy. On The MightyCast with Demetrious Johnson, the former UFC Heavyweight Champion revealed that Brock Lesnar is currently blacklisted from professional wrestling. Though Cormier declined to elaborate, his tone left little room for doubt.“Brock is on the banned list right now,” he said. “Brock got into so much trouble. You know what Brock did. I ain’t telling you on air what Brock did. Brock is in so much trouble.”The remarks come amid the fallout from the high-profile lawsuit filed by former WWE employee Janel Grant, who accused Vince McMahon and others of se*ual misconduct and trafficking.Though Lesnar’s name was initially listed in the documents and later removed, his association with the case has had lasting consequences.In fact, Lesnar hasn't appeared on WWE programming since his loss to Cody Rhodes at SummerSlam 2023. He has been scrubbed from WWE marketing material, future events, and even casual mention by the promotion itself. A source close to the company told multiple outlets that Lesnar is being treated as ""radioactive"" amid ongoing legal uncertainty.While Lesnar has avoided the spotlight, he was recently spotted in public, looking fitter than ever. Fans shared photos of the 46-year-old taking selfies outside a restaurant, his shredded physique sparking whispers of a potential comeback. When asked about returning to WWE, he reportedly offered a vague reply: “We’ll see.”Still, without a clear path forward and no statement from either WWE or TKO, Lesnar’s future remains up in the air. Though Cormier’s knowledge of WWE’s internal decisions can be debated, the weight of his comments can’t be dismissed lightly, especially when paired with the company’s decision to effectively erase Lesnar from its present and near-future plans.For now, Lesnar’s focus seems to be on family. While The Beast may be lying low, fans and critics alike are left wondering, has the final bell already tolled for Brock Lesnar? So far, it’s hard to tell. Still, many fans would want to see The Beast making his WWE return with a surprise, especially as a worthy opponent of John Cena in his retirement tour. But as for the current situation, at least, according to Cormier, it is far-fetched.Also Read: Roman Reigns Confronts Paul Heyman on Raw to Sow Seeds for a Huge Clash at SummerSlam According to Daniel Cormier, Lesnar is on the ""banned list,"" though WWE hasn’t officially confirmed it.Lesnar was initially named in the lawsuit filed by Janel Grant, who alleged trafficking and misconduct, but his name was later removed.Lesnar hasn’t been seen on WWE TV since his match against Cody Rhodes at SummerSlam 2023.","Daniel Cormier reveals that Brock Lesnar is banned from TKO.

Incoming Players:

The Cavs Reunite with Their King

The Reaves Factor Would Be A Costly Sacrifice

Is the Trade Feasible?

In a dramatic new trade proposal that’s making waves across the NBA world, theare predicted to part ways with franchise cornerstoneand rising star Austin Reaves in a blockbuster five-team deal. Originally floated by Bleacher Report’s Greg Swartz, the deal imagines LeBron James finishing his career where it began — in Cleveland — while the Lakers reshape their roster around younger, defensive-minded players.The hypothetical deal suggested by Swartz is part of his piece titled “3 Trade Packages To Bring LeBron James Home to the Cleveland Cavaliers .” Of the three scenarios, this one stands out for its complexity and high-profile names.This proposed trade shakes up rosters across five teams and addresses different franchise needs—from Cleveland’s desire for a LeBron homecoming to Brooklyn’s aim for long-term picks and depth.If the Los Angeles Lakers were to greenlight this deal, they’d be giving up not just LeBron James, but also their breakout guard Austin Reaves—arguably the second and third-best players on the current roster. The return? One All-Star forward and two premium role players.- Lauri Markkanen: Former All-Star forward, averaged 18.2 points and 7.1 rebounds on 37% from three throughout his career.- De’Andre Hunter: A two-way forward who was putting up nearly 20 points per game before his move to Cleveland.- Max Strus: Known for his three-and-D prowess, fits perfectly in a modern defensive lineup.“Lauri Markkanen is a one-time All-Star, has more potential to grow, and is more clearly on the same timeline as Luka Doncic,” wrote Swartz in his breakdown.While the deal strips the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron’s leadership and Reaves’ ascending talent, it compensates with youth, defense, and perimeter shooting—traits that align with current trends in team-building.Bringing LeBron James back to Cleveland would be a full-circle moment in NBA history. After winning a title with the Cavaliers in 2016, a return for one last chapter would be an emotional high point for both the player and the franchise. With Austin Reaves and Walker Kessler added to the mix, the Cavs would deepen their rotation while LeBron provides veteran leadership and late-game poise.For Los Angeles Lakers fans, parting ways with Reaves might sting more than moving on from the aging LeBron. Reaves has grown into a reliable scoring option, averaging 20 points per game in just his fourth season. While he’s not the best defender, his offensive efficiency and steady development make him a key piece.Yet if the goal is to build a defensive-minded roster that can stretch the floor, this trade supports that vision—even if it’s painful in the short term.While the proposed trade is loaded with logic and upside, the logistics of coordinating five teams remain a massive hurdle. Salary matching, team preferences, and player buy-in could complicate the framework. But for fans and analysts alike, it offers a fascinating glimpse at what a post-LeBron Lakers roster could look like.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors Predicted to Target $2,800,834 Miami Heat Center As Logical Backup Plan if Horford Deal Falls Through If the Los Angeles Lakers are serious about pivoting away from the LeBron era and building a younger, more defensively versatile team, Swartz’s proposed mega-deal might just be worth considering.","The Los Angeles Lakers are predicted to part ways with franchise cornerstoneand rising star Austin Reaves in a blockbuster five-team deal.

Preparing for Life After Basketball

Stephen Curry is Not Done Yet

superstarhas offered fans a clearer picture of his future in the NBA, easing concerns about an imminent retirement. At 37 years old and with two seasons left on his current deal through 2026-27, Curry is approaching the twilight of his career with perspective and balance—preferring to take things “two years at a time” rather than commit to a fixed retirement date. Stephen Curry’s comments reflect a mature understanding of the toll the game takes, especially during the offseason. He pointed out that preparing for the season—repetitive conditioning, strength training, and daily grind—has become more challenging than the 82-game season itself. Yet, he still finds joy in playing. “The games are the easy part,” he said. “That’s the fun part.”When it comes to retirement, Curry spoke candidly. He noted that some players are “forced out,” while others walk away on their own terms. His hope is to be in the latter group, choosing to leave when his body tells him it’s time—not because he can no longer keep up. “I don’t want to be the one that’s limping up and down the court trying to keep up with the young bucks,” Curry added.Despite being one of the NBA’s oldest active stars, Stephen Curry remains one of its most effective. He averaged 24.5 points, six assists, and 4.4 three-pointers per game last season, earning All-NBA Second Team honors. His production hasn’t slowed, and the Golden State Warriors are making roster decisions with Curry’s competitive window in mind, hoping to capitalize on their championship potential while he’s still playing at a high level.Curry isn’t just thinking about basketball. Off the court, he’s laying the groundwork for his next chapter. He serves as CEO of Thirty Ink, a business umbrella that includes Unanimous Media, Gentleman’s Cut bourbon, and 7k, a marketing consultancy. He’s also expressed interest in sports broadcasting and NBA ownership, following the footsteps of former players like Michael Jordan and Carmelo Anthony.Whether he ends up in a broadcast booth or part of a front office, Curry seems intent on remaining a prominent figure in basketball long after his final game.For now, Warriors fans can rest easy: Curry isn’t planning to retire anytime soon. His focus is on staying healthy, having fun, and chasing more titles. His transparency about the aging process, the demands of the game, and the realities of legacy offer a refreshing, human look at one of the NBA’s greatest players.Also read: NBA Free Agency Rumors: New York Knicks predicted to land $50 million Orlando Magic star to boost bench depth and improve title odds Stephen Curry’s measured and thoughtful approach makes it clear—he’s not just preparing for retirement; he’s preparing to make an impact long after his playing days are over.","Stephen Curry has two seasons left on his current deal with the Golden State Warriors.

Low-Cost, High-Upside Fit for a New Knicks Identity

Theare in the midst of retooling their roster to build a more effective bench unit, and one NBA analyst believes signing former Magic Star, Markelle Fultz, could be a low-risk, high-reward move. With a new era beginning under head coach Mike Brown, the Knicks are aiming to address one of their most glaring weaknesses from last season — second-unit production.Despite making the playoffs, the New York Knicks ’ bench unit was statistically one of the worst in the league during the 2024-25 season. They ranked at the bottom in both bench points (21.7 per game) and bench minutes (12.7 per game) — far below league averages. With a revamped coaching staff and strategic acquisitions like Jordan Clarkson and Guerschon Yabusele, the franchise is looking for one more piece to solidify its reserve rotation.Former 76ers guard Markelle Fultz, the No. 1 pick in the 2017 NBA Draft, has had a tumultuous career marked by injuries and inconsistent opportunities. Still just 27, Fultz played 21 games for the Sacramento Kings last season, averaging 2.9 points and 1.3 assists in limited action (8.8 minutes per game).While those numbers may seem underwhelming, his more extended stint with the Orlando Magic (2019–2024) tells a different story.When healthy, Fultz proved he could be a productive contributor off the bench or even in spot starts.His efforts on defense were also quietly impactful. According to The Sporting News, Markelle Fultz posted a 0.7 defensive box plus-minus that year, signaling his value as a two-way presence — an area where the New York Knicks desperately need depth, especially behind starting guards like Jalen Brunson Bringing in Markelle Fultz wouldn’t require a large financial commitment, making the move a classic low-risk, high-reward gamble. He’s versatile, can play on or off the ball, and has experience bouncing back from adversity — qualities that could thrive under Mike Brown’s system.If healthy, Fultz could provide:- Secondary ball-handling and playmaking- Defensive stability in short spurts- Veteran poise at just 27 years old- Insurance in case of injuries to the starting backcourtDean Simon of The Sporting News writes, “If the New York Knicks are willing to give the two-way guard a shot at contributing to a team with championship aspirations in spot minutes, a healthy campaign for Markelle Fultz could result in the team completing one of the more underrated signings of the 2025 offseason.”Also read: NBA Analyst's Blockbuster Proposal Lands Warriors $82 Million Former Cavaliers Champion as Kevon Looney’s Replacement As the New York Knicks aim to build a title-contending squad, adding Markelle Fultz as a depth piece could be a smart bet.

Matthew Tkachuk injury opens door for Panthers’ salary cap workaround

Matthew Tkachuk’s groin injury could become Panthers’ financial lifeline

FAQs

1. Why are the Panthers considering placing Matthew Tkachuk on LTIR?

2. Is Matthew Tkachuk seriously injured?

3. Could this move be seen as salary cap manipulation?

The Florida Panthers, stepped off another Stanley Cup win, face salary cap challenges. Star forward Matthew Tkachuk's injury could offer a solution. Placing him on long-term injured reserve would create cap relief, though he battled injuries across last season's championship run.Even as the champagne corks settle from their consecutive Stanley Cup triumph, the Florida Panthers' management faces pressing financial decisions. It's the hockey offseason, but for the front office, the work is far from over.A consequential hurdle looms: the team's current payroll surpasses the salary cap by a notable $3.75 million, a figure confirmed by Puck Pedia. This means the Panthers must strategically reduce their financial commitments to align with league regulations.One particularly impactful avenue for achieving cap consent revolves around key forward Matthew Tkachuk, whose contract carries a hefty $9.5 million impact on the team's salary structure. The possibility of his injury playing a role in this decision has been raised.Sportsnet's Nick Kypreos, in his assessment of Florida’s cap situation, put forth a compelling idea: “If Tkachuk were to miss the beginning of the season and be out for a while, the Panthers would be able to get under the cap by putting his contract on LTIR.”This maneuver, placing a player on the long-term injured reserve, offers the distinct advantage of allowing a team to briefly exceed the salary cap.Matthew Tkachuk, a true competitor, played through significant injuries during the 2024-25 season, including a torn adductor and hernia sustained at the 4 Nations Face-Off. His dedication was vital to the Panthers' second consecutive Stanley Cup.In the 2025 Final, he bestowed three goals and seven assists. Tkachuk's substantial $9.5 million cap hit is a key factor, with Aleksander Barkov ($10 million), Sam Reinhart ($8.625 million), and Sam Bennett ($8 million, recently signed extension) also having large contracts.The Panthers face a tough offseason dilemma: balancing their championship roster with salary cap constraints, potentially relying on Matthew Tkachuk's injury status to navigate their financial tightrope.Also Read: Brad Marchand’s disrespectful celebration resurfaces as Panthers clinch Cup — Canucks fans furious To create cap relief, as his $9.5M salary could help offset their $3.75M cap overage.Tkachuk has been dealing with lingering groin issues since the 4 Nations Face-Off and the playoffs.Some critics believe using LTIR for Tkachuk’s injury might be a strategic loophole rather than necessity.","The Florida Panthers, fresh off their Stanley Cup win, are facing salary cap challenges.

Embracing motherhood again while Tom Brady moves on



FAQs:



1. How many children does Gisele Bündchen have?

2. Who is Gisele Bündchen’s current partner?

3. Where did Gisele celebrate her 45th birthday?

Supermodel Gisele Bündchen marked her 45th birthday with an intimate celebration in Brazil, surrounded by nature, family, and love. But what caught the eyes of her nearly 23 million Instagram followers was a rare and tender glimpse of her baby boy—her first child with partner Joaquim Valente. While the little one’s face remained strategically hidden, the photos spoke volumes of a deeply personal milestone for the Brazilian icon.On July 20, Gisele and her twin sister Patricia celebrated their birthday together, and the occasion was made even more emotional as it also marked what would have been their late mother Vania Nonnenmacher’s 77th birthday. Vania passed away in January 2024 after battling cancer.“Today is also my mom’s birthday. We miss her deeply, but we know she’s always with us,” Gisele wrote in a touching caption, adding, “I continue to trust and welcome life with an open heart, holding gratitude for all that is still to come. Sending love to everyone. ❤️”The post, filled with serene moments captured in Rio Grande do Sul, showed Gisele holding her five-month-old in a baby carrier as they admired a waterfall, another snapshot featuring her father Valdir Bündchen, and a sweet birthday card from her infant son.Though the baby’s face was kept out of the frame, the love Gisele exuded was unmistakable.While Bündchen appears grounded and content in her new chapter with Joaquim Valente, her ex-husband Tom Brady has also moved forward.

Fans divided as tradition meets individuality on the DCC sidelines

The ponytail wasn’t Faith Ward’s idea—and it might not be permanent

A new era of flexibility for America’s Sweethearts?

FAQs

1. Why is Faith Ward’s ponytail making headlines with the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders?

2. Did Faith Ward choose the ponytail herself?

3. Will the ponytail become a permanent look for DCC?

As the Dallas Cowboys ramp up for the 2025 NFL season, it’s not just stars like Micah Parsons and Trevon Diggs commanding attention. Rookie cheerleader Faith Ward has sparked a surprising wave of controversy—thanks to her high ponytail.Faith Ward, a history-making recruit from New Zealand, became the first woman from her country to make the iconic Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders (DCC) roster. But it’s her choice of hairstyle—not just her dance moves—that’s setting social media ablaze. During training camp, Ward ditched the DCC’s signature flowing curls in favor of a slicked-back ponytail—a move that instantly triggered both admiration and criticism online.Clips of Ward performing in uniform with her ponytail quickly went viral on TikTok and Instagram. While some viewers loved the sleek look, others were baffled by the break in tradition. “The pony is iconic but how is she allowed to have it like that?” one commenter asked. Critics expressed concern that loosening long-standing beauty standards could disrupt the polished, uniform image the DCC is famous for.In a candid interview with ABC Perth on July 21, Ward addressed the uproar.She acknowledged the expected DCC look—“fluffy, voluminous, luscious, long locks”—but shared that her ponytail “broke that stereotype.”Interestingly, Ward revealed the hairstyle was suggested during a rehearsal by DCC director Kelli Finglass while running through the high-energy “Thunderstruck” routine. Finglass reportedly approved of the look, even comparing it to pop icon Ariana Grande.Still, Ward says the style might not be here to stay. “We still have to keep an open mind to the possibility that I could be going back to hair out,” she added.Faith Ward isn’t alone in pushing the boundaries. Netflix's America’s Sweethearts featured other DCC members like Ava Lahey opting for functional tweaks to their glam in the name of comfort and performance.Whether her ponytail sticks or not, Ward is already rewriting the playbook—bringing fresh energy and global flair to one of the NFL’s most iconic squads.Also Read: Courtney Johnson reflects on how Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders rejection fueled her media career Her slicked-back ponytail breaks from the DCC's traditional voluminous hairstyle, sparking debate over individuality versus uniformity.No, the idea came from DCC director Kelli Finglass during a rehearsal, and it received positive feedback.Faith Ward says it's uncertain, noting they’re keeping “an open mind” about returning to the traditional style.","Faith Ward became the first woman from her country to make the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders roster.

Dylan Harper in action (Image via Instagram / @dylharpp)

With the rookie class making their summer league debuts and teams anticipating the upcoming season, the 2025 NBA draft is now complete. According to an anonymous Western Conference scout, Dylan Harper may make De'Aaron Fox expendable to the San Antonio Spurs . He even received six votes when asked which rookie will end up being the best pick in the draft. Dylan Harper, the San Antonio Spurs' third consecutive top-five pick in the NBA Draft over the previous three years, was selected this year.ESPN recently surveyed early thoughts on the draft. Twenty unnamed NBA executives and scouts were polled by ESPN's Jeremy Woo to get their opinions on the incoming rookie class for the 2025–2026 NBA season. Participants voted on five questions based on their assessments and initial observations from this offseason.The questions included who organizations consider the front-runner for the No. 1 pick in 2026, which players were thought to be possible draft steals, and whether anyone may challenge Cooper Flagg for Rookie of the Year. The panelists shared their opinions.Six votes went to Dylan Harper of San Antonio Spurs, the No. 2 choice, who was considered as De'Aaron Fox expendable.Some people thought the team would be a good destination despite their packed backcourt.The S.A. Spurs, who have been preparing for more playmaking around Victor Wembanyama going ahead, selected Dylan Harper because of his skill at pick-and-roll and his cunning, potent style of play. He appears to be a key long-term player, even if he ends up starting as a rookie.As per ESPN, one Western Conference scout said:""[Harper] has some [Manu] Ginobili to his offensive game... If the 3-point shot ever becomes a true weapon [for him], he makes Fox expendable and gives San Antonio a nice trade asset.""Many believe that the S.A. Spurs' path to being a competitive club has started with Dylan Harper's addition. In fact, one NBA legend advised Victor Wembanyama to change his style of play moving forward.The San Antonio Spurs now have three starting-level guards, none of whom would benefit from a spell off the bench, so they may need to deal with De'Aaron Fox's position. However, instead of taking any steps to cut De'Aaron Fox or other players, the team has signed Dylan Harper, who made an impression in Las Vegas.Also read: San Antonio Spurs share heartfelt message of support amid tragic Hill Country flooding","The 2025 NBA draft is now complete.

Tyler Motte: The journey since leaving the Chicago Blackhawks

FAQs

Q1: Why hasn't Tyler Motte been able to sign with a new team yet?

Q2: What contract is Tyler Motte likely to receive?

Q3: Is it possible for Tyler Motte to continue impacting the NHL?

With the succession operating in full force during the offseason, some experienced players remain undrafted. Among them is former Chicago Blackhawks forward Tyler Motte, still looking for a new contract. While most teams were busy locking in their core targets earlier in July, Motte's free agency reflects on the quietness of his 2023-24 season and the ever-changing needs of franchises heading into this new campaign. Still, he can represent a potential value if picked up.A name associated with physical gameplay and penalty killing would be that of Tyler Motte, a player last seen suited up for the Detroit Red Wings. The 30-year-old had featured in 55 games for the 2023-24 season with an offensive output of 4 goals and 5 assists, alongside achieving a high number of hits (72). Regardless of that low-scoring rate, his excellence lies in being able to play either wing and contribute defensively while providing energy from the fourth line, which makes for great depth. Teams looking to fill their bottom-six rotation could very well value such a skill set on a short-term, inexpensive deal.Motte’s physical presence will be so important for a team seeking gritty, accountable players for the lineup.Not shy of taking hits, Motte is counted on in defensive zone draw situations and penalty killing to shut down threats. A rather down-to-earth contract expectation and a fair bunch of experience may see him slipping into a roster before pre-season training camp begins.Drafted by the Chicago Blackhawks at 121st overall in 2013, Tyler Motte made his NHL debut in the 2016-17 season, scoring four goals and seven points in 33 games. His Chicago stay, however, did not last long as he was shipped out in the 2017 summer deal that sent Artemi Panarin to Columbus. Afterward, Motte has played with multiple teams: the Vancouver Canucks, New York Rangers, and Ottawa Senators.While he's never quite been the star, consistency in fulfilling a very defined role has kept Motte afloat in the league. At the point of teams firming up their rosters, he remains a sure pick for deep line consideration.Also Read: Vladimir Orszagh to lead Slovakia at Milano-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics Although the first wave of free-agent signings has passed, Tyler Motte remains relevant for one reason: his status as a hardworking forward who can fill multiple roles.

TOI

The technical committee of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) rubbed their eyes in disbelief when they saw the long list of candidates for the India coaching job.There were the familiar names like former national team coach Stephen Constatine, Liverpool star Harry Kewell, former Blackburn Rovers manager Steve Kean, India’s own Khalid Jamil, and coaches like Kibu Vicuna and Eelco Schattorie, whose work is known in the country. But at the bottom of a list prepared by AIFF’s national team director Subrata Paul, there was Xavi Hernandez.Marked in green, the former Barcelona coach and legend, someone who made more than 700 appearances for the Spanish giants, was shown to have sent the application from his own email ID. Unlike other shortlisted applications, the contact number column was blank.“It’s correct that Xavi’s name was there,” Paul toldon Thursday. “The application was emailed to the AIFF.”According to sources, the technical committee did not consider Xavi for the final shortlist due to the high financial cost. As player, the Spanish midfielder enjoyed a historic career, winning the FIFA World Cup in 2010 and two European championships. With Barcelona, he became the symbol of the club’s possession-based style of football and won 25 trophies, which includes eight La Liga titles and four Champions Leagues.Xavi kickstarted his coaching career with Al Sadd in Qatar, then returned to Barcelona as coach, but left after guiding the club to two trophies in two and a half seasons in charge, including the 2022-23 La Liga title.“Even if Xavi was genuinely interested in Indian football and could be convinced to take up the job, we would need a lot of money,” said a member of the technical committee who attended the virtual meeting on Wednesday.In a previous interview with The Athletic, Xavi said he “sometimes (follows) the Indian League because many Spanish coaches are there.”The technical committee has recommended three names to the AIFF executive committee to replace Manolo Marquez, who quit early this month. Jamil is the lone home-grown coach in the list, which also has Constantine, hoping for a third stint with the national team, and former Kyrgyzstan and Slovakia head coach Stefan Tarkovic.The shortlist was finalised by the technical committee chaired by former India captain IM Vijayan. Paul, and technical director Syed Sabir Pasha, were also in attendance, while inputs were sought from Dronacharya awardees Armando Colaco and Bimal Ghosh, who are advisors to AIFF president Kalyan Chaubey.",Xavi Hernandez is on the shortlist of candidates for the India coaching job.

How and why Rishabh Pant's England tour could come to an abrupt end due to toe fracture

Poll How impressed are you by Rishabh Pant's performance despite his injury? Extremely impressed Somewhat impressed Not very impressed

Around 11 am local time, Rishabh Pant arrived at Old Trafford cricket ground with his injured right foot protected and secured inside a moonboot. He used a crutch for support and slowly made his way to the away dressing room. In lightning quick time, the wicketkeeper-batter changed to the Indian whites and was captured in the balcony behind head coach Gautam Gambhir He had not accompanied the rest of the team in the bus to the ground and it was later revealed by Shardul Thakur that an early hospital visit forced him to arrive nearly two hours later. The visuals of Day 1 were still fresh in everyone's mind and it was difficult to even entertain the outrageous thought of Pant coming out to bat in that condition. The swelling, the bleeding and the inability to put the injured foot down made it impossible to imagine the 27-year-old walking down the staircase from the dressing room to the ground.All heads panned towards the steps when Shardul Thakur was dismissed and the capacity crowd was up on its feet when they saw Pant hobble out to the middle. The scoreboard, the situation of the match and cricket took a backseat because what was unfolding in front of everyone was an exhibition of grit, courage and the desire to contribute for the team.There was a sense of shock in the opposite camp too because they didn't expect Pant to play any part in the Test and him walking out did catch them a bit off guard.He stretched his overnight score of 37 to 54, hit a six off Jofra Archer, limped for singles and gave another example of why impossible is ‘I'm possible’ in Pant's dictionary. If batting with a painful finger at Lord's wasn't enough, the left-hander took it to a different level by batting with a fractured toe. An injury which required him to rest for at least six weeks but all that took a backseat as Pant wanted to score those crucial runs lower down the order.Multiple trips to the hospital and the hours put in by the medical team kept the plan of keeping him ready to bat in place, and there was a lot of excitement in the dressing room. They were aware of the seriousness of the injury but knew the grit would take over.""Everyone was very excited to see how he would approach his innings. And I think what he showed today, the passion he showed for the team is unmatched. We have seen a lot of instances in the past where he has batted in fractures. I think there was a time when Graeme Smith was batting in the South African team. His hand was fractured.""So, in these moments, the grit of the player comes into play. And I think Rishabh's positivity and his grit keeps him away from all the pains and whatever pain he has. His pain bearing capacity is very high. If he is in pain, it is a big injury,"" said Shardul Thakur in the post-day presser.With Pant, it has been the case of grit over matter and will not be a surprise if it remains that way in the second innings too. There is no official word on his participation in the last Test but it is very unlikely.Manchester, however, could see another glimpse of the freak who dances to his own tunes. If the situation demands and the team needs, the crutches will be ditched, the moonboot will come off and he will descend those steps again to give his all for the team. Possibly one last time in the series.",Rishabh Pant came out to bat with a fractured toe on Day 1 of the second Test. The wicketkeeper-batter scored 54 not out and hit a six off Jofra Archer. The 27-year-old is expected to be out for at least six weeks with the injury.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122894641,imgsize-90074,width-400,resizemode-4/122894641.jpg"

How and why Rishabh Pant's England tour could come to an abrupt end due to toe fracture

MANCHESTER: Rishabh Pant ’s foot injury on the first day of the fourth Test here has triggered a debate around the need for allowing like-for-like substitutions for external injuries.Pant going out to bat with a broken metatarsal made for a great story but it was a decision forced upon the team, since the playing conditions don’t allow a substitute to bat or bowl. The International Cricket Council (ICC) is close to bring in a provision for likefor-like substitutions later this year, TOI has learnt.“There is a chance that teams will get to bring in a replacement for serious external injuries. The matter is already under deliberation. A ratification is expected in the next ICC cricket committee meeting,” an ICC source said.In June, the ICC announced that a ‘replacement-player’ condition would be trialled by the Full Members of the world body.“A player who suffers a serious injury on the field of play any time after the match has started (including any pre-match warm-up period) may be replaced for the remainder of the match by a fully participating like-forlike player,” the ICC had said in a statement on June 25.Former England captain Michael Vaughan has been vocal in his support of allowing proper replacements.“Injury replacements should be permitted in Tests in the first innings of the game,” Vaughan had told BBC Sport two months ago.“If there’s a genuine injury in the first innings, it affects the game and the entertainment, which fans pay money to watch. The first innings is a good cutoff to make it fair.”India, after all, let go off a lot of runs when Pant was at the crease since he couldn’t run fast enough to complete obvious singles.","The International Cricket Council is close to bringing in a provision for likefor-like substitutions later this year.

Poll Will India win Day 3 of the fourth Test? Yes, they will bounce back! No, England will dominate.

NEW DELHI: As England tightened their grip on the fourth Test at Old Trafford, former skipper Michael Vaughan delivered a rallying call for India, urging Shubman Gill’s side to channel the intensity of Virat Kohli heading into what he described as the “series-defining” Day 3.At stumps on Day 2, England were well-positioned at 225/2, trailing India’s first-innings total of 358 by just 133 runs. Openers Zak Crawley (84) and Ben Duckett (94) put on a blistering 166-run stand before both fell short of centuries. Debutant Anshul Kamboj claimed his maiden wicket when Duckett edged to stand-in wicketkeeper Dhruv Jurel.With England already leading the five-match series 2-1, Vaughan stressed the importance of Day 3 on Cricbuzz.“The series will be decided on Day Three. If England have a great day, I think they’re winning this Test match and that’s the series done and dusted,” he said. “India and Shubman have to arrive on Day Three with that Virat mentality. We have to win the day. If they win tomorrow, the game is alive. If they lose, the series is gone.”Backing Vaughan’s assessment, Dinesh Karthik added: ""Those are big words and I think it's a very fair observation as well. Because walking into day three, as they call it, the moving day, you would almost think the series hangs in the balance on that day. If India wants to stay alive, they need to have a good day with the ball.""All eyes will be on India's bowlers on Friday — as they look to summon the fight and fire that defined the Kohli era.",Michael Vaughan urges India to channel Virat Kohli's intensity on Day 3.

How and why Rishabh Pant's England tour could come to an abrupt end due to toe fracture

MANCHESTER: In gloomy conditions at Old Trafford, India looked like they were going to do an encore of Gabba 2021. Shardul Thakur and Washington Sundar’s gritty 48-run partnership, against the new ball, started the fight on the second morning of the fourth Test.Rishabh Pant, coming back after retiring hurt on Wednesday evening, added 17 runs with a fractured right foot in an exhibition of indomitable spirit. The circumstances leading to Thursday morning resembled India’s tour of Australia in 2020-21. The characters in play were the same. It all seemed to be going according to plan when India reached 358 battling against the likes of Ben Stokes , who had spectacular figures of 5/72, and Jofra Archer ’s spell of 3/73. All that fight evaporated when the sun broke out as England openers Ben Duckett and Zak Crawley plundered the Indian bowling for 166 runs in 32 overs.That opening partnership laid the foundation for England to finish the day at 225/2 in 46 overs, closing in on India’s first-innings score in double quick time. India did rediscover some of the fight, claiming two wickets in six overs through Ravindra Jadeja and debutant Anshul Kamboj’s dismissals of Crawley and Duckett, for 84 and 94 respectively.Jasprit Bumrah’s late burst gave Joe Root a few nervy moments but it didn’t yield any results. Captain Shubman Gill looked completely out of depth and appeared in no control of the proceedings.Gill and his bowlers will be desperate to turn a corner early on Friday morning or else they could see the match and the series running away from them very quickly with Ollie Pope and Joe Root batting on 20 and 11 respectively. India’s seam bowling looked the flattest in the most favourable conditions in the series.It’s safe to say they played their most ordinary cricket in the series after the last two sessions of the first Test in Leeds. Bumrah was the only one who turned up looking at his usual best, but his good work was undone as Kamboj struggled to find any rhythm with the new ball. The nerves of playing a Test match kicked in and the 24-year-old Kamboj lost his line.He was significantly down on pace as well in his first spell. Once he leaked a few boundaries, mostly on the leg-side, it became a template. Mohammed Siraj, on the back of two good Test matches, too leaked runs on both sides of the wicket.Shardul Thakur, too, never settled down on a line and length. The outfield quickening up in the sun left the Indian bowlers with lesser room for error. It was like watching two different Indian teams on the field. When Archer removed Jadeja for 20 with the new ball at the score of 266/5 in the second over of the day, India’s capitulation seemed a matter of time. The ball flew past the edges of the bats of Thakur and Washington. Like they did in Gabba all those years ago, the duo batted sensibly to frustrate Stokes and Archer.Stokes eventually worked out both of them, dismissing Thakur for 41 off 88 and Washington 27 off 90. And when Pant went about middling the balls he played, it seemed India had got the momentum going in their favour.

Poll Should aggressive exchanges be part of competitive sports? Yes, it adds excitement No, it should be avoided Only if it remains respectful

WATCH:

India fast bowler Mohammed Siraj endured a tough outing on Thursday at Old Trafford, going wicketless in his 10 overs while conceding 58 runs in the fourth Test match against England. During the third session, Siraj lost his cool and got into a heated verbal exchange with England opener Ben Duckett , who, along with Zak Crawley , stitched together a dominant 166-run opening stand against an out-of-sorts Indian attack.The altercation drew attention after Star Sports shared a video clip on X, showing Siraj angrily pointing fingers at Duckett. The footage quickly went viral across social media platforms.Duckett, continuing his fine form after a 149-run knock in the previous Test at Leeds, played another impactful innings. He struck 94 off 100 balls, hitting 13 boundaries, before falling just short of a century.The breakthrough came when debutant Anshul Kamboj picked up his first Test wicket, getting Duckett caught behind by Dhruv Jurel off the first ball of the 39th over. With that scalp, Kamboj became the fourth fast bowler from Haryana—after Kapil Dev, Yograj Singh, and Chetan Sharma—to take a Test wicket for India.Kamboj, who has 79 wickets from 24 first-class matches, was added to the Indian squad on Monday following injuries to Nitish Kumar Reddy and Arshdeep Singh.Earlier, India posted 358 in their first innings across 119.1 overs. At No. 3, Sai Sudharsan contributed a gritty 61 off 151 balls, while opener Yashasvi Jaiswal added 58 off 107 deliveries.Despite sustaining a foot injury on Day 1, Rishabh Pant returned to bat and fought hard for his 54 off 75 balls.England’s bowling was led by skipper Ben Stokes, who claimed 5 for 72 in 24 overs. Jofra Archer provided strong support, finishing with figures of 3 for 73 from 26.1 overs.","India fast bowler Mohammed Siraj endured a tough outing on Thursday at Old Trafford.

How and why Rishabh Pant's England tour could come to an abrupt end due to toe fracture

Poll What was your impression of Anshul Kamboj's debut performance? Outstanding Solid but could improve

NEW DELHI: India’s newest Test debutant, Anshul Kamboj, announced himself on the big stage with a crucial breakthrough on Day 2 of the fourth Test at Old Trafford, Manchester, removing England opener Ben Duckett for 94 and giving his team a much-needed lifeline after a dominant opening stand.The 24-year-old Haryana pacer, drafted into the squad after injuries to multiple frontline quicks, produced a sharp, rising delivery from a back-of-a-length that surprised Duckett, who could only edge it to substitute wicketkeeper Dhruv Jurel. It was Kamboj’s maiden Test wicket, and his emotional celebration — arms outstretched and a roar of relief — reflected what the moment meant to him.Speaking to broadcasters after the day's play, Kamboj was honest and grounded in his reflections.“I felt good. I tried to start by bowling in good areas… I am not satisfied with my bowling,” he chuckled modestly. “I tried to come and bowl. I would have done better.”The nerves of debuting in a high-stakes series were evident.“I just tried to act a little more in the first two spells. But in the third spell, I backed my strengths more.Tomorrow, we’ll try to bowl tight, not give many boundaries. Because they’re looking for boundaries, not singles,” he explained with tactical clarity.Kamboj also shared the invaluable experience of bowling alongside India’s pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah “There is so much to learn. When you are bowling with Jasprit Bumrah, you get to learn a lot. We keep having discussions about what we need to do, so I have to adapt accordingly,” he said.Kamboj’s journey from India A ranks to the Test arena has been rapid but deserved, and with this first wicket under his belt, he has taken the first big stride in what could be a long journey ahead.India ended the day with hopes rekindled, thanks in no small part to a debutant who rose to the occasion.","Anshul Kamboj took the wicket of Ben Duckett on Day 2 of the fourth Test at Old Trafford, Manchester.

Rishabh Pant suffers right foot injury in India vs England Test; taken off in an ambulance

Poll How do you think Rishabh Pant's injury will impact India's performance in the ongoing Test series? Significantly negative impact Minor negative impact No impact at all Positive impact with new players

England seamer Chris Woakes has spoken about the delivery that struck Rishabh Pant’s toe — an injury that ruled the wicketkeeper-batter out of the ongoing Test series after he sustained a fracture on the opening day of the fourth Test at Old Trafford in Manchester.“He’s quite unpredictable,” Woakes said on Sky Sports.“He doesn’t give you many cues, but sometimes you get a gut feeling that he’s about to do something. He’d played five or six deliveries normally, so I had a feeling...“I didn’t think it would be a reverse sweep! I thought he might run at me, so I tried to bowl a slower ball; it came out full and hit him on the foot. It wasn’t intended to be a yorker, but the plan was to take the pace off.”Pant retired hurt on 37 and went for scans after taking a blow to his right foot while attempting a reverse sweep off Woakes.Blood was seen seeping from Pant’s right foot, which showed considerable swelling.He did not return to the ground with the team on Thursday.Initial scans have revealed a mild compound fracture in Pant’s right foot — likely the cause of the bleeding and swelling that forced him to retire hurt on Wednesday.Pant’s participation in the ongoing Test appears extremely unlikely, and his availability will depend on how quickly the swelling subsides. However, early indications suggest the pain has persisted despite immediate first aid, raising serious doubts about any further involvement in the match.With no official update yet from the BCCI , team sources have indicated that the management is already exploring replacement options. Left-handed wicketkeeper-batter Ishan Kishan — who toured with the A team and also played county matches — is the frontrunner to be drafted into the squad.The setback adds to India’s growing concerns, as Pant had also suffered a finger injury during the third Test at Lord’s, which forced him to hand over the keeping duties to Dhruv Jurel.",England seamer Chris Woakes has spoken about the delivery that struck Rishabh Pant’s toe.

India U-19’s rising star Vaibhav Suryavanshi endured a rare failure, getting dismissed for a golden duck on Day 4 of the second Youth Test against England U-19 at Chelmsford.The 14-year-old teen prodigy, who lit up the 2025 IPL season with Rajasthan Royals , faced a harsh reminder of Test cricket’s challenges when he mistimed an aggressive pull shot off the very first ball he faced from England’s Alex Green, chopping it onto his stumps.The early blow left India under pressure as they began their daunting chase of 355 runs on the final day.Suryavanshi’s dismissal at 0-1 was a setback, but the talented left-hander is known for his fearless batting style and is expected to bounce back stronger.Watch:Despite his failure, skipper Ayush Mhatre took charge of the chase with a blistering counterattack.Displaying remarkable composure and controlled aggression, Mhatre smashed 13 4s and six sixes to race to 126 runs, lifting India’s spirits and keeping the chase alive.Mhatre’s 126 off 80 balls at a staggering strike rate of 157.50 was the highlight of the innings, unsettling the English bowlers and injecting hope into an improbable chase.Meanwhile, Vihaan Malhotra and wicketkeeper-batter Abhigyan Kundu provided valuable support, rotating strike and ensuring the scoreboard kept ticking.While the road to victory remains steep, India’s fearless batting approach in the second innings stands out.Mhatre’s heroics, in particular, have caught attention, especially after his recent stint with Chennai Super Kings in the IPL.","India U-19’s rising star Vaibhav Suryavanshi endured a rare failure, getting dismissed for a golden duck on Day 4 of the second Youth Test against England.

The Working-Class Hero



WORKING CLASS HERO. (Ultimate Mix, 2020) - John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band (official music video HD)





Ryan Coogler’s– the best movie to come out so far this year – begins with the line: “There are legends of people born with a gift of making music so true, it can pierce the veil between life and death.” The reference is to the young blues musician Sammie “Preacher Boy” Moore whose music could summon the undead. Ozzy Osbourne too, was born with the gift of making music so true, it could pierce the veil between life and death.Two weeks ago, when Ozzy – perched on a giant black throne like some deranged medieval king – growled, “Let’s go crazy one last f**** time,” before launching into Paranoid, it felt like theatre. Now it feels like prophecy. On July 22, John Michael Osbourne – yes, he had a perfectly ordinary name before the bat-biting and ant-snorting – left this world, but not before reinventing what sound, fury, and darkness could mean.Ozzy’s voice was never operatic, never “clean.” It was a cracked cathedral bell, wailing raw truth. With Black Sabbath, he didn’t just sing; he conjured fear. Tony Iommi’s down-tuned guitar, forged after losing fingertips in a factory accident, rumbled like industrial machinery.Geezer Butler’s bass rolled like thunder, while Bill Ward’s drumming cracked like collapsing steel. Above it all, Ozzy’s haunted wail floated like a ghostly siren, cutting through the darkness.Black Sabbath’s rise was almost accidental. In 1968, Ozzy scribbled an ad that read “Ozzy Zig needs gig.” He found Iommi, Butler, and Ward, four factory boys marinated in Birmingham’s soot and gloom, and together they invented something the world hadn’t heard before: doom.Sabbath’s sound was unlike anything in rock at the time. Iommi’s guitar riffs were thick slabs of distortion, down-tuned to sound like machinery grinding in the dark. Geezer Butler’s bass didn’t just follow the guitar – it roared and throbbed, a counterpoint storm. Bill Ward fused jazz swing with sledgehammer beats, giving their heaviness an eerie groove. And Ozzy’s voice? It wasn’t angelic or operatic – it was a nasal, haunted chant, cutting through the sludge like a prophet warning of the apocalypse. This combination was so raw and otherworldly that it left the flower-power generation stunned and thrilled in equal measure.Their 1970 debut Black Sabbath – with its sinister tritone riff – was practically a séance. Then came Paranoid, an album that blended war paranoia, industrial despair, and existential horror into songs like War Pigs and Iron Man. Sabbath wasn’t peace and love; Sabbath was the sound of living through nightmares and learning to dance with them.The ripple effect was seismic. Without Sabbath, there would be no Metallica’s Master of Puppets, no Slayer’s Reign in Blood, no grunge sound of Alice in Chains or Nirvana’s darker edges. Even bands like Soundgarden, Iron Maiden, and Slipknot have Sabbath’s DNA stitched into their riffs. They didn’t just start a band; they started an entire language of music that countless artists still speak. Even Marvel’s Cinematic Universe might not have landed the same punch if “I Am Iron Man” hadn’t played when Tony Stark announced the arrival of the coolest superhero of them all.By the mid-70s, Sabbath were rock gods. But Ozzy, the self-destructive prince, was spiralling. His love affair with alcohol and drugs turned every tour into a circus of chaos. By 1979, the band fired him – a decision that could have ended his career. Instead, it marked the beginning of his wildest and most successful chapter.Fired, broke, and drowning in substances, Ozzy should have been a rock ‘n’ roll casualty. Instead, he turned into the genre’s greatest survivor – thanks to Sharon Arden (soon to be Sharon Osbourne ), who pulled him from the brink. She managed his career with iron resolve and cunning, building the Ozzy myth as both madman and messiah.The stories from this era read like biblical plagues crossed with drunken comedy sketches. The most infamous is the bat incident. In 1982, during a show in Des Moines, a fan threw a bat on stage. Ozzy, assuming it was rubber, bit its head off. It wasn’t rubber. Blood gushed. He was rushed for rabies shots – and a legend was born.Then there was the Alamo fiasco: a drunk Ozzy urinated on a cenotaph in San Antonio, earning a ten-year city ban. And the Mötley Crüe tour in 1984 – where, in a grotesque contest of dares, Ozzy reportedly snorted a line of ants and licked up a puddle of urine, leaving the band speechless. “Alright, Ozzy, you win,” Tommy Lee later said – a detail immortalized inand repeated by Lee himself, though guitarist Jake E. Lee disputes the “ants” part. Whatever the truth, the story has passed into heavy metal’s folklore.Ozzy didn’t just flirt with chaos; he signed a lifelong contract with it, took it on a drug-fuelled honeymoon, and still managed to write chart-toppers while it set fire to the hotel curtains. It was like Keith Richards , he had some imaginary pact with the devil.In 1980, Blizzard of Ozz exploded into the charts with Crazy Train and Mr. Crowley, proving Ozzy didn’t need Sabbath to remain metal’s high priest. Randy Rhoads, his guitarist, brought a neoclassical brilliance that elevated songs into anthems. Rhoads’ tragic death in a 1982 plane crash could have crushed Ozzy completely. Instead, it hardened him, fuelling Diary of a Madman and Bark at the Moon.By the 1990s, Ozzy’s reputation as the lovable lunatic of metal was solidified. No More Tears gave him another hit parade, with tracks like Mama, I’m Coming Home. His voice – nasal, haunted, indomitable – aged not like wine but like rusted steel: jagged, unyielding, unforgettable.Then came Ozzfest, a metal carnival that gave both legends and newcomers a stage. Ozzy, once the face of controversy, became metal’s benevolent elder. And then came The Osbournes, MTV’s reality show that introduced him as a hilariously foul-mouthed, bumbling family man, swearing at dogs and microwaves. The Prince of Darkness became America’s favourite sitcom dad – albeit one who bit bats.Though Sabbath had fired him in 1979, fate – and fan demand – brought them back together. In 2011, Ozzy reunited with Iommi and Butler for a new album, 13, which topped charts worldwide. Their farewell tour, aptly titled The End, concluded in 2017 in Birmingham, closing the circle where it all began.But Villa Park, July 5, 2025, was the true epilogue. The 76-year-old Ozzy, slowed by Parkinson’s, returned home for one last show titled Back to the Beginning. Seated on a towering black throne adorned with a giant bat, he performed with Sabbath in full force. When he growled “Let’s go crazy one last f**** time,” the 45,000 fans roared as if summoning every demon and angel he’d ever sung about. His voice – cracked, frail, but still otherworldly – soared over the crowd like it did in 1970.It was also fitting that the farewell happened in Villa Park – the same ground celebrated by Ozzy just last year when Aston Villa launched their new kit with a promotional video featuring him and Geezer Butler, soundtracked by Paranoid. For the working-class hero from Aston, football and metal were cut from the same cloth: raw, tribal, and electric.Many years ago, a man from Liverpool – murdered by a fanatic for not living according to the ethos of a popular song – wrote Working Class Hero, mocking society for crushing individuality. Ozzy, the son of Aston’s factories, embodied that rebellion. He never conformed – not to society, not to rock clichés, not to life or death. He lived on his terms, and he left on his terms, gifting us one last sermon of riffs and wails.Ozzy is gone, but the echo of his howl – that haunted, unrepentant scream – still vibrates through every heavy riff played today. Better clear some room, Lucifer, because hell is about to get a new frontman. The Prince of Darkness is coming home.","Ozzy’s voice was never operatic, never “clean” It was a cracked cathedral bell, wailing raw truth. With Black Sabbath, he didn’t just sing; he conjured fear.
