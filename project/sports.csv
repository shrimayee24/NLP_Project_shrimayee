Why India's Oscar entry matters in the age of amnesia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-indias-oscar-entry-matters-in-the-age-of-amnesia/articleshow/124189613.cms,"The premiere of Neeraj Ghaywan 's 'Homebound' felt like being inside an Instagram scroll. The film had just been selected as India's national submission to the Academy Awards. After its shiny world premiere at Cannes, it was being screened for guests in Juhu. People had turned out. It was hard to keep your eyes from resting too long on all of the very familiar, very-online faces.Two hours later, that feeling had changed into something like its reverse. The opposite of the content scroll - the ever-advancing feed of new information and images - is the act of pausing to remember.There are plenty of reasons 'Homebound' is so interesting. Many of them I'd known in advance: its origins in a news photo from 2020, and a later piece of reportage about that photo; that it came to be produced by Karan Johar, the poster-boy of louche Bollywood glamour and big-city liberalism, who put a cast of dewy young stars to work at portraying the hard lives of working-class India. That it somehow squeezed through the Censor Board, with only some forced cuts, to become India's official entry to the Oscars.The film is affecting, though, not because of its blockbuster treatment, but because it simply remembers - and lets us remember - in a way that feels increasingly rare. Its story first appeared in the form of a news photograph in May of 2020, in the middle of India's first pandemic lockdown. By the side of the highway, a man cradles his friend's head in his lap.The friend is sick, lying unconscious on the bare ground, and the young man is visibly bewildered. The two men, both in their early twenties, were Mohammad Saiyub and Amrit Kumar, one a Muslim and the other a Dalit Hindu.The image of their tender, stricken situation went viral. It was an intimate view of what many of us were watching from an emotional distance; the huge, forced exodus of working-class Indians out of cities, where their workplaces had been shuttered, onto the highways to try and find a way home. It drove home the private crises taking place within the masses of people on the move. It was also a rebuke to the script of Hindu-Muslim conflict that ran on endless repeat in the Indian media (which had already tried to report the pandemic's outbreak as a conspiracy: ""Corona Jihad"").Those bewildering early weeks of Covid, and the mass-exodus of Indians from urban centers, seemed like events we would never forget. Many events inthose years felt that way. Among privileged Indians, though, the memory of lockdown has dwindled into hazy, private reminiscences: about sleeping in late, and listening to podcasts while you swept your own floors.Covid as a national event - a collective crisis we all witnessed or experienced in one way or another - seems suppressed from collective memory. In March and April of 2022, for instance, we had experienced a near-unravelling of society during the second wave: people falling sick, with no route left to a hospital bed or any medical care. For a period, there was no way to meet a specialist, no way to fill a prescription, no oxygen to bring home; there were only dozens of hopeless phone numbers and registries. It was a traumatic event on a national scale.Yet this summer, the five-year anniversary of the first lockdown passed by us in eerie silence, without remark or remembrance. 'Homebound', arriving now, at the end of monsoon, is like a rush of oxygen to the brain. The act of remembering feels like an exceptional - in the sense of rare - phenomenon in our present lives. The twin engines of social media and 24x7 news drive our attention continuously to the present and the new. Breaking news used to reach us once or twice a day, in the morning paper or evening broadcast; now it arrives every minute of the day.As an asset to a democratic society, breaking news is highly overrated. It serves very little purpose to have news and information come at us without pause; without time to understand it, or even to properly feel anything about it. What is underrated is the opposite of breaking news: memory. But it's so hard to sustain a thought nowadays. How do we sustain our interest in what mattered to us five years, five hours ago or even five minutes ago? We're too busy being informed about everything to care about anything.Technology and media manufacture amnesia about even the largest, most destabilising events we've lived through together. They suppress collective memory, as if by design. Instead, we argue viciously about history and the ancient past. The political crises of 500 years ago are dragged into our view again and again, while the crises of five years disappear. The courage to reverse that is radical, even when it's hidden behind the bright lights of a big premiere.Karnad is an award-winning author","Neeraj Ghaywan's 'Homebound' was selected as India's national submission to the Academy Awards.

Poll Was the Super Over one of the most thrilling moments of the Asia Cup for you? Definitely! It was okay Not really

India secured a thrilling Super Over victory against Sri Lanka in their final Super Four match of the Asia Cup in Dubai on Wednesday, with Indian captain Suryakumar Yadav praising his team's character and particularly highlighting the performances of middle-order batsmen Sanju Samson , Tilak Varma, and bowler Arshdeep Singh 's composure in the decisive Super Over where Sri Lanka managed only two runs.The match, despite being a dead rubber, turned into an intense contest with both teams scoring over 200 runs, including a century from Sri Lanka's Pathum Nissanka.""It felt like a final and the boys showed a lot of character after the first half in the second innings. I told the boys to have good energy and let's see where we are at the end. To have that start with the bat, and someone like Sanju and Tilak taking that tempo was good to see. And for someone like Sanju, who is not opening the batting, and taking that responsibility and even Tilak showing great confidence, which was good to see,"" said Suryakumar during the post-match presentation.""Arshdeep has delivered for us the last 2-3 years. I told him to back his own plans and try to execute. He has been there in that situation many times and he has done really well for India and for his IPL side. His confidence says it all.None other than Arshdeep to bowl that Super Over,"" Suryakumar added.The Indian captain mentioned that some players experienced cramps due to heat but assured they would have a recovery day on Saturday before the finals.Sri Lankan captain Charith Asalanka acknowledged Nissanka's impressive century and remained positive despite their winless Super Four stage performance.""It was a fabulous game, and we were in the game until Varun and Kuldeep bowled those middle overs. It was unbelievable batting (from Nissanka), they have some extremely good bowlers and it was splendid to see him bat with that attacking approach. There were many positives from the Asia Cup. We have been playing good cricket, but unfortunately, we could not win in the last two games. As a captain, there are a lot of positives to take,"" Asalanka stated.After winning the toss, Sri Lanka chose to field first. India's innings saw early setbacks with Shubman Gill falling for 4 and captain Suryakumar scoring only 12 runs.Abhishek Sharma continued his outstanding form, scoring 61 off 31 balls with eight fours and two sixes, becoming the first batter to cross 300 runs in the T20I Asia Cup.The middle-order partnership between Tilak Varma (49 not out) and Sanju Samson (39) proved crucial, contributing a 66-run stand and helping India reach 202/5 in their 20 overs.Sri Lanka's chase began poorly with Kusal Mendis dismissed for a golden duck, but Pathum Nissanka and Kusal Perera launched a strong counter-attack.Nissanka scored a brilliant 107 off 58 balls, while Perera contributed 58 runs from 32 balls. Dasun Shanaka added a quick 22 runs, but the match ultimately went to a Super Over with both teams tied.In the bowling department, Kuldeep Yadav was India's most successful bowler with figures of 1/31, while Sri Lanka's Maheesh Theekshana and Wanindu Hasaranga each claimed one wicket.The Super Over saw Arshdeep Singh's exceptional bowling restrict Sri Lanka to just two runs while taking two wickets. India easily chased down the target in just one ball.Nissanka was awarded Player of the Match for his century.

Will Sunday’s Buccaneers vs Eagles matchup threaten Baker Mayfield’s winning streak, especially given his and other stars’ injuries?

(Comments via X post on Tampa Bay vs Philadelphia)

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ “questionable” status might play mind games with the Philadelphia Eagles

Also Read:

On September 27, NFL Insider Adam Schefter reported on X that three important Tampa Bay Buccaneers players were listed as questionable for Sunday’s matchup against the reigning Super Bowl champions—Philadelphia Eagles: quarterback Baker Mayfield (biceps), wide receiver Chris Godwin (ankle), and left tackle Tristan Wirfs (knee). Schefter added, “All are expected to play.” One fan replied, “Classic 'Questionable but expected to play' mind game! Even if they play, can Mayfield and Wirfs be 100% against that Eagles front?” Another fan countered, “No way they’re missing this one.” The last-minute declaration highlighted doubts about the players’ readiness and Mayfield’s pursuit of another win (fourth to be precise).The Tampa Bay Buccaneers, like the undefeated Philadelphia Eagles, are riding a 3-0 streak into Sunday’s high-stakes showdown. But the momentum faces a real test after NFL Insider Adam Schefter posted the questionable status of three key Tampa Bay players. Instantly, fans flooded social media with their valuable insights. One fan predicted the key players would suit up regardless: “Questionable’ status, but expect them to suit up anyway. ” Another fan said the nagging injuries could disrupt Tampa’s rhythm: “Their availability is crucial, but lingering injuries could still impact Tampa’s execution.”A third fan suggested that minor setbacks could leave the Buccaneers vulnerable against the Eagles' thriving defense: “Even slight limitations could impact execution and expose the Buccaneers to further injury against a strong Eagles defense.”A fan said that the “questionable” tag was only for playing mind games: “Missing Wirfs at left tackle against Philly's front 4 would be brutal, but Mayfield's quick release (2.4s avg) should help. Eagles rush has 12 sacks this year already. Questionable tags playing mind games here.” Another fan speculated that the Buccaneers’ questionable status might be setting the stage for a ready-made excuse if things go south: “Expected to play is NFL-speak for ""We want to make the Eagles plan for them, but we'll see how they feel during warmups. "" 🤫 Will Mayfield's bicep hold up against the Eagles' D-line, or is this just setting up the perfect, high-drama excuse if the Bucs struggle? 🤔 #QBvsPhillyD.” A third fan declared: “They all will play.”","Baker Mayfield, Chris Godwin, and Tristan Wirfs are listed as ""questionable"" for Sunday's Tampa Bay Buccaneers vs Philadelphia Eagles game.

Adele rumored to decline Super Bowl halftime show, but reports say she’s still in talks

Adele’s complicated history with the Super Bowl halftime stage



“The show is not about music,”

“can’t dance.”

The internet is buzzing with claims that Adele has “officially declined” the NFL ’s offer to headline the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show but the truth is a lot murkier. While some outlets are reporting she’s out, others insist she’s still in talks. The conflicting headlines have left fans confused and speculating about whether the Grammy-winning powerhouse will ever grace the biggest stage in sports.Social media lit up this week after several outlets claimed Adele turned down the halftime gig. The report suggests that the singer rejected the offer and it could be because of security concerns, citing fears about being targeted. These reports quickly went viral, fueling the narrative that Adele had walked away from the deal before it was finalized.But not everyone is convinced she’s out. Multiple sources report that Adele is still very much in discussions with the NFL and Roc Nation, which co-produces the halftime show. According to these outlets, talks are ongoing, and nothing has been officially confirmed. For now, it seems Adele’s status remains firmly in the “to be determined” category.This isn’t the first time Adele’s name has been tied to the Super Bowl.Back in 2016, she revealed that she was approached to perform but turned it down, saying she didn’t think the high-energy halftime format suited her style.she said at the time, adding that sheThat refusal is one reason fans are quick to believe fresh rumors about her walking away from the 2026 slot.For football fans and Swifties alike, the 2026 halftime show has been a hot topic. Rumors of Taylor Swift headlining had dominated the conversation earlier this year, only for Adele’s name to surface as the new frontrunner. With Adele now rumored to have declined, speculation is only intensifying about who will eventually take the stage at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara.Right now, Adele’s Super Bowl status is a mystery. While some outlets say she’s turned it down, others maintain she’s still negotiating. Until either Adele or the NFL makes an official statement, the only certainty is uncertainty. For now, fans will have to wait to see whether the global superstar decides to say yes to the world’s biggest halftime show or pass once again.Also read - Shane Tamura, the man who killed 4 at NFL headquarters, blamed the NFL in his suicide note — now medical examiners confirm he had CTE","Adele is rumored to have turned down the NFL's offer to headline the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show.

After Ireland, the NFL is set to host a game in Australia and probably in Asia

Deep ties of Steelers to Ireland led to Minnesota Vikings vs Pittsburgh Steelers at Croke Park on Sunday

Sunday’s matchup between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Minnesota Vikings marks the NFL ’s first regular-season game in Ireland’s Croke Park. Speaking at a small music venue near the city center in Dublin on Saturday, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell emphasized the league’s intent to pursue a global presence: “In today’s world, we have to be global. Every time we play an international game, fans say they want more. I really believe our game can be global. Our job is to share our game with the rest of the world.”NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has further outlined the global strategy, aiming for 16 games to be played internationally—so each NFL team could play at least one international match a year. For example, in February, Sarah Barshop of ESPN reported that the Los Angeles Rams will host a game in Australia during the 2026 season.Goodell said in a statement: “Expanding to Melbourne, Australia, a beautiful city with a rich sports history, underlines our ambitions to become a global sport and accelerate international growth. Together with the Victorian State Government, Visit Victoria and the Melbourne Cricket Ground, and with the Los Angeles Rams in 2026, we look forward to making history in what is an important market for the NFL and a significant next step in expanding our international footprint.On September 27, Brooke Pryor of ESPN reported that after the Australia event, Goodell indicated the NFL’s focus would shift to Asia: “I think our next step after Australia would be probably moving into Asia. That’s a continent we’d like to be playing in.”The Pittsburgh Steelers’ deep ties to Ireland contributed to their participation in Sunday’s game at Croke Park against the Minnesota Vikings.At a music venue near Dublin’s city center on Saturday, Goodell explained that the Steelers actively campaigned for the opportunity to play in Ireland and predicted the event’s success would lead to future returns: “The (Pittsburgh) Steelers were pushing very hard to get the Steelers over here (Ireland). I have no doubt this will be incredibly successful. And I have no doubt we’ll be back.”Steelers Owner and President Art Rooney II, who sat beside Goodell, added, “That’s a fair assessment.” The Rooney family migrated from the island, and the late Dan Rooney was the U.S. Ambassador to Ireland.","Sunday’s matchup between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Minnesota Vikings marks the NFL ’s first regular-season game in Ireland.

LeBron James enters 23rd NBA season after Los Angeles Lakers decline extension, forcing him to exercise his player option

LeBron James weighs retirement as L.A. Lakers grant him full control over his farewell journey

The 2025–2026 season will soon begin. Amidst all the excitement, the fresh rumors suggest that LeBron James might be retiring soon. The Los Angeles Lakers allegedly declined to re-sign the star this past summer. James attempted to sign an extension, but his team did not back his initiative during the offseason, according to Bleacher Report's Yaron Weitzman.The Lakers reportedly rejected LeBron James' request for an extension this summer, thus he was forced to exercise his player option. Yaron Weitzman said in the same article that James was reportedly certain that he wanted to extend his contract with the Los Angeles Lakers.Earlier this year, though, things did not turn out as planned. He was allegedly forced to exercise his $52.6 million player option as a result. One NBA source familiar with the situation said:“He obviously wanted an extension, and it's also clear that the Lakers wouldn't give it to him.”The news was further announced on X by Lake Show Yo and read:“LeBron James reportedly wanted an extension from the Lakers, but they weren't interested this summer, forcing him to pick up his player option, per @YaronWeitzman.”The Lakers appear to have made the decision to let James make his own decisions going forward. During a recent press conference, Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka , stated,""The first thing we want to do in terms of LeBron and his future is just give him absolute respect to choose his story with his family in terms of how many years he's going to continue to play.He's earned that right, and he's the best one to talk about that.""Towards the end, Pelinka added,""We would love if LeBron's story would be to retire as a Laker. That would be a positive story.""Having exercised his 2025-2026 player option, the final season of a two-year, $104 million deal with a no-trade clause, the winger will start his 23rd season in the league. The 21-time All-Star guided the Los Angeles Lakers to the third seed in the Western Conference during last season. This news, though, implies that the Lakers might reportedly lose the NBA legend.Meanwhile, Lakers officials have recently referred to LeBron's retirement plans and his future within the organization in a press conference. The comments suggested that LeBron is contemplating the next chapter in his life beyond basketball. Fans and commentators have been talking about this news a lot, with many voicing support and worry for LeBron's possible choice.Although he hasn't made a decision on his retirement date, the Lakers organization has granted him complete autonomy over his last decisions and whether or not he wishes to end his career as a Lakers player. James apparently intends to follow in Kobe Bryant 's footsteps and retire rather than follow in Michael Jordan's footsteps and move out of the team slowly.Bleacher Report's NBA writer Yaron Weitzman interviewed several league executives who are also close to James. They discussed with James the importance of storylines, his desire to avoid a quiet retirement like Michael Jordan, and his expectation of a farewell tour like Kobe Bryant .

TimesofIndia.com in Dubai:

India vs Pakistan Asia Cup final: The FIRST will be a very tense clash between arch-rivals

Poll Who do you think will win the Asia Cup final? India Pakistan

Former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif has stirred the debate ahead of the Asia Cup final, saying the India-Pakistan cricket rivalry will never end as long as the political tension between the two nations continues.“There will be rivalry. Jab tak jung hai tab tak cricket ki rivalry rahegi. Ye khatam nahi hogi (As long as there is war, there will be rivalry in cricket. It will not end),” he told TimesofIndia.com on the eve of the summit clash.“But yes, India will continue to win. That is not a problem. But rivalry will always be there. It will continue,” Latif said.Latif also took a sly dig at Team India captain Suryakumar Yadav , who, after winning against Pakistan in the Super Four clash, had said there is no rivalry between India and Pakistan anymore . “You guys (media) should stop asking about the rivalry. If the two teams are playing 15-20 games and the scoreline is 7-7 or 8-7, then it is called rivalry. If the scoreline is 10-1 or 13-0—I don’t know the exact number—but this is not a rivalry anymore,” Surya had said on September 21.Meanwhile, Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha strongly believes that they have saved their best for the final “There is always a lot of pressure on Pakistan and India when they play each other, and if we say that there is no pressure, then it is wrong. Both teams will have the same amount of pressure,” Salman said at the pre-final press conference in Dubai.“We have made more mistakes than them, and that is why we have not won matches.If we make fewer mistakes than them, we will win. Whichever team makes fewer mistakes will win, and we will try to make fewer mistakes.“Inshallah, you will see us winning tomorrow. Our attempt is to play our best cricket. And we know that if we play our best cricket and execute our plans for 40 overs, then we can beat any team. And we will try to do that.”Rashid Latif further added that the pressure of the marquee clash will always be heavier on India.“The disadvantage will be for India. India has everything to lose. Pakistan has nothing to lose; they are already underdogs. If Pakistan wins here, it will be very tough for the BCCI, and also for some players who have been very vocal about this tournament—be it the captain’s statement, the board’s stance, or Shubman Gill ’s tweet. There will be a lot of noise around that,” he remarked.Latif admitted that while India holds the edge in terms of skill and temperament, the unpredictability of T20 cricket leaves the contest wide open. “India is ahead in terms of skills. They can take pressure. But this is a T20 game. Anyone can win. So it is going to be a tough match,” he said.",Former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif has stirred the debate ahead of the Asia Cup final.

Beware Pakistan! Abhishek Sharma hits massive sixes in the nets

told TimesofIndia.com

He used to go to the ground at 7am, but his day started at 4. By the time he was facing bowlers, his concentration level was high Abhishek Sharma's father

Asia Cup 2025 leading run-scorers (before final):

Abhishek Sharma - 309 runs from six innings

Pathum Nissanka - 261 runs from six innings

Saif Hassan - 178 runs from four innings

Sahibazada Farhan - 160 runs from six innings

Kusal Perera - 146 runs from six innings

Tilak Varma - 144 runs from five innings

A couple of days ago, Abhishek Sharma posted a reel on Instagram with the caption ""safal kyunki sabr bahut ae"" (Successful because of lots of patience). As the adage goes, ""Rome was not built in a day.""The story of Abhishek Sharma has been similar. He was not a breakout star like his fellow teammates Shubman Gill and Prithvi Shaw. He was drafted into the Punjab senior team right after the U-19 World Cup, but he was not elegant enough, not someone you loved to watch in the nets.The senior Punjab bowlers back then used to tease him that they could get him out with the new ball in three deliveries. They often did and bullied him as well, but in Yuvraj Singh , Abhishek found a mentor.These days, old videos of Yuvraj training Abhishek and Shubman during Covid are doing the rounds.Before the start of the ongoing Asia Cup , Rajkumar Sharma, Abhishek's father, revealed to TimesofIndia.com the routine the former India all-rounder had given his son: ""There was a timetable. When I first had a look at it, I asked him, 'Will you be able to follow this?' He hesitantly said, ‘Paji ne diya hai, karna toh hoga’ (Yuvraj Singh has given it to me, I will have to follow this).""In the timetable, there were clear instructions: he must get up at 4am, meditate for half an hour, swim for 45 minutes in cold water, go to the gym, and only then head to the ground.""He used to go to the ground at 7am, but his day started at 4. By the time he was facing bowlers, his concentration level was so high that he started picking lengths cleanly,"" Abhishek Sharma’s fatherwhen he visited Team India’s practice session at the ICC Cricket Academy ahead of their Super Four clash against Pakistan.Abhishek burst onto the scene as a destroyer in IPL 2024, where he scored 484 runs in 16 matches at a strike rate of 204.22. He became the first batter to pile up more than 400 runs without even facing 30 balls in a single innings.But it was his bat swing that caught everyone's attention.Earlier, even in T20Is, hitting on the up was considered the domain of classical greats — remember Virat Kohli ’s six off Haris Rauf at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in the 2022 T20 World Cup — an art admired as a notch above mere power-hitting. Abhishek started dismantling that notion with ease. His method is so simple that, in hindsight, the results from his handful of games hardly seem surprising.Yuvraj Singh wanted Abhishek to play golf. The Amritsar-born was hesitant to try it at first. There was a fear of failure — what if he was not good at it? It took Brian Lara to convince him that it would help him hit more sixes.""The six-hitting part he liked, so he started playing the sport,"" said Rajkumar Sharma.In golf, Yuvraj worked on his stance, and with months of practice Abhishek perfected it, enhancing his bat swing.""Lara had told him that playing golf would help him concentrate better and would also be helpful in picking lengths,"" said Sharma senior.Abhishek opens with Travis Head for Sunrisers Hyderabad, under captain Pat Cummins . This is where the Australian mindset of ""fear none, let them fear you"" was instilled in him.""Pat Cummins told him, ‘I want every bowler in this tournament to fear you. Don’t be afraid of getting out. Don’t target the boundary ropes, target the stands.’ The confidence shown by Cummins erased the fear of failure in him,"" said his father.The Asia Cup has proved to be a coming-of-age tournament for Abhishek Sharma. Opponents fear him; his explosive batting has become the talk of the tournament.He is the leading run-getter with 309 runs. The second-best is Pathum Nissanka with 261 runs. The next-best Indian batter is Tilak Varma with 144 runs. He is the only batter with a strike rate over 200 (204.64).He has become an enforcer and a nightmare for bowlers. But the secret of his success is ""sabr"" (patience), though with the willow, he is a destructor — ask any bowler in this tournament.And as his mentor Yuvraj said in a video to him: ""Tu na sudhri bas, chakke maari jaaye, thalle na kheli"" (You are not going to listen… you only keep hitting sixes, try hitting along the ground too).","Abhishek Sharma was not a breakout star like his fellow teammates Shubman Gill and Prithvi Shaw. He was drafted into the Punjab senior team right after the U-19 World Cup, but he was not elegant enough. Yuvraj Singh worked on his stance and perfected his bat swing.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124188455,imgsize-116580,width-400,resizemode-4/india-v-bangladesh-asia-cup.jpg"

Hill faces pivotal moments this week as Dolphins seek season turnaround

For Miami Dolphins star wide receiver Tyreek Hill, family came first this weekend. Just two days before a high-pressure Monday Night Football clash against the New York Jets, the 31-year-old pass catcher stepped away from the team to honor a personal milestone: the 50th wedding anniversary of his parents, Anesha Sanchez and Derrick Shaw. The gesture offered a rare glimpse into the human side of one of football’s flashiest playmakers, as he chose to celebrate a lifetime of love and loyalty while the Dolphins wrestle with a rocky 0-3 start.Tyreek Hill later shared on Snapchat that he missed practice to celebrate his parents’ golden wedding anniversary. He shared tender family moments that captured the joy of the occasion. In one post, he wrote “celebrating 50 years of marriage 🥺,” showing pride and emotion. Another post had him “wedding ready,” hinting at the festive preparations, while a third snapshot highlighted “Pops big day,” showing the playful and warm bond between Tyreek and his father. Fans got a rare, personal glimpse into the milestone that meant so much to Hill and his family.Although Hill’s absence was personal, concerns remain about his health. He has battled minor oblique and calf injuries through September but has played through discomfort, proving critical for quarterback Tua Tagovailoa and the struggling Dolphins offense.His durability will be closely watched as Miami looks to avoid slipping to 0-4 heading into a key Week 4 matchup.Miami has stumbled out of the gate, making Hill’s presence even more crucial. Head coach Mike McDaniel and the team rely on Hill’s speed and explosive playmaking to spark the offense against a revitalized Jets team led by Justin Fields. The outcome of Monday Night Football could hinge on Hill’s ability to deliver in a must-win scenario.The weekend highlighted Hill’s challenge of juggling personal milestones with professional expectations. Celebrating his parents’ golden anniversary offered a rare moment of stillness for a player often defined by speed, spectacle, and high-stakes pressure. It underscored the values of loyalty and gratitude that extend beyond the football field.As Monday Night Football approaches, Hill stands at the intersection of personal and professional stories. At home, he celebrated a family legacy spanning five decades; on the field, he must help Miami escape early-season turbulence.

Fred Warner continues to anchor 49ers defense despite fine



49ers look ahead to Jaguars showdown with Fred Warner leading the charge



Linebacker Fred Warner’s blazing start to the season hit a small bump when the NFL announced a hefty $23,186 fine for a helmet-to-helmet hit in the San Francisco 49ers’ narrow 16-15 victory over the Arizona Cardinals in Week 3. The fine, the largest issued that week, came after Warner tackled Cardinals running back James Conner, an action flagged under the league’s player safety rules.At 28, Fred Warner has grown into the heartbeat of San Francisco’s defense. According to NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero, several defenders were penalized for similar infractions in Week 3, but Warner’s stood out for its size. While the fine won’t lead to suspension, it marked the third of his career and the biggest yet, topping the two he absorbed in the 2024-25 season.The All-Pro linebacker signed a three-year, $63 million extension this offseason, further cementing his role as the team’s defensive cornerstone. Through three games this year, Warner has already tallied 30 tackles, a forced fumble, and a recovery, continuing a trend of consistent production since his arrival as a third-round pick in 2018. His track record speaks for itself: 118-plus tackles in every season, 16 forced fumbles, seven recoveries, and a knack for disrupting passing lanes with 56 passes defended.Warner’s fine might sting financially, but it won’t deter his impact on the field. With Nick Bosa sidelined for the year, Warner’s leadership and playmaking are more critical than ever for the 49ers’ playoff hopes.San Francisco now shifts its focus to a Week 4 clash with the Jacksonville Jaguars. The Jaguars, looking to keep pace in the AFC South, have already sparked headlines after defensive coordinator Robert Saleh suggested the team found a way to read opponents’ signals—a claim head coach Kyle Shanahan later diffused.The storyline only adds spice to a matchup where Warner’s presence will be pivotal. The 49ers are determined to stay unbeaten, and their captain in the middle has shown no signs of slowing down despite the fine.Also Read: Russell Wilson trade rumors explode as report claims Giants quarterback now a prime deadline candidate","Fred Warner fined $23,186 for helmet-to-helmet hit in 49ers' win over Cardinals.

Patrick Mahomes ’ touching gift snatched away by a Giants fan

Internet backlash grows as fan community rallies around the child

The Kansas City Chiefs finally found their rhythm in Week 3, defeating the New York Giants 22-9 at MetLife Stadium. But while Patrick Mahomes delivered on the field, it was his gesture after the game that stole headlines—and not in the way fans hoped. A moment meant to celebrate a child turned sour thanks to a viral act now being blasted across the internet.After sealing the win, Patrick Mahomes approached the stands and tried to make a young Chiefs fan’s day unforgettable by handing over his thermal throwing sleeve, a personal piece of gear he uses during cold-weather games. The child, decked out in Kansas City gear, was visibly excited—until the unexpected happened.In a scene that echoed the infamous “Phillies Karen” incident earlier this month, a Giants supporter swiped the sleeve out of the boy’s hands. Video footage captured the child’s reaction, shouting, “You stole that from me!” as the unidentified fan in Giants colors pulled the keepsake away.The clip spread quickly across social media, sparking outrage from football fans everywhere. One user called it “straight clown behavior, stealing from a kid,” while another said bluntly, “Wow, what a loser move.”Though the individual’s face wasn’t caught on camera, the online community has made it clear they won’t let the incident slide. Comments flooded X (formerly Twitter ), Reddit, and Instagram , with many users labeling the fan “Giants Karen” and calling for him to be identified.The backlash highlights a growing intolerance toward bad fan behavior, especially after several recent viral incidents at major sporting events.

Russell Wilson benched, but trade market looms



Russell Wilson trade rumors gaining momentum



The New York Giants have turned the page on their 0-3 start by benching veteran quarterback Russell Wilson in favor of rookie Jaxson Dart. Head coach Brian Daboll made the decision after Wilson’s two-interception outing in Sunday’s loss to the Kansas City Chiefs, a performance that highlighted the team’s need for a spark under center. While Wilson has vowed to mentor Dart, his future in New York is suddenly in question.Wilson completed 59.1% of his passes for 778 yards, three touchdowns, and three interceptions across three games. His Week 2 performance against Dallas, where he threw for 450 yards and three scores in an overtime thriller, reminded fans he can still deliver at a high level. But inconsistency and turnovers ultimately pushed the Giants toward Dart.Despite the benching, Wilson has kept a positive outlook. “I know that I'm going to respond in the right way every day,” he said, adding, “I'm not done.” The 36-year-old also dismissed speculation that he would request his release. “No, I'm focused on helping this team win. I wanna be here. I love this organization.”Still, reports from NFL Network insiders Ian Rapoport and Mike Garafolo indicate that Wilson is a strong trade candidate ahead of the Nov.4 deadline. His one-year, $10.5 million deal carries a manageable cap hit, making him a realistic option for quarterback-needy teams. In contrast, fellow trade target Kirk Cousins is attached to a far more expensive contract in Atlanta.Quarterback injuries have already hit contenders across the league, including the Bengals, Vikings, Commanders, and 49ers.

The MAGA hat that blurred the lines between football and politics

Bill Belichick and Robert Kraft faced tough choices amid growing scrutiny

A dynasty preserved, but not without scars

The New England Patriots dynasty is remembered for its discipline, dominance, and relentless pursuit of victory. But behind the scenes, even one small gesture nearly jeopardized the fragile chemistry that kept Tom Brady, Bill Belichick, and Robert Kraft aligned. That moment came when a red “Make America Great Again” hat surfaced in Brady’s locker.The hat, gifted to Brady by Kraft, was meant as nothing more than a friendly token, according to author Gary Myers in Brady vs. Belichick: The Dynasty Debate. Still, the timing and political symbolism turned it into a lightning rod. “When Tom realized that it had the potential to cause friction in the locker room, he immediately took it down,” Myers explained.In a sport where team unity is sacred, the hat’s presence—even for a short time—sent ripples through the locker room. The Patriots had thrived by keeping outside noise away, but now questions of political affiliation loomed over a team that never wanted politics tied to its brand.Kraft’s ties to Trump were personal. After the passing of his wife Myra in 2011, Trump became a source of comfort. “Trump was really a true friend to him,” Myers noted.But as Trump’s presidency grew more polarizing, that friendship became harder to navigate publicly.Belichick faced his own political crossroads in 2021 when he was set to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom days after the Capitol riot. Veteran safety Devin McCourty delivered a blunt warning: “You are basically going to lose the team if you do that.” Belichick listened, declining the award—a move Myers called “a very smart decision.”The Patriots survived the controversy, but the incident underscored how easily outside factors can strain even the most dominant locker rooms. Myers summed it up by saying, “I am pretty certain that if you took a vote of the Patriot locker room... he wouldn’t have won the popular vote in any of those,” pointing to a divide between the players and the leadership’s ties.Also Read: “Not going to get married”: Bill Belichick faces backlash for refusing to commit to Jordon Hudson The MAGA hat might seem like a footnote in history, but in the crucible of the Patriots’ dynasty, it was a reminder that even symbols can test loyalty, unity, and the delicate balance that fuels greatness.",A MAGA hat in Tom Brady's locker threatened New England Patriots' unity.

Gilbert Arenas blames Taylor Swift for Travis Kelce’s slow start and Patrick Mahomes’ struggles with the Kansas City Chiefs

Gilbert Arenas RETURNS To The Arena to Preview Week 4

Brittany Mahomes, wife of Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes , shared a viral Instagram video of her three kids ahead of a pivotal Week 4 game. Brittany posted a clip of 4-year-old Sterling behind the wheel of a luxury mini car with baby Golden in the passenger seat and 2-year-old Bronze riding in the back. She captioned the video “too blessed” as the siblings cruised through the Mahomes’ home.The post comes as the Chiefs prepare for a critical matchup against the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday night at Arrowhead Stadium. Kansas City is 1-2 and risks falling to 1-3 if it loses, a scenario that could threaten its bid for a 10th straight AFC West title. Brittany, who recently turned 30 and celebrated with friends including Taylor Swift , has stayed busy balancing game days and parenting while Patrick tries to stabilize a shaky start to the season.Kansas City’s slow start has made Sunday night’s game feel like a must-win. A loss would leave the defending division champions chasing the standings in October. The Baltimore Ravens arrive with the same 1-2 record after losing on Monday night but still bring a physical defense and a hungry roster.Former NFL quarterback Derek Carr said on the “Home Grown Network,” “I got the Ravens… You do not think that there is some toughness in that building that has been established.”The comment reflects a growing belief that Baltimore’s defense and rushing attack could push around Kansas City if the Chiefs do not find rhythm.Patrick Mahomes has faced uneven offensive production. Wide receivers Rashee Rice and Xavier Worthy have been unavailable due to injuries, forcing Mahomes to lean heavily on Travis Kelce , who has started slow. The star tight end dropped a key pass that became a late interception in a 20-17 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles last week and was caught in a sideline confrontation with head coach Andy Reid during the Week 3 win over the New York Giants.Former NBA player Gilbert Arenas added fuel to the narrative surrounding Kansas City’s offense. On his show “The Arena Gridiron,” Arenas said, “[Mahomes] lost his tight end to a woman. … Kelce done lost his name. The Gen Zs know him as what? Taylor Swift’s boyfriend.”Taylor Swift has been tied to any dip in Travis Kelce’s performance since their relationship became public in 2023. Kelce has 10 catches for 134 yards and one touchdown through three games, far below his usual pace. Arenas pointed out that Patrick Mahomes is missing key targets and operating with a depleted receiving group, making the offense easier to defend.The Chiefs need both Mahomes and Kelce to deliver against the Ravens to avoid a damaging 1-3 start. Fans will be watching Arrowhead Stadium closely Sunday night, and waiting to see if Brittany shares another family moment as her husband tries to keep Kansas City’s season alive.","Brittany Mahomes shared a viral Instagram video of her three kids ahead of a pivotal Week 4 game.

“Keegan has done a nice job of bringing everyone in as a big family. There's a lot of warm and fuzzy feelings on that front.”

Team USA is fired up and rallied behind captain Keegan Bradley as the 2025 Ryder Cup plays out at Bethpage Black. Players, such as Xander Schauffele, have lauded Bradley's strategic moves and leadership style, which they say can clearly see the path to victory.Team USA's captain since July 2024 and for the Ryder Cup, Keegan Bradley, is wise beyond his years. He is the youngest American captain since Arnold Palmer in 1963 at age 39. Bradley told The Post that his bond with Bethpage Black, which he visited during college, played a big part in shaping the team's approach. Being so familiar with the course allows him to devise specific game plans for various players and should give Team USA an advantage.Bradley made several big calls, one of them being the six captain's picks he chose Collin Morikawa, Cameron Young, Sam Burns, and the like. His selections suggest a desire to build an aligned team rather than depend only on history. He didn't even choose himself as a player, bringing home his focus on captaincy and winning the tournament.Also Read: Xander Schauffele net worth in 2025: How the golf star built his multi-million dollar fortune One of the best in the sport, Xander Schauffele, who is also an automatic qualifier for the U.S.team, has been effusive in his praise for Bradley.
