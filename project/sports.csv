NEW DELHI: Jonny Bairstow's scintillating century propelled Punjab Kings to a record-breaking chase against Kolkata Knight Riders in the 42nd match of IPL 2024. The English wicketkeeper-batsman's unbeaten 108 off just 48 balls, along with vital contributions from Shashank Singh (68* off 28) and Prabhsimran Singh (54 off 20), helped Punjab overhaul the daunting target of 262 with ease.Earlier in the evening, Sunil Narine (71 off 32 balls) and Phil Salt (75 off 37 balls) had set the stage ablaze with their explosive batting, putting the Punjab bowlers under immense pressure in the sweltering Kolkata heat.However, little did Shreyas Iyer and his team anticipate the carnage that would unfold later that night, as Bairstow and his teammates unleashed a barrage of 24 sixes to stun the home crowd and secure a memorable victory.The race for the IPL 2024 Orange Cap has become increasingly competitive. Virat Kohli, in sublime form, breached the 400-run mark and currently leads the charts with 430 runs. Sunil Narine's blistering knock against Punjab Kings propelled him to the second spot with 357 runs, while Ruturaj Gaikwad's recent century elevated him to third place with 349 runs.Rishabh Pant's captaincy and batting prowess have been on full display, as he occupies the fourth position with 342 runs from 9 innings, followed closely by Sudharsan, who has amassed 334 runs in the same number of IPL 2024 matches.As IPL 2024 heads towards its decisive phase, the battle for the prestigious Orange Cap is poised to escalate. With each match presenting an opportunity for players to shine and elevate their standings, spectators can anticipate a series of gripping clashes and outstanding displays of skill, promising an exhilarating climax to the premier T20 cricket extravaganza.",IPL Orange Cap 2024 is the largest in the world. IPL will be the first Indian team to play in the Champions League. The team will be based in New Delhi and will be known as the IPL Orange Caps. The cap will be worth an estimated $1.2 billion.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109619106,imgsize-35122,width-400,resizemode-4/109619106.jpg"

Both Kuldeep and T Natarajan, currently ranked fifth, have claimed an impressive 12 wickets each in just six innings, showcasing their prowess with spin and pace, respectively. They are hot on the heels of Jasprit Bumrah, who has 13 wickets to his name in eight innings.The IPL 2024 season witnessed a historic moment when Yuzvendra Chahal became the first bowler to reach the 200-wicket milestone in the tournament during Rajasthan Royals' match against Mumbai Indians.As the IPL 2024 season progresses, the Purple Cap race remains fiercely competitive, with Harshal Patel leading the charge, closely followed by Bumrah and Chahal with 13 wickets each.

"Yesterday IPL Match Highlights: Rajasthan take 'royal' stride towards play-off, beat Lucknow Super Giants by 7 wickets",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/lsg-vs-rr-ipl-2024-highlights-rajasthan-take-royal-stride-towards-play-off-beat-lucknow-super-giants-by-7-wickets/articleshow/109653861.cms,"(With inputs from PTI)

NEW DELHI: Sanju Samson 's unbeaten 71 off 33 balls, which included four stylish sixes, had a significantly greater impact than his counterpart KL Rahul 's more measured 76 off 48 balls as the Rajasthan Royals comfortably defeated the Lucknow Super Giants by seven wickets on Saturday. This victory was crucial for the Royals as they made a significant step towards the IPL playoffs.While Rahul remains the favorite to be Rishabh Pant's backup wicketkeeper for the T20 World Cup, Samson's performance, including hitting the winning six in a chase of 197, keeps him in contention for a spot on the flight to the US.Samson and Jurel came together when the Royals lost momentum after a strong start, forming a solid partnership of 121 runs in just 62 balls for the unbeaten fourth wicket, guiding their team to victory.Despite facing a challenging target of 197 with LSG using seven bowlers, including two leg-spinners, Rajasthan finished at 199 for three, securing the win with an over to spare.On his part, the young Jurel finally discovered his mojo to put behind a barren run, smacking five fours and two sixes to make a sturdy 52 not out off 34 balls.The win took top-placed Rajasthan to 16 points — six clear from the second-best Kolkata Knight Riders — and a step closer to become the first team to reach the playoffs in the 17th edition. The play-offs cut-off this year is likely to be 18 points if one goes by the current mid-table muddle.LSG remained on fourth spot with 10 points in bag.Rajasthan openers Yashasvi Jaiswal (24) and Jos Buttler (34) knocked off 60 runs from the target unscathed, but their side went through a slump in the following overs while also losing three wickets in quick succession.It began with Buttler walking across his stumps to miss an angled full toss from Thakur, who knocked down the leg-stump for the first breakthrough.Marcus Stoinis bowled an innocuous delivery outside off to invite a free-flowing Jaiswal to go for it. The left-hander obliged but did not connect well, finding Bishnoi at deep point.LSG's plans to tie the Royals down with leg-spin became evident when the 41-year-old Amit Mishra came on as impact substitute and got the priced scalp of Riyan Parag (11) in his first over.Rajasthan slipped from 60 for no loss to 78/3 after nine, and this was when Jurel and Samson began their recovery work to put Rajasthan back on track again.Jurel and Samson began with a six and a four respectively off Mishra to push the leg-spinner on the backfoot and took 17 runs off Thakur's second over.Krunal Pandya (0/24) did well on his part to send down a few measly overs in between but RR were back on charge again when Mohsin Khan came on in the 14th over.Jurel hit the left-armer for 20 runs including three fours and a six in Mohsin's third of the game and also enjoyed a reprieve when Thakur, placed at short third man, dropped a crucial catch when the RR batter was on 32.Bishnoi's introduction as late as in the 16th over had no impact whatsoever, with RR having grasped full control of the proceedings. The leg-spinner leaked another 16 runs as RR inched closer to the finish line.Earlier in the first half, Rahul (76 off 48 balls) dug deep with Deepak Hooda (50 off 31 balls) as Lucknow Super Giants managed a competitive 196/5 against Rajasthan Royals.Rahul and Hooda gave LSG a solid footing with a 62-ball 115-run stand for the third wicket after early blows, but the failure of others meant the hosts could not capitalise on the hard work by the two.Rahul's 48-ball 76 with eight fours and two sixes was his fourth fifty of the season while Hooda banished his poor string of scores to make his first big score this IPL.","Rajasthan Royals beat Lucknow Super Giants by seven wickets in IPL.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Capitals (DC) are set to take on Mumbai Indians (MI) in the 43rd match of the Indian Premier League on Saturday. DC currently occupy the sixth spot on the points table, having secured four victories in nine games. Meanwhile, MI find themselves in the ninth position, with only three wins to their name.Delhi Capitals have had an inconsistent run this season, but they have managed to win three out of their last four matches, which has propelled them to the sixth place on the points table.A victory against MI would significantly boost their chances of making it to the playoffs. On the other hand, Mumbai Indians had a dismal start to the season but managed to turn their fortunes around by winning three out of their next four games.However, their momentum was halted by a devastating loss against Rajasthan Royals. With MI currently struggling in eighth place, they cannot afford to lose any more matches. Rishabh Pant's form has been a major positive for DC, as he continues to improve with each passing game.His exceptional wicket-keeping abilities and fearless batting have played a crucial role in the team's success. Pant's recent unbeaten match-winning innings against Gujarat Titans highlighted his aggressive style of play, putting him in a strong position to secure a spot in India's T20 World Cup squad.In the history of the IPL , Delhi Capitals and Mumbai Indians have squared off in a total of 34 matches. Among these encounters, MI have emerged victorious on 19 occasions, showcasing their dominance in the head-to-head battle. On the other hand, DC have secured 15 wins, highlighting their competitive edge in this fierce rivalry within the tournament.In the last 10 IPL matches at the Arun Jaitley Stadium, the statistics portray a notable trend favouring teams batting first, with 8 out of 10 matches being won by the team setting the target. This indicates a significant advantage for teams winning the toss and opting to bat, possibly due to the conditions or the nature of the pitch at the venue.The average first innings score at the Arun Jaitley Stadium stands impressively high at 224.5 runs, underlining the venue's tendency to produce high-scoring encounters. Moreover, the average winning first innings score further emphasizes the importance of setting a formidable target, with teams often needing to surpass the 230-run mark to secure victory.Analyzing the batting performances in specific phases of the game, the average powerplay score registers at 58.8 runs, suggesting an aggressive start by teams in the initial overs. Meanwhile, the average score in the death overs indicates a slightly lower scoring rate at 56 runs, indicating that while teams may start strong, they face some challenges in accelerating towards the end of their innings at this venue.The pitch at the Arun Jaitley Stadium is anticipated to uphold its reputation as a batsman's paradise, echoing the trends observed in the preceding two matches held at the venue. With conducive conditions for batting, both teams can expect opportunities to build substantial innings and post competitive totals on the scoreboard.However, as this particular encounter between Delhi Capitals and Mumbai Indians is scheduled as a day game, there's a likelihood that the wicket might exhibit signs of gradual wear and tear as the match progresses.This could result in the pitch slowing down over time, posing challenges for stroke-making and requiring batsmen to adapt their strategies accordingly.1. Given the favourable conditions for batting at the Arun Jaitley Stadium, selecting top-order batsmen who excel in scoring runs and can anchor the innings could yield valuable fantasy points. Players like Rohit Sharma , Suryakumar Yadav, and Prithvi Shaw are prime candidates who have the ability to capitalize on the batting-friendly pitch and accumulate significant runs for their respective teams.2. As the pitch is expected to slow down over time, it's crucial to consider all-rounders who can contribute with both bat and ball, adapting to the changing conditions. Players like Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel possess the versatility to excel in such scenarios, making them valuable fantasy picks. Their ability to contribute with both bat and ball, along with their adaptability, could result in crucial fantasy points.Prithvi Shaw, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Abishek Porel, Shai Hope, Rishabh Pant (c/wk), Tristan Stubbs, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Anrich Nortje/Jhye Richardson, Khaleel Ahmed, Mukesh Kumar.Rasikh SalamIshan Kishan (wk), Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya (c), Tim David, Nehal Wadhera, Mohammad Nabi, Gerald Coetzee, Piyush Chawla, Jasprit Bumrah.Nuwan ThusharaIPL 2024 Stats: 303 Runs in 8 MatchesIn the IPL 2024 season, Rohit Sharma of the Mumbai Indians showcased his batting prowess, accumulating 303 runs across 8 matches. As a key figure in the Mumbai Indians lineup, Sharma's consistent contributions played a vital role in the team's campaign, demonstrating his ability to anchor innings and deliver impactful performances in the fiercely competitive tournament. (Here's a list of updated Orange Cap list) IPL 2024 Stats: 140 runs in 5 MatchesSuryakumar Yadav, representing the Mumbai Indians in IPL 2024, amassed 140 runs in 5 matches leading up to the clash against Delhi Capitals. Known for his aggressive yet composed batting style, Yadav's contributions were instrumental in bolstering Mumbai's batting lineup, providing vital runs and stability in the middle order during the tournament's crucial stages.IPL 2024 Stats: 12 Wickets in 6 MatchesKuldeep Yadav, representing the Delhi Capitals in IPL 2024, showcased his bowling prowess with 12 wickets in 6 matches ahead of the encounter against Mumbai Indians.

IPL 2024: Chennai Super Kings up against Sunrisers Hyderabad in a clash of philosophies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/ipl-2024-chennai-super-kings-up-against-sunrisers-hyderabad-in-a-clash-of-philosophies/articleshow/109658705.cms,"|

CHENNAI: It will be a battle of philosophies when Chennai Super Kings take on Sunrisers Hyderabad in a crucial game at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Sunday.While SRH is a team that prefers to go berserk right from the word go, CSK believe in building a platform before launching into late onslaught.Sunrisers, under the coach-captain duo of Daniel Vettori and Pat Cummins , have opted for a ""brave"" brand of batting and stuck to their approach even when they were in trouble during the recent loss to Royal Challengers Bengaluru at home.Cummins admitted that the high-risk batting method is ""not going to work all the time"", but believes that every team is ""terrified"" when they take on SRH. Sunrisers spin-bowling coach Muttiah Muralitharan, on Saturday, echoed Cummins' words.""We want our players to play with freedom. Whether we win or not, we want them to do their bit. Their intention has to be right. The opposition will do whatever they can to stop us, so sometimes they will be better. Whether we get all out for 50 or score as many as 300, we are going to play that brand,"" said Muralitharan.There is every reason for CSK to be worried, given the might of Sunrisers, who have posted four 200plus scores this season. With boundary-hitting machines Abhishek Sharma, Travis Head and Heinrich Klaasen-all three are in the top-15 in the 'most sixes' chart-in their ranks, SRH have a fearsome batting line-up. The CSK bowling pack may have to produce something out of the ordinary to prevent the visitors from going about their business.The leader of the pack is definitely Head, who can absolutely run away with the game if he gets going. RCB, on Thursday, got him early with offie Will Jacks bowling to him in the powerplay and turning the ball away from the left-hander after pitching it well outside the off-stump.It would be interesting to see if CSK adopt a similar approach with Moeen Ali, who has the ability to turn the ball.For CSK, a lot could rest on the shoulders of slinger Matheesha Pathirana and Ravindra Jadeja , two bowlers with an X-factor. It will be crucial that they keep chipping with wickets in the middle phase.","Chennai Super Kings take on Sunrisers Hyderabad in a crucial game on Sunday.

Alejandra Rodriguez makes history as the first 60-year-old Miss Universe Buenos Aires,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/alejandra-rodriguez-makes-history-as-the-first-60-year-old-miss-universe-buenos-aires/articleshow/109654801.cms,"WASHINGTON: Alejandra Rodriguez , a 60-year-old lawyer and journalist hailing from La Plata, Argentina, has etched her name in history by clinching the coveted title of Miss Universe Buenos Aires.This remarkable feat marks a paradigm shift in the realm of beauty pageants, as Rodriguez becomes the first contestant of her age bracket to secure the esteemed crown, reported People magazine.Defying conventional beauty norms, Rodriguez emerged triumphant among 34 competitors spanning a wide age range from 18 to 73. Her victory not only symbolises personal accomplishment but also embodies a broader message of inclusivity and diversity within the beauty pageant circuit.“I am thrilled to be representing this new paradigm in beauty pageants because we are inaugurating a new stage in which women are not only physical beauty but another set of values,” Rodriguez said, according to a statement obtained by People magazine. Her win underscores a shift towards recognising and celebrating a broader spectrum of attributes beyond physical appearance.With her sights set on the forthcoming Miss Universe Argentina pageant scheduled for May 25, Rodriguez remains undeterred in her pursuit of further accolades. Should she emerge victorious, she will advance to compete for the illustrious Miss Universe title slated for September, marking a significant milestone in her journey. Rodriguez's ascent to prominence coincides with a pivotal decision by the Miss Universe Organization in Sept 2023 to eliminate age restrictions for contestants. This progressive move has opened doors for women of all ages to participate, ushering in a new era of inclusivity and representation within the pageant community. Undeterred by age constraints, Rodriguez remains steadfast in her determination to vie for the crown of Miss Universe Argentina 2024.Reflecting on her journey, she said, “I think the judges saw my confidence and my passion to represent the women of my generation.” In tandem with Rodriguez's groundbreaking achievement, other women are also making waves in the pageant arena, transcending age barriers to vie for coveted titles. Haidy Cruz, aged 47, is set to represent the Dominican Republic in the upcoming 2024 pageant, slated to take place in Mexico City later this year, People magazine reported.","Alejandra Rodriguez, 60, clinched the coveted title of Miss Universe Buenos Aires.

After that, if you take one more spinner then the contest is between Ravi Bishnoi and Yuzvendra Chahal.

NEW DELHI: Lionel Messi 's scoring streak in MLS continued as he netted twice in Inter Miami 's 4-1 comeback victory against New England Revolution on Saturday. The league's top scorer now has nine goals in seven appearances this season.A massive crowd of over 65,612 spectators gathered at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, the venue shared by the Revolution and the NFL's New England Patriots, to witness the Argentine World Cup winner in action.Despite being affected by a flu outbreak and languishing at the bottom of the Eastern Conference, New England stunned the home fans just 40 seconds into the game through their own Argentine, Tomas Chancalay. After receiving a lofted pass from Spanish midfielder Carles Gil , Chancalay capitalized on Drake Callender's advanced position and chipped the ball over the stranded Miami goalkeeper to open the scoring.Messi equalized for Miami in the 32nd minute, latching onto Robert Taylor's through pass and calmly slotting the ball home. The eight-time Ballon d'Or winner then put Miami ahead in the 68th minute, collecting a brilliant defence-splitting pass from his former Barcelona teammate Sergio Busquets and finishing with his trademark composure.In the closing stages, Miami added two more goals, both orchestrated by Messi. Substitute Benjamin Cremaschi made it 3-1 in the 83rd minute, pouncing on the rebound after a Messi shot was parried away. Luis Suarez completed the scoring by finding the top corner following an inside pass from Messi.","Lionel Messi scores twice in Inter Miami's 4-1 victory against New England Revolution.

NEW DELHI: Liverpool 's Premier League title aspirations suffered a significant setback on Saturday as they were held to a draw by West Ham , while Sheffield United were relegated from the top-flight.In a day filled with drama, Aston Villa 's pursuit of a top-four finish was hindered by a 2-2 draw against Chelsea , whose manager Mauricio Pochettino expressed his frustration with VAR after a late goal was controversially disallowed.Manchester United 's European ambitions were stalled by a 1-1 draw against Burnley, and Everton secured their Premier League status with a 1-0 victory over Brentford at Goodison Park.Liverpool's chances of catching league leaders Arsenal took a hit as they dropped points for the fourth time in their last five league matches. Despite having opportunities to secure a win, they were unable to capitalize on them. The Gunners sit atop the table with 77 points, two ahead of Liverpool with a game in hand, while reigning champions Manchester City have 76 points with two games in hand on the Reds.Jarrod Bowen gave West Ham the lead just before halftime, but Liverpool showed improvement in the second half, equalizing through Andy Robertson before West Ham goalkeeper Alphonse Areola scored an own goal.However, the home side found an equalizer in the 77th minute when Bowen set up Michail Antonio for a headed goal, resulting in a 2-2 final score.

12 runs per over in Powerplays

No need for consolidation

Featherbed pitches on offer

Fast bowlers are the rage

Almost two-thirds of the league stage is done and dusted. The IPL this season has witnessed new trends and some old patterns turned upside down. TOI takes a look...There were only two 250-plus totals before this edition, one way back in 2013 when RCB raked up 263/5 against Pune Warriors and the other in 2023 when LSG scored 257/5 versus Punjab Kings.This season, there have been 8 totals of more than 250, with Sunrisers Hyderabad leading the way with three such totals. KKR have a pair of 250-plus scores to their credit. Now, a 200-plus total is nothing but a par score.Top-order batsmen like Jake Fraser-McGurk (DC), Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma (SRH), Phil Salt and Sunil Narine (KKR), Jos Buttler and Yashasvi Jaiswal (RR) among others have just maximised the first six overs to the fullest. Earlier, the standard ""explosive start"" after the Powerplay overs was teams notching up 55-60 runs. This IPL, the benchmark has shifted to 70-plus after the first six. SRH even scored 125/0 against Delhi, the highest-ever score in the Powerplay in the IPL. In their record successful chase of 262 against KKR, Punjab scored 93 /1 in this period. McGurk went berserk to lift DC to 92/0 against MI.With the 'Impact Player' rule helping the batting side's cause, every team is making sure the hitting continues even after the Powerplay. Earlier, the norm was that batters used to rotate the strike and look for a boundary every alternate over before going big once again in the death overs (16th-20th). Teams were happy to score 7-8 runs per over from the 7th over till the 15th. This season, there's been a tectonic shift - batters are taking 10-12 runs per over even during the so-called 'consolidation period'. A batter now thinks six first, then a boundary; and if not the first two, he turns to other options.Earlier, each venue had a distinct characteristic of its own, lending some meaning to the home-and-away concept. The Wankhede stadium's pitch offered pace and bounce and the new ball swung. The wicket in Chennai's MA Chidambaram stadium was a turning track. Delhi's Kotla wicket was slow and low. Bangalore's Chinnaswamy pitch has perennially sounded the death knell for all kinds of bowlers. That tradition is still on in Bangalore, but the other pitches that traditionally offered something to the bowlers have also turned into absolute featherbeds. The batters are ruling the roost.Other than DC, who have kept faith in spinners Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel, most franchises are turning to their pacemen to deliver. Even CSK, which traditionally has won IPLs on the back of spin, have depended on Mustafizur Rahman , Deepak Chahar, Matheesha Pathirana, Shardul Thakur and Tushar Deshpande . Ravindra Jadeja has often been the sole spinner, as Maheesh Theekshana and Moeen Ali have played just three matches each. KKR, a team that relied on spinners in previous IPLs, has also drastically cut down on its overs given to spin. Another startling statistic of this IPL is that among the top-20 wicket-takers, only two are spinners, and they're Yuzvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav. The rest are all pacers.","Batsmen are taking 10-12 runs per over even during the so-called 'consolidation period' Earlier, the norm was that batters used to rotate the strike and look for a boundary every alternate over.

AHMEDABAD: Shubman Gill and Virat Kohli take centrestage as the Gujarat Titans host Royal Challengers Bengaluru in an afternoon match at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Sunday.Earmarked as one who could fill in Kohli's shoes, Gill has taken on the mantle with aplomb and has more or less cemented his place in the Indian team across formats.While Gill won his first Orange Cap last year, aggregating 890 runs in 17 matches, Kohli is the leading run-getter in this edition, having totalled 430 runs so far in 9 matches.However, more than the individual runs scored, it's the strike rate that has dominate the conversation. While Kohli's knocks have come at a strike rate of 145.76, Gill has been striking at a similar rate of 146.15, not among the highest this season.Gill will look up to fellow opener Wriddhiman Saha for providing the brisk start. Saha and southpaw David Miller are back among runs but would want to be more consistent. Sai Sudharsan, who bats at number three, is the top run-getter for Titans this season. But the Tamil Nadu batter's 334 runs have come at a strike rate of 128.95.Titans' bowling has also blown hot and cold so far. The predictable Umesh Yadav has been replaced by Sandeep Warrier (five wickets in three matches) but the Tamil Nadu pacer too has leaked runs.While leg-spinner Rashid Khan has taken eight wickets in nine wickets, he has kept the run scoring at bay by going at 7.44 runs an over in a season in which scores in excess of 200 have been the norm. Noor Ahmad and R Sai Kishore too have impressed.Kohli, meanwhile, has been supported by Faf Du Plessis , Dinesh Karthik and Rajat Patidar (211 runs). The batting, though, has not found support from the bowlers.Left-arm pacer Yash Dayal, who is RCB 's highest wicket-taker, is 23rd on the list. Pacer Mohammed Siraj has taken five wickets at an economy rate of 9.65.The inclusion of Will Jacks and Swapnil Singh has provided them with spin-bowling options, and how this bowling line-up fares against Gill and other batters of Titans could very well decide the outcome of this contest.","Shubman Gill and Virat Kohli take centrestage as Gujarat Titans host Royal Challengers Bengaluru in an afternoon match at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: Chairman of the national selection committee Ajit Agarkar and skipper Rohit Sharma are set to hold an informal meeting in the national capital to discuss a potential 15-member squad for the T20 World Cup in the Americas.The official announcement is likely to take place in Mumbai on May 1, which is the cut-off date for the ICC event.It is understood that Agarkar specifically flew to Delhi for Saturday's IPL match between Mumbai Indians and Delhi Capitals, as this provided him an opportunity to have a discussion with Rohit and gain further clarity before meeting with his colleagues to finalize the team selection.There are a couple of slots which will be up for discussion as most of the team picks itself. There won't be many surprises and the only thing that the selection committee and team management needs to be convinced about isHardik Pandya 's bowling fitness.If Hardik is slotted in the 15, then only one among Shivam Dube and Rinku Singh can be accommodated while it seems that KL Rahul, one of the favourites of the current coaching dispensation headed by Rahul Dravid, has left his nearest competitor Sanju Samson far behind.There is very little possibility of a left-field selection and one option could be Mumbai Indians batter Tilak Varma, who is a flamboyant southpaw and can also bowl handy off-spin in case opposition has more left-handers.However, it can't be ascertained how much is the possibility of that happening as Axar Patel and Ravi Bishnoi are fighting for the third spinner's slot.Yuzvendra Chahal, the country's most skillful white ball wrist spinner, is reportedly not a priority choice for an influential member of the coaching staff, who has a lot of say in selection matters.","The official announcement is likely to take place in Mumbai on May 1, which is the cut-off date for the ICC event.

NEW DELHI: Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) are set to face Rajasthan Royals (RR) in the 44th match of the Indian Premier League (IPL) at the Ekana Cricket Stadium on Saturday. Currently, Lucknow hold the fourth position on the points table with five wins from eight games, while Rajasthan sit at the top with seven victories in eight matches.Rajasthan Royals are likely to be the favourites in Saturday's clash, having secured three consecutive wins after a rare loss against Gujarat Titans.Riyan Parag, the young Assam batter, has been the standout performer for RR in the batting department this season, leading the team's scoring with 318 runs from eight games. Additionally, the resurgence of Yashasvi Jaiswal has strengthened RR's batting lineup, as demonstrated by his unbeaten 104 off 60 balls in the previous game against Mumbai Indians, leading his team to a comfortable nine-wicket victory.RR's batting typically revolves around their skipper, Sanju Samson , who has scored 314 runs so far. With the West Indian Shimron Hetymer capable of hitting top gear, the 2008 IPL champions possess a formidable lineup. However, players like Rovman Powell and Dhruv Jurel need to step up and contribute more to the team's success.RR also boast a potent bowling attack, featuring the experienced Trent Boult, Avesh Khan, and Sandeep Sharma, whose impressive figures of 5 for 18 against Mumbai Indians have ignited the team's spirit. The spin department is in the capable hands of the experienced duo, Yuzvendra Chahal and R. Ashwin, although the latter has struggled this season. Chahal, however, remains RR's best bowler, having claimed 13 wickets from eight games.LSG, on the other hand, will be motivated by the desire for revenge after losing the first encounter to RR by 20 runs this season. Apart from seeking revenge, LSG will also be aiming to secure a hat-trick of victories and climb up the leaderboard. KL Rahul 's team is riding high after two consecutive wins, but the Indian player is well aware of the shortcomings in the top order. When Rahul and his opening partner Quinton de Kock are in top form, LSG's batting looks formidable. The challenge arises when the opening duo has an off day. However, this issue was addressed by Marcus Stoinis in their previous game against Chennai Super Kings, where the Australian scored an unbeaten century.In their IPL encounters so far, Lucknow Super Giants and Rajasthan Royals have crossed paths in a total of 4 matches. Out of these encounters, Lucknow have secured victory on one occasion, while Rajasthan have emerged triumphant in three matches, showcasing their dominance in the head-to-head battle between the two franchises.Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium, located in Lucknow, India, was formerly known as the Ekana International Cricket Stadium.In terms of batting performance, teams batting first have held a dominant position, winning 5 out of 6 matches, accounting for 83.33% of victories. Conversely, teams batting second have managed to secure victory in only one match, representing 16.67% of wins.Surprisingly, the statistics also reveal a trend where teams winning the toss have won only 33.33% of matches, while those losing the toss have emerged victorious in 66.67% of matches, indicating the stadium's inclination towards favoring the chasing side.With an average runs per wicket of 22.52 and an average runs per over of 7.04, the stadium has witnessed competitive cricketing action, with an average first innings score of 160 runs setting the tone for thrilling encounters.Compared to other IPL 2024 venues, the pitch at Lucknow's Ekana Stadium is expected to be slightly slower. Batsmen may encounter difficulties scoring against the old ball, despite finding it easier to play shots with the new ball.To thrive on this surface, pacers are likely to rely more on variations like cutters and bowling into the pitch as the match progresses. Additionally, spinners are anticipated to find ample assistance, making it challenging for batsmen during the middle overs.In Lucknow, teams batting first have enjoyed considerable success, securing victories in six matches compared to the four won by chasing teams. Consequently, it appears probable that the team winning the toss will opt to bat first.1. With the pitch expected to slow down, pacers who can adeptly adjust their strategies by incorporating variations like cutters and bowling into the pitch as the ball ages could prove to be valuable fantasy picks.

Shaheen then took 4 for 30 to restrict New Zealand to 169 all out in 19.2 overs, leveling the series at 2-2.However, Pakistan's win wasn't certain until the final over, as Josh Clarkson's unbeaten 38 threatened an upset, needing 12 runs.Two run-outs in Mohammad Amir 's over sealed the home win, much to the delight of the packed crowd at Gaddafi Stadium.The first match of the series was abandoned, with Pakistan taking the second and New Zealand winning the third, both by identical seven-wicket margins in Rawalpindi. New Zealand claimed victory in the fourth match in Lahore by four runs.The series served as valuable preparation for both teams ahead of the Twenty20 World Cup in the United States and West Indies in June.While Pakistan would be disappointed not to have won a series against a depleted New Zealand side missing a host of players due to Indian Premier League, unavailability and injuries, the visitors got a boost from their bench strength.Shaheen gave Pakistan an ideal start by dismissing Tom Blundell for four in his first over -- his 15th wicket in his opening over of a Twenty20 international -- and 50th in all T20 matches.Tim Seifert put New Zealand back on track with an aggressive 33-ball 52 -- his ninth T20I half century containing seven boundaries and two sixes.He added 76 for the second wicket with skipper Micheal Bracewell (23) but from 81-1 New Zealand lost four wickets in the space of 25 balls for the addition of just 22 runs.Leg-spinner Usama Mir (2-21) had Seifert and Mark Chapman (12) while fellow spinner Shadab Khan accounted for Bracewell as New Zealand's chase was derailed.Shaheen returned for a second spell to dismiss James Neesham (16), Zak Foulkes (nought) and Ish Sodhi (three) in successive overs.Azam said he used different combinations to test the squad strength ahead of the World Cup.""Look, throughout the series we tried different combinations and we wanted to see where our bench strength stands,"" said Azam.""There are many good signs but we won't be complacent and will focus on improvement which is crucial in international cricket.""Bracewell was delighted that his team came out all-square.""Pretty fair reflection of the series, pretty happy with coming over here and learning how to play in these conditions,"" said Bracewell who captained New Zealand for the first time.""Credit to Pakistan, they played really well today.""Earlier, Azam saw his opening partner Saim Ayub fall in the second over for just one but that did not deter him as he added 73 for the second wicket with Usman Khan who made a brisk 24-ball 31.Azam hit six boundaries and two sixes in his 34th T20I half-century before he was bowled by pacer Ben Sears in the 15th over.Zaman hit four boundaries and a six before he was smartly caught by Chapman on the boundary off Foulkes as Pakistan managed 55 in the last five overs.Shadab Khan hit a six and a four in his five-ball 15 not out.New Zealand made three changes as they brought back Seifert, Cole McConchie and Foulkes while pace spearhead Shaheen returned for the home team.","Pakistan beat New Zealand by nine runs in the fifth and final Twenty20 International in Lahore.

NEW DELHI: Former India off-spinner Aashish Kapoor expressed disappointment with the bowlers' performance in this IPL season, highlighting their struggle to find the right lengths. He warned that the trend of high-scoring matches could soon escalate to teams scoring 300-350 runs in an innings.Teams have consistently surpassed 200-250 runs this season, with Sunrisers Hyderabad exceeding 260 on three occasions and Punjab Kings achieving a record-breaking T20 chase against Kolkata Knight Riders As the assistant coach of Gujarat Titans , Kapoor shared these thoughts ahead of their match against Royal Challengers Bengaluru, emphasizing the need for bowlers to correct their approach to avoid escalating run rates.""The batsmen are playing some amazing shots, but the bowling is not up to the mark. (GT head coach Asish) Nehra and I keep talking about it. Absolutely, I am surprised,"" Kapoor said at the pre-match press conference.""I mean if you bowled decently enough you will end up giving away 200 runs, but not 260, 280, 270. Last few matches, every over there have been at least two full tosses, two short balls bowled in their half.""If you are not going to pitch the ball on good length areas and keep bowling on your half, why 260, you will end up seeing 360 also. Now they are bowling two full tosses an over, in future they will bowl four full tosses an over, and you will see 300-plus scores very soon,"" he added.Kapoor was, however, satisfied with the performance of his team's bowlers thus far in the tournament.""I don't think bowling has been our problem this year. They might be having problems but not our bowling.""He also cited example to buttress his point.""In Lucknow, which was a flat wicket we got them out for 160, but we couldn't chase it down. And again, against Delhi it looked a little damp that day (at Ahmedabad).""If we had won the toss we would have bowled. We didn't win the toss, we had to bat...I am not giving an excuse but if we got to 150, we would have probably put up a good fight. Still we ended up taking four-five wickets.""In that game against DC at home, GT were shot out for 89.Kapoor said the team made a conscious decision to play on both black and red soil wickets at home this season, having mostly used red soil pitches in their first two seasons.""Now the wickets in Ahmedabad, half of them are black soil wickets and half of them are red soil. Usually the black soil wicket keeps a little low bounce and it's a little sluggish than red soil wicket.""I think the last two years we played most of our matches on the red soil wickets, or the mixed wicket, whatever you cal it. But this year we also wanted to play on black soil wickets and see if it helps our spinners,"" he said.""Against Mumbai we got 170, but we won the game. And I think against Punjab, it was red soil wicket, we scored 190 and it went to the last stage and we lost the game. I thing we are getting a red soil wicket tomorrow,"" Kapoor said.Asked about the impact player rule, he said it is ""hampering"" the growth of all-rounders in India.""These days we just don't get into the tail, you pick up the fifth wicket a batsman walks in, you pick up the sixth wicket another batsman walks in. It's only 20 overs, so how many batsmen you need.""That (impact player rule) is also one of the reasons why a lot of all-rounders... a guy like Shivam Dube, he is an all-rounder, basically a bowler who could bat. Now, he is batting but he never bowls. And this is also hampering India in producing all-rounders,"" he felt.""Most of the all-rounders who are there are sitting outside, as impact players. They are just batting. So, I don't know how much this is helping,"" Kapoor said.The GT assistant coach also said the absence of experienced pacer Mohammed Shami has not helped the side this season.""Mohammed Shami is a world-class performer, anybody would miss him, right. He has done well for us in the last two seasons, those four overs will obviously make a little bit of difference.""But then you can't keep cribbing. You have to look at different options and move on.""Kapoor also refused to rule any team out of contention for play-offs berth at this juncture of the tournament.""The place where we are in the tournament currently, the mid section even we have to keep winning games. They (RCB) still will be thinking that they have a chance if they win all the remaining games. At the moment every team has a chance,"" he said.""Everybody has something to gain.""Kapoor praised R Sai Kishore and called him ""one of the most confident players in our team.""""He always thinks that he can win us a game.

Determined to prove his worth and regain his form, he embarked on a journey of self-improvement, dedicating himself to refining his skills and technique.Cut to 2024, a call from Delhi Capitals head coach Ricky Ponting had 22-year-old Fraser-McGurk rushing to India and rest as they say is history.He has already smashed 22 sixes and an equal number of boundaries in five games since his arrival as Harry Brook's replacement.On Saturday afternoon, he owned Kotla by smashing Jasprit Bumrah 's opening over in a manner that the famed Indian slinger would have hardly imagined.The man, who owns the world record of fastest List A hundred (off 29 balls in Marsh Cup) has now done enough that Delhi Capitals have been forced to drop David Warner on pretext of a hand injury.Yes, Warner had injury but he is doing fine and played against Sunrisers. But DC management has understood that it difficult to fit both Warner and Fraser-McGurk in the playing XI.For Fraser-McGurk, the 27-ball-84 felt surreal as watching Bumrah rattle stumps on television is so different from carting him all over the park. At times, truth is stranger than fiction.""It was pretty nervous. I had looked at his (Bumrah's) footage all day. But in the game everything goes out of the window and you just have to see the ball. It is good to test yourself against the best bowler in the world,"" Fraser-McGurk said while collecting his man of the match award.Having already encountered highs and lows in his short career, he felt that these innings are good for his career.""You have to ride the waves of highs and lows. These innings are good for my confidence and for my team.""He had watched a lot of IPL but only after being a part of it did he know that what kind of competition exists.""From outside you don't know the level of the competition, this is such a higher level than the other leagues and it is amazing to be a part of it,"" he said.Life for Fraser-McGurk is moving at an even quicker pace than his three fifties at the IPL and two things, one can rest assured will happen.He will be part of the Australian T20 squad as he has got a hang of playing spinners which will be important in the West Indies.Secondly, Delhi Capitals will for sure retain him along with Rishabh Pant and Kuldeep Yadav before next year's mega IPL auctions.",Jake Fraser-McGurk has smashed 22 sixes and an equal number of boundaries in five games since his arrival as Harry Brook's replacement.

Jadeja has done a good job batting at No 4: Michael Hussey,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/jadeja-has-done-a-good-job-batting-at-no-4-michael-hussey/articleshow/109653055.cms,"(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings batting coach Michael Hussey discussed Ravindra Jadeja 's new role as a No. 4 batsman and praised his adaptability to adjust his game according to the situation.Jadeja, traditionally known for his finishing abilities alongside MS Dhoni, has been seen batting at number four this season, experiencing a range of performances and outcomes.""He is playing a different role (batting at number four).He has been coming in very late in the last few years. He has done a good job so far at adapting to the situation and playing accordingly,"" Hussey said ahead of their match against Sunrisers Hyderabad.""He is in a good frame of mind, hitting the ball well in the nets, and there is no concern. He played a quick innings in Lucknow, and his strength is being able to work the ball around the gaps, use his pace and run between the wickets, picking the right time to attack the right bowlers.""CSK faced consecutive defeats in their last two matches, while SRH, also on a strong streak, is coming off a loss against Royal Challengers Bengaluru.In the recent meeting against Lucknow Super Giants at Chepauk, challenging conditions prevailed due to heavy dew, contributing to CSK's first home defeat of the season.""In the last few games, the dew has been really challenging for the bowlers, taking them out of the game. But, we have always had good spinners, and the conditions here have also been friendly,"" Hussey said.“The other night, the spinners found it very difficult to hold the ball, and they couldn't get spin on it. The ball was skidding nicely onto the bat, which made it really challenging.“But again, there is no excuse it is pretty much the same for both teams, and we have to deal with it as best as we can.CSK's top-order batter Ajinkya Rahane has been dismissed for single digit scores in two of the last three games.But Hussey expressed his confidence in the 35-year-old Indian batter and said a calf niggle may have troubled him.""We are 100 per cent backing Ajinkya Rahane, he is batting really well. He just got out a couple of times early, which can happen to anyone.""He did have a niggle in his calf, which probably sent him back a little bit, but overall, we are very happy with what he has done.""Shivam Dube will again be the guy to watch out for the Yellow Brigade, having been their second-highest run-scorer of the season.Hussey said it's about giving him the freedom to play aggressively and express himself.""Our conversations have been about giving him the freedom to hit sixes and fours and dominate the bowling.""We want to give him the trust that even if he misses out, that's the way we want him to play, which has helped him as he has gained confidence,""""We don't really talk about footwork and let him be clear in his mind, as he is playing his best when he is not thinking too much.""He has got unique power and long levers. So, it's more about being nice and stable and using his long reach to clear the boundaries,"" he added.","Michael Hussey praises Ravindra Jadeja's adaptability as a No. 4 batsman.

Arne Slot: Liverpool reach agreement for Jurgen Klopp's replacement to become new manager,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/epl/top-stories/arne-slot-liverpool-reach-agreement-for-jurgen-klopps-replacement-to-become-new-manager/articleshow/109638938.cms,"(Inputs from AFP)

NEW DELHI: According to British media reports, Liverpool and Feyenoord have reached an agreement for Arne Slot to replace Jurgen Klopp as the manager of the Premier League club. The Press Association reported that a compensation package for the 45-year-old, who had two years remaining on his contract, has been agreed upon. The BBC stated that the deal is worth up to £9.4 million (10.9 million euros).Slot expressed his confidence in securing the Anfield job on Thursday, saying, ""I would like to go to Liverpool.Now I'm waiting to see whether the clubs reach an agreement. I'm very confident in that."" He joined Feyenoord in 2021 after an impressive stint as the manager of AZ Alkmaar. In his first season with Feyenoord, Slot led the team to the inaugural Europa Conference League final, where they narrowly lost 1-0 to Jose Mourinho's Roma. The following season, he guided the club to their second league title in 24 years before signing a new three-year contract.Klopp, who will step down at the end of the current season after a successful nine-year reign that included winning the Champions League in 2019 and the Premier League in 2020, praised Slot's qualities, saying, ""I like the way his team plays football . If he is the one, I like that he wants it."" He added, ""I don't know him, but some people who know him say he's a good guy. I like that a lot. So good coach, good guy. Looking forward for the club, if he is the solution, if he is the man, I'm more than happy.""Currently, Feyenoord sit second in the Eredivisie table, nine points behind leaders PSV Eindhoven. Failing to win the Dutch title would be a disappointment for Slot, similar to Klopp's frustration with Liverpool's faltering title bid. The Reds are third in the Premier League, three points behind leaders Arsenal and two points behind second-placed Manchester City, who have a game in hand. Liverpool's recent form has been poor, with defeats against Crystal Palace and Everton, as well as quarter-final exits in the FA Cup and Europa League.Initially, Bayer Leverkusen manager and former Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso was considered the favorite to succeed Klopp. However, Alonso has committed to staying at Leverkusen after leading them to a first-ever Bundesliga title. Sporting Lisbon coach Ruben Amorim was also linked with the Liverpool job but has reportedly held talks with West Ham about replacing David Moyes next season.Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk believes that Slot's attacking tactics could be an ideal fit for the Premier League club, stating, ""I think Arne Slot is perhaps one of the better Dutch coaches at this moment. I think the way of playing and the philosophy he has, that he could be a Liverpool coach.""","Liverpool and Feyenoord have reached an agreement for Arne Slot to replace Jurgen Klopp. A compensation package for the 45-year-old, who had two years remaining on his contract, has been agreed upon.

NEW DELHI: Arda Gueler 's goal secured a 1-0 victory for a heavily-rotated Real Madrid side against Real Sociedad on Friday, bringing the LaLiga leaders closer to their 36th Spanish title.With only five games left to play, Real Madrid now have 84 points, extending their lead over second-placed Barcelona to 14 points. Barcelona, who have a game in hand, will host Valencia on Monday.Carlo Ancelotti , Real Madrid's manager, made significant changes to the team that defeated Barcelona 3-2 on Sunday, resting key players such as Jude Bellingham and Toni Kroos in preparation for their upcoming Champions League semi-final against Bayern Munich .Despite the changes, Ancelotti's team managed to secure the three points. ""It was clear that everyone thought we were coming here for a walk,"" Ancelotti told reporters. ""The only ones who didn't think so were the players. They had commitment and attitude. They had the desire and enthusiasm to keep winning.""Real Sociedad, currently in sixth place and vying for a Europa League spot, controlled possession throughout the match, which was played in heavy rain. They created several good opportunities, but Real Madrid goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga made crucial saves to keep them at bay.The visitors capitalized on their only chance in the first half when Gueler, a 19-year-old Turkish midfielder making his first start for Real Madrid since joining from Fenerbahce, converted Dani Carvajal's cross in the 29th minute. Three minutes later, Takefusa Kubo thought he had equalized for Real Sociedad, but the goal was disallowed after a VAR check revealed a foul in the build-up.In the second half, Real Sociedad continued to press for an equalizer, but they had another goal ruled out due to Mikel Merino being offside. Benat Turrientes also had a shot from the edge of the box saved by the impressive Arrizabalaga. Real Madrid nearly doubled their lead late in the game, but Alex Remiro made a fantastic reflex save to deny Eduardo Camavinga's close-range effort.Ancelotti praised his team's mentality, stating, ""We have a spectacular squad. They have this attitude that they feel like they have to win every game. There are four points left to clinch the LaLiga title and we are very close.""",Real Madrid extend lead over Barcelona to 14 points with 1-0 win over Real Sociedad.

The Foxes sit atop the Championship standings with 94 points and two games remaining, while Leeds remain second with 90 points and only one match left to play.Ipswich Town , currently in third place with 89 points and three games in hand, have the opportunity to overtake Leeds for the second automatic promotion spot.Leeds manager Daniel Farke acknowledged the situation, stating, ""It's not in our hands anymore (automatic promotion), we need to be honest."" However, he remained hopeful, adding, ""The race is not over, if Ipswich win the next two games then I will say congratulations but if they don't win them then we will have a lot to play for (against Southampton on the final day of the season).""Leicester achieved promotion in their first season following relegation from the Premier League last year. They face Preston on Monday before concluding their season at home against Blackburn on May 4. Leeds' fate depends on Ipswich's results against Hull on Saturday and Coventry in their game in hand on Tuesday. If Ipswich win both matches, they will secure promotion, relegating Leeds to the play-offs.Despite their impressive 5-0 victory over Southampton on Tuesday, Leicester's joy at promotion may be tempered by the Premier League's charges against them in March for alleged breaches of profit and sustainability rules during their last three years in the top flight. If found guilty, the Foxes could face a points deduction upon their return to the Premier League.QPR's well-deserved win over Leeds, with goals from Ilias Chair, Lucas Andersen, Lyndon Dykes, and Sam Field, ensured their survival in the Championship. Manager Marti Cifuentes, who took over from Gareth Ainsworth in October when the team was second from bottom, expressed his delight, saying, ""It was a fantastic evening. We worked really hard to get this type of performance."" He praised the club's resilience and unity in the face of adversity, calling their survival ""the great escape.""","Leicester City secured promotion to the Premier League on Friday following Leeds United's unexpected 4-0 loss against Queens Park Rangers.

He had mentioned that other coaches, such as Pep Guardiola, Ernesto Valverde, and Luis Enrique , had also experienced similar struggles.Barcelona appointed Xavi as their manager in November 2021, and he helped the club win the league title last season. However, this season has been more challenging, with the team suffering a 4-1 defeat to Real in the Spanish Super Cup and being eliminated from the Copa del Rey by Athletic Bilbao. Financial issues have also plagued the club in recent years.Following Xavi's initial announcement to leave, there was a lack of experienced coaches linked to the job, with onlyRafael Marquez , the current Barcelona B team manager, being considered a serious contender.Despite the team's inconsistent performance this season, there are promising signs for the future, with the emergence of young talents such as Lamine Yamal , Pau Cubarsi, and Fermin Lopez.",Xavi had previously announced his intention to leave the club at the end of the season.

Juventus, who have won the competition a record 14 times, advanced despite a 2-1 loss to Lazio in their second leg, progressing with a 3-2 aggregate score.Atalanta, fresh off their Europa League quarter-final elimination of Liverpool , reached their sixth Italian Cup final, with their only previous trophy coming in the 1962-63 season. Fiorentina had taken a 1-0 lead in the first leg at home, thanks to a strike from Rolando Mandragora.However, Atalanta wasted no time in levelling the tie, with Teun Koopmeiners scoring in the eighth minute. Gianluca Scamacca thought he had doubled the lead shortly after, but his goal was disallowed for a foul in the buildup. Atalanta continued to threaten, with Koopmeiners and Charles De Ketelaere both coming close before the break.Fiorentina's task became even more challenging when Nikola Milenkovic was sent off early in the second half for fouling Scamacca just outside the box. Despite being down to ten men, Fiorentina managed to equalise through Lucas Martinez Quarta's header from a free kick.However, Scamacca restored Atalanta's lead with a stunning scissor kick in the 75th minute. Ademola Lookman, who came on as a substitute, added a third goal in stoppage time, which was initially ruled out for offside but later awarded after a VAR review.

Liverpool, who have played one fewer match than Arsenal, face Everton in the Merseyside derby on Wednesday.""We have made our people very proud, it is a big derby for us and I know what it means,"" said Arteta.The Arsenal manager acknowledged his team's strong start but noted their failure to convert all their chances and some sloppiness in certain areas. However, he praised their second-half performance, citing improved discipline and ruthless finishing.Chelsea suffered a significant setback before the match even began, as their key player Cole Palmer was ruled out due to illness. Palmer has been involved in nearly half of Chelsea's Premier League goals this season, and his absence was keenly felt by the visitors.Despite an unbeaten run of eight league games prior to their FA Cup semi-final loss to Manchester City, Chelsea were outclassed by an Arsenal side eager to reassert their title credentials following a home defeat to Aston Villa.Mauricio Pochettino expressed his disappointment with the result and his team's performance, stating, ""Today we didn't compete against a team fighting for the Premier League. We need to be aware we need to compete in a different way.""Arsenal started the match with incredible intensity, taking the lead within five minutes through Trossard, who has proven to be a more effective signing than Chelsea's January acquisition of Mykhailo Mudryk. Chelsea goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic made several impressive saves to keep his team in the game before halftime, but Arsenal's relentless pressure eventually paid off.White's curling effort from a corner doubled Arsenal's lead early in the second half, and Havertz, who has found consistent form under Arteta, scored twice to put the game out of reach. White's attempted cross, which flew into the top corner, capped off a night to forget for Chelsea, who remained in ninth place, three points behind the European qualification spots.Arsenal's next challenge is a daunting away fixture against Tottenham in the north London derby on Sunday.
