So was my fate,"" she wrote, referring to the work she did with her team before the second day weigh-in.""To my team, my fellow Indians and my family, it feels like: the goal that we were working towards and what we had planned to achieve is unfinished, that something might always remain missing, and that things might never be the same again.""Maybe under different circumstances, I could see myself playing till 2032, because the fight in me and wrestling in me will always be there. I can't predict what the future holds for me, and what awaits me in this journey next, but I am sure that I will continue to fight always for what I believe in and for the right thing,"" she wrote.Vinesh's disqualification came after she was found to be 100 grams overweight during the second weigh-in on the morning of her gold-medal match.Her appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) to overturn the disqualification and her request for a shared silver medal were both dismissed.The decision left Vinesh disheartened, prompting her to announce her retirement from the sport, stating that she no longer had the strength to continue.The Indian Olympic Association ( IOA ), led by President PT Usha, expressed ""shock and disappointment"" at the CAS decision, calling it a significant blow to Vinesh and the larger sporting community.The IOA criticized the stringent regulations that led to Vinesh's disqualification, arguing that they failed to account for the physiological and psychological pressures athletes endure, particularly female athletes.Despite the setback, the IOA remains committed to supporting Vinesh, exploring further legal avenues to ensure her case receives the attention it deserves.As Vinesh returns home from Paris, her future in wrestling remains uncertain, but her resolve to fight for justice and fairness in sports is unwavering.",Vinesh Phogat says she could have continued her wrestling career until 2032.

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali recently took a swipe at the International Cricket Council ( ICC ) after Pakistan's star batter Babar Azam retained his top spot in the ODI rankings .India's rising star Shubman Gill , who has recently struggled for runs but still occupies the third spot in the rankings, also came under fire from Basit.Basit expressed his surprise and scepticism, noting that Babar has not played an ODI since November 2023, yet continues to hold the number one position.The rankings, which place Babar ahead of Indian cricket stars Rohit Sharma , Shubman Gill, and Virat Kohli , sparked Basit's criticism.Speaking on his YouTube channel, Basit questioned the ICC’s ranking system and suggested that it might be a tactic to pressure Babar.""When I saw the ICC ranking (for ODI batters), Babar Azam was at the top, number two was Rohit Sharma, number three was Shubman Gill, and then there was Virat Kohli at number four. I did not find it necessary to read the remaining names because I couldn't see Travis Head and Rachin Ravindra. I think the ICC wants that Babar doesn't perform. He would be happy with being the number one-ranked batter in ODIs. Who gives these rankings? On what basis are Babar Azam and Shubman Gill there?"" Basit said.Basit pointed out that the batters, who were standout performers in the World Cup, are conspicuously absent from the top ranks.Basit emphasized that during the 2023 World Cup, players like Rachin Ravindra of New Zealand, Quinton de Kock of South Africa, and Australia’s Travis Head made significant contributions, each scoring multiple centuries.Even Pakistan’s Mohammad Rizwan and Fakhar Zaman managed to notch up a century each.""Babar's last ODI was at the last year's World Cup. We saw the likes of Rachin Ravindra, Quinton de Kock, Travis Head and Virat Kohli at the World Cup. They scored three-four hundreds in the tournament. For Pakistan, Mohammad Rizwan and Fakhar Zaman scored a century each.

Losses to New Zealand and Pakistan in the group stage left their campaign hanging by a thread. The team narrowly secured a Super Six berth, necessitating a flawless run to claim the trophy.""We came in as favourites, but we played poorly for the first half of the tournament,"" Moody acknowledged, reflecting on the team's turnaround. ""We basically had to win seven in a row to be crowned champions.

Chasing a modest target of 133, Australia cruised to victory in 20.1 overs, powered by Shane Warne 's four-wicket haul and Adam Gilchrist 's blistering half-century. Moody himself contributed with the wickets of Abdul Razzaq and Azhar Mahmood.The victory sparked jubilant celebrations in the Australian dressing room, a moment etched in Moody's memory. ""We had a long period of time in the dressing room to enjoy the experience of the journey and the occasion,"" he recalled. ""All sorts of people came through, from family to famous cricket fans, but we were in our own bubble.""The team's traditional victory song, 'Beneath the Southern Cross', reverberated through the room, led by then-captain Ricky Ponting. Moody humorously recounted the experience, stating, ""Traditionally in the Australian team, we would always sing that team song after a Test or a one-day series win. Ricky Ponting was the songmaster, and he delivered it on my shoulders, right in the middle. My lower back is still recovering.""Moody's 1999 World Cup performance was instrumental in Australia's success. He scored 117 runs at an impressive average of 117.00, including a half-century, and chipped in with seven crucial wickets.

As India prepares for the

Paris Paralympics

, what message would you like to convey to the athletes?

With India having won a record 25 medals in Tokyo, do you believe they can exceed this achievement in Paris?

Who do you consider the top medal contenders for the Paris Paralympics?

As the most successful Paralympian with two gold and one silver in Javelin, how challenging is it to defend your title with so many expectations resting on you?

Do you think Neeraj faced significant pressure in his competition against Arshad Nadeem while defending his Tokyo gold?

With only one legal throw out of six, how would you assess Neeraj's performance in the final? What do you think went wrong?

Do you think Neeraj can win a gold medal in Los Angeles and join you as a three-time Olympic medalist?

Do you think losing the gold medal to an athlete from Pakistan will haunt Neeraj for a while?

NEW DELHI: The pressure was palpable on Neeraj Chopra 's face as he grabbed the javelin for his first throw in the Paris Olympics final. Having won gold at the Tokyo Games, Neeraj was aiming for another finish on top of the podium but eventually ended up winning the silver, finishing behind Pakistan's Arshad Nadeem , who claimed the gold in a thrilling men's javelin-throw final at the Stade de France earlier this month.Both Neeraj and Arshad started with foul throws in their opening attempts. However, when Nadeem returned for his second throw, he threw the spear a gigantic 92.97m far to set a new Olympic record and leave the crowd stunned.With the pressure mounting, Neeraj stepped up for his second throw. After a confident stretch and shoulder roll, he marked his season-best distance of 89.45 meters. But it remained his best throw of the final, and thus behind Nadeem's.Neeraj's last four throws were red-flagged as fouls.Three-time Paralympic medallist and the current president of the Paralympic Committee of India (PCI), Devendra Jhajharia , believes Neeraj striving to throw beyond 93 meters led to the four fouls.In an exclusive interview with TimesofIndia.com, Jhajharia discussed Neeraj's silver-medal finish, the upcoming Paralympic Games, and much more ...A large contingent of 84 athletes is heading to Paris, representing India. I'm in regular touch with each of them, encouraging them to stay focused on delivering their best performance and not to let the pressure get to them. I urge them to play to the best of their abilities and make India proud.We delivered historic performances in Tokyo, and for the Paralympics this time, I feel our athletes have prepared very well. The Khelo India scheme has also benefited the players. They are training in centers with a special focus on the Paralympics podium this time. The players have been preparing for this for a long time. When I won a medal in Tokyo and returned, within one and a half months I received a call from the Sports Authority of India asking where I would like to train for the Paris Olympics. Considering all of this, I can confidently say that we will win more than 25 medals this time because we have prepared very well.Our athletes are in excellent form in shooting, badminton, archery and many other sports. We have individuals like Sumit, who have broken world records. We also have many other highly skilled players.It's a challenge because everyone expects you to win a medal based on previous success, but each day is a new beginning for athletes. Injuries can occur, and performance can fluctuate. I believe one should give their best, and I convey the same message to the players: just give your best.Whenever any player performs well, I don’t pressure them. Neeraj's father told me he had an injury, but he still did his best. He threw over 89 meters. I am so happy with his performance. The other athlete, Arshad Nadeem, also gave his best.When Nadeem threw 92.97 meters, there was, of course, pressure on Neeraj. He threw over 89 meters. In his remaining four attempts, Neeraj wanted to throw over 93 meters. Neeraj knew he had already thrown over 89 meters and was in second position, and another 89-meter throw wouldn't have made any difference. He wanted to throw over 93 meters and put in extra effort so that he could beat Nadeem. His extra effort resulted in four fouls. For outstanding performances, you need to put in extra effort.I have seen Neeraj grow up. I have also trained with him. He is a very passionate sportsperson. He is crazy about javelin. He is so focused, very humble. I am sure he is going to make a hat-trick of Olympic medals in Los Angeles.I don't think there is anything like that. There are over 200 countries that participate in the Olympics. They compete under the same roof. We need to respect each other as sports persons. The Olympics is a big stage, and we need to respect every aspect of it. Neeraj has won a medal, and we are all proud of him.",Devendra Jhajharia is the current president of the Paralympic Committee of India (PCI) Neeraj Chopra won silver in the men's javelin at the Paris Paralympics.

This achievement also made Maharaj the most prolific spin bowler in South Africa's cricket history.The Proteas sealed the victory within three days, dismissing West Indies for 222 after setting a target of 263 runs to win.Although the opening Test in Trinidad was drawn due to inclement weather, South Africa's win in the second Test marked their 10th consecutive series victory over the West Indies.Maharaj, who got the 'Man of the Series' award, took 3 for 37 to surpass Hugh Tayfield's record of 170 Test wickets, setting a new benchmark for South African spin bowlers.Another notable performance came from the fast bowler Kagiso Rabada, who also claimed three wickets. His current tally of Test wickets is now just one victim shy of the 300 mark.The vistors faced a challenging situation in this low-scoring encounter, as the Windies came remarkably close to victory but ultimately fell short.The Windies started their chase with ample time, having more than two days to reach the target. However, they suffered an early setback when opener Mikyle Louis was dismissed for just four runs. He edged a delivery from Rabada, and Wiaan Mulder made no mistake in taking the catch at slip.Windies captain Kraigg Brathwaite was dismissed after contributing 42 runs in a partnership with Keacy Carty for the second wicket.The West Indies found themselves in a challenging position at 104 for 6 when the seasoned Jason Holder was out without scoring. However, Joshua da Silva and Gudakesh Motie formed the most productive partnership of the series for the West Indies, putting on 77 runs to bring the target down to 82 before Motie was dismissed by Maharaj for his highest Test score of 45.Da Silva was trapped lbw by Maharaj for 27, and Shamar Joseph was sent back by a spectacular one-handed diving catch from captain Temba Bavuma. Maharaj then had Jayden Seales caught by close-in fielder David Bedingham.South Africa had started the morning with a lead of 239 runs at 223 for 5, but the 22-year-old Seales tore through the tail, taking his best Test figures of 6 for 61 as the last five wickets fell for just 22 runs.",South Africa beat West Indies by 40 runs in the second Test in Georgetown.

But at the last moment many of us got a message from the PM secretariat that since they were finding it difficult to adjust the number of guests, the invitations had been withdrawn,"" Rao said.This abrupt reversal has sparked outrage among the affected athletes, who perceive it as a sign of disrespect towards their contributions to Pakistan 's sporting legacy. Rao questioned the optics of honouring an Olympic gold medalist while simultaneously sidelining individuals who have secured multiple Olympic medals for the nation in hockey.""Is this how you show respect to players who have brought not one but several Olympic medals in hockey for the country?"" he added.He highlighted the stark contrast by referencing Pakistan's last Olympic gold medal, won by the national hockey team in 1983, and the bronze medal secured in the same sport in 1992, marking the country's last Summer Games medal.The incident has ignited a debate about the treatment of former athletes and the perceived hierarchy within Pakistani sports.While Arshad Nadeem's historic achievement deserves celebration, the controversy underscores the need for sensitivity and inclusivity when recognizing sporting accomplishments, particularly in a nation grappling with a decline in its once-dominant hockey program.","Controversy has erupted in Pakistan's sporting community around a gala dinner hosted by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in honour of Olympic javelin champion Arshad Nadeem.

MS Dhoni: Dhoni likely to be treated as ‘uncapped player’ for IPL 2025 auction,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/dhoni-likely-to-be-treated-as-uncapped-player-for-ipl-2025-auction/articleshow/112577485.cms,"We also published the following articles recently

MS Dhoni likely to be treated as 'uncapped player' for IPL 2025 auction

The BCCI is reportedly planning to categorize Mahendra Singh Dhoni as an uncapped player for the 2025 IPL season, reducing Chennai Super Kings' (CSK) retention cost. Dhoni, who retired from international cricket in 2020, may thus be retained for Rs 4 crores. CSK management discussed the rule change with BCCI in July, pending formal regulations announcement.

'No rule more unfair for a player than...': Ravichandran Ashwin strongly opposes reintroduction of this IPL auction rule

Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin criticized the potential reinstatement of the Right to Match (RTM) rule for the IPL 2025 auction, arguing it prevents players from receiving their true market value. Ashwin stated that RTM benefits the original team at the expense of other bidding franchises and the player.

India's new crorepati kabaddi players grab eyeballs

The Pro Kabaddi League Season 11 Player Auction in Mumbai saw eight players crossing the INR 1 crore mark, with Sachin Tanwar leading at INR 2.15 crore. Sunil Kumar set a record as the most expensive Indian defender at INR 1.015 crore, while Mohammadreza Shadloui Chiyaneh became the first international player to exceed INR 2 crore in consecutive auctions.

Mumbai: In a development which should be music to the ears of the Chennai Super Kings management, the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) is likely to put MS Dhoni in the category of uncapped players when it announces the player regulations ahead of the 2025 edition of Indian Premier League (IPL), TOI has learnt.The BCCI will thus go back to its rule, which has been in place since the inaugural IPL season, according to which, players who have retired from international cricket for at least five years were put in the uncapped category.It means that retaining Dhoni, a legendary former India and CSK captain, will not cost CSK too heavily to. As per the last retention rules, an uncapped player could be retained for Rs 4 crores. CSK had retained Dhoni for Rs 12 crores in 2022.Asked whether Dhoni would be treated as an uncapped player in the 2025 IPL auction, CSK CEO Kasi Viswanathan told TOI: “I’ve no idea about it. We’ve not requested for it. They (the BCCI) have themselves told us that the ‘uncapped player rule’ may be kept, that’s all. They (the BCCI) haven’t announced anything as yet. The rules and regulations will be announced by the BCCI.” Apparently, the CSK management pushed for the rule during the meeting between owners of IPL franchises and BCCI on July 31 in Mumbai. Dhoni last played for India in the 2019 World Cup semifinal against New Zealand at Old Trafford in Manchester, and announced his retirement from international cricket on August 15, 2020.Before the start of IPL 2024, Dhoni handed over the CSK captaincy to India opener Ruturaj Gaikwad. Arriving to bat only in the death overs, the 43-year-old scored 161 runs in just 73 balls that he faced, at a strike-rate of 220.54, and average of 53.66.At an event in Hyderabad this month, Dhoni said he would wait for the IPL player regulations before taking the call on whether to play another season of the IPL or not. “There is a lot of time for it. We have to see what decision they take on player retention etc. Right now, the ball is not in our court. So, once the rules and regulations get formalised, I will take a call, but it needs to be in the best interest of the team,” Dhoni had said.","MS Dhoni likely to be treated as 'uncapped player' for IPL 2025 auction.

I was defending my Tokyo Olympic gold medal. Since January 2023, I have won a lot of titles. My performance was really good, and I was sure that I would defend my medal.

The last test was not my mistake. When I submitted it in January, it was successful. After submission, there was no issue as well. It was not my mistake. It was a technical fault.

"Ever-consistent Aparajith completes 10,000 runs in TNCA first division",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/ever-consistent-aparajith-completes-10000-runs-in-tnca-first-division/articleshow/112586429.cms,"CHENNAI: For Baba Aparajith , scoring truckloads of runs in the TNCA first division (Raja of Palayampatti Shield) has been a habit. Since making his debut in the red-ball competition in the 2010-11 season, Aparajith has been smashing batting records with ease.On Wednesday, the 30-year-old right-handed stylist made the statisticians reopen TN cricket ’s history books as he achieved a milestone that only a few have reached.Aparajith, a mainstay at perennial heavyweights Jolly Rovers CC, completed 10,000 runs in the TNCA top division; he got to the magical mark on the second day of the fifth-round contest against Nelson SC here.“I knew that I was close to getting there (10,000 runs). I had about 9,700 runs ahead of this season (2024-25). Knowing the amount of runs I scored in the first four rounds of the ongoing campaign, I thought after the fifth round that I may have crossed it. But I did not realise the moment I did it,” Aparajith told TOI on Friday.“I am happy, and it is good to hold a record like this. I have won a lot of trophies along the way, so it makes the achievement sweeter. Every victory is special in its own way. I am grateful to my teammates, coaches and management members of all the sides I have represented. This would not have been possible without them,” added Aparajith, who has turned out for Indian Bank, Vijay CC and Grand Slam CC besides Rovers in the first division.Aparajith has been incredibly consistent in the TNCA’s flagship event, dishing out mind-boggling numbers almost every year. A mere glance at the ‘average’ column in his chart is enough to suggest that the versatile batter has been a ‘run machine’; he has averaged 50 or more in all but one season (13 out of 14) that he has played.Aparajith said that meticulous preparation and the hunger to succeed have brought him to this level. “To reach 10,000 runs, one has to score 800-900 runs every season. I am happy with how consistent I have been. The preparation has helped me a lot; at every team that I have played, I have prepared myself well. In recent years, I have become more mature. I have an idea of how to translate this form into runs at higher levels,” said Aparajith, on the verge of making the move to Kerala for the upcoming BCCI domestic season.“The hunger has been there since the time I started playing cricket. I have always been working towards playing at the highest level. I have been looking at both quality and quantity; quality-wise, I have to keep improving my game and quantity-wise, I have to keep scoring big. Irrespective of where I play (which level), I try to perform to the best of my ability.”","Baba Aparajith has scored 10,000 runs in the TNCA first division.

After a VAR review, Matty Cash was penalized for fouling Tomas Soucek, and Lucas Paqueta stepped up to convert the spot-kick for West Ham.Aston Villa squandered two golden opportunities to extend their advantage. Leon Bailey had Areola beaten but struck the post from a challenging angle, while John McGinn's effort rolled agonizingly wide of the target.Paqueta restored parity moments later, deceiving goalkeeper, Emi Martinez. The Brazilian midfielder precisely placed the ball into the bottom left corner with a composed side-footed strike.In the dying moments of the match, West Ham came close to leveling the score, but Soucek's header was heroically cleared off the line by Ezri Konsa, preserving Villa's slender lead.Expectations are soaring for Emery's squad as Villa prepares to compete in the Champions League for the first time in over four decades, following their impressive fourth-place finish in the Premier League last season.After a four-year stint under David Moyes, West Ham have appointed Spanish manager Julen Lopetegui, who will be tasked with building upon the team's ninth-place finish from the previous campaign.",Aston Villa beat West Ham United 2-1 in their Premier League season-opener.

Meanwhile, AC Milan staged a remarkable comeback from a two-goal deficit to salvage a 2-2 draw against Torino in the dying moments of their game.Genoa's equaliser came courtesy of Junior Messias, a former Milan player, who scored in the fifth minute of added time after converting his own saved penalty kick, after Inter defender Yann Bisseck was penalised for handball.The hosts had taken a surprise lead through Alessandro Vogliacco early in the match, but Marcus Thuram's brace appeared to have secured the win for Inter. However, Bisseck's mistake cost Inter dear.""We're disappointed because the boys put in a very professional performance,"" Inter coach Simone Inzaghi was quoted as saying by AFP. ""We played very well in the first half and created plenty but conceded an unlucky goal... If you let in two goals like we did tonight then it becomes difficult to win matches.""When a team like ours goes ahead when we did we cannot concede, especially not a goal like we did.""Thuram believed he had secured a victorious start for Inter when he skillfully chipped the ball over the goalkeeper after receiving a pass from Davide Frattesi with only six minutes left on the clock. The goal was initially disallowed for offside, but after a VAR review, it was awarded.His perfectly placed header from Nicolo Barella's cross had put Inzaghi's side level on the half hour.Throughout the match, Thuram posed the greatest threat to Genoa's defense, forcing goalkeeper Pierluigi Gollini to make two outstanding saves. He also earned a penalty in the 34th minute, which was later overturned following a review of his collision with Milan Badelj.The draw was a commendable result for Genoa, not only because they were facing the defending champions but also due to the fact that Alberto Gilardino's squad had lost crucial players during the transfer window and had been plagued by a series of injuries.Genoa had parted ways with their previous season's attacking standouts, Mateo Retegui and Albert Gudmundsson, and were missing five players for Saturday's match, forcing Messias to play as a forward instead of his usual wide position.""The boys were really great tonight. With all the difficulties we've had, we knew how hard it would be but they reacted brilliantly,"" said Gilardino.In a thrilling encounter at the San Siro, Noah Okafor emerged as the savior for Milan, scoring a magnificent volley in the dying moments of stoppage time to secure a point that seemed out of reach until Alvaro Morata, the club's new signing, brought them back into the game with a goal in the 89th minute.Milan coach Paulo Fonseca's official debut was marred by an unfortunate incident in the 30th minute when Malick Thiaw inexplicably bundled the ball over his own goal line, despite having an easier opportunity to clear it.Despite a period of sustained pressure from Milan, Duvan Zapata appeared to have sealed the victory for Torino by heading in a beautiful cross from Valentino Lazaro at close range. However, substitute Morata scored on his debut, setting the stage for a dramatic finish.In the fifth of eight minutes of added time, fellow substitute Yunus Musah delivered a cross that Okafor emphatically volleyed home.In other Serie A action, newly-promoted Parma played out an entertaining 1-1 draw with Fiorentina, featuring stunning goals from Dennis Man and Cristiano Biraghi, while Empoli and Monza shared the spoils in a goalless draw.","Inter Milan's Serie A title defence got off to a rocky start as they were held to a 2-2 draw by Genoa in a match filled with late penalty drama.

Yamal's appearance came just days after his father was the victim of a brutal stabbing incident. Alongside Yamal, Pau Cubarsi and Marc Bernal, who was making his debut, completed the trio of teenage starters in midfield.""In the second half I think we played much better and with three or four very young players -- I think this match is very important, to win at the beginning of the season, especially at this stadium in Valencia, it's very difficult,"" Lewandowski told Movistar.""My aim is always to score goals, I don't know how many goals by the end of the season, but it is very important for me that as today was the first game, (I got) goals for confidence.""Dani Olmo, Barcelona's recent acquisition during the summer transfer window, is currently ineligible to participate in matches as he has not been officially registered with the team. According to Flick, the attacking midfielder also requires additional time to reach the necessary fitness level.The coach expressed greater satisfaction with the squad's showing in the latter half of the game compared to their display prior to the interval.""The second half was much better than the first half (where) we made a lot of mistakes,"" Flick told Movistar. ""We came back at the end of the first half and in the second half, we did much better.""The first half of the match came to life just before the break, despite the teams struggling to create clear opportunities in the opening 40 minutes.Duro's header from a corner was the best chance, but it sailed over the crossbar. Meanwhile, Valencia goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili was called into action to save a powerful shot from Raphinha.In the 44th minute, Valencia took the lead when Duro connected with Diego Lopez's cross, heading the ball home after escaping the attention of Inigo Martinez, who inadvertently played him onside.Valencia had a golden opportunity to double their advantage, but Cubarsi cleared Duro's shot off the line after a mistake by Marc-Andre ter Stegen.In stoppage time, Lewandowski equalized for Barcelona, turning the ball in from close range after Yamal redirected Alejandro Balde's cross into the danger zone.Shortly after the restart, Barcelona took the lead when Valencia defender Cristhian Mosquera conceded a penalty by fouling Raphinha in the box.Lewandowski, who will celebrate his 36th birthday next week, confidently struck the penalty kick into the top corner with precision and power.Throughout the majority of the second half, Barcelona maintained control over Valencia, effectively slowing down the tempo of the match. The Catalan side created more promising opportunities to extend their lead.Ferran Torres squandered a chance when he shot straight at Mamardashvili in a one-on-one situation, while Marc Casado missed the target from a favorable position near the end of the game.In added time, Lewandowski had an opportunity to secure his hat-trick but blasted his shot over the crossbar.""In the final stages we had this match under control,"" added the former Bayern Munich striker, who played under Flick in Germany. ""We took the first step on the first match day, and now we have three games (coming up in La Liga) that are very important.""Yamal received praise from a portion of the Valencia fanbase as he was substituted off the pitch. The applause was in recognition of his contributions to the Spanish national team during their victorious campaign at the European Championship.""Lamine is a great player and I think everyone loves to see him playing football ... I think you can say all the world likes to see him play,"" added Flick.",Barcelona beat Valencia 2-1 in their La Liga opener on Saturday. Robert Lewandowski scored a brace for the Catalan side. Hugo Duro had given the hosts the lead in the 44th minute.

However, the U-23 FC Goa wards lacked experience in the final three and failed to find a breakthrough.And to the delight of the crowd in the stands, it was Lajong that grew into the game after the first 15 minutes. Sadly their winter transfer window-recruit Marco Rudwere failed to convert a couple of lucrative chances in close succession.But the Brazilian was at the right place following a corner kick from Lajong skipper Hardy Nongrum and headed it home with a defence-breaking jump to score the opening goal of the crucial contest in the 30th minute.FC Goa — looking the better team for most of the match — did not take long to equalise though as a defensive lapse from the home side left Devendra Murgaonkar with the space to make a run and put the ball in into the top left of the net.However, despite some end-to-end excitement and a flurry of chances for the visitors to find a winner, the Daniel Golcalves-led Shillong Lajong defence stayed steadfast and put paid to all the attacks for a place in the quarterfinal.",Shillong Lajong drew 1-1 with Indian Super League side FC Goa in Durand Cup.

His continued form suggests he will be pivotal in Liverpool’s aspirations for another title run this season.The win provided a promising start for Slot, as Liverpool now look to build momentum under their new coach.Despite a lack of new players, the team's performance, especially in the second half, indicated potential for a strong season ahead under Slot's guidance.","Liverpool beat Ipswich Town 2-0 in Premier League on Saturday.
