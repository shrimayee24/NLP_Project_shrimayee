IND vs AUS: Rohit Sharma dropped! Exclusive visuals of his last session with India Test team

The Australian cricket team erupted in joy after what seemed to be an astonishing team catch off Virat Kohli ’s first ball on the opening day of the fifth Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground.However, third umpire Joel Wilson ruled it not out.Kohli edged the ball to Steve Smith in the slips, who dived low to his right and managed to pop the ball up, allowing Marnus Labuschagne to take the catch.Despite this, the decision was overturned by Wilson, as it appeared that the ball had grazed the ground after Smith’s attempt.This ruling has sparked considerable debate among fans and experts alike.Former Australia opener and coach Justin Langer believes Kohli was out. “From what I have seen there, that makes it more obvious to me that should have been out. Steve Smith had his fingers (underneath the ball), and you could see he was flicking the ball up, it was brilliant what he did,” he said on 7 Cricket.“He had his fingers under the ball, he flicked it up deliberately and in my opinion that’s out.”Ricky Ponting agreed with Langer.“As far as I was concerned, if (the ball) had’ve come out of (Smith’s) hand, he wouldn’t have been able to scoop it up,” he said on 7 Cricket.“I think his fingers are clearly underneath the ball … look where his pointer figure is there, it’s still underneath the ball.”Former Test umpire Simon Taufel on Channel 7 explained why the Virat Kohli first-ball review was hard to judge.“I think you described it very well when you said that depending upon which side of the fence you sit on you could probably build a case for either decision to be given,” he said.“Listening to Joel Wilson’s language there, where he said the fingers were underneath the ball and then he’s seen it roll on to the ground, by his own language he is telling us that he believes he’s seeing that ball on the ground.“So, there are two things that the TV umpire here is looking for. One is fingers underneath the ball. He was satisfied there. But then he believes through those pictures that he’s clearly seen the ball on the ground.“And here’s the challenge, slowing it right down with slow-mo. Play it at real speed and it looks pretty good.“I can certainly understand what the third umpire’s done there. He believes he’s seen the ball on the ground and called it way he’s seen it. Normally the ICC protocol on fair catches is if you see the fingers underneath the ball, that’s good to maintain a fair catch.“But here’s the problem: the on-field umpire’s no longer have the soft signal and make the decision, it’s purely in the hands of the television umpire now.”Mark Waugh, in commentary for Fox, also felt it was out.“Virat Kohli will breath a huge sigh of relief, Australian fans will feel they’ve been robbed, Indian fans (it’s) desperate relief,” Isa Guha said on Fox Cricket.Mark Waugh believes the finger was underneath the ball when it touched the turf.“It would’ve been a great catch … I think it was … he’s not happy,” he said.“You see his right finger just underneath it … I think he’s got away with one there Kohli.”Former Australian greater Allan Border was unsure. “Those ones looks so close, it’s hard to tell,” he said.Ex-India allrounder Irfan Pathan said Kohli was rightly given not out.“Virat Kohli was not out which was rightly called NOT OUT. will explain during the break,” Pathan wrote on X.","Virat Kohli edged the ball to Steve Smith in the slips, who dived low to his right and managed to pop the ball up, allowing Marnus Labuschagne to take the catch.

Travis Hunter’s viral video from Alamo Bowl sparks outrage as he ignores a young fan while holding hands with fiancée Leanna Lenee,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/travis-hunters-viral-video-from-alamo-bowl-sparks-outrage-as-he-ignores-a-young-fan-while-holding-hands-with-fiance-leanna-lenee/articleshow/116830956.cms,"Image via Travis Hunter/Instagram

Travis Hunter Walks Hand In Hand With Leanna Lenee As He Ignores A Young Kid



Travis Hunter And His Fiancee Leanna Lenee Have Been Trolled Continuously In The Last Few Weeks



Travis Hunter Deactivates His Instagram Because of This...

Travis Hunter , the college football star and the recent recipient of the Heisman Trophy , suffered a devastating loss against the BYU Cougars at the 2024 Alamo Bowl. While this might be the end of Travis’ college football career, a video has gone viral which shows Travis was in no mood to interact with his fans after he lost to the BYU Cougars. In this video, he is seen walking out of the match venue hand in hand with his fiancee Leanna Lenee and ignoring anyone who comes his way.But what has irked fans is the way he ignored a kid who came his way. While Travis, his fiancee Leanna and his younger brother Trayvis, were getting on the escalator, a young kid ran up his way in order to probably get an autograph from Travis and get a chance to speak to him. But much to the disappointment of the kid and his fans, Travis ignored the young kid completely and did not even look his way. Fans were not happy with this reaction of his. A fan wrote, “I can’t believe he ignored the child 😢”, another fan wrote, “He can’t say hello to a kid? That’s bogus.”It might be possible that this reaction of Travis has stemmed from the fact that people trolled him and his would-be wife Leanna, mercilessly in the last few weeks. So much so that Travis had to temporarily delete his Instagram account while Leanna had to make her social media accounts private.Many people have now again blamed Leanna for the way Travis behaved with his fans after he lost to the BYU Cougars at the 2024 Alamo Bowl. A fan wrote, “His chick got him ignoring kids now a real simp”, another fan wrote, “She's locked in. 😂 Holding hands and everything.”Fans are also worried about his selection in the NFL. Even though he is a top college football athlete, the controversy around his relationship does not make a good impression on him. A fan wrote regarding this problem, “I guarantee NFL teams will view their relationship as a liability and distraction in NFL locker rooms. She really altered the entire focus of that Colorado team and Travis still acting like it’s okay.”Neither Travis nor Leanna has made any statements in public about this incident. A few days ago Travis had opened up in a podcast that the continuous hate and trolling have been “draining” him but he continued to defend his fiancee.However, recently, a video of Leanna had gone viral which was shot three years ago and showed her dancing with an unknown man “inappropriately.” This prompted Travis to completely go off his social media.The couple started dating in 2022 and are slated to get married in May 2025. However, there is still some doubts over when they began dating since Travis had mentioned jokingly that they have been dating since 2019. Both of them have not issued a statement about this.Travis and his fiancee also have a YouTube channel where they used to share glimpses of their wedding planning but they have not posted anything in the last few months. Their last video was about the wedding dress that Travis' fiancee Leanna was planning on to purchase.Also Read: Travis Hunter’s fiancée Leanna Lenee continues to face heavy criticism from fans after another controversial video of the couple’s tense moment goes viral",Travis Hunter lost to the BYU Cougars at the 2024 Alamo Bowl.

Whispers are growing louder within the WWE Universe: a dream match between John Cena and Cody Rhodes is being planned for WrestleMania 41.

In other matches, Seth Rollins and CM Punk square off against each other, and Roman Reigns battles Solo Sikoa in Tribal Combat.As of right now, a recent report that suggested John Cena would be Cody Rhodes' opponent was true. The notion that Cena would attempt to end the world title reign had been a ""working idea"" for months, according to Meltzer. Furthermore, The Rock is expected to attend the taping for the first time since Bad Blood, according to long-running rumors. But it appears that the match with Cody Rhodes, which has been hinted at on multiple occasions, will not now take place. Dave Meltzer confirmed earlier reports that John Cena vs. Cody Rhodes is now set for WrestleMania in an article published in the Wrestling Observer Newsletter . Theoretically, this would mean that The Rock has no competition. The Great One is still expected to wrestle on the show by ""people at the top"" despite this.It stated, “Nobody had directly told us that Dwayne Johnson will be on the show, but I would think there’s a good shot of it. There is a belief he’s doing WrestleMania, although nobody knows what capacity and as noted, Cena vs. Rhodes is right now scheduled meaning the original plans for Rhodes vs. Rock are off. But whatever Rock wants to do will happen and plans will change if he wants them to. Whatever Rock is going to do, if he’ll have a prominent role, one would expect to be teased on ⅙.”ALSO READ: Janel Grant Poised to Shake WWE with Lawsuit Amendment Against Vince McMahon and John Laurinaitis With a stacked card featuring top-tier talent like John Cena, Cody Rhodes, Seth Rollins, and Roman Reigns, the stage is set for an unforgettable night of action and drama.

I don't know who those would be now, I think I had names years ago when I was in NXT because I almost wanted to have this... you could say cult. But I was almost thinking of, this was back thinking about like The Walking Dead, like The Saviors or something. One guy at the front, and then there's a lot of guys who are just like, 'all right, wait, this guy is going to be able to get me what I want. I will do anything for him.' Kind of an idea. Other than that, I haven't really put much thought into it, but I mean, if you were going to do like a big three, Miami Heat LeBron super team or something like that, you know, probably, I don't know, me and Cody and Roman or something.""Knight recently made headlines for a minor car accident before a WWE live event in Baltimore.

What We Know So Far...



A Breakout Season for DJ Johnson



Panthers' Season in Review



Fans React



What's Next for Carolina?



The Carolina Panthers will play the Atlanta Falcons without linebacker DJ Johnson this Sunday, after he was involved in a car accident earlier this week. Head coach Dave Canales confirmed the news on Friday, saying that although the accident was serious enough to sideline Johnson, his condition is not life-threatening.Johnson, on the injury report for ""personal reasons,"" was later found to have been in a car accident. Coach Canales did not stay long when questioning reporters after practice today about Johnson's health concern:""It was a car accident, first and foremost, and that's pretty much what I know about it,"" Canales explained. ""Enough to the point where he's in evaluation right now.""According to Joe Person of The Athletic, the linebacker's injuries are not critical but will sideline him for the Panthers' season finale.DJ Johnson was a third-round pick in the 2023 NFL Draft, and his second season with Carolina saw great improvements. He tallied 44 tackles and one assisted sack in 14 games, which more than doubled his output from his rookie season.Though primarily a rotational player with just two starts this season, Johnson has been a significant addition to Carolina's defense. He ranks eighth on the team in total tackles and third among linebackers, trailing only Josey Jewell andTrevin Wallace .With his rookie contract running through 2026, Johnson has promise and will look to bounce back in 2025 after a strong sophomore campaign.While the Panthers are out of playoff contention, they’ve made strides in Year 2 of the Bryce Young era, doubling their win total from 2023.

LaMelo Ball’s father responded to his outburst on $700 haircut deal



LaMelo Ball ’s fiery reaction to an $700 haircut deal has taken social media by storm, sparking widespread debate and humor among fans. The NBA star made his feelings clear in a dramatic outburst as he was far from being impressed with the haircut during negotiations. The incident quickly went viral as fans created a wave of discussion online surrounding the incident. While Ball has yet to elaborate further, the moment has revealed his off-court persona which propelled his father to respond to the incident.LaMelo Ball who has been a standout star for the Charlotte Hornets, was in the discussion following his viral dramatic outburst over a $700 haircut deal. Ball once had a memorable clash with his family over a haircut. Over the years, the Ball family gained popularity in the NBA circles and earned fame through their reality show Ball in the Family, which aired in 2018 and offered fans a glimpse into their lives. In one episode, LaMelo’s father, LaVar, and brother, Lonzo, insisted he cut his hair. LaMelo resisted until LaVar sweetened the deal with $700. Later, during an interview, when someone praised his new look, the Charlotte Hornets star dismissed it with a dramatic response. ""Get this cougar away from me,"" he said.Later, LaMelo’s father LaVar responded to the moment explaining why he wanted his son to get the haircut done despite his reluctance. ""I don't like when he wakes up and it's smashed up against his head where it look like he been sleeping all day,"" LaVar said of the haircut. ""Because now it look like he's not ready to do anything like he just woke up like do I really have to do this. I don't like that look,"" he added.It is worth noting that the incident occurred a while before LaMelo was drafted to the Charlotte Hornets where he is currently playing averaging 30.1 points, 5.3 rebounds, 7.4 assists, and 43.5 field goal percentage.The Charlotte Hornets will face off against the Detroit Pistons without LaMelo as is listed as out due to his left ankle and right wrist injuries. The 23-year-old, however, currently leads all guards in the Eastern Conference for All-Star voting and ranks among the top vote-getters in the East.

posts 542 runs in five games, sets world record:

Ahead of the upcoming eight-match white-ball series (five T20Is and three ODIs) against England and the 2025 Champions Trophy, Shreyas Iyer has once again reminded the national selectors of his blistering form, which has led to a consistent run across formats in domestic cricket.Rescuing his team from a precarious position after they collapsed to 82 for five in the 16th over, the Mumbai captain struck a stunning century (137 not out, 133 balls, 16 fours, 4 sixes) to secure Mumbai's emphatic 163-run victory over Puducherry in their penultimate league match of the Vijay Hazare Trophy (VHT) at the Narendra Modi Stadium on Friday.Since being dropped from India's T20 and Test squads, Iyer has been in scintillating form in domestic cricket. This was the 30-year-old's 14th century in List A cricket and his second of Mumbai's VHT campaign, having started the tournament with an unbeaten 114 against Karnataka in a losing cause. Overall, he has amassed 312 runs in just 225 balls (strike rate 138.66) across four matches.The 2024 IPL-winning captain's other contributions include an unbeaten 44 against Hyderabad and 17 versus Punjab. Earlier, while leading Mumbai to victory in the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy, Iyer scored 345 runs in nine matches at an average of 49.28, with one century and a fifty, his highest score being an unbeaten 130. In the ongoing Ranji Trophy season, Iyer has also impressed with 452 runs in four matches at an average of 90.40, including two centuries.In a cause for concern, India's T20 captain Suryakumar Yadav has hit a rough patch. SKY registered his second consecutive duck, a first-ball dismissal, following a five-ball duck against Punjab in his previous match. Overall, he has managed just 38 runs in four matches in the Vijay Hazare Trophy.Vidarbha batter Karun Nair has achieved a remarkable feat, scoring 542 runs in the Vijay Hazare Trophy before being dismissed for the first time in five matches, setting a world record in List A cricket.Prior to Friday, New Zealand all-rounder James Franklin held the record with 527 runs without being dismissed in 2010.

His consistent performances with the bat have ensured Vidarbha's unbeaten run across all five matches of the Vijay Hazare Trophy.Nair's record-breaking spree began with an unbeaten 112 against Jammu & Kashmir on 23rd December.

IND vs AUS: Rishabh Pant on dropped Rohit Sharma, criticism, Jasprit Bumrah

SYDNEY: The decision to drop a woefully out-of-form Rohit Sharma from the playing XI in the fifth Test was confirmed when Jasprit Bumrah walked out for the toss on Friday. However, the entire cloak-and-dagger manner in which the regular Test captain was removed left more questions than answers.It may be unprecedented for an Indian captain to drop himself because of poor form, but that is no excuse for prevarication on the part of the team management or the BCCI . Removing him may not even immediately alter the outcome of this series but it’s a fact that Rohit was struggling to fit in, given his poor returns with the bat.Tinkering with the XI, by either dropping regular No. 3 Shubman Gill or packing the side with batting allrounders to cover up for top-order failures, was affecting the balance of the side.Bumrah, however, made a cryptic statement at the toss which again raised eyebrows. ""Our captain has shown leadership by opting to rest in this game. That shows there's a lot of unity in this team,"" he said.What is the need for euphemisms like 'rested' when it is clear he has been dropped in the team's interest, a move which Rohit himself would likely support? Why wasn't the decision made official by the BCCI but instead left to all and sundry to speculate about, for more than a period of 24 hours?Why is there still no clarity on Rohit's Test future or his status as regular Test captain? And why talk of team 'unity' when there have been no suggestions of discord within? The next Test after is months away, and in true BCCI fashion a decision will be taken only when it is unavoidable. Rishabh Pant , speaking after the day's play, was more forthcoming but even he drew the line while saying, ""There are some decisions which you are not involved with. It's a very management call, so I was not part of that conversation. I can't explain anything apart from that."" Indian cricket 's bigwigs may be wary of stepping on the toes of its biggest superstars but there are times when the obvious enters the realm of the bizarre. Rohit's unceremonious exit from the Test arena is one such instance.""It was an emotional decision. He (Rohit) has been captain for a long time. We see him as a leader of men,"" Pant said.","Rohit Sharma dropped from India's playing XI for fifth Test against Australia.

""Because as it pertains to Vrabel, it's not necessarily do the Jets want him, but what can they do to make him want the Jets. Vrabel is the top coach available.

Australia clinched a thrilling 184-run victory over India in a dramatic final session of the fourth Test in Melbourne, taking a 2-1 lead in the five-match series. India, needing 340 to win, collapsed to 155 all out, losing their last seven wickets for just 34 runs in 20.3 overs. India appeared to be heading for a draw after Yashasvi Jaiswal (84) and Rishabh Pant (30) steered them to 112-3 at tea. However, Pant's dismissal, attempting a six off Travis Head, triggered a batting collapse.Controversy arose with Jaiswal's dismissal. Initially given not out to a caught-behind appeal, the TV umpire overturned the decision based on visual evidence of the ball changing direction, despite the absence of audible noise. Jasprit Bumrah was exceptional for India, taking 5-57 in the second innings and nine wickets in the match. He had reduced Australia to 91-6 at one stage, a lead of less than 200.The match set a record attendance for cricket in Australia, with 373,591 spectators.

IND vs AUS: Rishabh Pant on dropped Rohit Sharma, criticism, Jasprit Bumrah

NEW DELHI: Is Rohit Sharma dropped or rested? India captain Rohit on Saturday addressed the speculation regarding his absence from the fifth and final Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground.Rohit, who has played three Tests against Australia in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy , has struggled with the bat, averaging just 6.2, with a highest score of 10.During the lunch break on Day 2, Rohit spoke to broadcasters and clarified the reason behind missing the SCG Test .: There were reports suggesting you were rested, dropped, or opted out.: None of that is true. I stood down. I informed the selectors and coach that I wasn't scoring runs, so I decided to step away.""I stood down that is what I would say. Basically the chat I had with the coach and selector was simple: I am not in form, it is an important match and we need a player in form. Not thinking too far ahead, right now what the team needs is the priority,"" Rohit said.""I made this decision after we came here (Sydney), it was going on in my mind that it is important for me to step aside because I wasn't getting runs with the bat.""When I arrived in Perth it was quite evident why we won that game, we had that 200-run (opening) partnership in the second innings which is what won us the game. KL Rahul and Jaiswal played really well, and they brought us into situation where we couldn't lose the game,"" Rohit said.Rohit had stepped away from T20 international cricket last year after leading India to the World Cup, though he has not yet announced his retirement from ODIs.He missed the first Test in Perth for the birth of his second child, and since then, his form has dipped, failing to exceed 10 runs in any of his five innings.This slump in form mirrors his disappointing performance during India's 3-0 home series loss to New Zealand in October-November.","India captain Rohit Sharma has not played in the fifth and final Test against Australia.

IND vs AUS: Rishabh Pant on dropped Rohit Sharma, criticism, Jasprit Bumrah

NEW DELHI: During the lunch break on the second day of the fifth and final Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy , Indian captain Rohit Sharma addressed his absence from the playing XI while lauding the leadership qualities of stand-in skipper Jasprit Bumrah Rohit revealed that his decision to sit out the Sydney Test stemmed from his inability to contribute effectively with the bat. ""I stood down, that is what I would say. Basically the chat I had with the coach and selector was simple: I am not in form, it is an important match and we need a player in form,"" he explained in an interview with Star Sports.Shifting focus to Bumrah, Rohit expressed his admiration for the pacer’s remarkable journey over the past decade. ""The way he [Bumrah] sets standards with the ball, he is absolute class. When I saw him for the first time in 2013, his graph has gone really high ever since and has gone from strength to strength,"" Rohit said.However, Rohit also acknowledged the challenges that come with leadership. ""Nothing is given in this format of the game; you’ve got to earn it. What happens in leadership is, every day will not be a good day. Ideas and mindset can be the same, but sometimes the result won’t work in your favor,"" he added, offering advice from his own experience as captain.The first session of the day saw India’s bowlers deliver a dominant performance, reducing Australia to 101/5 in response to India’s modest first-innings total of 185. Bumrah (2/27) and Mohammed Siraj (2/28) led the charge with two wickets apiece, while Prasidh Krishna , stepping in for the injured Akash Deep, claimed the crucial wicket of Steve Smith just before the break.Reflecting on the match situation, Rohit noted the importance of patience on a challenging pitch. ""The discussion before the start today was that there’s a lot [of assistance for the bowlers] on the wicket, and it will be a game of patience. Our batters struggled, and we knew it wouldn’t be easy for their batters either. The challenge is to maintain pressure consistently, and we’ve taken five wickets in the session. The boys bowled really well, and the catching was excellent as well,"" he said.Looking ahead, Rohit stressed the significance of building on their strong start. ""The next session is going to be really crucial. This is what happens in Test cricket—every session is crucial. We won the previous session; hopefully, we will win the next session as well,"" he concluded.",Rohit Sharma says he stood down because he was not in form.

Watch: Yashasvi Jaiswal fires a cheeky remark at Sam Konstas

India dominated the morning session of day two of the final Test against Australia in Sydney, piling significant pressure on the Australian batsmen. The session saw Australia lose four crucial wickets: Sam Konstas (23), Marnus Labuschagne (2), Travis Head (4), and Steve Smith (33). Mohammed Siraj and Jasprit Bumrah were the standout performers with the ball for India.Australia began their innings at 9 for 1 after Usman Khawaja was caught in the slips off the final ball of Day 1. Jasprit Bumrah captained the Indian team in Rohit Sharma 's absence.Sam Konstas started aggressively, hitting Jasprit Bumrah for two boundaries, including a reverse ramp shot.“Kya ho gaya, ab shot nahi dikh rahe kya? Oye Konstas, shot nahi lag raha kya?” taunted Yashasvi Jaiswal as Konstas began to struggle.Konstas resumed his innings on 7, partnering with Marnus Labuschagne, and scored his first runs of the day with a two off Mohammed Siraj’s opening delivery.Siraj dismissed Konstas for 23, caught by Yashasvi Jaiswal at gully. Konstas's attacking approach ultimately led to his downfall.Labuschagne’s time at the crease was brief as Bumrah induced an edge, with Rishabh Pant completing the catch behind the stumps.Head attempted a counter-attack with a boundary but was dismissed in the same over by Siraj, caught by KL Rahul at slip. Australia found themselves in deep trouble at 39 for 4.Smith and Webster, replacing the dropped Mitchell Marsh, sought to stabilise the Australian innings and rescue their team from a precarious position.Smith was nearing a significant milestone, aiming to become the 15th batsman and fourth Australian to score 10,000 Test runs. The Sydney crowd awaited this landmark with anticipation.However, Prasidh Krishna dismissed Smith just before lunch, caught by KL Rahul. Smith’s pursuit of the milestone will now have to wait.At lunch, Australia were struggling at 101 for 5, trailing India’s first-innings total of 185 by 84 runs. Debutant Beau Webster was unbeaten on 28, with Alex Carey on 4.The Border-Gavaskar Trophy is at stake in this final Test. A win or a draw would see Australia reclaim the trophy, last held in the 2014-15 series. An Indian victory would ensure they retain the title.","India dominated the morning session of day two of the final Test against Australia in Sydney.

NEW DELHI: Rohit Sharma can be best described as a leader, both on and off the field. Although he was dropped from the fifth and final Test against Australia, he was seen engaging with his teammates, including Jasprit Bumrah , during the drinks break on Day 2 at the Sydney Cricket Ground .""The discussion was that there is lot on the wicket and it will be a game of patience,"" Rohit said while speaking to broadcasters.""Our batters struggled and we knew it won't be easy for their batters as well, the challenge is to maintain pressure consistently and we have five wickets in the session.

NEW DELHI: If the opening day of the fifth Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground was dramatic, Day 2 brought even more high-octane action. After bowling out India for a modest 185 on a grassy SCG pitch, Australia found themselves in trouble at the start of their first innings. Jasprit Bumrah , who dismissed Usman Khawaja late on Day 1, struck again early on Day 2 by removing Marnus Labuschagne. Mohammed Siraj then took center stage, producing a game-changing over that left Australia reeling.Siraj’s first breakthrough came with a superb outswinger to Sam Konstas, who drove with hard hands and edged it to Yashasvi Jaiswal at gully, where a stunning catch was taken.Siraj followed it up with another outswinger, this time slightly shorter, which induced a thick edge from Travis Head. The ball flew to KL Rahul at second slip, who made no mistake.Siraj was visibly pumped after his two-wicket burst, with Virat Kohli joining the celebrations in trademark fashion—jumping and pumping his fists with enthusiasm.Kohli then turned to the crowd, waving his arms to fire them up, adding to the electrifying atmosphere at the SCG.Australia, leading 2-1, need a win or a draw to reclaim the Border-Gavaskar Trophy after a decade.

Another controversy erupted early on the first morning of the fifth Test between India and Australia in Sydney when a relay catch involving Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne off Virat Kohli 's bat was ruled by the third umpire as not legitimate.With Indian openers KL Rahul (4) and Yashasvi Jaiswal (10) dismissed early, India were 17 for 2 when Kohli came in to bat and edged the first ball he faced from Scott Boland to the slips, where the Aussie players claimed the relay catch between Smith and Labuschagne.Diving low to his right, Smith believed to have got his fingers underneath the ball before lobbing it in the air for Labuschagne to complete the catch. The decision was referred by the on-field umpires for review, and the third umpire ruled that the ball grazed the ground before Smith lobbed it back up.Talking to Fox Cricket at the lunch break, Smith said he has no doubt that it was a clean catch, but they have to accept the decision taken by the match officials.""Did you get your hand underneath that ball?"" former England player turned commentator Isa Guha asked Smith?""100%, no denying it whatsoever. But the umpires made the decision, and we move on,"" replied Smith.After replays were shown on the giant screen and the third umpire announced his view, Kohli was seen shaking his head with a wry smile on his face.India went to lunch at a shaky 57 for 3, losing Shubman Gill (20) off the last ball delivered by off-spinner Nathan Lyon before the break, leaving Kohli on the crease at 20 not out. He was joined by Rishabh Pant post lunch.Earlier, India left captain Rohit Sharma out of the eleven, with Jasprit Bumrah doing the leadership duty and chose to bat first after winning the toss.India made two changes to their team. Shubman Gill took Rohit's place, while Prasidh Krishna came in for fellow pacer Akash Deep who is out with a back injury.","Third umpire rules Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne's relay catch off Virat Kohli not legitimate.

NEW DELHI: India lost openers KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal early after captain Jasprit Bumrah won the toss and opted to bat against Australia in overcast conditions and a grassy pitch at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Friday. Mitchell Starc dismissed KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal fell to Scott Boland. Virat Kohli arrived at the crease with India at 17/2 in 7.4 overs with the Aussies charged up.With Kohli getting dismissed caught behind the stumps throughout the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy , the Aussies had set the trap with a full slip cordon in place.Boland bowled back of a length delivery that nipped away, took the edge as Kohli pushed at it.The ball went down and Steve Smith at second slip thought he scooped it up but the ball had just grazed the turf before being taken by Marnus Labuschagne at gully.Aussies were delirious when they claimed it. But the third umpire took his time and signalled it not out and Kohli survived falling for a first ball duck.But former Australian opener and coach Justin Langer maintained that Kohli was out.7Cricket shared a post on X with Langer saying, ""From what I have seen there, that makes it more obvious to me that should have been out. Steve Smith had his fingers (underneath the ball), and you could see he was flicking the ball up, it was brilliant what he did. He had his fingers under the ball, he flicked it up deliberately and in my opinion that's out.""Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting also shared his views on the decision, ""As far as I was concerned, if (the ball) had've come out of (Smith's) hand, he wouldn't have been able to scoop it up. That's what I'm saying, I think his fingers are clearly underneath the ball ... look where his pointer figure is there, it's still underneath the ball.""Kohli, from 10 Tests and 19 innings in 2024, scored 417 runs at an average of 24.52 with one hundred and one fifty.That century by Virat was the unbeaten 100 he scored in the first Test in Perth - the match that India won by 295 runs.",India lost openers KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal early after captain Jasprit Bumrah won the toss and opted to bat against Australia.

Sydney: ""We're going to have a look at the wicket and finalise it tomorrow."" ""As I just said, we're going to have a look at the wicket and announce playing 11 tomorrow.""India head coach Gautam Gambhir responded when he was quizzed about the playing XI on eve of the fifth and final Test in Sydney.It was a typical response but what spiced up proceedings was the fact that he was categorically asked about Rohit Sharma 's participation at Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG). Not once, but twice.The response remained the same, even the words to a degree, and certainly raised quite a few eyebrows in the media room. It was Gambhir's first interaction with the media in Australia as the coach mysteriously stayed away after the pre-departure address back in November.He was back in the hot seat at a time when a lot of questions were being raised about the environment in the dressing room, knee-jerk reactions while selecting the XI and the defeat in Melbourne which came after a debatable call to benchThe No. 3 was benched to accommodate Rohit back at top of the order but it didn't work out as the Indian captain's lean patch continued and India were outplayed in the Boxing Day Test.Gambhir was constantly asked about the transition, discussions with senior players and he maintained that ""Indian cricket is in safe hands"" while emphasising the importance of ""honesty"".There was a lot of straight talk during the interaction which lasted a little over ten minutes but it was the sequence of events which followed that added to intrigue of India's last practice session of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy .Moments after finishing the presser, Gambhir engaged in a long conversation with Jasprit Bumrah near the change room as the rest of the lot played foot-volley. Once the warm-up was complete, the head coach made his way to the ground and had a chat with Shubman Gill, who was doing fielding drills at that time with coach T Dilip and Washington Sundar. A short chat was followed by a fist pump, pat on the back and soon Bumrah joined and gave Gill a handshake.The youngster, who was dropped for the Boxing Day Test, continued with more close-in catching drills as the likes of Virat Kohli, Rishabh Pant, KL Rahul, Nitish K Reddy and Yashasvi Jaiswal did some slip-catching. All this while Rohit stood away from the group and didn't participate in the catching drills, which he was very active in before the Melbourne fixture, and was one of the last players to leave the ground as rest of the batters made their way to the nets.Kohli, KL Rahul, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Ravindra Jadeja got the session underway and Rohit, still in his training shorts and sweatshirt, had a long chat with Washington Sundar outside the dressing room.Sundar left and then it was Gill's turn to speak to the skipper and this time they had Bumrah for company too. When the mini-conference was over, all players were sweating it out but Rohit was nowhere to be seen.Kohli, Jaiswal, KL, Jadeja and now Gill too were swapping nets as they continued to face the likes of Sundar, Reddy, Prasidh Krishna, Harshit Rana and a lot of side-arm.The action continued before Rohit finally made an appearance and stood in a corner chatting with video analyst Hari before starting a long, light-hearted chat with Bumrah. The seamer had a ball in his hand and the two cracked plenty of jokes but Rohit didn't look in the mood to have a hit.Players started to leave the area and Rohit exited too, adding to the curiosity of the travelling media contingent. He, however, returned in a few minutes with the batting gear on and had a small hit before India wrapped up their final session of the tour.It wasn't a usual net session as Rohit remains very chatty in the middle and has never stood in a corner, away from all the action. Thursday, however, was different and felt different. Even as the public announcer practiced the names of skippers of the two teams in the main ground, Rohit gave enough hints that he wasn't going to be one for the New Year Test. He has been for quite some time now and it wasn't a surprise that he has been dropped for the final game of the series.All signs in the nets pointed in only one direction and that was Rohit making way for Gill. The coach maintained that the call will be taken on the morning of the match but Rohit's last Test in whites has certainly happened at the Melbourne Cricket Ground and like most stalwarts, he signed off without a farewell match.","India head coach Gautam Gambhir was quizzed about the playing XI on eve of the fifth and final Test in Sydney.

NEW DELHI: India pace spearhead and now captain Jasprit Bumrah is a nightmare not only for batsmen all over the world but also to his team's wicketkeepers.Ahead of the second day's play in the fifth Test between India and Australia in Sydney on Saturday, 7Cricket shared a clip of former Aussie opener Justin Langer asking Rishabh Pant what it's like to keep to Jasprit Bumrah.Pant replies, ""Oh man! It's actually pretty difficult because the kind of angle he creates, sometimes you have to move on one side little quicker and when the edges come on the other side you just have to manage.

NEW DELHI: Australian opener Sam Konstas , who had a heated argument with India captain Jasprit Bumrah , has come under fire for his strategy in the last over of the first day of the SCG Test .Before Usman Khawaja , Australia 's other opener, was caught on the last ball of the day, Konstas engaged in a furious back and forth with Bumrah and his Indian teammates.With Konstas in the line of fire following his aggressive stance towards the opposition, the wicket caused India to celebrate in large numbers.Australia had a tense three overs to negotiate before stumps after India was bowled out for 185 on the first day, but Khawaja's wicket guaranteed that India would have the final laugh.According to a report in Fox Sports, there were suggestions that while Khawaja attempted to soothe his younger teammate, Konstas' flamboyant demeanor diverted him from finishing the day's play.Konstas has been accused of going too far in Sydney after being praised for his courageous approach to his Test debut innings of 60, which included Virat Kohli shoulder bumping him.As India attempt to gain an advantage over the young star and his Australian teammates, Konstas is stepping over the line between bravery and confidence.Several luminaries and commentators, including Adam Gilchrist , offered their thoughts on Konstas' strategy late on the first day.""They're charging in from everywhere … All sorts of drama here,"" Gilchrist said.""It was Bumrah who turned to Konstas. He learns a tough lesson in his second Test match.""The celebration was somewhat unique. Normally it's hands in the air but they all turned and fixed their eyes on one man.""Greats and commentators expressed their disapproval of Konstas' behavior in a chorus on X.","Sam Konstas has come under fire for his strategy in the last over of the first day of the SCG Test.

They only managed to bowl 80 overs in six and a half hours and struggled to create consistent pressure.Pakistan's opening batsman, Saim Ayub, sustained an ankle injury early in the day. He fell awkwardly in the outfield during the seventh over and was taken off the field on a stretcher, unable to return.Pakistan's hopes were briefly raised when Aiden Markram was caught behind off Khurram Shahzad for 17.

Barcelona 's head coach Hansi Flick expressed his discontent on Friday regarding the potential departure of crucial midfielder Dani Olmo due to the club's financial difficulties, while remaining hopeful for a positive resolution.On Tuesday, the Catalan club announced their request to the Spanish football federation for a new playing licence for Spanish international Olmo, following the expiration of his initial registration on December 31, 2024, after Barcelona had exhausted all legal options for extension.Barcelona acquired Olmo for approximately 60 million euros ($62 million) last summer. Spanish media reports suggest his contract contains a provision allowing his release if registration requirements are not met.Due to La Liga 's strict financial regulations limiting Barcelona's expenditure, the debt-laden club initially managed to register Olmo only after Andreas Christensen's injury in August.Striker Pau Victor faces a similar registration predicament.""If I am honest, I was not happy about the situation, and the players are not happy about the situation,"" Flick told a news conference Friday.""But it is like it is and we have to accept it, we are professional, we have to play football. I have to coach and the club has to do their job.""The confidence (in the club) is there, I am always positive about things, but we have to wait for the decision.""Barcelona are set to face Barbastro in the Copa del Rey round of 32 on Saturday, currently without Olmo and Victor.""My job is to prepare the team for the cup,"" continued Flick.""I was in contact before Christmas with the president and I spoke today with the president.""I have the confidence with the club that they do their job and I do my job.""Olmo, 26, a key contributor to Spain's Euro 2024 triumph, has shown excellent form since arriving from Leipzig, scoring five league goals.La Liga stated on Tuesday that ""Barcelona has presented no alternative"" that complies with league spending regulations to enable player registration.The potential loss of Olmo would significantly impact the third-placed Blaugrana's trophy aspirations this season, whilst adding to the club's series of administrative difficulties following years of financial mismanagement.","Hansi Flick expresses his discontent over Barcelona's potential departure of Dani Olmo.

Arsenal 's manager Mikel Arteta emphasises the need for a decisive shift in their pursuit of the Premier League title, as they trail behind Liverpool .Currently in second place after consecutive runner-up finishes to Manchester City, Arsenal face a six-point gap to Arne Slot's Liverpool, who hold a game in hand at the season's midpoint.Following setbacks in October and November, Arsenal found themselves trailing. Arteta stressed on Friday the importance of maintaining consistency as his team prepares for their Saturday fixture against Brighton.""We have to show the same level of consistency and a bit more, because the last year we have been the best team in the league, broken various records and still haven't won a major trophy, so something is missing,"" said the Spaniard.""It's going to be very thin, small details, you can pick up certain games and situations. But at the end, we're so close and we just have to flip that coin to the other side to make it happen. That's only going to happen if we do what we have to do and what we can control. The rest is out of our hands.""In their quest for their first Premier League title since 2004, Arsenal face a setback with Bukayo Saka 's hamstring injury, sidelining him until March following the Crystal Palace match.Regarding player rotation, Arteta stated: ""There's not one player that's going to play nine games in a row in that position, it's impossible.""He further noted: ""We need more threat, we need more players fit and rotation in that unit. In relation to that, we will make decisions and as well, players' performances, that's simple.""Regarding potential January transfers, Arteta remained noncommittal.""The focus is on the players that we have,"" he said. ""When something is in the market that we can afford and believe is going to have a real impact on the team, we have to be open to that possibility. We have the ability to change the squad in the windows, but at the moment the focus is on what we have.""",Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta stresses importance of consistency.
