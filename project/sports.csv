Dwayne Johnson moved to tears after powerful reception at Venice Film Festival

Benny Safdie and Emily Blunt share an emotional moment with Dwayne Johnson



Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson experienced one of the most emotional nights of his career when his latest film, The Smashing Machine, premiered at the Venice International Film Festival. The 53-year-old actor, portraying UFC legend Mark Kerr, was overcome with tears as the audience delivered a thunderous 15-minute standing ovation, among the longest of this year’s festival.Footage from inside the theater showed Dwayne Johnson wiping his eyes while applauding back at the cheering crowd. Standing beside him were his co-star Emily Blunt , director Benny Safdie , and Kerr himself, each visibly shaken by the extended applause. Variety’s co-editor-in-chief Ramin Setoodeh, who shared the moment on X, remarked, “Dwayne Johnson weeps during the 15-minute #Venezia2025 standing ovation for ‘The Smashing Machine.’ This was the most emotion we’ve since on the Lido since Brendan Fraser launched his Oscar campaign here four years ago for ‘The Whale.’”The comparison to Fraser’s Venice triumph quickly sparked speculation about Johnson’s awards season prospects.Fraser went on to win an Academy Award for The Whale, and Johnson’s raw, vulnerable turn as Kerr is already drawing early buzz.Johnson himself acknowledged how transformative the project has been. At a press conference earlier that day, he admitted, “I looked around a few years ago and I started to think, you know, am I living my dream or am I living other people’s dreams? I've been scared to go deep and intense and raw until now, until I had this opportunity.”Safdie, making his solo directorial debut after acclaimed collaborations like Uncut Gems, also broke down during the ovation, clutching Johnson and Blunt as tears streamed down his face. Blunt, who plays Kerr’s now-ex-wife Dawn Staples, stood hand-in-hand with Johnson as the real Mark Kerr wiped his own eyes from the audience.The moment showed how personal the film is for everyone involved. Johnson underwent a dramatic physical transformation to embody Kerr, stepping away from his signature blockbuster action persona. Fans even noticed his lean frame on the red carpet.Also Read: John Cena turns heads as he carries wife Shay Shariatzadeh over puddle during sweet public moment Distributed by A24, The Smashing Machine releases in theaters on October 3.

Hardoi Instagram Missing Husband: 30-sec reel helps UP woman locate hubby who died 7 years back; living with second wife in Ludhiana,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/30-sec-reel-helps-woman-locate-hubby-who-died-7-years-back/articleshow/123663305.cms,"The seven-year vanishing act

The reel that became evidence





LUCKNOW: Forget CID, forget private detectives. In Hardoi, Uttar Pradesh, a wife solved a seven-year-old mystery with just a casual Instagram scroll.Back in April 2017, Sheelu of Murarnagar, Sandila, married Jitendra Kumar (32), better known in his village as Babloo. A few months later, the couple was expecting their first child. But instead of fatherhood, Babloo chose a disappearing act. In 2018, he suddenly vanished without a trace.His family, rather than helping Sheelu search, accused her of murdering him and hiding the body. A missing person’s report was lodged at Sandila police station, but the case soon went cold. For years, Sheelu carried the stigma of being suspected as a “husband killer,” while raising her son alone.Fast-forward to 2025. While scrolling Instagram reels, Sheelu spotted a man dancing happily in Ludhiana. The problem? It wasn’t just any man. It was Babloo — alive, grooving, and flaunting a new woman by his side, who police later confirmed was his second wife.“Sheelu waited seven years. Then one reel ended the suspense,” quipped a police officer involved in the investigation.Furious, Sheelu made the reel viral, then filed a formal complaint.Acting swiftly, Circle Officer Santosh Kumar Singh and his Sandila team — SI Ranjanikant Pandey, Head Constable Diwakar Mishra, and Constable Sunil Kumar — tracked Babloo down in Ludhiana, where he was working at a cloth factory and living a double life. He was arrested under Section 82(1) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (bigamy).Police said Sheelu and Babloo married in 2017, and their son was born in 2018. Just weeks after the child’s birth, Babloo went missing. His family claimed ignorance but secretly filed a complaint suggesting foul play by Sheelu.“Time passed, but he never returned,” Sheelu told reporters, recalling how she was left abandoned and stigmatised during pregnancy. She also alleged that before disappearing, Babloo became abusive, forcing her to return to her parents’ house in late 2017. She only learned he “vanished” when she was four months pregnant.For years, the case remained a mystery. Then came the Instagram reel.Sheelu described her shock when she spotted her missing husband online. Determined, she confronted her in-laws, who admitted the man looked like Babloo but offered no explanation. Meanwhile, residents began sharing the reel widely, and soon the entire district knew the man “long gone” was alive and well.The police investigation confirmed the reel’s authenticity and Babloo’s new life in Punjab. “During the inquiry, it was found that Jitendra married another woman in Ludhiana. He has been taken into custody,” said CO Santosh Singh.For Sheelu, the discovery was bittersweet. “I don’t know why he left me during my pregnancy, when I needed him the most,” she said, adding that her years of waiting ended not with closure, but with betrayal gone viral.","Sheelu married Jitendra Kumar (32), better known in his village as Babloo, in 2017.

Deion Sanders’ advice for Travis Hunter as a new dad



Travis Hunter embraces fatherhood and NFL dreams



Travis Hunter is stepping into fatherhood and the NFL at the same time, and one man who has been by his side throughout this journey is Deion Sanders. The Hall of Famer, who once recruited Hunter to Jackson State and later coached him at Colorado, recently shared heartfelt fatherly advice for the Jacksonville Jaguars rookie as he embraces life’s two biggest milestones — becoming a professional athlete and a dad.For Sanders, Travis Hunter has always been more than a player. Their bond goes back to 2021 when Hunter, then the No. 1 recruit in the nation, shocked everyone by committing to Jackson State instead of a powerhouse like Florida State. He later followed Sanders to Colorado, where he won the 2024 Heisman Trophy as a two-way sensation. Through it all, Sanders played a fatherly role, especially during Hunter’s toughest moments.On the night Hunter lifted the Heisman, his biological father was absent due to legal troubles. Sanders stepped in, embracing the young star in what became one of the most emotional moments of Hunter’s career. Years later, when Sanders was quietly battling a bladder cancer scare and couldn’t attend Hunter’s wedding, the rookie showed up at his coach’s Texas ranch, standing by him as the two shared quiet moments fishing together.“Oh my god, I’m taking a deep breath because I love him to life — I love him like he’s my son,” Sanders said. “It’s funny when your son is now a father… it’s a beautiful thing.“The thing that I told him is let’s correct all the things that we think we didn’t receive as children and let’s do that in our fatherhood. No matter what happens, let’s make sure we are the best darn father that ever walked. That’s what I told him. I’m proud of him, I love him to life, and I miss him dearly.”It wasn’t coach-speak. It was a father figure speaking to someone he considers family.Hunter, just 22, is now a husband and a father. He and his longtime girlfriend, Leanna Lenee, tied the knot earlier this year before welcoming their first child, a baby boy. In a heartfelt video titled “Dear Son…”, Hunter can be heard saying to his newborn, “Gotta be better than me.”The timing couldn’t be more symbolic. On September 7, Hunter will make his NFL debut when the Jaguars face the Carolina Panthers. It marks the start of two parallel journeys: one on the field as a top draft pick, and one at home as a father. With Sanders’ wisdom and his own determination, Hunter now carries two legacies — as a rising NFL star and as a dad committed to doing things right. Fans and critics will be watching Hunter how he make his debut a dreamy one.Also Read: Justin Jefferson injury update: Vikings may take cautious approach as hamstring issue raises long-term concerns","Jacksonville Jaguars rookie Travis Hunter is stepping into fatherhood and the NFL at the same time.

Josh Allen gets emotional over Hailee Steinfeld’s success



Josh Allen manifests a Buffalo Super Bowl parade



Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen has been in the spotlight plenty of times, but his latest candid conversation with NFL Network’s Kyle Brandt might be the most revealing yet. Captured by Hard Knocks cameras during preseason, the exchange showed not only Allen’s pride in his wife Hailee Steinfeld ’s new movie Sinners but also his unshakable belief in bringing a Super Bowl to Buffalo.When Brandt asked Allen about Sinners, the quarterback couldn’t hide his admiration for Steinfeld’s performance alongside Michael B. Jordan. He called the movie “an A+,” adding, “My wife absolutely kills it. And hopefully, awards season coming around, people make the right decisions.”Allen’s praise didn’t stop there. Asked whether it was a hot take to call Steinfeld the most talented person in their household, Allen immediately agreed: “Absolutely not. A thousand percent. And I’m okay with it.” He revealed he was moved to tears at the film’s premiere. “When we watched it at the premier I was crying at the end. I was just so proud of her. I get emotional thinking about it. It was a pretty cool experience.With the Academy Awards scheduled for March 2026, just weeks after the Super Bowl, Steinfeld’s name could well be in the conversation for Best Supporting Actress. That means the Allen household may be preparing for not just one but two unforgettable celebrations this winter.While Allen beamed with pride over Steinfeld, his own dreams remain fixed on Buffalo. He told Brandt that he has already envisioned the Bills’ first Lombardi Trophy parade in vivid detail. “It’s not written down, but it’s up there,” he said of the victory speech he plans to deliver.Allen painted the scene: a frigid five-degree day, buses rolling through icy streets, and thousands of fans filling downtown Buffalo as the team makes its way to City Hall. “I can feel it,” he said. “I see it all. So, gotta turn it into a reality.”For Allen, it’s more than just optimism—it’s manifestation. By speaking his vision into existence, he’s aligning personal pride with professional ambition.

Antonio Brown’s harsh comment overshadows a family celebration

Antonio Brown has never been far from controversy, and this week he managed to stir the pot again. The former NFL wide receiver, once celebrated for his game-changing talent on the field, has built a second reputation for himself—one fueled by impulsive posts and harsh words on social media. His latest target? Colorado star Travis Hunter and his wife, Leanna Lenee, who had just announced the birth of their baby boy.What should have been a moment of pure joy quickly took a turn when TMZ reported the couple’s happy news and Brown responded on X with a cutting remark: “Why they so ugly…” The post immediately caught fire, drawing both laughter from some and outrage from many more. Fans accused Brown of crossing the line by mocking a young couple during such a personal milestone.For Hunter and Lenee, the insult came amid waves of support and congratulations. Their baby boy’s arrival had been widely celebrated, but Brown’s comment cast an unnecessary shadow over the announcement.This isn’t the first time Antonio Brown has made headlines for his behavior off the field. Known for his volatile exits from teams and frequent online rants, he has consistently leaned into his polarizing public persona.But the reaction this time shows that fans are growing less tolerant of his provocations. Social media replies were swift, with many urging Brown to show respect and leave families out of his personal brand of chaos.Also Read: Travis Hunter receives heartfelt fatherhood advice from Deion Sanders, who considers the Jaguars rookie “like a son” While Brown may have succeeded in grabbing attention, the backlash highlights how his legacy continues to drift further away from football greatness and deeper into tabloid-style controversy.

From dream couple to tabloid frenzy and endless speculation

How their breakup exposed the darker side of celebrity relationships



When Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen announced their divorce in 2022, the news shocked fans across the globe. Once celebrated as the ultimate power couple—balancing Brady’s NFL dominance with Gisele’s supermodel stardom—their split quickly shifted from a private heartbreak into a highly publicized spectacle. What should have been an intimate family matter became headline fuel for months, with speculation running wilder than the facts.Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen had long been portrayed as having it all: love, family, and unmatched success. That’s why their breakup was never going to remain under the radar. What intensified the frenzy, however, was the narrative that Brady’s decision to “unretire” from football played a central role in the separation.While neither directly confirmed this, whispers that Gisele had grown weary of his football-first lifestyle dominated media coverage. Social platforms and gossip columns dissected every move—Gisele attending events without Brady, cryptic Instagram posts, and paparazzi shots of her in Costa Rica. The conversation shifted from empathy to voyeurism, fueling the very “media circus” the couple tried to avoid.The Brady-Bündchen divorce highlighted just how little privacy celebrities can maintain in moments of vulnerability. “The downfall of a fairytale” wasn’t just about their marriage ending—it was about the narrative being consumed and reshaped by millions. Every rumor, from custody arrangements to alleged new partners, became public entertainment.For fans, their split became a reminder that even the most glamorous relationships are not immune to strain.

Why Mark Cuban defends Steve Ballmer amid bombshell report of Los Angeles Clippers’ circumvention of NBA salary cap tying to Kawhi Leonard,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/why-mark-cuban-defends-steve-ballmer-amid-bombshell-report-of-los-angeles-clippers-circumvention-of-nba-salary-cap-tying-to-kawhi-leonard/articleshow/123688431.cms,"Mark Cuban, Steve Ballmer and Kawhi Leonard.

Why did Mark Cuban defend Steve Ballmer in the Kawhi Leonard scandal?



LA Clippers break silence as NBA opens an investigation



The Los Angeles Clippers are once again under the league’s microscope after a bombshell report linked star forward Kawhi Leonard and owner Steve Ballmer to a $28 million endorsement deal allegedly designed to dodge the NBA’s salary cap. While the team has denied any wrongdoing, one prominent voice in the basketball world has stepped forward in Ballmer’s defense. Former Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban has recently taken Ballmer’s side and he explained the reason why.The controversy erupted when journalist Pablo Torre unveiled documents and testimony suggesting Leonard’s company, KL2 Aspire LLC, struck a $28 million agreement with Aspiration, a now-bankrupt tree-planting firm financially backed by Ballmer. Torre’s reporting alleged that Leonard barely had to lift a finger under the contract, which included clauses allowing him to decline promotional activity while still getting paid — provided he remained with the Clippers. One former employee of Aspiration described the arrangement bluntly, “to circumvent the salary cap.”For many fans, the setup appeared too convenient. The optics of Leonard being paid millions by a company linked to Ballmer sparked immediate speculation about a backdoor deal.But Mark Cuban wasn’t convinced. Writing on X, he explained where he stood.“I’m on Team Ballmer. As much as I wish they circumvented the salary cap, First Steve isn’t that dumb. If he did try to feed KL money, knowing what was at stake for him personally, and his team, do you think he would let the company go bankrupt? Knowing all creditors would be visible to the world? They got scammed by Aspiration, along with many others. Crimes for which they pleaded guilty last week.”Cuban argued that the more plausible explanation was fraud, not conspiracy. He highlighted the fact that Aspiration had also inked a massive $300 million sponsorship deal with the Clippers in 2021, making it logical for the company to tie Leonard to their brand. “Scammers do scammy things,” he wrote. “It actually makes perfect sense that if they stole money from investors and want the Clippers to succeed, why not give stolen money to help keep their best player?”The Clippers, for their part, have flatly denied Torre’s allegations. In a statement, the organization said: “Neither Mr. Ballmer nor the Clippers circumvented the salary cap or engaged in any misconduct related to Aspiration. Any contrary assertion is provably false.”The team stressed that Ballmer, like other investors, was duped by Aspiration’s fraudulent practices and only became aware of its misconduct once government investigations began.Also Read: Los Angeles Clippers finally issued statement after circumvention of NBA salary cap controversy involving Kawhi Leonard Meanwhile, the NBA has confirmed it is “commencing an investigation” into the matter. Punishments for proven violations could be severe, including heavy fines, lost draft picks, or even voided contracts. With Leonard recently signing a three-year, $149.5 million extension, the stakes are enormous for the Clippers’ future.","Former Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban defended Steve Ballmer in the Kawhi Leonard scandal.

Naomi Osaka’s name often dominates tennis headlines, but her personal life has drawn just as much attention in recent years. Fans frequently ask about her marital status, especially following the birth of her daughter. The four-time Grand Slam champion, however, is not married. Instead, she previously shared a long-term relationship with Grammy-nominated rapper Cordae, with whom she welcomed her daughter, Shai, in July 2023.Naomi Osaka does not have a husband. The 27-year-old tennis star never tied the knot, but she was in a committed relationship with rapper Cordae for several years. Their romance began quietly in 2019 after the pair was spotted courtside at an L.A. Clippers game. For nearly a year, they kept their relationship out of the spotlight, preferring to share only selective glimpses with the public.On January 6, 2025, Osaka revealed on Instagram that their relationship had ended. “Hi everyone, just wanted to say that Cordae and I are no longer in a relationship,” she wrote in her story. She stressed there was “no bad blood at all,” calling him “a great person and an awesome dad” to their daughter.Despite the breakup, Osaka expressed gratitude for their time together, adding, “Honestly really glad our paths crossed because my daughter is my biggest blessing and I was able to grow a lot from our experiences together. ”Cordae Amari Dunston, known professionally as Cordae, is a rapper and songwriter from Maryland. A Grammy nominee, he’s collaborated with artists such as H.E.R. and Young Thug. Beyond music, he’s also been recognized for his social awareness and even received an Emmy for his work on We the People, a project backed by Barack and Michelle Obama.While their romance lasted, Cordae was Osaka’s most vocal supporter. He famously flew across the country during the 2020 U.S. Open to cheer her on, a gesture Osaka once praised on Instagram. In interviews, Cordae spoke warmly about her, even admitting he hadn’t followed tennis closely before they met.Cordae joined Osaka at the 2021 Met Gala and celebrated birthdays and milestones together. Still, their relationship faced challenges, and by late 2023, fans noticed hints of strain when Osaka scrubbed photos of him from her Instagram.The highlight of their relationship came in July 2023 when Osaka gave birth to their daughter, Shai. The tennis star later explained the meaning behind her daughter’s name. “Shai means God’s gift. I wanted her to feel like she was a gift to me and her dad.”Motherhood has profoundly shaped Osaka’s outlook. In her Tubi documentary Naomi Osaka: The Second Set, she revealed struggles with postpartum depression but also emphasized how Shai gave her renewed purpose. “In no world would I ever want my daughter to think that her birth is nothing less than the biggest gift I have ever received,” she said.Also Read: UFC fighter Colby Covington humiliates streamer Chrogman as $30,000 challenge ends in vomit on floor Even after their split, Osaka and Cordae remain committed co-parents.

Reactions to Charles Barkley’s take

The debate over who the GOAT is among Michael Jordan Kobe Bryant , and LeBron James will never end, but Charles Barkley has added a fresh perspective to the conversation. The NBA legend shared his thoughts on the differences between the three players, and why he believes LeBron James stands out as a person.Charles Barkley, who has some free time during the NBA offseason, recently appeared on The Bill Simmons Podcast where he discussed his views on LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, and Michael Jordan.He told Bill Simmons, “The three best players I've ever seen were Michael, Kobe, and LeBron. And I'll tell you the difference in the three... Michael and Kobe are dangerous. They'll kill your a**. LeBron's a nice guy, and that's not a knock. He's still great, great, great, but he's a nice guy. Michael and Kobe aren't nice guys. They're different.”Doubling down on his opinion, Barkley added, “I always tell people the difference between Michael and Kobe, man, they are dangerous. I mean, they really wanted to kill you and humiliate you.”It is to be noted, Barkley made it clear that he never had that killer mentality. “Everybody's not built like that. I'm not even built like that.I think I'm a pseudo-tough guy. I want to win, but I'm just not like those guys.”However, Barkley stopped short of ranking LeBron above Jordan in the GOAT debate. He explained, “LeBron is amazing. What he's done in the community is amazing. In fairness, I wouldn't even put LeBron past Kobe, let's get that out of the way. I want to be fair. The reason I put Michael up there, above those other guys — LeBron has stacked his teams, let's be realistic.”NBA fans agreed with Barkley’s take. One fan wrote on YouTube, “What an incredible interview — great NBA stories, talking about Kobe, MJ, and Bron without hating on any of them (though slight jabs at Bron lol) — and then the detailed discussion about the business aspect of Inside the NBA. Hoping for more of these with more players from the 90s!”Another fan commented, “Chuck has his quirks, but one thing that always shines through whenever I listen to him is that he is genuinely a really good guy.”Also Read: Los Angeles Lakers coach claims Luka Doncic and LeBron James have improved in each other’s company: “I think it’s two-way motivating” LeBron James is currently the most senior active player in the NBA.

'I broke every rule in the book that day': Lalit Modi makes massive IPL revelation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/i-broke-every-rule-in-the-book-that-day-lalit-modi-makes-massive-ipl-revelation/articleshow/123687958.cms,"Lalit Modi (C), owner of Rajasthan Royals team Shilpa Shetty (L) and Owner of Kings XI Punjab Preity Zinta attend the press conference during the Indian Premier League Auction 2010 (Photo by Ritam Banerjee/Getty Images)

Former IPL chairman Lalit Modi has disclosed that he deliberately breached broadcasting rules during the inaugural IPL match in 2008 between Kolkata Knight Riders and Royal Challengers Bengaluru (then Royal Challengers Bangalore).Modi, who now resides in exile in the United Kingdom, was concerned about the viewership of the first game. He decided to override Sony's exclusive broadcasting rights, believing the network's reach was insufficient to generate the necessary audience.""Everything, everything was dependent on that one game. I broke every rule in the book that day. I signed the contract, an exclusive contract with Sony, but Sony didn't have the reach. I said open the signal. Now it was available everywhere, right? And I told all the broadcasters who lost out, all of you, all news channels, go live,"" Lalit told Michael Clarke during a recent podcast. ""Sony said 'I'll sue you'. I said 'Sue me later, forget about it? Ok, we are going live now because you don't have the reach'. I needed everybody to watch the first game. If the first game had flopped, I was dead.""While contemporary media reports do not extensively document these claims, the IPL proved highly successful for both Sony and Modi, who served as a BCCI board member at the time.The relationship between BCCI and Modi later became contentious, leading to legal disputes.In March 2009, BCCI terminated its broadcasting agreement with Sony Entertainment Television and World Sports Group, citing contract violations.Modi subsequently negotiated a new arrangement where Sony regained rights until 2017 for approximately 1.63 billion US dollars (around Rs. 8,200 crore).As part of this deal, World Sports Group received a facilitation fee of 425 crore rupees for relinquishing their claims.This payment drew attention from authorities as BCCI alleged Modi had exceeded his authority in modifying contracts and showing preference to WSG.The matter attracted investigation from the Enforcement Directorate and became part of legal proceedings against Modi.These allegations regarding contract modifications and favouritism toward WSG form a significant portion of the charges Modi currently faces.","Former IPL chairman Lalit Modi has disclosed that he deliberately breached broadcasting rules during the inaugural IPL match in 2008.

The build-up to the FIDE Grand Swiss 2025 in Samarkand has taken a dramatic turn after Uzbekistan’s top Grandmaster, Nodirbek Abdusattorov, delivered a bold statement aimed directly at reigning World Champion D Gukesh.In a light-hearted segment with FIDE’s media team, Abdusattorov was asked to share an “unpopular chess opinion”.Without hesitation, the 20-year-old fired a shot at the Indian prodigy: “Gukesh will lose his title in the next match. Is that controversial?” His comment quickly spread online, sparking debates among fans and pundits about whether it was playful banter or mind games ahead of a crucial tournament.The Grand Swiss carries huge stakes, as both the winner and runner-up earn tickets to the 2026 Candidates Tournament. The eventual winner of the Candidates will then challenge Gukesh for the world title later that year.Watch:For Gukesh, however, the Grand Swiss is not about qualification. As the reigning world champion, the 19-year-old is already guaranteed a place in the title match. Yet he chose to participate, stressing his desire to test himself in the Swiss format.“There are not many super strong open tournaments like this. It’s an opportunity for me to play differently and prove myself,” he said in a press conference on Wednesday.Gukesh also praised the competitiveness of the field, declining to name favourites, and even acknowledged Abdusattorov as “a great champion and competitor.” His calm tone contrasted sharply with Abdusattorov’s jab, underlining the contrasting approaches of the two rising stars.ALSO READ: FIDE Grand Swiss: Divya Deshmukh only Indian female in Open section; D Gukesh, surprisingly, in contention With Fabiano Caruana already securing a Candidates berth and India’s Praggnanandhaa almost certain to qualify via the FIDE circuit, the Grand Swiss promises to be a fierce battleground.

Zimbabwe opener Brian Bennett entered the record books on Wednesday with a rare batting feat in Harare, even as his team went down to Sri Lanka by four wickets in the opening T20 international of the three-match series.Bennett, who top-scored with a fluent 81 off 57 balls, became the player with the highest T20I score without hitting a six among full ICC members. His innings, laced with 12 boundaries, was the bedrock of Zimbabwe's 175-7 at Harare Sports Club. But despite his knock, the hosts could not prevent Sri Lanka from chasing down the target with five balls to spare.The 27-year-old right-hander surpassed the previous record jointly held by Faf du Plessis (79* vs Bangladesh, 2015) and Babar Azam (79 vs New Zealand). Other notable names in the unique list include Mohammad Rizwan (78 vs West Indies) and Ricky Ponting (76 vs India). However, the all-time record across all ICC members remains with Malawi's Sami Sohail, who scored an unbeaten 94 against Lesotho in 2022 without clearing the ropes.Bennett's innings was cut short just 10 runs shy of his personal best in T20Is when he attempted a scoop against Dushmantha Chameera, only to see his stumps uprooted by a perfectly executed yorker. Apart from skipper Sikandar Raza's 28, no other Zimbabwe batter crossed 20, highlighting the lone fight from the opener.For Sri Lanka, Pathum Nissanka continued his dream run with 55 off 32 balls — his 15th T20I half-century — following his dominant performances in the preceding ODI series. A late blitz from Kamindu Mendis (41* off 16 balls) sealed victory for the visitors.Despite Zimbabwe's loss, Bennett's name now finds a unique place in the T20I record books, adding a statistical silver lining to an otherwise disappointing night for the hosts.",Brian Bennett becomes the highest T20I scorer without hitting a six.

Former India spin all-rounder Ravichandran Ashwin has shed light on the lavish yet grounded lifestyle of England wicketkeeper-batter Sam Billings , a former Chennai Super Kings (CSK) player.Speaking on his YouTube channel, Ashwin said Billings comes from immense wealth but has remained down-to-earth despite his privileged background.“Sam Billings is not a normal guy. He owns almost half of Kent. We keep cooks and maids in our houses, but in those countries, to have a chef is a huge deal. His house has separate people for housekeeping, laundry, etc. He comes from that background, but a really, really simple guy,” Ashwin remarked.Billings, who represented Delhi Capitals, CSK, and Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL , never quite lived up to his potential in the tournament. Across 30 matches, he managed just 503 runs at an average below 20 and a strike rate under 130.Reflecting on Billings' IPL struggles, Ashwin said: ""A player like Sam Billings is a hit in other formats; he has even performed very well in the ILT20. I remember he performed well for CSK for a few games but couldn’t sustain that performance.So, he was out of the team.""Ashwin further highlighted the intense pressure overseas players face in the IPL.""There is a lot of pressure on these foreign players.

Inside the story of Saquon Barkley

It’s been a five-year journey. I’ve been using this as my diary, as my therapy,”

“The heart of this film beats strongest away from the stadium, where Saquon’s identity as a father, husband, and friend reveals a man whose priorities transcend yardage and contracts.”

The significance of timing and storytelling

For the first time, fans will be able to see Saquon's life on and off the field in a documentary film directed by David E. Talbert, who has released his share of blockbusters such as ‘Think Like a Man’ and ‘Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey. ’ Saquon announced on the eve of the Philadelphia Eagles' season opener. Titled ‘Saquon,’ the film also features legendary filmmaker Martin Scorsese serving as executive producer, and is set to premiere on Amazon Prime Video on Thursday, October 9, coinciding with an equally significant Thursday Night Football matchup in which the Eagles face Barkley’s former team, the New York Giants.Saquon follows Barkley through his last five years, promising a candid and introspective view of some of the most important events in his life, at least based on press releases and the film's trailer. Fans will witness both the messy contract negotiations with the Giants and the shocking turn that followed, including signing the dotted line for the Eagles and winning a Super Bowl that solidified his legacy. But they'll also see his recovery from ACL surgery.The movie goes far beyond stats and plays of the Eagles' star. The story also dives deep into the personal side of the athlete: his relationships, his role as a father and partner, and the emotional process he describes as both “a diary” and “therapy.” Barkley’s voice rings throughout: “he says in the teaser. The press release adds,Also Read: Saquon Barkley credits Christianity for unlocking the best year of his NFL career The release of the movie isn't just a clever option; it's a strategic option. Throw in the fact that it'll also mark the night Barkley returns to MetLife Stadium to play his former team, and you have a serious narrative juggernaut. Not by coincidence, of course, considering the superstructure of a whole day of Barkley content afterward, moving the spectacle beyond the gridiron.Of course, it doesn't hurt to have a little pedigree; Martin Scorsese executive produces. Scorsese is obviously a cinematic master, and his presence bodes well for a documentary that will delve deeper than the average sports narrative.Barkley is following in the footsteps of Eagles legend Jason Kelce, as Kelce's own version of this film premiered on Prime Video in September 2023. In Saquon, fans are getting a storyline that mixes athletic excellence, personal redemption, and big-screen drama in one package.","Philadelphia Eagles star Saquon Barkley will be the subject of a documentary film.

Forest department officials had a tough time taking the mother-calf duo away from the frenzied crowd as they felt the atmosphere was not right for the health of the newborn.The elephant calf was born around 3am in the forests bordering Katangdih village in the Gharghoda forest range. ""Hume Ganpati ke sakshat darshan hue (We were blessed to have seen Lord Ganesh). We performed puja from afar. The calf has joined the herd and moved away. Now, even if they venture into our fields, we wouldn't stop or chase them away,"" villagers Ghanshyam Rathiya and Mahesh Kanwar said.

""Our team on the spot has been instructed to ensure safety of both the elephants and onlookers,"" he said.Villagers have been calling this a good omen. The mother elephant and calf are in good health,” the DFO said. Gharghoda forest range officer CK Rathiya said, “A herd of 47 elephants has been venturing in the range, out of which 11 shifted to the Chhal area. Around 36 elephants are still here. The calf has now been reunited with the herd. Our teams are monitoring their movement.”Forest staff urged residents not to crowd the site, warning that excessive noise or close encounters could agitate the herd. “We requested people to maintain distance and avoid clicking photographs or making videos from close range,” he said.

Jeff Driskel brings experience to Raiders’ QB room

Why the Raiders signed Jeff Driskel right now

Jeff Driskel, a 32-year-old veteran quarterback, has just signed with the Las Vegas Raiders’ practice squad on Monday, September 1, 2025, in Las Vegas.

Travis Hunter’s NFL debut sparks debate as Jaguars push him to offense and critics call it a mistake,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/travis-hunters-nfl-debut-sparks-debate-as-jaguars-push-him-to-offense-and-critics-call-it-a-mistake/articleshow/123687817.cms,"Travis Hunter (Imagn Images)

Jaguars list Travis Hunter as starting wide receiver despite defensive legacy

NFL veterans warn Travis Hunter may be starting his career on the wrong foot

Travis Hunter entered the NFL with the kind of buzz few rookies ever experience. After becoming the first player to win both the Fred Biletnikoff Award as college football’s top wide receiver and the Chuck Bednarik Award as the nation’s best defensive player, the expectation was clear: Hunter would carry his two-way brilliance into the pros. But the Jacksonville Jaguars’ first big decision on the rookie’s role has already stirred controversy.ESPN insider Adam Schefter recently revealed the Jaguars’ unofficial depth chart, which lists Hunter as a starting wide receiver but only a backup cornerback. That means he’ll line up alongside Dyami Brown and Brian Thomas Jr. on offense while sitting behind Tyson Campbell and Jourdan Lewis on defense.For many, this decision looks like a gamble. Jaguars head coach Liam Coen explained his reasoning, pointing to Hunter’s preseason debut where he made two catches for nine yards in 10 offensive snaps but missed a tackle on defense. “He missed the one tackle defensively that I noticed, like that was the only thing that I kind of noticed,” Coen admitted, while praising Hunter’s offensive choices.Not everyone agrees with Jacksonville’s direction. Two-time Super Bowl champion Logan Ryan voiced his concerns, stressing that cornerbacks can’t simply be rotated in mid-game. “We’re like starting pitchers. We are not relievers. You cannot bring us mid in the inning, that’s different,” Ryan argued.“I wish it was the other way.”His perspective echoes Hunter’s college mentor, Deion Sanders, who has long pushed for his protégé to embrace his two-way legacy. Sanders has called Hunter “phenomenal” and believes the NFL should let him do what few have ever managed.Also Read: Could the Philadelphia Eagles really be the NFL’s next dynasty?

How marriage to Hailee Steinfeld has shaped Josh Allen’s mindset

What it all means for the power couple

As Bills quarterback Josh Allen continues to shine on the stadium fields, he's understandably turning the limelight on off the field too, with headlines blaring how actress-singer Hailee Steinfeld has changed his life. And recently Allen was forced to embrace a new off-field dynamic, and thrillingly admitted, “She’s a rockstar.” The admiration part came after the announcement, with suits at fashion shows in Europe flocking to his wife to the extent that people don’t even recognize him at first.Bills’ Josh Allen recalled travel abroad to Paris and Italy, where Hailee shines in a guest segment on the Fitz and White show. He chuckled, remembering how when they arrived at a hotel, fans would be lined up for her autograph and to take selfies.Even with Allen’s MVP-caliber play on the field itself, Allen is honest about how he plays “second fiddle” at times, but he is perfectly fine with it. And this is a marriage made in the headlines that allowed him to stretch out a hand and diplomatically bow at the feet of his wife and, with humility, appreciate that wife’s stature, as his own leadership in the NFL continues to soar right alongside her fame.Also Read: “I’m planning to…”: Hailee Steinfeld makes candid confession about life with Bills star Josh Allen But this change in his personal life extends well beyond any media appearances, affecting Allen off the field and on it, as reflected by his demeanor during games. His tight end Dalton Kincaid noted the ""personal stability"" brought on from the quarterback's marriage, which has led to ""a demeanor that's a lot more confident, poise on the field."" Kincaid even described Allen as having taken on a kind of new ""aura"" about himself.On top of that, Allen got emotional when attending a screening of Sinners, Hailee's new movie. He spoke about getting emotional during the premiere and joked that he might just be ""the second most talented person"" in their marriage, an adorable and self-deprecating bit that shows his admiration.The modern-day celebrity relationship and self-awareness we could all use in a world where peacocking is the dominant strategy. One side sees the NFL MVP quarterback with unparalleled on-field ability, the other a spouse who supports and accepts his husband in the spotlight. And the marriage to Hailee Steinfeld is about more than romance; it is a stabilizing force, a grounding point, and an exercise in humble leadership.Allen is settling into his role off the field as well, not just the star quarterback, but also as a husband who supports his star wife. And on the track, that calmness and encouragement could be the subtle edge that defines his next chapter, and his team’s.","Bills' Josh Allen recalled travel abroad to Paris and Italy, where Hailee shines in a guest segment on the Fitz and White show.

"Prince Philip’s blunt warning to Kate Middleton on royal life: ‘You’re not a celebrity’; report reveals why he told her, ‘Never look at camera’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/prince-philips-blunt-warning-to-kate-middleton-on-royal-life-youre-not-a-celebrity-report-reveals-why-he-told-her-never-look-at-camera/articleshow/123662014.cms,"



Prince Philip once offered Kate Middleton a blunt piece of advice that has since shaped her path as a senior royal: “You’re not a celebrity. You represent the royal family.”The revelation comes from Gyles Brandreth’s 2021 biography “Philip: The Final Portrait,” recently revisited by Hello! magazine. According to the book, the Duke of Edinburgh cautioned the then-new royal against treating her public role like stardom, warning her that personal attention could lead to trouble.""If you think the attention is on you personally, you’ll end up in trouble,"" Philip told her. ""The focus is on your role, what you do, what you support. It’s not focused on you as an individual.""He even shared a practical “golden rule”: avoid looking at cameras during engagements. Instead, Philip explained, Queen Elizabeth II always directed her gaze toward the person she was speaking to, never the photographers.Royal commentators say this guidance proved pivotal. Broadcaster Helena Chard told Fox News Digital that Philip’s mentorship helped Kate weather media storms with dignity. “She was taught by the best… her humility and discretion, combined with Philip’s advice, have given her the strength to breeze through challenges,” Chard said.Fellow royal expert Hilary Fordwich agreed, noting that Kate naturally embraced tradition, service, and stability. “He made it blatantly clear that royalty and celebrity are two completely different things,” she said. “That’s why she avoids seeking attention for personal fame.”Philip, who supported Queen Elizabeth II for more than 70 years, reportedly admired Kate’s level-headedness and was relieved Prince William had found such a partner. Biographer Penny Junor once told the Daily Mail that despite her non-aristocratic background, Kate adapted seamlessly to palace life.""Kate shines in her own light, but she knows her place in the royal family,"" Junor said. ""I think Kate is a bit like Prince Philip, who has always supported Queen Elizabeth II.""","Prince Philip once told Kate Middleton: ""You're not a celebrity.

Scottish brothers back on shore after completing record 139-day row across Pacific,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/scottish-brothers-back-on-shore-after-completing-record-139-day-row-across-pacific/articleshow/123624310.cms,"



CAIRNS: Three Scottish brothers stepped ashore in Australia on Saturday after claiming a new record for rowing non-stop and unsupported across the Pacific Ocean, ""over the moon"" to be back on dry land.Ewan, Jamie and Lachlan MacLean set off in a carbon fibre dinghy from Lima in Peru in April for the 14,500 kilometres journey, enduring violent storms and sickness during their 139 days at sea.At one point Ewan was swept overboard before being pulled back into the boat, while they battled exhaustion and feared running out of food. ""The fastest human-powered crossing of the full Pacific Ocean, non-stop and unsupported,"" they said on social media after arriving in Cairns. ""After 139 days at sea, we are over the moon to be back on land with our friends and family,"" they added.The brothers, from Edinburgh, were given a bagpipe welcome in front of family and friends after the treacherous ordeal, which garnered support from celebrities including Mark Wahlberg and Ewan McGregor. ""Things got tough towards the end and we seriously thought we might run out of food,"" said middle brother Jamie.""Despite how exhausted we were, we had to step up a gear and make it before supplies ran out, but now we get to eat proper food. ""While the mid-Pacific - from California to Hawaii - is well travelled, relatively few have attempted the full Pacific from South America to Australia. Lithuanian solo rower Aurimas Mockus had to abandon his crossing attempt this year due to Tropical Cyclone Alfred. ""This has been the hardest thing I've ever done, and I couldn't have even contemplated it without my brothers,"" said Ewan. ""There have been countless setbacks to overcome, some leaving us lost, but we've always lifted each other up. ""Days before landing in Cairns, brothers said they had to battle currents off the coast. ""We're going to be rowing three up as we navigate through the Great Barrier Reef and away from shipping lanes, all while fighting against horrendous winds,"" they said.The brothers were raising money for clean water projects in Madagascar. They broke three world records crossing the Atlantic Ocean in 2020, without ever having rowed professionally, making the journey from La Gomera in Canary Islands to Antigua in 35 days.","Ewan, Jamie and Lachlan MacLean set off in a carbon fibre dinghy from Lima in Peru in April.
