Bihar election: How Rahul Gandhi tuned Congress’ Bihar pitch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-election-how-rahul-gandhi-tuned-congress-bihar-pitch/articleshow/124353012.cms,"PATNA: Until June this year, Congress looked desperate. It first replaced the party’s 74year-old Bihar in-charge Mohan Prakash by a rather young Krishna Allavaru and then appointed Rajesh Kumar, a Dalit face, as state president, removing Akhilesh Prasad Singh, who came from the upper caste Bhumihars. But nothing seemed to make a difference.Then came EC’s decision to conduct a Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls. Congress found a cause, dubbing the exercise as a conspiracy to strike opposition voters off electoral rolls. Congress fused it with its broader claim that all BJP victories since 2014 were facilitated by “vote fraud”. Rahul Gandhi started Voter Adhikar Yatra, invited INDIA bloc big names like M K Stalin and Akhilesh Yadav.But will it influence voters? One clue comes from the subdued response of Congress and other opposition parties to the final electoral roll published on Sept 30. That reaction was anticlimactic. And this, when SIR did result in the deletion of 0.4 million “ineligible” names from the draft voters’ list. Significantly, even during the Voter Adhikar Yatra, grumbles could be heard about how it pushed “bread-and-butter” issues off centre stage, giving Nitish Kumar crucial time to repair a potential point of vulnerability.But the Yatra helped Congress acquire a profile it lacked. It upstaged RJD, its senior partner, which had planned to launch its own protest against SIR.Congress’s enhanced confidence is indicated by its refusal to defer to RJD’s insistence that Tejashwi should immediately be projected Mahagathbandhan’s CM candidate.","Congress found a cause, dubbing the exercise as a conspiracy to strike opposition voters off electoral rolls.

Bihar assembly election: Why Prashant Kishor’s poll debut could upset old equations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-assembly-election-why-prashant-kishors-poll-debut-could-upset-old-equations/articleshow/124352932.cms,"PATNA: Many might still remember the slogan “Bihar me bahaar hai, Nitish -e Kumar hai ” (Bihar is a happy place because Nitish Kumar is on the throne). Coined by poll strategist Prashant Kishor (PK) , during the 2015 assembly elections, it was part of Nitish Kumar’s effective campaign after he joined hands with RJD and Congress to outdo the BJPled NDA.This time, Kishor is himself in the fray as the leader of the party he launched last year, Jan Suraj — hoping to pull off an upset of the same magnitude as AAP’s shock win in Delhi in 2015.That may look unrealistic. But PK cannot be accused of not trying. He has extensively toured the state and, using the experience he accumulated while organising campaigns for others, launched a bold campaign which audaciously targets the established players.Initially and for a long time later, he targeted RJD chief Lalu Prasad and his “family first” ethos, which had fuelled the rise of Tejashwi, NDA’s primary opponent. But he has also trained his guns at the NDA, of late.PK’s message is simple: the established players, who have alternatively been at the helm over the last two and a half decades, share the responsibility for the state’s backwardness and cannot be trusted to improve matters.The message is specifically aimed at young people, who are angry about the lack of employment opportunities and are being forced to migrate to states where they are unwelcome. It is amplified by a combination of pluckiness and freshness, innovative use of social media and the fact that he was first off the campaigning blocks.Observers believe that the platform offered by PK — who happens to be a Brahmin — may resonate, especially with youth from the upper castes. Unlike OBCs, who have the satisfaction of seeing their own man in office or are hoping to see their man in office, upper castes cannot expect to receive any such compensatory benefit in a state where they have been excluded from the leadership race because of their numerical disadvantage. They have seen their numbers in services shrink from what they were before the introduction of reservation, and also because of the diminished power of the elite among them to influence jobs through the patronagedispensing network.But he faces the risk of getting squeezed out of the race in what is essentially going to be a bipolar contest in large parts. The challenge for him is to appear viable and avoid being a “vote katua ”, a spoiler. That would require him to find candidates who appear winnable (read resourceful) and, at the same time, are aligned, in terms of image and credentials, with his promise to be an agent of change.Kishor can, of course, lend strength to his candidates by contesting one of the seats: something that would convey his commitment to electoral politics. He has in the past helped his “clients” overcome similar challenges on turf he did not belong to. But the strategist will have to dig deeper into his bag of tricks and expand it when he himself is at the wicket on the home ground.","Prashant Kishor is himself in the fray as the leader of the party he launched last year, Jan Suraj.

'No Confusion Regarding CM's Face' Tejashwi Yadav’s Sharp Reply on INDIA Bloc CM Candidate

NEW DELHI: The battle royal of 2024 put the opposition back in the opposition benches. But only just, with the unmistakable message from the power play being that after a decade of reeling from Modi-led BJP 's cycle of victories, the anti-BJP bloc was robustly ascendant.Over a year-and-a-half later, the scenario for INDIA bloc has shifted firmly back to the gloomy days of pre-2024, with BJP having stolen convincing victories from expected defeats in Haryana and Maharashtra, making its equally embarrassing losses in Jharkhand and J&K a sideshow. This post-2024 context makes the coming battle for Bihar more consequential nationally, far outweighing the otherwise equally crucial local questions like if RJD can return to office after a hiatus of two decades, and if it can stop BJP from emerging from the shadow of allies to become the single-largest player in state for the first time in its history.By general reckoning, Bihar will be watched for whether opposition still has the resilience that put it within striking distance of winning in national contest last year, despite adverse circumstances skewing the playing field in favour of the incumbent.It is, by universal acceptance, an uphill task for INDIA bloc. The BJP-JDU combine is looking to use incumbency to its advantage, like by announcing massive doles for women voters in the run-up to the polls, backed by the face of Modi, with CM and JDU chief Nitish Kumar as the solid ally. The equation brings with it caste engineering that has helped the governing combine to tide over challenging circumstances, like in the narrow win in 2020 in the shadow of Covid pandemic.INDIA bloc believes it has done the basics right, like getting the allies together and running an early statewide campaign of cohesion through 'Vote Adhikar Yatra' headlined by Rahul Gandhi, with Tejashwi Yadav and others in tow. The outrage over voters' list revision turned out well for the alliance as SC stamped on its demand for enlarging the basket of documents for voter registration. If a chord was to be struck through the efforts, it happened.But taking on BJP-JDU is a challenge. The caste net of the two allies, from upper castes to weaker backward classes, is a solid foundation, and much would depend on how far the rainbow alliance of Congress-RJD-CPI (ML)-VIP has succeeded in socially denting the rival camp in past couple of years since they came together with a purpose.If RJD managed to run the rivals ragged five years ago, it was helped by the unrest caused by grievances over Covid relief and Chirag Paswan's contesting solo, with LJP's gun trained on CM Nitish. This time, Paswan is an ally of BJP-JDU, which is a huge plus for the governing combine.Sources said positives for opposition are Nitish's Muslim voters are angry over waqf law & BJP's unmitigated 'communal' rhetoric. Also, there is hope that most backwards are not sure of his primacy in the alliance, with doubts about his becoming the CM, which could persuade them to go for opposition - a possible reason Tejashwi has been talking about Nitish's 'erratic behaviour', claiming he is in ""achet awastha"" (an unconscious state). The other hope is that pollster-turned-politician and Jan Suraaj Party chief Prashant Kishor would dent the BJP-JDU support base and help opposition.","Bihar will be watched for whether opposition still has the resilience that put it within striking distance of winning in national contest last year.

When hockey legend Wayne Gretzky first met Janet Jones , neither of them could have predicted that a chance encounter on a television set would grow into a lifelong love story. Today, the couple shares over three decades of marriage, five children, and a reputation as one of sports’ most enduring power couples.The pair first crossed paths in 1981 on the set of Dance Fever, where Wayne Gretzky was a celebrity guest judge and Jones a dancer. Though sparks didn’t fly right away, their story reignited six years later. In 1987, they ran into each other at a Los Angeles Lakers game — Wayne Gretzky with his friend Alan Thicke and Jones with a girlfriend. That night, the casual meet-up led to dinner and a conversation that revealed how similar their outlooks on life were.“We got along very well the first time we sat and actually chatted with each other,” Wayne Gretzky later recalled. “Mindset was very similar and our goals were the same in life. We started off that night where we were both on the same page. It makes life that much more simple.”Their whirlwind romance moved quickly. Gretzky proposed over the phone while Jones was away filming, and in July 1988, the couple married in Edmonton in what was famously described as a “wedding of royal proportions.”Thousands of fans lined the streets to witness the ceremony, and the event became a city-wide celebration.Family soon became the heart of their relationship. Their first daughter, Paulina, was born later that year, followed by four more children over the next 15 years. Despite busy careers — Gretzky rewriting hockey history and Jones pursuing acting — both prioritized raising their family. “Our goals were the same in life. Family was of number one importance,” Gretzky said.Also Read: Inside Sidney Crosby and Kathy Leutner’s private love story that has lasted more than 15 years From their early connection to their life as parents and grandparents, Gretzky and Jones have shown that the Great One’s greatest victory may well be found off the ice.","The pair first crossed paths in 1981 on the set of Dance Fever.

Vanessa Bryant has proudly been a dog mom for many years

Vanessa Bryant warmed hearts online once again. Vanessa shared sweet moments with her furry companion. The 43-year-old businesswoman and philanthropist shared a pair of endearing photos on her Instagram Story, cuddling with her tiny white puppy. Playfully setting the moment to Meghan Trainor’s ‘I’m a Dog Mom’ and Lil Baby Grand’s ‘DtMF’ (Piano version), Bryant gave her 15.6 million followers a glimpse of her soft, humorous side while teasing that she’s officially embracing her “dog mom” era.Vanessa Bryant’s Instagram feed is often filled with loving snapshots of her daughters, but her latest post shifted focus to another member of the Bryant household— the family’s adorable teacup dog. The photos showed her holding the fluffy pup close, planting gentle hugs, and sharing what looked like an afternoon of pure affection.Fans immediately recognized the tiny dog that has made recurring appearances in her posts over the past year. Earlier this summer, Bryant posted about the same pup after it accidentally smeared red lipstick across its fur, leading to a hilarious and heartwarming cleanup moment. Despite the mischief, Bryant couldn’t resist showing love, sealing the moment with another sweet kiss.It’s not the first time she’s shared glimpses of their bond. In a past post, she captured her pet sound asleep on her lap, writing, “Can’t move now,” proving that even a small dog can take over her heart— and her couch. The Bryant family has also been seen traveling with the little companion, with Natalia Bryant once posing with it during a walk through Central Park in New York City.Vanessa’s affection for her pets goes beyond the occasional social media post. Alongside her teacup pup, she’s also mom to a German Shepherd named Loki , who joined the family in early 2022. “My girls are happy,” she wrote at the time, sharing a photo with her daughters and their new “Big Boy.” Loki’s arrival helped fill the void left by Crucio, the beloved family dog who passed away just a month prior.""We love you, Crucio,"" she wrote in her farewell post. ""Thank you for everything sweet boy. Thank you for watching over us. We’re going to miss you. #GoodBoy #RestEasy.""Over the years, Vanessa Bryant has used her platform to share moments of love, family, and healing. Vanessa who was married to NBA legend Kobe Bryant, share 4 children Natalia, Gianna, Bianka and Capri. Tragically, Kobe and Vanessa’s second daughter, Gianna died at the age of 13 alongside her father in 2020 in the devastating helicopter crash at Pacific View Memorial Park and Mortuary in Corona Del Mar, California.Also Read: Klay Thompson shares cozy romantic photo with Megan Thee Stallion after dodging reporter’s question about their relationship","Vanessa Bryant shared a pair of endearing photos on her Instagram Story, cuddling with her tiny white puppy.

Klay Thompson shares a subtle Instagram post following a viral press moment



Megan Thee Stallion and Klay Thompson’s romance stays strong



Klay Thompson and Megan Thee Stallion are keeping the spark alive both online and off the court. Just days after the Dallas Mavericks star avoided a question about his romance during Media Day, he surprised fans with a set of intimate photos featuring the Grammy-winning rapper. The post, captioned “THE BEST THING IN LIFE IS LIFE,” offered a glimpse into their easy affection, marking another public show of love from the high-profile couple.The NBA veteran’s Instagram drop came shortly after a now-viral moment during Mavericks Media Day, when a reporter asked how his relationship with Megan Thee Stallion had influenced him “on and off the floor.”Klay Thompson initially appeared confused, repeating, “My relationship with?” before realizing the question’s intent. He quickly shut it down, replying, “I’m not going to talk about that, but I will say every summer hasn’t changed for me. Because I know what it takes to go the distance and there’s really no such thing as an off-season.”The response sparked mixed reactions online— some fans praised his privacy, while others noted the irony of his romantic post appearing so soon after. Still, Thompson’s guarded approach toward the media isn’t new.Known for his calm, introspective nature, the four-time NBA champion has often preferred answering with select words.The couple, who went public over the summer, seems unfazed by public scrutiny. Megan has also shared glimpses of their time together— from golf dates and yacht trips to charity events. Their first red carpet appearance came at Megan’s Pete & Thomas Foundation gala, where the rapper gushed about her boyfriend.""This is my first relationship where I’ve ever been with somebody who’s genuinely a nice person, and he makes me genuinely happy,"" she told Page Six. “I just never dated somebody like him before and I’m just grateful that he’s here by my side and he feels the same way about me.”Despite the media’s curiosity, the pair seems focused on balance. She is preparing for new music releases, and Thompson is for another NBA season. And Thompson’s recent post shows that he is not very comfortable discussing his private romantic life with reporters, but he will certainly celebrate his love with Stallion on social media.Megan Thee Stallion and Klay Thompson quietly made their relationship public in early July 2025, sparking a wave of excitement online. The rapper first dropped a few swimsuit photos by a luxury pool, but fans quickly noticed the real detail— a man relaxing in the background who looked a lot like the Dallas Mavericks star. It didn’t take long before people started connecting the dots. Both Stallion and Thompson often share their sweet moments of togetherness on social media.

Alex Ovechkin’s journey to greatness and the woman who stands beside him

Anastasia Shubskaya’s life before marriage: modeling, film, and family legacy

Ovechkin family: legacy of love and sport

For years, the famed Washington Capitals captain Alex Ovechkin, now the all-time leading goal scorer of the NHL , has exerted his domination in the rink with power and laser-target precision. Behind his glories, there stands a woman who kept quietly weaving the other side of his world — that woman being Anastasia Shubskaya. Their love story is of perfect timing, of dedication, and of merged dreams, entwining sports, glamour, and family into one gifted tapestry.When, in April 2025, Alex Ovechkin came to surpass Wayne Gretzky's goal record, the hockey world cheered for the achievement and for the family who stood by his side with pride. Anastasia, as well as their two boys, Sergei and Ilya, were on the ice, amongst the cheering crowd, celebrating the man who had manifested greatness into a new vision.At the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, they met for the first time, exchanged numbers, and lost contact with each other in no time. Social media fever rekindled the flame of their old acquaintance into something far more serious over a few years. The couple finally tied the knot in a private ceremony in Russia in 2016, followed by a grand reception in Moscow.Together, they have continued to forge stronger and deeper connections through each personal and professional milestone.Long before becoming Mrs. Ovechkin, Anastasia named herself in Russia. She, daughter of Vera Glagoleva, late actress and director-had a film and culture-packed upbringing. Studying at the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography in Moscow, she entered modeling as well as film production. She was admired for her grace and force of presence in the several films and fashion campaigns she appeared in-had she not been overtly associated with her famous family. Long before the story of Ovechkin came into the public gaze, she was an embodiment of charm and ambition.The family life of the Ovechkin family reflects those values shared by the parents perfectly. Their sons, Sergei and Ilya, are very popular among the fans and often accompany their father to games. The name Sergei is in memory of Alex’s late brother and shows the depth of the player's commitment to family and honor.Alex himself comes from the highest sporting traditions. His mother, Tatyana Ovechkina, is a two-time Olympic gold medalist in basketball, and his late father, Mikhail Ovechkin, was a professional soccer player. The number 8 on Ovechkin's jersey derives from his mother, and with every goal he scores, he keeps close to his heart the memory of his brother Sergey.Ovechkin has been seen back in full-contact practices with the Caps; this was a true indication that he is quite spot-on, armed up for the 2025–26 NHL season, translated to the full participation of the NHL for the coming season.The remarkable achievement of Alex Ovechkin is made possible through both his ability with hockey and the unwavering love and support of Anastasia Shubskaya. From as far back as her model and film days, right through to life as a devoted wife and mother, she has remained a silent yet indispensable factor in hockey's greatest tale — the heart behind the legend.Also Read: Scott Laughton injury update: Maple Leafs forward expected to miss weeks of action",Washington Capitals captain Alex Ovechkin married Anastasia Shubskaya in 2016.

“Kansas City Chiefs had a little sort of injury scare, I would say. Yesterday, Xavier Worthy popped up on the injury report with an ankle, along with his shoulder. My understanding is kind of just turned his ankle a little bit, woke up swollen. They put it on the report. He is fine. He is expected to go. More of a precaution than anything else. Worthy has been excellent since he returned, playing with that torn labrum.”

“I'm told that while the Chiefs have Xavier Worthy listed as questionable (shoulder/ankle), the expectation is he will be okay for MNF against the Jaguars. We'll see how his body feels tomorrow, but KC is hopeful he'll be able to go.”

Connor McDavid stays composed amid speculation

As the Edmonton Oilers prepare for the 2025-26 NHL season, all eyes are on their captain, Connor McDavid, who is entering the final year of his eight-year, $100 million contract. Despite his incredible impact on the franchise, McDavid’s future in Edmonton remains uncertain and according to NHL insider Darren Dreger, that uncertainty is starting to make the organization nervous.During a recent segment, Dreger revealed that Oilers owner Daryl Katz is becoming “a little antsy” as Connor McDavid continues to deliberate on his next move. While Darren Dreger clarified that there’s “no animosity” between McDavid and the front office, he admitted there’s growing unease within the organization about the lack of progress.“There's no animosity here,” Dreger explained. “Is there nervousness building? Sure, you know, I mean, Daryl Katz is probably getting a little antsy, the owner of the Edmonton Oilers. And then that message would be delivered to Jeff Jackson and on to Stan Bowman, the general manager.”Dreger noted that Edmonton is “ready to close whenever Connor is ready,” but the timeline remains entirely in Connor McDavid’s hands. He estimated the chances of an extension happening soon at “50-50” and suggested that any potential deal could be short-term, possibly just two years, a prospect that could unsettle both management and fans.While some worry about the distractions, NHL analyst Eddie Olczyk believes McDavid won’t let the situation affect his performance. “Well, I don't think it's going to hang over Connor McDavid because, just, he breathes different air,” Olczyk said. “I don't think it's going to affect him one bit.”Also Read: Edmonton Oilers reportedly exploring shocking reunion with 40-year-old Marc-Andre Fleury Since his debut in 2015, McDavid has consistently proven to be a generational player, leading Edmonton to consecutive Stanley Cup Final appearances and surpassing the 100-point mark eight times.

Travis Hunter’s development is still a major storyline for the Jaguars



Travis Hunter entered the NFL as one of the most hyped rookies in years. The Jacksonville Jaguars drafted him No. 2 overall in 2025 after he won the Heisman Trophy at Colorado, where he starred on both sides of the ball. But his NFL role so far has been limited, and his status heading into Monday Night Football against the Kansas City Chiefs is in question.Let’s see where things stand.Yes, Travis Hunter will be available for the Jaguars on Monday Night Football. Hunter is not listed on Jacksonville’s final Week 5 injury report, meaning he is cleared to play against the Chiefs.Through four games this season, Hunter has played 260 total snaps, 159 on offense at wide receiver and 101 on defense at cornerback. His impact has been uneven, with Pro Football Focus grading him higher on defense (69.6 overall) than offense (54.5 overall).The Jaguars have yet to give Hunter the same freedom he enjoyed at Colorado. Injuries to the secondary forced him into more defensive snaps in Weeks 2 and 3, while Week 4 saw him back on offense with a season-high 42 receiving yards against the San Francisco 49ers. Head coach Liam Coen has emphasized patience, saying Hunter is “very coachable” and still adjusting to the speed of the NFL.The Jaguars host the three-time defending AFC champions on Monday Night Football. Jacksonville is 3-1 and off to its best start since 2018, while Kansas City enters at 2-2 after back-to-back wins.Here’s everything you need to know:Patrick Mahomes leads the Chiefs after throwing four touchdowns in their Week 4 win over the Baltimore Ravens. On the other side, Trevor Lawrence and running back Travis Etienne aim to continue Jacksonville’s surprising rise under new coach Liam Coen.Hunter has shown flashes of the two-way talent that made him a national star in college, but the Jaguars have been cautious with his usage. Through four games, he has 13 catches for 118 yards on offense and 11 tackles with one pass breakup on defense.Pro Football Focus grades suggest he has been more effective in coverage than as a wideout, but Jacksonville continues to view him as a long-term weapon on both sides. For now, Hunter’s playing time is situational, dictated by injuries and matchups.His wife, Leanna Lenee, has also become a fan favorite in Jacksonville, building a strong social media following with gameday outfits and family updates. The couple married in May 2025 and welcomed their first child in August.Hunter’s journey is only beginning, and Monday night against Mahomes and the Chiefs gives him another chance to prove why he was one of the most coveted prospects in recent memory.","Travis Hunter is not listed on Jacksonville’s final Week 5 injury report, meaning he is cleared to play against the Chiefs.

Game Dynamics and Season Outlook

Thewill open their 2025-26 NBA preseason campaign on October 6, 2025, setting the tone for what promises to be an exciting season ahead. This matchup will be less about the scoreboard and more about assessing player fitness, lineup depth, and early chemistry among young prospects. With both teams managing significant absences due to injuries and rest strategies, the game will serve as an important checkpoint in evaluating each roster’s readiness before the regular season tips off.The Oklahoma City Thunder will approach their preseason opener with caution, prioritizing long-term health over short-term results. Head coach Mark Daigneault will rest several of his key contributors, including star guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who will sit out for rest. Rising big man Chet Holmgren and defensive anchor Lu Dort will also be rested, along with newly acquired center Isaiah Hartenstein.Jalen Williams will continue to recover from wrist surgery and will not participate in the game. Rookie Ajay Mitchell will remain sidelined with an ankle sprain, while veteran Kenrich Williams will still be unavailable following knee surgery.In addition, young forward Thomas Sorber will continue his recovery from a torn ACL suffered during offseason training.On a positive note, Cason Wallace - who had previously rested in the last game - will be available to play. His return will be particularly significant, given his Dallas roots and strong fan following in the area.With a busy preseason schedule ahead, the Oklahoma City Thunder will carefully manage workloads to avoid unnecessary injuries. The coaching staff’s plan will focus on giving bench players and emerging prospects extended minutes to prove their worth. This developmental approach will align with Oklahoma City’s long-term goals, especially as they prepare for their championship ring ceremony and home opener later in October.The Dallas Mavericks will face their own set of challenges entering the preseason. Star guard Kyrie Irving will remain sidelined as he continues recovering from a left ACL tear sustained last season. Early projections indicate he could return by January 2026, leaving the team to adjust its offensive schemes in his absence.Center Daniel Gafford will also be unavailable due to a sprained ankle suffered during training camp and is expected to miss two to three weeks. Brandon Williams, meanwhile, will deal with a hamstring strain that could keep him questionable heading into the start of the regular season.Despite these setbacks, the Dallas Mavericks will receive a major boost with Anthony Davis expected to suit up. Davis, coming off eye surgery, will wear protective gear during games but is fully cleared for action. His return will inject leadership and defensive presence into the frontcourt, providing stability amid roster uncertainty.The Dallas Mavericks ’ preseason agenda will center around introducing new offensive structures under assistant coach Jay Triano and evaluating the progress of their younger players. Dereck Lively II and rookie sensation Cooper Flagg will both see significant minutes, while Ryan Nembhard will compete for a role in the backcourt rotation. The absence of Irving will create opportunities for the team to experiment with different combinations and test how effectively their supporting cast can adapt to expanded roles.Given the long list of absences for both sides, the preseason opener will emphasize player development and depth testing rather than the final result. The Oklahoma City Thunder’s focus will remain on rest management and providing young players with meaningful game experience, maintaining their long-term vision for a sustainable and healthy title defense.For the Dallas Mavericks, the contest will be about finding rhythm and consistency despite missing key contributors. With Anthony Davis leading the way, the team will aim to assess how its young talents perform alongside established veterans, particularly during Irving’s extended recovery period.As the preseason continues, Oklahoma City will gradually reintegrate its top players, starting with their first home game on October 9. Meanwhile, Dallas will keep a close watch on the recovery timelines of Irving, Gafford, and Williams as they prepare for the regular season.Also read: Oklahoma City Thunder vs Dallas Mavericks Preseason Game 1: Prediction, Odds, Spread, Moneyline, and Betting Guide Ultimately, this preseason matchup will offer valuable insights into each franchise’s direction.

Kansas City Chiefs star tight end Travis Kelce marked his 36th birthday on October 5 in style, with a heartfelt tribute from his mother Donna Kelce that shed light on his high-profile relationship with pop icon Taylor Swift . Donna shared a nostalgic baby photo of Travis on her Instagram Story, accompanied by a snippet of Taylor Swift’s new track “Opalite” from her latest album The Life of a Showgirl. The song, which Travis has called his favorite from the album, features lyrics that capture a hopeful new chapter in Taylor’s life, inspired by her relationship with the NFL star. Donna’s choice to pair the birthday message with “Opalite” was a clear nod to the couple’s bond.Earlier this year, during an August episode of New Heights, Travis confided to his brother Jason Kelce that “Opalite” stood out to him as his favorite song on Taylor’s 12th studio album, released just days before his birthday. “I always found myself dancing to it,” Travis admitted. The track’s lyrics reflect a new phase in Taylor’s life — moving past old relationships and embracing a fresh start with Travis. Lines like “But my mama told me, ‘It's alright,’ / You were dancing through the lightning strikes / Sleepless in the onyx night / But now, the sky is opalite” speak of the emotional depth behind the upbeat melody.Beyond “Opalite,” Taylor Swift’s latest release is packed with references to her relationship with the Chiefs’ tight end. Songs like “Wood” take a more fun, NSFW approach, while “The Fate of Ophelia” tells the story of how Travis helped Taylor escape a darker time in her life. Meanwhile, “Honey” offers a sweet glimpse into their personal pet names and affectionate moments. The album’s themes of renewal and love clearly resonate with fans, who have watched this high-profile NFL and music power couple grow closer over the past year.On Travis’s birthday, he joined Taylor at the “Official Release Party of a Showgirl,” held in theaters. Photos from the event show Kelce sporting a bright orange hat and matching fan, embracing the festive mood.

Type “NFL” on X, and the first post that appeared a few days ago was from an account named Giordano Bruno. The picture it carried was of Super Bowl 2026’s headliner, Bad Bunny , with the caption: “🏈 Dear NFL , Americans are sick of this crap 🤮.” What followed was a myriad of comments backlashing at the league for choosing him. One wrote, “Seriously, this is who you hire for a football game? @NFL. ” Another said, “I don't want to watch a man in a dress that sings in Spanish.” A third fan expressed, “So tired of this woke nonsense.” Now, what is the relation between the LGBTQ+ community and Bad Bunny? Let’s go back in time.In March 2020, John Paul King of Washington Blade reported that rapper Bad Bunny, known as a longtime LGBTQ ally, had never discussed his own sexuality until an interview with the LA Times. In that conversation, the Puerto Rican recording star said, “It does not define me. At the end of the day, I don’t know if in 10 years I will like a man. One never knows in life. But at the moment I am heterosexual and I like women.”Three years later, in October 2023, Michelle Ruiz of Vanity Fair interviewed Bad Bunny following accusations of “queerbaiting.” He had worn traditionally feminine clothes like skirts, kissed a male backup dancer, and performed in drag for his “Yo Perreo Sola” music video.Bad Bunny explained, “I get endless number of negative comments and sexist and homophobic ones, without being homosexual, for dressing like that. Maybe the queer person suffers more, but it is not like I put on a skirt and go out, and they say–Look how cool. They’re going to attack me either way. You don’t know the reasons why a person is wearing that. You weren’t in his mind when he decided to put on a skirt or a blouse. You don’t know what’s inside him, what’s in his heart.”Two years later, in September 2025, the National Football League announced Puerto Rican musician Bad Bunny as the headliner for the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show in Santa Clara. John Ferrannini, Assistant Editor for the San Francisco Bay Area LGBTQ community, reported the rapper stated in a release, “What I’m feeling goes beyond myself. This is for my people, my culture, and our history.”In September, Bernardo Sim, Out’s deputy editor, explored Bad Bunny’s popularity in the LGBTQ+ community. He highlighted how Bad Bunny has worked for years to challenge the “machista” archetype that dominated reggaeton as a musical genre for decades. Bad Bunny has been trying to help fight misogyny, racism, homophobia, and transphobia within the Latino community—an aspect that keeps getting lost among U.S. audiences.In February 2020, Stephen Daw of Billboard reported that Bad Bunny and Sech performed ""Ignorantes"" on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. The rapper made a statement with his shirt. Bunny was dressed in a long skirt and a large pink jacket, which he stripped away to reveal a white shirt that read: ""Mataron a Alexa, no un hombre con falda,"" which translates to: ""They killed Alexa, not a man in a skirt.""","Puerto Rican musician Bad Bunny is the headliner for the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show in Santa Clara.

Elliotte Friedman reveals Connor McDavid’s plan for the future of the Oilers

Can You Take the Cap Higher? | 32 Thoughts

Darren Dreger suggests 50-50 odds as the Oilers wait on McDavid’s move

The hockey world is spinning once again around Connor McDavid and the Edmonton Oilers, with contract talks heating up before a new NHL season. The buzzword of the present is clarity-words almost incessantly repeated by fans and insiders throughout the days. The captain of the Oilers, a man known for his loyalty and grit, now stands before a defining moment that will provide the very framework of his own life and the spirit of the franchise.NHL insider Elliotte Friedman sent Twitter into a frenzy when he declared that McDavid wants to bring ""clarity"" to the Oilers' situation before the puck drops this season. Friedman said, on the 32 Thoughts podcast, ""I do think that McDavid wants to give the Oilers clarity before the season begins by either signing or explaining why specifically he wouldn't sign.""McDavid is said to be very rational in his considerations, being in the last year of an eight-year deal thought to be worth $100 million. Friedman stated that centers of such caliber may find their decisions swayed by their allegiance to teammates such as Leon Draisaitl, Ryan Nugent-Hopkins, or Darnell Nurse. This trust might indeed push McDavid towards opting for a short-term extension, one that juggles his own aspirations against the team's cap realities.While discussing this player movement, TSN insider Darren Dreger added drama by stating that the circumstances surrounding McDavid's return to the Oilers were at 50-50. On the Barn Burner podcast, he said, ""If it happens, and I'm still 50-50 that it is going to happen.""Dreger stated that there is no friction between McDavid and the team, but that tension is starting to develop. Owner Daryl Katz is said to be ""getting a little antsy"" as McDavid weighs his options. Earlier during training camp, McDavid stated somewhat cautiously: ""We think about it, we talk about it... Gauge where we're at, what we're feeling. Nothing's really changed as of now, and just excited to be here."" Fans are gearing up for what is likely to be a suspenseful start to the season as this drama unfolds.As the big announcement draws nearer, fans eagerly devour every insider tidbit and wonder when the unveiling will finally happen. Whenever he signs, whether it's sooner or later for the perfect timing, the thing about this decision is it will forever shape McDavid's legacy, along with the Oilers' trajectory for another Stanley Cup run.Also Read: Inside the love story of Alex Ovechkin and Anastasia Shubskaya: How romance fueled a hockey icon","Connor McDavid is in the last year of an eight-year deal thought to be worth $100 million.

Bad Bunny jokes about critics and celebrates Latino artists’ success at SNL

Comedian John Oliver jumped into the talk about the NFL picking Bad Bunny for the Super Bowl Halftime Show. Using his usual humor, he pushed back against Republicans who didn’t like the choice. The NFL announced Bad Bunny during the Cowboys vs. Packers game on September 28. Since then, some people have been upset about whether the Puerto Rican rapper, Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, was the right pick — and Oliver wasn’t about to stay silent.On the October 5 broadcast of Last Week Tonight, Oliver first gave credit where it was due — to the NFL for making a bold pick. “The NFL controversially gave the Super Bowl Halftime show to one of the hottest, most commercially successful people alive,” he joked. He then pivoted to address commentary by figures such as Trump adviser Corey Lewandowski, who warned that ICE agents would be present during Bad Bunny’s performance. Oliver went beyond the music controversy and called out broader enforcement policies.“If ICE can show up and bother some guys at their roofing job, then bystanders should be able to bother ICE at their state‑sanctioned kidnapping job. It is only fair,” he said, adding, “And look, this administration is clearly still hell-bent on trying to intimidate communities with shows of force, which is why it is so important for them to be met with strong pushback each and every time.”Bad Bunny didn’t shy away from addressing the controversy. At the Season 51 premiere of Saturday Night Live, he poked fun at his critics and celebrated the opportunity. “I’m very happy, and I think everyone is happy about it, even Fox News,” he said, before the show cut to edited news clips reading: “Bad Bunny is my favorite musician. He should be the next president.” Acknowledging that not all viewers might understand every lyric, he quipped, “If you did not understand what I just said… You have four months to learn. ” He also used the platform to acknowledge the collective effort of Latino artists, saying, “Especially all of the Latinos and Latinas in the world here in the United States who have worked to open doors. It’s more than a win for myself, it’s a win for all of us. Our footprints and our contribution in this country, no one will ever be able to take that away or erase it.”In the end, Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl show isn’t just about entertainment — it’s also sparked a bigger debate about culture, identity, and who belongs in the spotlight.","The NFL announced Bad Bunny during the Cowboys vs. Packers game on September 28.

Bill Belichick’s Patriots directive leaves UNC football silent after Drake Maye’s breakout



Reactions blast Bill Belichick for blocking UNC from promoting Drake Maye



Bill Belichick reportedly stopped the North Carolina Tar Heels from posting about Drake Maye after the quarterback led the New England Patriots to a 23-20 win over the Buffalo Bills on Sunday Night Football. The silence from UNC’s social media team stood out, and reports now suggest Belichick was behind it.Ross Martin of CBS Sports and 247Sports reported, “According to sources inside the UNC football program, it is a directive from the staff (Bill Belichick) to not tweet/retweet anything Patriots-related.”That included Maye’s primetime performance where he completed 22 of 30 passes for 273 yards in the victory. While most schools highlight their alumni’s NFL success to boost recruiting, UNC football accounts stayed quiet.Former Tar Heels coach Mack Brown ignored the directive and congratulated Maye directly on X. “So Happy for Drake. Fun to watch him win last night in Buffalo like he did so many times at UNC. Love and Appreciate you my friend! Keep it rolling!” he wrote alongside a photo of them together.Belichick has been in conflict with the Patriots since his 2023 departure. He already blocked New England scouts from attending UNC practices, saying, “It’s clear that I’m not welcome there, around their facilities.And they aren’t welcome at ours.”The report triggered backlash from media and fans. NFL insider Jonathan Jones called it “remarkable. Embarrassing.”One fan wrote, “Bill Belichick’s entire recruiting pitch is that he will get you ready for the NFL. But now he isn’t allowing certain scouts to attend practices and won’t even let the social media team tweet about the program’s best NFL player after a huge win. What a disaster.”Others pointed out UNC has not posted about Maye since Sept. 14. “I think that this is hopium. He had one good game and yall think he's the second coming of Tom Brady. Let's cool the jets here and let the guy develop” another added.Belichick’s Tar Heels are 2-3 after a blowout loss to Clemson, while Maye has emerged as one of the NFL’s top young quarterbacks. The contrast only made Belichick’s directive look worse, leaving fans and critics asking why UNC would ignore its best current NFL example.",Bill Belichick reportedly stopped UNC from posting about Drake Maye’s Patriots win.

A Friendly Tip Turns Sour



Trolls and Tough Words



Mickelson's Calm Reply



Phillip Mickelson, perhaps golf's greatest ever test, has certainly remained impervious to anything negative that social media would cast his way. During the offseason, while resting his legs, this American golfing icon has, on the contrary, been exceptionally active on social media, communicating with fans and sometimes with critics.On October 4, a golfer called Johnny Johnson took to X to share thoughts on his game plan for defending his club championship. He outlined a fairly simple strategy, ""Interesting game plan that could work. A plan I know works is tee it high, hit nasty bombs, go find it, get up and down, collect trophy.""The day after, Johnson posted an update expressing his disappointment in himself. The message, however, went into an offensive spin.“Didn’t get it done. Seriously debating quitting the game. But thank you to all of you who showed me support this weekend. Except @PhilMickelson fuck you and fuck your shit ass advice.”One would expect Mickelson to get angrier or withdraw entirely, but rather he continued calmly.The man of a champion responded back to the tirade with humor and honesty:“This extreme language will not shock or upset me as I’m getting quite used to it.AND I take full responsibility for greatly underestimated just how terrible a golfer you really are. My bad 🙋‍♂️.”This answer reflects not only Mickelson's thick skin but also the ability of a champion to level with his fans, even when the conversation turns ugly.What happened between Johnson and Mickelson shows a growing trend in professional sports, athletes trying to navigate an often-toxic online commentary. Social media serves as a tool for players to connect with fans at the grass-roots level; it has opened for criticism that comes from blunt, personal, and sometimes hostile sourcesWhile golf fans watch their favorite players interact with social media, it becomes clear that even the legends are fair game for trolling but, how they respond may very well turn what could be a conflict into opportunities for personality and perspective.","Golfer Johnny Johnson took to X to share thoughts on his game plan for defending his club championship.

Chris Eubank is still hungry, still dangerous

“I’ve heard people suggest that, 36 years old, achieved so much, fight of the year, what more does he need to do? Maybe he should retire,”

Sky Sports

“Why go through all that again? Because the truth is I don’t need to. Because if we’re talking about financial stability, I’m set for life. So I don’t need to be doing this anymore.”

“I still feel fresh. I still feel capable,”

“I still have that hunger and that fire and that desire to get up to train every day, to better myself as a fighter, to perform in front of the fans. So retirement is just not in my mindset right now. You guys are going to be seeing me for a while.”

A fighter built for the grind

“It was tough for sure, but punishing, no,”

“It was a dogfight. I’ve had tougher fights. The George Groves fight, I’m fighting a guy who's 20lbs heavier, can punch like a mule, got cut. That for me was a harder fight.”

“Those are tough. I’ve had a few tough ones. I know what I’m capable of.”

Chris Eubank Jr. has never been one to shy away from a challenge - or from defying public opinion. As the British middleweight gears up for his rematch with Conor Benn on November 14 at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, talk of retirement has begun to circle around him. At 36, with over a decade in the professional ring and more than three dozen fights behind him, some feel the veteran has little left to prove. But Eubank isn’t listening. Instead, he’s focused on what’s ahead.Following his brutal and breathless 12-round victory over Benn in April, many wondered if that fight might have been Eubank’s last dance. The bout left him drained and required hospital observation afterward, prompting even his father, the legendary Chris Eubank Sr., to ask him to consider his future. Yet, the younger Eubank insists he isn’t done.Eubank toldHowever, money isn’t what drives him. Eubank’s motivation lies in competition and in pushing his limits.he added.Those who watched the first Eubank-Benn encounter know just how much punishment both men took. However, Eubank shrugs off the idea that it was overly punishing.he said.He went on to compare that experience to his infamous ‘doghouse spars.’ It includes grueling training sessions where boxers fight without rounds or rest until one gives up.Eubank’s 35-3 record speaks volumes about his resilience and consistency. Since turning pro in 2011, he’s fought the best, adapted through eras, and never backed down from a challenge.

Cleveland Browns don’t have enough quality wide receivers

Rookie QB Dillon Gabriel performed admirably but his wide receivers failed him repeatedly

Cleveland needs to focus more on tight ends David Njoku and Harold Fannin Jr.

Also Read:

Orange and Brown Talk Podcast of Cleveland.com shared a shocking observation after the Cleveland Browns’ 21-17 loss to the Minnesota Vikings in London. While the Vikings’ top receiving corps, Justin Jefferson and Jordan Addison, made game-changing plays, the Browns’ receivers remained invisible. Jerry Jeudy profoundly disappointed by catching only two of five targets for 15 yards and dropping a critical third-down pass. Rookie Isaiah Bond caught just two catches of seven targets for 29 yards. In the previous games, Joe Flacco did not receive enough help from the wide receivers, and in the Browns vs. Vikings matchup, they repeatedly failed Dillon Gabriel.Cleveland Browns beat reporter Mary Kay Cabot on the Orange and Brown Talk Podcast noted, “They don’t have enough quality receivers right now to put fear into a defense and loosen the box and get a guy out of there. They can’t do it. That takes away Quinshon (Judkins). That’s why in the fourth quarter, when they try to close out the game, he gets knocked back a yard and goes for no gain.”The quarterback throws the ball to the wide receiver, but when the wideout fails to catch it, drops it, fumbles, or doesn’t run enough to reach it, the game takes a turn for the worse. The receiving corps must ensure they do not let their quarterback down.That’s what the Orange and Brown Talk Podcast of Cleveland.com noticed. They said rookie quarterback Dillon Gabriel performed admirably in his debut NFL game by avoiding turnovers, making smart decisions, and showing poise in the pocket. However, his wide receivers repeatedly failed to provide him with viable targets. The same issue occurred with veteran Joe Flacco, who, despite his experience and talent, also suffered from a lack of support from his wide receivers. “And just like with Joe Flacco, he isn’t getting enough help from his receivers, and it’s a problem and they’re going to have to devise a way around this.” If two quarterbacks—one a veteran with years of talent, and one a rookie—could not save Cleveland from losing four games, then the issue likely lies with the receiving corps.After identifying the Browns’ problem, Cleveland.com came up with a solution: focus more on the tight ends David Njoku and Harold Fannin Jr., whose performance stands out amid the underwhelming wideouts. Orange and Brown Talk Podcast made it clear—Cleveland stands on the brink at 1-4. Without reliable receiving threats, their offense is effectively capped, regardless of who’s at quarterback.

“I feel like s***”: Amik Robertson’s brutally honest take on holding Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins in Week 5,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/i-feel-like-s-amik-robertsons-brutally-honest-take-on-holding-jamarr-chase-and-tee-higgins-in-week-5/articleshow/124346767.cms,"Amik Robertson keeps himself accountable after tough Week 5 (Image via: Getty Images)

Amik Robertson’s raw take on Week 5 against Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins

What’s next for Amik Robertson in Detroit’s defensive backfield



Detroit Lions cornerback Amik Robertson is known for holding himself to the highest standards, and his latest performance against the Cincinnati Bengals proves it. Despite a strong culture built by head coach Dan Campbell and GM Brad Holmes, Robertson doesn’t shy away from critiquing himself, reflecting the accountability that defines Detroit’s roster. Even in the face of elite talent like Ja’Marr Chase and Tee Higgins, he refuses to settle, proving that for him, good is never good enough.With D.J. Reed sidelined on injured reserve due to a hamstring injury, Robertson faced one of the toughest assignments in the NFL: covering Ja’Marr Chase and Tee Higgins. Early in the game, Robertson made his presence felt, limiting Chase’s opportunities and even intercepting a pass intended for the star receiver.However, as the game progressed, Robertson experienced some late struggles. According to Pro Football Focus, Chase recorded two catches for 71 yards and a touchdown against Robertson, while Higgins also found the end zone. Overall, Robertson allowed six catches for 33 yards, showing strong coverage despite facing elite-level talent.After the game, Robertson didn’t mince words about his performance. “Me personally, I feel like s***.Outside looking in, you might say, ‘He caught a pick and he started off fast, he’s all over the field,’ but it’s like, I do that s*** in my sleep. This s*** is all about finishing. Next week, I’ll finish,” Robertson said. His raw honesty highlights both his personal drive and the high standards he holds himself to every week.While some may focus on the touchdowns allowed, it’s important to remember the difficulty of Robertson’s assignment. Chase and Higgins have consistently challenged top cornerbacks, and Robertson’s overall performance showed poise and skill against some of the NFL’s best. His ability to limit big plays and make crucial stops under pressure highlights his value to Detroit’s secondary.As the Lions move forward in the season, Robertson is expected to bounce back stronger. His dedication to improvement reflects the Lions’ culture of accountability and resilience. Week 6 will provide Robertson an opportunity to demonstrate why he remains a key pillar of Detroit’s defensive backfield and why opposing offenses will continue to view him as a tough matchup.Also Read: Will Xavier Worthy play against the Jacksonville Jaguars tonight?

Ja Morant suffers left ankle sprain during Memphis Grizzlies practice

Additional injuries plaguing the Memphis Grizzlies

Memphis Grizzlies reshuffle lineup after Desmond Bane trade and Ja Morant injury setback

Ja Morant is down with a left ankle sprain suffered during practice, adding to a growing list of preseason injuries. The Grizzlies say it’s not serious, but the timing couldn’t sting more. Between roster changes and key players still recovering, this hiccup could slow their rhythm before the season even starts.On October 5, 2025, Ja Morant suffered a left ankle sprain while practicing with the Grizzlies. The Memphis Grizzlies announced the injury the following day, October 6, 2025, indicating that Morant would be out for a week or so.A spokesperson for the team communicated this information to the media after the event. They mentioned to reporters that the sprain took place during practice and would limit Morant's immediate playing time, but they didn't go into specifics about how the injury occurred.In basketball, this kind of injury happens quite a bit, usually due to awkward landings or quick direction shifts. As for Morant, the team hasn't shared any video or detailed descriptions of the play, choosing instead to concentrate on how long his recovery will take.With Morant's injury, the Grizzlies' list of health problems just keeps getting longer. Rookie center Zach Edey is unavailable after undergoing an ankle procedure, and forward Brandon Clarke is out due to a knee surgery. Both players have been confirmed to miss the beginning of the season, according to the injury report released with Morant's update on October 6, 2025.On top of that, forward Jaren Jackson Jr. is on the mend after toe surgery, and his return date is still up in the air. The team spokesperson mentioned these details in the same announcement, saying they'll keep a close watch on Jackson's status, but they didn't specify when he might return.This set of injuries influences various positions, ranging from the frontcourt to the backcourt, challenging the team's depth early in the preseason.Since Ja Morant isn't available, the Grizzlies are exploring different options for the point guard position. Ty Jerome, who just signed, along with Scotty Pippen Jr., are set to take on the bulk of the duties during the preseason. Rookie Javon Small will also have more chances to prove himself on the court.In their injury update from October 6, the team laid out these adjustments, with the spokesperson informing the press that the coaching staff would count on these players to fill in the gaps.The Grizzlies have changed their roster this offseason, including trading guard Desmond Bane, to center their strategy around Morant and Jackson as main players. This approach, highlighted in team press releases and offseason discussions, was designed to improve Morant's playmaking with supporting talent, but the injuries are now making them rely on backups and newcomers sooner than expected.This sprain is a real bummer for Morant, interrupting his offseason focus on staying durable. His earlier remarks to reporters about making health a priority now really show how this setback could impact team chemistry and their early-season play.While it’s not a season-ending injury, the week-to-week status means they’ll have to keep a close eye on things, since Morant's return is key to avoiding a rough start against tough teams.Also Read: “I’d easily be among the best” — Scottie Pippen doubts whether Luka Doncic or Nikola Jokic could compete against him","Ja Morant suffered a left ankle sprain during practice on October 5, 2025.

‘Vote katua’ or agent of change? Why Prashant Kishor's poll debut could upset old equations in Bihar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/vote-katua-or-change-agent-why-prashant-kishors-poll-debut-could-upset-old-equations-in-bihar/articleshow/124352875.cms,"Poll strategist Prashant Kishor, now leading Jan Suraj, is challenging Bihar's established political players, including RJD and NDA





PATNA: Many might still remember the slogan ""Bihar me bahaar hai, Nitish-e Kumar hai"" (Bihar is a happy place because Nitish Kumar is on the throne). Coined by poll strategist Prashant Kishor (PK), during the 2015 assembly elections, it was part of Nitish Kumar's effective campaign after he joined hands with RJD and Congress to outdo the BJP-led NDA.This time, Kishor is himself in the fray as the leader of the party he launched last year, Jan Suraj - hoping to pull off an upset of the same magnitude as AAP's shock win in Delhi in 2015.That may look unrealistic. But PK cannot be accused of not trying. He has extensively toured the state and, using the experience he accumulated while organising campaigns for others, launched a bold campaign which audaciously targets the established players.Initially and for a long time later, he targeted RJD chief Lalu Prasad and his ""family first"" ethos, which had fuelled the rise of Tejashwi, NDA's primary opponent. But he has also trained his guns at the NDA, of late.PK's message is simple: the established players, who have alternatively been at the helm over the last two and a half decades, share the responsibility for the state's backwardness and cannot be trusted to improve matters.The message is specifically aimed at young people, who are angry about the lack of employment opportunities and are being forced to migrate to states where they are unwelcome. It is amplified by a combination of pluckiness and freshness, innovative use of social media and the fact that he was first off the campaigning blocks.Observers believe that the platform offered by PK - who happens to be a Brahmin - may resonate, especially with youth from the upper castes. Unlike OBCs, who have the satisfaction of seeing their own man in office or are hoping to see their man in office, upper castes cannot expect to receive any such compensatory benefit in a state where they have been excluded from the leadership race because of their numerical disadvantage. They have seen their numbers in services shrink from what they were before the introduction of reservation, and also because of the diminished power of the elite among them to influence jobs through the patronage-dispensing network.But he faces the risk of getting squeezed out of the race in what is essentially going to be a bipolar contest in large parts. The challenge for him is to appear viable and avoid being a ""vote katua"", a spoiler. That would require him to find candidates who appear winnable (read resourceful) and, at the same time, are aligned, in terms of image and credentials, with his promise to be an agent of change.Kishor can, of course, lend strength to his candidates by contesting one of the seats: something that would convey his commitment to electoral politics. He has in the past helped his ""clients"" overcome similar challenges on turf he did not belong to. But the strategist will have to dig deeper into his bag of tricks and expand it when he himself is at the wicket on the home ground.","Prashant Kishor, now leading Jan Suraj, is challenging Bihar's established political players, including RJD and NDA.

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor welcomed the Kerala High Court's decision to set up a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the alleged gold theft at Sabarimala. He also raised concerns over the handling of the case, urging accountability from the Pinarayi Vijayan-led Kerala government.Speaking to on Monday, the Congress MP reflected on the shocking details that have emerged in the case.""I think everybody in Kerala realises that there is something really fishy about what is going on. The allegations that many kilos of gold seem to have been siphoned off. This is a very serious charge. I am glad that there is now a High Court-monitored SIT investigation. But the fact is that the entire public is going to be very concerned. We have been hearing some very shocking details about what seems to have happened. It seems to be a systematic problem that has gone on for some years under the present Government. I think accountability is a must,"" Tharoor said.On Monday, the Kerala High Court ordered the formation of a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the alleged gold theft from Sabarimala temple. The court directed that the investigation remain confidential, with no information to be leaked.The SIT will be led by former Superintendent of Police S. Sasidharan and supervised by Crime Branch chief ADGP H. Venkatesh. The team will include three inspectors, among them cyber experts, to assist with the probe.The court's order pertained to 2019, when the gold-lined copper plates were taken down by the Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB). The issue intensified when Unnikrishnan Potti claimed that two gold-plated panels donated to the temple in 2019 were missing from the strongroom, just ahead of the TDB-sponsored Global Ayyappa Sangamam event. Recently, the IDB vigilance had recovered the ""missing"" items, but it was alleged that around 5 kg of weight was lost from the plates.On October 5, the TDB vigilance recorded the statement of Unnikrishnan Potty, a former helper and the sponsor of gold-plating works at the Sabarimala Ayyappa Temple.Unnikrishnan Potty was questioned for nearly three hours at the TDB Vigilance headquarters in Thiruvananthapuram. After the session, he left the premises without responding clearly to the media's questions.When pressed, Potty remarked, ""Don't I have freedom as an individual? Everything will be proven before the High Court. Don't I have the right to move freely? The truth will prevail.""The inquiry follows allegations that several gold-plated panels, removed from Sabarimala temple in 2019 and 2025 for restoration at workshops in Hyderabad and Chennai, were mishandled, with discrepancies noted in their weight and gold content.The controversy resurfaced after the Kerala High Court ordered the immediate return of the panels and criticised the Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) for bypassing procedural norms by not informing the court-appointed Sabarimala Special Commissioner.Both the Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have announced state-wide protests starting today, demanding a High Court-monitored CBI investigation into the alleged irregularities.","Congress MP Shashi Tharoor welcomed the Kerala High Court's decision to set up a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the alleged gold theft at Sabarimala.

Travis Kelce sets new all-purpose yards record



Travis Kelce’s legacy continues both on and off the field



Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce added another remarkable milestone to his legendary career on Monday night. Facing the 3-1 Jacksonville Jaguars on ESPN, Kelce, who had just turned 36, became the franchise’s all-time leader in all-purpose yards. His first two catches of the game pushed him past Dante Hall’s long-standing record of 12,356 yards, cementing his place in Chiefs history. Despite a lighter role this season, Kelce continues to shine whenever he’s on the field.Travis Kelce’s 12,357 career all-purpose yards include rushing, receiving, and return yards, highlighting his versatility and consistency over 13 NFL seasons. The Pro Bowl tight end has already achieved a host of franchise records, including receiving touchdowns (77), receiving yards (12,151), playoff receptions (178), and playoff receiving touchdowns (20). In the first half against the Jaguars, Kelce scored his 79th career touchdown on a two-yard reception from Patrick Mahomes . The play initially drew a pass interference flag but was overturned after Mahomes argued it was within one yard of the line of scrimmage, allowing the touchdown to stand.Even with a reduced presence in the offense this season—playing just 66% of offensive snaps in Week 4—Kelce remains a cornerstone of the Chiefs. “I take it day by day, year by year. I just love coming into work with these guys right here,” Kelce said in an ESPN interview. “That culture has become, you know, my way of life. The expectation year in and year out is Super Bowl or failure.”Beyond his on-field achievements, Kelce’s life has been in the spotlight off the field as well. He and pop superstar Taylor Swift , who got engaged over the summer, continue to capture public attention.While Swift promoted her new album, Life of a Showgirl, nearly 1,000 miles away on the Jimmy Fallon show, fans have eagerly followed every update about the couple. Her album includes a song inspired by Kelce, sparking conversation for its candid lyrics about their relationship. The pair are expected to marry in 2026, though a specific date hasn’t been revealed.Travis Kelce’s record-breaking performance against Jacksonville is more than a milestone; it’s a testament to his enduring talent, leadership, and ability to define an era in Kansas City. With his sights set on a fourth Super Bowl and a Hall of Fame career in the making, Kelce shows no signs of slowing down.Also Read: ""He gets mad at me, but..."": Andy Reid drops major hint about Travis Kelce’s playing time for 2025 Chiefs games","Travis Kelce sets new all-purpose yards record for Kansas City Chiefs.

The 2025 NBA preseasonmatchup is shaping up to be an exciting contest with plenty of storylines for fans and bettors. Scheduled for Monday, October 6, 2025, at the Kaseya Center in Miami, the game will tip off at 7:30 p.m. EST. With revamped rosters and early-season chemistry on display, this game offers a valuable look at both teams’ readiness ahead of the regular season.The Milwaukee Bucks enter the 2025 preseason with a retooled lineup following a series of significant offseason moves. The team made headlines by waiving Damian Lillard, freeing up cap space to sign Myles Turner, Cole Anthony, and Gary Harris. Giannis Antetokounmpo remains the focal point of the franchise, expected to dominate both ends of the court. With Turner bolstering interior defense and floor spacing, the Bucks possess an enviable blend of depth and versatility, making them early favorites to impress during preseason play.On the other hand, the Miami Heat have reinforced their roster by acquiring Norman Powell and Simone Fontecchio, while also re-signing defensive specialist Davion Mitchell. However, Tyler Herro’s absence due to offseason surgery leaves a noticeable gap in Miami’s scoring arsenal.
