""Me just getting up and moving in the middle of the season, it’s going to be a big blow to any team I’m going to,"" he stated, highlighting the logistical and emotional toll of such a move.Beyond the personal disruption, Durant also expressed a commitment to the Suns' journey.

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are still going strong in their relationship



Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are still going strong in their relationship, holding hands through tough times. Following the Kansas City Chiefs' devastating Super Bowl LIX defeat to the Philadelphia Eagles, Kelce has taken solace in Swift's songs. Addressing persistent rumors of his future in the NFL and his relationship, he posted on his New Heights podcast that her songs speak so deeply to him, evoking a broad spectrum of emotions-even the agony of losing such a high-stakes game.Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce continue to stand by each other through every challenge. Following the Kansas City Chiefs' tough Super Bowl LIX loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, Kelce has been leaning on Swift for support. Amid speculation about his potential retirement and the future of their relationship, he opened up about how her music has helped him cope.On his New Heights podcast, Kelce shared that he has been listening to many of Swift’s songs since the game, telling his brother Jason, “She has something for everything,” including “how the Eagles broke my heart.”Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are currently in a challenging phase in their careers, with the Super Bowl potentially causing further challenges in their relationship. “Taylor isn’t a quitter, but experiencing so much vitriol from the American public has left her feeling really shaken,” a source told Heatworld.com. “Friends and family are worried, and they’re hoping the couple can manage this darker period of their love story.”Taylor's booing at the Super Bowl caused her to feel visibly shocked and ultimately lower her morale. “Taylor has been left devastated by the boos. It was a really shocking moment – especially after she was riding so high following the Eras Tour. She sees herself as a good person who strives to make the best decisions, so to receive a public bashing was quite traumatising.”“Up until now, Taylor and Travis seemed to really complement each other’s public image, but there’s always a fear of over exposure – which is what her team think has happened,” the source continued. “It’s been a blow to them both, and it’s put pressure on them to split things up, work-wise. Travis has been criticised for not giving the team his full attention amid his high-publicity romance with Taylor. It suddenly feels like the tide is turning, and both will be advised to protect their own individual brands – at whatever cost.”A source to Page Six reports that the couple, despite initial concerns, appears to be doing well after returning from a secret vacation. “Taylor and Travis had a really nice time reconnecting after a very busy year,” the source revealed. They’re also enjoying time out of the spotlight. The source said, “Taylor and Travis have stepped out for a date night since returning to the US but went unnoticed when they did so. They weren’t photographed or anything, and enjoyed a low-key night out on the town together.”Also Read: “Enjoyed a quiet night”: Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift return to the spotlight following international getaway after Chiefs' Super Bowl loss","Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are still going strong in their relationship.

Travis Kelce has three hard-and-fast rules in his relationship with Taylor Swift

Travis Kelce, the 35-year-old Kansas City Chiefs player, allegedly has three hard-and-fast rules in his relationship with Taylor Swift, also 35. The two, who started dating over the summer of 2023, are frequently spotted together and have both attained tremendous success in their careers—Swift as one of the world's largest music icons and Kelce as a vital member of the Chiefs. Even with their great push, the Chiefs failed to reach the Super Bowl following a 40-22 defeat to the Philadelphia Eagles on February 9.Kansas City Chiefs superstar Travis Kelce has three hard and fast rules when it comes to his relationship with singer Taylor Swift. Dating since summer 2023, the two are regularly spotted together and are a hot topic for fans and the media. Swift is among the world's leading musicians, and Kelce is an integral part of the Chiefs, who came up short of the Super Bowl after a 40-22 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles on February 9.According to the Life and Style Magazine, through MSN, Swift apparently has some 'rules' about how Kelce can stay in contact with her and whom the football player can socialize with during his free time.“They’ll be doing lots of texting and calling, too, but Taylor likes to see Travis in real time,” a source said. “She likes to know where he is and who he’s with. It’s not that she doesn’t trust him; she just wants to feel connected. Taylor loves Travis’ energy and spontaneity, but she doesn’t want him wasted at the bar with pals. He can celebrate his wins in style with her and their friends.”Being a high-level athlete, Travis Kelce probably does not have much of his free time spent in bars, considering the strenuous nature of his profession. Otherwise, when he is not training or on the field, he co-hosts the extremely popular New Heights podcast with his brother Jason Kelce, a retired NFL great. The podcast has attracted an enormous following and gives fans an inside look at football and the brothers' personal lives.The third rule in the relationship of Kelce and Taylor Swift is one that is most argued about. The couple has reportedly agreed to not be seen with others of the opposite gender to avoid gossip and speculation. This ruling, though questionable, is probably a move to preserve their privacy and keep away from extra reinforcement from their respective professions.“Taylor’s been in this biz long enough to know what comes with being in the spotlight,” they added.The Chiefs star recently disclosed his relationship during an appearance on the Stephen A. Smith Show. “I’m enjoying all aspects of life,"" said Kelce. ""Me and Taylor are happy and I couldn’t be happier to enjoy that confidence off the field and all the support I could ever ask for at the stadium.""He added, “I think personally, the beauty of being in a very strong relationship is that you get that support to be able to come in and focus on your craft, focus on being the best version of you. I think I’m as focused as I’ve ever been on my job and being the best player that I could possibly be week in, week out for this team.""Also Read: “Enjoyed a quiet night”: Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift return to the spotlight following international getaway after Chiefs' Super Bowl loss","Travis Kelce, 35, and Taylor Swift, also 35, started dating over the summer of 2023.

Mel Kiper Jr. Wants the New York Giants to select Travis Hunter

The NFL Combine is now underway, with teams assessing potential prospects to shape their franchises.

Hunter's impressive career at Jackson State and Colorado has led the Big 12 in receptions, touchdowns, interceptions, tackles, and passes broken up.Travis Hunter, a Colorado cornerback and wide receiver, is gaining attention for his versatility in the NFL. ESPN's Mel Kiper Jr. projects him as the third overall pick, potentially joining the New York Giants, sparked by his exceptional skills.""Hunter is my top-ranked prospect in the class, and though I currently see him as a receiver in the pros, he could also play cornerback for New York,"" Kiper wrote. ""He can make a massive impact on either side of the ball, and he'll likely see at least some time on both sides.”""Perhaps the Giants take his ball skills and quickness and drop him at receiver opposite Malik Nabers to form a solid supporting cast around whomever is under center. Perhaps they look at his elite instincts and finally land a true CB1. Either way, this pick would be clutch for a struggling Giants team.”Hunter's dual capabilities could be beneficial for the Giants, as NFL analyst Sam Monson suggests he could serve as the team's top cornerback and wide receiver, complementing current standout Malik Nabers.The concept of an NFL two-way player is rare, but Hunter's talents have generated discussion among league executives and coaches. Tennessee Titans coach Brian Callahan views it as ""very realistic,"" with the possibility of Hunter starting as a cornerback before gradually assuming offensive responsibilities.Nevertheless, there are questions regarding the physical cost and the challenge of learning both positions. In spite of these issues, Hunter's unusual combination of ability and adaptability makes him a commodity, with the potential to redefine conventional positional roles in the league.With the draft approaching, the Giants' strategy is again the subject of debate. Instability at quarterback and potential desire for veterans Matthew Stafford or Sam Darnold create space for a utility-type addition like Hunter, who could serve in various capacities.Also Read: “An exceptional talent”: Travis Hunter already winning over NFL coaches and executives as a viable two-way player In short, Travis Hunter’s rare two-way skill set makes him one of the most intriguing prospects in the upcoming NFL Draft .

Host Pat McAfee read Kelce's reply, indicating the Chiefs' tight end is ""coming back for sure,"" meaning fans can look forward to more of Swift's signature game-day visits.""Gonna try and get to the best shape I've been this offseason and get back to the mountaintop,"" McAfee read from Kelce's message. ""Got a real bad taste in my mouth with how I played in that last game and how I got the guys ready for battle. I can’t go out like that!!!!”Kelce addressed rumors about the Kansas City Chiefs ' loss at Super Bowl LIX on his ""New Heights"" podcast, but did not provide a final verdict. ""I know everybody wants to know whether or not I'm playing next year, and right now, I'm just kicking everything down the road. I'm not making any crazy decisions. I'm gonna take some time to figure it out,"" he said at the time.He further added, ""And, I think I owe it to my teammates that if I do come back, it's a wholehearted decision. I'm not half-assing it, and I'm fully here for them.”Kelce inked a two-year deal last season, with speculation suggesting he would receive an $11.5 million bonus should he agree to play in the 2025 season by March 14. Kansas City Chiefs General Manager Brett Veach has since clarified there was no such deadline for Kelce's announcement. In spite of continued rumblings regarding Kelce's NFL future, the Chiefs seem to be allowing their franchise tight end the leeway to make a decision on his own terms.“How we left it at the end of the season is that he was fired up,” he said during an episode of The Rich Eisen Show. “He has one more year under contract. I still think he has that fire and desire to play.” He added, ""As far as I’m concerned, there is no deadline,” he said. “I think we left it as he’d be back, and we’re excited to get him back and get him going.”Jason Kelce, Travis’s older brother and co-host of their podcast, shared his thoughts on Travis’s upcoming decision during a previous appearance on The Steam Room. Having retired from the NFL himself last year, Jason weighed in on the uncertainty surrounding his brother’s future in the league. “I think Travis, I think he probably, in his heart, already knows what he wants to do,"" Jason had said.

How Virat Kohli tweaked technique after Australia tour,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-champions-trophy-2025/how-virat-kohli-tweaked-technique-after-australia-tour/articleshow/118615926.cms,"BACK TO BANGAR

INCREASED BACK FOOT PLAY

He (Kohli) waited for the ball to come to him. He really wasn't on the front foot all the time. He was willing to cover the infield as well. Against spin, what was good to see in the first half of his innings was that he was playing a lot off the back foot. Then once he got that confidence, he started coming forward. So, starting off the back foot and then gradually going on to the front foot was the plan. Sanjay Bangar

ALTERED BAT POSITIONING

When Kohli was in form, his bat used to come from the second or third slip area, allowing him to play more controlled shots. He is a guy who leaves no stone unturned as far as preparation is concerned. He knew that he had to step up (after the Australia tour). He brought that intensity to his game, and one could see it in his body language. Sanjay Bangar

ADJUSTMENT IN STANCE

What he did well was to watch the ball till the end, till it made contact with his bat. That's something we discussed - to watch the ball like a hawk and give more than 100% to each delivery. He is hungry for runs and going by the innings he played (against Pakistan), he can easily play for another 3-4 years in international cricket. Sanjay Bangar

A look at what the master batter has changed since his return from Australia...After Virat Kohli 's travails in Australia, he went back to a trusted aide - former India batting coach Sanjay Bangar . Bangar's time with the Indian team from 2014 to 2019 coincided with Kohli 's peak, a period in which he scored 19 of his 30 Test hundreds.In Australia, Kohli managed to score only 190 runs at 23.75 from the 5 Tests, getting out in the same fashion poking outside off-stump.Visuals showed Bangar giving throwdowns to Kohli from about 16-17 yards, pitching the ball on a cement slab. As Kohli was scoring his 51st ODI ton to power India to victory over Pakistan in the Champions Trophy , Bangar, during his commentary stint, threw more light on what transpired at the training facility in Mumbai...During his 111-ball 100 against Pakistan, it was evident Kohli was playing more on the back foot to back-of-a-length deliveries. Kohli's footwork saw significant improvement against both pacers and spinners, especially his back foot play. Playing off the back foot allowed Kohli to read spinners better and adjust shots accordingly. Once he gained confidence, he started coming forward more often, effectively mixing his approach.In Australia, Kohli's bat was coming down from closer to the wicketkeeper or first slip. Bangar and Kohli worked on ensuring that his bat came down from the second or third slip region.Kohli also slightly opened his stance, allowing for better judgment against pace and spin. This adjustment facilitated more fluid shot execution, particularly through the offside. Additionally, a marginally lower back lift helped in reducing excessive back-and-across movement, leading to more stability and control over his shots.","Virat Kohli scored his 51st ODI ton to power India to victory over Pakistan in the Champions Trophy.

Stefon Diggs Sues Reality TV Star Mulan Hernandez for Extortion and Assault



NFL wide receiver Stefon Diggs has filed a lawsuit against reality TV star Mulan Hernandez, whose real name is Mia Jones, along with Brianna ""Brii"" Mack. The lawsuit accuses the two women of extortion, assault, and destruction of property. According to the legal documents, Diggs claims that he was punched in the chest by Jones and ""threatened with a deadly weapon,"" leading to severe emotional distress. The four-time Pro Bowler is now seeking damages for the alleged misconduct and damage to his property.According to court documents obtained by the Houston Chronicle, Diggs alleges that he was a victim of “a tale of abuse to extort millions of dollars.” The wide receiver claims that Jones and Mack attempted to blackmail him by threatening to expose information that could damage his career unless he paid them a substantial amount. Diggs’ attorney, Kent Schaffer, stated, “There were threats coming from [Jones] that he had to pay her money or she was going to go public and ruin his career. We’re kind of at the point where the threats have to stop. That’s why the decision was made to go ahead and file. At some point it just has to end.”The trouble reportedly began after Diggs and Jones were involved in what Schaffer described as a “casual relationship.” Diggs claims that during this period, Jones damaged his personal property, including a wristwatch and a PC gaming system. The lawsuit also states that Jones ""refused to leave"" Diggs' apartment on multiple occasions, causing him emotional distress. Additionally, the lawsuit claims that both Jones and Mack engaged in trespassing and extortion attempts, which led to severe emotional anguish for Diggs.The legal complaint further mentions an incident on June 7, where Diggs alleges that he was punched in the chest by Jones, who also attempted to hit him in the head. It is claimed that Jones destroyed Diggs’ wristwatch and gaming system during this confrontation. The documents state that in the months following the incident, Jones and Mack continued to demand money from Diggs, leading to the current lawsuit.Jones has claimed that she sought medical attention in June, a week after the alleged altercation, reporting that she was “punched in the back of the head with a closed fist.” Schaffer responded by saying, “My understanding is that [Jones] and [Mack] on [June 14] went to the hospital together making complaints. She was treated and released the same day. She didn’t see [Diggs] that day.”Amidst the ongoing legal battle, Diggs’ professional future is also under speculation. Houston Texans General Manager Nick Caserio recently discussed Diggs’ status with the team, stating, “Glad he was on our team last year. He helped us win some games. Unfortunately, he got injured. So we’ll kind of work through the process with him. We have an open door policy. We don’t rule anything out, so we’ll have an open mind. We’ll figure out what makes the most sense and if there is a fit.”Also Read: Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt reveals emotional turmoil after team's Super Bowl 2025 loss in candid reflection Stefon Diggs, a four-time Pro Bowler, played eight games for the Texans in 2024 before suffering a season-ending ACL tear.

Stan Bowman defended defenseman Evan Bouchard from criticism



Evan Bouchard , the Edmonton Oilers ' top defenceman, has been under scrutiny for several glaring defensive mistakes , including a failed play on Brandon Hagel's wraparound goal. Despite criticism of his lack of urgency and adaisical play, Oilers general manager Stan Bowman has defended Bouchard's criticism, speaking out on Wednesday's episode of Frankly Speaking with Frank Seravalli.Edmonton Oilers general manager Stan Bowman defended defenseman Evan Bouchard from criticism from fans and analysts, arguing that much of it is unfair. Bowman acknowledged the criticism but defended his player, suggesting that Bouchard's mistakes might be magnified due to the spotlight he receives. Many have pointed fingers at Bouchard for his turnovers and defensive mistakes this season.'“Bouch does get a lot of criticism — I think a lot unfairly so,” said Bowman. “He’s a great player, he really is a big part of our team. He’s very effective, and I think sometimes when… your mistakes get spotlighted, for whatever reason, then maybe there’s more attention given to it.“But he’s played well. He’s very good at complimenting our best players. That’s an important role when you got really creative offensive players who are forwards, you need to have someone who can help them score.”Bouchard has been instrumental in helping the Oilers' top players generate offense, with 60% of his ice time spent with Connor McDavid . This has increased the team's shot attempt share, expected goal share, and scoring chance share by about four percent. McDavid's goal share is 36.11 percent away from Bouchard, but when they're together, it rises to 58.33 percent. However, Bowman noted a slow start to the season for both Bouchard and the team.“He started slow, like a lot of our guys didn’t start great in October, and whether that was residual from playing a long time last year or getting going when you know how long the season is and you know the grind it is, I don’t know,” said Bowman. “But I think once really from November on, Bouch has done a good job for us. He’s an important player and I think sometimes he takes too much criticism.”Also Read: “Detroit is cooking”: The Detroit Red Wings fans are fueling their excitement over the recent NHL trade, saving $3.5 billion Bouchard, despite some mistakes this season, remains one of the top blue-liners in the game.

NFL legend turned NCAA coach Deion Sanders , best known as Coach Prime or Prime Time, played in the National Football League (NFL) for 14 years. He also played nine seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB). But looks like the NFL and MLB are not the only arenas he is interested in, as recently, he expressed his prowess in fishing as well. He got into a heated discussion with NBA legend Chris Webber , famous for being part of the Fab Five, about who is better at fishing. Let's find out!Coach Prime has won two Super Bowl titles and made one World Series appearance, making him the only athlete to play in a Super Bowl as well as the World Series. After his playing career, Sanders became a coach, turning his attention towards college football. But all that does not mean he is ever leaving his fishing days behind.In his podcast, ""We Got Time Today,"" a recent episode saw Fab Five member Chris Webber making an appearance. And apparently, things got a little heated between the two, all because they could not decide on who was better at fishing among them. Webber took to his socials to share a video of Coach Prime talking smack about Webber and his fishing, all in good fun, writing at the end:Fishing might help him clear his mind, but looks like if someone poses a challenge to his fishing caliber, all bets are off.In the video posted by Webber in collaboration with Prime Time, which seems to have been recorded by Webber's wife, the latter is in full roast mode. He can be heard saying:Coach Prime enjoys his fishing as much as the next person. But do not come to him and say you're better at it than him; he has a problem with it. Unless you can prove it to him somehow!

Are Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce planning for a baby?

As Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce were getting ready for the Super Bowl last month, their pre-game convo allegedly was about something other than football. The night prior to the big game, the couple was dining at Lilette, an upscale French restaurant in New Orleans.They were not alone, along with them were Travis Kelce's Kansas City Chiefs team player Patrick Mahomes and his wife, Brittany Mahomes. Although the Super Bowl was certainly on their minds, sources indicate that the night's chatter turned to more intimate issues, creating a memorable evening prior to the championship battle.Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce had dinner prior to the Super Bowl at French restaurant Lilette in New Orleans with Patrick Mahomes and Brittany Mahomes. As the crowd enjoyed their supper, sources hinted that the discourse turned to one personal issue -children, particularly because the couple Mahomes welcomed their second little one.“There was lots of baby talk,” the insider revealed, mentioning that Brittany was sharing pictures while the group enthusiastically discussed parenthood. This insight comes as speculation grows about Swift’s future, especially now that her record-breaking Eras Tour has officially concluded.Taylor Swift, known for her work ethic and creative projects, may be taking a ""gap year"" to focus on her personal life, particularly her relationship with Kelce, according to close sources. “For the first time in years, Taylor has no definitive plan,” an insider shared. “She is taking a year off. That means no tours or shows. She and Travis are in it for the long haul, and they both want the same things: a forever romance and a family.”Swift is open to marriage and children, according to close friends. “Taylor's friends believe now is the perfect time in her life to marry and have children,” a source said. “They’ve expressed this to her, and she is not against it at all.

Proof lies in a letter that he wrote to his girlfriend before becoming the star that he is today. The letter recently leaked after it was put up for auction at LeLands DotCom. The content of the letter shows how he deeply loved Robinson while also prioritizing basketball as a career.The letter was written when Michael Jordan was playing at the University of North Carolina under the mentorship of coach Dean Smith. He was 18 years old at the time and had big dreams that he wanted to achieve. In the handwritten note, he shared with his high school sweetheart, ""Laquetta, you are my whole life next to basketball.” He continued, ""Please don't get mad about that statement. You are my whole life. But you can't have basketball.""The next part of the letter really shows the faith that he had in himself to succeed. He wrote, ""Next year I will show you things you can't believe. Some of these things will amaze you.” Conveying his love for Laquetta, he also wrote, “Laquetta, I will go out of my way just to speak to you. This shows you how much I really care.” The letter also showed that he deeply cared about her family and was looking forward to their approval.The promise that he made to Laquetta was delivered upon the exact next year. In 1982, he hit a legendary game-winning shot in the NCAA Championship that marked the beginning of his groundbreaking career.While his relationship held a lot of significance in his teenage years, the bond did not last long. He was married to Juanita Vanoy briefly before announcing their divorce in 2006. In 2008, he met Yvette Prieto, a Cuban-American model. What followed was an engagement in 2011 and a grand wedding in Palm Beach, Florida in 2013. They also welcomed their twin daughters in 2014. While the duo prefer to keep their relationship private, they have made multiple red carpet appearances together. They also attended many basketball matches, boxing matches and NASCAR races together.Also Read: LeBron James Vs.

An opportunity to give back to a historic franchise

Financial incentives have played their part

The Boston Red Sox were the toast of the baseball world this off-season following their acquisition of free agent lefty Matt Moore to a one-year, $9 million contract. While the economics of the signing are certainly favorable, Matt Moore discussed the real reasoning behind joining up with Boston only recently. When speaking with transparency, the old All-Star let it be known why he became a member of the Red Sox family now rather than sooner.For Matt Moore, being able to pitch in Fenway Park and give back to one of the greatest franchises in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) history was a strong motivation. Telling NESN, Matte Moore explained the Red Sox legacy and ability to play for vociferous fans was enticing for him right away.But it was not all about the past. Moore also cited how much he appreciated the direction of the Red Sox now and their willingness to construct a solid pitching rotation. The Red Sox have been busily rebuilding their rotation, mixing young guns with veteran arms like Matt Moore.Matt Moore acknowledged that other clubs expressed interest, but the Red Sox presented a definitive blueprint for how they would employ him, as a starter if needed and as a trusted reliever. That versatility, combined with Boston's openness to discuss their intentions, sealed the agreement.Of course, the $9 million contract was no small factor in Matt Moore’s decision. At this stage in his career, securing a financially strong one-year deal gave him both stability and the freedom to re-evaluate his future next offseason.Matt Moore, who has struggled with injuries and inconsistent play throughout his career, admitted the offer was among the better deals he was ever offered. That it was made by a club with a real plan for how he would fit in made the money even sweeter.Ultimately, Matt Moore's decision to sign with the Red Sox was about more than dollars and cents, it was about fit, opportunity, and the thrill of being part of a franchise with a rich history. As the 2025 season nears, both Matt Moore and the Red Sox will be hoping this $9 million gamble pays dividends in the form of a steady veteran presence on the mound.Also Read: 'Hate that signing': MLB fans divided as Matt Moore signs with Boston Red Sox following Zach Penrod's elbow injury","Matt Moore signed a one-year, $9 million contract with the Boston Red Sox.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Patrick Mahomes’ Younger Brother Jackson Mahomes Gets Dragged Into A Controversy With Dylan Raiola



Patrick Mahomes Has Spoken About Being Dylan Raiola’s Inspiration Before



Patrick Mahomes, the quarterback of the Kansas City Chiefs, has had a tough time in the last few weeks as his team lost the Super Bowl 2025 trophy to the Philadelphia Eagles and the player went through a personal tragedy. Just days after the Super Bowl 2025, Patrick Mahomes’ maternal grandfather passed away.
