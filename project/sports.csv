This is your first coaching stint in the IPL. How difficult is it to be a coach these days, especially in such high-profile franchises?

Coaching staff in teams have ballooned since your playing days…

In franchise cricket, the money rolls in fast. Superstars are made very easily. Do you think ego then becomes a big issue for players?

There is a perception players’ heads get turned by so much money floating around, with so many brands chasing you…

If we look at the greatest cricket teams of the past, there’s always an inherently strong sense of team bonding. How do you create that in a franchise environment, with so many different players from all over?

How does Australia invariably rise to the occasion in World Cups?

How do you handle the fear of failure?

How important is it to take care of the mental health of players who are always such pressure?

What impact will this season’s IPL have on the upcoming World Cup? Teams are scoring heavily this season…

Who are your favourites for the T20 WC?

The Indian coach’s position is up for grabs. Will you apply?

What is it like to face a fast bowler, say like Shoaib Akhtar?

Do you miss the Pakistan team of the past – tough and competitive?

Recently in the eye of what he termed “a storm in an espresso cup,” Justin Langer, head coach of the LSG, seemed in awe of cricket’s evolution from a one-coach-one-physio endeavour in his early playing days to the heaving 90-man entourages of the IPL today.Sitting back in his chair at a plush city hotel and gesticulating with his eyes and hands while speaking, Langer’s train of thought veered from past to present and onward to the future.The one-time foot soldier of the formidable Australian team of the 1990s is one of the sharpest cricketing brains around, and he was excitedly pouring his thoughts out on the game. The TOI Sports team just happened to be present.When you’re a player, you have control. You take absolute responsibility for your performance. The only thing that's out of your control is selection, or what the media writes or what people think of you. You focus only on watching the ball. If you make runs, the only currency of value is runs. If you make runs, you get selected. If you get selected, you get a contract.I went straight from playing to coaching – as an assistant coach, which is the best coach job in the world. You work about two hours a day, everyone's your best friend, and you’ve got no accountability. Then you become head coach, oh man, then you work about 16 hours a day. No one likes you. And you’ve got 100% accountability!I took a break from coaching for two and a half years for the first time in my life (after the Australia stint). I had do my writing, my speaking, I did my board roles. I had complete control. It's like being a batsman, again, there's freedom in that.And then I came back into coaching. And you realise again that you've got your hands tied. In football, the coach has control over the match. Whereas in cricket, the captain does everything on the field, right? So, you manage your people, you make them feel happy, you make them ready to play, you help them with peak performance, you help the superstar and the kid who's just coming in.You’ve to mentor them and coach them differently. But you must understand they are all different people – some introverts, some extroverts. You have got to learn how to manage. So as head coach, you are purely a man manager. You have to manage them well so that they perform on the field. And that's tough.When I started playing with the Australian cricket team, Bob Simpson was the coach. When I started playing professional cricket, we used to train on a Wednesday afternoon, we all had full-time jobs. We had one coach who was part time, and I think we had a physio, and you only got paid if you made the first 11.Now there are coaches everywhere. Things have changed. It’s a 12-month business. We have three different formats of the game which guys play all year round. Now they play in different franchises, they play international cricket. Yes, times have changed. But there's still a role for an assignment, right? We call it professionalism. We try to look after people well.Let’s face it. There wasn't an IPL when Ian Chappell was around. There were no franchises. There were no broadcast rights. If we expect the players to be high-performing individuals, then they expect high-performing services and that comes in the form of coaches and physiotherapists and doctors and people who throw balls all day.I worked full time in a bank, or in a stock broking firm until I was 28 years old. Then Middlesex rang me and asked if I wanted to go and play. I played three years at Middlesex and then I became a full-time cricketer.In the Australian team I played in, we had Matthew Hayden, Shane Warne, Glen McGrath, Ricky Ponting. They were superstar players because of their performance, not because of how much money they made. One of the challenges we have today is that we still judge players on the performance, not on how much money they get paid.There's so much money in the game. But you still have to be a high performer. MS Dhoni is MS Dhoni not because he's made a lot of money.My point is that Dhoni, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and KL Rahul are incredibly wealthy, but they are superstars because of the way they perform. Dhoni won a World Cup and was one of the greatest finishers of the game. People will never forget those performances.In India, with 1.4 billion cricket-loving people, you could pick five teams which can beat most countries. There's so much talent. I’m blown away. So my point is, I also see how much pressure these young players are under because I they all want to be a Dhoni, they all want to be a Virat Kohli or Rahul or Rohit. But they’ve got a long journey to get to that point. The only way they can survive here is by performing and performing and performing.When I went to the IPL mini-auction, I saw several players going unsold. There are lot more heartbreaks than success. For the ones who make it, there is a lot of money in the game. That’s just the joys of the money from broadcast rights. But the ones who make it must be very good cricketers. They're the cream rising to the top.Yeah, they might be getting the brands, and they might be doing the rounds of social media. But if they don't perform, they get destroyed. They either get dropped or get destroyed by social media. So, the pressure, in some way, balances it all out.When I played my third Test, the great Allan Border gave me some amazing advice. I still give it to the players today. He was wearing expensive, branded shoes and I asked him if he could help me get a shoe sponsorship. He told me, you make all the runs in the world, you become the best batsman and you will get all the shoes, or the sunglasses or the fame or the money you could ever imagine. Focus on that. Nothing's changed.Shane Warne turned up for the first session with Bob Simpson – peroxide hair, earring, a mobile phone in one hand and a packet of cigarettes in the other. These guys were like, who’s this young upstart? But he was real. And he performed so well he was great. All these kids now say Shane loved fast cars, loved women, loved smoking cigarettes. But he was brilliant. He made a lot of mistakes off the field, but he was a great performer. We miss him.It’s a challenge when you're here only for 10 weeks. This is why I really admire Chennai. They have a solid foundation, the same Stephen Fleming’s (head coach) been there since Day One, I think. I respect that. They've won five times. Let's face it, Lucknow Super Giants is a very young franchise. It's still a work in progress.I imagine what we're all striving for is when players come to their franchise, it's like coming home.Tom Moody told me IPL is like the Olympics, you've never seen anything like it.From my experience of four years with the Australian team, I can say building an international team it is exhausting. It is tough. If you don't perform, the whole country lets you know about it. And that is exhausting, right?The hardest thing about being head coach in Australia is selection. If you a player from one state, the other state complains. International cricket is not like franchise cricket.We only play six months of the year, but you have the full pre-season. You build up the family, you build up the culture and you build up all these inputs over 12 months. It is very tiring.When you play cricket for Australia, the expectation is you're going to win because we win. That might sound very simplistic, but this is the Aussie mindset.In IPL, there is so much pressure to win. Then there's pressure just to be in the team. When we started winning, then suddenly there was this load of expectations. You could feel the pressure building.In contrast, we Australians just go with the flow, stay relaxed. It's about having fun. And they know they've got so much talent on the park. They just go about their business. They are used to winning. They are used to doing it their way. It is like, we don't take it too seriously, even though we take it very seriously. It's almost like a paradox. That's the secret.When you walk into the Australian dressing room, it’s like being in a nightclub 24/7, I'm not joking. It was so much fun. We had so much respect for each other, and it was so much fun. And that's the difference.If the pressure builds, you’ll never perform at your best. And I know that as a player. The harder you try, the worse it gets. And in big games, if things tighten up, you're dead. But if you just stay relaxed…. my heroes were the West Indies, the early West Indies team I watched while growing up. Like Viv Richards, they just seemed so chilled out all the time. They knew they were talented.I'm sure individuals think about the fear of failure. I lived with it until I was 28 years old. And it is paralysing, the fear of failure. It can drive you, but living in a world of fear of failure is a dangerous world.We are human beings. I remember seeing Steve Waugh suffer that. He was a run machine but had got a duck. He was going through a small run of failures. I remember he got out just before stumps in Johannesburg and got in the bus after that — he had his collar up, had his cap down and wore sunglasses. I went and sat with him. I said, ‘How’re you feeling, captain?’ He goes, ‘Pretty rubbish.’ So, even the greats have doubts and insecurities. That's being human, right?There is more acceptance now. I respected Glenn Maxwell for coming out a couple of years ago and say he had mental-health issues. I see guys like Will Pucovski . He is a supreme talent, but he's got issues. He suffered from concussion. Yeah, so the concussion is one thing, but that is also linked with some mental-health issues.We are human, we all are on a spectrum of mental health. And it’s just about dealing with that. It is about man management, knowing that everyone has to look after their mental health every single day of their lives. That's one thing about being a coach, you got to keep observing all the time. And you can see it in their body language, you can see it in the way they perform, you can see about in their actions, you can see it in all these things.As the head coach, you got to be like a father, like a school teacher, be a psychologist, be a mentor. All these things rolled up in one. In IPL, the team entourage comprises 90 people. You have to deal with 50 people who are all trying to do the same thing. And they're all on their own journeys in life to get to winning. That is a huge challenge.I'm fascinated by the impact-player rule. That's had an effect. I'm on the MCC world cricket committee and one important thing we talk about is the cricket pitches. You want Test cricket to survive, get the pitches right.Like it’s a contest between bat and ball in Australia. The ball swings around and bounces. Awesome. You come to India and the ball spins, contest between bat and ball. You can't leave the screen because the batsman could get out any ball. It is addictive.At the upcoming World Cup, it will all depend on what the pitches are like. I can't imagine that the wickets in the West Indies are going to be that flat, maybe Barbados. I've got no idea what's going to happen in America because they're drop-in pitches.My belief has always been that we should never forget about the defensive side of T20 cricket . You look at the teams doing really well in this in this IPL, like KKR and Rajasthan Royals. They have good bowlers and so are performing well. Never forget the defensive side of the game. LSG has suffered because a lot of our bowlers dropped out before the league began.So, when it comes to the World Cup, often the teams with the best bowling attacks will have the best chance to win.If you if you look at the trend of World Cups, it's often the same group of teams on paper. There's a lot of very good teams. India will obviously be strong. Australia on paper look scarily strong. New Zealand always are the underdogs. They love playing for their country, so they are strong. It is tough to predict at the start of the season who's going to win. There might be some injuries. It is impossible to predict.(After a laugh and a long pause) Well, I am curious. I've never ever thought about it. I have deep respect for any international coach because I understand the pressure, but coaching the Indian team would be an extraordinary role. From what I've seen with the amount of talent I've seen in this country, it would be fascinating.If you are facing fast bowlers, you’ve got to have physical courage. The second thing is, if you see the ball come out of the bowler’s hand, it's like slow motion. All I tried to do was getting my stance right and have proper balance. If you can see the ball released out of the bowler’s fingers, then everything will be okay. It’s then very hard to get out.You see the ball release because you have hit so many cricket balls. It doesn't matter how quick it is. But if your stance is just a little bit out and you start falling across or you're moving at release of the ball, it is like living in a fast-forward movie cartoon. And that's when you get hit on the body and then it's not fun.Yeah, just as we miss a competitive West Indies team. I grew up watching the great West Indies team. You want to see them strong, and you want to see all the other countries strong. We talk about this in the MCC world cricket committee meeting regularly. How do we keep sustaining the health of the other countries? It’s important to have West Indies strong, as important to keep Pakistan strong and as important to keep New Zealand and Sri Lanka strong because that is important for the health of world cricket.",LSG head coach Justin Langer talks about the changing dynamics of the game.

IPL playoff scenarios: Which team will join Kolkata Knight Riders in top two?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/ipl-playoff-scenarios-which-team-will-join-kolkata-knight-riders-in-top-two/articleshow/110098805.cms,"*

Gujarat Titans became the third team to be knocked out of the Indian Premier League playoff race after their game against Kolkata Knight Riders was washed out on Monday.We look at the chances of the teams in contention: KKR now have a 75% chance of finishing sole toppers and a 25% chance of ending up in sole second spot, assuming no more matches get rained off.If they win their last game, they will top. They could top even if they lose their last game, provided RR don't win both their remaining games.RR are not sure of topping even if they win their remaining games, but their chances of being sole toppers are a respectable 25%. They also have a nearly 40% chance of finishing sole second. But they are still not guaranteed qualification. If they lose both games, they could end up tied second with three other teams - SRH CSK and LSG depending on results in other games.Third placed CSK have a better than 90% chance of making the top four on points, singly or jointly, but their qualification is far from certain. They could end up tied second with three other teams (RR, SRH and LSG) or tied third with up to four other teams or tied for fourth with three other teams. What helps is their better net run rate at this stage than any of the other teams competing for the last two qualifying slots. Also, a loss against RCB in their last game will not necessarily rule them out.Fourth placed SRH have an even better chance (96.9%) of making it to the top four slots on points, singly or jointly, thanks to the extra game in hand. But they too are unsure of qualification with the possibility of four-way ties for second, five-way ties for third or three-way ties for fourth looming. The good news is that they don't have to necessarily win both their remaining games.Fifth placed RCB's chances of making it to the top four spots on points, singly or jointly, are just above 40%. Their last game against CSK is a must-win, but even winning it is not enough. Other results will need to go their way.Sixth placed DC's chances of finishing among the top four on points, singly or jointly, are barely over 31%. And if they lose to LSG, the best they can hope for is sixth.For seventh placed LSG, the game against DC is not a must-win because they have another game in hand. The bad news, however, is that despite a 56% chance of making the top four slots on points, they are looking at possible ties with up to three teams for second, up to four teams for third and up to three teams for fourth and their NRR is the worst among all the teams they could tie with.Monday's washed out game effectively ended GT 's slim chances of qualification, making them the third team after MI and PBKS to get knocked out.",Gujarat Titans are the third team to be knocked out of the Indian Premier League playoff race.

NEW DELHI: As the struggling Lucknow Super Giants prepare to face the equally desperate Delhi Capitals in a pivotal match on Tuesday in New Delhi, the spotlight will be on skipper KL Rahul as they attempt to cling to their slim chances of reaching the IPL playoffs. Following LSG's humiliating 10-wicket defeat against Sunrisers Hyderabad last Wednesday, Rahul was publicly reprimanded by team owner Sanjiv Goenka, fueling speculation about his future as captain.Rumours are rife that Rahul might step down as captain or play the remaining two matches before leaving LSG.In either case, the Indian batsman will aim to respond with his bat to seal the deal. Rahul's lacklustre performance has not only cost him a spot in the Indian T20 team but has also pushed LSG down to seventh place with 12 points, trailing RCB and SRH, who are both outside the top four.Apart from Rahul, Quinton De Kock's poor form this season has made it difficult for LSG to capitalize on the powerplay, putting pressure on players like Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran, who are not at liberty to play big shots. Despite Pooran and Ayush Badoni's heroics in the previous match, the bowlers performed miserably against the formidable SRH duo of Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma, who amassed 167 in 9.4 overs, a record by any side.On the other hand, Delhi Capitals will be hoping that the return of skipper Rishabh Pant , who was suspended for one match due to a slow over-rate against Rajasthan Royals, will help them finish on a high note. Against RCB on Sunday night, Delhi, without Pant, paid a heavy price for their sloppy fielding as those misfields and dropped catches came back to haunt them.Jack Fraser-McGurk has been their most influential batsman, scoring 330 runs at an impressive strike rate of 237.41 from seven games. Runs have also come from Abhishek Porel (269, 156.39), Pant (413, 156.43), and Tristan Stubbs (321, 185.54) this season. In the bowling department, pacers Khaleel Ahmed (16 wickets) and Mukesh Kumar (16 wickets) have provided breakthroughs, while the spin duo of Kuldeep Yadav (15) and Axar Patel (10) has shared 25 wickets.In the head-to-head matchups between Delhi Capitals (DC) and Lucknow Super Giants (LSG), LSG lead by a margin of 3-1. However, Delhi's recent win in the reverse fixture in Lucknow marked a significant breakthrough, as it was their first victory against LSG in three seasons of competition. This victory adds an interesting dynamic to their upcoming clash.The Arun Jaitley Stadium has hosted a total of 88 IPL matches, with teams winning almost an equal number of matches batting first (41) and second (46). The average first-innings total at the stadium stands at 166.51, with teams scoring at a rate of 8.49 runs per over and losing wickets at an average of 27.43 runs per dismissal. The highest total recorded at the venue was 266/7 by SRH against DC in 2024, while the lowest total was 83/10 by DC against CSK in 2013.In the last 10 IPL matches held at the Arun Jaitley Stadium, teams batting first have dominated, winning all 10 matches. The average first innings score during these matches was 211, with the winning team often posting scores around 227. Teams have typically scored 59 runs on average during the powerplay overs and 54 runs in the death overs, showcasing the stadium's reputation as a high-scoring venue favouring teams setting big targets.ALSO SEE: IPL Playoffs Prediction Hub Given the historical data and trends at the Kotla, it's anticipated that the pitch will favour batsmen, setting the stage for a high-scoring encounter. With a track record of producing batting-friendly conditions, teams can expect the ball to come onto the bat nicely, allowing for fluent stroke play and big hits. Batsmen who are able to adapt quickly to the pace and bounce of the surface are likely to thrive, capitalizing on any loose deliveries and making the most of the true bounce.1) With the Kotla pitch expected to be batting-friendly and conducive to high scores, investing in top-order batsmen who can capitalize on the good batting conditions would be a wise fantasy choice. Look for players with a history of performing well on such pitches and who have the ability to score big runs at a brisk pace.2) Given the likelihood of a high-scoring game, all-rounders who can contribute with both bat and ball will be valuable fantasy picks. Look for players who have the ability to make significant contributions with the bat while also chipping in with crucial wickets or economical bowling spells, thereby maximizing their fantasy points potential.David Warner, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Abishek Porel, Rishabh Pant (C, wk), Shai Hope, Tristan Stubbs, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Mukesh Kumar, Ishant Sharma, Khaleel AhmedRasikh SalamQuinton de Kock, KL Rahul (C, wk), Marcus Stoinis, Nicholas Pooran, Ayush Badoni, Deepak Hooda, Krunal Pandya, Mohsin Khan/Arshin Kulkarni, Yash Thakur, Ravi Bishnoi, Naveen-ul-HaqK GowthamIPL 2024 stats: 330 runs in 8 matchesIn the IPL 2024 season, Jake Fraser-McGurk showcased his batting with an impressive tally of 330 runs in just 8 matches.

NEW DELHI: Royal Challengers Bengaluru have orchestrated a remarkable resurgence in the Indian Premier League (IPL) playoff race, bouncing back from their early-season struggles under the captaincy of Faf du Plessis . Following a rocky start, marked by seven losses in their first eight matches, Bengaluru embarked on an impressive five-match winning streak.Sunday's commanding 47-run victory over Delhi Capitals propelled them to fifth place in the table with 12 points, edging past Delhi and Lucknow on net run rate .In a must-win encounter, Bengaluru overcame the early setbacks of Du Plessis and leading run-scorer Virat Kohli , as Will Jacks' brisk 41 off 29 balls and Rajat Patidar's aggressive 52 off 32 deliveries powered them to a challenging total of 187-9.Their bowlers then delivered a clinical performance, dismantling Delhi's batting line up to dismiss them for 140 in 19.1 overs. Pacer Yash Dayal starred with the ball, claiming three crucial wickets to seal Bengaluru's emphatic victory and reignite their playoff aspirations in the IPL.After LSG lost to DC on Tuesday, RCB now need to secure a victory against CSK in their last league game by either:- Winning by 18 runs.- Chasing the target within 18.1 overs.This is necessary to surpass CSK's Net Run Rate (NRR).- If SRH (Sunrisers Hyderabad) loses both of their matches then both CSK and RCB have a chance to qualify.- RCB's qualification hinges on winning their last match, regardless of their Net Run Rate.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru beat Delhi Capitals by 47 runs.

"We'd have a better chance of qualifying if I had played against RCB, says Rishabh Pant",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/wed-have-a-better-chance-of-qualifying-if-i-had-played-against-rcb-says-rishabh-pant/articleshow/110126758.cms,"(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Rishabh Pant , the skipper of Delhi Capitals , expressed his belief that his one-match suspension likely cost the team a spot in the IPL playoffs . Pant stated that had he been on the field, DC would have had a better chance of winning the crucial game.Pant was sidelined for the must-win clash against Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) on Sunday due to a one-match suspension imposed on him for a third slow-over rate offense.The absence of Pant proved detrimental as DC not only lost the game but also suffered a 47-run defeat, impacting their net run rate.Now, DC must patiently await the outcomes of other teams' matches to determine if they have qualified for the playoffs or not, highlighting the significance of Pant's absence in such a crucial encounter.""I wouldn't say we would have definitely won the game if I had played. But we had a better chance of qualifying if I would have had a chance to play in the last game,"" Pant said after DC's 19-run win over Lucknow Super Giants.DC experienced a rollercoaster ride during the initial stages of the season, grappling with inconsistency. However, they mounted a late surge towards the end of the campaign, bolstering their prospects of securing a spot in the playoffs.Unfortunately, injuries to key players further compounded their challenges. Veteran pacers Ishant Sharma, Khaleel Ahmed, and Mukesh Kumar, along with opener David Warner, found themselves sidelined due to various injuries.These absences undoubtedly posed additional hurdles for DC, testing the depth of their squad and resilience in adverse circumstances. Despite the setbacks, the team displayed commendable determination as they navigated through the obstacles in their quest for playoff qualification.""We started the season with a lot of hope, but there were injuries, and ups and downs. But as a franchise, you can't complain all the time; you have to make use of what you have... There are some things which you can control, but some things which you can't.""Losing skipper KL Rahul said that loss of wickets in the powerplay throughout the season has prevented LSG from utilising big-hitters like Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran .""This has been a problem right through the season - we keep losing a lot of wickets in the powerplay, we never get a solid start to get the likes of Stoinis and Pooran in, that is the big reason why we are in this position."" he said.",Delhi Capitals skipper Rishabh Pant believes his one-match suspension likely cost the team a spot in the IPL playoffs. Pant was sidelined for the must-win clash against Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) on Sunday. DC not only lost the game but also suffered a 47-run defeat.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110126742,imgsize-46064,width-400,resizemode-4/110126742.jpg"

After Delhi Capitals defeated Lucknow Super Giants on Tuesday to keep their slender playoffs qualification hopes alive, Rajasthan Royals became the second team to book a spot in the top four of the ongoing Indian Premier League Only six league matches left in the tournament, and five teams are still in the fray for the two remaining playoff spots.Here's the chances of the teams in contention of the final two spots in the IPL playoffs: KKR now have a 75% chance of finishing sole toppers and a 25% chance of ending up in sole second spot, assuming no more matches get rained off.If they win their last game, they will top. They could top even if they lose their last game, provided RR don’t win both their remaining games* RR will top the table if they win their remaining games. Their chances of being sole toppers are a respectable 25%. They also have about 40% chance of finishing sole second. They are now guaranteed qualification because even if they lose both their remaining games, they will either finish sole third or tied for third with* Third placed CSK are sure to finish among the top four teams on points, but are not assured of qualification. They could end up tied third with up to four other teams (DC, RCB, SRH and LSG) or tied fourth with up to three other teams (DC, RCB and LSG) depending on results in other games. What helps is their better net run rate at this stage* Fourth placed SRH too are sure to finish among the top four on points, but they too are not sure of qualification. They could find themselves in a tie with four other teams (DC, RCB, CSK and LSG) for third place if they lose both their remaining games. They could also end up in a three-way tie for fourth spot with DC and LSG. But even just one win from their two remaining games would guarantee qualification* Fifth placed DC’s chances of finishing among the top four on points, singly or jointly, have doubled to 62.5% thanks to Tuesday’s win. But they are far from sure of qualifying. A third place finish on points would involve a four-way or five-way tie, while finishing fourth would mean a two-way to four-way tie depending on results in other games* Sixth placed RCB have a 50% chance of making it to the top four spots on points, singly or jointly. Their last game against CSK is a must-win, but even winning it is not enough. Other results will need to go their way* Seventh placed LSG, despite Tuesday’s loss, are not out of it yet. They still have a 31% chance of finishing among the top four spots on points, singly or jointly. The bad news, however, is that finishing third would involve a five-way tie while ending up joint fourth would mean a three-way or four-way tie and their NRR is the worst among all the teams they could tie with* MI, PBKS and GT have already been knocked out.",Five teams are still in the fray for the two remaining playoff spots.

With Jake Fraser-McGurk and Tristan Stubbs bringing intimidating hitting through the second half of the IPL , Abhishek Porel on Tuesday showed he has brought in consistency to his elegant strokeplay.Against a rather thoughtful Lucknow Super Giants bowling attack on a tiring Kotla track, Porel made up for McGurk’s rare failure with a sublime 33-ball 58 to lay the foundation for the hulk-like Stubbs to close the innings with an unbeaten 25-ball 57 as Capitals posted 208/4.The maturity of the two batters in their early 20s trumped the experienced LSG top order as Capitals finished the league stage with a 19-run win and 14 points.While defending the total, the experience of Ishant Sharma (3/34) and Kuldeep Yadav (1/33) knocked the wind out of the LSG batting despite Nicholas Pooran’s ominous knock of 27-ball 61, Arshad Khan’s late charge of unbeaten 58 off 33 to take LSG to 189/9 and Capitals’ customary ordinary catching abilities.Tuesday’s result, however, has placed both teams on the verge of falling short of making it to the playoffs.Capitals’ have been spoilt by McGurk’s onslaught up front in an innings. When the maverick opener was thoughtfully dismissed for a duck at long on off the second ball of the innings bowled by left-arm seamer Arshad Khan, it seemed Capitals could fall behind on a surface that has regularly produced scores of well above 200 this year.But Porel raised his hand this time to calm the Capitals dugout before Stubbs allayed all fears of a possible collapse and powerfully finish the innings on a high.Porel isn’t anything like McGurk’s muscle game. It was all timing and match awareness that saw Porel take Capitals 73/1 at the end of the powerplay. By the time he reached his 50 off just 21 balls, he had already hit four sixes and five boundaries. The pitch wasn’t as flat as it has been here this IPL. The cutters into pitch stopped on the batters as Shai Hope had to really wait to pick his deliveries to go big.Perhaps, it was the heat coupled with some shrewd bowling into pitch by Ravi Bishnoi that put the brakes on the Capitals charge. Porel seemed to be running out of gas even as his skipper Rishabh Pant was taking his time to score 33 off 23.Once Porel was dismissed caught at deep mid-wicket, it looked like Bishnoi and left-arm pacer Mohsin Khan had worked out a way to apply the choke with spells of 1/26 and 0/29 respectively.This is where Stubbs displayed his rapid evolution as a batter. He batted just 25 balls and hit four sixes and three boundaries. But the innings was well thought out.Understanding that going after spin straightaway isn’t his strongest game, he bided his time against the Bishnoi by knocking him into the gaps for singles. But he unleashed his fury at the back end of the innings.",Delhi Capitals beat Lucknow Super Giants by 19 runs in IPL. Abhishek Porel and Tristan Stubbs top scored with 58 and 57 respectively. Capitals finished the league stage with a 19-run win and 14 points.

With three teams eliminated and one assured of a top-two finish, there are six teams still in the race to IPL 2024 playoffs with only seven league-stage matches left to play.The rain-abandoned match between Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) and Gujarat Titans in Ahmedabad on Monday meant that the two-time champions KKR (19 points, 1 match left) assured themselves of a top-two finish, while Gujarat joined Punjab Kings and Mumbai Indians as the teams eliminated from the race to playoffs.On Tuesday, Delhi Capitals (DC) host the Lucknow Super Giants (LSG), and with every match now, the playoff scenarios change.With the sun turning Delhi into a hot furnace, there is no threat of a Ahmedabad-like weather affecting the DC vs LSG match at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in the national capital. So based on the two possible results, here's how the fortunes of the two teams will get affected.Occupuing the sixth spot on the table currently with 12 points from 13 matches, this is Delhi's last league match, which means losing is not an option at all because if LSG win, Rishabh Pant & Co will become the fourth team to bow out.Lucknow also have 12 points but have played a match less than Delhi. But a win over DC won't assure Lucknow of a place in the playoffs. Their chances will improve but to qualify, they will have to beat Mumbai Indians in their last match and hope that the Sunrisers Hyderabad (14 points, 2 matches left) lose both their remaining matches.A win for DC will mean that they stay in the race to playoffs but their faint hopes will heavily depends on results in other league matches.If Delhi beat Lucknow, they will then want Royal Challengers Bengaluru (12 points, 1 match left) and LSG to lose their remaining matches. Besides that, Sunrisers will need to lose their last two games with big margins for DC to enter the playoffs.","Rain-abandoned match between Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) and Gujarat Titans in Ahmedabad on Monday meant that the two-time champions KKR (19 points, 1 match left) assured themselves of a top-two finish.

Despite a challenging 2023 season, Porel has shown significant improvement this year. His hard-hitting knocks, especially as an opener, have been instrumental for DC.Porel's innings against Punjab Kings, Mumbai Indians, Sunrisers Hyderabad, and Rajasthan Royals demonstrated his ability to perform under pressure and take on international talent with confidence. He also showcased his versatility by donning the wicketkeeping gloves in Pant's absence against Royal Challengers Bangalore.With impressive statistics of 327 runs in 12 innings at an average of 32.70 and a strike rate of 159.51, including two half-centuries, Porel has established himself as a key player for DC.Alongside Fraser-McGurk, Stubbs, Pant, and Axar Patel, Porel could form the core of Delhi Capitals' lineup in the future, representing the next phase of the team's evolution.","Delhi Capitals may have concluded their 2024 Indian Premier League ( IPL ) season with a win over Lucknow Super Giants (LSG), but their journey to the playoffs remains uncertain.

NEW DELHI: Former India head coach Ravi Shastri took a swipe at the concept of the Spirit of Cricket while discussing on veteran Indian off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin 's YouTube channel, suggesting that he prioritises adherence to rules over the ""spirit of cricket.""Shastri's remarks come in the context of incidents during India's Test series in England in 2021, during which India secured a historic victory at Lord's in the second Test.One notable incident involved England's James Anderson engaging in a heated argument with Indian players, particularly Jasprit Bumrah .During the match, Bumrah delivered a series of bouncers to Anderson, resulting in him being struck on the helmet, ribs, and left hand. This led to a tense exchange of words between the players involved.Reminiscing on the argument, Shastri said on Ashwin's channel, ""What is wrong with that? You got a bat in your hand. There is no rule that tail-enders you should not(bounce). Then declare the innings, no? If it gets too hot in the kitchen and you do not want to be there, then stay inside, be clear, your fingers are fine, everything is fine, and you can bowl as much as you want so that you are not injured.""Shastri continued to discuss the concept of the 'Spirit of Cricket,' which has garnered significant attention recently, particularly concerning incidents of batters being run out at the non-striker's end. Although this mode of dismissal is entirely legal within the rules of the game, it has been viewed by many experts and fans as going against the spirit of cricket.One notable incident involved Ashwin, who famously dismissed England batterJos Buttler in a similar manner during an IPL game. Ashwin's action attracted criticism, with many fans and experts calling for bowlers to warn the non-striker before executing such a dismissal.Several other players, including Indian women's cricketer Deepti Sharma , have also employed this mode of dismissal, resulting in criticism from ex-cricketers and fans alike. Critics argue that the 'spirit of cricket' should take precedence over strict adherence to the rules in such cases.Shastri said that he is a believer in rules, rather than the spirit.""Forget spirit. I believe in rules. You (Ashwin) mankaded a guy, it rules, there's a rule book, observe the damn rules. A guy running two steps ahead, 'It's not fair, you should warn me.' For what warn? The rule says you're cheating. I hate warnings. I'll take the bails off straightaway. On your bike now! Rule book page 33. Don't whinge and moan after the event. It's there.

NEW DELHI: The Punjab Kings are set to resume action against the Rajasthan Royals at the Barsapara Cricket Stadium in Guwahati on Wednesday, aiming to conclude the season positively.Although they haven't advanced further in the competition, the Kings' squad sees the remaining two games as an opportunity for the young players to showcase their skills freely and leave a lasting impression in the tournament.During the pre-match press conference on Tuesday, Punjab Kings assistant coach Brad Haddin emphasized that the team management's priority is to provide maximum exposure to inexperienced players in the upcoming matches.""We want the guys to play with freedom. Tomorrow's game is for them to go out there and express themselves. It is another opportunity for younger guys in the team to develop. We are confident that they will take this opportunity and put on a show with the skills we know they have. The players must see these games as opportunities to get that big score and to have that breakout performance in the IPL with which they can kick on for years to come,"" Haddin said.""It's tough being eliminated. But in this tournament, there are always good opportunities to play against quality opposition. From our point of view, we want to make sure that the players forget what has happened before and focus on where they can improve,"" the former Australia international was quoted as saying in a release.Rajasthan Royals have been one of the top teams in the ongoing IPL season, maintaining a consistent winning run. With youngsters like Riyan Parag being spectacular with the bat, veterans such as Sanju Samson chipping in at the top order, and a bowling unit led by speedster Trent Boult, the Royals have posed a hard challenge for all opposition.""We know the quality that Rajasthan Royals have. They have got some really good bowlers up front with Boult, and they got two quality spinners in the middle, and they got a lot of power at the back. But it's important that we get our process right. We focus on continuing to develop our players,"" Haddin said.The 22-year-old Parag may further have an advantage in Guwahati on Wednesday, as he will be playing the match in his home state and will be familiar with the conditions. On being asked about their strategies to tackle the explosive batter, Haddin revealed a secret weapon.""If you look at Riyan's development over the last couple of years, he's gradually got better and better. This year, he has been starting to win games. But we're lucky we have a secret weapon to tackle him in Trevor Gonsalves, who has coached him all the way through. He gave some really good insights into him during the team meeting. So, we have a couple of plans,"" he said.Further speaking on the threat posed by Samson, Haddin added: ""Samson has also played some really good cricket for a long, long time. Now he's one of the important wickets for the opposition. But that is an opportunity for our bowling group who have been good throughout the tournament. Samson is among the players our bowlers would want to make uncomfortable and get the wicket of and put the odds back in our favour.""Haddin further praised the pitch in Guwahati and said that his side have a good experience of playing on the surface. ""The pitch is very impressive. We had a good run last night and the surface looks great. We were lucky enough to have a bit of practice on one of the centre wickets as well and it was really consistent. The wickets outside are also of good quality. We have good memories here as well; I think we won last year as well. So, we can take a bit of confidence that we understand the surface,"" he said.With Liam Livingstone and Kagiso Rabada returning home due to injuries, Punjab Kings are expected to make a few changes against Rajasthan. On being asked about the possible playing team, Haddin kept the cards close to his chest.""There will be a few changes with Livingstone and Rabada returning home.

He leaves PSG as the club's all-time leading scorer with 256 goals since joining from Monaco in 2017 for a fee of 180 million euros ($194 million).PSG had already secured a record-extending 12th French title and their 10th in 12 years before the match against Toulouse. The celebrations following the game were intended to focus on their title triumph rather than serving as a specific tribute to Mbappe. PSG can still complete a domestic treble by winning the French Cup final against Lyon on May 25, having already claimed the Champions Trophy, France's equivalent of the Super Cup.In other Ligue 1 action, Monaco secured second place and direct qualification for next season's Champions League with a 2-0 victory at Montpellier.

NEW DELHI: Arsenal revived their hopes of clinching the Premier League title by overcoming their Old Trafford struggles with a hard-fought 1-0 victory over Manchester United on Sunday, propelling them back to the top of the table.Leandro Trossard 's goal in the 20th minute proved decisive as Arsenal secured only their second win in 17 away games at United, reclaiming the league summit by a single point.While Manchester City still control their fate in the title race with two matches remaining compared to Arsenal's one, Mikel Arteta 's side kept the pressure on the defending champions ahead of their crucial clash with Tottenham Hotspur .The defeat further compounded United's woes, diminishing their hopes of European competition next season.Despite showing more resilience than in their previous match against Crystal Palace, where they suffered a 4-0 loss, Erik ten Hag's side have struggled for consistency, winning just one of their last eight Premier League games.Arsenal's resurgence in 2024 has been remarkable, winning 15 and drawing one of their 17 league matches since the turn of the year. However, their victory at Old Trafford was far from convincing, as they battled stifling heat and a determined United side.United's injury woes and defensive vulnerabilities were exposed once again, with Casemiro's error leading to Trossard's decisive goal. The absence of key players like Bruno Fernandes only added to their struggles.Despite a spirited second-half display from United, Arsenal held firm defensively, securing their sixth clean sheet in their last seven away league games. United's late efforts, including Alejandro Garnacho's chance that hit the side-netting, were not enough to salvage a result.Arsenal's determination to see out the game was evident in their defensive resolve and tactical discipline, denying United any clear-cut opportunities to equalize.As the title race heads towards its conclusion, Arsenal's victory sets up an intriguing finale, with Manchester City still in control of their destiny.

NEW DELHI: Manchester United clinched their first Women's FA Cup title with a commanding 4-0 triumph over Tottenham Hotspur in the final on Sunday. Under the guidance of manager Marc Skinner , the team avenged their defeat in last year's final to Chelsea by putting on a dominant display.The match saw United assert their authority, with midfielder Ella Toone breaking the deadlock on the stroke of halftime with a spectacular strike.After the break, Rachel Williams extended their lead with a well-timed header, followed by two goals from Spanish forward Lucia Garcia , sealing a comprehensive victory.This triumph marks a significant milestone for Manchester United's women's team, who have steadily progressed since their reformation in 2018. Winning their first major trophy will undoubtedly serve as a source of pride and motivation for the players and staff alike as they continue to make strides in women's football.""Wembley is always special. Last year we spoke as a group and said 'one day that will be ours' and today's the day so I'm buzzing,"" said goalkeeper Mary Earps.The atmosphere at Wembley Stadium was electric on a sunny day, with a staggering 76,082 fans in attendance, including Manchester United's co-owner Avram Glazer and Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy. Despite the anticipation, the first half of the match produced few noteworthy chances, with the breakthrough coming in the second minute of stoppage time.It was England's Ella Toone who seized the moment, driving the ball forward and unleashing a powerful strike from outside the area that found the top corner of the net. This stunning goal gave Manchester United a crucial lead heading into halftime.Tottenham, appearing in their first-ever FA Cup final, struggled to pose any attacking threat throughout the match, failing to register a single shot on target. Their hopes were further dashed after the break as United's Rachel Williams, a former Spurs player who had previously won the FA Cup with Birmingham City, rose high to head in a free kick, extending United's lead.Spanish forward Lucia Garcia capitalized on a mistake from Tottenham goalkeeper Becky Spencer, intercepting a poor pass and slotting the ball into the net to make it 3-0 in the 57th minute. Garcia then secured her brace, and United's victory, with another goal in the 74th minute, this time via a deflection.This triumph comes as a bright spot in Manchester United's challenging season, where they have struggled in the league standings, currently sitting fifth. Winning the Women's FA Cup represents a significant achievement for the club and underscores their progress since reforming the women's team in 2018.""We don't like to admit it but it does mask over the issues we've had,"" goalscorer Williams, 36, told the BBC. ""We have had some ups and downs this year. That's for Marc (Skinner) and the backroom staff to be like 'right, this is what we have to do in the summer'.""We are going to have change things next year. We have had some injuries, three or four ACLs, at the start of the season.""That's football, teams go through transition. You have a good year, you have a dip. Next year we might just come back bigger, better and stronger and, who knows, we might just be lifting the league.""",Manchester United beat Tottenham Hotspur 4-0 in the Women's FA Cup final.

NEW DELHI: Lionel Messi played the full 90 minutes in Inter Miami's 3-2 victory over Montreal on Saturday night, despite a brief injury scare in the first half. Benjamin Cremaschi scored the decisive goal in the 59th minute, helping Inter Miami secure their fifth straight Major League Soccer win after overcoming a two-goal deficit.Luis Suarez and Matías Rojas also found the back of the net for Inter Miami, while Jules-Anthony Vilsaint and Bryce Duke scored for Montreal (3-5-3).Inter Miami (8-2-3) stretched their unbeaten run to seven matches (5-0-2), even though Messi failed to score or assist for the first time in his nine MLS appearances this season. The team has a 7-0-2 record in those nine games, with one of their losses coming against Montreal in March when Messi was not playing.Messi experienced a concerning moment towards the end of the first half when he was fouled by George Campbell . The impact of the challenge caused Messi to fall to the ground, visibly in pain and clutching his left knee.Inter Miami's medical staff attended to Messi on the field, and after about two minutes, he got up and walked to the sideline. He was not substituted, allowing him to return to the game shortly after.Remarkably, the match dynamics shifted following Messi's injury scare. Inter Miami was trailing 2-0 when Messi got hurt, but the score was 2-1 when he returned, and they equalized moments after he re-entered the field. Rojas scored from a free kick that Messi would typically take, putting Inter Miami on the scoreboard. Suarez then tapped in a goal from a corner kick late in first-half stoppage time, becoming the third player in MLS history to score 11 goals in his first 800 minutes of a season.Cremaschi's go-ahead goal came when Rojas sent a ball into open space, and the young midfielder ran it down, nudging the ball just past two defenders and into the net for a 3-2 lead. Messi had two chances to extend the lead in the final minutes but narrowly missed both.The match attracted a sellout crowd of 19,619 spectators, with Montreal selling out its 15,000 season tickets for the first time since joining MLS in 2012, largely due to Messi's arrival in the league last summer. Messi has now scored in 31 countries throughout his career.",Lionel Messi played the full 90 minutes in Inter Miami's 3-2 victory over Montreal.
