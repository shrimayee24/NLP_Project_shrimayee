Cam Ward’s shots fired at Dallas Cowboys might kickstart an NFL rivalry before draft day

""Some teams in the NFL did a lot of two-high stuff, like Dallas, called a lot of Tampa, a lot of cover-two. They leave way too much space on the sideline down the seams.""

""I just think the arm strength and the confidence that I'm bringing, along with me getting my receivers better, I just think I'll be able to put the ball where I want.""

Tennessee Titans locked on Cam Ward as top pick, already planning future beyond Will Levis

""General consensus seems to be that the Titans, who recently had dinner with Ward, will take him No. 1 overall.""

""There's virtually no doubt the Titans are taking Cam Ward.""

Cam Ward hasn’t taken an NFL snap, but he's already running the show

""I've been dreaming about this since I was a kid. Whether it's NFL, MLB or NBA, I wanted to go pro in something. That's always been my destiny.""

""I got hands,""

""I'm interchangeable.""

Cam Ward isn't even in the NFL yet, but he's already throwing shade like a seasoned vet. The Miami quarterback confidently tore into NFL coverages, specifically calling out the Dallas Cowboys after his pro day. With Tennessee Titans locked in on him for the No. 1 pick, Ward isn't just talking the talk—he’s flexing some serious confidence.Ward sat down with CBS Sports after his pro day, and when asked about stepping up to NFL defenses, he casually threw shade directly at Dallas:That’s not your average pre-draft banter. Ward just casually dissected one of the league’s high-profile defenses, pointing out exactly where they mess up. The Cowboys might have to rethink their coverage, or at least circle Ward’s name for revenge when the rookie finally hits the field.Ward's confidence doesn't stop there—he fully believes he'll put the ball exactly where he wants at the pro level. As he put it himself:With talk like this, Ward isn’t waiting for Week 1—he’s already playing mind games.Multiple NFL insiders are convinced the Tennessee Titans have zero doubt about drafting Cam Ward No. 1 overall. Cleveland Browns insider Mary Kay Cabot made it clear:NFL reporter Gary Myers also echoed this, citing league sources:Even ESPN Cleveland’s Tony Grossi confirms the Titans have no intention of trading away the top pick. They're completely sold on Ward’s talent, confidence, and NFL-readiness.The Titans’ love for Ward also means Tennessee is fully prepared to move on from quarterback Will Levis, their second-round pick from 2023. NFL insider Josina Anderson confirmed Tennessee wants to transition away from Levis this offseason. Ward isn't even officially drafted yet, but he's already forcing Tennessee to shuffle the deck at quarterback.Former NFL GM Mike Tannenbaum thinks this makes perfect sense, calling Ward to the Titans ""an easy decision."" He also has Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders penciled in at No. 2 or 3, likely to the Browns or New York Giants. Sanders might be next-best, but right now, Ward owns the spotlight.Ward’s pre-NFL confidence and his Cowboys jab have everyone talking. The Titans clearly believe he's their franchise quarterback. Ward himself sees this as inevitable, telling former Titans GM Ran Carthon:He’s got the swagger, the arm, and apparently, the hands too—jokingly flexing about a trick-play reception during pro day:Ward said.Seattle Seahawks safety Quandre Diggs, Ward's cousin, even expressed openly that he wants to team up with him after draft day. Clearly, Ward isn't just another rookie prospect—he's already changing team plans, rivalries, and narratives before he even steps on an NFL field.","Miami quarterback Cam Ward threw shade at the Dallas Cowboys after his pro day.

Officials break up goalie fight as Jeremy Swayman confronts Dracy Kuemper

The Boston Bruins ’ struggles continued with a 7-1 loss to the Angeles Kings, extending their losing streak to six games. A heated moment saw Jeremy Swayman challenge Darcy Kuemper to a goalie fight , but officials intervened. Defenseman Nikita Zadorov didn’t mince words, calling the team’s performance “embarrassing.”During the second period, Bruins forward Marat Khusnutdinov got into an altercation with Kings goalie Darcy Kuemper. Kuemper responded by jabbing Khusnutdinov with his blocker before putting him in a headlock. This sparked a reaction from Bruins goalie Jeremy Swayman, who, after allowing seven goals and posting a .696 save percentage, skated to the red line to challenge Dracy Kuemper to a fight.Kuemper accepted the challenge, and Swayman took off his gloves and mask, ready to fight. However, the officials quickly intervened, preventing the two goalies from going at it.After the game, The Athletic’s Fluto Shinzawa asked Bruins defenseman Nikita Zadorov—a veteran known for his physical play—about his thoughts on Swayman stepping up. Instead of praising his goalie’s actions, Zadorov dismissed the idea, making it clear he didn’t see it the same way.“Is that what it is?” Zadorov said. “Looked like it,” Shinzawa replied. “OK,” Zadorov said. “I don’t know. No comment.” Zadorov didn't hold back his thoughts on the goaltending either. “Everything goes in,” Zadorov said. “It’s embarrassing, obviously. How many times we get beat by these teams scoring six goals, seven goals on us this year? It’s definitely unacceptable. It’s not what we’re looking for. Not much to say after this one, for sure.”Sunday’s game was another tough outing for Jeremy Swayman, marking his fourth straight start without a save percentage above .900.At the time of his challenge to Kuemper, the Bruins were down 3-2. The Kings had just taken the lead after Drew Doughty capitalized on a rebound Swayman couldn’t control. Los Angeles then extended their lead with a late second-period goal before dominating the third, scoring three more times to seal the blowout.Also Read: Jakob Chychrun injury update: Capitals fans express concern as the star player suffered a scary wrist injury Toronto hopes Laughton can turn things around as they face his former team, the Flyers, on Tuesday at Scotiabank Arena.

Rhea Ripley has a WWE title opportunity before WrestleMania 41

Rhea Ripley has one last chance to make it to WrestleMania 41 following the events that went down on this week's edition of WWE RAW.Rhea Ripley was riding the wave of success and was set to compete in her third straight title match at WrestleMania this year. However, it was IYO Sky who dethroned her for the WWE Women's World title before that and got her slot. But Mami was not going to let the road to WrestleMania walk past her, and now she has one last chance to earn her place at The Show of Shows this year.Last week on RAW, Rhea Ripley interrupted the contract signing between IYO Sky and Bianca Belair for their title match at WrestleMania 41. She took out both competitors and signed her name on the contract, creating confusion in the process. However, RAW GM Adam Pearce came out on this week's edition of the show that took place at the OVO Hydro in Glasgow, Scotland.Pearce clarified the situation by saying that Rhea Ripley was not a part of the match despite signing the contract. This led to IYO Sky coming out to the ring first and making it clear it did not matter who she faced. Bianca Belair came out next and claimed that she earned her one-on-one match for the title by winning the Elimination Chamber match. Rhea Ripley joined last and shouted that she only cared about having her rematch.The situation began to boil up, much like every trio confrontation in the last few weeks, and Adam Pearce made his decision. Next week on RAW, IYO Sky will defend her WWE Women's World title against Rhea Ripley, with the winner facing Bianca Belair at WrestleMania 41.The announcement led to an all-out brawl between the trio as tensions continued to build up on the road to WrestleMania. Later in the night, Adam Pearce added another twist to the title match next week. Bianca Belair will serve as the Special Guest Referee for the match between IYO Sky and Rhea Ripley, making it a must-see encounter for next week's WWE RAW.Also read: WWE RAW Results & Highlights (3/24/25): John Cena lays out his plan to retire as the 'last real champion'",Rhea Ripley was set to compete in her third straight title match at WrestleMania this year.

Jimmy Butler calls out 'Heat Culture' hype: 'You can name it whatever you want',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/jimmy-butler-calls-out-heat-culture-hype-you-can-name-it-whatever-you-want/articleshow/119481740.cms,"Image Via Todd Kirkland/Getty Images

Is 'Heat Culture' really the key to winning? Jimmy Butler isn't convinced



The Athletic

Jimmy Butler has never been one to hold back, and his latest take on the Miami Heat ’s famed "" Heat Culture "" is no exception. After spending over five seasons with the franchise, Butler was traded to the Golden State Warriors in a major deal on February 5. Since then, he’s been thriving, helping the Warriors go on a 16-4 run and climb to the sixth seed in the Western Conference. However, in a sit-down with The Athletic ’s Anthony Slater, Butler didn’t hesitate to question just how much ""Heat Culture"" actually factors into Miami’s success.For years, ""Heat Culture"" has been Miami Heat ’s signature, built on toughness, discipline, and a relentless drive to win. The franchise pushes it hard, and the fans take pride in it. But Jimmy Butler , who helped lead the Heat to the NBA Finals in 2020 and 2023, isn’t convinced it’s the magic formula people make it out to be. To him, it’s less about a defined culture and more about having the right guys who buy into winning.“There was some foundation to it in the sense of the work and all that stuff, which is great,” Butler told. “I’m not saying it in a bad way, but I think it’s a little bit, like, overused talking about the ‘Heat Culture.’ It is a great organization. But I think a large part of that culture is you get guys that buy into a (winning mindset).”Butler sees it pretty simply—the Heat, or any team for that matter, win because of the talent they have and the players’ commitment to a common goal. Miami has built an identity around toughness and grit, but in his eyes, that’s not what makes or breaks a team. Winning comes down to having the right guys who buy in, not just a catchy mantra.“You get some guys that buy in, you get some really good players and you get the opportunity to talk about ‘Heat Culture’ a little bit more,” Butler explained. “I’m not saying it to talk down or anything, but I think whenever you have really good players you can name it whatever you want to name it.”Jimmy Butler's Golden State Warriors success shows winning is about talent, not 'Heat Culture'Butler’s departure from Miami wasn’t entirely smooth. Before his trade to the Warriors, he was indefinitely suspended by the Heat due to internal friction with the franchise. While he hasn’t spoken much about the specifics of his exit, his comments suggest he sees team success as more about player commitment than a branded culture.Since arriving in Golden State, Butler has seamlessly fit into the Warriors' system, helping the team turn their season around. The Warriors’ resurgence further supports his point—teams with elite players and the right mentality will find ways to win, regardless of the slogans attached to them.Butler’s take challenges the traditional narrative surrounding team culture in the NBA. Much like the New England Patriots’ famed “Patriot Way” in the NFL, the Heat’s culture has been celebrated as a defining characteristic. However, Butler argues that while having a guiding principle is beneficial, it’s not the secret ingredient to success.Also Read: Jimmy Butler on Draymond Green’s Defensive Masterclass Against Milwaukee Bucks: ‘You Gotta Respect the Hell Out of That’ At the end of the day, Butler believes that culture is what you make of it—and having the right players matters more than the words used to define a franchise. Now, in Golden State, he’s proving that winning isn’t about the name of the culture, but about the talent and mindset of the players who embrace it.","Jimmy Butler was traded to the Golden State Warriors in a major deal on February 5.

The Punjab Kings will begin their IPL 2025 season against the Gujarat Titans today, with Shreyas Iyer making his debut as captain.After 18 years without a title, the franchise is counting on Iyer’s leadership to turn their fortunes around. Having led Kolkata Knight Riders to IPL title last season and Delhi Capitals to the final in 2020, Iyer is seen as the ideal choice to revitalise the team.Punjab Kings have struggled in recent seasons, failing to reach the top five in the last four editions. Their best IPL result came in 2014, when they were runners-up, and in 2018, when they reached the semifinals.Iyer’s appointment as captain represents a new strategy, further strengthened by his reunion with coach Ricky Ponting, with whom he has enjoyed success in the past.Both captains - Iyer and Shubman Gill - come into this match in great form, following their performances in India's recent Champions Trophy win in Dubai. Iyer led in run-scoring with 243 runs in five matches, while Gujarat Titans' skipper Gill impressed with a century against Bangladesh.The Gujarat Titans, who won the IPL title in 2022 and were runners-up in 2023, faced challenges last season under Gill's captaincy, finishing eighth.Aiming for a strong comeback, the Titans have built a formidable squad, featuring Gill and Jos Buttler as openers, along with a solid middle order including Sherfane Rutherford, Sai Sudharsan, and Masood Shahrukh Khan. The all-round capabilities of Rashid Khan, Rahul Tewatia, Glenn Phillips, Washington Sundar, and Mahipal Lomror enhance their depth and potential.Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad has hosted 25 IPL matches in its history with the side batting second winning 15 of them. If that stat alone were a reflection, the winning captain at the toss should choose to field first.With Gill suggesting a 240-260 run total in the pre-match press conference, expect one more run-fest this season.In the last match played at this venue, Rajasthan Royals beat the Royal Challengers Bengaluru. Batting first, RCB scored 172 and RR chased that down courtesy Yashasvi Jaiswal's rapid 45 runs. The highest total at this venue is 233, scored by Gujarat Titans.Shubman Gill (C), Jos Buttler, Sai Sudarshan, Shahrukh Khan, Glenn Philips, Washington Sundar, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Kagiso Rabada, Mohammed Siraj.GT Impact Subs: Ishant Sharma/Mahipal LomrorShreyas Iyer, Prabhsimran Singh, Priyansh Arya, Marcus Stoinis, Glenn Maxwell , Shashank Singh, Nehal Wadhera/Suryansh Shedge, Marco Jansen, Harpreet Brar, Lockie Ferguson, Arshdeep SinghPBKS Impact Subs: Yuzvendra Chahal/Vishnu Vinod.Gujarat Giants: Shubman Gill (c), Anuj Rawat, Jos Buttler, Kumar Kushagra, Sherfane Rutherford, Sai Sudharsan, M Shahrukh Khan, Rashid Khan, Karim Janat, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Phillips, Nishant Sindhu, Manav Suthar, Rahul Tewatia, Washington Sundar, Arshad Khan, Gerald Coetzee, Gurnoor Brar, Kulwant Khejroliya, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Kagiso Rabada, Sai Kishore, Ishant Sharma, Jayant Yadav.Punjab Kings: Shreyas Iyer (c), Priyansh Arya, Pyla Avinash, Harnoor Singh, Josh Inglis, Prabhsimran Singh, Vishnu Vinod, Nehal Wadhera, Azmatullah Omarzai, Aaron Hardie, Marco Jansen, Glenn Maxwell, Musheer Khan, Shashank Singh, Marcus Stoinis, Suryansh Shedge, Arshdeep Singh, Xavier Bartlett, Yuzvendra Chahal, Praveen Dubey, Lockie Ferguson, Harpreet Brar, Kuldeep Sen, Vijaykumar Vyshak, Yash Thakur.Gujarat, who ventured into the IPL in 2022, have met Punjab only five times in IPL history.

EXCLUSIVE | Shreyas Iyer and Yuzvendra Chahal key to Punjab Kings' hunt for maiden IPL title: Shashank Singh

'It was for all the supporters': Ishan Kishan on animated celebration after scoring hundred

NEW DELHI: Shreyas Iyer may have missed out on a well-deserved century, but his innings was met with admiration and applause from all corners. He remained unbeaten on 97 as he walked back, yet the smile on his face made it clear — his focus was on contributing to his new team, Punjab Kings , who have been chasing their maiden IPL title since the tournament began in 2008.At the end of the 19th over, Iyer stood at 97*, with Shashank Singh at the other end on 22 off 10 balls.Putting the team’s needs ahead of personal milestones, Iyer prioritised Punjab Kings' total over individual glory.Before the start of the final over, Iyer walked up to Shashank, who was striking the ball cleanly, and told him not to worry about his century but instead focus on maximising runs for the team.Shashank responded to his captain’s trust by smashing five boundaries off Mohammed Siraj ’s over, propelling Punjab Kings to an imposing 243/5 in 20 overs.After the innings, when asked about denying Iyer a century, Shashank said:""Yes, it was a good cameo. But looking at Shreyas, that motivated me even more. Let me be very honest — Shreyas, from ball one, said don’t worry about my hundred! Just watching the ball and reacting to it.""""I try and make sure I get the boundaries. When you bat at that number, it's likely that you won’t always get a good hit. I know the shots I can back.

Skip Bayless revisits Draymond Green’s criticism of the OKC Thunder

“Seven guys in the interview,”

“There’s a certain seriousness it takes to win in this league. And there’s a certain fear you have to instill in the team in order to win. I just don’t know if they’re instilling that fear in teams with all the bromance and stuff after the game.”

“I don’t know why not. Maybe because he doesn’t talk trash, he doesn’t cheap-shot anybody the way Draymond does — the all-time dirtiest player in the history of the league.”

A potential playoff showdown could settle the debate

“Maybe if that happens, Draymond’s teammates will be telling him in private, ‘Why did you have to say that about the Thunder?’”

USC Trojans' standout guard JuJu Watkins sustained a season-ending knee injury during the first quarter of the NCAA Tournament second-round game against Mississippi State on March 24, 2025. The injury occurred as Watkins drove to the basket, resulting in a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in her right knee. According to a statement from the basketball program, Watkins ""will undergo surgery and then begin rehabilitation shortly thereafter.""While driving to the basket on a fast break between two defenders, Watkins was fouled, causing her right knee to buckle as she planted her leg. She collapsed to the floor, immediately grasping her knee and remaining down for over a minute before being assisted off the court without putting weight on her injured leg.Prior to her exit, Watkins had recorded three points, two assists, and one rebound. USC head coach Lindsay Gottlieb commented after the team's 96-59 victory, ""This team rallied for her. Our fans had our back. I'm just really proud. ... It was a true team effort. I don't think I'll forget this night for a lot of reasons.""""I'd be lying if I told you that I wasn't rattled seeing JuJu on the court and crying,"" Gottlieb added.The basketball community has expressed widespread support for Watkins, with players, coaches, and fans sending well-wishes for her recovery. The Trojans remain focused on their upcoming matchup against Kansas State as they aim to advance further in the tournament.Despite Watkins' early exit, the Trojans secured a 96-59 victory over Mississippi State, advancing to the Sweet 16. They are scheduled to face the Kansas State Wildcats on Saturday,Watkins has been a pivotal player for USC, averaging 24.6 points, 7.1 rebounds, and 3.5 assists per game this season.

From Surat’s business lanes to the world stage

I had to travel to different cities or invite players home for practice Harmeet Desai

A new phase in life

'Middle-class athletes can thrive too'

NEW DELHI: Before COVID-19 brought the world to a standstill, ""Gully Boy"" hit the theatres. A musical drama, inspired by the real-life stories of rappers Divine and Naezy, delivered a soundtrack that soon became anthemic -- especially ""Apna Time Aayega"" (which translates to ""My time will come"").The phrase caught on so quickly that it evolved into a movement, making its way onto t-shirts, phone covers, and the vocabulary of every dreamer hustling toward success.For Commonwealth and Asian Games medallist Harmeet Desai , though, the expression carries a slight twist -- “Apna time agaya” (This is my time) -- as it proudly says on his WhatsApp status.""I believe that whatever time I am in now is my time -- good or bad. I don’t want to keep waiting for some future moment; I focus on the present,"" Harmeet told TimesofIndia.com during an exclusive interaction.Harmeet, who is part of the field for the WTT Star Contender Chennai from March 27 in the main draw, is coming off an intense training schedule -- first at SAI Bengaluru and then in Sweden's Karlstad.""For about 23 days, we practiced with all the training partners in Sweden. We had match practice, especially focusing on doubles. In Bengaluru, we were mostly playing amongst ourselves, but in Sweden, we got the opportunity to play against European players,"" he explains.""Bengaluru is at a higher altitude, so the ball tends to fly more. In Sweden, the conditions were slower because the location was near sea level. Cold weather slows things down, while heat speeds them up.""An avid reader of all genres, Harmeet has recently been diving into books on spirituality and stoicism -- philosophies that seem to complement his evolved approach to the sport.Harmeet's love story with the TT table began at the age of six, inspired by his father Rajul P Desai, who played the sport as a hobby.“My father bought a table tennis setup at home, and I got very excited about it. I started playing on my own, which led to serious practice,” he recalls.While a young Desai dabbled in multiple sports, including cricket, tennis, and badminton, it was table tennis that lit up his eyes.“I was fascinated by the spin and speed of TT,” he says.However, his hometown, Surat, lacked a strong sports culture, making it difficult to find good training partners and infrastructure.“When I started in Surat, there was no sports culture. The city was known for business, not sports. I had to travel to different cities or invite players home for practice,” he adds.In the absence of an active platform where he could observe other players play, his father played a crucial role, even recording Asian Championship matches on a handycam when Desai, busy with his exams, could analyse them later.Determined to improve, he trained in Ajmer at just eight years old and later moved to Sweden at 15 to gain high-level coaching.“Back then, India didn’t have the best infrastructure. Sweden gave me exposure, but being vegetarian made things tough,” he admits.Now, after 26 years in the sport, the 31-year-old, who is married to fellow TT player Krittwika Sinha Roy , has matured both as a player and a person.“Yes, marriage brought a different perspective. I’ve become more mature and balanced. Earlier, results affected me a lot, but now I focus more on the process. If I had this mindset 10 years ago, my results might have been even better,” he reflects.Recently, badminton coach Pullela Gopichand made headlines by stating that middle-class families should reconsider sports as a career choice . Harmeet, however, respectfully disagrees.“Many top athletes come from middle-class backgrounds. The sports infrastructure and support system in India have improved a lot in the last 15-20 years, though there’s still room for growth,"" he asserts. ""Saying that sports is only for the wealthy isn’t entirely correct.""Having represented India at the Paris 2024 Olympics, Harmeet, while acknowledging his 'dream' to play at the Olympics, also opened up about the less-than-ideal conditions at the Games last year.“Cleanliness wasn’t a major issue, but the heat was unbearable. There were no ACs in the rooms, and even the buses had no air conditioning. We weren’t allowed to open windows either, making travel extremely uncomfortable. The dining hall was overcrowded, and sometimes food would run out. Managing these things was definitely challenging,” he reveals.With Chennai as his immediate focus, Harmeet is also preparing for upcoming WTT tournaments in China and Slovenia.Beyond that, his sights are firmly set on the 2026 Asian Games and the 2028 Olympics, as he continues his journey with one mantra: A step at a time.ALSO READ: 'My parents didn't want another girl, they left me to die': First Indian to win UFC fight Puja Tomar | Exclusive","Harmeet Desai is part of the field for the WTT Star Contender Chennai from March 27 in the main draw.

"20km from Nalanda ruins, Bihar’s new sporting hub takes shape in Rajgir to create next-gen Olympic stars",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/a-sports-revolution-in-the-middle-of-bihar/articleshow/119513075.cms,"Not too far from the ancient academic complex at Nalanda, a new sports centre in

Rajgir

is driving the state’s bid to emerge as India’s next sporting powerhouse

23 different sports

A cricket stadium, too

What it’ll teach...

Goes beyond the game

Upcoming events

Once upon a time, Lord Buddha spent some time here, teaching. The first Buddhist council was also held here. And then, in the fifth century CE, possibly the world’s oldest residential university, Nalanda, came up here. The university flourished for seven centuries, and then was destroyed in the 12 century. Rajgir, about 100 km south of Patna, still remains a major draw for its many Buddhist attractions. But now, this ancient Buddhist university town has a new calling card.About 20 km away from the ruins of Nalanda, a new landmark looks all set to steal the spotlight from the ancient academic centre: a state-ofthe-art sports complex spread across 97.9 acres and built at a cost of about Rs 770 crore.Dedicated centres — like Haryana’s wrestling or boxing hubs, or Hyderabad’s badminton academies — have fuelled India’s sporting dreams and achievements in recent years and minted a new generation of sporting heroes. The hope is for the Rajgir Sports Complex to do the same for Bihar.Indian women’s hockey team coach Harendra Singh couldn’t hide his excitement when he saw the complex for the first time. He said it reminded him of the sports facilities in Colorado in the US. That he got a chance to coach his team in the state where he was born and took them to the Asian Champions Trophy title last year, beating China 1-0 in the final, made the venue and the vociferous crowds even more special.“I’ve always wanted to coach in Bihar. So, to get the opportunity finally here in Rajgir and that too with the national team at an international event was indeed a dream come true,” said the coach who was born in Chapra in Saran district.Once fully ready, the world-class sports complex will boast a roster of 23 diverse disciplines, cutting across indoor and outdoor sports. Most importantly, students and budding sportspersons will be able to reside and train at the academies. The first such batch came down towards the end of last year.For now, though, the focus is on successfully hosting the men’s Hockey Asia Cup, which is likely to be held in August and feature India and seven other teams, including Pakistan. The planning for the event has already started.“A second hockey pitch is being laid out in fast-track mode and will be completed in April. The hostels are getting air-conditioners to house the teams and we will also be constructing temporary galleries to hold more spectators,” said Raveendran Sankaran , director general-cumCEO of the Bihar State Sports Authority (BSSA).“Rajgir has got a re markable sports complex, including a state-of-the-art hockey arena. Surrounded by scenic hills, it is one of the most picturesque stadiums in the country,” said Hockey India president Dilip Tirkey, who is quite pleased with how the women’s Asian Champions Trophy was conducted. “It was also great to see the reception from fans at these venues with every game getting a packed house. That motivates players to go above and beyond to make fans happy with their performance,” he added.But the Sports Complex is about much more than just hosting big-ticket events.The most interesting facet of the centre in Rajgir is the sports university that it’ll house, which has already received recognition from the University Grants Commission (UGC). A unique facility, it’s expected to draw people who are interested in sports even if they might not play themselves.“We will be running courses on sports psychology, sports science, and sports nutrition. We will also launch development programmes for coaches and build strong sports science specialists,” said Sankaran , who also talks of using artificial intelligence (AI) to unearth talent in the state.But this launchpad for future sports stars has not ignored the region’s rich past. The main building of the complex pays tribute to the old Nalanda academy in its design and architecture, borrowing key elements. “The colour, design and even brickwork was based on the old Nalanda university. We took into account a salient feature of the old Nalanda university, which was air circulation to ensure that the temperature always remained at a particular level,” said Sankaran.Locals though are especially looking forward to the completion of the 45,000-seater cricket stadium that is being built inside the complex. The prospect of seeing the likes of Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma and Jasprit Bumrah in action only adding to the buzz around it.“The cricket stadium is 75% complete and being built according to BCCI standards. It will be inaugurated by June 2025,” Sankaran had said last year. “I believe that domestic matches will start after that. Hosting international matches will then depend on the schedule of the IPL and other international tournaments.”The general view is that Rajgir is ready to take its place on India’s sporting map. “Interest in sports will surely increase in the coming days, thanks to the sports facility in Rajgir.

Fans react to Tom Aspinall's statement

The war of words betweenandhas been making most of the MMA headlines lately. Fans have seen multiple instances when both fighters publicly mocked each other, directly or indirectly. Aspinall, who has won the interim belt as well as defended it, in a recent talk with Logan Paul, made his feelings clear about how he perceives the current situation of the Bones constantly turning down the talks of finalizing a date for the title unification bout . Aspinall’s statement has yet again garnered intense reactions from thecommunity. Some of them have even blamed UFC Presidentfor the delayed confirmation of the bout.The UFC President and CEO, Dana White, has cleared the air on who Tom Aspinall would possibly face next. Following that, the interim title holder constantly pushed for a fight with Jon Jones and has been waiting for confirmation since his last bout at UFC 304 against Curtis Blaydes. However, there has been no such response and instead, Chael Sonnen, the UFC veteran, stated that Jones has not been offered the fight yet.In a recent episode of Impaulsive, a podcast hosted by Logan Paul and Mike Majlak, Aspinall opened up about how he felt about his yet-to-be finalized bout against the Bones. The interim champion was asked if Jones was scared to face him, to which Aspinall immediately replied with a yes.“Absolutely, [Jones is scared to fight me]. I mean, the thing with Jon, Jon is conning the public, man... I'm not disputing that he's an amazing fighter.” Aspinall stated. “I think the fact that he didn't want to fight Ngannou for three years and now he's not wanting to fight me for over a year... The way he manipulates the media and the public is super smart. I'm not taking anything away from him. But do I think he's scared to take the tough fights at this stage in his career, absolutely.”Jones was last seen securing a win against Stipe Miocic at UFC 309.The statement by Aspinall has garnered an intense reaction from the fans, who have also held Dana White responsible for the delay in announcing the bout.One of the users wrote, “Jon jones is literally the GOAT, he isnt afraid of anyone in this planet lol”Another user wrote, “No one is scared to fight him. He’s just riding the hype train. John Jones has done this for decades.”“Tom just wants the belt and to be recognised as the best. Jon should either fight or just vacate, but if he does either way he loses”“Dana White must stop this shittery. Holding the division like that is outrageous.”Also read: Ronaldo Rodriguez reveals how ‘Never Back Down’ inspired his MMA career With the rise in intensity of the war of words between the two fighters, the fans are also demanding a quicker move in announcing a date for the potential bout.

NEW DELHI: Ashutosh Sharma is no longer just a prospect. In the Vizag heat on Monday, Sharma, clad in the navy blue of Delhi Capitals , stood tall amid a crumbling chase, his bat swinging through chaos and triumph. That’s when, you could say, he became a force.With an unbeaten 66 off 31 balls, he snatched victory from the jaws of defeat against Lucknow Super Giants, turning a near-certain loss into a thrilling one-wicket victory — a win that will echo through Indian Premier League IPL ) lore.It wasn’t just a match-winning knock. It was a statement. “He’s got confidence, raw power and the ability to impact games in minutes,” gushed DC mentor Kevin Pietersen after the match.Sharma made his IPL debut with the Punjab Kings last season and was picked by Delhi at the mega auction for Rs 3.8 crore. The investment looks like a steal.Last season, he made his name as an Impact Player, and along with Shashank Singh he helped Punjab pull off a couple of wins while chasing. Then there were some games where he offered glimpses of his talent – a 31 off 17 balls against Gujarat Titans, a 61 off 28 balls against Mumbai Indians — but those knocks ended in heartbreak with Punjab falling short.“I learned from last year. Missed out on finishing the game on a couple of occasions in the previous season. The whole year I focused and visualised it. Had the belief that if I play till the last over, anything can happen,” Ashutosh reflected after the Lucknow game on Monday.“Last year was really good, but that’s history for me. I have taken the positives from there and worked on myself to improve whatever weaknesses I had. I’m applying here what I did in domestic cricket,” he added.Against Lucknow, Sharma’s finishing ability shone through. From 113/6 in the 13th over, needing 97 off 45, he paced his innings masterfully. He absorbed pressure early, then exploded when it mattered. His 47 runs off the last 12 balls he faced being a testament to his nerve.When Kuldeep Yadav was run out in the penultimate over, leaving Delhi with one wicket, Ashutosh didn’t flinch. A six and a four off Prince Yadav brought the equation to six off six, and he closed it out with flair. It was Dhoni-esque – calm amid chaos and lethal when unleashed.Delhi captain Axar Patel couldn’t hide his awe. “The way he turned it around, it’s something special,” he said. “We were down and out, but Ashutosh made it happen.”His ability to read the game, rotate strike with tailenders and pick his moments for aggression marks him as a rare talent, a finisher who thrives when the odds are stacked against him. Sharma’s quick-scoring ability is his calling card.In T20s, his career strike-rate hovers around a staggering 184.50. He has to his credit the fastest fifty in T20 cricket by an Indian — an 11-ball effort against Arunachal Pradesh at the 2023 Syed Mushtaq Ali tournament.“I think about the shots I’ve practiced. If I connect one or two, I keep going,” Sharma underlined his mantra on Monday.From not being allowed on the cricket ground by a current IPL team coach once in his career to now being the hero of IPL 2025 ’s most dramatic run chase, Sharma has come a long way.Having battled depression at a young age when his career was at a crossroads, Sharma can now embark on a career to become the next big ‘chasemaster’.","Ashutosh Sharma scored 66 off 31 balls as Delhi Capitals beat Lucknow Super Giants. Sharma made his IPL debut with the Punjab Kings last season and was picked by Delhi at the mega auction for Rs 3.8 crore. “He’s got confidence, raw power and the ability to impact games in minutes,” gushed Kevin Pietersen.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119512714,imgsize-36958,width-400,resizemode-4/119512714.jpg"

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

He further added, "" IPL should just replace bowlers with bowling-machines.""The IPL 2025 season, the 18th edition of the tournament, commenced on March 22 and is scheduled to conclude on May 25.

AHMEDABAD: In a battle of ‘Impact Players,’ Punjab Kings ’ Vijaykumar Vyshak bowled two tight overs, denying Gujarat Titans’ Sherfane Rutherford the ideal length to extend his arms, while left-arm pacer Marco Jansen dismissed Jos Buttler (54 off 33 balls) in the 18th over to derail Titans’ spirited chase of 244 and help the visitors claim an 11-run win here on Tuesday.The hero of the day was Punjab captain Shreyas Iyer (97* off 42 balls), who led from the front with a belligerent unbeaten knock as the visitors posted 243/5. Iyer was ably supported by meaningful contributions from middle-order batter Shashank Singh (44* off 16 balls) and opener Priyansh Arya (47 off 23 balls) as the Kings commenced their quest for a maiden IPL title by posting a huge total.Titans' captain Shubman Gill and Sai Sudharsan (74 off 41 balls) subsequently got the hosts off to a swift 61-run opening stand before Gill was dismissed. Buttler and Sudharsan then added 84 runs in 40 balls to put the Titans back on track.After Sudharsan’s dismissal, Rutherford smashed 18 off his first seven balls to reduce the target to 75 off 36 balls. Vyshak, though, despite bowling wides, bowled fast and outside off to stymie Rutherford. The West Indian batter’s inability to rotate the strike also increased the pressure on Buttler, who was bowled by Jansen.Left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh castled Rutherford (46 off 28 balls) in the last over to seal Gujarat’s fate.Earlier, when Punjab batted, southpaw Priyansh Arya gave ample demonstration of the potential he holds at this level with a chancy yet breezy knock. Iyer came in early, after the dismissal of Prabhsimran Singh, who was caught at third man by Arshad Khan off Kagiso Rabada’s bowling.Arya, meanwhile, flicked Mohammed Siraj over deep square leg for a six before smashing a flurry of boundaries off left-arm pacer Arshad Khan’s bowling in the fifth over. Leg-spinner Rashid Khan ended Arya’s knock after the latter scooped a delivery to Sai Sudharsan at cover.His dismissal brought in former Titan Azmatullah Omarzai, who greeted Khan with a six straight over his head.Marcus Stoinis and Iyer added 57 for the fifth wicket before a reverse sweep led to Stoinis’s downfall. Thereafter, it was the Shashank-Iyer show. The duo clobbered 87 runs off the last five overs to take the Kings to the highest total scored on this ground.Iyer’s strong start to the season is good news for the batter and for Punjab. His reunion with coach Ricky Ponting at the franchise might just galvanise the outfit into providing stronger and more consistent performances this season, something they have lacked at crunch times in recent seasons.",Punjab Kings beat Gujarat Titans by 11 runs. Shreyas Iyer top scored with 97 not out. Shashank Singh (44) and Priyansh Arya (47) also made centuries. Gujarat were bowled out for 244 in their 50 overs.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119510829,imgsize-41636,width-400,resizemode-4/119510829.jpg"

GUWAHATI: Having found themselves in a similar situation after suffering defeats in their respective opening matches, it will be interesting to see which team feels more at home here on Wednesday as Rajasthan Royals (RR) take on Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) at the Assam Cricket Association Stadium.While the Knights suffered a seven-wicket loss to Royal Challengers Bengaluru at home, the Royals went down to Sunrisers Hyderabad by 44 runs. Though it’s too early to be worried at the start of such a long season, both sides will be hoping to turn things around at the earliest.“It’s always good to win the first game, but there are some lessons to be learnt from there. We could have capitalised (on the start); we could have got more runs, but we lost wickets towards the end of the innings. Whatever you do, there is always an opportunity to bowl better,” KKR bowling coach Bharat Arun said on Tuesday.Though the Knights are the away team here, the former India bowling coach is hoping to get some home comfort over the Royals. The Jaipur-based franchise uses the Barsapara stadium as their second home ground in addition to their base at Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur.“Guwahati is a short distance from Kolkata, (many people) speak the same language here, so it’s a second home for us,” Arun said with a cheeky smile. But Riyan Parag, the Royals' skipper for the first three games, begged to differ.“I’m not sure how many Bengalis are there in KKR (there are none), but being an Assamese I hope I’ll get more support over here,” the 23-year-old Parag said.Both sides must make some corrections if they want to come back to winning ways.Rajasthan’s bowlers gave away too many runs to the Hyderabad batters, led by Ishan Kishan — who scored a ton — and opener Travis Head. The Knights, on the other hand, will hope that Rinku comes back into the groove and Varun Chakravarthy weaves a web with his mystery spin.","Rajasthan Royals take on Kolkata Knight Riders at Assam Cricket Association Stadium.

LSG in IPL 2025: Rishabh Pant to lead Lucknow Super Giants in bid for first title

In a thrilling IPL 2025 match in Visakhapatnam, Lucknow Super Giants captain Rishabh Pant remained composed about a crucial missed stumping opportunity against Delhi Capitals .Ashutosh Sharma emerged as DC's hero with an unbeaten 66, leading his team to victory when the odds were against them. In the final over, with six runs needed from six balls, Pant chose Shahbaz Ahmed to bowl.The first ball of the final over saw Mohit Sharma step down the track and miss, with Pant failing to complete the stumping. Although Pant opted for a DRS review for LBW, the ball was shown to have missed the stumps.Mohit managed a single, bringing Ashutosh on strike. The 26-year-old then sealed the match with a six over Shahbaz's head, securing a one-wicket victory for Delhi Capitals.""Definitely, luck plays a part in this game, and if it could have missed his (Mohit Sharma's) pads, it was a chance for stumping. But these things happen in the game of cricket. You can't focus on these things, but rather, you need to play better cricket.""After winning the toss and choosing to field, DC faced a strong batting display from LSG. Mitchell Marsh scored 72 while Nicholas Pooran contributed 75, helping their team post a total above 200 runs.""I think our top-order batters played really well, and I think it was a pretty good score on this wicket. As a team, we are looking to take positives from every match, and as a team, we are looking to learn from it (every match.) The more basics we do right, the more it is going to be better for us in the future. We got early wickets, but we knew it was a good wicket to bat on. We had to keep doing the basics right more often than not.""DC's chase began poorly as they struggled at 65/5 in the seventh over. However, several crucial partnerships turned the game around.The partnerships included a 55-run stand between Ashutosh and Vipraj Nigam (39), 45 runs between Tristan Stubbs and Ashutosh, and 43 runs between Axar Patel and Faf du Plessis.""I think they had a couple of good partnerships. One with Stubbs, one with Ashutosh and one with one other guy (Vipraj Nigam.) I think he (Nigam) did a pretty good job and took the game away from us. There was enough for the bowlers, but I think we could have done the basics right. We felt the pressure, we are still settling in, but a lot of positives to take from this match.""",Delhi Capitals beat Lucknow Super Giants by one wicket in IPL 2025 match.

IPL: How will GT, LSG, DC, PBKS, RR fare? Greenstone Lobo predicts

Lucknow Super Giants owner Sanjiv Goenka met with Rishabh Pant for a discussion following Lucknow Super Giants' defeat to Delhi Capitals in their IPL 2025 opening match. Goenka-owned LSG had acquired Pant for a record sum of Rs 27 crore during the mega auction.LSG had DC struggling at 113 for six while defending 210 runs but couldn't secure the victory. Ashutosh Sharma's outstanding performance of 66 not out from 31 balls guided DC to victory with one wicket and three balls remaining in Visakhapatnam.Pant's debut as LSG captain was underwhelming across all aspects of the game. He scored a duck from six balls, falling to Kuldeep Yadav, in a high-scoring match where five batters achieved strike rates above 200.His leadership decisions were questioned, particularly regarding Shardul Thakur's limited use. Despite taking two wickets in his first over, Thakur only bowled two overs in total.With 22 runs needed from the final two overs, Pant chose inexperienced Prince Yadav over Shardul. Prince conceded 16 runs, including two fours and a six.In the last over, with just a run per ball required, Pant opted for left-arm spinner Shahbaz Ahmed instead of the experienced Shardul, who has previously secured victories for India in similar situations.A crucial stumping opportunity was missed by Pant in the final over. Though Shahbaz beat Mohit Sharma with an excellent delivery, Pant failed to collect the ball after it deflected off Mohit's back pad.""Definitely luck plays a part in this game and if it could have missed his (Mohit Sharma's) pads, it was a chance for stumping. But these things happen in the game of cricket, you can't focus on these things, but rather you need to play better cricket,"" Pant stated during the post-match presentation.Following the match, Goenka seemingly had a conversation with Pant and coach Justin Langer. While less intense than his previous discussion with former captain KL Rahul in IPL 2024, it served as a subtle reminder for Pant to improve his performance.Delhi's chase began poorly at 7-3 in the second over. The situation worsened when they lost five wickets for 65 runs, including Faf du Plessis who scored 29 in his first match for the team.DC captain Axar Patel contributed 22 runs quickly, while Tristan Stubbs added 34 to the chase.",Lucknow Super Giants owner Sanjiv Goenka met with Rishabh Pant following their defeat to Delhi Capitals in their IPL 2025 opening match.

'It was for all the supporters': Ishan Kishan on animated celebration after scoring hundred

NEW DELHI: Ashutosh Sharma stood firm, kept his composure, and unleashed his batting firepower when it mattered the most, guiding Delhi Capitals to a thrilling last-over victory against Lucknow Super Giants in their IPL 2025 opener at the Dr. Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy ACA-VDCA Cricket Stadium in Visakhapatnam.The young batter roared in celebration, swinging his bat and gesturing animatedly toward the Delhi Capitals dugout after sealing a breathtaking chase.Ashutosh was the hero of the night, smashing an unbeaten 66 off just 31 balls, rescuing his side from the brink of defeat and steering them to a stunning one-wicket win.Earlier, Lucknow Super Giants put up a formidable total of 209/8 in 20 overs, powered by Mitchell Marsh ’s explosive 72 off 36 balls and Nicholas Pooran ’s blistering 75 off 30. Despite their efforts, LSG couldn't keep Ashutosh from scripting a memorable turnaround.Delhi Capitals’ chase got off to a nightmare start as they crumbled to 7/3 within two overs, with Shardul Thakur and Manimaran Siddharth wreaking havoc. Jake Fraser-McGurk, Abishek Porel, and Sameer Rizvi fell cheaply, putting DC on the back foot.Captain Axar Patel (22 off 11) and Faf du Plessis (29 off 18) tried to rebuild, but DC still found themselves struggling at 113/6 in the 13th over, requiring 97 runs off just 45 balls.That’s when Ashutosh turned the game on its head.Displaying a perfect balance of composure and controlled aggression, he took on the LSG bowlers fearlessly, dispatching five boundaries and five towering sixes. His calculated counterattack kept DC alive in the chase.Vipraj Nigam provided vital support with a quickfire 39 off 15 balls, building a game-changing partnership with Ashutosh that reignited Delhi’s hopes.With 18 runs needed off the last two overs, Ashutosh kept his nerve, expertly maneuvering the strike and punishing loose deliveries. Despite losing Kuldeep Yadav in the penultimate over, he remained unfazed.Then, with just a few runs required, Ashutosh finished things off in style—launching a stunning straight six off the third ball of the final over, sealing an unforgettable win for Delhi Capitals and etching his name as the hero of the night.","Delhi Capitals beat Lucknow Super Giants by one wicket in their IPL 2025 opener.

The gesture, reflecting his humility and gratitude, took place in the MI dressing room following the team's defeat to Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in their IPL 2025 season opener.Chasing a modest target of 156, CSK were cruising despite the early dismissal of opener Rahul Tripathi in the second over. Skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad and Rachin Ravindra stitched a quickfire 67-run partnership off just 6.1 overs, with Gaikwad notching up his fastest IPL fifty in just 22 balls.However, Vignesh Puthur, making his IPL debut, turned the game on its head with a sensational spell.

Vignesh finished with impressive figures of 3 for 32 in his four-over spell.Though CSK ultimately secured victory with five balls to spare and four wickets in hand, thanks to Rachin Ravindra's match-winning knock of 65 not out from 45 balls, Vignesh's valiant effort became the talking point.WATCH:After receiving MI's 'Best Bowler' award from Nita Ambani, Vignesh humbly expressed his gratitude, saying, ""I want to thank the MI franchise for giving me the opportunity to play the match.

NEW DELHI: Ishan Kishan was in beast mode on Sunday, lighting up the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad with a blistering 106* off just 47 balls. His explosive knock powered Sunrisers Hyderabad to a commanding 44-run victory over Rajasthan Royals.However, Kishan’s journey to this moment is even more compelling than his stunning century on debut for Sunrisers Hyderabad in the IPL.Around this time last year, he was dropped from the BCCI’s central contracts, with selectors and top officials believing he wasn’t prioritising red-ball cricket.Once regarded as one of India’s top three wicketkeeper-batters alongside Rishabh Pant and Sanju Samson, Kishan found himself on the sidelines, left to reflect and rebuild.But on Sunday, in the vibrant Orange jersey, he let his bat do the talking. His unbeaten 47-ball innings, laced with 11 boundaries and six sixes, was a statement of intent.As he reached his century, Kishan, who was bought for Rs 11.25 crore at the auction, celebratory roar sent a clear message—he was back.Former England captain Michael Vaughan believes Kishan’s fiery celebration was directed at India’s selectors and captain Rohit Sharma “Kishan’s celebration for three figures today, that was a celebration maybe (aimed) for Mumbai, maybe to the chairman of selectors, maybe to Rohit Sharma, maybe to the whole of India, maybe to the whole of the world, just to say, ‘Look I’m a decent player’,"" Vaughan told Cricbuzz.""He’s a wonderfully balanced player, with the break of the wrist to just flick the ball. He’s got that great shot on the onside with anything short. I’d love to be the chairman of selectors for India. I mean, the selection meetings would be long because you’ve got so many players to talk about and you’d be a naughty step as a selector because you’re saying to someone ‘sorry, you’re not even in the top five at the minute’,"" he said.""The talent pool in Indian cricket is monstrous and the only way that you can get in, the only way that you can push yourself into that set-up is by doing remarkable things. I think of all the formats to get a century in, T20 cricket is the hardest format to get in,” Vaughan said.After a dominant win against Rajasthan Royals, Sunrisers Hyderabad will next face Lucknow Super Giants on Thursday at the same venue.",Ishan Kishan scored 106 off just 47 balls in Sunrisers Hyderabad's IPL win. The wicketkeeper-batsman was dropped by the BCCI around this time last year. Michael Vaughan believes the celebration was directed at India's selectors and captain Rohit Sharma.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119419548,imgsize-54814,width-400,resizemode-4/119419548.jpg"
