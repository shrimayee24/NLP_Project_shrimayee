Gisele Bündchen gets emotional while describing her divorce as “the death of my dream”

Gisele Bündchen defends Tom Brady, dismisses media speculation over football’s role in the split

A quiet love story and learning to live without apology

In March 2024, Gisele Bündchen gave fans an emotionally raw glimpse into her post-divorce life during a heartfelt sitdown with Robin Roberts, reflecting on the end of her 13-year marriage to NFL icon Tom Brady. As part of the IMPACT x Nightline special Climbing the Mountain, the supermodel's tearful moment caught headlines—but beyond the emotion was a message of resilience, healing, and self-discovery.Gisele Bündchen, now 44, opened up about what she once described as “the death of my dream.” When Roberts gently revisited the quote, asking how she was coping more than a year after the split was finalized, Gisele struggled to answer before turning away and softly requesting, “Can I have a little moment?”That vulnerable pause wasn’t scripted—it was the real-time unfolding of a woman still navigating the aftershocks of letting go of a once-idealized life. And it struck a chord with fans who had watched her grace red carpets and Super Bowl stands by Brady’s side for over a decade.Following their October 2022 divorce, media speculation had pointed fingers at Tom Brady’s return to football as a key factor. But Gisele Bündchen strongly rejected that narrative in a Vanity Fair interview: “It’s the craziest thing I’ve ever heard.”Bündchen continued, “Listen, I have always cheered for him, and I would continue forever.”Despite the pain of separation, her sentiments toward Brady remained grounded in mutual respect. “If there’s one person I want to be the happiest in the world, it’s him, believe me,” she said. “I want him to achieve and to conquer. I want all his dreams to come true.”The interview at that time also hinted at Gisele Bündchen’s future—with herself and possibly with someone new. When asked if she was ready to love again, she replied with serene confidence: “Where my heart is now is where I am right now. I’m living my truth, and I’m not apologizing for it.”Behind the scenes, Bündchen had reportedly grown close to Joaquim Valente, her children’s jiu-jitsu instructor, though the relationship started as a friendship. “They’re taking it slow,” a source said at the time, noting how Valente had been a steady source of comfort during her transition.Also Read: “She is secure and happy”: Gisele Bündchen thrived after dumping Tom Brady—was the NFL legend the real problem?

Solo Sikoa defeats Jimmy Uso by pinfall.

The United States Championship belt is up for grabs once more as Jimmy Uso comes for the title, this time with Solo Sikoa defending. Sikoa won the United States Championship title from Jacob Fatu after defeating him at the WWE Night of Champions. Now the two brothers are facing each other after an already heated match on SmackDown on July 11, when a minute distraction caused Sikoa to lose the match against Jimmy during their tag team bout. After losing against Jimmy Uso and LA Knight, Sikoa was even more inclined to lay it down on his brother, and the match was exciting to say the least.

After yesterday's fight on SmackDown, everyone is looking forward to the big match. This is Jimmy's first-ever singles match for a championship in WWE , and Solo's first-ever defense of a title. Things started out hot, with both of the wrestlers coming in hot. Jimmy almost won after jumping on Solo from the top rope, but his opponent managed to kick him off right on time.Jimmy Uso had the upper hand for most of the match, and though Sikoa tried to change the tide a couple of times, Uso was able to bring things back on track. Unfortunately, the MFT, or specifically Talla Tonga, became the reason for his defeat. Just when it seemed like Solo was going to lose, he managed to change the whole scenario. Jimmy did a corkscrew off the top onto the entire group, but Talla Tonga came in with a distraction. While Big Jim was trying to pile on the other, Solo uses this reprieve to roll Jimmy up, and Talla Tonga helped him by using his legs to keep Solo in place to take the win.Things don't end there, as Jacob Fatu makes an entrance while the MFT are taking it out on Uso. Solo had him down with a Samoan Spike, but Fatu came in to shake things up. While it's not the Bloodline, a shift is incoming, and fans are waiting to see how things turn out.Also Read: Is Roman Reigns set for a surprise return?

Friendship on ice: Taylor Swift and Blake Lively ’s once-close bond crumbles

Blake Lively reportedly blames Justin Baldoni—and has a new strategy

It seems not even Taylor Swift ’s most cherished friendships are safe from Hollywood drama. According to insiders, the pop icon has gone radio silent on her longtime best friend Blake Lively—and the catalyst may be actor-director Justin Baldoni. But with Swift’s focus shifting more toward Travis Kelce and her carefully curated inner circle, fans are questioning if the rift is beyond repair...For years, Blake Lively was part of Taylor Swift’s elite inner circle—frequently appearing in behind-the-scenes snaps, attending birthday parties, and even lending her children’s names to Swift’s music. But sources say the two haven't been on speaking terms since Lively’s connection to Baldoni’s It Ends With Us legal drama unexpectedly dragged Swift into the spotlight.“After months of radio silence, Blake has stopped trying to reach out,” one insider revealed. “There is no recovering from this. Their friendship is done.”Fans quickly noticed the silence when Blake Lively failed to like or acknowledge Taylor Swift’s celebratory post about reclaiming her music rights—a moment typically met with enthusiastic support from her tight-knit group. Swift, known for being fiercely loyal, apparently took Blake’s perceived alignment with Baldoni personally.Behind the scenes, Blake Lively is said to be frustrated that her public image took a hit due to Baldoni’s legal team’s aggressive tactics. “Blake’s image took a huge hit with all the mud that Justin and his legal team threw at her, she lost her best friend,” a source explained.And now, with Swift's world increasingly dominated by her high-profile romance with NFL star Travis Kelce, it’s clear who has her attention these days. The tight end has become a steady presence in Swift’s whirlwind life, traveling across continents to be by her side. Some insiders believe Swift has re-centered her personal world, pushing out friendships that no longer serve or align with her evolving brand.Still, Blake Lively reportedly isn’t staying quiet. “She’s also looking to build up more high-profile bonds so she can show Taylor she is still a Hollywood heavyweight—and part of that is bitter,” another source added.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s masters win went viral with Jack Antonoff and her cat Meredith—but Travis Kelce quietly made it unforgettable As Swift gears up for another leg of the Eras Tour and Kelce preps for his next NFL season, one thing is certain: there may no longer be space in their storybook romance for past dragons.","Taylor Swift and Blake Lively's friendship appears to have fractured.

Goldberg's chants filled the arena in Atlanta, Georgia, by his beloved fans who gathered to watch the WWE legend one last time in the ring.The match began with the WWE Hall of Famer pushing off Gunther, who tried to lock in chops. The Ring General attacked him with two thudding chest chops, but Goldberg felt nothing as he took down the Champion with a brutal clothesline. Following this, Goldberg went for a spear, but the Champion ducked tactfully, causing him to go crashing through the barricade.Gunther next targeted Goldberg’s left knee, which everyone knew as his weak point for the seasoned wrestler. Even though he faced a tough start, Goldberg managed to break free and executed a powerful back body drop, shifting the momentum in his favor.However, out of nowhere, disaster struck when Goldberg accidentally speared the referee, bringing the match to a sudden halt. Actually. Goldberg went for the spear, but Gunther managed to duck again, and this time it's referee, Charles Robinson, fell into the deadly spear.Seizing this opportunity, Gunther capitalized again, removing the knee brace and flaunting it in front of the fans.

Just then, another referee rushed into the ring as the legend went for the pin, but Gunther managed to kick out just in time.In the final attempt, The Ring General locked in the sleeper on Goldberg, who tried very hard to fight back, but could not break himself out of the hold.

LeBron James intrigued by the Los Angeles Lakers ' futuristic vision as trade season whispers grow louder



In the midst of swirling trade speculation and mounting questions about his future in Los Angeles, LeBron James ' longtime agent, Rich Paul , has finally addressed the rumors head-on. As the Lakers pivot toward a future built around Luka Doncic and new acquisitions like Deandre Ayton, James is reportedly taking a step back to evaluate where he fits into the franchise’s evolving blueprint. With just one season remaining on his contract, the four-time NBA champion finds himself at a career crossroads, and the tension between legacy and change is more real than ever.As the Los Angeles Lakers reshape their roster with an eye toward the next decade, LeBron James is facing the most uncertain offseason of his legacy-enriched career. While the addition of Luka Doncic has sparked hope for a bright future in Los Angeles, it’s also led to speculation that the franchise may be preparing for life after LeBron.In a revealing report by ESPN’s Shams Charania, James is said to believe the Lakers ""are more in a futuristic mindset,” adding that “some hard conversations will need to happen.” Though James recently picked up his $52.6 million player option for the 2025-26 season, the decision appears more about flexibility than finality.Speaking to Charania, Rich Paul commented on where James and his team stand amid the speculation.""We understand the difficulty in winning now while preparing for the future,"" Paul said. ""We do want to evaluate what's best for LeBron at this stage in his life and career. He wants to make every season he has left count, and the Lakers understand that, are supportive and want what's best for him.""Despite averaging 24.4 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 8.2 assists last season, James and the Lakers were bounced in the first round of the playoffs for the second straight year. As front office executives Rob Pelinka and JJ Redick reshape the roster around Doncic, James has remained notably quiet.The silence has only amplified speculation. According to ESPN’s Brian Windhorst, one Eastern Conference executive is ""convinced James wanted out of LA,” with teams like the Golden State Warriors actively exploring trade packages. A potential blockbuster deal could even include both LeBron and Bronny James heading to the Bay Area in exchange for young assets like Jonathan Kuminga and Moses Moody.Meanwhile, former teammate Udonis Haslem added fuel to the fire on ESPN’s NBA Today, joking about James joining Stephen Curry. “If chef cooking up something, I’m showing up for dinner. For sure. That’s for damn sure. If chef cooking, I’m showing.""Also Read: LeBron James' Final Act? Lakers Set the Stage for a Legendary Hollywood Farewell in 2026Whether James ultimately stays or joins forces with Curry for one last title push, James is all up for retaining his legacy and retiring like a king in his potentially final season.

But as Rich Paul bluntly said on ESPN, James “values a realistic chance of winning it all.”And if the Lakers can’t offer that, the King may be ready to move on.","LeBron James is reportedly taking a step back to evaluate where he fits into the Los Angeles Lakers' evolving blueprint.

After leading the Florida Panthers to back-to-back Stanley Cup championships, Matthew Tkachuk is in no mood to show mercy. When asked if he felt bad for Connor McDavid and the Edmonton Oilers, Tkachuk dismissed the suggestion outright.He pointed out that no one offered the Panthers sympathy when they lost in 2023 despite their injuries. Now, with two Cups in hand, Tkachuk isn’t about to soften his edge, especially not for a rival team.The Panthers and Oilers have built a fierce rivalry over the past two seasons, and Tkachuk’s latest remarks have only intensified it. Despite the Panthers having the upper hand with two straight Finals wins, the tension shows no signs of cooling.Tkachuk, a former Calgary Flames forward, has a long history with the Oilers, and his latest comments reflect a personal edge that keeps this rivalry burning.According to Tkachuk, fans from Western Canada have been hoping for a break for the Edmonton Oilers. But his message was clear: the Stanley Cup isn’t something to be handed out for pity. His competitive mindset has no room for emotional appeals.His time in Calgary made him all too familiar with Edmonton’s hunger for a Cup and even more determined to deny it.While the Panthers celebrate, Connor McDavid and the Oilers are left facing another tough offseason. Despite elite talent and deep playoff runs, they’ve fallen short once again.T kachuk’s cold reaction is likely to sting, but it may also fire up McDavid and his teammates heading into next year. The Oilers are still chasing their first championship in the McDavid era, and the Panthers are standing firmly in the way.Tkachuk has drawn a clear line in the sand: there are no handouts at the top. And with the Panthers now firmly established as the team to beat, don’t expect this rivalry, or Tkachuk’s sharp edge, to disappear anytime soon.Matthew Tkachuk shows no sympathy for the Oilers after leading the Florida Panthers to back-to-back Stanley Cup wins, and his fierce stance reflects a rivalry that’s only getting hotter.Also Read: Former NHL enforcer Nick Tarnasky destroys drunk man in wild viral golf course brawl",Matthew Tkachuk has led the Florida Panthers to back-to-back Stanley Cup wins.

Jimmy then launched himself off the ropes to take out Talla, Loa, and Mateo at ringside. As the referee began the ten-count, both competitors made it back to the ring. Jimmy landed a stiff kick to Talla, but Sikoa capitalized, rolling Jimmy up for the pin while Talla held him down from the outside, sealing the controversial win.The action kicked off with LA Knight launching a series of strikes in an attempt to take down Rollins.

Definitely, Roman Reigns has to be in that conversation. Would it make sense to come back and have Roman with Big Jim, with Jacob and Jey? You follow me? You know, maybe there's a new Wiseman there with the [OG] Bloodline. There's something people, you know, just—they've been waiting; they've been asking, and, you know what I mean, for me, I was, like, you know, I was like, to give the fans what they want. ”Adding Rikishi as Wiseman would give the Bloodline a fresh voice and a wealth of experience.

What This Means for All Sides

For the Lakers

For the Heat

For the Hawks

A bold three-team trade proposal is making waves in the NBA world, with a potential deal that would sendback to Miami while bringing. As speculation around James’ future with the Lakers continues to build, this hypothetical trade scenario could mark a dramatic shift in the NBA landscape.The trade, pitched by Sports Illustrated’s Jackson Caudell, involves the Lakers, Miami Heat , and Atlanta Hawks. Here’s how the deal would break down:The Lakers would part ways with their franchise cornerstone but gain a combination of youth, defensive talent, and a valuable future draft pick.Trading LeBron James would undoubtedly be a seismic move for the Lakers, but the return package aims to soften the blow. Wiggins, a former No. 1 pick, is under contract through the 2026–27 season on a four-year, $110 million deal, offering Los Angeles a controllable asset with All-Star experience. The addition of Terry Rozier, Highsmith, and Jaquez Jr. adds depth, defense, and potential upside to a roster in transition.“Wiggins would fit nicely alongside Doncic and Reeves, and could even be brought back if things go well this season,” Caudell noted in his July 12, 2025 piece for Sports Illustrated.“Highsmith is a really good defender and might be the top perimeter defender on the Lakers instantly.”Jaquez Jr. could benefit from a fresh start under new Lakers coach JJ Redick, while Rozier, in the final year of his contract, might offer short-term scoring punch or become a trade asset before the deadline.Signs have been pointing to a potential breakup between LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers . After the franchise declined to offer him a contract extension, it became clear the organization is preparing for a future without the four-time MVP. ESPN’s Brian Windhorst and Ramona Shelburne reported that the Lakers have “a planned end date” for James, whose current contract runs through the 2025–26 season.“Paul also had to formally inform the Lakers that LeBron James intended to pick up the final year of his contract after the team did not engage in any substantial discussions about extending him by a year or two,” Windhorst and Shelburne wrote in their June 11 article for ESPN. They added, “It was abundantly clear that the 21-time All-Star’s time as the face of the Lakers had, for the first time, a planned end date, even if James’ record-setting NBA career did not yet. ”In this proposed trade, James would make a high-profile return to Miami, where he won two NBA championships and cemented his legacy as one of the game’s greatest. Joining the Heat alongside Maxi Kleber and Vit Krejci, James could potentially chase one last ring in a familiar environment.The Hawks, meanwhile, receive Gabe Vincent as compensation for facilitating the deal. While not a star piece, Vincent could bolster Atlanta’s backcourt rotation and bring veteran playoff experience to a young roster.- Marks a clear turning of the page from the LeBron era- Brings in a younger core with upside- Adds a future unprotected first-round pick for long-term planning- Reunites James with his former franchise- Signals a win-now mentality with championship aspirations- Acquires a useful guard in Gabe Vincent- Plays a pivotal role in one of the league’s biggest trades of the decadeAlso read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors could sign $52.6 million Los Angeles Lakers star to form power duo with Stephen Curry and bolster championship odds As NBA free agency and trade talks continue heating up, this proposal might not be imminent—but it offers a fascinating glimpse into how teams are preparing for life after LeBron, and how his legacy continues to influence the balance of power in the league.","A three-team trade proposal is making waves in the NBA world, with a potential deal that would send LeBron James back to Miami.

In his co-main event outing against LA Knight at Saturday Night’s Main Event, ‘The Visionary’ suffered a legitimate knee injury while performing a routine Lionsault off the second rope.To avoid disaster, Knight moved out of the way. Rollins then landed awkwardly on his feet and, in turn, seemed to buckle his knee. The former Universal Champion immediately winced in pain and dragged himself to the corner of the ring while clutching it.At first, it seemed to be a method of deception from ‘The Architect,’ but just moments later, it was clear that Rollins was in legitimate pain. The Money in the Bank holder talked to the ringside doctor, Paul Heyman, with the referee trying to separate Knight from Rollins. Just moments later, Rollins tried to get up on his feet but was immediately planted with a BFT for Knight to pick up the win.This was an impromptu and early finish to the match as the cameras panned to commentators Michael Cole and Wade Barrett, who informed the fans that Rollins was indeed in trouble. During the commercial break, Rollins was assisted by the medical staff and escorted to the backstage area.For the unversed, Rollins already has had issues with his right knee as he tore his ACL, MCL, and meniscus back in November 2015 at a house show in Dublin and had to miss WrestleMania 32 due to the injury.In the latest update, Fightful Select reported that the injury scare was indeed legitimate and “it had at least not been planned for by medical personnel.” Moreover, original plans for the match had Rollins going over Knight, but plans were changed owing to the situation. Another insider wrestling account, WrestleVotes, stated that “the sense from a source just now is the Seth Rollins injury is legit.”This unfortunate incident occurred at a time when Rollins is primed to be the top heel on Raw and was expected to capture the World title in the next few months. Moreover, his alliance with Paul Heyman, Bron Breakker, and Bronson Reed was starting to pay dividends, with the faction garnering positive fan reactions from the WWE Universe.

Kevin Durant becomes a Houston Rocket after NBA approves first ever seven team trade

Kevin Durant has stepped onto a fresh court in Houston, and his ambitions are more than just adding to his ring collection. Fresh from a huge seven-team trade, Durant revealed something interesting on the Mind the Game podcast with LeBron James and Steve Nash—he's not done yet. With 18 seasons under his belt, packed with MVPs, Finals wins, and 30,000 career points, The Slim Reaper is aiming to push his legacy to an extraordinary 20 NBA seasons. This alone has the basketball world intrigued.Kevin Durant officially became a member of the Houston Rockets when the NBA sanctioned the league's inaugural seven-team trade on July 6, 2025. The trade involved 13 players and a bunch of draft picks, some stretching all the way to 2032, among Phoenix, Atlanta, Brooklyn, Golden State, Minnesota, the Lakers, and Houston. Houston sent Jalen Green, Dillon Brooks, a variety of picks, and cap space to the Suns, while also reacquiring Clint Capela from Atlanta through a sign-and-trade.With Durant on board, the Rockets' youthful core, featuring Alperen Şengün, Amen Thompson, Jabari Smith Jr., Fred VanVleet, Steven Adams, Dorian Finney-Smith, and the returning Capela, gets even stronger. At 36 years old (born September 29, 1988), this 15-time All-Star and four-time scoring leader is joining a team fresh off a solid playoff run, now ready with a proven scorer to elevate their title hopes.In a frank discussion on Mind the Game, Durant shared that he’s not looking to add more trophies to his collection. His true goal is to play in the league for 20 years—a promise he refers to as ""a contract you’ve got to have with yourself.""Durant surpassed the 30,000 career points milestone and joined an elite club of eight NBA players to score more than 30,000 points. With two MVP awards, two Finals MVPs, four scoring titles, and four Olympic gold medals already under his belt, KD is now focusing on achieving a unique level of longevity in his professional career.Kevin Durant’s incredible switch to the Houston Rockets didn’t merely disrupt team rosters, it emphasized a personal ambition that few athletes dare to pursue: playing a complete 20 seasons.

Lakers’ Dilemma: Keep or Trade?

Knicks’ Cap Flexibility and Strategic Planning

A compelling NBA trade scenario is turning heads as speculation intensifies aroundsuperstarpotentially heading to the New York Knicks. Proposed by Dan Favale of Bleacher Report, the hypothetical swap would send Karl-Anthony Towns to Los Angeles in exchange for the four-time NBA champion.In a straight one-for-one trade that fits under the current collective bargaining agreement, Towns’ $53.1 million salary matches closely with LeBron James ’ $52.6 million for the 2025-26 season. The potential deal is drawing traction not just for its financial feasibility but also for its basketball implications.According to Favale, the trade could bring flexibility and much-needed star power to the Knicks’ roster: “Straight-up swapping Towns for LeBron would make the Knicks a lot older. So be it. New York still needs another ball-handler to consistently lighten its dependence on Jalen Brunson,” Favale wrote. (H/t: Dallas Hoops)This trade scenario gains further legitimacy considering the Knicks’ connections to LeBron. Team president Leon Rose is James’ former agent, and head coach Mike Brown previously coached him in Cleveland. With the Knicks reaching the Eastern Conference Finals last season for the first time since 2000, adding a veteran like LeBron James might be the final push they need.Here are the key reasons why this trade isn’t outlandish:- New York Ties: LeBron has a long-standing admiration for Madison Square Garden, calling it his favorite arena.- Prior Knicks Interest: He met with the Knicks during his 2010 free agency before signing with the Miami Heat.- Championship Aspirations: The Knicks haven’t won a title since 1973. LeBron’s arrival could shift that narrative.- Roster Fit: With Karl-Anthony Towns gone, the Knicks could restructure their big-man rotation with Mitchell Robinson and new addition Guerschon Yabusele.Despite his age, LeBron remains elite. Last season with the Lakers, he averaged:He also earned All-NBA Second Team honors and showed little sign of slowing down, solidifying his value even as he prepares to turn 41.As of now, the Los Angeles Lakers haven’t confirmed whether James has picked up his player option for next season. Until he does, the door remains open for trade talks. This uncertainty has added fuel to the Knicks rumors.Favale also points to the potential cap benefits for New York: “Give team president Leon Rose truth serum, and he might even tell you he appreciates the flexibility that the expiring contract of a soon-to-be 41-year-old LeBron would give the Knicks over the three seasons and $171.2 million owed to Towns.”A deal like this could allow the Knicks to reshape their future while contending in the short term. Even with Towns gone, the Knicks would retain a veteran-minimum slot to bolster their rotation.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers reportedly eyeing $33,075,000 Portland Trail Blazers star to bolster perimeter defense and improve title odds While this blockbuster trade remains hypothetical, all the pieces—from financial structure to long-standing relationships and roster fit—make it more than just fantasy.

Panthers push for three-peat with Marchand and Seth Jones; Mathew Tkachuk calls it ‘amazing’

Matthew Tkachuk Has Made Winning Stanley Cups Look Easy (Full Interview) | Stugotz

The Florida Panthers in order to retain core players like Sam Bennett, Aaron Ekblad, and Brad Marchand, successfully navigated salary cap challenges. Despite the potential to earn significantly more elsewhere, the team secured these players, with long-term, team-friendly contracts, influencing their championship success. Matthew Tkachuk expressed strong approval for these crucial roster moves.The Florida Panthers pulled off a magic trick with their team, keeping key players like Sam Bennett, Aaron Ekblad, and Brad Marchand even with a tight budget. How'd they do it? Their secret weapon, which convinced these guys to take a bit less money than they could've gotten elsewhere, was their winning spirit and two Stanley Cup championships.Aaron Ekblad, a top defenseman, signed an eight-year deal for $6.1 million a year. That's a steal when he could've easily charged over $10 million! And Sam Bennett followed suit, taking an $8 million AAV over eight years, turning down potential $10 million offers. Since both wanted to keep winning, they both chose to stay. Even Brad Marchand is sticking around for another six years at $5.33 million a year.Matthew Tkachuk, one of the Panthers' stars, even with the money crunch, was absolutely thrilled about these moves.When asked if he was upset about Marchand joining, he practically flared: ""I loved it. I knew that was a guy, with Seth Jones, who could put us over the hump. Now they’re here for the next five years — Marchy, six. Two culture guys and glue guys we’re lucky to have.""He even found it funny, inserting, ""No. I find it funny that hockey players want to stay in South Florida to play hockey — and will stay for less money. That’s amazing. It’s the greatest place to play in the NHL. Hopefully we’re not stopping at two.""It really indicates how much these players believe in the Panthers' winning formula and love playing in South Florida. Tkachuk himself is locked in for eight years at $76 million, and racking up points and helping them grab those two championships, he's been a huge part of their recent success.Also Read: “Just frustrating”: Ryan Reaves slams toxic Leafs fans, says they drove Mitch Marner out of Toronto after years of loyalty Being traded from the Calgary Flames, he's been with the Panthers for three seasons since in 2022.

Artemi Panarin’s future with the Rangers hangs in the balance as contract nears expiry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/artemi-panarins-future-with-the-rangers-hangs-in-the-balance-as-contract-nears-expiry/articleshow/122397170.cms,"Insider hints Rangers are preparing to move on from Artemi Panarin sooner than fans realize (Getty Images)

Rangers may lose Artemi Panarin amid rising speculation and behind-the-scenes tensions



The New York Rangers are at a crossroads, and all eyes are on Artemi Panarin. Despite an impressive regular-season performance from the star forward, the Rangers missed the postseason — an outcome the front office is determined to prevent moving forward. But doing that while managing the salary cap and aging roster has presented a complex challenge, especially as Panarin’s eight-year, $81.5 million contract nears its end in 2026.Still producing at an elite level, Panarin notched 89 points last season, following a stellar 120-point campaign in 2023-24. Yet, at 33 years old, he remains both an invaluable asset and a financial question mark. The team’s top brass, led by President and GM Chris Drury, has shown a willingness to part ways with veteran contracts that no longer justify their price tag — most recently seen with the trades of Chris Kreider and Barclay Goodrow.While Arthur Staple of The Athletic reported that Panarin is considered “one of the team’s only untouchables,” his age and cap hit are hard to ignore. The team may be reluctant to commit to another long-term deal that could age poorly — especially with an eye on building a younger, faster core to remain competitive in the coming seasons.According to Bleacher Report’s Lyle Richardson, “The Rangers can afford to re-sign Panarin on a short-term deal with a slight pay cut to around $10 million annually.However, his future in New York could depend on the Blueshirts' performance in 2025-26. Another missed postseason could lead to his departure to a Stanley Cup contender next July.”This raises a strategic dilemma for New York. Letting Panarin hit free agency without compensation would be a major loss, given his consistent production — 37 goals and 52 assists last season alone. Trading him now could recoup assets but might also derail their postseason hopes. Extending him would keep one of the league’s top point producers, but at a potential long-term cost.There’s no question Panarin remains a game-changer. But the Rangers know the window to win with their current core is narrowing. Whether they choose to trade him, extend him, or let him walk, the decision will shape the team’s trajectory for years to come.The writing may already be on the wall, and one thing is certain — the Rangers can’t afford to wait until next July to decide Panarin’s fate.Also Read: Connor McDavid's patience tested as Oilers trade key prospect amid rising 2025-26 expectations","Rangers may lose Artemi Panarin amid rising speculation and behind-the-scenes tensions.

From promising NHL talent to international shame

Criminal charges and fallout from the team

Dillon Dubé, once a rising star in Canadian hockey, is now at the center of one of the most disturbing scandals the sport has seen in years. The 26-year-old forward, formerly with the Calgary Flames, is one of several NHL players charged in connection with the 2018 Hockey Canada sexual assault investigation — a case that has sent shockwaves through both the league and the public.Dubé, born July 20, 1998, in Golden, British Columbia, was once viewed as a promising young forward with strong leadership qualities. He captained Team Canada to gold at the 2018 World Junior Championships and was drafted 56th overall by the Calgary Flames in 2016. After breaking into the NHL in 2018, he became a regular in the Flames’ lineup and signed a three-year, $6.9 million extension in 2021.But his career took a dramatic turn in early 2024.On January 21, 2024, the Flames announced that Dubé was taking an indefinite leave to address mental health issues. Just days later, the shocking news broke: “Representative for Calgary's Dillon Dubé confirm to The Athletic he's been charged with sexual assault by London Police,” tweeted Ian Mendes on January 30.The London Police Service formally charged Dubé on February 5, 2024, for an alleged sexual assault that occurred in 2018 in London, Ontario.The Calgary Flames immediately issued a statement distancing themselves, noting they “had no knowledge of pending charges at the time Dillon's request for a leave of absence was granted.”By the end of the 2023–24 season, the Flames declined to extend a qualifying offer, making Dubé an unrestricted free agent. On July 1, 2024, he signed a one-year deal with HC Dinamo Minsk in the KHL — a clear sign of his exile from the NHL amid the legal proceedings.Also Read: Who is Cal Foote?

Penguins fleece Stars in Matt Dumba trade to secure 2028 draft pick

The Dallas Stars have traded defenseman Matt Dumba and a 2028 second-round draft pick to the Pittsburgh Penguins for defenseman Vladislav Kolyachonok. This move helps the Stars manage their salary cap, acquiring a younger player. The Penguins gain a veteran blueliner and a valuable future draft asset.In the unpredictable world of professional hockey, team executives often play a high-stakes game of chess, intriguing players and draft picks to gain an advantage. Recently, as the Dallas Stars decided to part ways with seasoned defenseman Matt Dumba, along with a 2028 second-round draft selection, a notable swap occurred, sending them to the Pittsburgh Penguins. In return, Dallas welcomed younger blueliner Vladislav Kolyachonok into their ranks.This strategic exchange appears to be a clear move by the Stars to soothe some financial burden. Dumba, currently in the final year of a substantial two-season agreement, carried a significant financial commitment. The Stars were evidently ""eager to rid themselves of the veteran defenseman’s contract,"" especially given their ‘win-now mode’ and need for cap relief.On the other side of the ledger, Pittsburgh's general manager, Kyle Dubas, is proving himself a shrewd operator. He ""sure knows how to take advantage of teams when they’re dealing with salary-cap issues."" By taking on Dumba's remaining contract, the Penguins secured a crucial long-term asset in the 2028 second-round pick, even with his ‘declined’ performance in recent seasons.This aligns with Dubas's detectable pattern of acquiring future draft capital by accommodating other teams' salary constraints. As the commentary noted, ""With all due respect to Dumba, this is all about the second-round pick."" This mirrors past moves where Dubas embraced what ""some deem as bad contracts in the short term to add solid future assets,"" like the accession of Kevin Hayes and Cody Glass.For the Penguins, Dumba’s arrival offers immediate defensive depth, particularly if they proceed with potential trades involving other key defensemen. While Dumba ‘might not be the player he once was,’ he remains ‘a reasonably solid NHL player’ whose presence can only aid a defensive corps currently enduring struggles.Also Read: NHL rivalry twist: Danii Prokhorov says Islanders stole him from Rangers in bold pre-draft prediction Furthermore, should the team face difficulties this season, Dumba could become ""another asset that could be flipped,"" providing further flexibility.

BENGALURU: Battling through snow patches, rugged mountains, and 45 hours of non-stop running, Ashwini Ganapathi, a 39-year-old endurance athlete and coach from Karnataka, achieved a rare feat by finishing the Deep Japan Ultra 100, one of Asia's most demanding trail races.The ultra-endurance event, which began on June 27, saw 135 runners at the start line, including eight international participants. Only 63 managed to finish, and Ashwini stood out as the only non-Japanese athlete — across both men and women — to complete the 173km course, which also involved a punishing 9,000-metre elevation gain, higher than Mount Everest. She was the 10th woman overall to cross the finish line.""I completed the race in 45 hours and 42 minutes, carrying over 6kg of mandatory safety gear, plus food and water that brought my pack weight up to 8kg. As a vegetarian in Japan, I couldn't depend on local aid stations, so I carried everything I needed for the entire race. The dropout rate was huge — 72 runners did not finish — which shows just how brutal the course was,"" Ashwini shared.The Deep Japan Ultra 100 course featured three major mountain climbs — including Mount Asakusa and Mount Sumo — and was set on a treacherous terrain about 300km from Tokyo. ""There were snow patches on one summit that we had to cross three times, and several sections were so steep we needed ropes and chains to climb or descend,"" she said.The weather added to the challenge, swinging from humid and cloudy conditions on day one to blazing 33°C heat the next.There were no camps or sleep breaks — just aid stations sometimes spaced 28km apart, unlike the 10km intervals common in Indian trail races. ""I didn't sleep for two nights. I tried for five minutes in a nap room, but I just couldn't. We were on our feet the whole time,"" said Ashwini, who was funded by Tekion, an automotive retail tech company under its ‘Tekion for Good' CSR initiative.Full-time focus on fitnessAshwini is a full-time running coach. A former IT professional, she quit her corporate career after nine years to pursue fitness full-time. ""I was athletic all my life — I played field hockey in school — but realised I was better at endurance than speed. While others focused on minutes, I wanted to see how far I could go. That's how I got into ultrarunning.""Her passion for endurance races dates back to 2019, during the Malnad Ultra (110km) in Karnataka. ""I still had energy after running 100km. That's when I started dreaming about doing a 100-miler,"" she said.In preparation for Japan, Ashwini trained extensively. ""I was already preparing for a 100-miler in the US earlier this year. My weekly routine involved 70-90km of running, strength training at Invictus Performance Lab, and long weekend runs across different terrain. The team helped me work on uneven surfaces, muscle control, and injury prevention,"" she explained.One of her biggest mental boosts came during a training event — the Backyard Ultra — where runners completed 6.7km every hour until only one remained. Ashwini clocked 28 hours and 187.8km, setting an Indian women's record. ""It helped me mentally prepare for Japan — how to manage fuel, push through fatigue, and stay calm under pressure.""According to Ashwini, her family was her biggest support system. ""My husband and in-laws were incredibly supportive throughout this journey. My mother-in-law manages things at home when I'm away training or racing. It's been 14 years since I got married, and their encouragement means the world to me.""""With this accomplishment, I hope more women feel inspired to prioritise their health and take care of themselves. It's my wish to see more of us on the trails and in ultrarunning — because women are born with an unlimited supply of endurance.

Michael Milne’s journey from AHL standout to NHL debut with Minnesota Wild

The Minnesota Wild are doubling down on internal development for the 2025–26 season, officially signing 22-year-old forward Michael Milne to a one-year, two-way contract worth $775,000 at the NHL level and $100,000 in the AHL. The announcement on July 11, 2025, reflects the organization’s growing confidence in Milne’s readiness to contribute after his first NHL appearance last season. Born in Abbotsford, British Columbia, Milne fought through injuries to make his debut at St. Paul’s Xcel Energy Center on November 16, 2024. Now, with the ink dry on this new deal, the Wild are giving the gritty scorer every chance to carve out a bigger role.Michael Milne’s hockey story is one of resilience and persistence across Canada and the U.S. Selected 155th overall in the 2017 WHL Bantam Draft by the Kootenay Ice, he began with a quiet rookie campaign before exploding with the Winnipeg Ice. His best junior season came in 2021–22, where he racked up 38 goals and 81 points, showcasing the offensive touch that eventually got Minnesota’s attention.Drafted by the Minnesota Wild in the third round (89th overall) of the 2022 NHL Entry Draft, Milne signed his three-year entry-level deal in October that same year.He launched his professional career with the Iowa Wild in the American Hockey League in 2022, steadily proving his worth over three seasons. In 157 AHL games through 2025, Milne delivered 60 points (30 goals, 30 assists) and seven power-play goals, while also tallying nearly 300 shots on net.The 2024–25 season didn’t begin smoothly for Milne. Injuries forced him to miss both Wild rookie camp and main training camp, delaying his chance to prove himself in front of Minnesota’s NHL staff. When he finally returned to Iowa’s lineup, he wasted no time making an impact: four goals and eight points in his first ten games earned him a call-up to the big club.He made his NHL debut on November 16, 2024, against the Dallas Stars in St. Paul, skating on the fourth line with Jakub Lauko and Marat Khusnutdinov. Reflecting on that milestone in Des Moines later that week, Milne said: “That start to the season was huge for me. I just wanted to prove I was ready to go.”Wild President of Hockey Operations and General Manager Bill Guerin, speaking at Xcel Energy Center after the signing announcement, praised Milne’s effort and upside: “Michael’s a player who really earned that first NHL game. He’s tough, works hard, and has the kind of scoring touch we think can keep growing.”Now, with a fresh one-year contract in hand, Michael Milne is set to fight for a permanent spot on Minnesota’s 2025–26 roster. For a team trying to balance veteran leadership with homegrown talent, Milne’s development symbolizes the Wild’s strategy of building from within. If he can translate his AHL scoring grit into consistent NHL production, he might just become the breakout threat fans in Minnesota have been waiting for.Also Read: Toronto Marlies Sign Gunnarwolfe Fontaine, Ben King, Nick Rheaume in bold roster revamp","Minnesota Wild re-sign forward Michael Milne hoping for breakout NHL scoring in 2025–26 season. 22-year-old forward signed one-year, two-way contract worth $775,000 at the NHL level and $100,000 in the AHL.

Out nahin hona hain

Poll Do you think Rishabh Pant's self-talk is an effective strategy for him during matches? Yes, it helps him focus. No, he should rely on his coach. It might work for him, but not for others. I'm not sure.

Half an hour prior to the start of India’s innings on Friday afternoon, Rishabh Pant headed to the practice area at Lord’s. He batted for a good 30 minutes in the nets.The practice area is adjacent to the main ground here and many spectators thronged the area. One of the fans screamed, “, are you okay?” Pant, who was getting ready to face another delivery, replied, “(I’m trying. That’s what I’m checking).”Pant’s left index finger, which took a blow from a Jasprit Bumrah delivery on the first day of the match, was still hurting. With every shot in the nets, he was heard grunting cuss words. The concerned throwdown specialists and support staff tried to ask him if he was in pain. Pant warned them sternly, “Nobody will ask me about the pain. If I’m saying I’m fine, that means I’m fine.”Even as Pant went about constructing another crucial innings of 74 for India on Saturday morning, it was evident that the pain had not subsided. Every shot that got the bottom hand into play brought a grimace to his face.Pant’s greatest motivator is himself. He keeps talking to himself about how the game is moving. A week before he left to play the U-19 World Cup in Jan 2016, TOI had visited one of his practice sessions at the Sonnet Club in Delhi. While he was practicing his range hitting on a rough patch of the ground, he kept reminding himself, “(don’t get out).”Talking to himself has always been Pant’s defence mechanism. “I always talk a lot to myself. You get to know about it because the stump mic catches it. My late coach Tarak Sinha taught me to keep talking to yourself. That’s what I’ve been doing since childhood. It helps me a lot,” Pant had said.He once told TOI that he loves to feel nervous before a game. One may have noticed that he used to have dry coughs when he took guard early on in his innings. That is again a part of his defence mechanism, to fight the jitters in his stomach.It’s very difficult to decipher Pant’s thought process. Perhaps his inner voice is the best option. On Saturday, he once again egged himself on to bat through pain and ensured India didn’t fall behind in the Test early on Day Three.","Pant’s left index finger, which took a blow from a Jasprit Bumrah delivery on the first day of the match, was still hurting.

NFL Camp on Hold: Browns rookie Quinshon Judkins lands in jail over domestic violence charge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/nfl-camp-on-hold-browns-rookie-quinshon-judkins-lands-in-jail-over-domestic-violence-charge/articleshow/122414523.cms,"Browns rookie Quinshon Judkins remains in custody after domestic violence arrest just days before training camp (Image credits: IG/X)

Unsigned and in custody: Browns face early PR crisis

For the Browns, a familiar and unwelcome distraction

Just six days before the Cleveland Browns’ rookie class is set to report to training camp, second-round pick Quinshon Judkins remains behind bars following an arrest for domestic violence in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The 21-year-old running back, drafted No. 36 overall in April, is facing a misdemeanor battery charge categorized as a domestic offense. His first court appearance is scheduled for Sunday morning, per Broward County arrest records.Judkins, who has yet to sign his rookie contract, is now at the center of a legal and public relations headache for Cleveland. He is the only member of the Browns’ 2025 draft class still unsigned—a detail that now carries added weight amid the arrest. The team confirmed on Saturday it is “aware and gathering more information,” but has not provided further comment. No bail had been set as of Saturday night, and the NFL has yet to issue a statement.The incident took place in the Fort Lauderdale area Saturday afternoon. While full arrest details remain under wraps, the charge—""battery: touch or strike"" involving domestic violence—places Judkins at risk of both criminal penalties and discipline under the NFL’s personal conduct policy. League precedent suggests even a misdemeanor could trigger a suspension or time on the Commissioner’s Exempt List.The timing is especially problematic for the Browns, whose rookies are scheduled to report on July 18.Judkins was widely expected to compete for early playing time behind Nick Chubb, whose return from injury remains uncertain. With his contract unsigned and legal status unclear, his participation in camp now appears unlikely.For Cleveland, the arrest adds to a troubling pattern of off-field scrutiny that has dogged the franchise in recent years. From high-profile quarterback controversies to now a rookie’s domestic violence charge before even signing his deal, the team finds itself again forced to address image and accountability before a single snap of training camp.Also read: “You couldn't wait”: Ryan Clark tears into Puka Nacua’s girlfriend Hallie Aiono amid custody scandal","Cleveland Browns rookie Quinshon Judkins remains in custody after domestic violence arrest.

Poll Who was the standout bowler for the West Indies on Day 1 of the third test? Shamar Joseph Justin Greaves Jayden Seales

The West Indies dominated Australia on day one of the day-night third test at Sabina Park in Kingston, Jamaica on Saturday. The hosts' pace attack, led by Shamar Joseph's four wickets, bowled out Australia for 225 before finishing at 16-1 at stumps after surviving a tense final hour against Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins Shamar Joseph took 4-33, while Justin Greaves and Jayden Seales claimed three wickets each as the West Indies pacers capitalized on favorable seam and pitch conditions under lights.Sam Konstas, the 19-year-old Australian, continued his difficult tour as he fell lbw to Greaves for 17 off 53 balls in the opening session after Australia won the toss and chose to bat.Usman Khawaja struggled for 23 runs from 92 balls before being caught spectacularly by wicketkeeper Shai Hope off Shamar Joseph's bowling.Cameron Green and Steven Smith provided some resistance with a 61-run partnership, scoring 46 and 48 respectively, but both fell short of their half-centuries.Australia's middle order collapsed as Travis Head (20), Webster (1), and Alex Carey (21) were dismissed cheaply once the lights came on and the ball started moving significantly.Seales returned to dismiss Cummins for 24, who was caught in the deep attempting his third six of the over.Starc was dismissed for a duck in his 100th test match.Shamar Joseph completed his four-wicket haul by removing Josh Hazlewood, as Australia lost their final seven wickets for just 68 runs.""Every pitch has been tough,"" Green said after play. ""It was a real grind. Usman batted well and never looked in. Steve Smith looked like he batted on a different pitch again. We wanted to give them a tricky 45 minutes at the end and I thought they batted beautifully.""The West Indies faced a challenging period under lights with King and Anderson opening, as Mikyle Louis and John Campbell were unavailable after being injured while fielding.Starc, playing his 100th test match, claimed his 396th test wicket by bowling Anderson for 3, leaving him just four wickets short of 400 career wickets.Captain Chase and King survived several close calls to guide the hosts to stumps at 16-1, maintaining their advantage after day one.Australia made significant changes to their lineup, dropping spinner Nathan Lyon for the first time in 12 years and opting for an all-pace attack with Scott Boland joining Cummins, Starc, and Hazlewood.The West Indies recalled left-arm spinner Jomel Warrican in place of fast bowler Anderson Phillip, breaking up their all-pace attack from the previous test in Grenada.Opening batsman Kraigg Brathwaite was dropped after his 100th test following poor performances in the series, with scores of 4, 4, 0, and 7.

KL Rahul press conference: On last over fight, Rishabh Pant run out and fired up Shubman Gill

Why Shubman Gill, Jasprit Bumrah lost their cool in last five minutes of Day 3 vs England

Poll Who impressed you the most with their batting performance in the third Test at Lord's? Ravindra Jadeja KL Rahul Rishabh Pant Washington Sundar

Ravindra Jadeja turned up at Lord’s two hours before the start of the third day’s play on Saturday. He took Nitish Kumar Reddy along to the nets and had an extensive batting session. The weekend crowd, in early, watched. Jadeja later went on to put up a display of clean batting in the last two sessions to keep the attritional third Test on an even keel.With all the focus on the younger crop in the team, Jadeja and KL Rahul — having more than a decade of Test cricket behind them — had to re-establish their credentials. As it turned out, India’s three most experienced batters — Jadeja, Rahul and Rishabh Pant — carried the batting with their maturity.Rahul’s 100, Pant’s 74 and Jadeja’s 72 blunted the English attack on another day of gruelling Test cricket. As Washington Sundar’s wild hoick off Jofra Archer landed in the safe hands of Harry Brook, India’s innings finished at 387, the same score England put up in their first innings. After three full days of cricket, both teams still can’t be separated.England’s openers Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett took forever to take strike to ensure they didn’t have to play more than an over.The out-of-form Crawley, clearly nervous, stopped four times and even called the physio, even as the Indian fielders surroundedand went hard at him. When Bumrah eventually beat him with a cracking out-swinger off the last ball, Crawley turned around and walked at the pace of an Olympic racewalker towards the pavilion! He didn’t even wait for Duckett to join him.India saw off a probing day of bowling on a pitch which was baking under the blazing sun and had just enough to keep bowlers interested. England captain Ben Stokes went hard at the Indian batting in the last session, bowling flat out in a 10-over spell which accounted for Reddy for 30.If Rahul and Pant’s faultless 141-run partnership set the stage for India’s charge, Jadeja batted beautifully with Reddy and Washington Sundar against the second new ball. Jadeja made sure India didn’t let go of the advantage after Pant and Rahul fell within 10 balls either side of lunch.Inconsistency has been the bane of Rahul’s career. As he calmly pushed Jofra Archer to the covers in the first over after lunch, Rahul’s name went up on the Lord’s honours board for the second time. If the century here in 2021 was about proving his worth in the Test team, this one has enhanced his stature as the senior batter in the dressing room.Resuming the day delicately placed at 145/3, Pant and Rahul complemented each other to wear down the English attack. Pant did break free with his characteristic big shots off Archer, Chris Woakes and Ben Stokes. The duo brought down the shortball strategy with calculated and bold strokeplay.The England pacers attacked Pant’s injured left index finger with balls aimed at his armpit. Pant’s audacious six over long leg, off Stokes, brought up yet another halfcentury. And when Rahul moved away to the on-side and swatted Brydon Carse’s bouncer over mid-off for a boundary, England’s plans appeared to be falling flat.A few minutes of careless cricket from Pant and Rahul on either side of lunch got the home team back in the game. Pant, in a bid to give Rahul a shot to reach his hundred before lunch, took off for suicidal single off Shoaib Bashir, only for Stokes to pull off a spectacular run out.","Rahul's 100, Pant's 74 and Jadeja's 72 blunted the English attack. India's innings finished at 387, the same score England put up in their first innings. After three full days of cricket, both teams still can’t be separated.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122414558,imgsize-101584,width-400,resizemode-4/122414558.jpg"

KL Rahul press conference: On last over fight, Rishabh Pant run out and fired up Shubman Gill

'Ash Ki Baat'

Why Shubman Gill, Jasprit Bumrah lost their cool in last five minutes of Day 3 vs England

Former India spinner R Ashwin lauded Rishabh Pant for batting with pain but at the same time criticised the wicketkeeper-batter for throwing away his wicket, which gave England a chance to come back in the Test on Day 3 at Lord's.Rishabh Pant overcame pain in his left index finger to score an entertaining half-century before getting run out at the stroke of lunch. With Rahul closing in on a ton at the other end, Pant attempted an avoidable quick single in the last over of the session, but England skipper Ben Stokes pulled off a brilliant direct hit running in from cover to give his team something in a session controlled by the opposition.The partnership between Rahul and Pant yielded 141 runs off 198 balls. Pant, who batted through pain due to the finger injury he suffered while keeping on Day 1, made his intentions clear even against the express pace of Archer.""In the last two years, even when I used to watch from the dressing room, I feel like this Indian team has the ability to kill the game,"" Ashwin said on his Hindi YouTube channel""We had the chance to kill the game on Day 3. KL Rahul was batting beautifully; he looked in absolutely pristine form.His dismissal after reaching 100 was very soft.""If Rishabh could have gone on to score a bigger score, India could have shut this game down.""If India had got 50–100 runs more, I think England would have been under severe pressure.""The way Rishabh was batting was unreal. This is what I want from Rishabh Pant. He was looking so solid. He was batting beautifully. The only way he could have got out was run out. He wanted KL Rahul to get his hundred,"" he added.Rahul said he had told Pant of his plan to get to the century before the break.""Not ideal. There was a conversation a couple of overs before that: I told him [Pant] that I would get my hundred, if possible, before lunch. And with Bashir bowling that last over before lunch, I thought there was a good chance for me to get it, but, yeah, unfortunately, I hit it straight to the fielder,"" Rahul told reporters.""It was a ball that I could have hit for a boundary. Then he just wanted me to rotate strike and see if he could put me back on strike. But, yeah, it shouldn't have happened: a run-out at that stage really changed the momentum.""It was disappointing for both of us. Obviously, nobody wants to throw their wicket like that.""",Rishabh Pant scored an entertaining half-century before getting run out at the stroke of lunch.

“They’re gonna try and make his day miserable,”

“If he plays corner, they’re gonna run deep balls at him all day. Just take off on him, just to try to get him tired. Why wouldn’t you attack him that way?”

Travis Hunter’s two-way challenge could change game strategy

Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce has never been one to hold back his thoughts. But his latest comments on NFL rookie Travis Hunter are raising eyebrows across the league. With the Jacksonville Jaguars planning to use Travis Hunter on both offence and defence, Travis Kelce says there’s a catch that fans aren’t ready for. And it’s not about talent. It’s about strategy.During a recent episode of the Bussin’ With The Boys podcast, Travis Kelce shared a strong warning about the unique role that Jacksonville Jaguars rookie Travis Hunter is expected to play. Travis Hunter, who was drafted as a two-way player, might face more than just double the workload, he could face double the target.Travis Kelce explained that if Travis Hunter lines up as a cornerback, opposing teams won’t just throw his way, they might run deep routes at him all game just to wear him out.Travis Kelce said.That warning is sparking debate: Will the Jaguars’ plan backfire if Travis Hunter becomes the focus of every offensive attack?Travis Hunter’s skillset is rare. As a former college star at both wide receiver and cornerback, he brings excitement and versatility.But playing on both sides in the NFL is almost unheard of in today’s game. With Travis Kelce’s remarks, fans and analysts are now questioning whether the Jaguars can truly protect their first-round pick from burning out.Also Read: “Until We Got Married”: Kansas City Chiefs Star Patrick Mahomes Opens Up About How Brittany Supported Him Since High School Jacksonville Jaguars head coach Liam Coen is expected to make tough decisions.

Can a rookie survive this kind of attention from opposing teams week after week? Or will Travis Hunter prove everyone wrong and change the future of NFL roles?

Terry Bradshaw rips Pittsburgh Steelers for Kenny Pickett “failure”: “They didn't even do anything to build around him”,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/terry-bradshaw-rips-pittsburgh-steelers-for-kenny-pickett-failure-they-didnt-even-do-anything-to-build-around-him/articleshow/122395497.cms,"Photo by Jamie Squire/Getty Images

Terry Bradshaw slams Steelers for trading Kenny Pickett, ignoring offensive line, and failing their first-round QB

Terry Bradshaw’s unapologetic critique of the Pittsburgh Steelers’ direction

NFL legend Terry Bradshaw isn’t exactly known for pulling punches, and this offseason he’s at it again—taking aim squarely at his old team, the Pittsburgh Steelers. Bradshaw believes the organization badly mishandled young quarterback Kenny Pickett, now with the Philadelphia Eagles, calling the decision to give up on him after just two seasons a prime example of systemic failure. In recent podcasts and interviews, he’s aired his frustration about Pittsburgh’s roster decisions, their treatment of Pickett, and even floated some biting takes about rumored replacements like Aaron Rodgers . When Bradshaw talks about quarterbacks, everyone listens—even if it ruffles some feathers.On a recent podcast this week (July 2025), Terry Bradshaw didn’t mince words describing how Pittsburgh jettisoned Kenny Pickett after just two seasons.“A first-rounder, got rid of him after two years,” Bradshaw said. “And they're still looking for a quarterback. They didn't even do anything to build around him.”That’s not the first time he’s sounded the alarm. Earlier this year, speaking with ESPN, Bradshaw made clear he thought the trade was a massive blunder.“I liked Kenny Pickett,” he said. “I liked him at Pitt. I know him. I know what he's like.”Bradshaw argues Pittsburgh never gave Pickett a real shot to succeed.“When they got him to Pittsburgh, they didn't protect him, they didn't get him an offensive line,” Bradshaw explained. “They wanted to run the football, but they didn't have an offensive line that could protect, and they didn't have weapons. He had no wide receivers to speak of.”He points out the irony that the Steelers finally invested in the offensive line after shipping Pickett to Philadelphia.“They throw a kid in there for two years, and you've got an offense that doesn't fit and doesn't work, and they can't run because their offensive line's not even good enough for a run-blocking team,” Bradshaw said. “Now, they're saying Kenny Pickett is a failure. He wasn't a failure. The Steelers were a failure.”When Pickett left Pittsburgh, he’d posted a 14-10 record as a starter, with 4,474 yards, 13 touchdowns and 13 interceptions. Meanwhile, backup Mason Rudolph stepped in and delivered a three-game win streak that secured a playoff spot—prompting the Steelers to move on from their former first-rounder.Pickett will now compete for the starting job with the Cleveland Browns this season, while Rudolph’s future in Pittsburgh remains uncertain.Bradshaw also didn’t hold back on another rumor swirling around Pittsburgh this offseason: the idea they’d sign Aaron Rodgers to be their next starter. He dismissed the idea as a “joke.” As for Bradshaw’s opinions? Love them or hate them, they’re hard to ignore. When Terry Bradshaw talks quarterbacks, he doesn’t sugarcoat it—and the Steelers might be wise to listen next time.Also Read: Jaylen Warren’s bold offseason overhaul could make him the Pittsburgh Steelers’ surprise RB1 in 2025","NFL legend Terry Bradshaw is taking aim at his old team, the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Ball 6

Drama unfolded at Lord’s on Saturday as England’s Zak Crawley was accused of time-wasting to deny India a second over before stumps on Day 3 of the third Test. The delay led to a heated on-field confrontation with Indian captain Shubman Gill , who was caught swearing on the stump mic as tempers boiled over.India had just bowled England out for 387 earlier in the day and matched the total themselves, giving them a window to bowl two overs before close of play. But only one over was completed, thanks to Crawley’s actions in the middle.After the day’s play, KL Rahul , who scored a fine hundred earlier, called the whole sequence “theatrics”. “Two overs is a no-brainer with six minutes to go,” he said. “But I know exactly what was going on. Everyone knows.”England bowling coach Tim Southee hit back, pointing out delays from India earlier. “I’m not sure what they were complaining about when Gill was lying down getting a massage in the middle of the day yesterday,” he said. “It’s part of the game. It was good to see energy from both sides.”: England's openers took their time walking out. Mohammed Siraj exchanged words with Ben Duckett as they passed each other. Crawley left the first delivery alone outside off stump.: Bumrah slightly overpitched and Crawley clipped it for two runs.: Just as Bumrah was about to deliver, Crawley pulled away, pointing to supposed movement behind the bowler's arm. Shubman Gill wasn’t impressed and was heard shouting, “There’s no-one there! Get some balls, show f---ing balls!” The delivery was eventually bowled and left alone.: Crawley defended a ball on off stump. Indian fielders continued to chirp from the slips.: With only a minute left in the day, Crawley defended a rising delivery and reacted dramatically, shaking his right hand as if injured. He called for the physio. The Indian fielders clapped sarcastically. Gill walked over and exchanged angry words with Crawley. The two pointed fingers at each other as Duckett also stepped in. While the England physio tended to Crawley, the batter was seen comfortably drinking water moments later using the same hand.: Crawley finally faced the last ball, was beaten by Bumrah, and immediately walked off without waiting.On a gripping third day at Lord’s, KL Rahul stood tall with his second century at the iconic ground, helping India match England’s first-innings total of 387. Rahul’s classy knock, supported by crucial contributions from Ravindra Jadeja and Rishabh Pant, kept India in the fight on a pitch that is starting to misbehave. Pant batted bravely despite a finger injury but was run out after a mix-up just before lunch. India’s lower order dug in but could not accelerate much, leaving the game finely balanced as England’s openers returned to bat.","India bowled England out for 387 earlier in the day and matched the total themselves, giving them a window to bowl two overs before close of play.

Why Shubman Gill, Jasprit Bumrah lost their cool in last five minutes of Day 3 vs England

Poll Do you think Shubman Gill's reaction towards Zak Crawley was justified? Yes, he was right to confront Crawley. No, he should have kept his cool.

Former England cricketer Jonathan Trott has slammed India captain Shubman Gill for gesticulating towards Zak Crawley and shouting an expletive in his direction in the last over of Day 3 of the Lord's Test.Opener Zak Crawley repeatedly delayed bowler Jasprit Bumrah and called for a physio after being hit on the finger, successfully ensuring that he and Ben Duckett had to face only one over before the close of play, instead of two. Crawley’s time-wasting tactics infuriated Gill and his teammates.Gill pointed his finger at Crawley and told him to “grow some f***ing balls.” Duckett quickly intervened, positioning himself between them, but the verbal exchange continued. A ball later, Gill rushed to Crawley and held his arms up in an X. Crawley responded by waving a finger at Gill.Trott compared Gill's antics to those of former India captain Virat Kohli.“We don’t know what went on when England were fielding, whether they were dishing it out. But I don’t like the acting from Shubman Gill; as a captain, you set the tone,” Trott said on JioCinema.“Pointing fingers and getting very confrontational — very much like a previous captain — getting in the face of the opposition.“I’m all for being competitive and tough on the field, but sometimes you have to rise above it. It sets up nicely for tomorrow’s play.”The third Test between India and England is finely balanced, with no clear favourite at this stage.KL Rahul racked up his second hundred at the iconic Lord’s before India matched England’s first-innings total of 387 on an attritional day, leaving the game on an even keel on a deteriorating pitch.Besides Rahul’s high-quality effort (100 off 177), Ravindra Jadeja (72 off 131) and Rishabh Pant (74 off 112) propped up India’s first-innings total.It will be a challenge for India to bat last on a surface where the odd ball is taking off after pitching and is offering some turn.",Former England cricketer Jonathan Trott has slammed India captain Shubman Gill for gesticulating towards Zak Crawley and shouting an expletive in his direction.
