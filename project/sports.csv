The Chicago Bears ' 30-12 loss to the Minnesota Vikings has left their 2024 season hanging by a thread at 4-10. As frustrations grow, Bears players are speaking out. After Cole Kmet criticized the offensive line, Jaquan Brisker , still recovering from his third concussion, posted a simple yet powerful “Bad Morning” tweet. With the defense struggling and his absence felt, Brisker’s frustration reflects the team's overall struggles.

With just one target in the game, his anger is justified—once a reliable option in the offense, Kmet is now being sidelined, often ignored entirely in critical moments.DJ Moore also voiced his concerns, questioning whether it’s effort, execution, or a mix of both that’s holding the team back. Meanwhile, Caleb Williams is under relentless pressure, tied for the most sacks taken this season at a staggering 58. NFL legend Troy Aikman even described him as a “defeated guy,” drawing parallels to his own grueling rookie struggles. While Williams hasn’t thrown an interception in eight games, his two fumbles in the last two weeks spotlight deeper cracks in the offense. An unsteady offensive line has left him exposed, with little time to recover in the pocket.With three games left, Williams is on pace to land second on the list for most sacks taken by a rookie, trailing only Bryce Young and David Carr. The Bears are now staring down a crossroads, either addressing the glaring execution issues and rally for a strong finish, or let this season become another grim chapter in the story of a No. 1 pick left to struggle.","The Chicago Bears lost 30-12 to the Minnesota Vikings on Monday night.

Pakistan secured an emphatic 81-run victory against South Africa in the second ODI at Newlands, Cape Town, clinching the three-match series with an unassailable 2-0 lead. While the contributions of veterans Babar Azam (73) and Mohammad Rizwan (80) were pivotal in setting a competitive total of 329, and the bowling heroics of Shaheen Afridi (4/47) and Naseem Shah (3/37) sealed the win, the match’s narrative was dominated by a heated on-field confrontation during South Africa’s chase.The incident occurred when South African batter Heinrich Klaasen , who scored a valiant 97, appeared visibly agitated after an exchange with Pakistan pacer Haris Rauf following the delivery of a ball. Klaasen’s discontent escalated into a verbal spat, involving teammate David Miller and Pakistan skipper Rizwan, who is typically known for his calm demeanor.It was a tense scene as Rizwan and Klaasen engaged in a finger-pointing argument, prompting the umpires to intervene and defuse the situation. Babar Azam, Pakistan’s star batter and team stalwart, ran over to mediate and prevent further escalation. His timely interjection calmed an approaching Haris Rauf, averting what could have become a larger altercation.Once tempers cooled, play resumed without further incident, but the moment left fans buzzing on social media, with opinions divided about the exchange's origins and implications.Despite the drama, Pakistan’s dominant performance shone through. The partnership between Babar and Rizwan laid a solid foundation, and Afridi and Naseem’s fiery spells dismantled South Africa’s batting lineup, ensuring a comprehensive win.This victory marks Pakistan’s third consecutive ODI series win after their victory against Australia and Zimbabwe, underscoring form as they gear up to host the ICC Champions Trophy .

(Getty Images)

Amid talk of transition, the spotlight will be on India's underperforming middle order heading into the fourth Test. Australia share similar concerns, but it's their top order that's facing the heat

Rohit Sharma press conference: On Ashwin, Gabba draw and his form

MELBOURNE: Will the abrupt manner of Ravichandran Ashwin 's exit from the international arena affect India's spirit? Will Australia find all the negative talk about the top order overwhelming? These are the two major questions facing these era-defining teams as they go into the fourth Test facing identical issues about poor batting returns and inevitable change.For India, Ashwin's retirement could be a portent of things to come. For Australia, David Warner's last Test in Sydney against Pakistan at the beginning of the year kick started plans which have yet to come to fruition. Bluntly put, Australia have yet to find a proper replacement, showing the perils of forced transition.Australia's pace lineup too is ageing but is still formidable and has kept such questions at bay. The same can't be said of some of the senior batting stars on both sides, but they aren't the only ones under the microscope any more - some inconsistent youngsters too must share the blame.Both these teams are finding it hard to trust their batting lineups right now, but to what degree can teams contemplate alterations ahead of what is expected to be a series defining Test?As Ashwin told his teammates in the dressing room at the Gabba, ""Trust me, everybody's time comes."" Change may be inevitable, but Australia's canny skipper Pat Cummins is punting on being the enemy of change for now.Faced with a barrage of questions on sticking with the opening combo of Nathan McSweeney and Usman Khawaja, who haven't exactly set the series on fire, Cummins retaliated, ""There is so much more to picking a side than just looking at the Internet. (It's about) going on with really strong philosophies, working with players as a unit.""There is no dearth of conspiracy theories when it comes to Australian cricket. Former player and coach Darren Lehmann has even suggested chief selector George Bailey is too close to the team and hence unable to make ""hard decisions"". Cummins shot back, saying, ""The most important thing is you stay objective. They've made some really bold calls over the past couple of years in all formats. Probably bolder than I've seen other selectors make.""The ""bold call"" everyone wants now is to address Australia's struggling top three of Khawaja, McSweeney and Marnus Labuschagne, who have a combined average of 14.4, the lowest for Australia's top three in a home summer since 1887-88. Cummins feels there is no need to panic since some tough batting conditions have meant both teams have struggled to score.""Everyone's always hoping to score more runs. The trend in cricket, pretty much all around the world, is the top three is a really hard place to bat at the moment, particularly in Australia. The wickets are tough,"" Cummins said. ""I'd like them to score more runs, but they've made some important contributions that others have benefited from.""For India, the whole focus has been on the lack of runs from captain Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli 's unconvincing stays in the middle, apart from the century in Perth. But after a promising start, opener Yashasvi Jaiswal has fallen flat. No. 3 Shubman Gill and No. 5 Rishabh Pant too have been unable to convert starts. India, obviously, have the edge in the opening combine given KL Rahul 's good form, with the openers averaging 42.8 from 12 innings here compared to Australia's paltry 13.5.It's the middle order, from No. 3-6, that has been the real disappointment for India as a unit, averaging just 17.78 from a combined 20 innings to Australia's 31.95. India have clearly missed an in-form enforcer like Travis Head, a task entrusted to the likes of Pant.So, while both batting units have problems, they are different ones. Nos. 7-11 have performed similarly on both sides, Australia averaging 21.41 to India's 22.82, though India's last pair did heroically to avoid the follow-on in Brisbane to claim bragging rights.It appears the captains think alike about the batting issue. Like Cummins, Rohit too focused on the overall attitude instead of individual returns. ""It might appear that we lagged behind (in the third Test at the Gabba) but we take a lot from here. I'm immensely proud of the attitude we've shown because runs and wickets are one thing, but if your attitude and character are good then you can turn the impossible into possible,"" he said.Going into the MCG Test, only two things are clear on both sides. The younger batters will in all likelihood get a longer rope. And the veterans will be challenged to change themselves. How well they do so may decide which side comes out on top.",India and Australia face identical issues about poor batting returns and inevitable change. Ravichandran Ashwin's retirement could be a portent of things to come. Australia's canny skipper Pat Cummins is punting on being the enemy of change for now.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116486752,imgsize-77950,width-400,resizemode-4/116486752.jpg"

The Dallas Mavericks are gearing up for an important game against the LA Clippers on Thursday, December 19, but the availability of star guard Kyrie Irving remains doubtful.

This has left fans and analysts alike wondering if we will see him on the court tonight.Tonight’s match against the LA Clippers is important for the Mavericks and Irving’s possible absence can prove to be costly. The team is already facing issues with a string of injuries. Luka Dončić, the team's star player, has been ruled out with a left heel contusion.

In the 24 games he’s played, the 6-foot-2 guard has been a prime example of consistency, averaging 23.9 points per game while shooting 50.4% from the field and 46.4% from beyond the arc. His offensive firepower has played a major role in the team’s 17-9 record, which currently places them fourth in the Western Conference.In the Mavericks’ last game, Irving delivered a modest performance in their NBA Cup quarterfinal against the Oklahoma City Thunder. He scored 17 points, grabbed two rebounds, and dished out five assists, shooting 8 of 16 from the field and 1 of 4 from three-point range. While the numbers were solid, fans will be hoping for a bigger impact if he takes the floor against the Clippers.The game is set to tip off at 8:30 p.m. EST (5:30 p.m. PT) at the American Airlines Center in Dallas, Texas.

NEW DELHI: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has announced a hybrid model for the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 , which will be hosted by Pakistan, with matches involving India being played at a neutral venue.This decision comes after a prolonged deadlock over the hosting rights, with the ICC finally resolving the issue under the chairmanship of Jay Shah.Former Pakistan pacer Mohammad Amir welcomed the hybrid model, expressing his joy over the prospect of an India-Pakistan match, regardless of the venue.He emphasized that fans would find a way to witness the iconic clash, even if it were to take place on the moon.""As a cricketer, I welcome this announcement of the India vs Pakistan match on Champions Trophy 2025 in a neutral venue (as per hybrid model). Even if this contest of India and Pakistan happens on the moon, fans will find a way,"" Amir told Sunil Yash Kalra, as quoted by ANI.While Amir acknowledged the significance of the India-Pakistan match itself, he also expressed disappointment with the ICC's approach, stating that the governing body acted lazily in resolving the deadlock.""I welcome the fact that the match between India and Pakistan is taking place.

Here’s why Mike Vrabel is the right fit for Bears' rebuild

Edelman’s praise intensified hiring rumors



The Chicago Bears ’ 2024 season has been a major disappointment, with hopes for a bright future dashed by a 4-10 record. Despite the arrival of 2022 Heisman winner Caleb Williams , the team continues to struggle. As the Bears search for answers heading into 2025, former NFL star Julian Edelman has a bold suggestion: hire Mike Vrabel as head coach. The Bears, Edelman argues, need a leader who can bring accountability and discipline—traits Vrabel is known for. With the future of the franchise on the line, could Vrabel be the spark that ignites the Bears’ revival?The Chicago Bears’ 2024 season has been a letdown, with a 4-10 record despite the high hopes surrounding 2022 Heisman winner Caleb Williams. As the team looks toward 2025, former NFL star Julian Edelman weighed in on the coaching changes necessary for a turnaround. On The Herd With Colin Cowherd, Edelman urged the Bears to hire Mike Vrabel, saying, “They need an accountability guy... someone who’ll grab you by the neck and demand better.”Vrabel’s tough, disciplined coaching style worked wonders in Tennessee, where he built a solid 54-45 record and earned deep respect from his players. Edelman praised Vrabel's ability to get under players' skin while keeping them laser-focused, saying, “He was so smart that he could get under your skin and you couldn’t do anything about it. Because he knew your assignment, he knew his assignment. And that’s the kind of guy you need, you need an a—— and that’s what they’re lacking in that locker room.” Vrabel’s leadership, centered on high standards and accountability, is exactly what the Bears need to rebuild their culture. (via: EssentiallySports)As the Bears look to the future, Vrabel could be the game-changing hire they’ve been waiting for, providing the fire and discipline to push the team back into contention. With strong rumors linking him to Chicago, the excitement around the possibility is building.Also Read: Sean Payton to lose two key players, while Jim Harbaugh faces seven injury challenges The Chicago Bears are well aware of the immense talent Caleb Williams brings to the table, but for him to truly thrive, a robust offensive line is essential. After their Week 15 loss to the Lions, the O-line was ranked 16th, exposing the gaps in their protection. In this critical situation, someone like Mike Vrabel could be a game-changer, but only if the Bears grant him the autonomy to execute his vision without restrictions.Vrabel’s history of pushing back on management decisions most notably his 2023 friction with the Titans over the hiring of GM Ron Carthon highlights his strong convictions. That conflict led to his eventual departure, but it’s clear he won’t shy away from voicing his concerns if necessary. Despite that, the Bears are keen on initiating talks with Vrabel during the 2024 offseason, hoping to turn the page on a disappointing era.With four consecutive seasons of playoff absences, the franchise can no longer afford to sit idle. A fresh coaching direction could be the catalyst they need to rewrite their narrative and finally return to postseason glory.",Former NFL star Julian Edelman believes Mike Vrabel is the right coach for the Chicago Bears. The Bears are looking to rebuild after a 4-10 season in 2024.

R Ashwin announces retirement from Test cricket

Rohit Sharma press conference: On Ashwin, Gabba draw and his form

NEW DELHI: Hours after R Ashwin father's explosive statement on his sudden retirement from international cricket due to 'humiliation', the spinner made a clarification on social media, pointing out that his 'dad isn't media trained'. Ashwin, 38, shocked everyone by announcing his retirement on Wednesday after the completion of the third India vs Australia Test in Brisbane.But his father on Thursday claimed that one of the reasons behind his son's sudden retirement call was the ""humiliation"" he faced in the team. Ashwin 's father Ravichandran said that regular omissions from playing XI forced him to quit.Clarifying on the statement, Ashwin requested on social media to forgive his father and ""leave him alone"".“I too came to know last minute, actually,"" News18 quoted Ashwin's father Ravichandran as saying.“What was going on in his mind I don’t know. He just announced. I too accepted it with full pleasure. I did not have any feeling at all for that. But the way he gave his retirement, one part I was very happy, another part not happy because he should have continued.“(Retiring) is his (Ashwin’s) wish and desire, I cannot interfere in that, but the way in which he gave that, there could be many reasons. Only Ashwin knows, maybe humiliation,"" he said.“Definitely, no doubt about it (being emotional for the family), because he was on the field for 14-15 years. The sudden change – retirement – gave us really kind of a shock. At the same time, we were expecting it because humiliation was going on. How long he can tolerate all those things? Probably, he would have decided on his own,"" Ravichandran said.Soon after his retirement, Ashwin took a flight back to India and returned to Chennai -- his home -- on Thursday.Ashwin concluded his illustrious Test career as India’s second-highest wicket-taker, claiming 537 wickets in 106 matches. He stands only behind the legendary Anil Kumble, who holds the record with 619 wickets.Ashwin featured in the second Test of the series in Adelaide but was omitted from the third Test in Brisbane.Despite stepping away from international Test cricket, Ashwin will continue to play in domestic competitions, including the IPL, where he is set to return to the Chennai Super Kings next season.","Ashwin's father Ravichandran said regular omissions from playing XI forced him to quit.

Taylor Swift Feels The Safest With Travis Kelce



Travis Kelce Has Upped The Security Of His Home For Taylor Swift



Taylor Swift is extremely concerned when it comes to her safety, which made her skip the Chiefs vs Browns game that happened yesterday as she only prefers to attend matches that happen at the Arrowhead Stadium, the home stadium of her boyfriend, Travis Kelce’s team. As per U.S. Sun, a source close to the couple has now revealed that Taylor is planning to move temporarily into Travis’ home in Kansas so that she can be with him as the team will enter playoffs next month.The source, according to U.S. Sun revealed, ""She will be going to Kansas City and staying there for some time during the next few weeks to be with Travis and show him love and support.”This is the same home of the Kansas City Chiefs’ tight end Travis Kelce that was burglarised in the month of October when Travis was away playing for his team, the Kansas City Chiefs. It was not just his home that was burglarised; his teammate and a close friend of his, Patrick Mahomes’ house was also burglarised just a few days later. Since then two more players’ in the NFL have been victims of such burglaries, this also includes the quarterback of the Cincinnati Bengals, Joe Burrow who recently suffered a home break in.Before this incident, as per many reports, a source close to Taylor and Travis had revealed that Taylor was pretty scared after one of her concerts in Vienna had to be cancelled because of a potential terror attack and now she only feels safe when she is with her boyfriend, the NFL star Travis. This also makes sense because now Taylor, who skips away games of the Kansas City Chiefs, is now planning to stay with Travis at his home that was burglarised just recently.Since Travis’ home was burglarised, according to various reports, Travis has put in extra effort to secure his home’s security especially so that Taylor can be at his home in peace. It seems like the burglary and the terror threat to Taylor’s concert has really shaken up the couple. Travis has used modern amenities to secure his home so that an incident like this does not repeat itself and Taylor as well as her belongings are all safe at Travis’ home.Also Read: Taylor Swift decides to miss the Browns game over safety concerns, continuing to attend Travis Kelce’s home games As per reports, Travis had reported valuables worth $100K were stolen from his house. Till now only one of his watches could be recovered by the authorities last month. There are no reports on what else could have been tracked by the authorities. The twin burglary was so shocking that both the NBA and NFL had to issue warnings to its players since it was revealed there were international criminal gangs working who were constantly tracking players through their social media.As Taylor moves into Travis’ home for the upcoming matches of the Kansas City Chiefs, it is just another sign that speaks about how much Taylor trusts Travis and how deep they are in love with each other. They have been together for more than a year now and it seems like their bond is just getting stronger everyday.This highlights the faith that Taylor has in her boyfriend that she is fully committed to supporting him as he prepares for his team to enter into the playoffs. Last season too Taylor took time out of her busy schedule and flew to be with Travis during the playoffs as well as attended the Super Bowl. However, now since she has wrapped up her legendary Eras Tour, so this season she has more time to give to Travis and she is leaving no stone unturned to support him, even if that means moving into a house that was recently burglarised.","Travis Kelce’s home was burglarised in the month of October when Travis was away playing for his team, the Kansas City Chiefs.

Jordan Clarkson and Ron Holland II were ejected from the Jazz vs. Pistons game



In a heated moment during the Jazz’s game against the Pistons, Jordan Clarkson was ejected after a near-altercation on the court. The incident, which almost escalated into a fight, came during a tense exchange between Clarkson and Pistons’ rookie Ron Holland. The ejection added extra drama to an already intense matchup, as the Jazz were left to regroup without one of their key players.An altercation on the court during Thursday's match-day between the Utah Jazz and Detroit Pistons led to the firing of Jordan Clarkson and Ron Holland for near-fighting. This incident occurred in the second quarter which increased the on-court drama levels. Clarkson was involved in an exchange with the rookie of the Pistons, and this quickly turned into an altercation which led to the two being ejected from the game. The two teams were faced with adjusting to the absence of their respective players.The fight happened when the second quarter was running with just over six minutes to go. Clarkson and Holland, both involved in the incident, collided in what would have been a play-only scenario. They pushed and shoved each other for a while before the two began to hurl insults at each other, eventually leading to a physical confrontation. The referees immediately took action and they proceeded to review the incident and determined it to be worthy of expulsion from the game. Although there were no punches thrown, the heated altercation has since been widely discussed on social media.Clarkson had been performing well for the Jazz and seemingly didn't like Holland's aggressive play. It appears that the aggressive play has led to the moment between the two but the teammates including Collin Sexton and Marcus Sasser, and officials rushed to separate them. Holland, the rookie forward for the Pistons, was part of that confrontation after a hard foul earlier from Clarkson. Ejection followed because both players were deemed guilty by officials.Holland and Clarkson were each assessed double technical fouls and ejected from the game. Clarkson contributed three points in 14 minutes before his ejection, while Holland had four points in 13 minutes.Also Read: Andre Drummond gives a positive update on Sixers star Joel Embiid’s return following sinus fracture The Thursday game is the second game that Clarkson has played after returning from a lengthy foot injury. With his three points in the game, he added five rebounds and one assist. From 15 games this season, he averages 15.9 points, 3.5 rebounds, and 3.7 assists. It is unknown whether Clarkson will face any further punishment from the league due to the altercation with the potential decision coming before the Jazz's next match on Saturday against the Brooklyn Nets.

Rohit Sharma press conference: On Ashwin, Gabba draw and his form

Scenario 1: Series Ends 2-2

Australia must lose their series against Sri Lanka by at least a 1-0 margin.

Alternatively, South Africa must suffer a 2-0 defeat in their series against Pakistan.

Scenario 2: Series Ends 1-1

South Africa must lose both matches of their series against Pakistan (2-0).

Or, Australia must either lose 1-0 to Sri Lanka or draw their series 0-0.

In the event of a 0-0 draw between Australia and Sri Lanka, India would be tied with Australia at 53.51% but would edge ahead due to having more series wins in the WTC cycle (three versus two).

However, a 2-0 win for Sri Lanka over Australia would eliminate India from contention as Sri Lanka’s PCT would surpass India’s.

NEW DELHI: The India-Australia Test series stands at a tense crossroads following the rain-affected draw in the third Test in Brisbane.With the five-match series level at 1-1, the remaining games in Melbourne and Sydney will be decisive, not just for the series outcome but also for the World Test Championship (WTC) Final qualification scenarios.If the series ends in a 2-2 draw, India will conclude the WTC cycle with a percentage points tally (PCT) of 55.26%. To qualify for the WTC Final under this scenario, India would rely on other results:A 1-1 draw in the India-Australia series will reduce India's PCT to 53.51%, making qualification trickier. Under this outcome:India’s performance in the remaining Tests will play a pivotal role, but qualification hinges heavily on external results.Consistency in batting and bowling, especially addressing middle-order collapses and over-reliance on Jasprit Bumrah, is crucial.Meanwhile, favourable weather and conditions during other teams’ fixtures could also shape the race to the WTC Final.","The India-Australia Test series stands at a tense crossroads following the rain- affected draw in Brisbane.

CHENNAI: Heavy is the head that wears the crown, and for D Gukesh , maintaining his position as the World Chess Champion will be as difficult as reaching it. At just 18, Gukesh has already proven his extraordinary talent, but the journey now shifts to sustaining that success in the years ahead.Gukesh ascended the throne in Singapore last week, and the entire world paused to celebrate the young prodigy. Yet, amidst the roaring applause, his statement was startlingly humble. ""Becoming the world champion does not mean I am the best player."" It was a declaration that revealed maturity beyond his years and an insatiable hunger to grow. Viswanathan Anand , who knows all about becoming the world champion and retaining the crown time and time again, is extremely impressed with the way Gukesh has maintained his composure. ""His journey to the world title has been so fast that he missed a lot of the other titles. He hasn't had a chance to play enough tournaments yet, or he's played one edition at most. In a way, he's saying, 'I've got a lot left to accomplish.' And it's a fantastic attitude to have,"" Anand told TOI during an interaction organised by the WestBridge Anand Chess Academy, who have been sponsoring Gukesh.Anand won his first world title in 2000 and then had to wait six years to win it back again. Then for seven years when he stayed the world champion, the pressure was immense with Vladimir Kramnik, Veselin Topalov and Boris Gelfand making things incredibly difficult for him between 2008 and 12. But as Gukesh embarks on his own path, Anand sees a different script for him.""I think for Gukesh, it is so early that he will not face those problems - lack of inspiration or motivation. His challenges are more likely to be how to win the rapid championship; he's going to start ticking off a list. He seems like someone who, once he sets a goal, is very focused and willing to do whatever it takes.""However, Gukesh is not the only one from India in the quest for chess supremacy. He faces a growing wave of competition, with friends-cum-rivals like R Praggnanandhaa and Arjun Erigaisi determined to carve their names in the history of the game. The trio represents a new generation of Indian talent, pushing each other to new heights as they chase the ultimate goal.The prospect of multiple Indian contenders in the World Chess Championship (WCC) is becoming more and more plausible. In fact, the idea of two Indians battling for the crown in 2026 is not just a dream - it's a tangible goal. ""If we have two Indians playing at the WCC - WOW! What a journey, what a moment that will be. That would be the dream. It's a very difficult road, but India could easily have multiple candidates now,"" said Anand.Such a moment would redefine the chess landscape in India. And Anand will be the happiest after he had shown the way all those years ago.","D Gukesh, 18, is the new World Chess Champion. Viswanathan Anand hopes for an all-Indian final in 2026.

That's our national cricket academy where he is rehabbing. Those guys are the ones who need to come up and give us some kind of update. But look, I understand he's playing a lot of cricket back home, but there have been some complaints about his knee as well,"" Rohit said in the post-match press meet.""The last thing you want is the player coming here and then pulling out in the middle of the game. You know what happens when that kind of thing happens,"" Rohit quipped, referring to the disruption caused by mid-series injuries.Shami has been away from international cricket since participating in India's ODI World Cup Final in November 2023. His path back to competitive cricket has involved playing domestic tournaments.Following his surgery and comprehensive rehabilitation, the seasoned fast bowler resumed playing through the Ranji Trophy, and later delivered strong performances in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy.The Indian cricket team's management remains cautious about Shami's return, insisting on definitive clearance from the NCA. Rohit emphasised that the team would only consider including him in the squad after receiving complete assurance regarding his fitness from the academy.""There's no way we want to take that chance unless we are like, not a hundred percent, 200 hundred percent sure.

NAVI MUMBAI: When it mattered, the India women’s team came to the party.Thoroughly entertaining a massive, record crowd of 47, 204 at the DY Patil Stadium here on Thursday night in the series decider against the West Indies by putting on a clinical show with the bat and ball and lager taking a 'winning lap' around the ground, India coasted to a morale-boosting 60-run win in the third and final T20I. Reeling after the 3-0 thrashing at the hands of the Aussies in the away ODI series earlier this month, the hosts now go into the ODI series in Baroda from Dec 22 having downed the 2024 Women’s T20 World Cup semifinals 2-1 in the T20I leg.Using her bat like a sledgehammer, dashing ‘keeper-batter Richa Ghosh equalled the record for the quickest half-century (54, 21b, 3x4, 5x6), while stand-in-captain Smriti Mandhana slammed her third consecutive fifty (77, 47b, 13x4, 1x6), breaking the record for scoring the most T20I runs in a calendar year, as India plundered their way to 217 for four in 20 overs after being asked to take first strike.It is India’s highest-ever total in this format. There were also useful contributions by Jemimah Rodrigues (39, 28b, 4x4), who added 98 in 55 balls for the second wicket with Mandhana, and young batter Raghvi Bist (31 not out, 22b, 2x4, 1x6), who was impressive while playing just her second international game.After bulldozing West Indies with the bat, the Indian women’s team fielded like tigresses and bowled superbly, as West Indies crumbled with the bat and were restricted to 157 for nine in 20 overs, with only Chinelle Henry (43, 16b, 3x4, 4x6) putting up some fight.Much to India’s delight, the visitors lost skipper Hayley Matthews (22), who had blasted 85 not out off 47 balls to fashion West Indies’ win in the last match, in the eight over, when she was caught by Sajeevan Sajana at long-off off Radha Yadav.It was a brilliant comeback by India after they were mauled by nine wickets by the visitors in the second T20I at the same venue on Tuesday. With Ghosh and Mandhana, who cracked seven boundaries in a row in the first four overs, going beserk, West Indies’ veteran seamer Deandra Dotti, who had taken 2-14 in four over in the last match, ended up conceding 54 in four overs on Thursday night. In the fourth over, Mandhana took 20 off Dottin-three fours and a superbly-timed six over wide long-off.Off-spinner Karishma Ramharack, another impressive bowler for the Caribbeans, went for 44-0 in three overs.Looking like she was out to have a party at the expense of the clueless-looking West Indies bowlers the moment she walked in to bat in the 15th over, Ghosh, who is amongst the most dangerous finishers, teed off from the first ball she faced, pumping a six over long -off to Deandra Dottin. The 21-year-old then sliced the next ball for a four, and then in the next over, lofted Aaliyah Alleyne to the cow corner.In a murderous mood, she pulled Alleyne for a six to deep square leg, and then thumped West Indies captain Hayley Matthews for back-to-back sixes in the 19th over-a slog sweep while going down on one knee followed by a pull off a long hop to deep square leg. With the crowd chanting ‘Richa, Richa’ as she kept producing one big blow after another, a fired-up Ghosh reached her fifty – now the fastest along with New Zealand's Sophie Devine and Australia's Phoebe Litchfield - by clubbing an Alleyne delivery for a six in the final over.Has any Indian batter, or any batter in world cricket, been in more smashing form than Mandhana has been in 2024 in white-ball cricket in the women’s game? The classy left-hander is now the top run-getter in T20Is this year, with 763 runs under her belt in 23 matches @42.38, with eight fifties. No one has scored more runs in T20Is in 2024. She has stroked 100 fours this year-again a record. Apart from all this, the ultra-consistent left-hander has hit four hundreds this year-the most by anybody.Coming off scores of 54 off 33 balls & 62 off 41 balls in the first two T20Is, Mandhana, raining boundaries on both sides of the wicket, set up the base from which Ghosh launched India’s total past 200. India suffered an early blow when opener Uma Chetry was out for a duck in the first over.","India beat West Indies by 60 runs in third and final T20I in Mumbai.

That will be helpful for all the stakeholders, cricket boards, and the broadcasters,"" Dhumal told IANS.The ICC's Thursday ruling covers major events such as the men’s Champions Trophy 2025, hosted by Pakistan in February and March, the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup 2025 in India, and the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026, co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka.Additionally, the PCB has been granted hosting rights for the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup 2028, which will also follow the neutral venue arrangement for India-Pakistan matches.The decision also puts to rest speculation about the fate of the Champions Trophy, ensuring that the much-anticipated India-Pakistan clash will proceed.The ICC Board clarified that during the 2024-2027 rights cycle, any India-Pakistan matches in ICC events hosted by either country will take place at neutral venues.The Champions Trophy 2025, scheduled for February and March, will see Pakistan defending their title, having defeated India by 180 runs in the 2017 final at The Oval.The complete schedule for the tournament is expected to be announced soon.India and Pakistan last met in the T20 World Cup earlier this year in New York, where India claimed a thrilling six-run victory and went on to secure their second T20 World Cup title.Due to ongoing political tensions between the two nations only compete against each other in international multi-nation tournaments such as World Cups and the Asia Cup.Their last bilateral series was in 2012-13 when Pakistan toured India for a five-match white-ball series.","IPL chairman Arun Dhumal backs International Cricket Council's decision to hold India-Pakistan matches at neutral venues during ICC events until 2027.

NEW DELHI: Sediqullah Atal 's maiden one-day international century propelled Afghanistan to a resounding 232-run victory, their biggest-ever One-Day International (ODI) win, over Zimbabwe in the first match of the three-match ODI series in Harare on Thursday.Atal (104) and Abdul Malik (84) forged a formidable opening partnership of 191 runs, laying a solid foundation for Afghanistan's imposing total of 286/6 from their allotted 50 overs. Captain Hashmatullah Shahidi 's unbeaten 29 provided a late flourish to the innings.Zimbabwe's response was dismal from the outset, with Ben Curran's run-out on the final ball of the first over setting the tone for a disastrous batting performance.Only Sikandar Raza (19 not out) and Sean Williams (16) managed to reach double figures as the home team was bundled out for a paltry 54 in 17.5 overs.The Afghan bowlers, led by Allah Ghazanfar (3/9), Naveed Zadran (3/13), and Fazalhaq Farooqi (2/15), were relentless in their pursuit of wickets.Atal, a 23-year-old debutant last month, expressed his delight at his maiden century and the team's comprehensive victory.Malik and Atal's partnership laid the foundation for Afghanistan's commanding total, with both batsmen complementing each other effectively. Shahidi praised the openers' efforts and emphasized the team's all-round dominance in all departments.The match highlighted Zimbabwe's ongoing struggles in the 50-over format, with their total of 54 ranking among the lowest ODI scores in history.The team shares the unwanted record of the lowest ODI score of 35 with the United States, a mark they achieved against Sri Lanka in Harare in 2004.Zimbabwe's totals of 38 (against Sri Lanka in Colombo) and 44 (against Bangladesh in Chattogram) are also among the seven lowest ODI scores ever recorded.",Afghanistan beat Zimbabwe by 232 runs in first match of three-match ODI series.

NEW DELHI: With a whopping 21 wickets in three Tests, pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah has been the centre of attention in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy Down Under.Bumrah, the leading wicket-taker in the series, is way ahead of other bowlers has been a serious headache for the hosts.The 31-year-old so far has two five-wicket hauls -- in Perth and Brisbane -- and has been a thorn in the flesh especially of Australia openers Usman Khawaja and Nathan McSweeney -- dismissing them four times each.Former Australia head coach Justin Langer on Thursday heaped rich praise on Bumrah, calling him a right-handed version of legendary Pakistan pacer Wasim Akram “I would hate to face him. He is like Wasim Akram. For me, he is a right-hand version of Wasim Akram, and every time I am asked the question ‘Who is the best bowler you have ever faced’, I say Wasim Akram.“They have got good pace and the great bowlers just hit the same spot every time, and they have got a good bouncer, so it makes them a bloody nightmare. He has got the ability to swing the ball both ways, his seam is literally picture perfect.“If you present a perfect seam and it comes perfectly out of the fingers as it does with him, you get the double whammy, swing in the right conditions and if it hits the rope it can go either way. That’s what Akram used to do and was a nightmare to face,” said Langer to The Nightly.“I would hate to face Bumrah. He’s a great competitor, he bowls good pace and he’s just awesome. I said at the start of the series, if Bumrah stays fit, it is going to be a really tough summer for the Australian batters, if he doesn’t, then I think Australia will win the series easily, and I still maintain that,” he added.Langer also expressed surprise on sudden retirement of veteran India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin after the third Test in Brisbane.“I was surprised Ashwin retired because I thought they would use him and (Ravindra) Jadeja — go to their big guns for maybe Melbourne and definitely Sydney. I think Melbourne and Sydney are as likely to suit India as the other two venues,” he added.After three matches, the series is currently tied at 1-1.The fourth BGT Test begins from December 26 in Melbourne.",Jasprit Bumrah has taken 21 wickets in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy Down Under.

Jesus hat-trick

London: Liverpool moved into the League Cup semi-finals as the holders won 2-1 against managerless Southampton , while Gabriel Jesus ended his goal drought with a hat-trick in Arsenal 's 3-2 victory over Crystal Palace on Wednesday.Rare goals from Darwin Nunez and Harvey Elliott at St Mary's sent the 10-time League Cup winners into the last four for a record 20th time.Held to a surprise 2-2 draw against Fulham in the Premier League last weekend, Liverpool got back on track with a 20th win from 24 games in all competitions under Arne Slot, who has lost just once since arriving from Feyenoord to replace Jurgen Klopp.Slot, who watched the quarter-final from the stands while he served a touchline suspension, opted to rest Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk as the Premier League leaders made eight changes.Liverpool's understudies were too strong for Southampton and Nunez ended his poor recent form with a clinical finish after Jan Bednarek made a hash of clearing Trent Alexander-Arnold's pass in the 24th minute.It was only Nunez's fourth goal in all competitions in a difficult season for the Uruguay striker, who had gone six games without scoring.Elliott doubled Liverpool's lead in the 32nd minute, drilling low past Alex McCarthy from 12 yards for his first goal this season.Cameron Archer reduced the deficit in the 59th minute with a superb curling strike from just inside the area.Southampton were furious when a late Jarell Quansah challenge on Mateus Fernandes didn't result in a penalty.But there was no escaping yet another defeat for Southampton in caretaker boss Simon Rusk's first game after Russell Martin was sacked following Sunday's 5-0 thrashing by Tottenham .""It was a very good and important win. We saw a lot of players that maybe don't start,"" Slot said.""We handled it really well and only conceded one or two chances. We have to defend the trophy because the club won it last season.""At the Emirates Stadium, Brazilian striker Jesus finally found the back of the net on home turf for the first time in 2024.Jesus' only previous goal in 20 appearances in all competitions this season had come against second-tier Preston in the League Cup.The 27-year-old's first goals in nine games were well-timed after Arsenal were booed off following Saturday's 0-0 draw against Everton in the Premier League.The Gunners, who last won the League Cup in 1993, are six points behind Liverpool and Mikel Arteta made eight changes as he prioritised Arsenal's rematch with Palace in the top flight on Saturday.Arteta's gamble paid off after an early shock when Jean-Philippe Mateta punished weak defending from Jakub Kiwior to put Palace ahead in the fourth minute.But Jesus equalised with a composed chipped finish in the 54th minute before lashing Arsenal in front after narrowly beating the offside trap in the 73rd minute.Jesus sealed his treble with another clinical effort in the 81st minute and former Arsenal striker Eddie Nketiah's header four minutes later came too late to save Palace.""Sometimes I have this problem with a lack of goals,"" Jesus said. ""I'm working a lot in training, finishing more, putting myself in a good position. I think my hard work has paid off.""Sandro Tonali scored twice as Newcastle beat Brentford 3-1 at St James' Park.Magpies boss Eddie Howe named a full-strength side and was rewarded with a comprehensive victory that moved his club a step closer to emulating their run to the 2023 final.Newcastle, who have not won a major trophy since the 1969 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, took the lead through Tonali's fine finish from the edge of the area in the ninth minute.The Italian midfielder netted again two minutes before half-time and Fabian Schar tapped in after 69 minutes.Yoane Wissa's stoppage-time strike was little consolation for Brentford.The last quarter-final sees Tottenham host Manchester United on Thursday.",Liverpool beat Southampton 2-1 to reach League Cup semi-finals.

'Anxious' Ancelotti makes more history

Doha: Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Junior both scored as Real Madrid cruised to a 3-0 victory over Mexican side Pachuca in the Intercontinental Cup final in Doha on Wednesday.Mbappe opened the scoring in the 37th minute before Rodrygo doubled Madrid's lead early in the second half. Vinicius sealed a comfortable win for the Spanish and European champions with a late penalty.France striker Mbappe returned to the Madrid line-up in Doha after missing Saturday's 3-3 draw with Rayo Vallecano due to a hamstring injury suffered in the Champions League win at Atalanta last week.Mbappe swept in from close range to break the deadlock after brilliant play from Vinicius Junior, who won the FIFA Best men's player of the year award a day earlier after missing out on the Ballon d'Or Former West Brom and Newcastle forward Salomon Rondon led the attack for CONCACAF Champions Cup winners Pachuca, but they never truly looked capable of an upset and Rodrygo's fine curling strike from the edge of the area put Madrid in total control.It was allowed to stand after the referee consulted the pitchside monitor even though Jude Bellingham was in an offside position and appeared to be interfering with the goalkeeper's line of vision.Vinicius added a third from the penalty spot six minutes from time following another VAR review after Lucas Vazquez was chopped down in the Pachuca box.""We knew that after a long trip and playing just one game it's hard. We struggled at the beginning, but we adapted well,"" Madrid midfielder Fede Valverde told Spanish television channel Telecinco.It is Madrid's second title of the season following their UEFA Super Cup triumph over Atalanta in August, a welcome boost after what coach Carlo Ancelotti admitted had been a difficult period.""In this part of the season I was a bit anxious because I didn't like the team, honestly, but this will change in 2025 I'm sure,"" said Ancelotti.""It's important for us to get to Christmas alive. If we think about the team after the defeat by Milan (in the Champions League on November 5), I think we've grown a lot and that gives us confidence for 2025.""Ancelotti won his 15th trophy as Madrid coach, moving him past Miguel Munoz for the most in the club's history.""It's a nice moment. It's an honour for me. Madrid are the club that everybody wants to coach because they're the best club in the world,"" said Ancelotti.""It's easier than winning them in other places because you have a great team and fanbase.""This was the first edition of the FIFA-backed Intercontinental Cup, which broadly maintains the previous format of the Club World Cup and features the six continental champions.The latter is being expanded to include 32 teams in 2025 and will now be played every four years.

Andre Agassi

believes Djokovic will miss Federer & Nadal, the guys he came to the dance with

Excerpts:

Djokovic's longevity:

Andy Murray coaching Djokovic:

Carlos Alcaraz

and longevity…

American men haven't had results like the women:

Graf was the hardest victory I ever had: Agassi

BENGALURU: Andre Agassi wondered if the 24-time major winner Novak Djokovic would miss his greatest rivals -- the now-retired Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer -- in the last leg of a glittering career where the 37-year-old goes for more history.The eight-time Grand Slam champion, in the city for the TiE Global Summit, assessed Djokovic's run and the Serb's recent partnership with friend and rival Andy Murray in a candid chat with media.It's hard to say, Father Time always wins. He has already done so much for so long, it's hard to imagine longer. We said that about (Roger) Federer too. I think Novak will run out of energy more than capability. Cannot be easy, especially when the people you came to the dance with have left, that's a big thing.When Pete (Sampras) retired it was a blow to me, it set me back a little bit. It made me rediscover my inspirations on some level. Djokovic has lost the guys he made history with. It'll probably get tougher and tougher emotionally, but I would never bet against them. Bet against them at your peril.In any coach-student relationship you need trust and trust can take time, but it's nice when it starts with believing in somebody because you know that they know your experience. There's an asset to their history as competitors.Any success of a relationship is based on complete buy-in and that's always the part you have to wait and see. It's not what I know that changes your career, information doesn't lead to transformation, somebody has to counter that. That's the connector. I'm sure there's going to be a lot of trust immediately, we'll see how the results go.Alcaraz defends like Novak, has more power and spin like Nadal, hands and finesse like Federer but just because he has the best of all the three doesn't mean he can do what they did. There are so many parts to the game such as decision-making, injuries, luck. So how long can (Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner) do it (for)? They could do it for 20 years or not.The women's game hasn't had to deal with Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, Rafael, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, but they have their version of it. Serena Williams is the Novak of the women's game and you got Coco as a potential, like Alcaraz has potential and Sinner has potential.How the game evolves is interesting. The women's game has gotten very powerful, just straight power. For lack of a better example, Lindsay Davenport was powerful, tall, precise through the court and now you have a lot of that. There's still room for somebody who can offset that kind of power, like an Ash Barty.The men's game has changed in the sense that guys have gotten bigger with longer levers, which means they're better athletes, they can move and they need more time, they start playing further back. Soon you're going to start seeing the net game start coming back, everything morphs in its own way. But the biggest issue for American (men) not winning is an unfortunate set of decades where the guys were very stingy and very greedy -- 66 Grand Slams in the same generation. There's not a lot left there (for others)!Andre Agassi - the second of five men to achieve a career Grand Slam in the Open Era and the first man to complete a career golden slam - has won it all, including a stirring love match.""She was the hardest victory I ever had,"" said Agassi of his wife German tennis legend Steffi Graf, a 22-time major winner.Agassi, who has won eight major titles and the Olympic gold, speaking during a session at the TiE Global Summit, said, ""We all live a hero's journey - first part of life is about performing and achieving. Then life hits us with broken relationships and dreams. I went through it all. Finally, in the last phase of the journey, it's about serving others.""The 54-year-old said, ""At 28 my (tennis) career started over. Without the struggles, I would've never gotten Steffi to say yes. I tried to get her for years.""On a lighter note, Agassi said he likes to keep his trophies out of the house.

NEW DELHI: Legendary player Andre Agassi observed that Carlos Alcaraz embodies distinct qualities from Novak Djokovic Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal , while advising the tennis world against anticipating the young Spaniard to match the extraordinary achievements of these tennis legends.The collective Grand Slam victories of Federer, Nadal and Djokovic stand at 66, whilst Alcaraz, aged 21, has secured four major titles thus far.""I'm not a genius and I don't have a crystal ball. What I can tell you is Alcaraz defends like Novak, has power and spin like Nadal and has hands and finesse like Federer,"" said Agassi during a talk session in Bengaluru.The eight-time Grand Slam victor Agassi elaborated on why excessive expectations shouldn't burden Alcaraz.""Just because he has the best of all those three doesn't mean he can do what they did because there're so many other parts to the game, which mean decision-making, injuries, you know, luck,"" he said.With Djokovic at 37, approaching retirement, Agassi noted that the Serbian's competitive edge might diminish without Nadal and Federer in the arena.""He's already done so much, so long, and it's hard to imagine longer. I think he'll run out of the energy for it more than the capability of it, I would imagine.""It cannot be easy, especially when the people you came to the dance with have left.""The American provided additional context to his assessment.""When Pete (Sampras) retired, it was a blow to me. It set me back a little bit. It made me have to rediscover my inspirations on some level.""And he's (Djokovic) lost the guys that he's made history with. So, it's probably emotionally going to get tougher and tougher quickly, but I would never bet against him. Bet against him at your own peril,"" said Agassi.Regarding Djokovic's recent appointment of Andy Murray as coach to extend his career, Agassi expressed interest in their partnership's development.""They've been fierce rivals on court, and now Murray will be coaching Djokovic. Well, in any coaching student relationship, you need trust. Trust can take time.""I think there's an asset to their history as competitors, but any success of a relationship is based on complete buy-in.""",Andre Agassi says Carlos Alcaraz embodies distinct qualities from Novak Djokovic Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal.
