The art of listening in a noisy world,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-art-of-listening-in-a-noisy-world/articleshow/127273399.cms,"Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres. Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece. I was at the wedding ceremony of a relative. One of those rare weddings with an early morning muhurtham , where brunch is still an hour away. Relatives who otherwise communicate only through forwarded messages on WhatsApp, slowly formed a circle. There was genuine warmth, laughter and enquiries . Then a teenager murmured an alert, almost like a warning: “Manju aunty.” Half the teenagers vanished with remarkable coordination. Manju aunty is, by all accounts, a loving and well-meaning person. The problem is volume—of words. Excessive talking would be an understatement. It is as though God, while assembling her, forgot to install a filter between thought and speech. She joined the circle, entirely unmindful of the sudden stillness. Her eyes landed on a teenage girl who had not escaped in time. Turning to the girl’s mother, she asked loudly, “Did you forget to feed her? Why is she so thin? Does she think this is some fashion?” Without waiting for an answer, she launched into how well she had fed her own daughter—and how that, naturally, led to a smooth ‘ normal delivery’ . The women who had undergone caesarean sections shifted uncomfortably, eyes lowered, dignity bruised in silence . Her gaze then fell on a Class IV boy and asked his rank in class. When the boy replied there was no ranking system anymore, she smiled indulgently and explained how her son always stood first though, thanks to her strict control. As her words poured out, relentless as autumn leaves falling from a tree, the gathering began to dissolve. Someone urgently needed the restroom. Someone else had to check on their child. A phone rang. Soon, only Manju aunty remained, speaking uninterrupted, and an elderly grandmother who could not hear a word anyway. We have all met Manju aunties in our lives. People who love to talk. When they call you, you immediately panic. If you pick up, your next 20 minutes is gone. If you don’t, you will have to hear about the habit of not answering calls the next time you meet. One thing often common among such persistent speakers is judgement. An unspoken “I know better” . What they lose—without realising it—is the chance to learn. Listening is not merely waiting for one’s turn to speak; it is an act of humility. Wisdom often arrives softly. It does not shout to be heard. Silence, contrary to popular belief, is not emptiness. It is strategy. The silent observer learns far more about the one who speaks without pause than the speaker ever learns about the listener. That is why Plato observed, “Wise men speak when they have something to say; fools speak because they have to say something.” The world today celebrates constant expression—opinions aired instantly; reactions broadcast without reflection. Yet the power lies not in saying everything, but in knowing what deserves to be said. Thiruvalluvar captured this with disarming simplicity: “Solluga sollir payanuḍaiya; Sollarka Sollil payanillach chol.” If speak you will, speak words that are fruitful; If speak you will, speak never fruitless words. The Kural does not glorify silence blindly. It demands responsibility from speech. Words must justify themselves. If they wound, belittle, inflate ego, or merely fill space, silence would have served better.","The Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.

10 Army Personnel Killed as Vehicle Falls into 200-Foot Gorge in J&K’s Doda

(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: In a significant breakthrough, security forces on Friday neutralised a top Pakistani terrorist of the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) outfit in an encounter in Kathua district, police said.""A Pakistani Jaish terrorist has been neutralised by a small JKP team in a joint operation with the Army and CRPF in the general area of Billawar,"" IGP Jammu posted on X.“Acting on specific intelligence inputs, a joint operation was launched by the Army and Police on January 23 in the general area of Parhetar. The area was cordoned and contact established. In a precise strike by the joint forces, one foreign terrorist has been eliminated,” the Army’s Rising Star Corps said in a separate post.It added that search operations were ongoing at the time of the last reports.Officials identified the deceased terrorist as JeM commander Usman, also known as ""Abu Maviya."" A large quantity of arms and ammunition, including an M4 automatic rifle, was recovered from him during the operation in a remote village in the Parhetar area.Usman was one of the most wanted JeM terrorists active in the Udhampur-Kathua belt for the past two years after infiltrating into India from across the border.He had escaped several previous encounters, the latest being on January 7 and 13 in the Kahog and Najote forests, respectively.Meanwhile, security forces continue a separate anti-terror operation to hunt down three JeM terrorists in Sonnar, Mandral-Singhpora, and adjoining forest areas in the Chatroo belt of Kishtwar district for the sixth consecutive day on Friday.Named by the Army as ‘Operation Trashi-I’, the mission was launched on January 18. The gunfight has so far claimed one paratrooper’s life, while seven soldiers were injured, primarily due to splinter injuries caused by a sudden grenade attack by the hiding terrorists.After a four-day lull, another encounter took place on Thursday, but the terrorists managed to escape, taking advantage of thick vegetation and challenging terrain.Operations have been further intensified ahead of Republic Day to ensure peaceful celebrations, amid intelligence inputs about attempts by Pakistan-based handlers to push more terrorists into the region","Officials identified the deceased terrorist as JeM commander Usman, also known as ""Abu Maviya"" A large quantity of arms and ammunition, including an M4 automatic rifle, was recovered from him during the operation in the Parhetar area.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127280107,imgsize-64684,width-400,resizemode-4/kathua-jammu-and-kashmir-jan-22-ani-security-personnel-conduct-checks-ahea.jpg"
"Blue room, broken wall: Clues from 10-year-old help nab rape accused",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/blue-room-broken-wall-clues-from-10-year-old-help-nab-rape-accused/articleshow/127340969.cms,"Representative file image

NEW DELHI: A pair of abandoned slippers and a gap in a broken stone wall leading into a forested ridge helped police crack the case of a 10-year-old girl’s sexual assault in central Delhi’s Prasad Nagar. The child was allegedly abducted, raped and left unconscious in the secluded area by an e-rickshaw driver.In the absence of a name or registration number, investigators said they relied entirely on the visual identification of a red e-ricks-haw with a white roof. TOI had earlier reported the incident, which took place on Jan 11, and the arrest made on Jan 14. Fresh details have since emerged about the investigation that led police to the suspect. The survivor has since been discharged following medical treatment and counselling.The investigation began on Jan 11, when the girl — who supports her family by selling flowers at traffic signals — was brought to a hospital with injuries. She told police she was lured by an e-rickshaw driver on the pretext of being offered tea and taken to a forest patch. Despite being disoriented, she recalled fragments of her surroundings—a “blue-painted room” and a “broken entry point”—providing police with their first lead.DCP (Central) Anant Mittal formed three teams to crack the case. They scanned a 20-sq-km radius, manually inspecting 22 locations with similar features and analysing CCTV footage.The breakthrough came when police examined CCTV footage from Professor Ram Nath Vij Marg, which matched the details shared by the girl. On a deserted stretch of the ridge, officers found a broken stone wall leading to a small structure. The recovery of the girl’s slippers confirmed the crime scene, allowing forensic teams to reconstruct the route taken by the accused between 11 pm and 1 am.“Alongside the ground search, a second team scanned footage from over 100 CCTV cameras. A key lead emerged when a camera recorded a red e-rickshaw with a white roof carrying the minor. Based on this visual, a third team searched e-rickshaw stands in Karol Bagh and Rajendra Place,” a senior officer said.Photographs of suspected drivers were circulated among investigators until the vehicle was traced near a petrol pump in Rajendra Place. Police later spotted a man matching the victim’s description approaching the vehicle. He attempted to flee on noticing the police presence but was chased down and apprehended.The suspect, identified as Durgesh, 25, from Farrukhabad in Uttar Pradesh, later led police to the recovery of blood-stained clothes.","A pair of abandoned slippers and a gap in a broken stone wall helped police crack the case of a 10-year-old girl’s sexual assault in central Delhi.

77th Republic Day Parade to Witness Debut of DRDO’s Hypersonic Anti-Ship Missile

.

NEW DELHI: At the Rashtriya Rangshala Camp in Delhi Cantonment, the days leading up to Jan 26 are marked by constant activity. The smell of fresh paint hangs heavy in the air as the sound of construction echo across the parade ground. Artisans climb makeshift stairways, painters add final touches and workers carefully align massive structures.Amid this controlled bustle, Republic Day tableaux are taking shape, with every frame, colour and detail preparing to tell captivating stories on Kartavya Path.This year's Jan 26 parade marks 150 years of Vande Mataram, and its spirit runs through every creation. On Thursday, TOI witnessed around 30 tableaux in different stages of completion, each reflecting India's past, present and its aspirations. Nearly 10,000 people will soon watch them roll along Kartavya Path, while 2,500 artistes are set to perform, capping the visual spectacle on wheels.One of the most striking displays is a tableau titled 'Operation Sindoor: Victory Through Jointness', which highlights India's military strength, with Rafale jets and Akash missiles on display. Nearby, Gujarat's tableau traces the journey of India from 1906 to 1947 under the theme of 'Vande Mataram', its structure anchored by a towering figure of Mahatma Gandhi.Delhi's tableau pays tribute to the Prime Ministers' Museum while showcasing the capital's transformed skyline, featuring the new Parliament, Bharat Mandapam, Signature Bridge and Yashobhoomi as symbols of a changing nation.Other states, too, have brought their landscapes and legacies vividly to life. Bihar's tableau follows the journey of makhana - from pond to plate. ""It took one month to make this whole thing,"" a carpenter said. Himachal Pradesh is honouring its 1,203 gallantry award winners and Punjab is reflecting the spiritual courage of Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur through their tableaux.Ladakh showcases the engineering feat of Shyok Tunnel, Uttarakhand displays its traditional instruments and utensils, while J&K recreates the charm of a houseboat. Dancers from Tamil Nadu will perform mayilattam, also known as peacock dance. ""A team of 17 members is here from Chennai to perform,"" said Jyotsana, adjusting her costume with a smile. Parasmal Solanki from Rajasthan will perform along with his 16-member team.Nagaland's tableau features a massive hornbill. ""We want everyone to know about Hornbill Festival,"" said Yangerla, a folk dancer. Jharkhand's tableau showcases the state's natural beauty and aims at attracting tourists, said Neha Agarwal, a state representative.Karnataka's tableau, From Millets to Microchips, tells a story of holistic growth through scenes of a farmer family with millets, silicon crystals, a robot and a giant microchip - linking agriculture with technology and innovation. Assam has transformed terracotta into visual poetry. Chhattisgarh's tableau pays homage to tribal heroes like Veer Gunda Dhur and Veer Narayan Singh.Union ministries have added their own narratives. The education tableau traces the evolution of India's knowledge from Aryabhatta's shunya (zero) to PM Shri schools. ""All my team members and I are from different Kendriya Vidyalayas,"" said Elix Singh, a Class XI student.A unique tableau designed by filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali for the ministry of information and broadcasting depicts the evolution of storytelling - from its oral tradition to cinema. The panchayati raj tableau in the vicinity highlights the SVAMITA scheme.On Republic Day, these individual pieces will come together to form a moving portrait of India, diverse in expression and united in purpose.","This year's Jan 26 parade marks 150 years of Vande Mataram, and its spirit runs through every creation.

Triple talaq-halala FIR puts focus on legal grey area,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/triple-talaq-halala-fir-puts-focus-on-legal-grey-area/articleshow/127206877.cms,".

NEW DELHI: When police in UP registered an FIR on Dec 9, 2025, it was not just another complaint under the 2019 Triple Talaq law. The allegations were shocking and went further, into a grey zone the law has never squarely addressed: What happens to women after talaq is pronounced.According to the FIR filed in Amroha’s Said Nagli, the woman, after being divorced through instant triple talaq, was pressured by her husband, her brother-in-law and clerics to undergo “ halala ” multiple times so she could be returned to the marriage. An exception that permits a divorced Muslim couple to remarry, the practice of halala often involves planned, short-term marriages — even arranged one-time encounters — to facilitate consummation of the woman with another man, enabling the former couple to reunite.The woman’s complaint detailed the ordeal. She said she was “gang-raped under false pretenses of halala carried out under threats, intimidation and coercion”.Police have invoked the law banning instant triple talaq — sections 3 and 4 of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019. Multiple provisions and relevant sections of BNS that deal with rape, aggravated hurt, criminal intimidation and criminal conspiracy, have also been added.In the initial FIR, there are three accused: Her husband, his cousin and a hakim (traditional healer.) Since then, police have added more accused to the list.Amroha police told TOI that one accused — her husband — had been arrested so far. “The FIR has been registered on the basis of a written complaint. Further action will depend on corroboration and evidence,” SHO Vikas Sahrawat said. Amroha police are on the lookout for others on the run, he added.This week, based on Zubaida’s (name changed) age at the time of her marriage, police added multiple provisions of the Pocso Act to the FIR, expanding its scope. (The move, incidentally, also brings into focus an unresolved legal grey area, as Muslim personal law is not codified and does not prescribe a minimum age, instead linking marriageability to puberty. The issue remains unsettled by the Supreme Court so far, with courts in different states taking conflicting positions. )The FIR covers several years of alleged abuse, assault and rape. Zubeida told police she was forcefully married off in 2015 at the age of 15, and subjected to pronouncements of instant triple talaq twice — once in 2016, and again in 2021, followed by three coerced reconciliation attempts through halala.“I felt like I was being handed over every time. I was too ashamed to come out with what had happened to me. I didn’t want my daughter to grow up reading about it,” Zubaida told TOI. A former student of one of Aligarh’s top schools, Zubaida comes from a family with a history in public service — her grandfather was DSP in UP police and her father a lawyer.After the first triple talaq in 2016, she said she was told she could return to her husband only after undergoing halala, a process that, according to her complaint, involved sexual assault by someone introduced as an “intermediary”.In Feb 2025, she said she was told she would need to follow the halala process twice as her marriage had broken down twice by then. Zubaida’s complaint said after years of being a single mother and financial difficulties, she had once again fallen for the accused’s false promise of remarriage. “It was after a long time that I realised what had happened to me was wrong,” Zubaida said.With her husband now behind bars, Zubaida said she was struggling to keep life going for her daughter.Her husband, meanwhile, has alleged that he was harassed and threatened by Zubaida and her relatives. In his written complaint, dated Nov 26, 2025, he claimed that Zubaida “tried to forcibly enter his house and threatened him with false criminal cases”.Earlier in 2021, according to documents, Zubaida’s divorce was finalised through a family court’s decree, with the court placing the daughter’s custody with the father at the time.Halala finds no mention in Indian statutory law. The 2019 Muslim Women Act criminalised instant triple talaq, making its pronouncement a punishable offence, but it did not — and does not — recognise halala.According to activists, halala cases rarely leave a paper trail. Fear of stigma, economic dependence and concerns about children often keep victims silent.“In many cases, women don’t even know that what is being done to them is wrong,” said Zakia Soman, Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan founder. “Halala is not mentioned in the Quran. It survives through misinterpretation, patriarchal control and silence. There is a hush-hush around it. For a woman to come forward takes extraordinary courage.”Soman added that the practice survived in pockets, operating through informal and largely invisible set-ups. “Triple talaq was criminalised on paper, but the ecosystem that sustained it was never dismantled. Without regulations, halala survives as an unpoliced, underground arrangement,” she said.Soman cited cases where clerics themselves offered to “perform” halala, and others where women were passed between men to settle personal disputes, family feuds or even debts — arrangements that remain largely hidden unless a woman breaks ranks and approaches the police. Soman said practices such as halala, child marriage and puberty-as-marriage-age thrive in a legal grey zone.Experts point to structural gaps that make such cases hard to prosecute. One is the absence of mandatory registration of Muslim marriages and divorces. “Nikahs are largely undocumented,” said Naish Hasan, a Lucknow-based activist who has worked with halala survivors for over two decades. “When there is no paper trail, the burden of proof falls entirely on women.”She said the practice remained alive, particularly among poor and marginalised women. “For years, cases kept surfacing before we even had language for it,” she said.Hasan said her fieldwork included around 40 detailed case studies from Lucknow district alone. “Justice should reach every last woman,” she added. Petitions challenging the practice of halala, including one filed by Hasan in 2021, have been pe-nding before Supreme Court.","Police in Amroha, UP, have invoked the law banning instant triple talaq.

‘Grand master’ banners hail CM Devendra Fadnavis after BJP’s record 57 corporators in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/grand-master-banners-hail-fadnavis-after-bjps-record-57-corporators-in-chhatrapati-sambhajinagar/articleshow/127324988.cms,"Devendra Fadnavis Says BJP Created History in Maharashtra Civic Elections







CHHATRAPATI SAMBHAJINAGAR: Riding high on its best-ever performance in the Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar Municipal Corporation elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has signalled a decisive shift in the region's political landscape.Across the city, banners have appeared projecting chief minister Devendra Fadnavis as a political ""grandmaster,"" celebrating the party's newfound dominance.The BJP clinched 57 seats, its highest-ever tally in the city — a result party leaders are calling a landmark moment for its expansion into the Marathwada region.The banners, largely credited to BAMU management council member Basavraj Mangrule, feature a stylised, likely AI-generated image of Fadnavis against a backdrop of chess pieces. In the visual, Fadnavis is shown making a winning move by holding the king, symbolically suggesting a ""checkmate"" of his political opponents. The creative messaging has sparked widespread discussion in political circles, underscoring the surge of confidence within the BJP camp.The victory is strategically significant. Currently, the BJP holds two of the three assembly seats within city limits: Atul Save (Aurangabad East), who serves as the minister for OBC welfare and housing, and the party's growing grassroots network.While the Shiv Sena (Shinde faction) holds the Aurangabad West seat via district Guardian Minister Sanjay Shirsat and the Lok Sabha seat via Sandipan Bhumare, the civic poll results suggest the BJP is gaining significant ground on its ally.Historically, the Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar civic body was the fortress of the Shiv Sena. For decades, the Sena positioned itself as the ""big brother"" in seat-sharing arrangements, routinely contesting and winning the lion's share of seats while the BJP played a secondary role. However, this election — the first since the Shiv Sena split — upended that traditional hierarchy.Negotiations for a pre-poll alliance between the BJP and chief minister Eknath Shinde's Shiv Sena collapsed after several rounds of talks, forcing the allies to contest independently. The outcome proved sobering for the Shinde-led Sena; despite contesting 97 seats, it secured only 13. The result was a major jolt for the party, which had entered the fray confident of emerging as the single largest force.The setback was even more severe for the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena (UBT). Contesting 99 seats, the party managed to win only six — its worst performance in the region since it first entered the municipal corporation in 1988 with 28 seats.By contrast, the BJP's jump to 57 seats has firmly established it as the single largest party, fundamentally reshaping the city's political equations ahead of future assembly and general elections.","The BJP clinched 57 seats, its highest-ever tally in the city.

Lara Trump shares viral golfing photos with Donald Trump and granddaughter

Bill Maher Clashes With Lara Trump After She Downplays Trump’s ‘Piggy’ Insult On Air Force One

Social media responds with warmth and nostalgia

How a shared family moment cut through public tension





Lara Trump has recently bestowed upon social media participants a rare treat with a glimpse into the less familiar, more personal side of the Trump family. Through the sharing of just a few images on X, she has reached the hearts of many with this intimate family picture involving her young daughter's fun-filled golf game with her grandfather, US President Donald Trump himself, with whom she gets to spend quality time while playing their favourite game, golf. This is one instance where the family, known for its political fervour, has been accepted with such fervour not for their political ideology but for this common family experience that speaks volumes about their humanity despite their fame and power, resonating widely with audiences who cherish authentic, tender moments beyond politics.The photographs depicted Donald Trump behind the wheel of a golf cart, with his granddaughter sitting alongside him, looking happy and carefree. Moreover, there were no signs of poses or dramatic settings, only a serene capture of moments spent with each other. The informal nature of this post was a major factor that led to its success. The post was not meant for any particular message or statement, but only for a casual share by Lara Trump. The post succeeded in gathering tens of thousands of views, not because it was political or held any significance, but because it was something that was widely understood.The online response was largely positive, with many people describing the photographs as “wholesome” and “heartwarming”. Several users reflected on the special bond between grandparents and grandchildren, sharing how the images stirred personal memories and emotions. One user wrote, “What a great moment for her! My kids miss their Gramps,” while another commented, “Core memory unlocked!”, capturing the sense of nostalgia the post evoked. Others reacted more light-heartedly, with remarks such as, “Awww, I was wondering what Grandpa Trump was up to today!” and “Cutest thing I have seen all day.”Part of the post’s impact lay in its timing and tone. At a moment when public discourse is often polarised, the photographs presented a version of public life stripped of commentary and conflict. They highlighted how figures who dominate global headlines also occupy familiar family roles, such as grandparents enjoying simple moments with their loved ones.","Lara Trump has shared intimate family photos on social media.

Shivam Dube press conference: On Ishan and Surya’s knock & his role with the ball

RAIPUR: Two months ago, Ishan Kishan was nowhere close to getting into the Indian team. A little over a month ago, he brought himself back into contention after guiding Jharkhand to their maiden Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy title and finishing as the top-scorer in the tournament with a century in the final. The showing convinced selectors to include him in the T20 World Cup team. Luck continued to shine on the left-hander when he was slotted in at No. 3 in place of Tilak Varma, who was ruled out of the first three matches of the T20I series due to injury.While he failed in the opening match in Nagpur, on Friday, he displayed why he is one of the fiercest hitters of a cricket ball in the country. By the time the 27-year-old was done with his fireworks, he had hammered a 32-ball 76 with the help of 11 fours and four sixes, as India made a mockery of the 209-run target by chasing it down with seven wickets in hand and 4.4 overs to spare.On his way back, skipper Suryakumar, who was enjoying the blitzkrieg from the other end, acknowledged the effort put in by his former Mumbai Indians teammate by giving him a hug on his way back to the dugout. His seventh T20I halfcentury came at a strike rate of 237.5.India were in deep trouble when openers Sanju Samson and Abhishek Sharma were back in the pavilion in the first seven balls. But Kishan straightaway counterattacked to reverse the pressure on the Kiwi bowlers.Kishan and Suryakumar (82*, 37b; 9x4, 4x6) shared a 49-ball 122-run stand for the third wicket, and by the time the former’s innings ended in the 10th over, when Ish Sodhi dismissed him, the required run rate was below eight runs per over.Thereafter, India applied the finishing touches to take a 2-0 lead, and Suryakumar and Shivam Dube did exactly that with their unbroken 37-ball 81-run association for the fourth wicket to see the Men in Blue through. It was Suryakumar’s first halfcentury since the 75 he scored against Bangladesh in Hyderabad in Oct 2024. Dube played his part to perfection with his 18-ball 36.Earlier, New Zealand got off to a flying start, but the Indian bowling unit pegged them back with some smart bowling.

Poll Which league do you think provides a better fan experience? Indian Premier League (IPL) SA20 League Both are equally great Neither provides a good experience

Former South Africa cricketers, who have become ambassadors of the SA20, don't hesitate from acknowledging that the Indian Premier League (IPL) is the big fish in franchise T20 cricket . The economics would clarify that the IPL is the big blue whale.Joburg Super Kings captain Faf du Plessis had said ahead of the fourth edition, “If you speak to someone like Graeme Smith (SA20 League Commissioner), they would say to you that they’re always learning from the IPL and the way that they’ve taken the 15 years of setting up a world-class league. Certainly, we as the players can feel that.”On the ground, there is plenty for the IPL to learn from SA20, too. Having been to IPL games across the country and to the SA20 for two seasons now, the fan experience is staggeringly different.On Friday, as Sunrisers Eastern Cape took on Paarl Royals at the Wanderers in Johannesburg in Qualifier 2, I decided to take in the experience, not from the press box but from the grass embankments - just as droves of locals do.An hour before the 5pm toss, crowd was still trickling in as the weekend approached. The sun was out in full force but the heat wasn't harsh. The security stationed outside the 'Bullring' had conveniently blocked sections of the street and made things easier for fans to walk to the stadium.As the sun started to fade and the toss started to get closer, the sheer volume of people grew in numbers. Just like other venues in South Africa, families, kids, teenagers, youngsters were all out in attendance. People arrived with their picnic baskets, mats, lawn chairs, some even with cushion seats. That, after all, is part of the experience - something you don't get in most countries.With the contest still to start, there were extensive queues outside the multiple food and drink shops. To ensure there is no excessive crowding at one place, the food trucks and pop-up drink shops have been spread out throughout the complex.This reporter walked across and queued up for drinks - one of the refreshing alcoholic beverages unavailable in India - coupled with a Portuguese Prego Roll. (Fun fact: South Africa is home to one of the world's largest Portuguese diaspora communities!)With the drink and food in tow, I made my way to one of the entrances for the grassed areas. Considering I was late to this adventure, the prime spaces had filled up. Large swathes of space were occupied by families and youngsters who had come in big groups. Still, there was a tiny bit of space left for me.The experience and vibe was electric! Even though Paarl Royals scored just 114 and Sunrisers Eastern Cape chased it down with 50 balls to spare, every boundary, six and wicket was cheered in good volume.The chances for fans to pluck a single-handed catch in the stands, for a chance to throw their hat into the ring for a hefty R2 million (Rs 1.13 crore) prize, was reduced to just seven. When the sixes did come, the fans tried their best to hold on but it never materialised. Unfortunately for this reporter, there was no such luck either.Even when the action underwhelmed, the stadium DJ ensured the crowd remained active by playing some singalong classics such as Bon Jovi's Livin' on a Prayer and Carly Rae Jepsen's Call Me Maybe. The innovative on-screen fan activities - face morphing and kiss cam to name just two - added another layer of entertainment.The cricket might have underwhelmed with Paarl Royals struggling to string together partnerships and Sunrisers Eastern Cape progressing to their fourth consecutive SA20 final, but the crowd didn't care all that much. Having enjoyed an evening of cricket the way the locals do, neither did I.","Sunrisers Eastern Cape took on Paarl Royals at the Wanderers in Johannesburg in Qualifier 2.

Sunrisers Eastern Cape:

Sunrisers Eastern Cape stormed into their fourth successive SA20 final to set up a rematch with Pretoria Capitals at Newlands on Sunday.The two-time champions comfortably chased down Royals’ 114/7 with seven wickets in hand and 50 balls to spare.Young Englishman James Coles led the way with another superb all-round performance. Coles snared 1/15 from his four overs of off-spin before breaking the back of the run chase with an unbeaten 45 off just 19 balls.On a surface where few batters could counter the prodigious turn and bounce on offer, Coles targeted Dan Lawrence’s first over by smashing 21 runs to bite a chunk out of the target.Coles shared an unbroken 65-run partnership with Matthew Breetzke (19 not out) to seal the Royals’ fate after Quinton de Kock had blitzed a rapid 25 off just 12 balls upfront.The 21-year-old had earlier combined perfectly with Senuran Muthusamy (3/15) to set up the game for Sunrisers.The spin twins claimed four wickets for 30 runs from their allotted eight overs to restrict the Royals.It was a struggle from the outset for the Royals after stand-in captain Dan Lawrence won the toss and elected to bat.Lhuan-dre Pretorius could not build on his form from the Eliminator and fell early when he chipped seamer Lutho Sipamla to Sunrisers Eastern Cape captain Tristan Stubbs at mid-off.From then on, it was a battle for survival, with Kyle Verreynne laying down the anchor as wickets continued to fall regularly at the other end.Verreynne carried his bat for a workmanlike 52 not out off 46 balls but had precious little support from the remaining Royals batters as Sunrisers’ spinners put the squeeze on.Royals’ West Indian import Rovman Powell, who arrived in South Africa only a couple of days ago, could not make an impact, lasting just two balls before Muthusamy found his outside edge.Sunrisers’ seven-wicket win has set up a repeat of the inaugural SA20 Final back in 2023.Adrian Birrell’s team will be seeking to reclaim the trophy they surrendered to MI Cape Town last season in a bid for an unprecedented third title, while the Capitals will be aiming to win the trophy for the first time.The two sides have met three times already this season, with the Sunrisers holding the advantage 2-1.114 for 7 in 20 overs (Kye Verreynne 52 not out; Senuran Muthusamy 3/15, Anrich Nortje 2/31, James Coles 1/15)117 for 3 in 11.4 overs (James Coles 45 not out, Quinton de Kock 25; Bjorn Fortuin 2/26)",Sunrisers Eastern Cape beat Paarl Royals by seven wickets to reach SA20 final.

NBA YoungBoy reportedly frustrated after Kai Cenat ignores outreach





DJ Akademiks has added new details to the ongoing drama involving Kai Cenat, NBA YoungBoy, and rumors of an alleged affair. Speaking on stream, Akademiks claimed that NBA YoungBoy personally attempted to reach out to Kai Cenat to clear his name after online speculation linked him to Kai’s ex-girlfriend, Gigi Alayah. According to Akademiks, Kai did not respond to the outreach, which has left NBA YoungBoy’s camp frustrated. They believe the rumor has continued to spread because there was no direct conversation to shut it down early, despite YoungBoy strongly denying any involvement.The controversy began shortly after Kai Cenat announced his breakup on December 27, 2025, posting online that he was single and stepping away from relationships. Soon after, unverified posts started circulating on X, claiming Gigi Alayah had cheated on Kai with NBA YoungBoy. The story quickly gained traction across social media, pulling multiple high-profile names into the discussion. Gigi later responded publicly, denying the allegations and stating she ended the relationship herself, never cheated, and had no connection to NBA YoungBoy.Akademiks explained that while he is not placing blame on Kai Cenat, the lack of communication has allowed the rumor to linger.He claimed NBA YoungBoy wanted a direct conversation with Kai to deny the allegations and stop fans from associating his name with the situation. According to Akademiks, YoungBoy’s team believes the timing of the rumor was suspicious and possibly planted, especially given how quickly it spread following Kai’s breakup announcement.The rapper’s camp is reportedly unhappy because the situation continues to affect YoungBoy’s reputation, even though he has denied the claims. Akademiks urged Kai to take the call, suggesting that a private discussion could help put the issue to rest. However, as of now, no reconciliation or public clarification between the two has taken place. Fans continue to debate the situation, keeping the story alive in both hip-hop and streaming communities.For Kai Cenat, the drama occurs at a time when he has been very open and outspoken about seeking healing and personal growth after the breakup. On one hand, he may have decided to keep quiet on the rumors; nevertheless, the fact that he is keeping quiet is a big part of the debate. As long as there is no direct communication and statement between all parties involved, one will know how rumor and drama can escalate online concerning popular personalities.",NBA YoungBoy reportedly frustrated after Kai Cenat ignores outreach to clear his name.

How cool were Emmanuel Macron's sunglasses?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/how-to-buy-emmanuel-macrons-sunglasses/articleshow/127298460.cms,"‘What The Hell Macron’: Trump Mocks French President’s ‘Aviators’ During World Economic Forum

For sure. For sure

.





Albert Camus wrote in the opening lines of The Myth of Sisyphus, a must-read for anyone who feels low, or can read English: “There’s only one serious philosophical problem and that is suicide. Judging whether life is or is not worth living amounts to answering the fundamental question of philosophy. All the rest—whether or not the world has three dimensions, whether the mind has nine or twelve categories—comes afterwards.”It pains me greatly to disagree with the absurdity enthusiast, but there’s one question even more important than that: how cool were Emmanuel Macron’s sunglasses at the World Economic Forum? Say what you want about the French, they always know how to do things with style. Revolutions, republics, beheadings, exiles. Even their authoritarians have style. When Jean-Paul Sartre was arrested, Charles de Gaulle asked him to be released immediately, saying in a rather bathetic style: “One doesn’t arrest Voltaire.”All of which brings us to the current head of the Fifth Republic, Emmanuel Macron, who delivered a masterclass in French oratory with his emphasis on rule of law, standing up to bullies, and languid delivery (for sure, for sure).Yet the words coming out of his mouth were hardly as captivating as what he had on his face: a pair of Henry Jullien aviators worth 650 euros (US$750) or Rs 68,000.Even Donald Trump noticed, using his favourite words to describe them: “I watched him yesterday with those beautiful sunglasses—what the hell happened?”Macron’s office claimed it was to protect his eyes from a blood vessel; others wondered if it was another domestic tiff with his former teacher.But let’s cut to the chase. As Camus pointed out in the same essay, Galileo abjured the truth as soon as it endangered his life, because philosophical pursuits matter less than real-life questions, like: where can you get those glasses?Well all you have to do is head over to the company's temporary website.The glasses were crafted by Henry Jullien, a company founded in the Jura region of France—the Champagne region of French eyewear—that has been designing and producing high-end eyewear for a century, and like all French folks want to raise even utilatarian processes to philosophical pursuits.The company uses a technique called “doublé or” gold-laminate technology, a difficult and almost lost process where layers of pure gold are bonded to metal frames. It’s not mere plating; the gold becomes integral to the structure.Each frame is made through a rigorous artisanal process involving 279 individual steps.The impact showed up immediately in the markets. iVision Tech SpA, the Milan-listed parent company that owns Henry Jullien, saw its shares surge by nearly 28% in a single session after Emmanuel Macron’s sunglasses went viral at Davos, adding roughly €3.5 million (about $4 million) to its market capitalisation. The stock initially jumped around 6% before trading was briefly halted due to heavy volumes, and then continued climbing once trading resumed.But once Macron debuted them, the internet went berserk, crashing Henry Jullien’s website—perhaps undercutting Macron’s argument about Europe’s robust predictability. Thankfully, the French company found a workaround, setting up a temporary page and writing: “Following the significant visibility of the Pacific by Henry Jullien model, worn by President Emmanuel Macron at the Davos Forum, our eShop website is experiencing an exceptional volume of visits and enquiries. To ensure stable and secure access for everyone, we have enabled this official temporary page dedicated to purchasing the model.”So anyone who is part of the European Union can order them. If you are in any other part of the world, like the Americas or even post-Brexit UK, you will have to figure out some way to get your hands on them. Currently, the website says it will take seven days for them to be shipped.In his speech, Macron said: “…having a place like Europe, which sometimes is too slow, for sure, and needs to be reformed for sure, but which is predictable, loyal, and where, well, you know that the rule of the game is just a rule of law, it’s a good place. And I think this is a good place for today and for tomorrow.”We are not sure we agree with all that, but we do want those sunglasses.Because we imagine we would be as happy as Sisyphus wearing them.",Emmanuel Macron wore a pair of Henry Jullien aviators at the World Economic Forum.

Japan’s underwater crop circles mystery turns out to be a mating signal of this small fish,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/japans-underwater-crop-circles-mystery-turns-out-to-be-a-mating-signal-of-this-small-fish/articleshow/127275653.cms,"The strange seabed circles off Japan were built by a fish

The pufferfish constructs the circular nest

The structure matters for mating

The nests are built only once

What fluid experiments reveal about water flow

Why the discovery matters beyond curiosity





The seabed off southern Japan has long held shapes that look out of place. Divers near Amami Oshima Island began noticing large circular patterns etched into sand in the 1990s, precise enough to seem artificial. Each year, they appeared and then faded, leaving little behind except curiosity. For a long time, no clear explanation followed. Ocean currents did not fit. Geological processes fell short. Only later did close observation reveal the source, a small marine fish working patiently near the ocean floor. Research published over the past decade has shown that these structures are not accidents of nature but carefully built nests. The discovery reframed the circles, turning a quiet seabed puzzle into a story of behaviour, effort and reproduction.The circles appear on flat sandy seabeds at depths of around 25 metres. They can reach two metres across and are marked by ridges and grooves that radiate from a smooth central area. The pattern looks deliberate, almost decorative.For years, divers referred to them as mystery circles. They appeared fully formed and then slowly disappeared as currents smoothed the sand.No one saw them being made.The builder is a small male pufferfish from the genus Torquigener. Measuring roughly ten centimetres long, it looks unremarkable compared with the scale of the structures. Yet the fish uses its fins with precision, shaping sand grain by grain. This behaviour was first directly observed in 2011, solving a puzzle that had lasted more than a decade.Construction takes about a week. The male begins by marking out a rough circle, swimming back and forth to dig shallow valleys. These runs form ridges and grooves arranged like spokes. As the structure develops, the fish focuses on the centre, flattening it and collecting fine sand. In the final stage, it decorates the ridges with shell fragments and coral pieces, taken from nearby.The nest plays a role in female choice. Females only visit when the structure is complete. When one approaches, the male stirs fine sand into the water, creating a visual display. Eggs are laid in the central zone, where conditions are calmer. Studies suggest the shape of the nest helps gather fine particles and reduces water flow, creating a more stable place for eggs to develop.After spawning, the male guards the eggs for several days. During this time, the structure is not maintained. Currents gradually flatten the ridges and wash away the fine sand. Once the eggs hatch, the male leaves and does not return. Instead of repairing the old nest, it builds a new one elsewhere. Researchers believe the loss of fine sand makes reuse inefficient.To understand how the nest works, scientists tested scaled models in flowing water. The results showed that water slows in the central area while moving differently through the valleys. This reduction in current speed, measured at over 20%, likely protects eggs. It also explains why fine sand gathers in the middle rather than being swept away.The pufferfish circles add to evidence that sexual selection can drive complex construction behaviour in fish. While such traits are well studied in birds and insects, fewer examples exist underwater. Here, the structure serves both as a signal and a functional shelter. It is built at a high cost, abandoned quickly, and repeated cycle after cycle.On the seabed, the circles come and go. Above them, the ocean looks unchanged.","Divers near Amami Oshima Island began noticing large circular patterns etched into sand in the 1990s.

Canadian former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and pop star Katy Perry turned Davos into a very unexpected flirtatious event this week, cheekily winking at each other as the politician took the stage at the World Economic Forum The 41-year-old pop star slipped into the crowd at The Female Quotient lounge on Tuesday, keeping things low-key — until she locked eyes with the former Canadian prime minister. One wink later, Trudeau was grinning like a man who’d just won both an electionbackstage passes.In a clip shared to Instagram, Female Quotient wrote: ""The room was packed, the energy was high and Katy kept it low-key, cheering them on. A reminder that showing up matters.""Justin was joined on stage by his former Chief of Staff Katie Telford, to discuss women and under-represented voices. Katy prepared to watch the former Canadian Prime Minister discuss the importance of soft power in geopolitics.The couple, who first sparked dating rumours in July, have since forged a firm bond, frequently spotted out and about on lavish jaunts. In November, insiders told People about the couple's flourishing romance, which left both showbiz fans and politicos in shock when they went public in October in Paris.Katy and Justin's relationship debut came at her 41st birthday bash in the French capital, just days after images showed the duo enjoying a steamy boat day. The songstress announced her split from fiancé Orlando Bloom around the same time as the whispers began - something sources claim she did not 'expect'.Arriving at the event, Katy left her kooky style at the door in favour of a muted ensemble. The unlikely couple held hands as they entered the venue in the Swiss town, where other stars including Matt Damon and David Beckham were in attendance.Her chic ensemble comprised a tight skirt and cropped cardigan while her trademark raven locks were pulled into a conservative low chignon. The mother-of-one paired the look with chunky gold square earrings and a pair of oversized sunglasses while adding a splash of colour with pink lipstick.Katy looked stunning as she glammed up to throw her support behind the politician, who was being snapped by adoring viewers while giving his speech. Matt meanwhile was snapping selfies with fans while rocking a smattering of salt and pepper stubble and a smart suit and polo shirt combo, Daily Mail reported.Katy and Justin's latest jaunt was less posh eateries and more political discussions, however the stunner looked delighted to be joined by her boyfriend, with whom she previously said she is ""having a lot of fun.""Sources have now said: ""Justin keeps making a big effort to see her and she's excited about it. [She has] a lot of fun with him. It's exactly what she needs right now.""On how the relationship has changed the politician, the source added: ""He is a much happier person now. Stresses are greatly diminished. And he is intrigued with Katy. They have fun together, laugh a lot, talk about everything.""Shortly before their first outing as a couple, sources revealed Katy is 'really into' her connection with Justin, saying: ''Katy is really into it. She's very happy...""She's trying to keep it low-key, and they've spent a lot of private time together. She’s not looking to publicize this relationship.""Over the summer, representatives told Daily Mail: 'Orlando and Katy have been shifting their relationship over the past many months to focus on co-parenting....""They will continue to be seen together as a family, as their shared priority is — and always will be — raising their daughter with love, stability, and mutual respect.""","Justin Trudeau and Katy Perry attended Davos together.

Three biases that make us human,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/mind-field/three-biases-that-make-us-human/articleshow/127360356.cms,"Mindfield





Using his fortune of $200bn (2024 figures) Musk could build 1,000 Great Pyramids, writes Harvey Whitehouse in Inheritance: The Evolutionary Origins of the Modern World.Whitehouse is only prodding readers to question if ancient societies were more unequal than the modern world. The belief that democracy closed the gap between rich & poor, pharaoh & slave is untrue – today’s richest 1% own twice as much wealth as the rest of the world combined.The provocative part: At least Inca rulers who demanded human sacrifice –however misguided – claimed it served collective survival against natural disasters. Ancient cruelty at least gestured toward common good. Today’s inequality serves a tiny elite alone, no pretense. Whitehouse writes: “If Elon Musk were obliged to devote even half his fortune to tackling today’s climate crisis, imagine how much better off we would be as a global human tribe.”The global human tribe is Whitehouse’s focus in his study of societies across Asia, Africa, South America, Australasia and Melanesia. Two evolutionary processes – biological and cultural – have produced the cumulative wealth of human knowledge that defines the modern world. A combination of culturally evolved traditions and biologically evolved intuitions forms our “collective inheritance as a species.”What is distinct to human species is collective beliefs. For example, all societies in some form believe spirits are “incorporeal” but have minds that “allow them to emote, remember, understand.”Our closest primate relatives “do not conjure up a world in which spirits of the dead demand to be fed, placated, or petitioned for assistance.” Yet across societies, such ideas “proliferate like wildfire.”The bedrock of such evolutionary processes are three biases – generational bias for conformism, a religiosity bias that has little to do with god, and tribalism. To conform is human nature – copycat behaviour, compulsion to imitate, to belong or emulate. What binds groups are rituals that have meaning for the group, even if the ritual may be obscure. Rituals are all in the mind, anything to ring a group together.Religiosity bias shaped human cooperation. In cooperation lay strength that, eventually, enabled new forms of leadership via religion. From ancestor worship to inherited authority and divine kingship, humanity’s now in a period where “grip of organised religions is loosening, and new forms of religiosity are taking over, largely below the radar.”These are the advertising industry, social media and news conglomerates, who’re harnessing “natural religious intuitions” to modify behaviour. It’s how smallelites increasingly profit from “our credulity on a scale far greater than any organised religions of history.”The third bias that primes humanity is tribalism, the root of warfare. Yes, misplaced tribalism may lead to violent football fan groups or religious extremists. But, the book argues, what may still help the world is more tribalism in the development of “new forms of global tribal identity.” Tribal instincts can be tuned to the common good.Whitehouse concludes that ignoring the three biases is a missed opportunity in the fight to tackle environmental and global issues. World religions have the leadership structures and motivational base to implement action plans on climate change – Sikhs planted a million trees to mark their founder’s 550th anniversary.As for Musk, Whitehouse says, it’s hard to imagine the super-rich being reined in “not because it is impracticable, but because our routinised habits of thought make such ideas almost unthinkable.”",Inheritance: The Evolutionary Origins of the Modern World by Harvey Whitehouse is published by Simon & Schuster at £16.99.

An Indian man claimed that America's medical treatment is expensive as he had to pay $1,800 for one and the half hour visit to a hospital.In a viral video, a man, claiming to be living in the US, said that while doing ice skating with his wife and sister, his knees got injured. Instead of an ambulance, he chose a taxi because of the price.""Many people say that America is very expensive. Since I live here, let me explain with an example how expensive it really is. On the night of December 25, Christmas, we were in New York and went ice skating. I was with my wife and my sister. Someone hit my knee very hard, and the impact caused me a lot of pain. I thought I had injured my knee or maybe even fractured it. I went to the emergency room. I stayed there for about an hour and a half. I took a taxi on my own because ambulance charges here are extremely high, so calling an ambulance was out of the question. If you can walk even a little, you try to avoid it,"" the man said.""In the emergency room, they kept me for about an hour and a half. They took an X-ray, checked me, and one doctor examined me. They wrapped my knee with a crepe bandage, which is used for impact injuries and muscle pulls, and then sent me home.A week passed, then two weeks, and after three weeks my insurance informed me that I had to pay $1,800, which is more than ₹1.5 lakh. The hospital charged me $1,800 for just a one-and-a-half-hour visit. Apart from this, the insurance company paid the hospital around $4,000 to $4,500 more. And that’s why America is so expensive—and why salaries here are high,"" he added.The post ignited question regarding the expenses in the US. One of the users commented, ""1.5 hours in a New York ER. One X-ray. One crepe bandage. Bill: $6,354. Insurance steps in - patient still pays $1,800. For a country that calls itself the most powerful on earth, this kind of healthcare pricing raises a simple question: who exactly is that power meant to protect?""Another user commented, ""The healthcare in the US is advanced, but it’s brutally expensive. You can’t survive without insurance, and even then, basic things like MRIs or specialist appointments take weeks. We often assume the grass is greener on the other side, but it rarely is. In India, healthcare is far more cost-effective, but we deal with insurance scams and, at times, questionable competence and accountability among doctors. Every system has trade-offs. No country has cracked it perfectly.""A user said, ""Welcome to American healthcare 2025 edition $6,354 for 1.5 hours, one X-ray + a crepe bandage… and still $1,800 out-of-pocket after “good” insurance. Meanwhile in India: same thing would probably cost ₹1,000–3,000 max (including consultation + medicine), and no one would bat an eye. In Canada (single-payer): free at point of service, wait might be longer but no surprise $2k bill. The real injury here isn't the knee — it's the wallet. US system really excels at one thing: turning minor injuries into major financial trauma.""","Indian man claims he had to pay $1,800 for one and a half hour visit to a hospital.

How fake reports distorted IShowSpeed’s Lagos visit





Some rumours spread faster than the truth via the internet, and this is particularly applicable to a world internet celebrity. Within the last day, the news media inundated timelines with frightening information on how social media streamer, IShowSpeed had been attacked and robbed during his trip to Lagos. Pictures of seemingly facial injuries went viral, and the posts were reinforced by algorithmic posts that erased distinctions between speculation and reality.But the narrative did not hold up under scrutiny. Full footage from Speed’s Lagos livestream remains publicly available, showing him interacting with fans, moving through the city, and enjoying nightlife without any sign of harm. The supposed evidence behind the claims came from edited screenshots and AI-generated summaries, not verified reporting or eyewitness accounts.The viral pictures showing injuries were tracked down to the purposefully manipulated stills, obtained in the livestream of Speed and modified to highlight imaginary facial marks. At the very time when the fake posts appear, the streamer may be captured enjoying the attention of the fans, laughing and communicating with them.One AI-generated tweet claimed, “IshowSpeed was allegedly attacked and robbed by road gangsters while livestreaming on Ikoyi Road in Lagos, Nigeria , resulting in a facial injury. He announced plans to leave Nigeria immediately and never return.”No such announcement appears anywhere in his stream or social media activity.Another AI-produced report later contradicted the initial claim, stating there was no evidence of any assault. The origin of the misleading narrative was linked to an account with a history of provocative and xenophobic commentary, which further undermined its credibility.Beyond debunking rumours, Speed’s African tour has continued to highlight everyday realities across the continent. He has drawn praise for showing unscripted moments that challenge stereotypes. Reflecting on his goal, the streamer said, “I want to show the world what Africa really is.”His enthusiasm has remained consistent throughout the journey. Speaking to his audience earlier in the tour, he added, “Bro, I’m not going to lie, I love the love in Africa. The energy here is crazy.”As misinformation fades, what remains is a clear reminder.

Candace Owens escalates clash with Turning Point USA by sharing explosive private messages





Candace Owens has escalated her public clash with Turning Point USA in a way that has stunned even seasoned observers of conservative media infighting. A cease and desist letter failed to slow her down. Instead, Owens moved faster, sharper, and more publicly, releasing alleged private messages and workplace accounts that cast fresh scrutiny on TPUSA’s leadership after Charlie Kirk ’s death.The controversy now stretches beyond personal grievances. It touches donor influence, internal power struggles, and the emotional fallout inside a political organization navigating grief while under a microscope. Owens, once closely aligned with TPUSA, is positioning herself as a whistleblower, even as critics question her motives and methods.Owens accused TPUSA leadership of conducting what she called “witch trials” against employees, claiming staff members were questioned, terminated, or intimidated over perceived loyalty to Erika Kirk. In one post, she wrote, “What is going on at Turning Point right now should be termed the Scottsdale Witch Trials. I have now gathered first-person accounts that executives are dragging people into offices asking about their allegiance to Erika.She went further, alleging surveillance and abrupt firings tied to private conversations. “Despite 250 million dollars raised since Charlie’s assassination, she was fired. No reason given,” Owens claimed, suggesting fear now defines the workplace culture.The most explosive moment came when Owens read what she said were threatening messages sent to Charlie Kirk by a donor. The message warned, “Be very careful, Charlie. You are in violation of the 9th Commandment, by bearing false witness against your brother, Judah. When was the last time you read your Bible, Charlie.”Another section escalated the tone further: “This is not a joke, Charlie. I'm coming to you as a sister in the faith. You have accomplished so much by the hand of The Almighty, but He is going to lift His hand from you.”Owens claimed Kirk felt threatened by the texts and insisted they did not originate from TPUSA leadership.

Warm Personality: A ""steady presence"" who was deeply valued by his peers for his kindness and strong character.

Community Connection: He had already become a recognizable and loved figure around the school grounds, known for his welcoming smile and positive energy.

A beloved Year 4 teacher at Durham School Dubai tragically lost his life in a road accident over the weekend, sending shock waves through the school community. Principal Kieran McLaughlin confirmed the sad news in a message to parents, explaining that Sebastian Charles, who had joined the school only recently, was well-liked by pupils and staff alike and had quickly made a positive impact.Although he hadn’t been at the school long, Charles’s caring nature and professional dedication made him a favourite among the children, and his sudden passing deeply saddened the entire community.In his letter to parents, Principal McLaughlin expressed how devastating the loss is for a community built around learning and hope. He wrote that such moments are particularly hard because schools symbolise future aspirations, and losing a respected member of staff affects everyone deeply.To help students cope, the school has arranged for a grief counsellor from a private hospital to be available for any pupil needing emotional support. Parents were asked to communicate with their child’s class teacher if they think additional help is needed.McLaughlin also encouraged families to talk openly with their children about the tragedy, noting that every child may react differently and that extra care and understanding are important during such a difficult period.Sebastian Charles was more than just a teacher; he was described by the school leadership as a popular educator who ""quickly established himself"" and won the hearts of the children in his class. Colleagues and parents alike noted his infectious enthusiasm and the genuine care he showed for every student under his wing.The school's principal highlighted that even in his brief tenure, Mr. Charles had left an indelible mark:In recognition of the somber mood and to show respect for Charles’s memory, the school decided to postpone its planned sports day events for EYFS and Key Stage 1 that had been scheduled for the following Wednesday. These activities will now take place next week, allowing the community time to grieve.The principal asked the school community to honour Charles respectfully and avoid speculation, especially on social media, during this sensitive time. He assured parents that in due course the school will find an appropriate way to remember Mr Charles.The loss of an educator is a loss for the entire city. In a transient city like Dubai, teachers often become a ""second family"" for expat children, making such tragedies feel deeply personal for everyone involved. As the school prepares to honor his memory with a formal service, the outpouring of love from parents and former colleagues across the UAE serves as a testament to the fact that it is not the length of time one spends in a role, but the depth of the heart they bring to it.","Sebastian Charles, a Year 4 teacher at Durham School Dubai, died in a road accident.

She passionately spoke of his unwavering dedication amidst adversity, battling both racism and physical hardships to forge a better future for his family.

Trump Immigration Offensive SHOCK Reveal; Workplace Raids, Expanded Detention Incoming Next Year

Social media reactions:

Your dad and your mam are heroes Narinder I know what you mean I worked in the shipyards on the Tyne , and I’m sure they would be proud of you , your also a hero fighting against racism , I for one salute you

Good for you Narinder that your Dad was so honest and hard working.

I've said a 100 times on here... The ""Immigrants"" living near me are all bloody hard working and conscientious.

Beautifully put, and on top of that supporting extended family members as well as looking after their own families. They were hard workers, hard graft, in a tumultuous time for the country.

You don't have to prove anything Narinder. It's bloody awful that you have to give people your background, it's ridiculous. People can be so weird and downright nasty with it.





British broadcaster and television personality Narinder Kaur has called for immigrants to be given fair chances as the UK enters 2026, sharing a personal story about her father’s life and hard work.In a post on X, Kaur wrote that she normally would not share a photo and the early life of her father as a poor immigrant, but this time made an exception only to speak out against growing anti-immigrant rhetoric. “My dad came from India in the early 60s and went straight into hard labour. No help. Not a penny given. Double shifts at the steel foundry for YEARS. The kind of work that ruins your body and shortens your life. Heat, noise, pain, exhaustion—day after day. He didn’t get a choice,” she said.Kaur described how her father and uncles endured racism and hardship in the British land but survived, saving money and building a life in a foreign place. “Every shift he worked went into that shop in Newcastle. That shop didn’t come from luck, talk, or ideas. It came from steel work, double shifts and pain… Earned with his body,” she wrote, adding that the whole family contributed to the business, including Kaur and her siblings.Kaur explained that so much physical labour can take a toll on any person, and said that her parents and uncle died young because of it. “No—the generation of immigrants back then weren’t different to the new. The new immigrants ALSO are desperate to work and make a life for themselves,” she said.Kaur concluded by urging a change in how immigrants are viewed in 2026. “This narrative must change and we must give others a chance,” she said. She highlighted every instance of resilience, dedication, and contribution of immigrant families to British society.","British broadcaster and television personality Narinder Kaur has called for immigrants to be given fair chances as the UK enters 2026.

Prank turns deadly: 12-year-old dies imitating 'Squid Game' scene; probe underway,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/prank-turns-deadly-12-year-old-dies-imitating-squid-game-scene-probe-underway/articleshow/126276778.cms,"Representative file photo





A 12-year-old boy has died after attempting to replicate a scene from the South Korean Netflix series Squid Game as a prank.An inquest ruled that the boy, Sebastian Cizman, died by hanging, with reports suggesting he was trying to jokingly imitate a character who died in the same way on the show. Earlier that day, Sebastian, described as a “prankster,” had shared an image of the scene in a WhatsApp group, as reported by The Telegraph.Sebastian’s search history also showed that he had viewed a YouTube video on ‘surviving choking alone.’ His parents, Marcin and Katarzyna, described him as a happy child with no known mental health issues.The Wakefield inquest heard that the “star” schoolboy had been playing with his cousins in the garden before going inside, saying he was tired. He was later found unresponsive on the staircase by one of his cousins after his father, Marcin, returned home from work with ice cream.Despite resuscitation efforts by his parents and paramedics, Sebastian was pronounced dead at the hospital. The inquest also noted that he enjoyed making friends laugh and had previously pretended to be unconscious while play-fighting.Philip Dore, headmaster of St Wilfrid’s Catholic High School in Featherstone, described Sebastian as a popular, happy, and humorous student.Detective sergeant Paul Bayliss suggested that the boy’s “prankster nature,” interest in Squid Game, and the image on his phone offered a possible explanation for his death.“It’s hard what I’m going to say, but I hope that the loss of my child is going to help some other children to understand. And for the people that run these social media platforms to do something, to stop it from happening.How many kids have to die until they do something? My message to other parents is check your children’s phones before it is too late,” Katarzyna Cizman was quoted as saying by the Telegraph.","Sebastian Cizman, 12, died after attempting to replicate a scene from the South Korean Netflix series Squid Game as a prank.

British TV host and commentator Narinder Kaur posted a video from New Delhi, India, in which she was surprised to see how a country with such a small Christian population (2%) celebrates Christmas “like it’s the majority. ”Kaur shared the video on X from Delhi, alongside footage which appeared to show Christmas decorations in hotels and malls, including trees, Santa figures, and staff wearing Santa hats.In her post, she claimed that if British people celebrated Diwali the same way in UK, the ""right-wing"" would become angry: “Around 2% of the population of India is Christian, yet they are celebrating Xmas like its the majority! Its amazing! Respectful. Staff all have Santa hats on..can you imagine uk hotel staff wearing turbans during Diwali? The right-wing would have a meltdown.”She called the celebration respectful and said everywhere she travelled in India, people were in the festive spirit: “Everywhere I’ve gone—hotels, restaurants—they’re celebrating Christmas big time in India,” she says. “Now I think 2% of the population of India is Christian, but they’re still celebrating, respecting.”Kaur also said that such displays in India are happening “without any fear.” She added that there is no sense in people complaining that Christians or “white people are taking over.”The comments divided the internet.

Several users said her remarks felt needlessly provocative and played into ongoing culture-war arguments.One user wrote: ""I think you make a good point. However, I would never wear a turban during Diwali because I would feel that it would not be respectful. I was taught that a turban was worn as a sign of membership in a religion, and I am not Sikh - santa hat is not religious.

How driving a Uber in Trump's America changed a former journalist's views on immigration,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-driving-a-uber-in-trumps-america-changed-a-former-journalists-views-on-immigration/articleshow/127265099.cms,"



When Steve Scherer began driving an Uber in northern Virginia, he was not trying to rediscover immigration as a subject. He had already spent years reporting on it from Europe.Scherer, a former foreign correspondent and bureau chief, published a first-person essay on his Substack this week describing how working as a ride-hail driver in the US reshaped how he understands immigration, vulnerability and economic insecurity. The essay, titled My journey from foreign correspondent to Uber driver in Trump’s America, chronicles his transition from international journalism to gig work after losing his job and legal footing in Canada.Scherer previously served as Reuters’ Ottawa bureau chief before his position was eliminated in a cost-cutting exercise. Although he owned a home and raised his children in Canada, immigration rules meant he could not remain once his employment ended. He returned to the US in July 2025, his first time living there in nearly 30 years.Unable to find immediate newsroom work, Scherer began driving for Uber.In the essay, he describes his first morning on the job, picking up hotel workers, teachers, hospital staff, mechanics and cleaners, many of them Latino or immigrants, all travelling to work before dawn. One ride earned him less than $7. Over roughly five hours, he made about $100.“I didn’t know the immigration status of any of my clients,” he writes. “But I wondered how misguided and aggressive targeting of the very people who serve us breakfast, teach our children, fix our cars, clean our hotel rooms, and comfort our sick makes America great.”Before this phase of his life, Scherer had covered migration largely as an external observer. He spent years reporting on the Mediterranean crossing from Libya and Tunisia to Italy, embedding with Italian navy vessels and NGO rescue missions. He interviewed migrants rescued from rubber boats and documented detention, abuse and human trafficking At the time, he writes, he did not fully understand what drives people to take such risks.Driving an Uber altered that perspective.“For the first time in my life, I am no longer observing this precarious world from the outside, notebook in hand,” Scherer writes. “I am inside it, dependent on an algorithm, measuring my worth in five-dollar increments.”He describes seeing his own fragility reflected in his passengers: widows, parents and workers “all one broken transmission or missed paycheck away from something worse.”The essay quickly drew responses from journalists and readers, many of whom said Scherer’s experience resonated with their own.Matthew Tostevin, a fellow journalist, wrote on X: “This is powerfully written Steve. I’m sorry to hear about your plight and hope that this helps bring recognition of skills that should be valued. Wishing the best for you and the family.”Another reader, Bruce Ross, framed the story in the context of upheaval across the media industry. “The refugees from media are all around and it is tough to make a fresh start in the 50s (speaking as a fellow member of the gang),” he wrote. “All the best, and thanks for sharing a difficult story.”Others responded from outside journalism. An Italy-based reader posting under the name milanoArte.net wrote that Scherer’s essay echoed their own family’s experience. “My sister lives in California with her family. She is white, she is an American citizen, she is not in danger. I do not know when I’ll be able to see her again, unless she comes back to Italy. America is a part of my blood and soul, it’s so painful to see what’s going on. ”In the essay, Scherer is explicit that he does not equate his circumstances with those of undocumented migrants. He notes that he holds an American passport, is white, and has savings and family support. He writes that he is unlikely to be detained by immigration authorities.However, he says the experience of driving for Uber changed how he understands vulnerability and belonging in the US economy.Scherer also recounts how his family was split across borders after leaving Canada. His wife returned to Italy, where she has healthcare access and legal security. His children initially joined her before later reuniting with him in the US. He sold his home in Canada and rented a basement apartment in Virginia while trying to rebuild his life.Since publication, readers on Substack have highlighted passages describing life governed by app notifications and low fares, with several saying the essay reflected anxieties shared by freelancers and displaced professionals across industries.Scherer continues to live in Virginia and drive for Uber while seeking new professional opportunities. His essay was published on January 21, 2026.","Steve Scherer is a former foreign correspondent and bureau chief for Reuters. His job was eliminated in a cost-cutting exercise.

Pop star Katy Perry found herself at the centre of growing controversy over climate and celebrity behaviour after her high-profile space tourism flight in April last year. The singer, who arrived in Davos during key talks on environmental issues, was criticised for participating in a space mission that many say undermines the message she now promotes.

You don’t need 15 funds; 4–6 well-chosen ones are enough for most investors.

Step 1: Start with one boringly good core fund

core equity fund

if you get your first fund right, you’re already 60–70 per cent of the way to a good portfolio.

Step 2: When to add a second core fund

but the second fund should be another pillar, not a clone.

Your SIP size has grown meaningfully.

Your total equity corpus is getting substantial.

You want to spread the manager or style risk a bit.

slightly different style

different structure

one portfolio with duplicate statements

the same 25–30 companies

Step 3: Adding a satellite – but only after the core is steady

a mid-cap fund,

or a small-cap fund (for more aggressive investors),

or a specific strategy that you understand clearly.

the satellite must remain smaller than the core.

Step 4: The debt or hybrid layer – where real-life risk is managed

debt and hybrid funds.

a short-duration or corporate bond fund for near-term goals

an equity savings fund,

or even a simple combination of equity and a high-quality debt fund.

The big enemy: duplication and overlap

Five ELSS funds bought for tax-saving over five years because “advisor ne bola”.

Four flexi-cap funds topped the ranking in a given year.

Three aggressive hybrid funds, all run with similar mandates.

extra paperwork,

extra confusion about which SIP to stop or increase,

and zero real diversification.

Where do you have 3–4 funds doing the job of one?

Which funds are redundant because their role is already being played by a better one?

Is your equity–debt mix totally out of sync with your goals?

getting rid of an old one.

So what does a sensible 4–6 fund portfolio look like?

One or two core equity funds that together hold most of your equity money.

One or two satellite equity funds (or none) for a mild tilt.

One or two debt or hybrid funds to steady the ride and match shorter-term goals.

Four to six funds.

In one case, you know exactly what each fund is doing and why it exists.

In the other, you are basically hoping that if you throw enough paint on the wall, some of it will become “diversified.”

How to use this in your own portfolio

Identify your two strongest core equity funds.

Check whether you really need more core equity funds, or whether you can phase some out gradually.

See if your satellite funds are genuinely small and purposeful, or secretly running the show.

Look at your overall equity–debt split and compare it with your goals and time frames.

You need 4–6 calm, reliable team members who show up year after year.

The most common portfolio problem I see these days is not “too little choice”. It’s a fridge stuffed with leftovers.Open a typical investor’s portfolio, and you’ll see it: 14 equity funds, 3 hybrids, 2 ELSS, 1 random international fund bought after a YouTube video, and an NFO whose name nobody remembers. Half the SIPs are for ₹1,000. No one knows why each fund is there.Then they ask: “Is my portfolio diversified?”My honest answer: “Yes, it’s diversified. But mostly in confusion.”In this column, I want to walk you through the opposite way of doing things: starting with one good fund and growing a portfolio slowly, deliberately, like building a house brick by brick. This is also how we build model portfolios inside Value Research Fund Advisor (VRFA). We don’t begin with “how many funds can we add?” We start with “What is the minimum we can get away with?”Every solid portfolio begins with onethat can quietly do the heavy lifting for years.For most people, this is a broad, well-diversified fund: a good flexi-cap, a large-cap, or a simple index fund tracking a broad market. It should be the kind of fund that does not need much “watching”, does not chase fads, and owns a wide basket of companies.Say, an investor starts with a single flexi-cap fund, with a SIP of ₹10,000 per month. Over the next five years, this one fund alone grows to over ₹ 9 lakh.So, the idea is simple:Inside VRFA, this is exactly where we start when someone comes in with no investments or with a messy portfolio. We first identify or suggest a strong core fund that matches their goal and risk level. Only after this is in place do we even think of adding anything else.Very quickly, investors get itchy. As soon as the first fund does okay, the mind whispers: “Ab ek aur le lete hain.” That’s fine—There are good reasons to add a second core fund:What is not a good reason is: “This fund is on a ‘Top 10 Funds’ list this month, so let me add it.”A second core fund should either bring a(e.g., one fund is more large-cap oriented and the other has some mid-cap exposure) or a(e.g., pairing a flexi-cap with a large-and-mid-cap fund).If both your funds are flexi-cap funds from similar AMCs and hold the same top 20 stocks, then you don’t have two funds. You haveAt VRFA, when we see this kind of overlap, our system literally shows you the combined underlying holdings. Quite often, investors are shocked to see that their “five different funds” actually ownin slightly different proportions. That is not diversification. That is administrative clutter.Only after the core is in place—typically two good equity funds—should you think of adding a “satellite” fund.A satellite fund is like a side dish. It can make the meal more interesting, but you can’t live on it alone. In practice, this usually means:You add a satellite to tilt your portfolio, not to turn it upside down.Starting with two core equity funds that together form about 70-80 per cent of the total equity allocation, the investor adds one mid-cap fund with just 20-30 per cent allocation. Over 10-15 years, the core provides stability, while the mid-cap adds an extra kicker to long-term returns.The message is:If your mid- and small-cap funds become 60–70 per cent of your equity money, you are not “enhancing returns”; you are simply increasing the chances of losing sleep.Inside VRFA model portfolios, you’ll see this very clearly: for most investors, the core funds make up the bulk of the allocation. Satellites are small, carefully chosen, and sometimes absent altogether—especially for conservative or first-time equity investors.There is one more building block most investors ignore because it is not glamorous:If you are investing for goals 3-5 years away, or if you want to control how wild your ride is, part of your portfolio should be in safer assets.This can be:Think of this as the shock absorber of your portfolio. It doesn’t look exciting in good times, but it stops your long-term plan from collapsing when the market throws a tantrum.For a goal that is four years away, instead of putting 100 per cent in equity, an investor could use an equity savings fund, which typically keeps about 30 per cent in equity and the rest in debt and arbitrage. In March 2020, when the market fell 23 per cent, such a portfolio would likely have fallen far less, closer to 10 per cent.This is the difference between staying invested and panicking out.At VRFA, every recommendation starts with asset allocation by goal: how much should go into equity, how much into debt, and how that should change as the goal gets closer. Only after this is decided do we select specific funds to fill those buckets.Now we come back to the biggest disease in Indian portfolios:If you dig into the holdings, you’ll often find the same leading banks, IT companies, consumer stocks repeating everywhere.Instead of “five sources of return”, you’ve created:Inside VRFA, one of the first things we encourage subscribers to do is a “portfolio cleanup” using our model portfolios as a reference. You can literally open the recommended portfolio for your risk level and compare it with your own:Very often, the best “new investment” is not a new fund, butLet me put all this together. For a typical long-term investor, a clean, effective portfolio might look like this:That’s it.Not because you are lazy, but because you are disciplined.Compare that with the 15-fund portfolio:At VRFA, every model portfolio is built with this core–satellite thinking. We start by asking: “If this investor never touched their portfolio for the next 10–15 years and only kept investing regularly, would this mix give them a high chance of success?” Then we work backwards.If you’re reading this and your portfolio already looks like a museum of every fund ever launched, here is what I suggest:First, don’t panic. Cleaning a portfolio is not an emergency surgery. It’s more like decluttering a house.Second, line up your funds on a sheet of paper (or on a portfolio tracker):If you’re a VRFA subscriber, this process becomes much easier. You can match your portfolio to a model portfolio tailored to your risk profile and goals. You’ll often find that you don’t need more funds; you need fewer, better-chosen properly-sized funds.And if you’re not a subscriber yet, you can still borrow the idea: think in terms of roles, not “number of funds”. Every fund in your portfolio should be able to answer a simple question:“If I remove you, what important job will stop getting done?”If the honest answer is “nothing much”, then you’ve just found clutter.A solid portfolio is not built in one weekend. It grows from one good core fund into a small, well-organised team of funds, each doing its job. You don’t need 15 people shouting at once.That, in the long run, beats the noisiest “Top 10 Funds” list every single time.",You don’t need 15 funds; 4–6 well-chosen ones are enough for most investors. Every solid portfolio begins with one core equity fund that can quietly do the heavy lifting for years.

From India to the frontiers of astrophysics

Discoveries that changed astronomy

Building the machines that watch the sky

Family, curiosity, and a lifelong fascination with the cosmos

Recognition earned over a lifetime





When the Royal Astronomical Society announced Shrinivas R. Kulkarni as the recipient of its Gold Medal, it marked more than another milestone in a decorated career. Awarded continuously since 1824, the medal is the Society’s highest honour, reserved for scientists whose work has fundamentally altered how humanity understands the universe.The prestigious award placed him among an elite group of scientific pioneers, Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawking , Edwin Hubble, and recognised his “field-defining” work in time-domain astronomy. Remarkably, Kulkarni is only the second Indian to receive the RAS Gold Medal, following Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, honoured in 1953 for his groundbreaking work on the structure and evolution of stars.In Kulkarni’s case, the citation acknowledged a lifetime spent reshaping astronomy itself, from a static science of distant objects into a dynamic discipline that tracks the universe in motion.Born in Maharashtra and educated in India before moving to the United States, Kulkarni’s career now spans more than four decades at the very frontier of astrophysics. The RAS credited him for “sustained, innovative and ground-breaking contributions to multi-wavelength transient astrophysics,” a field concerned with short-lived and rapidly evolving cosmic events. Few astronomers have done more to define that field, or to build the instruments that made it possible.Shrinivas Kulkarni was born in Kurundwad, a small town in Maharashtra, and spent his early years moving across Karnataka due to his father’s work as a government doctor. He completed his schooling in Hubli before enrolling at IIT Delhi, where he pursued an integrated BSc and MSc programme, graduating in 1978. From the outset, his ambition ran counter to expectation. “I wanted to do research and not go into industry or be a doctor or lawyer or engineer which is sort of the more traditional path,” he later recalled.That resolve took him to the United States, where he completed his PhD in astronomy at the University of California, Berkeley in 1983, specialising in radio astronomy. Of that period, he said: “I had an exceptional advisor who understood what I really wanted to do.” A Millikan Fellowship brought him to the California Institute of Technology, beginning an association that would define the rest of his professional life.Kulkarni joined Caltech’s faculty in 1987, progressing from assistant professor of astronomy to associate professor, professor, professor of astronomy and planetary science, MacArthur Professor, and eventually the George Ellery Hale Professor of Astronomy and Planetary Science. Along the way, he served as executive officer for astronomy and as director of Ca ltech Optical Observatories, overseeing the Palomar and Keck telescopes, two of the international astronomy community’s most prized instruments.Kulkarni’s scientific reputation rests not on a single breakthrough, but on a sequence of discoveries that repeatedly shifted the field’s centre of gravity. As a graduate student in 1982, he co-discovered the first millisecond pulsar, a neutron star rotating hundreds of times per second, forcing astronomers to rethink how stellar remnants evolve.In 1995, he and his colleagues identified the first brown dwarf, an object too large to be a planet yet too small to sustain hydrogen fusion like a star, opening an entirely new category of celestial bodies. Two years later, Kulkarni was part of the team that measured the distance to a gamma-ray burst for the first time, demonstrating that these violent flashes originated billions of light-years away, far beyond the Milky Way.More recently, his work has helped unravel the mystery of fast radio bursts (FRBs). Using an instrument known as STARE2, developed earlier in his career with a graduate student, Kulkarni was part of the team that in 2020 detected an FRB originating within the Milky Way itself. The source, a magnetar, or highly magnetised neutron star, provided the first direct confirmation that such objects can generate FRBs.Equally central to Kulkarni’s legacy is his insistence that discovery depends on instrumentation. “My motto has been to build a big enough gizmo and things will happen,” he said in one of his Caltech lectures. Over his career, he has helped construct around ten astronomical instruments, many designed to capture fleeting cosmic events that older observatories would miss.This philosophy culminated in the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) in 2009 and its successor, the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) in 2017. Using a 70-year-old telescope at Palomar Observatory, these surveys scan the entire northern sky every two nights. Automated software analyses the data, and alerts about transient events, supernovae, asteroids, flaring stars, are sent to astronomers worldwide within minutes.According to the award citation, these projects have “revolutionised time-domain astrophysics at optical wavelengths.” The data from PTF and ZTF has enabled discoveries ranging from a star swallowing one of its planets, to some of the closest and brightest supernovae ever recorded, to binary stars orbiting each other every seven minutes and emitting low-frequency gravitational radiation.Funded by institutions worldwide and supported by major grants from the National Science Foundation and the Heising-Simons Foundation, the projects have also trained a new generation of astronomers now leading the field. Reflecting on ZTF after winning the Shaw Prize, Kulkarni remarked: “ZTF is only possible at Caltech, which values exceptionalism.”Behind the accolades is a life shaped by an unusually high-achieving family, one that helps explain both Kulkarni’s intellectual confidence and his sensitivity to hierarchy. He is the youngest of four siblings and the brother of author, educator and philanthropist Sudha Murty , who is married to Infosys founder and billionaire Narayana Murthy His eldest sister, Sunanda, followed their father into medicine and served as a gynaecologist at a government hospital in Bengaluru. Another sister, Jayshree, an IIT Madras alumna, is married to Boston-based IT entrepreneur Gururaj “Desh” Deshpande, one of the wealthiest Indian-born entrepreneurs and a billionaire.“All my sisters were gold medallists and evolved into competent professionals,” Kulkarni said in an interview. “Coming from such a family, I found it strange that there were so few women in high places in the US when I first moved to that country.”During his PhD years at the University of California, Berkeley, Kulkarni met Hiromi Komiya, a doctoral student from Japan. He learned Japanese within a matter of weeks, and the two married soon after. They have two daughters, Anju and Maya.Although his work has helped define some of the most serious frontiers of modern astrophysics, Kulkarni has often pushed back against the popular image of scientists as permanently solemn or detached. In one interview with The Global Indian, he addressed that perception directly. “We astronomers are supposed to say, ‘We wonder about the stars and we really want to think about it,’” he said, acknowledging the stereotype. But, he added, that image misses something essential. “Many scientists, I think, secretly are what I call ‘boys with toys.’ I really like playing around with telescopes. It’s just not fashionable to admit it.”That combination, deep technical seriousness paired with a visible delight in experimentation, has remained a through-line in Kulkarni’s career, shaping both his discoveries and his lifelong commitment to building the tools that allow the universe to surprise us.The RAS Gold Medal joins a formidable list of honours, including the 2024 Shaw Prize in Astronomy, the US National Science Foundation’s Alan T. Waterman Award, the Dan David Prize, the Jansky Prize, and the Helen B. Warner Award. He is a member of the US National Academy of Sciences, the Royal Society of London, and the Indian Academy of Sciences.Kulkarni continues to work on future projects, including NASA’s Ultraviolet Explorer (UVEX), planned for launch around 2030, and Z-Shooter, a next-generation spectrometer for the Keck Observatory. Reflecting on awards, he has said simply: “Awards open doors.”With the Royal Astronomical Society’s Gold Medal, Shri Kulkarni takes his place among scientists whose work has not only explained the universe, but transformed how we observe it, teaching astronomy to watch the sky not as a fixed backdrop, but as a living, changing system.","Shrinivas R. Kulkarni is only the second Indian to receive the RAS Gold Medal. Awarded continuously since 1824, the medal is the Society’s highest honour.

Meaning of the quote of the day Microsoft co-founder by Bill Gates



Staying humble in a world of constant wins



Why failure is actually the better instructor



Bill Gates and the danger of overconfidence in 2026



Final thoughts on the Gates philosophy







Success is a concept we are all taught to chase from the moment we can understand the word. We see it in the headlines, on our social feeds, and in the lives of the people we admire. But Bill Gates, a man who has lived at the absolute peak of global influence and wealth for decades, has a different take on it. He famously said, ""Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose."" It’s a bit of a reality check, isn't it? Coming from someone who co-founded Microsoft and spent years as the richest person on the planet, you’d expect him to be success’s biggest cheerleader. Instead, he’s warning us that the very thing we want can actually be the thing that trips us up. He’s talking about that dangerous mix of ego and comfort that creeps in when things are going well.When Gates says success is a lousy teacher, he’s cutting through the fluff of typical motivational speeches. The core meaning here is about the psychological trap of ""winning."" When you fail, you’re forced to look in the mirror. You have to take apart your process, find the cracks, and figure out exactly where you messed up. That’s where the real learning happens. But when you succeed? You usually just pat yourself on the back.You assume that because you won, every decision you made along the way was the right one. This creates a blind spot.The second part of the quote—the idea that success ""seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose""—is even more pointed. Smart people are often the most vulnerable to this. If you’ve spent your life being right, it’s easy to start believing that you are inherently better or smarter than the market or the competition. Success makes you feel invincible. It lulls you into a state of complacency where you stop looking for risks because you don't believe they apply to you anymore. For Gates, this wasn't just a theory; it was a lesson he lived through at Microsoft during the rise of the internet and later the mobile era, where past dominance sometimes made it harder to see the next big shift coming.It’s hard to stay grounded when everyone is telling you how great you are. In today’s culture, we celebrate the ""win"" so loudly that we forget to check if the win was actually repeatable or just a stroke of luck. Bill Gates’ current work in 2026 shows he’s still trying to apply this logic. Despite his massive net worth—which still sits comfortably over $100 billion—he’s moved far beyond the world of software. He’s currently knee-deep in high-risk, high-reward projects like the ""Horizon 1000"" initiative.Just this month, in January 2026, the Gates Foundation partnered with OpenAI, committing $50 million to bring AI-driven healthcare to 1,000 clinics across Africa, starting in Rwanda. This isn't the move of someone who thinks they've already ""won"" everything. It's the move of someone who knows that the challenges of global health and climate change are much harder than building an operating system. He’s putting his resources into areas where failure is a very real possibility, which keeps that ""lousy teacher"" of success at a distance.If success is a bad teacher, then failure is the strict professor you hated in college but realised later taught you everything you know. Failure doesn't let you off the hook. It demands an explanation. When a project falls apart or a business goes under, the pain of that loss acts as a powerful motivator to never let it happen again. You become more observant. You look at the data more closely.I remember a time when I put everything into a project that I was certain would be a ""slam dunk."" I didn't even have a backup plan because I was so convinced of my own brilliance. When it inevitably tanked, I was crushed. But looking back, that failure taught me more about risk management and humility than any of my previous successes ever did. It stripped away the ego and made me a better strategist. I think that's what Gates is getting at. You have to be willing to be wrong to eventually be right in a way that actually lasts.Even now, as we navigate 2026, the tech landscape is shifting faster than ever. With AI moving from a buzzword to a fundamental part of our infrastructure, the risk of overconfidence is huge. Companies that were the kings of the hill five years ago are finding themselves scrambling. Gates has always been a student of history, and he knows that the graveyard of business is filled with ""smart people"" who thought they couldn't lose.Look at his recent investments in nuclear energy through TerraPower. On January 21, 2026, it was reported that South Korean energy giants are taking major stakes in his Natrium nuclear plant project in Wyoming. This is a sector where success is incredibly difficult to achieve and the regulatory hurdles are massive. Gates isn't playing it safe. He’s deliberately stepping into arenas where he has to prove himself all over again. He's avoiding the ""seduction"" of his past achievements by constantly starting new, difficult chapters.At the end of the day, Bill Gates isn't saying we shouldn't strive for success. He’s just saying we shouldn't trust it. Success is a temporary state, not a permanent trait. If you want to keep growing, you have to treat your wins with a bit of suspicion. Ask yourself: ""Did I win because I’m a genius, or did I just get lucky?"" Most of the time, it's a bit of both. By staying curious and keeping a bit of that ""loser’s hunger,"" you can avoid the trap of thinking you’re untouchable. It’s a tough way to live—always looking for the hole in your own boat—but it’s the only way to keep from sinking.","Bill Gates famously said, ""Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose"" The core meaning here is about the psychological trap of ""winning"" When you fail, you’re forced to look in the mirror and figure out exactly where you messed up.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127271649,imgsize-32814,width-400,resizemode-4/bill-gates-image-source-reuters.jpg"
