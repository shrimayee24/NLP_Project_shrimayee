qualification scenario

:

NEW DELHI: When Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) and Chennai Super Kings (CSK) face off at the iconic Chinnaswamy Stadium, the stakes couldn't be higher. RCB, fueled by a string of victories, finds themselves on the cusp of a playoff berth , provided they can overcome CSK and meet specific run rate requirements.However, uncertainties loom over the match's fate, as a looming threat of rain threatens to disrupt proceedings.RCB fans, eager for their team's shot at playoff glory, anxiously hope for a weather miracle that spares the match from being washed out, or at least allows for a reduced-overs contest if rain intervenes.With the recent turn of events in the IPL 2024 league stage, RCB find themselves in a precarious yet hopeful position. RCB's pathway to the playoffs has crystallized into a specific set of requirements.To secure their coveted playoff spot, RCB must triumph over Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in their final league encounter. However, it's not just a matter of winning; the margin of victory holds the key. RCB's mission is clear: they must either win by a margin of 18 runs or chase down the target within 18.1 overs to eclipse CSK's Net Run Rate (NRR). (Here's a list of updated orange cap list) This scenario adds a layer of intensity to the already high-stakes clash between RCB and CSK.Every run scored and every over bowled will be scrutinized with playoff aspirations hanging in the balance. For RCB, it's not just about winning; it's about winning with precision to tip the scales of NRR in their favor.As the league stage draws to a close, RCB's fate rests on their ability to execute their game plan with meticulous accuracy against a formidable CSK side. With playoff dreams within grasp, RCB must summon their best performance yet to clinch victory and secure their place in the IPL 2024 playoffs.CSK's hopes for a direct qualification to the playoffs in IPL 2024 hinge on their upcoming showdown with Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB). If they emerge victorious, they'll secure a direct berth with second position and 16 points in the IPL 2024 points table . However, a loss to RCB could still keep their playoff dreams alive, but with a caveat. (Here's a list of updated Purple cap list) In the event of a loss, CSK must ensure that RCB doesn't meet specific run rate requirements. RCB would need to be restricted from chasing the target within 18.1 overs or winning by a margin of 18 runs or more. This adds an extra layer of pressure to CSK's performance, emphasizing the importance of strategic gameplay till the last ball.For CSK to clinch a coveted spot in the top two and secure a berth in the first qualifier, a series of dominoes must fall in their favour:1. Rajasthan Royals (RR) must falter in their final match against table-toppers Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR).2. CSK must triumph over RCB in their last league encounter.3. Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) must stumble in their last match, finishing with 15 points.Should these stars align, CSK's superior net run rate would elevate them to the second position on the points table with 16 points, setting the stage for a thrilling journey into the playoffs.",Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) and Chennai Super Kings (CSK) face off at the iconic Chinnaswamy Stadium.

NEW DELHI: Mumbai Indians and Lucknow Super Giants , both out of contention for the IPL playoffs , will face off at the Wankhede Stadium. Lucknow's playoff hopes are nearly extinguished after three consecutive defeats that not only cost them crucial points but also hurt their net run rate. Mumbai Indians, with just four wins out of 13 matches, are facing a disappointing season, especially after the pre-season controversy surrounding their change in leadership from Rohit Sharma to Hardik Pandya.Pandya's captaincy has been under scrutiny, with fans expressing discontent. Mumbai's batting unit struggled collectively, relying heavily on Jasprit Bumrah 's exceptional bowling performances. However, his efforts couldn't rally the entire bowling lineup. (Here's a list of updated points table) Lucknow, despite KL Rahul 's impressive batting performance, failed to capitalize on key moments due to a lack of support from other batsmen. Nicholas Pooran provided some late sparks, but the team's overall batting performance was inconsistent. Additionally, their bowling unit couldn't deliver consistently, compounding their woes. With both teams seeking to salvage pride in their final match, the focus will be on ending the season on a positive note.In their head-to-head encounters , the Super Giants have been dominant, winning four out of five matches against the Mumbai Indians. However, facing off at the Wankhede Stadium brings its own dynamics into play.The pitch at the Wankhede has been a mixed bag, offering something for every player on the field. From high-scoring thrillers to instances of swing bowling mastery by players like Trent Boult, and the spinners making their mark, the stadium has witnessed a variety of cricketing spectacles. With the wicket showing signs of wear and tear after six games, it's expected to retain its batting-friendly nature initially but might slow down gradually, favoring the slower bowlers as the match progresses.Looking at the statistics from IPL 2024 at the Wankhede Stadium, both batting first and second have resulted in an equal number of victories. The average first innings total stands at 184, while teams batting second have chased down an average of 173 runs. The highest total recorded was an impressive 234/5 by the Mumbai Indians against the Delhi Capitals, while the lowest total stands at 125/9 by Mumbai Indians versus the Rajasthan Royals.Considering the fantasy implications of the pitch report, top-order batters from both teams are likely to flourish, especially when the ball is new and the pitch is at its best for batting. As the match progresses and the pitch slows down, spinners could come into play, making them valuable picks for fantasy contests . Additionally, fast bowlers adept at using variations like slowers and cutters could prove effective, particularly during the death overs, adding depth to fantasy team selections.He has been a standout performer for Mumbai Indians in IPL 2024, accumulating 416 runs in 13 matches. His consistency with the bat makes him a reliable pick for fantasy contests. (Here's a list of updated Orange cap list) He has been a key player for Mumbai Indians, showcasing his skill with 20 wickets in 13 matches. His ability to take wickets and maintain an economical bowling rate makes him a valuable asset for fantasy teams. (Here's a list of updated Purple cap list) The captain of Lucknow Super Giants, has amassed 465 runs in 13 matches. While he has been the leading run-scorer for his team, he has struggled to convert his starts into big scores in recent matches. However, his potential for a big innings makes him a worthy choice for fantasy contests.Hardik Pandya (c), Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav, Dewald Brevis, Jasprit Bumrah, Piyush Chawla, Gerald Coetzee, Tim David, Shreyas Gopal, Ishan Kishan (wk), Anshul Kamboj, Kumar Kartikeya, Akash Madhwal, Kwena Maphaka, Mohammad Nabi, Shams Mulani, Naman Dhir, Shivalik Sharma, Romario Shepherd, Arjun Tendulkar, Nuwan Thushara, Tilak Varma, Harvik Desai (wk), Nehal Wadhera, Luke Wood.Quinton de Kock, KL Rahul (c & wk), Deepak Hooda, Ayush Badoni, Marcus Stoinis, Nicholas Pooran (wk), Krunal Pandya, Ravi Bishnoi, Mohsin Khan, Shamar Joseph, Yash Thakur, Manimaran Siddharth, Prerak Mankad, Arshad Khan, Krishnappa Gowtham, Amit Mishra, Kyle Mayers, Ashton Turner, Matt Henry, Naveen-ul-Haq, Devdutt Padikkal, Yudhvir Singh Charak, Mayank Yadav, Arshin Kulkarni.KL Rahul, Nicholas PooranRohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav, Nehal Wadhera, Tilak VarmaMarcus StoinisPiyush Chawla, Jasprit Bumrah, Naveen-ul-Haq, Arshad Khan","Mumbai Indians and Lucknow Super Giants will face off at the Wankhede Stadium.

IPL playoff scenarios

:

|

NEW DELHI: Sunrisers Hyderabad clinched their place in the IPL 2024 playoffs after their match against Gujarat Titans was abandoned without a ball bowled due to persistent rain at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium on Thursday. The washout resulted in both teams sharing a point each, propelling Hyderabad to third place on the points table with 15 points.Gujarat Titans, who had already been knocked out of the play-off race earlier in the week after their match against Kolkata Knight Riders was similarly abandoned due to rain, now find themselves out of contention entirely.With this outcome, the defending champions Chennai Super Kings , currently sitting in fourth place, and Royal Challengers Bengaluru are now leading the hunt for the final play-off spot. Both teams are gearing up for a crucial encounter that could determine their playoff fate.* KKR are already assured of sole top spot* If RR win their last game against KKR, they will be guaranteed sole second spot with 18 points. If they lose, they remain on 16 points, which means SRH can overtake them by winning against PBKS. They are sure to qualify, but need to win if they want the second spot* With 15 points, SRH have their fate in their hands. Win the last game and finish sole second or sole third with 17 points depending on the result of the KKR-RR game. If they lose the last game, RR will be ahead and CSK can get ahead by beating RCB. They will then finish fourth* CSK at 14 also have their fate in their hands. If they win against RCB, they finish on 16 points, and at worst fourth spot* RCB need to win against CSK to have a chance. That would take them to 14 points, level with CSK and DC behind KKR, RR and SRH. LSG too could tie at 14, but the good news for RCB is that they have a much better NRR than DC or LSG. Effectively, therefore, RCB need to close the NRR gap with CSK to beat them to the fourth spot. That’s not a tall ask. In a 200-run chase, they would need to win within 18.1 overs. If they bat first and score 200, they would need to restrict CSK to 182 or less.* DC are effectively out of it since KKR, RR and SRH are already ahead. If CSK win against RCB, they too will be ahead. If not, RCB will match DC’s 14 points with a superior NRR* LSG are not totally out of it, theoretically. If they beat MI and RCB beat CSK, they can tie for fourth spot on 14 points. But their NRR is so much worse than CSK’s and RCB’s that this is only a theoretical possibility* In short, KKR, RR and SRH are sure to qualify and one of CSK and RCB will join them in the last four (not necessarily the winner of the game between the two).","Sunrisers Hyderabad clinch their place in IPL 2024 playoffs after their match against Gujarat Titans was abandoned without a ball bowled due to persistent rain.

NEW DELHI: Rajasthan Royals (RR) suffered their fourth consecutive defeat as Punjab Kings (PBKS) secured a five-wicket victory in their IPL match on Wednesday. Despite this setback, RR, with 16 points, are assured of a playoff spot. However, their chances of finishing in the top two are slim due to an inferior net run rate, especially since Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) can still reach 18 points.In the match, Punjab Kings restricted RR to a modest 144 for nine.Riyan Parag, a local favorite, top-scored for RR with 48 off 34 balls on a challenging pitch. Punjab's bowlers were effective, with skipper Sam Curran taking 2 for 24 in 3 overs, Harshal Patel 2 for 28 in 4 overs, Nathan Ellis 1 for 24 in 4 overs, and Rahul Chahar 2 for 26 in 4 overs.In their chase, Curran led from the front with an unbeaten 63 off 41 balls, guiding PBKS to victory with seven balls to spare. Despite the win being inconsequential for Punjab, it was a morale-boosting performance for the team.In the IPL 2024 Orange Cap race, RCB's Virat Kohli tops the leaderboard with 661 runs in 13 innings. He is closely followed by CSK's skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad, who has accumulated 583 runs in 13 innings. SRH's Travis Head, thanks to his unbeaten 89, has moved up to third place with 533 runs. Riyan Parag's impressive performance against PBKS has elevated him to fourth place with 531 runs. B Sai Sudharsan's maiden IPL century has placed him fifth with 527 runs. Sanju Samson rounds out the top six, having scored 504 runs for Rajasthan Royals.In the pursuit of the coveted Purple Cap in IPL 2024, Harshal Patel has surged to the top with 22 wickets, overtaking Jasprit Bumrah who trails closely with 20 dismissals. Varun Chakravarthy's consistent performances have earned him third place with 18 wickets in 12 innings. Yuzvendra Chahal, the spin maestro of RR, has entered the Purple Cap race, securing fourth position with 17 wickets. Khaleel Ahmed of DC also holds 17 wickets, with Chahal edging ahead due to a superior economy rate. As the IPL 2024 season unfolds, bowlers are poised for an intense battle in the race for the Purple Cap.","The Orange Cap is the cap of the Indian national football team. The cap features the team's nickname, the “RUNS,” and the team’s nickname, “The RUNS’’. The team is made up of players from India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110171278,imgsize-42876,width-400,resizemode-4/110171278.jpg"

Expressing optimism that the Indian men's cricket team will win the 2024 T20 World Cup after suffering a loss in the final of the ODI tournament last year, BCCI secretary Jay Shah said the squad has a good balance between form and experience.""The selectors can't choose on the basis of IPL performance alone, as overseas experience is also necessary,"" he said.In an exclusive interview, Jay Shah, secretary and key mover and shaker at BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India) spoke to Harsh Vardhan Goenka, industrialist and cricket aficionado, at the board's headquarters at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium.Shah said the biggest achievement of his tenure so far was holding the 2020 IPL in UAE in the midst of Covid-19. ""Olympics, EPL and French Open had already been postponed or cancelled... We demonstrated to the world what BCCI could achieve,"" he said.Asked about the criticism of IPL's impact player rule by several former and present cricketers, Shah replied, ""It's a test case. We are consulting players, franchisees and all concerned. I feel the matches are getting more interesting, more Indian players are getting a chance to play. If our consultations reveal dissatisfaction, we will change it.""On whether he thought IPL pitches have become too batting friendly, he said, ""I do not quite agree. If you look at the game between LSG and SRH, LSG scored 165/4 in 20 overs. On that pitch, SRH chased the target in around 9 overs without losing a wicket. Pitches are very good, created transparently and overseen by BCCI's central curator.""When I took over, my first decision was to strengthen the National Cricket Academy. We have invested more than Rs 250 crore to improve it and we hope to open the world class, new facility this July or August. My biggest achievement in my tenure was holding the 2020 IPL in UAE in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.The Olympics, English Premier League and French Open had already been postponed/cancelled. We created an isolation bubble within which we conducted the tournament. We demonstrated to the world what BCCI could achieve. We also changed the IPL broadcasting bidding process, separating the TV and digital feeds into separate bids netting us an extra Rs. 5,000 crore (out of a total Rs 48,390 crore). As BCCI's representative in ICC, I also helped boost our revenue due from ICC. As per the new revenue distribution model (2023-27), BCCI will be allocated a share of 38.5%. In the previous cycle, BCCI's revenue share stood at 22.4%.To me, one of your greatest achievements is your encouragement to women's cricket.When I decided to create WPL (Women's Premier League), I had a lot of convincing to do. One of the arguments I used was that 51% of IPL viewership was female. When we had the women's series against Australia in Navi Mumbai, we made the entrance free and we got a full house. I also insisted on pay parity because this would encourage women to come out and play. After my decision, I am glad to inform you that ICC also announced pay parity in prize money for the Women's World cup. We have also introduced a sports psychologist for the women's team and hired Amol Mazumdar as a dedicated coach for them.We did really well at the last ICC Men's World Cup 2023, but the final victory eluded us. I am optimistic that we will bring home the T20 World Cup trophy this year.It has a good balance between form and experience. The selectors cannot choose on the basis of IPL performance alone, as overseas experience is also necessary.India, Australia, New Zealand and the hosts, West Indies, because they are good in T20.As an administrator, I leave the cricketing decision to the experts. In BCCI, we have appointed VVS Laxman to look after NCA and Rahul Dravid as the Indian team coach. So, my job really is to choose the best and support them. I have full faith in them, and I know they are doing a fantastic job.Roger Binny is the cricketing brain. He is involved in each and every cricketing decision while I look after the administration and finance part. But finally, we do everything together. We have a very transparent and consultative process.Yes, talents like Yashaswi Jaiswal and Rinku Singh were test cases for BCCI. We empower state associations and give them guidelines to develop infrastructure, and we are searching for talent in all states. If they feel someone can do well for India, we recruit them to NCA. Right now, we have a pool of 50 players. So, if we need to play bilateral cricket with three different countries, we are in a position to do that. In NCA we train them to have all-round development, including helping them in personality development and wealth management.It's a test case. We are consulting players, franchisees and all concerned. I feel the matches are getting more interesting, more Indian players are getting a chance to play. If our consultations reveal dissatisfaction, we will change it.I don't quite agree. If you look at the game between LSG and SRH, LSG scored 165/4 in 20 overs. On that same pitch, SRH chased the target in around 9 overs without losing a wicket. Pitches are very good, created transparently and overseen by BCCI's central curator.This time we have introduced the 'smart' replay feature wherein the third umpire has access to all broadcast cameras operated by dedicated operators. The decision making for umpires and players' reviews have been much more time efficient due to this. This year we have also added a fast bowling insurance clause in the contract. So, if somebody gets injured, like Mayank Yadav, he will be compensated. We have a mega auction every third year. This will give an opportunity for players to get shuffled, providing different teams the opportunity to win the trophy. Another thing we have introduced is video graphing the entire process of bidding for new teams. It used to be a closed bid. Now all the bids are opened by the bidders themselves, providing complete transparency.A large proportion is pumped into state associations to improve their infrastructure and facilities. The major stream of revenues for BCCI is media rights and sponsorship of BCCI and IPL. In the case of IPL, the additional stream is franchise fee from IPL teams. From the revenues that BCCI generates, 70% is given to state associations for grassroots programmes, development of Infrastructure, conducting various tournaments across age groups, junior and senior levels to tap the talent across the length and breadth of the country. Then 26% of revenues are utilised for payment to players by way of retainership and match fees to men's international players, women's international players and domestic players. In case of IPL, the revenues are split 50:50 between BCCI and the 10 franchises, while 70% of franchise fee received by BCCI is also given to the associations.I love tennis and football. My favourite tennis player is Rafa Nadal who I believe is unbeatable on clay.Sunil Gavaskar of course, Sachin Tendulkar and MS Dhoni. From the current crop it's Virat Kohli , Rohit Sharma, Jasprit Bumrah and Hardik Pandya as well.As BCCI secretary, I need to remain neutral, but I'm proud of all IPL teams for their unique style and contribution to the league's success.Of course, the Narendra Modi stadium in Ahmedabad. It is the largest sports stadium in the world with great facilities. I took the responsibility and had the entire stadium built in two-and-a-half years.Put the right people to oversee the game and at the same time maintain transparency in financial matters. I am also inspired by Swami Vivekanand - 'Arise, awake and stop not till the goal is achieved'.I am glad you asked that question as many people seem to assume that I somehow directly became BCCI secretary. I started my career as a member of the Central Board of Cricket, Ahmedabad in 2009. After that I was elected as an executive member of Gujarat Cricket Association (GCA), a post I held from 2009 to 2013. When I took over the GCA administration our team was in the Plate group of Ranji Trophy. During my tenure we went on to win our first Ranji Trophy. We also won the Vijay Hazare as well as the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy twice. At BCCI I became member of the marketing committee in 2013. Then I became member of the Finance Committee and since 2019 I am the secretary, which was also an election process amongst all members (state cricket associations).",BCCI secretary Jay Shah spoke to Harsh Vardhan Goenka at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium.

Shikhar Dhawan says impact player rule's unavailability in T20 World Cup will be the differentiator,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/shikhar-dhawan-says-impact-player-rules-unavailability-in-t20-world-cup-will-be-the-differentiator/articleshow/110235757.cms,"(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Shikhar Dhawan believes that cricket has undergone significant changes this year but does not anticipate mind-boggling scores in the upcoming T20 World Cup , unlike in the IPL, due to the absence of the 'impact player' option during the tournament.The impact player rule , which allows teams to field an extra batter or bowler, is credited with contributing to the high scores seen in this IPL season, with totals exceeding 250 recorded eight times.This surge in high scores has reignited the debate over maintaining a balance between bat and ball, as IPL wickets and conditions generally favour batters.""I feel as if the game itself has changed this year, which is why scores of 250 are being put on. The mindset has certainly changed,"" Dhawan told PTI.""But when you go into the World Cup which won't have the impact player rule, the impact of it would be seen definitely. That is a differentiator and how we adapt to the conditions is what will matter the most.""The mindset has changed after the introduction of the impact player. When a batter in the middle knows that there is batting available till number 8 and 9, he is going to take the aggressive route which is why so many high scores are being made,"" the aggressive Indian opener, who will host a TV show 'Dhawan Karenge' on Jio Cinema, said.Dhawan expressed confidence in the Indian team's prospects for the upcoming T20 World Cup, which will be held in the Americas. He emphasized that the players enjoy their game under Rohit Sharma .""All bases have been covered. The team looks balanced and India have got a very good chance (of winning the title),"" he said.""Rohit is a seasoned captain and the boys are very happy and comfortable around him. We have got a very good and experienced side with amazing youngsters and we have a very good chance to win the World Cup,"" Dhawan added.Dhawan acknowledged Punjab Kings had a disappointing run in IPL this year, with the team failing to make the playoffs for the 10th year in a row.The experienced left-handed batter entered IPL as Punjab Kings' skipper but was sidelined due to a shoulder injury he suffered in early April.Dhawan said losing experienced players to injuries can also impact teams heavily.""I could play only five matches this year after which I got injured. We had won two matches until then. I stayed with the team and did my rehab, which is something I am doing even now. But the injury is serious and I will be out of action.""Even the team could not do well. Whenever experienced players get injured, it impacts the team.

NEW DELHI: Skipper Faf du Plessis spearheaded a powerful top-order performance as Royal Challengers Bengaluru amassed an impressive 218 for five against the reigning champions Chennai Super Kings in a crucial IPL match held in Bengaluru on Saturday.Du Plessis showcased his batting prowess, smashing three fours and three sixes en-route to a well-crafted 54 off 39 balls, marking his fourth half-century of the tournament.Virat Kohli , Rajat Patidar , and Cameron Green also joined the run-fest, contributing significantly to RCB 's formidable total.While Kohli struck a quick-fire 47 off 29 deliveries, Patidar and Green scored 41 off 23 balls and 38 off 17 balls respectively as they unleashed a barrage of sixes to put their team in a commanding position.According to the playoff qualification scenario, RCB, who made a fairytale turnaround with a five-match winning streak, needs to win by 18 runs at least to make the cut. CSK, however, will qualify if they score more than 200 at the expense of RCB even if they lose the game or if the match is washed out.In the battle for the last available playoffs berth, openers Kohli and du Plessis began on a positive note and were 31 for no loss when there was a short rain interruption, causing a 40-minute delay.However, on resumption, CSK pressed the spinners into the attack. With the ball gripping and turning, spin due of Maheesh Theekshana (25/0) and Mitchell Santner (23/0) troubled the batters as RCB reached 42 for no loss at the end of the Powerplay.Kohli brought out his slog sweep to clobber two more sixes before holing out to Daryl Mitchell off Santner as RCB slipped to 78 for one in 10 overs.Ravindra Jadeja (40/0 in 3 overs) was however slaughtered by du Plessis, who blasted a four and two sixes to pile up 20 runs off his third over and then completed his 35-ball fifty.Rajat Patidar (41) then got into the act, depositing Theekshana for a maximum.In the 13th over, du Plessis was unfortunately run out at the bowler's end but Patidar continued his onslaught, smashing Simarjeet Singh for a four and a six, while Thakur conceded 17 with Green thumping one over long-on to bring up the 150.Green was, however, dropped by Gaikwad in the deep but Patidar continued to put the bowler under pressure as he smoked Deshpande for two sixes.Green then picked up successive sixes off Thakur, who had Patidar caught at the other end but it was too late as cameos from Dinesh Kartik (14) and Glenn Maxwell (16) swelled the total.","Faf du Plessis hits 54 as Royal Challengers Bengaluru thrash Chennai Super Kings. Virat Kohli, Rajat Patidar and Cameron Green also hit sixes as RCB reach 218-5.

Many had written off Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) after they lost seven of their first eight games in the ongoing IPL 2024 season. But they proved naysayers wrong and won their next six games, the most important one on Saturday night when RCB beat five-time champions Chennai Super Kings (CSK) to qualify for the playoffs.After the epic win, a video of Virat Kohli describing how sometimes even a one percent chance is good enough went viral.""There is a one percent chance, and sometimes that chance is good enough.

NEW DELHI: Royal Challengers Bengaluru extended their fairytale run, securing the fourth and final playoff berth with a 27-run victory over defending champions Chennai Super Kings in their must-win last IPL league game on Saturday.This marked the sixth consecutive win for RCB, who initially posted a formidable total of 218 for five after being put in to bat.They then managed to restrict CSK to 191 for 7, securing their place in the playoffs for the ninth time in 15 seasons.Despite a late scare from Ravindra Jadeja (42 not out) and Mahendra Singh Dhoni (25), who raised hopes of a CSK comeback after Rachin Ravindra's 61, RCB's Yash Dayal maintained his composure in the final over to guide the hosts to victory.With Kolkata Knight Riders, Rajasthan Royals, and Sunrisers Hyderabad already qualified for the playoffs, RCB's victory solidified their spot in the upcoming playoff stage.While it was ecstasy for RCB, the legion of fans of Dhoni sank into despair as it could potentially be the last time they witnessed their 'Thala' perform on a cricket field.Down and out after losing seven out of their first eight games, RCB had weaved five wins on the trot to script a remarkable turnaround and give themselves a chance to make it to the final four.On Saturday, the hosts needed to win by at least 18 runs to book the final play-off berth and they did that in style with yet another impressive show at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium.The two teams finished at 14 points but RCB sneaked into the final four on the basis of a better net run-rate.The equation was in favour of CSK when they began their run-chase as a 200-plus score would have sealed their place in the final four at the expense of RCB even if they had lost the game.However, CSK lost skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad (0) and Daryl Mitchell (4) to be reduced to 19 for 2 in the third over.Ajinkya Rahane (33) and Ravindra (61) steadied the innings with a 64-run stand but Lockie Ferguson broke the partnership as the former was holed out by du Plessis and then the New Zealander was run out.Du Plessis then took a screamer to remove Mitchell Santner as CSK slipped to 129 for 6 in 15 overs.With their backs to the wall, Jadeja and Dhoni added a whirlwind 61 off 27 balls to bring the equation down to 11 off five balls to qualify for the play-offs.With CSK needing 17 runs off the last six balls to qualify, Yash Dayal bowled the final over and he was straight away smashed for a six by Dhoni but the pacer came back strongly to dismiss the former CSK skipper and then conceded just one run in next five balls to seal it for RCB.Earlier, sent in to bat, RCB's top-order, led by skipper du Plessis, fired in unison.Du Plessis hit three fours and three sixes on his way to a 39-ball 54, his fourth fifty of the season, while Virat Kohli (47 off 29 balls), Rajat Patidar (41 off 23 balls) and Cameron Green (38 not out off 17 balls) also went on a six-hitting spree to put RCB on solid ground.Openers Kohli and du Plessis began on a positive note and were 31 for no loss when there was a short rain interruption, causing a 40-minute delay.However, on resumption, CSK pressed spinners into the attack. With the ball gripping and turning, spin duo of Maheesh Theekshana (25/0) and Mitchell Santner (23/0) troubled the batters as RCB reached 42 for no loss at the end of the Powerplay.Kohli brought out his slog sweep to clobber two more sixes before holing out to Daryl Mitchell off Santner as RCB slipped to 78 for one in 10 overs.Ravindra Jadeja (40/0 in 3 overs) was however slaughtered by du Plessis, who blasted a four and two sixes to pile up 20 runs off his third over and then completed his 35-ball fifty.Rajat Patidar (41) then got into the act, depositing Theekshana for a maximum.In the 13th over, du Plessis was unfortunately run out at the bowler's end but Patidar continued his onslaught, smashing Simarjeet Singh for a four and a six, while Thakur conceded 17 with Green thumping one over long-on to bring up the 150.Green was, however, dropped by Gaikwad in the deep but Patidar continued to put the bowler under pressure as he smoked Deshpande for two sixes.Green then picked up successive sixes off Thakur, who had Patidar caught at the other end but it was too late as cameos from Dinesh Kartik (14) and Glenn Maxwell (16) swelled the total.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru secure fourth and final playoff berth with 27-run victory over defending champions Chennai Super Kings.

NEW DELHI: It turned out to be a dream night for Royal Challengers Bengaluru pacer Yash Dayal as he successfully defended 17 in the last over against the mighty duo of Ravindra Jadeja and MS Dhoni to steer his side into Indian Premier League 2024 playoffs.Dayal, who was remembered for his maligned over that saw Rinku Singh hit him for five consecutive sixes to win an improbable game last season, before tonight, rose to the occasion, bowling a perfect final over against Chennai Super Kings , knocking the defending champions out of the knockouts race.The win for RCB was their sixth on the trot as they successfully defended 218 to secure a place in the playoffs, beating CSK by 27 runs.CSK, who needed to score 201 to qualify for the playoffs, ended up scoring 191 for 7 as Dayal gave away just 7 runs in the final over of the thriller.Here's how Yash Dayal's final over turned out as he took RCB into the playoffs.Yash Dayal to MS Dhoni - SIX! As Dayal bowled a low full-toss on leg-stump, Dhoni went for a full-fledged swing and middled it to perfection. It turned out to be a mighty strike as the ball went over the fine-leg roof.Yash Dayal to MS Dhoni - OUT! After getting hit for a maximum first ball by the legend, Dayal hit back in style, getting rid of Dhoni second ball of the over. As Dayal bowled a back of the hand slower ball on the stumps, Dhoni swiped it and unfortunately only managed a top-edge. Swapnil Singh, at deep backward square-leg, got under the ball and then grabbed the catch with ease.Yash Dayal to Shardul Thakur - Dot ball! It was another back of the hand slower from Dayal and he dug it in this time. Shardul went for the hoick across and missed the ball completely. Keeper Dinesh Karthik too was alert as he denied the CSK batters a bye.Yash Dayal to Shardul Thakur - 1 run! With 11 needed off the last 3 ball, Dayal fired in another back of the hand slower ball on the stumps. As Shardul went for a slog and only managed an outside edge to third-man, he and Ravindra Jadeja managed a single off the fourth ball of the over.Yash Dayal to Ravindra Jadeja - Dot ball! With 10 needed off 2 balls, Dayal, once again relied on his slower ball and again executed to perfection, this time beating Jadeja and producing a match-winning dot ball. As Dayal fired in a back of the hand slower ball outside off, Jadeja missed the swing and the ball was inside the tramline. The dot ball meant CSK needed an almost impossible 100 off the last ball to qualify for the playoffs.Yash Dayal to Ravindra Jadeja - Dot ball! On the last ball, Dayal was just needed to bowl a legal ball to take RCB to playoffs. But the left-arm pacer did one better, bowling another dot ball to wrap up the game in style. As Jadeja swung on the final ball, Dayal slower ball once again deceived him as CSK were given the knocked out blow.",Royal Challengers Bengaluru beat Chennai Super Kings by 27 runs.

NEW DELHI: Star Indian batter Virat Kohli recently shared insights into his early career, highlighting two key figures who significantly contributed to his rise in international cricket.In a conversation with former cricketer Suresh Raina on JioCinema, Kohli revealed that during the 2008 Emerging Players tournament in Australia, then-chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar and Raina advocated for his inclusion in the national team.Kohli emphasized the importance of the Emerging Players tournament, which ran from 2005 to 2011, as a crucial platform for aspiring cricketers to secure a spot in the national side. Reflecting on his career, he also recalled two major ""heartbreaks"" he faced during his peak batting form in 2016.During the tournament, Kohli initially struggled while batting in the middle order under the leadership of Subramaniam Badrinath and was eventually benched. When Raina joined the tournament mid-way as captain, he inquired with coach Pravin Amre about Kohli's absence from the lineup. On Raina's insistence, Kohli was promoted to the opening spot, replacing Ajinkya Rahane. This decision marked a turning point in Kohli's performance.""That match happened against New Zealand (when he played as an opener) Dilip was our selector. One thing is that you have heard about someone, the other is that you have seen someone. That makes an different impact. You see someone play, absorb pressure etc. He saw me opening, I made 120. That is when he (Dilip) decided that more chances have to be given to me. I am very thankful to him, I told him before as well that he (Raina) pushed my name,"" said Kohli.In that tournament, Virat played six games and scored 206 runs at an average of 41.20, with a century and a fifty. His best score was 120*.That match would go on to change Virat's fortunes and he would make his international debut in August 2008 against Sri Lanka. After being in and out of the team due to the presence of seniors, it was the Emerging Players 2009 tournament that helped him establish himself as a permanent player for India. India won that tournament and Virat emerged as a top-scorer with 405 runs in nine games at an average of 50.62, with two centuries and two fifties. His best score was 115*.Speaking on one of his career's biggest heartbreaks, he revealed that not being able to win the 2016 ICC T20 World Cup and the IPL for his side was ""heartbreaking"" and the loss in the T20 WC drained him so much that he could not get out of his room.""There have been just two heartbreaks in my career, and both were in 2016. One was the T20 World Cup. I was in a space where I thought that I could do anything. The no-balls and everything, that took me a lot of time to get over I was literally drained and didn't get out of my room the next day,"" said Virat.""Then, when we lost the IPL final here (M. Chinnaswamy Stadium). We felt like that was written in the stars, from how we made it to the final. Also, the final was at our home ground. We were chasing 200-odd runs and were over 100 runs in nine overs with no loss. When AB (de Villiers) got out, we needed 68 off 42 balls with eight wickets in hand. It's like how did we lose that game?,"" he concluded.2016 was Virat's peak at batting. In 37 international matches, Virat scored 2,595 runs at an average of 86.50, with seven centuries and 13 fifties. In 15 T20Is, Virat scored 641 runs at an average of 106.83 and a strike rate of over 140, with seven fifties. His best score was 90*.Virat was also the top-scorer in the ICC T20 World Cup and won the 'Player of the Tournament' title. In five matches, he has scored 273 runs at an average of 136.50 and a strike rate of over 146, with three half-centuries. But still he could not prevent India's loss to West Indies in the semifinal.In the IPL 2016 as well, Virat emerged as the highest run-scorer and set the record for most runs in a single edition. He scored 973 runs at an average of 81.08 in 16 games, with four centuries and seven fifties. But RCB lost to Sunrisers Hyderabad in the final by eight runs.","Virat Kohli reveals how Suresh Raina and Dilip Vengsarkar pushed for his inclusion in the India team.

'Couldn't get over the line': CSK skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad on 27-run loss against RCB,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/couldnt-get-over-the-line-csk-skipper-ruturaj-gaikwad-on-27-run-loss-against-rcb/articleshow/110238692.cms,"(With ANI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Following Chennai Super Kings' 27-run defeat against Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the IPL 2024 , skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad admitted they couldn't get over the line at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium.Gaikwad himself had a disappointing performance, being dismissed for a golden duck on the first ball of the second innings by Glenn Maxwell.Speaking after the match, Gaikwad acknowledged that the wicket in Bengaluru was favorable, offering good turn and grip for the spinners.He noted that the team encountered numerous challenges in the game, including the absence of key players Matheesha Pathirana and Mustafizur Rahman.Gaikwad expressed his disappointment at failing to secure a place in the IPL 2024 play-offs.""It was a good wicket. For spinners, it was turning and gripping a little bit. I was pretty happy with what the target was. To sum up the season, I'm pretty happy with seven games out of 14. Injuries, not having Conway as well--made a lot of difference. Challenges right from the first game. Pathirana got injured, and we missed Fizz as well. When you have injuries, it is difficult to balance the squad. I couldn't get over the line, but these things can happen. For me, personal milestones don't matter a lot. After all, the ultimate prize is to win. We couldn't get it, so personally, I'm slightly disappointed as well,"" Gaikwad said.Coming to the match, CSK won the toss and opted to bat first. RCB put on a fine score of 218/5 on the board, with skipper Faf Du Plessis (54 in 39 balls, with three fours and three sixes), Virat Kohli (47 in 29 balls, with three fours and four sixes) putting on a 78-run partnership, setting a fine platform for Rajat Patidar (41 in 23 balls, with two fours and four sixes) and Cameron Green (38* in 17 balls, with three fours and three sixes) to put on a 71-run stand for the third wicket.Cameos from Dinesh Karthik (14 in six balls, with a four and six) and Glenn Maxwell (16 in five balls, with two fours and a six) took RCB to a 200-run plus total.RCB needed to restrict CSK below 201 runs to qualify for the playoffs and surpass their net-run-rate.In the run chase of 219 runs and the task of scoring 201 runs at least to book the top four spot, CSK lost two wickets early and were reduced to 19/2. Rachin Ravindra (61 in 37 balls, with five fours and three sixes) and Ajinkya Rahane (33 in 22 balls, with three fours and a six) put up a 66-run stand to bring the side into the game.RCB sunk CSK to 129/6, but a partnership between Ravindra Jadeja (42* in 22 balls, with three fours and three sixes) and MS Dhoni (25* in 13 balls, with three fours and a six) threatened to take the match away from RCB. However, Yash Dayal defended 11 runs in the final over, restricting CSK to just 191/7 in 20 overs.RCB is in fourth place with seven wins and seven losses, with 14 points. CSK is in the fifth spot with seven wins and seven losses, but they have slid down to fifth due to a lower net-run rate.",Ruturaj Gaikwad's Chennai Super Kings lose to Royal Challengers Bengaluru.

NEW DELHI: Royal Challengers Bengaluru skipper Faf du Plessis dedicated his player-of-the-match award to pacer Yash Dayal , who maintained his composure in the final over to secure a 27-run victory over Chennai Super Kings in the battle for the final IPL play-off spot.Du Plessis earned the player-of-the-match title for his impressive 54 off 39 balls. Alongside Virat Kohli's 47, their partnership laid a strong foundation, leading RCB to a formidable total of 218 for five on Saturday night.Chasing a daunting target, CSK needed over 200 runs to qualify and came remarkably close, with Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Ravindra Jadeja launching a fierce counterattack towards the end.CSK required 17 runs off the final over, but despite Dhoni hitting a towering six off the first ball, Dayal kept his nerves and ensured RCB's victory.""I dedicate the Man of the Match (award) to Yash Dayal! I said to him pace off on this wicket is the best option,"" Du Plessis said during the post-match presentation ceremony.""What a night! Such a great atmosphere. Just a pleasure to finish the season in front of the home fans. There was a lot of rain falling on the pitch, and you don't want that moisture. It felt like a day-five Test match in Ranchi!""Rain threat was looming on the match and there was a 40-minute rain interruption too but it didn't matter in the end.""The contributions from many batters at good strikes, I'm really proud. We were defending 175 (and neither 201 nor 218)! We tried to get the ball changed tonight.""It's crazy; even when we weren't winning, we had the fans here. It was set up perfectly - CSK vs RCB! Incredible.""CSK skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad said missing out on key players made a huge difference as they finished fifth in the standing.""I think it was a good wicket to be honest, it was spinning and gripping a little bit, but I think 200 on this ground was gettable. We kept losing wickets at regular intervals, it was a matter of one or two hits, sometimes that can happen in a T20 game ,"" he said.""Pretty happy with what the target was, to sum up the season, I am pretty happy to have seven wins out of 14 games. Just couldn't get over the line in the last two balls.""With the kind of injuries we had, missing out on two frontline bowlers, not having (Devon) Conway at the top of the order as well, I think missing out on three key players made a huge difference.""Talking about the spate of injuries which affected the team, Gaikwad said: ""There were many challenges for us right throughout the first game. Injury to Fizz (Mustafiur Rahman), then injruy to (Matheesha) Pathirana as well, he came back and then again Pathirana missed out. When you have injuries around, you have to get that balance in the team and pick it (the team) for every game.""I think this season sums up well where we had to tinker around with our playing XI, considering the injuries and all the illness (of the players) as well. Happy with the seven wins, couldn't get over the line though. Happy with it.""We got 10 from the last 2 balls in our last knockout game last year so this was a similar situation, things didn't go our way (this season) though,"" he added.Gaikwad has been one of the top run-scorer this season but he said it doesn't matter as he couldn't take the team to the play-offs.""For me, personal milestones don't really matter a lot, after all the ultimate goal is to win. If you are not getting there it's a disappointment. Doesn't matter if you score 100 runs or 500-600 runs in a season. I am disappointed,"" he said.",Royal Challengers Bengaluru beat Chennai Super Kings by 27 runs. RCB captain Faf du Plessis dedicates player-of-the-match award to pacer Yash Dayal.

You prefer to have some good match practice before you go into a final, but we can't control that. We have confidence and we have played some pretty good cricket over the home and away fixtures, so we'll go in with confidence that we've played enough good cricket to make the playoffs,” he said on Saturday.“We have had lots of time to reflect on the season and look at the areas that we felt we've done very well, and we've also reflected on areas we'd still like to improve. But most importantly, we've rested, rejuvenated. These things happen during tournaments, so we've just got to make sure that we're mentally ready to execute our plans in tomorrow's important match,” added the Australian.Meanwhile, Jitesh Sharma, who will lead Punjab Kings in the absence of their stand-in skipper Sam Curran, said his team will come out all guns blazing in the final game. “Punjab Kings are known for their fearless cricket. This being our last and we have nothing to lose, we will play more fearless cricket. Everyone will play with good intent and will play for victory,” he said.Jitesh also said they were unlucky to lose a few close games in the season despite playing good cricket. ""There were a few games which we lost in the last over. There are so many positives in this tournament for us. We got Shashank (Singh), Ashutosh (Sharma) who are very good. We have bowlers who are in good form. We will play with intent,” he assured.On being asked whether the departure of English players – Curran, Jonny Bairstow and Liam Livingstone – will put the team under pressure, he said, “I don’t think so. Whoever were selected into the team, have quality. English players’ absence will give opportunity to other players and it is a good chance to test their skills.”Jitesh has been in indifferent form this season scoring only 155 runs in 11 innings.

KOLKATA: Sunil Chhetri is at peace with himself now. A day after announcing his retirement from international football , he woke up on Friday with 688 missed calls on his cell phone.“It isn’t easy,” he said with a smile.It was a decision driven by instinct. It was a decision taken in consultation with Indian cricket star and his friend, Virat Kohli.“I discussed with him (Kohli) because we both understand the ups and downs of a career and take the step of calling time on it,” Chhetri said during a virtual interaction with media persons from Bhubaneswar, where Igor Stimac’s India are preparing for the upcoming FIFA 2026 World Cup qualifiers.As Chhetri gets ready for his swansong in the Blue Tigers’ jersey with the clash against Kuwait at the Salt Lake Stadium on June 6, the legendary Indian with 94 goals and 150 matches opened up on his 19-year journey and more.I don’t know the exact date, but probably 10 to 15 days after the Afghanistan game (which India lost 1-2 in Guwahati in the World Cup qualifiers on March 26) I started thinking about retirement. I was fighting with myself, trying to think holistically. Eventually it came with an instinct and when it came it was so individualistic, so narrow that I was taking time and it wasn’t easy. But now I am at peace with my decision.I’m very optimistic about the future of Indian football . There is a lot of fight for different positions. When you talk about the No. 9 one, there are a lot of candidates doing well. Unfortunately, they don’t play enough games in that position in the ISL. And in due time, I hope that changes. If you take this season’s two finalists (Mumbai City and Mohun Bagan SG), Liston Colaco and Manvir Singh or Bipin Singh, Vikram Pratap (Singh) and Chhangte or (Anirudh) Thapa playing as No. 10 or Sahal (Abdul Samad)...all these attacking players are really doing well. I do understand that No. 9 is a specific one, but I’m pretty sure that with the talent we have and the structure we have, we’ll get one.I don’t feel hollow, not reaching a hundred doesn’t bother me at all. 150 games — that’s the number that I really love. Playing 150 matches will be on top of everything if I have to tell my son what I had achieved as a footballer.I’ve never paid any heed to such things earlier. But now I may be thinking more about it. A very good-looking and hard-working player — this is how I would like to be remembered as.I’ll probably do coaching licenses just to be more knowledgeable (about the game). You see all these coaches who are handsome and in one year they lose hair and everything. I don’t want to lose my hair and grow older! I’ll think (about my future role) during my sabbatical but coaching is not very higher on my agenda right now.One or two years maximum. I am with Bengaluru FC for another year.

NEW DELHI: Lionel Messi is expected to rejoin Inter Miami 's starting lineup on Saturday night when the Herons face DC United at home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.The Argentine superstar sat out Wednesday night's goalless draw against Orlando City due to a knee problem, marking his fifth absence from league play for the Eastern Conference leaders (8-2-4, 28 points).In the five matches without Messi, the Herons have managed only one victory and two draws. However, they remain undefeated in the nine games he has featured in, securing seven wins in the process.Messi's absence on Wednesday seemed to be more of a precautionary measure for load management. Coach Tata Martino expressed optimism about the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner's return for Saturday's match, and Messi's name was not listed on the league's player availability report released on Friday night. ""We trained well yesterday, and we hope to train well today. We will define it after training, but we are optimistic about (Saturday's) match,"" Martino said Friday, via an interpretation from Spanish by USA Today.With 10 goals and a league-leading 12 assists, Messi has been in scintillating form this season. His former FC Barcelona teammate, Luis Suarez , is among three MLS players tied for the top spot in the goalscoring charts with 11 goals.DC United's Christian Benteke , who also has 11 goals to his name, failed to find the back of the net in his team's 4-1 home defeat to the New York Red Bulls on Wednesday night. Despite missing some excellent opportunities to claim the outright lead in the goalscoring race, Benteke's chances may not have altered the outcome against the Red Bulls, who posed a consistent threat on the counter-attack.The loss marked the third occasion this season where DC (4-4-5, 17 points) have conceded three or more goals at home. ""I mean listen, I think everyone was disappointed the other night, and the things that we didn't get right, we try to address in a really short time. And I think that's just trying to identify where some of the game got away from us. And I think a lot of those things are controllables,"" DC coach Troy Lesesne said.Away from home, DC have proven to be a tough side to beat, drawing four out of six matches and securing their first road victory last weekend with a 3-2 win over Atlanta United, courtesy of Benteke's second hat trick of the campaign.

NEW DELHI: Pep Guardiola has warned that Manchester City cannot take anything for granted as they seek to claim an unprecedented fourth consecutive Premier League title against West Ham on Sunday.City currently lead Arsenal by two points going into the final day of the season, meaning they control their destiny in the title race.Guardiola highlighted the importance of remaining vigilant and focused, recalling the dramatic final day two years ago when City had to come from 2-0 down late on to beat Aston Villa 3-2, securing the title and denying Liverpool .This serves as a reminder of the unpredictable nature of football and the need for City to maintain their concentration until the very end.In their recent match, City faced a tough challenge from Tottenham, eventually winning 2-0. Despite many Spurs fans wanting their own side to lose to prevent their north London rivals Arsenal from claiming their first title in 20 years, City had to work hard to secure the victory.Guardiola's cautious approach underscores the competitive nature of the Premier League and the necessity for City to give their all in the decisive match against West Ham.""We would like to be 3-0 up after 10 minutes but that's not going to happen,"" Guardiola said at his pre-match press conference on Friday.""I'm ready for it to be a tough, tough game. I want to put in the mind of the players, 'Look at Tottenham, how they fought for every ball'.""It was the same with Aston Villa two years ago -- they were in the same position, they didn't have anything to play for -- and we know what happened.""Our people have to come here and be ready from the first minute, to be with us and do it together.""City are attempting to become the first side in history to win four straight English top-flight titles and are on the brink of a sixth Premier League win in the past seven seasons.Guardiola batted away suggestions that his side do not get the credit they deserve for the scale of those achievements.""I don't know what people think but if you ask all the Premier League teams at the start of the season, they would want to be in our position,"" he said.""We have one game left, destiny in our hands. Win our game and we will be champions.""They (the players) know it is win or win, otherwise Arsenal will be champions.""",Pep Guardiola has warned that Manchester City cannot take anything for granted as they seek to claim an unprecedented fourth consecutive Premier League title.

""In those days, it was common for Kolkata's big clubs to hold trials for aspiring footballers regularly in a move to catch them young. As the head coach of Mohun Bagan 's senior football team, I was privileged to oversee such trials and recommend who would be offered a contract.""There was a diminutive guy playing as a striker in one such trial match and he caught me by surprise when he scored from a bicycle kick. The goal was straight from the page of Shyam Thapa's skill-book. 'Sign him,' I told the club management after seeing that goal,"" the former Mohun Bagan defender and coach recalled.A week later, he was signed on a three-year contract with Mohun Bagan.And this was how Sunil Chhetri 's career as a professional footballer took wing in 2002 on the famed Maidan at the age of 17 years.""He was diminutive, but his spot-jump was excellent, allowing him to beat a defender in the air and score many goals during his time at Mohun Bagan under my coaching,"" Bhattacharya pointed out.After India's World Cup qualifier against Kuwait in Kolkata this June, Chhetri in the India jersey would also be the past.Little did Bhattacharya realize during that pre-season trial in 2002 how the diminutive dynamo would explode in theIndian football landscape in the next couple of decades. Little did the Bagan coach realize that he would one day welcome him as son-in-law.After courting Bhattacharya's daughter Sonam for many years, Chhetri tied the knot with her on Dec 4 in 2017.Although he had represented India in the Asian School Championship in 2001, Chhetri 's main objective was to get admission in Delhi's St Stephen's College through sports quota. But that contract with Mohun Bagan changed his life completely.""I never realized that he would grow into such a legend. As a player, I've got to put Sunil in the class of Chunni Goswami, Balaram and Parimal Dey. His dedication, discipline and hunger should always be an example for the future generation,"" Bhattacharya maintained.And as a son-in-law? Bhattacharya smiled. ""We don't usually talk about football at home. Sunil has taken his game to such a height that I've hardly anything to suggest to him. But I want him to remain involved in the game. It's his call to take,"" the 72-year-old said.",Subrata Bhattacharya was the head coach of Mohun Bagan's senior football team.
