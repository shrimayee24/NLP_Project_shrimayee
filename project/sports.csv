NEW DELHI: Rajasthan Royals captain Sanju Samson's valiant effort of 86 runs off 46 balls, which included six sixes and eight boundaries, was not enough to secure a victory against Delhi Capitals. Nevertheless, Mukesh Kumar and Kuldeep Yadav have re-entered the race for the IPL 2024 purple cap.His dismissal in the 16th over, which sparked controversy due to a close call on the boundary line, led to Rajasthan finishing at 201-8, suffering their third loss of the season.Despite the defeat, Rajasthan Royals remain in second place on the points table with 16 points, behind leaders Kolkata Knight Riders on net run-rate. Delhi Capitals, with 12 points, are now tied with three other teams - Chennai Super Kings, Sunrisers Hyderabad, and Lucknow Super Giants - as the race for the playoffs intensifies.The turning point of the match came when Shai Hope took a brilliant catch on the edge of the boundary at long-on to dismiss Samson. The Rajasthan captain exchanged words with the on-field umpires after the television umpire, Michael Gough, declared him out, as replays from one angle suggested that Hope might have touched the boundary line.Following Samson's dismissal, Rajasthan's run-chase faltered, losing five wickets for just 39 runs, with left-arm spinner Kuldeep Yadav (2-25) striking twice in one over to seal the game for the home team.In the Purple Cap tally, Mukesh Kumar and Kuldeep Yadav have re-entered the top 10 after their impressive performances in Delhi Capitals' win over Rajasthan Royals. Mukesh currently occupies the sixth position with 15 wickets in eight matches, while Kuldeep, with 14 wickets, takes the eighth spot in the bowlers' leaderboard.SEE ALSO: IPL 2024 Orange Cap Standings Jasprit Bumrah continues to lead the Purple Cap table with 18 wickets in 12 matches, despite taking only one wicket against Sunrisers Hyderabad. Harshal Patel of Punjab Kings and KKR's Varun Chakaravarthy follow closely behind with 17 and 16 wickets, respectively.T Natarajan of Sunrisers Hyderabad has slipped from the top-three to fourth position with 15 wickets, while Arshdeep Singh of Punjab Kings rounds out the top five with 15 wickets as well.",The IPL Purple Cap 2024 will be the largest in the history of the Indian Premier League. The cap will be worth a total of $1.2 billion. It is the largest cap in the league's history. It will also be the most expensive in the world.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109940827,imgsize-31764,width-400,resizemode-4/109940827.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) and Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) are set to face off in a pivotal Indian Premier League match on Wednesday, both teams having accumulated 12 points from 11 games. SRH are marginally ahead in the race for the top four, thanks to a better net run rate. The upcoming clash is crucial for both sides as they aim to secure a spot in the playoffs.SRH, led by Pat Cummins , are looking to improve their batting performance after a series of losses.Their last defeat came against Mumbai Indians, where they failed to set a challenging target. Travis Head has been a standout player for SRH, but others, including Abhishek Sharma and Heinrich Klaasen, have struggled to maintain form. Coach Daniel Vettori has emphasized the need for the middle order to contribute more consistently.On the bowling front, SRH have shown more promise, with T Natarajan and Bhuvneshwar Kumar delivering strong performances. Kumar's efforts were instrumental in SRH's narrow win against Rajasthan Royals.LSG, in contrast, are recovering from a disappointing outing against Kolkata Knight Riders, where they allowed the first-ever 200-plus score at the Ekana Stadium and were bowled out for 137. The team's captain, KL Rahul, and power hitters like Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran have not been at their best. Ayush Badoni, an uncapped Indian talent, is also looking to make a significant impact after a quiet tournament so far.The bowling department for LSG has been hampered by injuries, with Mayank Yadav out of the IPL and Mohsin Khan also sidelined. The responsibility now falls on Naveen-ul-Haq, Yash Thakur , Stoinis, and spinners Krunal Pandya and Ravi Bishnoi to step up their game.In their encounters thus far in the IPL, Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) have faced Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) three times, with LSG emerging victorious in each match. Despite SRH's efforts, they have been unable to secure a win against LSG in the tournament. This head-to-head record underscores LSG's dominance over SRH in their IPL clashes.The Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium has hosted a total of 75 IPL matches, with teams winning 34 times while batting first and 41 times while chasing.The average first innings total at this venue stands at 162.13 runs, with teams scoring at a rate of 8.13 runs per over and averaging 26.55 runs per wicket. The highest total recorded at this stadium was 277/3 by SRH against MI in 2024, while the lowest total was 80/10 by DC against SRH in 2013.In the last 10 matches played at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, teams batting first have had a significant advantage, winning 8 out of 10 matches. The average first innings score in these matches was 185.4 runs, with the winning first-innings score averaging slightly higher at 192 runs. Teams have been particularly aggressive in the powerplay overs, averaging 56 runs, while maintaining a steady scoring rate of 53.7 runs in the death overs.The Hyderabad wicket has proven to be a paradise for batters at the start of IPL 2024, offering favourable conditions conducive to high-scoring encounters. Batsmen have relished the opportunity to capitalize on the true bounce and even pace, resulting in exhilarating contests with towering totals.However, when Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) hosted Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB), the Hyderabad wicket took on a different character. It revealed its unpredictability, challenging both batsmen and bowlers alike with its variable behaviour, turning what was anticipated to be another run-fest into a more nuanced and strategic battle.1) The Hyderabad wicket, known for its even bounce and true pace, typically favours batsmen at the start of IPL 2024. With the pitch offering little assistance to bowlers, selecting top-order batsmen who can capitalize on the favourable batting conditions early in the innings could yield high fantasy points. Look for batsmen with a track record of scoring big on flat tracks.2) Despite its reputation as a batter-friendly surface, the Hyderabad wicket can throw surprises, especially when hosting specific matchups like SRH against Royal Challengers Bengaluru. In such contests, bowlers who can exploit any hint of unpredictability in the pitch and adapt their bowling strategy accordingly become valuable fantasy picks. Consider selecting bowlers with variations and the ability to thrive in challenging conditions.Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Mayank Agarwal, Nitish Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen(wk), Glenn Phillips, Abdul Samad, Shahbaz Ahmed, Pat Cummins, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jaydev Unadkat/Umran Malik.T NatarajanKL Rahul(c), Quinton de Kock, Marcus Stoinis, Nicholas Pooran, Deepak Hooda, Ayush Badoni, Krunal Pandya, Ravi Bishnoi, Mohsin Khan, Naveen-ul-Haq, Yash Thakur.Arshin Kulkarni444 runs in 10 matchesTravis Head has been a formidable force for Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in IPL 2024, amassing an impressive total of 444 runs in just 10 matches.

The Australian fast bowler's ability to consistently trouble batsmen and pick up crucial breakthroughs has made him a valuable fantasy pick, offering the potential for significant points in each match he plays.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Capitals emerged victorious against Rajasthan Royals by 20 runs, keeping their hopes alive for a spot in the IPL play-offs.

Rajasthan's chase looked promising after Samson's fifth half-century of the season, but his dismissal, caught in the deep and ruled clean by the third umpire, shifted the momentum in Delhi's favour. Rajasthan lost three more wickets in quick succession, and Delhi restricted them to 201-8, securing their sixth win in 12 matches.Spinner Kuldeep Yadav impressed with figures of 2-25, while fast bowlers Khaleel Ahmed and Mukesh Kumar also claimed two wickets each.

WATCH VIDEO OF GOENKA TALKING TO RAHUL AFTER THE MATCH

After Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) got hammered by Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in an unbelievable run-chase pulled off by Hyderabad openers Abhishek Sharma and Travis Head, Lucknow skipper KL Rahul found himself at the receiving end of an animated discussion with franchise's owner Sanjiv Goenka near the LSG dugout but maintained his calm.Chasing LSG's below-par 165 for 4, Hyderabad openers launched an almost unreal attack on Lucknow bowlers to reach the target in a mere 9.4 overs and register a massive 10-wicket win.Hitting 14 sixes and 16 fours collectively, Head and Abhihsek smashed 89* off just 30 balls and 75* off only 28 balls, respectively.Before being clueless against SRH's attack as a captain, Rahul had a forgettable outing as a batsman, scoring 29 off 33 balls. It was only because of Nicholas Pooran's 48* off 26 balls and Ayush Badoni's 55* off 30 that LSG could put up a competitive total on the board.Scenes that unfolded on the sidelines after the match showed team's owner Goenka involved in a serious dicussion with Rahul on the outcome of the match.The defeat pushed LSG down to number six on the points table after their sixth defeat in 12 matches, thereby making the team's task of qualifying for the playoffs tougher. SRH moved up to number three with their seventh win in 12 matches.As the footage of Goenka talking to Rahul was being aired on live broadcast, the commentators said: ""You always feel these conversations should always be behind closed doors. There are so many cameras that miss nothing, and KL Rahul is not going to go at press conferences and various other things and probably potentially explain what is being discussed there. He has done well here to keep his cool.""","Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) lost to Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) by 10 wickets.

Skipper KL Rahul struggled, contributing only 29 runs to the team's total.In the latter half of the innings, Ayush Badoni (55*) and Nicholas Pooran (48*) orchestrated a remarkable recovery with a crucial 99-run partnership, guiding LSG to a competitive total of 165/4 in their allotted 20 overs. Bhuvneshwar Kumar emerged as the top bowler for LSG, claiming 2 wickets, while Pat Cummins also chipped in with a wicket.In the pursuit of 166 runs, SRH openers Travis Head (89*) and Abhishek Sharma (75*) launched a relentless onslaught on the LSG bowlers, steering their team to victory in just 9.4 overs without losing a single wicket.With this emphatic win, SRH strengthened their position in the IPL standings, occupying the third spot with seven wins, five losses, and 14 points, while LSG remained in sixth place with six wins, six losses, and 12 points.","Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) became the first team ever to achieve 100-plus runs twice during the powerplay.

IPL 2024: Kuldeep Yadav steals a march over Yuzvendra Chahal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/ipl-2024-kuldeep-yadav-steals-a-march-over-yuzvendra-chahal/articleshow/109964133.cms,"|

Around five years back, Kuldeep Yadav 's career was at the crossroads, especially in the white-ball formats. Playing for the Kolkata Knight Riders , he endured a horrid IPL 2019, taking just four wickets in nine matches @71.50, with an economy rate of 8.66. In the ODI World Cup that year in England, he managed to take just six wickets in seven matches@56.16, with an economy rate of 5.02.Many felt that he needed to bowl much quicker through the air, as he was giving time to the batters to play their shots. However, those days are now well behind the Chinaman bowler from Kanpur.In the current IPL, Kuldeep, now bowling much faster through the air (so quick that he even broke a bail in one of the matches when he cleaned up a batter), has been brilliant, having taken 14 wickets in just nine matches@20.50, and an economy rate of 8.20.Despite missing a few games due to a groin niggle, the 29-year-old didn't lose his rhythm. His fine show with the ball has been critical to the Delhi Capitals . They are still in the race for a playoffs berth, having won six of their 12 matches. It's clear that Kuldeep, presently probably the best spinner in IPL-2024, will be India's No 1 spinner in the T20 World Cup next month in the West Indies and USA.In comparison, Yuzvendra Chahal , whose impressive start for the Rajasthan Royals in this IPL helped him stage a return into the Indian team for the World Cup, has struggled for form in the last few matches, and, in a worrying sign for India, is being taken apart by the batters. In the last five matches, Yuzi's figures read 1-54, 1-48, 0-41, 0-62 & 1-48.When batters have gone after him, Chahal has struggled to find a way to survive. The flat pitches and the 'Impact Player' rule, which allows another specialist batter to come in, have hurt his case.At this rate, Chahal could mostly be sitting in the dugout in the World Cup, with Kuldeep joining Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel in the XI. Still, Chahal, who has bagged 14 wickets in 11 matches@29.71 in the IPL so far and has performed superbly in this tournament in the past, can bounce back with a much better show in the business end of the tournament.",Kuldeep Yadav has taken 14 wickets in just nine matches for Delhi Capitals.

This is not five runs per over wicket.Somebody needed to show intent. They had one of the slowest Powerplays. That took the innings nowhere. When the opposition team has Travis Head , Heinrich Klaasen, your intention should be to go at 10s and over. 160-170 will never be enough,"" Hayden remarked while doing commentary, pinpointing the fundamental flaw in LSG's approach to batting.Despite LSG's head coach, Justin Langer , suggesting that 160 would be a competitive total on the allegedly difficult pitch, Sunrisers Hyderabad's record-breaking chase swiftly debunked that notion. Travis Head's explosive unbeaten knock of 89 off just 30 balls, supported by Abhishek Sharma 's blistering 75 not out, underscored the missed opportunity for Lucknow.Following the defeat, LSG find themselves in a precarious position in the IPL standings, with their playoff hopes hanging by a thread.Former RCB coach Mike Hesson emphasized the impact of injuries on LSG's bowling lineup, pointing out the absence of key players like Mayank Yadav and Mohsin Khan.""I think yes,"" Hesson remarked on Jio Cinema, regarding LSG's dwindling playoff chances. ""With Mayank Yadav missing, they don't really have that X-factor in their bowling. Even Mohsin Khan didn't play today. Ravi Bishnoi hasn't been at his best this IPL. So their bowling attack doesn't look threatening. Their slide will continue,"" he added.The successive defeats have cast a shadow over Lucknow Super Giants' campaign in this year's IPL, raising questions about their ability to bounce back and secure a playoff berth amidst mounting challenges.","Former Australian opener Matthew Hayden criticizes Lucknow Super Giants.

NEW DELHI: Real Madrid showcased their renowned comeback prowess to secure a dramatic 2-1 second-leg victory over Bayern Munich at the Santiago Bernabeu , sealing their path to the Champions League final .Trailing behind on aggregate, Real faced the prospect of elimination as Bayern substitute Alphonso Davies unleashed a stunning strike in the 68th minute.However, a late surge from Real, orchestrated by substitute Joselu, turned the tide of the match.Joselu's equalizer in the 88th minute, capitalizing on a rare error from Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer , injected new life into the Bernabeu. Moments later, he secured the win with a second goal, albeit controversially initially ruled out for offside before being awarded following a VAR review .Reflecting on the team's indomitable spirit, midfielder Jude Bellingham remarked, ""We've seen it a lot of times this season when it looked as though we're dead and buried ... it doesn’t matter who scores the goals but someone always manages it... that mentality of never say die.""Real Madrid's dominance throughout the game was evident, with Vinicius Jr leading the charge down the left channel and Neuer putting up a valiant defense for Bayern.

Had these boys batted first, they would've scored 300,"" Tendulkar wrote in his X account.The Head and Sharma show came after SRH bowlers started brilliantly before losing the plot a bit.Ayush Badoni (55 not out off 30 balls) and Nicholas Pooran (48 not out off 25 balls) stitched crucial 95-runs off 55 balls for the unbeaten fifth-wicket stand to guide LSG to a competitive 165 for four on a sluggish pitch.But the Head and Sharma took any hint of competition out of the match once they bludgeoned 107 runs in the Power Play.It was an awesome hitting display from the Indo-Australian pair as they didn't spare a single LSG bowler, clobbering them to all parts of the ground.LSG's decision to start with Krishnappa Gowtham also backfired badly as both Head and Sharma, who are really good against spin, dismantled the off-spinner.Such was the brutal assault that the likes Yash Dayal, Ravi Bishnoi and Naveen-ul-Haq were also taken to the cleaners, raining sixes and fours.Earlier, LSG were struggling at 27 for 2 at the end of the powerplay after opting to bat.The visitors lost Quinton de Kock, who replaced an injured Mohsin Khan, early, caught brilliantly by Nitish Kumar Reddy at deep backward square-leg off Bhuvneshwar Kumar (2/12) in the third over.Bhuvneshwar struck again in the fifth over, dismissing the dangerous Marcus Stoinis but the credit for the dismissal should go to young Sanvir Singh, who took a stunning diving catch just inches from the ground at mid-on.The pitch also didn't help LSG's cause as the ball was coming on to the bat a bit slow, as their batters found it difficult to find the timing.While skipper KL Rahul (29) held one end up, Krunal Pandya (24) took it on himself to up the ante.Krunal pummelled Jaydev Unadkat for a six over long-on and then hit the bowler straight over his head for another maximum to accumulate 15 runs in the eighth over.Rahul hit the first boundary of LSG innings in the 10th over, slamming SRH skipper Pat Cummins over mid-off.But Rahul never looked at his usual best as he struggled to get his timing and finally departed in search of quick runs, caught by T Natarajan at deep backward square leg in the final delivery of the same over.SRH were brilliant on the field as Cummins' direct throw from mid-on sent Krunal packing soon when the batter went for a quick single.Badoni pressed the feet on the accelerator soon with three boundaries of left-arm pacer Natarajan's 14th over which yielded 17 runs.The Lucknow side finally got going as Pooran and Badoni struck a six and a four to accumulate 12 runs off the 15th over bowled by leg-spinner Vijayakanth Viyaskanth.They showed intent from the word go and didn't hesitate to play their strokes when the opportunity was presented to them.It was brilliant batting from Badoni as he swept and cut Natarajan for two consecutive boundaries in the 17th over.Badoni displayed some cheeky shots as the right-hander notched up his fifty in 28 balls.",Sunrisers Hyderabad beat Lucknow Super Giants by 10 wickets in IPL.

(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: West Indies pace legend Courtney Walsh expressed no surprise at India's strategic move to include four spinners in their T20 World Cup squad, citing it as a strategic alignment with their strengths.India's selectors recently announced the inclusion of Kuldeep Yadav , Yuzvendra Chahal , Axar Patel , and Ravindra Jadeja in their 15-man squad for the prestigious event, scheduled to commence on June 1 in the USA and West Indies.""India picking four spinners I'm not surprised... it seems to be their strength,"" Walsh told PTI on the sidelines of the launch of the Big Cricket League.""West Indies have picked three spinners. It's going to be different conditions and everybody has to balance the team,"" Walsh added.India's skipper Rohit Sharma recently revealed his preference for having four spinners in the side, though he didn't explicitly state the rationale behind this decision. Speculation suggests it could be due to the slow and sluggish wickets expected in the West Indies or the unusually early starts.Walsh, a highly esteemed figure in cricketing circles, believes that India's choice aligns with their potential challenges on the pitch. He further acknowledges that India possesses a quality pace-bowling unit to complement their spinners, indicating a balanced approach to their bowling lineup.""India still have quality fast bowlers, most of the teams do, so it will be a very competitive tournament. The majority of the teams have good-quality fast bowlers and spinners.""It's (the tournament) going to be dominated by the bat possibly. But it is difficult to predict who is going to win it, difficult to predict which bowler is going to be a standout. The teams that execute well will be successful.""With West Indies co-hosting the tournament, former captain Courtney Walsh holds an optimistic outlook on the two-time champions' prospects at the upcoming T20 World Cup this summer.""I'm expecting them to do very well. It's a nice balanced team and I am very optimistic that they'll play quality cricket. The group is not the easiest but once we reach the super sixes, there's a really good chance.""The first bowler to achieve the historic milestone of 500 Test wickets, gracing the cricketing field from 1984 to 2001, was none other than Walsh himself. Over the course of his illustrious career spanning 17 years, Walsh claimed a total of 519 scalps from 132 Tests.Partnered with another legendary fast bowler, Curtly Ambrose, Walsh formed one of the most formidable and iconic pace-bowling pairs in cricketing history.Remarkably, Walsh enjoyed a relatively injury-free career, a testament to his exceptional skill, endurance, and dedication to the game.Asked what advice he'll give to Bumrah, Walsh said, ""Stay fit, have fun. The more you play the more experienced you get.""""It's all about managing the injuries well. That will help him become fitter, stronger and better. You can only play if you are fit enough.""Young pace sensation Joseph captured the cricketing world's attention earlier this year with his remarkable skills, playing a pivotal role in bowling West Indies to their first Test victory in Australia in 27 years.Amidst the trend of Caribbean players participating in various T20 leagues worldwide, Walsh emphasises the importance of protecting the 24-year-old Joseph to ensure a sustainable and prosperous career for the promising talent.""West Indies have to (protect him), he's got to protect himself. When I watch his interviews he has a very level head, which is very, very good to see. He loves the game, has passion for the game.""I think the West Indies have to make sure to look after him. Keep him injury-free for longevity. It's early days yet but I'm very excited to see what he does.""I know he hasn't played a lot of games here in India in the IPL but being here as well soaking up the atmosphere will do a lot,"" he added.","Courtney Walsh says he is not surprised at India's strategic move to include four spinners in their T20 World Cup squad.

Despite their efforts, the team's performance has not been up to the mark, resulting in a series of losses that have dashed their hopes for a spot in the play-offs.Their fate was sealed after Sunrisers Hyderabad registered a crushing 10-wicket win over Lucknow Super Giants in the IPL match in Hyderabad on Wednesday.Blazing fifties by Travis Head (89* off 30 balls) and Abhishek Sharma (75* off 28 balls) pummelled LSG bowlers for their stand for the opening wicket, and raced past the target of 166 in just 9.4 overs. Earlier, Ayush Badoni's unbeaten fifty carried LSG to 165 for four on a slow pitch.Mumbai Indians have endured a challenging season, suffering eight defeats in 12 games so far. Even if they secure victories in their remaining two fixtures, the maximum points they can accumulate is 12.However, SRH's victory propelled them to 14 points on the table. With Delhi Capitals and Lucknow Super Giants slated to face each other on May 14, one of these teams would also reach 14 points. Consequently, this scenario indicates that Mumbai Indians will not meet the cutoff to qualify for the playoffs.The five-time champions' exit from the play-off race is a significant event in this year's IPL, as it sets the tone for the remaining matches and the battle for the top 4 spots among the other teams.Mumbai Indians face an uphill battle as they prepare to take on Kolkata Knight Riders at the iconic Eden Gardens in their upcoming fixture.

NEW DELHI: Sunrisers Hyderabad 's bowlers began strongly but faltered as Ayush Badoni and Nicholas Pooran partnered effectively to guide Lucknow Super Giants to a competitive total of 165 for four on a slow pitch in an Indian Premier League match in Hyderabad on Wednesday.Choosing to bat first, LSG found themselves in trouble at 66 for 4 in 11.2 overs before Badoni (55 not out off 30 balls) and Pooran (48 not out off 26 balls) forged a vital, unbeaten 99-run partnership for the fifth wicket, scored off just 52 balls.LSG struggled to 27 for 2 by the end of the powerplay.The visitors suffered a setback when Quinton de Kock, who replaced an injured Mohsin Khan, failed to perform and was caught brilliantly by Nitish Kumar Reddy at deep backward square-leg off Bhuvneshwar Kumar (2/12) in the third over.Bhuvneshwar struck again in the fifth over, dismissing the dangerous Marcus Stoinis but the credit for the dismissal goes to young Sanvir Singh, who took a stunning diving catch just inches from the ground at mid-on.The pitch also didn't help LSG's cause as the ball was a bit slow and was stopping, as their batters found it difficult to find timing.While skipper KL Rahul (29) held one end up, Krunal Pandya (24) took it on himself to up the ante.Krunal pummelled Jaydev Unadkat for a six over long-on and then hit the bowler straight over his head for another maximum to accumulate 15 runs in the eighth over.Rahul hit the first boundary of LSG innings in the 10th over, slamming SRH skipper Pat Cummins over mid-off.But Rahul never looked at his usual best as he struggled to get his timing and finally departed in search of quick runs, caught by T Natarajan at deep backward square leg in the final delivery of the same over.SRH were brilliant on the field as Cummins' direct throw from mid-on sent Krunal packing soon when the batter went for a quick single single.Badoni pressed the feet on accelerator soon with three boundaries of left-arm pacer Natarajan's 14th over which yielded 17 runs.The Lucknow side finally got going as Pooran and Badoni struck a six and a four to accumulate 12 runs off the 15th over bowled by leg-spinner Vijayakanth Viyaskanth.They showed their intent from the word go and didn't hesitate to play their strokes when the opportunity was presented to them.It was brilliant batting from Badoni as he swept and cut Natarajan for two consecutive boundaries in the 17th over with the deck seemed to have got better.Badoni displayed some cheeky shots as the right-hander notched up his fifty in 28 balls.",Ayush Badoni and Nicholas Pooran guide Lucknow Super Giants to a competitive total of 165 for four on a slow pitch.

Kylian Mbappe: Kylian Mbappe's final match for Paris Saint-Germain ends in Champions League semi-final defeat to Borussia Dortmund,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/champions-league/top-stories/kylian-mbappes-final-match-for-paris-saint-germain-ends-in-champions-league-semi-final-defeat-to-borussia-dortmund/articleshow/109933341.cms,"NEW DELHI: Kylian Mbappe 's dream of bidding farewell to Paris Saint-Germain by leading them to their first-ever Champions League title has been shattered following their unexpected semi-final defeat to Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday. The 2018 World Cup winner, who is set to leave PSG when his contract expires at the end of the season, likely to join Real Madrid , had hoped to sign off by guiding the club to European glory at Wembley next month.Despite PSG's status as favourites and their 31 attempts on goal, they failed to overturn a one-goal first-leg deficit, with Mats Hummels scoring the only goal of the night to secure a 2-0 aggregate victory for Dortmund. Mbappe, one of four PSG players to hit the woodwork in the second half, admitted that they needed to be more clinical in front of goal.""I don't really like to talk about bad luck. When you are good, you don't hit the post, you score. I tried to help the best I could. When I say we needed to be more clinical, I am the one who has to be scoring. But this is life, we need to pick ourselves up,"" Mbappe said after the loss.The defeat marks the closest Mbappe has come to lifting the European Cup with his hometown team, for whom he is their all-time top scorer with 255 goals, including 42 in the Champions League. The French sports daily L'Equipe described the result as ""the end of his dream"" and gave a scathing assessment of Mbappe's performance, rating him just two out of 10.PSG's elimination by a team sitting fifth in the Bundesliga is seen as a significant disappointment for a club that has invested heavily since the Qatari takeover in 2011. It is the latest in a series of Champions League knockout round failures, with their 6-1 defeat by Barcelona in 2017 still the most notable.Despite the presence of Mbappe, this PSG side was not seriously expected to reach this stage of the competition, having undergone a major overhaul following the departures of Lionel Messi and Neymar. Coach Luis Enrique, brought in to oversee the new project, acknowledged that his objective was to compete as well as possible for every trophy. Mbappe's final game for the club will now be the French Cup final against Lyon on May 25.The lack of experience at this level may have ultimately cost PSG, with their starting line-up having an average age of just 24 years and 157 days, the youngest for any team in a Champions League semi-final since Arsenal faced Manchester United in 2009. Captain Marquinhos emphasized the need to focus on the positives, saying, ""We need to remember that it is a new project with a new coach, with lots of changes. There are lots of positives and good things to take forward into next season.""However, it remains to be seen how PSG can improve their chances of winning the Champions League without Mbappe, even with the likely significant investment in a replacement.The coach's strategy of resting Mbappe or substituting him in domestic league games over the past three months, apparently in preparation for next season, has not ultimately helped PSG secure the trophy they most desire. As Mbappe, now 25, prepares to leave Paris, he will hope to finally get his hands on the Champions League trophy with his next club.",Kylian Mbappe is set to leave Paris Saint-Germain at the end of the season. PSG lost 2-0 on aggregate to Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League semi-final.

Parthib Gogoi a step away from achieving his dream,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/parthib-gogoi-a-step-away-from-achieving-his-dream/articleshow/109926682.cms,"KOLKATA: “Every young footballer dreams of playing for India,” was how Parthib Gogoi — named for the first time by Igor Stimac among the probables for the crucial World Cup qualifiers — put it when asked about his national team aspirations.“Playing for India is always a different kind of feeling. All of us have a lot of passion for playing in national colours.There is this feeling that we will give our lives to win the game for India. So that’s the feeling I get and get connected emotionally when representing India.”While the 21-year-old has chosen to stay low before the final squad selection, the Assam footballer is one of the new faces that head coach Stimac chose to give a shot ahead of India’s vital June fixtures in quest to progress to the third round of World Cup qualifiers. He will join NEUFC teammate and fellow first-time India probable Jithin MS for the four-week camp in Bhubaneswar set to begin this week.And if NEUFC’s only player to score in four consecutive games for his club makes it into Stimac’s final squad, it will be a milestone in Gogoi’s journey from his father’s football training centre in Assam’s Sivasagar to donning the jersey for the senior national team.“My idol is Sunil Chhetri . And if I get to share the dressing room with him, I can learn so much from him. If young players get a chance in the Indian squad, we can learn so much from the senior players. But it depends on the coach. If he picks me, I will give my best,” Parthib said during a freewheeling interaction with TOI.Parthib, along with Jithin this season, has been a bright spot in the Highlanders’ last two Indian Super League campaigns and has been getting better with time and experience. He had eight shots on target, of which three were goals, in 18 appearances in 2022-23 and continued the form at Durand Cup this year with his first hat-trick for NEUFC.Having extended his NEUFC contract till 2026-27, Parthib scored five goals for his team this ISL season while also providing two assists. But what captivated fans are three spectacular strikes from long range – against title winners Mumbai City, Chennaiyin and East Bengal.Parthib expressed his love for such piledrivers during the interaction. “That’s something I really love to do. Even while playing FIFA on Playstation, I always look for opportunities to shoot from distance,” he said.Having started his football journey as a two-year-old by following his brother Pragyan – also his teammate and “mental support” at NEUFC – to the field, Parthib has had the support of his entire family in his pursuit.“My father and his colleagues started a football training centre in 2005 that trains kids even today. My brother used to go there for training from 2005. My father, who was not a footballer but loves the game, used to carry me to the ground when I was two to watch my brother play and if I liked it, I could play it too. So that's how my football journey started in 2007. Also, papa used to get football clips on his phone, like those of Messi or Ronaldo, for us and watching these clips, I got attracted to the game,” Parthib said before adding with a laugh, “I have broken many doors in my house.”Having climbed through the ranks of Assam age-group teams, Bengaluru’s Ozone Football Academy and Indian Arrows, Parthib has also represented India at age-group competitions, the most recent being U23 AFC Cup Qualifiers in China followed by friendlies in Indonesia.But the bigger test begins for him this week as he looks to grab a place in Stimac’s scheme of things and add a goalscoring touch to the squad against Kuwait and Qatar.Asked about his future goal, the Messi fan and self-proclaimed “Barcelona boy” said, “I want to become one of the best footballers in India.”The dream bodes well for India, too, with the team in dire need of goal scorers as Chhetri approaches his twilight days with the team.",Parthib Gogoi named among probables for India's World Cup qualifiers.

NEW DELHI: Michael Olise 's two goals propelled Crystal Palace to a resounding 4-0 triumph over Manchester United at Selhurst Park on Monday, marking the first time in their history that Palace have secured a league double over the Red Devils. The result will undoubtedly intensify the scrutiny on United manager Erik ten Hag .Palace's attack repeatedly exploited United's patchwork defence, which featured Casemiro playing out of position at centre-back.Jean-Philippe Mateta and Tyrick Mitchell also found the back of the net in the commanding victory.Despite the loss, United remain in eighth place with 54 points from 35 games, trailing sixth-placed Newcastle United by two points. Their chances of securing European football for the upcoming season are rapidly diminishing. Palace, on the other hand, sit in 14th place with 43 points from 36 matches.United's injury woes were compounded by the absence of Bruno Fernandes, who missed a match due to injury for the first time in his 230-game Old Trafford career. The ease with which they were defeated will be a significant concern for everyone associated with the club.This marks the first instance in the Premier League era that United have suffered 13 defeats in a single season, and the scoreline could have been even more lopsided.Under the guidance of new manager Oliver Glasner, Palace have found their rhythm, while United are stumbling towards the end of a season that cannot conclude soon enough for Ten Hag.","Crystal Palace defeated Manchester United 4-0 at Selhurst Park on Monday.

NEW DELHI: Chelsea significantly improved their prospects of participating in European competitions in the upcoming season by delivering a resounding 5-0 victory against West Ham in the Premier League on Sunday. The goals were scored by Cole Palmer , Conor Gallagher , Noni Madueke , and Nicolas Jackson , who netted twice.Palmer, aged 21, capitalized on a loose ball following a cross from Madueke in the 15th minute and precisely placed his shot into the far corner, beyond the reach of West Ham goalkeeper Alphonse Areola.It marked his 21st league goal in his maiden season with the London club.Gallagher, the team captain, also took advantage of a loose ball in the penalty area after a tackle on Madueke and emphatically converted his opportunity on the half-hour mark, exposing the disorganization in West Ham's defence.Madueke transitioned from assisting to scoring, and back again, on either side of the halftime break. He scored from close range in the 36th minute following a corner kick and then set up Jackson for Chelsea's fourth goal in the 48th minute.Jackson added his second goal of the match 10 minutes from the end, latching onto a long pass from Moises Caicedo and remaining onside, as confirmed by a VAR review.The outcome propelled Chelsea to seventh place in the league table, surpassing Manchester United , who have a match scheduled for Monday.
