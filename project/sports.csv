England rising star Shoaib Bashir 'still learning tricks of the trade',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/england-rising-star-shoaib-bashir-still-learning-tricks-of-the-trade/articleshow/111937006.cms,"NEW DELHI: Shoaib Bashir , the young off-spinner, acknowledges that he is still in the process of mastering his craft, despite his recent success in Test cricket .At just 20 years old, Bashir played a crucial role in England 's victory over the West Indies in the second Test at Trent Bridge, where he claimed 5-41 in the fourth innings, leading to a collapse of the visiting team's batting lineup.Bashir's rise to the international stage has been rapid, considering he had only played six first-class matches before his debut for England during their tour of India earlier this year. He made an immediate impact, taking two five-wicket hauls on spin-friendly pitches.However, Bashir faced challenges at the beginning of the English county season, finding himself behind the more experienced England spinner, Jack Leach , in the Somerset team. In an effort to gain more playing time, Bashir went on loan to Worcestershire .Despite these setbacks, England captain Ben Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum maintained their confidence in Bashir's abilities, and their faith was rewarded with his outstanding performance at Trent Bridge.As Bashir continues to develop his skills, he remains committed to ""learning the tricks of the trade"" and establishing himself as a key player in the England squad.""A lot has happened in the last few years,"" AFP quoted Bashir as saying. ""I can't get ahead of Leachy at Somerset, understandably, he's obviously played a lot more cricket than I have.""Jack was over the moon for me (getting selected for England). We had a chat and he just told me to enjoy it. He's a class spinner and I've learned a lot from him. There's always so much to learn. I'm only 20, I'm still learning the tricks of the trade.""There's a lot to work on, in cricket you never complete the game. Going on loan was a decision I had to make to play cricket at a high level, that's part of the journey.""He added: ""I didn't have too many expectations going into this game, I'm still trying to comprehend what's happened.""Bashir's performance in Test cricket has been remarkable, capturing 24 wickets at an impressive average of 29.83 across five matches. This stands in stark contrast to his domestic first-class record, where he has claimed a relatively modest 16 wickets at an average of 70.68 in 10 appearances.However, the England selectors are not solely focused on statistics when it comes to evaluating Bashir's potential. The team management has recognized several key attributes that make him well-suited for international cricket.Bashir's height and ability to get drift, in addition to bowling an attacking line are the qualities that have caught the attention of the selectors.""Bowling spin in England is pretty tough, but I'm grateful I'm a 6ft 4in (1.93 metres) spinner because it's a nice attribute to have,"" he said.""The extra bounce helps. We saw it here (at Trent Bridge), if you land the ball in the right areas, a few will bounce and a few will skid on. I've got experienced guys in the team that help me make judgments on the pitch, what lines to bowl and what places to bowl.""I'm just grateful to be in the position I am. I'm always going to stay grounded, stay humble, and I'm just trying to enjoy every moment I have in an England shirt.""",Shoaib Bashir made his international debut for England earlier this year. The 20-year-old has taken 24 wickets at an impressive average of 29.83 in five Test matches.

The loss resulted in Pakistan's unexpected exit from the 2007 World Cup .Younis' statement reflects the profound impact Woolmer had on Pakistan's cricket during his tenure as the head coach. The untimely demise of Woolmer left a void in Pakistan's cricketing landscape, and Younis' words suggest that his presence could have steered the team towards greater achievements.""I have no doubt that if Woolmer had remained head coach, Pakistan cricket would have been very different today, and he would have taken it to great heights,"" Younis said.Younis, a squad member in 2007, subtly conveyed his dissatisfaction with the insufficient backing the players received from their officials during the investigation that followed Woolmer's passing.

The investigation ultimately concluded that Woolmer's death was due to natural causes.According to Younis, Woolmer had been preparing him mentally to assume the role of Pakistan's captain across all formats following the World Cup.""After what all happened in the World Cup, I changed my mind and I became a reluctant captain and had no long-term tenure in mind.""Younis revealed that following Woolmer's passing, the team was relocated to a different island.

I am absolutely delighted to have won it,” Venkatesh, a FIFA Level 1 (top-tier) referee, told TOI.“A lot of emphasis is being laid on minimizing the human errors and that is what I have been trying to do. Whichever referee makes the least mistakes is considered the best. That is the concept not only in India but also the rest of the world,” Venkatesh added.Venkatesh dedicated his award to assistant referee (linesman) and his “friend” P Vairamuthu, with whom he began his career in 2009. Venkatesh and Vairamuthu worked in tandem in some of the biggest matches of the Indian football season – the Indian Super League (ISL) Shield-deciding contest, ISL final and Super Cup title decider.“This award also belongs to Vairamuthu. My personal effort is not the only reason for me to win this award. I feel really comfortable on the field when Vairamuthu is part of my team; there is a lot of trust and belief.

There is good communication between us; we also speak the same language (Tamil),” Venkatesh said.Venkatesh was the AIFF’s first-choice for key fixtures. “Last season was pretty special for me. I am delighted to have gotten the opportunities. That is what we work hard for. For a long time, I did not get to officiate a final. I am very happy that I was part of three of the most important matches of the season,” said Venkatesh, adding that officiating big matches involving the Kolkata giants were a “huge challenge”.While Mohun Bagan Super Giant played in both the ISL Shield-deciding game and ISL final, East Bengal FC fought for the top prize in the Super Cup title clash.“When the Kolkata clubs play, it is always difficult. There are a number of factors, including the quality of teams and enormous size of the fan bases. As officials, we have to understand the feeling around such matches. We have to prepare ourselves mentally, physically and psychologically.”",R Venkatesh wins AIFF 'Best Referee of the Year' award for the 2023-24 season.

Maharashtra government

to make amends & announce reward to boost shuttler's morale before Paris Games

MUMBAI: Badminton player Chirag Shetty 's comments regarding Maharashtra government ignoring his achievements while rewarding cricketers from the state for winning the T20 World Cup have stirred up a hornet's nest.Chirag along with Satwiksairaj Rankireddy - the No.3 ranked men's doubles team in the world - played a crucial role in India winning their maiden Thomas Cup in 2022. Chirag, though, wasn't recognised for his effort. After seeing the cricketers being feted, the aggrieved shuttler told TOI on Sunday that ""if the state government can honour World Cup-winning stars, they should also honour him and treat other sports equally"".Besides the Thomas Cup success, Chirag has also won doubles gold at Asian Games , Commonwealth Games and bronze at World Championships. The 27-year-old Malad resident has now found support from prominent sportspersons of the city, who urged the state government to resurrect the situation by rewarding Chirag. Uday Pawar , coach and mentor of Chirag, felt that his ward's achievement is on par with that of cricketers and he should have been rewarded for it.Former India hockey captain MM Somaya said that he had sympathy for Chirag as ""winning the Thomas Cup is a truly historic achievement"". He went on to add that the state government can make amends by announcing a reward for him just before the Paris Olympics begin which will be good ""for his morale as well"".Pawar, a former Asian Games medallist and a prominent badminton coach in the city, said: ""I am not comparing sports but like the cricketers who have brought honour to Maharashtra, so has Chirag. I feel his achievement is on par (with the cricketers). A person who has brought honour to the state shouldn't be demanding but the state should recognise his efforts on its own.""He added that players shouldn't ask for recognition and instead the state government should have a mechanism in place where once they have achieved something of national significance, they should be rewarded.""I think the state's sports ministry should be more active. They should do their own homework and should be aware of who the top players from Maharashtra are. If they don't know about his/her achievement, then the ministry is not functioning properly. They should have people who will keep in touch with the respective associations from state and take updates on how their players are performing,"" said Pawar.Somaya said: ""I would fully agree with Chirag and I would quite understand his position. Since he was the only player from Maharashtra, he deserves the recognition. Need not be such a huge amount that they have given to cricketers but in some manner, he should be rewarded. He is seeking recognition from the state government which I think is only natural and I think it will be fair even if the state govt does it now. He is one of the key players from Maharashtra to participate in the Olympics and has a good chance of winning a medal with Satwik.""He also urged the state government to have a ""consistent policy"" to reward the performers from other sports as well. ""They should reward the players as soon as they know that someone from the state has achieved something big. It should be a standard process. A person shouldn't be applying for it. You should make a person feel a sense of pride when a state government recognises a player on their own,"" felt Somaya.","Badminton player Chirag Shetty's comments regarding Maharashtra government ignoring his achievements have stirred up a hornet's nest.
