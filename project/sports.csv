Gautam Gambhir faces setback as BCCI rejects his recommendations for support staff: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/gautam-gambhir-faces-setback-as-bcci-rejects-his-recommendations-for-support-staff-report/articleshow/111674262.cms,"NEW DELHI: Before officially stepping into his role as India’s head coach , Gautam Gambhir encountered a minor setback. Reports indicate that Gambhir’s recommendation for Jonty Rhodes as the fielding coach has been turned down by the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ).Gambhir, who has recently been appointed as India’s head coach, had proposed the name of Jonty Rhodes, widely regarded as one of the best fielders to have ever played the game.Rhodes had previously worked with Gambhir at Lucknow Super Giants, where Gambhir was a mentor. However, the BCCI remains steadfast in its policy of maintaining an all-Indian support staff for the national team, a practice that has been in place for the past seven years.According to a report by the Hindustan Times, the BCCI is not inclined to hire foreign personnel for the support staff. This decision comes as India transitions to a new coaching regime following the completion of the tenures of previous head coach Rahul Dravid and his support staff, which included batting coach Vikram Rathour, bowling coach Paras Mhambrey, and fielding coach T Dilip, post the T20 World Cup.As per the same HT report, Gambhir’s proposal for R Vinay Kumar as the bowling coach was also reportedly not supported by the board.Additionally, there were earlier reports from Cricbuzz about Gambhir advocating for the inclusion of former Netherlands international Ryan ten Doeschate in his support staff. Ten Doeschate, who served as the fielding coach for Kolkata Knight Riders, is also involved with the franchise’s teams in the Caribbean Premier League and Major League Cricket.Despite these recommendations, the BCCI has made it clear that the final decision on the composition of the support staff rests solely with them. Gambhir’s setback indicates the board’s commitment to maintaining its current strategy and structure for the Indian cricket team’s support personnel.The cricketing community now awaits the BCCI's final decision on the support staff that will work alongside Gambhir as he embarks on his new journey as India’s head coach.",Gautam Gambhir's recommendation for Jonty Rhodes as fielding coach turned down.

India's new head coach Gautam Gambhir wants Ryan ten Doeschate in support staff: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/indias-new-head-coach-gautam-gambhir-wants-ryan-ten-doeschate-in-support-staff-report/articleshow/111651202.cms,"The BCCI has lately advocated for Indian coaches in the setup, but Team India's new head coach Gautam Gambhir has reportedly asked for a slight deviation in the form of including former Netherlands international Ryan ten Doeschate as part of his support staff, according to Cricbuzz.The final decision, however, rests with the Indian board.Doeschate has always been openly backed by Gambhir as a thorough professional committed to team's objectives.The Dutchman was also one of Gambhir's assistants during the former India opener's role as mentor of Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) during the team's triumph in the 2024 season of the Indian Premier League.Doeschate was KKR's fielding coach and is also part of the teams that the franchise owns in the Caribbean Premier League and Major League Cricket.According to the Cricbuzz report, the BCCI is already discussing ten Doeschate's name but the board wants T Dilip to continue in his role as the fielding coach. In that scenario, the Dutchman could be considered for a different role. Notably, another member of Gambhir's coaching staff in KKR, Abhishek Nayar, is being considered for the role of India's assistant coach.Nayar was the batting coach for KKR in IPL 2024.If Gambhir and BCCI manage to rope in both Nayar and Doeschate, it will leave a major void in KKR's coaching setup.Gambhir replaced Rahul Dravid as India's head coach last week. Dravid's tenure ended with the T20 World Cup, which India won last month to end an 11-year wait for another ICC trophy.","Gautam Gambhir has reportedly asked for Ryan ten Doeschate to be part of his support staff.

Ambati Rayudu set the stage with a quick-fire fifty, followed by crucial contributions from Yusuf Pathan , Gurkeerat Singh Mann , and the captain himself.Pakistan, opting to bat first, posted a total of 156 for 6. Indian bowlers, spearheaded by Anureet Singh's three-wicket haul, effectively restricted Pakistan's run flow. As a result, India's target appeared manageable, although they faced initial setbacks.Openers Robin Uthappa and Ambati Rayudu got India off to a promising start with a 34-run partnership. However, pacer Aamer Yamin swung the momentum back in Pakistan's favor by dismissing Uthappa and Suresh Raina in the same over, leaving India at 38/2.Rayudu then partnered with Gurkeerat Singh Mann, adding a 60-run stand for the third wicket, with Rayudu smashing a quick 50 off 30 balls. His innings featured two sixes and five boundaries. However, Pakistan's Saeed Ajmal provided a crucial breakthrough by dismissing Rayudu in the 12th over.Shoaib Malik then removed Gurkeerat, 34 off 33, to further dent India's chase in the next over.The Indian score stood at 108/4 when Yusuf Pathan and Yuvraj Singh joined forces. Pathan played an aggressive 30 off 16 balls, hitting three towering sixes, while Yuvraj held his ground with an unbeaten 15 from 22 deliveries. Their partnership of 42 runs in just 5.4 overs was pivotal.With Yusuf going for big shots, captain Yuvraj played an uncharacteristically slow knock.

Yuvraj and Irfan Pathan then ensured India reached the target, with Irfan hitting the winning boundary off Sohail Tanvir on the first ball of the final over.Earlier, Pakistan's innings was primarily held together by Shoaib Malik, who top-scored with 41 runs off 36 balls, including three sixes. Contributions also came from Sohail Tanvir, who added an unbeaten 19 off 9 deliveries.For India, besides Anureet Singh's standout performance with figures of 3 for 43, Irfan Pathan (1 for 12), Pawan Negi (1 for 24), and Vinay Kumar (1 for 36) provided essential support by taking key wickets.While Malik and Tanvir's efforts pushed Pakistan past the 150-mark, it wasn't sufficient to defend against a disciplined Indian side.

Irfan Pathans Hat-trick vs Pakistan

Irfan Pathan rolled back the years in Birmingham on Saturday when his famous late in-swinger went through the gate to castle Younis Khan during the final of the World Championship of Legends (WCL) between India and Pakistan, reminding of Irfan's famous hat-trick during the Karachi Test between the archrivals in 2006.Trying to play towards the on-side on a delivery that swung in late and just enough to go through the gap between the bat and pad, the Pakistan Champions skipper could only hear the sound of timber as Irfan's delivery ended up rattling the stumps behind him.Eighteen years earlier, when Irfan was in his prime, he claimed a famous hat-trick in third Test of the series in Karachi during India's tour of Pakistan. Coincidentally, Younis was the second wicket to fall in that hat-trick by Irfan, which is still the only instance of a hat-trick in the first over of a Test.The difference between the two dismissals was that Irfan generated more swing to dismiss Younis in 2006 and he was adjudged out lbw instead of getting clean bowled, which was the mode of dismissal on Saturday.Opner Salman Butt and Mohammad Yousuf were the other two batsmen that Pathan dismissed as part of his hat-trick in the Karachi Test.On Saturday in Birmingham, India Champions defeated Pakistan Champions in the final by five wickets to win the World Championship of Legends tournament that featured veteran players.Led by Yuvraj Singh, India successfully chased a target of 157 runs in 19.1 overs.

Rohit Sharma 's brutal attack against Australia 's bowling spearhead Mitchell Starc during the recently concluded T20 World Cup has become part of cricketing folklore, as it not just helped India beat the Aussies but also put them on the brink of an early exit from the tournament. For some, it was also revenge for the defeat in the ODI World Cup final last year.The loos against India hit Australia's chances hard as the 2021 champions failed to enter the semis, while India went on to win the trophy defeating South Africa in the final.India's win followed euphoric celebrations on the field in Barbados, in the dressing room and later upon their arrival home. The T20 world champions were invited by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, followed by an open bus parade at the Marine Drive in Mumbai that saw lakhs of fans coming onto the streets to join their heroes in celebration.While the win has started sinking in, the Rohit mania fails to cease as the India captain visited the US for a promotional event after a small family vacation in the UK, and was greeted by fans with shouts of ""Mitchell Starc, Mitchell Starc"".It was the fans' way of telling the skipper that they enjoyed him taking the Australian apart and will never forget the entertainment.The shouts drew Rohit's attention instantaneously. He replied, ""calm down, guys"" and followed it up with a cheeky smile while on the stage.India met Australia during the 'Super 8s' stage of the T20 World Cup in the Caribbean, and Rohit played probably the best innings of the tournament, scoring 92 runs off just 41 deliveries.Starc bore the maximum impact of Rohit's onslaught, conceding 29 runs in one over where he was smashed for four sixes and a four.Reflecting later on that during an episode of Willow Talk podcast, Starc had said: ""I have played a lot against him. He had a good tournament, especially at the back end. I think he targeted that wind in St Lucia as well. It was the one end that went for a lot more (runs) than the other.”""I think I had five bad balls and he hit them all for six.""","Rohit Sharma hit Mitchell Starc for four sixes and a four during T20 World Cup.

There are assumptions that ICC may have incurred losses in ticketing as well in the USA leg. The tournament looked mismanaged. The performance of the New York stadium wasn’t up to the mark,” an ICC source said.“The board will discuss how the organizing committee may have overshot the allocated budget. It was always going to be a herculean task to take mainstream cricket to USA.

Despite the team's efforts, they were unable to secure an IPL trophy during this period.Although the situation is still developing, there is a strong likelihood that Sourav Ganguly , who currently serves as the Team Director of DC, may take on the additional role of head coach in the upcoming season.“As you move on as our head coach, we are finding it incredibly difficult to put it down in words. The four things that you told us about in every huddle -- care, commitment, attitude and effort, they sum up our seven years together,” DC posted on their official 'X' handle.The franchise expressed their heartfelt sentiments in an emotional post, reflecting on their extensive partnership with the Australian. However, it has come to light that Ponting was unequivocally informed that his performance has failed to meet the expectations of the management, despite being granted an unprecedented seven-year tenure without delivering the desired results.Ponting, who led Australia to two World Cup victories, joined the franchise in 2019. Although the team reached its first-ever final in 2021, their performances in subsequent years have not lived up to the initial potential showcased during that promising run.“The top brass of Delhi Capitals has intimated Ricky that they aren't happy that the team didn't win a championship in seven years and they are trying to look at rejigging the support staff. He won't be continuing next year,” a source close to DC management told PTI on conditions of anonymity.The decision-makers want Ponting to be more involved in the auction process and team building, rather than just joining a couple of weeks before the start of the IPL.It remains uncertain whether DC will hire a new head coach or ask Ganguly to take on the head coach role.Praveen Amre , the diligent assistant coach, is set to continue.The DC co-owners, JSW and GMR group, are scheduled to meet either at the end of this month or early next month to discuss the future direction.Player retention is another issue up for discussion. If the retention limit remains at four, DC will have to release either Australia's Jake Fraser-McGurk or South Africa's Tristan Stubbs , as there is only one overseas slot available.Regarding the Indian core, retention choices are straightforward, with skipper Rishabh Pant , all-rounder Axar Patel, and wrist-spinner Kuldeep Yadav leading the list.A mega auction is anticipated ahead of the IPL 2025 , and there is a possibility that some retainable stars from each franchise might want to enter the auction pool to determine their true market value.","Delhi Capitals have ended their association with head coach Ricky Ponting.

And while the Knight Riders have played five matches, New York and the Unicorns have played three apiece.The match also saw a controversial moment in the first over of Washington's chase when Head was given not out while batting on six as a catch by Andre Russell off Spencer Johnson was ruled not clean after the third umpire took his time to look at various angles. Eventually he ruled it in Head's favour, believing that the ball had touched the ground.From thereon, Head stamped his authority on the game, though he survived another chance while batting on 32, when the ball burst through Spencer's hands at short third-man position.Head went on to complete his half-century in just 27 balls but fell soon after when paceman Shadley van Schalkwyk pegged the Australian's off-stump back.Rachin Ravindra (11) then added 29 runs with Smith, but the New Zealander fell to Spencer. Smith, however, ensured there were no more hiccups and took his team home.""I'm absolutely loving not having a bat, nice to give the body a bit of a break.

Southgate quickly dispelled this notion and instilled a different perspective in them.""We have tried to change the mindset from the start, tried to be more honest about where we were as a football nation,"" Southgate said.

This final will mark the end of a month-long football extravaganza, during which Spain, led by their teenage prodigy Lamine Yamal, have been the standout team.Spain have already knocked out several of Europe's top teams while maintaining a perfect record of six wins on their way to the final. They are aiming to secure a record fourth European championship title, having previously triumphed in 1964, 2008, and 2012.England, on the other hand, have faced challenges against weaker opponents but delivered their best performance in the semi-finals, defeating the Netherlands 2-1 with a crucial goal from substitute Ollie Watkins.This marks England's second straight appearance in the European Championship final, as they seek to erase the painful memory of their penalty shoot-out defeat to Italy at Wembley in the previous edition three years ago. If Gareth Southgate's men can secure victory, it will be England's first major men's title in 58 years, since their 1966 World Cup triumph on home soil.""We know that we have to do this one, we have to get this trophy to really feel the respect of the rest of the football world,"" Southgate told reporters on Saturday as he reflected on the number of near misses his team has had in recent years.England's national football team has consistently performed well in recent international tournaments, reaching the semi-finals of the 2018 World Cup and the final of Euro 2020. However, they suffered a disappointing exit in the quarter-finals of the 2022 World Cup, losing to France.Despite boasting a talented squad led by captain Harry Kane and rising star Jude Bellingham, England struggled in the group stage of the current tournament, managing just one victory against Serbia and scoring only two goals across their matches.In the last 16, England faced a tough challenge against Slovakia, requiring a last-gasp intervention from Bellingham to force extra time. They eventually progressed through the additional period before triumphing on penalties against Switzerland and narrowly defeating the Netherlands.As England prepares to face Spain, they will be confronting their most formidable opponent yet. The two nations have not met at a major tournament since Euro 96, when an England team that included current manager Gareth Southgate as a player emerged victorious on penalties in the quarter-finals.""The belief has grown as we've gone through the tournament,"" Kane said.""What we have been through with the late goals and the penalty shoot-outs builds resilience and builds belief. The team is obviously confident.""Under the guidance of coach Luis de la Fuente, Spain's thrilling new generation has propelled the country to their first men's major tournament final since their incredible victories at Euro 2008, the 2010 World Cup, and Euro 2012.The team has illuminated an otherwise lackluster tournament, thanks to the commanding presence of Rodri Hernandez in midfield and the electrifying performances of wingers Nico Williams and Yamal, who celebrated his 17th birthday on Saturday.Spain dominated their group stage, winning all their matches without conceding a single goal, including impressive victories over Croatia, the 2022 World Cup semi-finalists, and Italy, the current European champions.In the quarter-finals, they triumphed over hosts Germany in extra time in Stuttgart. Then, in the semi-finals, a breathtaking goal from Yamal helped them overcome a deficit to defeat Kylian Mbappe 's France.""Tomorrow is when I will ask the least of my team. They have been giving everything. Tomorrow is simply about enjoying it,"" insisted the 63-year-old De la Fuente.""We are two great sides, the best two teams. Of course it will be a very even game.""It really is just little details that decide matches like these. The team that makes the fewest mistakes has more chances of winning.""Dani Carvajal, the right-back, and Robin Le Normand, the central defender of French origin, are set to return to the Spanish lineup after serving their suspensions during the semi-final match.It is anticipated that England will maintain their starting eleven, with Kane spearheading the attack. Watkins, who made a decisive impact as a substitute against the Netherlands, is expected to begin the match on the bench once again.According to reports from UK media outlets, English supporters may constitute up to 50% of the spectators within the Olympiastadion, which has a capacity of 71,000, even though both teams in the final were allocated only 10,000 tickets each.","England face Spain in the Euro 2024 final in Berlin on Sunday.

However, Colombia is determined to thwart that ambition in a clash that sees the powerhouse confront the rising force in the championship match.The showdown will unfold on Sunday evening at Hard Rock Stadium, a venue that hosted two group stage encounters and is set to be the location for seven matches during the 2026 World Cup.In the lead-up to the game, both teams voiced apprehensions about security following an incident involving Uruguay's Darwin Núñez and several of his teammates. They entered the stands amidst a physical altercation between supporters at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, North Carolina, after Uruguay's semifinal victory against Colombia.Uruguay captain José Giménez stated that players went into the crowd to safeguard their families, while coach Marcelo Bielsa vehemently criticized tournament organizers for failing to adequately protect the families of players seated in the stands behind the Uruguay bench.“I’m concerned about what could happen tomorrow,” Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni said through an interpreter. Goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez added it “would be great if we could reinforce security.”CONMEBOL said in a news release that “any action that tarnishes a global football celebration will not be tolerated.”Argentina, the reigning champions of the Copa America in 2021 and the World Cup in 2022, has the opportunity to match Spain's achievement from 2008-12 by securing three major titles in a row.Despite Messi's leg injury, the Albiceleste reached the final without relying heavily on his dominant performances.The 37-year-old superstar, who has won the Ballon d'Or a record eight times, showcased his skills by weaving through defenders and creating chances for his teammates. However, his only goal came in the semifinal against Canada, where he deflected Enzo Fernández's shot past goalkeeper Maxime Crépeau, contributing to Argentina's 2-0 victory.Ahead of the final, Messi said he's battled discomfort at times throughout the tournament but assured it won't slow him down on Sunday.“In the final I’m going to feel better,” he said in an interview with DSports.Colombia is set to compete in its first Copa America final in 23 years, having extended its unbeaten run to a team-record 28 games, surpassing their previous best from 1992-94. This streak is currently the longest in men's international soccer.James Rodríguez has been Colombia's standout player and potentially the best in the entire tournament. With six assists to his name, he has set a new record for the most assists in a single Copa America since data tracking began in 2011, surpassing Messi's five assists in 2021.“James has had a great Copa America,” Colombia coach Néstor Lorenzo said through an interpreter. “We are lucky enough to have him at a very good level. The team has supported him. I can only hope that tomorrow his performance will be great.”Colombia's head coach, Lorenzo, commended the team's united effort in reaching the current stage of the tournament, which involved a hard-fought victory against 15-time champion Uruguay. He expressed gratitude towards the Colombian supporters, noting that their matches, alongside Argentina's, have drawn some of the largest crowds.However, Lorenzo emphasized that this level of performance should be the standard for the resurgent Colombian team, which secured its sole Copa America title on home soil in 2001, rather than an exceptional occurrence.“We’d love it if it wouldn’t be such a surprise to get to a final, so unexpected,” he said. “We’d like to be always on top. It’s not easy. ... Let’s hope this can last. Let’s hope we can keep on going.”The two teams previously met in the 2021 semifinal, where Argentina emerged victorious with a 3-2 win on penalties following a 1-1 draw in regular time. Colombia's last triumph over Argentina in the Copa America came during the group stage in 2019.“We are going to play our game,” Scaloni said. “You always have a plan, but the final is always a stressful game, and the one who is under the least stress will win.”",Argentina and Colombia will meet in the Copa America final on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: After an exciting tournament featuring 50 matches and the departure of 22 teams, England and three-time champions Spain are set to clash in the Euro 2024 final in Berlin on Sunday.The competition has showcased a promising new generation of footballers, such as teenagers Lamine Yamal, Arda Guler, and Kobbie Mainoo. However, several established players who were previously under the radar have also demonstrated their skills on the European stage.Here are five stars who have broken through with impressive performances at Euro 2024A 26-year-old midfielder for Spain, has been crucial to his team's success in the tournament. The 26-year-old is well-known in Germany after four years at RB Leipzig but has made everyone else stand up and take notice of his ability with a string of excellent performances in his adopted country. Despite starting only two of Spain's six games, Olmo has scored three goals, tied for the most in the tournament, and provided two assists.England's Marc Guehi, playing in his first major international tournament at the age of 23, has quickly become a key player in Gareth Southgate's defensive setup. Just 23, he has been calm and assured alongside John Stones in central defence, with England conceding just three goals in five games with Guehi on the park. Guehi's importance to the team was highlighted when he was suspended for the quarter-final against Switzerland, and he also contributed to the attack with an assist for Jude Bellingham's last-gasp equaliser against Slovakia in the last 16.A forward for the Netherlands, has been instrumental in his team's run to their first Euros semi-final in 20 years. The orange shirt seems to bring the best out of the 25-year-old, whose impressive performances at the Qatar World Cup came before a big-money transfer to English giants Liverpool. Gakpo scored crucial goals against Poland and Romania and forced a late own goal against Turkey in the quarter-finals.Georgia's goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili has been a standout player for his country in their first-ever Euros appearance. Standing at nearly two meters tall, Mamardashvili made 30 saves in four matches, the second-most in Euros history. His performances have not surprised La Liga fans, as he has been among the best goalkeepers in Spain this season.Finally, Austria's Marcel Sabitzer has continued his stellar form from Borussia Dortmund's Champions League run at Euro 2024. The 30-year-old midfielder scored the winner against the Netherlands to secure top spot in their group and has been a constant goal threat, particularly from long range. His boundless energy has been key for Austria's high-intensity playing style under Ralf Rangnick.","England and Spain will meet in the Euro 2024 final in Berlin on Sunday.

""It's always nice to be around her in the locker room. I told her that I'm sorry because I knew that she wanted to win too. These moments, at the end of a match, are not pleasant, when you have someone at the other end who you like.

It was just very, very emotional to see me on a board right next to her,"" Krejcikova said of the Wimbledon honours board. ""I think she would be proud, she would be really excited that I'm on a same board as she is because Wimbledon was super special for her.""Krejcikova, who worked with Novotna for almost four years, until she passed away, said she still has dreams of her mentor.""I'm dreaming about her a lot and we are talking in these dreams,"" she said.As a child, Krejcikova had a little notebook in which she penned her tennis goals. When she was 12, she wrote that she would like to win the French Open one day.""It was quite a big dream for me to win the French Open,"" she said, ""Maybe like three-four months ago, I was looking through that notebook and I found it there.""""Things shifted a little bit when I met Jana, when she told me all the stories about Wimbledon, about the grass, how difficult it was for her to win the title and how emotional she was when she actually made it,"" she said.
