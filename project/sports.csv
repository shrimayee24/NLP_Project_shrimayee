Sam Konstas horoscope: 'He will be like Rishabh Pant and Yuvraj Singh'

NEW DELHI: Legendary Sachin Tendulkar shared an anecdote from the final international match of his career against the West Indies, held at the iconic Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai.Sachin was speaking at an event commemorating 50 years of the Wankhede Stadium, where he experienced two of his most cherished career moments: winning the 2011 Cricket World Cup—his first title after a wait of over two decades—and playing his 200th and final Test match against the West Indies.During the event, Sachin recounted how he had requested the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to schedule his last match in Mumbai so his mother could watch him play live for the first time.""Before the series of my last match was announced - I got in touch with BCCI and made one request that I want my last match to be held in Mumbai for one very reason - I played cricket for so many years - around 30 years - 24 years for India, my mother had never seen me play. At that time (during retirement) my mother's health was not good enough that she could travel anywhere other than Wankhede to watch me play. I wanted her to see why I have been moving to different places for 24 years. BCCI very graciously accepted that request,"" said Sachin.Reflecting on his emotions during the match, Sachin said he was overwhelmed, knowing it was the last time he was playing for India. While he was at the crease, close-ups of his family, including his mother, were displayed on the big screen, which stirred deep emotions. He humorously remarked that those handling the big screen seemed to have a West Indies passport.""Last match it was surreal, emotional, I knew it was happening for the last time. I fought through emotions as I came to bat. WI players and spectators gave me so much respect. Just before the last over, in close-ups, my mother, wife and my family were shown. I thought that the ones handling the screen must have had a West Indies passport, since he worked in favour of WI by playing with my emotions as I looked to survive. Once the match was over, the final lap and when I was lifted on shoulders, it was surreal. These are not planned, but written by the god above. This experience is going to be with me till my last breath,"" he added.In his final Test, Sachin scored 74 in his only innings.Sachin also reflected on another iconic moment at Wankhede—India's victory in the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup.""When I saw the World Cup win in 1983, I had that same motivation. That I should have a trophy in my hand too. It was the best moment of my life, there is nothing better than this,"" he said.In the World Cup final, Sri Lanka batted first and posted 274/6, thanks to Mahela Jayawardene's unbeaten 113 and contributions from Kumar Sangakkara (48), Tillakaratne Dilshan (48), and Thisara Perera (22*). Zaheer Khan (2/60) and Yuvraj Singh (2/49) were the standout bowlers for India.India's chase got off to a shaky start with the early dismissals of Virender Sehwag and Tendulkar. However, crucial knocks from Gautam Gambhir (97), Virat Kohli (35), MS Dhoni (91*), and Yuvraj Singh (21*) guided India to a six-wicket win.Sachin was India's highest run-getter in the tournament, amassing 482 runs in nine matches at an average of 53.55 and a strike rate of over 91. His tally included two centuries and two fifties, with a top score of 120.","Sachin Tendulkar spoke at an event commemorating 50 years of the Wankhede Stadium.

NEW DELHI: The appointment of Shubman Gill as vice-captain for India’s 2025 ICC Champions Trophy campaign has ignited widespread discussions.However, former Indian cricketer Suresh Raina , speaking on Star Sports Press Room, heaped praise on the 25-year-old and backed his credibility as a leader.“Shubman Gill is the next superstar in India. He’s done remarkably well in the one-day side. When you give such a good opportunity to a youngster, like making him the vice-captain in the ICC Champions Trophy, it speaks volumes about his potential. Rohit Sharma clearly knows who the next leader will be,” Raina said.“Shubman Gill is one of the best captains we’ve seen, especially with how he led the Gujarat team in the IPL. The way he has performed in the last 12-16 months justifies this decision. That’s why Rohit will open with him—it’s a great move by the selectors and Rohit Sharma himself.”Raina drew parallels between Gill’s leadership style and that of Virat Kohli. “Rohit has observed how Gill leads, much like how Virat Kohli did. Gill’s on-field work ethic is exceptional. He knows the team, leads from the front, and has a strong awareness of the game. It’s a very good move by the selectors and Rohit,” he added.Gill’s credentials speak for themselves. With 2,328 ODI runs at an impressive average of 58.20 across 47 innings, he’s already a mainstay in India’s top order.His leadership during the IPL, especially as captain of the Gujarat Titans, further highlights his capability to guide a team.Chief selector Ajit Agarkar offered insight into the key decision, revealing that dressing room feedback played a key role in Gill’s appointment.Also See: 2025 Champions Trophy “You always want to be on the lookout for leaders.

Chiefs lose key leader Mike Borgonzi before playoff run

Travis Kelce’s message to Veach’s coach and players



As the Chiefs gear up for their playoff push, they face a critical challenge both on and off the field. Brett Veach ’s squad, fresh off securing the AFC’s top seed in their quest for a historic 3-peat, is now without a key figure who played a pivotal role in their rise. While the players get ready for their divisional round matchup with the Texans, the loss of Mike Borgonzi , a cornerstone of the team’s front office, leaves a significant void.Brett Veach’s Chiefs are primed for their playoff run, securing the AFC’s top seed in their 3-peat campaign. However, just ahead of a crucial divisional round clash with the Texans, they've lost a vital member from their inner circle. Thankfully, it’s not a player on the field, but someone whose behind-the-scenes contributions helped spark the team’s championship revival.Since 2013, Veach and head coach Andy Reid have led the Chiefs through a rebuild that culminated in breaking their 50-year Super Bowl drought in 2019. With stars like Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce , they’ve dominated the league, securing four AFC titles and three Super Bowls over the past five seasons.Key to that success was Mike Borgonzi, a driving force in shaping the Chiefs’ roster. Now the Titans' new GM, Borgonzi’s departure leaves a hole in the Chiefs' front office. Veach praised his longtime colleague, calling him “one of the hardest-working guys in the business.” Borgonzi’s impact over his 16 years with the Chiefs rising from college scouting administrator to assistant GM has been pivotal in the team’s dominance.As the Chiefs prepare for their postseason showdown with the Texans, they’ll continue their pursuit of a 3-peat in honor of Borgonzi’s legacy. The impact of one key draft pick he helped shape could prove crucial to their playoff success.Also Read: Travis Kelce warns of Texans’ tough defense as DeMeco Ryans prepares Chiefs’ challenge with key update Travis Kelce, selected 63rd overall in the 2013 NFL Draft, has already secured 3 Super Bowls and 4 All-Pro selections. Despite his achievements, he's still driven. Reflecting on the importance of the post-season, he said, “Playoff football is the most meaningful football that you’ll ever play in your life. I cherish every single play. I really do. When you’re in it, you’re always trying to strive for greatness. You know, obviously, there’s a historic run and something that we can achieve that no other team has ever achieved. The biggest thing is being able to control the emotions of the game. It’s your dream. It’s everybody’s goals and aspirations that you’re playing for at this point.” (via: EssentiallySports)With rumors circulating about his potential retirement, Kelce’s words are a rallying cry for his team. He’s backing them up with historic performances, setting records for most receptions and fastest to 12,000 yards. Can he help the Chiefs make NFL history with a 3-peat?Meanwhile, the Titans hold the No. 1 pick in the 2025 draft, hoping to find another Kelce.","Chiefs lose key leader Mike Borgonzi before playoff run.

NEW DELHI: Indian cricket stalwarts, including Sunil Gavaskar, Ravi Shastri, Gautam Gambhir—currently serving as head coach—and former BCCI secretary and ICC Chairman Jay Shah, have emphasized the importance of current players participating in the Ranji Trophy . Gambhir, in particular, has urged struggling players like Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli to use red-ball cricket to regain form after India’s series loss in Australia.Rohit’s decision to train with the Mumbai Ranji team has drawn widespread attention. Addressing the media while announcing India’s squad for the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 on Saturday, Rohit confirmed his participation in Mumbai's upcoming Ranji Trophy match against Jammu and Kashmir at the MCA-BKC ground starting January 23.When asked about this during the press conference for the Champions Trophy and England ODI series squad announcement, Rohit responded, ""Yes, I will.""However, Rohit also highlighted the challenges posed by a packed international calendar, which often prevents players from participating in domestic cricket regularly.Rohit’s last Ranji Trophy appearance was in November 2015. However, his recent struggles in Test cricket during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series in Australia have raised questions about his place in the red-ball format.""If you go back and watch our calendar, there hasn't been a time where we were sitting at home for 45 days and there is cricket going on. You do get that time when you finish IPL, and if there's nothing happening right after that.""But if you see our domestic season, it starts in October, maybe September. And it gets over by March, February-March. And that is the time India plays a lot of cricket as well,"" Rohit explained.""So, guys who are not playing certain formats and have time, and then there is domestic cricket happening, then they will play. But the last 6-7 years, I can at least tell about what has happened with me since I have started playing Test cricket regularly, which is from 2019. You hardly have any time.""And then when you play so much international cricket through the year, you need some time off as well as a cricketer just to refresh, get your mind right, just to be ready for the upcoming season,"" he added.Chief selector Ajit Agarkar echoed the sentiment, emphasizing the importance of playing domestic cricket whenever possible, though he acknowledged the challenges for players involved in all formats.""I don't think it's a diktat. I think everyone should, when available. Sometimes, to be fair to a lot of the players, it's difficult if you're playing all three formats. You don't get as much time, but there's no doubt. You'll probably find most guys playing this round of the Ranji Trophy. There's been a little bit of time,"" Agarkar said.""And those who are available and fit, obviously, you expect people to play,"" he added.Meanwhile, Rishabh Pant has been included in Delhi’s squad for their upcoming Ranji Trophy matches, while Virat Kohli’s name is absent from the 21-member squad announced by the DDCA on Saturday.Kohli opted out of Delhi's fixture against Saurashtra in Rajkot due to a neck niggle sustained during the Sydney Test against Australia.

NFL Fans Slam Patrick Mahomes for Flop in Chiefs’ Win Over Texans



The Kansas City Chiefs , led by Patrick Mahomes , secured their seventh consecutive trip to the AFC Championship Game with a 23-14 victory over the Houston Texans on Saturday. While the win reinforced their dominance in the playoffs, it also stirred significant controversy over officiating, casting a shadow over the game. The Chiefs will now host the winner of Sunday night's matchup between the Baltimore Ravens and Buffalo Bills at Arrowhead Stadium.The game was not without its contentious moments, as Mahomes benefited from multiple roughing-the-passer calls that left fans and analysts divided. Early in the first quarter, the Chiefs quarterback was awarded a 15-yard penalty following a questionable call involving Texans defensive end Will Anderson Jr. A similar scenario happened in the third quarter when another roughing call went in Mahomes’ favor, raising eyebrows among viewers and prompting heated discussions on social media.Perhaps the most debated moment occurred in the fourth quarter when Mahomes, while running along the sideline, appeared to take a dive after being pushed. Though the officials refrained from penalizing the Texans this time, the incident added fuel to calls for the NFL to introduce penalties for ""flopping"" to discourage players from embellishing contact.“Bad roughing calls happen. But this lasting image right here is unbecoming of the guy who is supposed to be the face of the sport,” wrote analyst Brett Kollmann in a post on X. “The league has to make flopping a foul or guys will just keep doing it. It’s not fair to defenders that QBs can have their cake and eat it too.”Referee Clay Martin defended the controversial decisions during the postgame press conference. Addressing the call against Anderson, Martin cited ""forcible contact to the face mask area"" as justification for the penalty. Similarly, Martin explained the roughing call against Texans linebacker Henry To'oTo'o, stating, ""When [Mahomes] slides, he is considered defenseless. The onus is on the defender. I had forcible contact there to the hairline, to the helmet.""Despite the explanations, many questioned the legitimacy of the calls, arguing they unfairly tilted the game in favor of Kansas City.Also Read: ""Disgraceful"": Fox Faces Intense Criticism After Cutting National Anthem Broadcast Before Commanders-Lions Game Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid shared his thoughts on Mahomes' moments:""Yeah, I always tell our coaches, 'Don't get use to that.' This is unreal (and) I tell the fans the same thing. We are very lucky to have him (Patrick Mahomes) here."" said Reid. ""The stuff he's doing just doesn't happen, and that's why he's the greatest at doing what he's done in a relatively young career here. I thought Offensive Coordinator Matt) Nagy did a nice job at putting the guys in position to have some real nice plays, too.""Texans players and staff did not hold back their frustration. Will Anderson Jr., who had been at the center of one of the controversial calls, remarked, “We knew it was going to be us against the refs going into this game.” Head coach DeMeco Ryans echoed Anderson’s sentiments, stating, “We knew going into this game, it was us versus everybody… the naysayers, the doubt, everybody we had to go up against today.”Despite the loss, the Texans have much to reflect on after finishing the season atop the AFC South with a 10-7 record. However, their back-to-back exits in the divisional round highlight the challenges they face in taking the next step.","The Kansas City Chiefs secured their seventh consecutive trip to the AFC Championship Game with a 23-14 victory over the Houston Texans on Saturday.

Their recent slide has highlighted issues in paint protection, with the team relying heavily on Draymond Green and sophomore Trayce Jackson-Davis to anchor the defense. Over their last five games, the Golden State Warriors have a middling 115.2 defensive rating, ranking 15th in the league. To even enter the conversation as playoff contenders, they will need to tighten their defense considerably.Reports from The Athletic suggest that the Dallas Mavericks are open to trading Daniel Gafford, a 6-foot-10 center known for his athleticism and defensive prowess.wrote The Athletic’s Christian Clark.Daniel Gafford, 26, has been a bright spot for the Dallas Mavericks this season, averaging 11.7 points, 6.0 rebounds, and 1.5 blocks per game while shooting an impressive 70.5% from the floor. Known for his rim-running ability, explosive dunks, and shot-blocking skills, he has earned a reputation as one of the league’s most intimidating defenders.A potential trade could see Golden State offering assets to secure Daniel Gafford’s services. Gary Payton II, who has established himself as one of the NBA's most versatile defenders, may be one of the crucial components in such a transaction. Payton II is still a great asset for any team looking to enhance their defence because of his versatility as a guard.Clark added. This aligns with Dallas’s apparent focus on shoring up their defense on the perimeter.Another potential trade piece for Golden State could be Brandin Podziemski, an All-Rookie First Team selection who led the league in charges drawn last season. Including Podziemski in a package alongside Payton II might be enough to entice the Mavericks to part with Gafford.If Golden State can secure Daniel Gafford, he could provide immediate benefits as a pick-and-roll partner for Stephen Curry and a defensive anchor alongside Green. His addition would not only bolster the Golden State Warriors’ defense but also give them a reliable option for rim protection—something they have sorely missed this season.Also read: NBA Trade News: Milwaukee Bucks set to acquire Nets' $94 million star forward in trade involving Bobby Portis among other key pieces The NBA trade is inching closer and the Golden State Warriors’ front office will need to act decisively to turn their season around. With the playoffs slipping further out of reach, acquiring a player like Gafford could be the spark they need to climb back into contention.","The Golden State Warriors are reportedly eyeing Dallas Mavericks center Daniel Gafford in a trade to address their recent defensive struggles. With a 20-20 record, they seek to improve their paint protection. Potential trade assets include Gary Payton II and Brandin Podziemski.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117362453,imgsize-71068,width-400,resizemode-4/117362453.jpg"

Champions Trophy Squad: Chief selector Ajit Agarkar and skipper Rohit Sharma PC

NEW DELHI: During a press conference in Mumbai on Saturday, India captain Rohit Sharma and men's selection committee chairman Ajit Agarkar announced the 15-member squad for the upcoming Champions Trophy . Prior to the start of the conference, cameras captured a private conversation between Rohit and Agarkar, which later went viral on social media.In the footage, Rohit can be heard discussing new guidelines with Agarkar, mentioning an upcoming meeting with the BCCI secretary.The conversation also highlighted players' concerns about the guidelines.[Now I will have to sit with the secretary to discuss family, family matters, everyone is telling me],"" Rohit was recorded saying to Agarkar in the viral video.A 10-point guideline was recently released following India's series defeat to Australia earlier this month.One of the key points of contention in the policy document is a return to the old system, where families are allowed to join players only for 14 days on long tours. Any deviation from this would require approval from coach Gambhir.When Rohit was asked about the new guidelines, he responded, ""Who told you about these rules? Has it come from the official handle of the BCCI? Let it come officially."" However, Agarkar confirmed that an SOP had indeed been drafted.Agarkar was asked why, just six months after winning the T20 World Cup with the same set of players, the BCCI felt the need to introduce a travel policy document. Agarkar, who was also part of the review committee that discussed the Australia debacle, said, ""We'll probably talk about it endlessly if we keep going on.""He continued, ""I suppose every team has some rules in place. We've spoken about various things you see over the last few months where you can improve as a team, where you can get a bit closer as a team. It's not a school. It's not a punishment,"" he explained, attempting to rationalize the decision.""It's just (that) you have some rules in place and when you're playing for the national team, you just follow those rules. Again, these are mature individuals. They are superstars in their own rights in international sport.""Many former players have described these rules as long-standing, with Agarkar calling them protocols that must be followed when representing the national team.","A 10-point guideline was recently released following India's series defeat to Australia earlier this month.

Champions Trophy Squad: Chief selector Ajit Agarkar and skipper Rohit Sharma PC

NEW DELHI: BCCI chief selector Ajit Agarkar and captain Rohit Sharma addressed the media in Mumbai on Saturday to announce India’s squad for the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 . Among the key talking points was the omission of wicketkeeper-batter Sanju Samson from the team.Samson last represented India in the T20I series against South Africa in November last year, where he delivered two remarkable centuries. His exceptional form had sparked calls for his inclusion alongside KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant as a wicketkeeping option.However, Samson's absence from the Vijay Hazare Trophy , India’s premier 50-over domestic tournament, may have played a role in his exclusion from the Champions Trophy squad.Kerala Cricket Association (KCA) president Jayesh George criticised Samson for his approach, revealing that the batter had informed the association of his unavailability with just a 'one-line text'.Speaking about Samson’s absence, George said, “I am not sure if Samson missing the tournament was the reason he was excluded. The reason he was not added in the Vijay Hazare squad was because he sent a one-line text saying he would not be available for the 30-member preparatory camp. We were all of the impression that he would be leading the team since he is our white-ball captain and had led in the SMAT season as well.”“So we went ahead and announced the squad and later he sent a message stating he is available for selection. Be it Sanju Samson or any other player, KCA has a policy in place that needs to be respected. We all know that Sanju does not need a camp to come into the squad, but is the Kerala team one that he can come and represent only when he feels like? How did Samson reach the Indian team? It was only through the KCA. That doesn’t mean you turn up only when you feel like for the Kerala team,” George told MediaOne.Meanwhile, Samson has been named in the squad for the upcoming five-match T20I series against England, starting February 22. He is one of two wicketkeepers in the squad, alongside Dhruv Jurel.The series opener is scheduled for Wednesday at Eden Gardens in Kolkata.The second T20I will take place on January 25 at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai, followed by the third on January 28 at Niranjan Shah Stadium in Rajkot.The fourth game will be held on January 31 at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium in Pune, with the fifth and final T20I slated for February 2 at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai.","Sanju Samson omitted from India's squad for ICC Champions Trophy 2025.

""I don’t think it exists in team sports.""

""When you ask who’s better, LeBron or Michael, you can’t ask me who’s the GOAT between LeBron and Michael. Neither one of them are GOATs; they both won differently, you can’t put them at the pinnacle,""

“And there’s no comparison to [LeBron],”

“None. So does that make him the greatest player to ever play the game? I’ll leave that up for debate because I don’t believe there’s a great player because our game’s a team game, and one player can’t do it.”

“There has been no one in the sport like 'Dr. J' ever since. Sorry, MJ (Michael Jordan). Sorry, Magic (Johnson). Sorry, LeBron (James).”

""Magic Johnson is closer to the Greatest of All Time than any other player,""

Scottie Pippen , a six-time NBA champion and Hall of Famer, has once again taken center stage in the basketball world with his views on the ever-popular ""Greatest of All Time"" (GOAT) debate. This time, Pippen made it clear that he doesn’t believe there is such a thing as a GOAT in team sports like basketball, a statement that challenges the ongoing conversations surrounding NBA legends such as Michael Jordan and LeBron James In a recent appearance on the ""PBD Podcast,"" Scottie Pippen asserted,He went on to explain why he feels the GOAT title is irrelevant in basketball, stressing that individual accomplishments cannot define greatness in a team-oriented game.Pippen said.For Scottie Pippen, the notion of greatness in basketball is rooted in teamwork, not individual feats. While both Michael Jordan and LeBron James are widely considered among the greatest to ever play, Pippen believes that no single player can fully capture the essence of a sport that relies so heavily on collaboration and support.Pippen continued.Scottie Pippen's comments come as part of his long-standing stance on the GOAT conversation, which he has addressed multiple times over the years. His perspective has evolved, with the basketball icon giving different answers when asked who holds the title of the GOAT. In 2023, during an appearance on the ""Gimme The Hot Sauce"" podcast, Pippen suggested that Julius Erving, also known as Dr. J, might deserve the GOAT title more than anyone. In his book ""Unguarded,"" Pippen further expressed his admiration for Erving, stating,Pippen's argument for Erving is rooted in his belief that Dr. J's influence on the game was unparalleled. However, while Erving holds a special place in Pippen's heart, the overall message is clear: Pippen believes the focus should shift from individual accolades to the collective achievements of teams. He has also made it clear that he doesn't believe there is any player who transcends the team aspect of the game to deserve the title of the GOAT.Another player who Scottie Pippen believes has a stronger claim to being the GOAT is Magic Johnson, particularly due to his leadership and the way he revolutionized the game during his career.Pippen stated, pointing to Johnson’s ability to lead his team to success, notably during his rookie year when he filled in as the starting center for the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA Finals when Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was injured.Also read: Today in LA Lakers History (Jan. 18): Jerry West's iconic buzzer-beater at the 1972 NBA All-Star Game In the end, Scottie Pippen’s stance on the GOAT debate serves as a reminder of the importance of teamwork in basketball and raises questions about how greatness should truly be measured in team sports.","Scottie Pippen believes there is no such thing as a ""Greatest of All Time"" in team sports like basketball.

Tom Brady Shares Thoughts on Raiders’ Coaching Hunt Amid Lions-Commanders Game Coverage



The Las Vegas Raiders ’ search for a new head coach has been leading the NFL world news, especially after the franchise parted ways with Antonio Pierce following a dismal 4-13 season. As the Raiders prepare to hire their fourth head coach in the last seven years, excluding interim mid-season appointments, the stakes are high for the team to find someone who can lead them out of this turbulent period.Among the frontrunners for the position is Detroit Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson , who is reportedly the favorite. According to sources, Las Vegas is “enamored” with Johnson’s coaching abilities, and his strong track record has placed him at the top of their list. However, it’s not just the Raiders’ executives who are pushing for Johnson. Minority owner Tom Brady is believed to have played a significant role in the franchise's pursuit of the Lions’ coach, adding an interesting twist to the situation.Brady, a seven-time Super Bowl champion and now a broadcaster for Fox Sports, has become a key figure in the Raiders' leadership structure. With his vast football experience, it's clear why controlling owner Mark Davis wants Brady to have a significant say in the team’s direction moving forward. However, Brady’s involvement in the head coaching search has raised eyebrows, particularly due to potential conflicts of interest.Brady addressed the growing scrutiny surrounding his role when asked about it during the broadcast of the Lions vs. Commanders divisional-round game. FOX announcer Kevin Burkhardt asked Brady about the ongoing head coaching search, and Brady gave a diplomatic response, stating, “It’s been a great learning experience. The league is filled with great potential. The resumes and accolades are all earned by what people do on the field. You earn your opportunities and let your performance do the talking.” While Brady's answer was professional, it left many wondering how much influence he truly has in this critical decision.Despite his insightful answer, the 47-year-old's involvement in the Raiders’ search has sparked controversy. Over the past few weeks, the backlash over Brady's close involvement with the potential replacements for Pierce has only grown. During the game, Brady was also asked about what Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson and defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn showed in their interviews for the Raiders' head coach position. Brady responded, describing it as a “great experience,” but provided little insight into the specifics of the interviews.Also Read: Should Patrick Mahomes Face NFL Punishment After Controversial Flop Against Texans?

Irwansyah, known for his success with Indonesian stars Jonatan Christie and Anthony Ginting, has been tasked with revitalizing Sindhu’s game.It has been a tough two years for Sindhu. After winning the 2022 Commonwealth Games title, she experienced a lull and didn’t win any tournament till her Syed Modi Super 300 crown in December last year.“Every player has been through something like this. What I’ve learned, I want to pass on to her. I’ll try my best. I believe she can still do it. She can come back and reach an even higher level than before. I do believe in it. That’s the reason I’m here,” Irwansyah said.“I want to help her enjoy herself more on the court. It’s important that she enjoys it because when she enjoys it, she’ll become more confident. That’s the main focus right now – working hard to get her to believe in herself again. After everything, the last two years have been tough -- injuries, maybe... It’s really about confidence. I’m doing my best to help her believe in what she has. She has a lot of potential,” the coach added.Irwansyah’s approach focuses on enhancing Sindhu’s natural aggressive playing style. “My plan is to make her a more attacking player. She has all the right qualities, so I just want to build on that and push her further. I want to change her game to be more aggressive -- more speed and power,” Irwansyah said.As Sindhu begins this new journey, she expresses a renewed sense of purpose and determination. “The bonding is important between coach and athlete. I’ve heard a lot about him, and I thought he is the right coach for me. The way he approaches opponents, I think it’s really good,” Sindhu said.At the India Open , Sindhu lost in the quarterfinals to Indonesia’s Gregoria Mariska Tungjung. Despite the loss, Sindhu gave a good account of herself, giving glimpses of her old self.“I need to maintain my speed. I need to have my power. The women’s singles game is evolving, and after playing for so many years, I think opponents definitely know my game by now. So, it’s crucial to strategize, having both Plan A and Plan B,” said Sindhu. “I still feel there’s so much more to achieve. I have that fire in me, and I know I can do it.

He referenced Swift's hit song 22.Travis Kelce, a star Chiefs tight end, subtly referenced his girlfriend Taylor Swift in a locker room interview after a 23-14 divisional round win over the Texans, talking about feeling ""25 again"" after a monster performance. “22, baby. 22,” Kelce answered.Kelce recorded seven catches for 117 yards and a touchdown, breaking the record of Hall of Famer Jerry Rice, and becoming the only player in NFL history to log nine 100-yard games in the postseason.“Man, there’s nothing better than playoff football, especially up here at Arrowhead,” Kelce said. “The crowd is always electric, but the feeling that you get from playing in these games with the guys that you work all year with, it’s the most gratifying feeling when you come out on top, man. I’m gonna cherish every single one of these things.”Both Kelce and quarterback Patrick Mahomes have now connected for 18 postseason touchdowns, more than any NFL duo in history. ""That’s just ‘Playoff Trav,’” Mahomes said. “He’s a leader, man. This is what he lives for, is playing in these moments, having the chance to make big-time plays, and he goes out there and does that. It seems like he does that every single playoff game.”“He had a huge game,” rookie wide receiver Xavier Worthy said. “Obviously he’s one of the leaders on the team, a guy to pick up the offense when it’s down.” “He can still play,” head coach Andy Reid said with a smile after the win. “He’s alright.”“I’m focused on the next task at hand,” Kelce said. “You don’t get here and have all these championships by looking ahead, man. You get here by having the right mentality, not getting complacent and putting in the work.”Also Read: The NFL to soon take action against Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes for allegedly exaggerating hits he receives during games It's the second time in a decade that the Kansas City Chiefs will face the Buffalo Bills in the AFC Championship Game , which followed their last matchup in 2021.

NEW DELHI: A prominent TV host apologized live to Novak Djokovic for making fun of the 24-time Grand Slam champion and his Serbian supporters, claiming it was only lighthearted banter at the Australian Open.After defeating Jiri Lehecka in three sets on Rod Laver Arena on Sunday night to go to the quarterfinals, the 37-year-old tennis legend declined to participate in a standard on-court interview.He later claimed that it was in protest of Tony Jones, a prominent sports presenter with Channel Nine, whom he said had made ""insulting and offensive comments"" about him and Serbian supporters.Djokovic threatened to stop doing interviews with the television network until he received an apology.""The comments were made on the news on the Friday night, which I considered to be banter. I considered it to be humour, which is consistent with most things I do,"" Jones said on Monday.""Having said that, I was made aware on Saturday morning, from Tennis Australia via the Djokovic camp, that the Djokovic camp was not happy at all with those comments.""As such I immediately contacted the Djokovic camp and issued and apology to them -- 48 hours ago -- for any disrespect that Novak felt, that I had caused.""As I stand here now I can only stand by that apology to Novak.""On Friday, while the seasoned commentator was live at Melbourne Park, a sizable contingent of Djokovic supporters brandishing Serbian flags started applauding behind him.Jones responded by singing to them: ""Novak, he's overrated ... Novak's a has-been. Novak, kick him out.""""I should also say the disrespect was extended, in many ways, to the Serbian fans,"" he said in his apology.""We have built up a nice rapport with the Serbian fans ... there is banter, and I thought what I was doing was an extension of that banter. Quite clearly that has not been interpreted that way.""I feel as though I've let down the Serbian fans. It has been an unfortunate situation.""The Serbian Council of Australia demanded Jones's dismissal and stated it had filed a complaint with the Australian Human Rights Commission in a strongly worded statement released prior to his apology.""His comments are offensive, racist and only serve to incite further discrimination of Australian-Serbs,"" it said.Jones was also a target for American player Danielle Collins last week after he labelled her a ""brat"" when she thanked Australian Open hecklers for ""paying my bills"" in her defeat of home hope Destanee Aiava.",Australian TV host apologizes live to Novak Djokovic for making fun of Serbian fans.

NEW DELHI: One look at two-time Olympic champion Viktor Axelsen , and the word that comes to mind is: Imposing.Also known as ‘The Great Dane’, Axelsen is true to the moniker given to him. The 31-year-old Axelsen, after reaching the court, marks his guard and stands bang in the middle – equidistant to all his sides from the baseline as well as the side lines.It’s a sight to see, to witness how an elite athlete is a stickler for perfection. Even an inch matters!Then, standing in the middle of the court and aided by his long levers, the 6-foot-4 Axelsen retrieves everything you throw at him. Everything!The fact also is that Axelsen’s arms are really long. Just by taking a wide stance, he can salvage situations. Fetching the shuttle back from unthinkable positions. It’s not that he has to contort his body much, it’s just very organic.Axelsen is at the peak of his powers. His smash deadly. His reach sublime. His court coverage tremendous. At the net or towards the baseline, in the air or on the ground, Axelsen is simply irresistible.That’s what Hong Kong’s Lee Cheuk Yiu found out on Sunday at the KD Jadhav Indoor Hall in the men’s singles final of the India Open Super 750 tournament. Lee, a losing finalist in the 2024 edition, once again had to endure the same result as Axelsen won 21-16, 21-8 in just 41 minutes.“To be honest, to win this title is very special to me. It has just been a different feeling on court and different preparation. I am starting to feel like my motivation is back. I have competed tooth and nail this week,” Axelsen, a winner of the tournament in 2017 and 2019, said after another title win.“Since the Olympics, I’ve had a little bit of issues with injuries. And that has been affecting my motivation a little bit. So, to be here now and win the title means a lot.“This is a first one as a 31-year-old. But again, as I have said in other interviews, I was in my first final here (at the India Open) 10 years ago, which is crazy. So many things have happened in the last 10 years. But it feels very surreal to win this for the third time in my sixth final at the India Open. It is amazing,” added the Paris Olympics men’s singles champion.Lee had finished runner-up in the last edition and his dream of winning the title remained unfulfilled. The 28-year-old Lee made a good start, opening up a 6-3 lead in the first game.But Axelsen found his rhythm soon and gained momentum to go into an 11-8 lead at the break. Lee kept fighting but couldn’t pose a real threat as Axelsen blunted his attack with his retrieval skills. The Dane got five game points and converted one of them after Lee’s return went long.Once Axelsen pocketed the opening game, he simply ran away with the second. He moved from 10-6 to 19-6 with a series of booming smashes to dismantle Lee’s defence and complete the win in no time.The women’s singles final was also a one-sided affair with Paris Olympics champion An-Se Young of South Korea extending her dominance over Thailand’s Pornpawee Chochuwong with a 21-12, 21-9 triumph in just 39 minutes.The 2023 India Open champion came into the final with a 9-0 head-to-head record against Chochuwong and took control of the match in the initial exchanges itself. Young raced to an 11-4 lead in the opening game and then held 11 game points. The Thai saved three of them, but the gap was too big for her to cover.In the second game, Young took a 7-1 lead and then controlled proceedings perfectly to continue her all-win record in 2025 by adding her second India Open title to the Malaysia Open Super 1000 crown she bagged last week. The 22-year-old Korean hasn’t dropped a single game in her 10 matches this year.In the doubles events, Malaysian combination of Goh Sze Fei and Nur Izzuddin, who had ended India’s Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty ’s run at the semifinals, found a way past Korean pair of Kim Won Ho and Seo Seung Jae 21-15,13-21, 21-16 in the men’s doubles final.In the women’s doubles final, the unseeded Japanese combination of Arisa Igarashi and Ayako Sakuramoto capped off their giant killing run with a clinical 21-15, 21-13 victory over South Korea’s Kim Hye Jang and Kong Hee Young. This is only the third tournament together for the Japanese pair.Chinese second seeds Jiang Zhen Bang and Wei Ya Xin ended the run of unseeded French combination of Thom Gicquel and Delphine Delrue with a 21-18, 21-17 win in the mixed doubles final.Men’s singles final: 3-Viktor Axelsen (Den) bt Lee Cheuk Yiu (Hkg) 21-16, 21-8.Women’s singles final: 1-An-Se Young (Kor) bt 8-Pornpawee Chochuwong (Tha) 21-12, 21-9.Men’s doubles final: 3-Goh Sze Fei/Nu Izzuddin (Mas) bt Kim Won Ho/Seo Seung Jae (Kor) 21-15, 13-21, 21-16.Women’s doubles final: Arisa Igarashi/Ayako Sakuramoto (Jpn) bt 8-Kim Hye Jang/Kong Hee Young (Kor) 21-15, 21-13.Mixed doubles final: 2-Jiang Zhen Bang/Wei Ya Xin (Chn) bt Thom Gicquel/Delphine Delrue (Fra) 21-18, 21-17.","Viktor Axelsen beats Hong Kong's Lee Cheuk Yiu 21-16, 21-8 in the men's singles final of the India Open Super 750 tournament.

MUMBAI: In an Ethiopian dominated elite international men's field, spearheaded by the two-time defending champion Lemi Berhanu , two Eritreans would have the final word at the 20th edition of the Tata Mumbai Marathon on Sunday.Berhane Tesfay became the marathon's newest men's champion, crossing the line in 2:11:44, in a slow-paced race which turned into a thrilling tactical battle among six men. Just six seconds after Tesfay, standing out in long fluorescent yellow socks, sealed his first ever marathon title, his compatriot Merhawi Kesete (2:11:50) followed, making it a memorable Eritrean one-two finish. In an indication of how close a showdown it had been going into the final stages, it was again merely six seconds before Ethiopia's Tesfaye Demeke (2:11:56) crossed the finish line to take the bronze.The elite women's race, by contrast, saw Kenya's Joyce Chepkemoi Tele secured a commanding victory in 2:24:56 on her maiden appearance in Mumbai. Ethiopian-born Shitaye Eshete, a naturalized Bahraini now, and one of the pre-race favourites, finished second (2:25:29), while Medina Deme Armino of Ethiopia (2:27:58) completed the podium.The buzz around the men's race had centred on one man — Lemi Berhanu, who was attempting to become the first elite runner, male or female, to complete a hat-trick of titles here. The 30-year-old Ethiopian gave himself a great opportunity to make history, as he tussled with his five rivals in the leading bunch until the 39km mark. Where he had been so strong in the previous two editions, however, Berhanu surprisingly fell victim to fatigue in the warm, humid conditions and dropped back, ultimately finishing a disappointing sixth (2:14:54).If there was some consolation for Berhanu, who is still one of only two men, with Kenya's John Kelai (2007-2008), to win successive crowns, he would have very likely known once the race progressed to its halfway point that his course record (2:07:32), which he achieved two years ago, was under no threat. With the leading pack crossing 21k in 64:34, outside course record tempo, the drop in pace led to a tactical tussle particularly after the last pacer, Timoty Kibet of Kenya, dropped out at 27 kms.It made for an intriguing watch as Kenyan Philemon Rono, the runner-up behind Berhanu in 2023, exchanged the lead briefly with the reigning champion. As the group approached the daunting Pedder Road hill, one expected to see something give, as has often happened in the past. But the drama continued as the six men stayed together all along Marine Drive.Surprisingly, it was Demeke, who was first to try and pull ahead going into the last three kms. But the lead wasn't his for long as the Eritrean duo of Tesfay and Kesete, who know each other well and train regularly together, managed to find that extra gear.""I'm happy to have won today's race. The first half went smoothly, and I stayed focused on keeping a steady pace. After 25k, my strategy shifted to securing the win rather than chasing a specific time. This victory means a lot to me,"" said Tesfay who took home $50,000.Among the elite women, Sunday saw Tele notch up her second marathon win in three months. The Kenyan was also victorious in the Ljubljana City Marathon in Slovakia last Oct. And unlike the men, she was left to push herself by the 27km mark, as her rivals were nowhere in sight.Defending champion Aberash Minsewo had a slow start, and managed to stay with a group of seven women who were behind the two leading runners until halfway before dropping out of the race.In tough conditions, it was still a commendable effort by the 29-year-old who finished 41 seconds slower than the women's course record (2:24:15) belonging to Anchialem Haymanot. Not that she considered going after it, she would admit.""When I came here, I didn't think of the course record at all. My training for Mumbai was very short and I didn't think I could actually win here,"" she said.","Berhane Tesfay becomes the marathon's newest men's champion, crossing the line in 2:11:44.

Champions Trophy Squad: Chief selector Ajit Agarkar and skipper Rohit Sharma PC

KOLKATA: He came, met up with his old India teammates and then to the great relief of the team management, bowled full throttle.All eyes were on Mohammed Shami on Sunday, as the pacer returned to the national fold after more than a year following injury and prolonged rehab, with the India side getting down for the first practice session at the Eden Gardens ahead of the five-match T20I series opener against England starting Wednesday.With his troubled left knee still strapped heavily, Shami was the first bowler to pick up the white ball to loosen up. Bowling coach Morne Morkel marked the good length spot on the practice pitch as Shami bowled with a short run-up. However, even in those few deliveries, he got the ball to move around. It brought back memories.Over the course of a fine career, Shami has played some of his best cricket at the Eden Gardens. He will begin his comeback in India colours too from the same venue where it all began way back in Nov 2010, when as a 20-year-old boy from Amroha in UP, he made his first-class debut for Bengal against Assam. It went almost unnoticed, but the pacer picked up three wickets to be the highest wicket-taker for his side in that match.Three years later, an Eden Gardens packed to witness Sachin Tendulkar's penultimate Test match, also happened to see the rise of a future star of Indian cricket when Shami bagged nine wickets in his debut Test against West Indies. One legend was departing, another was taking form.At the age of 34 and with the wear and tear that his body had undergone over the years, it might not be wrong to assume that this homecoming would be the old warhorse's home stretch. On Sunday, after some fielding practice drills, Shami got into his bowling shoes to line up with fellow pacer Harshit Rana at the pacers' net. The duo bowled long spells to openers Abhishek Sharma and later Sanju Samson The need to get back a fit-again Shami has become paramount as questions remain over the availability of the recuperating Jasprit Bumrah for the Champions Trophy beginning next month. If Bumrah fails to get ready on time, India will need the experience of Shami to lead the attack. BCCI 's head of sports science Nitin Patel and National Cricket Academy (NCA) trainer Nishant Bordoloi have thus put the pacer in a strict dietary regime that includes more fruits and no place for his favourite biryani.It was learnt that Shami is unlikely to play all the five matches of the T20I series against England, but being more of a rhythm bowler, it is imperative for him to get into his stride before the Champions Trophy.Skipper Rohit Sharma on Saturday heaped praise on Shami, calling him the ""stalwart of white ball cricket"". The team will look up to him to deliver again, starting here at the Eden Gardens.",Mohammed Shami returned to the India fold after more than a year following injury and prolonged rehab. The 34-year-old bowled with a short run-up but got the ball to move around.

ILT20: Erasmus, Dunk share thoughts after Gulf Giants beat Dubai Capitals for their first win

NEW DELHI: The Abu Dhabi Knight Riders secured their second win in the ILT20 Season 3, defeating Gulf Giants by 37 runs at Dubai International Stadium on Sunday.Despite Aayan Afzal Khan 's exceptional bowling performance of four wickets for 16 runs, setting a new UAE player record in DP World ILT20, the Knight Riders managed 176/9, led by Michael Pepper's half-century. Ibrar Ahmad, Jason Holder and Ali Khan claimed two wickets each to restrict the Giants.The Giants' batting struggled early as they lost both openers during the powerplay. David Willey dismissed Adam Lyth in the first over, whilst captain James Vince fell to Ibrar Ahmad for 14 runs in the fourth over.With 40/2 at powerplay's end, the Giants were lagging behind. The situation worsened when Jordan Cox departed for 10 runs and Ibrahim Zadran was bowled by Sunil Narine after scoring 24 runs from 22 deliveries.The Giants struggled at 62/4 at the halfway mark. Gerhard Erasmus and Shimron Hetmyer attempted to salvage the innings, but Hetmyer fell for 20 runs off 15 balls to Ali Khan. Jason Holder then removed Erasmus, who scored 24 runs from 23 balls, leaving them at 96/6 in 14.1 overs.The chase proved unsuccessful as Holder dismissed Mark Adair for 19 runs, with the Giants finishing at 139/8.Earlier, the Knight Riders' powerplay was eventful, reaching 60/2. Kyle Mayers and Andries Gous scored 19 and 17 runs respectively before Tymal Mills bowled Mayers and Wahidullah Zadran caught Gous behind.Michael Pepper, batting at four, started aggressively, hitting three consecutive boundaries off Mark Adair. He achieved a 31-ball fifty with six fours and a six, forming a 50-run partnership with Joe Clarke in 33 balls.The Knight Riders' momentum was halted by Aayan Afzal Khan's remarkable spell of 4/16, surpassing Zuhaib Zuhair's previous UAE record of 4/22. He dismissed Joe Clarke (24), Alishan Sharafu, Andrew Russell (12) and Sunil Narine, reducing Knight Riders to 131/6 in 15 overs.In the final overs, Pepper was caught behind off Adair for 57, while Evans, Holder and Willey made brief contributions. Blessing Muzarabani took two wickets as the Knight Riders posted 176/9.Player of the Match, Michael Pepper said: ""When I went in, when the ball was hard, it came on nicely. Not too much bounce in the wicket. Through the innings, it got slower and slower and started turning a little bit more. There is a lot of instinct that goes in, waiting for your areas and then going from there. We have a long batting order; everyone can hit it out of the ground, but it still must be the batters that score runs""Abu Dhabi Knight Riders captain, Sunil Narine said: ""We were always thinking two steps ahead and there were more hands on deck. We could have gone closer to 200 after our start. Losing wickets in clusters denied us and that is something we can work on moving ahead. Our batting depth, it is a good problem. You have players batting down the order who might be playing higher otherwise. The guys are willing, and it is about them trying to make the best of whatever position they get.""","Abu Dhabi Knight Riders beat Gulf Giants by 37 runs at Dubai International Stadium.

NEW DELHI: Playing with the black pieces on Sunday in the second round of the Tata Steel Chess Tournament 2025 , D Gukesh conceded his first draw since becoming the world chess champion.Gukesh's opponent, Vladimir Fedoseev of Russia, began the day strongly at Wijk aan Zee, following his draw in the inaugural round on Saturday.Inside the playing hall, amid the chilly atmosphere, Gukesh finally donned the grey hoodie he had been carrying throughout many tournaments. However, there looms a question over its necessity as the heat on the board was enough to keep the grandmasters both engaged and warm.After a conservative start to the game, Gukesh moved his queen to capture Fedoseev's pawn on c5, giving the Russian an opportunity to exchange queens.Gukesh, without hesitation, traded Fedoseev's queen with Nxc5. With the queens off the board, Gukesh soon lost his rook on the 47th move but retaliated by capturing Fedoseev's knight with Kxe7. With both players left with four pawns and one rook each, they ultimately reached a stalemate. The players shook hands to agree on a draw, Gukesh's first in the 87th edition of the ""Wimbledon of Chess"".Overall, it was a day of draws, with India’s No. 1, Arjun Erigaisi , starting strong against Dutch No. 1 Anish Giri but ultimately settling for a stalemate. Both Arjun and Anish had begun their Tata Steel Masters campaigns on the back foot, suffering defeats in their respective tournament openers.While Arjun's defeat to Pentala Harikrishna was not as discouraging as Anish's heavy loss to Gukesh, Sunday's draw allowed both players to return to their camps—Anish, in particular, with a much happier face.After another long game, Pentala Harikrishna resigned against R Praggnanandhaa , giving the latter the tournament's first win and propelling him to the summit of the Challengers standings.Despite playing with the white pieces, Pentala was unable to withstand Praggnanandhaa's sharp and strategic play. With three pawns up, Praggnanandhaa left Pentala with no choice but to concede defeat.Not everyone in the Indian camp had reason to celebrate, as Leon Luke Mendonca, last year's Challengers winner, suffered another quick defeat. Facing the formidable Nodirbek Abdusattorov, Leon made a critical blunder on his 25th move with Qxd4.Capitalising on this error with precise knight and queen manoeuvres, Nodirbek secured Mendonca's downfall for the second consecutive day.Looking beyond the Indian contingent, World No. 2 Fabiano Caruana secured his first win of the tournament on Sunday, defeating the Netherlands' Jorden Van Foreest. Meanwhile, defending Masters champion Yi Wei settled for a draw against Alexey Sarana. The day's longest game, a 66-move marathon between Vincent Keymer and Max Warmerdam, also ended in a draw.ALSO SEE: Tata Steel Chess 2025 Schedule In the Challengers section, Divya Deshmukh, despite arriving late to the table, started the game on a strong note, putting Thai Dai Van under early pressure. However, the Czech chess grandmaster mounted a solid comeback, prompting Divya to settle for a draw, a fair outcome for the Indian player.Divya's compatriot, Rameshbabu Vaishali , who had secured an outstanding victory in the opening round, was forced to accept a draw against 14-year-old Miaoyi Lu of China.","D Gukesh concedes his first draw since becoming world chess champion.

NEW DELHI: The wait is finally over. India men's senior selection committee chaired by Ajit Agarkar will pick India's provisional squad for the upcoming Champions Trophy tomorrow (January 18) in Mumbai and they are set to face a happy headache while doing the same. While top-order is more or less clear, they need to find the right pieces for the middle-order puzzle. There are plenty of players in the mix for those 3-4 positions but Shreyas Iyer remains a no-brainer for the middle-overs period.With the right mix of caution and aggression, he has aced the 50-over game in the past and had a stellar 2023 ODI World Cup where he amassed 530 runs in 11 innings. The runs came at a healthy strike-rate and he hit two hundreds and three half-centuries during India's campaign. The right-hander had a turbulent little period where he lost out on an annual contract but bounced back in emphatic fashion during the IPL where he led KKR to the title.There were three ordinary outings against Sri Lanka in the ODIs but he rediscovered the touch during the domestic season where he made substantial contributions, across formats, for Mumbai. 452 runs in five First Class innings were followed by 345 runs in Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and 325 runs in five List A fixtures. He has the weight of runs behind him but more importantly has the game suited for the surfaces in Dubai. With spin expected to play a major role in the tournament, Iyer has what it takes to control the middle period of the game like he did during the 2023 ODI World Cup.He has time and again reiterated that he is not fussy about batting positions and that flexibility will certainly come good. The England ODIs will definitely help coach Gautam Gambhir and captain Rohit Sharma to finalise composition of their middle-order, and it will make a lot of sense if it revolves around Iyer.Yes, there are plenty of right-handers in the middle-order mix at the moment but India do have some flexible left-handers in the lower-order who they can seamlessly move around as per the match situation. Those movements were on display during the three ODIs vs Sri Lanka and it could well continue in the upcoming ODI assignments.Axar Patel or Ravindra Jadeja? Or both?India picked both the left-arm spin all-rounders for the T20 World Cup but only Axar played the Sri Lanka ODIs as Jadeja was rested. The selectors now need to take that tough call because Axar did exceedingly well in the T20 World Cup and looked good in the ODIs vs Sri Lanka too. Jadeja, on the other hand, last played an ODI back in November 2023.It now remains to be seen whether the management moves on from Jadeja or carries both. It will be very difficult to ignore Axar because he lends a lot of balance to the Playing XI with his all-round abilities.All the questions will be answered in a few hours' time as the men who matter will get in a huddle to pick the squad for the multi-nation tournament.",India men's senior selection committee will pick provisional squad for Champions Trophy.

David Miller lauds Lhuan-dre Pretorius after Paarl Royals beat MI Cape Town

Dinesh Karthik on Lhuan-dre Pretorius, start for Paarl Royals in SA20

Jasprit Bumrah injury: Where things stand with BOOM!

Lhuan-dre Pretorius may be living life in the fast lane at the Paarl Royals in the SA20 , but the teenager’s dad Abe is still picking up traffic fines.Pretorius has burst on the global cricket scene in spectacular fashion with the former South Africa U-19 star smashing two half-centuries in three matches to top the SA20 run-scorers list.He has surprised many with the maturity he’s shown at the crease. Unfazed at the prospect of facing up to the likes of Trent Boult, Kagiso Rabada, Marco Jansen and Ottniel Baartman.But Abe Pretorius - Lhuan-dre’s father - claims his son is still just a normal teen finding his way in the world.“I remember when Anrich Nortje bowled to him. He told me an interesting story: ‘Dad, I wasn’t scared of the ball. I was more scared of me running into him because I saw it on TV.’ He was never afraid. Pace never bothered him,” said the senior Pretorius.“But he’s still a baby. He’s only 18. He has a mustache. But his beard is soft. He's still a kid and sometimes I forget.“But he's also not a kid getting all the speed fines. The car is still in my name. It's crazy!”The Pretorius family have certainly been there to support Lhuan-dre and fellow South African schools prodigy Vihan - ‘he’s my baby and can do no wrong’ - cricket aspirations since they first picked up a cricket bat.Abe installed a training net at their home in Potchefstroom early on and since they stayed close to Senwes Park - home of the North West Dragons - would regularly take his sons there to train.Lhuan-dre, therefore, had the privilege of spending time with the likes of SA20 stars Bjorn Fortuin and Rassie van der Dussen from a very young age.“He always wanted to play the game. He was brought up next to the field at Senwes Park. So, I was privileged to have a hospitality suite there. And that’s where he met Bjorn and Rassie.“He always played with them or next to the field to see them playing. And that's what's so nice. He plays now with Bjorn. There's a bit of banter going on between them.”At this critical age parents can often become over-indulged with their children’s sporting careers, forcing them to train when they may no longer enjoy it.Abe was never confronted with this issue.“He lives for cricket. He YouTubes cricket every night. I don’t think he’s watched a cartoon ever in his life. From a young age, before any big game, he would wake me up at five.“And we had a net in our yard at the back. So I needed to throw to him before school. And when he gets picked up and then he's ready in the afternoon.“I think more waking him up for academics. He never wanted to study. That was a headache and we had to get a tutor to assist him.”Whilst it was almost the perfect childhood growing up in Potchefstroom, the major cricket-playing high schools are based in Johannesburg. That’s close to 120 kilometres away.It is common practice for young South African boys to leave their family homes at 12-13 years old after being afforded scholarships to attend these ivy-league schools as hostel boarders.But Abe was having none of it. Instead, he packed up and relocated the entire family to “The Big Smoke” - as Johannesburg is colloquially referred to - for Lhuan-dre to attend the prestigious St Stithians College - alma mater of Kagiso Rabada, Grant Elliot and a certain Kwena Maphaka.The latter is, of course, the same age as Lhuan-dre with their cricket journeys following an almost identical path. They played together at school, youth provincial Lions teams, SA U19, and now at the Royals.And according to Abe, it's Lhuan-dre, who kept wicket for most of this period, that knows how to inspire the tearaway rookie fast bowler.“Lhuan-dre knew just how to switch Kwena on. He would always go up to Kwena and whisper something in his ear, and Kwena would get spitting mad,” he said.“After that, Kwena would run through the teams. There are a lot of video clips of when they were at school together, especially when Lhuan-dre was keeping. They were a mean team.”With Lhuan-dre being a left-handed opening batter that keeps wicket, has Gunn & Moore as his bat sponsor, and also having an aversion to a prospective academic career, the comparisons with Proteas and Durban's Super Giants star Quinton de Kock were inevitable.But according to Abe, Lhuan-dre would not want it any other way, and is looking forward to the Royals’ first clash against the Super Giants at Kingsmead on Thursday, January 23.“He’s had a photo up of Quinny since he was very young. He’s still Quinny’s biggest fan. He simply loved Quinny.“Everything about him is Quinny. Yeah, I think you're going to see when they're going to play each other. It's going to be a challenge. I think he's going to be a star-struck!""Everything is happening at the speed of light for Pretorius right now. If he maintains this early season momentum through SA20 Season 3, it would not be far too to suggest that the powerful left-hander could come into the reckoning as a potential replacement at the Indian Premier League (IPL) in the near future.So, how does a father keep a teenager in check when the whole world suddenly wants to give him everything his heart has always desired?“I'm Afrikaans! That's all. He knows me. I don’t play.“I'm a mining oak and I'm Afrikaans. So, he'll know his way.“That's a cultural thing. He knows how it works. You stay humble.”",Lhuan-dre Pretorius has scored two half-centuries in three matches for Paarl Royals in the SA20. The 18-year-old has surprised many with the maturity he’s shown at the crease. Abe Pretorius says his son is still just a normal teen finding his way in the world.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117332449,imgsize-38972,width-400,resizemode-4/117332449.jpg"

Numbers elicit praise from likes of Sachin

NAGPUR: Ironic as it may sound, the buzzword in Indian cricket over the past weeks has been a non-cricketing term - PR. Fan wars on social media, ignited by the debacle in Australia, sparked debates on 'paid news' versus authenticity.With the debate still raging, a post on X went viral on social media on Thursday evening. "" Karun Nair has a serious shot at making it to the Indian team if he can afford hiring a PR agency for a while,"" said the post.The witty remark struck a chord, highlighting the one element missing in Nair's arsenal - a robust social media presence. But in the Vijay Hazare Trophy , it wasn't PR that spoke for him; it was his bat, loud and clear.A total of 752 runs, at an unbelievable average of 752 was enough for Nair to trend on X. Social media has been abuzz, with many urging Indian selectors to draft Nair into the Indian squad for the forthcoming England ODI series and the Champions Trophy scheduled in Pakistan and Dubai.With an unstoppable 88* off just 44 balls on Thursday, Nair, who had been knocking on the selectors' door, almost broke it in the semifinal. Coming in to bat in the 35th over, the Vidarbha skipper unleashed his magic in the final 15 balls he played in the match, stacking up 55* runs. His ball-by-ball figures read 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 6, 6, 1, 6, 4, 0, 6, 4, 4, 6. He hit boundaries for fun and toyed with the field at will.Cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar lauded Nair's run on Friday. ""Scoring 752 runs in 7 innings with 5 centuries is nothing short of extraordinary, @karun126. Performances like these don't just happen, they come from immense focus and hard work. Keep going strong and make every opportunity count,"" he posted on X.Former Indian spinner Harbhajan Singh too was vocal on his Youtube channel, questioning the double standards of selectors. ""Different rules for different people… that shouldn't be the way. When Nair is scoring runs, you need to play him, right? He doesn't have tattoos, doesn't wear fancy clothes, is that the reason you're not picking him? Does he not work hard,"" he said.Some also drew comparisons of Nair's purple patch with that of VVS Laxman before the stylish batsman was re-drafted in the Indian squad. ""When Laxman made a comeback into the Indian team, he made a big statement with 1,400-odd runs. Nair's stupendous show should be enough for him to launch his comeback,"" a post read.Nair's super show has rewritten history books too. He now tops the list of most runs as a captain in the Vijay Hazare trophy. He is also set to finish as batsman with highest average in Vijay Hazare history.Prior to being dismissed for 112 against Uttar Pradesh, Nair had set a new List A record of scoring 542 runs without being dismissed, going past former New Zealand allrounder James Franklin","Vidarbha batsman Karun Nair scores 752 runs at an average of 752 in Vijay Hazare Trophy.

Hopefully, 2025 will be a better season for us: Sharjah Warriorz captain Tim Southee

ILT20: Captain speak on media day ahead of third season

Sharjah Warriorz clinched a thrilling victory over Dubai Capitals in their first home game of the season, thanks to a stunning counter-attacking innings by Sri Lankan batter Avishka Fernando . With this win, the Warriorz have climbed to the second spot on the points table.The Sharjah Warriorz chased down the target with 5 wickets and 11 deliveries to spare , despite facing a daunting chase of 202 runs. Captain Tim Southee praised Fernando's incredible performance, especially considering he had just arrived on the morning of the match.""To chase down a score like that and that innings from Fernando was incredible. To get off the plane in the morning and do that is special. Fernando was outstanding for us,"" Southee said.Southee acknowledged that there were areas for improvement, particularly in fielding and bowling, but he was pleased with the team's depth, as several players stepped up to perform despite some being sick.Coach JP Duminy echoed Southee's sentiments, emphasising the need to work on their fielding as a collective effort. He expressed the team's desire to excel in this aspect of the game.""Fielding is an area of our game that we can work on. We try to collectively put in a big effort in the field. So, that's something we want to work on and fielding is something we want to be better at for sure,"" Duminy said.Avishka Fernando, who scored a blistering 81 off just 27 deliveries, with 8 sixes and 6 fours, credited his success to focusing on his natural game and maintaining a positive mindset while chasing a formidable target. Fernando's knock was the fastest-ever 50 in the history of the ILT20 .""Focussing on my natural game and thank the lord for today's knock. The wicket was nice to bat today, the thoughts when chasing 200 was to be positive, it came naturally and thankful for that. I did not realise that I have broken the record for the fastest-ever 50.""Coach Duminy showered praise on Fernando, commending his confidence and ability to perform despite having just joined the team. He emphasised the importance of creating an environment where players feel at ease, which is something the Sharjah Warriorz strive for.""Just the mindset that he came in with, he got off the plane last night and got introduced to the team after that. And to have the confidence to arrive and play the way he did, shows, not only his character but also his ability. And just for him to feel at ease in our environment is something we (Sharjah Warriorz) strive for, but that was certainly one of the most special knocks we have seen,"" the coach added.Duminy revealed that the team talk at the halfway stage was light-hearted, focusing on the quality of the pitch and the need to play to their abilities. He emphasised that intent would never be lacking in their lineup and that consistency was the key moving forward.Sharjah Warriorz will face the MI Emirates in their next match at Sharjah on Sunday.",Sharjah Warriorz beat Dubai Capitals by five wickets.

We're a better outfit than the last two games: Super Giants coach Lance Klusener

Keep improving and play some better cricket: Sunrisers' Liam Dawson

Durban's Super Giants faced another setback in the ongoing SA20 League , suffering a 58-run loss to defending champions Sunrisers Eastern Cape at Kingsmead on Friday. The defeat marked their second consecutive loss at home, leaving head coach Lance Klusener visibly disappointed with his team's performance.""We have a proud record from last season playing at home, so this is absolutely disappointing,"" Klusener said after the match. ""I think we're a better outfit than how we turned out in the last two games. While the surfaces have been challenging, that's no excuse. We lacked the aggression to take the first punch, and when you're on the back foot, it's tough to recover.""The Sunrisers, who entered the match on the back of three consecutive losses, delivered a resounding comeback. Klusener credited their sharpness and determination. ""They came in with three losses, so for them to bounce back the way they did was outstanding. They were running well between the wickets, and we all know how well they field. Sometimes it's the small things that make the big difference.""The Super Giants' batting woes continued to be a concern, with the team failing to capitalise on starts. ""It's not about the batting quality; we have outstanding batters. The problem lies in not building partnerships or capitalising on starts. This evening that surface was tough to make a comeback against some quality spin,"" Klusener explained.Noor Ahmad was the standout performer for Super Giants, taking 4 for 25. Klusener praised his former Afghanistan players, Ahmad and Naveen-ul-Haq , the latter finishing with 1 for 44. ""Noor has been an outstanding performer for a few years now. He bowls at a good pace, making it tough to pick him through the air. That's his strength. Naveen is quality too - most wickets in T20s last year. It's great to see them both step up.""Looking ahead, Klusener emphasised the need for self-reflection. ""We need to focus on ourselves rather than worrying too much about the opposition. The way we batted, especially without building partnerships, needs to change. While our bowling is in a better place, we need to score more runs to be competitive,"" he said.Meanwhile, Sunrisers Eastern Cape finally broke their losing streak in the SA20 season with the big win. The defending champions, who had struggled in their first three matches, delivered a performance that Liam Dawson described as crucial for their campaign.""It was a very important win. We know how good they are, especially at home,"" Dawson remarked in the post-match press conference. ""They've got two quality spinners in Noor Ahmed and Keshav Maharaj. So we knew it was going to be tough coming here and getting a win. As a group, we’ve been honest with ourselves—we haven’t played to our potential at all yet in this tournament. This was a massive game for us, and we’re very, very happy to get the win.""Dawson highlighted the team’s resolve to use this victory as a turning point. ""Without doubt, we’d love this to be the catalyst for more winning performances and points on the board. We know we’ve been below our standards in the first three or four games. We’ve got to come back Sunday and try to produce another good performance against a very strong side,"" he said.Acknowledging the competitive nature of the SA20 League, Dawson stressed the need for continuous improvement. ""Every team is strong in this competition. We won’t take this win for granted at all. There’s a lot we need to improve on as a group. The focus is on keeping the momentum and playing better cricket,"" he added.",Durban's Super Giants lost 58-run to Sunrisers Eastern Cape at Kingsmead.

Former India cricketer Aakash Chopra has expressed surprise over the BCCI 's decision to enforce mandatory travel rules for players, requiring them to travel together with the team for matches and practice sessions. Speaking on his YouTube channel, Chopra questioned the necessity of such a regulation and suggested it might have been introduced due to prior misuse.""Players cannot travel separately with families.All players are expected to travel with the team to and from matches and practice sessions. I am extremely surprised by this rule. Going for practice or the match is with the team only,"" Chopra said. ""This has been happening forever. If someone wants to practice more, they request the coach. But has someone been leaving early? Some abuse must have happened; that's why this rule is being enforced,"" he added.The BCCI's decision follows a review meeting held after India's 1-3 loss to Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, attended by captain Rohit Sharma , head coach Gautam Gambhir , and chief selector Ajit Agarkar Referencing recent incidents, Chopra clarified that isolated lapses, like Yashasvi Jaiswal reportedly arriving late to a session, do not reflect a widespread issue. ""I am pretty sure everyone wouldn't have been flouting the rule. Yashasvi Jaiswal couldn't reach recently, and he got punished for being late. That's a different story,"" he explained.Chopra also highlighted the importance of accountability for those who might have allowed exceptions in the past. ""If someone claims they don't need to travel with the team because they're staying elsewhere or it's their city, then whoever permitted this should be called out,"" he asserted.The new rule requires players seeking to travel separately to obtain permission from both the head coach and the chairman of selectors. While acknowledging that such regulations might feel overly strict, Chopra remarked, ""Such things are bound to happen if rules are abused.""",Aakash Chopra has expressed surprise over the BCCI's decision to enforce mandatory travel rules for players.

Champions Trophy Squad: Chief selector Ajit Agarkar and skipper Rohit Sharma PC

Gavaskar recalls ‘love at first sight’ with Wankhede

MUMBAI: At a time when the fans are despondent thanks to India’s back-to-back series defeats home and away to New Zealand and Australia, India’s Test and ODI captain Rohit Sharma has offered hope amidst the gloom.Speaking at a glittering function hosted by the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) on Sunday evening at the Wankhede Stadium to celebrate 50 years of the iconic venue in Mumbai on Sunday, Rohit expressed his desire to bring the Champions Trophy back to the Wankhede Stadium, while referring to the celebrations at the stadium after India clinched the 2011 ODI World Cup and the T20 World Cups in 2007 and 2024.Sharing his aspirations for the global tournament, the 37-year-old said, “We will try our best... I’m sure that the wishes of 140 crore Indians will be behind us when we land in Dubai for the Champions Trophy. We will try to do well and bring the Champions Trophy 2025 to the Wankhede Stadium.”The 2025 Champions Trophy will begin from Feb 19 in Pakistan and UAE.On the occasion, the MCA felicitated all the surviving Mumbai players who went on to captain India-Sunil Gavaskar, Diana Eduilji (women's), Dilip Vengsarkar, Ravi Shastri Sachin Tendulkar , Rohit and Ajinkya Rahane.Recalling the celebrations at the Wankhede Stadium, which included an open-top bus parade at the Marine Drive here after India won the T20 World Cup in the West Indies & USA under his captaincy last year, Rohit said, “We were locked inside the hotel in Barbados (due to a hurricane). But winning the World Cup and celebrating it with your people is a different thing. You celebrate anyway with your players and teams but celebrating it with your people is a different feeling and I knew that will happen only once we are back in Mumbai.”Rohit revealed that he wanted the T20 World Cup trophy celebrations to take place only at the Wankhede Stadium. “I remember, we were still in Barbados after winning the (T20) World Cup and we were stuck there due to a storm but planning was in process as to what we will do once we are back in India. It was planned that we would go to (New) Delhi but what after that?“No one knew what to do after that, but I wanted that World Cup (trophy) should come here at Wankhede. Each of the World Cups which we have won in 2007 and 2011 have been celebrated at Wankhede and bringing it (the trophy) of 2024 was also very important for us. When we celebrated here (last year), the stands were full, (and) even today they are full, which is special about Wankhede,” he gushed.It’s clear that the enthusiastic Wankhede crowd, which makes for an electric atmosphere, has a special place in Rohit’s heart. “It was my dream to play cricket here at Wankhede since I was a kid. Irrespective of who plays here, India, Mumbai or Mumbai Indians, the crowd never disappoints and that’s why it’s a different feeling when you play here. When we returned from South Africa after winning the (T20) World Cup, I dreamt about winning another World Cup and bringing it here,” he said.Explaining why this stadium means so much to him, Rohit said, “Wankhede is one ground where every cricketer enjoys making dreams of playing here and seeing them come to reality. It is good to dream and to see them come to reality and I have watched and played cricket since my childhood because the atmosphere at this ground is very different. Every cricketer loves to come here and play cricket so that is the feeling you get at Wankhede.”Turning emotional as the MCA celebrated his 75th birthday on the special occasion, Gavaskar said, “When the Wankhede Stadium was built in 1974, our dressing room was downstairs. When we stepped into the ground for the first time for a practice session, it was love at first sight. Prior to that, we were playing at the Brabourne Stadium, which belonged to a club (Cricket Club of India). But coming here, it felt like the home ground of Mumbai cricket. The feeling is always different when you have a home ground. I still get that feeling whenever I come for commentary. My chest swells with pride.”Responding to his thoughts on the famous picture on being carried on his shoulders by his teammates after India triumphed in the 2011 World Cup, Tendulkar said, “It was without any doubt the best moment of my life. (Referring to Gavaskar), their 1983 victory inspired me that even I should have a trophy in my hand. We came close to winning the World Cup in 1996 in India and in South Africa in 2003. However, we crossed the final at the Wankhede Stadium at my home ground. Till that point, no host nation had won the World Cup.”The MCA also felicitated veteran cricket coach Vilas Godbole, who is the only living member of the 1972-73 managing committee, when the Wankhede Stadium was being built, and Shashi Prabhu, the architect of the cricket venue.",India captain Rohit Sharma has expressed his desire to bring the Champions Trophy back to the Wankhede Stadium.
