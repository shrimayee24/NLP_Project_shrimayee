England captain Ben Stokes summed up his team's struggles on Day 4 of their second Test against Pakistan in Multan on Friday. Chasing a target of 297 to clinch the series 2-0, the visitors found themselves in deep trouble at 7 wickets down, needing over 160 runs to win.Stokes was in good form, having scored 37 runs off 36 balls and aggressively countering Pakistan’s bowling after a series of early dismissals.However, his innings came to an abrupt end when he charged down the pitch to left-arm spinner Noman Ali. In a comical turn of events, Stokes lost grip of his bat, leading to an easy stumping by Mohammad Rizwan. This dismissal marked Noman Ali 's fifth wicket of the innings and quickly went viral on social media due to its humourous nature.Pakistan relied heavily on their spinners, Noman Ali and Sajid Khan, on a pitch offering turn, leaving England unable to counter their sustained pressure.Starting at 36 for 2, the visitors quickly lost Ollie Pope, Joe Root, and Harry Brook, the triple centurion from the first Test, crashing to 78 for 5.Remarkably, only two Pakistani bowlers were used during the second innings until the 32nd over, as Noman Ali and Sajid Khan running through the England batting.All-rounder Brydon Carse attempted to mount some resistance, hitting three sixes in his 27 runs, but he too fell victim to Noman Ali’s spin. The 38-year-old spinner took his seventh wicket by inducing an inside edge from Jack Leach, dismissing England for 144 runs and marking their 9th wicket.Noman Ali’s performance was historic, as he achieved his first career 10-wicket haul in just his 16th Test match , finishing with impressive figures of 8 for 46, with Shoaib Bashir falling for a first-ball duck.Ultimately, Pakistan secured victory by 152 runs, marking their first home Test win in over three years.","England captain Ben Stokes summed up his team's struggles on Day 4 of their second Test against Pakistan in Multan.

Dravid was the last Indian cricketer to achieve this feat in 2006 and also the fastest in terms of the fewest innings of 176.Notably, Kohli reached his first 8000 runs in March 2022 but took more than two and half years to reach the 9000-run mark.

Once he settled in, there was no stopping him, as he effortlessly accumulated runs with ease.In the recent Test series against Bangladesh, Kohli became the fastest batter to reach 27,000 international runs, achieving the milestone in just 594 innings.In four Tests this year, including the first innings against New Zealand, Kohli has managed to score just 157 runs across seven innings at an average of 26.16, with no half-centuries and a highest score of 47.","Virat Kohli scores first half-century of the year in India's first Test against New Zealand.

India vs New Zealand Test: Focus returns on India batters after high-scoring day

BENGALURU: Each time New Zealand’s Rachin Ravindra is asked about his Indian lineage or his Bengaluru connection, he speaks about how special his parents’ hometown is. There is no denying the 24-year-old has a deep-rooted connection with the city, particularly the M Chinnaswamy Stadium.During the 50-over World Cup last year, he came up with a swashbuckling century (108) against Pakistan at the venue; and on Friday, he showcased why he is an exciting package of class and craft.On a day when over 450 runs came off the strip, Rachin’s 157-ball-134 (13x4; 4x6) was highlighted by quick but cautious scoring. With pacers Siraj and Jasprit Bumrah keeping it tight, Rachin concentrated on playing them off. It was the spinners he went after.He brought up his 50 by smashing the ball over bowler Kuldeep Yadav’s head and for his first maximum, he launched a floater from Ashwin into the stands beyond deep midwicket. Fittingly he brought up his century with a boundary off Ashwin.By the time he was dismissed by Kuldeep, for 258 minutes he had put up an exhibition of game awareness, nimble footwork and control.Rachin hasn’t learned to adapt to Indian conditions overnight. Instead, it has been ingrained in him by his father Ravindra Krishnamurthy, who was also his first coach. That has led to Rachin spending time in India adapting to the conditions and circumstances.In the build-up to the World Cup, he travelled with his home club, the Wellington-based Hutt Hawks, to Bengaluru and Anantapur. Before the Black Caps’ subcontinent tour beginning with the washed-out Test against Afghanistan, Rachin worked at the Chennai Super Kings Academy. The allrounder, who was roped in by the IPL franchise last season, went through strenuous batting drills during his time in Chennai.Ravindra, who witnessed his son’s second Test century, gave an insight into what Rachin worked at the Academy.“Rachin trained at the academy for about a week. In 40 degrees Celsius, in that humidity, he practiced on a gravel kind of surface. The ball is jumping and turning, dust is coming off, and you are drenched in sweat. I mean nothing can get worse than that. This century, I think, is because of that preparation,” he explained.Concurring with his father, Rachin, who showcased a remarkable temperament as wickets tumbled at the other end, said “It was an invaluable experience. I thought it’d be the best thing for me to go and have a few days of training there in more realistic conditions than what we’d have doctored in New Zealand. I""I was lucky enough, the CSK guys sorted me with 4-5 good days of training on red and black soil wickets. That helped me sort of shore up some game plans and work on a few positions that I wanted to.""","Rachin Ravindra scored 157-ball-134 (13x4; 4x6) against India.

India vs New Zealand Test: Focus returns on India batters after high-scoring day

BENGALURU: The swagger with which India’s top-order batters went about their business at the M Chinnaswamy stadium here on Friday against New Zealand was quite unlike a team that is looking to save a Test. After all, they had just conceded a 356-run first-innings deficit.For a team which had collapsed to a humiliating 46 all out in their first innings, there seemed no trace of anxiety when Rohit Sharma and Yashasvi Jaiswal strode out to bat towards the end of the second session.The intent was clear: play a fearless brand of cricket, the result be damned.This, perhaps, is what sets Rohit & Co apart. Fear of failure isn’t a part of the team’s fibre.It helped that the wicket had eased and the visiting pacers, who wreaked havoc the previous day, did not get as much purchase or seam movement as they had in the first innings. The fielding too had slipped a notch from the side that had plucked catches out of thin air, literally, in the first innings.When stumps were drawn, India were 231/3 in 49 overs, 125 runs still in deficit, but the game appeared to have been brought to even keel. India would have been better placed had not Virat Kohli (70; 102b; 8x4; 1x6) been dismissed off the final ball of the day. He looked good for a bigger partnership with Sarfaraz Khan (70; 78b; 7x3; 3x6).Even so, it was a good day for the spectators. They had cheered for ‘homeboy’ Rachin Ravindra (134; 157b; 13x4; 4x6), who went on to compile his second international century at this venue to help the visitors to a very competitive first-innings tally of 402.Then, when the Indians came out to bat, it was as close to a highlight reel as one could get in this format.Rohit, typically, began the assault, flicking Matt Henry through mid-on. He followed it up with another hit to the fence in the fourth over. Rohit (52; 63b, 8x4; 1x6) and Jaiswal (35) had India off to a flying start. That their association ended with 72 on board was in large part to the left-hander trying to increase the pace even further.Jaiswal stepped out against Ajaz Patel (2/70), misjudged completely, and wicketkeeper Tom Blundell did the rest. Not long after, Rohit was foxed by an Ajaz delivery that straightened a bit to sneak onto the stumps.Unlike Thursday, there were no infamous records. Instead, Virat Kohli became the fourth Indian after Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Sunil Gavaskar to cross 9,000 runs in the format. Kohli and Sarfaraz turned the last session into a visual treat, until Glenn Philips dealt a body blow securing Kohli’s edge. A review only confirmed Kohli’s departure.India have depth in batting but it will take momentous innings from the likes of Sarfaraz, KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant (if he is fit) to pull off an improbable result.Earlier, New Zealand had begun the day at 180/3, a 134-run lead, and the desperation for wickets was evident as Rohit shuffled his bowlers around.Mohammed Siraj (2/84) secured the breakthrough in the 13th over, getting Daryl Mitchell to offer Jaiswal a thick edge at gully. Phillips and Henry’s wickets were mopped up by Ravindra Jadeja (3/72) in quick succession.With the Black Caps at 233/7, India pressed hard to wrap up their innings but ran into the resolute Ravindra, who found the perfect foil in Tim Southee (65; 73b; 5x4; 4x6).The duo frustrated the Indian attack, easily finding gaps and taking a special liking to R Ashwin (1/94) and Kuldeep Yadav (3/99). At one point, the two were cruising along at over six an over.Along the way, Southee hit his 93rd six, surpassing Virender Sehwag.","When stumps were drawn, India were 231/3 in 49 overs, 125 runs still in deficit, but the game appeared to have been brought to even keel.

NEW DELHI: India achieved a remarkable milestone by becoming the first team in the 147-year history of Test cricket to hit 100 sixes in a calendar year.The Rohit Sharma-led side reached this feat on the third day of the first Test match against New Zealand in Bengaluru on Friday, surpassing England's record of 89 sixes in 2022.

Virat Kohli , who completed 9,000 Test runs during his knock, scored 70 before falling to Glenn Phillips off the last ball of the day. Rohit Sharma (52) and Sarfaraz Khan (70 not out) also contributed with fluent half-centuries, reducing the deficit to a more manageable 125 runs.New Zealand's imposing total of 402 was largely due to a crucial 134-run partnership for the eighth wicket between Rachin Ravindra (134) and Tim Southee (63).India now face an uphill task to stage a comeback, with their largest successful run chase in Test cricket being 274 against Australia in the memorable Kolkata Test of 2001.","India become first team in 147-year history of Test cricket to hit 100 sixes in a calendar year.

Pakistan have given themselves the best chance in recent times of beating a top side in Test cricket after they set England a daunting target of 297 to win in the second match of the series in Multan on day three.A 65-run stand for the ninth wicket between Agha Salman (63) and Sajid Khan (22) bailed Pakistan out of trouble in their second innings, after they had slipped to 156 for 8.The hosts were eventually bowled out for 221 to add to their first-innings lead of 75 runs and set England the task of achieving the biggest chase in the fourth innings to win a Test match in Pakistan.But before that partnership between Salman and Sajid, a hilarious banter was caught on stump microphone between Salman and Noman Ali .After Noman played a shot for a single off his hips to deep square leg, Salman asked him ""did you play it?""""Khud hi maari hai na yeh (you played it)?""

Brief scores (In Guwahati):

Assam had escaped to a draw against Jharkhand in their last game with their batters showing intent in the second innings on final day. But on Friday, in their second-round match of Ranji Trophy Elite Group D against Chandigarh in Guwahati, Assam batters could not carry the momentum they got from that inspiring draw.Opting to bat first at Barsapara Cricket Stadium , hosts Assam struggled to 249 for eight wickets in 87 overs at stumps as none of the top and middle-order batters could convert the starts they got on Day 1.It was Mukhtar Hussain ’s rearguard action at No. 9, where he scored a run-a-ball 55, that helped Assam to a respectable total in the end.Earlier, openers Parvej Musaraf and Rahul Hazarika didn’t last long as both went back to pavilion inside the eighth over scoring only nine and one, respectively. Captain Denish Das then joined forces with No. 3 Rishav Das but Assam’s hope of arresting any further damage wasn’t fulfilled as the skipper departed scoring a 26-ball 21 with three fours and the scoreboard reading 41/3 from 17 overs.Rishav (12 off 58 balls) returned soon after, being retired hurt in the 22nd over, which further damaged Assam’s prospects. Thereafter, the home team lost wickets at regular intervals with only Sibsankar Roy showing some resistance at No. 5 scoring 46 off 97 balls with five fours and a six as they were down to 162 for seven wickets. In between, debutant wicketkeeper-batter Ruhinandan Pegu (29) and Abhishek Thakuri (19) both failed to capitalise on the starts.The fall of Thakuri brought Sumit Ghadigaonkar as a substitute for Rishav and the experienced batter’s unbeaten, vigilant 41 off 123 balls with only two fours helped Assam pass the 200-run mark, albeit with the help of a cameo by Hussain down the order. The duo put on 87 runs for the eighth wicket to help Assam avoid more blushes.Hussain hit nine boundaries and two maximums to play a perfect foil to Ghadigaonkar’s patient knock, which was the need of the hour.Left-arm spinner Nishunk Birla was the pick of the Chandigarh bowlers with 3-60 as pacer medium Jagjit Singh scalped 2-35 to help the visitors’ cause. On Day 2 Assam would look for some brisk runs to add to their first innings total before trying to restrict the Chandigarh batters.Assam 249/8 in 87 overs (S Roy 46, S Ghadigaonkar 41 batting; Birla 3-60, Jagjit 2-35) vs Chandigarh.

Odisha

It was nothing short of a dream debut for Odisha spinner Sumit Sharma as he began his first-class career with a five-wicket haul against Jammu & Kashmir in their Elite Group A Ranji Trophy clash in Cuttack on Friday.His figures of five for 79 on the first day of the four-day fixture made sure that Jammu & Kashmir could not take the game away from the hosts as they finished the first innings on 270 despite top-order batter Abdul Samad (127) scoring an impressive century at Barabati Stadium .At stumps on Day 1, Odisha were 15 for the loss of opener Shantanu Mishra who was bowled by Auqib Nabi for naught in the second ball of the innings. Anurag Sarangi and Sandeep Pattnaik — batting on 8 and 6 respectively — will look to drive the innings and get them a crucial first-innings lead on Day 2 after Odisha saw their opening fixture against Tripura get washed away by rain.Earlier, J&K won the toss and chose to bat but found both their openers back in the pavilion with just 14 runs on the board. While Rajesh Mohanty (2-47) dismissed Abhinav Puri (6), Suryakant Paradhan (2-50) struck from the other end to claim the scalp of Shubham Khajuria (7).Thereafter, skipper Govinda Poddar brought debutant left-arm spinner Sharma into the attack and things began getting worse for the visiting J&K batting lineup. Even skipper Paras Dogra had no answer for Sharma’s bowling and was dismissed cheaply by the 29-year-old playing his first first-class match.Only Samad stood up to the Odisha attack and held on to one end as wickets kept tumbling at the other end. His 117-ball innings, with a strike rate of 108.5, that included six boundaries and a whopping nine sixers lifted the tempo of the J&K innings and took them to a competitive total.The highlight of their game was the 131-run partnership for the fifth wicket that Samad had with Sahil Lotra (39) and gave the visitors the optimism to fight on. While Pradhan broke the partnership by bowling out Lotra, it was the star of the day Sharma who got rid of the belligerent Samad with a catch to Sarangi.270 in 70.3 overs (A Samad 127, S Lotra 39; Mohanty 2-47, Pradhan 2-50, Sharma 5-79).15/1 in 9 overs.

Brief Scores

Vidarbha:

NAGPUR: Left proved right for Vidarbha on Friday, as two southpaw youngsters — Yash Rathod and Harsh Dubey — saved the team against minnows Puducherry. Rathod posted a century while Dubey finished Day 1 unbeaten on 69 to take Vidarbha to 261 for 8 after a top-order collapse.At 4 for 14, Vidarbha, who opted to bat, were staring down the barrel for the second time in as many matches.Big names like Dhruv Shorey , Karun Nair, and Atharva Taide along with Aman Mokhade were back in the pavilion inside eight overs. Host seamers Gourav Yadav and Sagar Udeshi were exploiting the home conditions at the Cricket Association Puducherry ’s Siechem Stadium to the maximum.Rathod (118;196b;8x4), though, timed his second Ranji Trophy century to perfection to guide Vidarbha to safety and also get back into the runs. Coming in at the crease in just the third over of the morning, with Vidarbha down at three for just four runs on the board, Rathod remained unbeaten over next 77 overs.Rathod's first ton of Ranji Trophy had helped Vidabrha make a comeback against Madhya Pradesh in last year’s semifinal. On Friday, Rathod’s 197-ball knock took Vidarbha to relative safety.The Vidarbha No. 5 batter stitched together three key partnerships — with skipper Akshay Wadkar Akshay Karnewar and Dubey — to script the Vidarbha fightback after the team was left gasping by the early blows of the morning session.Rathod’s last partnership of the day, with allrounder Dubey, was the most important one for Vidarbha. Before Dubey joined the rescue act, Rathod had two 50-plus partnerships each with Wadkar (31;50b;3x4) and Karnewar (16;53b;2x4). But with both the batters failing to convert starts into big knocks, Vidarbha were still tottering at six for 129.In Dubey, Rathod found a partner willing to stay long at the wicket. The two batted together for almost 40 overs, adding 120 runs for the seventh wicket and bringing Vidarbha to a position from where they can hope to make a match out of it.At the other end, allrounder Dubey (69*;150b;8x4) played the perfect supporting role. The day saw Dubey post his highest First Class score , as he posted his third fifty in the format. Vidarbha would hope Dubey carries on the good work on Day 2 and takes the team past the 300-run mark.261 for 8 in 83 overs (Yash Rathod 118, Harsh Dubey 69 batting, Akshay Wadkar 31; Gourav Yadav 3-57, Sagar Udeshi 2-40, Fabid Ahmed 2-51) vs Puducherry.",Yash Rathod and Harsh Dubey save Vidarbha against minnows Puducherry.

Out of national reckoning for his reluctance to play domestic red-ball cricket last season, Ishan Kishan is leaving no stone unturned to attract the selectors’ attention for a comeback in India shirt.On Friday, the wicketkeeper-batter surely took a step towards that as he had a dream start to the second-round match of Ranji Trophy Elite Group D, scoring a brilliant ton (101 runs in 158 balls, 13 fours, 2 sixes) in Jharkhand’s away game against Railways at ADSA Railways Cricket Ground in Ahmedabad.Coming to bat at No. 6, the southpaw showcased his batting skills, ensuring that his team reaches a commanding 325/5 at the end of the first day’s play.Apart from Kishan, former captain Virat Singh also scored a century and is unbeaten on 103 at stumps. Opener Nazim Siddiquie (96 off 131 balls, 15 fours) missed out on a three-figure mark when he was stumped off Karn Sharma’s bowling.Opting to bat first, Jharkhand had a disastrous start to their innings, losing in-form opener Aryaman Sen and Utkarsh Singh inside first 10 overs to medium pacer Himangshu Sangwan, who was the pick of Railways bowlers with 4-72. Kumar Suraj and Siddiquie stitched together a 57-run stand for the third wicket to arrest the slide, but Suraj’s dismissal left the visitors in a spot of bother with only 82 runs on board.Then Siddiquie joined hands with Virat to take the total to 145 in the second session but let go an opportunity to reach a well-deserved century before Kishan teamed up with Virat to rescue Jharkhand from a precarious position.The 174-run stand for the fifth wicket between Kishan and Virat made sure Jharkhand breached the 300-run mark without breaking much sweat. While Virat batted patiently to his 12th first-class hundred, captain Kishan played the aggressor’s role to help Jharkhand reach a formidable total. The explosive Mumbai Indians player made a statement by completing a sublime century to fuel his India comeback debate.Following his break from domestic cricket for Jharkhand, Kishan announced his red-ball comeback with a century in the Buchi Babu tournament . However, Kishan couldn’t capitalise on the starts he got in the recently played Irani Cup.On Day 2, Jharkhand will be eager to stretch the total to maximum so that their bowlers get enough runs on board to restrict the in-form Railways batters from surpassing their first innings score.Brief scores (In Ahmedabad): Jharkhand 325/5 in 90 overs (V Singh 103 batting, I Kishan 101, N Siddiquie 96; Sangwan 4/72) vs Railways.

India vs New Zealand Test: Focus returns on India batters after high-scoring day

KALYANI: It was an agonising day-long wait for Abhimanyu Easwaran to complete a cherished century. Going by his current form, a three-figure mark seems like regulation for him, but this milestone was something special and emotional for the Dehradun born boy as he prepared to take guard in his 100th first-class match.But sadly, he was kept waiting as the first day's play of the Ranji Trophy Elite Group C match between Bengal and Bihar was called off without a ball being bowled on Friday.Bringing back memories of the abandoned Test match between Afghanistan and New Zealand in Greater Noida last month, even the toss did not happen in spite of a sunny day here at the Bengal Cricket Academy (BCA).Overnight downpour left wet patches in the outfield making the ground unfit for cricket as the umpires called off day's play at 3pm after a series of inspections.""It makes me feel special,"" Easwaran said after being felicitated by the Cricket Association of Bengal on Friday. ""It's been a long journey and I did not even realise that I had played so many FC matches,"" he stated.However, the opener remains focused on achieving his dream. ""It was good to enjoy the journey. But my aim remains the same - to play for India,"" he said.Having scored four tons in his last four FC matches, Easwaran is perhaps going through the best phase of his career with the expectation of him getting picked as the reserve opener for India's series Down Under next month is gaining strength. ""Yes I also get to hear those murmurs,"" he smiled.""It feels nice to be thought of likewise. But I always concentrate only on my next match,"" he added. Easwaran has been knocking on India's door for a long time, but is yet to get a break. ""Things happen differently for different people. So I don't brood about when my turn will come, but rather keep doing my job,"" he said.With 7638 FC runs under his belt, the 29-year-old batter is known to play big innings. ""I like to stay on the wicket and look to convert my starts,"" he explained.Easwaran felt being a member of different sides like India 'A' or 'B' has helped him gain experience.

KOLKATA: Hardly had East Bengal FC’s interim coach Bino George and Spanish midfielder Saul Crespo settled into addressing the mediapersons on Friday afternoon when the press conference room at the club tent was plunged into darkness owing to a power cut.How symbolic it might look for East Bengal a day ahead of hosting Mohun Bagan SG at the Salt Lake Stadium.The exit from the season-opening Durand Cup at the quarterfinal stage, starting the Indian Super League with four defeats on the bounce and the departure of Carles Cuadrat as head coach — indeed everything is looking as dark as a moonless night for a troubled and tortured red-and-gold side.They look like a team constrained by self-doubts, their game uninspiring and unable to get over the line.The season’s first senior derby, thus, is coming with some interesting and intriguing dynamics for both teams.East Bengal’s newly-appointed coach Oscar Bruzon is scheduled to arrive in the wee hours of Saturday and expected to sit in the dug-out.The onus will be clearly on the hosts as Bruzon might get a first-hand account of the challenge at hand and how East Bengal — having already suffered their worst start to the ISL season and desperately searching for a change in fortunes — are responding to the crisis call.George insisted on Friday that the team’s bad patch is not a confidence thing. “When I see the boys in the training ground, they all are eager to fight back,” East Bengal’s interim coach said.",East Bengal FC host Mohun Bagan SG at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday.

KATHMANDU: India made an excellent start to their SAFF Women's Championship 2024 campaign as they outclassed Pakistan 5-2 in a Group A match at the Dasharath Stadium on Thursday. The five-time champions led 4-1 at half time.While India grabbed three points with consummate ease in the opening game of the three-team group that also has Bangladesh , the match marked skipper Ashalata Devi 's 100th appearance for the Blue Tigresses and the 50th international goal of prolific striker Ngangom Bala Devi , who became the first Indian woman footballer to do so.While Grace Dangmei (2), Manisha, Bala Devi and Jyoti Chauhan scored for India, Suha Hirani and Kayla Marie Siddique found the net for Pakistan.The two traditional rivals have so far met four times in the international arena and India emerged triumphant on all occasions.With a goodly crowd present at the Dasharath Stadium to witness the clash of the arch-rivals, India wasted no time to launch an onslaught that fetched them the first goal in the fifth minute.The Pakistan defence, which had a rather difficult time to contain an overlapping Ranjana Chanu on the left, had the first test of the wing back when she sliced in to send a cross that was converted smoothly by Player of the Match Grace Dangmei with a shot from outside the box.If this was a fine strike and the result of a well-rehearsed move, then the next three goals also didn't lag behind in class and character.The second goal in the 17th minute had the signature of Bala Devi's skills written all over as the seasoned campaigner gave a through pass that had the entire Pakistan defence rattled. Manisha found the pass and beat goalkeeper Nisha Ashraf with a left-footer.Then came the moment of glory for Bala Devi. The elegant striker was spotted wiping her tears when the national anthem was played at the start of the match.In the 35th minute she banged the net off an indirect free-kick. The stamp of class the shot carried with it proved too much for the rival custodian.After Grace scored her second and India's fourth goal in the 42nd minute off another Ranjana cross, Pakistan pulled one back just before half time when India conceded a penalty. Suha Hirani's was an angular one to the top corner and Panthoi Chanu had little chance against it.India's neighbours suddenly looked rejuvenated after finding the target for the first time. They scored another through Kayla Marie Siddique immediately after the half taking full advantage of some confusion in the rival's area.As Pakistan pressed on the gas in search of more success upfront, their challenges were finally quelled with the fifth goal when substitute Jyoti Chauhan neatly heading in a Dalima Chhibber corner in the 78th minute to score her first senior India goal.",India made an excellent start to their SAFF Women's Championship 2024 campaign as they outclassed Pakistan 5-2 in a Group A match at the Dasharath Stadium on Thursday.

As Indian Super League ( ISL ) returns from the international break with NorthEast United FC hosting Chennaiyin FC at Indira Gandhi Athletic Stadium in Guwahati on Thursday, the home side will look to start afresh and comeback to winning ways.Beginning their ISL journey this season with a 1-0 away win over debutant Mohammedan Sporting Club, NEUFC have lost one and drawn two games thereafter. Sitting in sixth position on the league table, the Juan Pedro Benali-coached side will aim for a win in their fifth tie against the southern opponents, who have four points after three games.Speaking about their opponents, NorthEast head coach Juan Pedro Benali said that the Marina Machans are physically very strong.“We’re playing against a nice team, a team who has a very peculiar style. Owen Coyle ’s style, we know it. They’re a strong team, physically very strong and they don’t give you a chance to breathe. And we hope at home we can do much better than the last game and get the three points,” Benali said in Guwahati on Wednesday.Meanwhile, Chennaiyin have experienced all three results possible once each, and have undergone quite a similar fate like NEUFC after a winning start to the league. They have been on the road for two out of their first three matches this season. Speaking to the media ahead of their third away tie, head coach Owen Coyle praised NorthEast while highlighting the need for his boys to be more clinical.“What you have is two very good teams,” Coyle said on the eve of the game. “Two very attack-minded teams, going all out to win a tough game. NorthEast are always a very dangerous opponent — they were last year and they certainly are this year. I think Juan Pedro Benali has done a fantastic job.”“Equally, we know we have a good team, we know we have good players and can stand toe-to-toe with the best teams in this league when we are at our best. So that’s our focus, being very respectful of our opponents but focusing on our qualities. In truth, we should probably be sitting with 7-9 points; in the last two games alone, we had just under 40 chances, so we know we have to be more clinical,” Coyle added.Due to heavy rainfall in Chennai, the Marina Machans had to travel to Guwahati pretty early to resume training. Expressing his gratitude to the Highlanders for opening their facilities early, the Scottish coach wished for the safety of the people back home.“We haven’t been able to train for the last three days because of the severe weather in Chennai.

Thomas Tuchel was named England's new manager on Wednesday, with the German set to start in the role from January 1, 2025.The 51-year-old, who has been out of work since leaving Bayern Munich at the end of last season, succeeds Englishman Gareth Southgate as permanent coach and becomes the third foreign manager of the Three Lions after Sven-Goran Eriksson and Fabio Capello.A former coach of Chelsea , Borussia Dortmund, Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich, Tuchel has the trophy-winning pedigree that the FA is seeking to help end a 58-year wait to win a major tournament.However, the move has drawn criticism over the FA's unwillingness to trust an Englishman with its top job.Tuchel will be assisted by English coach Anthony Barry, who worked alongside him at Bayern Munich.""I am very proud to have been given the honour of leading the England team,"" Tuchel said in a FA statement.""I have long felt a personal connection to the game in this country, and it has given me some incredible moments already. To have the chance to represent England is a huge privilege, and the opportunity to work with this special and talented group of players is very exciting.""Tuchel won league titles at PSG and Bayern and the German Cup with Dortmund, but his greatest success came during his time in English football at Chelsea.He led the Blues to Champions League glory just months after taking charge in 2021 and also won the UEFA Super Cup and Club World Cup with the London club.Tuchel was sacked in September 2022 in a bold early move by Chelsea's new ownership group that did not pay off.He becomes the permanent successor to Southgate, who led the Three Lions to back-to-back finals of the European Championship, plus a World Cup semi-final and quarter-final in his four major tournaments in charge.England, though, are still yet to win a major men's tournament since the 1966 World Cup on home soil.""We are thrilled to have hired Thomas Tuchel, one of the best coaches in the world,"" said FA CEO Mark Bullingham.""Since Gareth resigned, we have worked through the candidate pool, meeting a number of coaches and evaluating them against that criteria.""Thomas was very impressive and stood out with his vast expertise and his drive.""Tuchel will inherit a richly talented generation of players, including Harry Kane, Jude Bellingham and Cole Palmer, that will be among the favourites for the 2026 World Cup .","Thomas Tuchel named England's new manager on Wednesday.

Scotland frustrated Cristiano Ronaldo 's Portugal in a 0-0 draw at Hampden on Tuesday to avoid losing five consecutive competitive games for the first time ever.The home side needed a wonder save from Craig Gordon to deny Bruno Fernandes a winner in the closing stages, but held out to secure their first point in the top tier of the Nations League .Portugal remain on top of Group A1 but were made to wait to book their place in March's quarter-finals.On his 216th international appearance, Ronaldo made his 200th start for his country, more than 21 years on from his first.However, the 39-year-old failed to add to his 133 Portugal goals and stormed off the field at full-time ranting at the officials.Scotland have won just one of their last 16 games - a 2-0 friendly victory over Gibraltar in June - and remain without a victory in a competitive match for over a year.But Steve Clarke 's men battled hard to stop the rot in Glasgow.Scotland even had the best chance of the first half inside the opening five minutes whenScott McTominay headed too close to Diogo Costa from point-blank range.Portugal quickly took control of possession without creating clear-cut chances.Francisco Conceicao spooned over early in the second period from Ronaldo 's lay-off.Ronaldo then fired inches wide after making himself room for a shot amid a flurry of desperate challenges from Scottish defenders.But it was Fernandes who had the best chance to claim all three points when the Manchester United captain's powerful low strike was brilliantly parried by Gordon and collected at the second attempt by the 41-year-old goalkeeper.Scotland are still on course for relegation from the top tier of the Nations League as they trail Poland, who drew 3-3 with Croatia, by three points with two games remaining.Croatia sit second, three points behind the Portuguese, who they host next month.","Portugal remain on top of Group A1 but were made to wait to book their place in March's quarter-finals.

Every kid watches cartoons, right? But I didn’t watch cartoons. I just used to watch sports, tennis specially.“So, my parents were like, ‘she likes it.We have to put her on to that’. So my uncle, he knows tennis coaches. But when I started at the age of 3, the coach was like ‘no, she’s small. She can’t play, she cannot understand anything'.“But I was happy to play tennis, and I was interested in playing tennis.”That was a decade ago, in Mendhasala in Odisha Now 14, not a grown-up yet, Aahan announced her arrival on the big stage by claiming a double crown, the Under-14 and Under-16 girls’ singles titles at the Fenesta Open National championships in New Delhi last week.It gets ever more incredible when you consider that she entered the Under-16 event as a qualifier and went all the way. Besides, she also played doubles in U-16, losing in the second round though.In the U-16 final, Aahan beat Aishwarya Jadhav , the eighth seeded Maharashra girl against whom she has a 1-1 head to head in the ITF juniors circuit. Aishwarya, two years older than the Odisha girl, had won her first juniors title in a Grade 5 tournament in Ahmedabad recently.“I’m happy, but it was very tough,” Aahan, who is currently coached by Santosh Malik, said.“Each and every round was tough. But I was just focused on each and every point. Like, I want to win this point, and next point, like that. So I was fully focused and my target was (to) win both the tournaments.So, I tried my best and the rest is the result (two titles).”Aahan’s first coach was Ajay Nishank, under whose tutelage she was until a year ago when she started working with Malik. She also has access to the Abhinav Bindra Targeting Performance (ABTP) centre in Bhubaneswar, where she is one of the athletes from various disciplines who get free fitness training under a programme by the Odisha state government ’s department of sports.She, along with Tavish Pahwa, was a part of the Asian junior team that was picked for an European exposure trip under the Grand Slam Player Development Programme of the ITF earlier this year.“In Europe, it was tough matches and I was a little bit nervous. But when I started winning matches, then I started to feel confident, like ‘yeah, I can beat them’,” she said.Aahan, while brimming with confidence and optimism, is also aware which areas of her game she has to improve.“I have to improve my serve and forehand. And a little bit in volleys,” she said.“I’m good in volleys. When I play doubles, I do good volleys. But in singles I have to do better because, you know, in singles that is tough. You have to cover the full court.“Like, if the opponent is giving you a lob, you have to cover that. You have to be confident, ‘yeah, I can do this. So I’ll go (up) front’.”For a youngster of her age, Aahan has remarkable clarity of what her long terms goals are and how to get there.“Yeah, in ITF, I want to be in top 100, so I can play the WTA (Tour events). In juniors, if I get in top 100, I’ll get a chance to play junior slams like the Australia open or US Open Junior slam.“Then, I can learn and work more on that thing, and then I’ll collect the points in ITF. Then I can play the Slams.”","Aahan won the Under-14 and Under-16 girls’ singles titles at the Fenesta Open National championships in New Delhi last week.

SEMI LOOMS

SHANGHAI: Former world number one Novak Djokovic , the last surviving member of tennis' ""Big Four"", said he does not plan on stopping any time soon but admitted that the retirement of rivals Roger Federer Andy Murray and Rafael Nadal has been overwhelming.Djokovic, Federer, Nadal and Murray were dubbed the ""Big Four"" during a period of dominance when they won a combined 69 Grand Slam titles and were involved in some of the most memorable matches of the last two decades.Spain's Nadal, who won a record 14 French Open titles, announced on Thursday that he would call time on his career after next month's Davis Cup. Murray retired after this year's Paris Olympics and Federer bowed out in 2022.Speaking after beating Czech Jakub Mensik in the Shanghai Masters quarter-finals on Friday, Djokovic said: ""(Nadal) has been my greatest rival. The rivalry I had with him has impacted me the most in my career by far.""We knew that that moment is coming sooner than later, but it's still a shock, you know.""Roger a few years ago, when he announced retirement and Andy as well this year. I mean, it's a bit overwhelming for me to be honest. I don't know what to make out of it. I still enjoy competing. But part of me left with them, a big part of me.""In his 6-7 (4), 6-1, 6-4 win over Mensik, who was born over a year after Djokovic played his first match on the ATP Tour in 2004, the Serb was pushed hard but fought back to clinch the win.It ensured his progression to a record-extending 78th ATP Masters 1000 semi-final - two more than Nadal.""These kind of matches, against teenagers, it's something that really motivates me,"" Djokovic told reporters after the win.""It keeps me going, and pushes me to really dig deep, and to show to the world that I still got it in my legs, that I can still go the distance with the young guys.""I'm super glad that I managed to win this very challenging match.""Djokovic faces world number seven Taylor Fritz in the semi-finals on Saturday after the American defeated Belgian David Goffin 6-3 6-4 earlier on Friday.""I'm going to have a big server opponent tomorrow, Fritz, so I have to be ready for another difficult match,"" the 24-times Grand Slam champion said.""Quick conditions, if you serve well it's quite a big advantage.""We are entering the last couple of matches of the tournament, and now is the time for me to really try to step it up even more, and hopefully I can get a chance to be in the finals.""","Novak Djokovic says the retirement of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal has been overwhelming.

TOI takes a look at the best five from both these famous rivalries:Federer was the undisputed king and even though he had lost to Rafa the previous year, the Swiss was just unstoppable at that point.Nadal had won the first two sets and was well on course to stopping Federer from winning his first Sunshine Double, but the experience of the Swiss helped him win 2-6, 6-7, 7-6, 6-3, 6-1.Rafa had beaten Federer in the 2005 French Open semifinal, but the rivalry on clay hadn't been settled yet. The Rome final was the first of the clay swing that year and if Federer had won this match, the head-to head on this surface might not have looked as lop-sided. Federer had two match-points in the fifth set Nadal prevailed 6-7, 7-6, 6-4, 2-6, 7-6.Rafa's autobiography starts with how he was feeling when there was a rain-break in this final during the fifth set. The Spaniard had lost the earlier two Wimbledon finals to his greatest adversary and when he went two sets up. Federer then played some of his best tennis to win the next two in tie-breakers. The rain breaks, the fading light - everything added to the drama, till Rafa held after breaking Federer in the 15th game of the fifth set to win 6-4, 6-4, 6-7 , 6-7 , 9-7.Though Nadal had won the Wimbledon final the year before, the popular mandate was Federer was the better player on faster courts. This was the first time they were playing in a Grand Slam outside Roland Garros and SW19, and the stakes were massive. In a match that went to and fro, Nadal prevailed 7-5, 3-6, 7-6, 3-6, 6-2. The loss left Federer in tears and as he cried, it was Rafa who consoled him on the podium.Both were coming back after massive injuries and it was a surprise that the two made the final. Federer attacked like never before using his single-handed backhand as an explosive weapon. But Rafa weathered the storm and was up a break in the fifth set. The last four games of that match was probably the best Federer had ever played while trailing against Nadal. He eventually won 6-4, 3-6, 6-1, 3-6, 6-3.Nadal was trying to emulate Federer and a select few in the history of men's tennis to win all four Majors. Djokovic, around that time, was establishing himself as the best player on hard courts. But Nadal was just in a league of his own that year after winning his second Wimbledon title and went on to beat Novak 6-4, 5-7, 6-4, 6-2 and make a place for himself in history.Five hours, 53 minutes - it went on for that long and by the end of it, the two struggled to stand on their feet in the humidity of Melbourne during the prize distribution ceremony. The fortunes fluctuated, but Novak stood strong. Nadal led 4-2 in the fifth but Novak's resilience came through in a 5-7, 6-4, 6-2, 6-7(5), 7-5 win.Many call it the greatest clay court match of the new millennium. Novak was desperate to break his Roland Garros jinx but Rafa was just being Rafa.
