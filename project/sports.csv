"Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma should visit Pakistan before retirement, says Kamran Akmal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/virat-kohli-and-rohit-sharma-should-visit-pakistan-before-retirement-says-kamran-akmal/articleshow/112859675.cms,"NEW DELHI: India's batting icons Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma are two of the most celebrated cricketers of the modern era. Known for their match-winning performances and ability to change the course of a game, both have a massive fan-following worldwide, including in Pakistan despite not playing even a single international match in the country.Pakistan remains an absentee when it comes to countries where Virat and Rohit have entertained fans with their batting.However, Virat did visit Pakistan once during his Under-19 days, but has never played there with the senior team.Former Pakistan wicketkeeper-batsman Kamran Akmal feels that Virat and Rohit, who have already big adieu to T20Is, should visit Pakistan before retiring from international cricket.After India’s triumph in the T20 World Cup earlier this year, the Indian batting duo decided to quit the format in the international arena.""Virat and Rohit should visit Pakistan before they retire,"" Akmal said while talking to TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview. ""These two are stars of world cricket, traveling across the globe to play the game. Every single fan loves them. They have a massive fan base due to their batting and match-winning performances.""""The fan following they will experience in Pakistan will surpass anything they’ve seen elsewhere.""The last series between India and Pakistan took place in 2012-13. Since then, the two teams have only clashed in multination tournaments like the Asia Cup and ICC events. The absence of regular bilateral series has left fans longing for the resumption of the thrilling India vs Pakistan contests.""Virat is a role model for many around the world, Rohit is the World Cup-winning captain, and Bumrah is currently the best pacer in the world. When players like Virat, Rohit and Bumrah visit Pakistan, it will evoke unique feelings in every fan. Virat has been to Pakistan during his under-19 days, but he wasn’t as popular then,"" Akmal said.""If Virat visits Pakistan now, he will truly see his popularity here. He will receive a different kind of support in Pakistan. No cricketer is more popular than Virat in Pakistan; he has a bigger fan-following than any other cricketer in the world. Pakistani fans love Virat, Rohit and Bumrah more than any of their own cricket team players,"" the former wicketkeeper said.Virat and Rohit will be back in action in the upcoming two-match Test series against Bangladesh.The first Test will begin on September 19 in Chennai, followed by the second Test at Green Park in Kanpur from September 27.","Former Pakistan wicketkeeper-batsman Kamran Akmal feels that Virat and Rohit should visit Pakistan before retiring from international cricket.

'Umran Malik is a classic case': Former India bowling coach on why the fast bowler faded away,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/umran-malik-is-a-classic-case-former-india-bowling-coach-on-why-the-fast-bowler-faded-away/articleshow/112881313.cms,"NEW DELHI: Young fast bowler Umran Malik rose to fame with a remarkable IPL season for Sunrisers Hyderabad in 2022, thanks to his blistering pace and ability to consistently bowl over 150 km/h. His performances earned him a spot in the Indian white-ball squad , where he played 10 ODIs and 8 T20Is, taking 24 wickets within just over a year.Despite this early promise, Malik has not featured for India in more than a year, raising questions about the decline of the once-promising fast bowler.Former India bowling coach Paras Mhambrey believes that Malik's rapid rise without substantial red-ball cricket experience is a significant factor in his current predicament.According to Mhambrey, Malik's swift ascent to the national team via the IPL is typical of a bowler who lacks the grounding that comes from playing longer formats. With only 12 First-Class matches under his belt, Malik has struggled to maintain his place in the national lineup.""Umran is a classic case of someone who has not played enough red-ball cricket,"" Mhambrey told The Indian Express. ""He came into reckoning through the IPL. That's 24 balls in a game. Sometimes you don't even get to bowl 24 balls. The amount of pressure in bowling 24 balls is not like the red ball. I feel this (T20) is not a format to judge a prospect.""Mhambrey emphasizes the importance of First-Class cricket for developing a bowler's skills and endurance. He explains that while the IPL offers a platform for showcasing talent, it doesn't replicate the mental and physical demands of longer formats.""For all the perks that come with bowling in the IPL, it has its repercussions as well,"" Mhambrey continued. ""We made sure that he played Ranji Trophy and red-ball cricket. The moment you play one season, you understand your bowling. Physically, you will be tested in different phases of the game. Sometimes you will have to be on the ground for six sessions. And to be able to bowl with that intensity when the last session is coming up, you will be physically and mentally challenged. And you need to go through that.""Mhambrey's insights highlight a crucial element in Umran Malik's development: the need for experience and endurance that comes only from playing red-ball cricket. Without this foundation, Malik has found it challenging to adjust to the rigors of international cricket, leading to his exclusion from the team.",Former India bowling coach Paras Mhambrey believes Umran Malik's rapid rise to the national team is due to a lack of red-ball cricket experience. Malik rose to fame with a remarkable IPL season for Sunrisers Hyderabad in 2022. He has not featured for India in more than a year.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112881328,imgsize-27888,width-400,resizemode-4/112881328.jpg"
Shakib Al Hasan to continue playing for Bangladesh amid legal proceedings,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/shakib-al-hasan-to-continue-playing-for-bangladesh-amid-legal-proceedings/articleshow/112852627.cms,"Top Picks For You Bangladesh cricket team stands by Shakib Al Hasan amid murder allegation

NEW DELHI: The Bangladesh Cricket Board ( BCB ) announced that Shakib Al Hasan , the veteran all-rounder, will continue to play and represent Bangladesh until proven guilty, despite his involvement in a First Information Report ( FIR ) related to a murder case amid recent unrest. This decision comes following a legal notice demanding his immediate removal from all forms of cricket.Initially, BCB officials had suggested that a decision regarding Shakib's future participation would be made after the opening Test against Pakistan in Rawalpindi.However, the situation escalated legally when Shajib Mahmood Alam , a lawyer from the Supreme Court, on behalf of Advocate Md Rafinur Rahman, sent a legal notice to the BCB.The notice demanded Shakib’s immediate removal from cricket, stating that according to the rules of the International Cricket Council (ICC), a player named in a legal case should not remain part of the national team. It also called for Shakib to aid in the investigation and urged the BCB to inform the ICC about the situation.BCB president Faruque Ahmed confirmed Shakib’s continuation in the interview with Bengali daily Prothom Alo. He stated, ""He [Shakib] will continue playing. We received a legal notice regarding bringing him back, and we replied to them saying this.""Ahmed explained that since the FIR is in its initial stages and no guilt has been proven, Shakib will remain with the team. He added, ""The Bangladesh team will go to India after the Pakistan series, and we want him in that series as well. He is our contracted player, and if necessary, we will provide him with legal assistance.""Despite his legal situation, Shakib is set to meet his international and domestic commitments. He won't return to Bangladesh with the team after the Test series against Pakistan as he is scheduled to play a four-day match for Surrey in England. The BCB has granted him a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from September 5 to 14 to participate in the County game against Somerset.A BCB official confirmed Shakib’s participation to Cricbuzz, saying, ""He [Shakib] has not played red-ball cricket for a while, and that is why we have given him an NOC to play for Surrey, as it will help him adjust to red-ball cricket more than anything else."" The match between Surrey and Somerset is scheduled from September 9 to 12. Following his stint in county cricket, Shakib is set to rejoin the national squad in India, where Bangladesh is scheduled to play two Tests and three T20Is starting September 19.As legal proceedings continue, the BCB’s stance underscores a commitment to due process while remaining focused on upcoming international fixtures.",Shakib Al Hasan will continue to play and represent Bangladesh until proven guilty.

'Pakistan titar-bitar ho gayi' - Ramiz Raza tears apart Shan Masood-led team after Bangladesh defeat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/pakistan-titar-bitar-ho-gayi-ramiz-raza-tears-apart-shan-masood-led-team-after-bangladesh-defeat/articleshow/112858520.cms,"Going in to bat on the fifth day of the first Test against Bangladesh after conceding a 117-run lead in the first innings, Pakistan had all ten wickets in hand. It made the draw the most likely of the three results. But much to the disappointment of Pakistan fans, the home team surrendered tamely and was bowled out for just 146, leaving the visitors only 30 runs for a historic win.Pakistan lost the match, their first Test defeat against Bangladesh, by 10 wickets.""If there is one team that can snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, it's Pakistan. And it has become the team's reputation,"" said former Pakistan captain Ramiz Raja on his YoutTube channel 'Ramiz Speaks'.Bangladesh, led by veteran Mushfiqur Rahim's 191-run knock, piled up 565 runs in response to Pakistan's first-innings total of 448 for 6 to take a sizable lead. The home team's batting line-up then had to negotiate a few overs on day four, which they did safely, and bat through day five to draw the match.But they failed miserably, with spinners Mehidy Hasan Miraz (4 for 21) and Shakib Al Hasan (3 for 44) putting the Pakistan batting in disarray.""Ye pehli dafa nahi hua ke on fifth day of a Test match, Pakistan titar bitar ho gayi, parkhache ud gaye (it's not the first time that the Pakistan team fell apart and was in tatters on the fifth day of a Test match),"" Ramiz said. ""Sometimes batting flops, sometimes bowlers perform poorly at crucial junctures.""The 1992 World Cup winner went on cite an example form the 2018 Test against New Zealand in the UAE in similar conditions (as Rawalpindi ), where Pakistan had to score 175 runs to win on the fourth day but were bowled out for 171 and lost by four runs despite taking a lead of around 90 runs in the first innings.""Ajeeb-o-garib story ban jati hai jaise hi pressure padta hai iss team me (the script takes a baffling turn whenever this team is put under pressure).

For the first time, we (Pakistan) didn’t make it to the top four in the World Cup or the top eight in T20. And yesterday, we faced an embarrassing defeat against Bangladesh, setting a new low. Just two-and-a-half years ago, this team had defeated India by 10 wickets. What has happened in these two-and-a-half years that we lost to Bangladesh by 10 wickets? The blame for all of this collapse falls on one institution,"" wrote Khan.The former Prime Minister further pointed to Pakistan's recent struggles in international tournaments, including failing to reach the semi-finals of the 2023 Cricket World Cup and exiting the 2024 T20 World Cup in the Super 12 stage.He directly linked these failures to the PCB's management, placing the blame squarely on the institution.This recent loss to Bangladesh extends Pakistan's winless streak in Test matches on home soil to nine matches.

Sri Lanka captain Dhananjaya de Silva eyes Test Championship points against England,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/sri-lanka-captain-dhananjaya-de-silva-eyes-test-championship-points-against-england/articleshow/112874851.cms,"Nissanka and Kumara recalled

Sri Lanka team for second Test:

NEW DELHI: Sri Lanka Dhananjaya de Silva is optimistic about his team's chances of improving their position in the World Test Championship ( WTC ) standings. The upcoming Test match at Lord's presents an opportunity for Sri Lanka to secure their first-ever victory in the five-day format at the iconic venue.Despite a valiant effort in the first Test at Old Trafford, Sri Lanka suffered a narrow five-wicket defeat.To keep their hopes alive in the three-match series, the tourists must emerge victorious at Lord's, a ground where they have drawn six and lost two of their eight previous encounters.A win would level the series at 1-1, setting the stage for a decisive final Test at the Oval next month.De Silva is mindful of Sri Lanka's current standing in the WTC table, where they occupy the fifth position, just below England. A strong performance in the remaining matches could potentially propel them higher in the rankings.""It is all about getting a Test win,"" he told a pre-match press conference at Lord's on Wednesday, as quoted by AFP. ""It will mean a lot for the country. But more importantly we need to get points in the World Test Championship.""We are more confident heading into this game. We were confident at Old Trafford as well but we failed to deliver. We have to be clear with our plans and execute them well.""Sri Lanka have altered their lineup with a pair of modifications.Pathum Nissanka, who has thrived in ODIs this year but hasn't featured in a Test since 2022, takes the place of Kusal Mendis in the upper order. Meanwhile, right-arm fast bowler Lahiru Kumara has been brought in to replace left-arm seamer Vishwa Fernando.""Overall, Pathum is the best batter in the country at the moment,"" said De Silva. ""He has a good mindset and he has a good technique.""Dinesh Chandimal, who scored a resilient 79 in the second innings at Old Trafford, has been included in the squad despite a painful thumb injury sustained while batting against fast bowler Mark Wood. However, he may not take up wicketkeeping duties, with Nishan Madushka on standby to step in behind the stumps.England will be missing the injured Wood for the Lord's Test, but De Silva noted that new-ball specialist Chris Woakes has been a more challenging opponent for Sri Lanka's batsmen.""I am not concerned about the speed,"" the 32-year-old middle-order batsman explained. ""Speed is not troubling us. It is the line and length that's troubling us. Chris Woakes is able to bowl 20 to 30 balls at one area and that's what is troubling us.""One Sri Lanka batsman arriving at Lord's in top form is Kamindu Mendis.The left-hander notched his third century in just four Tests with a brilliant 113 at Old Trafford, giving him an impressive average of 92.16 as he prepares to fulfill a childhood dream by playing at Lord's.""It was a dream to play at Lord's when I was a boy,"" said the 25-year-old Mendis. ""I'm excited to play here.""Dimuth Karunaratne, Nishan Madushka (wkt), Pathum Nissanka, Angelo Mathews, Dinesh Chandimal, Dhananjaya De Silva (capt), Kamindu Mendis, Prabath Jayasuriya, Asitha Fernando, Lahiru Kumara, Milan Rathnayake","Sri Lanka captain Dhananjaya de Silva is optimistic about his team's chances of improving their position in the World Test Championship standings.

And I'm not looking too far into the future because sometimes you can get stuck in thinking about what's going to happen. I've had scored a lot of runs in the last one year in all formats. I've just been trying to continue doing what I've been doing the last one year on every given opportunity…taking every opportunity as a new day,"" Karun said, as quoted by PTI.Seven years have passed since Nair last represented India, but recent performances suggest a resurgence. His time with Vidarbha in domestic cricket and Northamptonshire in English county cricket has yielded promising results.Nair's stint with Northamptonshire proved particularly fruitful.In 2023, he amassed 249 runs in three matches at an impressive average of 83, including a century against eventual champions Surrey. This year, he continued his solid form, accumulating 487 runs in seven matches at an average of 49, highlighted by another century against Glamorgan.While not astronomical figures, these consistent performances have instilled a renewed sense of confidence in the batsman.Beyond the runs, Nair opened up on the invaluable experience gained from playing in English conditions, adding, ""You are playing with a different ball there – literally. Everyone knows for Indian batsmen to go and score runs in England…to play the moving ball is tough. So, I've learnt a lot more about myself as a batsman and finding ways to score runs and believing in yourself. There are so many things that I've learnt in England that, you know, maybe I had it in me but I didn't realise all this while.""The move to Vidarbha from Karnataka for the last domestic season proved another turning point. Frustrated by limited opportunities in his home state, Nair found a welcoming environment in Vidarbha. He responded with 690 runs in 10 matches, including two centuries, playing a pivotal role in their journey to the Ranji Trophy semifinals.While a return to the Indian team remains a driving force, Nair intends to achieve immediate goals, noting, ""Yes, of course. Everyone plays this game to go out there and represent your country and that's my only aim now -- to play Test cricket again, which I think, I'm very confident that I can. I know that I'm good enough.""Nevertheless, he is focused on leading the Mysore Warriors to victory in the ongoing KSCA Maharaja T20 tournament . ""We've crossed the first step, that is to qualify for the semis, which is something that we set out to do when we started the tournament,"" he concluded.",Seven years have passed since Karun Nair last represented India.

NEW DELHI: Royal Challengers Bengaluru spinner Karn Sharma recently shared insights on former skipper Virat Kohli ’s leadership during a conversation on Manjot Kalra’s YouTube channel.Reflecting on his Test debut against Australia in Adelaide in 2014, Karn, now 36, highlighted how Kohli's approach as captain left an indelible mark on the team.Kohli, who took over the captaincy from MS Dhoni in the middle of the Test series, immediately set the tone with an aggressive mindset that would come to define his tenure.“Making my Test debut against Australia in Australia will always remain special. Very few people get that type of start. The dressing room atmosphere was quite good. Ravi Shastri, the coach, was there. We were chasing over 300 runs in that match and Virat said 'no draw. We are going to chase it down.' That injected a lot of positivity among players in the dressing room,” Karn recalled, emphasizing the fearless attitude Kohli brought to the team.The leggie noted that this bold approach was a departure from the norm and something that left a lasting impression on the players.“It was a different approach. Different captains have different approaches, but ever since he said we are chasing over 300 in the fourth innings of a Test – which was very tough in Australian conditions – it sent a wonderful indication to the players in the dressing room that your captain has different plans,"" he added.This moment, Sharma believes, encapsulated Kohli's unyielding spirit, a trait that has become synonymous with his leadership. Despite the challenges, Kohli's demeanour never wavered, even when the runs didn’t come easily.“He didn't get runs, but to be honest, it never looked as if he was out of form. He always gave that impression that everything is fine.

I will make sure that the process, that is required for each individual to express themselves fully to bring a lot of victories to the franchise, is in place.""I will be closely looking at the decision-making for LSG to go to the next level. Hopefully this season is going to be the special one and the beginning of something very, very special for this franchise,"" Zaheer added.At Mumbai Indians, Zaheer held the position of director of cricket before transitioning to head of global development.Currently, LSG lacks a bowling coach following the departure of South African fast bowler Morne Morkel, who has joined Gambhir's coaching staff with the Indian team.""Do you need a bowling coach when I'm here? I will do everything that the team needs,"" Zaheer said.According to reports, Zaheer will take on additional responsibilities during the off-season, including scouting and contributing to the player development program.Prior to his coaching career, Zaheer represented three IPL franchises: Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bengaluru, and Delhi Daredevils.Over 10 seasons, Zaheer appeared in 100 matches for these teams, claiming 102 wickets at an economy rate of 7.58.Zaheer's last appearance in the IPL came in 2017 when he led the Delhi Daredevils as their captain. Following that season, he announced his retirement from all forms of cricket.Sanjiv Goenka, the owner of the LSG team, praised Zaheer's relentless pursuit of excellence and his unwavering determination to succeed.""His ability to keep winning, keep having this strong hunger for success is something that attracted me towards getting him as part of the LSG franchise,"" Goenka said.""A couple of weeks ago, I realised that he was not with not any cricketing franchise, so I called him up, we spoke, we agreed and he is here.""So, it's as short and as quick as it gets. We are very excited to have him on board. We do believe he will do wonders for future of LSG,"" he added.Asked about the fitness of pace sensation Mayak Yadav, Goenka said: ""He's with NCA, it's not for me to comment on his fitness. He is a hardworking guy and wants to improve and become a good cricketer in franchise cricket and for Team India.""When asked whether they would like to retain Mayank, Goenka said: ""Not only Mayank, we hope all good players play for LSG.""Former Australian opener Justin Langer, who replaced Andy Flower as the team's head coach last year, will continue in his role, supported by his deputies Lance Klusener and Adam Voges, along with fielding coach Jonty Rhodes.","Former Indian fast bowler Zaheer Khan has taken on the position of team mentor for the Lucknow Super Giants.

Novak Djokovic chases new high at US Open,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/us-open/novak-djokovic-chases-new-high-at-us-open/articleshow/112852857.cms,"Novak Djokovic is tennis ’ champion mountaineer. The peaks call out to him, and the Serb cannot help himself; knee taped, and batteries recharged, he pushes one more time. Every time.The 37-year-old, who practically raced out of knee surgery to make the Wimbledon final five weeks later, clinched gold at the Paris Olympics, outplaying Carlos Alcaraz in a match that was all about mental acuity.Djokovic is in New York now, looking for a 25th major title that would take him past Margaret Court and also give him a 100th career crown.Djokovic, returning to hard courts after five months, played Moldova’s Radu Albot in the US Open first round. It wasn’t his best serving day. He had 10 double faults and clocked only 47% of first serves, but the second seed was still good enough to go through 6-2, 6-2, 6-4 and set up a second-round meeting with compatriot Laslo Djere on Wednesday.Djokovic trailed Djere by two sets in the third round of the US Open last year before turning it round.“Djere likes playing on the big stage,” Djokovic said of his 29-year-old opponent, ranked 109 in the world. “He also loves the conditions here. It’s a bit quicker, the ball stays low. He has a flat backhand, very good serve, great return. I remember very well our match (from last year). It was a very tough match. I’m going to try to analyze that and hopefully do some things even better than I did last year.”The good news is that the right knee is doing fine. Djokovic demonstrated that against Albot, covering the court, stretching, sliding, and painting the lines. He moved the Moldovan around, forcing him to make that extra step, reach a little wider and swing a little harder.Djokovic, whose record-collecting run should be part of academic curriculum, became the oldest US Open champion in the Open Era when he claimed his fourth crown last year.“I’ve been around for quite a few years, (around) different generations of players,” Djokovic said. “The kind of rivalries I have with Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, in particular, and other guys from the generation before — Alexander Zverev, Daniil Medvedev and Stefanos Tsitsipas — are the kind of matchups that inspire me on a weekly basis, (it) pushes me to be able to run for hours with them on the biggest stage.”“There is a big age difference, but that’s still not affecting me in a big way,” he said. “I feel good about myself, about my game, about where I am and what I have achieved in the last several years.”Djokovic, who along with fellow pro Canada’s Vasek Pospisil, announced the creation of the Professional Tennis Players Association on the eve of the 2020 US Open, gains inspiration from off-court ventures too.“I have a lot of things off the court that still run my juices. I love being part of the tennis story, PTPA is also something that motivates me. I have been working on this for many years, even before it was founded. I feel like it’s my responsibility being somebody who has a name and a status in the sport,” he added.“A lot of players look up to me, Federer and Nadal. They look for guidance and they hope to get into leadership roles, as well.”The words of the great mountaineer Edmund Hillary must resonate with the all-conquering Djokovic: ‘It’s not the mountain we conquer, but ourselves’. It was never truer for the Serb than in that golden moment in Paris 2024.",Novak Djokovic beats Radu Albot in straight sets in US Open first round. Second seed will play compatriot Laslo Djere in second round on Wednesday.
