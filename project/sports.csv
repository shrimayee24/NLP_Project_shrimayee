Money in the Bank is regarded as one of the most prestigious events, where superstars compete for the prestigious briefcase. This is no ordinary briefcase; it has the potential to transform the life of the superstar who possesses it. Winning it grants the holder the opportunity to challenge any champion of their choice at any time.This year's Money in the Bank event is scheduled for Saturday, July 6, 2024, at the Scotiabank Arena in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The qualifying tournament for the Money in the Bank ladder match has already begun. With plenty of time left before the tournament and the main event, let's take a look at some of the best superstars who have won the Money in the Bank match.The first match took place in 2005 at WrestleMania 21, where the winner was none other than the Rated R Superstar, Edge. After claiming the briefcase, he cashed it in against John Cena at New Year's Revolution 2006. In this WWE Championship match, Edge delivered a vicious spear right after the bell rang, securing victory and winning the WWE title.Additionally, he won another Money in the Bank contract from Mr. Kennedy, who had initially earned it at WrestleMania 23. Edge then defeated the Undertaker with a spear to win the World Heavyweight Championship for the first time, becoming the first person to hold the Money in the Bank contract twice.Another superstar who has won the MITB briefcase twice is CM Punk. He first competed in the MITB ladder match at WrestleMania 24 in 2008. Following his victory, he used the briefcase to cash in against Edge, becoming the new World Heavyweight Champion. Later that year, he competed in another MITB match and won the briefcase for a second time. His second MITB victory initiated one of WWE's greatest rivalries against Jeff Hardy. CM Punk cashed in his second briefcase on Jeff Hardy at Extreme Rules 2009, again becoming the World Champion.Although the crowd has always cheered for the MITB winner and their cash-ins, the response was especially tremendous when Dolph Ziggler won and cashed in the briefcase. He won the briefcase at the 2012 Money in the Bank pay-per-view on July 15.Not only did he win the briefcase, but he also became the first-ever MITB holder to successfully defend his contract against Chris Jericho and John Cena. On the April 8, 2013, episode of Raw, Ziggler cashed in his contract on World Heavyweight Champion Alberto Del Rio, following Del Rio's handicap match victory over Jack Swagger and Zeb Colter. Ziggler defeated Del Rio to win his second World Heavyweight Championship after holding the briefcase for nearly nine months.Randy Orton emerged victorious in the 2013 Money in the Bank match, defeating six other competitors. On August 18, at the 2013 SummerSlam event, Orton cashed in his contract on WWE Champion Daniel Bryan. Bryan had just defeated John Cena to claim the championship. Orton won his seventh WWE Championship by defeating Bryan, thanks to WWE COO Triple H, who served as the special guest referee for the Bryan-Cena match and attacked Bryan with a Pedigree. This occurred five weeks after Orton secured the briefcase.Seth Rollins is the first to cash in the Money in the Bank (MITB) contract at WrestleMania. He won the briefcase at the 2014 Money in the Bank pay-per-view on June 29. During WrestleMania 31, Brock Lesnar and Roman Reigns competed for the WWE World Championship. Rollins cashed in his briefcase during the main event, transforming the singles match into a triple threat. He then pinned Reigns after a Curb Stomp to capture the WWE World Heavyweight Championship.","WWE Money in the Bank Ladder Match will take place on July 6, 2024, at the Scotiabank Arena in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

Five probable reasons why Drew McIntyre quit WWE RAW,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/wwe/top-stories/five-probable-reasons-why-drew-mcintyre-quit-wwe-raw/articleshow/111087501.cms,"Here are the 5 reasons why Drew McIntyre quit

WWE RAW

1) The Game is on

2) World Title rematch

3) Match against CM Punk

4) Triple threat match at Summer Slam

5) He wants a break

Time doesn't seem to be on Drew McIntyre 's side, as he lost the World Heavyweight title match at Cash at the Castle. He was on the brink of victory, nearly securing the win after landing a devastating Claymore Kick on Damian. However, CM Punk , acting as the referee, interrupted the count at two, stopping short of the final count. This allowed Damian to take advantage of the situation and retain the title. The incident left Drew furious, and on the latest episode of RAW, The Scottish Warrior announced he was quitting WWE.Since Wrestlemania 40, fans have watched CM Punk engage in psychological warfare against Drew McIntyre, even causing Drew to lose his World Title multiple times. Given the events at Clash at the Castle, it's clear Drew is planning a significant retaliation against Punk. This could be why he announced a fake resignation on WWE RAW. The Scottish Warrior may have begun his own mind games to confuse CM Punk, and when the moment is right, he will strike. Drew won't let Punk off easily; saying ""I Quit"" is just the beginning of his plan to fight back.Seth Rollins made a dramatic return on the latest episode of RAW and has been granted a World Title opportunity at Money in the Bank. Seth has bravely accepted Damian’s challenge, setting the stage for an epic showdown for the World Championship. However, there's speculation that Drew could intervene, potentially causing chaos that might lead to Seth winning the match against Damian by disqualification, allowing Damian to retain his title.Drew, fueled by his recent losses to Damian at Wrestlemania 40 and Clash at the Castle, blames CM Punk for his defeats and feels he hasn't had a fair chance to prove himself. Drew's anger seems to be driving him to consider unfair tactics against Damian, Seth, CM Punk, or anyone else who stands in his way of the World Title.With Money in the Bank now set to showcase a World Title clash between Damian and Seth, fans are wondering whether Drew and CM Punk will square off one-on-one. However, this anticipated match won't happen at Money in the Bank; instead, it's scheduled for Summer Slam 2024 on August 3. Summer Slam, WWE's second most significant event after Wrestlemania, is the perfect stage for Drew McIntyre versus CM Punk. This bout is highly anticipated, raising the likelihood that WWE will book it for Summer Slam, allowing Drew to settle the score with CM Punk once and for all.Another potential scenario on the horizon is a triple threat match involving Damian, Seth, and Drew for the World Title. This anticipated showdown could unfold at SummerSlam 2024, marking the first time all three superstars will face each other in a balanced contest. These competitors have consistently been central figures in the World Title picture. Their journey began at WrestleMania 40, where Seth initially clashed with Drew and suffered defeat at the hands of The Scottish Warrior.Shortly thereafter, Damian capitalized on his Money in the Bank contract, overcoming Drew to seize the championship. With Seth Rollins making a comeback and set to challenge Damian at Money in the Bank 2024, fans are eager for the prospect of a thrilling triple threat match for the World Title at SummerSlam 2024. Such a match would offer a fair opportunity for all three competitors to showcase their skills.A few days ago, news surfaced that Drew's wife was urgently hospitalized. Her absence from Clash at the Castle contributed to Drew's decision to leave WWE as he wanted to prioritize caring for her. Once she makes a full recovery, the Scottish Warrior plans to make a surprising return.",Drew McIntyre announced he was quitting WWE on the latest episode of RAW.

NEW DELHI: It won't be an understatement to say that Pakistan 's group stage exit from this edition of the T20 World Cup has neither gone down well with former players or critics, nor with the die-hard fans of the country.With defeats against the United States and archrivals India, Pakistan's fate was sealed with a washed-out game against the USA.Already eliminated Pakistan avoided another embarrassing loss against Ireland in their final game at the T20 World Cup.While former players and critics have vented out their frustration on air on various television and talk shows, there have been various videos of Pakistani fans breaking their TV sets in anger and blowing off steam on various social media handles.Amidst these gloomy times in Pakistan, a video has surfaced online where pacer Haris Rauf is allegedly taunted by a fan for the team's poor performance in the T20 World Cup.The video shows Rauf walking with his wife on a sidewalk, while being allegedly taunted by the fan. A furious Rauf jumps over a line of street shrub as his wife tries to stop him.Though the video is not clearly audible, Rauf appears to say for the fan that he must be Indian, to which the fan responds that he is a Pakistani.To his credit, the fan stands his ground against a furious Rauf who is stopped by 3-4 more fans who were passing by.On Monday there was a report that Pakistan's skipper Babar Azam and five other players - Mohammad Amir , Imad Wasim , Haris Rauf, Shadab Khan , and Azam Khan - have chosen to spend their holidays in London before going back home.",Haris Rauf allegedly taunted by a fan for Pakistan's poor performance in T20 World Cup.

His leadership qualities, strategic thinking, and understanding of the game have been evident through his tenure with Kolkata Knight Riders and his time as a captain for the Indian team and Delhi in domestic cricket.Former Indian head coach Anil Kumble recently highlighted the differences between coaching a national team and a franchise.""You have to give it time. He certainly is capable. We have seen Gautam handle teams. He has been a captain for India, for his franchise, for Delhi. He has all the credentials to be that. But the Indian team's coaching is slightly different, you have to give him time to settle in. Like I mentioned, in case he takes up the job, he will have the task of looking at not just the current lot, but also the future of Indian cricket,"" Kumble told ESPNCricinfo.The interview with the CAC is not just a formality but a critical step in determining whether Gambhir's vision aligns with the future direction of Indian cricket.As the BCCI and CAC deliberate on their choice, the cricketing community watches closely, anticipating the next chapter in Indian cricket's leadership.","Former Indian international Gautam Gambhir is scheduled for an interview with the Cricket Advisory Committee ( CAC ) on Tuesday.

After the video of Pakistan fast bowler Haris Rauf nearly coming to blows with a fan went viral on social media, the pacer has responded and vowed that he won't step back from responding if somebody hurls abuses at him and his family.""I decided to not bring this to social media, but now that the video is out, I feel it is necessary to address the situation,"" said Rauf in a post on 'X'.The video seems to be from outside one of the hotels in the US where Pakistan stayed during the course of their T20 World Cup fixtures in Group A.

T20 World Cup Super 8s: Cues for India from Windies win against Afghanistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/t20-world-cup-super-8s-cues-for-india-from-windies-win-against-afghanistan/articleshow/111099511.cms,"Rohit & Co may look to take Afghan pacers apart before spin comes into play

BRIDGETOWN: A sudden shower that lasted for about an hour in varying intensity on Monday night brought the humidity down a bit here after a hard day’s work. It continued for a bit on Tuesday morning as well, but the Indian contingent, and all those all around the team, would hope that it was just a one-off.Rain is the last thing that they would want on game-day against Afghanistan in Super-8s.Especially after what they saw of the Afghans in St Lucia in their last league game on Monday before they flew down to Barbados to take on the mighty Indians. Rohit Sharma would desperately want the game not to be curtailed, because in a 20-over contest on a good pitch --- as was the case in St Lucia and would be at Kensington Oval as well --- India are far ahead of the Afghans.To add to that, Monday’s game left a crucial pointer as to how India should go about their work on Thursday. West Indies top-order batters Johnson Charles and Nicholas Pooran launched a brutal assault on the Afghan pacers Fazalhaq Farooqi and Azmatullah Omarzai, plundering 92 off the first six overs that virtually killed the game for the Afghans. But over the next 14 overs, once the spinners came into operation, the likes of Rashid Khan and Noor Ahmed were able to curtail the West Indians, even though Rashid went for a massive 28-run last over towards the end, courtesy a rampaging Pooran.India will surely take a cue from this game and look to do maximum damage right at the top before Afghanistan spinners can get into the game. Given the fact that it’s a day game and there will be no dew, it won’t be a bad idea to bat first and take the game away from Afghanistan, unless of course, there is a lot of moisture on the day of the match.Virat Kohli , during the practice sessions here, is trying to be at his attacking best. For Rohit Sharma in T20s, it’s always top-gear cricket and the duo will look to push on the accelerator right from the word go. And India’s No. 3 for the tournament Rishabh Pant , too, has been in fine form and the team would love at least two of the three to take charge so that the Afghans don’t find a footing.For Afghanistan, the turnaround time from a heavy 104-run defeat is very short, especially when they are up against a team that they have never beaten. Coach Jonathan Trott tried to take the lessons from a defeat.""We have seen the areas that we need to work on…If we don’t start an over well, being able to get out of it without too much damage is something we need to do. Today we had two that went for 60 runs and that swung the game massively and took a lot of pressure off the next 18 overs,"" Trott said.But Afghanistan definitely lack the depth in their pace attack that can seriously threaten India. It’s one area where India --- with Jasprit Bumrah, Arshdeep Singh, Mohammed Siraj and Hardik Pandya --- are so vastly superior that for the Afghan warriors, it can be a bridge too far.Or, at least that’s what all the Indian fans trooping into Barbados from different parts of the US and Canada believe, along with the millions back home. We will all know in a couple of days’ time!",Rain is the last thing that India would want on game-day against Afghanistan in Super-8s.

That displays good batsmanship and that is what I try,"" said Suryakumar during a media interaction here on Tuesday.""It's difficult to generate that force when there's no pace on the wicket and when someone has read your game nicely. So, at that time, you have to be very smart how you want to extend your innings.""You have to change according to the situation, what team demands at that moment and talk to your partner who is inside, calm your nerves down and then take the innings ahead.""Suryakumar is eager to showcase his versatile batting style once again in the West Indies, although he didn't face any significant challenges with the conditions in the United States.""I was happy playing there as well (laughs). It's not that we weren't happy playing there, but we were playing for the first time, so yes, the conditions were different and little challenging as well. But we have played here (in West Indies), we know the conditions.""The Kensington Oval pitch has a distinct brownish appearance, which the Indian team also observed during their previous tour of the Caribbean.""The practice pitches, yeah, they were a little spicy in New York. It was fresh. They made the conditions after they got to know there is a World Cup there.

Will Kuldeep Yadav make his first appearance at the 2024 T20 World Cup in India's opening 'Super 8s' match against Afghanistan?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/will-kuldeep-yadav-make-his-first-appearance-at-the-2024-t20-world-cup-in-indias-opening-super-8s-match-against-afghanistan/articleshow/111092829.cms,"T20 WORLD CUP:

The wrist-spin of Kuldeep Yadav is expected to be in the mix when India resume their T20 World Cup campaign in the 'Super 8s' stage in Barbados with the game against Afghanistan on Thursday.Skipper Rohit Sharma has emphasized the importance of using four all-rounders to maintain balance in the playing XI. That leaves the decision on the Indian thinktank if they want to tinker with their group-stage strategy and drop a pacer to bring Kuldeep into the playing eleven.Despite being India's top spinner across all formats, Kuldeep was not included in the eleven during the first stage. The team opted for three specialist pacers and two finger-spinners, Axar Patel and Ravindra Jadeja, which allowed for batting depth until number 8.If the pitch offers the same level of turn as seen in the nets in Bridgetown, bringing Kuldeep in the frame will become a no-brainer. However, it is difficult to predict the pitch behaviour until the actual game day. The wicket could favour batting, as evidenced by Australia's impressive score of 201 against their rivals England during the initial stage of the tournament.During Tuesday's practice session, Kuldeep had an extended bowling session. He bowled to Rohit and Virat Kohli, who practiced the slog sweep against the wrist spinner.Kuldeep could be seen simulating a particular field placement while bowling to Rohit, who found it tough tackling the spinner at the start of the net session as head coach Rahul Dravid watched on.""The pitch should turn in the middle as well, may be not as much as it is doing in the nets but will definitely turn. The spinners have proved quite useful throughout the Caribbean thus far. I don't think India will make any changes, they would not want to compromise on their batting,"" a former international player, who was present at the venue, told PTI.Kohli, eager to regain his scoring touch, dedicated a significant portion of his time to batting practice. He began with an extended session of throwdowns before shifting to the adjacent net, where he faced the spin of Kuldeep and the pace of left-armer Khaleel Ahmed.The entire squad, consisting of 15 players, attended the training session on Monday, two days prior to the upcoming game. They followed it up with another practice on Tuesday, ensuring everyone's presence.","Kuldeep Yadav is expected to be in the mix when India resume their T20 World Cup campaign in the 'Super 8s' stage in Barbados with the game against Afghanistan on Thursday.

Fans and former players are calling for a thorough investigation and necessary changes to restore the team's credibility and performance on the international stage.

His performance propelled his team to a 104-run victory over Afghanistan in the final first-round match of the Twenty20 World Cup at Gros Islet in St Lucia.Pooran was run out by Azmatullah Omarzai's direct hit on the stumps in the final over while attempting a second run. This run-out climaxed the West Indies' innings at 218 for five, marking the highest score of the tournament so far.In response, Afghanistan managed only 114 runs in 16.2 overs. However, the result was largely academic since both teams had already secured their spots in the Super Eight round, which begins on Wednesday.West Indies started aggressively after being asked to bat first on an excellent pitch in front of an excited crowd. Brandon King led the charge by guiding the first ball from left-arm paceman Fazalhaq Farooqi for four runs through the leg side.Johnson Charles continued the momentum, striking another four through square leg, accumulating 13 runs in the first over. He then square drove Omarzai's first ball to the boundary and sliced for another four.Though King was clean bowled, Pooran, known for being the most prolific six-hitter in T20s this decade, smashed a six and a four to push the team's score to 50 in under four overs.Afghanistan's captain Rashid Khan introduced himself in the fifth over to exert some control with his wrist spin, managing to concede 12 runs. By the end of the powerplay, West Indies had tallied 92 for one, the highest score after six overs in a T20 World Cup .The Afghan bowlers managed to slow the run rate somewhat, but the West Indies still managed to accumulate 113 for two by the 10th over and 148 for three by the 15th over. The 200-run mark was achieved after 18.5 overs, courtesy of medium pacer Gulbadin Naib, the seventh bowler employed.Afghanistan never appeared to be in contention, as the West Indies bowlers maintained tight control from the start. Left-arm paceman Obed McCoy, playing his first game of the tournament, varied his length and pace effectively, taking three wickets for just 14 runs.Pooran, also contributing as a wicketkeeper, made a spectacular leaping catch towards the end of the innings.""I had to take responsibility,"" said Pooran after smashing the highest individual score at this year's tournament.""In West Indies people want four and sixes.

NEW DELHI: Gary Kirsten , the head coach of the Pakistan cricket team , has expressed his deep disappointment and frustration with the team's performance in the ongoing T20 World Cup in the USA and West Indies.In a scathing criticism, Kirsten stated that there is ""no unity"" within the team, and he has ""never seen such a situation"" throughout his extensive coaching career.Pakistan's dismal showing in the tournament culminated in a group stage exit, a far cry from their runner-up finish in the previous edition.The team's lackluster performance was marked by a shocking defeat against tournament debutants USA, followed by a loss to their arch-rivals India. Pakistan managed to salvage some pride with a consolation victory over Ireland, but it was too little, too late.According to PTI, reports from Pakistani media outlets suggest that Kirsten, who famously led India to their ODI World Cup victory in 2011, did not mince his words when assessing the team's shortcomings after their elimination from the T20 World Cup.His candid remarks underscore the urgent need for the Pakistan cricket team to address the apparent lack of cohesion and unity within their ranks if they hope to bounce back from this disappointing campaign.""There's no unity in Pakistan's team.

NEW DELHI: Lockie Ferguson made history with the most economical spell in T20Is as New Zealand ended their World Cup campaign with a dominant seven-wicket win over Papua New Guinea in Trinidad on Monday.Ferguson's stunning spell of 4-4-0-3 helped New Zealand bowl out PNG for just 78 in 19.4 overs. The Kiwis then chased down the target with 46 balls to spare.Ferguson's performance was remarkable as he joined Canada’s Saad Bin Zafar as only the second bowler in T20I history to bowl all four overs as maidens and return with three or more wickets. Zafar had previously recorded 4-4-0-2.Despite New Zealand’s strong showing against Oman and PNG in the Group stage, they were ousted from the T20 World Cup after earlier losses to Afghanistan and West Indies, which led to their early elimination from the tournament.PNG faced its own challenges, losing each of its four Group C fixtures.New Zealand's bowlers, led by Ferguson, consistently troubled the PNG batters.Kabua Morea put up a fight for PNG, dismissing Finn Allen for a duck on the second ball of New Zealand’s chase and later taking the wicket of Rachin Ravindra.Devon Conway was pivotal with a 32-ball 35, including three sixes and two fours, laying a solid foundation for the win. Skipper Kane Williamson and Daryl Mitchell then ensured the chase was completed smoothly.Earlier in the match, Ferguson's magical spell restricted PNG to a low score. New Zealand’s bowlers successfully kept PNG’s batters on the defensive throughout their innings.Trent Boult played his last T20 World Cup match, starting with a tight two-run over. Tim Southee struck first, getting PNG opener Tony Ura caught at deep backward point.

NEW DELHI: Cristiano Ronaldo is on the brink of making history. He could become the first player to compete in six European Championships when Portugal faces the Czech Republic .The Czech Republic, though, is no easy opponent, marking their eighth consecutive appearance in the tournament.The match is set to commence at 9 p.m. local time (1900 GMT) on Tuesday, ensuring an exciting showdown.This will be the fourth European Championship meeting between these two nations. The Czechs won their first encounter in 1996, while Portugal secured victories in 2008 and 2012.Portugal has dominated the recent clashes, winning the last four games. The Czechs have struggled to score in the past three matches against Portugal.Both teams progressed to the knockout stage of the 2021 European Championship, with defending champions Portugal being eliminated by Belgium in the round of 16, and the Czech Republic falling to Denmark in the quarterfinals.Portugal secured the Euro 2016 title, while the Czechs' last victory dates back to 1976 when they were part of Czechoslovakia. The legendary Antonín Panenka clinched their triumph with an unforgettable penalty, inspiring the famous Panenka technique attempted by players like Spain's Sergio Ramos.Roberto Martínez , who previously coached Belgium and orchestrated Portugal's exit in the last edition, now takes charge of the Portuguese team. Under his leadership, Portugal dominated the Euro 2024 qualifiers, winning all their matches while scoring an impressive 36 goals and conceding only two.Despite Portugal's star-studded attacking lineup, which includes talents like João Félix, Gonçalo Ramos, and Rafael Leão, Cristiano Ronaldo remains the center of attention. The superstar's presence drew enthusiastic fans to Portugal's training session, where some had to be escorted off the field while attempting to take selfies with Ronaldo.Ronaldo, who already holds the records for most goals (14) and appearances (25) at the tournament, continues to showcase his prowess on the field, as evidenced by his recent performance against Ireland.Patrik Schick , the Czech Republic's prolific striker and joint top-scorer at the 2021 European Championship alongside Ronaldo, poses a significant threat to opposing defenses.If Pepe takes the field, he could become the oldest player to participate in a European Championship, surpassing the record set by Hungary goalkeeper Gábor Király at Euro 2016.The UEFA European Championship 2024 Group F match between Portugal and Czech Republic is set for June 18, Tuesday.The game will be held in Red Bull arena, Leipzig, Germany, with a kick off time of 12:30 AM IST.In India and the Indian subcontinent, you can catch all UEFA Euro 2024 matches on Sony Sports Network, which has acquired the broadcast rights.For English commentary, tune into Sony Sports Ten 2 SD & HD.

NEW DELHI: Georgia is set to make its first appearance at a major soccer tournament, facing Turkey in Group F of the European Championship. The match will be held in Dortmund at 6 pm local time (1600 GMT), with Portugal and the Czech Republic completing the group.Although Georgia is a newcomer to Euro 2024 , the nation has a significant connection to the tournament's history. In 1960, three Georgian players were part of the Soviet Union team that won the inaugural title.To celebrate the national team's milestone, Georgia issued commemorative stamps and special coins.The team will heavily depend on Khvicha Kvaratskhelia , the star player who has excelled at Napoli over the past two seasons, including being named MVP in their Serie A championship campaign of 2022-23.Turkey, once considered promising outsiders in the previous Euros, underperformed by losing all three group games and scoring only one goal. Despite winning a qualifying group that included Croatia, the national team has garnered less attention this time.Vincenzo Montella , a former Italy striker, unexpectedly found himself coaching Turkey after spending two years as the coach of Turkish club Adana Demirspor. He assumed the position in September 2023.In a touching display of support, a moped driver traveled 4,000 kilometers (about 2,500 miles) over 12 days to deliver a Georgian flag covered in messages of encouragement from people back home to the team at its training base in Germany.Kvaratskhelia, aged 23, boasts an impressive record of 15 goals in 30 games for Georgia. On the other hand, Turkey's recent form has been disappointing, failing to secure a win in their last five matches, including a 2-1 defeat to Poland in a warm-up game for Euro 2024.The UEFA European Championship 2024 Group F match between Turkey and Georgia is set for June 18, Tuesday.The game will take place at Signal Iduna Park in Dortmund, Germany, with kickoff at 9:30 PM IST.In India and the Indian subcontinent, UEFA Euro 2024 matches can be viewed on Sony Sports Network.

Opener Smriti Mandhana was the saving grace with a well-paced century.When on a song, these Indian batters can make any team sweat with their skill sets. But with experienced medium pacers — Ayabonga Khaka and Masabata Klaas — in their ranks, South Africa can trouble India if they get assistance from the pitch.On the other hand, India’s bowlers, especially leg-spinner Asha Sobhana — after an impressive four-wicket haul on Sunday — will be keen to perform well once again. With off-spinner Deepti Sharma and pacer Renuka Singh too in their bowling line-up, India have the variety and depth to trouble the visitors.With Asha, who plays for Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the WPL, well acquainted with the Chinnaswamy surface, she is keen on making good use of the conditions. “Chinnaswamy is special for me. Even before I was playing for RCB, Chinnaswamy was always special. From my U-19 days, whenever I bowl here, I got some advantage,” said Asha, who scalped one of the key South African wickets in the first ODI in the form of Marizanne Kapp.South Africa are aware about the need to bring their A game to challenge India and force the series into a decider. Like India, they would also want their batters to deliver.Most importantly, skipper and opener Laura Wolvaardt, who has been their in-form player, need to lead from the front to unsettle the home team.

New Zealand 's early exit from the ongoing T20 World Cup in the USA and the Caribbean islands was particularly disappointing given their strong track record in previous editions, where they consistently reached at least the semi-finals.Their campaign was derailed by an unexpected loss to Afghanistan and a defeat at the hands of co-hosts West Indies, and ended with a meaningless victory against Papua New Guinea, a team considered to be one of the weakest in the tournament.The win provided little solace for the Kiwis, who were already eliminated from the competition.""It's natural at the end of the World Cup cycle, and especially if you haven't done quite as well as what you wanted, that there's a lot of reflections going on,"" said the NZ head coach Gary Stead, as quoted by Reuters. .As the team looks to rebuild and prepare for the next T20 World Cup in 2026, to be held in Sri Lanka and India, changes to the squad are likely.Trent Boult, a veteran seamer, has already announced that this was his last World Cup appearance. Further adjustments to the team's composition may be necessary to revitalize their performance and ensure a stronger showing in future tournaments.""Usually these things mean there's a line in the sand that's made and from there you make decisions around the way forward. I guess for us, looking at the next T20 World Cup in two years' time, it will be very quickly into (deciding) what does that look like (and) which of these players remain in the group,"" added the coach.The Black Caps have enjoyed success under the leadership duo of captain Williamson and coach Stead, securing victory in the inaugural World Test Championship (WTC) in 2021 and reaching the T20 World Cup final in the United Arab Emirates shortly after.New Zealand's early exit from the T20 World Cup in the Caribbean marks the end of an impressive streak in major cricket tournaments, coming just seven months after Kane Williamson 's team reached their fifth consecutive semi-finals in the 50-over World Cup.Stead's contract as an all-formats coach extends until the conclusion of the current WTC cycle in 2025, but he may consider relinquishing his responsibilities in the white-ball formats, having previously advocated for a specialist to oversee the shorter formats.Despite their achievements, a long-sought-after white-ball trophy continues to elude New Zealand, leading supporters to question whether the current leadership has the ability to secure one.Similarly, Williamson, who relinquished the Test captaincy to paceman Tim Southee in 2022, may decide it is time for a new leader to take the reins in white-ball cricket or opt to drop a format to extend his playing career.""Oh, I don't know,"" Williamson, who is 33, was asked about his Test future. ""There's a bit of time between now and then (2026), so it's about regrouping as a side. We've got red-ball cricket over the next year basically, so it's back into some other international formats, and we'll see where things land.""""The older New Zealand players would have looked at this (T20 World Cup) as maybe their last good opportunity, so it might be that it's time to move on,"" former captain Stephen Fleming told ESPNcricinfo.New Zealand's Test team, whioch concluded the previous cycle in sixth place while attempting to retain their WTC crown, might face difficulties in reconstructing a competitive T20 squad for the 2026 World Cup.Some of the team's veteran players, such as 35-year-old Southee, who has been Boult's long-time bowling partner, may opt for a reduced workload or pursue a profitable path in franchise cricket.",New Zealand were eliminated from the T20 World Cup in the USA and the Caribbean.

NEW DELHI: Australia have advanced smoothly to the Super Eight stage of the T20 World Cup , showcasing a scene familiar in major cricket tournaments. The West Indies have also thrived on home soil as the race for the semi-finals kicks off on Wednesday.Fresh from their recent World Test Championship and 2023 50-over World Cup wins, Australia's team aims to become the first to hold global titles in all three formats at once.Led by Mitchell Marsh , the team displayed their strength with four dominant victories in the group stage.In a tournament marked by low scores, Australia stands out as the only team to score two 175-plus totals and one of the three teams to hit the 200-run mark. They have navigated difficult conditions effortlessly, which has stumped many other teams.On the other hand, the West Indies, captained by Rovman Powell , have also performed exceptionally. They won all four of their group matches to secure their place in the Super Eight. The slow pitches have played to their advantage, highlighting their prowess in the T20 format.Despite their failure to qualify for last year's 50-over World Cup in India, the Caribbean team remains determined to excel in T20, a format where they have traditionally been strong.Under the leadership of Daren Sammy , the former all-rounder and now coach, the team has successfully combined youth and experience. Sammy, who led the West Indies to T20 World Cup victories in 2012 and 2016, has been instrumental in this blend.Batter Nicholas Pooran mentioned that the team feels comfortable playing on slow pitches, stating, ""We have been playing our entire career on these pitches. We're not surprised that it's slow, it's low, it's low-scoring. The reason why most of our averages are 20-25 is because we bat on pitches like this. But we know for a fact as a group, whenever we get good pitches, we are a very dangerous team and that is an advantage to us.""As the Super Eight stage progresses, both Australia and the West Indies are in strong positions to advance towards the semi-finals. They are capitalising on their familiarity with the conditions and their current performance levels.South Africa and India have successfully moved on to the Super Eight stage of the T20 World Cup 2024. Both teams remained unbeaten during the group stage, despite facing challenges in the United States leg of the tournament.India, eager to end their global title drought since the 2013 Champions Trophy, are particularly motivated. ""There is real keenness in the group to go and do something special,"" India captain Rohit Sharma remarked on Tuesday. ""That's a good way to start the second stage of the tournament.""India faces a busy schedule, playing three Group 1 matches in five days. However, Rohit, likely playing his last T20 World Cup alongside teammate Virat Kohli, expressed confidence. ""It is going to be a little hectic, but we are used to all of this,"" he said.England, the defending champions, have struggled to find their form, narrowly securing their place in the Super Eight. For Jos Buttler's squad, significant improvement is needed to aim for a semi-final berth, especially with strong teams like Afghanistan competing.A remarkable story in the tournament has been the United States, who managed to upset former champions Pakistan. Facing tough competition in the Super Eight will be challenging for Monank Patel and his team, but the experience will be valuable for their development.
