MUMBAI: When this IPL began, Kolkata Knight Riders ' ( KKR ) coach Chandrakant Pandit wasn’t going through a pleasant time, with a few players questioning his “dictatorial” coaching style. Pandit had the last laugh on Sunday. In an exclusive interview with TOI, Pandit explained what makes him a successful coach.It’s a great, special and a very different feeling.This is a high-pressure, prestigious international-level tournament. There’s continuous travelling and you have to maintain that winning momentum. There are a lot of ups and downs. It’s a long journey. You face many obstacles, and to bounce back from them feels something different for the team.I always believe in discipline. There’s a routine that I always follow. Respecting the game is most important. I don’t go above the game, and never allow the others to do that.I always stick to my style of working. I don’t get distracted or react to that because you cannot keep everyone happy. I’ve been coaching for almost 25 years now; however, I’m also changing a little with the new generation and understanding them better. This season was more relaxed because I knew what was important for the team.His presence in the dugout was a great motivation for everyone. It was a great boost for us. He came in with a lot of cricketing experience. He’s been a part of the IPL for so many years. We took all the decisions collectively.I would give a lot of credit to Shreyas. He’s been a fantastic captain, very calm and cool. He was receptive to our suggestions and handled the team well on and off the field. With KKR, he showed the qualities which make him worthy for India captaincy in the future.Any player will be a little disappointed with that (BCCI contract snub). However, that should not affect his performance. Whenever we would discuss anything, we would never touch upon that point. We were clear that the task at hand was more important. I remember that he told me: ‘Sir, I’ll prove it.’ The way he has batted in this IPL, he now seems to be a more matured, sensible batsman.It’s about the plan that we are expecting him to execute. He’s such a big, experienced player. I could make out that he’s highly committed. We discussed about trying to come round the wicket at times. He accepted our suggestion and tried it out too in a match. He’s a very humble man. He was always there to discuss anything with us and was very receptive.Nayar’s contribution was huge, while Bharat Arun (bowling coach) and Carl Crowe (spin-bowling coach) deserve credit for the bowlers’ fine show. Nayar conducts our camps well. He spends time throughout the year with our domestic players. Whenever they are free, our domestic players come to Mumbai for a camp with us. It’s not necessary that 15 players have to be there for us to have a camp.",Chandrakant Pandit has won the IPL with Kolkata Knight Riders. The KKR coach has been criticised for his 'dictatorial' coaching style. Pandit says he is changing with the new generation and understanding them better. He also praises mentor Gautam Gambhir for his support.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110483084,imgsize-67688,width-400,resizemode-4/110483084.jpg"

Experience and pedigree score over IPL form in India's T20 World Cup squad,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/experience-and-pedigree-score-over-ipl-form-in-indias-t20-world-cup-squad/articleshow/110517782.cms,"ALSO SEE:

The IPL’s overbearing presence can often mask the T20 World Cup ’s unique imprint on the format. The IPL is at once allencompassing in its scope and specific in its requirements, so India’s selectors chose to be influenced only to an extent by performances in the league.The Ajit Agarkar-led committee has been both pragmatic and conservative while picking the 15-member World Cup squad.Naturally, this has somewhat dampened the excitement and anticipation around the younger crop of players who sizzled in this season’s IPL.Where’s Abhishek Sharma? Where’s Harshit Rana? Why Axar Patel over Varun Chakravarthy? Why have no Indian players from both IPL finalists been picked in the World Cup squad? And why does Rinku Singh, a proven finisher, find a place only among the reserves?It will be interesting to watch whether this safety-first selection approach pays off for Rohit Sharma’s team. It’s relatively easy to poke the weak spots in any IPL team but the T20 World Cup has been a fluid and unpredictable beast.Even the best teams have not enjoyed eras of World Cup domination, unlike in the 50-over format. The T20 World Cup format also makes it easy for the likes of India to reach the knockouts, so nothing less than a title win will be deemed satisfactory.When fates can hinge on a single hitor a no-ball, it’s human nature to bet on experience and pedigree. One can say the selectors have been guided as much by gut feel as data. In effect, this T20 World Cup is a farewell fling at an elusive ICC trophy for some senior cricketers who came so close to attaining that goal last year inthe 50-over format.It’s worth remembering that India have not won a T20 World Cup since the IPL first took off. There are hopes the trend can be broken this time, even with virtually the same crop of top-order players — barring Yashasvi Jaiswal — who faltered in the semifinal against England in Adelaide in 2022.The nagging feeling remains that in a short format, which lends itself readily to experimentation, shouldn’t this season’s IPL performances have counted for more? Should India have banked on in-form youngsters like they did back in the inaugural edition in 2007, when they won the tournament for the only time?It’s worth mentioning that T20 was in its infancy in 2007. The seniors had voluntarily opted out. Analysts still hadn’t run over every possible match-up in forensic detail. The T20 key now is the ability to reinforce experience with the ability to reinvent oneself, as Virat Kohli demonstrated in this IPL.The winning captain in 2007, MS Dhoni, was the first to red-flag the temptation to pick cricketers purely on immediate IPL form. During the 2009 Champions Trophy in South Africa, Dhoni had said such form must be put in “correct perspective”.Although Dhoni was talking about format-hopping selection choices back then, the ideology doesn’t seem to have changed 15 years on.“We decided on the core of the team long before the IPL,” captain Rohit Sharma said this time. “In IPL, performances change every day. Anyone will come and score a hundred or take five wickets. We knew 70%-80% of our squad (before the IPL).”So even though Kohli has remapped his T20 batting, taken on the spinners and lost none of his incredible consistency while striking at 154.69 in this IPL, Agarkar suggested his name had been pencilled in long before.“We haven’t even been discussing Kohli’s strike rate. You take positives from what is happening in the IPL (but) the pressure of a World Cup is different. You need experience,” Agarkar said.The pitches in the West Indies are different, slower. Unlike in the IPL, there won’t be just range-hitting at play in this World Cup. That doesn’t mean IPL performances haven’t mattered — just look at the impact Shivam Dube has had with his ability to clobber the spinners in the middle overs, answering India’s call for just such a requirement.Of course, pedigree is no guarantee of success. India’s squad is packed with proven performers but the same bunch has also tended to falter at the doorstep of an ICC trophy in the past.Also, India’s selections have been a bit random in the 28 T20Is they have played since the last T20 World Cup. That tournament was supposed to draw a line in the sand and mark a move on from the stalwarts. However, after trying out all and sundry — none of whom got a decent run — that transition process has now been abruptly halted.Having rejected any recency-bias in selection, Rohit and coach Dravid must now address some key issues: Should Kohli open, like he does in the IPL? Should the twin leg-spin attack be the norm on Caribbean pitches? Can Hardik Pandya and Ravindra Jadeja find form? Will the Dube ploy work? Will Jasprit Bumrah lack pace support? And how do they cover up for Rinku’s absence?India’s performance in this tournament will not only reveal if this conservative approach was justified, but also shape future selection policies. By the end of it all, we’ll know if recent form — specifically of the IPL kind — should matter more in a T20 World Cup.",The IPL’s overbearing presence can often mask the T20 World Cup ’s unique imprint on the format.

Now I am getting 55 lakh rupees, so this is a lot, I should be happy with whatever God gives me. This is my thinking. I don't think at all that I should have got this much money or that much. I am very happy even with 55 lakh rupees. When I didn't have this, I realized the value of money.""Rinku emphasized that chasing money is not his priority.""If I tell you the truth today, then all this is an illusion.

Rayudu's Previous Remarks on Virat Kohli and RCB

Rayudu's Criticism of RCB Management:



NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer Ambati Rayudu has once again courted controversy following his comments on Virat Kohli and Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) after the IPL 2024 final.Despite Kohli's stellar performance, Rayudu pointed out that the consistency of the star batter might actually burden the team, even as he emerged as the highest run-scorer in the competition.During an analysis on Star Sports, Rayudu, along with Kevin Pietersen and Mayanti Langer, discussed the impact of having a player of Kohli's caliber on a team like RCB.""When you have a stalwart and a legend like Virat Kohli, who has set really high standards, it's very hard for the youngsters to be in a side like that and try and match his standard because he always wants the team to be performing at his level.""""No, it should be good for youngsters…""""But sometimes the burden of really trying to be Virat Kohli in a sport where you know nobody is going to be like him.""""But didn't Patidar step up to the plate?""""Patidar can only be a Patidar but not a Virat Kohli, and I think RCB, as a management, understands that you cannot have 11 Virat Kohli in the team. You need to have 1 Virat Kohli with 10 others being themselves, having their own identities and strengths and weaknesses. And you need to use them well in terms of resources. You can't expect somebody to win the game in the first season. You need to give him that leeway and time to grow into a match-winner. So I think the management has its task out, and even Virat Kohli needs to ease his standards a bit when it comes to youngsters, nurturing them, and letting them grow.""Earlier, in his congratulatory message to the Shreyas Iyer-led KKR, Rayudu subtly criticized RCB, emphasizing that individual accolades like the Orange Cap do not guarantee IPL titles, but rather it is the collective contributions from the entire team that lead to success.""Congratulations to the KKR team for really standing up for stalwarts like Narine, Russell, and Starc, and also contributing their share in the team's win. That’s how a team wins the IPL. We have seen this over the years. It's not the Orange Cap that wins you the IPL but it is the contributions like 300 runs each (from many players),"" Rayudu remarked.Kohli had an outstanding individual season, winning the Orange Cap with 741 runs in 15 innings, including one hundred and five fifties, at an average of 61.75 and a strike rate of over 154. Despite his impressive performance, RCB once again fell short of the title.This isn't the first time Rayudu has criticized RCB. Following their exit from IPL 2024 after a loss to Rajasthan Royals in the Eliminator, Rayudu took to X to express his thoughts. He pointed out the shortcomings in RCB's management and leadership, suggesting that prioritizing individual milestones over team interests has hindered their success.""My heart truly goes out to all the RCB supporters who have passionately supported the team over the years. If only the management and the leaders had the team's interests ahead of individual milestones, RCB would have won multiple titles. Just remember how many fantastic players have been let go of. Force your management to bring players who will put team interests first. A great new chapter can start from the mega auction,"" Rayudu had written.Rayudu's remarks have sparked a significant debate in the cricketing community, highlighting the ongoing struggles of RCB to convert individual brilliance into team success.","Former India cricketer Ambati Rayudu has courted controversy following his comments on Virat Kohli and Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) He pointed out that the consistency of the star batter might actually burden the team.

NEW DELHI: Australia's veteran support staff stepped up to fill in as they comfortably defeated Namibia in their opening T20 World Cup warm-up match in Trinidad. David Warner , putting his disappointing IPL season behind him, led the charge for the nine-man Australian team, helping them chase down Namibia's total of 9-119 with ease.Despite having four support staff members over the age of 40 acting as substitute fielders at one point, the Australians restricted the 14th-ranked men's T20I team to a modest total at Queen's Park Oval.Also see: India T20 World Cup squad: List of players, match date, time and venue Namibia had been struggling at 6-50, but managed to recover somewhat. However, Warner's unbeaten 54 off just 21 balls, which included three sixes and six boundaries, ensured a seven-wicket victory with 10 overs to spare, showing no signs of the hand injury he sustained during the IPL.The Australian team was short on players, with only nine of their World Cup squad having arrived in Port of Spain. The remaining six players -Pat Cummins , Travis Head , Marcus Stoinis, Mitchell Starc, Glenn Maxwell , and Cameron Green - were given extra time at home following the conclusion of the IPL.As a result, selection chief George Bailey (41), fielding coach Andre Borovec (46), batting coach Brad Hodge (49), and head coach Andrew McDonald took to the field at various points during the match, all performing admirably.Captain Mitch Marsh, still recovering from a hamstring injury, only fielded for half of the Namibia innings and was run out due to a mix-up with Warner while opening the batting. Tim David (23 off 16) and Josh Inglis (5) also contributed to the chase.Josh Hazlewood, playing his first match in nearly three months, was impressive with figures of 4-3-2-5, while Adam Zampa (3-25) and Nathan Ellis also performed well. Namibia's Zane Green (38 off 30) took advantage of part-timer Tim David's bowling (0-39) to boost their total.Australia will play their second and final warm-up game against West Indies on Thursday at the same venue, with the possibility of Marcus Stoinis returning to the squad.Mitch Marsh (c), Ashton Agar, Pat Cummins, Tim David, Nathan Ellis, Cameron Green, Josh Hazlewood, Travis Head, Josh Inglis, Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell Starc, Marcus Stoinis, Matthew Wade, David Warner, Adam ZampaJune 6: v Oman, Kensington Oval, Barbados, 10.30am AESTJune 9: v England, Kensington Oval, Barbados, 3am AESTJune 12: v Namibia, Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, Antigua, 10.30am AESTJune 16: v Scotland, Daren Sammy Stadium, St Lucia, 10.30am AEST","Australia beat Namibia by seven wickets in their opening T20 World Cup warm-up match.

Ronaldo and his team will face the unbeaten Al-Hilal in the King Cup final on Friday.Ronaldo joined Al Nassr in December 2022, signing a contract that reportedly earns him $75 million per year, making him the highest-paid footballer in history, according to ESPN.Prior to his move to Saudi Arabia, Ronaldo had two successful stints withManchester United , where he won three Premier League titles and a UEFA Champions League trophy.He also enjoyed a remarkable nine-year spell at Real Madrid, becoming the club's all-time leading goalscorer and winning two La Liga titles and four Champions League trophies.

NEW DELHI: Cristiano Ronaldo concluded the Saudi Pro League season by establishing a new goal-scoring record on Monday. In Riyadh, Ronaldo found the back of the net twice as Al-Nassr secured a 4-2 victory over Al-Ittihad, bringing his league goal tally to 35, surpassing the previous record of 34 set by Abderrazak Hamdallah in 2019.In the closing moments of the first half, Ronaldo, who had already seen two goals disallowed for offside, brought down a long pass from Mohammed Al-Fatil with his chest and scored with a low shot from the left side of the area. With 21 minutes left to play, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner celebrated enthusiastically after heading in a corner from Marcelo Brozovic . Five minutes later, he was substituted off the field to a standing ovation from the home supporters.Ronaldo's season was filled with notable moments, including four hat tricks and one red card. He also faced a suspension in February for making an obscene gesture towards Al-Shabab fans who had been chanting the name of his long-time soccer rival, Lionel Messi.Al-Nassr secured a second-place finish in the league, trailing local rival Al-Hilal by 14 points. Al-Hilal clinched the championship more than two weeks ago and completed the 34-round league undefeated on Monday. Even without the services of Neymar, who joined the club in August from Paris Saint-Germain but suffered a season-ending ACL injury in October, Al-Hilal proved to be a formidable force.Aleksandar Mitrovic , signed from London club Fulham last summer, stepped up and concluded the season with a goal in the final seconds, sealing a 2-1 win over Al-Wehda. The Serbian striker finished with 27 league goals, second only to Ronaldo. Al-Hilal's title-winning campaign included a 34-game winning streak across all competitions, setting a new world record for a top-tier team.""This season has been truly exceptional for the team, arguably our best ever,"" coach Jorge Jesus said. ""The credit goes to the immense talent within the squad and the incredible sense of unity that transcends both on and off-field interactions.""Al-Ittihad's loss to Al-Nassr capped off a disappointing season for the defending champion. Karim Benzema, acquired from Real Madrid, struggled with injuries, and despite the presence of N'Golo Kante and Fabinho in midfield, signed from Chelsea and Liverpool respectively, the Jeddah-based team could only manage a fifth-place finish. Poor results led to the dismissal of coach Nuno Santo in November, who returned to the English Premier League a month later to take charge of Nottingham Forest.Al-Ahli, the fourth of the 'Big Four' clubs acquired by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund last June, secured a third-place finish, 17 points behind Al-Nassr. Al-Ahli defeated Al-Fayha 1-0, courtesy of a late goal from former Liverpool forward Roberto Firmino, his ninth of the season.Amid various storylines, Ronaldo dominated the headlines, and the 39-year-old still has one more opportunity to end the season with a trophy when Al-Nassr faces Al-Hilal in the King's Cup final on Friday.","Cristiano Ronaldo scores twice as Al-Nassr beats Al-Ittihad 4-2 in Saudi Pro League.

NEW DELHI: Barcelona concluded their season with a 2-1 win against Sevilla in LaLiga on Sunday, leaving departing coach Xavi Hernandez with mixed emotions following a campaign without any trophies and a second-place finish, 10 points behind champions Real Madrid .In Xavi's final match, after being dismissed on Friday, Barcelona faced the disappointment of a season that saw them lose the Spanish Super Cup final to Real Madrid and suffer elimination from the Champions League by Paris St Germain in the quarter-finals.""I don't think the work has been appreciated enough,"" said Xavi. ""A double last year (LaLiga and Super Cup) and this year we haven't been up to the task because of details.""I leave with some mixed feelings because the work is positive even though we didn't win the titles this season. I think we were on the right track and I still think so.""Barcelona started the match aggressively and took the lead in the 15th minute when Robert Lewandowski scored his 19th league goal of the season from close range, capitalizing on a cross from Joao Cancelo .Sevilla equalized through Youssef En-Nesyri 's goal in the 31st minute and threatened again but couldn't beat Marc-Andre ter Stegen before Fermin Lopez secured the winning goal for Barcelona on the hour mark.Ter Stegen reflected on the future, saying, ""Today is not the best time to talk about the future but we have a lot of good players. We have to work a lot more on an individual level to be able to compete with anyone next year. Xavi has always given us a lot. He worked every day so that we could succeed.

I know how to play in different conditions,” Rybakina said of the heavy conditions. “For sure physically I'm much better than last year since I had to withdraw. The questions are quite the same, so I don't know what to say anymore.”Rybakina’s serve and sharp shot-making has helped her claim three titles in 2024, including Brisbane and Abu Dhabi, but it is her most recent triumph, at Stuttgart, that she takes into the clay court major. Rybakina beat world number one and three-times French Open winner Iga Swiatek in three sets in the semi-finals at Stuttgart to record a form result.The Moscow-born Kazakh, who has a clay court win-loss record of 8-1 this year, has split meetings (1-1) with Sabalenka this season.“The goal is for me to win titles. That's what I want. That's what I'm aiming for,” Rybakina said.","Aryna Sabalenka and Elena Rybakina are the second and fourth seeds in the Roland Garros women’s draw.

Need to clear my head and be ready for Olympics: Rafael Nadal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/french-open/need-to-clear-my-head-and-be-ready-for-olympics-rafael-nadal/articleshow/110506220.cms,"PARIS: The 2024 season was supposed to be Rafael Nadal ’s last in the sport. A curtain call. The tennis world had steeled itself.After a year spent in repairing and rehabbing a repelling body, the 37-year-old was ready to start in Australia in January. Until he wasn’t. More issues. Abdominal, then hip or the other way round. The Spaniard was in an impossible race to get his body ready for Roland Garros . In the end, he was short by a few tournament weeks.In the lead-up to this fortnight’s clay court major, Nadal’s body was falling in step, and in the last week, it allowed him the elasticity to stretch, to go beyond the boundaries of restraint. He was reaching further than he had in two years.It made the 22-time major winner think. Was it time yet, or did he have more steps in those legs? If anything, his straight sets loss to the in-form fourth seed Alexander Zverev late on Monday, was a confirmation.Maverick Frenchman Gael Monfils wasted no time in seconding it. “With what Rafa showed us today,” Monfils said, “he would beat so many in the draw. So many.”For now the goal is the Olympics in July-August at Roland Garros, where he hopes to play singles and doubles.“I need to clear my head and be ready for my main goal which is now to play the Olympics,” he said.The legendary Spaniard was all over the court in the first-round outing here, earning huge approval from fans on Court Philippe Chatrier. Every time his muscular frame swiveled for a sizzling forehand the fans were in a tizzy.Nadal doesn’t want regrets.“At the end, it’s about not having the (competitive) feeling for one year and a half,” he said, “but that I didn't give myself a real chance, because when I started to become a little bit healthier, I stopped.”The press conference room at Roland Garros was straining with moist-eyed adults, who were trying to assemble words for questions to the 14-time champion.“In terms of what's driving me, I'm a simple guy. I enjoy what I do. I’m passionate about sport, I’m passionate about competition. I like to practice, I like to play tennis,” he said. “I'm in a different moment of my personal life too, traveling with my son and wife. I’m enjoying these moments.”“So, if I keep enjoying doing what I’m doing and I feel competitive and healthy, I want to keep going for a while,” Nadal said. “I don't know for how long, but I want to keep going for a while. I need to give myself a little bit longer to see if my level is (getting better) and my body is holding.”“That's why I am not saying I am retiring today,” he finished.In Spanish media circles there’s an understanding that if Nadal’s body holds up he may play next year. It can be a prayer, a hymn, playing on loop. Or as Nadal would say, it’s a true, no?",Rafael Nadal loses in straight sets to Alexander Zverev in first round of French Open. The Spaniard had been expected to retire at the end of the 2014 season. The 22-time major winner says he wants to keep going for a while.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110506208,imgsize-42628,width-400,resizemode-4/110506208.jpg"

The first cut will be very strong, probably in the region of 70,” he said, adding, “we’ll have to see what follows.”Nagal, who was disappointed with his Roland Garros main draw debut, said the goal was to be able to consistently push players ranked in the top-20.“He (Khachanov) was playing almost every point with a lot of intensity,” the 26-year-old said. “That’s something I can work on, where you give opponents very few free points, it’s happening quite a bit from my side.”“The goal is to keep improving,” Nagal said, “keep battling these top-20 players. If I can do that by the end of the year, I will be at the level I want to be competing in. The only way that can happen is to play these kind of players more and more.”","Sumit Nagal will attempt a final push at the Heilbronn ATP Challenger in Germany, starting June 3.

Novak Djokovic began the defense of his French Open title at a rain-soaked Roland Garros on Tuesday, confident that his Grand Slam experience will help him overcome a challenging season.The world number one, aiming for a fourth Roland Garros title and a record-extending 25th major, is experiencing his worst run since 2018.At 37, Djokovic has yet to win a title in 2024 and has not reached a final, with his best performances being semi-final appearances at the Australian Open and the Monte Carlo Masters.His season also included an unfortunate incident in Rome where he was accidentally struck on the head by a metal water bottle, causing nausea and dizziness.Adding to his difficulties, Djokovic suffered from a stomach issue last week in Geneva, where he was knocked out by Czech player Tomas Machac. Despite these setbacks, Djokovic remains hopeful that his experience and determination will see him through the challenges at Roland Garros.""They are rather bumps on the road,"" said Djokovic, who watched his long-time rival and 14-time champion Rafael Nadal bow out of the tournament against Alexander Zverev on Monday.""I have always looked ahead, what is the next challenge, and what it takes for me to be better than I was last week.""When asked to elaborate on his difficulties so far this season, Djokovic opted for discretion.""Various things have been happening in the last couple of months, but I don't want to get into it. I don't want to open Pandora's Box.""What has happened, happened, and it's in the past. I know exactly what I need to do in a Grand Slam environment. I've experienced that 24 times in my career.""On Tuesday, Djokovic will take on French wildcard Pierre-Hugues Herbert who he defeated in their only other previous meeting at the Paris Masters in 2013.Herbert, the world number 142, made the third round in 2018 but hasn't won a match on the main tour this year.There were 40 matches still to complete in the first round when play got underway Tuesday but torrential rain prevented any play on the uncovered outside courts for the first three hours of the programme.Under the roof of Court Philippe Chatrier, Frenchwoman Alize Cornet's career ended with a straight-sets defeat by Zheng Qinwen in her record-extending 69th consecutive Grand Slam appearance.Cornet was no match for China's Australian Open runner-up Zheng, losing 6-2, 6-1.She made her debut at Roland Garros as a 15-year-old in 2005 and has not missed a Grand Slam tournament since the 2006 US Open.Cornet reached a career-high ranking of 11th in 2009 and enjoyed a surprise run to the 2022 Australian Open quarter-finals.""I already cried yesterday watching Rafa,"" said a tearful Cornet after seeing Nadal lose what was likely his last match at the French Open on Monday.On the covered Court Suzanne Lenglen, Elena Rybakina powered into the second round with a 6-2, 6-3 victory over Belgian Greet Minnen.The former Wimbledon champion will next face either three-time Grand Slam champion Angelique Kerber or Dutchwoman Arantxa Rus.Kazakh world number four Rybakina is the only player to defeat tournament favourite Iga Swiatek on clay this season, in the Stuttgart semi-finals in April.Elsewhere on Tuesday, two-time Australian Open champion Aryna Sabalenka gets her bid to reach a first Roland Garros final underway.The world number two has reached at least the semi-finals in each of the past six Grand Slam events.Sabalenka is also the only woman to beat world number one and three-time French Open winner Swiatek in a final on clay -- in Madrid last year -- since the Pole lost her first WTA title decider as a teenager in 2019 at a low-key event in Switzerland.The 26-year-old Sabalenka had never even reached the second week at Roland Garros until last year, when she was knocked out by Karolina Muchova in the semi-finals.""Iga definitely motivates me a lot to get better, and I think I improve so many things just because of her. She kind of like pointed to the things I wasn't good at,"" said Sabalenka who starts her Paris campaign against Russia's Erika Andreeva.Also on court in the men's singles on Tuesday is Argentine qualifier Roman Andres Burruchaga who has sporting success in the blood.His father Jorge famously scored the winning goal for Diego Maradona's Argentina in the 1986 World Cup final against West Germany.Ranked at 144, the 22-year-old is making his Grand Slam debut and takes on Germany's Jan-Lennard Struff.",Novak Djokovic begins defense of French Open title at Roland Garros.

NEW DELHI: Seventh seed Zheng Qinwen powered past Alize Cornet 6-2, 6-1 to advance to the second round of the French Open in Paris on Tuesday, marking a poignant end to Cornet's career at her home Grand Slam .Cornet, 34, who holds the Open era women's record for consecutive major main draw appearances, had previously announced her retirement after this tournament.Despite her singles defeat, Cornet will continue to compete in the women's doubles and mixed doubles events before retiring after almost 20 years as a professional.On a rainy day in Paris, under the roof of Court Philippe Chatrier, Cornet gave her best effort but could not match the power of Zheng, who quickly took control of the match.Zheng, arriving at Roland Garros following a strong performance reaching the Rome quarter-finals, is aiming for her first major title. She dominated the match, breaking Cornet early in the second set and swiftly building a 5-1 lead before closing out the match in style.After the match, Zheng shared a heartfelt hug with Cornet at the net, as the small crowd at the main stadium rose to their feet to applaud the local favorite.
