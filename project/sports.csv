The pattern extends further north

But does dryness alone explain the scale or spread?

DEHRADUN/KULLU/SRINAGAR: For decades, forest fires in the Himalayas followed a predictable calendar. They started simmering in late spring and early summer, when rising temperatures, dry winds and accumulated leaf litter turned forests combustible. Winter, by contrast, was the season of snow, moisture and relative calm. That rhythm has been breaking for the past few years.This winter, forests across Uttarakhand - and increasingly Himachal Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir - have been burning with an intensity and frequency that forest officials and scientists say is no longer an anomaly, but indicative of a shifting ecological pattern. ""Forest fires are part of a natural cycle, but climate variability is compressing and intensifying that cycle,"" said Amit Kumar Verma, senior scientist at Dehradun's Forest Research Institute, who is involved in a five-year study to understand shifting forest fire regimes across the country.Data from Doon-based Forest Survey of India (FSI) shows that since the onset of the winter wildfire season on Nov 1, Uttarakhand has recorded the highest number of fire alerts in the country - 1,756 - surpassing states traditionally more forest fire-prone, such as Maharashtra (1,028), Karnataka (924), Madhya Pradesh (868) and Chhattisgarh (862).While officials emphasise that not every satellite alert translates into an active forest fire, the pattern itself is difficult to dismiss.December, typically a low-fire month, emerged as the most active in the state in nearly three years.Data from Doon-based Forest Survey of India (FSI) shows that since the onset of the winter wildfire season on Nov 1, Uttarakhand has recorded the highest number of fire alerts in the country — 1,756 — surpassing states traditionally more forest fire-prone, such as Maharashtra (1,028), Karnataka (924), Madhya Pradesh (868) and Chhattisgarh (862).While officials emphasise that not every satellite alert translates into an active forest fire, the pattern itself is difficult to dismiss.Dec, typically a low-fire month, emerged as the most active in the state in nearly three years. Forest officials attribute much of the spike to extreme dryness. “We have had a completely rainless December. Moisture levels in forest floors are very low,” a senior official said. Like Uttarakhand, Himachal, too, has not received any rainfall since the first week of October last year, and snowfall has been largely absent from major apple-growing belts such as Kullu, Mandi, Shimla and Chamba. This has led to fires sparking across the state’s forests -- maximum at Shimla forest circle (62), followed by Rampur (16), Mandi (8), the Great Himalayan National Park-Kullu (6), Chamba and Kullu (4 each), and Bilaspur and Wildlife (South) circle (2 each) as per data from the state forest department.Kashmir’s forests have been enduring a harsh, snow-deficient winter too. Fires have been reported across the Valley and the Pir Panjal range, including Uri, Bandipora, Nishat and Poonch. In Dec, a forest guard died while fighting a blaze in south Kashmir’s Anantnag district, and on Jan 12, a forest fire in Poonch triggered a series of landmine explosions along the Line of Control after flames spread into mined areas in Balakote and Mendhar sectors. “There is nearly a 40% snowfall deficit after three consecutive dry winters,” said Mudasir Mehmood, DFO Awantipora. “With no soil moisture, it’s no surprise that grass becomes highly flammable.”Officials point to stubble burning in farms close to forest fringes, biomass and solid waste burning, and in some cases, villagers setting fire to forest floors to encourage fresh grass growth for cattle. Anti-forest activities — including poaching and attempts to flush wildlife from cover — are also cited by forest and wildlife experts as possible reasons.According to former Uttarakhand head of forest force Jairaj, forest fires are rarely driven by a single cause. “In high-altitude areas with valuable wildlife like musk deer, poachers sometimes light fires to corner animals during winter when they are already vulnerable. Climate change adds another layer — everything is dry, and even a small spark can escalate into a big blaze,” he said.What is compounding the situation is that traditional forest management practices have eroded. The gradual decline of grazing and community-led clearing has allowed dry grass and leaf litter to accumulate on the forest floor, creating a potent mix that can erupt into a blaze if a carelessly-thrown beedi or half-lit match comes its way. “Earlier, villagers regularly cleared jungle grass. With migration and alternative livelihoods, that practice is fading,” an official said.On the ground, residents are already feeling the impact. In Jyotirmath (formerly Joshimath), 61-year-old Sarvani Devi has been watching, with a wary eye, smoke spiralling from the forest near her house for the past few days. “If these fires spread, everything will turn to ash. That is our biggest fear. Somehow, these mountains, where we have lived all our lives, don’t feel as pleasant anymore.”","December, typically a low-fire month, emerged as the most active in the state in nearly three years. Uttarakhand has recorded the highest number of fire alerts in the country - 1,756.

‘BJP Won By Betrayal’: Uddhav Thackeray’s First Reaction On Mumbai Civic Poll Results







MUMBAI: Striking a defiant note in the aftermath of the high-stakes civic elections, MNS chief Raj Thackeray on Friday acknowledged the party's below-expectation performance but urged his newly elected corporators to turn municipal houses into battlegrounds against what he described as the ""rule of money power"" and policies detrimental to Marathi interests.Addressing party workers and supporters, Thackeray congratulated elected corporators of both the MNS and Shiv Sena , underlining that the elections were fought in adverse circumstances.""This election was not easy. It was a battle between the power of wealth and power, and it was directed against the Shiv Sena,"" he said, crediting grassroots workers for holding their ground despite the odds.While conceding that the MNS did not secure the kind of mandate it had hoped for, Thackeray made it clear that electoral setbacks would not blunt the party's political edge. ""We are not the kind to get discouraged. Our elected corporators will bury the rulers there,"" he said, adding, that ""if they see anything happening against the Marathi people, they will definitely bring those rulers to book.""Political observers see Thackeray's remarks as a bid to reposition the MNS as a combative force within civic governance rather than merely a player measured by seat tallies.","MNS chief Raj Thackeray urges newly elected corporators to turn municipal houses into battlegrounds.

DMK or TVK? Decoding Congress's alliance dilemma ahead of Tamil Nadu assembly elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dmk-or-tvk-congresss-decision-dilemma-ahead-of-tamil-nadu-assembly-elections/articleshow/126678409.cms,"The Congress has been on the winning side in Tamil Nadu several times, but has not been a part of the DMK government. If the Congress dumps DMK and manages to join a winning combination, it may get a chance to be part of the state government.

The DMK has often been accused of being anti-Hindu and anti-north - with some of its leaders making remarks that often run into controversy. While it helps the DMK in Tamil Nadu, the Congress, being a national ally, is left facing the consequences of these remarks in other parts, where it has high electoral stakes.

For years, Congress was the only national party with a reasonable presence in Tamil Nadu. However, that is changing fast. The BJP is working aggressively to gain ground in the state. The Congress needs to take steps to prevent itself from being swept out of the state politics by the BJP as has happened in several other states.

The DMK which is fighting for a second consecutive term could face anti-incumbency. Several DMK leaders also face corruption charges. These will also impact the Congress adversely even though it is not part of the government and has no say in matters of policy or governance.

The emergence of Vijay’s TVK gives the Congress an option to explore political realignment in the state. The TVK, which is leaving no stone unturned for a debut victory, has already called the Congress a “natural ally.” Actor Vijay’s popularity and his massive rallies have already forced the existing players to take note of his political march.

The Congress alliance with the DMK is stable and time-tested. Congress has gained politically from this alliance winning seats in both assembly and Lok Sabha elections. The two parties have worked together for a long time ironing out differences. If Congress dumps the alliance, it may turn out to be a costly gamble.

The DMK has been a crucial and loyal India-bloc ally for the Congress. With the state sending 39 members to Lok Sabha, Congress has gained from the DMK’s numbers in its national politics. In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the DMK won 22 seats.

The Congress lacks the kind of cadre support and organisational strength needed to pursue independent politics in Tamil Nadu. Its vote share in the state has been on the decline in assembly elections.

Vijay the actor may be very popular, but Vijay the politician remains an untested novice. Huge crowds in rallies may not translate into votes when Tamil Nadu goes to polls to elect a new assembly in some months. If Vijay fails, like Prashant Kishor did in Bihar, Congress will end up losing a stable long-term ally without any political gains. Since AIADMK is already tied up with the BJP, the Congress may be pushed to oblivion.

NEW DELHI: The Congress is finally in action mode in Tamil Nadu. After a weekend brainstorming with party chief Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi in the national capital, the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee has convened a crucial Executive Committee meeting tomorrow to focus on preparations for the upcoming 2026 Tamil Nadu assembly elections.But the important question is: Has the Congress finalised its direction in the state? Will the grand-old party continue with its long-term ally the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam ( DMK ), which has refused to share power if the alliance wins the upcoming assembly elections? Or will the Congress explore the possibility of a new coalition in the state by joining hands with actor-politician Vijay ’s TVK?The Congress-DMK alliance in Tamil Nadu faces one of its toughest challenges from within. According to reports, the Congress leadership has asked the state unit leaders to maintain alliance discipline and avoid confrontational political posturing against the long-standing and “trusted” ally. The directive on the importance of unity comes amid some very strong remarks made by a section of the state Congress after DMK rejected the idea of a coalition government.Congress MP Manickam Tagore was the first to float the idea of power sharing when he said that time had come to discuss sharing of power in the state with DMK.When the DMK said “no” to this, the Congress leader took potshots at the regional ally and also accused it of intolerance towards coalition partners.“We do not say ‘bye-bye’ to allies after elections,” Manickam Tagore said in a hard-hitting social media post. The Congress leader cited the example of United Democratic Front (UDF), the Congress-led coalition in Kerala, to school the DMK on “coalition dharma.” In a series of Pongal messages, Tagore contrasted what he described as the DMK’s “centralised mindset” with the inclusive and consultative UDF model practised in Kerala. “No betrayal after elections, no breaking alliances after counting votes. That is the UDF difference,” he said, describing it as “coalition dharma in action”.Tagore said Kerala UDF offers a hopeful template for coalition politics, where the Congress leads without monopolising authority. Power, he stressed, is shared rather than concentrated.The DMK is yet to react to this raised pitch by the Congress, which has till now played second fiddle to its regional ally. Even in 2006 when the DMK had fallen short of majority winning 96 seats, the Congress with 34 elected members supported DMK’s minority government without joining it.The Congress’s electoral fortunes in Tamil Nadu have been intertwined with the DMK since the two parties came together. Whenever the DMK has done well, the Congress has also gained, and vice versa.The grand-old party has seen a steady decline in its vote share in the state from 9.3% in 2011 to 4.27% in the 2021 assembly elections. So, has the time come for the Congress to rethink its Tamil Nadu strategy? Here are the pros and cons of the grand-old party considering a political realignment in the state.PROSCONSFor the Congress leadership, any decision on DMK alliance in Tamil Nadu will be tricky. While on the one hand, it will be tempted to experiment with Vijay’s TVK for greater political gains, on the other, it would be wary of its decision turning into a costly gamble.","The Congress has been on the winning side in Tamil Nadu several times, but has not been a part of the DMK government.

NEW DELHI: An American woman faced a shocking incident of sexual harassment on the Delhi Metro when a teenage boy groped her after she agreed to a photo. The boy's mother and sister defended his actions, claiming he was simply curious about blondes.Gaurav Sabnis, an Indian-origin professor at New Jersey's Stevens Institute of Technology, shared the woman's account on X. He had warned his former student to stay cautious during her India trip for a friend's wedding, especially in Delhi where she might draw unwanted attention as a white .""When this former student called me in November for suggestions for her India trip for a friend's wedding, I told her, be on guard for sexual harassment.

Sadly, it came true,"" Sabnis wrote, posting a screenshot of her text.The woman described the ordeal: “While my colleagues and hosts were great and I had a fun memorable 8 days in India, there was one unfortunate and ugly incident. That just soured my mood so much that I was withdrawn and depressed for a couple of days.”""A teenage boy, maybe 14 or 15, at a Delhi Metro station just ruined it forever.He was with his mom and sister so thought okay why not.

In fact I'm going to give all of South Asia a pass.""Social media users condemned the family's defense as enabling and victim-blaming. Many highlighted molestation as a serious crime and suggested filing a complaint, while other Indians apologised .on behalf of the boy and his family.One wrote, ""I know exactly what you mean. Whenever my daughter travelled in India, she was left deeply bewildered—why people spoke to her while staring at her chest instead of meeting her eyes, why they asked for selfies as if she were an object rather than a person, and why so many felt entitled to touch, feel, or grab her. The experience was confusing, unsettling, and profoundly violating.""Another said, ""Most unfortunate. The over protective mother’s reaction is highly condemnable and a major factor in moulding the way men behave.""A third commented, ""Victim blaming is a common thing in North India especially"" and ""“Overreacting"" what a disgusting reaction from the lady, instead of reprimanding her kid.""","An American woman faced a shocking incident of sexual harassment on the Delhi Metro when a teenage boy groped her after she agreed to a photo.

The BJP playbook, in numbers



Splits weaken rivals without eliminating them.

Welfare delivery triumphs identity-based vote banks.

Seat conversion efficiency rewards consolidation.

Narrative control nationalises elections.

The larger picture



When results from Maharashtra's long-delayed civic polls came on January 16, it became clear that the Bhartiya Janata Party ( BJP ) has made it to the top once again. The BJP swept 1,425 of 2,869 seats across 29 municipal corporations, a strike rate of nearly 50%. In Mumbai's Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), a Shiv Sena citadel for 25 years, slipped out of regional control.Since 2014, the BJP's rise has not dismantled regional politics outright. Instead, it has steadily shrunk the space in which regional parties operate, limiting their ability to convert votes into seats, state power into national leverage and identity politics into a sustained election issue.Let's take a look at how that containment has unfolded, state by state.Recent civic polls in Maharashtra offer a clear snapshot of regional parties containment in action.In the January 2026 civic elections, the BJP emerged as the single largest party across major urban bodies. In Mumbai’s BMC, it won 89 of 227 wards on its own. With ally Eknath Shinde’s faction of the Shiv Sena adding another 29, the ruling Mahayuti crossed the majority mark. Uddhav Thackeray ’s Shiv Sena (UBT) was reduced to 65 seats, down from more than 130 in 2017.Across the state, the picture was bleaker for regional forces. In Pune Municipal Corporation, the BJP crossed 110 seats, while the combined strength of the two Pawars - Sharad and Ajit Pawar - remained in double digits.Pimpri-Chinchwad, another Nationalist Congress Party bastion, delivered 87 seats to the BJP.These civic polls were delayed for nearly nine years due to legal and administrative hurdles.The BJP framed its campaign around the idea of a ""triple-engine sarkaar"", led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the Centre and Devendra Fadnavis at the state level. Welfare schemes such as 'Majhi Ladki Bahin' found traction among women voters, while youth backing was decisive: nearly 47% of voters aged 18–25 reportedly favoured the BJP.But the most decisive factor was political fragmentation.The 2022 Shiv Sena split turned Shinde into a BJP ally, hollowing out the party’s organisational spine. The 2023 NCP fracture left Sharad Pawar and Ajit Pawar competing for the same shrinking base. Even Uddhav Thackeray’s tactical alliance with the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) split Marathi identity votes in dozens of wards, indirectly benefiting the BJP.In Bihar, the regional parties have not been eliminated, but absorbed and subordinated within a BJP-led political framework.In 2025 Bihar assembly elections, the NDA won over 200 of 243 seats, its most decisive victory in the state in decades. Within that, the BJP emerged as the single largest party, overtaking chief minister Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United) in numerical strength for the first time.Seat data underlined the altered balance of power.The BJP secured 89 seats, while JD(U) followed with 85 seats. Smaller allies such as the Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), Hindustani Awam Morcha and Rashtriya Lok Morcha added to the NDA tally. In contrast, the opposition collapsed. The Rashtriya Janata Dal, which had won 75 seats in 2020, was reduced to roughly 25 seats, while the Congress slipped to single digits.For regional parties in Bihar, this was not merely a defeat. It was a reordering.Nitish Kumar retained the chief ministership, but the arithmetic left little ambiguity. Power within the alliance now flows from the BJP outward, not the other way around. JD(U), once the pivot of Bihar politics and a perennial kingmaker in Delhi, now operates within limits defined by its larger partner.The RJD’s trajectory is equally telling. Tejashwi Yadav's party got the highest vote share of 23% in the elections: BJP - 20.08%, JD(U) - 19.25%.Despite retaining a loyal base among Muslims and Yadavs, the vote share did not translate into seats.Welfare schemes, infrastructure expansion and caste-neutral messaging from the NDA fractured older social coalitions.Bihar results show a crucial feature of the BJP's containment strategy: regional parties are allowed to survive, but not to dominate.Containment here does not mean extinction.It means subordination — a shift from being the senior partner to alliance dependents in a political order anchored firmly by the BJP.In India’s most populous state, the BJP’s containment strategy has played out through electoral arithmetic.In 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP-led NDA won 64 of 80 seats. On the other hand, Akhilesh Yadav's Samajwadi Party , despite being opposition in the 2022 assembly with 111 of 403 seats, struggled to expand its footprint. The Bahujan Samaj Party, once a pivotal force, was reduced to near irrelevance, winning just one seat.Vote shares tell a revealing story. BJP got around 36% vote share in 2024, while Samajwadi part got near 29%.This gap was widened by welfare politics. Schemes such as PM Awas Yojana, free rations and direct benefit transfers helped the BJP get more votes.Construction of Ram Temple in Ayodhya also helped consolidate Hindu votes across caste.The Trinamool Congress remains dominant in West Bengal, but the BJP is up for the challenge.In the 2021 assembly elections, TMC won 213 of 294 seats. In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, it retained 29 of 42 seats, getting around 45% of vote share. The BJP, however, consolidated itself as the principal challenger, holding roughly 23% of the vote share.The trajectory matters. BJP’s vote share surged from 18% in 2019 to nearly 38% in the 2021 assembly polls, driven by defections, organisational expansion and polarised campaigning. While welfare schemes such as Lakshmir Bhandar helped TMC stabilise its base, urban Kolkata and tribal belts like Jangalmahal saw growing BJP penetration.Mamata Banerjee remains powerful within the state. But will she continue to enjoy this power for log? We will know in a few months as Bengal votes for its next assembly.The 2025 Delhi assembly elections marked a turning point.The BJP won 48 of 70 seats, ending a decade of rule by the Aam Aadmi Party and reclaiming the capital after nearly 27 years. AAP’s vote share remained competitive, but BJP’s organisational depth, candidate spread and campaign scale ensured superior seat conversion.For AAP, the loss was existential. Once projected as a governance-driven alternative with national ambitions, it now faces questions about relevance beyond Punjab. Delhi’s verdict showed that even a high-visibility regional model can be overwhelmed by a national party’s machinery.Odisha saw one of the sharpest collapses. In 2019, the Biju Janata Dal won 113 of 147 assembly seats. By 2024, BJP swept 20 of 21 Lok Sabha seats and won 78 assembly seats, ending Naveen Patnaik’s long rule. Leadership vacuum and BJP’s appropriation of Odia identity accelerated the fall.In Andhra Pradesh, the YSR Congress Party’s dominance evaporated in 2024, when a TDP-BJP-JSP alliance won 135 of 175 assembly seats, pushing YSRCP to the margins despite a significant residual vote share.Both states show how quickly regional dominance can collapse when organisational depth and narrative control shift.Tamil Nadu remains the clearest exception.In the 2021 assembly elections, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam won 133 of 234 seats. In 2024, the DMK-led alliance secured 22 of 39 Lok Sabha seats. BJP’s vote share remains in single digits.Strong linguistic identity, entrenched welfare politics and the legacy of Dravidian ideology have limited BJP’s expansion. Seat conversion for regional parties remains efficient, and internal splits have so far been avoided.Kerala’s alternating Left and Congress coalitions continue to resist national consolidation. BJP’s vote share hovers around 11–15%, with limited seat gains despite a strong cadre base.High political literacy, entrenched welfare systems and cohesive minority blocs have constrained BJP’s growth. Yet even here, regional dominance remains confined within state borders, offering little national leverage.Nationally, the BJP-led NDA governs 19 states and is currently at its highest-ever strength in atate assemblies. The BJP alone presently has 1654 MLAs across state assemblies.Regional parties together hold roughhly about 31% of MLAs.BJP's containment strategy is consistent:Urbanisation, aspirational voting and fatigue with dynastic feuds have amplified these effects.India's regional parties are not extinct. They still win elections and govern states. But the data since 2014 shows their power is increasingly bounded.Civic routs in Maharashtra, the fall of AAP in Delhi, and reversals in Odisha and Andhra Pradesh all point to the same conclusion: the pathway from state power to national influence has narrowed dramatically.As 2026 assembly elections approach in five states and UT, the challenge for regional parties is no longer survival alone. It is to reinvent in current political climate. Will Mamata Banerjee and MK Stalin be able to hold their grounds or will the BJP push their parties to the wall? We will know by mid-year.","Since 2014, the BJP's rise has not dismantled regional politics outright. Instead, it has steadily shrunk the space in which regional parties operate. This has limited their ability to convert votes into seats, state power into national leverage and identity politics into a sustained election issue. Recent civic polls in Maharashtra offer a snapshot of regional parties containment in action.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126682951,imgsize-1587217,width-400,resizemode-4/file-photo-of-pm-modi39s-election-rally.jpg"

Bill Belichick returns to TV as ESPN adds him to national title broadcast

Bill Belichick is back on television. Just weeks after finishing a difficult first college football season at the University of North Carolina, the 73-year-old coaching legend has landed a new role with ESPN. The network confirmed that Bill Belichick will appear on the ACC Network’s broadcast of the College Football Playoff national championship game, set to be played in South Florida at Hard Rock Stadium.The game will feature the Indiana Hoosiers against the University of Miami Hurricanes and is scheduled for a 7:30 p.m. kickoff. ESPN announced that Belichick will be part of the on-air team, marking his return to TV while he continues working as head coach of the Tar Heels in Chapel Hill.ESPN said Bill Belichick will be paired with former Miami and Georgia head coach Mark Richt for the ACC Network’s coverage.The move comes only weeks after North Carolina ended a rough season with a 4–8 record, missing both a bowl game and the expanded College Football Playoff.Belichick became North Carolina’s head coach in 2025, taking his first job at the college level after leaving the New England Patriots following the 2024 NFL season.Before going to Chapel Hill, he spent months on television. He appeared on “Monday Night Football’s ManningCast” with Peyton Manning and Eli Manning and also made regular appearances on The Pat McAfee Show.Now, Bill Belichick is mixing both worlds. He is still leading North Carolina’s rebuild, but he is also stepping back into the media spotlight.ESPN’s announcement said the move brings “one of football’s greatest minds” back to the broadcast booth.Bill Belichick is the only head coach in NFL history to win six Super Bowls with one team. He also won two more Super Bowls as a defensive coordinator with the New York Giants.While returning to television, Bill Belichick has stayed busy on the recruiting trail. One of his biggest recent moves was bringing in quarterback Billy Edwards Jr. to Chapel Hill.ESPN’s Pete Thamel reported that Edwards chose North Carolina after being granted a medical redshirt, giving him one more year of college eligibility.Billy Edwards Jr., a Virginia native, transferred to Wisconsin in August 2025 after playing at Maryland.He later suffered a knee injury and missed the rest of the season. Now, he will compete with Gio Lopez for the Tar Heels’ starting job.He will also work under Belichick and new offensive coordinator Bobby Petrino, another longtime NFL coach.The addition matters for a North Carolina team that struggled badly. The Tar Heels beat only two Power Four teams, Syracuse and Stanford, during the 2025 season.Off the field, Belichick has also faced attention around his personal life, including heavy media focus on his relationship with Jordon Hudson.Despite the noise, sources around the program say Belichick has stayed locked in on recruiting and player development.North Carolina will next hold its spring game on April 12 at Kenan Stadium, where fans will get their first look at the new roster.",Bill Belichick will appear on the ACC Network’s broadcast of the College Football Playoff national championship game.

The Miami Heat visit the Golden State Warriors on January 19, 2026, for a matchup that carries weight for both teams as the season moves deeper. The game will be played at Chase Center, where Golden State has been steady, while Miami continues a challenging road stretch.Both teams are dealing with injuries that affect rotation decisions and game planning. Several key players are either out or not fully cleared, which puts more responsibility on the healthy core and forces adjustments on both sides.Miami Heat’s backcourt is short-handed. Tyler Herro is out with a rib injury and did not travel with the team. His absence removes one of Miami’s main scoring options and limits spacing on offense.Jaime Jaquez Jr. is questionable with a left knee sprain. When available, he has averaged 15.9 points and provided balance on both ends of the floor. Davion Mitchell is also questionable due to a left shoulder contusion, leaving Miami thin at guard.With those concerns, Miami is expected to rely heavily on Bam Adebayo and Norman Powell. Adebayo continues to be a steady presence inside, averaging 17 points and nine rebounds.Powell has been the team’s most consistent scorer at 23.8 points per game and will likely see extended usage.Golden State Warriors is also missing rotation pieces. De’Anthony Melton remains out as he manages his left knee following ACL surgery. Gui Santos will miss his second straight game with a left ankle sprain. Seth Curry is still sidelined due to left sciatic nerve irritation.Draymond Green is listed as probable with a right ankle sprain. His status matters, as his defense and decision-making affect how Golden State controls the game. Stephen Curry is available and expected to lead the offense as usual.Without Herro, Miami’s offense will depend more on Butler and Powell creating shots against pressure defense. Ball movement and defensive stops will be key if the Heat want to stay close.Golden State, sitting at 24–19, will lean on home court and shooting. The Warriors are favored by 5.5 points, with the total set at 239.5. If Green plays, Golden State gains an edge defensively. If not, the game could stay tight.Also read: Is Stephen Curry playing tonight vs the Miami Heat? Latest update on the Golden State Warriors star's injury report (January 19, 2026) With injuries shaping both rotations, the game is likely decided by execution and depth rather than lineup strength alone.

What the New York Mets Gain and Weighing Risks

The New York Mets are adjusting after parting ways with a player who spent nearly a decade with the organization. With Brandon Nimmo now in Texas, the front office is focused on finding a short-term outfield option that limits spending and avoids long-term commitments.That approach has led them to Max Kepler. He is not viewed as a marquee signing but as a steady replacement. A reported one-year deal worth $7.6 million would give the Mets reliable defense and left-handed power while preserving roster flexibility.The New York Mets’ direction changed after a one-for-one trade with the Texas Rangers sent Nimmo to Texas in exchange for second baseman Marcus Semien. Nimmo waived his full no-trade clause to complete the deal, ending his eight-year, $162 million tenure in New York.Nimmo was still productive in 2025. He appeared in 143 games and hit .261 with 23 home runs and 82 RBIs.Even so, the Mets chose to address their infield and manage payroll. Semien now anchors second base, but the trade left a clear vacancy in left field.Max Kepler became a free agent after a one-year, $10 million season with Philadelphia that was limited by knee issues. His surface numbers declined, but the Mets value his defense and remaining power. In 2025, he ranked among the league’s best outfield arms and fits cleanly into a corner role.A short-term deal also matches the Mets’ plans. Prospect Carson Benge is expected to push for a larger role soon, and Max Kepler would fill the gap without blocking that path. The lower salary compared to Nimmo’s deal also leaves room to address pitching.Max Kepler would bring reliable defense in the corner outfield, a strong arm, and pop against right-handed pitching without a big price tag. His expected salary is well below Brandon Nimmo’s yearly average, giving the Mets a way to add value while staying mindful of the luxury tax.The concerns are durability and age. Kepler is in his mid-30s and coming off a down year. He also does not solve the center-field situation long term, leaving the Mets to rely on internal options.Also read: MLB trade rumors: Cincinnati Reds predicted to sign $10.2 million New York Yankees; Brady Singer key trade asset? Even with those risks, the move fits the moment.

Michael Jordan built his empire through Air Jordan

Global heavyweights chasing the crown

When the debate over the Greatest of All Time erupts in day-to-day conversation and on social media, it usually revolves around rings, MVPs, and clutch shots. However, the financial rankings from Celebrity Net Worth have settled a different kind of GOAT debate: the one happening in the bank. NBA legend Michael Jordan has officially topped the list of the world's richest athletes with a net worth surging past $3 billion, cementing his status as a global sports giant. Other international icons have also made an appearance in the top 10, but the NBA's presence is a testament to how basketball has transcended the rectangle and has become one of the most lucrative businesses.As per Celebrity Net Worth, Michael Jordan currently sits at an estimated net worth of $3.5 billion, making him the richest sportsman in the world. But this staggering wealth didn’t just come from his legendary NBA career but is the result of a masterclass in marketing and brand building. From his multi-billion-dollar Jordan Brand under Nike to selling the Charlotte Hornets for approximately $3 billion, Michael Jordan has set a blueprint that would be tough to replicate.But he isn't alone in the Top 10, though. LeBron James also sits comfortably at 8th as the only active NBA player in the top tier with a net worth of $1.2 billion.His off-court ventures include the SpringHill Company and strategic stakes in sports teams like Liverpool FC. Also joining this list at 9 is Magic Johnson, whose Magic Johnson Enterprises has turned him into a $1 billion mogul. When you look at the Top 10, the NBA’s trio, Jordan, LeBron, and Magic, highlights a specific trend: basketball stars are evolving into venture capitalists faster than they can hit a step-back three.While the NBA royalty holds the crown, the rest of the Top 10 is a battlefield of global icons. Names like Cristiano Ronaldo (5th) and Lionel Messi (7th) represent the massive football (soccer) economy, both hovering around the $1.2 billion to $850 million mark. Ending the top 10 is Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson with a staggering $800 million net worth.The disparity at the very top is what’s truly shocking. Jordan’s $3.5 billion valuation puts him in a level of his own, showcasing how brand power can help you reach the billionaire’s club long after you have bid goodbye to the hardwood.","NBA legend Michael Jordan has officially topped the list of the world's richest athletes with a net worth surging past $3 billion.

What happened to Patrick Mahomes?

Why experts want the Chiefs to slow down

Patrick Mahomes needs to 'temper expectations' with injury comeback | Pro Football Talk | NFL on NBC

Patrick Mahomes’ recovery from a serious knee injury has become one of the biggest stories of the NFL right now. The Kansas City Chiefs quarterback tore both his ACL and LCL late in the 2025 season and had surgery in December. While Mahomes hopes to return for Week 1 of the 2026 season, many experts believe the team should not rush his comeback.With the Chiefs entering a crucial rebuilding phase after missing the playoffs, the decision around Mahomes’ recovery timeline could shape their entire season.Mahomes suffered the injury in Week 15 against the Los Angeles Chargers. While trying to extend a play, he was hit and his left knee bent awkwardly. He needed help leaving the field, and later scans confirmed torn ACL and LCL ligaments.The injury ended his season and marked the first major long-term injury of his NFL career. Kansas City finished the year with a disappointing record and failed to make the playoffs for the first time since 2014.Mahomes underwent surgery in mid-December and has been rehabbing under the supervision of the team’s medical staff. Despite the seriousness of the injury, Mahomes remains confident.In a recent update, he said doctors believe he could be ready for the season opener.“I want to be ready for Week 1,” Mahomes said during a Zoom call. “That’s the goal to play with no restrictions.”He added that he hopes to take part in offseason workouts and training camp if his recovery continues to go well.Not everyone agrees with Mahomes’ timeline. Pro Football Talk’s Mike Florio has urged caution, saying that returning quickly from a late-season ACL tear is very difficult.Florio explained that Mahomes’ playing style makes the situation even riskier. Unlike many quarterbacks, Mahomes relies heavily on movement, scrambling, quick cuts, and throwing on the run. All of this puts extra pressure on the knee.“You want to be very sure that knee is fully healthy before he starts doing all those special things again,” Florio said.Michael Holley also warned that Mahomes is the kind of player who will try to push himself back early, even if he is not fully ready. Because of this, he believes the Chiefs must protect their star quarterback.For the Chiefs, the bigger concern is not just getting Mahomes back on the field, but making sure he is fully fit for the long term. Kansas City missed the playoffs for the first time since 2014, and the 2026 season is seen as a reset year for the team. Rushing Mahomes back too soon could risk another injury and hurt their future plans.For now, Mahomes remains positive and focused on rehab. But the message from experts is clear: patience may be the smartest move. The Chiefs’ success depends not just on Mahomes returning quickly, but on him returning healthy.","Patrick Mahomes tore his ACL and LCL late in the 2025 season. The Kansas City Chiefs quarterback hopes to return for the 2026 season. Many experts believe the team should not rush his comeback.

Tyreek Hill drops a cryptic response amid facing a tough time with his estranged wife, Keeta Vaccaro



Keeta Vaccaro has been accused of making luxury purchases with Tyreek Hill’s money



Tyreek Hill, one of the most popular and talented players in the league, had a pretty tough time in the field this season due to his brutal injury. The Miami Dolphins’ star player is also facing a difficult time in his personal life after his estranged wife, Keeta Vaccaro, accused him of domestic violence.Amid all the mess, Tyreek Hill has shared a cryptic note about his future in the league, as his wife, Keeta Vaccaro, has been accused of recklessly spending his money.A few days ago, Tyreek Hill took to his social media to answer a fan texting him, “I miss you at KC (Kansas City Chiefs) Reek…”To this, the Miami Dolphins’ star player recorded a video as he replied, “We’ll see what happens in the offseason…”But that’s not all; in the last few hours, Tyreek Hill has also posted throwback stories of him taking the field in the Kansas City Chiefs’ jersey.This has sparked chaos among fans as many feel that Tyreek Hill might be aiming to return to the Kansas City Chiefs.Tyreek Hill’s cryptic response comes at a time when his estranged wife, Keeta Vaccaro, has been blasted by a Florida court judge for spending thousands of dollars on luxury purchases.This includes a swanky Bentley which Keeta Vaccaro bought with Tyreek Hill’s money after the two separated last year.As per US Weekly, the judge noted that, “The court finds the additional $96,000 to purchase a vehicle was excessive and unnecessary…”The judge added, “The court finds that the wife’s ‘wants’ are exorbitant and well above the maintenance required to support her during the” pending divorce.The judge continued, “In addition to this new award of $5,500 per month in temporary alimony, Mr. Hill has been ordered to continue to pay approximately $20,000 per month in household expenses at the Porsche Tower Condominium, monthly child support of $3500 and to continue to provide health insurance for [Keeta] and their child.”However, neither Tyreek Hill nor his estranged wife, Keeta Vaccaro, has issued a statements about this yet.","Tyreek Hill makes a cryptic comment about his future as estranged wife Keeta Vaccaro faces backlash over luxury purchases.

NHL Trade Rumors: New York Rangers signal sell-off as Calgary Flames consider more deadline moves,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-rumors-new-york-rangers-signal-sell-off-as-calgary-flames-consider-more-deadline-moves/articleshow/126706895.cms,"New York Rangers signal sell-off as Calgary Flames consider more deadline moves (Image Via Twitter

Why are New York Rangers selling and could Calgary Flames make another big move?

NHL Now | What's next for the New York Rangers?

The most recent NHL gossip has brought the New York Rangers and Calgary Flames right in the middle of the trade deadline talk. With the uncertainty regarding the team’s direction, salary cap flexibility, and long-term plans all coming to the surface, both teams seem to be going through some very important transitions. The market now could really change the future of each team a lot and also cause a redistribution of power across the league.The New York Rangers team manager, Chris Drury, was very open about the organization’s direction, which made that reality clearer. He was indicating that there is a readiness to pull back from the present roster. On the other hand, the Calgary Flames’ recent trading activity is viewed as a signal that more trades could follow, particularly in the case of veteran forwards who are still attractive to other teams in the league.Drury’s letter to the fans, which was made public on Friday, probably confirmed the many suspicions: New York is getting ready to retool. Drury said that the idea is to bring in young NHL players and prospects that are fast, skilled, and have a winning mindset, along with the creation of long-term salary cap flexibility. The note was reminiscent of the 2018 “Letter” era and got some fans to call it “Letter 2.0.” Drury further said that players who have participated in recent long playoff runs might be traded.Vincent Z. Mercogliano of The Athletic has mentioned that the uncertainty surrounds many big names. Artemi Panarin has been told that he will not be offered a contract extension and will become a UFA on July 1, while Drury is reportedly willing to assist a trade if Panarin lifts his no-movement clause. On the other hand, Mika Zibanejad has assured the team of his loyalty, thus making a deadline deal less likely. Vincent Trocheck, together with Alexis Lafreniere and Braden Schneider, is also getting interest from teams that want to trade.In the meantime, the trade of Rasmus Andersson by the Flames to Vegas has sparked more rumors in Calgary. Daniel Austin of the Calgary Sun opines that the veterans Nazem Kadri and Blake Coleman might be next as the Flames consider trading established players for future assets.The Rangers are changing their strategy, whereas the Flames are not yet done; thus, this trade season could result in massive changes. Both franchises seem to be prepared to make daring moves that could shape their future.","The New York Rangers team manager, Chris Drury, was very open about the organization’s direction.

Why Viktor Arvidsson and Alex Steeves are gaining long-term value in Boston Bruins

Bruins Trade Talks HEATING UP... Bruins Trade IMMINENT | Boston Bruins News

The recent rumors about the NHL related to the Boston Bruins are becoming more and more intense as the team still works on its roster. The securing of Jonathan Aspirot on a new deal has already brought our focus to the other team members whose contracts may be extended, and who have made a positive impact this season. Several players will be free agents within a year, and Boston's management is facing difficult choices ahead as they try to balance current performance, team spirit, and plans effectively.The recent decision of the Bruins to extend Aspirot has sent a straightforward signal: steady performance will receive a reward. According to league watchers and the news circulating, the management is now in the process of determining which players belong in the long-term vision of the organization. There are two players, especially, whose on-ice production and increasing significance within the team make them stand out.Viktor Arvidsson is the name that comes up often when people talk about the potential players to be traded from the Boston Bruins. The 30-year-old winger has made his way into the top six quietly and has been nothing but a dependable asset. So far, in 37 games this season, he has scored 11 goals and made 25 points and has a plus-10.Besides, he is currently enjoying a terrific stint with a point streak stretched to seven games, which consists of four goals and four assists. This period marks an offensive flow and good cooperation with the team’s main strikers. People in the league think that the veteran's support and regularity will be a good reason for the Bruins to keep him if the conditions are right.The player with the most potential among the impenetrable options is Alex Steeves. Initially, he was considered only as a minor addition to the roster, but soon the perception changed dramatically. So far, in 32 matches with the Boston team, the left winger has scored eight goals and made 14 points, besides being the source of the team’s physical play. His number of hits - 112 - speaks for the energy and toughness Steeves brings with him on the court during every game, and this is the very quality that the Bruins would like to have in their team during the playoffs when the games are so tight that they have no choice but to pull the trigger. Observers even suggest that his ability to play in different positions and his hard work could be the reasons behind his getting a longer stay with the team.The Bruins are planning to keep more of their important players after securing Jonathan Aspirot already. If the trend of getting good production and consistency continues, then the duo of Viktor Arvidsson and Alex Steeves might be the next ones to get contract extensions.","The Boston Bruins are planning to keep more of their important players after securing Jonathan Aspirot already.

Andrei Vasilevsky’s achievement tops Tampa Bay’s sensational season with more records

Andrei Vasilevskiy added another prestigious accomplishment to his already impressive resume on Sunday afternoon. The Tampa Bay Lightning goaltender became just the sixth netminder in NHL history to record 10 consecutive 20-win seasons.Vasilevskiy achieved the milestone during Tampa Bay's 4-1 victory over the Dallas Stars at American Airlines Center. The win extended the Lightning's point streak to 13 games while improving their record to 30-13-4 on the season.The 31-year-old Russian joined an exclusive club that includes only Hockey Hall of Famers and future inductees. Henrik Lundqvist, Martin Brodeur, Tony Esposito, Chris Osgood, and Jacques Plante represent the only other goaltenders to accomplish the feat.The company Vasilevskiy now keeps speaks volumes about his sustained excellence since becoming Tampa Bay's starting goaltender. He's posted at least 20 wins in every season since taking over the starting role before the 2016-17 campaign.Vasilevskiy made 19 saves against Dallas to earn his 20th victory of the 2025-26 season. The performance represented another workmanlike effort from the two-time Stanley Cup champion who has been a model of consistency throughout his career.Lightning head coach Jon Cooper praised his team's effort following the victory. ""This is game five of a five-game trip. Basically, we played nine games in nine different cities,"" Cooper said. ""For the guys to take all but an overtime loss in one, I've got to tip my cap to them. It's been a pretty good effort by them.""Tampa Bay has been one of the NHL's hottest teams throughout the past month. The Lightning have collected points in 13 consecutive games, with Vasilevskiy providing the steady presence in goal that has become his trademark.The victory over Dallas represented a crucial two points against one of the Western Conference's top teams. Dallas grabbed an early 1-0 lead before Tampa Bay rallied with goals from Brandon Hagel and others to secure the win.Forward Darren Raddysh appreciated his team's response after falling behind. ""I liked our response,"" Raddysh said. ""We went down one, but we stuck to our game plan and wanted to make them defend. I thought we did pretty well in the first period there and continued in the second and third.""Vasilevskiy's consistent excellence has been the foundation of Tampa Bay's success throughout his tenure. Since joining the franchise in 2012, the Russian netminder has slowly cemented himself as one of the league’s elite goaltenders with two Stanley Cups, one Conn Smythe trophy, and a Vezina Trophy to his name.Even now at 31, he remains as lethal between the pipes as he was during the Lightning’s back-to-back championship wins back in 2020 and 2021.",Andrei Vasilevskiy became just the sixth goaltender in NHL history to record 10 consecutive 20-win seasons.

Lindsey Vonn Podiums in Italy🇮🇹Just Weeks Before Italian Olympics | Tarvisio Downhill

Emma Aicher wins as challengers rise and risks unfold



Lindsey Vonn, the four-time overall World Cup champion and Olympic gold medalist, delivered another strong performance on Sunday by finishing second in the women’s World Cup super-G in Tarvisio, Italy. The 41-year-old American earned her seventh podium finish in eight speed races this season, showing a level of consistency no other speed skier has matched as the Winter Olympics draw closer.Lindsey Vonn, the most decorated American alpine skier of all time, missed the win by just 0.27 seconds as Germany’s Emma Aicher took first place. The race was held on the Prampero course, where fog and poor visibility made conditions difficult, especially on the upper section. With the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics starting in less than three weeks, the result strengthens Vonn’s position as a top medal contender in downhill and super-G.Lindsey Vonn, known for her experience and control in speed events, led Emma Aicher at every checkpoint before losing time in the final gates. Even with the narrow loss, her worst result this season is still only fourth place. No other skier in the speed events has more than three podium finishes, highlighting how steady and reliable Vonn has been during this high-pressure Olympic season.Emma Aicher, a rising German alpine skier, claimed the super-G victory for her second win of the season and the fourth of her World Cup career. Born in Sweden to a Swedish mother and a German father, Aicher is one of the few athletes who competes in all four alpine skiing disciplines, showing rare versatility at a young age.Emma Aicher, the youngest skier on the podium, finished ahead of a strong and experienced field. Ester Ledecka, the Olympic champion famous for winning gold medals in both skiing and snowboarding, finished third to earn her first podium of the season. France’s Romane Miradoli placed fourth, while American Keely Cashman achieved the best result of her career by finishing fifth.Alice Robinson, the New Zealand skier who has won multiple races this season, added drama late in the event after crashing into the final gate and hitting the snow hard. Robinson stood up quickly and appeared to avoid serious injury, though she looked shaken after the fall.The women’s World Cup circuit now moves to Kronplatz in Italy for a giant slalom before one final speed race weekend in Crans-Montana, Switzerland. Italy is also watching closely as Federica Brignone, the defending overall World Cup champion, considers a return after recovering from a serious leg injury.Also Read: Lindsey Vonn stuns fans with shocking body transformation ahead of Winter Olympics 2026 return","Lindsey Vonn finished second in the women's World Cup super-G in Tarvisio, Italy.

Patrick Reed remains ineligible but continues with the worldwide golf plan

Patrick Reed, the 2018 Masters champion and LIV Golf player, said he would consider returning to the PGA Tour if given the chance, calling it the best tour in the world. Reed made the comments in Dubai, where he is starting his 2026 season by playing three DP World Tour events before the LIV Golf season begins next month.Patrick Reed is in the Middle East as part of his goal to compete around the world, a commitment to the DP World Tour and Asian Tour that has helped him remain ranked No. 41 in the Official World Golf Ranking despite LIV Golf events not offering ranking points. Earlier this month, after completing a demanding 32-event season in 2025, Reed was resting when news broke that Brooks Koepka was returning to the PGA Tour through the newly created Returning Member Program, which only Koepka, Cameron Smith, Bryson DeChambeau, and Jon Rahm were eligible for, with the latter three choosing to remain on LIV Golf.Patrick Reed is not eligible for the Returning Member Program because his Masters victory came in 2018, before LIV Golf began. Reed has played on LIV since its first season in 2022 and has one individual victory in 45 starts. Asked at the Dubai Invitational on Saturday if he would return to the PGA Tour if allowed, Reed said he would play everywhere and joked that he is already competing on three tours.Patrick Reed played a full global schedule in 2025, including 14 LIV Golf events, four major championships, 10 DP World Tour tournaments, and four Asian Tour events.Since winning the Masters, Reed has remained competitive in majors, finishing fourth at the 2018 U.S. Open at Shinnecock, 10th at the 2019 Open Championship, top-10 at Augusta in 2020 and 2021, T-4 at the Masters in 2023, and T-3 last year after contending late on Sunday.Patrick Reed is a nine-time PGA Tour winner and received an honorary life membership on the DP World Tour in 2019. Starting in 2026, Reed may need to pay fines for LIV events that clash with DP World Tour tournaments. The fine amounts are unknown, and according to The Telegraph, LIV will no longer pay them. Reed said he is willing to pay and hopes the issue is resolved because he has always wanted to be a worldwide player.",Patrick Reed says he would consider a return to the PGA Tour if given the chance.

Jorge Mateo joins Atlanta Braves after Ha-Seong Kim ruled out for months

Jorge Mateo is officially headed to Atlanta. On Monday, January 19, 2026, the Atlanta Braves agreed to a one-year, $1 million contract with the free-agent infielder and outfielder, the team announced in Atlanta, Georgia. The move comes at a critical time for the Braves, just one day after the team confirmed that shortstop Ha-Seong Kim will miss several months after finger surgery.Ha-Seong Kim suffered a torn tendon in the middle finger of his right hand and is expected to be out for four to five months. With the season approaching and a major gap in the infield, the Braves acted quickly. Signing Jorge Mateo gives Atlanta a flexible player who can cover both the infield and outfield while Kim recovers.The Braves shared on Sunday, January 18, that Ha-Seong Kim underwent surgery to repair a torn tendon in his right middle finger. Doctors expect him to miss most of the first half of the season.Losing their starting shortstop forced the front office to look for fast help, and Jorge Mateo became their answer. Jorge Mateo, 30, brings speed, experience, and defensive range.Six seasons in the big leagues under his belt, he has suited up for both the San Diego Padres and the Baltimore Orioles.Atlanta values his capacity to cover shortstop, second base, or the outfield depending on daily needs by allowing him to move throughout the field.The Braves did not release contract bonuses, but the deal is confirmed as a one-year agreement worth $1 million. The signing allows Atlanta to stay flexible while waiting for Ha-Seong Kim’s return later in the year.Jorge Mateo’s 2025 season with the Baltimore Orioles was limited. He appeared in 42 games and recorded 83 plate appearances. He hit .177 with one home run and three runs batted in.His season was interrupted between June 6 and September 5 because of left elbow inflammation, which kept him off the field for nearly three months.Even with those struggles, the Braves see value in Mateo’s speed and glove. Over his career, Jorge Mateo owns a .221 batting average with 30 home runs and 121 RBIs across stints with the San Diego Padres from 2020 to 2021 and the Baltimore Orioles afterward.His defensive flexibility and baserunning also set him apart, characteristics Atlanta has usually prized. This is a low-risk signing with potential upside for the Braves.Should Mateo settle into his stride, he could become a consistent fill-in as Ha-Seong Kim heals. Otherwise, the short-term agreement lets Atlanta keep investigating possibilities.With spring training nearing, the Braves now turn their focus to reshaping the infield. Jorge Mateo arrives not as a star replacement, but as a needed piece in a moment where depth matters most.","Jorge Mateo joins Atlanta Braves after shortstop Ha-Seong Kim ruled out for months after finger surgery.

A single play overshadows a strong season and raises questions about accountability

The Chicago Bears’ promising postseason run came to a sudden and tragic end Sunday night, and the final moments left a lot to be desired for the team due to crucial mistakes. A 20-17 overtime loss to the Los Angeles Rams in the divisional round shifted the focus from what the Bears accomplished this season to how it ended.Much focus was given to wide receiver DJ Moore, whose role in a crucial overtime miscue infamously drew attention across the league. Adding to the tension, Moore was reportedly not present in the locker room when media interviews began. For a team that leaned heavily on accountability and chemistry throughout its NFC North title run, it was a moment that Bears fans want to forget.The decisive play came on second and eight in overtime, with Caleb Williams releasing a pass that was picked off by Rams safety Kam Curl, setting up the drive that sealed Chicago’s elimination. The issue appeared to stem from a big miscommunication as Moore ran a vertical route, while Williams expected him to flatten underneath the safety.After the game, Williams addressed the moment directly. He said, “I’ve got to go back and watch it, obviously haven’t seen it. ... Had D.J. going over the top over all of it. Just a miscommunication between him and I. Tried to flatten him off under the safety, and he kept it vertical, from what I saw in the moment.”Still, Moore’s absence from the locker room did not go unnoticed. Reports quickly spread that he was unavailable when reporters entered, which fueled criticism from former players and analysts. Terrell Owens was among those who believed Moore should have faced the media and addressed the play.On the field, Moore delivered a solid performance, catching five passes for 52 yards and a touchdown on eight targets, while also adding eight rushing yards. Williams finished 23 of 42 for 257 yards, two touchdowns, and three interceptions, while also contributing 40 rushing yards. Neither player had a ‘great’ night per se, but both were instrumental in Chicago’s rise this season.",The Chicago Bears lost 20-17 to the Los Angeles Rams in overtime.

Oscar De La Hoya stresses loyalty as Vergil Ortiz Jr dispute deepens



Oscar De La Hoya is once again facing tension with one of his fighters. Months after his public fallout with Ryan Garcia, the Golden Boy Promotions boss finds himself in another high-profile dispute. This time, it involves unbeaten interim light middleweight champion Vergil Ortiz Jr. The issue centers on the failed negotiations for a much-anticipated fight against Jaron “Boots” Ennis. As talks collapsed, legal action soon followed.Ortiz Jr has now filed a lawsuit against Golden Boy Promotions, accusing the company of breaching their contract. The situation escalated after De La Hoya sent a legal notice to Ortiz’s management for negotiating the fight independently. With deadlines missed, DAZN growing unhappy, and Eddie Hearn’s Matchroom Boxing unable to close the deal, the conflict has turned into a major promotional standoff.As the legal battle unfolds, Oscar De La Hoya took to social media to share his views on a fighter’s career and loyalty. Drawing from his own experience, he reminded fighters that careers are short and focus is vital. On his Instagram story, he wrote fighters must remain loyal and trust guidance from those who have already walked the same path.He added that he sees himself as someone who has lived that life and wants to protect fighters from costly mistakes.De La Hoya later expanded on the emotional side of promotion. He explained that his biggest satisfaction comes from building strong bonds with fighters and feeling that trust is returned. Vergil Ortiz Jr has been with Golden Boy since turning professional in 2016 but now wants to exit the deal, claiming interference with his expected earnings from the Jaron “Boots” Ennis fight.According to Ortiz’s legal team, uncertainty over Golden Boy’s agreement with DAZN gives him the right to seek separation. De La Hoya, however, insists his intentions were misunderstood. He said he was only pushing for better money for Ortiz. He explained that he demanded a 60-40 purse split in Ortiz’s favor, along with a small bonus for the winner, because he felt his fighter had earned it.When Matchroom failed to meet the deadline, Ortiz’s manager reportedly stepped in to negotiate directly. That move triggered De La Hoya’s legal response. Golden Boy has since stated it will strongly contest the lawsuit, maintaining the contract is valid and claiming Ortiz and his team violated its terms.","Vergil Ortiz Jr has filed a lawsuit against Golden Boy Promotions.

Bill Maher Clashes With Lara Trump After She Downplays Trump’s ‘Piggy’ Insult On Air Force One

Social media responds with warmth and nostalgia

How a shared family moment cut through public tension





Lara Trump has recently bestowed upon social media participants a rare treat with a glimpse into the less familiar, more personal side of the Trump family. Through the sharing of just a few images on X, she has reached the hearts of many with this intimate family picture involving her young daughter's fun-filled golf game with her grandfather, US President Donald Trump himself, with whom she gets to spend quality time while playing their favourite game, golf. This is one instance where the family, known for its political fervour, has been accepted with such fervour not for their political ideology but for this common family experience that speaks volumes about their humanity despite their fame and power, resonating widely with audiences who cherish authentic, tender moments beyond politics.The photographs depicted Donald Trump behind the wheel of a golf cart, with his granddaughter sitting alongside him, looking happy and carefree. Moreover, there were no signs of poses or dramatic settings, only a serene capture of moments spent with each other. The informal nature of this post was a major factor that led to its success. The post was not meant for any particular message or statement, but only for a casual share by Lara Trump. The post succeeded in gathering tens of thousands of views, not because it was political or held any significance, but because it was something that was widely understood.The online response was largely positive, with many people describing the photographs as “wholesome” and “heartwarming”. Several users reflected on the special bond between grandparents and grandchildren, sharing how the images stirred personal memories and emotions. One user wrote, “What a great moment for her! My kids miss their Gramps,” while another commented, “Core memory unlocked!”, capturing the sense of nostalgia the post evoked. Others reacted more light-heartedly, with remarks such as, “Awww, I was wondering what Grandpa Trump was up to today!” and “Cutest thing I have seen all day.”Part of the post’s impact lay in its timing and tone. At a moment when public discourse is often polarised, the photographs presented a version of public life stripped of commentary and conflict. They highlighted how figures who dominate global headlines also occupy familiar family roles, such as grandparents enjoying simple moments with their loved ones.","Lara Trump has shared intimate family photos on social media.

After T20 World Cup Move, Bangladesh Now Bans IPL 2026 Broadcast Amid Mustafizur Rahman Row

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has stopped preparations for the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026 amid uncertainty over Bangladesh’s participation in the tournament, scheduled to be held next month in India and Sri Lanka. The move follows Pakistan’s support for Bangladesh’s demand that its matches be shifted out of India.According to a report by Pakistani news outlet Geo News, the PCB halted preparations after Pakistan backed Bangladesh’s decision not to travel to India for its World Cup matches. Pakistan has indicated that it could reconsider its own participation if the issue remains unresolved.The development followed talks between officials from Dhaka and Islamabad on Saturday, during which Pakistan expressed full support for Bangladesh’s stance, citing security concerns. PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi, who is also Pakistan’s interior minister and a Senator, was involved in the discussions.Geo News reported, quoting sources, that Pakistan would review its participation in the tournament if Bangladesh’s concerns are not addressed.The crisis began after Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman was withdrawn from the 2026 Indian Premier League on the BCCI’s instructions, citing unspecified ""developments all around.""Since then, discussions between the ICC and the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) have failed to produce a resolution.The BCB has stated that Bangladesh will not travel to India for its group matches in Kolkata and Mumbai, citing ""security concerns"".With the tournament schedule already finalised, the ICC has shown reluctance to move Bangladesh’s matches to Sri Lanka, the co-host nation, where the India-Pakistan match is scheduled to be held under the existing agreement for ICC events until 2027.If Bangladesh does not take part in the tournament, Scotland is likely to be named as the replacement team based on current rankings. Bangladesh are scheduled to play three league matches in Kolkata and one in Mumbai.The BCB has insisted on either a venue change or a group change so that its matches can be played in Sri Lanka. Bangladesh are currently placed in Group C along with West Indies, Italy, England and Nepal.In its last meeting with ICC officials in Dhaka, the BCB proposed swapping places with Ireland in Group B, which includes Sri Lanka, Australia, Oman and Zimbabwe. This would allow Bangladesh to play all its league matches in Sri Lanka.""…the possibility of moving Bangladesh to a different group as a means of facilitating the matter with minimum logistical adjustments was discussed,"" the BCB said after the meeting on Saturday.While the BCB has said it considers travel to India unsafe for its players, the ICC’s risk assessment report has not identified any specific or direct threat to the Bangladesh team’s participation in the tournament.",Pakistan Cricket Board stops preparations for ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2026.

Shubman Gill on missed chances, fielding lapses & World Cup preparation after ODI series loss

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli ’s bat once again became the loudest response after India lost the three-match ODI series against New Zealand 1-2, with the former captain’s elder brother Vikas Kohli taking a pointed swipe at critics questioning the great’s choices late in his career.India went down by 41 runs in the series decider in Indore, but Kohli stood tall amid the collapse, producing a sublime 124 while chasing a daunting 338. Across the three matches, the 37-year-old amassed 240 runs at an average of 80, with scores of 93, 23 and 124, underlining his enduring dominance in the format.The knock came days after former India batter and commentator Sanjay Manjrekar questioned Kohli’s decision to retire from Test cricket and continue in what he described as the “easy” format of ODIs. The remark, made during the fifth Ashes Test in Sydney where Joe Root and Steve Smith struck centuries, drew widespread criticism from fans.Vikas Kohli joined the chorus on Sunday, soon after Virat registered his 54th ODI hundred and 85th international ton. In a post on Threads that has since gone viral, he aimed a sharp barb at Manjrekar. “I wonder if Mr Expert of cricket has some suggestions for the easiest form of cricket.You need to be there to do that. Anyways, as I said, Easier said than done,” he wrote.The numbers back the sentiment. In Kohli’s last six ODIs, he has scored three centuries and two half-centuries. He also struck a hundred and a fifty for Delhi in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, silencing doubts about his motivation after stepping away from Tests.Kohli will next feature in India colours in July 2026 during the England ODI tour. Before that, he will turn his focus to IPL 2026, aiming to help Royal Challengers Bengaluru defend their title.",Vikas Kohli hits back at critics of his brother's decision to retire from Test cricket.

Bangladesh cricket in turmoil: What it means for the T20 World Cup?

NEW DELHI: There have been no talks between the global cricket governing body, ICC, and Scotland about replacing Bangladesh at next month’s ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026, according to a report from BBC.The report suggests that the position is clear for now. But Scottish players are ready if a call ever comes.Bangladesh have told the ICC they will not travel to India for the tournament. They have raised concerns over political tensions between the two countries and asked for their matches to be moved to Sri Lanka, the co-hosts.Scotland are currently the highest-ranked team not playing in the upcoming T20 World Cup. This puts them in line as a possible replacement if Bangladesh pull out.However, a report from BBC suggests that the ICC has not contacted Cricket Scotland yet.Scottish officials are also not planning to approach the ICC. They say this is out of respect for the Bangladesh Cricket Board.Scotland missed out on qualification for the 2026 T20 World Cup after finishing fourth in last summer’s Europe Qualifier. The Netherlands and Italy took the two available spots.Scotland are ranked 14th in ICC T20 rankings. With players back in training, they are preparing for a one-day tri-series against Namibia and Oman in March.Reports suggest a final decision on Bangladesh’s participation could come soon.The ICC has not clarified how it would choose a replacement if a team withdraws.In 2009, Zimbabwe pulled out of the T20 World Cup, and Scotland replaced them. That system no longer applies clearly due to regional qualification.The BCB has already denied reports of a January 21 deadline from ICC. Director Amzad Hossain explained what happened in talks with the ICC.""Last Saturday, January 17, an ICC representative came. A meeting was held with a delegation from our Cricket Board. There, we clearly conveyed our position regarding the World Cup participation and informed them that we are unable to play at the specified venue, and we requested an alternative venue. A detailed discussion took place with their representative. At that time, they told us that they would inform the ICC about these matters and later communicate the decision to us.

Most hundreds vs NZ (ODIs)

NEW DELHI: Run-machine Virat Kohli once again proved why he remains the heartbeat of India’s ODI batting, producing a majestic century against New Zealand in the third and final match of the series on Sunday. In a chase that looked to be slipping away early, Kohli stood tall, registering his record-extending 54th ODI hundred - 85th overall in international cricket, and keeping India’s hopes alive deep into the innings.This knock also carried historic significance. Kohli, who finished the match with 12,662 runs batting at number three in ODIs, has now gone past Australian great Ricky Ponting ’s tally of 12,655 to become the highest run-scorer in the format at that crucial position.7 - Virat Kohli (36 inns)*6 - Ricky Ponting (50 inns)6 - Virender Sehwag (23 inns)5 - Sachin Tendulkar (41 inns)5 - Sanath Jayasuriya (45 inns)Kohli also climbed to the top of another elite list. He now has the most ODI hundreds against New Zealand, with seven centuries in just 36 innings. Only Ricky Ponting and Virender Sehwag come close, with six each, while legends Sachin Tendulkar and Sanath Jayasuriya finished with five apiece.The century came at a critical moment. India were reeling at 71 for four after New Zealand posted a daunting 337 for eight. On a wicket that demanded composure, Kohli opted for control and persistence. He brought up his hundred with a single off Zak Foulkes on the final ball of the 40th over, having struck eight fours and two sixes in a 91-ball innings.It marked a landmark across formats and conditions. This was Kohli’s 85th international century, his 54th in ODIs, his 41st on Indian soil, and his seventh against New Zealand. He now has seven or more ODI hundreds against five different opponents, with 10 against Sri Lanka, nine against West Indies, eight against Australia, and seven each against South Africa and New Zealand.After missing out on a hundred in the series opener at Vadodara, where he fell for 93, Kohli made sure there was no repeat. He held one end firmly and built partnerships that dragged India back into the contest.The revival began with Nitish Kumar Reddy, who scored 53. Their 88-run stand for the fifth wicket restored belief before Kohli accelerated further alongside Harshit Rana. The pair added 99 runs in just 69 balls, with Rana contributing a fluent 52 off 43 deliveries.As long as Kohli remained at the crease, the sense persisted that another miracle was still possible. He eventually fell for a valiant 124 off 108 balls, a moment that effectively ended India’s chase. Until then, though, he had ensured belief never faded.The result may not have gone India’s way, but Kohli’s innings stood out as a reminder of his enduring greatness and his unmatched ability to make the impossible feel within reach.","Virat Kohli scores record-extending 54th ODI hundred against New Zealand.

Shubman Gill on missed chances, fielding lapses & World Cup preparation after ODI series loss

Poll Is it time for India to explore new talents in ODIs over seniors? Yes, fresh blood is needed. No, experience matters. A mix of both would be ideal. It depends on performance.

INDORE: India’s maiden ODI home series defeat to New Zealand here at the Holkar Stadium saw Virat Kohli, who smashed 124 off 108 balls in the last match, come out with flying colours. However, two other ageing modern-day greats are firmly under the scanner. Ravindra Jadeja and Rohit Sharma had a poor series, which doesn’t help with younger options snapping at their heels.The 37-year-old Jadeja went wicketless. In fact, in his last five ODIs, the Saurashtra allrounder has only managed to take one wicket. Jadeja’s leftarm spin, which once both stopped the run flow and provided crucial breakthroughs, seems to have lost its bite. Remember, T20I vice-captain Axar Patel , a like-for-like replacement, is waiting in the wings.Sreevats Goswami, who shared the dressing room with Jadeja in the 2008 U-19 World Cup that India won under Virat Kohli’s leadership, even posted on social media that the third ODI against New Zealand may well have been Jadeja’s last in the 50-over format. “We should celebrate him before he silently exits, because India play their next ODI only in June against England in England,” Goswami posted.Apart from his bowling, Jadeja has failed to make any significant contribution with the bat as well.Jadeja and fellow spinner Kuldeep Yadav’s inability to grab wickets in the middleovers was one of the key reasons for India being vanquished 2-1 by the Black Caps.Meanwhile, the debate around whether Rohit would play in the 2027 ODI World Cup was supposed to have ended after he put together a series of good scores against Australia (away) and then South Africa (home). That run included a match-winning century (121*) against Australia in Sydney, apart from three fifties. One even got to see a slimmed-down version of Rohit, indicating that he had worked a lot on his fitness.The 38-year-old’s decision to continue in ODIs has meant that left-hander Yashavi Jaiswal, who scored his maiden ODI century in the third ODI against South Africa in Vizag last Dec, has had to cool his heels in the dugout.Rohit will turn 39 on April 30 and is he motivated enough to keep playing only one format in international cricket?However, captain Shubman Gill defended his opening partner, saying, “Rohit is in terrific form, right through from the Australia to the South Africa series. You won’t always be able to convert the starts that you get.”","Ravindra Jadeja and Rohit Sharma had a poor series, which doesn't help with younger options snapping at their heels. Jadeja’s leftarm spin, which once both stopped the run flow and provided crucial breakthroughs, seems to have lost its bite. The debate around whether Rohit would play in the 2027 ODI World Cup was supposed to have ended.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126756418,imgsize-91662,width-400,resizemode-4/jadeja-amp-rohit.jpg"

“He supports Trump”: Travis Kelce’s Donald Trump comment draws backlash and raises questions about Taylor Swift reaction,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/he-supports-trump-travis-kelces-donald-trump-comment-draws-backlash-and-raises-questions-about-taylor-swift-reaction/articleshow/126642463.cms,"Travis Kelce’s pre-Super-Bowl comment calling it an honour to play before the president sparked political backlash. With Donald Trump attending, fans questioned Taylor Swift’s stance. Insiders said Swift was unfazed, stressing Travis Kelce praised the office, not Trump himself. No tension followed. Swift focused on supporting Kelce as the Chiefs chased another Super Bowl title amid intense media scrutiny worldwide buzz.

Taylor Swift’s reaction to Travis Kelce’s Donald Trump comment is not what fans expected

As the Super Bowl spotlight burned brighter than ever, one comment from Travis Kelce quietly set off a ripple across sports and pop culture. Last year, just days before kickoff, Kansas City Chiefs star, Travis Kelce described it as an “honour” to play with the sitting U.S. president in attendance. The remark landed in the middle of a politically charged moment and instantly drew reaction far beyond football circles.With Taylor Swift preparing to watch the biggest game of the year from the stands, fans wondered if Kelce’s words would create tension. Swift’s history of vocal political views made the speculation louder. Instead of drama, the situation unfolded in a far calmer and more revealing way..Kelce’s comments came ahead of Super Bowl LIX last year, where the Chiefs faced the Philadelphia Eagles in New Orleans with Donald Trump in the attendance. When asked by the reporters about how he felt playing infront of the president, Kelce said: ""It's awesome. It's a great honour, I think no matter who the President is. I'm excited because it's the biggest game of my life and having the President there, it's the best country in the world so it's pretty cool.Those words were quickly framed by some as political alignment. Behind the scenes, that narrative never gained traction. According to people close to Swift, she viewed the comment exactly as Kelce intended it. A statement of respect for the office, not an endorsement of the individual.According to the Daily Mail, a source said, ""Taylor is not angry at Travis for what he said. Although Travis’s quote was taken as he supports Trump, this is not what Travis said at all.”The source added, “He never actually even said the word Trump. Travis was speaking on behalf of his entire team and all of his fans when he said it is an honor to have the President of the United States at the game and he would have said the same thing regardless of who the president was.”“So no, there is no fight, no argument and no blowout over this. Taylor is just so proud of Travis and cannot wait to be there to support him. Cheering him on has become so exciting for her. Taylor is Travis's biggest cheerleader.""In the end, the story revealed less about politics and more about perspective. For Swift, the focus stayed where it mattered. In the game, the moment, and the person she showed up to support.","Travis Kelce’s pre-Super-Bowl comment calling it an honour to play before the president sparked political backlash.
