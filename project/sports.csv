Jason Kelce banned by ESPN from YouTube’s Chargers vs Chiefs coverage after enforcement of strict new rules,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/jason-kelce-banned-by-espn-from-youtubes-chargers-vs-chiefs-coverage-after-enforcement-of-strict-new-rules/articleshow/123593254.cms,"Jason Kelce (Getty Images)

ESPN restricts Jason Kelce from making guest appearance

Why YouTube wanted Jason Kelce for Chiefs opener



The NFL’s 2025 season opener between the Los Angeles Chargers and Kansas City Chiefs is shaping up to be a spectacle — not just on the field but also behind the scenes in the broadcast world. While YouTube secured a Hall of Fame quarterback to headline its exclusive coverage of the Week 1 clash in São Paulo, Brazil, fans hoping to see Jason Kelce join the stream will be left disappointed.According to Ryan Glasspiegel of Front Office Sports, YouTube approached Jason Kelce about appearing on its coverage of the highly anticipated Chargers-Chiefs matchup. The former Philadelphia Eagles center, now a rising media personality, seemed like a natural fit given his strong ties to the Chiefs through his brother, Travis Kelce . However, ESPN reportedly blocked the move.Travis Kelce, who signed a multi-year contract with ESPN last year to serve as an analyst on Monday Night Football, is restricted by a new company policy. The network has decided that on-air talent will no longer be permitted to appear on coverage from competitors such as YouTube or Netflix.Interestingly, this is a shift from last season when ESPN allowed Mina Kimes and Laura Rutledge to take part in Netflix’s Christmas Day doubleheader studio show.But with streaming platforms increasingly entering the live sports space, ESPN appears to be tightening control over its personalities.It’s easy to see why YouTube pursued Jason Kelce. His “New Heights” podcast with brother Travis has exploded in popularity, drawing even bigger attention recently with Taylor Swift ’s appearance. The pop icon’s relationship with Travis Kelce has amplified media buzz, making Jason a hot commodity for any NFL-related broadcast.Also Read: Tom Brady's son Jack ditches stepmom Gisele Bündchen for special outing with his birth mother Bridget Moynahan While Jason Kelce won’t be part of the opener, the Kansas City Chiefs-Los Angles Chargers clash still promises major storylines — from Justin Herbert leading the Chargers’ new-look offense to Patrick Mahomes beginning Kansas City’s title defense. But for fans of the Kelce brothers, it’s clear ESPN’s decision leaves a noticeable gap in YouTube’s coverage.Kelce played college football for the Cincinnati Bearcats and was selected by the Eagles in the sixth round of the 2011 NFL draft. He won Super Bowl LII, was a seven-time Pro Bowl selection, and six-time first-team All-Pro selection. Kelce is often regarded as one of the greatest centers in NFL history.","YouTube wanted Jason Kelce to join its coverage of the Chargers-Chiefs opener. ESPN reportedly blocked the move.

Tom Brady’s emotional birthday post reminds fans of his bond with Jack



Celebrity families often turn heads when they step out in public, and that was the case at this year’s US Open when actress Bridget Moynahan attended courtside with her son, Jack. The outing came less than a week after NFL legend Tom Brady marked Jack’s milestone 18th birthday with an emotional social media post.On Wednesday, Bridget Moynahan posted a selfie from Arthur Ashe Stadium, capturing the tennis action and her special night with Jack. She captioned the photo, “Traditions at the US Open. Thank you Emirates for hosting an incredible night of tennis.”The sighting added to the significance of the week, as it followed Jack’s birthday celebrations on August 22. Jack, born in 2007, has grown up in the public eye as the son of Brady and Moynahan, who dated from 2004 to 2006.Six days earlier, Tom Brady had shared a heartfelt tribute to his eldest son. “From little steps to big dreams, happy birthday Jack. You’ve always shown grace, courage, love, and kindness since the day you were born. I’m so proud of the man you are! Welcome to adulthood—it comes with higher credit card limits, bigger bills, and no curfew… well, maybe not all at once!”He added, “A dad’s heart soars with his children’s happiness, not with his own.We love you so much, and I know this will be your best year yet.”Also Read: “He was stunned”: Tom Brady was blindsided when Gisele Bündchen revealed she was expecting Joaquim Valente’s child Tom Brady and Bridget Moynahan’s relationship ended before Jack’s birth, yet both have maintained a respectful co-parenting dynamic over the years.

Jordon Hudson makes stylish UNC debut appearance with Randy Moss supporting Bill Belichick on the sidelines



Bill Belichick’s past and present collide as attention intensifies



Bill Belichick stepped onto the college football stage Monday night as the North Carolina Tar Heels faced TCU, but the attention wasn’t solely on the six-time Super Bowl champion coach. Instead, much of the spotlight turned toward his 24-year-old girlfriend, Jordan Hudson, who once again managed to spark conversation before kickoff. For a man known for his iron-clad focus, Belichick’s debut is proving to be as much about life off the field as on it.At 73, Belichick is entering uncharted territory with his move from the NFL to college football, yet his presence has already elevated UNC’s visibility. Alumni royalty like Lawrence Taylor and Michael Jordan were expected in the stands, while Hall of Famer Randy Moss stood beside Hudson on the sidelines in a casual UNC fit. Moss, of course, shared the field with Belichick during his Patriots era from 2007 to 2010, a reminder of the legacy the coach brings to Chapel Hill.But even as Belichick begins charting a new chapter, narratives about his personal life follow closely.Hudson, a former Miss Maine contestant who once finished third in the pageant, first grabbed headlines when HBO’s Hard Knocks exposed antics that cost the university $200,000. Clips of her and Belichick engaging in playful acrobatics on the beach have only added to the chatter. Their 49-year age difference has kept tabloids buzzing, and sightings of Belichick sneaking out shirtless from Hudson’s Airbnb haven’t quieted the noise.If Hudson draws headlines now, Belichick’s former partner, Linda Holliday, isn’t far from the narrative either. Just days before UNC’s showdown with TCU, Holliday was seen on a Martha’s Vineyard boat trip, decked in Tar Heel blue and white. At 62, she has kept a relatively low profile since the split but seemed to channel the same school spirit that now surrounds Belichick’s new journey.For all the off-field drama, the real intrigue lies in how Belichick adapts to the college game. His track record with the Patriots remains untouchable, but UNC presents a new challenge — one where recruiting, development, and NCAA politics replace draft boards and free agency. Whether his debut season will be remembered for football achievements or the noise surrounding his personal life is a storyline that will unfold week by week.Also Read: “PLAY THIS AT THE WEDDING”: Travis Kelce’s past confession about Katy Perry sparks awkward moment for Taylor Swift fans","Bill Belichick stepped onto the college football stage Monday night as the North Carolina Tar Heels faced TCU.

A painful night that tested Colorado’s spirit

Coach Prime’s calm words steady shaken emotions

Shedeur’s private rallying cry to his father

Regrouping together to answer the season’s challenge

The Colorado Buffaloes’ opening night against Georgia Tech ended in a narrow 27–20 defeat, but the loss carried a weight that went far beyond the scoreboard. In the aftermath, it wasn’t just Coach Prime’s words at the podium that mattered. It was a seven-word family message from his son, Cleveland Browns quarterback Shedeur Sanders, that underscored the family’s bond and demand for accountability.Colorado’s defense forced three first-quarter turnovers but failed to convert them into momentum. The Buffaloes finished with just one offensive touchdown, while Georgia Tech’s Haynes King gashed them for 156 rushing yards. In total, Colorado gave up 320 rushing yards—numbers that highlight a recurring weakness from last season. The result left fans and analysts questioning whether the Buffaloes can rise above the same flaws that haunted them in 2024.Deion Sanders took the setback in stride, choosing to focus on positives rather than panic. “I’m optimistic on everything. We’re definitely gonna be fine. We could’ve won that game. It’s not like we got our butts kicked,” he said afterward. His tone echoed the resilience he has preached since Colorado’s rebuild began, but behind closed doors, his son delivered a sterner call.Now an NFL rookie in Cleveland, Shedeur has transitioned from son to leader. Hours after the game, he typed a pointed reminder in the family’s group chat: “As SANDERS MEN we have to regroup.” The message symbolized a deeper expectation—that the Sanders legacy is measured not by setbacks, but by how swiftly they respond to them.For the Sanders family, football is a proving ground of character. Shilo continues to fight for his NFL shot, while Shedeur grows into his professional role. Next up for Colorado is Nebraska, a chance to turn frustration into fuel. Whether that private message becomes a turning point will depend on how the Buffaloes answer their own quarterback’s rallying cry.Shedeur's words remind Deion that family always wins, showing that even in defeat, love, resilience, and unwavering support can lift spirits, inspire growth, and keep the Sanders legacy strong and united, proving that together they face challenges, celebrate victories, and build a bond that goes far beyond the football field.Also read: Chicago Bears fifth-round rookie Zah Frazier will sit out 2025 season after personal issue emerges","Colorado Buffaloes lost 27-20 to Georgia Tech in their opening game of the season.

Micah Parsons consoles young Cowboys fan after emotional reaction



Micah Parsons embraces pressure with Packers’ record contract



When the Dallas Cowboys stunned the NFL world by trading Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers, emotions ran high. Fans felt betrayed, pundits questioned Jerry Jones’ move, and a viral clip of a young supporter crying captured that heartbreak. Yet, what stood out was Parsons’ heartfelt response—FaceTiming the child, offering encouragement, and promising a Packers jersey with his iconic No. 1. In that moment, Parsons showed the human side of a blockbuster trade.The trade didn’t just impact analysts and fantasy football rosters—it hit fans on a deeply personal level. One viral TikTok video captured the raw emotion of a young Cowboys fan, filmed by his mother Lesley, breaking down in tears after learning Parsons had been dealt away. What followed turned into one of the most heartwarming moments of the offseason.Parsons himself saw the clip, reached out, and later FaceTimed the devastated child. His words were both empathetic and motivational: “I saw that video, I’m sorry, bruh. I hope you know, in life, things happen that you can’t control, but you just got to keep going.”The four-time Pro Bowler didn’t stop there. He promised the boy a brand-new Packers jersey with his No.1 on it. “Even though you’re a big Cowboys fan, I hope that you still follow me and my career, because that’s what it’s all about. Passionate fans. That just meant a lot to me. I hope you know that.” He even playfully reminded the youngster to focus on school, joking that bad grades might cost him the jersey.For the fan, it was a tough lesson in the business side of sports, but also a reminder that heroes can be human too.The Cowboys received a haul—two future first-round picks and defensive tackle Kenny Clark—in exchange for Parsons. Meanwhile, Green Bay wasted no time, signing him to a four-year, $188 million extension, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in league history.At his Green Bay introduction, Parsons admitted the reality of the deal hadn’t fully sunk in. “I didn’t think I would be traded,” he said. “But that’s the harsh reality.” Still, he embraced the pressure, noting: “I’d be a fool to not think that there isn’t expectations… But then again, that’s a blessing in itself, that means that they believe in me that much.”Parsons’ first test comes quickly: a month from now, he’ll return to Dallas in a Packers uniform, staring down the very fans who once cheered his every sack.Also Read: Patrick Mahomes teases Travis Kelce with geography joke ahead of Chiefs’ season opener in Brazil","Micah Parsons was traded by the Dallas Cowboys to the Green Bay Packers.

Tyreek Hill left off Dolphins’ captain list amid rising doubts



The Miami Dolphins may soon face one of the biggest decisions of the season — whether to part ways with their superstar wide receiver, Tyreek Hill. On ESPN’s Get Up this week, NFL insider Dan Graziano hinted that Hill’s name could surface in trade talks if Miami stumbles early. With the regular season just around the corner, questions surrounding Hill’s role and future with the franchise are louder than ever.Graziano didn’t mince words when discussing Miami’s outlook. “If they fall out of it, he’ll be a name we’re talking about in October, you know, at the trade deadline, I think,” he said. While noting that the Dolphins plan to move forward with Hill, Graziano emphasized that a midseason slide could force Miami to reconsider.Former NFL offensive lineman Damien Woody painted an even bleaker picture. Highlighting the exodus of key leaders, Woody said: “Four of their captains from last year are no longer on the team. Right. Jalen Ramsey, gone. The quarterback and star wide receiver they’re not in the greatest of places. There is bad mojo in Miami right now. That’s just the way I look at it.”The Dolphins indeed lost significant locker-room voices in Calais Campbell, Terron Armstead, and David Long Jr.Without that leadership core, doubts remain about whether this team can stay competitive in the AFC.Fueling speculation further, Miami recently announced its 2025 team captains — and Hill’s name was absent. For the first time in three seasons, the star wideout won’t be wearing the captain’s “C.” Instead, Tua Tagovailoa, Aaron Brewer, and Alec Ingold will lead the offense, while Jordyn Brooks, Zach Sieler, and Bradley Chubb captain the defense.This omission, paired with Hill’s offseason trade chatter and his walk-back from “I’m out” comments last year, underscores the uncertainty hanging over his future. While he remains on the roster for now, his long-term place in Miami seems fragile.As the Dolphins prepare for kickoff, the spotlight is firmly on Hill. If the team falters early, the trade deadline could reshape both his career and Miami’s trajectory. For now, fans can only wait and watch whether Tyreek Hill remains the centerpiece of the Dolphins’ offense or becomes the most sought-after trade chip of the season.Also Read: Micah Parsons FaceTimes heartbroken Cowboys fan after trade, promises he will still make him proud in Green Bay","NFL insider Dan Graziano says Tyreek Hill's name could surface in trade talks if Miami stumbles early.

The September 1 edition of Monday Night RAW will see the aftermath of the spectacular show that was Clash in Paris. Only a day after the August 31st show, WWE is back in the same place at the Paris La Défense Arena in Nanterre, France for RAW with their top stars. Dominik Mysterio is gearing up to retain his Intercontinental Championship against AJ Styles , the KAbuki Warriors will face Roxanne Perez and Raquel Rodrigues from The Judgment Day and stars like CM Punk, Becky Lynch Seth Rollins , Iyo Sky, and Rhea Ripley are set to make appearances throughout the night.The night started with Jey Uso making his way into the ring. He starts by saying that while he is hurt, he will not take it lightly when someone puts their hand on his family. He calls out The Vision crew, who put his cousin Roman Reigns in the hospital after a brutal beating. But instead of Seth Rollins, Bronson Reed, and Bron Breakker - it's LA Knight who comes in. And he goes after Uso right away, saying the only reason Rollins is still the World Heavyweight Champion is because of Uso and him trying to cross Punk and Knight instead of going after Seth Rollins like they had in mind.Before their back and forth can continue, in comes Bron Breakker and Bronson Reed. Knight tells them to go back where they came from, but Breakker is not going to listen to any of that. The latter reminds everyone that they were the ones to put Roman Reigns in the hospital, and even though the crowd kept chanting The OTC's name, and booed Reed and Breakker, they ended the segment by challenging Uso and Knight for a match, which they accepted.In a backstage bit, we see Iyo Sky meet up with The Kabuki Warriors. Sky asks Asuka if they are mad at her, but Asuka laughs, refusing, saying they are family. Sky also says she is done with Rhea and tries to tell them something, but Asuka says they don't have much time, and have to leave for their match, and leaves, followed by Kairi Sane.Raquel Rodriguez and Roxanne Perez from The Judgment Day stable make their way to the stage to fight against The Kabuki Warriors in a tag team match. The previous WWE Women's Tag Team Champions come face-to-face against Asuka and Kairi Sane, and it's Asuka and Perez who start off the first fight of the night. After a cheap shot at Asuka, Perez rolls off the stage to tag in Rodriguez.The match continues with the Kabuki Warriors taking turns overpowering Perez, but it's not that easy to do the same with Rodriguez. Sane gets a lot of hits mostly courtesy of Rodriguez and a little of Perez. But all that for naught, Sane does a off the top diving elbow to the floor on Perez, and after an Empress Impact, an Asula Lock on Perez leads to her tapping out of the fight.Then a surprise announcement is made - Adam Pearce cuts a promo to reveal that Stephanie Vaquer will face Iyo Sky for the currently vacant WWE Women’s World Championship title.The next segment starts with two more Judgment Day members - Finn Balor, accompanied by JD McDonagh. The World Tag Team champions make their way to the ringside, where Balor is set to match up against Dragon Lee. The latter goes in right away with a wristlock, but Balor soon counters with a big shoulder block. As the match progresses, Lee looks to be in control of the game.Fans see Dragon Lee jump off the top with a crossbody for two. Balor gets hung up in the corner, stuck in the ropes, and in the meantime, Lee manages to take care of JD McDonagh, who tried to run interference, with a diving Frankensteiner off the apron. But Balor recovers, showing off immense core strength, and with a Coup de Grace, manages to take the win against Lee.In a backstage segment, we see Nikki Bella come to greet Iyo Sky, where the former says that while Stephanie was her girl, she also really likes Iyo. But before they can continue, Asuka, followed by Kairi Sane, interrupts them, forcing Nikki to back out. Asuka then tells Iyo that she will help her against Vaquer but Iyo says she can do it on her own. That is when Asuka reminds her that she did not win at SummerSlam, and Iyo looks embarrassed.On the other side, we see Dominik Mysterio come up to Finn Balor and JD McDonagh, asking for their help during his upcoming match against AJ Styles. But Adam Pearce has other plans, he came in right at that moment to say that both Balor and McDonagh are ejected from the building after that fight against Dragon Lee. Mysterio tries to object, but Pearce says that if Dom really is the greatest champion, like he says he is, then he should have no problem having no backup during his fight against Styles.The Six-Man Tag Team match is between Grayson Waller and The New Day who face off against Penta and The War Raiders. Waller makes his way onto the stage alongside Kofi Kingston and Xavier Woods. Woods and Penta start the fight, and Penta gains control immediately. Waller, followed by Kingston, runs in, trying to take Penta down, but they get passed outside, and Erik and Ivar are there to take them out.Penta then asks the War Raiders to gather their opponents and comes off the top with a plancha to take out everybody. The New Day has a few moments to shine, but the night belongs to Penta, Erik, and Ivar. The match continues for a while longer, before a flip piledriver from Penta takes out Woods to give Penta and The War Raiders their win.In the next backstage segment, we see Rhea Ripley getting asked about the upcoming fight between Iyo Sky and Stephanie Vaquer. She said that she respects both wrestlers but has her eye on the prize, and will soon get herself a shot at the title. The Kabuki Warriors roll in just when Ripley gets asked about them. When Mami brings up her friendship with Iyo, Asuke tells her they are not friends and that Ripley should stay away.The Eradicator is not playing and tells Asuka to stop pushing, who counters by saying that she has been making history for fifteen years and will push if she wants to. Ripley's “try me” is met with a ""No one is ready for Asuka, even you,"" from Asuka. All this while, Kairi Sane stands in the middle, looking like she wants to disappear.In another bit, Roxanne Perez and Raquel Rodriguez go to meet Adam Pearce, asking why they don't have a title match. Pearce tells them to go away when Lyra Valkyria walks in. Perez says she should go be with her friend - Bayley, who gets mad about them bringing her up.Pearce finally makes Perez and Rodriguez leave before telling Valkyria that he talked to Bayley, and she sounded good, even if she said some weird things. He would tell her more, but that's all he has for now. Valkyria then asks Pearce for a match against either of the Judgment Day members, and he gives it to her, making her leave his office.The next segment begins with AJ Styles making his way into the ring for his fight against Dominik Mysterio for the WWE Intercontinental Championship. Styles gets one of the loudest cheers from the crowd, and they go on for a long while. But Mysterio boots Styles while he was distracted by the crowd cheering for him. The referee checks on Styles and the match officially starts.Dropkick from Styles followed by a plancha elbow from Mysterio. Halfway through, AJ Styles powerbombs Mysterio onto the announcer's desk. He then goes again with a pumphandle gutbuster for two, which Dom counters with the Mullet-O-Matic.

Uso also comes in and says that he will fight with everything today, as The Vision crew put his cousin, Roman Reigns, in the hospital. The scene changes to CM Punk and Rhea Ripley chatting, when Adam Pearce comes in to tell Punk that Seth Rollins, whom Punk has been waiting for since the show started, is already in the building. Punk then goes in to handle it.CM Punk is in the ring and calls out Seth Rollins - man to man. Buy it's a different man he gets, as Becky Lynch comes in to face him. The two of them cut a spectacular promo, both selling the rivalry between CM Punk and Seth Rollins with everything they had. Rollins makes an appearance for a few minutes and tells Punk that if he has something to tell him, he should come over and say it to his face.But Becky blocks his path, when CM tries to go past her towards Rollins. The World Heavyweight Champion laughs and walks away, and that's when hell breaks loose as Lynch starts hitting and slapping Punk all over, and he just stands there and takes it. The fans are loud, cheering on a specific name, but Lynch won't stop. Punk finally says that he is going to make Seth Rollins regret ever cashing in on him, and she’s gonna regret putting hands on him. Is this his way of hinting at what the fans have been hoping for all this time? Fingers crossed, it's a couple that takes on Rollins and Lynch.Bron Breakker & Bronson Reed will face off against unlikely tag team partners - Jey Uso & LA Knight, in a brutal tag team match. The Vision crew takes control early on in the match, overwhelming Uso, and it is a while before he gets to tag Knight in. Bronson goes for a backsplash on Knight while Breakker runs interference. He then suplexes Knight, who tried to tag in Uso, and instead Reed gets the tag.Knight dives on Reed, but he puts him hard into the ringpost! They try to take Reed out with a spear after throwing him off the ring.

Breakker then hits Uso with another spear, followed by a 747 Splash. And while they had more planned for Jey, his twin runs in with a steel chair to ward off Reed and Breakker to end the show.","The September 1 edition of Monday Night RAW will see the aftermath of the spectacular show that was Clash in Paris.

Bill Belichick leads Tar Heels into new era



Celebrities flock to Belichick’s UNC debut



Bill Belichick’s long-awaited entry into the college football world finally arrived under the bright lights of Chapel Hill. On Monday night, the legendary NFL coach, known for his no-nonsense gray hoodie and unmatched resume with the New England Patriots, walked the sidelines for the first time as head coach of the North Carolina Tar Heels. And in true Belichick fashion, the debut began with precision, energy, and a touch of history.The Tar Heels wasted no time setting the tone against TCU. Their opening drive spanned 83 yards and ended with Caleb Hood powering into the end zone from eight yards out. That early spark symbolized what many UNC fans are hoping Belichick can deliver — discipline, execution, and results. His defense immediately backed it up, forcing a quick punt from the Horned Frogs.Belichick, at 73, hardly looked like a coach easing into retirement. Instead, he roamed Kenan Memorial Stadium with intent, locking in on his players during warmups and even sharing handshakes with officials and ACC commissioner Jim Phillips. For a man who has stood on the biggest stages in sports, including six Super Bowl wins, there was an undeniable sense that this moment still carried weight.UNC’s gamble to bring in a coach of Belichick’s stature is about more than football.It’s a cultural statement for a university long defined by basketball glory. By handing the reins to one of the greatest strategists in NFL history, the school is signaling its determination to elevate its football program to national relevance.The scene in Chapel Hill went beyond X’s and O’s. The debut carried the aura of a spectacle, attracting some of the biggest names ever connected to North Carolina sports. NBA legend Michael Jordan, who won his 1982 NCAA title under Dean Smith, was in attendance. NFL Hall of Famer Lawrence Taylor, who once played under Belichick with the New York Giants, also made his way to the stands. They were joined by former Tar Heels coach Roy Williams, U.S. soccer icon Mia Hamm, Julius Peppers, and even country star Eric Church.Belichick’s girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, drew plenty of attention too. She was spotted alongside NFL great Randy Moss, watching history unfold from a box seat.The hoodie, symbolic of an entire era in New England, is now draped in Carolina blue. For Belichick, this debut wasn’t just about nostalgia — it was about proving that his methods can succeed in a different arena. His NFL rings won’t guarantee wins here. From this point forward, Belichick must earn every victory the college way, and Tar Heel nation is eager to see where this new chapter leads.Also Read: Bill Belichick’s 24-year-old girlfriend Jordon Hudson rocks Tar Heel blue alongside Randy Moss at UNC debut game","Bill Belichick made his college coaching debut at North Carolina on Monday.

Saquon Barkley headlines NFL Top 100 players of 2025



Patrick Mahomes and shifting dynamics in NFL hierarchy



The NFL ’s annual Top 100 countdown reached its climax Monday night, and the players have spoken. Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley, fresh off a spectacular debut season, has been voted the No. 1 player in the league for 2025. It’s a historic honor, marking the first time an Eagles player has ever earned the top spot in the prestigious rankings.Saquon Barkley’s recognition comes after a season that will be remembered for years in Philadelphia. The reigning Offensive Player of the Year not only carried the Eagles’ offense but also reshaped the team’s identity. His explosive runs and game-changing plays made him the obvious choice among peers, who vote annually for the NFL Top 100 players.He topped an elite group that included Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson at No. 2, Bills signal-caller Josh Allen at No. 3, Bengals wideout Ja’Marr Chase at No. 4, and Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes at No. 5.The Eagles had nine representatives overall in this year’s rankings, showing the depth of talent on their roster. Alongside Barkley’s No. 1 finish, Jalen Hurts came in at No. 19, A.J. Brown at 29, and rookie standout Quinyon Mitchell at 49, further solidifying Philadelphia’s dominance.For Barkley, this was his fifth career appearance on the list. He debuted at No. 16 in 2019 after winning Offensive Rookie of the Year but had never cracked the top 10 until now. The No. 1 finish is both a personal milestone and a symbol of how far he has come after years of battling injuries and doubters.While Barkley’s rise is the story of the moment, the rankings also highlighted a shift at the quarterback position. Patrick Mahomes, often a lock for the top three, slipped to No. 5 this year. Despite leading the Chiefs to a 15-1 record, his statistical dip — 3,928 passing yards and 26 touchdowns, both five-year lows — factored into the slide. The Super Bowl loss to Barkley’s Eagles only sharpened the narrative.Still, Mahomes remains one of the league’s most feared competitors, and his presence in the top five underscores his lasting influence. Yet, in 2025, the crown belongs to Saquon Barkley, a player whose perseverance and brilliance finally propelled him to the top of the NFL mountain.Also Read: Michael Jordan and Lawrence Taylor headline star-studded crowd for Bill Belichick’s North Carolina coaching debut",Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley is voted No. 1 player in the league for 2025.

TCU outgained UNC 542-222 in total offense, highlighting execution gaps and exposing the Tar Heels’ vulnerabilities.TCU maintained dominance in both tempo and territory throughout the game.

Connor McDavid contract extension talks raise pressure on Edmonton Oilers roster and future

TSN’s Ryan Rishaug reported thatnoting that the possibility of McDavid beginning the season without an extension isat the end of last year. The uncertainty leaves Oilers fans anxiously awaiting a decision.According to TSN’s Ryan Rishaug, no final decision has been made regarding McDavid’s future with the Oilers. While speculation has increased in recent weeks, Rishaug said,He added that while starting the season without a new deal is a very real possibility, the window is narrowing, and the lack of clarity is creating unease among fans and analysts alike.The uncertainty also means that every road trip and media scrum will be dominated by questions about McDavid’s future. With the Oilers chasing a Stanley Cup, the risk of this distraction growing into a season-long storyline looms large.If McDavid remains unsigned as the season progresses, the Oilers face a difficult balancing act. A prolonged slump or losing streak could intensify pressure to consider trading their franchise player, something nearly unthinkable for a team aiming to contend.On the other hand, allowing McDavid to walk as a free agent would be one of the biggest losses in modern NHL history.Rishaug emphasized that while panic is premature, the Oilers’ front office cannot ignore the implications. McDavid’s decision to delay may simply reflect patience, but the organization must prepare for all scenarios. For Edmonton’s fans, the longer talks drag on, the more anxiety will grow around the possibility of losing their captain.Connor McDavid’s future with the Edmonton Oilers remains uncertain, with his agent Judd Moldaver and TSN’s Ryan Rishaug confirming that no decision has been made. While an extension before the season is still possible, the chance of starting the year without clarity now feels increasingly likely.

The former UFC star went on Instagram Monday morning to share his side of the story and call for people to stop sending violent and racist messages to his family.In his Instagram post, Rampage Jackson explained that Raja Jackson should never have taken matters into his own hands. He admitted he was “pissed” at his son for attacking Skyo Stu, saying Raja Jackson knows better and should have gone to the police instead of fighting in the ring. Rampage said, “Yes my son took things too far, and I’m pissed at him for being a POS and the way he handled it!”But the MMA star also placed blame on Syko Stu. According to Rampage, Skyo Stu was drunk and hit Raja Jackson over the head with a real beer can during a livestream before the fight even began.Quinton Rampage Jackson said this attack is what pushed Raja Jackson to step into the ring and retaliate. “If Syko Stu wasn’t drunk and wouldn’t have hit my son with a real beer can, then Knox wouldn’t have felt like they had to let Raja get his ‘get back’ in the ring,” Rampage explained.Quinton Rampage Jackson made it clear that Raja Jackson will face consequences for going too far, especially for repeatedly hitting Stu after he was already on the ground.Still, Rampage Jackson said people are ignoring how the incident started and are unfairly painting Raja Jackson as someone who attacked a veteran with PTSD for no reason.Also Read: Former Tennis Star Anna Kournikova Pregnant At 44 Expecting Fourth Child With Enrique Iglesias After Health Scare He ended his message by telling fans, “Keep your damn hands to yourself. If you get paid to do fake fighting, don’t disrespect people who do it for real.” WWE legend Mark Henry also weighed in, saying Raja Jackson went overboard but agreeing that Syko Stu should have known how a non-wrestler might react. Meanwhile, Skyo Stu is out of the hospital and recovering, while police continue to investigate the violent clash.","MMA legend Quinton “Rampage” Jackson is speaking out after his son, Raja Jackson, brutally beat wrestler Syko Stu inside a ring last weekend.

Fans struggle to accept Micah Parsons in green and gold

Locker room concerns add another layer to the storyline

When blockbuster trades happen in the NFL , it often takes fans time to adjust. That’s exactly what is unfolding with Micah Parsons, who is now suiting up in Green Bay after his shocking departure from the Dallas Cowboys. Just days after the trade, the four-time Pro Bowl linebacker was spotted in Packers colors for the first time, and reactions online have been nothing short of explosive.Micah Parsons’ practice session with the Packers sparked an immediate storm on social media. Many fans couldn’t wrap their heads around seeing one of Dallas’ biggest defensive stars in a completely different uniform. One fan bluntly wrote, “Looks trash in green and gold have fun.” Another admitted, “I still can’t believe this happened.”Others even questioned the timing of his recovery from a back issue that sidelined him throughout training camp. “Ahhh so his injuries are just magically healed now I wonder how that happened?” one user joked, pointing to the linebacker’s mobility in practice.Despite the skepticism, Green Bay supporters are optimistic his presence could elevate the defense into true Super Bowl contention—especially as the team prepares to face the Detroit Lions in Week One.While Cowboys fans are reeling, new reports suggest Dallas may not be entirely heartbroken. According to Sports Illustrated’s Albert Breer, Parsons wasn’t always a favorite in the Cowboys’ locker room. Some teammates reportedly viewed him as “egotistical and self-centered,” while his podcast, The Edge, allegedly created tension all the way up to quarterback Dak Prescott.His desire to make big plays also drew criticism, with some linking it to Dallas’ struggles against the run last season. Still, the Packers clearly see him as a difference-maker.Also Read: Micah Parsons FaceTimes heartbroken Cowboys fan after trade, promises he will still make him proud in Green Bay Parsons’ debut at Lambeau Field on September 7 against the Lions will be the true test—not just of his health, but of how quickly fans can accept this stunning new chapter.",Micah Parsons' practice session with the Packers sparked an immediate storm on social media.

The 2016 interview that had Travis Kelce making a surprising choice

Fans react with humor as destiny takes a different turn

When it comes to celebrity romances, unexpected throwbacks often grab the spotlight. A resurfaced interview clip from 2016 has fans buzzing after Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce was caught choosing Katy Perry over his now-fiancée Taylor Swift during a playful game of “Kiss, Marry, Kill.” Nearly a decade later, the irony of his choice is not lost on Swifties, given that Kelce and Swift are now planning their future together.The clip, originally from AfterBuzz TV, put Kelce in a lighthearted yet tricky position. He was asked to choose between three global icons: Ariana Grande, Katy Perry, and Taylor Swift. At the time, Kelce admitted the game was “messed up” and hesitated to make his picks. Eventually, he landed on his final choices: “Kill Ariana, unfortunately. ‘Love you, but you’re gone.’ Taylor to kiss and… what was the last one? Katy Perry would be to marry. ”The response drew laughs back then, but its reappearance in 2025—just days after Kelce’s engagement to Swift—has sparked a wave of amusement and commentary across social media.While the remark was made almost ten years ago, fans couldn’t resist poking fun at the irony. One user joked, “PLAY THIS AT THE WEDDING,” while another pointed out that Kelce “knew he wanted to kiss Taylor for sure but didn’t even remember the third option.”Others framed it as a sign of destiny, noting that even in a joking game, Kelce naturally gravitated toward Swift, albeit in the kiss category. Today, that “kiss” has blossomed into a full-fledged romance, culminating in their August 26 engagement in Lee’s Summit, Missouri.Also Read: “She's stepping away”: Taylor Swift may revoke godmother role to Blake Lively’s kids following her engagement to Travis Kelce What was once a throwaway answer in a playful interview has now become a viral reminder of how unpredictable life—and love—can be.","Travis Kelce was asked to choose between Ariana Grande, Katy Perry, and Taylor Swift.

Antonio Brown ’s harsh response to King Harris goes viral

In the world of music and sports, bold statements often spark bigger reactions. That’s exactly what happened when King Harris, the son of rapper T.I., declared he hopes to be “bigger than Michael Jackson .” While fans debated the weight of such an ambitious goal, former NFL wide receiver Antonio Brown jumped into the conversation — not with encouragement, but with a cutting insult that set social media ablaze.After Complex shared King Harris’ comments on X (formerly Twitter), Antonio Brown reposted the article with his own unfiltered take. “God dam that n*gga ugly…” he wrote, alongside the story comparing Harris’ ambitions to the King of Pop’s legendary legacy.The post quickly went viral, drawing more than 400,000 views and thousands of likes. But with the attention came backlash. Many fans called out Brown for targeting Harris’ appearance instead of addressing the claim itself. Critics argued that his insult overshadowed what could have been a more meaningful discussion about young artists, ambition, and the weight of living up to music icons.While some of Brown’s followers laughed at his bluntness, others were quick to defend Harris, noting that every young artist needs space to dream big — even if the goal seems unrealistic. Harris, who has grown up in the shadow of celebrity parents, has often been scrutinized for trying to create his own path in the entertainment industry.Also Read: “F*ggot of the Day”: Antonio Brown humiliates Josh Allen with homophobic rant over family nut business For Brown, the incident is another addition to his long list of controversial online moments, reinforcing his reputation as a provocateur who thrives on stirring reactions.

Team Canada makes bold statement on age and talent at orientation camp

Connor Bedard and Macklin Celebrini bring skill, hardware, and hunger to the Olympic mix

The countdown to the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina is already fueling excitement, and Team Canada has made one thing clear: youth is no barrier. Connor Bedard and Macklin Celebrini, both former No. 1 NHL Draft picks, are not just tagging along for experience—they are legitimately fighting for roster spots.Team Canada GM Doug Armstrong set the tone at orientation camp in Calgary, where Bedard and Celebrini joined 43 of the nation’s best NHL players. “There is no age limit, or you don't have to be a certain age to make this team. If you're good enough and you can help this team compete to win, then you'll make this team,” Armstrong said.This approach throws the door wide open for the 19-year-old Bedard and 18-year-old Celebrini. Neither participated in the 4 Nations Face-Off earlier this year, but skating alongside legends like Sidney Crosby and Drew Doughty has created the perfect stage for them to prove they belong.Bedard, drafted first overall by the Chicago Blackhawks in 2023, wasted no time making his mark, winning the Calder Trophy in 2024 after leading all rookies with 22 goals and 61 points.Celebrini, who went first overall to the San Jose Sharks in 2024, wasn’t far behind—posting 25 goals and 63 points in his own rookie season.Head coach Jon Cooper emphasized that their presence is no publicity stunt. “We didn’t bring guys here because they were young. We brought them here because they deserve to be here and it’s good for them.”Both players have already donned the Maple Leaf at the World Juniors and World Championships, but the Olympics represent the ultimate test. As Armstrong put it: “They’re at this event not to gain experience. It’s to make the team.”Also Read: “There was a death threat”: Mitch Marner reveals threats and security fears during final months with Toronto Maple Leafs",Connor Bedard and Macklin Celebrini are both former No. 1 NHL Draft picks.

Brad Lambert looks ready to take the next step into a full-time NHL role

Defensive depth and scoring threats highlight the Jets’ pipeline

As the Winnipeg Jets prepare for the 2025-26 NHL season, the spotlight isn’t just on the main roster but also on the franchise’s promising pipeline of young talent. With a mix of speed, skill, and grit, several prospects are positioned to make a significant impact in the near future.Brad Lambert, the Jets’ 2022 first-round pick, headlines the prospect list. After two seasons developing with the AHL’s Manitoba Moose, the 21-year-old forward is expected to make the leap to a permanent NHL role. Known for his speed and offensive creativity, Lambert is seen as a player who can help fill the void left by Nikolaj Ehlers’ departure to Carolina.""His strength is going to be his speed and his ability to push people back,"" said Jets director of player development Jimmy Roy. He added that Lambert has worked on getting stronger physically, which could be the final piece needed to thrive against NHL competition.Behind Lambert, Elias Salomonsson has emerged as one of the most reliable defensive prospects. After winning a championship in Sweden and impressing in his first AHL season, the 21-year-old blueliner is praised for his ability to win puck battles and make smart first passes. Projected to arrive in the NHL next season, he could be a cornerstone of Winnipeg’s defense for years to come.Meanwhile, the Jets also have strong forward depth with Brayden Yager, Colby Barlow, and Nikita Chibrikov. Yager, acquired from Pittsburgh, brings elite vision and offensive explosiveness, though his NHL debut is still a few years away. Barlow, a natural goal scorer, already possesses an NHL-caliber shot, while Chibrikov—coming off an injury—offers skill and tenacity that could earn him a roster spot soon.Also Read: “Negotiations haven’t really started”: Insider says Connor McDavid won’t sign extension before season leaving Oilers on edge With this mix of near-ready and developing talent, the Jets’ future looks promising.

Analyst questions Isak Rosen ’s fit in Buffalo and suggests trade as best option

Sabres face bigger questions beyond Isak Rosen as playoff drought drags on

The Buffalo Sabres are once again facing tough roster decisions as the franchise looks to break free from its 14-year playoff drought. Among the biggest question marks is 22-year-old forward Isak Rosen, a former first-round draft pick who has yet to establish himself in the NHL despite success at the AHL level.According to Rachel Lenzi of The Buffalo News, the Sabres may be running out of patience with Isak Rosen, who was drafted 14th overall in 2021. While he’s been a steady producer for the Rochester Americans—scoring 62 goals and 142 points in 194 AHL games—his NHL career has been underwhelming so far.“The Sabres have a decision to make about Rosen, who has been productive in the AHL but not impactful in 15 NHL games in the last two seasons,” Lenzi wrote.In Buffalo, Rosen has logged limited minutes, often deployed on the fourth line. His stat line reflects the lack of opportunity: one assist, no goals, and an average of just nine minutes of ice time per game. Lenzi argued that both the Sabres and Rosen could benefit from a change of scenery.“A trade to a team that needs a young forward who needs a change of scenery would benefit Rosen,” she added.Buffalo’s issues, however, extend well beyond Rosen’s development.The team once again missed the Stanley Cup Playoffs last season, extending its drought to a league-worst 14 years. Head coach Lindy Ruff admitted the frustration but emphasized consistency and puck management as the keys to turning things around.“We know where we’re at. I’m disappointed with where we’re at. We can’t do anything about that, but we can work on our game,” Ruff said in April.Also Read: NHL Contract Talks: Minnesota Wild urged to prepare exit strategy if Kirill Kaprizov rejects record-breaking offer Rosen’s rookie contract runs through the 2025-26 season, giving the Sabres some leverage.

Cowboys and Eagles injury report: Big names, cautious optimism



Season stakes: Rivalry, redemption, and streaming details



The 2025 NFL season kicks off Thursday night with one of football’s most storied rivalries. The Philadelphia Eagles, fresh off their Super Bowl LIX triumph, welcome the Dallas Cowboys to Lincoln Financial Field on September 4 at 8:20 p.m. ET. With two powerhouse teams opening the season under prime-time lights, the stage is set for drama, intensity, and storylines that stretch far beyond the scoreboard.Both franchises released their first injury reports this week, giving fans a glimpse into player availability for the opener. The Cowboys listed four players, most notably cornerback Trevon Diggs, who missed much of 2024 after undergoing knee surgery. Diggs was a full participant in practice and told reporters he feels a “75-80% chance” of suiting up Thursday night. Joining him on the list were defensive tackle Perrion Winfrey (back), tackle Tyler Guyton (knee), and tight end Brevyn Spann-Ford (ankle). Of the group, only Winfrey sat out of practice.Philadelphia, meanwhile, faces its own set of injury concerns. Pro Bowl guard Landon Dickerson headlined the Eagles’ report after a knee issue kept him sidelined during Monday’s session.Quarterback Tanner McKee (thumb) also did not participate, while safety Andrew Mukuba (hamstring) and linebacker Josh Uche (groin) were limited. Defensive tackle Jalen Carter, one of the team’s brightest young stars, practiced fully despite a shoulder designation.What stood out even more were the absences. The Cowboys’ backfield duo of Miles Sanders and Jaydon Blue, previously nursing knocks, cleared the list entirely. On the Eagles’ side, wideout A.J. Brown—who had already promised fans he’d be ready—was officially off the report, a reassuring sign for Philly’s offense.This opener is more than just Week 1—it’s a tone-setter. The Cowboys are eager to move past their offseason drama, which included trading Micah Parsons to the Packers in a blockbuster deal. Philadelphia, on the other hand, wants to cement its dominance and chase history by defending its NFC East crown for a second straight year.For fans tuning in, coverage begins with Football Night in America at 7 p.m. ET on NBC10 and Peacock. Kickoff is set for 8:20 p.m., with streaming available on Peacock, NFL+, YouTube TV, and Hulu.With legacies, health, and momentum on the line, Thursday night’s Eagles-Cowboys clash has all the ingredients of an opening game fans won’t forget.Also Read: Bill Belichick’s 24-year-old girlfriend Jordon Hudson rocks Tar Heel blue alongside Randy Moss at UNC debut game","The 2025 NFL season kicks off Thursday night with one of football’s most storied rivalries.

Cam Newton questions whether Aaron Rodgers can really be the answer in Pittsburgh Steelers



Pittsburgh Steelers trapped in NFL no man’s land with limited playoff chances and low draft position



Bringing in Aaron Rodgers might not be enough to fix Steelers’ quarterback cycle

The Carolina Panthers may have finally found their future with Bryce Young. But the Pittsburgh Steelers are still stuck in a cycle of short-term fixes, according to former NFL MVP Cam Newton, and the latest one, he thinks, wears No. 8. The Steelers signed veteran quarterback Aaron Rodgers this offseason in hopes of stabilizing a position that’s been unsettled since Ben Roethlisberger retired in 2021. But Newton isn’t convinced the move will solve anything long-term. On his 4th & 1 podcast, the former Panthers star gave a blunt take, calling Rodgers nothing more than a temporary solution. The team’s latest quarterback decision, he thinks, might buy them another season or two, but it does little to build a sustainable future at the position.During his 4th & 1 podcast, Panthers legend Cam Newton offered his candid assessment of the Steelers’ quarterback strategy. He said, “I don’t think Aaron Rodgers has anything else to prove,” adding, “I don’t think he’s saying, ‘I have to win a Super Bowl.’ If he wins a Super Bowl, he’s retired. This very well may be Aaron Rodgers’ last hurrah. It would have been his last hurrah last year if it wasn’t so meh. If they would have went to the playoffs, if they would have went to the AFC Championship, the Super Bowl, he would have been able to say, ‘I’ve seen the mountaintop.I ain’t got it in me.’ Now, you get to a situation where it’s like, does he really have to perform? Because he’s a Band-Aid at this particular point. A quality Band-Aid.”Newton’s analysis hits a nerve in Pittsburgh. The team has lacked the breakthrough needed to make deep playoff runs while also never reaching the bottom of the standings where they could draft a high-end quarterback prospect. That middle-of-the-pack status means the Steelers are neither contending nor able to draft the kind of rookie passer who could change their fortunes. Rodgers’ Achilles injury in 2023 made people even more worried about whether he can stay healthy and play well at this point in his career. Newton’s comment echoes what many are thinking – the Steelers need to stop relying on older quarterbacks and find a long-term answer.In a league where quarterback continuity is vital, Pittsburgh may continue to search longer than they planned. With the NFC’s rebuilding Panthers potentially ready to capitalize on quarterback stability with Bryce Young, the contrast between the two franchises becomes even more striking. The Steelers can hope Rodgers buys them time – but if history is any indication, time alone may not solve their long-term quarterback needs.Unless Pittsburgh commits to a long-term vision at the most important position in football, they risk repeating this same offseason carousel again in 2026.",The Steelers signed veteran quarterback Aaron Rodgers this offseason in hopes of stabilizing a position that’s been unsettled since Ben Roethlisberger retired in 2021.

Aaron Rodgers takes accountability and sets the tone in Pittsburgh

Why this update is crucial for the Steelers’ Super Bowl hopes

As the 2025 NFL season kicks off, all eyes are on Pittsburgh, where Aaron Rodgers is preparing to make his regular season debut with the Steelers against his former team, the New York Jets. The storyline couldn’t be bigger: a 41-year-old future Hall of Famer leading a franchise with championship ambitions, while facing the organization he left behind.According to Jeff Howe of The Athletic, Rodgers’ presence in the locker room has already transformed the Steelers’ culture. “Quarterback Aaron Rodgers has added a level of accountability on the practice field and in the facility, according to sources around the team,” Howe reported. While Pittsburgh’s offense is still adjusting to turnover at key positions, Rodgers has been “intentional about teaching as much as possible after each play. ”That kind of commitment is notable, given Rodgers’ reputation in past seasons for being reluctant to mentor teammates. In Pittsburgh, however, he appears invested in building chemistry with star wideout DK Metcalf and the rest of the offense. While Howe cautioned fans not to be surprised if things look “bumpy out of the gate,” the optimism is clear—Rodgers is determined to make this team his own.The Steelers’ front office made a bold bet by bringing Rodgers to Pittsburgh.His numbers with the Jets last season—3,897 yards, 28 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions—proved he still has the arm talent to compete at the highest level. But at his age, leadership and preparation may be just as important as physical ability.For a team trying to navigate a new-look offense, Rodgers’ buy-in could be the deciding factor between early struggles and a deep playoff push. If he truly commits to sharing his football wisdom and building cohesion, Pittsburgh may have found the missing piece to return to Super Bowl contention.Also Read: Patrick Mahomes teases Travis Kelce with geography joke ahead of Chiefs’ season opener in Brazil The journey begins in Week 1 against the Jets, where Rodgers has the perfect chance to prove that his leadership can turn preseason optimism into real results.","Aaron Rodgers is set to make his regular season debut with the Steelers against his former team, the New York Jets.

Tom Brady on why mental development matters more than physical gifts

Tom Brady believes longevity comes from brains, not just athleticism



Tom Brady believes the quarterback position is losing its balance. While today’s quarterbacks showcase dazzling athleticism, Brady warns that the mental craft required to lead an offense is being overshadowed. Speaking on Cris Collinsworth’s podcast, the seven-time Super Bowl champion stressed that physical ability alone does not define greatness under center.Tom Brady has long admitted he wasn’t the most gifted athlete entering the league. What separated him was an ability to outthink defenses, anticipate matchups, and control the game before the ball was even snapped. “I don’t believe the quarterback position is as mentally developed as it was when I entered the league 25 years ago,” Brady said. “There was a premium on understanding defenses, on understanding matchups, on I’d say pre-snap reads, getting your team in and out of the right play. ”That discipline, according to Brady, is fading in today’s NFL , where prospects are measured more by arm strength and speed than by their decision-making. “I think you better have a mental advantage on the field and I think sometimes that’s more important than the physical advantage,” he explained.For Brady, being forced to rely on his brain rather than his legs built the foundation for a 23-year career.Brady admires the spectacle of mobile quarterbacks but cautions that constant running shortens careers. “I think it’s terrible for the longevity of a quarterback,” he said. While fans may love highlight-reel scrambles, Brady insists the real beauty of the position is found in progressions, patience, and precision.His message is clear: athleticism might win headlines, but intelligence wins championships. In Brady’s eyes, the next generation will need to rediscover the mental artistry of quarterbacking if they hope to replicate his success.Also Read: Saquon Barkley lands at No. 1 on NFL Top 100 Players 2025 while Patrick Mahomes ranks unexpectedly low","Tom Brady says physical talent isn’t enough, warns quarterbacks must sharpen mental edge to succeed in NFL.

Fan Reactions



Mixed but leaning positive, seen as a smart depth move





A Grit-Filled Journey to Los Angeles

Thehave signed 7-foot center, a move aimed at bolstering defense and adding frontcourt insurance as the team looks to stay competitive in the post-Anthony Davis era.Kelley officially joined the Lakers on an Exhibit 10 training camp contract in late August 2025. This short-term deal gives him the chance to compete for a roster spot during preseason. If waived, he can still play for the Lakers’ G League affiliate, the South Bay Lakers.The 7-footer is no stranger to the organization. Last season, Kelley anchored the paint for South Bay, where he impressed with his rim protection and interior defense. His NBA experience includes brief stints with the Dallas Mavericks and New Orleans Pelicans.The Los Angeles Lakers ’ decision to bring in Kelley comes down to three key factors:• Defensive depth: Kelley led the G League in blocks with 2.4 per game last season while shooting 68.2 percent from the field.• Roster flexibility: With Anthony Davis gone and the franchise entering a post-LeBron construction phase, size is at a premium. This low-risk deal allows them to test Kelley’s fit without long-term commitment.• Playoff insurance: While Kelley is unlikely to be a major star, his rim protection gives the Los Angeles Lakers another defensive option when facing bigger lineups in the postseason.For Kylor Kelley, this Exhibit 10 contract is more than just another stop - it’s a real chance to carve out an NBA role.• NBA opportunity: After years bouncing between the G League and international leagues, Kelley now has a path to real minutes with one of the NBA’s most storied teams.• Mentorship: Surrounded by seasoned veterans, he’ll have the opportunity to grow under the guidance of experienced stars.• Exposure: Playing for the Lakers puts him under a global spotlight, whether he secures a rotation role or continues as a defensive anchor in South Bay.Although Kelley and Luka Doncic overlapped on the Mavericks, they never shared the floor due to injuries—most notably Doncic’s calf strain in December. Still, the two spent time together in training sessions, giving them a baseline familiarity.The Los Angeles Lakers appear to be prioritizing players who can complement Doncic’s style, and Kelley fits that mold as a rim protector. Early signals suggest Doncic is supportive of the signing, with his positive reactions on social media adding an optimistic touch.While not a blockbuster move, Kelley’s signing slightly strengthens the Lakers’ outlook.Fans have responded with cautious optimism, calling the move a “solid depth signing” that could pay dividends if Kelley adapts quickly. Sportsbooks, however, have not significantly adjusted title odds.Kylor Kelley’s path to the Los Angeles Lakers has been anything but typical.

Poll Do you agree with Robin Uthappa's view that star power influenced Shubman Gill's selection for the T20I Asia Cup? Yes, definitely No, it's purely based on performance

Former India batter Robin Uthappa believes that star power played a key role in the selection of Shubman Gill for the upcoming T20I Asia Cup and his appointment as vice-captain for the tournament. This will be Gill’s first appearance in T20 internationals since India toured Sri Lanka in July last year, which coincided with Gautam Gambhir ’s start as the national team’s head coach.Speaking on his YouTube channel, Uthappa expressed a blunt view on the decision, saying the selectors created a tricky situation by recalling Gill to the T20 fold. He highlighted that Gill’s recent performances as India’s Test captain in England had been outstanding, but the move to include him in T20 cricket could bring added pressure.Uthappa suggested that the selection was influenced not only by cricketing merit but also by business and marketing considerations. “From an Indian cricket perspective, at all kinds of eras, you have always had superstars and they have backed a particular player for the sake of Indian cricket. I think that narrative is continued to be followed right now,” he said.He added, “I think the marketing and business narrative also takes precedence, which is why he is brought in. You want certain superstars to take the game forward. Shubman is going to be one of them.”Gill enjoyed a strong IPL 2025 season for the Gujarat Titans, scoring 650 runs in 15 matches at an average of 50 and a strike rate of 155.88, including six fifties. He finished as the fourth-highest run-getter in the tournament, strengthening his case for selection.The Asia Cup will begin on September 9 in the UAE, with defending champions India facing the UAE in their opening match on September 10.

New Delhi: Jitesh Sharma has all the traits of a small-town boy.In his home town Amravati in Maharashtra, he and his childhood friends still go to the old tea shop to enjoy the 'cutting' (tea). He still roams around the streets on his bike, where he is still Jitesh. Not Jitesh Sharma the India cricketer. And, more recently, not Jitesh the IPL winner.""I am kind of anti-social. I only open up with folks who are closer to me. This is my nature. Wo small-town ladko ka hota hai, shaam mein jo 4-5 dost ke saath tafri karte hai bas unke saath hi baith jaata hun (That’s the way it is with small-town boys. In the evenings I just hang out with my four-five closest friends),"" he tells TimesofIndia.com.It was the same bunch of friends with whom he wanted to clear the National Defence Academy (NDA) exam, and the group got to know about a Maharashtra government law, where representing your state would earn you 25 extra marks, and for those extra marks, he started playing cricket.In that endeavour, Jitesh, who didn't have a coach, took to watching YouTube videos of Adam Gilchrist and Sourav Ganguly. At 29, he made his India debut at the Hangzhou Asian Games.After a few outings, he got dropped, but never gave up, because he believes in destiny and has dreams.Jitesh bounced back in style, played a pivotal role in Royal Challengers Bengaluru's (RCB) title-winning season, but it was not the runs that caught the selectors’ eyes, it was his 176.35 strike rate while batting at 6 and 7. And now he has been rewarded with a place in India's 15-member squad for the Asia Cup at the age of 31.The cricketing journey of Jitesh Sharma is as nonchalant as his batting style.But he disagrees.""Mere naseeb mey tha. Mujhe ache log milte gaye. Mere bhaagya mey tha (It was in my destiny. I kept meeting good people. It was fate),"" he says.Jitesh credits his childhood friends, his former Vidarbha captain Faiz Fazal, his mentor Dinesh Karthik, who made him his personal project during the IPL, and Ruchir Mishra, a former TOI journalist who passed away during COVID-19.""I got lucky at every stage of my career. Be it Ruchir bhai always giving me that confidence through texts and calls or now DK bhai, who saw something in me that no one ever saw. I just got lucky in my career,"" he reflects.The other small-town trait that Jitesh carries is manifesting. At the start of IPL 2025, he had told himself that he would have a photo carrying the IPL trophy with Virat Kohli and Dinesh Karthik standing next to him. He later shared a post on his Instagram, where he wrote, ""Power of Manifestation - Holding the IPL Trophy with Virat bhai on the left and DK Anna on the right.""""When I joined the RCB team in March, I was asked to manifest something for myself or the team, and this is what I wrote. So happy to see this come true!""Jitesh's introvert nature caught Virat Kohli's attention as well. Kohli had mentioned it during the IPL, saying Jitesh's personality made him curious. ""One guy who is really funny but hasn't opened up with me is Jitesh. I would really want to see that fun, raw side of him. Because I can see it in his eyes that he has got that mischief about him,"" Kohli had said.Jitesh admits his small-town values forced him to leave Virat Kohli alone and only have a meaningful conversation with the legend during the IPL.""Again I come from a small town, where you give lots of respect to your seniors. You don't intrude in their personal space,"" he explains.""Mere liye unse baat karni hi badi baat hai. Mai jaanta hun ki Virat bhai ka stature, toh mai koshish karta tha ki kyu hi unke personal space mein jau, kyu pareshaan karu (For me, just talking to him is a big deal. I know Virat bhai’s stature, so I would try not to intrude on his personal space or bother him unnecessarily).""I used to talk to him about cricket only. Out of respect I maintained my distance. I only wanted to have a meaningful conversation with him,"" he adds.The stint with RCB proved to be a turning point in Jitesh's career. In Dinesh Karthik, he found an elder brother, and someone he is ready to follow till the end of the world.He also gets emotional while talking about Dinesh Karthik.""Jo kisi ne mere andar aaj tak nahi dekhi woh us insaan ne mere andar dekha. Sab logo ne mere mein khaamiyaan dhoondi but us aadmi ne mere mey khoobi dekhi (What no one had ever seen inside me, that person saw within me. Everyone else looked for flaws in me, but that man saw my strengths),"" says Jitesh.""People used to tell me what I lack, but he worked on my strength and made me more confident about my game. That has made a huge difference. I felt it was my duty to give 100 per cent because of the way he instilled that confidence in me. He is like an elder brother to me. I have found that elder brother very late in my life, but I am glad that I did. I follow his instructions without asking any questions,"" he says.Jitesh believes in naseeb (fate). He found his cricketing idol in Suryakumar Yadav very late in his cricketing career. Surya, who is now the captain of India's T20I team, became Jitesh's Dronacharya (teacher). Inspired by Surya's journey, he started copying his shots and finally played the famous Supla shot (associated with Surya) off Kyle Jamieson in the IPL final during his 10-ball 24 at the packed Narendra Modi Stadium, which eventually proved crucial as RCB defeated Punjab Kings by six runs to lift the title.""Surya bhai is an inspiration for so many people. He made his international debut at 31. It gives lots of hope for all the late bloomers. He is one of the best T20I batters in the world. He can manipulate the field, he can tear apart any bowling attack.""Wo talent ke bhandaar hai, mai unse seekhne ki koshish karta rehta hoon, unko copy karne ki koshish karta hoon (He is a storehouse of talent; I keep trying to learn from him and often try to emulate him). I used to copy him a lot. But now I have started to execute the shots as well. Ek Supla aaya IPL final mey (I managed to hit one Surya special in the IPL final),"" he says.Captain Suryakumar Yadav had also praised Jitesh during the Asia Cup squad announcement.""We spoke a lot on how to go about it. We spoke about let’s not think of milestones ahead, follow your journey. Been a completely different cricketer post that. The way he performed in the IPL and domestic tournaments he played, he’s done really well, has earned his spot again,” Suryakumar had shared.Jitesh understands his role as finisher is a double-edged sword and has a perfect Hindi catchphrase for his job -- ""Chale toh chaand tak nahi toh shaam tak.""""As a finisher, you have to understand that there will be more bad days than good days. You can only try to win the game for your team. No one can guarantee that you can finish the match for your team. Even the world's best finisher’s winning percentage is very low.""It is all about giving your best for the team. When you think about your team and your mates, it eases the pressure on you. You feel more motivated,"" he adds.The thing that excited Jitesh about joining the Indian Army was the teamwork, and he tries to put those valuable lessons he learnt into his cricket.""When you think only about your own performance, you play under pressure. But when you put the team first, you see it as a responsibility, and then you automatically start making better decisions,"" he reasons.Jitesh says he doesn't believe in expressing his emotions. He just wants to enjoy his keeping, batting, and overall wants to grow as a cricketer.""I have learnt from my past mistakes that you should never express your emotions. One should keep your feelings and emotions inside,"" he says.Jitesh may have become an IPL star, an Indian player, but his heart is still in Amravati.He is just another small-town boy, who dons the gloves and tries finishing the game with the bat.","Jitesh Sharma made his India debut at the Hangzhou Asian Games.

For Jim Kelly, legacy is about more than football – it’s about family

Buffalo Bills legend Jim Kelly has taken on a new title – grandfather – and with it, a wave of emotions that rival anything he experienced on the football field. But his first month as “Grandpa Jim” has come with a painful test, as his newborn grandson Beau Hunter Bean has already spent more than a month fighting for his health in a pediatric cardiac unit. Kelly, a Hall of Fame quarterback known for leading the Bills to four consecutive Super Bowl appearances in the early 1990s, is no stranger to hardship. But watching his grandson suffer from serious health complications just days after birth has pushed him into a new kind of battle – one that he says he’s facing with the same strength and faith that carried him through his own personal struggles.Kelly’s daughter, Erin, and her husband Parker recently welcomed their first child, a baby boy named Beau Hunter Bean – lovingly nicknamed “Little Bean.” The family announced the birth just over a month ago, but celebrations were quickly overshadowed by complications. Beau was placed in a pediatric cardiac unit shortly after birth and remained there for nearly 40 days, enduring a difficult start to life. Kelly shared a heartfelt update on Instagram, posting a photo of his grandson with the caption: “Nothing like being a grandpa!!” In the longer note, he wrote, ""Doing all the normal baby things—eating, fussing, cooing, and keeping mom + dad up at night."" Check out the full note below:This isn’t the first time Jim Kelly has had to face overwhelming adversity. After retiring from the NFL, the former quarterback was diagnosed with an aggressive form of oral cancer, requiring multiple surgeries, including a major reconstructive procedure in 2018. Kelly has spoken openly about how difficult those years were – physically and mentally – but he always credited his family and faith for getting him through. That same mindset now anchors him as he supports his daughter and her husband through their son’s recovery. While Little Bean is finally home from the hospital, the family continues to navigate his medical needs day by day.Jim Kelly’s football legacy is firmly established. He’s a five-time Pro Bowler, a Hall of Famer and one of the most respected players in Buffalo Bills history. But to him, that success pales in comparison to the role he plays now – as a grandfather, a father and a source of strength for the people he loves most.As Little Bean continues to grow and recover, Kelly is holding his hand through it all.","Buffalo Bills legend Jim Kelly has taken on a new title – grandfather.

Dak Prescott acknowledges that the trade of Micah Parsons had personal undertones but emphasizes team focus on the upcoming season

“It seemed like it got personal on their end, so that’s why I wasn’t surprised.”

“Our focus right now is Philly. I think that’s everybody’s focus in that locker room,”

Looking ahead at the Cowboys’ priorities for the 2025 season following a major roster change

The Dallas Cowboys stunned the NFL by trading star linebacker Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers, just before the 2025 season kicks off. Quarterback Dak Prescott recently spoke publicly about the deal, shedding light on the team’s mindset and the tension behind the negotiations. While fans are buzzing, Prescott’s comments reveal a calm, pragmatic approach. He acknowledged the personal nature of the contract talks while reaffirming the Cowboys’ focus on the upcoming season. With the team acquiring veteran defensive tackle Kenny Clark and two first-round picks, the roster shift signals Dallas’ intent to stay competitive despite losing one of its biggest stars.Dak Prescott was clear about his reaction to Parsons’ departure,He framed the trade as a necessary resolution to a negotiation that had grown tense, underlining that the team’s focus remains on preparation and performance.Prescott added,making it clear that the Cowboys are turning their attention fully to the season opener against the Eagles.In return for Parsons, the Cowboys acquired two first-round draft picks and defensive tackle Kenny Clark, a proven veteran.Parsons signed a four-year, $188 million deal with Green Bay, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history. Clark’s addition strengthens the Cowboys’ defensive line, providing leadership and experience, while the draft picks offer long-term flexibility. The trade reflects Dallas’ attempt to balance immediate roster needs with long-term team planning.With Parsons now in Green Bay, Prescott and the Cowboys are concentrating on executing in the upcoming season.

Vanessa Bryant has no patience for baseless speculation. The widow of Los Angeles Lakers legend Kobe Bryant seemingly addressed recent pregnancy rumors head-on, using a sharp Instagram post paired with Adele’s 2011 anthem Rumour Has It to send her message. Her recent Instagram story seemingly takes a jab at the people who spread rumors involving her name, and certainly, Vanessa’s response to the devastating speculation that spread like wildfire was not the first. After reacting to the incident with a Rihanna meme, she made another statement.Vanessa Bryant, 43, recently shared a story on Instagram to her 15.7 million followers that read, “Weak people spread rumors, stupid people believe them,” while Adele’s Rumour Has It played in the background. The timing of the post was seemingly a response to her circulating chatter about her being pregnant again.The post wasn’t the first time Vanessa pushed back at the gossip. Back in June, she used humor to deliver her point, reposting a meme of Rihanna swimming with a drink in one hand and her middle finger raised. The caption read, “Me protecting my peace, not pregnant & having fun all summer.” She followed it with another meme of Rihanna that said, “I’m not mean, I’m just not the one.”She also added a third post with a motivational message: “The only way to impress me, is by being a good person. I don’t care what you have, what you wear, where you live, or what you drive. I just have deep respect for people with pure hearts and good intentions.”The sequence of posts came after unverified claims and social media chatter suggested she was expecting her fifth child. There has been no credible evidence behind these claims, and Vanessa has directly denied them.Bryant, who lost her husband Kobe and their 13-year-old daughter Gianna “Gigi” in the 2020 Calabasas helicopter crash, has been raising her three daughters — Natalia, 22, Bianka, 8, and Capri, 5 — while continuing Kobe’s philanthropic and business legacy. Since his death, she has not publicly dated anyone.While shutting down rumors in her own way, Bryant has also continued to honor her late husband through fashion tributes and public appearances. Most recently, she turned heads in a custom Disney-themed all-black outfit featuring the Mamba logo.The look came shortly after she celebrated what would have been Kobe’s 47th birthday with a touching message and participated in the Mamba League Invitational on August 24 — “Kobe Bryant Day” in Los Angeles, honoring his iconic jersey numbers 8 and 24. Bryant also sported diamond Kobe 3 Protros and throwback Lakers gear, a nod to her husband’s legacy both on and off the court.Also Read: $165 million star Luka Doncic gets strong endorsement from Pau Gasol as Lakers leader ahead of new season In this latest tribute, she combined her passions by pairing Mickey Mouse ears with the Mamba logo and a matching black tank top.","Vanessa Bryant responded to pregnancy rumors with Adele’s Rumour Has It.

'I was never very close to my parents'

In the south of Russia lies a beautiful port-side city named Sochi, a place where the Black Sea meets snow-capped mountains.For a young teenager named Yosha Iglesias, who arrived there in 2004 with little more than a chessboard’s worth of dreams, the city became her escape, promise, and, for a brief time, home.Cut to the present, Yosha recently became the first-ever transgender chess player to win the French women's chess championship and only the second transgender woman to win a national title.“I was 16, I already knew that I was, let’s say, different,” Yosha told TimesofIndia.com in a free-wheeling chat.“I wanted to live as far away as possible from my parents in France. And back then, Russia was the capital of chess.”At a modest club in Sochi, Yosha trained under an old Soviet-style International Master (IM) who had once played legends like Mikhail Tal. There, she even met Boris Spassky, the former world champion.“For me, as a young player, it was just amazing,” noted the 37-year-old, who also became the first transgender player in the history of chess to earn the Woman International Master (WIM) title earlier this year.But the brilliance of Sochi’s mountains could not eclipse a truth that was gnawing at her: Russia, for all its chess grandeur, was not the country where she could live freely.After a year, she returned to France and began working as a chess coach. She was barely 18 but already training children and club players. Behind the 64 squares, however, life was fraying.“I really wanted to transition already back then,” she added.“But at that time, it felt impossible to continue playing chess and living as a trainer while transitioning. The world was harsher back then. I tried to live as a man, but I just could not. I was really depressed. I was also struggling with alcohol. Happiness felt impossible. I was not living, I was surviving day by day.”Those were the years when Yosha teetered at the edge of existence. Yet, something small but strong kept her tethered to life: friendship.“All my best friends are female chess players. Since the beginning, they supported me. Their love and friendship is the most precious thing that I have. Thanks to them, I managed to live through these dark years,” she admitted.It wasn’t until five years ago that Yosha finally embraced her identity. “My real life started when I accepted who I already was and began my transition in 2020,” she said. “To be finally seen and accepted as a woman; it felt amazing.""But her journey in the chess world was far from smooth.The first hurdle was being accepted as a woman by the French Chess Federation. Then came the unexpected blow in 2023, when FIDE, the world chess body, introduced restrictions on transgender women.“I could understand debates in physical sports. But in chess? It really surprised me,” Yosha said. “To claim I have a biological advantage over other women players, it feels insulting to every woman. It is sexist and misogynist.”Still, France stood by her. “During the French Championship, I never felt different. I was just a woman playing chess with other women. For ten days, I forgot I was trans. I was simply myself.”Beyond the societal pressures of being a trans woman, she faced online abuse, with each victory inviting a storm of vitriol.“When I became the first trans Woman International Master, when I won anything, I received hundreds of insults,” she revealed. “Sometimes thousands. And I kept wondering, how so many people in the world have the time to insult me? I’m just a chess player.”The harassment often pierced deep on bad days: “It still hurts. Not only for me. Young trans people see it too. And that can break them.”Eventually, she quit Twitter, now X, in November 2024.However, last week, she returned with a single post after becoming the French women's champion, thanking those who had insulted her.“I think they forged my mental strength. Before my transition, I wasn’t a fighter. But I had to learn this fighting spirit,” said Yosha.Even in France, where parts of medical transition are state-supported, the costs weighed heavily.“I’ve already paid around €20,000,” she explained. “Transitioning is expensive. And when I was 18, earning maybe €1,000 a month, it felt impossible.”When Yosha urgently needed facial feminisation surgery costing €5,000, she turned to the chess community with a crowdfunding plea.The response overwhelmed her as she recalled, “Within three days, players from all over the world donated. Some were friends, some were stars I never met. I felt part of a family. For me, it was proof that FIDE’s motto, we are one family, can truly come alive.”Yosha first picked up the game at the age of eight, following her older brother Iannis, who was ""winning trophies.""“I felt jealous seeing him bring trophies home. At first, he was better. Then he quit for university, and I never quit. Now I’m stronger than him, but I still think he’s more talented,” she laughed.For her, chess has been more than a career; it has been a philosophy. “The first lesson chess teaches is focus. You have to be present. If your mind wanders, even thinking about what you’ll eat later, you must catch yourself and return to the board.”The second lesson is humility in community: “Any success relies on so many people. My brother, who motivated me, my Russian trainer, my friends, the French Federation, my club president. Chess shows us we are all connected. That’s why I’m so thankful.”Alongside chess, Yosha leaned on Buddhist philosophy. “I don’t consider myself fully Buddhist, but meditation and yoga helped me. Every struggle became an opportunity to focus on the present moment, to become a better person.”Outside chess, she enjoys reading nonfiction, going to the movies, and spending time with friends. She also runs a French chess channel on YouTube.“Before my transition, I worked mainly as a chess coach in clubs and schools, but I was too scared to continue because of the reactions of my students' parents. I switched to private lessons, then later turned to YouTube. I waited until I could present myself with my feminine voice and face, though money pushed me to start earlier. On YouTube, it’s mostly fine. People who don’t like trans people just don’t watch, and most of my audience cares only about chess,” she smiled.Looking ahead, she is preparing for a strong open tournament in Spain, aiming for norms toward the titles of Woman Grandmaster (WGM) and International Master (IM).Later this year, she will undergo another surgery and then return in spring with renewed focus. “I am as motivated as ever to give my energy to this fantastic game,” she said.Nevertheless, one of the most emotional arcs of her story remains her relationship with her parents.“I was never very close with them. When I was 16, I left to live with a host family in Sochi. As an adult, it was not bad, but distant. We saw each other twice a year. When I came out, it was very difficult for them to accept. It took years,” she admitted.“Now, they see me happier than ever. They have never seen me like this. I’ll visit them to give them the championship trophy. In France, it’s not a cup but a precious vase from the President. I want them to have it.”She continued, “I think they are proud now. It took time. I’m 37, and it took years, but finally, they accept me. I’m happy because they are not young anymore. It is good that at this point in our lives, we can accept and love each other as we really are.”From Sochi’s mountains to Parisian chess halls, from online hate to standing ovations, Yosha Iglesias’s journey is a reminder that the game of life, like chess, is about resilience, patience, and courage to move forward, even when the pieces seem stacked against you.“My best coaches,” she said with a smile, “were not only chess masters, but also all those people who tried to break me. They made me stronger. And now, sitting across the board, nothing scares me anymore.”",Yosha Iglesias is the first-ever transgender chess player to win the French women's championship. The 37-year-old also became the first transgender player in the history of chess to earn the Woman International Master (WIM) title earlier this year.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123646656,imgsize-61792,width-400,resizemode-4/yosha-iglesias-becomes-new-french-women39s-champion-special-arrangements.jpg"
