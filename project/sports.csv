‘Script Readied Over A Mth, Read Out To Parents’

MUMBAI: The ""script"" for the shocking Powai hostage crisis was apparently planned for over a month. Seventeen children had their hands tied and mouths taped at a recording studio Thursday, as everyone believed a ""hostage scene"" for a web series was being filmed. Panic set in only when the captor, Rohit Aarrya, pulled out a gun and an iron rod and threatened to kill them, according to chilling victim accounts.Police said Aarrya came prepared - rags sprayed with chemicals were placed around the duplex studio and on the floor to start a fire if things went wrong, motion detectors were fixed at the main door, and moving cameras were set up on all floors.A policeman said Aarrya had read out his web series script to 23 shortlisted children and their parents during the audition of 36 hopefuls, convincing them that a hostage scene would be filmed on the final day of a five-day shoot. ""Only 17 of the 23 children attended preparations at the studio for four days,"" he said. These ""preparations"" lulled the eight boys and nine girls, aged 10 to 15, who arrived at the studio at 8am on Thursday, into a false sense of safety.A few hours later, some children sensed something was wrong and began screaming. That, said a cop, enraged Aarrya. ""He began waving an airgun and an iron rod at us, shouting he would kill us all,"" recalled one of the girls.""It was only then that we realised this was no longer fiction.""When police entered, they found the children with their mouths taped, and some with their hands tied. They had been denied food for hours as Aarrya kept shifting them from one room to another. ""While negotiating over phone, we could hear children screaming. He watched us from behind closed sliding glass doors with dark curtains. At intervals, he would run back into the room and drag five children out,"" said an officer. ""This continued for almost two hours,"" he added.At least 15 children were confined to a room on the upper floor. ""The studio had two floors. There were two rooms, a narrow passage, and a small hall on the lower floor, while upper floor had two rooms, a hall, a passage, and a toilet,"" the officer said. It is alleged Aarrya carried a petrol can to threaten the children. One girl's 75-year-old grandmother was also trapped inside.Aarrya's production assistant, Rohan Aher, was locked in a separate room and threatened at gunpoint. Aher told cops he had no idea of Aarrya's plan. Aarrya was listed as the producer, scriptwriter, and planner of the series. ""We didn't know he had weapons or inflammable material,"" Aher said, adding he managed to speak to police officers through a window while Aarrya was in another room talking to police and parents.Aarrya had also recorded a video stating he had abandoned thoughts of suicide and planned the ""hostage"" situation to get his ""demands"" met. Police said the video was sent via WhatsApp to two acquaintances from the auditions at 1.45pm Thursday, who alerted police. A team reached the site by 2.15pm, and after nearly two hours of negotiations, the operation ended with Aarrya's death by 4pm.","Rohit Aarrya, a producer, scriptwriter, and planner of a web series, held 17 children hostage at a recording studio in Mumbai. The children, aged 10 to 15, had their mouths taped and their hands tied. Police say the hostage crisis had been planned for over a month.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125008048,imgsize-1132598,width-400,resizemode-4/mumbai-hostage-crisis-file-photo.jpg"

MUMBAI: A 45-year-old social entrepreneur who ran a project for the state govt held 17 children, aged 12-15, a 75-year-old woman and his staffer hostage for three hours at a recording studio in Powai Thursday afternoon after calling them for auditions for a web series.The crisis ended after a police commando team stormed the studio following failed negotiations. Police said they shot him in the chest in self-defence after he fired from an air gun. He was declared dead in hospital.Police said Aarrya owned a company, Apsara Media, that directed awareness videos on social causes and had extensively worked with children.They said he had been holding auditions at RA Studio in Powai for the past five days for a web series he was planning. Thursday was the final casting call.Auditions began at 10am and the children—hailing from Navi Mumbai, Kolhapur, Satara, Sangli and other parts of the state—arrived earlier, said a security guard at Mahavir Classik, which housed the studio.The hostage drama played out after the captor, Rohit Aarrya, who had been living in a relative’s Chembur flat for the past few days, released a video saying he wanted “simple answers” to some questions and threatened to set the place ablaze if there was any move made to challenge him.In the clip, which was circulated to many media outlets, he said he was not a terrorist and only wanted “to be heard”. “Instead of dying by suicide, I have held some children hostage,” he said.The captor, Rohit Aarrya , was a social entrepreneur and project management consultant who owned a company, Apsara Media, that directed awareness videos on social causes.His social media profile showed he was an alumnus of Symbiosis International University, Pune, and had completed an executive MBA from ISB, Mumbai.He had worked extensively with children on the central govt’s Swacchh Bharat initiative, saying he was inspired by PM Narendra Modi’s plan for cleanliness in public spaces.Since 2017, Aarrya had engaged actors, including Prem Chopra, to enact short videos to generate awareness. He claimed actor Ramesh Deo as his mentor. His social media profiles contain pictures of ministers and a few celebrities.He said he had taken the children hostage “according to a plan”. “I really want to conduct the ‘Let’s Change’ programme. I am going to do it. If I am alive, then I will do it. If I die, then someone else will do it. But it will definitely happen,” he said.His tone then turned menacing. “It will happen with these kids only if they are not harmed. Because the slightest wrong move from your end will trigger me to set this place on fire and die in it.Whether I die or not, the kids will definitely be unnecessarily hurt and traumatised. I don’t know what will happen to them. If something does happen to them, I should not be held responsible.""Those persons should be held responsible who are triggering this unnecessarily, when a normal, common person just wants to talk. After my discussions are over, I will come out myself. I am not alone. I have more people with me. Many people have similar problems as mine. And I am going to give this solution only by talking. Please do not trigger me to do some harm to anybody.”Police spent nearly two hours trying to negotiate with the captor, Rohit Aarrya, and gauge his demands, but he refused to cooperate, even after one of the girls’ parents said she suffered from seizures, cops said. An official said he appeared calm when police spoke to him.City police chief Deven Bharti maintained that Aarrya fired first, prompting retaliatory police firing.“Regardless of his demands, we couldn’t let him play with lives. Our team fired back in self-defence. There was no other option.”Other officials reiterated that the safety of those held captive was the priority, adding that the team’s response was measured and as per the protocol. The death prompted calls by legal experts for a magisterial inquiry.","Rohit Aarrya, 45, held 17 children, aged 12-15, a 75-year-old woman and his staffer hostage for three hours at a recording studio in Powai.

Cody Rhodes and Drew McIntyre's contract signing



WWE SmackDown presented the go-home edition of Saturday Night's Main Event on October 31 from the Delta Center in Salt Lake City, Utah. The show began on a chaotic note and then saw a highly explosive US title open challenge match, followed by other exciting and thrilling in-ring encounters. The night came to an end with Cody Rhodes and Drew McIntyre meeting for a contract signing where the Scottish Warrior crossed the line with him. However, as the show came to a close, it was him who eventually stood tall.Tiffany Stratton rushed down to the ring even before her music hit and called out Jade Cargill for attacking her. GM Nick Aldis came out and told Stratton to hold it off until tomorrow for her match against Cargill at WWE Saturday Night's Main Event. The Storm then also came out and mocked Stratton, leading her to go after Cargill until security intervened to keep them separated.As Nathan Frazer was making his way to answer Ilja Dragunov's US title open challenge, Tomasso Ciampa came down to try and take his opportunity. However, Dragunov instead chose Frazer, and both superstars gave a highly captivating and intense match that led to fans erupting in a 'This is Awesome' chant.Following the exciting bout, the last minute saw Dragunov hit the H-bomb on Frazer to retain his title. Ciampa came out again and attacked Frazer as he was leaving the ringside area.Both superstars engaged in a back-and-forth contest on WWE SmackDown this week. The match saw The Miz interfere and drive Carmelo Hayes's face into the ring post. Kit Wilson tried to capitalize but failed, leading to Hayes delivering the First 48 to win the match. However, Miz blindsided him with an attack and laid him out with a Skull Crushing Finale.Former friends turned rivals, Alexa Bliss and Nia Jax had an exciting match on SmackDown. Despite the size disadvantage, Bliss held her own against the powerful Jax. In the final moments, he was going for the Annihilator only for Charlotte Flair to cause a distraction. This gave Bliss enough time to drop The Irresistible Force on the mat and cover her for the pinfall.Alex Shelly and Chris Sabin squared off against J.C. Matteo and Tama Tonga in tag team action. Both sides displayed an excellent showing as a unit, delivering a thrilling contest. In the end, Tama hit the cutthroat finisher on Sabian to pick up the win.

However, they were taken out and overpowered as Solo Sikoa and MFT stood tall.Both superstars met in the ring for the contract signing for their Undisputed WWE Title match at Saturday Night's Main Event. Drew McIntyre refused to sign it stating that Cody Rhodes would use easy means like DQ or countout to retain the title. As he was leaving, Rhodes stopped him saying that if he could disqualified or counted out, he will lose his title, to which McIntyre agreed. Both exchanged jabs until McIntyre brought up his daughters, leading to Rhodes striking him. However, McIntyre escaped only to come back and hit a Claymore and drop Rhodes on the table to end the show.Also read: WWE stars Bray Wyatt and Bo Dallas’ father Mike Rotunda in Hospice care, confirms former tag team partner

What It Means for Atlanta

Thecould be preparing to make one of the biggest moves of the 2026 offseason, potentially acquiring. A trade for Skubal, whose projected market value hovers around $400 million, would form a dominant rotation trio alongside Chris Sale and Spencer Strider, instantly elevating the Braves’ World Series aspirations.Heading into 2026, Atlanta Braves’ front office - led by Alex Anthopoulos - is expected to focus heavily on both the bullpen and starting rotation. The bullpen remains the team’s most pressing concern after inconsistencies during key moments of the 2025 season.One key decision involves reliever Tyler Kinley, who emerged as one of the most reliable arms for the Atlanta Braves last year.“So far, he’s proved to be a steal. In 21 games pitched since coming to Atlanta, Kinley has a 0.41 ERA and a 0.73 WHIP over 22 innings of work. He’s averaging nearly a strikeout per inning as well. It was a low-risk gamble that brought high reward,” wrote SI’s Harrison Smajovits. (H/t: Sporting News)For just $6.5 million, the Braves have the opportunity to retain a quality late-inning option. If Kinley continues his impressive form, this decision could be one of the most cost-effective bullpen moves of the offseason.While bullpen reinforcements are vital, the Braves are reportedly eyeing a blockbuster trade for Tarik Skubal, one of MLB’s most dominant starting pitchers. Skubal has just one year of team control remaining, which could make him available if the Tigers look to maximize his trade value before free agency.HTHB’s Eric Cole highlighted the potential challenge and magnitude of the move: “Okay, this is the big one and also the toughest one to pull off. The Braves want starting pitching depth and there is a good chance that soon-to-be multiple Cy Young winning Tarik Skubal is available in the right trade.”Cole also suggested that a trade package similar to the one used to land Kyle Tucker last offseason could be a realistic starting point for negotiations.Here’s the revised and properly formatted table you asked for:While such a deal would come at a steep cost, the payoff could be enormous. Adding Skubal would immediately create one of the most fearsome pitching rotations in the league.If the Atlanta Braves were to acquire Skubal, their projected top three starters would be:1. Tarik Skubal – Cy Young contender, elite left-hander2. Chris Sale – Veteran ace with championship pedigree3. Spencer Strider – Strikeout machine and franchise cornerstoneAtlanta would be a nightmare for opposing hitters thanks to this trio's ideal combination of power, experience, and left-right balance.For General Manager Alex Anthopoulos, landing Tarik Skubal would be a career-defining move - one that could be remembered for years in Atlanta Braves history. It would not only reinforce the team’s championship window but also address the long-term stability of the rotation as veterans age.Also read: MLB trade rumors: New York Mets predicted to land $150 million Philadelphia Phillies star to bolster team and title chances As Eric Cole summarized, this would be “the toughest one to pull off,” but it’s exactly the kind of bold decision that could make the Atlanta Braves unstoppable in 2026 and beyond. If Anthopoulos pulls the trigger, this could be remembered as the defining trade that set the stage for another Braves dynasty.","The Atlanta Braves could be preparing to make one of the biggest moves of the 2026 offseason, potentially acquiring.

Moore helped Swift embrace her natural movement, transforming insecurity into a powerful stage presence. This journey of self-acceptance and hard work defined Swift's record-breaking Eras Tour, showcasing her evolution as an inspiring performer.

Taylor Swift’s choreographer reveals how she overcame her dance anxiety





Taylor Swift’s work ethic and vision impressed her creative team





Even for someone as globally celebrated as Taylor Swift , confidence hasn’t always come easily, especially when it comes to dancing. While the 14-time Grammy winner is known for commanding the stage with charisma and storytelling, her choreographer Mandy Moore recently revealed that Swift once struggled deeply with how the world viewed her as a performer.According to Moore, the pop icon was “really in her head” after years of being unfairly criticized for her dance moves. But through hard work, creativity, and a little self-acceptance, Swift turned that insecurity into one of her biggest strengths, transforming her stage presence into a symbol of empowerment and authenticity that defined her record-breaking Eras Tour.Mandy Moore, the creative mind behind Swift’s Eras Tour choreography, told The Mirror that the singer had “gotten a bad rap for a long time about her dancing.” To help her break free from that self-consciousness, Moore decided to focus on Swift’s natural movement rather than forcing traditional dance routines.“We shifted the focus to how movement was already manifesting in her body — the way she naturally wanted to move,” Moore explained. “And then we fine-tuned that, ‘OK, that looks a little weird with your shoulders,’ or, ‘Let’s straighten your knee here.’”The choreographer’s approach celebrated Swift’s individuality rather than suppressing it, allowing her to find confidence in being uniquely herself, a quality that fans connected with deeply during her tour.Moore praised Swift’s dedication and clarity of vision, telling The New York Times, “I really admire Taylor’s tenacity. She works so hard. Whatever I was putting down, she was picking up. And she’s very clear about what she wants, which I love.”That discipline and creative focus not only helped Swift regain confidence in her dancing but also cemented her status as a true performer. As she continues preparing for her upcoming documentary Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour | The End of an Era, her journey from insecurity to empowerment proves that even the world’s biggest star is still evolving and inspiring others to do the same.Also Read: Plans for kids already in motion as Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce plan their 2026 nuptials","Taylor Swift’s choreographer, Mandy Moore, revealed the pop icon's past dance anxieties stemming from public criticism.

Former Seattle Mariners pitcher Yoervis Medina passes away leaving a huge baseball legacy



Remembering Yoervis Medina’s impact and legacy



The baseball world is mourning the sudden loss of former Seattle Mariners pitcher Yoervis Medina, who passed away at the age of 37. Reports from Venezuela, Medina’s home country, confirmed that the former MLB reliever suffered a suspected heart attack while driving, leading to a fatal car crash in the city of Naguanagua, Carabobo. The tragic incident reportedly occurred near a local shopping center, where Medina’s vehicle collided with several parked cars before emergency responders pronounced him dead at the scene.The Mariners organization expressed their grief in a statement shared on X writing, “We are saddened to hear of the passing of former Mariners pitcher Yoervis Medina. We extend our deepest sympathies to his family and friends.” Medina’s former minor league team, the Everett AquaSox, also paid tribute, remembering him as a talented pitcher and a kind-hearted teammate.Prior to his untimely demise, Yoervis Medina left a stunning Seattle Mariners legacy. Born in Puerto Cabello, Venezuela, Yoervis Medina’s journey to the big leagues began when he signed with the Seattle Mariners as a 16-year-old amateur free agent in 2005. His determination and raw talent quickly made him a standout in the Mariners’ farm system.After seven years in the minors, Medina finally got the call every player dreams of, it was his MLB debut in April 2013.During his three seasons in the majors, Medina became a reliable arm in Seattle’s bullpen, posting a 2.82 ERA with 147 strikeouts in 141 appearances. Known for his hard fastball and sharp breaking pitches, the right-hander was often praised for his ability to handle high-pressure situations. In May 2015, Medina was traded to the Chicago Cubs in exchange for catcher Welington Castillo, marking the end of his time in Seattle.Although his stint with the Cubs was brief, Medina left behind a reputation for his work ethic and passion for the game. After his MLB chapter, he continued to play internationally, competing in the Venezuelan Winter League and later joining professional teams in Italy and the Czech Republic.Throughout his baseball career, Medina was respected by teammates and coaches alike for his quiet leadership and humility. He may not have been a household name, but those who played alongside him remember his calm nature and love for the sport.His death has been another painful loss for the Mariners family, coming just weeks after the passing of former prospect Jesús Montero in a separate accident in Venezuela. Medina’s name is expected to be written in the Mariners’ history book, celebrating his baseball journey.Also Read: Dodgers receive inspiring World Series boost as Magic Johnson sends emotional pre–Game 6 message of belief","Former Seattle Mariners pitcher Yoervis Medina has passed away at the age of 37.

Brandon Miller’s mother battled cancer privately while supporting her son’s college journey

Surgeries later Yolanda Miller turned pain into her greatest victory

How Yolanda Miller’s cancer battle built Brandon Miller’s unbreakable spirit

Brandon Miller's journey goes beyond just basketball. It's a tale of strength forged through quiet struggles and the resilience of family. Growing up in Tennessee, Brandon was immersed in the values of hard work. His dad, Darrell, played football for Alabama, and his mom, Yolanda, brought the spirit of a runner into their home. When Yolanda faced a breast cancer diagnosis, she opted for silence instead of seeking sympathy.Brandon was still shining on the court, completely unaware of the challenges his mother was going through. When the truth surfaced, the family didn’t break apart. They actually became stronger together. That collective struggle turned into the emotional core of Brandon’s ambition to win, not just in sports but in life overall. His mother’s courage changed pain into strength and assisted him in creating an unyielding spirit that shapes his narrative today.In her younger years, Yolanda was all about track running, using her speed and endurance in her daily routine.Darrell, on the flip side, was a tight end for the University of Alabama's college football team in the early '90s, coached by Gene Stallings.He later considered how he influenced Brandon's direction without any pressure. ""I didn’t talk him into going to the University of Alabama,"" Darrell told the Tuscaloosa News in January 2023. ""I wanted to give him a choice. But in a way, I kind of instilled it in him when he was born. ""Brandon was really influenced by his athletic background. He gives a lot of credit to his parents for shaping his mindset. ""Growing up, my parents instilled in me a relentless work ethic and the belief that I could achieve anything if I put my mind to it,"" Brandon said. ""Their constant encouragement is what drives me to push past my limits on the court.""The couple's older kids got into sports too. Their son Darrell Jr. played basketball at Fisk University and is now playing abroad. Their daughter Britany joined Cumberland University. Sports were a big part of their home, transforming challenges into team efforts.Yolanda waited for months before sharing the news with her children, handling the unknown on her own. She concealed her feelings during Brandon's tournament journey. ""Didn’t tell him. Want him to stay focused,"" she explained to ESPN's Jeremy Schaap in a 2023 interview. ""What he’s doing, he had enough to worry about than have to think about his mom’s health is failing.""As a mother, protection came naturally. ""As a mom, you want to protect your kids and your family at all costs,"" Yolanda said in her October 10, 2025, Spectrum News 1 interview. ""That's what I did. I didn't need them to know that I wasn't doing well."" She faced fears of chemo or radiation sidelining her from games.""You can’t cry enough, you can’t be mad enough, you can’t be disappointed or confused because you’re dealing with the unknown,"" she shared. ""I didn’t know what I was going to experience. I just knew people go through chemo, radiation, and I worried I wouldn’t have the strength to make my kids’ games.""Support anchored her. ""When I tell you the Miller family is my ride or die, they are my ride or die,"" Yolanda told WSOC TV on October 24, 2025. Darrell and the kids rallied once informed, turning her fight into a family stand.The treatment kicked off quickly. The first lumpectomy didn’t get all the tissue out, so she had to go through two more lumpectomies, a double mastectomy, and then reconstruction. Luckily, there was no need for chemo or radiation because it was caught early. By the middle of 2023, the doctors said she was cancer-free.Relief washed over her. ""Now that I’m cancer-free, I’m just happy and excited to be alive and grateful for everybody that was involved,"" Yolanda said. Scars became symbols. ""Seeing the scars is a reminder every day that I’m alive,"" she added to WSOC TV on October 24, 2025.Faith fueled her. ""I didn't give up. No matter what the doctor said, I still had faith,"" Yolanda said in her Spectrum News 1 interview. ""I still had hope that this was going to pass."" She now leads Team Miller Foundation efforts for awareness.Yolanda's struggle reflects Brandon's determination on the court. He leads the Miller Foundation, connecting resources for disadvantaged youth just like his mom did. Her strength in tough times showed him how to keep going. Whether it's Alabama games or NBA nights, the Millers are his support system.""I'm so grateful to be alive,"" Yolanda told. Her message rings clear: ""Breast cancer doesn't always have to be viewed as a death sentence. It's something that if you react fast, this can be something of your past. Just keep the faith.

Theare set to clash in a highly anticipated NBA Cup regular season matchup on October 31, 2025, at the FedExForum in Memphis. Both teams are entering this game with high stakes, as early Cup standings could influence momentum heading into the next phase of the season. However, injuries to key players on both sides threaten to alter the balance of power, adding an extra layer of intrigue to what was already shaping up to be an exciting Western Conference showdown.For the Los Angeles Lakers, this contest serves as a crucial test of depth and adaptability. With LeBron James yet to make his season debut and Luka Doncic nursing multiple injuries, Los Angeles will rely heavily on its supporting cast to carry the load. Meanwhile, the Memphis Grizzlies - though dealing with their own injury challenges - have displayed resilience and competitive spirit in the opening stretch of the season. Their ability to maintain consistency despite missing several key contributors has kept them above .500, showcasing their growing maturity and team cohesion under pressure.As both teams prepare for battle, the focus will not only be on who steps up in the absence of stars but also on which squad can dictate the game’s tempo.The FedExForum crowd is expected to bring high energy as Memphis looks to protect home court, while the Los Angeles Lakers aim to prove that even without their marquee names, they remain a force to be reckoned with in the West.The Memphis Grizzlies come into this game carrying a challenging injury situation, with several key contributors unavailable. Starting center Zach Edey remains sidelined due to a left ankle injury, while Brandon Clarke (right knee), Ty Jerome (right calf), and Scotty Pippen Jr. (left great toe) are all ruled out. On a positive note, guard Vince Williams Jr. is expected to make his season debut after recovering from a right ankle injury that kept him out of the first five games. Despite the injury troubles, Memphis has managed to post a solid 3-2 record, displaying resilience and depth as they navigate the early stages of the season.The Los Angeles Lakers’ situation is even more concerning, with a total of six players appearing on their injury list. Superstar LeBron James remains sidelined with right sciatica and has yet to make his season debut. Luka Doncic, who has been battling a left finger sprain along with a lower left leg contusion, is listed as questionable for the matchup. Marcus Smart is also questionable due to a right quadriceps issue.Among those definitively ruled out are Maxi Kleber (abdominal muscle), Adou Thiero (left knee), and Gabe Vincent (left ankle). The absence of LeBron and the uncertainty surrounding Doncic leave the Los Angeles Lakers’ rotation in flux. However, Austin Reaves has stepped up as the team’s primary offensive weapon, putting up remarkable numbers - averaging 40 points, 10 assists, 5.3 rebounds, and 2.3 steals per game - and keeping Los Angeles competitive during this challenging stretch.With both teams missing multiple key players, the game’s outcome could hinge on which side better compensates for its absences. The Memphis Grizzlies will sorely miss the size and defensive presence of Zach Edey, which could leave their interior defense and rebounding vulnerable. On the other hand, the Lakers’ lack of LeBron James and the uncertainty over Doncic’s availability threaten to undermine their offensive flow and leadership on the court.Still, Austin Reaves’ recent surge provides a glimmer of hope for Los Angeles. His dominant performances have injected life into the team, but the supporting cast will need to elevate their play to keep pace with a Grizzlies squad known for its grit and tenacity. Memphis, despite its own injury struggles, has shown strong adaptability and will look to exploit any weaknesses in the Lakers’ shorthanded lineup.Fans can expect an intriguing contest filled with tension and unpredictability. Will Doncic return to give the Los Angeles Lakers the boost they need, or will the Memphis Grizzlies capitalize on their opponents’ injury woes to secure a key early-season victory?Tip-off for this Western Conference showdown is scheduled for 9:30 PM ET at the FedExForum in Memphis, as both teams aim to overcome adversity and keep their NBA Cup campaigns on track.","The Los Angeles Lakers and Memphis Grizzlies are set to clash in a highly anticipated NBA Cup regular season matchup on October 31, 2025, at the FedExForum in Memphis.

What to Expect from Tonight’s Boston Celtics vs Philadelphia 76ers Matchup Tonight?

Thesquare off in a highly anticipated regular season matchup on October 31, 2025, marking one of the early headline clashes of the 2025–26 NBA season. Both teams come into the contest looking to establish their dominance in the Eastern Conference, with the Sixers seeking to preserve their perfect record and the Celtics aiming to extend their winning streak.The game carries significant importance beyond the court, as both franchises face notable injury setbacks that reshape their rotations and strategic outlooks. With championship aspirations on the line, coaches Joe Mazzulla and Nick Nurse have to make crucial adjustments to keep their teams competitive despite missing key contributors. This matchup is also viewed as an early test of depth and adaptability, with fans eager to see which side could overcome adversity to seize control of their conference trajectory. Boston Celtics enter the clash with a relatively healthy roster but faced the major absence of star forward Jayson Tatum. The All-Star suffered a right Achilles tendon injury earlier in the season that is expected to sideline him for most, if not all, of the campaign.His absence dealt a major blow to Boston’s offensive rhythm and leadership on the floor. Aside from Tatum, the Celtics enjoy a clean bill of health, allowing players like Jaylen Brown and Derrick White to take on expanded roles as the team looked to sustain its winning momentum.The injury situation is more concerning for the 76ers, who entered the game without several key contributors. Paul George remains out following arthroscopic surgery on his left knee during the offseason and has yet to make his season debut. Forward Dominick Barlow is also sidelined due to a laceration on his right elbow, while rookie guard Jared McCain continues recovering from thumb surgery. These absences force Philadelphia to lean on its younger players and test its roster depth.Despite these setbacks, reigning MVP Joel Embiid is cleared to play, though his minutes are being carefully managed due to an ongoing knee issue. His limited court time - around 20 minutes per game - will be crucial for maintaining the Sixers’ rhythm on both ends of the floor. Embiid’s availability gives Philadelphia a significant boost as they look to maintain their undefeated 4-0 start.The contrasting health situations highlight two different challenges. The Celtics, still adjusting to life without Tatum, are relying heavily on Brown’s scoring and White’s playmaking to carry the offensive load. Boston had recently regained form with back-to-back wins, including a 125-105 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers.For the 76ers, depth is the defining issue. George’s absence creates a hole on the wing that young forward Justin Edwards could attempt to fill, though replicating George’s two-way production proved difficult. Without Barlow and McCain, Philadelphia’s bench rotation is thinner than usual, placing additional pressure on Embiid, Tyrese Maxey, Kelly Oubre Jr., and rookie V.J. Edgecombe to perform consistently.Injuries inevitably shape the dynamics of this Eastern Conference showdown. While Boston grapples with losing its franchise cornerstone, Philadelphia faces a cluster of absences that will test its balance. Yet, the matchup promises competitive fire, as both teams seek to make an early statement in the season’s opening stretch..","The Boston Celtics and Philadelphia 76ers square off in a highly anticipated regular season matchup on October 31, 2025.

Gibson shared her own journey of adjusting to NFL life, emphasizing that family remains the priority despite the lifestyle's inherent uncertainties.

Family comes first despite the uncertainty of the NFL lifestyle





Also read:

When Cardi B announced she was expecting her fourth child — her first with New England Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs — fans everywhere celebrated. But Victoria Gibson, wife of Patriots running back Antonio Gibson, had a different idea: she wanted to personally welcome the rapper into the NFL’s WAG (wives and girlfriends) community, inviting her to experience the fun, camaraderie and traditions of game-day tailgates alongside players’ families.Gibson teamed up with fellow WAG Jayda Kamryn Hawkins to post a fun Instagram video inviting Cardi to a tailgate they were hosting that weekend. “Hey Cardi, it’s two of your future favorite WAGs,” Gibson said in the clip, adding, “A lot of people are looking forward to meeting you.”In an interview with PEOPLE, Gibson explained why the invitation was important. “We were thinking about the tailgate and how much fun it was going to be, and that’s when we were like, ‘Oh, we should invite her,’” she said. “We want to extend that invitation to everybody that’s part of the family — part of the community — who wants to come, so that’s why we wanted to make sure she knew.”Gibson admitted it’s unclear if Cardi saw the message. “We didn’t know how to get in touch with her. I don’t know if she’s seen it.” Even without Cardi attending, Gibson says the tailgate was a success, drawing roughly 50 guests who shared food, danced, and made TikToks together. “She might be like, ‘Girl, get off of me, but that’s just who I am,’” Gibson laughed. “She has nothing to be nervous about if she’s got me!”Gibson admits she didn’t grow up knowing much about football.“I had to Google what ‘Redskins’ was because it sounded really familiar,” she said. “I only attended Super Bowl parties for the Rotel dip and for the halftime show. So no, I didn’t know anything about football.” Today, her NFL life includes wrangling her children on game day, cheering for Antonio from the family section at Gillette Stadium, and joining him for postgame meals. “They do a lot of nice things for us,” she said of the Patriots.Gibson also acknowledges the uncertainty of the NFL lifestyle. “I think about it — is this the year we have to move again? You could have to go from the East Coast to the West Coast.”Still, family comes first. She and Antonio, who married earlier this year, have vowed never to split their household no matter where his career takes them. Recently, the family enjoyed a trip to the Big E state fair following Antonio’s record-breaking 90-yard kickoff return touchdown.","Victoria Gibson, wife of Patriots running back Antonio Gibson, invited Cardi B to a tailgate they were hosting.

Offset throws direct shade at Cardi B and Stefon Diggs in “No Sweat” from Haunted by Fame

Cardi B steps forward with Stefon Diggs amid the chaos

Offset turned Halloween into more than just a night of tricks and treats — it became a full-blown lyrical ambush. The rapper shocked fans by dropping his surprise album Haunted by Fame on October 31, and one track in particular, “No Sweat,” instantly lit up the internet. The song’s aggressive tone and pointed lyrics seemed aimed straight at his estranged wife, Cardi B, and her boyfriend, NFL wide receiver Stefon Diggs.This latest release feels like Offset’s most personal outburst since the couple’s public split. Known for turning pain into performance, the former Migos star poured raw emotion into every bar. Yet, one explosive line stood out from the rest — a brutal basketball-themed metaphor that fans quickly decoded as a direct jab at Cardi’s new relationship.On “No Sweat,” Offset delivers a verse that left no room for guessing: “How the f* you leave Jordan for Rodman? / You a fool if you think that I’m hurt.” The reference to NBA legends Michael Jordan and Dennis Rodman instantly caught attention, with fans interpreting Offset as the “Jordan” in the comparison — disciplined, accomplished, and steady — and Diggs as “Rodman,” wild and unpredictable. The lyric set social media ablaze within hours, with thousands of fans dissecting its meaning and debating its intent.Offset didn’t stop there. He followed up with another sting: “You ain’t happy, I know how it work / How you married and still givin’ birth? / Get some help, bitch, you goin’ berserk.” The timing of these lines raised eyebrows, coming months after Cardi filed for divorce in July 2024. She later accused Offset of dragging out the process, claiming he demanded she cover his tax debts before finalizing the split.While Offset aired his frustrations through music, Cardi B appeared unbothered. The Grammy winner confirmed she’s expecting her fourth child — her first with Stefon Diggs — and made it clear she’s moved on. She shares three children with Offset: Kulture, 7, Wave, 4, and Blossom, 13 months.Offset’s Haunted by Fame proves that their story is far from over. The music may change, but the emotions behind it keep fueling hip-hop’s most headline-grabbing feud.Also Read: Brotherhood over Rivalry: Jordan Love and Aaron Rodgers’ post-game exchange steals spotlight after Packers beat Steelers","Migos rapper Offset dropped his surprise album Haunted by Fame on October 31.

The Challenge Ahead: Facing a Healthy Memphis Squad

Final Outlook: A Game-Time Decision That Could Define the Night

Theare set for an exciting NBA Cup showdown against the Memphis Grizzlies tonight, but all eyes are on one question - willfinally return to the lineup? With the Lakers eager to build momentum early in the season, Doncic’s availability could be the difference between victory and another test of depth for JJ Redick’s squad.Both the Lakers and the Grizzlies are off to competitive starts, and their clash in Memphis promises high-intensity basketball. For Los Angeles, having their superstar back could tip the scales, especially after a string of gritty performances without him. Fans across the league are eagerly refreshing injury updates as tip-off approaches, hoping to see Doncic’s name officially cleared to play.Luka Doncic, who has been out for the last three games, is officially listed as questionable for tonight’s October 31 contest against the Memphis Grizzlies . The Los Angeles Lakers star has been managing multiple injuries - a sprain in his left finger and a contusion to his lower left leg - both sustained during the Lakers’ 124-119 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves on October 24. Despite being visibly in pain, Doncic showcased his trademark toughness by finishing that game, even requiring on-court treatment for his left hand.Since then, the Lakers have taken a cautious approach with their new franchise cornerstone. The team upgraded Luka Doncic’s status to questionable, indicating he’s making progress but remains a game-time decision. Head coach JJ Redick recently noted that while Doncic is “very close to returning,” the staff will prioritize long-term health over rushing him back too soon.A return in the next couple of games appears highly likely, even if he sits out tonight.In Luka Doncic’s absence, the Los Angeles Lakers have managed to stay competitive, going 2-1 in their last three games. Austin Reaves, in particular, has stepped up as a surprising leader, shouldering the offensive load with composure and confidence. His playmaking and perimeter shooting have kept the Lakers’ offense fluid, while teammates like D’Angelo Russell and Rui Hachimura have provided valuable support on both ends of the court.JJ Redick’s system has emphasized ball movement and defense, helping the Lakers stay afloat without their primary scorer. However, there’s no denying the void left by Doncic’s all-around brilliance. His ability to create shots, orchestrate plays, and deliver in clutch moments remains irreplaceable, and his return could reignite the Lakers’ offensive rhythm.Before the injury setback, Luka Doncic was off to one of the most explosive starts of his career. Through his first two games, he averaged a staggering 46 points, 11.5 rebounds, and 8.5 assists - numbers that reflect his MVP-caliber influence. His combination of elite scoring and playmaking has transformed the Lakers’ offense, giving them a dynamic edge few teams can match.If Doncic suits up tonight, expect the Los Angeles Lakers to reestablish their inside-out attack, leveraging his pick-and-roll chemistry with Anthony Davis and his ability to collapse defenses to free up shooters. Conversely, if he remains out, the Lakers will rely heavily on Reaves and Russell to initiate plays while leaning on their defensive identity to keep the Grizzlies contained.The Memphis Grizzlies enter this contest with a 3-2 record and a mostly healthy lineup, posing a formidable challenge for the visiting Lakers. Their fast-paced, aggressive style - anchored by Ja Morant’s explosiveness and Jaren Jackson Jr.’s defensive versatility - makes them one of the toughest teams to beat at home. The Grizzlies’ balanced scoring and energetic bench could exploit any rust the Lakers show if Doncic sits out again.Still, Los Angeles has shown resilience and adaptability, finding ways to win even without their top star. With a deep roster and a motivated locker room, they remain capable of pulling off an upset - especially if Reaves and Davis can replicate their recent form.As of now, Luka Doncic’s participation remains uncertain. The Los Angeles Lakers have listed him as questionable, and his return will likely depend on how he responds during pregame warmups. Even if he doesn’t suit up tonight, fans can take solace in the fact that his comeback is imminent - possibly within the next couple of games.Whether or not Doncic plays, tonight’s matchup between the Los Angeles Lakers and Memphis Grizzlies promises intensity, emotion, and elite basketball. A healthy Doncic would give the Lakers a major boost, but even in his absence, the team has proven capable of grinding out wins through collective effort and strong leadership from its supporting cast.Also read: Los Angeles Lakers vs Memphis Grizzlies regular season injury report: Who's playing, who's out, and more (October 31, 2025) All eyes will be on FedExForum as tip-off approaches.

Randi Mahomes reflects on the early days of Patrick and Brittany’s love story



A family built on connection, love, and loyalty



For years, Patrick and Brittany Mahomes have been hailed as one of the NFL’s ultimate power couples, a blend of athletic success, family values, and celebrity charm. But behind their picture-perfect story lies a foundation built on genuine friendship and unwavering family support. Recently, Patrick’s mother, Randi Mahomes, opened up about her heartwarming relationship with Brittany, revealing how she has grown to see her as much more than her son’s wife.During a recent podcast appearance, Randi shared rare insights into how Patrick’s high school friendship with Brittany slowly evolved into romance. “He didn’t really share like his personal stuff at first,” she admitted. “But then, you know, kind of hearing it now and then how they started dating, I’m like, I can totally see that. And then once they did, it was all in.”According to Randi, Brittany had been part of their family long before fame and Super Bowl rings entered the picture. “I think he was a sophomore or junior, it was all in. And I say she’s been around since my daughter was two, so 14 years she’s been around,” she said with warmth. “She’s like a daughter to me. I’ve kind of helped, maybe not raise her, but she grew up with Patrick and was always around.We’ve always been very close. ”Randi also shared that even during Patrick’s college years, Brittany made an effort to stay close to the family. “She’ll call me — we’ll keep in touch, especially when he was in college. And we would always hang out whenever he came home,” Randi revealed.Today, Brittany is a constant presence not only in Patrick’s life but also in the Kansas City Chiefs’ stands, cheering alongside Randi and their two children, Sterling and Bronze. Her growing brand, including her Chiefs-themed apparel line with Abercrombie & Fitch, reflects her passion for football, fashion, and family. Randi proudly commented online, “Love these so much!!!”As Patrick balances the pressures of another demanding NFL season, his mother’s words highlight the enduring strength behind the Mahomes family dynamic, a reminder that, beyond the fame and trophies, love and loyalty remain their true foundation.Also Read: Brittany Mahomes takes command of the household, and Patrick openly admits she’s the real head coach","Patrick Mahomes' mother, Randi, revealed her deep bond with Brittany, viewing her as a daughter.

Is Jamal Murray playing tonight?

The teams are off to strong starts when the Portland Trail Blazers take on the Denver Nuggets at 10 p.m. ET on Friday. Meanwhile, Jamal Murray, the All-Star point guard for the Denver Nuggets, has continued to write a brilliant start to the 2025–26 season.However, his speed recently got halted as he was listed on the Nuggets' injury report with a doubtful tag. This is due to the soreness in his left calf before their NBA Cup game against the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday night.After losing to Golden State on opening night, Denver has won three straight games, including Wednesday night's 122-88 victory. On the other hand, Portland lost their first game, but they have since won three of four games, including two in a row.Despite spending the whole last game on the bench, Murray managed to play 25 minutes, which is the fourth most of any player on the club. He struggled with the same issue in the 2024 postseason, and it was evident that it affected him when he faced a physically demanding Timberwolves team in the Conference Semifinals.Denver announced their official report to the NBA on Thursday, listing Murray as questionable with left calf tightness. The team wrote on X:“Injury Report ahead of tomorrow's game against the Trail Blazers: PROBABLE: Cameron Johnson (Right Shoulder Inflammation) QUESTIONABLE: Jamal Murray (Left Calf Tightness) #MileHighBasketball.”Murray has put on a number of incredible performances and averaged 27.0 points, 6.0 assists, and 4.3 rebounds for Denver in their first four games of the season. However, a recent update from the Nuggets has raised doubts about his availability for their first NBA Cup game of the year.Given that Murray's amazing start to the new season was halted by a calf injury, Denver could be better off either keeping him out of their next game completely or thinking about limiting his minutes.Murray would probably face Portland's All-Defensive Team-caliber forward Toumani Camara if he were to play for the Nuggets on Friday night. This would be a one-on-one match that would require the 28-year-old guard to put in a lot of effort and use extra force in an attempt to get open looks.Murray has averaged 27 points per game on 50/41/94 shooting splits so far this season, which is comparable to his 2023 Western Conference Finals performance against the Lakers, when he averaged 30 points.He has only averaged 15.8 points a game in October throughout his career, which is significantly lower than his numbers. He's made significant progress this season in an attempt to earn his first All-Star selection, but the much-needed momentum he's established from the start could be derailed if this injury keeps him out for a while.Injury has been a major factor, and his persistent calf problems are also a worry. Throughout his career, he has struggled with left calf pain, most notably during the 2024 NBA Playoffs. His next chance would be on Monday at home against the Sacramento Kings if he is unable to play on Friday.Also read: Portland Trail Blazers Vs Minnesota Timberwolves (10-22-2025) game preview: When and where to watch, expected lineup, prediction, and more",Denver Nuggets face Portland Trail Blazers at 10 p.m. ET on Friday.

NHL trade rumors grow around New Jersey Devils’ Nico Daws



Jacob Markstrom’s return adds uncertainty to the Devils’ goaltending plan



Possible trade destinations and scenarios for Nico Daws



The New Jersey Devils are once again making headlines in the latest NHL trade rumors, this time surrounding young goaltender Nico Daws. After a string of sharp performances, Daws has proven he’s ready for consistent NHL action; however, with veterans Jacob Markstrom and Jake Allen also in the mix, the Devils face a difficult roster decision as the season progresses.The challenge for New Jersey lies in roster management and waiver rules. Once Daws crosses the 30-day or 10-game threshold at the NHL level, he’ll require waivers to be reassigned to the AHL. Losing a promising 24-year-old goaltender for nothing would be a setback, making a mid-season trade a realistic option for general manager Tom Fitzgerald.Nico Daws’ steady play has not gone unnoticed by scouts across the league. His recent outing against the Minnesota Wild showed poise and confidence under pressure. Further fueling speculation that the Devils might use his value in trade discussions, NHL insiders believe multiple teams are monitoring his situation. Particularly those struggling with goalie depth or injuries early in the season.The return of Jacob Markstrom from injury could significantly impact how the Devils handle their goaltending trio, Markstrom’s veteran presence and Jake Allen’s experience make it challenging to keep all three goaltenders on the roster, and with the Devils pushing for playoff positioning.Now, Daws could be the odd man out unless a suitable trade emerges.Teams like the Vegas Golden Knights and Ottawa Senators. The Buffalo Sabres could be interested if their goalie depth weakens. A trade involving Daws might bring back a young forward or a mid-round pick. For now, New Jersey seems patient, but if the market heats up, expect calls to start soon.Also Read: Latest update on former Anaheim Ducks star Ryan Kesler’s criminal sexual conduct allegations","The New Jersey Devils are once again making headlines in the latest NHL trade rumors, this time surrounding young goaltender Nico Daws.

He chose a deal that keeps his salary lower than he could have earned. This decision allows the team more money to sign other players. McDavid expressed his view that elite hockey players should earn more. His focus remains on winning championships for Edmonton.

Connor McDavid calls contract comparisons with Kaprizov “unfair”

Connor McDavid prioritizes winning over wealth in Edmonton

Edmonton Oilers captain Connor McDavid made it clear he isn’t interested in being part of any salary comparison talk, especially after signing his latest extension. The three-time Hart Trophy winner recently agreed to a two-year deal worth $12.5 million annually, keeping him among the NHL’s highest-paid players. But when conversations shifted toward Minnesota Wild forward Kirill Kaprizov ’s massive eight-year, $136 million contract, McDavid brushed off the comparisons.Known for his laser focus on performance rather than paychecks, the Oilers star emphasized that money doesn’t define his career goals or commitment to Edmonton. For McDavid, it’s about championships, not contract sizes,another reminder that his mindset remains firmly on winning, not competing in the league’s financial spotlight.Speaking to The Athletic, Connor McDavid made it clear that each player’s situation is unique. “It’s two completely different situations,” he said. “It’s unfair for people to say a bad thing about anybody. Everybody who plays in this league earns it. Everybody who makes money in this league earns that. It’s different situations, different cap situations, different teams, different constructs.”Rather than chasing the biggest paycheck, McDavid chose stability with a purpose.His short-term deal gives Edmonton flexibility — a rare move for a player of his caliber. While many expected the league’s most dominant forward to cash in with a long-term deal, McDavid’s focus wasn’t on personal gain but on helping the Oilers finally reach their Stanley Cup goal.McDavid’s decision comes after back-to-back Stanley Cup Final losses, leaving him determined to finish what he started. “It’s not a hard calculation to figure out,” he explained. “Obviously, the feeling was I was going to get some raise. The money they’ve gotten back is money they can go spend. That was the feeling.”Teammates have taken notice of his leadership. Defenseman Darnell Nurse praised the captain’s selflessness, saying, “He left a lot of money on the table. For us as a team, it shows how much he wants to win and his willingness to sacrifice for the group. That’s your captain leading by example.”McDavid’s extension may only run through 2028, but it sends a clear message Edmonton’s championship window is open now, and their leader is all in.Also Read: How Connor McDavid and Lauren Kyle quietly became hockey’s answer to Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen",Connor McDavid recently signed a two-year contract extension worth $12.5 million annually.

Most runs in T20Is

4234 - Babar Azam

4231 - Rohit Sharma

4188 - Virat Kohli

3869 - Jos Buttler

3710 - Paul Stirling

Pakistan’s premier batter Babar Azam etched his name into cricket’s record books on Friday, surpassing Rohit Sharma to become the highest run-scorer in men’s T20 internationals, as Pakistan crushed South Africa by nine wickets to level the three-match series 1-1.Babar, recalled for his first T20 series in nearly a year, needed just nine runs to go past Rohit’s tally of 4,231 runs. The former Pakistan captain reached the milestone in his typically composed fashion — with a gentle single driven off spinner Donovan Ferreira to long-off — before finishing unbeaten on 11. He now has 4,234 runs in 130 matches, including 36 fifties and three centuries, at a strike rate of 129.The record comes as a moment of redemption for the 31-year-old, who had missed the chance to break it in the first match after falling for a two-ball duck. His return among runs — and to Pakistan’s T20 setup — was timely, following criticism over his exclusion from the Asia Cup, where Pakistan struggled against India.While Babar’s milestone dominated headlines, it was Saim Ayub’s explosive unbeaten 71 off 38 balls that sealed Pakistan’s emphatic win.The left-hander, who endured a nightmare Asia Cup with four ducks, rediscovered his touch in spectacular style — smashing five sixes and six fours as Pakistan chased down 111 in just 13.1 overs.“Saim is someone who can play for the next 10 years and become the player we all want him to be,” captain Salman Ali Agha said after the game. “We bowled really well up front, and when you bowl that well you’re always going to win the game.”Earlier, Pakistan’s bowlers had dismantled South Africa for 110, with Salman Mirza (3-14) and Faheem Ashraf (4-23) sharing seven wickets.South Africa’s stand-in captain Donovan Ferreira admitted his team was outplayed.“There isn’t much time to reflect,” Ferreira said. “The wicket got a lot better with the dew settling. You just have to move on.”The third and deciding T20 will be played on Saturday, with the series tantalisingly poised — and Babar Azam standing tall as T20 cricket’s new run king.",Babar Azam surpasses Rohit Sharma to become the highest run-scorer in men's T20 internationals.

India vs Australia: Virat Kohli & Rohit Sharma rewrite history at SCG

NEW DELHI: Indian Premier League (IPL) Chairman Arun Dhumal praised Team India’s impressive bench strength while highlighting the talent of 14-year-old prodigy Vaibhav Suryavanshi. He also lauded “greats” Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli for their class, conviction, and work ethic. Dhumal expressed confidence that Rohit and Kohli are far from done in the 50-over format, applauding Rohit’s batting masterclass in the recently concluded three-match ODI series against Australia, where he was named Player of the Series.Rohit and Kohli shrugged off the rust and lack of rhythm from the first two ODIs — both defeats — to launch a stunning counterattack against Australia in the third ODI. Chasing 237, the duo powered India to victory with Rohit slamming an unbeaten 121* and Virat anchoring the innings with a rock-solid, risk-free 74*.The performance sent a strong signal — the icons are not done yet and remain serious contenders for the 2027 ICC Cricket World Cup.""We've been talking about this bench strength of the Indian team for a long, long time. But look at this team, a 14-year-old wonder, Vaibhav Suryavanshi, he's knocking at the door to be part of the team.And then you have these greats like Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, who people think are going, but they are not going. They are here to stay. And the way Rohit has shown his class in this ODI series, at that age, coming as player of the match in the final match and then player of the series, that shows the kind of conviction that they carry, the kind of hard work that they put in. When it comes to Team India, they will want to give it their best. And that is the true reflection of a sportsman. And my best wishes to both of them. They have done wonderful. They have given their life to Indian cricket,"" Dhumal told ANI.The Australia series was a testament to Rohit’s grit, determination, and match-winning ability.From struggling with a single-digit score in Perth to grinding out a valuable 97-ball 73 in Adelaide — where he curbed his natural attacking instincts — and finally unleashing a blistering unbeaten 121 off 125 balls in Sydney, the ‘Hitman’ experienced it all in this 202-run series. He showed the world that his eyes remain firmly set on the 2027 World Cup, determined to meet every fitness and cricketing goal along the way.Following his stellar performance against Australia, Rohit created history on Wednesday by becoming the No. 1-ranked batter in the ICC Men’s ODI Rankings for the first time in his career. He climbed two spots to the top after his unbeaten century in the Sydney ODI, leading India to an emphatic nine-wicket triumph.Rohit’s consistency saw him surpass Afghanistan’s Ibrahim Zadran and India teammate Shubman Gill, claiming the top ODI batter ranking for the first time. The 38-year-old has remained a fixture in the top 10 for most of the past decade.","Indian Premier League (IPL) Chairman Arun Dhumal praised Team India’s impressive bench strength while highlighting the talent of 14-year-old prodigy Vaibhav Suryavanshi.

Abhishek Sharma press conference: On tough Australian conditions, Harshit Rana's fight

NEW DELHI: Former Australia captain Aaron Finch has called on India to restore Arshdeep Singh to the playing XI after their four-wicket defeat to Australia in the second T20I at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) on Friday. Finch argued that India’s team combination leaned too heavily on batting depth, costing them both balance and bowling penetration.Speaking on JioHotstar, Finch said he would be “very surprised” if the left-arm seamer doesn’t return for the next match in Hobart.“Arshdeep Singh should be in the team. I would be very surprised if he doesn’t make it back for the next game,” Finch said. “One thing I’ve learned about T20 cricket — when you go in with too many batters, sometimes the responsibility gets diluted.”Finch elaborated that overloading the side with batting options can have a psychological impact.“Batters subconsciously assume someone else will get the job done. But if you play one fewer batter, it’s amazing how often the rest step up,” he said. “India clearly has the World Cup in mind, and this series is part of finding the right combinations to win that tournament.”Reflecting on the defeat, Finch praised Jasprit Bumrah’s opening spell but felt India lost control after the initial overs.“The first over that Bumrah bowled was really good and gave the Australian openers some headaches,” Finch observed. “But after that, Harshit Rana went for a bit of punishment, Travis Head did most of the damage early on, and then Mitchell Marsh joined in later.”He also felt India’s bowlers were left defending an inadequate total.“There just weren’t enough runs on the board for the bowlers to defend. It wasn’t a massive shortfall, but a few extra runs could have made things very interesting,” Finch said.","Former Australia captain Aaron Finch has called on India to restore Arshdeep Singh to the playing XI.

Abhishek Sharma press conference: On tough Australian conditions, Harshit Rana's fight

Poll Do you agree with Ashwin's assessment that Arshdeep Singh deserves a spot in the starting XI? Yes, he should be in the team. No, there are better options.

Former India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has strongly criticised the team management for leaving out Arshdeep Singh from the playing XI in India’s second T20I against Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) on Friday.India endured a tough outing as they were bundled out for 125 in 18.4 overs, with Josh Hazlewood taking three wickets. Australia chased down the target with ease, winning by four wickets in just 13.2 overs.Speaking on his YouTube channel after the match, Ashwin questioned the selection call, saying that if the management wanted to experiment, it should have been Jasprit Bumrah — not Arshdeep — who was rested.“If you want to experiment, then rest Bumrah. Bumrah is the one with workload management issues. You can rest Bumrah,” Ashwin said. “See, Arshdeep Singh is your leading wicket-taker. When we will play the T20 World Cup, there will be some dew… But this Arshdeep debate is definitely something that’s very sad because Arshdeep Singh deserves his place.”Ashwin went on to underline that Arshdeep should be one of the first names on India’s team sheet in the shortest format.“My point is, Arshdeep Singh’s name should be the second name on your fast bowlers’ list when Bumrah is playing. And if Bumrah isn’t playing, then Arshdeep becomes your first-choice bowler on that team list. I just cannot understand how Arshdeep Singh keeps missing out from the XI in this side. I really don’t get it,” he added.The veteran spinner also acknowledged that Harshit Rana, who featured in the match, did “reasonably well,” but stressed that Arshdeep’s omission reflected a deeper issue of player rotation and opportunity.“It’s not about Harshit. The way Arshdeep performed in the 2024 T20 World Cup, and yet since then, he has consistently found ways to stay out of the team. He’s been benched so many times when he should have been playing,” Ashwin said.Arshdeep, India’s leading T20I wicket-taker with 101 wickets in 65 matches, last featured in the 2025 Asia Cup, where Ashwin felt he looked “rusty” due to limited match time.“He actually lost a bit of rhythm… he looked rusty. And your champion bowler will start looking rusty if you don’t give him game time,” Ashwin noted. “I genuinely hope he starts getting the chances he deserves, man. He deserves to be there. And it’s not about someone else, that’s his spot. Please, play him.”","Former India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has criticised the team management for leaving out Arshdeep Singh from the playing XI in India’s second T20I against Australia.

Manager John Schneider hails Springer’s resilience, says risk of aggravation won’t hold the veteran back

Bo Bichette’s recovery and lineup return add another emotional lift to Toronto’s World Series push

George Springer didn’t just return to the lineup — he returned with fire. After missing two straight games with a right-side strain, the veteran outfielder was back in the Toronto Blue Jays’ order for Game 6 of the World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers on Friday night. Leading off as the designated hitter, Springer grounded out to shortstop Mookie Betts in his first at-bat, but his presence alone shifted the tone in the dugout. For a Blue Jays team chasing its first championship since 1993, having its emotional leader back on the field mattered as much as his bat.Springer’s comeback comes less than 72 hours after leaving Game 3 in visible pain. His injury update, which initially worried fans, has now turned into one of the most talked-about storylines of the Series. “He’s tough,” manager John Schneider said before Game 6. “I think any hitter, when you kind of feel something there, you get a little worried. I think that kind of scares guys a little bit but I’m really happy that he’s back. ”Before the must-win Game 6, Schneider confirmed Springer had “made significant progress in the last 48 hours,” clearing him for the designated hitter role. The Blue Jays’ skipper added that while there’s always an element of risk in playing through pain, the veteran’s determination outweighed the caution.“There’s always some risk, too,” Schneider explained. “There’s a difference between being injured and hurting. He’s not injured right now. But yeah, there’s always a risk.”Springer reportedly tested his swing in the cage and on the field before Game 5, even preparing to pinch-run if needed. Schneider said the staff had considered using him in a limited capacity earlier but wanted to give him the extra rest. “He was pretty close two days ago,” Schneider said. “If we needed him, he was going to come into the game in some capacity. He’s a gamer, man. Ready to go.”Springer wasn’t the only one gutting it out for Toronto. Bo Bichette, who missed seven weeks with a sprained knee, also returned to the starting lineup at second base — giving the Blue Jays a crucial offensive and emotional boost. The duo’s return turned Game 6 into a defining moment for Toronto’s postseason story, where resilience seemed to outweigh rust.As the Toronto Blue Jays fought the Los Angeles Dodgers with a 3–2 Series lead, Springer’s presence symbolized something larger than a lineup change — it was a statement of intent. Even if his stat line doesn’t tell the full story, his grit, leadership, and ability to show up under pressure have once again proven why he remains one of baseball’s toughest postseason performersAlso read: Dave Roberts’ unexpected race with Hyeseong Kim at Dodgers’ camp spirals into a hilarious moment fans can’t stop talking about","George Springer returned to the Toronto Blue Jays' lineup for Game 6 of the World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers.

Erika Kirk, widow of MAGA activist Charlie Kirk , made an emotional return to the public stage on Wednesday as she joined vice president JD Vance at a Turning Point USA campus event at the University of Mississippi.It was Erika's first time speaking at the conservative event, since Charlie's assassination seven weeks earlier at Utah Valley University by a fatal sniper shot.Speaking to nearly 10,000 students, Erika talked about courage in the face of tragedy and shared that she had invited Vance to speak at the event.“When our team asked my dear friend, Vice President JD Vance, to speak today, I really prayed on it because, obviously, it’s a very emotional, emotional day,” she said. “But I could just hear Charlie in my heart. I could just hear him say, ‘Go reclaim that territory, babe.’ The battle’s already won. God’s love conquers. And that’s why I’m here today.”Kirk also spoke warmly of vice president Vance, who had helped carry Charlie Kirk’s coffin aboard Air Force Two from Utah to Arizona. “No one will ever replace my husband – but I do see some similarities in JD,” she said.Erika is now leading Turning Point USA, the group her husband founded.She described returning to campus as a “spiritual reclaiming of territory.”Thanking students for their support, Erika said, “You guys have no idea how helpful it is to have all you in my life … you make me feel even more connected to my husband. He didn’t leave us empty handed. He built a machine. And all of you are a part of that.”During the event, Vance also engaged in a lengthy question-and-answer session with students.The VP also responded to a controversial question about his wife Usha’s faith. He responded, “Yes, my wife did not grow up Christian. I think it’s fair to say that she grew up in a Hindu family, but not a particularly religious family in either direction.

Bill Belichick’s UNC stint and the chaos that followed



Halloween artist turns Belichick’s romance into viral art



Bill Belichick probably didn’t foresee his relationship with girlfriend Jordon Hudson turning into a public spectacle when he took charge of North Carolina. The six-time Super Bowl-winning coach joined UNC in December 2024, aiming to transform the Tar Heels into “The 33rd NFL team. ” Less than a year later, however, his ambitious vision has taken a strange and humorous turn — right into the heart of a Halloween display that has the internet laughing and talking.Belichick’s first year at Chapel Hill has been anything but smooth. As the 2025 college football season unfolded, headlines shifted from his coaching strategies to his personal life. His relationship with Hudson, a former cheerleader and yoga enthusiast, became a talking point that overshadowed UNC’s disappointing 2-5 start. With narrow defeats to California and Virginia following a crushing loss to Clemson, the Tar Heels’ season already feels off-track.Adding to the chaos, Belichick and Hudson’s much-memed beach yoga photo — dubbed #Billates by fans — resurfaced just in time for Halloween. The image showed Belichick lying flat on a beach while balancing Hudson in the air with his legs. For many, it was an amusingly uncharacteristic glimpse into the usually stoic coach’s life.But for one North Carolina local, it was inspiration.Freelance photographer Travis Dove decided to turn that now-famous image into a full-blown Halloween yard display. Known for his creative annual setups — from the Paris Olympics to Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift — Dove found this year’s muse in Belichick. “It’s been fun to watch this dumpster fire,” Dove told The Athletic, describing the UNC coach’s rocky tenure.“The minute I saw the yoga pose picture, I said, ‘We’re doing this.’ I don’t even care if people have forgotten about it. I’m going to remind them,” Dove explained. “Because it was so out of character and so bizarre to see him behaving that way.”Dove didn’t stop there. He recreated another viral moment — the awkward CBS interview where Hudson interrupted a pre-recorded segment about Belichick’s new book. The display included two skeletons seated for the “interview” and a third, symbolizing Hudson, hiding in the bushes.For fans, it’s dark humor. For Belichick, it’s another reminder that his personal life and professional chaos have become inseparable — and now, immortalized in Halloween lore.Also Read: Throwback: When Tom Brady got real about parenting struggles and said modern parents ‘screw up’ their kids","Bill Belichick’s relationship with girlfriend Jordon Hudson turned into a public spectacle when he took charge of North Carolina.

Tom Brady called out modern parenting for overprotecting kids



Tom Brady opened up about fatherhood challenges



Parenting may come with joy and pride, but it’s rarely a smooth ride — even for someone as disciplined as Tom Brady. The seven-time Super Bowl champion last year opened up about his parenting struggles, candidly admitting that he’s far from perfect when it comes to raising his three kids. During Fortune’s Global Forum in New York City, the retired NFL icon spoke with striking honesty about the pressures of modern parenting and how overprotectiveness may be doing more harm than good.Brady reflected on both his personal parenting journey and broader societal trends, expressing concern that today’s generation of parents shields their children too much from failure. “Think of today’s world, how we screw these kids up,” he told Fortune editor-in-chief Alyson Shontell. “Every time they mess up, we send them to an easier place to succeed.”The father of three — Jack, 18, Benjamin, 15, and Vivian, 12 — shared that he’s made his own mistakes as a parent. “Being a parent is probably the hardest job all of us have and we screw up a lot,” Brady said. “And I’ve screwed up a lot as a parent.” Despite his fame and success, Brady admitted he’s still figuring things out, noting that he’s no “expert in parenting,” but someone who’s constantly learning and trying to do better.He believes that resilience comes from facing adversity, not avoiding it. Recalling his early football days, Brady shared, “When I was that long shot as a kid who was a backup quarterback, they never said, ‘Man, don’t do that, it’ll be too hard, think about another backup plan.’ They said, go for it—that’s probably my parenting style.”The former quarterback also pointed out that many children today are rarely pushed beyond their comfort zones. “They’re told they’re great; people coddle them; they never have to push beyond their limits,” he said, emphasizing the need for kids to experience setbacks in order to grow stronger.While Brady’s success on the field is legendary, he revealed that parenting has been his toughest challenge. The football star said he empathizes deeply with his sons’ struggles. “To be a boy, it sucks to be Tom Brady’s son in so many ways and I try to empathize that with them,” he shared.Brady acknowledged that his children face immense expectations due to his legacy. Yet, he remains committed to guiding them through their own challenges just as his parents did for him. “My kids naturally are gonna be faced with their own challenges, and they gotta figure out how to overcome them, too. And I’ll be there to support them a lot like my parents did.”In an era where many parents rush to make life easier for their children, Tom Brady’s words serve as a powerful reminder: the real lessons — and strength — are often found in failure, not comfort.Also Read: ""It Hurts"": Eli Manning’s adorable Halloween heartbreak goes viral after his son’s surprising Jaxson Dart costume choice",Tom Brady spoke with striking honesty about the pressures of modern parenting.

Jaxson Dart wins over the Manning family and Giants fans



The rise of Giants quarterback Jaxson Dart



New York Giants legend Eli Manning recently found himself in an unexpected role reversal — this time, not as a quarterback, but as the dad of a young fan smitten with someone else wearing the Giants blue. During ESPN’s ManningCast on Monday, the two-time Super Bowl champion revealed that his 7-year-old son, Charlie, decided to dress up as the Giants’ new star quarterback, Jaxson Dart, for Halloween ""Charlie's dressing up as Jaxson Dart for Halloween,"" Eli, 44, told his brother Peyton during the broadcast. Peyton, ever the teasing older sibling, couldn’t resist asking, ""Does it hurt? Does it hurt that he's picking another Giants quarterback over you?"" Eli’s reply was both honest and endearing: ""It hurts a little bit.""Eli, who played his entire 16-year career with the Giants, went on to describe Charlie’s dedication to the rookie sensation’s look. ""(Charlie’s) got the chain, which is nice. The problem is he's wanting to wear it. We got it last week, and he wants to wear it to school every day,"" he said with a laugh. The ""chain"" refers to Dart’s signature heart-shaped necklace — a good luck charm that’s become a recognizable part of his on-field persona.On Halloween, Eli confirmed his son’s enthusiasm with a post on X: “Charlie said he wanted to dress up as his favorite @Giants quarterback ever for Halloween… guess he got his wish.” The accompanying photo showed Charlie beaming in Dart’s No. 6 jersey, complete with headband and the iconic chain.When reporters told Dart about the costume, the rookie couldn’t hide his excitement. ""I think it’s awesome. I’ve met Charlie a few times. Obviously, I’ve been around Eli a lot, and yeah, I think maybe, like, he said he’s a little disappointed it wasn’t him. But it’s just a cool relationship, and I think it’s awesome,"" Dart said Thursday.The 22-year-old quarterback has quickly captured the hearts of fans — and now, the Manning household too. Since taking over as starter in late September, Dart has reinvigorated the Giants offense. In October, he was named the NFL’s Offensive Rookie of the Month after recording 10 total touchdowns and posting the highest passer rating (90.0) among rookie quarterbacks.The last Giants player to earn that honor was Odell Beckham Jr. in 2014 — and that season ended with Beckham winning Offensive Rookie of the Year. Giants fans are beginning to wonder if history might repeat itself.As for Eli, he may have lost his son’s Halloween loyalty, but at least Charlie’s rooting for the right team — and one quarterback who’s already proving he deserves the Giants’ spotlight.Also Read: Travis Kelce’s ex Kayla Nicole sets Halloween on fire recreating Toni Braxton’s iconic 2000 look","Eli Manning's 7-year-old son, Charlie, decided to dress up as Jaxson Dart for Halloween.

Anthony Davis’ injury adds to Dallas Mavericks’ frontcourt struggles



Dallas Mavericks set for Mexico City matchup amid adversity



Dallas Mavericks forward Anthony Davis has been diagnosed with a low-grade left calf strain and is expected to sit out at least the next two games. The team confirmed the update on Friday, just ahead of their international matchup against the Detroit Pistons in Mexico City. Davis, who left Wednesday’s narrow 107–105 win over the Indiana Pacers in the first quarter after appearing to tweak his leg, will be re-evaluated after the Mavericks’ road trip.The timing couldn’t be worse for Dallas, already navigating early-season inconsistency and frontcourt injuries. Despite traveling with the team to Mexico and taking part in light practice, Davis’s absence will test the Mavericks’ depth against both the Pistons and the Houston Rockets. Head coach Jason Kidd told reporters, “A.D. is day to day,” adding that the team remains optimistic about his recovery.An MRI confirmed that Anthony Davis suffered a low-grade strain in his left calf. The Mavericks’ PR team shared in a statement, “The Dallas Mavericks announced today that Anthony Davis sustained a low-grade left calf strain against the Pacers and was held out of the remainder of the game for precautionary reasons.Davis will miss the team’s next two games and be re-evaluated after the road trip.”The 10-time All-Star’s latest setback continues a frustrating pattern of injuries that have defined much of his recent career. Since being traded from the Los Angeles Lakers last season in exchange for Luka Doncic, Davis has struggled to stay healthy, missing extended stretches of action.He managed to appear in only nine games after the trade and has already missed time due to minor ailments earlier this season. Through five games in 2025, he’s averaged 20.8 points and 10.2 rebounds.Adding to the Mavericks’ concerns, center Derek Lively II has been sidelined with a sprained knee, while Daniel Gafford continues to recover from an ankle injury suffered during training camp.The Mavericks’ upcoming game against the Pistons at Arena Ciudad de Mexico marks their fourth regular-season appearance in the city, more than any other NBA franchise. “It is something incredible for the Mavs organization to come so many times. It shows how important Mexico is, and it’s great to bring enjoyment to the fans,” Kidd said.As Davis continues his recovery, Dallas faces an uphill battle in a competitive Western Conference, where every game counts. “It is going to be day to day,” Davis said. “But I feel better, that is for sure.”Now, Mavericks fans can only hope that the star forward’s absence won’t stretch beyond the two-game mark.Also Read: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander’s Oklahoma home targeted in shocking break-in while NBA MVP was playing against Washington Wizards","Dallas Mavericks forward Anthony Davis has been diagnosed with a low-grade left calf strain.
