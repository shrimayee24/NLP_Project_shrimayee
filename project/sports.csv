with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.

Why did Valluvar place this couplet ninth in the sequence?

Aadhi Bhagavan – the primordial one

Vaalarivan – The one of flawless wisdom

Malarmisai Eginan – The one whose feet rest upon the flower

Vendudal Vendaamai Ilaan – The one beyond desire and aversion

Iraivan – the sovereign being

Pori Vaayil Aindhu Aviththaan – The one who mastered the five senses

Thanakku Uvamai Illadhaan – None can be compared to Him

Ara Azhi Andhanan – Ocean of virtue and justice

""Kolil pori-yir gunam ilave enn gunaththaan

Thaalai vanangaa thalai.""

Palsied and pointless is the head

That bows not to the One of Eight-Fold Grace.

In the opening chapter of the introductory section of the, Valluvar performs a rare literary feat—dedicating ten couplets solely to exalting the Divine, never revealing—even faintly—his own religious affiliation.The God he praises is cloaked in universality. His words, though deeply reverent, are so free of sectarian markers that the divine he invokes could be an embodiment of virtues. Over the centuries, commentators have drawn from the wells of Saiva Siddhantha, Vaishnavism, Jainism, Buddhism, the Bhagavad Gita, the Bible, and even Zoroastrianism to interpret these verses.Yet, the ambiguity has ignited a literary debate among Tamil scholars: Who was Valluvar? What was his faith ?Thiru V Kalyanasundaranar and Vayapuri Pillai, both erudite scholars, suggest that the spiritual overtones of the first chapter hint at Jain influences. On the other hand, Thiru Vajravel Mudhaliyar sees the soul ofsteeped in Saiva Siddhanta. Christian missionary-scholar G U Pope declared that theechoed the Sermon on the Mount. Opinions differ, but there is near-universal agreement on one point: Valluvar wrote for the universal human—unbound by religious identity , yet deeply spiritual.The most debated verse in this opening chapter is the ninth couplet, where God is described as ‘the One who possesses the Eight-Fold Excellence’.Curiously, Valluvar does not elaborate on what these eight attributes are. Perhaps, in his time, they needed no clarification. Or he left it open, inviting seekers to look within and interpret for themselves.Saiva Siddhanta describes the eight traits as supreme grace, omnipotence, incomparability, pure intelligence, omniscience, detachment, infinite bliss, and absolute purity.Jainism, meanwhile, speaks of the eight divine signs that adorn a, the enlightened guide—divine seat, halo, celestial fan, triple umbrella, Ashoka tree, floral rain, heavenly music, and divine proclamation. Jain philosophy also speaks of eight karmic bonds from which the soul must liberate itself—karmas that obscure knowledge, perception, obstruct effort, create delusion, determine body, status, emotion, and lifespan.Some scholars who consider Valluvar as a Siddhar, attribute the couplet to the eight supernatural faculties associated with enlightenment.Amidst this swirl of interpretations, a quiet yet profound insight was once offered by a teacher of mine. She asked:I had no answer.She smiled and said, “Look at the first eight couplets. Each one praises the Divine with a unique attribute. The ninth simply gathers them all—referring to God as the One who embodies these eight virtues already described.”A moment of revelation. Simple, yet powerful.Indeed, the preceding eight couplets refer to God in eight exalted ways:Then comes the ninth, the verse that sparked centuries of debate:What a line—soft in its cadence, sharp in its implication.In leaving the Divine unnamed and unclaimed, Valluvar did more than avoid controversy. He handed us a mirror polished with humility and universality. Name and form of the God matters, he seems to say, but the virtues we see in the Divine—and seek in ourselves, matter even more.","The Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.

Shedeur Sanders picked off on Day 1, but Browns still see upside in rookie QB



The NFL dream has finally begun for Shedeur Sanders, as the former Colorado standout took the field in Berea, Ohio, for his first rookie minicamp with the Cleveland Browns . While the spotlight was bright and the expectations even brighter, Sanders' NFL debut was a mixture of rough starts and promising flashes.The very first pass Shedeur Sanders threw during team drills didn’t go according to plan.Under pressure from a free rusher, he attempted a play-action pass in the red zone, lofting the ball toward the left sideline—only to have it intercepted by a defender. A forgettable first impression? Perhaps. But for a quarterback known for his 74 percent completion rate in his final college season, this was less about mechanics and more about adjusting to the unforgiving speed of the NFL.Yet, Sanders didn’t let that early mistake define his day.Despite the shaky beginning, Sanders settled in and delivered a performance that revealed why the Browns were willing to bet on him, even after his surprising draft slide to the fifth round at No. 144 overall. Participating in various drills and 7-on-7 sessions, Sanders demonstrated his passing range—from sharp short throws to tight-window touchdowns.Browns insider Brad Stainbrook captured and shared glimpses of Sanders in action, highlighting two touchdown passes during scrimmage plays and several well-placed throws over defenders. Stainbrook later noted that Sanders “looked sharper than Dillon Gabriel,” the other quarterback in the rookie camp, who was selected by the Browns 94th overall.The quarterback competition is already becoming one of the more intriguing storylines of Cleveland’s offseason. Sanders and Gabriel, both entering the league with impressive college résumés, will have every opportunity to climb the depth chart. And while Gabriel got the first reps, Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski made it clear that nothing is set in stone. “I wouldn't look into anything,” Stefanski remarked. “I think you'll see the whole weekend, going through the spring. I mean, we don't pay too close attention to who is in there first.” When asked if the order would change, he simply replied, “I’ll see who.”For Sanders, Friday marked more than just his first practice—it was a statement of intent. Dressed in shorts, a jersey, and helmet—far from full NFL gear—he still managed to showcase glimpses of poise and precision that hint at his potential to grow under center.“This is only the beginning,” Stainbrook wrote. And for Shedeur Sanders, whose college career spanned from Jackson State to the bright lights of Colorado, this beginning may come with challenges—but also a chance to shape his legacy in Cleveland, one pass at a time.Also Read: Despite buzz, Aaron Rodgers not locked in with Steelers; retirement rumors keep gaining steam",Shedeur Sanders made his Cleveland Browns rookie minicamp debut on Friday.

Kuminga’s playoff role expands amid Warriors’ injury woes

Game 2 of the Warriors-Timberwolves series took a dramatic turn as Golden State faced a 17-point deficit at halftime. Withsidelined due to a hamstring strain, head coach Steve Kerr made a bold adjustment, insertinginto the starting lineup for the second half. The Warriors ’ offense sputtered without Curry, who played just 13 minutes in Game 1 before exiting with the injury.Steve Kerr scrambled for solutions, using 14 different players in the first half—a playoff record since at least 1998, according to NBA on ESPN. The lineup shuffling failed to generate momentum, as Minnesota capitalized on Golden State’s disjointed play.Jonathan Kuminga, who had been largely out of the rotation since returning from injury late in the season, provided a rare bright spot late in the second quarter with an eight-point surge. His energy prompted Kerr to make a decisive move.At the start of the third quarter, Jonathan Kuminga replaced Quentin Post in the lineup, signaling Kerr’s urgency to spark a comeback. Anthony Slater of The Athletic noted the shift on social media, highlighting Kuminga’s late-first-half production as the catalyst for the change.The Timberwolves, led by Jimmy Butler, continued to exploit Golden State’s defensive gaps, but Kuminga’s athleticism offered a potential counter. His ability to attack the rim and defend multiple positions gave the Warriors a dimension they sorely lacked in Curry’s absence.Steve Kerr’s handling of Kuminga has been a storyline since the forward’s return from injury. Limited minutes late in the season raised questions about his playoff role, but Curry’s injury forced Kerr’s hand. With the series shifting to Golden State for Game 3, Kuminga’s second-half performance could determine whether he remains a fixture in the rotation.The Warriors stole home-court advantage by winning Game 1, but Stephen Curry’s status looms large. If he misses extended time, Kuminga’s emergence becomes even more critical. For now, Kerr’s gamble reflects both desperation and faith in the young forward’s potential to change the series’ trajectory.Also read: Stephen Curry’s son, Canon Curry, snubs him after Warriors’ playoff loss—and the internet can’t get enough The Warriors face an uphill battle without Curry, but Kuminga’s second-half insertion could be a turning point.

Meanwhile, Kerr’s lineup experiments highlight the team’s urgency—desperation meets adaptability. With the series shifting back to San Francisco, all eyes will be on whether Kuminga can solidify his role or if Minnesota’s dominance continues. One thing’s certain: the Warriors’ playoff survival now hinges on unexpected heroes stepping up.","Golden State Warriors trail by 17 at halftime after experimental rotations.

LeBron James details first knee injury of his life, which made him miss the Met Gala

The Los Angeles Lakers ' season wrapped up with a disappointment. And the small losses aside, the biggest regret for the team's loyalists is the fact that another season just went by where LeBron James' prime has gone to waste as he had to move aside after sustaining a knee injury. LeBron suffered a Grade 2 MCL sprain in his left knee from his collision with DiVincenzo in Game 5, and during a recent appearance on a podcast, he revealed he hinted at his retirement.In fact, as per some rumours, James may become a free agent this summer, but retirement is also a possibility. The star has spoken extensively about this decision in recent offseasons, and it appears that the end of his career is approaching.This season, James averaged 24.4 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 8.2 assists, and many experts believe that the next season might even be his final. It's no secret that James' 2025 season was cut short due to a knee injury, which even made him skip the Met Gala. On the latest episode of the 'Mind the Game' podcast with Steve Nash, LeBron revealed something surprising.King James, as he's fondly known as admitted that this is the first knee injury of his life! ""In my 22-year career, this is my first knee injury. I've had regular tendonitis, patella, all that stuff, but this is the first time I have had a sustained knee injury where you gotta get off your feet. You gotta be shelved for a minute,"" he said.He further explained, ""I knew when the impact happened between me and DiVincenzo, my knee locked up. That's why I stayed on the ground. If the knee would release a little bit, but I knew right then and there with the pain that I had never felt before... My knee bent inward, and that's the MCL injury I picked up. The doc told me that it would take four to six weeks. I have four to six weeks now.""""Even if we won Game 5, I would have missed 6 and 7, and even further. I have some time now to get it right and get back to full strength,"" he added.LeBron disclosed that he was prepared to wait until Friday for an MRI after sustaining the injury on Wednesday, but the pain he experienced upon waking on Thursday made him move up the imaging appointment. LeBron also mentioned retirement during the podcast and shared that he would make this decision with his family after the Lakers' final game of the season.""I haven't had the conversation with the family yet as far as me going forward or whatever the case may be,"" the 40-year-old said during Thursday's episode of Mind the Game with Steve Nash (35:25 mark). ""But we'll see what happens.""",LeBron James suffered a Grade 2 MCL sprain in his left knee from his collision with DiVincenzo in Game 5.

Hill, once the heartbeat of Miami’s offense, is now at the center of trade rumors and the Pittsburgh Steelers are quickly emerging as a serious landing spot.With George Pickens out of Pittsburgh and Hill leaving Tua Tagovailoa off his top quarterbacks list, the signs are starting to raise eyebrows across the league.The Dolphins recently inked seven of their 2024 draft picks and welcomed 16 undrafted free agents to the roster. Among the notable additions are defensive standouts Kenneth Grant and Zeek Biggers, offensive firepower in running back Ollie Gordon II, and quarterback Quinn Ewers, a name to watch. The only rookie holdout? Second-round pick Jonah Savaiinaea.But while the Dolphins front office celebrates its youth movement, the fan base is growing restless. That’s because Tyreek Hill, the franchise’s marquee weapon, appears to be distancing himself quietly but strategically. His recent omission of Tua Tagovailoa from a personal list of top NFL quarterbacks didn’t go unnoticed. For a player who once hailed Tua as elite, the snub was deafening.Hill's offseason hasn’t exactly screamed stability either. Now 31, he’s coming off a lukewarm season by his standards with under 1,000 receiving yards and just six touchdowns. And while some chalk it up to Tua’s mid-season injury woes, others believe the chemistry is fading fast. Adding to the uncertainty, Hill recently underwent his second wrist surgery fueling more whispers about a potential reboot elsewhere.Enter the Pittsburgh Steelers, who just made room by offloading George Pickens. With DK Metcalf needing a complementary weapon, Hill's game-breaking speed could be the missing piece. If Pittsburgh can pull the trigger, it could reshape the AFC hierarchy in an instant.There’s even chatter that the Steelers are eyeing Aaron Rodgers as a quarterback option though a Hill-Rodgers combo would require cap gymnastics and pure ambition. Still, this isn’t the first time Pittsburgh has courted controversy for the sake of championship relevance.Also Read: Fox News Commentator Camryn Kinsey collapses live on air- What really happened behind was shocking For now, Miami fans must reckon with a troubling possibility, while the front office builds for tomorrow, their most dangerous playmaker might already be looking for the exit.",Tyreek Hill's future in Miami uncertain as trade rumors link him to the Steelers.

Cleveland Cavaliers Without Mobley: The Challenge Ahead

Theface a crucial moment in their Eastern Conference semifinal series against the Indiana Pacers , with their playoff hopes hanging in the balance as star forwardbattles an ankle injury. As the series shifts to Indianapolis for Game 3, Mobley’s status remains officially questionable, casting uncertainty over the Cavs’ game plan and their prospects for a comeback.Evan Mobley, who suffered a left ankle sprain during the fourth quarter of Game 1, missed Game 2 alongside Darius Garland (toe) and De’Andre Hunter (thumb).All three participated in a team walk-through on Thursday, “touched the ball,” and are listed as questionable for Game 3, according to head coach Kenny Atkinson. While there is optimism within the organization, sources report Mobley was moving cautiously during practice, suggesting he is still managing the effects of his injury. A final decision on his availability will likely be made closer to tip-off.Evan Mobley has been a cornerstone for the Cleveland Cavaliers , earning the franchise’s first-ever Defensive Player of the Year award this season. His two-way presence is vital, anchoring the defense and providing efficient scoring. In Game 1 against the Pacers, Mobley delivered an impressive stat line:- 20 points- 10 rebounds- 2 assists- 2 steals- 9-of-13 shooting (69.2% FG)His ability to protect the rim, switch onto perimeter players, and contribute offensively makes him irreplaceable in Cleveland’s system. Over the postseason, Mobley has accumulated 170 points and 72 rebounds, underscoring his consistency and importance.If Evan Mobley is unable to play in Game 3, the Cleveland Cavaliers face a daunting task. In Game 2, with Mobley, Garland, and Hunter sidelined, Cleveland struggled defensively and on the glass, losing 121-112 as Indiana capitalized on second-chance opportunities and interior scoring. Reserve forward Dean Wade and guard Ty Jerome were pressed into larger roles, but neither can replicate Mobley’s defensive impact or offensive versatility.Without Mobley, the Cavaliers must rely more heavily on Donovan Mitchell, who scored 48 points in Game 2, and hope for increased contributions from Jarrett Allen and the supporting cast. Defensively, Cleveland will need to tighten rotations and gang-rebound to compensate for Mobley’s absence.Also read: Will Darius Garland play tonight against the Indiana Pacers?

If he is unable to suit up, Cleveland’s margin for error shrinks considerably, and their ability to contain Indiana’s offense will be severely tested.

Abdul Carter settles on this jersey number for Giants after denied request for Lawrence Taylor’s Jersey No. 56,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/abdul-carter-settles-on-this-jersey-number-for-giants-after-denied-request-for-lawrence-taylors-jersey-no-56/articleshow/121036225.cms,"Abdul Carter picks No. 51 for the Giants after jersey number requests denied (Image via: Getty Images)

Giants fans divided over Abdul Carter’s jersey number choice



Can Abdul Carter make Giants Jersey No. 51 his own?



Before even stepping on the field, Abdul Carter is already turning heads in New York. The Giants’ first-round pick recently made headlines by asking to wear Lawrence Taylor’s iconic No. 56, a request that was quickly denied. Now, after striking out with two retired jersey numbers, Carter has picked a new one that still gives a subtle nod to the Giants legends who came before him.Fresh off a standout career at Penn State, Carter called Taylor “the greatest football player of all time.” So when he publicly floated the idea of wearing Taylor’s retired No. 56, it didn’t go over well. Giants fans pushed back—and Taylor himself made his stance clear.“I know he would love to wear that number, but hey, I think it’s retired,” Taylor told the New York Post. “Get another number and make it famous.”After that firm rejection, Carter pivoted to another Giants great, Phil Simms. The rookie had worn No. 11 in college, and Simms initially said he’d be open to unretiring his jersey number for Carter. But soon after, Simms admitted his family overruled him. That door was shut, too.With both No. 56 and No. 11 off the table, Carter made a calculated move, he chose to wear jersey number 51—a subtle nod to both legends, taking digits from each of their iconic numbers.The No. 51 jersey number was last worn by pass rusher Azeez Ojulari, who departed for Philadelphia in the offseason. Now, it belongs to a rookie linebacker ready to leave his mark.NFL jersey numbers are more than digits, they represent history, pride, and pressure. By eyeing two retired numbers right out of the gate, Carter showed fearlessness. Some fans see it as confidence; others call it disrespect. Either way, the decision to wear No. 51 has already added another layer to Carter’s growing spotlight.Also Read: Shocking: Jordon Hudson, Bill Belichick's girlfriend, banned from UNC facility after explosive controversy Now it’s up to him to prove that he belongs.

Golden State Warriors ’ Jimmy Butler spoke to reporters after Game 2 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves . In the postgame presser, he was asked if he felt burdened by the nickname ‘ Playoff Jimmy ’ given to him. He projected his confident and chilled-out side and shared how he devises his game plan, keeping all the expectations aside.Jimmy Butler attended the postgame presser after losing Game 2 of Round 2 to the Minnesota Timberwolves.He shared that he was not bogged down ever by the nickname ‘Playoff Jimmy’ given to him and believed that he could provide his teammates comfort when needed by playing basketball the right way. The Golden State Warriors faced various challenges with Stephen Curry missing the action due to a hamstring injury. Commenting on the expectations that his nickname ‘Playoff Jimmy’ draws, he said:“I don't have a burden or expectation.I don't. I play basketball the right way. I will continue to play basketball the right way. If that time comes where your people that are saying whatever, [I'm] supposed to score 40 or 43, whatever the case may be, I'm capable of it.”He continued, saying, ""I can do it, but I love making sure that my guys are comfortable, passing the ball to them, taking the right shots at the right time. But we'll talk about it, if that may be needed. Who knows.""Jimmy Butler had huge shoes of Stephen Curry to fill in, and his reputation as a master of the playoffs made him the center of attention. However, all the attention did not waver his focus, and he showed the same by pitching in honest efforts in Game 2.Jimmy Butler’s performance lacked the edge for which he is nicknamed ‘Playoff Jimmy’ in Game 2 against the Minnesota Timberwolves. He gave the Warriors first points on a three, but after that he failed to create magic.Unlike his stature and previous performances in postseason, he seemed a bit unsure about making his shots against the Timberwolves and lost a few important opportunities to add to the team’s score. Butler’s overall performance featured 17 points, 7 rebounds and 4 assists, which didn’t have anything extraordinary about it.Perhaps, Butler is yet to recover mentally from the pelvic injury and that showed in his defensive approach that highlighted most part of his game.

Mikko Rantanen’s unstoppable 2025 playoffs: The EDGE stats driving his historic run,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/mikko-rantanens-unstoppable-2025-playoffs-the-edge-stats-driving-his-historic-run/articleshow/121040060.cms,"Photo by Jonathan Kozub/Getty Images

EDGE stats prove Mikko Rantanen is a complete player in the 2025 playoffs

Mikko Rantanen has been on fire in the 2025 Stanley Cup Playoffs . After being traded twice this season—first from Colorado to Carolina, and then from Carolina to Dallas—he’s found a home in Texas and, in the process, has turned into the postseason’s most dangerous player. From back-to-back hat tricks to a series of standout performances, Rantanen is not only leading the Stars’ charge but also putting up numbers that make it hard to argue he isn’t the Conn Smythe frontrunner .And while everyone’s talking about his goals, there’s a hidden story in the data that shows just how well-rounded his playoff performance truly is.It’s no surprise Mikko Rantanen has been scoring at will—he’s a natural goal-scorer. But looking deep into the numbers, his success isn’t just about putting the puck in the net; it’s about where and how he’s getting his shots. Take his shot locations, for example. He’s been everywhere, from the front of the net to midrange areas, and it’s been paying off. Excluding his incredible wraparound goal against Colorado, he’s been in the 93rd percentile for high-danger shots on goal, which means he’s consistently putting himself in positions where scoring is most likely. Even more impressive is the fact that he’s scored three high-danger goals so far—putting him in the 95th percentile. But Rantanen hasn’t just been getting close to the net; his midrange game has been nearly as deadly. With four mid range goals, tied with Nathan MacKinnon for the league lead, he’s found a way to beat goalies from nearly every angle.It’s not just about shot selection, though. The other piece of the puzzle is his work ethic and skating. Rantanen has been putting in serious mileage this postseason, skating a total of 23.88 miles, which places him in the 92nd percentile among forwards. And this isn’t just cruising around—the guy is involved in every shift. His 20.53 miles at even strength ranks him in the 95th percentile, and he’s also been effective on the power play, with 3.35 miles skated during man-advantage situations (88th percentile). That work ethic is paying off with goals, too. He leads the NHL in even-strength goals with six, and he’s added two power-play goals to round out his impact.But there’s another layer to Rantanen’s dominance: his shot quality. His Projected Goal Rate (PGR)—a stat that measures how likely his shots are to result in a goal based on the quality of the attempt—sits at 8.30 percent this postseason. That’s third in the NHL, behind only Leon Draisaitl and Zach Hyman. For context, anything above 12 percent is considered a high-probability shot, so Rantanen’s number speaks to the fact that not only is he taking a lot of shots, but he’s taking a lot of good ones.Mikko Rantanen’s postseason performance isn’t just about scoring a bunch of goals and grabbing headlines—though he’s certainly doing that, too. When you look at the numbers, it’s clear his playoff run has been built on much more than just good luck. His ability to get to the right places on the ice, combined with his relentless skating and high-quality shot attempts, makes him the total package. It’s no wonder he’s considered the favorite for the Conn Smythe. If he keeps this up, there might be no stopping him—or the Dallas Stars.Also Read: Breaking down the 2025 NHL MVP finalists: Hart and Ted Lindsay award predictions","Mikko Rantanen has been on fire in the 2025 Stanley Cup Playoffs.

Theface a must-win scenario as they head into Game 3 against the Indiana Pacers , trailing 0-2 in the series. Amid a wave of injuries to key players, the spotlight is on star guard, who has been playing through a calf strain but remains the Cavaliers’ primary hope for a turnaround.Mitchell has been dealing with a mild calf strain, which, while not severe enough to keep him out of the lineup, has raised some concerns among fans and analysts.Despite visible discomfort and moments of limping at the end of both games against the Pacers, Mitchell has not been listed on the official injury report. Head coach Kenny Atkinson provided reassurance, stating he does not expect Mitchell to carry any injury designation heading into Game 3. Donovan Mitchell’s impact has been nothing short of heroic. In Game 2, he exploded for 48 points, carrying the Cleveland Cavaliers offensively and nearly willing them to a win despite the absence of other key contributors. His performance included highlight-reel plays and relentless scoring, but Cleveland ultimately fell short, squandering a 20-point lead and losing in the final moments. In Game 1, Mitchell also led the team in scoring, although the exact point total was not specified in the available reports. His leadership and scoring have been the Cleveland Cavaliers’ lifeline, especially with Darius Garland and Evan Mobley sidelined.Mitchell is not only Cleveland’s leading scorer but also the emotional and strategic anchor of the team. His ability to create shots, attack the rim, and draw defensive attention opens opportunities for teammates. In the playoffs, his scoring average has soared, and his usage rate has spiked as the Cleveland Cavaliers have leaned heavily on his offensive production. Without Mitchell, Cleveland’s offense would struggle to generate quality looks, and their ability to keep pace with Indiana’s high-powered attack would be severely diminished.If Mitchell’s calf strain were to worsen or force him out of the lineup, the Cleveland Cavaliers’ prospects would become dire. The team would have to rely on secondary scorers like Caris LeVert, while hoping for unexpected contributions from the bench. The absence of Mitchell’s shot creation and leadership would put immense pressure on Cleveland’s already depleted roster, making a comeback in the series highly unlikely.Also read: Will Darius Garland play tonight against the Indiana Pacers?

What the Cleveland Cavaliers Can Do If Garland Remains Out

Theare facing a critical juncture in their playoff series against the Indiana Pacers, and the status ofhas become a central storyline. After missing four consecutive playoff games with a painful toe sprain, Garland’s potential return for Game 3 could be decisive as the Cavaliers attempt to climb out of a 2-0 series deficit.has been sidelined since aggravating his toe injury during Game 2 of the first-round series against the Indiana Pacers. While he has been progressing in his recovery, he has yet to participate in full-contact practice. Head coach Kenny Atkinson recently reported that Garland, along with Evan Mobley and De’Andre Hunter, took part in Thursday’s walk-through, but there was no live action. All three remain listed as questionable for Game 3, with their availability to be determined just before tipoff. There is optimism within the organization that Garland could make his return, providing a much-needed boost to the struggling Cavaliers.Before his injury, Garland was a key force for Cleveland. In the 2024-25 regular season, he averaged 20.6 points, 6.7 assists, and 2.9 rebounds per game, ranking 12th in the league in assists and shooting an efficient 47.2% from the field. In his last two games before the injury, he posted back-to-back 25-point outings, including a 25-point, 5-assist performance in a win over Detroit and another 25 points in a loss to Boston. In the first two games of the Miami series, Garland averaged 24.0 points on 51.6% shooting and 41.2% from three, along with 7.0 assists-a testament to his offensive orchestration and scoring prowess.Garland’s absence has been deeply felt. The Cleveland Cavaliers’ offense has struggled to keep pace with Indiana’s high-octane attack, particularly in Game 1, where Cleveland lost 121-112 and failed to match the Pacers’ tempo and shot creation. Backup guard Ty Jerome has filled in admirably but lacks Garland’s speed and playmaking, which has slowed Cleveland’s transition game and limited their offensive versatility.If Garland is unable to play in Game 3, the Cleveland Cavaliers will need to continue relying on Donovan Mitchell , who erupted for 48 points in Game 2, as the primary offensive engine. The team will also look for increased playmaking from secondary ball handlers like Caris LeVert and Ty Jerome, while hoping for contributions from their frontcourt to compensate for Garland’s absence. However, without their star point guard, Cleveland’s margin for error shrinks considerably, especially against a Pacers squad that thrives in transition and boasts one of the league’s most dynamic backcourts.Also read: Cleveland Cavaliers Injury Update (May 9, 2025): Is Evan Mobley Playing in Game 3 vs the Indiana Pacers?

On Friday, players from Delhi Capitals and Punjab Kings arrived in Delhi, travelling from Dharamsala where their recent fixture was halted midway due to security concerns.The situation has caused widespread anxiety among overseas players across franchises, prompting the BCCI and respective teams to expedite travel arrangements.While Indian players are expected to return to their hometowns, foreign players and staff are preparing to fly out of the country until further notice.“They will be heading back home. We will help with all the logistics but every foreign player and member of the support staff will be headed back to their respective country,” an IPL official confirmed.Another franchise official added, “All players will be headed back home, including the overseas players.”The Dharamsala game’s abrupt suspension led to significant panic, particularly among international players. In the aftermath, Delhi Capitals and Punjab Kings made swift arrangements to transport their squads to the capital city.Elsewhere, Mumbai Indians remain in Ahmedabad, while Gujarat Titans are currently in Delhi, where they were scheduled to play next. Lucknow Super Giants and Royal Challengers Bengaluru were both in Lucknow for a fixture that now stands postponed. Mumbai players are expected to return to their base with their kits and equipment already at the team hotel, while RCB players may disperse directly from Lucknow.","IPL 2025 suspended for a week following escalating tensions along the western border.

Draymond Green’s outburst: Heat of the moment or a sign of a deeper problem?

Unc, Ocho & Caron Butler react to Timberwolves vs Warriors G2 & is LeBron retiring?!? | Nightcap

It was another night of drama for Draymond Green , who found himself in familiar territory on Thursday, May 8, when he picked up a technical foul for elbowing Minnesota Timberwolves forward Naz Reid. The incident, which unfolded at the Target Center, pushed the Golden State Warriors veteran just two technicals away from a suspension, a scenario the team can’t afford, especially with Steph Curry sidelined due to a hamstring strain.But it wasn’t just the foul that drew headlines. It was Green’s postgame comments, and the racial undertones they carried, that sparked deeper conversation. Draymond Green has long walked the fine line between being an emotional leader and a controversial enforcer. Known more for his fire than finesse, that passion once again boiled over in the Warriors’ loss. After elbowing Reid in the face, Green addressed the media and expressed frustration about being labeled an “angry Black man,” arguing that the narrative is steeped in racial stereotype.“I’m successful, I have a great family, and I’m great at what I do,” Green said, pushing back at the idea that his intensity should be interpreted as hostility.Later that night on their show ‘Nightcap’, former NFL stars Shannon Sharpe and Chad Johnson tackled the issue with nuance and candor. Johnson, a longtime friend of Green, defended his demeanor while making a clear distinction. “I love Draymond, good friend of mine. He’s not an angry Black man. He can be passionate … he kinda hurts some people sometimes, elbows, knees, and kicks or whatnot, but he’s an enforcer. There’s a difference between being angry and being passionate about something.”Sharpe echoed that sentiment, admitting that Green sometimes crosses the line, but rejecting the ""angry"" label. “I don’t look at him as [an angry Black man]. Do I think his play goes over the line sometimes? Yes. But I don’t think he’s angry,” Sharpe said.Adding fuel to the tension, reports surfaced that a fan was ejected from the arena for shouting racial slurs at Green. That incident may help explain the emotion behind his postgame remarks, comments that, while charged with frustration, remained deliberate, articulate, and pointed.Sharpe highlighted the double standards that persist in sports media. “We’re angry, they’re passionate,” he said, underscoring how similar behaviors are often characterized differently based on race. It’s a long-standing issue, one where Black athletes are too often reduced to their physicality, while their leadership, intellect, and emotional range go overlooked.Also Read: “I'm not an angry black man” – Draymond Green shuts down harmful stereotypes after receiving technical foul Draymond Green’s style has always sparked strong opinions. He’s the kind of player you want in your foxhole, not across the court. His behavior should be held accountable when it crosses the line, but attributing it to race distorts the conversation. As Sharpe and Johnson made clear on Thursday night, there’s an important difference between being passionate and being angry. In 2025, it’s time to recognize that difference and retire the harmful stereotypes that cloud it.","Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green received a technical foul for elbowing Minnesota Timberwolves forward Naz Reid.

San Jose Sharks secure Mattias Hävelid with three-year contract to bolster their defensive lineup,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/san-jose-sharks-secure-mattias-hvelid-with-three-year-contract-to-bolster-their-defensive-lineup/articleshow/121040040.cms,"Mattias Hävelid signs a three-year deal with the San Jose Sharks (Image via: X)

A rising NHL defenseman with potential for the San Jose Sharks?



International success raises expectations but NHL transition remains uncertain for Hävelid



The San Jose Sharks are stirring up the NHL waters once again, making headlines with the announcement of their newest signing: defenseman Mattias Hävelid . At just 21 years old, Hävelid has been carving out a name for himself in Sweden, and now, he's making the leap to the NHL after penning a three-year, entry-level contract with the Sharks. But is this a masterstroke of scouting or another risky gamble by a franchise in need of serious revamping?Mattias Hävelid’s résumé is undeniably impressive for someone of his age.In his recent season with Linköping HC and Djurgårdens IF, Hävelid racked up solid numbers, finishing as one of the top contributors on the blue line. He logged 14 points, including two goals and 12 assists, for Djurgårdens, and helped lead them to a HockeyAllsvenskan Championship with an impactful postseason performance. His success at both ends of the rink in Sweden raises one burning question: Is he ready to translate this success into the NHL?Hävelid’s experience in the Swedish Hockey League (SHL) shows promise, with 43 games under his belt and a tally of 12 points. The defenseman’s offensive upside, combined with his ability to play both power play and penalty kill roles, makes him a versatile asset. But here’s the kicker: the SHL is not the NHL. The level of competition, the speed, and the physicality differ drastically. Hävelid’s size, standing at 5’10” and weighing 176 pounds, could also be a factor in whether he can withstand the grind of North American hockey, where larger, more aggressive players dominate.The Sharks have been rebuilding for some time now, and Hävelid's signing looks like part of that long-term plan. But this isn’t the first time San Jose has taken a shot on an international prospect who hasn't quite proven themselves on the big stage. Are the Sharks making the right bet, or is this just another misstep in their roster construction?Hävelid’s international experience with Sweden's U-18 and U-20 teams certainly suggests a bright future. He was instrumental in Sweden’s gold medal-winning campaign at the 2022 U-18 World Juniors, leading all defensemen in goals, assists, and points. His silver medal at the 2024 World Juniors, where he finished among the top contributors in assists and points, further elevates his profile.However, translating that international success into the NHL is no guarantee. The transition from junior hockey to the pros is a monumental one, and Hävelid's development will be heavily scrutinized over the next few seasons.Also Read: Oilers lean on depth and drama to snatch Game 2 from Vegas With the Sharks in need of a solid defenseman to build their future around, Hävelid may be their guy, if he can adjust to the league’s demands quickly. But with their franchise in flux, fans may be left wondering: Will this gamble pay off, or will the Sharks be left wishing for a better defensive prospect? Time will tell, but the pressure is on.","Mattias Hävelid, 21, signs a three-year deal with the San Jose Sharks. The defenseman has been carving out a name for himself in the Swedish Hockey League.

Max Verstappen spotted testing Ferrari

Yuki Tsunoda praised by Red Bull’s Chief Engineer Paul Monaghan

“He seems to be settling in really well, actually. It’s not the easiest circumstances to step into. He came in, he’s been forthright in his feedback, he’s been courteous, he’s been a good team member. He’s been a little bit unlucky at times, lucky at others… He’s finding his feet.”

“He’s not afraid to speak his mind, he states what he wants and what he doesn’t like, which is good. He’s in the team, he’s a good member of it, and he’ll be fine. He seems able to avoid the intimidation of being Max’s team mate at the moment, so that’s really good. I’m impressed. He’s got more than a spine to him.”

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

LeBrom James addressed the Los Angeles Lakers’ playoff elimination against the Minnesota Timberwolves



Wolves vs. Lakers and The Evolution of Anthony Edwards | LeBron James & Steve Nash | MIND THE GAME

The Los Angeles Lakers ’ playoff journey ended sooner than fans had hoped, crashing out in the first round despite boasting one of the NBA’s most star-powered lineups. Their elimination came at the hands of the Minnesota Timberwolves , led by the electrifying Anthony Edwards , whose dominant performances turned the tide of the series. And while some were quick to point fingers at LeBron James , the 40-year-old icon didn’t hesitate to set the record straight.Speaking on the Mind The Game podcast, LeBron James addressed the criticism with a strong message about team basketball.“Teams win championships. It’s never just about me and Luka… there’s 8 other guys on the floor,” James said, reminding fans that basketball is a collective effort, not a solo show. His point rings louder given that both he and Luka Doncic were stellar offensively, but neither could push their teams beyond the first round.The Lakers’ struggles this season weren’t due to a lack of star power. Instead, their decline came on the defensive end. The once-fearsome defense faltered as the season wore on, and those cracks were fully exposed by Minnesota. LeBron shared insights into their failed strategy against Edwards, noting how difficult it was to limit him. “We wanted to try to change pitches on him as much as possible because you don’t ever give no great players one steady diet of the same thing,” James said.“But even when you try to double him, his ability to erase double teams, to split double teams, to get creative… and he’s still strong too so it’s not like he’s a frail guy where you can double him and be super aggressive with him and get him off,” the Lakers legend added.Despite their best efforts, the Timberwolves’ rising star proved too much to handle. LeBron praised Edwards not just for his scoring, but for his leadership, “He’s learned over time, but he’s strong, he has low center of gravity, he has a great handle, he can shoot the ball extremely well.”He added, “He’s trusting his teammates to make plays… Listen, we gotta give Minnesota their flowers, that’s a damn good team, man.”Also Read: “Why so serious?” – Nikola Jokic turns heads dressing like Joker ahead of game 3 against Oklahoma City Thunder While fans remain loyal to LeBron, many are voicing concerns about the Lakers’ roster construction.

What’s the tile game Meghan Markle played on Netflix? A beginner’s guide to mahjong,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/whats-the-tile-game-meghan-markle-played-on-netflix-a-beginners-guide-to-mahjong/articleshow/120736644.cms,"Meghan Markle played the game of Mahjong in her Netflix series

From the Qing dynasty to pop culture

How is mahjong played?

Connor Wan, a 29-year-old British-Chinese artist, learned mahjong while visiting family in Hong Kong. He enjoyed it so much that he started the Four Winds Mahjong Club in London, and later brought it to Toronto after moving there in 2024. “Moving countries is hard, especially when you don’t know anyone,” he said. The club became popular quickly, not as a place for gambling, but for making friends and celebrating Asian culture. Nicole Wong, a writer and audio producer from California, started playing mahjong as a teenager with her grandparents. She later began The Mahjong Project in 2019 to share the game’s cultural stories and organise pop-up game nights. This year, she published a book called Mahjong: House Rules from Across the Asian Diaspora. Nicole says the sound of the tiles is especially powerful. “Mahjong is more than just fun,” she says. “It has a deep history and brings back strong memories.” In Toronto, Robyn Feldberg has taught over 250 people how to play mahjong through her courses. She donates all the money—about $50,000 so far—to charities like Save A Child’s Heart. She says the game is especially popular with young mothers who want a fun way to relax and connect with others. “They tell me, ‘We want something that’s just for us,’” she said.

A centuries-old Chinese game called mahjong is having a modern revival across continents, from luxury cruise ships and trendy hotel lounges to Meghan Markle’s Netflix series.In the sixth episode of her docuseries With Love, the Duchess of Sussex invites friends for a cosy game night – playing mahjong, reports the Globe and Mail.The four-person tile-based game, traditionally associated with Chinese culture, is now catching on with new generations across the globe. “The game itself is really so fun,” says Markle. “But what was so great was the idea of learning something new with your friends, together... the mahjong becomes the background of the expansion of friendship. It’s the feeling of community.”Mahjong dates back to the mid-1800s during the Qing Dynasty in China. Traditionally played with 144 tiles, the game blends skill, strategy and a touch of luck. Players pick and discard tiles to form winning hands, much like the card game rummy.The game’s expansion across the world has now erupted into a full-blown trend. The World Mahjong Championship was recently held in Mississauga, Ontario – the first time it’s been hosted in North America. Hotels such as the Ace Hotel New York and Thompson Hotel Dallas regularly hold mahjong-themed nights.Fans with money to spare are buying fancy mahjong sets from Hermès, Louis Vuitton, and Ralph Lauren. Some are even splashing out on luxury tables that shuffle the tiles automatically – costing over $4,500.Even cruise ships have joined the trend, offering mahjong tournaments and special rooms just for playing the game.Mahjong is played with 144 tiles. Players begin by shuffling the tiles face down. Everyone rolls dice and the highest roller becomes the dealer. Each player picks 36 tiles and builds a wall—two rows of 18 tiles. The walls are pushed forward, creating a space in the middle for discards. Each player then draws 13 tiles (the dealer starts with 14), and the game begins.Players take turns drawing one tile and discarding one, always keeping 13 tiles in hand. You can draw a new tile or pick up someone’s discarded one. If a discarded tile helps complete a set (called a meld), you can grab it, announce the set, and show the tiles. To win, a player must have four melds (like three or four matching tiles or a sequence of three in a suit) and one pair (two matching tiles)—making 14 tiles total.There are five types of tiles: Bamboo, Characters, Dots (these are the three main suits), and special tiles called Honors (Dragons and Winds) and Bonus (Flowers and Seasons). Each suit goes from 1 to 9. Honors and Bonus tiles add extra excitement but aren't needed to win. Mahjong mixes strategy and memory with a bit of luck—and it’s all about building the right sets before your opponents do.For many mahjong fans, it’s not just a game but a deeply social experience.","Mahjong dates back to the mid-1800s during the Qing Dynasty in China.

LONDON: Over 30 years after Britain's elite Magic Circle expelled a woman for posing as a man to gain admittance, the formerly male-only society is to welcome her back as a full member.The London-based international magic organisation ejected Sophie Lloyd after she masqueraded as a male in 1991 to win membership.But after her story came to light last year, the society's first female chair Laura London launched a search to track down Lloyd and apologise.She was eventually located living abroad and will later on Thursday be presented with a membership certificate at a special ceremony at the organisation's London headquarters.""It is so exciting after all these months tracking Sophie... I can't tell you how happy we are as a society to welcome her back into the fold,"" London told BBC radio.Lloyd posed as Raymond Lloyd for 18 months before unmasking herself as a woman.But members, who voted to admit women in September 1991, were so angered by her ""deliberate deception"" that they went ahead with her expulsion.The deception was in fact a two-person act involving the late magician Jenny Winstanley, who recruited Lloyd to help her prove that women magicians were just as good as men.""I did a 20-minute show in front of 200 people, three examiners, and spoke to the examiner for an hour-and-three-quarters afterwards,"" Lloyd said, recalling how she managed to pull the wool over everyone's eyes.After the Magic Circle changed its stance on allowing women in, Winstanley, who died in 2004, phoned the society to explain.""Two days later we got a letter to say Raymond's been expelled,"" said Lloyd.""We couldn't get our heads round it. We just thought, 'come on it's funny, it's amusing' but they didn't think so and Jenny was completely snubbed, unfortunately.""After the expulsion, Lloyd continued to perform magic for 11 years in an anti-bullying variety show before eventually moving overseas.She said the Magic Circle had changed out of all recognition in the 30 years since she was thrown out, adding: ""This is for Jenny really, Jenny would have loved it.""London said Thursday's ceremony would also be a chance to recognise Winstanley both for her contribution to magic and her audacious trick at the Magic Circle's expense.""I just think she's a wonderful woman and I know she'd have loved to be here and I just wish more than anything I could have met her myself,"" she said.The Magic Circle was founded in 1905 by around 20 magicians at a restaurant in London's Chinatown district.Members must vow never to give away the secrets of magic.Although women have now been admitted to the Magic Circle for over 30 years, they still make up only around five percent of the society's 1,700 membership.The body says, however, that increasing numbers are now coming through in the 10-18-year-old age group.","Sophie Lloyd was expelled from the Magic Circle after posing as a man to gain admittance.

IPL 2025 suspended: What happens next?

‘Bombs Are Coming’: India-Pak Aerial Clash Sparks Panic During IPL; Chilling Video from Dharamsala

The Board of Control for Cricket in India has suspended the Indian Premier League , with 16 games remaining, due to escalating conflict between India and Pakistan, and England has emerged as a potential host for the final stages of the tournament. The BCCI will prioritise hosting the remaining matches in India if security concerns are resolved, but the England and Wales Cricket Board is open to discussions about hosting if approached.ECB chief executive Richard Gould confirmed England would be willing to step in if needed.“We will help our counterparts at the BCCI where we can,” he was quoted as saying by English media outlet Mail Online.The initial postponement is for a week , following consultations with the 10 franchises who expressed concerns about player safety, broadcaster views, and fan sentiments.Former England captain Michael Vaughan suggested completing the IPL in the UK before India's Test series against England begins on June 20.""I wonder if it's possible to finish the IPL in the UK,"" Vaughan wrote on X. ""We have all the venues and the Indian players can then stay on for the Test series… Just a thought?""The timing of the remaining matches presents a significant challenge. Hosting the tournament before India's Test tour would require quick agreements between the BCCI, ECB, and English venues, complicated by ongoing domestic cricket schedules.Another possibility is rescheduling IPL games for September during the Asia Cup window , which is unlikely to proceed.England's schedule includes South Africa white-ball series from September 2 to 14, suggesting the IPL could potentially resume in England afterward, utilising grounds not needed for the County Championship.A potential clash with England's three-match T20 tour of Ireland from September 17-21 is considered less problematic.Devajit Saikia, the BCCI's honorary secretary, confirmed the decision to suspended the league was made after consultation with franchises who ""conveyed the concern and sentiments of their players, and also the views of the broadcaster, sponsors and fans.""The BCCI released a strong statement of national solidarity: ""At this critical juncture, the BCCI stands firmly with the nation. We express our solidarity with the government of India, the armed forces and the people of our country. The Board salutes the bravery, courage, and selfless service of our armed forces, whose heroic efforts under Operation Sindoor continue to protect and inspire the nation, as they lead a resolute response to the recent terrorist attack and the unwarranted aggression by Pakistan's armed forces.""The statement continued: ""While cricket remains a national passion, there is nothing greater than the nation and its sovereignty, integrity, and security of our country. The BCCI remains firmly committed to support all efforts that safeguard India and will always align its decisions in the best interest of the nation.""",The Indian Premier League has been suspended due to security concerns.

NEW DELHI: Sourav Ganguly, the former captain of India's cricket team, shared his views regarding the BCCI's decision to suspend IPL 2025 for a week on Friday.The BCCI made an announcement on Friday afternoon to halt the ongoing IPL 2025 immediately for a week, citing heightened tensions between India and Pakistan.""There is a war-like situation in the country, and the BCCI had to do this as there are so many Indian and foreign players. Let's hope the IPL restarts soon, as an important stage of the tournament is around the corner,"" Sourav Ganguly told ANI.""BCCI had to do this, especially Dharamshala, Chandigarh, Delhi, Rajasthan, Jaipur. These are all venues of IPL. It is necessary to do this according to the situation that happened last night. With time, it will get better and matches will also be played. BCCI will complete the IPL, and this situation will end very soon as Pakistan will not be able to handle the pressure for a long time,"" he continued.The Punjab Kings versus Delhi Capitals fixture at the HPCA Stadium in Dharamshala was suspended during the first innings on Thursday.The organisers directed spectators to leave the venue whilst ensuring the teams returned safely to their accommodation.HPCA member Sanjay Sharma informed ANI, ""Because of the tension between India and Pakistan, yesterday's match played between Punjab and Delhi was called off in the middle due to security reasons. But because there was a possibility that something like this could have happened, the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association, the Punjab Kings franchisee, and all the operations staff were already in touch with the administration. The administration was fully aware of this.""BCCI then organised arranged a dedicated Vande Bharat train to transport DC, PBKS players and the broadcast team from Dharamshala to Delhi.

Explained: Why Rohit Sharma retired from Test cricket

Rohit Sharma’s last press conference as a captain

NEW DELHI: Rohit Sharma ’s decision to step away from Test cricket has sparked widespread debate, and former cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar didn’t hold back when weighing in.Taking to his official ‘X’ handle, Manjrekar pointed to Rohit’s recent slump and waning fitness as key reasons why the decision made sense.“164 in his last 15 innings. Out of which 10 were at home v Bangladesh & NZ.Average 10.9. With his current fitness levels… Rohit Sharma’s days as Test opener were over. So…” Manjrekar posted, summarising his view with stark clarity.Rohit, 38, officially announced his Test retirement on Wednesday via Instagram. In a brief but heartfelt note, he wrote, “It’s been an absolute honour to represent my country in whites. Thank you for all the love and support over the years.”His exit comes at a time when his place in the Test squad was under scrutiny. With a five-match Test series against England looming and reports of potential leadership changes within the BCCI, the timing of his decision seemed inevitable.While Rohit bows out from the longest format, he remains committed to white-ball cricket. After leading India to T20 World Cup glory in 2024 and retiring from the format, he confirmed that he will continue playing ODIs.Despite finishing with an impressive Test career tally of 4,301 runs, 12 centuries, and a highest score of 212, his recent form had noticeably dipped.In his final nine matches, Rohit averaged just 10.93 and even dropped himself during the Sydney Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.Away from the pitch, Rohit also took aim at the current state of cricket commentary in India, calling it “disappointing” in a candid interview.ALSO READ: 'It is very disappointing': Rohit Sharma not happy with Indian commentary standards He criticised the shift in focus from the game to sensationalism, highlighting a growing disconnect between the media and cricket itself.As he moves on from the whites, Rohit’s legacy—especially in white-ball formats—remains firmly intact.",Rohit Sharma announced his Test retirement on Wednesday. Former cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar said the decision made sense. The 38-year-old remains committed to white-ball cricket.
