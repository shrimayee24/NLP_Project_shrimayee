In a viral video, Akram criticized the management for their lack of consistency and stability in leadership roles.""They replaced Babar with Shaheen as Pakistan captain.The latter lost one series and the chairman got changed during that phase. The newcomer asked to change the captain and got it done. This is just not on. People make fun of us in world cricket. They don't get it. If you have made (Shaheen) Afridi the captain, give him a year,"" said Akram.T20 World Cup : Schedule Akram further added that he and other former cricketers are fortunate to be away from Pakistan cricket, as it has become a source of constant criticism and politics.""They don't ask us. It's good that we are away from Pakistan cricket. It is a blessing in disguise because it is just criticism, politics,"" he added.The legendary fast bowler's comments come in the wake of Pakistan's early exit from the ongoing T20 World Cup after losses to the USA and India.Babar Azam had stepped down from his leadership role following Pakistan's disappointing performance in the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup last year, where they failed to reach the knockout stages. Shaheen Shah Afridi was appointed as the T20I captain, while Shan Masood took over the red-ball leadership after the ODI World Cup campaign in November.However, Afridi's tenure as captain was short-lived, as Pakistan managed to win only one game in a five-match T20I series against New Zealand. With the appointment of Mohsin Naqvi as the new PCB chairman, Babar Azam was reinstated as the white-ball captain.Former Pakistan speedster Shoaib Akhtar also questioned the decision to appoint Babar Azam as captain in the first place.

Did he even know a thing or two about captaincy?"" remarked Akhtar.","Former Pakistan cricketer Wasim Akram has expressed his disappointment with the Pakistan Cricket Board's decision to remove Shaheen Afridi as captain after just one series.

IF INDIA vs AUSTRALIA GETS WASHED OUT

GROUP 2

With the race to the T20 World Cup semifinals in Group 1 down to the last two matches, eyes are on all the permutations, combinations and qualification scenarios on offer, with all four teams still in with a chance to make it to the knockout stage of the tounament.But besides the performances of the players and the teams, one other factor that always remains in the mix is the weather.In the first of the crucial last two remaining matches in Group 1, it will be India vs Australia on Monday at the Daren Sammy National Cricket Stadium in Gros Islet , St Lucia.The skies above the stadium are forecast to remain mostly cloudy through the duration of the game that is scheduled for a 10:30 am (local time) start, which is 8 pm in India.According to accuweather.com, Monday morning in St Lucia will be ""partly sunny"" but with ""a thunderstorm in parts of the area"" besides being ""windy"" with a cloud cover of 85%. That forecast will improve as the day moves into the afternoon, when the cloud cover is expected to reduce to 47%.All in all, a typical Caribbean weather is in store during the day game on Monday.While unbeaten India (4 points and net run-rate +2.425) are the frontrunners to reach the semis, Australia (2 points, NRR +0.223) could be knocked out if they lose to India. Then, if Afghanistan (2 points, NRR -0.650) go on to beat Bangladesh (0 point, NRR -2.489) in the last match of the 'Super 8s', the Afghans will join India as the two semifinalists from Group 1.If the game happens to end in a no-result because of a washout, then Australia will end up with three points. The reigning ODI champions will then want the Afghanistan vs Bangladesh match to be either washed out or end in a win for Bangladesh.In case both the games don't produce any result, Australia will edge Afghanistan on NRR, while a defeat against Bangladesh will leave the Afghans exiting the tournament with two points as opposed to Australia's three.South Africa and defending champions England have made it to the semifinals from Group 2, with the Proteas finishing on top with six points and England finishing second with four. The two co-hosts West Indies and USA have been eliminated.","India play Australia in the first of the last two T20 World Cup matches in St Lucia.

NEW DELHI: India is set to face Australia in their final Super 8 match of the T20 World Cup on Monday, aiming to secure a third consecutive victory and potentially jeopardize Australia's chances of reaching the semi-finals. Australia's unexpected loss to Afghanistan on Saturday night has left them relying on the outcome of Afghanistan's final game against Bangladesh.India, having suffered heart breaking defeats against Australia in major ICC events, would relish the opportunity to see their strong rivals exit the tournament prematurely. With back-to-back wins against Afghanistan and Bangladesh, India has already ticked all the boxes in fine-tuning their game ahead of the knockouts. Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli played substantial innings against Afghanistan, while Shivam Dube silenced his critics with a crucial knock.Hardik Pandya's all-round performance has been the biggest positive for India in this tournament, complementing his incisive bowling spells with valuable contributions with the bat. Kuldeep Yadav has quickly made match-winning contributions and will be relied upon for wickets in the middle overs. Despite the hectic travel schedule, the Indian team management is unlikely to rotate players.Australia, meanwhile, has plenty of concerns following their disappointing batting and fielding performance against Afghanistan. Captain Mitchell Marsh , who has scored only 88 runs in six games at a strike rate of 111, needs to lead from the front against India. Off-spinner Glenn Maxwell's economy rate of 8.58 runs per over is another area of concern for the Australian team.The match-up between Virat Kohli and leg-spinner Adam Zampa, who has had the upper hand against the Indian superstar on multiple occasions, will be an intriguing battle to watch.Australia may consider bringing back Mitchell Starc in place of the extra spinner, Ashton Agar, for the crucial encounter against India.The 11th match of the Super Eights in the T20 World Cup 2024 will feature a thrilling encounter between India (IND) and Australia (AUS). The game is scheduled to take place on June 24 at 8:00 PM IST at the Daren Sammy National Cricket Stadium located in Gros Islet, St. Lucia, West Indies.In their head-to-head T20I record, India and Australia have faced each other in 31 matches. India has emerged victorious in 19 of those games, while Australia has managed to secure 11 wins. One match between the two sides ended without a result.The Daren Sammy Stadium has proven to be the most favourable venue for batters in this tournament. The pitch has offered excellent support for shot-making, allowing batters to score freely. However, spinners are expected to play a crucial role in determining the outcome of the game.In the five matches played so far, teams batting first have won three times, while teams batting second have won twice. The average score for teams batting first is 188, compared to 151 for those batting second. The highest total recorded is 218/5 by the West Indies against Afghanistan, while the lowest is 114/10 by Afghanistan against the West Indies.According to the pitch report, top-order batters are likely to perform well as the pitch favors batting when the ball is hard and new. For bowlers, spinners can be effective as the ball gets older and softer, and death-over bowlers are expected to play a crucial role.T20 World Cup 2024 Stats: 152 Runs in 5 MatchesRishabh Pant, the Indian wicketkeeper-batsman, has been the most consistent performer for his team.

ST. LUCIA: There’s an active volcano in a small town called Soufriere, about 55 kilometres away from where India were playing Australia on Monday. The fumes that emanate from the eye of the volcano gives one the feeling that the mountains are angry. It seemed that everyone with India in their hearts at the Darren Sammy International Stadium here on Monday were physical representations of that volcano.No one had forgotten Ahmedabad, November 19 — the day Australia snatched the ODI World Cup from India last year — and it was payback time.Now, India will play England in the semifinal on the spinner-friendly Guyana track on Thursday while Australia’s fate isn’t in their hands: they are out if Afghanistan beat Bangladesh, or if Bangladesh win big.The architect of India’s win was ‘Hitman’ Rohit Sharma himself. His mood on Monday was something similar to what it was in Ahmedabad in the World Cup final . But his innings had been cut short by an outstanding catch by Travis Head.Here in St. Lucia, there wasn’t any such otherworldly activity that could stop Rohit as he played the innings of the World Cup so far. It was Rohit’s 92 off 41 balls that was the cornerstone of India’s 205 for 5 which left the Aussies stunned once they had put India in.After Virat Kohli (0) failed once again, it was a complete Rohit show for the next 10 overs or so. It started with the first ball of the third over by Mitchell Starc, which the left-arm pacer tried to bowl full and Rohit’s slash over cover went for a six.Rohit smashed four sixes and a four in that over which yielded 29 and swung the momentum in India’s favour. Rohit didn’t care who the bowler was; he just knew he had to go after him. Anything in his hitting range was going over the top while those dropped short were pulled with power. It was Rohit’s uncluttered mindset that was central to this onslaught.The dominance of Rohit was highlighted by the fact that India were 52-1 in the sixth over when he reached his 50. An innings of this quality deserved a century as a topping, but Starc, coming back for his second spell, finally landed a yorker that hit the inside edge of Rohit’s bat and knocked the stumps over.When Rohit was dismissed in 11.2 overs, the score was 127. After that, off the 52 balls, India managed 78, which proves that run-scoring probably wasn’t as easy as Rohit made it seem. Still, India managed a score which was big enough.The Aussies, though, tried with Head (76 off 43 balls) taking life in his hands and going after the Indian bowling. There were periods during their chase when it seemed that the target was actually achievable. But somewhere in the middle, left-arm wrist-spinner Kuldeep Yadav (2-24) bowled an outstanding spell that halted the Aussies in their tracks.Kuldeep was assisted by a brilliant one-handed catch at deep square-leg by Axar Patel to dismiss Aussie No. 3 Mitchell Marsh, which was one of the turning points of the game.Still, there was a Head to deal with, but with wickets falling at the other end, you could gauge that the swashbuckler was getting impatient. Coming back for his second spell, he induced an edge off Head and it was fitting that Rohit completed a skier. The rest was a formality.",Rohit Sharma scores 92 off 41 balls as India beat Australia in T20 World Cup. India will play England in semifinal on spinner-friendly Guyana track on Thursday.

The incident occurred during a tense ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024 Super 8 Group 1 match between Afghanistan and Bangladesh at the Arnos Vale Ground, Kingstown, St Vincent on Tuesday.It was the 20th over of Afghanistan’s innings, with the team struggling at 107 for 5. Rashid Khan, known for his aggressive batting style, attempted a helicopter shot off Tanzim Hasan Sakib. Instead of finding the mid-wicket boundary, he got a leading edge that sent the ball looping over the covers.Spotting an opportunity to add pressure to the fielders, Rashid sprinted for a second run. However, his partner Karim Janat, who had already settled at the striker's end, decisively sent him back.Frustrated by the missed chance, Rashid threw his bat in anger towards Janat, an act that left spectators stunned. Janat, trying to diffuse the situation, approached Rashid for a chat, but the captain was visibly disinterested and walked away, still fuming.Watch:Their Afghanistan batting lineup struggled to build momentum, with the top order failing to capitalize on starts. Rahmanullah Gurbaz was the top scorer with 43 off 55 balls, but his efforts were overshadowed by a low strike rate.Ibrahim Zadran and Azmatullah Omarzai couldn’t contribute much, while Gulbadin Naib and Mohammad Nabi fell cheaply.Karim Janat, despite the confrontation, managed to score a valuable 7 off 6 balls, while Rashid Khan remained unbeaten on 19 off 10, showcasing his ability to accelerate in the death overs.Their efforts, however, were hampered by disciplined bowling from Bangladesh. Tanzim Hasan Sakib, Taskin Ahmed, and Rishad Hossain kept the Afghan batsmen in check, with Rishad claiming three crucial wickets.The powerplay didn’t go in Afghanistan's favour, scoring only 27 runs in the first six overs.

Rohit's scintillating 92 off just 41 deliveries propelled India to a formidable total of 205 for five, after Australia had won the toss and elected to field on a batting-friendly surface.Australia, facing the prospect of an early exit from the tournament, showcased their characteristic resilience during the run chase. Skipper Mitchell Marsh, who rediscovered his form, contributed a valuable 37 off 28 balls, while Travis Head, who had previously tormented India in the ODI World Cup final last year, played a blistering knock of 76 off 43 deliveries.However, the Indian bowling trio of Kuldeep Yadav (2/24), Jasprit Bumrah (1/29), and Arshdeep Singh (3/37) rose to the occasion, effectively containing the Australian batsmen and restricting them to 181 for seven. India's victory secured their position as the top team in their group.With their second defeat in three matches, Australia's fate now rests in the hands of Afghanistan, who are set to face Bangladesh later on Monday. The outcome of that game will determine which team claims the second semifinal spot from Group 1, alongside India.India secured their third consecutive victory in the Super Eights, earning them a spot in the second semifinal against the reigning champions, England, which will take place on Thursday in Guyana.Australia displayed their characteristic resilience during the chase, but their efforts ultimately waned in the final overs.The 86-run partnership between Head and Marsh was marked by their exceptional ball-striking prowess. Marsh thrilled the crowd with his short-arm pulls that sent the ball soaring into the stands, while Head focused on the straight boundary. ""The southpaw smoked Hardik Pandya for a flat six down the ground, reminiscent of his ruthlessness in Ahmedabad on the ill-fated night of November 19.""Amidst the impressive hitting from Marsh and Head, Kuldeep's bowling performance was particularly noteworthy. However, one of his wickets was solely due to the outstanding athleticism of Axar Patel, who made a spectacular one-handed catch while leaping at deep square leg to dismiss Marsh.With Australia requiring 65 runs off the final 30 deliveries and Head still at the crease, the outcome of the match remained uncertain. However, the MVP Jasprit Bumrah returned to the attack and removed the opener with a slower delivery, effectively ending Australia's chances of mounting a successful comeback.Rohit Sharma's magnificent innings set the tone for India's batting performance on the most conducive surface of the tournament. Despite Australia's decision to field first, Rohit capitalized on the conditions, crafting a brilliant knock that included seven boundaries and eight maximums, one of which was his record-extending 200th six in the format.The innings began with a promising start as Rohit elegantly flicked Mitchell Starc for a boundary in the first over. However, Virat Kohli (0) fell shortly after, mistiming a pull shot off Josh Hazlewood and finding a fielder in the deep.Undeterred, Rohit maintained his aggressive approach, particularly against Starc, whose second over proved to be his most expensive in T20Is, conceding 29 runs. Rohit's aerial drives over extra cover accounted for the first two sixes of the over, followed by a powerful strike into the cow corner region. The fourth six came from a mishit that sailed over the wicketkeeper's head.Rohit's 87-run partnership with Rishabh Pant (15 off 14) further solidified India's position. Pant greeted Adam Zampa, Australia's key spinner, with a six over long-on, but Zampa ended his spell wicketless. Another highlight of Rohit's innings was his one-knee six off Pat Cummins over deep mid-wicket in the bowler's first over.India deserve praise for preventing any bowler from finding their rhythm. Rohit reached his half-century with a single at the conclusion of the fifth over, which was also the quickest of the tournament.When Marcus Stoinis entered the attack in the eighth over, Rohit unleashed a six over extra cover. Rohit's innings was so authoritative that he could choose his spot against all the renowned bowlers.It could have been a well-earned century, but Starc returned to dismiss the Indian captain with a yorker.Suryakumar Yadav (31 off 15), Hardik Pandya (27 not out off 17), and Shivam Dube (28 off 22) also contributed, but India failed to capitalize on the final five overs, scoring only 43 runs while losing one wicket.While his teammates conceded runs, Hazlewood appeared to be bowling on a different surface, giving away only 14 runs and taking one wicket in his four overs.","India beat Australia by 24 runs in their final Super Eights match of the T20 World Cup.

NEW DELHI: India rode on skipper Rohit Sharma 's scintillating 41-ball 92 and an all-round bowling display to beat Australia by 24 runs in their final Super 8 fixture and qualify for the semifinals of the T20 World Cup in St Lucia on Monday.With the win, India entered their fifth semis and also recorded most wins at the ICC's T20 showpiece.Batting first, Rohit fired on all cylinders powering India to an imposing 205 for five.Chasing a steep total, former champions Australia gave a tough fight in a see-saw second half but India players held on to their nerves to eventually emerge on top and avenged their last year's ODI World Cup final defeat.The game had quite a few twists and turns but an all-round India proved to be better than the Aussies in most of them to secure a win.India lost opener Virat Kohli for yet another single-digit score -- a 5-ball duck -- but Rohit was in the mood for a special knock. Despite the early fall of Kohli in the second over, the India skipper went out in all out attack mode, smashing the Aussie bowlers left-right and centre.Paceman Mitchell Starc, in one of his overs inside powerplay, was dealt severely by Rohit as he smashed 4 sixes and a four in it. He then went on to score the fastest fifty of this World Cup -- off 19 balls.For the second wicket, skipper Rohit and Rishabh Pant shared a phenomenal 38-ball 87 stand to leave the Aussies in a disarray. With the help of 7 fours and 8 sixes, Rohit was in carnage mode and spanked the bowlers to all corners of the park at will. Missing out on a well-deserved ton, Rohit departed for 92 but he had set the platform for a big total.After Rohit's fall, the Australian bowlers somewhat managed to restrict India batters but the likes of Suryakumar Yadav (31), Shivam Dube (28) and Hardik Pandya (27*) ensured India crossed the 200-run mark.Chasing a steep total, Australia had to go hard from Ball 1 and they were rattled early as Arshdeep Singh dismissed explosive opener David Warner in the first over itself for 6.India then had a couple of fielding lapses as Rishabh Pant and Arshdeep dropped skipper Mitchell Marsh twice as he rode on his luck to build a solid stand with Travis Head.As Marsh and Head threatened to take the game away with a sizzling 48-ball 81 stand, Axar Patel's stunner at the fence ended the former's stay for 37. Pulling off one of the best catches of the tournament, Axar plucked a Marsh catch out of thin air to hand India a much-needed breakthrough. As Marsh perished on the final ball of the ninth over, brakes were put on a cruising Australia.Despite losing Marsh, Australia had Travis Head in the middle, who looked at his fluent best in the chase. With 9 fours and 4 sixes during his stay in the middle, Head stitched another 41-run stand, this time with Glenn Maxwell to keep Australia alive in the chase. But India then had Kuldeep Yadav knocking over Maxwell for 20 and in-form Marcus Stoinis followed him soon back to the pavilion as quick wickets rattled Australia.Head still looked threatening but as he ran out of partners at the other end, pressure kept building on him. Bumrah then returned in the 17th over to dismiss Head for 76 (43 balls) as India tightened their grip on the game. With required rate going out of hands, Matthew Wade (1), Pat Cummins (11*) and Mitchell Starc (4*) weren't able to take their side across the finish line. The Aussies were eventually stopped at 181 for 7.",India beat Australia by 24 runs to qualify for semifinals of T20 World Cup.

This moment of play drew a reaction from Kohi, reflecting a sentiment likely shared by many fans and observers of the game.T20 World Cup: Schedule "" Virat Kohli ka reaction agar aap logo ne dekha hoga jab Rishabh Pant out huye (If you saw Virat Kohli's reaction when Rishabh Pant got out), he didn't know the camera was on him. Immediately, he covered his face with a towel, similar to how fans would react seeing Pant's dismissal,"" Manjrekar said on Star Sports.Manjrekar pointed out that Pant seemed to be in control of his innings until the moment of his dismissal. The decision to play a high-risk shot, especially when Pant possesses a wide array of conventional shots, was the crux of the frustration.""The man who has so many good shots in the front of the wicket in his repertoire should try and avoid such a shot. Telling a player like Pant to show some patience would not be ideal, but maybe Kohli might try to tell him,"" he added.According to Manjrekar, while advising patience to a naturally aggressive player like Pant might not be the most practical approach, there could be an expectation for him to exercise better judgment in shot selection, particularly in crucial phases of the game.Despite Pant's dismissal and Kohli's subsequent frustration, India moved closer to a T20 World Cup semifinal berth with a commanding 50-run win over Bangladesh in a Super Eight match.

Excerpts...

In times of crisis, how do you boost the team's morale?

How would you describe Australia's aggressive style of cricket?

Talking about the ODI World Cup final last year, you guys never appeared to be under pressure, even in front of a packed stadium in Ahmedabad. How would you describe the journey to that title win?

What is your approach and strategy as a captain?

Your take on docu-series 'The Test'..

NEW DELHI: It's India vs Australia , and the stakes in the T20 World Cup clash are incredibly high. The 2023 ODI World Cup final defeat must be on the minds of Rohit Sharma and his men. However, this time India have slightly upper hand as the Aussies will face the pressure of a must-win game in the 'Super 8s' match at St Lucia on Monday.Australia suffered a 21-run defeat to Afghanistan in their 'Super 8s' fixture, jeopardising their chances of qualifying for the semifinals.That thrilling contest has left Group 1 wide open, with none of the teams yet assured of finishing in the top two for a place in the semis.Ahead of the much-anticipated match, TimesofIndia.com caught up with the star Australian pacer Pat Cummins .I think knowing the guys really well gives you a sense of what people need at certain stages. And that’s not just me. It’s not always just on me. We’ve got some wonderful senior guys who, if they feel like the dressing room needs something, they’ll step up and lighten the mood or have a serious moment or whatever is needed. So it feels like, between the coaches and senior guys, we can always self-adjust pretty well.I probably wouldn't define the Aussie brand of cricket, to be honest. I'd probably define the team and the way that we want to go about it. And that’s just playing to our strengths. For some guys, that's being quite stoic, taking their time and wearing down the bowlers. For other guys, it’s the opposite; it's going out and taking the game on from ball one, putting the pressure back on the bowlers. So everyone in our team does it a slightly different way, but hopefully, when it comes to Test cricket in particular, we're relentless and having a bit of fun.There were so many different obstacles to overcome throughout that tournament. Even leading into the tournament, we had four of our main guys injured and (they had) hardly played a game leading up to that first match. So it felt like we were kind of putting out fire the whole tournament. There were injuries that popped up at different levels, along with issues of form and selections.It all culminated in the final where, even when things hadn't gone right, we still found a way to win some games. I think that gave us a lot of confidence going into the final. We went in there with a sense of having nothing to lose and probably came together for our best game.I try to be quite people-oriented. These are some of my really good mates, and I've played a lot of times with them. So hopefully, I build really good relationships. Hopefully, they know that they've got my backing, no matter what, pretty much. Then, we collaborate and try to work together to achieve some special things.I think we've seen with the first couple of series, how well-received they were by cricket-loving fans and even by the people who aren't necessarily cricket fans. People who don't know cricket or haven't watched much of it are being drawn into the sport through the documentary. We feel some responsibility to keep doing these series. The fans love it, and it brings more people to cricket, which is only a good thing.",Pat Cummins talks to TimesofIndia.com ahead of T20 World Cup clash with India.

Virat Kohli showed glimpses of rediscovering his prolific white-ball touch during India's 'Super 8s' match against Bangladesh, and experts are hoping that it's only a sign of big things to come from the batting legend in the business end of this T20 World Cup , begining with the crucial concluding 'Super 8s' match against Australia on Monday.With all four teams in Group 1 still in the fray for the two semifinal spots, the game in St Lucia is of critical importance to the fate of the teams.With four points and a healthy net run-rate, unbeaten India are all but through to the knockouts while Australia's chances hinge on a win against India and the result in the Afghanistan vs Bangaldesh match.Afghanistan's upset win over Australia threw the group open, leaving the last two matches to decide who finishes as No. 1 and No. 2 in Group 1 to enter the semis.Talking about Kohli's progress through the tournament so far, he has scored only 66 runs in five innings, 61 of which came in two knocks alone -- 24 vs Afghanistan and 37 vs Bangladesh. His strike rate is 108.19. In the initial group stage of the tournament, Kohli's struggling knocks read 1, 4 and 0.Kohli came into this World Cup on the back of a stupendous Indian Premier League season, which saw him winning the Orange Cap with tally of 741 runs for Royal Challengers Bengaluru.Speaking to India's veteran offspinner Ravichandran Ashwin on his YouTube channel, former India wicketkeeper Robin Uthappa felt a half-century from Kohli against Australia will set him up for the semis and hopefully the final.""...to get a solid Virat Kohli innings from him, especially looking at the whole tournament's perspective. I want a 65-70 not out. Even if you get (it at) a 120-125 strike rate, I do not really care. I want that one solid innings from Virat Kohli. Because once he gets that little taste of blood, that human being can do anything. And for me, before we hit the semifinals, I want him to have that one innings,"" said Uthappa.The 2007 T20 World Cup winner also felt that skipper Rohit Sharma should continue his aggressive approach at the top of the order.""Rohit is very clear with the way he approaches his batting.

The Indian bowlers then restricted Mitchell Marsh 's team to 181/7, securing a 24-run victory and advancing to semifinal.The persistent wind at the venue posed a significant challenge for the batsmen, prompting Rohit to adapt his batting style. He revealed that he had to play more strokes on the off side to minimize the wind's impact on his shots, ultimately leading to his match-winning contribution.""I thought right from over number one, there was a strong breeze blowing across. They (Australia) changed their plan, bowling against the breeze, so I realised I had to open up the off side as well.""You've got to factor in the breeze and understand that the bowlers are smart as well and open up all sides of the field. When you keep an open mind and not just think of one shot, you can access all areas of the field,"" said the India skipper, as quoted by PTI, after the match.""200 is obviously a good score, but when you're playing on grounds like this where wind is a factor, anything is possible, but I thought we used the conditions very well. It was very pleasing to see how we were getting through those overs and getting the wickets at the same time.""Rohit expressed his confidence in Kuldeep Yadav 's ability to perform exceptionally well in the West Indies, following the wrist-spinner's experience with seamer-friendly conditions in the United States.Kuldeep returned excellent figures of 2/24 in his four overs.""Kuldeep, we understand the strengths he has, but you have to use it when you need it. The pitches in New York were seamer-friendly, but we knew he would play a big role later.""Rohit remained focused on the game's rhythm, asserting that his primary goal was to sustain the ""tempo"" of the match. He made it clear that personal milestones, such as reaching a century, were not his concern at that moment.""It was a good wicket, and you want to try and back yourself to play those kinds of shots. I've been trying to do that for a few years now, and I'm glad it came off today. The fifties and hundreds don't matter, I wanted to bat with the same tempo and carry on.""You want to make big scores, yes, but at the same time you want to make the bowlers think where the next shot is coming, and I think I managed to do that today,"" he added.Rohit expressed his desire for the Indian team to maintain their current style of play as they progress into the knockout stages of the tournament.""We don't want to do anything different (in the knockouts). We want to play the same way, understand what the individuals need to do in a given situation, and play freely.""So far we've been doing that consistently, and semifinals, we have to try and do the same thing. It'll be nice (to play England in the semifinal). Nothing changes for us, we want to focus on what we can do as a team, and take the game on.""",India beat Australia by 24 runs in their final T20 World Cup Super Eight match.

They were poor in all departments last night,"" PTI quoted Papios, a police officer who was guarding an almost empty Darren Sammy Stadium ahead of the India-Australia game.The West Indies had the opportunity to secure an unprecedented third T20 World Cup victory. A significant aspect of the storyline revolved around Darren Sammy, a local icon who achieved fame after leading the team to two championship wins. The entire Caribbean region had pinned their hopes on Sammy to replicate his success, this time as the team's head coach.However, after the devastating defeat in Antigua, the public's perception of him has undoubtedly shifted.""It is time we sack him. He is not good for the team and does politics. Poor selection cost the team,"" said a member of the ground staff in St Lucia.Kevin Brathwaite, an ardent supporter of the game in Barbados, shares a bleak outlook regarding the sport's prospects in the Caribbean.""I don't support the West Indies team. I am supporting England in this tournament. There is too much regional politics in the game here. So there is no reason to support them.""I would want to see West Indies bring back the glory days in Test cricket but with the way things are going, it is not happening in the foreseeable future.

However, it is in the other two formats where the West Indies are struggling to keep up with their competitors.The domestic cricket structure in the Caribbean is such that each team participates in a mere five first-class matches per season.""Test cricket is dying and it not surprising.

Despite this early setback, Rohit took charge from there.Hitman was especially ruthless against Mitchell Starc, the only addition to the Australian side after their surprising 21-run defeat to Afghanistan. Rohit punished Starc by hitting him for 29 runs in a single over. The onslaught included four sixes, with two consecutive hits over extra cover, a deep midwicket smash, and a top-edged full toss over the wicketkeeper.Rohit's dominating innings came to an end when he was bowled by Starc with an excellent yorker, leaving India at 127 for 3 in the 12th over.

This unforgettable performance included six sixes in an over, a moment etched in cricket history.KL Rahul is another notable name on this prestigious list, having scored a fifty off 18 balls against Scotland in Dubai in 2021.

This defeat was the third consecutive final that Argentina and Messi had lost, following their 2014 World Cup loss to Germany and the 2015 Copa America final, where Chile emerged victorious on home soil.At the time, the narrative surrounding Messi's inability to win a major title with Argentina was a subject of intense debate. Comparisons were drawn between his achievements at the club level with Barcelona and the glory Diego Maradona had brought to the national team, fueling discussions about the level of adoration Messi could garner from the Argentine public.The weight of that defeat was so profound that Messi announced his retirement from the national team immediately after the match, stating, ""I think that's it. The national team is over for me."" However, his decision was met with an outpouring of support from fans, the Argentine president, and even Maradona himself, urging him to reconsider.Messi's eventual return to the national team set the stage for Argentina's triumphant World Cup victory in 2022, a feat that not only silenced his critics but also transformed him as a person, according to his former coach Gerardo 'Tata' Martino, who now coaches Messi atInter Miami .As Argentina prepare to face Chile once again in the Copa America, the focus shifts to the present. Argentina's coach, Lionel Scaloni, dismisses the notion of dwelling on the past, emphasizing that "" Football goes on, the ball doesn't stop."" The world champions, favoured to win the Copa America, aim to continue their winning momentum after a 2-0 victory over Canada in their opening match.On the other hand, Chile, no longer the formidable force they were in 2016, will be motivated to challenge the world champions under the guidance of their new coach, Ricardo Gareca. Gareca acknowledges the aggressive nature of Argentina's play and the need for his team to be defensively focused while finding ways to counter their strategies.","Lionel Messi set to return to MetLife Stadium for Argentina's Copa America clash with Chile.

Croatia, meanwhile, face an anxious wait to see if their two points will be enough to secure qualification as one of the four best third-placed teams.The match was characterized by contrasting styles, with Croatia dominating possession and Italy relying on a more direct approach.

His clinical finish in the 13th minute proved to be the decisive goal, settling the contest in Spain's favour. Torres's performance, along with others, undoubtedly gave De La Fuente valuable insights as he prepares for the business end of the tournament.Spain's achievement of winning all three group games mirrors their feat from the 2008 campaign, where they went on to claim the title. In contrast, Albania's hopes of advancing to the knockout rounds for the first time were dashed, as they finished bottom of the group with a solitary point.Spain topped Group B with nine points, while Italy secured second place with four points after snatching a last-gasp 1-1 draw against Croatia, who finished third with two points. Albania's defeat also had implications for other teams, as France, the Netherlands, and England secured their progression to the next round before their final group matches.De La Fuente's decision to rotate his squad extensively, with Aymeric Laporte being the only player retained from the previous match, showcased Spain's depth and allowed fringe players to stake their claims. Despite Albania's passionate support and a fervent atmosphere created by their fans, Spain's quality shone through from the outset.Dani Olmo 's incisive pass and Torres's clinical finish set the tone, and Spain controlled the tempo of the opening period, leaving Albania unable to capitalize on their energy and support.

, ex-England star striker, tells TOI the team’s strength is in the attack but the manager is relying too much on a defensive set-up...

England started off as one of the favourites, but they are not playing well. What do you think is going wrong?

But two matches down, what do you think is not working for the team?

You think England are not being too brave?

What is the best way to involve

Trent Alexander-Arnold

?

You made a case for Cole Palmer…

Do you think Southgate is confused about his starting eleven that way?

Do you think players should take more responsibility for their performances?

What about your generation?

Michael, if you close your eyes right now and think about your favourite moment in an England shirt, what would it be?

(Watch UEFA

Euro 2024

on Sony LIV)

Whenever Michael Owen closes his eyes, and dreams of himself in an England shirt, he sees an 18-year-old boy wonder jinking through the Argentine defenders in Saint-Etienne at the 1998 World Cup and scoring that goal. A goal iconic enough to draw comparisons with a Maradona moment. “I think that’s the one that people remember me for,” the 44-year-old tells TOI.A member of England’s Golden Generation, Owen best understands the pressure that the current lineup feels as it struggles at the Euros in Germany. Owen knows pressure is unavoidable but points out that there is more to England’s malady than just this. Excerpts from a chat...It’s been quite difficult to watch so far. We’re trying to build momentum in the tournament. I think Gareth Southgate ’s probably going to change his team a little bit against Slovenia to try to find that missing ingredient. We’re going to be all right. We still have time to build.It’s not all doom and gloom. We’ve got four points and we’ll be in the knockout stage. Looking at the positives, I don’t think many teams that win tournaments start the tournament winning 5-0 and keep going in that vein. If England had won five-nil in the first two games, we’d all be saying, England are going to win the tournament. And maybe that’s not the attitude or the mindset that we want our players to have or our supporters.I knew coming into the tournament I was going to be frustrated. I think Southgate is an amazing manager in terms of man-management. He creates a great environment. He has great attention to detail. He’s been there before as a player. He knows what works.He’s an exceptional manager in a lot of ways. But I knew coming into the tournament that I would be disagreeing with his team. Southgate has always played with two holding midfield players, and I’ve never believed that you need two. Look at the most successful teams. Look at all the Premier League teams – they all play with one. Rodri plays for Manchester City, probably the best team in the world at the moment. They just play with one. Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea, Man Utd all play the same. I just think it’s too defensive to play with two.Here, Declan Rice has been joined by Trent Alexander Arnold. Maybe in the next game, it might be a Kobbie Mainoo or Adam Wharton or a different midfielder, but I don’t think we should be playing that. I think our strength is our attack. And how many players we can have that affect games. Declan Rice as the No. 6 is more than enough. We can play our back four. We can play Rice and then we can play two ahead of Rice and then two wide players and Harry Kane up front.So, I would be trying to get a more attacking team. I’d be trying to get one more player that’s more of an advanced player, a Cole Palmer , who’s had an amazing season for Chelsea. I would be trying to get him into our team, but this is not a surprise with Southgate. I knew he would be playing with two holding midfielders. We didn’t know who he would be playing with Rice. I have a feeling he’s going to stick with the same system, which is frustrating, but he might change one or two of the players.Absolutely. I think our strength is in our attacking players. We have players like Bukayo Saka, Phil Foden, Palmer, obviously Harry Kane as a striker. Anthony Gordon has had a great season at Newcastle. I’d love to see him play. And then we got players like Jude Bellingham that are good from an attacking point of view. There are so many good attacking players that we need to squeeze into the team.I’ve always seen him as a right back. He is very dangerous when he comes into the midfield for Liverpool. But coming in from a right back position when nobody is marking you, and then coming in and being on your own is very, very different than just being a player that stays in midfield and has to receive the ball from a right back. (Because) then you’ve got people behind you, it’s a 360 degrees position, whereas playing at right back everything’s in front of you. You’ve really only got 180 degrees to look at. So, I think it’s a very different role. And even though he ends up in that position playing for Liverpool, it’s so different to actually staying in that position to start with.Southgate probably won’t play him as a right back. He’ll play other players there. But I would like to see Rice being the No. 6 and playing Foden and Bellingham ahead in midfield. And I would play Saka or Palmer and Gordon or Palmer. Just try to get an extra attacking midfield player instead of the No. 6.Anybody that’s watched the Premier League last season would see that even in a struggling team like Chelsea were for a large part of last season, Palmer was just outstanding, scored lots of goals; he can take the ball, he’s very brave; he’s young and he’s confident; he’s creative, he scores goals. I find it difficult looking at England’s bench and seeing his name, knowing what he could contribute on the pitch. If I were Southgate, I’d be trying to desperately find a role on the pitch for him.I don’t think he is. Well… in some ways he is. He’s always played in this way and the criticism has always been the same. This is not a new tournament for him. You know, in the last two tournaments, everybody has said, why do we play so defensive? Why are we playing two ‘Sixes’ or midfield players? He has always done this, which is why I knew I’d be frustrated that some of our best players were going to have to be on the bench. Maybe what he’s confused with now is who to play as the other No. 6 because we always had Kalvin Phillips and Rice in previous tournaments.Phillips is not there now. Jordan Henderson is not there either. And trying to find that replacement is what he’s a bit confused about. But if it was me, I wouldn’t be trying to find a replacement. I’d just be leaving Rice there on his own and getting one of the other great players in the team. What I’m debating and what I’m arguing with is not the players necessarily he’s selecting, it’s more the system. And if he’s going to play that system, of course he can’t play Cole. He can’t play a lot of players that I would love him to play. He’s not done that for a long time. I don’t think he’s going to change now.I think players, at the end of the day, do take responsibility. They’re the ones that are out on the pitch and they’re the ones that get criticized. So, I totally understand Harry Kane saying what he said (reacting to Gary Lineker’s comments). I thought his words were very well measured and very responsible and on behalf of the team, as the captain, I thought it was very good.You’re never going to change pundits. If it’s not Lineker, it’s somebody else. Pundits are being paid to give an opinion. But then again, it’s very accurate for Kane to come out and say, hang on a minute, some of you have played before. You know how difficult it is to play in a tournament. You know how difficult it is to represent England with all the pressure, expectations.What is unavoidable is playing for England, the expectation is perhaps different to any other nation, and I find it hard to find a solution and how we’re going to make things better in the future. Because you will always have this pressure.The longer we go without winning a tournament, the more pressure grows, the more difficult it is to be able to cope with it. Then your confidence is being drained by people that are criticizing you all the time and the pressure mounts and you don’t play well. It’s just very difficult being an England player. It has been very difficult being an England player for a long time now. But I don’t really know the solution.You’re never going to stop people having an opinion and you’re never going to stop players reading that opinion and listening to it and then fans listening to their opinion and then having their own opinion. If the game isn’t going well, they then boo their players. And then we get into this whole cycle, it’s just we’re all almost cutting each other’s throats. Fans, pundits, media, players, we’re all then fighting against each other and then we’ll get knocked out and it’ll be a big disaster, big inquest. It’s not easy at all.We’ve got great players, but we have a lot behind the scenes that these players have got to cope with as well.The pressure was probably on me and my teammates more than any player in the last few decades. We were classed as a golden generation that everybody thought would go and win competitions. We had heaps of pressure on us. And that is why I can talk about it with expertise and insight of actually being in that dressing room when the pressure was probably at its highest. I wouldn’t say there’s as much pressure now, as there was on our generation. It’s something that you’ve got to be able to manage as an England player. Not every player can do it. And one of the big criticisms over the years is, why don’t our players play as good for England as they do at club level? And that is true. You can only put it down to the pressure.Oh, wow. Well, I would say the goal in the World Cup against Argentina. I had some amazing moments. I scored in the European Championships quarterfinals (against Portugal, 2004), in the World Cup quarterfinals in 2002 against Brazil, but we ended up losing those games. We ended up losing against Argentina as well. Scoring a hat-trick away against Germany in the World Cup qualifiers was amazing. But I think the one moment what people remember me for, and probably my one iconic moment, was scoring that goal against Argentina as an 18-year-old in the World Cup.",Michael Owen tells TOI the team's strength is in the attack but the manager is relying too much on a defensive set-up.

NEW DELHI: The UEFA EURO 2024 group stage is progressing, with the second set of matches underway. As the tournament advances, the round of 16 is starting to take shape. We will keep you informed about the permutations, rules, and tiebreakers.Germany and Switzerland have secured their spots in the round of 16 from Group A, while Poland and Scotland are eliminated.24 June: Albania (1) vs Spain (6), Croatia (1) vs Italy (3)Spain have secured their spot in the round of 16 as the group winners.Italy's path to the round of 16 as group runners-up is straightforward: avoid a loss against Croatia. However, if they suffer a defeat and Albania manages to upset Spain, Italy will be eliminated from the competition.Albania's chances of advancing to the round of 16 as group runners-up hinge on a victory against Spain, coupled with Croatia defeating Italy. In this scenario, Albania must also surpass Croatia in terms of overall goal difference, overall goals scored, disciplinary points, or European Qualifiers rankings. A loss or a draw, combined with a Croatian victory over Italy, will spell the end of Albania's round of 16 hopes.Croatia's round of 16 qualification as group runners-up requires a win against Italy, provided that Albania fails to beat Spain. If both Croatia and Albania emerge victorious, the tie-breaker for second and third place will be determined by the aforementioned criteria. A loss or a draw, combined with Albania avoiding defeat, will eliminate Croatia from contention for the round of 16.The upcoming matches on 25 June will determine the fate of the teams in Group C. England will face Slovenia, while Denmark will take on Serbia.England's path to the round of 16 is straightforward. They can secure their spot by avoiding a loss against Slovenia or if Denmark fails to defeat Serbia. To clinch the top spot in the group, England needs to triumph over Slovenia, or they can settle for a draw if Denmark doesn't win. In the event of a draw for England and a victory for Denmark, the tie for first and second place will be resolved based on overall goal difference, followed by overall goals scored, disciplinary points, and lastly, European Qualifiers rankings. Regardless of the outcome, England is guaranteed to finish no lower than third.Denmark's advancement to the round of 16 hinges on their ability to overcome Serbia. If both Denmark and Slovenia draw their respective matches, the criteria mentioned above will be used to determine the second and third positions. The same applies to the first and second spots if both Denmark and Slovenia win, or if Denmark wins and England draws. In the case of both Denmark and Slovenia losing, they will be ranked third and fourth accordingly. However, if Denmark loses and Slovenia manages to avoid defeat, Denmark will be eliminated from contention for the round of 16.Slovenia's path to the round of 16 involves defeating England. If they succeed and Denmark fails to win, Slovenia will emerge as the group winner. Should both Slovenia and Denmark win, the aforementioned criteria will be employed to decide the first and second places. Similarly, if both teams draw, they will be ranked second and third. In the event of both teams losing, they will occupy the third and fourth positions. If Slovenia loses and Serbia draws, Slovenia and Serbia will compete for the third or fourth spot.Serbia's chances of reaching the round of 16 depend on beating Denmark and Slovenia not defeating England. If both Serbia and Slovenia win, Serbia will secure the third position behind England based on their head-to-head record. A draw for Serbia and a loss for Slovenia will result in the two teams being ranked third and fourth according to the established criteria. However, Serbia will be eliminated from the round of 16 if they lose or if they draw and Slovenia avoids defeat.On June 25th, the Netherlands, who currently have 4 points, will face Austria, who have 3 points.Meanwhile, France, also with 4 points, will take on Poland, who have yet to secure any points.The Netherlands can secure a spot in the round of 16 by avoiding a loss against Austria. They can clinch the top spot in the group if they win and France fails to do so, or if they draw and France loses. A draw coupled with a French victory would place the Netherlands in second. If both the Netherlands and France win or draw, the tie-breaker for first place will be determined by overall goal difference, followed by goals scored, disciplinary points, and finally, European Qualifiers rankings. The same criteria apply if both teams lose, but for second and third place instead.France will progress to the round of 16 if they avoid a loss to Poland or if Austria fails to defeat the Netherlands. They will secure the top spot in the group with a win, provided the Netherlands do not also win. The tie-breaking criteria mentioned above will be used to determine first and second place if France and the Netherlands both win or draw, and second and third place if they both lose.Austria's path to the round of 16 requires a victory over the Netherlands. They can win the group if they triumph and France does not. A draw for Austria coupled with a French loss would see Austria finish third behind France based on their head-to-head record.Poland, unfortunately, has no chance of reaching the round of 16 and will end up in fourth place.On June 26th, Slovakia and Romania , both with 3 points, will face off, while Ukraine , also with 3 points, will take on Belgium, who have the same number of points.Romania will secure a spot in the top two and advance to the round of 16 if they avoid a loss to Slovakia. They can win the group if they emerge victorious and Belgium fails to beat Ukraine. However, a loss for Romania combined with Ukraine avoiding defeat would eliminate Romania from contention for the round of 16.Belgium's path to the round of 16 and a top-two finish requires them to avoid a loss to Ukraine. They can clinch the top spot in the group with a win, provided Slovakia does not beat Romania. A loss for Belgium coupled with Romania avoiding defeat would end Belgium's hopes of reaching the round of 16.Slovakia will progress to the round of 16 and finish in the top two if they defeat Romania. A draw would see them finish third. Slovakia can secure the top spot in the group if they win and Ukraine fails to beat Belgium. However, a loss for Slovakia combined with Belgium avoiding defeat would eliminate Slovakia from contention for the round of 16.Ukraine's route to the round of 16 and a top-two finish involves beating Belgium. They can clinch the top spot if they win and Romania does not beat Slovakia. A draw for Ukraine would result in a third-place finish, provided the other game does not end in a draw. A loss for Ukraine combined with Slovakia avoiding defeat would end Ukraine's hopes of reaching the round of 16.If both matches end in draws, all four teams will be tied on 4 points, leading to the following scenarios:A) If the draws have identical scorelines or if Belgium vs Ukraine has fewer goals than Slovakia vs Romania, the group ranking would be determined by goal difference and goals scored, resulting in:1) Romania2) Belgium3) Slovakia4) UkraineB: If the draws have different scorelines, the following scenarios are anticipated:A 1-1 draw in Belgium vs Ukraine and a 0-0 draw in Slovakia vs Romania, or any pair of results where Belgium scores exactly one more goal than Romania in their draw, would see Belgium and Romania occupy the top two spots but be equal on goal difference and goals scored. In this case, the head-to-head criteria would be reapplied exclusively to these two teams, placing Belgium ahead of Romania due to their direct match victory. Slovakia would finish third and Ukraine fourth based on goal difference.In all other scenarios, Romania and Belgium would secure the top two spots, separated by goals scored. Belgium will win the group if they score two or more goals than Romania in their draw, while Romania would win the group if they score more goals than Belgium in their draw. Slovakia would finish ahead of Ukraine in third place based on goal difference.In all of these scenarios, the situations outlined in articles 20.02 (penalty kicks in case of perfect equality), 20.01g, and 20.01h (disciplinary points and European Qualifiers rankings) of the competition regulations would not apply.26 June: Georgia (1) vs Portugal (6), Czechia (1) vs Türkiye (3)Portugal have secured their spot in the round of 16 as the winners of the group.Türkiye's advancement to the round of 16 as the group runners-up depends on their performance against Czechia. A draw or a win will guarantee their progression, while a loss combined with a Georgia victory over Portugal will eliminate them.Czechia's path to the round of 16 as the group runners-up involves a victory against Türkiye and a Portugal win or draw against Georgia. If both Czechia and Georgia win, the tie-breaker for second and third place will be determined by overall goal difference, overall goals scored, disciplinary points, and European Qualifiers rankings, in that order. A draw will suffice for Czechia to finish third, provided Georgia do not win. A loss will end Czechia's chances of reaching the round of 16.Georgia's only hope of advancing to the round of 16 as the group runners-up is by defeating Portugal while Czechia simultaneously beats Türkiye, and Georgia finishes ahead of Czechia based on the aforementioned tie-breaking criteria. A loss or a draw, coupled with Czechia avoiding defeat, will eliminate Georgia from contention for the round of 16.The round of 16 is shaping up to be an exciting phase of the tournament, with several teams still in the running to secure their spots. The final group matches will be crucial in determining the qualifiers and the matchups for the knockout stage.","The UEFA EURO 2024 group stage is progressing, with the second set of matches underway.

NEW DELHI: Italy, the defending champions, must avoid a loss against Croatia in their final group match to secure their advancement in the European Championship. Croatia can progress by winning or drawing, as long as Albania fails to defeat Spain, who have already clinched the top spot in Group B.Italy has earned three points from their 2-1 win against Albania and a narrow 1-0 loss to Spain. Croatia, with one point, suffered a 3-0 defeat to Spain and managed a 2-2 draw with Albania, who have a superior goal difference. Although a draw would be enough for Italy to advance, Luciano Spalletti's squad will strive to deliver a strong performance after being outplayed by Spain, despite the close scoreline. Gianluigi Donnarumma, Italy's goalkeeper and captain, was instrumental in preventing a more substantial loss.Croatia's team features Real Madrid midfielder Luka Modric , who has yet to find the back of the net in his fifth tournament appearance. Italy's only previous match in Leipzig resulted in a 1-0 loss to East Germany in a friendly in April 1982.

Dimarco featured in both of Italy's matches so far. Croatia will be missing midfielder Nikola Vlacic due to injury, and veteran defender Domagoj Vida missed training with an ankle issue.Italy has struggled against Croatia historically, with only one victory in their past nine encounters.

"Craving for opportunities, Soosairaj cannot wait to prove his worth in I-League",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/craving-for-opportunities-soosairaj-cannot-wait-to-prove-his-worth-in-i-league/articleshow/111225905.cms,"CHENNAI: In his prime, winger Michael Soosairaj used to send shivers down the spine of opposition defenders. The Tamil Nadu player was a constant menace down the flanks besides being a goal source. His artistry and industry in the final third of the field earned him many admirers, including former India head coach Igor Stimac.But Soosairaj has seen his stocks fall in recent years and is now somewhat of a forgotten man, having made only eight appearances across the last four Indian Super League seasons. The 29-year-old’s career has been blighted by severe injuries, most notably the ACL tear at the start of the 2020-21 season, when he plied his trade at Mohun Bagan.After spending plenty of time on the sidelines and warming the bench for long periods in the past few years, a determined Soosairaj is craving for an opportunity to “prove” his worth again. In a bid to gain game time on his comeback trail, the winger has dropped to the second tier – I-League – by inking a deal with former champions Gokulam Kerala FC .“Last season, I was hardly injured. I do not know why I did not get chances at Odisha FC. I attended the pre-season camp and trained well with the team throughout the season. I missed only about four or five sessions because of a groin injury. Maybe, I did not fit into head coach Sergio Lobera’s style,” Soosairaj told TOI on Sunday.“Two ISL clubs showed interest to sign me for the upcoming season and asked if I could attend their trials. It will not look good if I attend trials at this stage of my career. So, I decided to play in the I-League. I want to prove myself in the I-League and then get back to the ISL,” Soosairaj said.“I am motivated to show my best version. I just want to show everyone that I can play well; that is what many are expecting from me. They want to see my best, just like how well I played for Jamshedpur FC and ATK (now-defunct club) in the ISL. That is the only thought running in my mind. It has been four years since I had a full season. I need chances to show how good I am. Without getting game time, it is extremely difficult.”Asked why he chose Gokulam as his new home, Soosairaj replied: “To be honest, I had offers from other I-League clubs. Gokulam have a good setup, they have been signing good players. Their goal is to get promoted to the ISL (by winning the I-League). That is why I joined them. I just want to contribute to achieve the goal. It will be nice if I do it.”","Michael Soosairaj has joined I-League side Gokulam Kerala FC.

What percentage of the points do you think I won in those matches?""The answer, a mere 54%, highlighted a profound truth – even at the pinnacle of success, one faces numerous setbacks and losses along the way.Federer emphasized that in any endeavour, be it sports, career, or personal pursuits, losses are inevitable. He encouraged the graduates to embrace this reality and persevere through adversity.""In other words, even top-ranked tennis players win barely more than half of the points they play. The truth is, whatever game you play in life, sometimes you're going to lose.
