Travis Kelce: Jason Kelce Calls Out Brother Travis Kelce and Patrick Mahomes for Benefiting From 'Bad Call',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/jason-kelce-calls-out-brother-travis-kelce-and-patrick-mahomes-for-benefiting-from-bad-call/articleshow/117467556.cms,"John Angelillo/UPI/Shutterstock

Jason Kelce Calls Out Questionable Refereeing



Flipping the Playoff Switch, Fixing the CFP, Why We Love Snow Games & Hobby Horsing Around | Ep 121

""Can I comment on it, though, right? Of course. I think the second one was completely, just like, absolutley ridiculous, right? I mean he didn't even get touched. I don't know. They just missed it.""

Patrick Mahomes Admits to Sideline ‘Flop’



""I would say that the only one I felt like I probably did too much was the one on the sideline where I didn’t get a flag, and the ref saw it and didn’t throw a flag. And I understood it immediately and know that I probably shouldn’t have done that.""

Travis and Jason’s Playful Debate



“I could see what they saw, but it wasn’t really that much contact. In slow motion, it looked like nothing. It was a bad call.”

The Bigger Picture



The NFL playoffs always bring the drama, and this year’s divisional round clash between the Kansas City Chiefs and Houston Texans was no exception. But it wasn’t just the action on the field making waves—it was the controversial calls that had fans and players talking. Jason Kelce , former NFL center and brother of Chiefs star Travis Kelce , didn’t hold back his thoughts on one call that left viewers scratching their heads.During their podcast New Heights (Ep. 121), Jason Kelce shared his unfiltered opinion on a roughing-the-passer call that seemed to benefit Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes . Jason didn’t mince words:Even when Travis chimed in to defend the call, saying Mahomes was indeed touched, Jason stood firm, calling the contact minimal and the decision by referees overly harsh. This shows the healthy bond the kelce brothers share because all this was happening in a healthy discussion. (Us siblings, could never)While the Texans faced penalties for questionable hits, one play involving Mahomes himself added fuel to the fire. Late in the game, Mahomes scrambled toward the sideline and exaggerated contact by flailing his arms—a clear attempt to draw a flag.The refs didn’t bite, and Mahomes later owned up to his theatrics:The Kelce brothers didn’t shy away from discussing the incident, offering both sides of the debate. While Travis felt Mahomes was indeed touched, Jason argued that the call didn’t warrant a penalty:The incident has sparked broader conversations about NFL officiating and the fine line between protecting quarterbacks and letting the game flow naturally. The Chiefs ultimately secured a win, but the debate around these calls will likely linger into the postseason.For now, fans can count on the Kelce brothers to keep the conversation fun and fiery, with their podcast remaining a must-listen for football enthusiasts.Also read - NFL Vet John Spytek Joins Raiders as GM: What’s His Connection with Tom Brady?","The NFL playoffs always bring the drama, and this year’s divisional round clash between the Kansas City Chiefs and Houston Texans was no exception.

Kendrick Lamar’s Performance At The Super Bowl LIX And The Controversy Surrounding His Hit Song



Why Kendrick Has To Perform Not Like Us at the Super Bowl

Fans Continue To Speculate About Kendrick Lamar’s Performance At Super Bowl LIX



The Super Bowl LIX is just two weeks away from us and tensions are on the rise. As teams gear up to win the AFC and NFC Championship games this weekend, fans are also excited about watching famous rapper Kendrick Lamar perform. This is his second Super Bowl performance after performing three years back. But this time, Kendrick is surrounded by a few controversies around his hit track, “Not Like Us”.In the last few months, after Kendrick had announced that he would be performing in Super Bowl LIX, back in September, fans had only one question in mind - will he be performing “Not Like Us”? Now, according to a report by Jason Jones of The Athletic, there is a high chance that Kendrick Lamar will perform his hit song.“Not Like Us” by Kendrick Lamar continues to be one of the most popular songs of his career but the track had a journey of its own and also attracted some controversy. This track was a diss track aimed towards famous rapper Drake. Both the rappers have been engaged in a feud since 2013 but the release of this diss track led Drake to file a complaint against the Universal Music Group and Spotify. According to New York Times, the complaint was filed by Drake for ""promoting a song with punchlines involving accusations of pedophilia.”However, Jason Jones of The Athletic believes that the complaint by Drake will not stop famous rapper Kendrick Lamar from performing this song on stage at the Super Bowl LIX.Jason Jones from The Athletic believes even though Kendrick Lamar does not have a problem with performing the song at Super Bowl LIX, there are chances that the NFL management might play it safe and not allow him to perform this track.While nothing has been confirmed yet either by the NFL management or by the famous rapper Kendrick Lamar and his team, this remains a topic of interest as fans continue to speculate.A fan wrote on X, “Kendrick Lamar you know what to do, we wanna hear Not Like Us at the Super Bowl”, while another fan wrote, “Really don’t think Kendrick Lamar will perform Not Like Us at the Super Bowl.”While it is not known for sure if Kendrick will be performing this track, fans are pretty excited to watch him at the Super Bow LIX. Back in 2022 when he performed at the Super Bowl, he was joined by Eminem, Snoop Dog, Dr. Dre and more such artists. There are strong speculations that this time Kendrick Lamar will be joined by SZA, Travis Scott, Future and Lil’ Wayne.Super Bowl remains as one of the most watched events of the world and with the feud between Kendrick and Drake, things are only getting more exciting for the fans.Also Read: Super Bowl LIX to be streamed for free on Fox’s Tubi, making history in NFL broadcasting","The Super Bowl LIX is just two weeks away from us and tensions are on the rise.

Kershaw Future In Baseball: Los Angeles Dodgers GM Brandon Gomes Drops a Shocking Update About Clayton Kershaw’s Future—You Won’t Believe It,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/los-angeles-dodgers-gm-brandon-gomes-drops-a-shocking-update-about-clayton-kershaws-futureyou-wont-believe-it/articleshow/117498022.cms,"USA TODAY Sports

The Season That Tested Kershaw



Gomes' Shocking Commitment



“GM Brandon Gomes said Dodgers additions this offseason have not changed team's interest in re-signing Clayton Kershaw when he is ready. After foot and knee surgeries, Gomes said Kershaw is progressing in his throwing program but has not thrown off a mound yet"" said Bill Plunkett”

A Dodgers Lifelong Icon?



Dodgers fans, get ready! General Manager Brandon Gomes has shared an important update about Clayton Kershaw ’s future, and it’s something you’ll want to know. After a tough 2024 season filled with injuries and surgeries, things looked uncertain for Kershaw. However, Gomes’ recent comments reveal what could be next for the star pitcher, and it’s sure to catch your attention.It wasn't exactly smooth sailing in 2024 for Clayton Kershaw. The legendary lefty was struggling with a bone spur in his big toe and a torn meniscus in his left knee—the latter necessitating surgery, forcing him to sit for much of the season. He was good for just seven starts, leading one to wonder whether this would indeed be his last ride in LA.However, with the season's end came more than the injuries themselves: His contract had expired, making him a free agent, and the uncertainty was palpable. But the Dodgers were surely not ready to write the final chapter on their vaunted veteran ace.Here's where things get interesting: despite Kershaw's struggles with injuries, Brandon Gomes made it perfectly clear that the Dodgers are totally committed to bringing him back. Speaking recently, Gomes made it known that even the offseason moves haven't shifted the team's desire to retain Kershaw in Dodger blue.Yes, you read that right—the Dodgers aren't just interested; they're waiting for Kershaw to be ready. That's a bold move for a team navigating an intense offseason.So, where is Kershaw now? Gomes said he continues to make progress in his throwing program but hasn't thrown off the mound. Some might be expecting a little urgency, but both the Dodgers and Kershaw seem quite comfortable taking it slow.This is the ultimate long game. Gomes' words speak to how much respect he has for Kershaw's recovery and his confidence in Kershaw's ability to bounce back at the right time.Drafted by the Dodgers in the first round of 2006, Clayton Kershaw has been the heart of the franchise. In case he signs, he'll be joining an elite class of players who have spent their careers with just one team, and that's quite a feat for any player. The relationship between Kershaw and the Dodgers is quite close, with both parties having great interest in finding a new contract.The wait for the actual contract signing does not look very long since there is sure confidence that Kershaw will come back. Even the fans seem to get it right since a chance of retiring as a Dodger with him is already sufficient to keep one excited.Stay tuned, this story is a long way from over, and Kershaw's comeback is one for the ages!Also Read: Katia Lindor, Pregnant Wife of Francisco Lindor, Shares Honest Motherhood Journey and Gets Heartfelt Praise from Irmarie Baez, Wife of Javier Baez!","Dodgers General Manager Brandon Gomes has shared an important update about Clayton Kershaw ’s future.

Denver Nuggets star

Nikola Jokic

NUGGETS at MAGIC | FULL GAME HIGHLIGHTS | January 19, 2025

When and where to watch the Sacramento Kings vs Denver Nuggets game tonight (January 23, 2025)?

is available to play in tonight’s game against the Sacramento Kings. Jokic has been pivotal to the Nuggets’ success this season participating in 37 of their 43 games. He is also in stellar form averaging 30.1 points, 13.2 rebounds, and 9.9 assists per game while shooting 56.3% from the field. It is worth noting that Jokic is 0.1 assists away from averaging a 30-point triple-double for his team.Jokic has refused to slow down despite leading the Nuggets to the NBA Championship in 2023. With him in this kind of form, there’s not much the Kings can do to hold Denver back. However, it is worth mentioning that Nikola Jokic’s stats take quite a dip against the Kings. He has played 30 regular season games against them and averages 19.5 points, 10.9 rebounds, and 7.6 assists per game.If Nikola Jokic isn’t his usual self the team will likely look towards Jamal Murray to have a bigger impact on offense. At the time of writing, Murray is averaging 19.8 points, 4.0 rebounds, and 6.0 assists per game. He also shoots over 45% from the field and can lead the team in the absence of Jokic. While the Joker is undoubtedly the Nuggets’ best player, the team wouldn’t have found as much success as they have without Jamal Murray.Michael Porter Jr. will be another player to keep an eye on tonight. The 26-year-old is slowly finding his rhythm and is recording 18.2 points, 6.5 rebounds, and 2.3 assists per game. Together, these three are the Nuggets’ most important players and form one of the deadliest and most consistent trios in the NBA. While Jokic, Murray, and Porter will be available, the team will have to adjust for the absence of Vlatko Cancar and DaRon Holmes II. A win tonight will bring the Nuggets one step closer to the third seed in the West. If Nikola Jokic leads the Nuggets to another top-three finish he will make a serious case for another MVP award.ALSO READ: Chicago Bulls vs Golden State Warriors (01/23): Starting five, injury report, start time, game prediction, betting tips, how to watch, and more The Sacramento Kings will visit the Ball Arena to take on the Denver Nuggets tonight.

Tyreek Hill calls out Rick Ross for trying to take advantage of his suffering during a house fire.Wide receiver Tyreek Hill, who suffered a house fire and was eliminated from the Miami Dolphins' playoff chances, has been considering leaving the team for next season due to his controversial post-game comments, which have been criticized for taking advantage of his suffering.The famous 'Cheetah', Tyreek Hill has said that he is not interested in continuing to play for the Dolphins after a series of cryptic comments. His comments after the game at MetLife Stadium broke the camel's back, revealing his decision to leave the team.Hill said, ""I'm opening the door. I'm leaving, man. It was great to play here, but at the end of the day I have to do what's best for my career. I'm too competitive to be out there.”An NFL executive believes Hill may already have a team interested in signing him, but his previous statement to ESPN's Jeremy Fowler may not be the best principle. ""The Patriots are desperate. They need a guy, that alpha who can be friendly to Drake Maye (...) and there's a greater likelihood that the draft picks [Miami would receive in a trade] will be higher than with a contender.”The New England Patriots are being associated with a number of high-profile offseason moves, mostly wide receiver additions. Tee Higgins is the most commonly associated name, but there are many others to consider. New England is being considered as a potential trade suitor for Tyreek Hill, a highly anticipated addition to the Patriots' offense, despite the surprise of such a trade within the AFC East division.Drake Maye is a superstar quarterback with a lot of potential but requires more weapons to grow. Hill is a big-threat playmaker, and the missing piece for the New England offense. He had a down season in 2024 and was frustrated and has led to trade rumors, as he could be the missing piece to the puzzle. The potential of Hill is huge for Maye's growth and the New England offense.Also Read: “100% a conflict of interest”: WFAN hosts Boomer Esiason and Gregg Giannotti shared their perspective on Tom Brady's situation with FOX and Raiders The Patriots should consider Hill as a potential target, especially if they miss Higgins, their top wide receiver. Hill would be a best-case scenario for New England if they don't find Higgins. The Patriots make sense as a Hill suitor, and it's worth watching if New England decides to pursue a trade for him.","Tyreek Hill could join the New England Patriots.

Josh Allen’s Heartfelt Answer To Hailee Steinfeld’s Question Was Unexpected



Hailee Steinfeld Will Be Present At The AFC Championship Game



The Buffalo Bills have performed extremely well this season and are all set to meet the Kansas City Chiefs at the AFC Championship this weekend. Away from the field, Buffalo Bills; star player Josh Allen and his fiancee, famous Hollywood actress Hailee Steinfeld remain as the most popular couple in the NFL currently. A month ago, Hailee asked her fiance, Josh Allen, a few questions about his feelings for her and their proposal, as a part of the Q&A for the 17th issue of her “Beau Society” newsletter. One of the questions that Hailee asked Josh was about the “last fun thing that he did” and his heartwarming answer had fans raving for days.Out of all the proposal related questions that Hailee asked her fiance, Josh, one of the questions was, “What was the last fun thing that you did?” To this, the NFL star, Josh spoke about his proposal. He said, “Got on a knee for my girlfriend who is now my fiancee”. Josh’s answer was quite unexpected since Hailee did not ask him anything directly about their proposal.A fan commented about Josh’s answer and wrote, “This is so sweet!!” while another fan commented on the love and respect they have for each other and wrote, “In the words of Phoebe from Friends "" you found your lobster"".❤️”Beau Society is a project of Hailee’s that is pretty close to her heart which she started back in August 2024. Through Beau Society, Hailee issues newsletters weekly through which fans get to see a more real side of hers, away from the world of glamour.The last few newsletters of Hailee’s Beau Society have centred around pieces of life advice and stories from the holiday season. Last week due to the Los Angeles wildfires, Hailee had not issued a newsletter to respect the situation and instead shared resources to help the victims who were stuck in the Los Angeles wildfires.Hailee and Josh initially remained pretty private about their relationship and their love for each other. But after Josh proposed to her in November last year, it seems like the couple has gotten comfortable with making their relationship public.Recently, as Josh’s team, the Buffalo Bills defeated the Denver Broncos, Hailee Steinfeld was spotted cheering him on as she wore a customised Buffalo Bills outfit. She is also expected to attend the AFC Championship this weekend.Hailee has also been spotted in and around Buffalo quite a lot and it might just be that she has moved to Buffalo at least temporarily. The couple has not confirmed their wedding dates yet but as per reports, it might be happening this year.Josh was previously in a long term relationship with a woman he had met when he was a child. But the relationship did not work out and both he and his ex girlfriend have moved on. His ex girlfriend was in the news recently after she posted about Josh being ""braindead"" after his proposal to Hailee but she quickly deleted the post and highlighted that her account had been hacked.Josh and Hailee have not commented about this yet.Also Read: Taylor Swift leaves Travis Kelce behind and boards private flight, sparking rumors of a new album release soon","Buffalo Bills star player Josh Allen and his fiancee, Hailee Steinfeld remain as the most popular couple in the NFL currently.

He described himself as ""absolutely gutted by what happened"" and shared his regret over the missed opportunity.The drop occurred during a pivotal two-point conversion attempt late in the fourth quarter. As Andrews fell backward in the end zone, a pass slipped through his hands, preventing the Ravens from tying the game with just 1:33 left on the clock. The moment has drawn significant criticism on social media, but Andrews remains focused on moving forward.""Even though the shock and disappointment are unlike anything I've felt before, I refuse to let the situation define me,"" Andrews wrote on Instagram on Thursday.

Jayden Daniels: The Rookie Drawing Patrick Mahomes Comparisons



Jayden Daniels has taken the NFL by storm, leading the Washington Commanders to the NFC Championship Game in his rookie season. The 24-year-old quarterback from LSU has rewritten franchise records and etched his name into NFL history with stellar performances. Daniels' ability to shine in clutch moments and elevate his team has made him one of the most exciting young talents in the league, and the comparisons to Patrick Mahomes have only amplified his meteoric rise.Jayden Daniels’ achievements in his first season are nothing short of extraordinary. With 25 touchdown passes and fewer than 10 interceptions, he became the first player in Commanders' history to accomplish this feat. Additionally, his 891 rushing yards are the highest ever recorded by a rookie quarterback in NFL history. These numbers alone showcase his dual-threat capabilities and why he’s become an essential part of the Commanders' success in 2024.Winning the prestigious Heisman Trophy in college was a precursor to Daniels' remarkable transition to the NFL. His consistency and playmaking ability have turned the Commanders into a formidable force, helping them emerge as one of the breakout teams of the season. Daniels remains humble amid the growing buzz around him, stating that he is ""not even thinking that far"" about the possibility of reaching the Super Bowl.The NFL world has taken notice of Daniels’ incredible season, with Colin Cowherd boldly comparing him to Patrick Mahomes. Cowherd believes that Daniels has the potential to dominate the NFC the way Mahomes has done in the AFC, saying, “I really believe that Jayden Daniels is the Mahomes of the NFC, that the pecking order will start with him starting next year. I really believe that. I don’t think it’s a reach. I don’t think it’s hyperbolic. I think he’s the Mahomes, that from this point forward, people will slot behind him. The Herd.”While such comparisons are rare and carry immense weight, Daniels’ rookie season provides enough evidence to consider it plausible. His leadership, combined with his ability to deliver under pressure, mirrors Mahomes' early years with the Kansas City Chiefs. However, the path to sustaining such success is challenging. Players like Caleb Williams and Jalen Hurts are contenders for the top quarterback spot in the NFC, while history shows that second-year performances don’t always live up to breakout rookie campaigns, as seen with C.J. Stroud.As Daniels prepares to lead the Commanders against the Philadelphia Eagles in the NFC Championship Game, the stakes have never been higher. A win would not only secure a trip to Super Bowl 59 but also further solidify Cowherd’s lofty comparison. However, it’s important to remember that Daniels is still a rookie, and drawing parallels to Mahomes at this stage might be premature.Also Read: Super Bowl LIX Halftime Show: Kendrick Lamar Announces SZA as Special Guest Yet, there’s no denying Daniels’ potential. If he can guide the Commanders to a historic Super Bowl victory, the comparisons to Mahomes will no longer seem far-fetched—they’ll be a testament to a career that could define the next generation of NFL quarterbacks.","Jayden Daniels has taken the NFL by storm, leading the Washington Commanders to the NFC Championship Game in his rookie season.

Former defensive mid-fielder Paul Lambert, who was a key figure in Borussia Dortmund’s CL triumph in the 1996-97 season, spoke about what Rodri brings to the table.“Losing Rodri was definitely a blow as he plays in a specialised position. Rodri played a massive role in City’s success last season and was rewarded with the Ballon d’Or,” Lambert said on the sideline of the Murugap-pa Youth Academy (MYFA) training on Thursday.Lambert further mentioned that many have been very critical of Guardiola, and he feels that it should not be the case. “In the last seven years or so, City under Pep have been incredible. While City are having a tough time, I do not think anybody can be really too critical.”Lambert had a huge role to play for Dortmund in his short one-year spell. The Scotsman was instrumental in keeping Zinedine Zidane quiet in the CL final against Juventus. After several years, when Zidane met Lambert, he said, “Paul Lambert. Ah, bloody hell”. Such was the influence that Lambert had in the title decider.",Manchester City have been without defensive midfielder Rodri.

Money matters threaten to derail MSC’s ISL campaign,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/money-matters-threaten-to-derail-mscs-isl-campaign/articleshow/117504122.cms,"KOLKATA: Imagine the scenario. A worried Mohammedan SC coach Andrey Chernyshov is standing in the middle of the Salt Lake Stadium practice ground, in deep discussion with club football secretary Dipendu Biswas .Not far, assistant coach Mehrajuddin Wadoo is talking on his cellphone. And inside the dressing room, club officials are busy trying to convince the players to come out the middle for training. In three days’ time, they are scheduled to play Mumbai City FC . But they have to make the journey first.This, in a nutshell, was the Indian Super League debutants’ first home training session on Thursday, eight days after holding Chennaiyin FC 2-2 in the league. Chernyshov’s boys are going through perhaps the best phase in their first season. They may be placed last in the table now but are unbeaten in their past four matches.Off the field, however, they are staring at a crisis, with the players threatening to boycott training reportedly over unpaid wages and forcing the club officials to step in to avoid a potential dressingroom revolt twice in the past 10 days. Ahead of the match against Chennaiyin FC on Jan 15 too, club officials had to coax the players to take the field. At the heart of this apparent player unrest lies a tug-of-war between the club and its investors Bunkerhill and Shrachi Sports over transfer of shares.Gurugram-based Bunkerhill, which invested heavily in the club since 2020 and played akey role in the team’s promotion to the ISL , owns 61% stake in Mohammedan Sporting Club Pvt Ltd. Bunkerhill is supposed to hand over 50% of its shares to Shrachi, which joined the company as an investor in Aug last year.It has been understood that Bunkerhill has sent a notice asking the club to transfer this 61% share (apparently promised as per the agreement) by the end of this month, threatening to suspend further funding otherwise. Shrachi, claiming to be “caught in a crossfire” between the club and Bunkerhill, has also stopped its funding in the company.This financial turmoil has left the players in a limbo — with some players reportedly claiming to have unpaid salary for around three months. Players of the club’s cricket team have also joined the protest, shooting off a hand-written letter to the club president alleging that they didn’t receive any payment for the ongoing season.",Mohammedan SC players threaten to boycott training over unpaid wages.

Career and personal life

Bonnie Blue , a 25-year-old OnlyFans creator from Derbyshire , claims to have set a world record by having sex with 1,057 men in 12 hours, reports Daily Mail.The event took place in London, allegedly surpassing the previous record of 919 men in 24 hours set by adult actress Lisa Sparks in 2004, with Bonnie claiming she ""bedded 1,057 in 12 hours.""In a video shared on TikTok, Bonnie thanked those who participated, saying, “Thank you to all the barely legal, barely breathing and the husbands.”She added that her skin looked better after the event and described the experience: “The room was absolutely full. We did groups of five, like one after the other. It was a rotating circle.”Her PR team confirmed the tally, stating, “She slept with 1,057 people. As she hit 1,000, there were still 57 left in the queue who Bonnie wanted to pleasure before ending the 12-hour day.” Calculations suggest she averaged 41 seconds per partner.The stunt sparked outrage online, with comments such as “How embarrassing” and “Sad that men would want to do that too—all for fame and money.” Bonnie is no stranger to controversy, having previously defended her claims of sleeping with “barely legal” 18-year-olds and encouraging men to cheat on their wives.Bonnie's real name is Tia Billinger , who says she earns up to £750,000 a month from her OnlyFans content. Despite criticism, she insists her work is educational. “I can’t think of one situation where an 18-year-old has had sex where they’ve had to bring a passport, sign consent forms, and do a breathalyser,” she said on ITV’s This Morning.She also addressed criticism for sleeping with married men, arguing, “If wives aren’t going to pleasure husbands, let them go elsewhere. It’s just an act; the husbands mean nothing to me.”Bonnie transitioned to sex work after moving to Australia in 2022 with her now ex-husband, Oliver Davidson. Formerly a recruitment professional, she launched her career as a cam girl and later joined OnlyFans.She claims her family now supports her career, with her mother even assisting her business by booking appointments and handing out condoms for marketing. “It’s changed their life completely for the better,” she said.Bonnie defended her actions, stating, “These 18-year-olds can go to the army, they can drive, they can drink… If they want to use their own bodies to come and sleep with me, that is their decision.”","Bonnie Blue, 25, claims to have had sex with 1,057 men in 12 hours.

The Duchess of Sussex , Meghan Markle has announced the passing of her beloved dog, Guy, in a heartfelt Instagram tribute, in a post on Tuesday. She shared a touching video montage of her 'sweet' companion, who was scheduled to appear in her upcoming Netflix programme.The Duchess expressed her profound grief, acknowledging countless tears shed whilst thanking her faithful pet for years of unwavering devotion.She titled the tribute ""advocating for pet adoption with a compilation of photographs and videos.""In 2015, I adopted a beagle from a dog rescue in Canada. He had been at a kill shelter in Kentucky and given a few days to live. I swooped him up….and fell in love. They referred to him as ‘the little guy’ because he was so small and frail, so I named him ‘Guy’. And he was the best guy any girl could have asked for,"" the mother-of-two said in her post.Meghan continued, ""He endured a terrible accident shortly before I moved to the UK which had him undergoing surgeries for several months and unable to leave the clinic. Doctors said he would never walk again, but Dr Noel Fitzpatrick said he could do it. He and I would drive late at night, after hours, to see Guy as he recovered in Surrey for months on end.""This marks her third Instagram post since launching her Netflix series on her new account,""If you followed me on Instagram back in the day, you saw a lot of him - and on The Tig too. He was with me at Suits, when I got engaged, (and then married), when I became a mom….he was with me for everything: the quiet, the chaos, the calm, the comfort,"" she said.""Thank you for loving him so much,"" she wrote, conveying her appreciation to Dr Noel and the team at Queen West Animal Hospital .""As many of you will see Guy in this new series, I hope you’ll understand why his loss has devastated me. I think you might fall a little in love with him too,"" she further emphasised.""I have cried too many tears to count - the type of tears that make you get in the shower with the absurd hope that the running water on your face will somehow make you not feel them, or pretend they’re not there. But they are. And that’s okay too. Thank you for so many years of unconditional love, my sweet Guy.

After 10-year wait, India skipper's first Ranji outing lasts a mere 19 balls

MUMBAI: Things seem to be going from bad to worse for Rohit Sharma , whose poor form must be of serious concern to the Ajit-Agarkar-headed national selection committee, which has named him India's captain for the home ODI series against England and the Champions Trophy next month.Rohit's return to the Ranji Trophy after nearly a decade lasted barely for half an hour as he was dismissed after mistiming a pull off Jammu & Kashmir pacer Umar Nazir at the Mumbai Cricket Association 's Sharad Pawar Academy in BKC, after managing to score only three runs off 19 balls on the morning of Day One.It was another poor outing for the out-of-form 37-year-old whose desperate search to rediscover his form must now await the second innings.After scratching around, during which the impressive Nazir repeatedly beat him and even struck him on the glove once on a pitch where the ball was moving around, India's ODI & Test captain perished to a horrible shot in the sixth over.Attempting a pull off a harmless, slightly short ball pitched outside the off-stump, he only managed a leading edge that J&K captain Paras Dogra easily caught at mid-off.This is third time this season that Rohit has been dismissed in this fashion. New Zealand fast bowler Matt Henry (at the Wankhede in Mumbai) and Pat Cummins (at the MCG in Melbourne) have dismissed the ageing star in a similar fashion.To accommodate Rohit and the other India stars for this match, Mumbai had to drop their season's success story, opener Ayush Mhatre (408 runs in 5 matches, with two centuries in his debut Ranji season).Rohit has been in the midst of a horror run with the bat, spread across the home Test series against New Zealand, and the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia.","After 10-year wait, India skipper's first Ranji outing lasts a mere 19 balls.

Not very long ago, mystery spinner felt he may not be able to play for India again

IND vs ENG: Coach and captain gave complete freedom, says Abhishek Sharma

CHENNAI: Ravichandran Ashwin said a few days ago on his YouTube channel that the ongoing T20I series would be a ""crucial battle between England and Varun Chakravarthy "".""The result will be based on how England tackle Varun. If they struggle while facing Varun and Ravi Bishnoi, the game is done. If they encounter Varun well, the series will be tight,"" Ashwin opined. The veteran spinner's assessment, spot on for the time being considering the way the first fixture in Kolkata panned out, reflects how Varun's T20 stocks have risen.After a superb series in South Africa, Varun once again was in the thick of things, with a match-winning 3-23 at Eden Gardens. As the England batters failed to pick him time and time again, the conversation started whether India had missed a trick by not including him in the Champions Trophy squad. Many felt that he could have come in place of one of the three finger-spinners in the 15. With his wicket-taking ability, Varun, in tandem with Kuldeep Yadav, would be an asset in Dubai.Former national selector Devang Gandhi, though, feels that Varun still has some way to go before he finds a place in the Indian ODI set-up. ""Varun has to keep working hard if he aspires to play 50-over cricket. I am sure that he has the quality to get there, but having said that, the selectors have picked the best possible 15. In the long run, if he keeps doing well, he can be an asset for the team,"" Gandhi told TOI. While there is no questioning his talent with the ball, fielding could be an area of concern for Varun and in 50-over cricket, it can become a factor on bigger grounds.But the story is different in T20 cricket. For someone who returned to the India T20I fold only three months ago - after a near three-year absence - the 33-year-old has quickly turned himself into a nailed-on starter and made people take notice despite being surrounded by multiple game-changers. The journey to become the enviable spin force he is today began a few years ago, when Varun asked his personal coach AC Prathiban : ""Do you think that I can play for India again?""""After the 2021 T20 WC, I analysed my bowling. What I found was that I was bowling more side-spin. I was not able to beat the batters through side-spin. I worked out that I have to beat the batters only through bounce, so I worked on my over-spin. That has been working till now,"" Varun said in Kolkata on Wednesday.While the slow bowler has made key technical adjustments before coming back as 'Varun 2.0', he has also been consciously working on tactics and the mental side of things with Prathiban.""The rise of Varun has happened because of his calmness. Earlier, he used to think a lot on what had to be done. He had a lot on his mind. I tried to calm him down, he can be calmer when he is at the top of his run-up. He has many variations which he can bowl really well. So during a process, we minimised the types of balls he bowls. That has given him a lot of clarity and confidence,"" Prathiban, a former Tamil Nadu off-spinner, told TOI.""Before series or tournaments, we look at different batters and work out how Varun should bowl against them… what lengths he should bowl against each one of them and what is the sequence of balls. We try to eliminate extra pressure as we do not know what the batters are going to do. We just work on the controllables,"" added Prathiban.Varun's accuracy, consistency and wicket-taking ability are seen as his biggest strengths. ""He is pretty accurate with his lines, so different modes of dismissal come into the equation. When he is attacking the stumps, a batter can be bowled, stumped or dismissed LBW,"" said TN bowling coach Guru Kedarnath recently.""When you can bowl both off-spin and leg-spin, you need to have good control. Varun has it. Besides that, he has the knack of picking up wickets. He is a genuine wicket-taker and can win games outright for his team,"" said Prathiban.Up next is a 'home game' for Varun at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Saturday and the fans would love another match-winning performance from the Chennai man, on a pitch which should assist him.","Varun Chakravarthy returned to the India T20I fold only three months ago.

Adjustment pangs

Conditions enable hosts to push for outright wins

'Neutral' curators under scanner

NEW DELHI: The red ball continues to haunt India's top Test players. Following a torrid Test season, Rohit Sharma Shubman Gill and Rishabh Pant managed to score a combined 12 runs and lasted a total of just 45 balls for their respective state teams on the first day of the Ranji Trophy 's second leg on Thursday. Ravindra Jadeja was the only one who had a good day, taking 5/66 and scoring a quickfire 38 off 36 balls for Saurashtra against Delhi in Rajkot.Concerns about batting form were flagged after India lost the Sydney Test in the first week of the year, prompting these international stars to take the field in domestic cricket inside three weeks after a hectic 10-Test season. While Yashashvi Jaiswal and Rishabh Pant scored four and one for Mumbai and Delhi respectively, the national selectors will be particularly worried about Rohit and Gill's ordeals against the new ball.Rohit could manage just three off 19 balls before he fell tamely to J&K's Umar Nazir in Mumbai. Gill scored four while opening for Punjab against Karnataka in Bengaluru.The Indian cricket board (BCCI) has identified international cricketers' reluctance to play domestic cricket as one of the factors behind the Test team's decline over the last four months. Captain Rohit's place in the team has come under the scanner and so has Gill's ability to tackle top-quality Test bowling.More than Jaiswal and Pant - who have been India's leading scorers in the season - alarm bells will be ringing for Rohit and Gill.How the selectors perceive the performances will be interesting. Way back in 2015, India's current head coach Gautam Gambhir had told TOI about the difficulties of playing at the domestic level after having played international cricket for a long time.""It is difficult in certain ways. You face medium pacers for so much of the time after facing bowlers hurling at 140 kmph in IPL or international level. It is down to mental strength,"" Gambhir had said.Former India selector Devang Gandhi reckons the selectors will be more focused on how Rohit and Gill fare. ""International players usually play domestic cricket to find their touch or stay in form. The way Rohit got out playing a half-hearted shot could be a bit worrying. Even Gill needs runs to get his confidence back. I wouldn't worry much about Jaiswal and Pant because they have scored most runs for India of late,"" Gandhi told TOI.""Before pouncing on these players, one must also remember they are coming off an extensive Test season. It takes a lot out of you both physically and mentally. More than this Ranji match, the Duleep Trophy was an ideal preparation at the start of the season,"" Gandhi added.If one browses through the scoresheets of the Ranji matches in this round, most of the venues witnessed collapses and teams were bowled out two-thirds through the day's play. Multiple matches have seen 14 or more wickets falling on the day. This is the penultimate league round of the Ranji Trophy and history suggests home associations opt for bowler-friendly pitches to enforce outright results in order to push for a quarterfinal berth.""It has been a tradition in Ranji cricket at this point of the competition. Host associations either prepare heavily seamer-friendly pitches or rank turners. Jadeja had a good day because he was bowling on a raging turner. Even Cheteshwar Pujara got out to part-time offie Ayush Badoni. Other centres too have overtly helped either seamers or spinners. It doesn't help Indian cricket anyway,"" Gandhi said.BCCI appoints neutral curators to counter such situations. However, the move has not yet yielded results. Host associations don't face any serious sanctions while the neutral curator is hauled up in case the pitch is of poor quality.""It's tough to stick to your guns at the state associations with influential administrators. The pressure is unreal on neutral curators, who may be at the venue for a week. If the pitch is reported as poor, the curator will be answerable. BCCI has to start docking points too,"" a BCCI official said.","Rohit Sharma, Shubman Gill and Rishabh Pant score a combined 12 runs.

James Vince , the captain of the Gulf Giants, was asked to bat first and immediately tried to attack. Obed McCoy, however, handed the Dubai Capitals their first wicket at the opposite end when he hit Ibrahim Zadran for three. Jordan Cox joined Vince, who hit four boundaries in his twenty-four, and kept the Gulf Giants' scoreboard going.Vince was removed just before the powerplay ended, and Zahir Khan removed Tom Alsop for two early in the seventh over. With Gerhard Erasmus's strong backing, Cox assumed leadership from that point on.Cox and Erasmus recovered and put on a 69-run partnership to give the Giants some momentum in the last part of the innings, despite the Dubai Capitals keeping things close. However, Erasmus left for 29, and soon after, Cox reached his half-century, with Shimron Hetmyer joining him.The Dubai Capitals' bowling held Hetmyer and Cox solidly in check as they attempted to score immediately. The Gulf Giants scored a respectable 153/5 in 20 overs after Cox was run out for a solid 70 in the last over of the innings. On 17, Hetmyer was still undefeated.Ben Dunk and Shai Hope responded by getting out to a steady start and trying to lay the groundwork for the Dubai Capitals' pursuit. However, Dunk was unable to bat for very long and fell for ten, and Khalid Shah contributed ten more. Both players fell as they attempted to go long, giving the Gulf Giants a brief advantage.Following that, Gulbadin Naib joined Hope, and the two of them filled in the holes effectively, gaining a number of significant boundaries when the Dubai Capitals retaliated. Aayan Khan took his second wicket, but Gulbadin was the next to leave for 17. Captain Sikandar Raza and Hope were taken to the middle when Najibullah Zadran was unable to stay for too long and returned to the hut for seven.Together, Raza and Hope scored 33 runs, which helped to steady the ship. Together with Raza, Hope was able to lay the groundwork for the massive launch in the last overs, which was just what the Dubai Capitals needed. Dasun Shanaka began in fifth gear, and Blessing Muzarabani took Hope out for 47 before giving up 18 runs in the over.Shanaka finished the match with two sixes, a boundary, and a single in the 19th over, continuing his assault on the Gulf Giants bowling all the way through.

India successfully chased down 133 with more than seven overs remaining thanks to his quick 79 from just 34 deliveries.Abhishek celebrated reaching 50 in just 20 balls during his blitzkrieg, which was the second-fastest score by an Indian during a Twenty20 International match against England.Also See: ICC Champions Trophy 2025 Yuvraj, Abhishek's mentor, is the record holder for the fastest fifty, having reached it in just 12 deliveries in Durban in 2007. During his exploits in Manchester in 2018, KL Rahul celebrated reaching fifty in twenty-seven deliveries.The 8 sixes hit by Abhishek, are the most the most by an Indian against England in T20Is, going past the seven hit by Yuvraj Singh in Durban on September 19, 2007.On Wednesday, Abhishek scored 79 runs at Eden Gardens, with 68 of those runs being boundaries. Striking at 232.35, he hit a staggering eight maximums and five fours.After being dropped twice during the game, he was undoubtedly fortunate.

NEW DELHI: India spinner Varun Chakravarthy was still eager to get better even after he played a game-winning effort against England in the first Twenty20 International.After being left out of India's Champions Trophy squad, Chakravarthy, the local hero of Kolkata, came back to Eden Gardens to reveal his enigmatic variants against England.By cheaply dismissing the opening combination of Ben Duckett and Phil Salt in the first innings, Arshdeep Singh created the ideal environment for Chakravarthy to express himself.He had plenty of time to con the hard-hitting English middle-order by using techniques from his mystery box. Chakravarthy quickly realized that bounce, not turn, was the key to success on a surface where he has bowled numerous times.""I am used to seeing such pitches in the IPL. I know that it is for the seamers, but I know there are certain lengths which are helpful for me. What I realised was I can't beat batsmen with a side-spin. The only way I can beat the batsmen is through bounce,"" Chakravarthy said after winning the Player of the Match award.His effectiveness was also attributed to keeping the ball away from the hitting arc in addition to removing bounce from the surface. Along with Harry Brook and Liam Livingstone, Chakravarthy caught the big fish during his successful outing: England captain Jos Buttler Chakravarthy performed a counterpunch flawlessly when England threatened with a partnership between Buttler and Brook that looked promising.Livingstone followed young sensation Brook in the dressing room with a two-ball duck in the same over after Brook was initially dismissed for 17.Also See: ICC Champions Trophy Dates 2025 Only how long Buttler could stay on the crease would determine England's chances of reaching the 150-run milestone. Buttler knew he had to monitor the boundary rope as the first innings came to a head.Buttler's innings ended on 68(44) after Nitish Reddy charged in to make a wonderful catch when he attempted to draw the ball away towards deep square leg. Following the captain's dismissal, India easily overtook England, who had crawled up to 132.Chakravarthy returned with astounding figures of 3/23 from his four-over performance, with Buttler's wicket being his last wicket of the game. Despite his game-changing performance that helped India win by seven wickets, he believes more work needs to be done.""I am trying to keep it away from their arc, it was holding a bit. Every over, bowling in Eden is challenging. To bowl to batsmen like Jos and other guys is definitely challenging. The last over was very tricky and challenging, but by God's grace, I was successful. I'm still 7 on 10, still more work to do,"" he added.","India spinner Varun Chakravarthy played a game-winning effort against England in the first Twenty20 International.

He knows his game really well so, no one has to tell him what he needs to do. And Rohit knows his game really well. Once he gets in, I'm sure he will do well. He's always been relaxed, cool guy, on and off the field. He's never changed, which is a very good thing,"" Rahane told the reporters after Mumbai's training session here on Wednesday.Having himself gone through a prolonged form slump in his own long career which saw him dropped from India's Test team, Rahane is exactly aware of what Rohit is experiencing at the moment. The veteran batsman said that every player goes through ups and downs, and revealed that Rohit had a few good sessions in the Mumbai nets in the build-up to the match.""As a player, every player goes through that phase (and) that is part and parcel of any sportsman's career. What is important is (that) he is hungry, he is determined to do well. I am sure, once he gets in, he will get a big one. A player has to be confident and I feel Rohit is really confident.

Everyone can learn a lot from him.

""We're delighted to have Yashasvi back as well. He's been performing exceptionally well at the international level. Over the past couple of years, he's consistently delivered for the Indian team and earlier for Mumbai too.

No, The Team Management Made the Right Decision Yes, He Should Have Been Included

Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

NEW DELHI: Mohammed Shami 's eagerly awaited return was further postponed as the Indian bowler was left out of India's starting eleven for the opening Twenty20 International match against England because the team management didn't think he would fit in with the lineup given the Eden Gardens track's characteristics.After 14 months, everyone was expecting Shami to return to the national team, but when captain Suryakumar Yadav revealed at the toss that he would not be playing, it stoked rumors that the national selectors were not confident in his fitness. Abhishek Sharma explained after the game that the veteran bowler was benched due to the circumstances and the combinations that the team management deemed suitable.""I feel it's the decision of the team management and they thought it's a better option keeping in mind of these conditions,"" Abhishek said at the post-match press conference in Kolkata.Also See: ICC Champions Trophy 2025 The fresh look of India The T20 team is entirely Gautam Gambhir 's creation, and it has performed remarkably up to this point by concentrating on role-specific conditions rather than celebrity culture conformity.'GamBall' against 'Bazball' was the result of not choosing a bowler of Shami 's caliber, assessing the track, and selecting three specialized spinners and one frontline pacer. It's safe to assume which philosophy won.T20Is haven't been his finest suit, as evidenced by his 11-year international career, in which he played 23 of them with 24 wickets and an economy rate of almost nine runs per over.Gambhir didn't want to put a veteran who had just returned from a 14-month forced international break in a situation where Jos Buttler and company could have considered his length to be cannon fodder.Ironically, the 34-year-old pacer, who appeared to be fully recovered, bowled for about 30 minutes at the side nets, aiming for stumps, while Indian captain Suryakumar Yadav chose to bowl at the toss and declared the playing XI without him.Also See: Champions Trophy 2025 Full Schedule Shami had bowled full throttle at the India nets in every session, despite having a hefty strapping on his left knee.Although Abhishek, one of the younger players in the national team, discussed combination, it is still unclear if the senior pacer is still having issues with a swollen left knee following each demanding practice.Given that captain Suryakumar had voiced confidence in Shami's inclusion during the pre-match media conference, there didn't appear to be any serious concerns regarding his fitness.""It's always good to have an experienced bowler in your side, and he is making a comeback after over a year. I am really excited to see him. I have witnessed his journey-what he did at the NCA, how he focused on his bowling and recovery. It's great to see him fit and back in the side,"" Suryakumar said on Tuesday.Shami himself expressed his desire to make a comeback, highlighting the effort he made to demonstrate his fitness by representing Bengal in all three domestic formats, first with the Ranji Trophy , then the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20s, and ending with the Vijay Hazare Trophy.""The hunger to play for the country should never end. If you love it, you will always fight back, no matter how many injuries you face,"" Shami said at a Cricket Association of Bengal event.""No matter how many matches I play, it always feels like less. Once I leave cricket, I may never get this chance again,"" he added during CAB's felicitation ceremony for the victorious Under-15 women's cricketers at Eden Gardens on Monday.Since Sunday, when the camp started, Shami has also been bowling at full throttle after a demanding three-phase exercise that lasted more than an hour.He returned to bowling full force on the eve of the game on Tuesday without experiencing any discernible discomfort.Even though his left knee was always strapped, neither the strength and conditioning coach nor the physiotherapist needed to attend to him.There was only a faint trace of discomfort as he made his way back to the dressing room, taking slow, deliberate movements and appearing to be aware of his left leg.With star pacer Jasprit Bumrah facing a fitness cloud after suffering a back niggle during the fifth Test in Sydney, Shami's return has garnered a lot of attention in the run-up to the Champions Trophy. Ajit Agarkar , the chairman of selectors, also emphasized Shami's importance during last week's Champions Trophy selection announcement in Mumbai.""I don't think his fitness issues were related to white-ball cricket. We were trying to get him to Australia. Unfortunately, his knee didn't allow him to play four-day or five-day cricket.""With white-ball cricket, he has played most of the Syed Mushtaq Ali games and some of the Vijay Hazare games. With uncertainty around Jassi (Bumrah), if Shami is fit and playing regularly, his quality and experience are invaluable,"" Agarkar said.As India look to strike the correct balance before the Champions Trophy, Shami's next chance to demonstrate his preparedness is probably going to come later in the series.","Mohammed Shami was left out of India's starting eleven for the opening Twenty20 International match against England.

NEW DELHI: In a gruelling 72-move battle, the longest game of Round 5 in the Masters section , D Gukesh had the last laugh as he got back to winning ways in the Tata Steel Chess Tournament 2025 in Wijk aan Zee on Wednesday.Playing against Vincent Keymer, a member of the team he assembled during his preparation for the World Chess Championship , Gukesh, donning the familiar grey hoddie, reflected glitter of a true world champion on Dutch soil.Playing with white pieces, the Chennai-born grandmaster made a couple of errors here and there, giving the German GM a chance to make a comeback. However, Keymer's persistence eventually gave way under Gukesh's superior game-reading skills.Under time pressure, Keymer finally resigned, giving Gukesh his second win of the tournament and his first after three consecutive draws.

The Northern side had shocked the domestic giants by four wickets at the Wankhede Stadium in the 2014-15 season.On an eventful day when their India stars failed to deliver on their return to the Ranji Trophy and 17 wickets fell, Mumbai, who desperately need to win this match to stay in hunt for a berth in the Ranji knockouts were hanging in the game purely due to their bowlers' fightback.Fired by their tall, well-built pacers Umar Nazir (4-41 in 11 overs) and Yudhvir Singh (4-31 in 8.2 overs) in conditions where the ball was moving around and aiding good bounce, J&K shot out a star-studded, but woeful Mumbai for just 120 in 33.2 overs just after lunch on Day One of their key Group A clash at the MCA's Sharad Pawar Academy in BKC.Making a bold move to bat first and playing as many as three spinners on a pitch where seamers profited, Mumbai endured a horrible morning, as, breathing fire, Nazir ran through the defending champions' top-order, accounting for India's Test & ODI captain Rohit Sharma (3), Hardik Tamore (7), Mumbai skipper Ajinkya Rahane (12) and Shivam Dube (0).It was Auqib Nabi who drew first blood in the third over when he trapped Yashasvi Jaiswal (4) lbw with a ball that came in sharply. Rohit mistimed a pull off Nazir, while Rahane, after stroking a couple of delightful fours, was bowled through the gate by a ball that swung in. Tamore perished while trying to play across, while Dube fell caught behind.In a mood to take the attack back to the opposition, Shreyas Iyer smashed the first ball that he faced down the ground for a huge six, and then hit a four, but soon paid for his risky approach as he was dismissed for just 11, caught by Nazir off Yudhvir at mid-on after playing a poor shot.Left tottering at that point at 47-7, Mumbai's plight would've been worse but for a brilliant counterattacking 63-run partnership for the eighth wicket off just 66 balls between their allrounders Shardul Thakur (51, 57b, 5x4, 2x6) and Tanush Kotian (26, 36b, 5x4).By the close, J&K managed to eke out a 54-run lead, finishing at 174 for seven, with experienced opener Shubham Khajuria (51, 75b, 4x4, 3x6) providing solidity and Abid Mushtaq (44, 37b, 6x4, 2x6) the impetus to the innings.Coming back from an injury which forced him to miss quite a bit of the season Mohit Avasthi took 3-34, while left-arm spinner Shams Mulani, who was dropped from Mumbai's white ball teams, took 2-61 in 10 overs, even as he came in for some stick.","Hosts bundled out for 120, trail by 54 runs on Day One of Group A clash.

Spinner Siddharth Desai recorded a historic feat on Thursday during the first innings of Gujarat's Ranji Trophy match against Uttarakhand, following his spell of 9/36. The match, being played at Ahmedabad's Gujarat College Ground, witnessed Siddharth register the best bowling figures in an innings by a Gujarat cricketer in first-class cricket. However, Siddharth, as well as his teammates, were eager to record a 10th wicket in the spell, which eventually didn't transpire.""10 wickets in an innings is a really big feat. After I picked my ninth wicket, the bowler at the other end tried his level best to ensure that I had the best chance possible by constantly bowling outside off-stump. Unfortunately, the last batter made a mistake. Everyone was left a little shocked as they wanted me to pick the 10th wicket. However, they later came and congratulated me,"" said Siddharth in an exclusive interaction.""Every member of the team kept pushing me to pick as many wickets as possible during the spell. They didn't let me relax at any point. Our team's captain Chintan Gaja kept saying, 'It's not over', in an attempt to motivate me,"" he added.Siddharth maintained focus on ensuring calmness under pressure just like Ravichandran Ashwin and Axar Patel who he idolises.""I wanted to bowl stump-to-stump and ensure patience. The objective was to ensure I didn't get carried away after three wickets. I started feeling that ten wickets could very well be up for grabs following my seventh wicket. However, picking nine wickets is also a great feeling and just like a dream. It's a big moment for me and my family. I just want to do everything possible to represent India in Tests which is my late father's dream,"" he stated.Siddharth didn't pick a wicket in the opening two overs of his spell, but enjoyed immense success in the fifth over of the Uttarakhand innings, which marked the third over of his spell. The spinner picked three wickets in four balls, handing Gujarat the momentum. Uttarakhand were eventually bowled out for 111 in 30 overs.""Siddharth hadn't recorded a five-wicket haul for a long time before this innings. So, my message to him was to simply follow the process rather than getting enamoured by the moment following his third wicket,"" shared Gaja.""His first dismissal made me feel like there could be something special in store for us as there was a sharp turn. It was a classic left-arm spinner's dismissal. The speed at which Siddharth bowls makes it difficult for batters to face him. The revs he gets on the ball is special,"" stated Gaja.",Siddharth Desai recorded a historic feat on Thursday during the first innings of Gujarat's Ranji Trophy match against Uttarakhand.

'Quality' matters: Shardul Thakur rues being overlooked for Indian team,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/quality-matters-shardul-thakur-rues-being-overlooked-for-indian-team/articleshow/117493226.cms,"Shardul Thakur (Photo: Video grab)

All-rounder Shardul Thakur came up with another resilient performance that helped Mumbai put up a fight on day one of their Ranji Trophy match against Jammu and Kashmir on Wednesday and expressed a hint of disappointment at being overlooked for the Indian team lately.Coming to the crease with Mumbai reeling at 47 for 7, the 33-year-old displayed his batting skills with a quickfire 51, featuring five boundaries and two sixes, from 57 deliveries. It helped Mumbai reach 120.Talking to reporters after the day's play, Thakur said that selection should be based on ""quality"".""What can I talk about my quality? Others should talk about it. They should see that if someone has quality, he should be given more chances,"" Thakur said, without taking any names.Thakur's batting show on Thursday echoed his remarkable maiden first-class century from the previous season's Ranji Trophy semi-final when, batting at number 9, he revived his side with a knock of 109 off 105 balls, including 13 fours and 4 sixes.""I like batting in difficult situations. In easy situations, everyone does well, but how you put up the show in adverse situations matters. I see tough situations as a challenge and always think about how to overcome that challenge,"" he said.He also remained unsold in the IPL auction last November, as none of the 10 franchise owners showed interest in his all-round skills.Thakur said it's important to move on from setbacks.""You have to forget whatever has happened in the past; it is not going to change. It is important to be in the present and think about what you can do in the near future,"" he said.The game also saw India captain Rohit Sharma turning up for his state side Mumbai for the first time in a Ranji Trophy match in the last decade. However, he could score just three runs as his poor run with the bat continued.Talking about Rohit's committment and passion towards the fag end of his glowing career, Thakur said: ""He is always passionate about Mumbai cricket. Any Mumbaikar, the way we have seen hardships growing up as teenagers playing maidan cricket , everyone is so passionate about Mumbai cricket. Even if they're playing for India, they follow what the Mumbai team is doing.""""When they come back here, they play as if they are part of this team and they play all (their) heart out.""""To be fair to Rohit, I felt he was just batting in his own zone...he wasn't trying a lot. (He was) just keeping things simple, but yes, (against) the new ball, (you get) one chance; it can go anywhere,"" he added.","All-rounder Shardul Thakur says selection should be based on ""quality"" Mumbai batsman says Rohit Sharma was batting in his own zone.

PACE PUNCH

BENGALURU: A nicely watered wicket, cold air, disciplined bowling and callous shot selection collided to ensure Punjab crashed to a lowly 55 at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium here on Thursday. Their opposition Karnataka, on the brink of an early exit, had more than one positive on the first day of their Ranji Trophy fixture here.R Smaran, then stood tall, figuratively and literally, to drive home the advantage as Karnataka reached 199/4 in the 50 overs they faced at stumps, a healthy 144-run lead. The cornerstone of that innings was Smaran’s unbeaten 100-ball 83 (12x4; 1x6).The 21-year-old, who had an underwhelming start to his Ranji Trophy career, found his bearings during the recent Vijay Hazare Trophy triumph. Fresh from the century in the final of the white-ball competition, the southpaw was a picture of intent, elegance and assured footwork.A lot has been spoken about the former state U-23 captain being an India prospect. While he has miles to go, he appears well on his way. A confident youngster, whose stroke-making finesse is complemented by his flair for the big hits, Smaran didn’t take long to settle. His first boundary was off the sixth delivery he faced.He was initially cautious but once he got his eye in, he switched gears like a well-greased machine. That he was in his element was apparent when, in the 30th over, when he went after Gurnoor Brar, entertaining the few watchers with cover drives. He smacked three boundaries in four deliveries.That approach was bound to give the opposition opportunities, but the close calls were few and far between and he continued in the same vein largely untroubled. It was a courageous innings since Karnataka had wobbled slightly after a good start from openers KV Aneesh (33) and Mayank Agarwal (20). The two fell in quick succession and another wicket at that point could have reduced the good work from the bowlers to nought.Aneesh gifted his wicket to Aradhya Shukla with a mistimed pull, while Agarwal failed to negotiate a Sanvir Singh delivery which kept low and was rapped right in front on the pads. Devdutt Padikkal (27) and KL Shrijith (26) too squandered promising starts.Agarwal had called right at the toss. Shubman Gill , who led Punjab, has plenty at stake after a low-key tour of Australia. Abhilash Shetty (3/19), making his second Ranji Trophy appearance for Karnataka, struggled at first and Gill struck him for a boundary to get off the mark.But Shetty quickly figured out Gill’s love for the drive and soon had the Punjab skipper picking the wrong line. The inside-edge flew straight to wicketkeeper Shrijith. The 28-year-old Shrijith had a busy day with the big gloves as he collected six catches.Karnataka’s pace attack, led by the ever-dependable V Koushik (4/16), rarely strayed as they made the most of the conducive morning conditions. Along with Prasidh Krishna (2/11) they tied down Punjab’s batting line-up. After Shetty removed the openers, Koushik laid bare Punjab’s middle-order, removing Pukhraj Mann (1) and Anmolpreet Singh (0) off consecutive deliveries. Prabhsimran Singh too left early, leaving Punjab staring down the barrel at 14/4. They never recovered.At one point, it appeared they would be bowled out for the lowest-ever Ranji Trophy score at this venue – 44 by Mumbai in 2015 — but were saved by the 11 extras which the hosts conceded.","Karnataka reach 199/4 in the 50 overs they faced at stumps, a healthy 144-run lead. The cornerstone of that innings was Smaran’s unbeaten 100-ball 83 (12x4; 1x6).
