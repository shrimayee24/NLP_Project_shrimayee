BCCI condemns remarks

Mohamed defends her remarks

NEW DELHI: Just a day before India’s semifinal match against New Zealand , a political bouncer rattled Congress after party spokesperson Shama Mohamed took a swing at Indian men's cricket team captain Rohit Sharma , calling him ""fat"" and a ""mediocre captain."" Her remarks, made after Rohit got out during India's Champions Trophy clash against New Zealand, have sparked a fiery debate, with politicians from all sides weighing in, and Congress distancing itself from the remark.The Congress leader had taken to social media on Sunday, criticising Sharma's physical fitness and calling him a ""mediocre captain."" ""Rohit Sharma is fat for a sportsman! Needs to lose weight! And of course, the most unimpressive captain India has ever had!"" she wrote in a now-deleted post.She went on to compare him unfavourably to cricketing greats like MS Dhoni, Virat Kohli, and Sachin Tendulkar.After facing heavy criticism, Mohamed defended her comments, insisting they were observations rather than body-shaming. ""It was a generic tweet about the fitness of a sportsperson. It was not body-shaming,"" she told ANI, adding that she had every right to express her opinion in a democracy.Congress leader Pawan Khera said that Mohamed had been asked to delete her posts and exercise greater caution in the future. ""Her remarks do not reflect the party's position. She has been advised to be more careful,"" Khera wrote on X.Congress MP Rajani Patil condemned Mohamed's comments, saying, ""I personally and the party also will not approve of body-shaming anyone. Talking this way about a sportsperson who represents the country is not right. The party will seek a response from her on this.""BJP leader Shehzad Poonawalla attacked the Congress, saying, ""Those who have lost 90 elections under the captaincy of Rahul Gandhi are calling Rohit Sharma unimpressive! I guess six ducks in Delhi and 90 election losses is impressive, but winning the T20 World Cup isn’t! Rohit has a brilliant track record as captain.""BJP leader Pradeep Bhandari accused Congress of opposing patriotic figures. ""The Congress party is trying to send a message that every patriot, who does good for the country, will be opposed by them,"" he said.Union sports minister Mansukh Mandaviya also weighed in on the controversy and suggested political parties to leave sportspersons alone as they are fully capable of handling their professional lives.In a social media post on X, Mandaviya said, ""Congress and TMC should leave sportspersons alone as they are fully capable of handling their professional lives. Remarks made by leaders from these parties, indulging in body shaming and questioning an athlete’s place in the team, are not only deeply shameful but also outright pathetic.""""Such comments undermine the hard work and sacrifices that our sportspersons make to represent the country on the global stage,"" he added.TMC MP Saugata Roy supported Mohamed’s critique, arguing, ""I heard that Rohit Sharma's performance has been quite poor. He scored one century, but otherwise gets out cheaply. He shouldn’t be in the team. India wins because of other players.""Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi took a different stand, saying, ""Not an avid cricket fan, but even with my limited interest in the game, I can say that Rohit Sharma, with extra pounds or without, has led India to great heights. It is his work and commitment that matter. Win the trophy, Champion!""Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Nirupam strongly opposed Mohamed’s remarks, calling them disrespectful. ""Rohit Sharma and other cricketers like him are heroes of our country. Only Congress people can feel good about criticising such people. The anti-India mentality appears to be expanding from top to bottom.""BCCI Secretary Devajit Saikia condemned the remarks and said its ""unfortunate"" that such remarks were made before the semifinal match.""It's very unfortunate this kind of remarks come from such a person who is on a responsible post to our captain, on a meanwhile time when India is playing an ICC tournament and the team is all set to play Semi final,"" he told ANI.Despite the backlash, Mohamed doubled down on her stance, questioning Sharma’s leadership choices in key matches. She cited his decisions during India's Test series against Australia and the World Cup final loss in Ahmedabad, arguing that his strategic calls had cost the team. ""Didn't he move KL Rahul to bat at number 3 at the MCG Test & put himself at number 1, which backfired? Because of that, Shubman Gill was out of the XI. Didn’t we lose the last World Cup in Ahmedabad?""Later while speaking to ANI, Shama said that her comments were not meant to body-shame the Indian captain but were a general observation on athlete fitness.“It was a generic tweet about the fitness of a sportsperson. It was not body-shaming. I always believed a sportsperson should be fit, and I felt he was a bit overweight, so I just tweeted about that,” she said. “I have been attacked for no reason. When I compared him with previous captains, I put in a statement. I have the right. What is wrong in saying? It is a democracy,” she added.","Congress spokesperson Shama Mohamed took to social media to criticise captain Rohit Sharma.

'Being attacked for no reason'

BJP’s hits back

NEW DELHI: Congress spokesperson Shama Mohamed on late Sunday questioned the leadership of Indian men's national cricket team captain Rohit Sharma . Reacting to India's match against New Zealand in the ongoing Champions Trophy, Shama labelled Rohit ""fat"" and called him a ""mediocre captain"".""Rohit Sharma is fat for a sportsman! Needs to lose weight! And of course, the most unimpressive captain India has ever had!"" the Congress spokesperson wrote in a social media post. After facing backlash, the Congress leader deleted her post.She went further in another post, questioning Sharma’s abilities compared to past cricketing legends. ""What is so world-class about him when compared to his predecessors like Ganguly, Tendulkar, Dravid, Dhoni, Kohli, Kapil Dev, Shastri & the rest? He is a mediocre captain as well as a mediocre player who got lucky to be the captain of India.""Following the backlash, Shama defended her remarks questioning Rohit's decision to promote himself to the opening spot during India's Test match against Australia, a match that the Men in Blue ultimately lost.""Didn't he move KL Rahul to bat at number 3 at the MCG Test & put himself at number 1 which backfired totally ! Wasn't that a selfish move ? Because of that Shubam Gill was out of the XI . Didn't we lose the last World Cup which took place in Ahmedabad? I have compared him to our previous captains,"" she wrote in another post.Speaking to the news agency ANI, Shama clarified that her remarks were ""generic"" and were not intended to shame the captain of the Indian men's cricket team. Further defending her comments, she said that, in her opinion, ""sportspersons should be fit,"" and added that she was being ""attacked for no reason"" over her statements.""It was a generic tweet about the fitness of a sportsperson. It was not body-shaming. I always believed a sportsperson should be fit, and I felt he was a bit overweight, so I just tweeted about that,"" she said.""I have been attacked for no reason.

""Those who have lost 90 elections under the captaincy of Rahul Gandhi are calling the captaincy of Rohit Sharma unimpressive!"" he remarked.Poonawalla also defended Sharma’s track record, referencing his recent achievements. ""I guess six ducks in Delhi and 90 election losses is impressive, but winning the T20 World Cup isn’t! Rohit has a brilliant track record as captain, by the way!""Meanwhile, on the field, India secured a crucial victory over New Zealand, winning by 44 runs to top Group A. Shreyas Iyer’s composed 79 and Varun Chakravarthy’s five-wicket haul helped India set up a semifinal clash against Australia in the Champions Trophy.","Congress spokesperson Shama Mohamed questioned the leadership of Indian men's national cricket team captain Rohit Sharma.

NBA Offseason Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers might sign 8x All-Star and NBA Champion; possible reunion with Luka Doncic?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/nba-offseason-rumors-los-angeles-lakers-might-sign-8x-all-star-and-nba-champion-possible-reunion-with-luka-doncic/articleshow/118668216.cms,"Luka Doncic and LeBron James (Image via Getty Images)

“He often talked about their families being close, spending time off the court enjoying each other's presence, and just a pure enjoyment on both of their faces when they are on the court.”

“All in all, Dallas made a move to try winning the NBA Finals, but there is a serious connection between Irving being 'out-of-the-loop' in Dallas to where he joins two of his former teammates in Los Angeles,”

The Los Angeles Lakers made headlines earlier this year by acquiring Luka Doncic in a blockbuster trade with the Dallas Mavericks. While the Slovenian superstar has quickly become a fan favorite, the Lakers could further solidify their roster this offseason by reuniting Doncic with a familiar face: Kyrie Irving Irving, an eight-time All-Star and NBA champion with the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2016, shares a strong bond with Doncic. Their partnership in Dallas, though short-lived, was electric. “(Kyrie) Irving and Doncic were basically two peas in a pod, with Irving outright stating on numerous occasions how dominant of a player Doncic was as well as how good of a friend he was,” wrote Daniel Alameda of The Wrightway Sports Network.During their time together, Kyrie Irving ’s flashy ball-handling and clutch shot-making perfectly complemented Doncic’s methodical and strategic approach. Despite losing to the Boston Celtics, the pair guided the Mavericks to a 50-32 record and an unexpected trip to the NBA Finals the previous season. The couple showed a lot of promise despite the setback, so the prospect of a reunion in Los Angeles was fascinating.The Los Angeles Lakers , who traded Anthony Davis for Doncic in February, are now focused on building a championship-caliber team around their new star. Bringing in Kyrie Irving, who also shares a strong relationship with LeBron James, could be a game-changer.Alameda added.Kyrie Irving’s experience, leadership, and chemistry with Doncic make him an ideal target for the Los Angeles Lakers in free agency. If the franchise can secure the $120 million guard, it would not only boost their title hopes for the 2025-26 season but also send a clear message to Doncic that they are committed to building a contender around him.Also read: NBA Offseason Rumors: Golden State Warriors might sign $60 million Chicago Bulls center to support Stephen Curry in his remaining years As the offseason approaches, all eyes will be on the Los Angeles Lakers’ front office to see if they can pull off this high-stakes reunion.","The Los Angeles Lakers made headlines earlier this year by acquiring Luka Doncic in a blockbuster trade with the Dallas Mavericks.

NBA legendhas recently shared his thoughts on’s performance at the, as he has found his rhythm pushing the team in the Bay area to clinch more wins. When the Golden State Warriors acquired Butler, many questioned whether he would fit into their system. However, nearly a month after the trade deadline, Butler has given the ""Dubs"" a much-needed spark, elevating them from a struggling play-in contender to a legitimate playoff threat. He has been one of the lethal stars in the league, and the partnership withmade them more powerful. Carmelo Anthony has recently shared his thoughts on Jimmy Butle r’s new tenure with the Golden State Warriors. During a recent episode of 7 PM in Brooklyn, 10-time NBA All-Star Anthony praised how Butler brought life back to the team. “Jimmy gives them something different,” Melo said. “Jimmy gives you another Draymond on the defensive end. So Jimmy can now guard the players, and Draymond can be the safety now, which he is very elite at being the safety. So now, Jimmy could be as aggressive on the defensive end. He could be in the passing lanes. He got Draymond talking to him. That’s the type of sh** that Jimmy needs to be around. And they’re dogs out there on the defensive end.”The numbers back up Melo’s assessment. In January 2025, the Warriors ranked 25th in the league in defensive rating. Since Butler’s arrival, they’ve skyrocketed to No. 3 overall in February 2025. The team’s newfound defensive identity has been a game-changer, helping them secure key wins in the second half of the season.Beyond his defensive contributions, Butler has also provided a steadying force on offense. Melo pointed out how Butler's ability to slow the game down by drawing fouls gives Stephen Curry much-needed breathers. His post-game also adds another dimension to the Warriors’ offensive sets, allowing them to attack teams in different ways.“Jimmy thrives in that role of like being just a role player in a sense,” Anthony said. “That’s when you gonna see the best Jimmy. And he wants to be the complimentary guy. He’s a star, but he wants to be the complimentary guy to Steph. And why not?”So far, the results speak for themselves. Butler recently became the first player in Warriors history to record 120+ points, 30+ rebounds, and 30+ assists in his first six games with the franchise. In eight games, he's averaging 16.4 points, 5.8 rebounds, 5.6 assists, and 1.3 steals per game. Undoubtedly, it is impressive numbers for someone seamlessly adapting to a new system.However, Butler’s arrival in the Golden State was far from a cakewalk. Before the trade, his relationship with the Miami Heat had deteriorated, leading him to demand a move.Anthony had a word of caution for Butler. He referenced former NBA point guard Stephon Marbury, whose public feud with the New York Knicks led to a steep decline in his career. “Chill out,” Anthony advised Butler, suggesting that his heated dispute with Heat president Pat Riley could hurt his trade prospects.Also Read: Anthony Edwards' blunt message to Barack Obama gets big reaction from Carmelo Anthony The Heat's reluctance to lower their asking price only complicated matters, as the market for Butler wasn't as robust as expected. In the end, the Warriors capitalized on the situation, bringing in a player who has already made a significant impact.

After the intense feud Rhodes had at the premium live event, it is very apparent that Rhodes will lock horns in a fierce battle with the Cenation leader.However, his win at WrestleMania feels skeptical as The Rock has joined hands with Cena to fight against Rhodes. Now, the biggest question is, who will join Rhodes to help him claim the title?WrestleMania 41 will also feature The WWE Women's Championship as Tiffany Stratton will fight against 2025 Royal Rumble winner Charlotte Flair . Previously, Stratton cashed in her Money in the Bank contract against Nia Jax and defeated her to win the title on the Jan. 3 edition of SmackDown.On the other hand, the 14-time champion Flair returned from injury at the 2025 Royal Rumble and won the match, securing a championship opportunity of her choosing.According to WWE, The “Queen” also spoke with Women's World Champion Rhea Ripley and NXT Women's Champion Giulia before choosing to challenge Stratton on The Grandest Stage of Them All.Another match which is already announced by WrestleMania is Gunther vs. Jey Uso.

His victory at the Rumble earned him the privilege to choose the World Champion who would fight against him.When Gunther attacked him from behind on the February 10 edition of Raw, Jey immediately announced that he would challenge The Ring General at The Show of Shows. The biggest question now lingers is, who will claim the World Heavyweight Championship at The Showcase of the Immortals?After Bianca Belair clinched the Women’s Elimination Chamber title and punched her ticket to WrestleMania 41, now it is time for Rhea Ripley and Iyo Sky to confront each other and fight for their place in the Shows of Show.

After he was severely injured at the Royal Rumble by Bron Breakker, the US-based Youtuber vowed never to be back on WWE, but now it seems the young sensation has changed his mind to come in support of Rhodes while reacting to John Cena’s heel turn on Cody Rhodes.After what happened to Cody Rhodes at the Elimination Chamber PLE, YouTube sensation IShowSpeed has extended his support to the American Nightmare. IShowSpeed extended his support for Rhodes during the latest live stream reacting to John Cena ’s shocking transition and said that he would join Rhodes to help him win against Cena and The Rock.On the other hand, Travis Scott, who featured with The Rock and Cena to beat Cody Rhodes at the Elimination Chamber PLE, is preparing to feature in WWE.

Golden State Warriors injury report for tonight’s game against the Charlotte Hornets (March 3, 2025)

How to watch the Charlotte Hornets play tonight against the Golden State Warriors (March 3, 2025)

The Charlotte Hornets are set to host the Golden State Warriors on Monday, March 3, at the Spectrum Center, but all eyes are on the injury report, particularly the status of star point guard LaMelo Ball. The Hornets, struggling with a 14-45 record, have seven players listed on the injury report, including Ball, whose absence could further complicate their chances against a competitive Warriors squad. LaMelo Ball is listed on the team’s projected starters and he is absent from the team’s injury report. So, he will be playing tonight against the Warriors. Ball who leads the Hornets with a team-high 26.1 points per game, has been a bright spot in an otherwise challenging season for Charlotte. However, his recent injury has raised concerns about his availability and the team’s ability to compete without their primary scorer and playmaker. While the official injury report does not specify Ball’s condition, his absence from the list suggests he may be playing through discomfort or managing a minor issue. The Hornets ’ injury woes extend beyond LaMelo Ball. Grant Williams and Brandon Miller are out for the season with ACL and wrist injuries, respectively, while Josh Okogie and Tre Mann are also sidelined. Miles Bridges, listed as probable due to illness, is expected to play, providing some relief for a team already thin on depth.On the Warriors’ side, the injury report is less severe but still impactful. Jonathan Kuminga is out with an ankle injury, while Quinten Post is questionable for the same reason. Jimmy Butler, listed as probable with a back issue, is expected to suit up, bolstering Golden State’s lineup.The Warriors, with a 32-28 record, have been consistent offensively, ranking 16th in the league with 113.0 points per game. Stephen Curry remains their cornerstone, averaging 24.1 points and leading the NBA with 4.5 three-pointers made per game. His presence, combined with the Hornets’ defensive struggles, could spell trouble for Charlotte, especially if LaMelo Ball is limited or unavailable.For the Hornets, Bridges has been a key contributor, averaging 20.6 points and 7.7 rebounds over the last 20 games. His ability to step up in Ball’s potential absence will be critical. However, Charlotte’s overall performance has been lackluster, ranking 28th in scoring (105.2 points per game) and 13th in points allowed (112.8).As the Hornets prepare to face the Warriors, LaMelo Ball’s status remains a focal point. His presence on the court could provide a much-needed spark, but his absence would leave a significant void in Charlotte’s offense. Fans can catch the game at 7 p.m. ET on NBCS-BA and FDSSE or stream it live on Fubo.Also read: Will Jimmy Butler play tonight against the Charlotte Hornets?

How to watch the Philadelphia 76ers play tonight against the Portland Trail Blazers (March 3, 2025)?

The Philadelphia 76ers will face the Portland Trail Blazers on Monday, March 3, at the Wells Fargo Center, but they’ll do so without their star center, Joel Embiid, who has been officially ruled out for the remainder of the season due to a knee injury. Embiid’s absence is a significant blow to the struggling 76ers, who are already dealing with multiple injuries as they prepare for the 7 p.m. ET tip-off. Joel Embiid , a former MVP and the cornerstone of the 76ers’ roster, has been sidelined since late January after suffering a meniscus tear in his left knee. Despite initial hopes for a potential return, the team confirmed on Monday that he will not play again this season.The 76ers’ injury report is lengthy, with four other players listed alongside Embiid. Eric Gordon (wrist), Jared McCain (meniscus), and Kyle Lowry (hip) are all out, while Paul George remains questionable with a groin injury. These absences have left the team shorthanded as they try to navigate a challenging season. Philadelphia currently sits at 21-38, ranking 26th in the league in scoring with 109.2 points per game. Tyrese Maxey has stepped up in Joel Embiid’s absence, leading the team with 26.7 points per game, good for sixth in the NBA. Kelly Oubre Jr. has also been a bright spot, averaging 17.8 points and 7.2 rebounds over the last 20 games. However, the team’s struggles on the boards—ranking last in the league with 39.2 rebounds per game—have been a glaring issue.On the other side, the Trail Blazers enter the game with their own injury concerns. Robert Williams III (knee), Matisse Thybulle (ankle), Deandre Ayton (calf), and Jerami Grant (calf) are all out, leaving Portland without key contributors. Anfernee Simons, who leads the team with 18.7 points per game, will be relied upon heavily to carry the offensive load.The matchup between the 76ers and Trail Blazers will be a battle of two teams fighting to stay afloat amid injury-plagued seasons. For Philadelphia, the focus now shifts to the future, as Joel Embiid’s recovery and the team’s offseason moves will be critical in determining their trajectory for the 2025-26 season.Fans can catch the game live on KATU, KUNP, and NBCS-PH, or stream it on Fubo.

Rangers coach Peter Laviolette later defended his forward despite the controversy.In the first period, Rempe’s elbow made contact with Blankenburg’s head, sending it crashing into the glass. As Blankenburg struggled to get up, Predators’ Andreas Englund immediately dropped his gloves, sparking a fierce fight that left both players bloodied.Laviolette backed Rempe, attributing the hit to his size and aggressive forechecking rather than malicious intent. The debate rages on, was it a reckless hit or just part of hockey’s hard-nosed nature?""Remps is just such a big man. He was forechecking. When he hits, he's just higher than everybody else. I don't think he hit him, I think he maybe grazed him a little bit. I think it was more of a miss. That's his game, as well. He's got to do it within the rules, but we also need him forechecking,"" said Laviolette post-game.” (via: Sportskeeda)Matt Rempe landed in the penalty box with a two-minute minor for elbowing and a five-minute major for fighting, while Englund took a two-minute minor, a 10-minute misconduct for instigating, and a five-minute major.Though Rempe escaped further punishment for now, the NHL’s Department of Player Safety may step in, potentially handing him a fifth suspension in just two seasons.The New York Rangers delivered a commanding performance at Madison Square Garden on Sunday, shutting out the Nashville Predators 4-0 and rebounding impressively from last week’s loss to the Maple Leafs.Artemi Panarin wasted no time putting the Rangers on the board, striking 8:32 into the first period.

Rob Gronkowski sarcastically suggested that Tom Brady might have snubbed him due to his age



Gronk & Jules Craft the ULTIMATE NFL Offense | Dudes on Dudes

Tom Brady's inaugural offseason as a Las Vegas Raiders minority owner is already busy, with him having had a hand in bringing in Pete Carroll as head coach and reportedly sitting down with Matthew Stafford regarding the quarterback role. One individual who hasn't received a call from him, though, is former teammate Rob Gronkowski, who isn't pleased about the lack of communication.There were rumors recently that Gronkowski was training for an eventual NFL return, but he shot them down on Dudes on Dudes. Even so, he couldn't help but wonder why Brady, his long-time quarterback and four-time Super Bowl champion teammate, never called, even as a courtesy.Tom Brady, the first minority owner at the Las Vegas Raiders, is in the midst of hiring Pete Carroll as head coach and meeting with Matthew Stafford for a quarterback role. However, former teammate Rob Gronkowski has not heard from him, and the former tight end is unhappy about this development.Rumors circulated in the NFL that Gronkowski had a potential comeback in mind, but the former tight end denied these claims on Dudes on Dudes. He wonders why his former quarterback, with whom he won four Super Bowls, didn't even give him a call as a courtesy.Rob Gronkowski sarcastically suggested Brady might have snubbed him due to his age, expressing disappointment that the GOAT. “Nope, Tom did not hit me up. I’m pretty disappointed because Tom is now a team owner, and he’s not even hitting me up. He doesn’t even want me as a player anymore! That must mean he’s looking at me like I’m washed,” said Gronk.Rob Gronkowski admitted that if Brady had approached him about playing for the Raiders, he would have accepted it wholeheartedly. “But if he did hit me up, I would listen to his pitch. I would, Jules, maybe take it into consideration,” he told Julian Edelman.Julian Edelman suggested Gronk could return to the NFL if the stars aligned, suggesting he join the Los Angeles Chargers instead. This would keep Gronk near the Nut House and place him on a playoff-caliber team led by Justin Herbert and Jim Harbaugh, as suggested by his co-host. Surprisingly enough, Gronk was so intrigued by the idea that he started to explain how well he would fit in Harbaugh’s system.“That’d be a great offense for me as well because my game contributes in the blocking world too. That’s what gets me open — play-action. And Justin Herbert needs that tight end for those play-action routes to just dump it right over the middle. They want to run the ball, they want to establish the run. And I’m not a guy that can go out there for 30-40 passes anymore these days, Jules. So, the Chargers would be a good possibility,” said Gronk.Also Read: FOX Sports NFL insider has questioned the reported sit-down between Tom Brady and Matthew Stafford, indicating it was not a coincidence If Rob Gronkowski ever decides to return to the NFL, he’d be more likely to join the Chargers than the Raiders. One key reason is that Las Vegas already has standout tight end Brock Bowers, whom Gronk praised as a “savage.” With Julian Edelman and Gronk making a strong case for a move to Los Angeles, the idea of him suiting up for the Chargers doesn’t seem far-fetched.",Tom Brady is the first minority owner at the Las Vegas Raiders.

Joe Burrow Gets the Nod Over Patrick Mahomes as Rob Gronkowski’s ‘All-Dude’ First Team QB



Gronk & Jules All-Dude Team: Quarterbacks | Dudes on Dudes

Joe Burrow 's 2024 season might not have dominated the headlines like those of Josh Allen, Lamar Jackson, and Patrick Mahomes , but his individual brilliance was undeniable. Despite putting up All-Pro-worthy numbers, Burrow's efforts largely went unnoticed due to the Cincinnati Bengals missing the playoffs with a 9-8 record. However, his statistical achievements—4,918 passing yards, 43 touchdowns, nine interceptions, a 70.6% completion rate, and a 108.5 passer rating—paint a different picture. While accolades such as the Comeback Player of the Year award and a Pro Bowl nod came his way, many believe he was deserving of even higher recognition.One of his biggest supporters in this debate is NFL legend Rob Gronkowski, who firmly backed Joe Burrow over Patrick Mahomes for his All-Dude First Team. During the latest episode of the Dudes on Dudes podcast, Gronk and Julian Edelman played the role of general managers, drafting their own First and Second Team All-Dude offenses. While Edelman initially leaned toward Mahomes for First-Team QB, Gronk passionately disagreed.“I’m going to put Joe Burrow as the First Teamer here in this situation. That guy balled out for the Cincinnati Bengals this year. I know they didn’t make the playoffs but that doesn’t matter. He balled like he was a First-Team All-Pro guy. He came through,” Gronkowski said.His argument was convincing enough for Edelman to change his mind, ultimately naming Burrow the First-Team QB over Mahomes. The former Patriots wideout acknowledged that Burrow’s numbers were elite, especially for a quarterback whose team failed to reach the postseason. However, when it came to the Second-Team selection, Edelman stood firm, keeping Mahomes in that spot despite Gronk’s consideration of another MVP-level QB, Josh Allen.Mahomes, by contrast, had a statistically underwhelming year compared to his previous seasons, finishing with 3,928 passing yards, 26 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions. However, he showcased his signature ability to adapt and lead the Chiefs to a dominant 15-2 record, proving that numbers don’t always tell the full story. Edelman emphasized Mahomes’ postseason brilliance, citing his ability to step up when it mattered most, as the key reason for keeping him in the Second-Team QB spot over Allen.Even though Allen secured his first MVP award with 4,300 total yards, 40 touchdowns, and just eight turnovers while carrying a depleted Bills roster to a 13-4 finish, his postseason shortcomings played a major role in his omission from Edelman and Gronkowski’s rankings. “Ya, Patrick Mahomes Second-Team for sure. What about Josh Allen though? He was the MVP of the league,” Gronk asked, only to see Edelman stick with his choice.Also Read: Travis Kelce's decision of playing his 13th season next year might affect his future with Taylor Swift The debate over Joe Burrow’s exclusion from AP First-Team and Second-Team All-Pro honors remains open.

Pete Rose's complex legacy gets a second chance

They respond with ecstasy, nostalgia, and the prospect of being admitted to the Hall of Fame

In a ruling that immediately made the sports world go wild, President Donald Trump announced he will officially pardon Cincinnati Reds legend Pete Rose , reversing the lifetime suspension that has kept baseball's hits king out of the Hall of Fame. The announcement was made on March 1, 2025, after decades of debate over Rose's legacy that began with his infamous suspension for betting on games as a player-manager.For decades, the name of Pete Rose has meant brilliance as much as it means scandal. The numbers on his playing field talk: 4,256 hits, 17 All-Star appearances, three World Series rings, and a tireless competitiveness so great it merited him being called ""Charlie Hustle."" Off the playing field, his betting on games resulted in being banned for life from Major League Baseball in 1989 and exclusion, since, from the Hall of Fame ballot.The issue regarding Rose's eligibility has pitted fans, players, and pundits against each other for decades. Some felt that his on-field achievements would surpass his errors, but others felt that betting on his team destroyed beyond repair the integrity of the game.With the pardon from Trump, the drama of Rose's life intensifies. The pardon does not inherently restore his eligibility for the Hall of Fame but delivers a strong statement about forgiveness and redemption being attainable even decades down the road of controversy.The news went viral on social media, with a lot of fans hailing what they perceive as a long-awaited correction of history. On X, one commentator summed up the mood nicely: ""It’s a shame he isn’t here to see this. Do the right thing even though it’s too late!!!”For fans in Cincinnati especially, the pardon is intimate. Rose is still a beloved home-state hero, and his place in the Reds' Big Red Machine dynasty of the 1970s is the stuff of legend. And with the presidential pardon in a pocket, many now hope that this could at long last bring about an end to the exclusionary behavior by the Hall of Fame of the candidature of Rose.Also Read: Baseball Legend Pete Rose Dies At 83","Pete Rose was banned for life from Major League Baseball in 1989 for betting on games.

With India securing victory and topping the group, only Australia remained in Dubai for their semi-final against India, while South Africa made a swift return to Pakistan.Despite the disruption, Klaasen believes the team is well-prepared. ""It was not ideal for the bodies, but we had some time to get out and walk about. We knew ahead of time that two teams were going to have to travel,"" he said.The quick turnaround meant the Proteas had to endure two flights of around five hours each within a short period. But Klaasen downplayed any concerns about fatigue, saying, ""We haven’t travelled a lot in this competition, to be fair. It was just a crazy 18 hours. We could stretch our legs and recover before we had to come back. It is part of professional cricket these days. There is not much more to say about it.""Now settled in Lahore, South Africa are shifting focus to the conditions they will face in their crucial knockout match against the Black Caps. ""It is quite chilly (in Lahore), so I think the ball will swing a little bit more. It is a good skill that needs to be applied. But Pakistan is a nice place to bat,"" Klaasen noted.South Africa’s recent record in ICC events gives them confidence. They reached the semi-finals of the 2023 ODI World Cup and finished as runners-up in last year’s T20 World Cup. Klaasen believes those experiences will serve them well.""The nerves are a little bit less because we have more experience in the semi-final department,"" he said. ""We are playing good cricket at ICC events, we have just had some bad luck and things not go our way. We are holding our composure in the bigger moments. The big boys just need to step up on Wednesday.""A victory over New Zealand would send South Africa into the final, where they would face either India in Dubai or Australia in Lahore. By then, the Proteas will hope their unexpected travel detour will be a distant memory.","Heinrich Klaasen insists whirlwind trip will not impact South Africa's performance.

Gustav Nyquist’s impact and trade details

Minnesota Wild face key injuries amid playoff hunt

Also Read:

With the NHL Trade Deadline fast approaching, the Minnesota Wild have made a decisive move to bolster their roster by reacquiring veteran forward Gustav Nyquist from the Nashville Predators in exchange for a second-round pick in the 2026 NHL Draft . The 35-year-old winger, known for his versatility and offensive skill, adds depth to a Wild team eager to secure a postseason spot despite key injuries.Nyquist has recorded 21 points (nine goals, 12 assists) in 58 games this season and was held out of Nashville’s 7-4 loss to the New York Islanders on Saturday for trade-related reasons. He is in the final year of a two-year, $6.37 million contract and will become an unrestricted free agent after the season. As part of the trade, Nashville will retain 50% of his $3.185 million cap hit.“They’re getting a real good player, real good,” said Nashville coach Andrew Brunette. “He’s a smart player, versatile, can play any role on your team.” “They’re getting one of the best teammates you'll ever find and one of the best people. So, they're lucky to get him, and hopefully he plays up to what he can bring.”This marks Nyquist’s second stint with the Wild. He was previously acquired from Columbus on Feb. 28, 2023, for a fifth-round pick, contributing five points in three regular-season games and five assists in six playoff outings. In his return debut, he logged nearly 17 minutes of ice time in Minnesota’s 1-0 win over Boston.Minnesota, currently third in the Central Division, is battling through injuries to key forwards Kirill Kaprizov and Joel Eriksson Ek. General manager Bill Guerin emphasized the importance of adding reinforcements. “They put us in a good spot. We've played well mainly all year. There have been some ups and downs, but [this should] give them a boost. You know, they've earned it. They need a little boost right now, they need a little help and you know, for this time of year, I think we have to supply that for them.” (via: NHL)With the Trade Deadline looming at 3 p.m. ET on Friday, Minnesota remains flexible for further moves. ""Again, it's all contingent on moving parts and the health or lack thereof on our team."" ""Look, we can say we want one thing, and then something else transpires. I don't think it does any good to say, 'Hey, this is what we want.' I think going in with some flexibility is good. It would be nice to have a full team at some point in time this season. Maybe we will. But until then, we're really proud of the job that the guys in the lineup have done every night,"" Guerin added.Nyquist, a fourth-round pick by Detroit in 2008, has amassed 524 points (207 goals, 317 assists) in 842 career games. ""Like I said, I’m really happy to be back here,"" he said. ""My experience here two years ago, even though it was short, it was great. I have a great relationship with [Guerin]. It’s obviously nice that they want me back, and I feel wanted a little bit, so that’s always nice.”","The Minnesota Wild have reacquired veteran forward Gustav Nyquist from the Nashville Predators in exchange for a second-round pick in the 2026 NHL Draft.

Ryan Lindgren Releases Emotions About the Move to the Colorado Avalanche



Can the Rangers Fill Ryan Lindgren’s Shoes?

The NHL trade deadline has set the hockey world abuzz, and one of the biggest shocks was the departure of Ryan Lindgren from the New York Rangers . After seven seasons of unwavering dedication, Lindgren’s unexpected move to the Colorado Avalanche marks a bittersweet turning point. His journey from a beloved defenseman in New York to a fresh start in Colorado promises both emotional farewells and new opportunities.Most fans were stunned by the trade of Ryan Lindgren to the Colorado Avalanche. For three years he was the Rangers’ defensive anchor; among the highest in ice time at 19–20 minutes per game, his tough and physical style made him a fan favorite. Therefore, it was an added trauma for the team and its followers.Lindgren described his bewilderment about the unexpected manner in which he was traded. “It definitely was up and down. There was a lot of stuff going on. It’s nice to just come here and move on. It’s a new chapter here.” he said, “They’re unbelievable players... you see how hard they work, and that’s why they’re two of the best players in the world,”he said.Lindgren granted that New York had been a tough place to leave but repeated his excitement to join the Avalanche, even more so to team up with stars such as Nathan MacKinnon and Cale Makar: “Obviously they’re unbelievable players. I’ve played against them a couple times, but yeah, to be out there and practice, and just see how hard they work, and you see they stay after practice, and they’re always working on their games, and that’s why they’re two of the best players in the world.”said Lindgren.The Rangers’ decision to trade Lindgren was part of General Manager Chris Drury’s long-term vision to rebuild the roster. In return, the team acquired Juuso Parssinen and Calvin de Haan, both experienced NHL players. However, filling Lindgren’s defensive presence will be no easy task.Calvin de Haan is expected to join the defensive rotation, bringing valuable experience to the team. Although not as physical as Lindgren, de Haan remains confident in his role. “My stats aren’t too sexy, but my underlying numbers have been pretty good for the most part this year. I’m just trying to play my game — play steady hockey, play reliable hockey, try to help the team win. At the end of the day, that’s my job.”Also Read: Oilers fans and media point to extreme fatigue as the leading cause of Connor McDavid’s uncharacteristic slump Ryan Lindgren’s departure marks the end of an era for the New York Rangers. His unwavering dedication and defensive skills will be sorely missed. However, this trade presents a fresh opportunity for both Lindgren and the Rangers. While Lindgren aims to make his mark with the Avalanche, the Rangers must adapt quickly to fill the gap in their defense. As both teams navigate their new lineups, the next few weeks will determine if these bold moves will pay off in the race for the playoffs.","Ryan Lindgren was traded from the New York Rangers to the Colorado Avalanche.

India and Australia are set to face each other in the Champions Trophy semi-final in Dubai on Tuesday, with India looking to overcome their historical struggles against Australia in knockout matches.Australia, despite missing key players Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood, and Mitchell Starc, recently demonstrated their resilience by successfully chasing 352 runs against England in Lahore.India's last victory against Australia in an ICC knockout match was in the 2011 World Cup quarter-final. Since then, India have lost to Australia in the 2015 ODI World Cup semifinals, 2023 ODI World Cup final, and the 2023 World Test Championship final.The Indian team's strategy of including five spinners in their squad, initially criticised, has proven effective on Dubai's slow pitches.India's advantage stems from their experience playing all matches in Dubai and their ability to adapt their bowling approach to local conditions.The Indian spin quartet of Varun Chakravarthy, Kuldeep Yadav, Ravindra Jadeja, and Axar Patel claimed nine New Zealand wickets on Sunday, bowling 128 dot balls in 39 overs.Australia's spinning options are limited to Adam Zampa as their primary spinner, with Glenn Maxwell and Travis Head serving as part-time options.Matthew Short's withdrawal due to a calf injury has further reduced Australia's spinning alternatives.The Australian bowling unit has struggled recently, conceding 352 runs against England and 273 against Afghanistan.Australia's batting strength remains formidable, as evidenced by their recent successful chase of over 350 runs without significant contributions from Travis Head and Steve Smith. India will be particularly focused on dismissing Head early, given his recent success against them.The match presents an opportunity for India to overcome their recent loss to Australia in the 2023 World Cup final in Ahmedabad.The ICC Champions Trophy match between India and Australia will take place on Tuesday, March 4.The ICC Champions Trophy match between India and Australia will be played at Dubai International Stadium.The ICC Champions Trophy match between India and Australia is scheduled to begin at 2:30pm IST, with the toss at 2:00pm IST.The ICC Champions Trophy match between India and Australia will be broadcast on Star Sports Network and live-streamed on JioHotstar.The India vs Australia match will begin at 1pm in Dubai.Viewers in the USA can watch the upcoming India vs Australia Champions Trophy match on Fubo TV.Canadian cricket fans can access the crucial Group A encounter between India vs Australia through Fubo TV's service.You can follow live updates of the ICC Champions Trophy match between India and Australia on TimesofIndia.com.Rohit Sharma (c), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul, Rishabh Pant, Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav, Harshit Rana, Mohd.

Nottingham Forest required penalties to get past Ipswich Town and book a place in the FA Cup quarter-finals after a 1-1 draw at the City Ground.Jack Taylor was the only player who failed to find the back of the net from the spot as Matz Sels' save edged the shootout 5-4 in Forest's favour to set up a last-eight journey to Brighton .The sides are separated by 15 places and 31 points in the Premier League, but with Forest's priority securing Champions League football next season, Nuno Espirito Santo rested a number of his key players.Ipswich sensed their opportunity and took the lead early in the second half when George Hirst headed in a corner at the back post.Ryan Yates took advantage of some woeful defending to nod in an equaliser 22 minutes from time.An extra 30 minutes of extra-time came and went without a winner despite Nuno sending on top scorer Chris Wood and England international Morgan Gibbs-White.But Sels, another of Forest's star performers this season, proved the hero after the first nine penalties of the shootout found the net.""In penalties one of the goalkeepers is going to be the hero,"" said Sels.""I'm happy I could help the team to the next round.

The three matches that we played here, the pitch behaved differently. This is not our home; this is Dubai.

We did not see it in the first two games when our bowlers were bowling. In the last game, we did not get to see that much spin; today there was a bit of it. So, there are different things happening on every surface.""Rohit said that India's choice of picking five spinners for the 2025 Champions Trophy was vindicated, and revealed that the decision was taken after monitoring the trend during the ILT20 here.""Looking at the surface here, hearing about what happened in Dubai in the past two months, we somehow kind of knew that surfaces are going to be slow.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin. The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee. England completely skipped Saturday's practice, but many India players also skipped the optional session.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118081067,imgsize-126924,width-400,resizemode-4/118081067.jpg"

LA Clippers injury report for tonight’s game against the Los Angeles Lakers (March 2, 2025)

When and where to watch the Los Angeles Lakers play tonight against the LA Clippers (March 2, 2025)?

As the Los Angeles Lakers gear up to face the Los Angeles Clippers on Sunday, March 2, 2025, at Crypto.com Arena, all eyes are on Luka Doncic’s injury status. The star guard is listed on the team’s injury report as Game Time Decision (GTD) due to a calf injury. Luka Doncic might miss tonight's match against the LA Clippers as he is listed on the injury report as GTD for a calf injury. Luka, who has been averaging 26.4 points, 8.4 rebounds, and 7.4 assists, is a key piece of the Lakers’ rotation. His potential absence could significantly impact the team’s offensive flow, especially alongside LeBron James, who is also questionable with a foot injury. The Lakers are already dealing with multiple injuries, including Maxi Kleber (foot) and Rui Hachimura (knee), both ruled out, while Austin Reaves (calf) and Jordan Goodwin (ankle) are day-to-day.The LA Clippers , meanwhile, are relatively healthier, with only Derrick Jones Jr. (knee) ruled out and Norman Powell (knee) listed as probable. James Harden, averaging 21.1 points and 9.0 assists in his last 20 games, will lead the Clippers’ charge, while Ivica Zubac’s dominance on the boards (12.6 rebounds per game) could pose a challenge for the Lakers’ already thin frontcourt.The Lakers’ recent performance has been steady, with a +90 scoring differential and a 11th-ranked offense. However, Doncic’s potential absence could disrupt their rhythm, particularly in three-point shooting, where they rank 24th in the league with 12.3 made threes per game.Fans can catch the game live on SportsNet LA and FDSSC or stream it on Fubo, though regional restrictions may apply. With both teams battling injuries, this matchup could come down to which squad adapts better to its depleted roster.As the clock ticks down to tip-off, the Lakers’ medical staff will be working overtime to assess Doncic’s condition. His availability could be the deciding factor in a game that promises high stakes and intense competition.For now, the question remains: Will Luka Doncic suit up for the Lakers, or will they have to face their crosstown rivals without one of their brightest stars? Stay tuned for updates as game time approaches.","Luka Doncic is listed on the team’s injury report as Game Time Decision (GTD) due to a calf injury.

'Steve Smith cannot win a major tournament': Astrologer Lobo's huge prediction ahead of IND vs AUS semis

NEW DELHI: India and Australia are set to battle in the first semi-final of the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 in Dubai on Tuesday, marking their first ODI meeting since the 2023 World Cup final. Despite Australia’s dominant win in Ahmedabad, former captain Ricky Ponting believes India will enter the contest as favourites.""I think India are going to start favourites in this game,"" Ponting told The ICC Review. ""They haven’t had to move and travel. They’ve been training on those wickets all the time. Australia have rushed in to Dubai to get ready.""India topped Group A with an unbeaten run, while Australia secured their semi-final spot as the second-ranked team in Group B with four points. While some might wonder if India are still haunted by their World Cup final defeat, Ponting dismissed such concerns and suggested it could even serve as motivation.""You would hope that would be left behind in the dressing room that night,"" he said. ""They’ve got a lot of experience, a different coach. Maybe they haven’t even talked about it. Or maybe they use it as motivation.""India’s most recent victory — a 44-run win against New Zealand — showcased their ability to recover from challenging situations, something Ponting believes is a key strength of this side.""They had to find a way to stay in the game and shift momentum,"" he noted. ""Shreyas (Iyer) and Axar (Patel) did a great job. They bat deep. Even when they’re in trouble, they have high-quality players to step up.""Ponting highlighted the depth in India’s batting, making them a dangerous opponent even if their star players don’t deliver.""If Rohit doesn’t fire, Virat doesn’t fire, they still have Iyer, Patel, KL (Rahul), Hardik (Pandya). They have players who can get the job done in big moments.""While India’s familiarity with the conditions gives them an edge, Ponting cautioned against underestimating Australia, particularly in high-stakes matches.""India will start favourites, but I’ll never tip against an Australian team,"" he asserted. ""These are the moments where they play their best cricket.""He also addressed the potential impact of the toss, noting that conditions in Dubai might not favour chasing as much as they did in Pakistan earlier in the tournament.""If there’s no dew, whoever wins the toss should bat first. The wicket will probably slow down later. If Australia bat first, I think they have a much better chance than if they chase.""Ponting’s insights add further intrigue to an already thrilling contest between two of cricket’s biggest powerhouses. While India will aim to avenge their 2023 World Cup final loss, Australia will look to once again rise to the occasion when it matters most. With both teams boasting world-class talent and big-match experience, the stage is set for a semi-final showdown that could go down as one of the tournament’s defining moments.",India face Australia in the first semi-final of the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 in Dubai on Tuesday.

'Steve Smith cannot win a major tournament': Astrologer Lobo's huge prediction ahead of IND vs AUS semis

NEW DELHI: India and Australia are set for another high-stakes ICC showdown, this time in the semi-finals of the 2025 Champions Trophy on Tuesday. In a rematch of the 2023 ODI World Cup final , where Australia triumphed, India will look to turn the tables.One man who has been a thorn in India’s side is Travis Head . From his match-winning century in the World Cup final to his heroics in the World Test Championship decider and the Border-Gavaskar Trophy , the Australian left-hander has relished big moments against India.Former Indian spinner Harbhajan Singh has made it clear: Mohammed Shami must get rid of Head early to shift the momentum in India’s favour.""Three things that Team India needs to do, which will be essential to win against Australia,"" Harbhajan said on Star Sports. ""The first thing is to overcome the fear of Travis Head and get him out. Shami saab, bahut ho gaya Travis Head ka kaam, ab unko run nahi banane dena hai [Shami sahab, enough of Travis Head, he shouldn’t be allowed to score runs now].""Head’s numbers against India in ODIs underline the threat he poses. In nine innings, he has amassed 345 runs at an average of 43.12, including a century in the World Cup final. His aggressive approach at the top makes him a game-changer, and Harbhajan believes neutralising him is crucial.However, Head is not the only Australian batter India must be wary of. Harbhajan identified Glenn Maxwell and Josh Inglis as two other key players who could turn the game in an instant.""Their lower-order batters, Glenn Maxwell and Josh Inglis, are strong hitters and deal in sixes and fours,"" he pointed out. ""They must not be allowed to score runs quickly.""Harbhajan also had a word of advice for the Indian team as they step into a do-or-die encounter. While the pressure of a knockout match can be immense, he urged the players to keep things simple.""The third one is simple — it’s a knockout match, and in a knockout match, one should not try too hard,"" he said. ""You have to play in the same manner as you have been playing.""With Head’s track record in crunch games and Australia’s ability to rise to big occasions, India will need to execute Harbhajan’s game plan to perfection. As the two cricketing giants clash once again, the battle between Shami and Head could set the tone for another epic encounter.","India take on Australia in Champions Trophy semi-final on Tuesday.

Shohei Ohtani's fixation on getting better: How his work ethic is redefining the rules of rehab

More than a superstar: Ohtani's leadership remaking the Dodgers' future

Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts has witnessed hundreds of superstars over the course of his career, but even he acknowledges that Shohei Ohtani 's competitiveness is on another level. As Ohtani rehabbed, looking to return with a vengeance for the 2025 season , Roberts couldn't help but be in awe of the two-way sensation's tireless work ethic and effort.Ohtani, who underwent a second elbow surgery in 2024, has spent the entire offseason devoted to a rigorous rehab program. The Japanese phenom has spent hours of video going over the film, frame by frame, his own pitching motion and working on his hitting style as well. That singular focus, Roberts thinks, is what distinguishes Ohtani from even the most diligent workers.Even with his limitations to a job as an occasional designated hitter following his surgery, Shohei Ohtani's 2024 batting was still elite. He ended the season slashing .309/.394/.585 with 34 home runs, proving he could still be one of the scariest hitters in the game. But Shohei Ohtani's own expectations are even loftier. For him, success isn't merely about hitting home runs, it's about getting back on the mound and reasserting his dual-threat dominance.What's even more impressive about Shohei Ohtani's return is how he's shaping the next generation of Dodgers prospects. While Shohei Ohtani has been rehabbing, he's played mentor to young pitcher Zyhir Hope and Korean infielder Hyeseong Kim. Both have credited Shohei Ohtani with being receptive to offering advice from mechanical adjustments to mental preparation for the upcoming season.In his eyes, Ohtani combines elite ability with competitive fervor and selflessness as a leader to become an all-time player. ""When you have a human being that good, who's also the hardest worker in the room, the ceiling goes away,"" Roberts said. As Opening Day 2025 of the new season comes closer, everyone will be waiting with bated breath for Shohei Ohtani's return.Also Read: “I’m Excited”: Dave Roberts Pumped As Shohei Ohtani Faces Live Pitching And Hits Well Amidst Injury Concerns","Shohei Ohtani underwent a second elbow surgery in 2024.
