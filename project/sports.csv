NEW DELHI: Rajya Sabha MP Kamal Haasan advocated for education, terming it as a necessity to break the chains of ""dictatorship and Sanatan"". He warned against using any other means, emphasizing that without education, it's impossible to truly win, as ""majority fools"" could still make one lose.""Education is the only weapon that can break the chains of dictatorship and Sanatan,"" ANI quoted the Rajya Sabha MP saying on Sunday. He was addressing a gathering at the Agaram Foundation event in Chennai.""Don't take anything else in your hands, only education. We cannot win without it, because the majority can make you lose. Majority Fools (Moodargal) will make u lose; knowledge alone will seem defeated. That's why we must hold on to it (Education) firmly,"" he added.Earlier this year, Haasan had faced backlash for his remark on Kannada language during the promotion of his movie Thug Life, for which the actor refused to apologise. The move had attracted Karnataka HC's intervention for not issuing an apology.The Supreme Court then intervened and ruled that the Karnataka HC was wrong to demand an apology from Haasan over his Kannada remarks.","Rajya Sabha MP Kamal Haasan advocates for education, terming it as a necessity to break the chains of ""dictatorship and Sanatan"" He was addressing a gathering at the Agaram Foundation event in Chennai.

"IND vs ENG Test: 'In today's day and age...' – R Ashwin slams Shubman Gill, Gautam Gambhir for 'lack of game awareness'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-tour-of-england/ind-vs-eng-test-in-todays-day-and-age-r-ashwin-slams-shubman-gill-gautam-gambhir-for-lack-of-game-awareness/articleshow/123085619.cms,"India head coach Gautam Gambhir (left) and Shubman Gill during a nets session at the Kia Oval, London, Wednesday July 30, 2025.

IND vs ENG: Gautam Gambhir loses cool during heated exchange with ground staff at The Oval ahead of 5th Test

Poll Do you agree with R Ashwin's criticism of Shubman Gill's captaincy? Yes, he lacks experience. No, he will improve over time. Partially, he needs to adapt. Not sure.

Former India off-spinner R Ashwin has slammed captain Shubman Gill and coach Gautam Gambhir for a ""lack of game awareness"" in the ongoing Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy.Bad light and subsequent rain forced stumps to be called early on Day 4 of the fifth Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy Test at The Oval on Sunday. With the stage set for a thrilling Day 5, England need just 35 more runs to win, while India require four wickets for a miraculous victory.""Coming back to the topic of spinners not being used, I have felt in this series that there has been a lack of game awareness and, in many ways, our tactical acumen — both on and off the field. This is the main reason why England are ahead in this series and India are behind. We haven't been the sharpest,” Ashwin said on his YouTube channel Ash Ki Baat.“I feel Shubman Gill will get much better as a captain. He will learn. But sometimes, if you feel that you can play spin really well, you might not bring spinners into the attack. And when you miss the right moment to introduce spinners in these conditions, they become a defensive option,” he added.Rain forcing the match into the fifth day means every Test of the riveting five-match series has now gone into the final day. England looked all set to complete the chase of 374 on Day 4, thanks to Joe Root hitting his 39th Test century — 105 off 152 balls — paying a fitting tribute to Graham Thorpe.His fellow Yorkshireman Harry Brook struck a stunning 111 off 98 balls — his tenth century in the longer format — and made the most of a crucial reprieve on 19, dropped by Mohammed Siraj. Root and Brook shared a brilliant counter-attacking stand of 195 runs, giving England real hope of completing their second-highest run chase of all time — and the highest ever at The Oval.“When Harry Brook started taking it on, after 20 runs, you could have brought on the spinner to choke the run flow. From the other end, a pacer could have bowled. With all this in mind, Washington Sundar could have been introduced earlier into the attack,” Ashwin said.“Making these mistakes creates a huge gap. We don’t know whether the message is going from outside to the middle. We don’t know what’s being discussed in the dressing room. But in today’s day and age, these mistakes can definitely be avoided,” he added.","Former India off-spinner R Ashwin has slammed captain Shubman Gill and coach Gautam Gambhir for a ""lack of game awareness"" in the ongoing Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy.

Johnny Manziel defends Cam Newton with savage clapback amid Jalen Hurts media drama targeting Eagles superfan



Newton and Manziel: Heads of the underdog empire



Former Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Manziel has once again taken to social media to defend a fellow football icon—and this time, his fiery words were aimed at Philadelphia Eagles superfan King Gillie. The controversy erupted after a viral video showed Gillie taunting Cam Newton for never winning a Super Bowl, a jab that didn’t sit well with Manziel, who wasted no time clapping back.During his birthday celebration, King Gillie—known for his passionate Eagles support—was seen holding the Vince Lombardi Trophy and mocking Newton’s NFL résumé. “Cam ain’t never had one of these, and I ain’t going back and forth with you,” he said into the mic. “Thank you Jalen. Appreciate you Jalen. Love you Nick. Appreciate you Jalen. Cam Newton never had one of these.”The clip, shared by the parody “Shannon Sharpes Burner” account on X, quickly made the rounds, drawing attention not only for the statement but for its timing. Less than 24 hours later, Johnny Manziel unleashed a scathing response on the platform.“Yo King Gillie you may be the biggest f-cking loser on the planet.Talking like you’ve f-cking done anything on a football field. If I see you just know I’m going to slap the f-ck out of you, trust,” Manziel posted.Manziel’s outrage wasn’t just about football accolades—it was personal. Newton had appeared just the day before on Manziel’s new podcast Glory Daze, where both men reflected on their shared past as underdog icons in college football.In the podcast episode, Newton delved into what made their college football journeys so powerful and similar. “When you think about Texas A&M and you think about Texas, who’s the superior team? Texas. Right? When you think about Auburn and you think about Alabama, who’s the superior team? Alabama. We were the heads of the underdogs.”Both Newton and Manziel etched their names into college football history—Newton in 2010 with Auburn and Manziel in 2012 with Texas A&M. Though Newton’s NFL career included a league MVP award and a Super Bowl appearance, the mutual respect between the two remains rooted in their college dominance, not just professional achievements.Manziel’s defense of Newton wasn’t just about a friend—it was about legacy, respect, and reminding fans that greatness isn’t always measured by trophies.Also Read: Jayden Daniels does not care much what people say, he is still a 'Momma's boy': “She’s a mom first""","Former Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Manziel has taken to social media to defend fellow football icon Cam Newton.

The WWE Summerslam 2025 event was staged as a two-night show for the first time in its entire history. Held at the MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, Night 2 saw quite a few celebrities attending the event alongside the fans, including NBA superstar Tyler Haliburton. Night 1 saw an audience of 53,161 and Night 2 didn't disappoint either, as an audience of 60,561 was inside the arena.Night 2 also has six matches set for the night, just like Night 1. And fans were going absolutely wild cheering for their favorite wrestlers all throughout the event. The 38th SummerSlam has been chaotic, fun, surprising, and so much more. And as we close the big summer event of WWE , let's take a look at all the winners and top performers of the night.The opening match of Night 2 was a triple-threat fight featuring Naomi vs. IYO SKY vs. Rhea Ripley . Naomi initially wanted the other two to fight it out among themselves before she came in, but Ripley and Sky made an unspoken alliance to take on their opponent first. Naomi was like a beast as she put both Mami and the Japanese superstar through the pages. And though it seemed like things were making a turn, Naomi stacks Ripley for a pin to take the win.This match was always going to be the biggest chaos of the night, and it didn't disappoint. Wyatt Sicks - the reigning tag team champions faced 5 other tag teams. #DIY, Street Profits, Fraxiom, Motor City Machine Guns, and the duo of Andrade & Rey Fenix. The TLC match started with all 5 teams attacking the Wyatt Sicks' Dexter Lumis & Joe Gacy. But before long, it was every team for themselves. And at long last, the Wyatt 6 won by retrieving the title belts and retaining their WWE Tag Team Championship.The third match-up of the night was Becky Lynch vs. Lyra Valkyria for the WWE Women's Intercontinental Championship title. Both women put on power-packed performances, and their third wheel, Bayley, also made a surprise entry.

And finally, Tala Tonga kicked the cage door into Fatu, allowing Sikoa to fall out of it, and retaining his title belt.Dominik Mysterio vs. AJ Styles has been a long time coming, but because Mysterio was missing in action for quite a while due to his injury, it had to be postponed until now. Styles started by smacking Mysterio around, who responded in kind by raining stomps. Mysterio finally hits Styles with the boot and a Frog Splash for the pin and win. Dominik Mysterio is still the WWE Intercontinental Champion. John Cena vs. Cody Rhodes returns for a Street Fight at SummerSlam, and fans have been waiting for this for months. For the sixth time, Cena has returned to main event SummerSlam - which is also his last SummerSlam, this time facing The American Nightmare. In one of the most wholesome moments in Cena's Farewell tour, the fight ended after Rhodes saluted his hero and hit him with a Cross Rhodes to take the win.But it wouldn't be WWE if they didn't have a surprise at the end. And just when it seemed like the night would end on a good note, with the crowd cheering for John Cena, even though he lost, none other than Brock Lesnar showed up.

Hailee Steinfeld flexes her fitness grind in latest photos before Bills’ big year



Hailee Steinfeld embraces balance by letting go of guilt and finding joy in her wellness journey



While Josh Allen ramps up intensity in his second week of training camp with the Buffalo Bills, his wife Hailee Steinfeld is quietly building her own routine — one rooted not in football, but in fitness, mindfulness, and discipline. The Oscar-nominated actress, who stunned fans in three elegant gowns during their wedding weekend at the picturesque San Ysidro Ranch, has been making wellness a personal priority off the red carpet.Even with a demanding schedule, Hailee Steinfeld remains deeply committed to taking care of her body and mind. In her recent Beau Society newsletter, she described emerging from a whirlwind trip to New York City, yet still ensuring her workouts weren’t sacrificed. “I work out to stay fit, but it's almost the last reason I do it anymore,” she wrote candidly. “I love it because it's the only time of day that I can check out entirely. ”Her approach isn't simply about staying camera-ready — it’s about emotional resilience and self-care. The 28-year-old actress, who starred in Sinners, emphasized the mental clarity her workouts provide. “We often work out early so we finish before the rush of the day sets in.But I feel like I've gotten to that place where I move for my mental health.”Her commitment has been supported, both emotionally and physically, by her father Pete Steinfeld — a personal trainer and a key figure in her health journey. In Beau Society’s August 1 issue, titled “The Movement Issue,” Pete was interviewed, offering insight into their shared passion. Hailee wrote, “I never get tired of hearing my dad talk about the thing he loves most in this world: wellbeing.”Hailee Steinfeld also opened up about her past struggles with body image and the guilt that used to accompany indulging in snacks with friends. That mindset has shifted with wisdom and time. “I don't do that anymore because I enjoy sweets and snacks, and the company,” she admitted. But a quote from her father helped anchor this change: “You can't change your body overnight, and you can't mess it up overnight either.”That philosophy — one of balance, consistency, and kindness toward oneself — now defines her outlook.

Brock Lesnar returns to WWE at SummerSlam 2025



Undisputed WWE Championship, Street Fight: John Cena vs. Cody Rhodes was action-packed



Brock Lesnar has been a topic of discussion before every main event in WWE , amid his absence, with speculation of his return to the roster always imminent. Now, the Beast has ended all the speculation once and for all, as he made his big return to the company to deliver an F5 to John Cena , teasing a future fight between the two WWE veterans.In a shocking twist at the end of WWE SummerSlam 2025 – Night 2, Brock Lesnar made his thunderous return to WWE, ending months of speculation about his future. Just moments after Cody Rhodes defeated John Cena in a brutal, action-packed Street Fight to win the Undisputed WWE Championship, Lesnar stormed the scene. He circled the ring like a predator before hoisting Cena onto his shoulders and planting him with a devastating F5.For nearly a year, Lesnar had been absent from WWE programming, fueling rumors about retirement or a possible departure. His name had surfaced in the Janel Grant lawsuit involving Vince McMahon, leading WWE’s top legal brass to pull him from television. As reported by Dave Meltzer, the decision came “at the highest level of the company’s legal department” (per wrestlingnews.co). But with his appearance at MetLife Stadium on August 4, Lesnar reignited his long-time rivalry targeting Cena.The crowd erupted in disbelief as Lesnar's music hit.Cena, still recovering from his emotional torch-passing moment with Rhodes, didn’t see it coming. Lesnar's F5 was a challenge thrown at WWE legend’s legacy.SummerSlam 2025’s second night was already stacked with six championship matches, and the main event did not disappoint. Cody Rhodes and John Cena delivered a violent masterpiece of near-falls, finishers, and raw emotion. Cena used crutches from NBA star Tyrese Haliburton as weapons. Rhodes answered with classic Dusty-style offense, including the Bionic Elbow. Tables shattered. Steel steps flew. Fans were on the edge of their seats when Cena countered a title shot attempt and nearly sealed it with a super AA.But in the end, it was Rhodes who overcame the odds, surviving multiple Attitude Adjustments and finally hitting a flying Cross Rhodes through a table for the pin. Cena, in a rare display of humility, handed over the title and whispered heartfelt words to the new champion.Also Read: WWE SummerSlam 2025 crowd turns hostile as camera caught wild fight between women breaks out during Night Two As fans thought the night had reached its emotional peak, Lesnar's return altered the narrative. “The Beast” didn’t need words, as with his silence, the F5 said it all. Cena’s retirement tour has become more exciting for fans.","Brock Lesnar made his return to WWE at SummerSlam 2025 – Night 2.

Women's Tag Team Championship match



Sami Zayn vs. Karrion Kross

WWE Women's Championship match

Randy Orton and Jelly Roll vs. Drew McIntyre and Logan Paul

World Heavyweight Championship

Night 1 of WWE SummerSlam 2025, held at the MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey saw an electric crowd. For the first time in the history of the event, SummerSlam is a two-night show, and Night 1 saw an audience of 53,161 inside the arena. There were six matches set for the night, and each one had the fans cheering for their favorites.From chants of The OTC to boos for Logan Paul and of course, the main event of the night - CM Punk vs. GUNTHER that everyone was waiting for, the first night of the 38th edition of SummerSlam was a resounding success. With Cardi B hosting the big event, it started off with a bang. And now let's take a look at all the winners and top performers of the night.The opening match of the night was a tag team match between Roman Reigns and Jey Uso , who faced off against Bron Breakker and Bronson Reed. All hell broke loose from the very beginning, as the four opponents were at each other's throats as soon as the bell rang. Reigns missed a chunk of the action at the beginning, before he finally got tagged in. The match ran for over 21 minutes, with Reigns and Uso emerging as the winners.Raquel Rodriguez and Roxanne Perez vs. Charlotte Flair and Alexa Bliss was going to be an explosion of power-packed performance from the very beginning. Bliss and Flair were always the crowd favorite with their reluctant partnership act, and though the Judgment Day duo had a lot of power in them, it wasn't enough to overcome the veterans. The match ended with Charlotte Flair and Alexa Bliss becoming the new WWE Women's Tag Team champions.The first singles match of the night saw Sami Zayn and Karrion Kross come up against each other once again. The tides kept shifting from one side to another for the whole time. And of course, it wouldn't be complete without Scarlett trying to interfere for her partner, this time with a steel pipe, and then distracting the referee. But in this match-up, Zayn managed to take the win over Kross once again after a Helluva Kick to his opponent. Tiffany Stratton vs. Jade Cargill was the shortest match of the night, running for just a little over seven minutes. But both women kept the momentum of the night going with their powerful performances. The current Queen of the Ring challenged Stratton for her title belt, who has yet to lose a match this year. And Stratton showed Cargill why she is the reigning champion, as she managed to retain her belt after yet another title defense.This fight began even before the bell rang, when Logan Paul punched Jelly Roll, leading to a heated exchange between all four wrestlers. The fight was heated, with each one of them trying to gain the upper hand. Roll was almost led off the stage by officials after a splash by Paul turned way too much for the celebrity wrestler. But he came in to help his partner, Randy Orton . Unfortunately, it didn't work for long, and a Claymore Kick from Drew McIntyre and a Fall From Grace frogsplash from Paul, the match ended with Roll taking the pin.The main event of SummerSlam Night 1 saw CM Punk and GUNTHER come face to face for the third title match of the night. With the World Heavyweight Championship title on the line, GUNTHER was not going to have Punk take it away from him that easily. The match continued for more than 30 minutes before CM Punk finally emerged as the winner and the new World Heavyweight Champion of WWE.His emotions after getting the title belt and the tears spoke more than any words could. But the night is yet to end, as Seth Rollins walks in with Paul Heyman, who still has his Money in the Bank briefcase. But Rollins is injured, right? Well, not anymore, as he rushes in after throwing away his crutches and taking off his leg brace, and finally cashes in his MITB briefcase.It was too easy to pin an exhausted Punk, and ladies and gentlemen, Seth Rollins is now the newest World Heavyweight Champion of WWE. The Ruse of the Century indeed. Paul Heyman looks ecstatic, and that's curtains for Night 1 of SummerSlam 2025.Also Read: WWE SummerSlam 2025 (August 02, 2025) Results: Seth Rollins destroys CM Punk's dreams pulling huge ruse to win the World title","Night 1 of WWE SummerSlam 2025, held at the MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey saw an electric crowd.

Why Malik Monk Was in Play

Possible Next Steps for the Kings

Theare aggressively pursuing roster upgrades this offseason, and their latest target -forward- has once again proven elusive. According to The Athletic’s Sam Amick, the Kings made a significant trade proposal involving $77 million guard Malik Monk in a sign-and-trade deal, but the Warriors weren’t sold. Sacramento Kings reportedly offered Jonathan Kuminga a three-year, $63 million contract as part of a sign-and-trade deal. In return, the Warriors would receive:• Malik Monk• A 2030 lottery-protected first-round pickHowever, Golden State declined the deal.“The Warriors rejected this offer due to them wanting an unprotected first-round pick in a trade for Kuminga,” reported Sam Amick of The Athletic.The Golden State Warriors’ firm stance on acquiring an unprotected pick halted the deal, despite interest in Monk’s services.After falling short in the 2024 Play-In Tournament against the Dallas Mavericks, the Kings are determined to break through in the West. They are sticking with their core - Domantas Sabonis, DeMar DeRozan, and Zach LaVine - and making roster tweaks to surround them with talent.• Signed Dennis Schroder in free agency• Drafted Nique Clifford and Maxime Raynaud in the 2025 NBA Draft• Targeted multiple players in free agency• Pursued Jonathan Kuminga via sign-and-tradeThis isn’t the first time the Kings tried to land Jonathan Kuminga . Earlier this offseason, the Golden State Warriors also rejected a package centered around:• Devin Carter• Dario Saric• A protected first-round pickInstead, the Golden State Warriors were said to be more interested in:• Keegan Murray• Keon EllisTheir insistence on stronger assets - particularly unprotected draft capital - has made negotiations difficult.Malik Monk recently signed a four-year, $77 million deal with the Kings. Including him in the Jonathan Kuminga proposal shows Sacramento’s willingness to move key pieces to acquire a versatile forward who fits their system.While Golden State turned down the initial offer, the fact that they are open to acquiring Monk signals potential for future negotiations - especially if the Kings are willing to remove the protection on their 2030 first-round pick.The ball is in Sacramento’s court. If they want to pry Jonathan Kuminga away from the Golden State Warriors, they’ll likely need to return with a stronger offer - one that includes an unprotected pick or a more enticing player package.• Remove protection from the 2030 first-round pick• Include additional assets or prospects• Revisit offers involving Keegan Murray or Keon EllisAlso read: NBA Trade Rumors: San Antonio Spurs Poised for Blockbuster Trade With $52.1 Million in Movable Contracts; What’s in Store?

San Antonio Spurs’ Core Roster Could Be Title-Caliber

Potential Post-Deadline Core

Why San Antonio Is a Team to Watch

Themay not have made headlines with blockbuster trades this offseason, but don’t mistake their quiet approach for inactivity. Behind the scenes, the franchise has built a uniquely flexible financial war chest - one that could unlock a staggering $52.1 million in tradable contracts this season.This opens the door for a potential mid-season splash that could dramatically reshape their roster - and possibly catapult them into playoff contention.Rather than chase high-risk deals in July, the San Antonio Spurs chose a more strategic path. Here’s what they’ve done so far:• Drafted Dylan Harper and Carter Bryant, two promising rookies who add youth and upside.• Signed free agent center Luke Kornet, adding rim protection and depth.• Traded for Kelly Olynyk, a versatile veteran big man.• Added Jordan McLaughlin and Lindy Waters III, bolstering their wing and guard rotation.None of these moves grabbed national headlines, but they were deliberate steps toward building a roster with both talent and financial mobility.While most contenders struggle to match large salaries in trades, the San Antonio Spurs are in a rare position to absorb or exchange massive contracts thanks to a collection of moveable assets:With the exception of Keldon Johnson, all of these players are on expiring deals.That’s music to the ears of front offices looking to clear cap space or reset their payroll without long-term commitments.By combining salaries, the San Antonio Spurs can match nearly any big contract in the league. That puts them in the mix for elite talent if a superstar becomes available before the trade deadline.Jonah Kubicek of FanNation explains: “The Spurs can very easily trade $52.1 million this season, allowing them to possibly add a big-name star like Giannis Antetokounmpo or LeBron James.” (H/t: Athlon Sports)While landing a player of that caliber might seem ambitious, the numbers do line up. The Spurs can build competitive offers without touching their core of young stars.If the San Antonio Spurs do pull the trigger on a major trade, they won’t be doing it from a position of desperation. Their current core is already promising, and any incoming star would be joining a solid foundation:• Victor Wembanyama• De’Aaron Fox• Devin Vassell• Stephon Castle• Jeremy Sochan• Julian Champagnie• Dylan Harper• Carter BryantThat’s a group that could contend sooner than many expected.While most of the league has finalized its rosters for the 2025–26 season, the San Antonio Spurs have left the door open. With flexibility, young talent, and draft capital, they’re in position to strike when the timing is right.Key Reasons the Spurs Can Be Deadline Buyers:• Expiring contracts totaling $52.1 million• Roster full of controllable young talent• No need to include cornerstone players in deals• Ability to add draft picks to outbid rivalsFor now, all signs suggest San Antonio is content to enter the season as constructed. But when the trade market heats up, expect them to be aggressive.Also read: NBA Offseason Rumors: Why the Denver Nuggets Should Have Signed $3.6 Million Los Angeles Clippers; Missed Opportunity to Become Unstoppable? They might not be the loudest team this offseason, but the San Antonio Spurs are absolutely one of the most dangerous.

The Spurs certainly are.",The San Antonio Spurs have not made headlines with blockbuster trades this offseason.

But I feel like those dark places have allowed my light to shine.”In a world where athletes are often expected to be stoic, Brown’s honesty is both rare and powerful. He joins a growing list of NBA players - like DeMar DeRozan and Kevin Love - who’ve publicly addressed mental health, helping dismantle the stigma around vulnerability in sports.Despite winning Finals MVP honors, earning multiple All-Star selections, and signing one of the most lucrative contracts in league history, Brown still wrestles with internal pressures and outside expectations. From swirling trade rumors to the responsibilities of leadership, he acknowledges that the journey hasn’t always been easy.“Naysayers? It’s simply part of the game. Statues aren’t erected for naysayers. They are built for individuals who achieve greatness, you know?”Even with the spotlight on him, Jaylen Brown reminds fans that mental and emotional battles don’t discriminate - success doesn’t make one immune. Jaylen Brown offers words of encouragement to those facing their own emotional struggles: “It’s OK. Never let anything break your spirit. Everybody’s gonna deal with adversity at some point - even plants struggle to get sunlight.”He also highlighted how faith and resilience helped him through his darkest times: “There were nights I didn’t want to get up - but I always did. That’s where my faith came in. Anytime I’ve ever been alone, I’ve filled that space with the Most High.”Jaylen Brown’s reflections go beyond inspiration - they’re a call to stay true to oneself and never confuse borrowed confidence for genuine self-worth: “The moon borrows light from the sun. Yet, people never mistake the two… While the moon may borrow light from the sun, the sun remains the sun, shining every day.”With Jayson Tatum sidelined and veteran players moving on, Brown now shoulders more responsibility than ever before. He’s expected to be more than just a scorer or defender - he’s the emotional backbone of a reconfigured Celtics team entering a transitional phase.“I want the city to feel excited… This is not the end. Looking forward to what’s next.”This next chapter isn’t just about winning games. It’s about how Brown leads with authenticity and transparency, setting the tone both on the court and in the community.Jaylen Brown’s revelations contribute to a broader cultural shift: that mental health isn’t a weakness to hide, but a challenge to face. His message dismantles outdated ideas about toughness in professional sports and redefines what strength truly looks like.His story is a reminder that even those who appear to have it all are still human - and that speaking up, seeking help, and embracing your vulnerability can be the most courageous move of all.Also read: LeBron James' Heartfelt Nod to Luka Doncic’s $165 Million Los Angeles Lakers Contract Extension: A Bond Built for Championship Success If you or someone you know is dealing with anxiety or depression, take heart in Jaylen Brown’s words: darkness can be a beginning, not an end - and light always follows.","Boston Celtics star Jaylen Brown recently opened up about his battle with anxiety and depression.

Themade impressive strides during the 2025 NBA offseason, building upon a championship-caliber core with savvy roster upgrades. However, there’s one glaring move they missed - one that could have solidified them as overwhelming favorites to win it all. While their front office made several smart decisions, they left a key roster hole unaddressed at backup point guard. Denver Nuggets ’ summer moves were largely successful. The team traded away Michael Porter Jr. and brought in Cam Johnson, a player known for his perimeter shooting, defensive acumen, and ability to make plays. Johnson’s versatility is expected to mesh seamlessly with the starting lineup.To reinforce the bench, they added:• Bruce Brown, returning after playing a pivotal role in the 2023 title run.• Tim Hardaway Jr., expected to bring scoring firepower off the bench.• Jonas Valanciunas, acquired via trade, now serves as the most competent backup Nikola Jokic has had in years.Despite these additions, one area still seems vulnerable: the backup point guard position.Veteran point guard Chris Paul was one of the last remaining top names in free agency this summer. At 40, Paul signed with the Los Angeles Clippers, where he spent some of his prime years.The move made headlines more for nostalgia than competitiveness. With a roster full of aging stars like James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, and Bradley Beal, the Clippers became the oldest team in NBA history, averaging 33.2 years of age.“Paul is 40 years old and joins a team with James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Nic Batum, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Brook Lopez, and Bradley Beal , all of whom are well into their 30s,” wrote Bailey Bassett for ClutchPoints.Paul’s decision made sense in terms of legacy and sentiment - but from a championship perspective, Denver would have been a far better fit.The Denver Nuggets were arguably the team closest to knocking off the rising Oklahoma City Thunder in the 2025 playoffs, despite being riddled with injuries. With Nikola Jokic, arguably the most cerebral and unselfish player in the NBA, Paul would’ve had a rare opportunity to play alongside someone who mirrors his basketball IQ and elite passing vision.Pairing Paul with scorers and athletic finishers like Jamal Murray, Christian Braun, and Aaron Gordon could have made Denver’s second unit nearly unstoppable.Paul is still chasing the one thing that has eluded him: an NBA championship. Had he joined Denver, the odds of him ending his career on a high note would’ve significantly improved.- Elite basketball IQ and passing- Jokic’s compatibility with smart guards- Depth behind Jamal Murray- Mentorship for young guards like Jalen Pickett- Opportunity to finally win a titleRussell Westbrook revived his game with Denver last season, averaging:His improved three-point shooting and high energy were assets off the bench, but he declined his player option for 2025-26 and has since been linked to the Sacramento Kings. His departure, coupled with Chris Paul’s unavailability, leaves Denver with just Jalen Pickett as the only true backup point guard.One logical solution could be Malcolm Brogdon. The former Rookie of the Year has scored in double digits in each of his nine NBA seasons and offers steadiness at the position. However, his health is a concern. Brogdon appeared in just 24 games last year and 39 the year prior.Still, Denver’s system doesn’t require a heavy-minute backup for Jamal Murray. Brogdon could be a situational option, with Bruce Brown filling in as a combo guard and Pickett continuing to develop.The Denver Nuggets’ 2025 offseason was undeniably strong, but the decision to not pursue Chris Paul may come back to haunt them. With one roster spot remaining, Denver still has a chance to plug the gap, but they missed out on one of the smartest possible fits for a deep playoff run.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors Reportedly Want This 1 Thing From the Sacramento Kings in a Jonathan Kuminga Deal If Denver wants to maximize the remaining peak years of Jokic and Murray, resolving the backup point guard situation should be a top priority before the season tips off.","The Denver Nuggets were arguably the team closest to knocking off the rising Oklahoma City Thunder in the 2025 playoffs, despite being riddled with injuries.

Public relations risk keeps teams like Oilers away from Carter Hart amid unresolved eligibility

The NHL future of Carter Hart remains shrouded in uncertainty, even after his acquittal in the high-profile Hockey Canada sexual assault case. While fans continue to debate whether the former Philadelphia Flyers goalie deserves another shot on the ice, NHL insider Elliotte Friedman has strongly advised against making any assumptions.Speaking on his 32 Thoughts podcast, Friedman addressed the growing speculation around Hart’s potential return to the league. Despite being found not guilty along with four other players in the 2018 Hockey Canada case, Hart’s status remains unresolved in the eyes of the NHL.“I think it is really irresponsible to speculate until we have a legal ruling on this,” Friedman said. “I don’t think anything more needs to be said about that until we know if they're eligible to play. I just don't think it's smart to speculate on where they could play.”The NHL has made it clear that acquittal does not equate to reinstatement. The league released a statement acknowledging that the players’ behavior—though not criminally punishable—was still “very disturbing” and “unacceptable.” The league added that it would be “reviewing and considering the judge's findings” before making any decisions about eligibility.While Hart is technically an unrestricted free agent, teams are hesitant. Analyst Avry Lewis-McDougall shut down rumors linking Hart to the Edmonton Oilers during the Fanatics View Hockey Show, stating bluntly: “It’s a hard no.” He cited both the unresolved nature of Hart’s status and the inevitable media firestorm.“Teams don’t want the PR headache,” he said. “You should be looking at somebody you can bring in with less baggage.”With the Oilers needing a reliable goalie after two consecutive Stanley Cup Final losses, Lewis-McDougall emphasized that Hart’s off-ice issues make him an unsuitable option—even if he’s cleared to return.For now, Carter Hart’s road back to the NHL remains a legal, ethical, and reputational maze.Also Read: “Keep it real and sensible”: Carey Price’s wife Angela responds to Sydney Sweeney’s American Eagle ad backlash",Elliotte Friedman says it's 'irresponsible' to speculate on Carter Hart's NHL future.

Should Bruins TRADE Pavel Zacha? | Bruins Beat

Connor McDavid’s uncertain future has the entire NHL holding its breath

As NHL free agency and trade talks ramp up, one name continues to dominate every rumor mill—Connor McDavid. With his contract situation still unresolved in Edmonton, speculation is heating up across the league. Among the teams linked to the Oilers captain, the Boston Bruins have now entered the conversation—and some local media believe a potential McDavid deal could change everything.During the August 1 episode of Bruins Beat, reporters Evan Marinofsky and Conor Ryan briefly entertained the fantasy of Connor McDavid wearing a black and gold jersey. Marinofsky tossed out the question, “What if McDavid ended up with the Bruins?” Ryan’s response was immediate and emphatic: “I mean, they’d win a cup. They would, yeah.”That may sound like a stretch—but Ryan doubled down. Calling McDavid “the easiest cheat code,” he drew a parallel to another generational athlete: “I think McDavid is so dominant now that he’s kind of like LeBron during his prime, right? Where, like just him alone, you’re going to be in the third round if not in the final.”Ryan also acknowledged the financial weight that a McDavid contract would carry—likely in the ballpark of $15.5 to $16 million per year, a new NHL record.Yet he argued that even at that cost, McDavid would be worth every penny.After another playoff letdown for the Oilers in June, McDavid’s long-term commitment to Edmonton has come under question. The 2024 Conn Smythe winner has recorded at least 90 points in all nine of his NHL seasons—yet remains without a Stanley Cup. His contract talks have reportedly stalled, and the league is taking notice.McDavid made his priorities clear in a recent interview: “Winning is the most important thing… If I feel there’s a good window to win here over and over again, then signing is no problem.” That statement leaves the door open for other franchises—like the Bruins—to make their pitch. Whether Boston is a serious contender or just a fan-fueled fantasy, one thing is certain: until McDavid re-signs, the NHL rumor machine won’t slow down.Also Read: Connor McDavid to the Maple Leafs?

Why re-signing Mattias Ekholm should be the Oilers’ top priority before the 2025 season begins,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/why-re-signing-mattias-ekholm-should-be-the-oilers-top-priority-before-the-2025-season-begins/articleshow/123078707.cms,"Mattias Ekholm’s contract extension may become Oilers' biggest gamble of the offseason (Postmedia)

The Oilers have a Mattias Ekholm dilemma that could define their championship window moving forward



The Edmonton Oilers face a crucial decision on Mattias Ekholm's future

Edmonton’s depth chart is a looming concern



As the Edmonton Oilers prepare for a crucial offseason, all eyes are on how the franchise handles its impending free agents, most notably, captain Connor McDavid and defensive stalwart Mattias Ekholm. While McDavid’s situation commands top billing, the decision surrounding Ekholm’s future could very well determine how competitive the Oilers remain over the next few seasons.Since arriving from Nashville in February 2023, Ekholm has brought stability, composure, and elite-level poise to Edmonton’s blue line. That midseason acquisition remains one of the savviest trade deadline moves in recent Oilers history. However, his recent playoff run—marred by injury and underwhelming performances—has raised concerns. “Single events can have enormous importance in a game, series, and season while also being single events. ” That sentiment lingers as management evaluates whether Ekholm's decline was circumstantial or indicative of long-term decline.Despite a dip in form during the 2024 postseason, metrics and deployment patterns tell a deeper story.Ekholm led the team in five-on-five minutes against elite opponents, posting a 57 percent Dangerous Fenwick and 50 percent goal share. His long-standing chemistry with Evan Bouchard, which has yielded a 58 percent Dangerous Fenwick and 55 percent goal share over 777 elite minutes, remains unmatched within the organization.Still, Ekholm’s age—35—and injury history create a legitimate pause. He played sparingly in March and was not at full strength during the Stanley Cup Final. The question becomes not just whether the Oilers should re-sign him, but whether they can afford the risk of letting him go.If the Oilers were confident in their internal options, perhaps they could gamble. But that’s not the case. With Philip Broberg now part of the St. Louis Blues and no immediate replacements emerging from the pipeline, the left side of Edmonton’s defense is vulnerable. Riley Stillman and Cam Dineen are AHL-bound veterans, while promising names like Paul Fischer and Nikita Yevseyev are still years away from NHL readiness.Should the Oilers part ways with Ekholm, Darnell Nurse would likely slot in on the top pair—a scenario that has proven suboptimal. While Jake Walman and Brett Kulak performed admirably last season, they too are entering free agency, potentially leaving a gaping hole.The harsh reality is this: If Ekholm reaches free agency next July, he’s as good as gone. “A contender will gladly give him a multi-year deal.” To avoid that, GM Stan Bowman needs to strike a balance—ideally a two- to three-year contract at around $5 million annually. This would offer Ekholm security while allowing Edmonton to maintain cap flexibility.It’s a calculated risk, yes. But if the Oilers are serious about contending now, it’s a gamble they can’t afford not to take.Also Read: Connor McDavid’s next deal could shatter records, and the Oilers will have $45 million to make it happen","The Edmonton Oilers have a Mattias Ekholm dilemma that could define their championship window moving forward.

The fifth and final Test at The Oval between India and England saw its share of tension, drama, and viral moments. One such moment came late on Day 3 when Zak Crawley once again tried to disrupt rhythm: only this time, Shubman Gill wasn’t biting.During the 13th over of England's chase of 374, Crawley was seen backing away as Mohammed Siraj charged in, attempting to delay the bowler's momentum.On one such occasion, Shubman Gill, standing in the slip cordon, offered only a sly smile, markedly different from his fiery reaction earlier in the series when he had told Crawley to ""grow some f***ing balls"" on the stump mic for similar antics during the Lord's Test.This time, Gill didn’t rise to the bait. But Siraj had the perfect response three balls later.Watch:On the final delivery of the day, Siraj pulled off a stunning setup.After planting the idea of a short ball with the field, he unleashed a late, dipping yorker that snuck under Crawley’s bat and shattered his stumps.Crawley was completely undone, his footwork static, his reaction too late.

Poll Who do you think is the greatest home Test run-scorer of all time? Ricky Ponting Joe Root Sachin Tendulkar Mahela Jayawardene

India (Playing XI):

England (Playing XI):

England's veteran batter Joe Root added another major milestone to his incredible Test career on Day 2 of the fifth Test against India at The Oval. With his 29-run knock, Root went past Sachin Tendulkar to become the third-highest run-scorer in home Tests.Root now has 7,220 runs in England, surpassing Tendulkar’s 7,216 runs in India. Only Ricky Ponting (7,578 in Australia) and Mahela Jayawardene (7,167 in Sri Lanka) remain ahead of Root among the top home Test run-scorers.The former England captain also crossed 2,000 Test runs against India at home, joining an elite list. Only Don Bradman has more runs against a single opponent in home Tests — 2,354 against England. Root’s consistent run-scoring against India continues to be a major factor in this long-standing rivalry.However, his stay on Friday was cut short by Mohammed Siraj in the 33rd over. Root, who looked in control for much of his innings, was dismissed for 29. Siraj bowled a fuller delivery that straightened slightly, sneaking past Root’s inside edge to crash into the stumps.At the time of his dismissal, England were 175/4 in 33 overs, still trailing India’s first-innings total of 224.Root’s brief knock still had enough impact to push him above some of the game's greats.Yashasvi Jaiswal, KL Rahul, Sai Sudharsan, Shubman Gill(c), Karun Nair, Ravindra Jadeja, Dhruv Jurel(w), Washington Sundar, Akash Deep, Prasidh Krishna, Mohammed SirajZak Crawley, Ben Duckett, Ollie Pope(c), Joe Root, Harry Brook, Jacob Bethell, Jamie Smith(w), Chris Woakes, Gus Atkinson, Jamie Overton, Josh Tongue","Joe Root becomes third-highest run-scorer in home Tests with 7,220 runs in England.

NEW DELHI: Soniya, the 34-year-old woman who allegedly hired a relative to kill her husband last year, seemed to have maintained an online facade of being a devoted wife who missed him deeply.In one of the videos posted nearly two weeks before her arrest, Soniya embedded a photograph of herself with her late husband, 42-year-old Pritam Prakash, and was seen lip-syncing to a sad song. In another clip, she shared a collage of their pictures together. An old video posted in March showed her playing Holi with him.""This was done to maintain a social profile suggesting she missed her husband and portray the image of a ‘devoted' wife before the public,"" an investigator said.According to police, after filing a missing person complaint regarding her husband at Alipur police station in northwest Delhi last year, Soniya regularly visited the station, inquired about updates on the case and even broke down often.The investigator added that after the murder, Soniya went on outings in the city with her alleged lover, Rohit, whom she met in 2023-24 on social media. ""What we found was that she was not able to write, so she used speech-to-text to reply in social media chats,"" police said.Soniya married Pritam at the age of 16, and the couple had three children. Their relationship was said to be troubled due to Prakash's drug addiction, violent behaviour and a criminal record with 10 cases. Seeing her husband as an obstacle to marrying Rohit, she plotted to eliminate him.She allegedly paid Vijay, her sister's brother-in-law, to kill Prakash and dispose of the body near Agwanpur village, near Sonipat, where the sister lives. Sonya also went to the village with Prakash.After she returned home in Alipur, locals repeatedly asked her about Prakash. Feeling the pressure, she filed a complaint on July 20, 2024, claiming he went missing during the night of July 5-6.The body was recovered from a drain in Gannaur on July 10 last year and a murder case was registered. Vijay later sent Soniya a news article about the unidentified body. Police plan to match the DNA of the recovered body with that of the children or other relatives of the deceased.Police have also arrested Rohit, the alleged lover. Vijay was earlier arrested in a theft case and is currently lodged in a Haryana jail. Rohit, who has four prior criminal cases, including on charges of murder and arms violations, worked as a private cab driver between Sonipat and Delhi. He married this April, but continued his relationship with Soniya.","Soniya, 34, allegedly hired a relative to kill her husband, 42-year-old Pritam Prakash.

Wimbledon 2025 winner Iga Swiatek suffers shock exit at Canadian Open; Ben Shelton rallies into quarters in Toronto,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/wimbledon-2025-winner-iga-swiatek-suffers-shock-exit-at-canadian-open-ben-shelton-rallies-into-quarters-in-toronto/articleshow/123086557.cms,"Iga Swiatek (Christinne Muschi/The Canadian Press via AP)

Wimbledon champion Iga Swiatek became the latest high-profile casualty at the WTA Canadian Open on Sunday, falling 7-6 (7/1), 6-3 to Denmark’s Clara Tauson in the fourth round. Swiatek, seeded second in Montreal, followed top seed Coco Gauff, third seed Jessica Pegula, and fourth seed Mirra Andreeva in exiting early from the tournament.Swiatek, playing her first event since winning her sixth Grand Slam title at Wimbledon, looked out of rhythm and faltered in key moments. Tauson dominated the first set tiebreak and sealed the win after Swiatek's backhand found the net.Tauson, who avenged her Wimbledon loss to Swiatek, called the win “unreal.”“Obviously it's really great and it shows all the hard work I've been doing has been the right thing,” she said. “I'm getting more confidence in this kind of level and feeling like I belong here a bit more. I think that really helped me today in the important points.”She now faces Madison Keys, who saved two match points in her gritty 4-6, 6-3, 7-5 win over Karolina Muchova.“I'm really happy to get that win,” Keys told the crowd. “After losing the first set and even being match point down, being able to figure it out -- it's always a great day.”Meanwhile, Naomi Osaka surged into her first WTA 1000 quarterfinal since 2024, thrashing Anastasija Sevastova 6-1, 6-0 in just 49 minutes. Working with former Swiatek coach Tomasz Wiktorowski, Osaka said, “He's very direct and to the point. For someone like me, who my thoughts scatter around often, it's very helpful.”On the men’s side at the ATP National Bank Open in Toronto, Ben Shelton dug deep to defeat 13th-seeded Flavio Cobolli 6-4, 4-6, 7-6 (1), rallying from 2-4 down in the deciding set.“Really difficult match. I was down and out, being a break down in the third, the way that he was playing,” Shelton admitted.“I gave myself a second chance and I did a good job with it, kind of running from there… Coming through in the end I think speaks a lot about my mental toughness and my ability to be scrappy in those moments, more so than my actual play.”The 22-year-old, who now has 100 career match wins, will face ninth-seeded Alex de Minaur, a 6-2, 4-6, 6-4 winner over Frances Tiafoe.Elsewhere, sixth seed Andrey Rublev led Alejandro Davidovich Fokina 6-7 (3), 7-6 (2), 3-0 before the Spaniard retired due to exhaustion. Rublev moves on to face the winner of Taylor Fritz vs Jiri Lehecka.With upsets mounting and new stars stepping up, the Canadian Open continues to deliver high drama on both sides of the draw.","Wimbledon champion Iga Swiatek crashes out of the WTA Canadian Open.

Rashee Rice claims he’s changed and accepts responsibility

“I’ve completely changed. You have to learn from things like that. I’ve learned…”

In early August 2025, Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Rashee Rice spoke for the first time since a viral hit‑and‑run crash on a Dallas highway in March 2024. Rumors were there about his upcoming punishment. In his public remarks at Kansas City Chiefs training camp, Rice hinted at deep change without revealing full details. His words left reporters and fans wondering how this star plans to move forward while facing legal and league consequences.Rashee Rice pleaded guilty on July 17, 2025 to two third‑degree felonies: collision involving serious bodily injury and racing on a highway causing injury.He admitted to driving a Lamborghini Urus at 119 mph on U.S. Highway 75 (North Central Expressway) in Dallas, Texas, which caused a six-car chain-reaction crash. He also fled the scene on foot without checking on the injured.Rice was sentenced to five years of deferred probation and 30 days in jail, which he may serve at any time during that probation period. He has already paid over $115,000 in medical restitution and settled one civil suit for approximately $1.086 million.At Chiefs training camp in St. Joseph, Missouri on August 2, 2025, Rice addressed the crash again, stating:He added that he would continue working within his means to make sure everyone impacted will be made whole and urged people to drive safe.Rice’s attorney, Royce West, also spoke out, noting the jail time will be served across the probation period and that Rice plans to turn himself in responsibly.Former prosecutors explained that because Rice has deferred adjudication, the case may be dismissed if he completes probation successfully.Meanwhile, the NFL is reviewing the case and a multi-game suspension is expected. Chiefs coach Andy Reid confirmed that Rice will take part in training camp and preseason drills, though any regular-season participation may depend on league discipline.","Rashee Rice pleaded guilty on July 17, 2025 to two third‑degree felonies: collision involving serious bodily injury and racing on a highway causing injury.

Seth Rollins took away CM Punk's moment of glory at WWE SummerSlam 2025

The Best in the World, CM Punk returned to WWE SummerSlam for the second time since making his return to WWE in 2023. He fought against the dominant Ring General, Gunther, with the World Heavyweight Championship on the line. The epic main event showdown was a sight to witness at the first-ever two-night SummerSlam event. However, as the dust settled on SummerSlam, it was the ultimate heist pulled by his arch-rival, Seth Rollins , who arrived and took away all of Punk's dreams at the Biggest Party of the Summer.CM Punk and Gunther began with a series of lock-ups and punches to establish early dominance. As the match started to pick up pace, Gunther began to gain the upper hand on the Second City Saint. However, Punk came back with his series of moves, showcasing his veteran status on The Ring General. He came back on multiple occasions, realising the high stakes of the bout; however, Gunther himself did not back down from the former WWE Champion.The match was an amazing display of in-ring action and went outside the squared circle. Moreover, a spot at the announcer's desk saw Gunther being busted open and covered in his own blood for the first time in his career.Despite that, he tried to lock in the sleeper hold, but Punk countered it.With Gunther wobbling on his feet, CM Punk took the opportunity to connect with two GTS and cover him for the three count to win the World Heavyweight Championship for the first time in over a decade in WWE. Just as Punk was celebrating his title win, Seth Rollins' music hit, and he made his appearance on the ramp in clutches with Paul Heyman holding his Money in the Bank briefcase.He walked back, only to drop his clutches, shock the fans, and charge towards the ring. He took out Punk and cashed in his contract, connecting with a thunderous Stomp and snatching the World title from his heated rival, outsmarting everyone who thought he was injured.Also read: WWE SummerSlam 2025: Is Cody Rhodes turning Heel against John Cena?

WWE SummerSlam 2025 kicked off Saturday night at MetLife Stadium, marking the first-ever two-night edition of the event. Night 1 featured six high-stakes matches packed with drama, surprises, and chaos, setting the stage for an electric Night 2. Here’s a quick look at the results, injuries, and standout moments from Night 1.The biggest winner from the night was undoubtedly Seth Rollins, who pulled off another shocking heist of the century as he returned and cashed in his Money in the Bank contract on CM Punk to win the World Heavyweight title. After a grueling 30-minute main event where Punk defeated Gunther to win the gold, fans thought the show had reached its climax until the unthinkable happened.Rollins’ music hit, sending shockwaves through MetLife Stadium. Limping out with crutches and a knee brace, ‘The Visionary’ appeared to confirm the injury that had sidelined him for weeks. But in a stunning twist, he threw the crutches aside, ripped off the brace, and sprinted to the ring, revealing it was all a setup.Seizing the moment, Rollins cashed in his Money in the Bank briefcase on an exhausted Punk, unleashed a vicious assault, and pinned his longtime rival to steal the World Heavyweight Championship, closing Night 1 of SummerSlam with one of the most shocking swerves in recent WWE history.Saturday’s SummerSlam action kicked off with Roman Reigns and Jey Uso defeating Bronson Reed and Bron Breakker in a solid opener. The match gained added weight after Rollins’ surprise cash-in later that night. Breakker and Reed will now return as Rollins’ enforcers, possibly targeting tag or mid-card titles.Reigns, with clear unfinished business with Rollins and Paul Heyman, could reenter the title picture anytime. Notably, Reigns protected Uso during the match, hinting at either a renewed leadership role or passing the torch.Jey looks poised for another main event run on Raw, possibly building toward a future Reigns vs. Rollins showdown. The match delivered several memorable moments, with Reigns’ dive being a standout from the action-packed bout. It is safe to say that fans definitely love a 265lbs flying ‘OTC’!Drew McIntyre and Logan Paul picked up a big win on Night 1 of WWE SummerSlam, defeating country star Jelly Roll and Randy Orton in a high-energy tag match. The bout featured wild moments, including Paul diving off the top rope through the announce table onto Jelly Roll. The spot was brutal and probably the most shocking celebrity bump in recent memory.The singer fired back with clotheslines and a chokeslam, but Paul sealed the win with a second splash for the pin. Despite the loss, Triple H confirmed post-show that Jelly Roll will be back for more WWE appearances.Another highlight of SummerSlam Night 1 saw Charlotte Flair and Alexa Bliss capture the WWE Women’s Tag Team Titles from Roxanne Perez and Raquel Rodriguez. After a rocky start to her 2025 return, Flair has found her footing, thanks in large part to her alliance with Bliss. The duo has quickly become the most popular women’s tag team in WWE, and their chemistry has elevated both their characters and the division.Though their partnership may not have been the original plan, Flair and Bliss have fully embraced the storyline, turning it into a major success. With two decorated champions now holding the titles, the women’s tag division feels more important than ever.In what was a shocking result, Tiffany Stratton beat Jade Cargill to retain her WWE Women’s title. The company has largely protected Cargill since her debut, booking her as a dominant force with few clean losses. After steamrolling her way to the 2025 Queen of the Ring crown, she seemed poised to dethrone Stratton.Instead, Cargill shockingly lost clean in just seven minutes, as ‘The Buff Barbie’ continued her dominant run as the champion, looking more untouchable than ever. The loss leaves Cargill in a tough spot. She won her feud with Naomi, only to see her move to Raw and capture the Women’s World Championship, while Cargill is now left reeling on SmackDown without momentum or direction.In one of the night’s least well-received matches, Karrion Kross fell short yet again, losing to Sami Zayn in a brief and underwhelming bout. After months of claiming he could unleash the darkness within Zayn, Kross failed to deliver, both in the ring and in the story. Despite the build, the match did little to elevate either man and left Kross looking like a clear loser.Whether intentional or not, the angle felt more like a burial than a breakthrough for the former NXT Champion. While it reinforced Zayn’s image as a perennial baby face, that point had already been made far more effectively during his post-WrestleMania feud with Seth Rollins.As mentioned, the night started with Roman Reigns teaming up with Jey Uso to face the formidable duo of Bron Breakker and Bronson Reed. However, Breakker may have suffered an injury during the explosive bout.After the match, Breakker was seen limping and needed assistance backstage, sparking concern among fans. The injury reportedly occurred during a high-flying move targeting Reigns and Uso. Later in the night, during Seth Rollins' cash-in, Breakker’s right leg appeared heavily bandaged, further fueling speculation about the severity of the issue.Ahead of his WWE in-ring debut, Jelly Roll revealed in an interview with ESPN that he suffered an injury during his very first week of training. The four-time Grammy nominee shared that he broke his pinky early on, calling the experience a constant collision. Despite the setback, Roll pushed through and made an impressive outing on Night 1 of the PLE.Also read: Seth Rollins Stuns CM Punk with Another “Heist of the Century” to Capture World Heavyweight Title at SummerSlam 2025 In what was thought to be a serious knee injury, Seth Rollins fooled everyone and scripted history by plotting a master scheme to win the World Heavyweight title to close the show.","WWE SummerSlam 2025 kicked off Saturday night at MetLife Stadium, marking the first-ever two-night edition of the event.

Triple H opens up on Brock Lesnar changing WWE’s landscape on the SummerSlam post-show

Triple H fulfills John Cena’s wish of having Brock Lesnar in his retirement tour



John Cena and Brock Lesnar: a rich history of two wrestling icons



FULL MATCH - John Cena vs. Brock Lesnar - WWE Title Match: SummerSlam 2014

The WWE landscape shifted dramatically at the end of SummerSlam 2025 as Brock Lesnar made a stunning return after nearly two years. ‘The Beast Incarnate’ stormed the ring moments after John Cena’s emotional 37-minute battle against Cody Rhodes, which ended in defeat. Just as Cena appeared to be taking a final bow, Lesnar’s music hit. He charged in and dropped his former rival with a brutal F5 to close the show. Lesnar's return is shocking considering his controversy after being named in the Jalen Grant assault lawsuit alongside Vince McMahon. But it seems that the new regime under Triple H is ready for the former 10-time WWE title holder to wreak havoc once again.On the SummerSlam post-show, WWE CCO Triple H addressed Lesnar’s return and revealed what he thought about the former 10-time World title holder.“My reaction was exactly what I thought it was gonna be, which was, if there had been a roof on this place, it wouldn't be here anymore. The dynamic in the room in WWE changes when The Beast is here.""He added, ""Seeing Brock Lesnar come back, anything that you thought was happening sort of all goes out the window because the factor of Brock now just changes that dynamic so incredibly. It makes it unpredictable.""In a more surprising reveal, ‘The Game’ also revealed that Cena essentially wanted Lesnar to feature in his retirement tour, considering their legendary history in the WWE.“You know you have a finite number of dates on John Cena. You have a finite number of big matches and big moments, and incredible things you wanna do. And you wanna get to the majority of them. You can’t get to everything, but as I said in the beginning, sort of for me, this is John Cena’s wishlist. It’s him writing the last chapter of his book.”The WWE CCO further added, “It’s about John being able to go out the way that he wants to, to write his chapter. One of the very first things I said to him was, ‘Who do you want? Who do you want and how?’ And we’re working through that.”With only four months and a couple of dates remaining in Cena’s final year in wrestling, the addition of ‘The Beast Incarnate’ as a potential opponent has certainly added more to the stakes. It will be interesting to see when these two titans collide.For those unfamiliar, Brock Lesnar and John Cena share a storied history that dates back to their early days in WWE. Both were part of the legendary 2002 Ohio Valley Wrestling class, which also produced Batista and Randy Orton. They debuted on the main roster around the same time and first clashed for the WWE Championship at Backlash 2003.Lesnar’s departure from WWE in 2004 opened the door for Cena to rise as the face of the company throughout the next decade. When Lesnar made his thunderous return in 2012, their rivalry reignited, first in a brutal match at Extreme Rules 2012, and then again at SummerSlam 2014.Also read: Brock Lesnar ends speculation, returns to SummerSlam 2025 to F5 John Cena That SummerSlam showdown became iconic, as Lesnar dismantled Cena with a record-breaking 16 German suplexes, birthing his now-infamous “Suplex City” persona and crowning him WWE World Heavyweight Champion once more.","Triple H opens up on Brock Lesnar changing WWE's landscape on the SummerSlam post-show. ‘The Beast Incarnate’ stormed the ring moments after John Cena’s emotional 37-minute battle against Cody Rhodes, which ended in defeat.

A wildcard entry into the 2025 FIDE Grand Swiss, one of the brutal gateways to the 2026 Candidates Tournament and ultimately, the World Championship.With Nigeria’s Tennyson Ewomazino Olisa, Chile’s Cristobal Henriquez Villagra, and France’s Jules Moussard already filling three of the four continental spots for Grand Swiss 2025, Pranav completes the list by securing the final one through a special wildcard match.The match, which FIDE later dubbed the ‘Asian Wildcard Match’, was so low-profile, it caught even the teenager GM off guard.“It was very surprising because I thought, okay, this year I’m not going to play in the Grand Swiss,” Pranav, who attained the Grandmaster (GM) title in 2022, told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview.“But suddenly, I got this mail from the Asian Chess Federation (ACF) saying they wanted to organise a match for the wild card. And yeah, that’s how it happened.”The stakes, however, were immense. The top two finishers in the Grand Swiss would qualify directly for the 2026 Candidates Tournament, the final eight-player gauntlet before the World Chess Championship match against D Gukesh.Pranav had missed the Grand Swiss cut on rating by a whisker. But fate, and a secretive opportunity, came calling.“For the FIDE Grand Swiss, I should have qualified by rating. But in the exact month when they took the qualification, my rating dropped a bit,” the 2597-rated player said.Organised by the ACF, the match was a two-day sprint using the same time control as the Grand Swiss: 100 minutes for 40 moves, 50 for the next 20, and 15 for the remainder. Pranav had never played a format quite like it.“First of all, this time control, I have never played such a long time control. Also, I have never played a match like this, where it’s just like a knockout, you play two games,” he explained.“I just did the normal stuff: with Black I tried to be very solid, and with White I was trying to win. That worked… I drew the first game with Black quite easily. And the second game, it was a long one: a rook endgame, which is always not that easy. We both made some mistakes… but yes, he made the final mistake.”That mistake would pave the way for Pranav’s Grand Swiss debut in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, from September 3 to 16.It will be an 11-round Swiss format behemoth featuring 116 of the world’s best in the Open section alone. Besides the two coveted spots in the 2026 Candidates, it will also feature a massive $625,000 prize pool.With the wildcard, Pranav joins a stacked Indian lineup that includes World Champion D Gukesh, Arjun Erigaisi, and R Praggnanandhaa. International heavyweights like Alireza Firouzja, Ian Nepomniachtchi, and Anish Giri will also be in the fray.But the 18-year-old from Chennai walks in with perhaps the most unexpected invitation and the least to lose.“This year’s Grand Swiss is very strong, and I’ll just try to perform my best,” Pranav said. “In the next few tournaments I’m playing, I’ll be looking to improve my rating and try to play my best. That will be my aim going forward.”One minute, he was off the list. The next, stepping out of a white Benz in the middle of the UAE heat, earning his seat at one of the most important, prestigious tournaments of his young career.Out of nowhere? Perhaps. But make no mistake; Pranav V is ready for the spotlight.","Pranav Venkatesh, 18, is the newly crowned 2025 World Junior Champion.
