“Make his day miserable”: Travis Kelce reveals how NFL teams might target Travis Hunter with brutal endurance strategy this season,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/make-his-day-miserable-travis-kelce-reveals-how-nfl-teams-might-target-travis-hunter-with-brutal-endurance-strategy-this-season/articleshow/122274434.cms,"Travis Kelce anticipates NFL teams will strategically target Jacksonville Jaguars rookie Travis Hunter (Image via MARCA, LAPRESSE)

Why Travis Kelce thinks teams will try to wear Travis Hunter down — literally

Deion Sanders says Travis Hunter won’t tire out — and the NFL might be easier

Jacksonville Jaguars rookie Travis Hunter is drawing praise—and strategic concern—from NFL stars like Travis Kelce . As Hunter prepares to play both offense and defense, Kelce shared a blunt take on how teams might handle the challenge: wear him out. On a recent podcast, the Chiefs tight end detailed how opponents could exploit Hunter’s two-way role with relentless, exhausting tactics.During a candid appearance on the Bussin’ With the Boys podcast, Travis Kelce was asked if he believed Hunter — a rare two-way player — could succeed in today’s NFL. Without hesitation, Kelce responded, “Hell yes, 100%. World class athlete. ... I saw him play basketball and I was like, ‘Oh yeah, he’s an athlete.’”While Kelce expressed admiration for Hunter’s elite skillset, he also pointed out the reality of how NFL defenses might handle such a versatile weapon. Hunter, who plays both wide receiver and cornerback, could become a prime target for physical and mental fatigue.“Both sides? That's the thing, I don't know how they're going to divy it out,” Kelce explained. “I don't know, because teams are going to be going after him. They're gonna try and make his day miserable. If he plays corner, they're gonna run deep balls at him all day... just to try to get him tired. Why wouldn't you just attack him that way?""It’s a ruthless but realistic outlook from one of the game’s most intelligent players.NFL teams are known for exploiting matchups and wearing down opponents over the course of four quarters — and in Hunter’s case, playing over 100 snaps per game would make him especially vulnerable.Hunter’s incredible stamina was on full display at Colorado, where he averaged 118 snaps per game. His college coach, Deion Sanders, believes the slower tempo of the NFL might actually help his star pupil manage the physical toll.While the Jaguars have primarily lined Hunter up on offense during OTAs, they’re still committed to developing him as a two-way threat. Whether he can thrive on both sides consistently remains to be seen — but Kelce’s comments hint at the mental chess match already forming around the rookie.Also Read: Gracie Hunt shares rare look at romance with Derek Green during scenic honeymoon getaway Chiefs fans will get their first look at Hunter’s NFL adaptability when Kansas City faces Jacksonville on October 6.

Stefon Diggs and Cardi B are enjoying their new romance and were recently spotted walking hand in hand as they exited a swanky club in Paris. While their romance has turned heads, Stefon Diggs and Cardi B have been rumoured to be dating since last year, when the New England Patriots’ star found himself in a huge scandal.In October 2024, an entertainment marketing manager, Chris Blake Griffith, had accused Stefon Diggs of sexually assaulting him.According to reports, Chris Blake Griffith had also filed a lawsuit against Stefon Diggs’ younger brother, Darez Diggs, as he attacked Griffith in an elevator to “silence” him.Shockingly, Chris Blake Griffith did not make any social media post about it but his comment under a post discussing the case had gone viral.Chris Blake Griffith’s comment read as, “The derivative of all this s*it is that Stefon tried to drug me and then have s*x w/ me, and I escaped unscathed (THANK YOU JESUS+) but I now knew his “secret” and that didn’t sit well w/ him.”The comment added, “Weeks later after his failed s*xual attempt on me (bc I don’t play like that and never have), Marsean (Digg’s half-brother) realized that I was no longer affiliated w/ his half-brother, and because he’s broke.”At this point in time, the rumours between Stefon Diggs and Cardi B were starting to pick up with many fans accusing the Grammy winner of cheating on her ex husband, Offset, with the NFL star.However, neither Stefon Diggs nor Cardi B accepted their relationship back then and even went on to deny it.Now, for the accusations that Chris Blake Griffith had levied on Stefon Diggs, even though Griffith had assured he had evidence for all the things, there has been no lawsuit filed against the NFL star.Stefon Diggs also never commented on the incident in public and seems to have moved on from it.Currently, Stefon Diggs has put all his mind on training for the upcoming season as he recently signed a deal with the New England Patriots.

Tom Brady and Sydney Sweeney spark dating buzz, but Skip Bayless ’ wife isn’t having it



I Would've Attended the Bezos Wedding... If Kim Kardashian Invited Me

Ever since Tom Brady’s divorce from supermodel Gisele Bündchen, the NFL legend has found himself at the center of nearly every tabloid’s dating rumor mill. Whether he’s at a gala, an afterparty, or even a dinner, the seven-time Super Bowl champion can't seem to escape whispers of romance—especially when photographed near a single female celebrity. The latest chapter in this saga unfolded at Jeff Bezos' lavish $25 million wedding, where Brady was seen casually chatting with actress Sydney Sweeney The interaction, which reportedly stretched into the early hours of the morning, had social media buzzing and sparked a flurry of headlines suggesting a potential romance. But sources close to Sweeney were quick to dismiss the gossip. “Sweeney is focused on her career and enjoying life,” insiders revealed to Page Six, stressing that dating isn’t her current priority.While fans speculated wildly—even bringing up the noticeable 20-year age gap between the 47-year-old Brady and 27-year-old Sweeney—one person wasn’t buying into any of it: Ernestine Sclafani, wife of sports personality Skip Bayless.Speaking on The Skip Bayless Show, Sclafani didn’t hold back her criticism. She questioned Brady’s presence at the Bezos wedding altogether, expressing bewilderment over the media’s obsession with the event and the guest list.“Why are these people showing up? Why is Tom Brady there? Why is Tom Brady hanging out with—I can’t even think of her name now—Sweeney, what’s her name? Sweeney? Sydney Sweeney?” she asked, clearly exasperated.“They stayed at the bar. They closed the bar. They were there till two or three in the morning,” she added, echoing the kind of disbelief many viewers might have shared about the spectacle being blown out of proportion.Her comments highlighted a growing weariness with the culture of sensationalism that surrounds even the most harmless celebrity interactions. “Why is this so in everybody's face? I don't know why. When I look, I can't get away from it,” she remarked. “And I read every entertainment magazine that I get. And everywhere I look, the whole weekend was bombarded with who went to the wedding.”Sweeney, who recently ended her engagement to Jonathan Davino, has since reiterated that she is focusing on herself and her professional life. In a candid interview with The Times, she stated, “I am not dating anyone... I’m learning about myself, spending time with friends, and trying new experiences.”Meanwhile, Brady—still co-parenting his children with Bündchen—has remained tight-lipped about his romantic life. Despite being linked over the past year to high-profile women like Irina Shayk, Kim Kardashian, and Reese Witherspoon, none of the rumors have stood the test of time.While the Brady-Sweeney speculation appears to be just another fleeting rumor, the public fascination with celebrity pairings shows no signs of slowing down.

Aaron Rodgers’ family estrangement deepens again as biographer reveals heartbreaking communication breakdown,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/aaron-rodgers-family-estrangement-deepens-again-as-biographer-reveals-heartbreaking-communication-breakdown/articleshow/122267203.cms,"Aaron Rodgers' strained relationship with his family continues (Getty Images)

Aaron Rodgers blames family for betrayal and shuts the door on reconciliation

Aaron Rodgers may be building a new chapter with his wife Brittani, but behind his high-profile life remains a longstanding emotional wound—one that still hasn’t healed. The NFL veteran's strained relationship with his family has been one of the sport's most talked-about yet mysterious personal stories. Now, new details have emerged shedding light on how close the Rodgers family came to reconciliation—only to drift apart again.In an exclusive interview with Us Weekly, Rodgers’ biographer Ian O’Connor revealed that a brief moment of hope occurred in the fall of 2024. “In the early fall of 2024, there were a couple of hopeful emails exchanged between Aaron and his parents,” O’Connor said. But that flicker of peace didn’t last. “By the end of the 2024 football season, the tone of their communication had changed and that cautious optimism about a potential reconciliation faded. ”This isn’t just a case of a football star avoiding family dinners. O’Connor explained that the estrangement spans over a decade and trickled down to Rodgers’ brothers, Luke and Jordan. At the heart of the family fracture was a deep divide over religion and personal values.Rodgers reportedly never connected with his parents’ evangelical faith, which they built their lives around in Chico, California. Instead, his worldview began to evolve during his college years at UC Berkeley.“Aaron questioned and challenged everything,” O’Connor noted. “He even questioned the role of his family in his life and came to believe that some family members were laying claim to his fortune and fame.” That belief system led to what O’Connor called “The Island,” where Rodgers isolates people he feels have violated his trust. “If you become a perceived obstacle in his path, you will be removed from his life,” he added.A brief moment of hope occurred in 2023 when Aaron saw his father, Ed, at a celebrity golf tournament and told him, “I love you.” But even that touching gesture wasn’t enough to rebuild a bridge.Most tellingly, during a June 2025 interview on ESPN’s The Pat McAfee Show, Rodgers made it clear where things stood: “I don’t talk to” his family. “They wouldn’t know any information about me.”Also Read: Will Donald Trump become the unlikely savior of the Washington Commanders’ stadium comeback?

Arun Subramanian: The Indian-origin judge who oversaw Sean 'Diddy' Comb's trial - with poise and calm,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/arun-subramanian-the-indian-origin-judge-who-oversaw-sean-diddy-combs-trial-with-poise-and-calm/articleshow/122251411.cms,"



In courtroom 110 at 500 Pearl Street, New York, where the tragic theatre of power and predation played out in the People v. Sean Combs, it was Arun Subramanian who presided with quiet firmness. A judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Subramanian, appointed by President Joe Biden in 2023, has quickly acquired a reputation as both disciplinarian and moderniser — a combination that proved essential in one of the highest-profile celebrity trials of the year.Born to Indian immigrants in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Subramanian’s journey to the federal bench is an archetypal immigrant success story, albeit with the particular intellectual brilliance that sets judicial appointees apart. His parents, Tamil Brahmin engineers who migrated to the US in the 1970s, instilled in him a rigorous respect for education and public service. After an undergraduate degree in computer science from Case Western Reserve University, Subramanian pursued law at Columbia, graduating in 2004.His early career followed the standard elite pipeline: clerkships with Gerard Lynch (then of the Southern District of New York), Dennis Jacobs of the Second Circuit, and finally Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court.From there, Subramanian joined Susman Godfrey, a litigation powerhouse, where he became partner. His work ranged from antitrust to civil rights class actions, representing both corporate giants and underdog plaintiffs — a duality that honed his sense of fairness across hierarchies.At 45, Subramanian is one of the youngest judges on the federal bench. But his demeanour, as visible throughout the Diddy trial, carries the weight of self-assured maturity. Reporters described his style as “adaptable yet firm.” When Mark Geragos, Combs’s unofficial legal adviser, referred to the prosecution team as a “six-pack of white women” on his podcast, Subramanian summoned him for a closed-door rebuke, deeming the remark “outrageous” and warning of its implications for the jury selection process.Yet Subramanian is no grandstander. Unlike some federal judges who revel in courtroom performance, he is known to prefer measured exchanges and procedural discipline over rhetorical flourishes. His time as a Ginsburg clerk appears to have instilled in him a deep appreciation for the law’s ability to serve as both shield and sword, depending on its wielders’ intent.In the Diddy trial, where issues of race, sex, celebrity, and violence collided, Subramanian’s challenge was twofold: ensuring the jury’s impartiality despite public spectacle, and balancing the inevitable theatrics of high-profile counsel with the procedural dignity of the court. Observers note that he succeeded — not by imposing an authoritarian grip, but by gently steering proceedings back to decorum each time tempers flared.The trial ended on July 2, 2025, with a verdict that reflected the legal tightrope Subramanian helped maintain. After thirteen hours of deliberation across three days, the jury found Sean Combs not guilty on the major charges of racketeering and sex trafficking, acquitting him of crimes that could have put him away for life. However, they convicted him on two lesser counts of transportation to engage in prostitution under the Mann Act. It was a mixed verdict that left both the prosecution and defence with partial victories, and a public still grappling with the moral complexities revealed in court.Throughout, Subramanian’s rulings and courtroom management ensured that the trial was conducted with dignity despite its lurid subject matter and intense media scrutiny. His handling of witness anonymity, cross-examination objections, and legal strategy challenges showed a judicial temperament that balanced compassion for victims with rigorous attention to procedural fairness.His Indian heritage is a footnote in his public profile but a source of private pride. In interviews and public appearances, Subramanian has spoken of his parents’ sacrifices, his mother’s insistence on “never cutting corners,” and his father’s near-religious faith in the power of American institutions. It is perhaps this lived understanding of structural aspiration that has made him an advocate for broadening clerkship opportunities to first-generation professionals and minority students.As the Diddy trial fades from headlines, Arun Subramanian remains a judge to watch: young, brilliant, and now tested in the crucible of one of America’s most sensational celebrity trials — a jurist whose quiet command may define the next chapter of the Southern District’s storied bench.","Arun Subramanian is a judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.

LeBron James' Contract Decision: Still Chasing Greatness

Retirement Rumors: Family, Frustration, and the Future

A Viral Golf Video: A Glimpse Beyond Basketball

Legacy Secure, But the Story Unfinished

The NBA world has been tossed into a whirlpool of speculation about’s future, as the Los Angeles Lakers superstar finds himself at the center of retirement rumors—despite officially committing to another season in purple and gold. The latest spark is a viral golf video and a candid, leaked conversation that have fans and pundits dissecting every move of the league’s most enduring icon. LeBron James , now 40, has opted into his $52.6 million player option for the 2025–26 NBA season, ensuring he’ll return for a record 23rd year. This decision makes him the first player in league history to reach such longevity, a testament to his durability and continued dominance. Last season, James averaged an impressive 24.4 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 8.2 assists, numbers that would be the envy of players half his age. However, the Lakers’ early playoff exit left the veteran star unsatisfied and hungry for another title run.Despite his commitment, whispers about retirement refuse to fade. A leaked dinner conversation with his wife, Savannah, and friend Kevin Love revealed LeBron’s inner conflict: “Savannah wants me to f---ing retire in the next year or so”.For the first time, it appears that family considerations may outweigh the pressures from the Lakers’ front office or the lure of more records. With his contract set to expire after the upcoming season, LeBron will become an unrestricted free agent next summer—opening the door for what could be a dramatic farewell tour or a surprise decision.Adding fuel to the speculation, LeBron James recently posted a series of videos on Instagram, not of his signature dunks or no-look passes, but of him struggling—and laughing—on the golf course. Captioning the post, “Day 2 of officially trying this out! Boy o Boy it’s a mind fk to say the least! But I think I enjoy that part of it a lot! Haha!” LeBron displayed both his competitive spirit and willingness to embrace new challenges. Fans quickly wondered: Is this just offseason fun, or is LeBron teasing a post-NBA passion project?The video, showing his powerful but unrefined swing, drew instant comparisons to other athletes-turned-golfers and even referenced his earlier, famously awkward golf attempts. The lighthearted tone, however, belies a deeper truth—LeBron is contemplating life after basketball, and he's not afraid to share that journey with his fans.LeBron’s career is already the stuff of legend: four NBA championships, four MVP awards, the all-time scoring record, and a unique ability to adapt and lead across three franchises. His impact goes beyond stats—he’s a cultural icon, philanthropist, and mentor to the next generation of stars.Yet, as he prepares for another grueling NBA campaign, the question remains: How much longer will LeBron defy time? For now, he’s lacing up for at least one more season, but his recent comments and viral golf escapades suggest he’s savoring every moment—both on and off the court.Alson read: Bronny James Pay Cut Rumor Debunked: Viral Hoax Fooled NBA Fans Whether this is the beginning of LeBron’s long goodbye or just another chapter in his remarkable journey, one thing is certain: the world will be watching, and every swing—basketball or golf—will be headline news.","LeBron James has opted into his $52.6 million player option for the 2025–26 NBA season.

Cooper Flagg

The Origin of the Rumors Surrounding LeBron James and Cooper Flagg

Is a LeBron-for-Flagg Trade on the Table?

Why the Rumors Persist

What Would a Realistic Trade Look Like?

The Entertainment Factor: What If?

The NBA offseason is always ripe with speculation, but the latest swirl of rumors involving the, and the Dallas Mavericks’ new star rookiehas taken the basketball world by storm. Let’s break down what’s real, what’s fantasy, and why the idea of a LeBron-for-Flagg swap is both captivating and, for now, entirely fictional. LeBron James , now entering his 23rd NBA season, recently opted into the final year of his Lakers contract, guaranteeing himself a massive $52.6 million payday. This decision, paired with ambiguous statements from his agent Rich Paul, ignited speculation about LeBron’s future in Los Angeles. As the Lakers’ roster faces uncertainty and LeBron’s championship window narrows, trade chatter has naturally intensified.Meanwhile, the Dallas Mavericks made headlines by selecting Cooper Flagg with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NBA Draft. Flagg, a dynamic forward out of Duke, is widely seen as a franchise cornerstone—drawing inevitable comparisons to a young LeBron James, who also entered the league as a top pick with sky-high expectations.In short: No, the Lakers are not trading LeBron James for Cooper Flagg Despite the social media frenzy and clickbait headlines, there is no credible report or indication that such a one-for-one swap is being discussed. The Mavericks view Flagg as their future, and the Lakers, while open to exploring LeBron trades under specific circumstances, are not targeting Flagg in any realistic package.- Mavericks’ Position: Dallas is not interested in trading for LeBron James unless he is bought out by the Lakers , which would allow them to sign him as a free agent rather than give up assets—especially not their prized rookie.- Lakers’ Perspective: If the Lakers were to move LeBron, they would likely seek a combination of established players and draft capital, not a straight-up swap for Flagg. Most hypothetical trade packages involve Dallas sending players like Daniel Gafford, PJ Washington, and Klay Thompson, not Flagg.Several factors keep fueling these rumors:- LeBron’s No-Trade Clause: LeBron controls his own destiny with a full no-trade clause, meaning he can veto any deal he doesn’t like.- Dallas’ Star Power: The Mavericks now boast a roster with Kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis, and Klay Thompson—making them an attractive destination for any star, including LeBron, should he seek a new challenge.- Flagg’s Hype: Cooper Flagg’s arrival in Dallas has created immense buzz. LeBron himself praised Flagg, calling him “amazing” and highlighting how joining a veteran-laden Mavericks squad gives Flagg an advantage LeBron never had as a rookie.If the Lakers and Mavericks were to engage in serious talks, the most cited scenario involves a package built around Dallas’ veteran depth—not Cooper Flagg.

Montreal Canadiens emerge as predicted destination



Sidney Crosby agent strongly denies trade rumors



All eyes are on the Pittsburgh Penguins' post-Olympics timeline



The Pittsburgh Penguins may be at the beginning of a long rebuild, but Sidney Crosby’s future remains uncertain. Despite extending his contract through 2027, speculation over a possible departure has only intensified following comments from veteran NHL insider Nick Kypreos.This aligns with growing chatter that suggests teams like the Montreal Canadiens or even the Colorado Avalanche could come calling.While trade rumors have often linked Sidney Crosby to the Colorado Avalanche, due to his long-standing friendship with Nathan MacKinnon, it was Kypreos’ prediction of Montreal that truly caught fans off guard.Adding fuel to this, former Penguins player Georges Laraque also hinted at a potential Crosby trade during the first night of the recent NHL Draft. Laraque, now a Montreal-based radio host, pointed to the growing frustration within the Penguins fan base and front office about the team’s trajectory.In contrast to the swirling speculation, Sidney Crosby’s agent Pat Brisson was quick to shut things down. He called the rumours “baseless” and reaffirmed that Crosby had no intention of leaving Pittsburgh.However, as the franchise enters uncertain territory and struggles to remain competitive, even the most loyal stars can be tested.If the Penguins fail to turn things around in the next season or two. Especially after the Olympics, trade chatter will only grow louder.As the 2025-26 NHL season approaches, the focus will increasingly shift to what happens after the 2026 Winter Olympics. Sidney Crosby is expected to represent once again Team Canada, possibly playing alongside MacKinnon, Connor Bedard, and other top-tier talent.What happens after that tournament could shape the final chapter of Crosby’s storied career. For now, the noise is just speculation, but in a league where surprises are common, few are writing anything off. The Penguins’ path forward, and Crosby’s role in it, will remain one of the NHL’s biggest storylines heading into 2026.Also Read: What Connor McDavid’s mindset looks like now, according to insiders' view on Oilers contract extension drama","Montreal Canadiens emerge as predicted destination for Sidney Crosby.

A dual celebration: America’s freedom and a mother’s strength

Behind Tom Brady’s career was a supportive mom who once hesitated

As fireworks lit up the sky across the nation on July 4th, Tom Brady took the opportunity to celebrate something far more personal than just Independence Day. In a heartfelt Instagram post that quickly made waves online, the NFL icon paid tribute to the woman he calls his greatest coach and biggest fan—his mother, Galynn Patricia Brady.For Tom Brady, the Fourth of July is more than barbecues and parades—it’s the day his mother was born. Calling it “one of the most important birthdays,” the former New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback expressed deep gratitude for Galynn’s strength and resilience, especially during her battle with breast cancer.In his emotional tribute, Tom Brady wrote, “Happy Birthday, Mom. Thank you for being someone our family could always count on... Your strength, determination, love, and selflessness know no bounds.”Galynn was diagnosed with cancer in 2016, a battle she fought with quiet courage and unshakeable spirit. Her presence at Super Bowl LI in 2017, where Brady led a historic comeback, remains one of the most emotionally charged moments in NFL history.The quarterback added, “We love you so much, and we're beyond grateful for every moment we get to share with you. Happy Birthday! And happy birthday to America!”While Tom Brady is now revered as one of the greatest athletes of all time, his journey to the NFL wasn’t always assured.In fact, Galynn was initially hesitant about her son playing football in high school, concerned about the sport’s physical risks. But once she recognized his passion, she stood firmly by his side through every touchdown and trophy.Raised in a tightly-knit family in San Mateo, California, Brady credits both his parents for instilling the values that shaped his competitive edge. His father, Tom Brady Sr., was known for turning ordinary moments into challenges—something Brady says made the household both fun and fiercely motivating.Brady’s post wasn’t just a tribute to his mom—it was a quiet reflection on values like family, sacrifice, and gratitude. In an age where public figures often reserve social media for polished branding, his message struck a deeply human chord. For fans, it served as a powerful reminder: behind the championships and the celebrity image is a man who hasn't forgotten the people who got him there.Also Read: Tom Brady’s daughter Vivian looks just like Gisele Bündchen in rare beach photo from Spain getaway This Fourth of July, Tom Brady reminded us all that the meaning of independence often begins at home—with the people who teach us how to stand strong.","Tom Brady celebrated his mother Galynn's birthday on July 4th.

Pierce’s Perspective on Damian Joining the Celtics

Financial and Roster Realities

The NBA offseason has delivered its fair share of surprises, but few have been as much talked about as the prospect ofjoining the. With the Milwaukee Bucks unexpectedly waiving Lillard to clear cap space, the Celtics—fresh off a turbulent offseason—are reportedly among the frontrunners interested in the nine-time All-Star. While Lillard has yet to sign, Celtics legend Paul Pierce has weighed in on the dramatic changes in Boston and how a player of Lillard’s caliber could reshape the team’s future.The Boston Celtics ’ 2025 offseason has been marked by upheaval. Key contributors Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porzingis have departed, and franchise centerpiece Jayson Tatum is sidelined as he recovers from an Achilles injury. The Celtics, who finished the previous season with a strong 61-21 record, now face a “gap year,” with their championship window paused until their stars return to full health.Paul Pierce, the beloved Celtics Hall of Famer, remains optimistic about Boston’s long-term prospects, emphasizing the prime years ahead for Tatum and Jaylen Brown. Pierce believes that as long as these two remain, Boston can “work out the other components” and return to title contention. Damian Lillard ’s reputation precedes him: he’s known for his exceptional shooting range, clutch gene (“Dame Time”), and ability to create offense both for himself and teammates.His deep three-point shooting forces defenses to extend, opening up the floor for others. Lillard is also a skilled ball-handler, passer, and a proven leader—qualities that would immediately elevate Boston’s backcourt.If Lillard were to sign with the Celtics, his role would be both transformational and strategic:- Veteran Leadership and Mentorship: With Tatum out for much of the upcoming season, Lillard could serve as a mentor to younger players like Payton Pritchard and Hugo Gonzalez, helping to bridge the gap until Boston’s stars are healthy.- Primary Playmaker: Even as he recovers from his Achilles injury, Lillard’s basketball IQ and experience would make him the de facto floor general, orchestrating the offense and taking pressure off Jaylen Brown and Derrick White.- Clutch Scoring Threat: Lillard’s history of late-game heroics would give Boston a reliable closer, something the team has lacked since the days of Pierce himself.- Championship Catalyst: By the 2026-27 season, with both Lillard and Tatum healthy, Boston could field a starting lineup featuring Lillard, Tatum, Brown, and White—potentially the most potent in the league. Damian Lillard wouldn’t need to shoulder the scoring burden alone, allowing him to focus on efficiency and leadership as the Celtics chase Banner 18.- Locker Room Culture: Lillard’s professionalism and work ethic would reinforce Boston’s winning culture, signaling to fans and the league that the Celtics are serious about returning to contention.While Paul Pierce hasn’t commented directly on Damian Lillard’s fit, his overall message is clear: the Celtics’ path back to the Finals depends on maximizing the prime years of Tatum and Brown, and surrounding them with elite talent. Lillard, even at 35 and coming off injury, fits the bill as a high-IQ, high-impact veteran who can elevate the team’s ceiling without disrupting its young core.The Celtics would likely offer Lillard their $5.6 million midlevel exception, a reasonable risk for a player of his pedigree. The move would not only address Boston’s need for a lead guard but also allow Lillard to chase the championship that has long eluded him—something he reportedly covets at this stage of his career.Also read: Is LeBron James Nearing Retirement or Just Having Fun? Viral Golf Video Sparks New Questions Among NBA Fans If Damian Lillard dons green, expect him to play the role of mentor, playmaker, and clutch scorer, guiding Boston through a transitional year and positioning them for a championship run once the roster is fully healthy. As Pierce would say, with Tatum, Brown, and a healthy Lillard, the Celtics’ championship window remains wide open.","Damian Lillard is reportedly interested in joining the Boston Celtics.

AAMIR KHAN STUNS SAMAY RAINA IN CHESS MATCH: ‘BE HAPPY YOU LOST TO ME’

NEW DELHI: World chess champion D Gukesh’s remarkable performance at the SuperUnited Rapid and Blitz tournament in Zagreb left the chess world buzzing, as the 19-year-old Indian Grandmaster surged ahead with six wins, two draws, and a single loss in the rapid section.However, World Chess Federation (FIDE) CEO Emil Sutovsky offered a measured response to the excitement, reminding fans that while Gukesh’s showing was exceptional, it doesn’t automatically crown him the best rapid player in the world.“No, an amazing performance in Zagreb does not mean that Gukesh became the world's best rapid player overnight,” Sutovsky stated on X. “But yes, it does refute certain theories. You can't just score like that vs world's best by chance—or by having good three days.”Sutovsky highlighted that such a run places Gukesh among the top echelon of rapid players, but emphasised that consistent elite results define greatness, not single-event triumphs.""Exactly as when Dubov or Nodirbek won the FIDE World Rapid, it did not mean they suddenly became the strongest. But from thereon it was clear, they are one of the best,"" he added.""Now, it is very possible, that Gukesh misses the overall first, not scoring too well in blitz, but it does not change my point.He convincingly won the rapid with all the top guys—even if some pedantic souls may insist it was technically just a rapid portion of R&B event. Very few had such a remarkable score in these tournaments—and all are the usual suspects. Now Gukesh is one of them—even in rapid.""Gukesh ended the rapid leg with a smooth victory over Wesley So in the final round, finishing with 14 points out of a possible 18. The win followed an impressive streak of five consecutive victories on day two, cementing his lead over top contenders like Jan-Krzysztof Duda and Magnus Carlsen “Talking more widely: we all (myself included) suffer from evaluating things, often looking just at a limited set of variables. That is different from basing the judgment on insufficient data. Variables are almost always there, but many of them are easily (dis)missed, with a focus on one, allegedly most important,” he explained.As the blitz portion of the Grand Chess Tour event looms with 18 rounds to go, Gukesh’s rapid success gives him a three-point cushion.While not yet crowned the best, his performance in Zagreb has surely announced him as a formidable force in the world of rapid chess.","World chess champion D Gukesh's remarkable performance at the SuperUnited Rapid and Blitz tournament in Zagreb left the chess world buzzing.

Poll Do you think Shubman Gill can fill the shoes of legends like Tendulkar and Kohli? Yes, definitely Maybe No, he can't

EXCLUSIVE | David Gower on Shubman Gill, Jasprit Bumrah and India's England tour

India captain Shubman Gill delivered yet another masterclass with the bat, scoring a magnificent 161 in the second innings of the ongoing second Test against England at Edgbaston on Saturday.This followed his marathon 269-run knock in the first innings, making him the first player in the 148-year history of Test cricket to record a 250 and a 150 in the same match. His aggregate of 430 runs in the game puts him in rarefied air, with only Graham Gooch having scored more (456) in a single Test.Former India cricketer and commentator Dinesh Karthik, speaking on Sky Sports, was full of praise for the 25-year-old, likening Gill's emergence to the transitions Indian cricket saw with Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli at No. 4.""Giving him captaincy was something that was talked about a lot,"" Karthik said. ""The one thing that always was spoken about was Shubman Gill needs to get runs away from India. He's got the talent, but the statistics so far didn't quite back that. This series has been everything he needed. He's walking into hallowed turf. Batting at number four – you had legends over decades: Tendulkar and then Kohli. Today, it is Shubman Gill.Those are big shoes to fill, and the way he's walked in and taken charge along with captaincy has been the best part of this series from an Indian standpoint.""Gill's calm demeanour at the crease was also a point of discussion.""He just looks serene, unhurried,"" said fellow commentator Mark Butcher, who asked Karthik if anything had changed in Gill's approach. Karthik noted the technical adjustments.""He's worked on getting his bat in front of his pads, especially against the ball coming back in – something that used to trouble him,"" Karthik said. ""He's mentioned working on his technique before the England tour, and it's showing. The pitches may not be bowler-friendly, but more than technique, it's his mental fortitude and hunger for big runs that stands out.""With India in command and Gill rewriting record books, the Edgbaston Test might just be remembered as the one where a new Indian legend fully arrived.","India captain Shubman Gill scored 161 in the second innings of the ongoing second Test against England at Edgbaston.

It's never easy to have an overnight lead in these tournaments; 4 points over me and 3 over Duda is a lot.""But it doesn't feel like that much when you don't have the experience.

Charges related to the 2018 Hockey Canada scandal

Cal Foote, once a rising star in the NHL and a Stanley Cup winner with the Tampa Bay Lightning, is now facing serious legal trouble as one of the players charged in the high-profile Hockey Canada sexual assault case. Foote, the son of former NHL defenceman Adam Foote, was among five former members of Canada’s 2018 World Junior team indicted for their alleged involvement in a group sexual assault that took place in London, Ontario.Drafted 14th overall in 2017 by the Tampa Bay Lightning, Cal Foote was once viewed as a cornerstone defenseman. He played junior hockey with the Kelowna Rockets and quickly established himself with his size, skill, and NHL pedigree. He signed his entry-level contract with Tampa in 2018 and made his NHL debut during the 2020–21 season. That same season, he became part of the Lightning’s championship-winning roster, cementing his status as a young player to watch.Foote later played for the Nashville Predators and had a brief stint with the New Jersey Devils, where he was reunited with his younger brother Nolan. After struggling to secure a permanent NHL role, Foote signed with Slovakian team MHk 32 Liptovský Mikuláš in 2024.On January 30, 2024, Cal Foote was charged with one count of sexual assault in relation to an incident following a Hockey Canada gala in 2018. The London Police Service confirmed the charge days later. The allegations claim that several members of the Canadian national junior team were involved in a non-consensual sexual encounter with a woman in a hotel room. Foote’s lawyer has stated that he ""is innocent"" and intends to fight the charge.The trial began in April 2025 and has become one of the most talked-about cases in Canadian sports, drawing national attention to systemic issues in hockey culture. Alongside Foote, other prominent former NHL players were also charged.Also Read: Who is Alex Formenton?

Jack Eichel’s impact and value to the Golden Knights cannot be overstated

While the Vegas Golden Knights made waves this offseason by acquiring Mitch Marner in a blockbuster sign-and-trade, the franchise is quietly working on another crucial piece of business—securing Jack Eichel’s future with the team.Jack Eichel, the star center who helped deliver Vegas its first Stanley Cup in 2023, officially became eligible for a contract extension on July 1. According to The Fourth Period’s David Pagnotta, negotiations are already underway. “Speaking of Vegas, the Golden Knights have started contract negotiations with Jack Eichel on an extension,” Pagnotta reported, signaling the team’s clear intention to lock down their franchise cornerstone before he hits free agency.The 28-year-old center is coming off a career-best season, notching a franchise-record 94 points in just 77 regular-season games. His elite two-way play, leadership, and postseason pedigree have made him one of the most important players on Vegas’s roster since arriving via trade from Buffalo in November 2021.Though Marner currently holds the title of highest-paid Golden Knight with a $12 million annual cap hit, Eichel’s new deal could surpass that, as noted by team insider Danny Webster.“Jack Eichel is now eligible for an 8-year contract extension to make him the highest-paid player in Golden Knights history,” Webster posted on July 1.Bringing in Marner was a major swing for Vegas, but retaining Eichel would send a message that the organization is not just chasing headlines—it’s building for long-term success. With Eichel set to become an unrestricted free agent in 2026, this extension window provides a vital opportunity for the Golden Knights to solidify their core before any uncertainty takes hold.Also Read: NHL Predictions: 3-time All-Star Ryan Suter likely to retire as market interest fades in offseason Eichel’s continued presence ensures that Vegas remains a serious Stanley Cup contender in the years to come.

What’s Next for the New York Knicks?

The Milwaukee Bucks ' decision to part ways withsent shockwaves through the NBA. While the move was aimed at keeping Giannis Antetokounmpo content, Lillard now faces a pivotal career choice—and thehave surprisingly entered the conversation as a potential landing spot.According to The Daily News, the New York Knicks present an ideal scenario for Lillard, who is recovering from a ruptured Achilles. The team’s strong medical staff and recent health record make them a viable option for the veteran guard’s rehabilitation.As The Daily News noted: “The Knicks were the healthiest team in all of basketball last season. Damian Lillard needs somewhere to rehab... The Knicks could sign Lillard, who will continue to collect checks from the Milwaukee Bucks after they waived him from the roster and stretched the balance of his contract over five years, and help a Top-75 player return from a ruptured Achilles.” (H/t: Sporting News)The On-Court Challenges of a Lillard-Brunson BackcourtWhile adding a 24.9 PPG scorer like Lillard is enticing, there are legitimate concerns:- Defensive Vulnerabilities: Pairing Lillard with Jalen Brunson would create a small backcourt, making them an easy target for opposing offenses.- Rotation Adjustments: The Knicks would need a clear plan to mitigate defensive weaknesses, possibly through strong help defense from their forwards.Despite these hurdles, the opportunity to acquire a player of Lillard’s caliber at a discount is rare.New York’s front office must weigh the risks and rewards carefully. If Lillard recovers well, he could elevate the Knicks into true championship contention.

He helped the team to win its first World Series in 88 years the same year. He was the one on the mound during many key events, finishing World Series Game 4 in Houston and marking the save in the ALDS sweep over the Red Sox.Jenks quickly became among MLB's best closers, well-known for his fast fastball and composed under pressure. In 2006 and 2007 he was awarded back-to-back All-Star honors. With over 40 saves a year, he played a major role in enabling the squad to win games during those seasons.

McGrady doubles down on Shaquille O’Neal “what-if” but apologizes to Kobe Bryant

Tracy McGrady on Kobe and Shaq Comment, LeBron James Matchup, Ring Culture and More | FULL INTERVIEW

Tracy McGrady stirred the pot with a bold “what-if” about teaming up with Shaquille O’Neal—and now he’s walking it back, just a little. After claiming he could’ve won titles with Shaq in Kobe Bryant’s place, McGrady faced backlash for what many saw as a diss. But T-Mac insists it wasn’t disrespect—it was about missed opportunity and misunderstood phrasing, not knocking his “brother” Kobe.On June 20, during his First Take appearance, Tracy McGrady confidently declared — “Replace me with Kobe with Shaq, I don’t win a championship? You don’t think I can carry the Lakers to a championship? I’ve never had the opportunity.”Naturally, there was some backlash. A lot of listeners took the comment as a direct jab at Kobe Bryant—something McGrady never meant to imply.During a follow-up interview with Timeless Sports, the Hall of Famer admitted he regretted the way he expressed himself. He reflected on his phrasing and felt it could have been better. — “I never should have said ‘replace.’ … people know Kobe’s my brother. There’s no way in hell I would ever disrespect my brother like that.”Even though he backed off from the controversial phrasing, McGrady is still firm on his stance: his playoff-ready offense, combined with Shaq’s raw power, would have made them contenders for the championship during the 2000–2008 dynasty period.McGrady highlighted the context of his hypothetical remark, focusing on the intersection of two powerful dynasties. From 2000 to 2002, Shaquille O’Neal recorded Finals averages of 38 points and 16 rebounds, guiding the Los Angeles Lakers to a three-peat. During that same period, McGrady was scoring 30 PPG as a 21-year-old sensation for the Orlando Magic.He clearly pointed out: “Shaq, Kobe, Tim Duncan were the only ones winning championships” during that era.He didn’t mean to compare entire careers. Instead, he pointed out a specific timeframe: combine T-Mac’s prime with Shaq’s peak during the Finals, and you’ve got a top-notch title contender.

Indiana Pacers were never in Oklahoma City’s league

Aries Spears on NBA Finals: Who Gives a F*** About the Pacers? Haliburton Had Lucky Shots! (Part 4)

The 2025 NBA Finals had chaos, heartbreak, and heroics—but Aries Spears wasn’t impressed. While Indiana pulled off comeback after comeback, Spears laughed them off and called the series predictable. “Who gives a f*** about the Pacers? It’s Indiana,” he snapped. His take? Only the Knicks could’ve made it watchable. But between Tyrese Haliburton’s brilliance and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander’s dominance, the real story turned out way more unforgettable than expected.Aries Spears took a bold stance when he declared, ""nobody is beating Oklahoma City."" He firmly believed the Thunder's superiority was obvious even before the game began, even though the Pacers shocked the league with consecutive comebacks and a significant Game 1 win led by Tyrese Haliburton's key shot. Spears laughed off the Pacers, saying, ""Who gives a f* about the Pacers? It’s Indiana."" This indicates he considered Indiana just a minor player in a series he thought was always going to end up with Oklahoma.According to the stats, the Pacers changed the game in the 2025 postseason. Indiana managed to pull off an impressive five comebacks from 15 points down—a feat that peaked with a nail-biting last-second win in Game 1.Led by coach Rick Carlisle and powered by Haliburton's talent, they took down the Knicks, Cavaliers, and even tied the Finals before Game 7. Unfortunately, everything fell apart when Haliburton went down with a torn Achilles early in the pivotal game, derailing their momentum.The Thunder experienced a perfect championship storyline. They finished the regular season with an NBA-leading record of 68–14 and were powered by MVP Shai Gilgeous‑Alexander, who was awarded both the regular season and Finals MVP, finishing as the top scorer with 32.7 points per game. With contributions from Jalen Williams, Chet Holmgren, and Alex Caruso, OKC took the reins — especially after Haliburton’s injury, which clearly shifted the momentum in their favor.Spears went beyond Indiana's firing—he said the NBA really missed out by not featuring the New York Knicks in the Finals. He envisioned the epic battle between Knicks supporters, the buzz of Madison Square Garden, and cultural figures like Spike Lee, referring to it as ""the Cinderella story"" that the Finals truly needed.Also Read: Boston Celtics trade Kristaps Porziņģis and Jrue Holiday as Jaylen Brown rumors swirl louder than ever Oklahoma City’s win was anticipated, Indiana had a supporting role, and the Knicks would’ve created the suspense.

Boston Celtics trade Kristaps Porziņģis and Jrue Holiday as Jaylen Brown rumors swirl louder than ever,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/boston-celtics-trade-kristaps-porziis-and-jrue-holiday-as-jaylen-brown-rumors-swirl-louder-than-ever/articleshow/122260025.cms,"(Image Source - Getty Images)

Boston Celtics trade Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porziņģis to save 180 million in tax penalties

The Boston Celtics have turned over a new leaf this offseason making two surprising trades that not only saved them money, but also got some people worried. After releasing Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porziņģis, Boston has avoided an insane amount of tax penalties exceptionally totaling to an insane sum of 180 million dollars. However, another step back, it is possible to say that these actions point to a greater change. The franchise might be at the bleakest point in years as rumors surround Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum recovers.In a swift series of transactions, Boston moved Jrue Holiday to the Portland Trail Blazers for Anfernee Simons along with two second-round picks, which helped them get rid of Holiday’s $32.4 million salary for 2025-26 and eliminate future contract headaches. Shortly after, they traded Kristaps Porziņģis to the Atlanta Hawks in a three-team trade that involved the Brooklyn Nets, bringing in Georges Niang and another second-round pick. Altogether, these actions enabled Boston to sit about $4.5 million below the troublesome second luxury-tax apron—saving them roughly $180 million in tax penalties.Standing at 7'2"", Porziņģis is an All-Star who averaged 19.5 points in 42 games last season.He offers size and scoring, but he’s also known for his frequent injuries. Jrue Holiday, a vital player in their quest for the 2024 championship and who just landed a big four-year, $135 million extension, is now leaving without any ties. The Celtics have made some moves to fill gaps: Anfernee Simons provides explosive backcourt scoring on a $27.7 million expiring deal, while Niang contributes shooting at an $8.2 million salary.This whole drama has thrust Jaylen Brown, the 2024 Finals MVP, into the limelight. League insiders report that there's ""significant interest"" in both Brown and Derrick White—the Celtics are listening to offers, but they have high asking prices. Assistant GM Mike Zarren stressed that Brown and White are very much valued, and Boston would only entertain blockbuster deals similar to what Mikal Bridges fetched.Jayson Tatum is still out of action, focusing on his recovery from last season’s torn Achilles, which amplifies Boston’s need for some cap relief.Celtics great Paul Pierce has urged the management to keep Brown, arguing that with Tatum and Brown together, they still have a chance at the championship.Still, with Luke Kornet signing with another team and the lineup getting thinner, it’s evident that Boston is preparing for a year of transition.Also Read: These Three NBA rookies quietly landed in spots where the playoffs could define their rookie seasons But this shake-up has a significant downside: the loss of veteran leadership and frontcourt size, which means Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, and Derrick White will have to step up. While Boston maintains that Brown is ""untouchable,"" the rumors suggest a different narrative. As the 2025-26 season approaches, the balance between being financially smart and aiming for competition has never been more delicate.","Boston Celtics traded Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porziņģis to save $180 million in tax penalties.

Nazem Kadri not on the trade block yet but Calgary Flames could change stance soon

“if the player were ever available, of course Toronto would be interested"".

Toronto Maple Leafs could pursue Nazem Kadri if Flames season collapses

A tense situation is playing out in the NHL. Calgary Flames centre Nazem Kadri has a full no‑movement clause that keeps him off the market—at least for now. But with the trade deadline approaching, signs point to change. According to insiders, the Toronto Maple Leafs are silently watching, and if Calgary adjusts its stance, a bidding war could ignite.On July 4, 2025, TSN insider Darren Dreger told First Up on Toronto 1050 that “Nazem Kadri isn’t available. I’m not saying he won’t be available … but let’s see how things go in Calgary.” Kadri, 34, is under contract through 2028‑29 at $7 million per season, with a full no‑movement clause that gives him control over any trade .Calgary’s general manager Craig Conroy has maintained that the Flames want to stay competitive. Dreger added that, should Kadri become available,With Kadri coming off a productive 35‑goal, 67‑point season, and a Stanley Cup win with Colorado in 2022, interest around the league is high .Though Kadri’s name re‑entered Maple Leafs discussions, analysts warn the cost could be steep.Dreger noted that Toronto has limited trade capital after dealing away first‑ and second‑round picks at last season’s deadline . He highlighted that “Easton Cowan? That’s not enough” to land a player of Kadri’s caliber .Meanwhile, journalist David Pagnotta echoed that, while Toronto may “entertain it,” the fit doesn’t add up due to Kadri’s long deal and Calgary’s unwilling stance . Pagnotta also pointed out that Kadri’s contract size and Flames’ no‑move clause make a trade premature.Also Read: NHL Trade Rumors: Toronto Maple Leafs Eye Brock Boeser As Mitch Marner Exit Looms Bottom line: Nazem Kadri is not on the trade block, yet.

Bill Belichick ripped into him over a busted play and Gilmore’s pride took the hit



From almost crying to never getting picked again, Gilmore turned pain into fuel



“I ain’t never got picked again after that,”

Gilmore’s honesty reveals how greatness sometimes starts with discomfort

Stephon Gilmore was supposed to be one of the best in the league and he. But even he wasn’t safe when he first stepped into a New England Patriots team meeting. In an interview on, the former NFL Defensive Player of the Year dropped a raw, behind-the-scenes moment that made fans do a double take.Gilmore admitted that during one of his first meetings with the Patriots, Bill Belichick came at him so hard in front of the whole squad that he had to step away just to compose himself.Gilmore was fresh to the Patriots, trying to earn respect, and defending during a bunch route. He got picked. And Bill? He let the whole room know about it.“He killed me one day, bro. It was when I first got there. I was pressed down on the receiver. It was a bunch route, and I got picked. Bro, he killed me at the next meeting. I almost cried, how he did me. I ain’t going to lie to you. I went to the bathroom, like man, bro.”That’s the kind of coaching that either breaks you or builds you. And in Gilmore’s case? It was the latter.The wild part is, Gilmore said that moment was a turning point. After that brutal callout, he never let it happen again.he said with a little pride.You know what followed? A legendary run. He locked down receivers, made the Pro Bowl, won Defensive Player of the Year in 2019, and even helped Belichick grab another Super Bowl ring. So yeah, the coach went full savage but Gilmore turned the sting into success.Not every player is willing to admit they were pushed to the brink, especially when they're a superstar. But Gilmore opening up like this just shows the human side of what it takes to be elite.It’s not always trophies and headlines, it’s embarrassment, resilience, and learning from the moment you wanted to hide. And if you’re lucky, a coach like Belichick who’ll destroy your ego just enough to rebuild your game.Also read - Joe Burrow goes viral after fans spot him walking alone in Beverly Hills looking ‘extremely sad’","Stephon Gilmore says Bill Belichick made him cry in team meeting early in Patriots career.

Setting An Example





LUCKNOW: In Disney’s The Lion King, a young Simba is shattered after the tragic death of his father, Mufasa, under whose shadow he had just started getting valuable life lessons. With no parent to guide or protect him, the poor cub wanders in the wild, rudderless and fending for himself, and ends up eating grubs and insects after befriending Timon and Pumbaa, the carefree meerkat and warthog duo who usher in the ‘Hakuna Matata’ (a Swahili phrase which means ‘no worries’) phase in his life.O ver a thousand kilometres away from the Pride Lands, the jungle in African Savanna where Simba’s reel-life unfolds, real-life Asiatic cubs in Uttar Pradesh’s Etawah Lion Safari are fortunate enough to revel in their ‘Hakuna Matata’ moment soon after being abandoned by their mothers. For, they found “surrogate parents”, not in the wild, but in a team of wildlife caretakers who extended a helping hand to save them.In what is being hailed as a milestone in India’s big cat conservation, caretakers at Etawah Lion Safari have successfully hand-reared five abandoned Asiatic lion cubs — a first-of-its-kind achievement for the critically endangered species. The caregivers, led by Etawah Safari director Anil Patel, turned a crisis into conservation success through round-the-clock bottle feeding, nutritional care, and constant medical monitoring of the cubs.“These cubs are like our children now. Their mothers might have abandoned them, but they were never alone,” says Patel.The journey began on Sept 3, 2023, when lioness Roopa rejected her newborn cub, sired by lion Kanha. Recognising the danger to the cubs’ lives, the caretakers initiated an emergency hand-rearing process involving bottle-feeding and regular veterinary care. The cub, affectionately called ‘Ajju’ (named after one of the caretakers Ajay Singh), has grown into a healthy, active lion nearing 18 months of age.This success set the precedent for future interventions. On June 1, 2024, two more female cubs — born to Neerja and Kanha — faced a similar fate when their mother abandoned them shortly after birth. Again, the staff stepped in, ensuring their survival through carefully scheduled feeding, lamb broth, and egg whites to supplement essential nutrients. Recently, on April 21, 2025, Roopa gave birth to four cubs, but two tragically died from accidental crushing — a risk not uncommon in captive breeding. The remaining two were removed and immediately placed under human care. Now, one month old, they are beginning to interact with their keepers, showing signs of good health and behavioural development.This conservation feat was achieved by animal keepers Ajay Singh and Asif Ali, who took up the roles of surrogate parents, putting their personal lives on hold to ensure the survival of the cubs. “Initially, I had to forget about my home, wife, and children. There were many nights when I couldn’t see my family. But when I see these cubs growing healthy and active, I feel it was all worth it,” says Asif. Ajay’s dedication earned him the honour of rechristening one of the cubs after him. “I’m grateful to the Safari for naming one of the cubs ‘Ajju’. He is like a part of me now,” he says.These cubs are housed in specially designed enclosures equipped with 24x7 CCTV surveillance. Hygiene is strictly maintained to prevent infections, and the feeding regimen is followed with precision. Every few hours, the keepers prepare specialised milk formula and proteinrich soups, adjusting the diet according to the development stage of the cubs.“Asiatic lionesses are highly intelligent and sensitive. If a lioness senses weakness in herself or perceives a threat to the cubs’ survival, she abandons them. It’s nature’s way of focusing on resources — but that’s where human intervention becomes crucial,” says the Etawah Safari director.Veterinarians carry out regular health assessments to track growth, behaviour, and emotional development. “Ajju now behaves like any other lion of his age. That’s how we measure success — when handreared cubs act like those growing under natural conditions,” says one of the safari’s veterinary officers.With fewer than 700 Asiatic lions left in the wild, primarily in Gujarat’s Gir forest, Etawah Safari’s achievement is more than a local success. The safari is now documenting its protocols and experiences to share with other wildlife parks and zoos.Plans are also underway to expand training for staff in neonatal care for big cats, further strengthening the park’s preparedness for future litters. The safari park authorities plan to refine their conservation techniques. Their achievement sets a precedent for similar conservation efforts, particularly in the preservation of endangered big cat species. The dedication of the staff, combined with scientific approaches to animal care, has created a blueprint for successful wildlife conservation. Their work contributes significantly to the broader goal of protecting and preserving the Asiatic lion population for future generations.“This is not just about saving five cubs. It’s about proving that with dedication, expertise, and empathy, we can give endangered species a fighting chance,” says Patel. Simba may have walked alone, but in Etawah, the lion cubs walk with pride and grow with a human touch.","Five abandoned Asiatic lion cubs have been hand-reared by wildlife caretakers at Etawah Lion Safari in Uttar Pradesh, India.

NEW DELHI: In a ringing endorsement that could change a young cricketer’s life, former India head coach Ravi Shastri on Saturday lavished praise on 14-year-old batting prodigy Vaibhav Suryavanshi, suggesting that the teenager may soon be fast-tracked into the senior national setup.Suryavanshi turned heads with a record-smashing 143 off just 78 balls in the fourth Youth ODI against England U-19, propelling India to a commanding total of 363 for 9. His whirlwind innings featured 13 fours and 10 sixes and included a 52-ball century - the fastest in Youth ODI history, eclipsing Pakistan’s Kamran Ghulam's 53-ball effort in 2013.Speaking during commentary on Day 4 of the second Test between India and England at Edgbaston, Shastri said, “He [Suryavanshi] will play First-Class cricket, but that’s what the IPL does. It gives you that platform. The whole country sees you. And you catch the imagination of everyone.”Shastri was emphatic about what lies ahead: “It will fast-track him if he goes and plays First-Class cricket, goes and gets a couple of hundreds in his first couple of seasons.”The left-handed sensation from Samastipur, Bihar, is now the youngest ever centurion in Youth ODIs at 14 years and 100 days, surpassing Bangladesh’s Najmul Hossain Shanto, who was 14 years and 241 days when he hit his hundred in 2013.Suryavanshi also broke Sarfaraz Khan’s Indian record, previously set at 15 years and 338 days.Suryavanshi had already captured national attention earlier this year during the IPL, when he hammered a 35-ball century for Rajasthan Royals against Gujarat Titans — the fastest by an Indian in the league’s history.“He has already caught the eyes; already made it to the Under-19 team at the age of 14. Smacking it everywhere,” Shastri added. “And it’s tours like this to England, with this exposure - he can only improve.”India U-19 lead the five-match Youth ODI series 3-1, with Suryavanshi now being viewed as a generational talent with a potentially fast-tracked road to Indian cricket stardom.",Vaibhav Suryavanshi hit 143 off just 78 balls in the fourth Youth ODI against England U-19.

Former England cricketers Nasser Hussain and Stuart Broad strongly believe that India deserve to win at Edgbaston after having dominated England with the bat and with the ball throughout the Test match.""If you look at the nine days of the Test series, they've probably won more, in fact they've definitely won more sessions than England, yet they find themselves one nil down,"" Nasser Hussain told Sky Sports.""That's why they needed this evening and that's why they need tomorrow, because they've played so much good cricket in two Test matches now, they feel that they should go to Lord's 1-1. Excellent, excellent with the bat and then the ball.""It's a real worry that their seamers got more out of this pitch with the new ball than England did. That new ball burst from Akash Deep was absolutely wonderful.""Stuart Broad explained why India have generated more swing than the England pacers and lauded Akash Deep for his splendid spell.""I think when surfaces do dry up a little bit, the new ball can nip off the sort of cracks or the drier surfaces,"" said Broad.""That was just an outstanding spell from Akash Deep today, bringing the stumps into play.I think he's slightly shorter than Carse and Tongue, so he can bowl a slightly different length to hit the stumps.""I think India, we have to be honest, India have outbowled England in this Test match and outbatted them and that's why they're 536 runs ahead with a whole day to go, needing seven wickets to win the Test match,"" he said.Broad admitted that after England chased down 371 runs on the final day of the Headingley Test, he thought the series would be one-way traffic.""They've been superb this week and I must admit, I thought after that day five at Headingley, I thought this series could be gone when you concede that many to lose a Test match when you've controlled the Test match like they did. How do you pick yourself up? And they've done it superbly,"" said Broad.","Former England cricketers Nasser Hussain and Stuart Broad strongly believe that India deserve to win at Edgbaston. India have dominated England with the bat and with the ball throughout the Test match. Hussain: ""It's a real worry that their seamers got more out of this pitch with the new ball than England did.

Fresh off her wedding to Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen, singer and actress Hailee Steinfeld is keeping fans close with a deeply personal update via her newsletter, Beau Society. As the U.S. marked Independence Day , Steinfeld used the occasion to deliver a heartfelt message—and a teaser of what’s to come for the anniversary of her fan-driven project.“Hi, my loves! Happy 4th of July!” Hailee Steinfeld wrote in a brief but meaningful letter through Beau Society. “I’m sending out a quick letter today instead of a full issue. I hope most of you are enjoying the day off, carving out some time with family and friends.” But what stood out wasn’t just the holiday sentiment—it was a quiet, exciting heads-up that something special is brewing for Beau Society’s first birthday in August. “FYI, this week I’ve been cooking up some fun stuff for our first anniversary, which is coming in August (we were born 08/24!)” she shared.Launched in August 2024, Beau Society has served as a more intimate, low-key alternative to social media. “It’s just like having a two-way conversation and talking about all things from cleaning out your closet to topics in this movie,” Steinfeld explained. While it may seem like another celebrity newsletter on the surface, its purpose is far more grounded.As she puts it, it’s not about PR, it’s about “creating a community that can have a conversation that goes deeper than a caption on a photo. ”In fact, Steinfeld and her team went the extra mile earlier this year, packaging and shipping exclusive hoodies and stickers by hand from her kitchen. “My kitchen became a temporary BS warehouse to get these hoodies sealed and shipped,” she revealed, showing the level of hands-on effort behind the brand.Now a newlywed, Steinfeld hasn’t shied away from sharing glimpses of her personal life with subscribers. Reflecting on her May 31 wedding in Santa Barbara, she recently wrote, “I’m sitting here with Josh. And we’re reminiscing on the best weekend of our lives for the millionth time.” These quiet moments, shared directly with fans, are what set her apart.Also Read: How did Josh Allen and Hailee Steinfeld meet?
