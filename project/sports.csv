Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, co-owners of 'Birch by Romeo Lane' nightclub in Goa, were detained by Thai police early on Thursday on the request of Indian law enforcement agencies. As their passports were suspended, they became persona non grata in Thailand, prompting the local police to take them into custody, sources said.Sources said that a team of Thai police located them at Hotel Indigo in Patong, Phuket, based on their travel and passport details and seized their belongings and luggage. Their pictures in Phuket police's custody were released on Thursday and showed the duo handcuffed. They were subsequently shifted to the immigration detention centre where they are likely to be lodged till their deportation. The cops are hopeful of the brothers' return to India by the end of this week with formal channels in communication with each other.

A preliminary investigation by Goa police and Directorate of Fire Services found it was triggered when electric firecrackers struck the wooden ceiling. As flames coursed through the roof, guests and performers bolted. While most of them were able to step out of the club, many were trapped in the basement after the exit caught fire.Besides a partner named Ajay Gupta, five staff members of Birch, chief general manager Rajiv Modak, gate manager Priyanshu Thakur, bar manager Rajveer Singhania, general manager Vivek Singh, and operations manager Bharat Kohli have been arrested till now.","Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, co-owners of 'Birch by Romeo Lane' nightclub in Goa, were detained by Thai police early on Thursday on the request of Indian law enforcement agencies.

Messi’s Kolkata Visit Turns Chaotic As Angry Fans Vandalise Banners At Salt Lake Stadium

KOLKATA: Frenzy at dawn. Fury by noon. Chaos by afternoon. Lionel Messi's much-hyped Kolkata appearance collapsed into bedlam at Salt Lake stadium Saturday after tens of thousands of fans who paid steep prices for a glimpse of the football icon saw him for barely minutes - if at all - before he was whisked away, triggering vandalism, pitch invasion and mass outrage.Around 60,000 fans, many in Argentina's blue-and-white stripes with ""Messi"" emblazoned on their backs, packed the stands from early morning. Tickets cost between Rs 5,000 and Rs 16,000. Expectations soared. Tempers snapped.Argentina's World Cup-winning captain stepped onto the pitch at 11.30am to a deafening roar. Within moments, he was engulfed by a crush of VIPs, officials and selfie-seekers. Fifteen minutes later, with the crowd around him refusing to thin out, Messi and Inter Miami teammates Luis Suarez and Rodrigo De Paul were pulled out for security reasons. The stands never got their moment.On the way out, Messi was briefly introduced to former India cricket captain Sourav Ganguly, who had just arrived and taken a seat in a makeshift tent on the pitch. Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan, scheduled to do a ceremonial lap with Messi, Suarez, De Paul and Ganguly, never entered the stadium. He waited outside, then left as the situation spiralled.When it became clear Messi would not return, the stadium exploded.The stadium — refurbished for the 2017 Under-17 FIFA World Cup — bore the brunt of the anger.Police were overwhelmed. Fearing a stampede, DGP Rajeev Kumar rushed to the venue and led crowd-control efforts for nearly 90 minutes. Officers avoided a lathi-charge, mindful of narrow exits and packed concourses. CM Mamata Banerjee, en route to the stadium, turned back after being briefed on the scenes. “Deeply disturbed and shocked by the mismanagement,” she wrote on X, ordering a probe to fix responsibility and recommend safeguards for future events.For Kolkata, it was a bitter contrast to memory. Messi’s visit in 2011 ended with Argentina beating Venezuela 1-0 at the same venue. This time, the superstar landed in the city early Saturday, attended a sponsor programme at his hotel, then arrived at the stadium smiling, waving and greeting former India players. Surrounded by politicians, celebrities, organisers and VIP pass-holders, he was scarcely visible to the paying crowd. “We never imagined the day would end in such a chaos,” said former India forward Dipendu Biswas, who managed to get his jersey signed.Behind the collapse lay a single, glaring problem: too many people where none should have been. Messi struggled to take a step as hundreds clustered around him .","Messi's much-hyped Kolkata appearance collapsed into bedlam at Salt Lake stadium.

Vin Diesel confirms Cristiano Ronaldo’s Fast & Furious involvement

What a Fast & Furious role means for Cristiano Ronaldo’s future

Cristiano Ronaldo is one of the best footballers the sport has ever seen, and now his legendary status could be set to follow him from the pitch to Hollywood. In an update that is sending shockwaves to fans of both sport and cinema, Fast & Furious star Vin Diesel has announced that a part has been penned for the Portuguese great in the massive action movie franchise. Now, Diesel's public statements have lent some real weight to what may have started as online speculation.This crossover opportunity represents a unique intersection of elite football and blockbuster filmmaking. Cristiano Ronaldo has solidified his status as one of the best and most recognizable soccer players in the world, so he definitely wouldn't look out of place in the Fast & Furious series as it gets back up to speed following the series finale next year.Vin Diesel recently ignited a global frenzy with a social media post that included Cristiano Ronaldo and a note that directors have already penned a role for the football icon. Although no casting announcement has been made, Diesel's confirmation seems to confirm months of fan speculation about Ronaldo's addition to the franchise.Diesel's post originally included references to Los Bandoleros, a short film that is part of the Fast & Furious universe, but he later deleted those mentions.That edit has only sparked speculation as to whether Ronaldo's role will be linked to an upcoming feature film as opposed to archival or side-project material. This level of secrecy about the role likely points to a surprise the studio intends to spring ahead of the film's release.As for Cristiano Ronaldo, his first steps off the pitch have already begun, and a potential entry in the Hollywood scene may not be that far from happening in the future. While the five-time Ballon d'Or winner continues to perform at the highest level with club and country, he has never kept his desire to venture into the film and entertainment industry a secret.It would be one of the biggest athlete-turned-actor crossovers in recent memory for a Fast & Furious appearance. Footballers have popped up in movies before, but with Ronaldo's fame and brand status, the occasion could become a cultural one. Ronaldo compliments the franchise's focus on all things physical, speedy, and bombastic.Fans will now wait for more confirmation on just how big a part Ronaldo will be and whether it will appear in the next installment. Whether as a cameo or as a more central character, his involvement would bookend both a new chapter of his career and of the long-running Fast & Furious saga.Also Read: Cristiano Ronaldo business empire: Full list of his companies, brands and side ventures in 2025",Vin Diesel confirms Cristiano Ronaldo's Fast & Furious involvement.

There is admiration, reflection, and a sense of time closing in on an era few believed possible.Speaking candidly, Dwyane Wade did not hide the emotion tied to watching James still perform at an elite level. His appreciation felt personal and honest.“I’m like you guys, I’m a fan. I know it’s like, ‘he’s old, he should retire’.

He admitted his burst was fading and the joy was gone, even as a Hall of Famer. Since retiring, Wade thrives as a businessman, media voice, and NBA owner, while proudly supporting his daughter Zaya.Wade recently revisited another iconic chapter with humor while recalling the famous Big Three introduction. His memory of that moment revealed both restraint and foresight.“Let’s run that tape who was it again. It’s one voice and look at the one in the middle laughing like young boy over here was talking… he was feeling the moment… look I look put my head down, look I put my head down, ‘I’m like hey man look now I’mma supportive teammate.'”“I’m my rubbing my knee I’m like ‘Oh I don’t know if I got that much… He trippin’, look I ain’t said a word… That was that supposed to have been a moment that was just for our fans and it should not have been the world should not have seen.”“That’s something that you say internal, you know what I mean? We going to win every year but really you know how hard it is to win one year. I don’t care what kind of talent you have so that’s why I was sitting there like oh my man don’t know yet.”“But he did go to the Finals 10 years in a row though. He damn sure didn’t like about how many opportunities. He almost did it, he ain’t lie… Listen, we went 4, he went 10.”LeBron James is not stopping despite recent injury setbacks.

While the Steelers have not placed him on injured reserve, Tomlin confirmed he will miss Week 15, leaving the defense with a significant void.The Steelers currently sit atop the AFC North, and Monday’s meeting with a playoff-bound Miami team carries enormous weight. Without Watt’s league-leading pass-rushing presence, the pressure now shifts to Alex Highsmith, Nick Herbig and, most intriguingly, fourth-round rookie Jack Sawyer.Sawyer, a national champion at Ohio State and a fan favourite in Pittsburgh, has spent much of his rookie year rotating on defense while becoming a fixture on special teams.He has played just 19% of the Steelers’ defensive snaps but now appears poised for a season-high workload.Coaches have praised his development and discipline, and Sawyer has already shown flashes of his pass-rushing potential. His lone sack of the season came back in Week 2 against the Seattle Seahawks, when he burst through the line untouched in a well-timed blitz. That play is now being revisited, as Monday’s matchup could place Sawyer in a similar blind-side scenario.Because Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa throws left-handed, Sawyer’s role on the weak-side could create natural opportunities to pressure the passer, especially if defensive coordinator Teryl Austin employs creative looks to compensate for Watt’s absence.Steelers fans have embraced Sawyer’s style, seeing shades of the franchise’s traditional edge-rushing identity. With Watt sidelined, Sawyer now has the chance not only to contribute but to make a meaningful impact in a game that could shape Pittsburgh’s playoff path.The Steelers will continue to monitor Watt’s recovery, and early reports suggest he may return before the end of the regular season. But until then, Pittsburgh must rely on depth, and Sawyer’s emergence could be one of the most important developments of the Steelers’ late-season stretch.For Sawyer, Week 15 is more than an opportunity. It’s a proving ground.","T.J. Watt ruled out for Monday night's game against the Miami Dolphins. Rookie Jack Sawyer set for season-high workload in Watt's absence. Steelers currently sit top of the AFC North ahead of Dolphins clash. Watt's brother, JJ, revealed that the injury stemmed from dry-needling treatment gone wrong.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125949818,imgsize-1705690,width-400,resizemode-4/jack-sawyer.jpg"
Patrick's wife Brittany Mahomes’ ‘best look yet’ party moment hits as Chiefs sit 6-7 and the noise gets louder,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/patricks-wife-brittany-mahomes-best-look-yet-party-moment-hits-as-chiefs-sit-6-7-and-the-noise-gets-louder/articleshow/125950338.cms,"Brittany Mahomes hosts a “Chiefs girlies Christmas party” and draws strong fan reactions as Kansas City faces late-season pressure.

Brittany Mahomes turned the ‘Chiefs girlies Christmas party’ into a fashion headline

Patrick Mahomes got public backup, and Brittany Mahomes answered with 3 words

Brittany Mahomes turned her “Chiefs girlies Christmas party” into the kind of Instagram moment that instantly got picked apart, praised, and reposted. She hosted the get-together this week for the Kansas City Chiefs’ wives and girlfriends, then shared snapshots that put her white mini dress and oversized black bow front and center, per reporting from Yahoo (Madz Dizon) and Us Weekly (Grace Riley).The timing is part of why it popped. Kansas City is 6-7 after a loss to the Houston Texans, and the Chiefs are heading into a key stretch with the Los Angeles Chargers next on the schedule. While Patrick Mahomes keeps the football talk short, Brittany keeps showing up as the loudest off-field presence in his corner, and she is not shy about it.Brittany Mahomes, 30, posted her look ahead of hosting the “Chiefs girlies Christmas party” on Instagram on Dec. 11, according to Us Weekly. The outfit was built around a fitted white minidress with a high neckline and cape sleeves, finished with a large black bow across the chest. She matched it with sheer black tights, pointed-toe heels with bows, diamond dangling earrings, and a black clutch decorated with crystals and pearls, per both outlets.The comments did the rest. Yahoo noted fans flooding her page with reactions like “This is prob my fave look for you ever!” and “Your best look yet!! Stunning,” along with “You look pretty as a present.”Us Weekly added that Brittany later posted party gift bags and credited brands she partnered with, writing: “Hosted the Chiefs girlies Christmas Party Tonight! ✨🎄,” followed by: “Thank you to the best partners for spoiling us!!! @whoop @hydrojug @boggbags @dolceglow @amazon @abercrombie @diviofficial. ”She did not confirm a full guest list. Us Weekly specifically noted she did not share which Chiefs WAGs attended, or whether Taylor Swift was there.Brittany’s party posts landed during a rough patch for Kansas City. One report framed it plainly: the Chiefs are 6-7 after the Texans loss, and they are running out of room to slip if they want to keep their postseason hopes alive.The same report also tied Brittany’s social moment to the bigger conversation around Patrick Mahomes, which has gotten louder with every loss. On the “Up & Adams” podcast, Kevin Durant pushed back hard on any legacy talk, saying: “What kind of a question is that? That makes no sense at all,” and adding, “If anybody is questioning Pat Mahomes’ legacy from a one-off year, he can miss the playoffs for the rest of his career, I don’t give a damn. This man is Patrick Mahomes.” Durant continued: “How many championships does he have? Three? Come on now. Are we really going to question Pat Mahomes, Chris Jones, Travis Kelce? He’s still an all-time great, potentially the greatest of all time.”Brittany saw the clip circulate and replied: “Let them know.” Mahomes also credited her in his weekly interview on 96.5 The Fan, saying: “Having a great wife helps out a ton,” and “Her being able to handle the other extracurricular stuff I can’t be there for… getting the family settled.” He also added: “I was able to spend Thanksgiving with them because we played on Thursday. That part was cool.”If Kansas City steadies itself against the Chargers, this week reads like a tidy headline. If the Chiefs stumble again, Brittany’s posts will keep getting treated like a side plot to the main drama: the league is watching Mahomes, and she is making it clear she is watching right back.","Brittany Mahomes hosted a ‘Chiefs girlies Christmas party’ and drew strong fan reactions as Kansas City faces late-season pressure.

Philip Rivers earnings 2025

Aaron Rodgers earnings 2025

2013: 5-year, $110 million extension

2018: 4-year, $134 million deal (ultimately valued near $180 million with bonuses)

2022: 4-year, $200 million extension with $153 million guaranteed

2023 (Jets restructure): Three-year, $112.5 million with heavy upfront bonuses

Who comes out on top?

Also Read:

Philip Rivers and Aaron Rodgers belong to two different quarterback generations, but in 2025, both remain prominent figures in NFL discussions. One for an unexpected midseason return, and the other for his long-running status as one of the league’s highest earners. With both players’ financial histories in focus again, many fans are asking: who comes out on top when comparing their career earnings, contract structures and off-field income?Here’s a detailed look at how the two quarterbacks match up in 2025.Philip Rivers retired in 2021 after a 17-year NFL career, finishing with more than $240 million in salary alone. His largest deals came during his time with the Chargers, including a six-year, $92 million extension in 2009 and a four-year, $84 million extension in 2015.After one final season with the Indianapolis Colts in 2020, earning $25 million. Rivers stepped away to coach high school football, seemingly closing the chapter on his pro salary.But 2025 delivered an unexpected rewrite. With the Colts losing Daniel Jones to a season-ending injury, Rivers signed a practice-squad contract in December 2025. While the financials of that short-term deal are minimal compared to his past earnings, the move shifts the timeline on his Hall of Fame eligibility and brings his career income back into conversation.Off the field, Rivers’ estimated net worth stands at around $100 million, supported by coaching income, limited endorsements and long-term savings rather than major commercial deals.While Rivers built a strong earnings profile over nearly two decades, Aaron Rodgers’ financial resume stands in a different league altogether.Rodgers’ career earnings through 2022 alone exceeded $360 million, including both salary and endorsements. His long-running State Farm partnership, golf-related sponsorships, and apparel collaborations add tens of millions to his income beyond football.In terms of contracts, Rodgers has repeatedly reset the quarterback market:If Rodgers completes his current contract, his NFL salary will surpass $463 million, making him the first player in league history to cross the $400 million threshold in on-field earnings alone. With endorsements added, Rodgers’ total projected earnings approach $600 million.In pure financial terms, the comparison isn’t close. Rodgers leads Rivers by a massive margin, both in contract value and in sponsorship income. His status as a multi-time MVP, Super Bowl champion and one of the NFL’s most marketable players has translated into record-setting paydays.Rivers, though extremely successful and consistently among the league’s highest-paid players in his prime, belongs to an earlier salary era - before mega-extensions reshaped the market.Still, both quarterbacks carved out lucrative careers reflective of their eras, and Rivers’ surprise 2025 return ensures his financial legacy extends just a bit further into the modern NFL.","Philip Rivers retired in 2021 after a 17-year NFL career, finishing with more than $240 million in salary alone.

Evolving financial position driven by expanding careers

Projected net worth trajectory of Jey Uso and Takecia Travis through 2025

Jey Uso's financial picture has really taken off in recent years, thanks to the WWE giving him a big push as a singles performer. This has sent his yearly earnings soaring almost $1 million, which has helped put his personal net worth at about $3 million. This is considered massive for any WWE wrestler in 2025.Takecia Travis, on the other hand, keeps a pretty low profile outside of the wrestling world but throws in around $200,000 from family investments and a small business or two. So when you put their finances together, the Uso's have a combined net worth of about $3.2 million. You can see how their wealth has just grown steadily as Jey's star has risen and Takecia's been quietly handling the day-to-day stuff.Jey's pay varies depending on the storyline of the match. For now, he's in that top end of the WWE salary bracket, which, of course, is great for the couple's long-term financial prospects as they're still getting paid out for appearances and merch as well.His connection to the Anoa’i family sustains long-term demand, giving him opportunities beyond weekly programming, such as live-event bonuses and external partnerships that contribute meaningfully to his income.Takecia keeps a pretty low profile but is just as crucial to the show as she's the one who manages the family day to day and keeps the spending in check when Jey's on the road and wrestling schedules get all over the place.Their financial situation is growing but it's a steady & predictable thing. Not huge leaps forward but more like a gentle rise that matches the rhythm of Jey's wrestling career and the long-term plans they have.Jey’s singles popularity continues trending upward, and WWE’s investment in keeping him on major cards means he is likely to maintain or slightly increase his earnings through the year. His marketability tends to go up any time the company decides to go all in on the Bloodline storyline, which usually causes merch sales and appearance paydays to skyrocket.Takeica's financial impact remains pretty low-key but sensible, shoring up the household with a steady hand and a level head, whilst Jey's schedule is looking more like a rollercoaster than a predictable train ride.All things considered, theyre probably poised for some steady financial progress rather than an overnight success, thanks to a steady supply of WWE cash and some solid long-term thinking on family planning.Also Read: WWE Saturday Night's Main Event: John Cena's final match, full match card, preview, date, start timings for all regions, how to watch, and more details",Jey Uso and Takecia Travis have a combined net worth of about $3.2 million.

Kyle Tucker and Tarik Skubal emerge as bold Los Angeles Dodgers targets

Kyle Tucker is back at the center of MLB offseason talk, and this time the Los Angeles Dodgers are thinking very big. On Friday, December 13, multiple MLB insiders reported that the Dodgers are exploring bold trade ideas that could bring both Kyle Tucker and Tarik Skubal to Los Angeles in the same offseason. The talks picked up after the Dodgers recently added Pete Alonso and Edwin Díaz earlier this week.Tarik Skubal and Bo Bichette are also part of the growing buzz. While the Dodgers look at ways to add more star power, the Boston Red Sox are closely watching Bo Bichette as they try to fix infield gaps before spring training begins in February.Kyle Tucker, who currently plays for the Houston Astros, has become one of the most talked-about names in trade rumors this week.On Friday, ESPN’s Alden Gonzalez said on a Dodgers-focused show that Los Angeles has the talent and money to make something big happen.“They might even do both,” Alden Gonzalez said. “They can go after Kyle Tucker with a short deal that pays a lot each year, or they can use their pitching depth to get Tarik Skubal.”Tarik Skubal is under contract with the Detroit Tigers and is entering the final year of his deal in 2026.The Tigers are expected to discuss an extension this winter in Detroit, but league executives believe a trade could happen if talks stall.Skubal has been one of baseball’s best left-handed starters over the past two seasons and finished near the top of Cy Young voting, according to MLB.com If Los Angeles adds Tarik Skubal, the move would strengthen a rotation that already features several All-Star arms.Any deal would likely involve young pitchers and prospects, something the Dodgers have built plenty of in recent drafts.Bo Bichette is also shaping the market. One of the most expensive infield alternatives on offer will be the former Toronto Blue Jays shortstop.On Friday, MassLive reporter Chris Cotillo reported that the Boston Red Sox are among the teams monitoring Bo Bichette closely.Boston is looking for help after recent infield changes and injuries last season at Fenway Park. Bo Bichette is known for steady offense and strong contact hitting.According to Baseball Reference, he owns a career batting average close to .290 and has multiple All-Star selections.Bo Bichette missed time last season with a knee injury but returned before the postseason and remained productive.Along with Bichette, the Red Sox are also discussing internal options and veteran depth pieces such as Jorge Polanco as they plan their roster for Opening Day in late March.With winter meetings ongoing across the league, these talks are expected to stay active heading into January.Also Read: Kyle Tucker Leaves Big Impression At Blue Jays Tampa PDC As John Schneider Reveals What Stood Out",Kyle Tucker and Tarik Skubal emerge as bold Los Angeles Dodgers targets.

Meet Kelli Moore: Everything to know about Sherrone Moore’s wife after his shocking firing





Unexpected news has shocked University of Michigan football. Sherrone Moore, the Wolverines' head coach for just two seasons, was fired after it was alleged that he had a ""inappropriate relationship with a staff member. "" Fans, players, and the larger college football community were all taken aback by the December 2025 announcement. Athletic Director Warde Manuel confirmed the decision, stating, “U-M head football coach Sherrone Moore has been terminated, with cause, effective immediately. Following a University investigation, credible evidence was found that Coach Moore engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. This conduct constitutes a clear violation of University policy, and U-M maintains zero tolerance for such behavior.”Sherrone Moore’s departure has also turned attention toward his personal life, particularly his wife, Kelli Moore. Married since 2015, the couple has long maintained a balance between the high-pressure world of college football and a private family life. Kelli has mainly avoided the spotlight despite Sherrone's prominence in the sports world, giving their three daughters: Shiloh, Solei, and Sadie--a consistent presence.Curiosity about Kelli and her place in the Moore family has grown since the scandal has taken center stage in the media.Kelli Moore has quietly stood beside her husband through years of demanding seasons and public scrutiny. She and Sherrone Moore tied the knot in July 2015 after he proposed in December 2014. Reflecting on their early years together, Sherrone shared a heartfelt tribute in 2018 on Instagram: “Happy three year anniversary to my life partner and best friend. So proud of you and all your accomplishments. I am so happy and blessed beyond measure to call you my wife as the man upstairs leads us to live through him. Love you soo much and excited about what the future holds for us! #skforevermoore #bestfriends #Lifegoalsmeet.”The couple shares three daughters: Shiloh, born in 2019; Solei, born in 2022; and Sadie, whose birthdate has not been publicly shared. Kelli has been a familiar figure at games, whether supporting Sherrone during his time with the Central Michigan Chippewas, or cheering from the sidelines and stands at the University of Michigan. While she avoids social media limelight, friends describe her as devout, family-oriented, and deeply committed to raising their children in a values-driven home.The whole Moore family is currently under intense scrutiny. Sherrone's dismissal has caused a stir in college football, bringing Kelli's personal life into the spotlight. She must manage the fallout from her husband's career-altering controversy while providing stability for their young daughters as the couple nears their tenth wedding anniversary. Although the specifics of the alleged improper relationship are still unknown, Michigan has reaffirmed its zero-tolerance policy. For Kelli Moore, this time represents an unanticipated and difficult phase in a life she has carefully avoided media attention.Also Read: Why Sherrone Moore ended up in police custody amid Michigan firing him for alleged ‘inappropriate relationship’ scandal","Sherryrone Moore was fired by the University of Michigan after just two seasons.

Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier speak out as judging concerns grow before Olympic season



Should Piper Gilles & Paul Poirier have won bronze at Grand Prix Final instead of GBR duo?

Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier left the Grand Prix Final in Nagoya, Japan, with more questions than answers. The Canadian ice dance pair believed they had delivered their strongest free dance of the season. It was a performance built on confidence, control, and experience. Still, the judges did not reward them with a medal.Gilles and Poirier finished fourth after narrowly missing the podium by just 0.06 points. The result was especially painful given their recent consistency at the world level. The outcome has sparked emotional reactions online and has sparked a debate about judging fairness in ice dance.After the scores were announced, Gilles admitted the result was hard to accept.She said, “It definitely is disheartening. We can’t lie, we’re human. We skated two successful programs, and we emotionally and physically felt so in shape and powerful in those moments, to kind of be left questioning what we’re doing, Is it enough?”The veteran duo dropped from third after the rhythm dance to fourth overall. British pair Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson edged them out in the first meeting of the world’s top six teams this season.Following the event, Gilles posted a quote online about athletic truths being “diminished and manipulated by people with agendas,” tagging the International Skating Union. Her husband, Nathan Kelly, also criticized the result in a comment. Even the couple’s dog account joined the discussion, which later drew mixed reactions.Gilles later addressed fans directly, expressing gratitude despite the disappointment. She wrote:“The ISU and the state of ice dance can’t take any of those things from me!”She acknowledged the risks of speaking out but felt it was necessary. Gilles said, “I felt like I needed to state that and let my emotions fly a little bit. But I am proud about speaking out and sharing my concern because if no one does it, nothing will change.”As Canada’s top Olympic ice dance hope, the pressure is growing. Gilles and Poirier are in their 15th season and may be nearing the end of their careers. Their scores now trail defending world champions Madison Chock and Evan Bates by nearly 12 points.For now, their goal remains clear.

What to expect from John Cena vs GUNTHER and other key storylines

WWE includes John Cena's farewell this weekend as we lead into Saturday Night's Main Event on Saturday, December 13, 2025, where Cena will have what WWE is promoting as his final in-ring match. The match with GUNTHER, which emerged from a build with GUNTHER via the booking of the ""Last Time Is Now"" tournament, is set to be a hard-hitting, technical exhibition aimed at giving Cena a big send-off while also pushing the opponent forward at the same time, at the same venue.The entire event is packed with multibrand showdowns and title ramifications, including Undisputed WWE Champion Cody Rhodes vs. NXT Champion Oba Femi, AJ Styles & Dragon Lee defending the World Tag Team Titles, and Bayley vs. Sol Ruca in a premier women’s division bout. WWE has carded the show as streaming live on Peacock in the US and regional broadcasts outside of the US.Saturday Night’s Main Event is scheduled to begin at 8:00 p.m. ET / 5:00 p.m. PT on December 13 in the U.S., exclusively on Peacock for American audiences. International fans can watch via WWE’s global distribution partners, including Sony Sports Network and SonyLIV in India, as well as WWE’s own channels in select regions.The 8:00 p.m. ET start converts to 1:00 a.m. GMT (UK, December 14), 6:30 a.m. IST (India, December 14), 11:00 a.m. AEST (Australia, December 14), and 10:00 a.m. JST (Japan, December 14). Viewers should check local listings for possible pre show programming or minor scheduling adjustments as WWE often updates timing for kickoff segments.Get ready for an evening with a nostalgic feel with a competitive edge. Cena can say farewell to the company where he spent the majority of his two-decade career, and GUNTHER's character has made it clear that he plans to ruin the moment by putting Cena through a long technical loss instead of the emotional moment we would all like to see. That dynamic creates the environment for either a heroic send-off for John Cena, or a conclusive changing of the guard from one of WWE's most successful 21st century stars.In the meantime, on that same card, Cody Rhodes takes on Oba Femi in a hypothetical champion versus champion match-up that could alter the course of two titles as we head into 2026. AJ Styles and Dragon Lee roll on as World Tag Team Champions, Bayley’s match with Sol Ruca highlights WWE Putting Bright New Talent Up Against Established Stars, and why veterans like Kevin Owens have a way of spelling it out on WWE Raw.With Cena’s final bell looming, Saturday Night’s Main Event is positioned to deliver both emotional weight and competitive drama across a packed card.Also Read: WWE pays heartfelt tribute to John Cena ahead of last match at Saturday Night Main Event","Saturday Night’s Main Event is scheduled to begin at 8:00 p.m. ET on December 13, 2025.

Golden State Warriors vs Minnesota Timberwolves - Game Prediction

The Minnesota Timberwolves are set to be in Golden State Friday night. They travel to San Francisco to take on the Warriors. On Monday, the Wolves fell against the Phoenix Suns. Julius Randle led the team with 21 points and a team-best 8 assists. Anthony Edwards had a team-high 40 points. Edwards also added nine rebounds.On the other hand, the Golden State Warriors are coming back to their arena after a break of four days. They are all set to prepare for the match against the Minnesota Timberwolves at the Chase Centre. Although Stephen Curry was present at the full practice on Wednesday, his coming back from his quadriceps injury still makes him doubtful. The heavyweights have decided to confront each other with great injuries on both sides.On Friday, December 12, at Chase Centre in San Francisco, the Wolves will meet the Warriors. The game is set to start at 9PM EST. NBA TV and FanDuel Sports Network will broadcast the game. Additionally, the Timberwolves app and iHeartRadio's Timberwolves channel will provide the fans with access to the game's radio broadcast. Furthermore, fans can stream the game online on Prime Video.Before the Phoenix Suns ended their five-game winning streak, Minnesota will be trying to get back to winning ways as soon as possible.According to DraftKings, the odds for this match point to a close game that might as well go to the very end.The Wolves have a winning record of 7-5 when playing on the road. They have won 6 out of their last 10 games. Additionally, they are positioned at the 13th spot in the defense ranking with an average of 113.4 defensive rating and the 8th spot in the offense rating with an average of 117.9 offensive rating. On the other hand, the Warriors' attack is significantly influenced by the non-availability of their leading scorer.Although Golden State anticipates a number of reinforcements in the near future, some key players are still doubtful based on the injury report for this game. The Timberwolves, on the other hand, have a more assured roster because they haven't announced any significant confirmed absences.The Wolves have taken advantage of the few days between games following their most recent game on Monday to regroup and tighten things up, something Rudy Gobert thinks will be beneficial.Also read: Jonathan Kuminga moving to Sacramento Kings?

Justin Verlander’s net worth from MLB earnings and long contracts



Kate Upton’s net worth shaped by fashion, films, and branding

Their combined net worth and life built beyond fame

By 2025, Justin Verlander and Kate Upton have built a life that blends elite sport with global pop culture. Their combined net worth draws interest because it reflects years of steady success rather than sudden fame. One career was shaped by discipline on the baseball field. The other grew through fashion, film, and smart brand choices. Together, their wealth tells a story of patience and planning.What stands out is how naturally their careers complement each other. Verlander’s earnings came from long MLB seasons and carefully structured contracts. Upton’s income evolved as she moved beyond modeling into business and influence. Their financial journey feels measured, not flashy, and that is why it has lasted.Justin Verlander’s net worth (according to Celebrity Net Worth) in 2025 is estimated at around $200 million, earned almost entirely through his Major League Baseball career. Contracts with the Houston Astros and New York Mets placed him among the highest-paid pitchers of his era. Those salaries rewarded consistency, leadership, and postseason performance.What separates Verlander from many stars is timing. He stayed effective well into the later years of his career, allowing him to maximize earnings when experience mattered most. With career earnings projected to pass $400 million by 2026, his financial legacy reflects durability more than hype.Kate Upton’s net worth (according to Celebrity Net Worth) in 2025 is estimated between $20 million and $30 million. Her rise began with iconic Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue appearances that turned her into a global fashion name. High-profile campaigns followed, bringing steady income during her peak modeling years.Acting roles in films such as The Other Woman expanded her reach, but her recent focus has shifted toward beauty, fitness, and brand partnerships. Today, her earnings come from influence, ownership, and staying selective about where her name appears.Together, Justin Verlander and Kate Upton have a combined net worth estimated at around $220 million in 2025. The number reflects balance rather than extravagance. Verlander brings long-term stability through baseball salaries. Upton adds flexibility through fashion, media, and business ventures.Their shared wealth is built on careers that grew steadily and evolved with time. In a world of short attention spans, their financial story stands out for its staying power. In the end, their story shows that lasting success comes not just from talent, but from knowing when to grow, adapt, and protect what truly matters.Also read: Also read: Inside the fairytale life George Springer shares with his wife Charlise Castro who built her own path before the spotlight","Justin Verlander and Kate Upton have a combined net worth estimated at around $220 million in 2025.

Stephen Curry’s wife, Ayesha Curry, reveals the NBA legend fails to understand that a woman is trying to pursue him



Stephen Curry’s wife, Ayesha Curry’s recent comments has raised eyebrows



Stephen Curry and his wife, Ayesha Curry , have been together for a very long time, even before the star player started playing in the NBA.While both Stephen Curry and Ayesha Curry have built a beautiful life for themselves and their four children, she had opened up about how the NBA legend is unable to understand when a woman is trying to pursue him.A couple of years ago, in 2019, Stephen Curry’s wife, Ayesha Curry, made an appearance on the now discontinued show, Red Table Talk, which was hosted by Jada Pinkett Smith.As Stephen Curry’s wife, Ayesha Curry, reflected on her life, she opened up about women pursuing her husband.Stephen Curry’s wife, Ayesha Curry, said, ""But there have been a couple of times, where I've wanted to punch somebody in the face for sure…”The popular chef added, “He can't see it coming, I see it from a mile away.""Stephen Curry’s wife, Ayesha Curry, continued, ""Stephen is very nice by nature…Everything is always very friendly, sometimes to the point where, 'I'm a grown woman,' so, I'll just insert myself and be like, 'Hello, how are you doing?'""Despite the attention that Stephen Curry has reportedly received from other women over the years, the Golden State Warriors’ star player has remained committed and faithful to his wife, Ayesha Curry, and their children.While Stephen Curry is praised for this, his wife, Ayesha Curry, attracted a lot of criticism over the last few months.A few months ago, in August 2025, Stephen Curry’s wife, Ayesha Curry, appeared on the Call Her Daddy podcast where she revealed that she had many different plans for her life in her younger days.This includes not wanting to get married and not having children.Stephen Curry’s wife, Ayesha Curry, said, “No. I didn’t want kids.

NEW DELHI: Lionel Messi’s programme in Hyderabad on Saturday offered a clear contrast to the disorder seen earlier in Kolkata, as the second leg of the GOAT India Tour passed without disruption and ended on a smooth note.After a troubled start in the City of Joy, Hyderabad offered a setting where the event was allowed to breathe. The structure held, the crowd stayed in place, and the programme ran as intended, drawing a clear line between what had gone wrong earlier in the day and what was put right later.Messi arrived in Hyderabad at around 5.40 pm, following a difficult opening leg of his three-day, four-city GOAT India Tour 2025. Telangana chief minister A Revanth Reddy received him at the Taj Falaknuma Palace before the Argentine headed to the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium.The stands were close to full when Messi walked out, dressed simply in a green crew-neck T-shirt, black trousers and sports shoes. This time, there was no rush, no scramble. He stayed for about an hour, at ease, moving through the programme without the strain that had cut short his time in Kolkata.“I am very happy to be in Hyderabad in the midst of all the love and affection shown by you all,” Messi said through a translator, acknowledging the crowd.Messi, along with Inter Miami teammates Luis Suarez and Rodrigo De Paul, took part in the GOAT Cup penalty shootout, with Revanth Reddy also joining them on the field in football attire. The players later conducted football clinics for children before the formalities drew to a close.Senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi joined the group towards the end of the event during the felicitation ceremony, with photographs taken in front of the sponsor hoardings lining the ground.Messi presented the GOAT Cup to Singareni RR 9, winners of the seven-a-side exhibition match and a team representing the chief minister. Reddy presented a memento to Messi, while Gandhi handed one to Suarez.Before stepping onto the field, Messi spent time inside the stadium, looking at photographs on the walls and speaking with officials. He waved to fans from behind a glass barrier, then later offered glimpses of the touch and control that have defined his career, juggling and passing the ball with Suarez, De Paul and Reddy. A slow walk around the stadium followed, with Messi acknowledging the crowd along the way.Earlier in the day, scenes in Kolkata were very different. Around 50,000 spectators, many of whom paid between Rs 4,000 and Rs 12,000 — and in some cases up to Rs 20,000 in the black market — were left angry as politicians, VVIPs and security personnel surrounded Messi, limiting visibility for fans.The situation escalated when spectators threw bottles, which are banned inside stadiums. Food packets were also found inside the venue. Chairs were pulled out and thrown, and fibreglass seats were damaged across the field and the synthetic track.Messi will travel to Mumbai on Sunday for the third leg of the GOAT India Tour 2025. He will conclude his visit on Monday in New Delhi, where he is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi.","Messi arrived in Hyderabad at around 5.40 pm, following a difficult opening leg of his three-day, four-city GOAT India Tour 2025.

A complaint has been lodged against Sarwagya Singh Kushwaha, who recently made headlines as the youngest-ever FIDE-rated chess player. According to a report from The Indian Express, the complaint questions the legitimacy of his achievement, suggesting unfair means were used to obtain the rating.The complaint specifically alleges that his three opponents were coaches from the same academy where he trains.""It appears that the rating was achieved through unfair means, involving clear violations of FIDE's fair play principles by the coaches or individuals supervising the games,"" the complaint reads.The young prodigy from Sagar, Madhya Pradesh, has support from his father Siddharth Singh Kushwaha and coach Nitin Chaurasiya.While acknowledging the complaint filed with FIDE, they dismiss the allegations as factional politics within the Madhya Pradesh chess federation.""In Sagar, there are two factions in the local chess body. One faction is trying to target the other by trying to prove my son's record came by unfair means,"" Siddharth said.The young player secured victories against Abhijeet Awasthi (1,542), Shubham Chourasiya (1,559), and Yogesh Namdev (1,696) in tournaments across Khandwa, Indore, Chhindwara, and Mangaluru.These matches gained attention as his opponents were older and higher-ranked players. The complaint raises concerns about these opponents, stating they are coaches at the same academy where Sarwagya trains in Sagar.""Just because these people are from Sagar and we know them, it cannot prove that there was anything unfair. I know these three people by face, as someone who also runs a chess academy. They are like our competitors,"" his father added.Additional concerns have been raised about one particular tournament where both Sarwagya and Namdev allegedly joined after the initial draw.Reports suggest they were manually added to the draw and paired against each other.In the same tournament, Sarwagya reportedly lost a 10-minute rapid game on time after visiting the washroom during the final minutes.","Sarwagya Singh Kushwaha recently made headlines as the youngest-ever FIDE-rated chess player.

Shivam Mavi opens up on IPL snubs, lonely domestic grind, confidence before auction

By the time the Indian team reached the HPCA stadium on Saturday evening, the temperature here in the hills had started to drop. As the three-and-a half-hour long practice session progressed in chilly weather, the jitters in the Indian camp became apparent. South Africa have managed to reveal India’s deficiencies in more ways than one would have expected on this tour. Seldom does the Indian team go through a practice session as extensive and in tense on a match eve as it did on the eve of Sunday’s third T20I.As is the norm with this team, it was officially an optional session. But only Tilak Varma and Arshdeep Singh skipped the session. The South African team, on the other hand, took the day off and went hiking in the hills. They feel they are in a better space with the series locked at 1-1.The T20 team under coach Gautam Gambhir seemed to be on auto-pilot mode for over a year. However, two months away from the T20 World Cup, problems have surfaced. It starts with the struggles of captain Suryakumar Yadav and vice-captain Shubman Gill and spills over to some incomprehensible strategies and selections.Saturday was more about going back to basics. When Washington Sundar was padding up at the top of the nets session, Hardik Pandya approached him and cautioned him, “This is a pitch where you have to be gutsy.”The pitch here has historically yielded big scores. But one can never discount the amount of movement and bounce the venue offers to the bowlers.The focus of the nets sessions was on polishing every batter’s technique. Once Sanju Samson and Washington Sundar were done with their batting in the nets, Surya and Gill hogged the attention for the rest of the evening. They hopped all four nets. Surya, in fact, batted for well over 90 minutes — that’s how long an entire team’s T20 innings lasts. They went through drills that are seen more at the academy level, where one works on the nuances of batting technique. Gill and Jitesh only joined Pandya for a range-hitting session under lights at the centre square after a thorough session of old-school batting in the nets.Surya, for one, eschewed his trademark pick-up ramps and swipes behind square on the on side against the pacers. The vertical bat and a compact defence were the order of the day. He did get into a phase where he dealt in sweeps and lap shots against the spinners. As he started to get beaten frequently, he switched to playing down the ground and practicing the inside-out shots over cover.Surya is the designated No. 3 in this batting lineup. But Axar Patel coming out to bat at No. 3 in the second over in the previous match must have hurt the egos of the frontline batters. Tilak Varma expectedly put it down to the team’s much-hyped flexibility.“I’ve told the team that I can bat in any situation. But we want to be flexible. Axar has done a good job for the team in the T20 World Cup. So, one has to be ready for whatever the team needs. But I don’t mind doing that job,” Varma said on Saturday.Playing the moving new ball has been a major problem. Gill just stuck to punching the ball off the back foot. His frailties against the new ball pitching on a good length are well documented. The deliveries outside off have begun to catch the outside edge more often. Thus, one saw him working overtime on backfoot punches square of the wicket and uppercuts to make use of the field in the powerplay.As Surya retired to the dressing room, Gill hung back for a long and intense chat with Gambhir and assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate. For one who is obsessed about his batting, Gill must be aware there isn’t much time for him to iron out the chinks in his batting.As India try to find their best T20 game, South Africa seem to be more in control. “It might look as if we are slightly unsure given the amount of changes, but we have a pretty good idea of what our World Cup squad will be like,” South Africa coach Shukri Conrad said.","South Africa have managed to reveal India’s deficiencies in more ways than one would have expected on this tour.

IPL mini auction: Lot of interest for Cam Green | Wait ends for Prithvi Shaw, Sarfaraz Khan?

Usually, Jasprit Bumrah either does not train or just goes through the paces a day before a match. More often than not, he is one of the seniors in the team who chooses to skip these optional sessions. On Saturday evening, though, he turned up at the HPCA stadium, set up his own practice nets on the centre square and went through a rigorous session of bowling, focusing intensely on getting his yorker right.He didn’t bowl to any of the batters. It was just Bumrah, a camera stationed right next to where an umpire would be standing, a pair of boots and cones on either side of the crease. At the other end were the stumps, behind which bowling coach Morne Morkel kept watch.For a good 45 minutes, Bum rah went full throttle. It was a solo act in perfecting yorkers. These drills are usually carried out when one starts out bowling yorkers. In essence, he has gone back to the drawing board.Since the time he burst on to the scene, Bumrah and toe crushing yorkers have become synonymous. Over a period of time, he has mastered the all round art of fast bowling so well that he has always been in control of proceedings.Hence, unnerving Bumrah is one of the toughest jobs for opposing teams. Yet, he has managed to identify what has been lacking in his bowling of late.In the second T20I against South Africa in New Chandigarh, Bumrah failed to execute his yorkers. Interestingly, since he resumed his T20I duties in the Asia Cup in Sept after a gap of 14 months, he hasn’t looked incisive enough.It also could be that the opponents have decided to play Bumrah out more cautiously, preserving wickets to target the other bowlers. “I think on a night when he’s off, you’ve got to take what you can get because I don’t know when you’re going to get it again. We don’t plan too much around the match-ups, just whatever it allows us on the night. If the batters are in, we obviously want to take on the aggressive options,” South Africa coach Shukri Conrad replied to a query on how they prepare for Bumrah.“I’m sure he’ll be back to his best again tomorrow night or maybe later on in the series. You have to factor in the conditions. Maybe the ball was a little bit wet,” he added, choosing his words very carefully, probably not wanting to poke the bear.Bumrah, by his own lofty standards, would know he hasn’t been able to make an impact as consistently as he was used to. The assault carried out on him by the South African batters two days ago must have stirred something in him.","Jasprit Bumrah went through a rigorous session of bowling, focusing intensely on getting his yorker right.

The NFL legend highlights John Cena’s influence beyond titles as his final match approaches

Tom Brady was not part of John Cena’s world, at least not on paper. Different sports, different crowds, different stages. Yet as Cena moves toward his final match, Brady’s words found their way into the moment, offering something quieter than praise and heavier than nostalgia.Retirements often arrive with long speeches and rehearsed emotion. This one felt different. Cena’s career has stretched across eras, pressure, and constant reinvention. Brady did not talk about wins or fame. He pointed to impact, to the people reached along the way, and to a kind of influence that stays after the lights dim.Brady’s tribute did not try to sum up Cena’s career. It did not need to. The message stayed focused on something deeper than records, something harder to measure. Impact. The kind that reaches people who never step into the ring but still feel connected to what happens there.“Hey John, Congratulations on an incredible career. You have impacted lives, so many people inside the rain and outside the rain. Good luck in your last match.”The line stood out because Brady knows how endings work. He has lived through them, stepped away, returned, and finally closed the door on his own terms.That perspective gives his words weight. By pointing to Cena’s influence both inside and outside the ring, Brady acknowledged the work that rarely gets attention. The discipline. The consistency.That kind of visibility carries weight. It asks more than performance. It demands consistency, patience, and restraint, year after year, even when the attention does not slow down.For Cena, influence was never limited to titles or scripted moments. Fans watched how he handled responsibility, how often he showed up for causes that mattered, and how he stayed accountable in public. Brady’s message reflected that side of the story. It hinted that success is not only about what you collect along the way, but about the people who feel seen because of you.As Cena approaches his final match, the exchange feels understated, not sentimental. Two long careers brushed past each other through mutual respect. No shared arena. No rivalry. Just an understanding shaped by pressure, longevity, and the cost of staying relevant for so long. The kind that lasts long after the final bell rings.Also read: Brittany Mahomes & Patrick Mahomes vs Travis Kelce & Taylor Swift combined Net Worth: Who truly reigns supreme?","The NFL legend highlights John Cena’s influence beyond titles as his final match approaches.

According to NHL insider Elliotte Friedman, the Canucks have already dropped a hint to the league that they’re open to discussing a trade for Hughes. Given his contract situation, Vancouver has the flexibility to trade him to any team they want if a solid offer comes in.It is important to note that Quinn Hughes became the Canucks’ 15th captain in 2023 and quickly established himself as the most productive defenseman. In October 2025, he reached 410 points in 435 games, surpassing Alexander Edler’s record.Hughes won the 2024 Norris Trophy after posting a career-high 92 points and became the fastest player in franchise history to record 300 assists. He also secured 400 career points and finished with 76 points in 68 games, earning another Norris Trophy nomination.

Therefore, the Canucks can trade him anywhere they wish, and have indicated they are prepared to do just that,” he wrote.Giving a clear picture of the trade decision, Friedman also stated, “Of course, there’s no tampering in the NHL, but you can be certain any landing spot will want an idea if it appeals to the 2024 Norris Trophy winner.”He also mentioned that the Capitals might be open to a two-year stint with Hughes, even if there's no guarantee of an extension. “A few teams believe Washington, depending on the price, would consider a two-year stay, because there’d be something very special about another Stanley Cup run while Alexander Ovechkin remains a Capital,” Friedman stated. Besides these, some teams that are interested in making a move are listed as the New Jersey, Detroit Red Wings, and Philadelphia Flyers.","Vancouver Canucks captain Quinn Hughes might be on the move this season.

The story of Luthra Empire

Goa Club Owners Saurabh & Gaurav Luthra Arrested in Phuket After Deadly Fire

It was a spectacle. A magnet for travelers

The fallen empire

GOA/NEW DELHI: Investigators have discovered a corporate web spanning 42 companies and LLPs, many sharing a single Delhi office address—classic signs of corporate layering and potential money laundering.Agencies are preparing for deeper scrutiny.According to documents and GST details, brothers are linked with 42 firms, some of which are suspected to be shell entities.The findings have been communicated to agencies concerned for actions, sources said. This pattern of multiple entities sharing a single address and directors is a classic indication of corporate layering & potential money laundering,” a sleuth said.It began a decade ago in a quiet corner of Delhi’s Hudson Lane. A small, casual café called 'Mama’s Buoi' drew college students seeking cheap bites and music.It was unassuming, but for brothers Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, it was the first step into a world they would soon dominate.They were engineers by training—Saurabh, the self-styled “gold medallist,” bold and flamboyant; Gaurav, precise, methodical, the quiet architect behind the accounts.Together, they would build a brand that lit up nightlife. The turning point came with Romeo Lane.A modest success in Delhi’s Civil Lines, it became something else entirely when the brothers opened in Goa’s Vagator after the post-Covid tourism boom.Cliffs kissed by the Arabian Sea, fire performers leaping through the night, Bollywood beats pounding across open terraces—Romeo Lane was no longer a nightclub.A brand that malls fought to host, paying steep fees, agreeing to strict franchise contracts, eager to cash in on the Luthras’ magic.From Delhi to Indore, Nagpur, Agra, Dehradun—and even Dubai—the empire expanded at a breakneck pace. Birch by Romeo Lane and Caha joined the roster.Over 25 outlets now operate across India, with nearly 25 more reportedly in the pipeline. Few hospitality brands had ever grown this fast.But behind the glamour lay cracks.Franchisees sometimes thrived, sometimes struggled. Investors complained they were abandoned despite paying hefty fees. Consultants were chased, meetings went unanswered. Rapid growth had outpaced oversight.And then, the tragedy struck. March 2024 saw the opening of what the brothers called India’s first island bar—an ambitious outpost in Arpora, Goa.But safety rules were often ignored. Basements turned into kitchens.Local panchayat violations went unchecked. On a fateful December night, fire ripped through Birch by Romeo Lane, claiming 25 lives.The empire that once dazzled with lights, music, and spectacle now faces an uncertain future.Franchisees speak of abandoning the Romeo Lane name, running outlets independently. The glamour is gone. The empire, built in a decade, teeters on the edge.From a quiet café in Hudson Lane to the cliffs of Goa, the Luthra brothers’ story is one of ambition, excess, and tragedy. In the wake of the blaze, one question remains: can the empire survive its own fire?","Investigators have discovered a corporate web spanning 42 companies and LLPs, many sharing a single Delhi office address.
