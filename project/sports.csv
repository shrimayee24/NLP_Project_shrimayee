One batter who has defied any notion of slump in the last four years in the world of cricket is England's run-machine Joe Root . The 33-years-old is riding on the form of his lifetime for quite some time now.Root is so confident about his batting that he played an audacious reverse-ramp shot to bring up his 36th Test century against New Zealand in Wellington.In fact, since the start of the 2021, Root has been unstoppable, notching up as many as 19 Test hundreds and breaking an array of records on the way.No records in Test cricket is out of reach for the Englishman right now. He is already the highest run-getter for England and fifth overall on the list of most runs in Test history.At 12,886 runs, Root is just 492 runs away from Australian great Ricky Ponting , who is second in the list behind India legend Sachin Tendulkar . The kind of form he is in, Root will soon surpass the likes of Jacques Kallis and Rahul Dravid -- the other players ahead of him -- by next year.Only Tendulkar will be in front of Root, so how safe is the batting maestro's record of 15,921 runs, which looked unbeatable when the Indian retired more than a decade ago in 2013?Root is just over 3,000 runs behind Tendulkar at the moment, but he has the form to give the indication that he can and will have a go at the record. Tendulkar’s 51 Test century record is also not far away either.After the Sachin-Ponting era, the next Fab Four in cricket, especially in Tests, was Root, India’s Virat Kohli , Australia’s Steve Smith and New Zealand’s Kane Williamson . But the English batter has left the other three far behind in the last four years.Take for example, in comparison to Root's 19 Test hundreds since 2021, Williamson is the second best at nine centuries. Smith has added just six hundreds to his tally and Kohli just three during the period. If we take the overall cricketing world too, outside the Fab Four, nobody has scored more than eight hundreds during this period.Williamson remained second best among the century-makers during the period, followed by Harry Brooks at eight. After that Sri Lanka's Dimuth Karunaratne, Australia's Usman Khawaja and Marnus Labuschagne have notched up seven centuries each.Along with the century records, Root has amassed 5,063 runs at an average of 56.26 since the start of 2021 alone. No other batters have managed to touch 3,000 mark, with Karunaratne a distant second with 2,613 runs.En-route to this massive run accumulation, Root has become the highest scorer in fourth innings in Test history, surpassing Tendulkar's record of 1,625 runs. Root now has 1,630 runs in the fourth innings in Tests.He also joined the elite list of players to complete a century of 50-plus scores in Tests, becoming only the fourth batter ever. Here too, Tendulkar leads the list with 119 fifty-plus scores, followed by Jacques Kallis and Ricky Ponting at 103 each. Root now has 100 such scores, 36 hundreds and 64 fifties. So, this record also won't last long for sure!With 1,470 runs already this year, he is also on the verge of becoming only the second batter ever to amass 1500-plus runs in a calendar year twice, a feat only Ricky Ponting has achieved, in 2003 and 2005. Root previously crossed the 1,500-run threshold in 2021 during his exceptional run of form.",Joe Root is on the verge of breaking Sachin Tendulkar's Test run record. The 33-year-old has scored 19 Test hundreds since the start of 2021. Root is the highest run-getter for England and fifth overall on the list of most Test runs.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116126441,imgsize-59270,width-400,resizemode-4/116126441.jpg"
WrestleMania: From Roman Reigns vs Brock Lesnar to The Undertaker’s End Streak : WrestleMania’s Top 5 Moments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/wwe/top-stories/from-roman-reigns-vs-brock-lesnar-to-the-undertakers-end-streak-wrestlemanias-top-5-moments/articleshow/116147481.cms,"Credits: WWE

Triple H vs Sting in WrestleMania 31

The Undertaker’s streak ends in WrestleMania 30

The Montreal Screwjob

Brock Lesnar vs Roman Reigns in WrestleMania 34

Sasha Banks vs Charlotte Flair in WrestleMania 32

WrestleMania, often exclaimed as the monumental stage of them all, is where legends are born, rivalries are resolved, and history is made. Beyond the glamour and iconic showdowns lies a portrait of controversy that has defined its inheritance. WrestleMania is not just a presentation of athletic prowess; it’s a theatre of emotions, where decisions made in the ring echo far beyond the squared ring.This stupendous event has seen moments that not only shocked the viewers but also ignited heated debates and divided fans.Here are the top five instances that caused major controversies relating to WrestleMania.The match between Triple H and Sting at WrestleMania 31 was heavily promoted as a dream match, set against WWE ’s Golden Boy and WCW’s icon. Given the historical prominence of their rivalry during the Monday Night Wars, fans expectations touched the roof for expecting an action-packed night and its outcome.Despite the nostalgia and importance of Sting’s character as the face of WCW, the match eventually ended with Triple H’s victory over the veteran wrestler. This outcome devastated many fans since they viewed this as an opportunity by WWE to assert their dominance over WCW’s legacy. Another factor that led to the defeat of Sting was the unexpected interference from D-Generation X. Fans were left brawled with the portrayal of WWE as superior over its competition, making it a controversial moment in WWE history. The Undertaker ’s win streak was a dedicated element of WrestleMania, with his unbeatable record standing 21-0 before his match against Brock Lesnar. The streak went beyond storylines and became the cornerstone of WrestleMania’s allure. The crowd was stunned into silence when Brock Lesnar pinned down the WWE legend, leading to an end to his streak.Several factors contributed to making this match one of the most controversial of them all. Many fans believed that a renowned wrestler and athlete like Lesnar did not require this win to boost his career. The end was met with many mixed reactions; while some appreciated the bold storytelling, some viewed it as poor creative choices. The Undertaker’s streak end strengthened WrestleMania 30 as one of the most talked about events since the streak end deserved the emotional payoff it deserved.The Montreal Screwjob is one of wrestling’s disreputable controversies at the Survivor Series 1997 pay-per-view event. Vince McMahon formed a conspiracy with Shawn Michael and referee Earl Hebner to end Bret Hart’s WWF Championship match without him having a clue. Hart was obligated to lose the title to Michael via submission, even though he never tapped out. The root cause for this betrayal stemmed from Hart’s nearing exit from WWE due to his contract expiring soon and his refusal to lose the title in Canada.This instance damaged the trust between Hart and WWE, turned Vince McMahon into a hateful figure, and diminished the lines between scripted and real-life disputes, leaving fans and fellow wrestlers alike appalled.The match between Lesnar and Reigns in WrestleMania 34 was controversial mainly due to fan backlash and booking decisions by WWE. Despite the heavy promotion of Reigns as the ideal babyface, the crowd was vocal with his rejection and cheered Lesnar instead. The match was condemned for being overly repetitive, with multiple body slams and finishers, leading up to Lesnar's victorious in a surprising outcome.Fans had high expectations attached to Reign's victory, given his long build-up, but the call to have Lesnar win led to frustration, highlighting the disconnect between audience sentiment and WWE’s storytelling.The match between the two female top talents at WrestleMania 32 was not controversial in itself, but the surrounding occurrences caused devastation among fans. The controversy comes from the perception that Sasha Banks, who was extremely popular and riding a wave of fan support, was overshadowed as Charlotte won the title.Many fans believed that Banks deserved the title win to establish her position in the women’s division, especially at such a historic WrestleMania. Some felt that the reason for Charlotte’s win was to give her wrestling career a push since she was Ric Flair’s daughter, fueling debates about favoritism and storytelling decisions.ALSO READ: WWE Cancels Major Plans for Seth Rollins?

Rohit Sharma's struggle continues

NEW DELHI: India pacer Mohammed Siraj and Australia’s star batter Travis Head are reportedly under ICC scrutiny following a heated exchange during the second Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Adelaide. Australia won the match by 10 wickets, leveling the series 1-1.The incident occurred during the 82nd over of Australia's innings when Siraj bowled a stunning in-swinging yorker to dismiss Head. Following the wicket, Siraj gave Head a fiery send-off, gesturing aggressively towards the stands.In response, Head exchanged words with Siraj before walking off to applause from the home crowd.The incident triggered a backlash from the Adelaide crowd, which booed Siraj whenever he fielded near the boundary or came on to bowl, expressing displeasure at his conduct.According to The Daily Telegraph, both Siraj and Head are expected to face a disciplinary hearing for their on-field altercation. However, they are unlikely to receive suspensions, as such incidents typically attract milder penalties.Head, who was named Player of the Match, addressed the incident during a press interaction, revealing that he had said ""Well bowled, mate"" after hitting Siraj for a six prior to his dismissal. While he expressed regret over his reaction, he defended his decision to stand his ground.“It probably (went) a little bit far; that’s why I’m disappointed in the reaction I gave back, but I’m also going to stand up for myself. Like to think in our team, we wouldn’t do that. [It’s] not the way I’d like to play the game and feel like my teammates are the same. If I see that, I probably call it out, which I did,” Head said during the press conference.Siraj, however, disputed Head’s account in an interview with Star Sports ahead of Day 3.“When you get hit for a six on a good ball, it fires you up differently. And when I got him bowled, I only celebrated, and he abused me, and you saw that on TV, too,"" he told Star Sports.“I only celebrated at the start; I didn’t say anything to him. What he said in the press conference wasn’t right, it’s a lie that he only said ‘well bowled’ to me. It’s there for everyone to see that that’s not what he said to me. We respect everyone; it’s not like we disrespect other players. I respect everybody because cricket is a gentleman’s game, but what he did wasn’t right. I didn’t like it at all.”By Day 3, tensions seemed to have eased. The two players were seen chatting when Siraj came out to bat during India’s second innings, signaling that they may have put the incident behind them.","Mohammed Siraj and Travis Head reportedly under ICC scrutiny following heated exchange.

BENCH KIRK COUSINS! Falcons vs. Vikings Highlights & Reaction: Time To Start Michael Penix

The Atlanta Falcons Have A Problem That Go Beyond Kirk Cousins



The Atlanta Falcons Can Still Make It To The Playoffs



The Atlanta Falcons are going through a confusing, frustrating and stressful time currently. Many might think that Kirk Cousins is the black sheep in the team, pulling it down. He is injured and has not been able to throw a touchdown since the early weeks of November. Cousins has also not been able to throw 6 interceptions in the last 2 matches. The downfall of such a star player is concerning but he is not the only reason for Atlanta Falcon’s current miserable state. Currently, there are many rumours that say the Atlanta Falcons would probably trade Kirk Cousins during the offseason and might replace him with rookie Michael Penix Jr if Cousins is unable to perform and make the Atlanta Falcons enter the NFL Playoffs this season. On the other hand, there are also many discussions on the Las Vegas Raiders eyeing Cousins as a replacement for Aidan O'Connell's who injured his knee in Week 14 and has sustained a season ending injury.The Falcons’ offense side has been experiencing a lot of problems which includes poor coordination amongst players as well as poor communication. In the recent match against the Minnesota Vikings when the Falcons experienced a devastating loss of 42-21, it majorly has to do with the Atlanta Falcon’s offense. During their match against the Minnesota Vikings, Kirk Cousins was lost and did not target either Robinson or Allgeier once out of the backfield - a move that could have saved the day for the Atlanta Falcons.Kirk Cousins, once a star player of the National Football League, has had a poor run in the 2024 season of the NFL.However, no matter how difficult the situation the Atlanta Falcons seem to be in currently, they are still active in the race for the NFL Playoffs. Some of the upcoming matches they could win in include a match against the Las Vegas Raiders, the New York Giants, the Washington Commanders and the Carolina Panthers. Even though the Atlanta Falcons do have high chances of making it to the NFL playoffs, it is only possible if Kirk Cousins gets back his momentum and commitment towards the team.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s Eras tour set a record no one expected, with Travis Kelce supporting her every step of the way There are also many debates around if Cousins should be replaced by Michael Penix Jr, who was selected during the first round of the 2024 NFL draft. While there are no official confirmation on it, there is a chance that Cousins might be replaced if he continues making mistakes. With a torn Achilles that Cousins had sustained in the last season, things dont look too bright currently for the star player. Only time will tell what will be happening with the Atlanta Falcons this season of the NFL.","The Atlanta Falcons are going through a confusing, frustrating and stressful time currently.

Los Angeles Lakers vs Portland Trail Blazers: The Verdict

The Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Portland Trail Blazers in the Crypto.com Arena tonight. Thanks to this win, the Lakers have improved to 13-11 on the season while the Trail Blazers fall to 8-16. The Lakers managed to win despite missing LeBron James, their best player this season.But, it is worth noting that D’Angelo Russell and Anthony Davis did well to pick up the slack in James’ absence. The Blazers, on the other hand, just couldn’t get it going and Shaedon Sharpe led the team in scoring with a measly 19 points.Continue reading to learn more about the box score, best performers, and more from this matchup.- Anthony Davis: 30 points, 11 rebounds, and 1 assist- D’Angelo Russell: 28 points, 5 rebounds, and 14 assists- Deandre Ayton: 14 points, 19 rebounds, and 1 assist- Shaedon Sharpe: 19 points, 7 rebounds, and 3 assistsIt comes as a shock that the Lakers were able to beat the Trail Blazers without the help of LeBron James tonight. The Blazers’ biggest shortcomings in this match were their poor ball security which is evident from their 17 turnovers and their poor form from beyond the arc. Apart from this, Portland’s defense also left a lot to be desired and wasn’t compact enough to stop the Lakers’ lethal ball movement.Winning without James will be a massive confidence boost for the Lakers, hopefully, it will translate to more wins on the board. On the other hand, the Blazers need a mental reset if they wish to break their four-game losing streak. Hopefully, the Trail Blazers will put on a better display during their next outing.","The Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Portland Trail Blazers in the Crypto.com Arena tonight.

MOVING TO BRISBANE

NEW DELHI: Indian fast bowler Mohammed Siraj was fined 20% of his match fee, while Australian batsman Travis Head faced ICC sanctions following their heated verbal altercation during the day-night Test in Adelaide. Both players were found guilty of breaching the ICC’s Code of Conduct after a disciplinary hearing on December 11.The ICC stated, ""Siraj has been penalised 20% of his match fee after being found guilty of breaching Article 2.5 of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel.""The violation relates to using actions or language that could demean or provoke an aggressive response from a batsman upon dismissal.Head was also sanctioned for breaching Article 2.13 of the same code, which addresses player abuse during an international match.However, Head avoided a financial penalty for this violation.Both players received one demerit point each, marking their first disciplinary infringement in the last 24 months.""Both admitted their offences and accepted the sanctions proposed by Match Referee Ranjan Madugalle,"" the ICC added.The incident unfolded on day two of the Test when Head scored an impressive 140 runs off 141 balls before being dismissed by Siraj.

""What he said in the press conference wasn’t true. It's a lie that he only said 'well bowled' to me. It’s clear for everyone to see that’s not what he said.""Head later acknowledged his role in the incident.

NEW DELHI: The race to the ICC World Test Championship (WTC) Final has reached a thrilling stage, with South Africa surging to the top of the points table following a commanding 109-run victory over Sri Lanka in the second Test at St. George’s Park in Gqeberha.The win not only secured a 2-0 series sweep but also elevated the Proteas to 63.33 percentage points, placing them narrowly ahead of Australia, who hold 60.71 percentage points. India are currently third with 57.29 percentage points, while Sri Lanka sit fourth at 45.45 percentage points.South Africa's triumph came on the heels of Australia’s brief stint at the top, thanks to their dominant 10-wicket victory over India in the pink-ball Test in Adelaide.With 10 Tests left in the current WTC cycle, several teams remain in contention, though no side is guaranteed a spot yet in the final.Here are scenarios for all the contenders for WTC FInal as the business end of the cycle begins:South Africa, leading the table, have two home matches against Pakistan remaining. Winning just one of these Tests would ensure their place in the final. Even a 1-1 series result would leave them at 61.11%, a tally only India or Australia could surpass. However, if South Africa draw both matches, their percentage would drop to 58.33%, allowing India to overtake them with a 3-2 series win in Australia or Australia to surpass them with two wins in Sri Lanka. If South Africa lose the series 0-1, they would need to rely on Australia winning no more than two of their remaining five Tests or India securing no more than one win and one draw from their series in Australia.Australia, currently second, has three home Tests against India and two away Tests in Sri Lanka. They need at least two wins against India to secure a place in the final. A 3-2 series win over India would ensure Australia’s spot even if they lose both matches in Sri Lanka. However, if Australia lose to India 2-3, they would need to win both Tests in Sri Lanka to surpass India or depend on South Africa dropping points against Pakistan.India, sitting third, have a challenging task with three away Tests against Australia. To guarantee a spot, they need two wins and a draw, which would elevate their percentage to 60.53%, securing at least second place behind South Africa. If India win the series 3-2, they would finish at 58.77%. However, a 2-3 series loss would drop them to 53.51%, leaving their fate dependent on South Africa losing both Tests and Australia underperforming in Sri Lanka.Sri Lanka, with two home Tests against Australia remaining, have an outside chance of qualification. Winning both Tests would take them to 53.85%, but they would still rely on South Africa losing both matches and Australia beating India 2-1 with two draws to have a chance.Pakistan, currently at 33.33%, remain in mathematical contention but face an uphill battle. Winning all four of their remaining matches would leave them at 52.38%, just short of South Africa’s 52.78% unless South Africa lose one Test and drop below them at 52.08%. They would also need other results to go their way, making their chances slim.With England, New Zealand, Bangladesh, and the West Indies out of contention, the focus remains on South Africa, Australia, India, Sri Lanka, and Pakistan as the race intensifies. The upcoming clashes, especially India vs Australia and South Africa vs Pakistan, will be crucial in determining the finalists for the WTC Final.","The race to the ICC World Test Championship Final has reached a thrilling stage.

'Virat Kohli ki kamzori log pakad ke rakhe hue hai': Mohammad Kaif urges India to target Travis Head as Australians target Kohli,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-australia/virat-kohli-ki-kamzori-log-pakad-ke-rakhe-hue-hai-mohammad-kaif-urges-india-to-target-travis-head-as-australians-target-kohli/articleshow/116144336.cms,"Travis Head and Virat Kohli (X Photo)

Former Indian cricketer Mohammed Kaif observed that even a bowler like Scott Boland, who plays infrequently for Australia , understands Virat Kohli 's weakness. Boland targets the area outside Kohli's off-stump, inducing edges to the slips.""When Boland, someone who doesn't play consistently, knows how to exploit this, why can't we trap Travis Head? If his weakness is outside the off-stump, why don’t we consistently bowl there? Every batsman has weaknesses.""Kaif questioned India's strategy against Travis Head, emphasising the need to exploit his vulnerability outside the off-stump. He believes that if Boland can exploit Kohli's weakness, India should be able to target Head's known frailty. He highlighted that every batsman has their own weaknesses.""Virat Kohli ki kamzori log pakad ke rakhe hue hai, off-stump ke bahar ball daalo, wo waha out honge. You'll need to adopt the same strategy against Travis Head as well. You need to move ahead with proper planning. You need to attack him from the first ball; you need to make a fixed plan to exploit his weakness, and then you can get him out.""Kaif further elaborated on Kohli's weakness, suggesting that it is well-known and exploited by bowlers who persistently target the area outside his off-stump. He advocated a similar approach against Head, emphasising the importance of a pre-determined plan and attacking from the outset. Kaif believes focusing on Head's weakness from the first ball will increase the chances of dismissing him.""We are making mistakes. I don't believe this Australian team is so strong that we should be scared of them. We won the first match; Australia played well, so they won the second match, and now the series is 1–1. The Indian team is a strong side, and when we go to the Gabba, we will make a comeback.""Travis Head achieved a significant milestone on Saturday, setting a new record for the fastest century in a day-night Test at the Adelaide Oval against India. His performance helped Australia win the Adelaide Test by 10 wickets, earning him the player-of-the-match award.Head's blistering innings saw him reach 140 runs from just 141 balls, maintaining an impressive strike rate of 99.29.","Former Indian cricketer Mohammed Kaif observed that even a bowler like Scott Boland understands Virat Kohli's weakness.

Tom Brady’s net worth and LeBron James’ earnings look small next to Juan Soto’s $765 million contract,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/tom-bradys-net-worth-and-lebron-james-earnings-look-small-next-to-juan-sotos-765-million-contract/articleshow/116145194.cms,"Image via Getty

Tom Brady’s Net Worth Is Way Behind Juan Soto’s Current Contract Value



LeBron James’ Career Earnings For Over 21 Years Falls Behind Juan Soto’s Contract Value



While Tom Brady is a millionaire and has a net worth of around $300 million, according to CelebrityNetWorth.com , don’t mistake him to be the richest and the highest paid player when it comes to International sports. That record has been taken by Juan Soto, who according to a source of the Associated Press, has recently signed a contract with the New York Mets for a 15 year deal at $765 million.$765 million is not even double of what Tom Brady’s current net worth is at the moment. Juan Soto is currently 26 years old and made his major league debut in the world of baseball only in 2018 as opposed to Tom Brady who has been a part of the world of the National Football League since 2001. After winning 7 Super Bowls, Brady finally took a retirement in 2023 and now changed his career to become a sports broadcaster. One should also remember that Brady’s net worth of $300 million comes from his NFL salaries over the years, brand deals, advertisements, NFL contracts for over 12 years - he has not been able to reach $300 million only through his professional football career. Juan Soto has already made double of Brady’s net worth only through a single contract with the New York Mets - this says a lot about how quickly a career in international sports is becoming lucrative and profitable for both the owners and the players.Even though not a lot of information is publicly known about Juan Soto’s net worth, one can assume it to be much over $800 million since he also has brand deals and advertisements, added to his earnings from playing baseball professionally for the past 6 years.However, it is not just the former NFL star Tom Brady, Juan has beat when the discussion is all about net worth of such talented players. Interestingly enough, if one adds Tom Brady’s total salary earnings from the NFL and LeBron James, the popular professional basketball player of the Los Angeles Raiders’ total salary earnings from NBA, Juan Soto’s recent contract value beats both of them. LeBron had started his professional basketball career with the Cleveland Cavaliers way back in 2003 and is still actively playing with the Los Angeles Raiders in the 2024 season of the NBA and yet Soto crossed his earnings.Also Read: Clark Hunt’s family joins Tamba Hali’s tribute, with Tavia Hunt sharing special moments on Instagram While Soto’s recent contract value with the New York Mets has already sparked controversy and debates, it is still unimaginable how powerful these sport leagues are. At the age of 26, Juan Soto is just $300 million away from being a billionaire, which he will cross probably even before he turns 28.","Juan Soto has recently signed a contract with the New York Mets for a 15 year deal at $765 million.$765 million is not even double of what Tom Brady’s current net worth is at the moment. At the age of 26, Juan Soto is just $300 million away from being a billionaire, which he will cross probably even before he turns 28.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116145242,imgsize-58172,width-400,resizemode-4/116145242.jpg"

NEW DELHI: India's teenage cricket prodigy Vaibhav Suryavanshi , recently signed by Rajasthan Royals for Rs 1.1 crore in the IPL 2025 Auction, has become embroiled in an age-related controversy.The debate was sparked by former Pakistani cricketer Junaid Khan , who questioned the authenticity of 13-year-old Vaibhav's age following his extraordinary performance in the U-19 Asia Cup, deeming it exceptional for someone so young.Vaibhav delivered a sensational knock against Sri Lanka, scoring a blistering 67 runs off just 36 balls, featuring five fours and five massive sixes.His explosive innings not only made him India’s joint top-scorer in the tournament but also fueled speculation about how a player his age could demonstrate such power-hitting ability.Junaid, who has represented Pakistan in 22 Tests, 76 ODIs, and 9 T20Is, intensified the controversy by posting a clip of Vaibhav’s innings on social media, captioned: ""Can a 13-year-old kid really hit such a long six?""Vaibhav’s standout performance helped India secure a comprehensive seven-wicket victory over Sri Lanka, earning them a place in the U-19 Asia Cup final.However, India stumbled in the title clash, losing to Bangladesh by 59 runs.Chasing a target of 199, India were bowled out for 139 in 35.2 overs, with Vaibhav contributing just nine runs in a disappointing end to an otherwise impressive tournament.",Vaibhav Suryavanshi has become embroiled in an age-related controversy.

Model Says Giants Player Offered Free Tickets for Flashing to Distract Opposing Team



New York Giants ' season has been a rollercoaster of on-field struggles and off-field controversies. The latest bizarre chapter involves social media influencer Ava Louise and an alleged attempt to distract the New Orleans Saints during their recent matchup. And if these claims happen to be proven true, then it's wild, yes-- it's wild.High drama outside the MetLife on Sunday, as the New York Giants lost the game against the New Orleans Saints, by 14-11. A model Ava Louise, with over 400,000 followers on her Instagram account, alleged that a Giants player approached her and offered some ""cash"" for flashing saints, to distract the men during the game.According to Ava Louise, she was offered free tickets to the game in exchange for carrying out the stunt, which she outlined in a post on social media. She shared screenshots of messages from an unnamed Giants player, who allegedly asked her, “Hey sexy, got those two free tickets to the game if you do me a solid and flash the Saints to distract them.” The player reportedly kept his identity private, writing, “Can't have you put me on blast and get me fined $$ lol.”Ava Louise posted numerous pictures on Instagram from the game tagging Giants and adding #GoGiants. But she did not reveal whether she carried out the stunt or not. The entire affair has raised eyebrows, casting more bad light over what is a struggling team.While the reported distraction stint made news, it didn't do much to influence the performance with which the Giants have been associated. Once again, the team succumbed to a defeat at the hands of the Saints, adding to a torrent of dismay in a dissatisfying season. The agony of this horrible defeat gives the Giants a new and even worse record of 2-11, which then set the ball rolling for talk about leadership changes that might be coming in the franchise. With increasing pressure on head coach Brian Daboll and general manager Joe Schoen, the ship is sailing toward a major overhaul within the franchise.This isn't the first time Ava Louise made the headlines for outlandish acts. She was kicked out of another NFL game for doing something similar in 2023. While she has made quite some noise with such stunts, she hasn't really paid for Sunday's alleged incident. Whether the NFL or the Giants would follow through with the investigation is still not known.Also Read: Will Bill Belichick be a good fit for college coaching? Here's what Tom Brady had to say about this potential move As the Giants' season declines, some last bit of drama might really strike and cause them to combust. It surely complicates matters as the Giants constantly face burning questions over their future due to off-field distractions like this for such a stunt. It has much bigger fishes to fry; whether or not this drives further action, it definitely points in that direction as yet another dismal season winds to a close.","Model Ava Louise claims she was offered free tickets to the game in exchange for flashing the New Orleans Saints.

Rohit Sharma's struggle continues

NEW DELHI: Former Indian cricket captain Kapil Dev has downplayed discussions about Jasprit Bumrah being the potential successor to Rohit Sharma as Team India's Test captain.Kapil, talking to reporters at the launch of the Vishwa Samudra Open on Monday at the Delhi Golf Club, stressed the need for patience before drawing conclusions about a player’s leadership capabilities.“I think it's too early to talk about that (Rohit Sharma's successor). With one performance, you can't say he's one of the best, and with one bad performance, you can't say he doesn't deserve to be there,” Kapil, who is also president of the Professional Golf Tour of India (PGTI), said. ""Let a player play a lot of cricket, take on a lot of captaincy, and go through ups and downs. Then you judge a person by how they reacted during the difficult times—not the good times. In good times, there’s no need for judgment.""Citing Virat Kohli as an example of greatness, the former all-rounder, 65, explained, “We talk about character when someone is down or out. Take Virat Kohli, for example—one of the best cricketers this country has ever seen. If you list the top four cricketers, he will be there. So, if he's going through a rough time, it's up to him how fast he can bounce back and come back for the better.”The comments come in the wake of India’s crushing 10-wicket defeat to Australia in the second Test of theBorder-Gavaskar Trophy .After a dominant win in the series opener under the leadership of Bumrah, India faltered in the pink-ball Test in Adelaide.Having missed the first Test due to the birth of his second child, Rohit Sharma, who struggled with the bat, faced intense criticism, with many questioning his role as captain after a string of poor performances in Test cricket this year.Bumrah, currently serving as vice-captain, has shown glimpses of leadership potential, including a memorable win in Perth under his captaincy. However, as Kapil suggests, the road to leadership in cricket is long, and one match cannot define a player’s readiness for such responsibility.",Kapil Dev says it's too early to talk about Jasprit Bumrah as India's Test captain. The former captain says one performance cannot define a player's leadership potential.

Rohit Sharma press conference after loss in Adelaide Test vs Australia

NEW DELHI: South Africa claimed the top position in the ICC World Test Championship standings on Monday, displacing Australia following their decisive 109-run victory over Sri Lanka, whilst Team India now occupies third place after their Adelaide Test defeat. South Africa have accumulated 63.33 percentage points from 10 matches, with Australia following at 60.71 percentage points.India previously led the WTC standings after their significant victory in Perth during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy opener. They held 61.11 points before the Adelaide pink ball Test, which concluded within three days, resulting in their current position with 57.29 percentage points.Australia's percentage points increased from 57.69 to 60.71 following their Adelaide victory.Despite securing the top position on Sunday, Australia's leadership lasted merely one day as South Africa advanced following their triumph in the second Test at St George's Park in Gqeberha.With the Border-Gavaskar series level at 1-1, Australia hold a favourable position for securing a top-two finish.Former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali believes India face significant challenges in reaching the WTC final this time.India participated in both previous WTC finals, losing to New Zealand and Australia respectively. India's aspirations for a third consecutive WTC final appearance suffered significantly following their 0-3 series defeat against New Zealand at home.[Can India win the series 4-1? It seems difficult. Now, India should focus on winning the Border-Gavaskar series. Now, discussions will start about the whitewash against New Zealand. India will deeply regret that it was a huge mistake. No one could have imagined that the Indian team, which was defeated by England on their home ground, would be whitewashed by New Zealand. But this is what cricket is about. India is now bearing the consequences of losing that series],"" Basit said on his YouTube channel.[If India are out, Australia will have very bright chances. Australia have the advantage of five matches, while India only has three. Let's see. The final should be between India and Australia],"" he further said.To secure a final position, India require two victories and one draw from their remaining three Tests in Australia. This would elevate them to 60.53% and guarantee at least second place behind South Africa, as Australia's maximum potential finish would be 57.02% even with a 2-0 victory in Sri Lanka.A 3-2 series victory would place India at 58.77%, with Australia potentially finishing lower if they secure a 1-0 win in Sri Lanka. A 2-3 loss would leave India at 53.51%, allowing Australia, Sri Lanka and South Africa to surpass them. In this scenario, India's qualification would depend on South Africa losing both Tests against Pakistan and Australia securing at least a draw in Sri Lanka.",South Africa claimed the top position in the ICC World Test Championship standings on Monday.

Rohit Sharma's struggle continues

NEW DELHI: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has taken significant action against the USA's National Cricket League (NCL) just one year after implementing stricter guidelines for T20 and T10 leagues globally. The ICC has decided not to sanction future editions of the league.This decision was communicated to USA Cricket (USAC), according to a report by Cricbuzz. The letter cited NCL's failure to comply with player composition rules as the primary reason.The NCL was required to field seven USAC-affiliated or associate players. The league also violated sanction regulations, which were known to NCL officials before the event.The NCL had attempted to generate excitement by appointing high-profile ambassadors like Wasim Akram and Vivian Richards. Sachin Tendulkar and Sunil Gavaskar were also part of the league's ownership group. Despite the presence of these prominent figures, the league suffered from operational issues from the start.The ICC letter also alluded to problems with the NCL ""on and off the pitch.""Besides not adhering to the player composition rules, with six or seven foreign players fielded in multiple instances, the quality of the pop-up venue's pitches was also a concern. Bowlers like Wahab Riaz and Tymal Mills were forced to bowl spin to prevent injuries to batsmen.A previous report by Cricbuzz highlighted concerns regarding the league's handling of foreign players and possible violations of U.S. immigration laws.Sponsoring sports visas for an American cricket tournament with approximately six teams typically costs around $200,000.It was also learnt that not all players participating in the tournament entered the USA on valid sports visas, as per a Cricbuzz report earlier. This suggests cost-cutting measures were taken, especially given the lack of a clear revenue model.The USA has become a popular location for new T20 and T10 leagues. This is partly due to the financial resources of the South Asian diaspora eager to invest in the sport. The presence of nearly 60 first-class and international cricketers in the American cricket scene further contributes to the idea of establishing quick leagues.A report also disclosed that the ICC receives the highest number of applications for T20/T10 league sanctions from the USA.An ICC official revealed plans for a complete overhaul of the governing body's sanctioning process in the future.USAC appears to have taken the ICC's warning about the NCL seriously. USAC has chosen not to sanction the US Open T20, a long-standing weekend tournament with a history of over 10 years. The exact reasons for the disapproval are unclear, but it may be part of the ICC's broader effort to reset league sanctioning standards globally. This effort was hinted at by the ICC official.","The International Cricket Council has taken significant action against the USA's National Cricket League.

Four-wicket win for UP

Brief scores:

BENGALURU: Mohammed Shami , the cynosure at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium , played an important role to help Bengal secure a three-run win over Chandigarh in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy here on Monday.Shami, egged on by a vocal crowd, registered his highest T20 score of 32* (17b, 3x4, 2x6) to post 159/9 after his team at one point struggled at 114/8 in their pre-quarterfinal match. However, the focus was on his bowling fitness with the Indian team management also keeping a close tab for a possible return to the national squad for the remainder of the Border Gavaskar Trophy .The pacer took just three balls to send back Chandigarh opener Arslan Khan in the very first over. He stifled batters with his pace, touching around 135-140 kmph, and at times cramped the batsmen as he caught them leaden-footed. Shami looked back to be at his best as he bowled three overs during the powerplay without any fuss. He ran in at full steam and also got the new ball to move bothways.Though skipper Rohit Sharma recently spoke about a swelling on Shami’s knee during the domestic T20 competition, the fast bowler did not look in any discomfort. Even while running between the wickets, the star player looked sharp. However, if anything, the 34-year-old did get some back massage for a brief period after the powerplay. He took to the field two overs later with Chandigarh on 54/3 in eight overs.Watching the senior India pacer in action was Nitin Patel , head of BCCI’s Sports Science wing at the new Centre of Excellence. His team’s nod is vital if Shami is to leave for Australia anytime soon. Led by Shami, Bengal bowlers had the upper hand but Raj Bawa (32, 20b, 3x4, 1x6) looked in good knick. The latter was involved in a 45-run fifth-wicket stand with Pardeep Yadav and followed it with a 28-run partnership with Nikhil Sharma. Karan Sharma ’s 31-ball 48 helped UP defeat AP by six wickets in the other match.Bengal: 159/9 (Karan Lal 33, Writtick Chatterjee 28, Pradipta Pramanik 30, Mohammed Shami 32*; Jagjit Singh 4-21, Raj Bawa 2-27) bt Chandigarh: 156-9 in 20 overs (Bawa 32; Kanishk Seth 2-35, Sayan Ghosh 4-30).Andhra 156-6 (SDNV Prasad 34; Vipraj Nigam 2-20) lost to Uttar Pradesh 157-6 in 19 overs (Karan Sharm 48; K Sudarshan 3-22).","Bengal beat Chandigarh by three runs in Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy.

Brittany Mahomes Responds to Chiefs’ Critics



Patrick Mahomes led Kansas City Chiefs first clinched their playoff spot, then on Sunday night, in week 14 won the AFC West title for ninth straight season by beating Chargers in a narrow escape. The victory came to Andy Reid's team in the last few minutes as they found yet another way to beat the Chargers 19-17. This season, though Chiefs lost only one game and dominated the league, critics and analyzers are not being so good for them as some of them are saying that Mahomes and boys have been ""lucky."" The same discourse popped up even yesterday. But Brittany Mahomes has a sarcastic reply to all those critics.Every match has turned more and more intense, and this shows that the Chiefs this season are the real deal. They won their 15th one-point victory after an agonizing win against the Chargers on Sunday. This is a team that knows how to keep its fans on their toes.This is not just about winning narrowly; it also brings with it some history. Consequently, this win over the Chargers proved once again that the AFC West title belonged to the Chiefs for the ninth consecutive year. Such domination across a division is something that happens rarely in the NFL, thus prompting the question: is it possible for them to break New England Patriots' record of winning 11 straight division titles? However, that record may just be in jeopardy if the Chiefs keep this winning streak going.Sure, the Chiefs would not have been in this position without the magical performance of their star quarterback, Patrick Mahomes. His fourth-quarter game-winning drive set up a 31-yard field goal try for third-choice kicker Matthew Wright. Wright, who had hit three field goals earlier in the game, set up for that final kick to win the division. But then what happened was, the kick hit the left upright and doinked in off the post; much to the delight of Chiefs fans. The NFL's official account tweeted out that moment with the headline ""A DOINK FOR THE DIVISION! IT'S GOOD! @CHIEFS WIN!""It may even have inspired Patrick Mahomes' wife, Brittany Mahomes, to finally voice her take on the match: posting on Instagram an image of her directed away from the camera and accompanied by the caption “If you’re not laughing at this point, you’re no fun.” She gave a quiet jibe toward those critics in the understanding that a close game is going to be in the success column for the Chiefs this season.Also Read: Why Cowboys Cheerleader Zoe Dale stole the show while cheering for Bengals kicker Cade York Success has come differently for the Chiefs. They have blocked a last-second kick against the Broncos and somehow beaten the Raiders 19-17 on a botched snap, while still dominating their divisional foes. All these victories have firmly planted the Chiefs at the top of the AFC West, but for Mahomes, that's just par for the course.Following this victory, triumphantly crowned with AFC West Championship T-shirts and caps, the Chiefs have made their ninth trip. But Mahomes sees it differently, like every other routine in which he participates. It is by far the first goal every year. “Our first goal every single year to win the AFC West, and it’s a great division. We’re in a lot of rivalries where everybody’s played each other tough and three teams are going to probably make the playoffs. That speaks to the division that we play in.”One thing is certain: this has certainly been the season of twists and turns for the Chiefs, and it is clear that luck seems to favor them. But for some lucky moments, one would doubt whether or not their empirical way of dominance in the AFC West is as complete as it appears. No, the Chiefs, under the leadership of Mahomes, are prepared for anything that may come.","Kansas City Chiefs won the AFC West title for ninth straight season.

World Chess Championship: Dominant Ding Liren shocks D Gukesh to draw level at 6-6 with two games remaining,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/chess/world-chess-championship-dominant-ding-liren-shocks-d-gukesh-to-draw-level-at-6-6-with-two-games-remaining/articleshow/116155650.cms,"D Gukesh vs Ding Liren (PTI Photos)

What is the difference between a winner and a champion? Refer to Ding Liren ’s comeback win over D Gukesh in Game 12 of the World Championship Match in Singapore on Monday. The contest showed what a strong player can do when he is trailing and plays without fear. After his defeat in the 11th game at day earlier, Ding came out as a different player as he searched, found and converted the initiative in emphatic manner on Monday.The preceding game in which Gukesh had scored a win to take the lead and break the deadlock of seven successive draws, had at least offered some drawing possibilities to his rival. But Monday, Ding’s show was like a chanceless double-century in cricket.The reigning champion showed his true Elo 2800 colours to outclass, outsmart and outplay D Gukesh and level their 14-game match at six-all. His dominant win meant there was not one turning point in the position but a series of nuanced strong moves that put challenger Gukesh into submission. The most delectable of those was Kh7 on the 13th turn, shutting out the possibility of back-rank mate or perpetual checks.Ironically, Ding again missed the Na7 move (26th turn) in the second successive game of the match. While that was a defensive resource in the last game, it would have given him a rook for knight on Monday and could have hastened Gukesh’s resignation.Ding’s manoeuvrings of both rooks and queen in the back rank and using kingside knight and bishop for defence and queenside knight and bishop for the offensive was copybook stuff.The ‘two-goodness’ of the play was reflected by as many clear pawns in the b-file and three extra ones with other material being equal (queen, both rooks, both bishops vs queen, both rooks, bishop and knight) in a hopeless endgame for Gukesh. The 18-year-old resigned when checkmate became evident. It was over in 39 moves ofAgincourt variation (Kurajica defence) in the English opening. Ding’s high-class performance and its after-effects can be nothing less than an earthquake to the Indian’s fans. Thankfully, there Tuesday is a rest day which should help Gukesh decipher the new equation before the 13th and penultimate classical game on Wednesday.That Ding was enjoying it was evident when he smilingly analysed the game later, “I did not sleep (on the board) like I did in the last game.

There was no chance to spoil after such a good position.”Peter Leko gushed over the game on Chess24: “Ding’s Kings Indian (defence) background must have helped. At many points during the game, Ding played stronger than a supercomputer.”As a guest commentator during the ChessBase India webcast, Viswanathan Anand said of Gukesh’s much altered predicament, “A changed result (breakthrough win) affects you emotionally as the drawing rut has (also) affected you. The leader feels you are relatively risk-free. A loss affects you, but a win affects you too. You should not forget that.“Gukesh was also not completely (the same player and person) what he was (in the previous game, Sunday). Some part of you starts thinking ... a little relaxing.”","Ding Liren beat D Gukesh in Game 12 of the World Championship Match in Singapore on Monday. The contest showed what a strong player can do when he is trailing and plays without fear. The reigning champion showed his true Elo 2800 colours to outclass, outsmart and outplay D GuKesh.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116155713,imgsize-61998,width-400,resizemode-4/116155713.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Legendary cricketer Kapil Dev , the skipper of the 1983 World Cup-winning team on Monday has expressed deep concern over the struggles of former Indian batter Vinod Kambli Speaking at the launch of the Vishwa Samudra Open, Kapil, also the president of the Professional Golf Tour of India (PGTI), discussed the importance of self-accountability, stating, ""We can't look after anybody if he can't look after himself.""His heartfelt remarks come amid the growing worries about Kambli’s health and well-being.Kapil urged Kambli to prioritize his own recovery, saying, ""More than supporting him, he has to support himself. All the cricketers feel very sad seeing his current condition. I wish his closest friends would spend time with him and encourage him to go back to rehab, get rid of this illness.""While pledging support, Kapil stated that he is concerned about the well-being of his compatriot, adding, ""He has to first go back and look after himself. I am concerned as a sportsperson, and he has been going through a rough time.""Kambli's struggles became evident during a recent public event honouring his late coach, Ramakant Achrekar.At the memorial, attended by childhood friend and cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar , Kambli was seen exhibiting slurred speech and difficulty in maintaining composure.He emotionally clung to Tendulkar’s hand, underlining the bond they shared since their Shardashram Vidyamandir school days, where they famously stitched together a record 664-run partnership in a Harris Shield match.Kambli’s promising cricket career included memorable performances such as two Test double centuries. However, his international journey was cut short, with only 17 Tests and 104 ODIs under his belt.The cricketing fraternity, including Sunil Gavaskar and the 1983 World Cup-winning team recently extended its collective support. Gavaskar assured, ""What the '83 team wants to do is take care of him.

Rohit Sharma press conference after loss in Adelaide Test vs Australia

Rohit Sharma's struggle continues

NEW DELHI: India’s cricketing legend Kapil Dev came out in support of Rohit Sharma after the Indian captain faced criticism following the team’s defeat to Australia in the second Test in Adelaide .Speaking at the launch event of the Vishwa Samudra Open on Monday afternoon, Kapil, also president of the Professional Golf Tour of India (PGTI), addressed the concerns surrounding Rohit’s captaincy and recent performances.While urging patience, he acknowledged the challenges of leading a team and insisted that it is unfair to question a captain based on one or two poor performances.""I think he doesn't have to prove himself. He has done it for many, many years, Rohit. So let's not doubt somebody. I won't doubt him, and I hope his form will come back. That's more important. With one performance or two performances, you start doubting somebody's captaincy, someone who has done so well,"" Kapil stated.The captain of the 1983 World Cup-winning team emphasised that Rohit’s talent and ability should not be dismissed lightly. “I think six months back, when he won the T20 World Cup, you wouldn't have asked me this question. So that's what I want to say. Let it go. Let's see. If he keeps on not performing well, he won't be there. But knowing his ability and talent, he will bounce back,” he asserted.The second Test loss saw Australia equalise the series with a dominant 10-wicket victory.Rohit, returning to the team after missing the first Test due to the birth of his second child, struggled with the bat, managing scores of just 3 and 6.His decision to bat at number six, allowing KL Rahul to open, drew criticism from former players like Ravi Shastri and Aakash Chopra.Kapil Dev, 65, also dismissed questions about team selection decisions, particularly the choice of Harshit Rana over Akash Deep, adding, ""I am nobody (to judge). How can I judge the people who are sitting there and carrying the responsibility? If you are asking me, you are trying to spoil the system. We should not talk about it. We should just focus on whether he is playing well or not. That’s all we can see. How can I judge why they picked him? I’m not in that position, and my former colleagues are the ones sitting there. I trust they will do a good job.""Despite the criticism, Kapil Dev’s comments reflect the faith he holds in the current Team India skipper's resilience. The Rohit-led side prepares for the third Test at The Gabba, scheduled to start on December 14.","Kapil Dev has come out in support of India captain Rohit Sharma.

Drew McIntyre appeared at the event while fans were treated to a Seth Rollins promo. Additionally, fans got to witness the high-octane 8-man tag team match— The Final Testament vs. The Wyatt Sicks .World Heavyweight Champion Gunther made his way to the ring, reflecting on his 128-day title reign. He warned Finn Bálor that he had made a grave mistake by attacking him, setting the stage for their upcoming match at Saturday Night’s Main Event. Bálor, flanked by the Judgment Day, responded by claiming that Gunther's championship was due to his actions, and promised to walk away with the title after eight long years. Damian Priest intervened, leading to a chaotic brawl between the two factions.The Wyatt Sicks clashed with the Final Testament in the highly anticipated match. They have cleared the ring except for Kross. Uncle Howdy attempted a Sister Abigail on Kross, but The Miz pulled him out. The Authors of Pain dominated Joe Gacy and hit him with a spinebuster.

After several near falls, including a powerbomb by Kai, Morgan fought back as she avoided a kick. She finished the match with Ob-Liv-ion for the win.Result: Liv Morgan with the win.Drew McIntyre reflected on the grueling Hell in a Cell match at Bad Blood. He acknowledged that it was the most violent of his career he ultimately succumbed to blood loss.He further shared that the doctors advised him to stay home, but McIntyre pushed through to make his nickname the ""Scottish Warrior"" valid to the point. He recalled a moment after watching Survivor Series, where he saw Roman Reigns and CM Punk align with Sami Zayn and the Usos, leading McIntyre to question his past choices. “What if I’m wrong? What if everyone else was right?” he stated. It was then that McIntyre knew he had to return, targeting Zayn and Jey Uso to change his future.Seth Rollins took to the ring to call out CM Punk. The Visionary accused him of being a fraud and a conman. He recalled their past friendship and how Punk ghosted him and others after leaving WWE, only to return when the money was right.As Rollins was addressing Punk, Sami Zayn appeared to apologize for his earlier assumptions about Rollins and Jey Uso. Zayn then announced he would face Drew McIntyre at Saturday Night's Main Event. However, Drew McIntyre blindsided Zayn backstage, leading to a brief confrontation before WWE officials intervened.The first round of the Women’s Intercontinental Championship Tournament match started with Ivy Nile vs. Zelina Vega vs. Lyra Valkyria triple threat brawl.

After a series of near falls, Valkyria finally secured the win with Night Wing after breaking up Vega’s pin attempt.Result: Lyra Valkyria with the win.The New Day entered the ring, however, Kofi Kingstone and Xavier Woods met with loud boos and chants of “New Day sucks.” Woods and Kingston were confused but he pointed out that after 10 years of positivity, the crowd was upset over one day. “Nah, nah, nah. You mean to tell me, after the 10 years of positivity that Woods and I have given you, you mean to tell me that you’re this mad over one day?,” Kingston said. Woods added, “We came out here. We didn’t even do anything to E.” The boos continued as the crowd demanded Big E. “You know, we could’ve taken a steel chair to Big E’s back. We could have taken a sledgehammer to the back of E’s neck. Guys,” Kingston said attempting to justify his action. Finally, Woods dropped the mic and they went backstage.Rhea Ripley ambushed Raquel Rodriguez as she made her entrance. They brawled through the crowd. Rodriguez slammed Ripley into the barricade, but Ripley fought back with a missile dropkick and a trash can shot to the face.Also Read: WWE RAW on Netflix could feature uncensored crowd chants, reveals WWE president: ""It's gonna be X-rated for us old folks!""

Former fast bowler Dodda Ganesh has advised against India's captain Rohit Sharma opening the batting in the crucial third Test against Australia at the Gabba. He believes it's a risky move considering Rohit's current form and the challenging Brisbane conditions.India's batting order has been a topic of discussion following their performances in the first two Tests. They were bowled out for 150 in the first innings of the Perth Test and 180 in Adelaide.India won the Perth Test by a significant margin of 295 runs, thanks to centuries from Yashasvi Jaiswal and Virat Kohli. However, they suffered a heavy defeat in Adelaide, losing by 10 wickets within three days.There's been discussion about Rohit returning to the opening position. He missed the first Test and batted in the middle order in the second, allowing KL Rahul to open with Jaiswal.Ganesh expressed his concerns on social media regarding Rohit opening the batting.""Rohit Sharma is already short of confidence and runs. Experts urging him to open at the Gabba is foolhardy, to say the least. The series is not being played in the sub-continent where he can throw his bat and get some runs. It will be a lamb to the slaughterhouse if he opens,"" Ganesh posted on X.Ganesh believes Rohit's lack of confidence and the demanding Australian conditions could lead to further struggles.Rohit's performance in SENA countries (South Africa, England, New Zealand, and Australia) has been a subject of discussion throughout his career. In 46 innings in these conditions, he averages less than 30, contrasting sharply with his strong performances in the subcontinent.While Rohit has experienced some success as an opener, his average of 37.8 in SENA countries in this role is significantly influenced by his performance in the 2021 series in England.His impressive 127 at The Oval is a highlight, achieved through technical adjustments to handle swing and seam bowling.

Following the India-Australia day-night Test, former off-spinner Harbhajan Singh discussed India's performance and their strategy for the remaining matches. He analysed the second Test and offered suggestions for improvement.Australia secured a resounding 10-wicket victory at the Adelaide Oval, propelled by Travis Head's impressive century and strong bowling from Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins Harbhajan pinpointed a key area for India to address in the upcoming matches. He emphasized the importance of building stronger partnerships with the bat.""One area where India would like to improve is the partnership. We need to have big partnerships. We didn't get a good partnership in Adelaide because of which we did not have enough runs on the board. If we have 300-350 on the board then our bowlers have the capability to bowl them out,"" Harbhajan said while speaking to Star Sports.Australia bounced back from a heavy home defeat to level the Border-Gavaskar Test series at 1-1 after a comprehensive 10-wicket win in the second Test against India on Sunday.Pat Cummins took 5-57 as he bounced out the Indian lower order, with the visitors crashing to 175 all out in their second innings for a slender 18-run lead.Usman Khawaja and Nathan McSweeney then guided Australia safely to a ten-wicket victory to ease the pressure that had been building since the hosts were humbled by 295 runs in the 1st test at Perth.","Australia secured a resounding 10-wicket victory at the Adelaide Oval, propelled by Travis Head's impressive century and strong bowling from Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins.

NEW DELHI: Legendary Kapil Dev has always been a passionate advocate for sports, and over the years, golf has become one of his closest companions.Reflecting on his love story with golf, Kapil, replying to a question raised by TimesofIndia.com, candidly shared that had he played golf alongside cricket , he believes it would have sharpened his focus, potentially adding 2,000 more runs to his cricketing tally.""If you play golf, you understand,"" Kapil remarked at the launch of the Vishwa Samudra Open on Monday afternoon. ""I thought cricketers were mad. In the evening, they only talk about cricketers. A golfer is a thousand times madder than a cricketer. They lie in bed at night thinking, 'I should have played that shot better, I missed that putt.'""Kapil's comparison between golf and cricket shines a light on the mental focus required for both sports. He explained that while golf may seem easier when you step onto the course, it can often lead to surprising results.""That’s the beauty of this game - even when you're sleeping, you're thinking, 'If only that putt had gone in, it would have been so much fun.' I think it's really fascinating. When you first step onto a golf course, you feel like you'll play 10-12 under par, but when you finish, you're usually 10-12 over par. The mind is sharp, but the body doesn't always respond the same way,"" he shared with a laugh.Opening up about how golf could have influenced his cricketing career, Kapil said, ""I am not saying that I have played cricket to the highest level. But I wish I'd played golf while playing cricket. I would've 2000 runs extra in cricket because this game will teach you how to concentrate so hard for every ball.""Kapil's remarks come at a time when he is not only sharing his love for golf but also actively promoting the sport in India.As the president of the Professional Golf Tour of India (PGTI), he announced the launch of the Vishwa Samudra Open, which will take place at the Delhi Golf Club from December 10-13, 2024, with a prize purse of INR 2 crore.On the field of cricket, Kapil Dev boasts a remarkable career, having played 131 Tests and 225 One Day Internationals (ODIs) for India between 1978 and 1994. With 5,248 runs in Tests, 434 wickets, and 3,783 runs in ODIs, he is considered one of cricket's finest all-rounders.Most notably, Kapil led India to its first-ever World Cup victory in 1983, a historic moment that changed the trajectory of Indian cricket forever.","Kapil Dev has always been a passionate advocate for sports, and over the years, golf has become one of his closest companions.

Rohit Sharma press conference after loss in Adelaide Test vs Australia

Rohit Sharma's struggle continues

NEW DELHI: Former Indian cricketer and national selector, Jatin Paranjape , maintains his faith in Rohit Sharma 's capabilities, despite the captain's underwhelming performance in the crushing defeat to Australia in Adelaide. He expects Rohit to bounce back in the three remaining matches of the series.Returning to the number six position in Test cricket after a lengthy gap of six years, Rohit managed only nine runs across both innings at Adelaide Oval. His recent Test form has been concerning, with an average of just 11.83 in his previous six matches.Questions have also been raised about Rohit's captaincy decisions, particularly regarding his bowling strategies and field placements.This was evident during Travis Head 's dominant 140-run innings, where India's tactical approach appeared passive, with minimal use of short-pitched deliveries despite Head's known difficulties against such bowling, and defensive field settings.""I know he’s had a really bad run in the last few Test innings. But I think form is temporary, and class is permanent. I have a very, very good feeling about Rohit Sharma coming good, as let’s not forget that he’s a Mumbai batter.""They are known to kind of win against you when things are hard. I thought he was a bit off-colour in this Test match at Adelaide, but I’m sure that he will bounce back There’s nothing wrong in his batting, but he just needs to get an hour or two under his belt on the field,"" Paranjape told IANS.He also believes Rohit should resume his role as an opener in the third Test in Brisbane, starting on December 14.""Being back in the opener’s slot is something which is a comfort area for him. So I expect him to come back into the top slot to open with Jaiswal and have KL Rahul batting at five. I also thought he was a bit off with his captaincy on the first couple of days and I’m sure he will turn it around in the next three matches to come.""","Former Indian cricketer and national selector, Jatin Paranjape, maintains his faith in Rohit Sharma's capabilities.
