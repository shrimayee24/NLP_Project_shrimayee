NEW DELHI: Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) fast-bowler Yash Dayal took to social media to express his admiration and respect for Virat Kohli , the former Indian captain.Dayal's heartfelt message came in the wake of controversial statements made by former Indian leg-spinner Amit Mishra , who alleged that Kohli's aggressive nature has led to him having fewer friends and that it was Kohli who had instigated a rift with Afghanistan cricketer Naveen-ul-Haq during an IPL match between RCB and Lucknow Super Giants (LSG).In his Instagram post, Dayal shared a picture with Kohli, captioning it, ""It's an honour to stand beside you, bhaiya @virat.kohli.""Furthermore, Dayal shared the post on his Instagram story, using audio from Kohli's final game as RCB captain. In the background, Kohli can be heard saying, ""I have given my best. I don't know how the response has been, but I have given 120 percent to this franchise every time, which is something I will now do as a player.""In an appearance on YouTuber Shubhankar Mishra’s show ""Unplugged,"" Amit Mishra commented, “He (Kohli) started abusing our players (in the LSG vs RCB rematch in Lucknow). He didn’t have any grudges with Kyle Mayers, but he abused him as well. Naveen-ul-Haq was bowling, and he abused him too. A lot could have been avoided, but Kohli chose not to.""Mishra further added, “For social media, it all seemed to be over between them. But do you think Naveen will ever respect Kohli again? What about the youngsters who witnessed a big star abusing others?”Meanwhile, Kohli has been enjoying a well-deserved break after India's title-winning campaign in the 2024 T20 World Cup . Recently, he was attending a kirtan (musical chanting of the name of God) led by Krishna Das at Union Chapel in London, accompanied by his wife, Anushka Sharma .",Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) fast-bowler Yash Dayal took to social media to express his admiration and respect for Virat Kohli.

A lot of people have said countless times that sports should stay away from politics.

Pant highlighted how Dhoni’s wisdom and experience have been crucial to his development as a player.""Look, my relationship with him goes back a long way, starting from when he was my first international captain in Ireland,"" Rohit said.""He's been a tremendous role model for us all. We've seen what he's achieved both personally and for the team, often pulling us out of tough situations. His determination throughout his career was something I wanted to learn from when he came in as a coach. It has been incredibly beneficial, and besides the World Cup, we've won several major tournaments and series under his guidance,"" Rohit added.Pant echoed similar sentiments about Dhoni, saying, ""Not just on the field, but off the field as well, MS Dhoni is always there to support and guide me. He’s my go-to person whenever I’m unsure, and he encourages me to develop my own thought process.""Dravid's coaching era ended on a high note with India winning the T20 World Cup in Barbados, defeating South Africa to secure the title for the second time since 2007.Under Dravid’s leadership, India also dominated England in a five-match Test series at home and reached the final of the 2023 ODI World Cup.","Rohit Sharma and Rishabh Pant reflect on the key figures who have profoundly influenced their careers.

Following Sania’s divorce from former Pakistan cricketer Shoaib Malik , various social media speculations suggested that Shami and Mirza were about to tie the knot.In a recent YouTube interview with Shubhankar Mishra, Shami dismissed the rumours and criticized those spreading false information.“Ajeeb hi hai. Aur hai kya usme. Jabardasti ki khabar hai. Kuch nahi photo kholo to apna hi photo dikhta hai usme. Kya karenge aap. But mai ek hi cheez bolna chahunga kisi ko nahi khichna chaiye aisa. Mai maanta hun aapke mazaak ke liye memes honge wo lekin kisi ki life se related hote hain. [It’s quite strange. And what’s more, it’s all fabricated news. When you open the photo, it’s just your own photo that shows up. What can we do now? But I want to say that no one should drag others down like this. I understand there are memes made for humor, but they relate to someone’s life],” Shami said.“Aap Ko bade soch samajh ke wo memes banane chahiye. Dusre ki taang khichna ya dusre ko gaddhe mein dhakelna bada aasaan hai. Thoda success banke dikha. Thoda success achieve karke dikha. Thoda apne level ko upar karke dikhao. Thoda apni family ka saath pakad ke dikhao. Jitna uss badtameezi mein samajh mein aa raha hai na aapko ya taang khichne mein, utna kisi ki help karke dikhao na. Tab mai maanunga aap ache insaan ho. [You should create those memes responsibly. It’s easy to pull someone’s leg or push them into a pit. Show some success. Achieve something yourself. Elevate your own level a bit. Support your family. If you understand the rudeness of putting others down, then try helping someone instead. Only then will I believe you are a good person],” he added.Regarding the recent retirements of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli from T20I cricket, Shami expressed his surprise and acknowledged the challenge of filling their shoes.After India’s victory in the 2024 T20 World Cup, where they defeated South Africa by seven runs at Kensington Oval in Bridgetown, Kohli was named Player of the Match for his 76 off 59 balls and announced it was his final T20I. Kohli ended his T20I career as India’s second-highest run-scorer with 4,188 runs in 125 matches at an average of 48.69 and a strike rate of 137.04.Shortly after, Rohit Sharma also announced his retirement from T20Is, finishing as the format's highest run-scorer with 4,231 runs in 159 matches and holding the record for the most centuries in men’s T20Is.“The retirement of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli from T20Is was a shock. They have been stalwarts for India, delivering outstanding performances and earning their titles as kings of white-ball cricket. Their simultaneous retirement is surprising, but it’s part of the natural cycle—when one player leaves, another steps in. Replacing such stars will be a significant challenge,” Shami said.“Bidding farewell to a career after achieving your goals is an emotional moment. I would like to thank both Rohit and Virat for their contributions to the team, their incredible innings, and the records they set,” he added.",Mohammed Shami has finally addressed the swirling rumours about his supposed marriage to tennis star Sania Mirza.

Paris Olympics: Flavours of India in Saarbrucken senses,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/paris-olympics-flavours-of-india-in-saarbrucken-senses/articleshow/111913901.cms,"SAARBRUCKEN : Tell Dikshant Mehta that the cooking area of the cafeteria at the Sport Campus Saar here smells like an Indian kitchen and the 28-year-old chef from Himachal Pradesh immediately gets defensive. ""Kisney bola? Did anyone say anything!"" he asks, only assuaged when told that the smells remind one of home so far away.It is cheat day today for the Indian athletes in their final training here.Residing here for over a month for the Paris Olympics scheduled to begin in less than a week's time, the various Indian teams are departing for the French capital in batches, and Mehta, on deputation from SAI for this extended training camp, has decided to whip some Indian flavours as a farewell meal. For today, he severed ties with boxing team nutritionist, Mohit Dhariwal who would zealously oversee the carbs, the calorie count and the protein intake each time Mehta fired up the induction. And so, it's butter chicken and peeli daal for lunch today.""The rotis are on demand, mainly for the athletes only,"" says Mehta, explaining, ""The cooking here is done on induction and rotis take a long time, so we usually save it for the athletes.""The Indian table tennis that had trained here for over a fortnight left for Paris earlier on Sunday, led by Sharath Kamal - who along with PV Sindhu - will be India's flag bearer at the opening ceremony in Paris. The boxing team, camping here for a month, will leave for Paris on Monday, as will Sindhu - 'PV' in these parts.Apart from the gym in such sports centres, the cafeteria at the Sport Campus Saar gives one the feeling of how the general eating areas of Olympic villages can tend to be - the off-field, off-competition melting pots. At one point 401 athletes from 27 countries from across five continents were training for the Olympics at this sprawling nine-hectare facility. ""There are at least two dozen potential Olympic medals floating here at Saarbrucken,"" a boxing coach with the US team drawled as he watched his higher-weight boxers manhandle the heavy bags.Spending time here, rubbing shoulders with athletes of various disciplines - competitors turned sparring partners turned fellow philosophers and guides - can be an uplifting experience. It can also be a bit distracting, even a bit overwhelming for a first-timer, he felt.On Saturday, 'Anna' Sharath and 'PV' were having a leisurely post-lunch chat. You could overhear snatches of ""fitting,"" and ""trial"" and ""rehearsal"" and thus asked if they were discussing the opening ceremony and the flag bearing protocol. ""Right now, all we can only think of is 'serve and smash,' both said, almost in unison.Sunday afternoon, under overcast skies and pleasant breeze, saw much activity at the campus. Locals outnumbered the training athletes and crowds and cars lined from well outside the forest area surrounding it. Turns out the crowd was flocking in because home team Germany was playing Brazil for an international volleyball Test match and tickets had been sold out days in advance for the 1000-seater auditorium. Brazil were flying in just for the game, before returning to their training base in France.But the biggest draw for the organisers? 'PV' could also be in attendance since volleyball is like a family heirloom sport, with both her parents being international volleyball players, father Ramana, a fearsome spiker who helped India win the men's bronze at the 1986 Asian Games in Seoul. ""I have training, but I think I will put in a little appearance, after all, it's volleyball,"" Sindhu told TOI.","Dikshant Mehta, on deputation from SAI for this extended training camp, has decided to whip some Indian flavours as a farewell meal.

Who is Ryan ten Doeschate?

A man of character

NEW DELHI: The announcement of Gautam Gambhir as the new head coach of the Indian men's cricket team has brought a wave of excitement among fans and players alike.But the buzz doesn't stop there.Potentially joining Gambhir's team as assistant coaches are former India all-rounder Abhishek Nayar and former Dutch international Ryan ten Doeschate Although the BCCI has not yet officially confirmed these appointments, the cricketing world is already abuzz with anticipation.Gambhir's legacy as a leader is well-known. His tenure with the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) saw the team rise from mediocrity to championship glory, clinching two IPL titles under his captaincy. Now, as the head coach of Team India, Gambhir brings with him a wealth of experience and a reputation for revitalizing struggling teams.Gambhir's knack for leadership was on full display when he led KKR to the knockout stages in his first year as captain and subsequently to IPL victories in 2012 and 2014.Now as the mentor, he brought the glory days back to KKR this year, though not single-handedly.With Ryan ten Doeschate orchestrating from behind the scenes, Gambhir had a man for whom he could, in his own words, even take a bullet.In a media interaction, Gambhir referred to Ryan ten Doeschate as the ""greatest team man"" he has ever played with. He recounted an anecdote from 2011 when ten Doeschate, despite having a stellar 50-over World Cup, carried drinks without a hint of disappointment. This act of selflessness left an indelible mark on Gambhir, shaping his own leadership ethos.""When I talk about selflessness, I have never said this in 42 years of my career, and I wanted to say this. The greatest team man I have ever played with, the most selfless human being, someone I can take a bullet for, someone who I can trust for life, and I can tell you this because in 2011, for my first game as a KKR captain, we only had four overseas players available, and this man had a fabulous 50-over World Cup. We went in that game with only three overseas players, and he was carrying drinks in that game with no disappointment on his face. He taught me selflessness. Ryan ten Doeschate. These are the people who made me the leader,"" Gambhir previously said during a media interaction.Born on June 30, 1980, in Port Elizabeth, Cape Province, Ryan ten Doeschate is a former Netherlands international, who has had a cricketing journey nothing short of remarkable.Discovered by Essex during a pre-season tour of South Africa, Ryan ten Doeschate's all-round abilities for Western Province caught their eye. His EU citizenship qualified him to play county cricket, paving the way for his impressive career.Standing at 5 feet 11 inches, the right-handed batting all-rounder and right-arm fast-medium bowler left an indelible mark on every team he played for.His impressive stats speak volumes: an average of 67 in ODIs, with five centuries and nine fifties in just 33 matches, and a strike rate of 132.92 in T20Is.In his IPL career, the part-time medium-pacer played 29 matches and took 2 wickets with a best bowling figure of 1/24 while maintaining an economy rate of 7.23.When it comes to his batting numbers, Ryan ten Doeschate scored 326 runs at an average of 23.29, with a highest score of 70* across 29 IPL matches.Ten Doeschate's talent took him across the globe, playing for clubs and franchise teams in the Netherlands, England, Australia, New Zealand, Bangladesh, Hong Kong, and Pakistan.In September 2021, Ryan ten Doeschate bid farewell to his illustrious cricketing career, announcing his retirement by year's end. His swan song came on October 20, 2021, in a final international match against Namibia during the group stage of the 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup.However, his association with the Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL further cemented his reputation as a versatile and reliable player.What sets ten Doeschate apart is not just his statistics but his character. Known for his humility and dedication, he has often been described as the best associate player among non-Test-playing nations.His performances in the 2011 ICC World Cup, particularly his career-best 119 against England, showcased his ability to shine on the biggest stage.Yet, despite his individual brilliance, ten Doeschate remains a quintessential team player, always prioritizing the collective over personal glory.As ten Doeschate looks set to join Gambhir and Nayar in the Indian coaching setup, the anticipation for the upcoming tour of Sri Lanka is palpable.With Gambhir's strategic acumen, Nayar's all-around expertise, and ten Doeschate's selfless spirit, Team India is poised to benefit from a diverse and experience-rich coaching team.","Former India all-rounder Abhishek Nayar and former Dutch international Ryan ten Doeschate could join Gautam Gambhir as assistant coaches.

This makes him India’s leading wicket-taker in the ICC event and places him fifth overall globally.Reflecting on the 2019 World Cup, Shami recounted, ""In 2019 I did not play the first 4-5 games. In the next game, I took a hat-trick, then picked up a five-wicket haul and then four wickets in the next game. A similar thing happened in 2023. I did not play in the first few games and then picked a fifer, then four wickets and then a five-wicket haul again.""In the 2023 World Cup, Shami emerged as the highest wicket-taker with 24 scalps in seven games. He was only included in the playing XI after all-rounderHardik Pandya was ruled out due to injury.""The one thing I keep wondering is every team needs players who can perform well,"" Shami remarked.

What more do you expect from me?""During the 2019 edition, despite taking 14 wickets in fours matches, he was benched for the final league match against Sri Lanka and the semi-final against New Zealand, which India lost by 18 runs.Shami's bewilderment was palpable as he continued, ""I neither have questions nor do I have answers. I can only prove myself when I get the opportunity. You gave me a chance, and I took 13 wickets in three matches. Then we lost to New Zealand. Played four matches overall and picked 14 wickets. In 2023, I picked 24 wickets in seven matches.""In the 2019 World Cup, Shami was playing under the captaincy of Virat Kohli , with Ravi Shastri serving as the head coach.Shami's consistent performance when given the opportunity underscores the importance of utilizing players to their full potential, especially in critical tournaments like the World Cup.","Mohammed Shami expressed his confusion over team management's decisions to bench him during crucial stages of the tournaments.

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali has strongly criticized Indian fast bowler Mohammed Shami for his ' cartoon-giri ' comments about Inzamam-ul-Haq ’s reverse swing allegations.Ali, speaking on his YouTube channel, expressed his disapproval of Shami's choice of words, describing them as 'behuda' (indecent) and disrespectful.""When Shami talks about Inzi bhai and calls him a cartoon, that's not right.Inzamam has led this country and captained it.

He emphasized the need for respect towards senior players, asserting, “Be a bit more careful, you can't just say anything anywhere.

The comment sparked Shami’s reaction, which Ali feels undermines the dignity of cricketing discourse.""Arshdeep Singh, when he was bowling the 15th over, the ball was reversing. Is it too early (for reverse swing) with the new ball? This means the ball was ready for reverse swing by the 12th or the 13th over. Umpires should keep their eyes open (to spot) these things...If it was Pakistani bowlers (reverse swinging the ball) this would have been a big issue. We know reverse swing very well and if Arshdeep can come in the 15th over and start reversing the ball, it means some serious work had been done before,"" Inzamam told a Pakistani news channel.","Former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali has strongly criticized Indian fast bowler Mohammed Shami for his'cartoon-giri'comments about Inzamam-ul-Haq.

ODI Squad for Sri Lanka series

NEW DELHI: Former Team India batting coach Sanjay Bangar feels a 'little injustice' has been done to Hardik Pandya following Suryakumar Yadav 's appointment as captain of T20I side for the upcoming white-ball tour to Sri Lanka.Despite Hardik's commendable leadership and strong performances, Suryakumar, earlier this week was named T20I captain while Shubman Gill was appointed as vice-captain for both the T20I and ODI squads.In a discussion on Star Sports, Bangar highlighted Suryakumar’s experience in leadership within domestic cricket but expressed that an injustice had been served to Hardik.""It is not that Suryakumar Yadav has played less domestic cricket before playing international cricket. So he has a lot of experience, I think he has led Mumbai in domestic cricket as well and knows how to extract the best from the players,"" Bangar said.""So there is nothing wrong in Suryakumar being made the captain. I fully believe that he will do a good job but I still feel a little injustice has been meted out to Hardik,"" added the former Indian all-rounder.Bangar expressed his surprise at Hardik not being the captain, because to him, it seemed like had Rohit not been the captain for a series against Afghanistan earlier this year when Hardik was injured, the all-rounder would have continued as a captain anyways.""I am a bit surprised as far as Hardik not being the captain of the T20 team is concerned because even before the previous T20 World Cup it seemed like if Rohit had not become the captain and Hardik had not gotten injured at that time, Hardik only would have become the captain,"" said Bangar.Hardik previously captained the T20I side post the ICC T20 World Cup 2022 and during his tenure he led India in 16 T20I matches, winning 10, losing five, and drawing one.Pandya's removal comes despite his stellar performance in the recently concluded T20 World Cup, where he scored 144 runs in six innings at an average of 48.00 and a strike rate of 151.57, along with taking 11 wickets in eight games at an average of 17.36 and an economy rate of 7.64.Suryakumar Yadav, on the other hand, has captained India in two series following the 50-over World Cup 2023 final loss to Australia.He led India in seven matches, securing five wins and two losses. He successfully led India to a series win against Australia, and the series against South Africa ended in a draw.India's tour to Sri Lanka will kick off from July 27 with a three-match T20 series followed by a three-match ODI series starting August 2.Both teams will be taking to the field with new head coaches.
