NEW DELHI: India‚Äôs pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah remains a doubtful starter for the fourth Test against England at Old Trafford, scheduled to begin on July 23 in Manchester. With India trailing 1-2 in the ongoing Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy series, Bumrah‚Äôs availability is seen as crucial‚Äîespecially in light of the pre-series plan that he would feature in only three of the five matches.Having already played the first and third Tests at Leeds and Lord‚Äôs, the Indian team management now faces the decision of whether to field him in the fourth or save him for the series finale.Veteran Indian cricketer Ajinkya Rahane has suggested that left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh should step in if Bumrah is rested.""If Bumrah is not playing, Arshdeep is the guy. Because in England, you need a left-arm seamer who can swing the ball both ways, and also, with a different angle, he can create that rough for the spinners. So, if Bumrah doesn't play, Arshdeep should play the next one,"" Rahane said on his YouTube channel.Rahane also weighed in on the team‚Äôs spin options, specifically Kuldeep Yadav.""Depending on the condition of the wicket, I feel Kuldeep should play. If the wicket is similar to the last three Test matches, Kuldeep should play because you need guys who can get you those wickets. Our batting unit is doing really well. Even if you score 25-30 runs less, that's okay.But you need people who can get you those wickets. You don't want to depend on your leading fast bowlers every time.""Arshdeep, who has picked up 99 wickets in 63 T20Is, is still awaiting his Test debut. However, his participation in Manchester has been thrown into doubt due to an injury suffered during a practice session.The pacer sustained a cut when he was hit by a ball while training, prompting medical attention.""He took a ball while he was bowling there. So he hit a ball, and he tried to stop it and it's just a cut. So we have to see how bad the cut is. Obviously, the medical team have taken him off to see a doctor and obviously, if he needs stitches or does he not, that will be important to our planning for the next few days.""With just two matches left in the series, India must win both to clinch a comeback series victory.",Jasprit Bumrah remains a doubtful starter for the fourth Test against England at Old Trafford.

My Verdict on Marcus Smart Joining the Los Angeles Lakers

Thehave made a calculated offseason splash, signing Marcus Smart to a two-year, $11 million deal following his buyout with the Washington Wizards . The move, confirmed in July 2025, adds a seasoned defensive presence to a team in need of grit and backcourt toughness. While some fans celebrate the addition of a proven veteran, others raise questions about injuries and long-term viability.Here‚Äôs a breakdown of everything surrounding the deal‚Äîfrom what led to the signing to how it reshapes the Lakers‚Äô championship aspirations.Marcus Smart had been circulating in trade talks throughout the offseason, with the Los Angeles Lakers often mentioned as a potential destination. With a pressing need for perimeter defense‚Äîespecially after struggling to contain top guards in the playoffs‚ÄîLos Angeles appeared ready to offer a trade package featuring players like Gabe Vincent, Jarred Vanderbilt, and future draft picks. However, Smart‚Äôs declining trade value, due to injury history and a hefty salary, pushed Washington and Smart toward a buyout agreement.Once the buyout was finalized, the Lakers moved quickly. Though the Milwaukee Bucks were also in the hunt, aggressive recruiting from Luka Doncic and the Lakers‚Äô clear defensive need helped seal the deal.The modest salary and flexible terms make this a low-risk contract, especially when compared to what the Lakers might have given up in a trade.- Elite Perimeter Defense: A former Defensive Player of the Year and three-time All-Defensive Team selection, Smart is one of the league‚Äôs toughest defenders. He offers a skill set no current Laker can replicate.- Championship Experience: With deep playoff experience and a proven leadership presence, Smart adds another veteran voice next to LeBron James and Luka Doncic.- Locker Room Culture: Known for his vocal leadership and on-court toughness, Smart contributes to a winning mentality‚Äîsomething LA hopes to reinforce during its title chase.- Versatility & Toughness: His physicality and willingness to do the dirty work align perfectly with the Lakers‚Äô need for playoff-caliber grit.- Value Signing: Signing Smart after a buyout instead of trading for him allowed the Lakers to conserve key assets while still upgrading their defense.While the upside is evident, the move does not come without baggage.- Injury History: Smart has played just 54 games over the past two seasons, a worrying trend that could limit his postseason impact.- Offensive Limitations: A career 32.3% shooter from beyond the arc, Smart doesn‚Äôt fix the Lakers‚Äô floor-spacing issues. The team already ranks near the bottom in both attempts and efficiency from three.- Age Factor: At 31, Smart‚Äôs prime years may be behind him. Expecting him to maintain elite-level performance‚Äîespecially defensively‚Äîcould be ambitious.- Role Burden: With few other reliable defenders on the roster, LA risks overusing Smart, potentially increasing his chances of re-injury.- Optimism: Many Lakers fans welcomed Smart with open arms, calling him a ‚Äúculture-changer‚Äù and praising his playoff pedigree. Clips of Smart‚Äôs best defensive plays trended across platforms shortly after the signing.- Cautious Hope: Others remained skeptical due to his injuries and age, drawing comparisons to previous signings of aging veterans who failed to deliver in the playoffs.- Some analysts commended the Lakers for finding a solution to their biggest weakness without giving up key assets. ‚ÄúThe Lakers addressed their most urgent need‚Äîdefensive toughness on the perimeter‚Äîwhile keeping their core intact,‚Äù noted original article writer in a succinct assessment.- However, critics emphasized Smart‚Äôs offensive shortcomings and injury risk. Without better shooting or backup options, the Lakers could be left exposed if Smart misses extended time.One subplot that drew attention was Luka Doncic‚Äôs active role in recruiting Smart. It signaled a shift in the Lakers‚Äô approach‚Äîfocusing on chemistry and toughness as much as star power. That alone, according to many national pundits, made this move one of the more compelling of the offseason.Marcus Smart‚Äôs arrival in Los Angeles Lakers is a strategic roll of the dice. The Lakers didn‚Äôt surrender valuable assets, and in return, they got a former Defensive Player of the Year with a chip on his shoulder. If Smart can stay healthy and accept a focused role, he could be a playoff x-factor.But if the injuries persist or his offensive liabilities hurt spacing, the Lakers may find themselves in the same position they were last spring‚Äîshort on answers when it matters most.Also read: Bill Simmons Loses It in 6-Word Reaction as Celtics Icon Marcus Smart Signs Two-Year Deal with the Los Angeles Lakers In a summer of few big moves, this signing stands out not for its price tag, but for its potential to change the Lakers‚Äô identity on both ends of the floor.","The Los Angeles Lakers signed Marcus Smart to a two-year, $11 million deal.

NHL Trade Rumor: Could Connor McDavid ditch Oilers for Leafs?

Connor McDavid‚Äôs uncertain future triggers wild speculation



Could the Maple Leafs pull off the ultimate power move?



FAQs



Is Connor McDavid a free agent now?

No, McDavid is under contract with the Oilers until the end of the 2025‚Äì26 NHL season.



Has McDavid started contract extension talks with the Oilers?

No, according to Chris Johnston, there have been no discussions about an extension yet.



Why are the Maple Leafs linked to Connor McDavid?

With Toronto's roster changes and McDavid‚Äôs Toronto roots, many believe the Leafs could make a serious push if he becomes available.



The NHL world is buzzing with speculation as Connor McDavid edges closer to the final stretch of his contract with the Edmonton Oilers. With no current negotiations in place for an extension, as confirmed by NHL insider Chris Johnston, questions are being raised about McDavid‚Äôs future, especially with the Toronto Maple Leafs circling as a potential landing spot. Could the most electrifying player in hockey reunite with his hometown roots?Connor McDavid isn‚Äôt a free agent yet. But the clock is ticking. His current deal with the Oilers runs through the end of the 2025‚Äì26 season, and in NHL terms, that‚Äôs not far off. By this point, most superstars would have already begun discussions on what could be a career-defining contract. But not McDavid. ‚ÄúThere have been no discussions yet about an extension,‚Äù reported Johnston, a statement that has ignited serious chatter across the league.This silence from both camps has left fans in Edmonton nervous. After all, McDavid‚Äôs next contract is expected to be the most significant in NHL history‚Äîboth in financial scope and franchise implications. If the Oilers fail to deliver a strong campaign next season, it could push the generational talent to explore new horizons. And there‚Äôs one destination that keeps surfacing: Toronto.Toronto Maple Leafs general manager Brad Treliving is in the middle of a massive roster shakeup.With Mitch Marner shipped off to the Vegas Golden Knights, the Leafs have created both cap flexibility and a sense of urgency to bring in a true game-changer. McDavid, a Toronto native, could be that missing piece.Treliving has already begun reinvesting wisely‚Äîsigning Matias Maccelli, Dakota Joshua, Nicolas Roy, and Michael Pezzetta with funds freed from Marner‚Äôs exit. The groundwork is being laid, and the timing aligns eerily well.Add the emotional weight of McDavid having grown up in the Greater Toronto Area, and suddenly the speculation feels more like a potential script.

Terry Bradshaw firing his uncle could be the toughest call of his life

FAQs:

Why did Terry Bradshaw fire his own uncle?

How many people has Terry Bradshaw fired in his career?

What is Terry Bradshaw‚Äôs leadership philosophy?

Why Bradshaw‚Äôs leadership still resonates



NFL legend Terry Bradshaw is no stranger to pressure. From four Super Bowl rings to national TV fame, he‚Äôs lived in the spotlight for decades. But his toughest call didn‚Äôt happen on the football field, it happened in his personal life. And it proved that for Bradshaw, principles always outweigh popularity, even when family‚Äôs involved.On the To The Point ‚Äì Home Services Podcast, Bradshaw gave fans a rare look into the leadership style that‚Äôs shaped both his NFL legacy and his post-football ventures, especially Bradshaw Quarter Horses, his thriving horse breeding business. Bradshaw‚Äôs honest, results-first approach is earning respect from the team leadership. When asked how he handles high performers who resist structure, Bradshaw didn‚Äôt sugarcoat it: ‚ÄúIf I have to tell you more than twice to do something, you‚Äôre gone. ‚ÄùHe credits former Cowboys coach Jimmy Johnson for his ‚Äúresults over process‚Äù mindset. If you‚Äôre a superstar and delivering, you get more leeway. But once character fails, no amount of talent can save your seat. That approach led Bradshaw to fire only three people in his entire career‚Äîone for stealing, one for toxicity, and one that shook him to the core: his own uncle.In perhaps his most jarring admission, Bradshaw revealed that his very first firing wasn‚Äôt a teammate or employee‚Äîit was a close family member. ‚ÄúMy uncle. I fired my uncle. That was actually my first fire.‚Äù The decision highlighted the uncomfortable truth every leader eventually faces: when loyalty and values collide, only one can win.Bradshaw didn‚Äôt elaborate on the exact reasons, but his takeaway was clear‚Äîno exceptions, no free passes. In his eyes, integrity must come first. His wife Tammy Bradshaw now handles most staffing issues, but the family‚Äôs philosophy remains grounded in one non-negotiable rule: character is king.Terry Bradshaw didn‚Äôt reveal specific details, but he emphasized that character and values take precedence over personal relationships in business decisions, even when it comes to family.Bradshaw revealed he has only fired three people: his uncle, a long-time employee who was stealing, and a toxic coworker who mistreated others.Bradshaw believes in results-driven leadership, inspired by coach Jimmy Johnson. However, he draws a hard line at poor character, regardless of talent or tenure.Terry Bradshaw‚Äôs story is a masterclass in leadership, integrity, and unshakable standards. In an age where talent often excuses bad behavior, Bradshaw stands firm: ‚ÄúIf they are not a good person, I don‚Äôt care how much money they‚Äôre making. I can‚Äôt handle that.‚ÄùAlso Read: Tyreek Hill leads Dolphins‚Äô 2025 push as Mike McDaniel lands on hot seat From NFL dominance to horse ranching success, Bradshaw proves that no matter the arena, values build lasting legacies.

Tyreek Hill, however, isn‚Äôt dwelling on the past. Instead, he‚Äôs zeroed in on proving he‚Äôs still one of the league‚Äôs elite receivers. Tyreek Hill remains the Dolphins‚Äô biggest weapon in 2025 as Miami looks to bounce back after major roster changes.‚ÄúEvery day I‚Äôm trying to prove myself as one of those guys this team can depend on in crucial moments,‚Äù Hill said. His words come at a time when Miami‚Äôs locker room needs strong leadership more than ever.Hill‚Äôs performance will be key for an offense that must now lean even more on his explosiveness.

Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal threatens Robert Griffin III with a punch over Angel Reese controversy

Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal attempted to defend Angel Reese with a punch, but Dan Dakich wasn‚Äôt having any of it. The OutKick host went off on the NBA legend with insults, labeling him a ""fat a**"" and ""big stupid"" while supporting Robert Griffin III. It all kicked off with a racist meme, but now it‚Äôs turned into a nasty feud packed with personal digs, old receipts, and social media drama you can‚Äôt overlook.Dan Dakich, once a college basketball coach and now a candid sportscaster for Outkick, a platform celebrated for its fearless takes. He posted an intense rant on Outkick‚Äôs Instagram, aligning with Griffin and tearing into O‚ÄôNeal with a slew of insults, particularly calling him a ""fat a**."" He later added, ‚ÄúI mean, go back and look at shaq's history. Restraining orders, all kind of other stupid. So yes, it's shack, it's the big stupid I really wish. Rg 3 would say.

While on the Off The Record podcast, O‚ÄôNeal made a bold threat towards Griffin. ‚ÄúRG3, tweet one more monkey post about my girl Angel Reese, and I‚Äôm punching you in the f**king face,‚Äù he said at the 23:49 mark of the episode.‚ÄúEnough‚Äôs enough.

TOI Sports reporter attacked in London: After Lord's Test, reporter faces 'scariest moment of his life'

Former Australian spinner Brad Hogg has offered a spirited defence of slow over-rates in Test cricket, calling them a mark of ""quality cricket"" when matched by intensity and character on the field. Hogg's comments come in the wake of England being penalised two ICC World Test Championship points for falling short of the over-rate requirement during their thrilling 22-run victory over India in the third Test at Lord's.Speaking on his YouTube channel, Hogg said that slow over-rates are justifiable if the match maintains drama and intent. ‚ÄúWhen things are not going as fast, the slow over-rates there, it is okay as long as there is tension in the game. We want that tension. We want the players' character showing,‚Äù he said.He added pointedly, ‚ÄúAs long as it has got the tension, slow over-rate is good - because that is quality cricket.‚ÄùHogg, who played 145 matches for Australia, argued that in English conditions, conserving bowler energy is strategic, especially when the ball softens. ‚ÄúIt is a bit of cat and mouse... when the batters are in control, bowlers wait for that defensive moment to strike back and rush them.That's where the game ebbs and flows,‚Äù he noted.Reflecting on India's defeat at Lord's, Hogg pointed to one pivotal moment. ‚ÄúIndia lost that match because of one moment. Pant getting run out trying to get Rahul on strike for his hundred, and then Rahul gets out after celebrating. Two wickets in ten balls after a 140-run stand. That was the turning point.‚ÄùThe five-match series now stands at 2-1 in England's favour, with the fourth Test in Manchester beginning July 23.",Former Australian spinner Brad Hogg defends slow over-rates in Test cricket.

Bradley Beal‚Äôs Silent Farewell Goes Viral

Two Years of Missed Opportunities

Moving On: Clippers, Cap Space, and a Clean Slate

Why the NBA Couldn‚Äôt Stop Laughing

Closing Thoughts: A Superteam That Never Was

Whenjoined the Phoenix Suns in 2023, expectations soared. Fans and analysts imagined a Western Conference powerhouse built around Beal, Kevin Durant , and Devin Booker. But two years later, following a string of injuries and unmet expectations, Beal‚Äôs silent departure from Phoenix‚Äîwith nothing more than a peace sign emoji on Instagram‚Äîset off a storm of amused and bewildered reactions across the NBA landscape.No farewell statement. No highlights. Just a single ‚Äú‚úåÔ∏è‚Äù emoji. That was the extent of Bradley Beal‚Äôs goodbye to the Suns, and it was enough to send social media into a frenzy. The NBA community, especially his fellow players, responded with a mix of laughter, sarcasm, and understanding:- Kevin Durant, now with the Houston Rockets, replied with a simple ‚ÄúüòÇ‚Äù.- Bam Adebayo followed suit with the same laughing emoji.- Trae Young joked: ‚ÄúNot the deuces ‚úåÔ∏èüòÇ‚Äù- Tyus Jones added: ‚ÄúAye man ü§£ü§£‚Äù- Andre Drummond summed up the sentiment with: ‚ÄúLmaooo your sick‚ÄùThe minimalism struck a chord‚Äîone emoji carried more weight than any formal statement. Bradley Beal ‚Äôs time in Phoenix never lived up to the hype. Hampered by injuries, he averaged just over 50 games per season. Despite the combined star power of Beal, Durant, and Booker, the Suns failed to win a single playoff game during Beal‚Äôs tenure.Their 2025 campaign ended in a first-round sweep, followed by an outright playoff miss.Statistically, Bradley Beal produced solid numbers‚Äîaround 17 points per game on efficient shooting‚Äîbut critics argued his performances lacked meaningful impact. The much-hyped trio couldn‚Äôt generate consistent offense together, and the chemistry never materialized on the court.Following a mutual buyout, Beal is now set to join the Los Angeles Clippers , giving him a fresh opportunity to reestablish himself in a new system. He also reportedly gave up $14 million in the process. Meanwhile, Phoenix clears significant salary cap space and pivots toward building around Devin Booker.Yet, for many, it‚Äôs not Beal‚Äôs next step that‚Äôs memorable‚Äîit‚Äôs how he exited. That single emoji symbolized the disbanding of what was once envisioned as the NBA‚Äôs next great superteam.The responses from Durant, Adebayo, and others weren‚Äôt just jokes‚Äîthey reflected the deeper culture of the league:- A sense of fraternity: NBA players often poke fun at one another in ways only insiders understand.- Shared frustration: Many stars, including Durant, had experienced the same disappointing ride in Phoenix.- An unspoken message: Beal‚Äôs peace sign may have said more than words could‚Äîabout the chaos, the exit, and maybe even relief.Bradley Beal‚Äôs exit from Phoenix won‚Äôt be remembered for a teary tribute or a media circus. It will be remembered for its quiet finality and the wave of reactions it triggered. His time in the desert will likely go down as one of the NBA‚Äôs biggest ‚Äúwhat-ifs‚Äù‚Äîbut at least, in true NBA fashion, it left the league entertained.Also read: Joel Embiid Addresses Leadership Criticism in the Highly Demanding NBA League: ""You Can‚Äôt Expect Me to Be Part of That Again"" Now headed to the Clippers, Bradley Beal turns the page.

Poll Which player's strategy impressed you the most in their opening game? Koneru Humpy Lei Tingjie Divya Deshmukh Vaishali Rameshbabu

India No. 1 Koneru Humpy and China‚Äôs top-seeded Grandmaster Lei Tingjie won their respective opening games to take the lead in the quarterfinals of the FIDE Women‚Äôs Chess World Cup in Batumi, Georgia, on Saturday.While Humpy and Tingjie registered victories in contrasting fashion, the battle of Indian compatriots between Divya Deshmukh and Harika D was the most peaceful game in the last eight stage of the seven-round tournament, from where the top three finishers will qualify for the Women‚Äôs Candidates.Vaishali Rameshbabu continued to play lengthy games and got success in holding China‚Äôs World No. 8 Tan Zhongyi in a marathon 72-move contest. A day after both Divya and Harika played some exhausting tiebreak games, both the India No .2 and No. 4 tried no tricks on the board in their opening classical format clash to sign the peace treaty in just 31 moves. Though Divya missed a chance to utilise her opening advantage with white pieces, it will br advantage Harika in the second game on Sunday as she would look to make an impact with some fine opening preparations.Divya chose the Ruy Lopez Opening, while Harika opted for the Morphy Defense.Both players didn‚Äôt make any notable moves, the game remaining equal from the start. The three-pawn rook endgame with Divya‚Äôs knight and Harika‚Äôs bishop concluded without any drama. On Sunday, Divya will need to defend with black pieces, with Harika having a slight edge. Harika said, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to let Divya get something from the opening. I just tried to go with the flow. Of course, I prepared, but nothing came forward.‚ÄùIndia‚Äôs most experienced GM and world No. 5 Humpy utilised her opening advantage with white pieces well to get the better of China‚Äôs 19year-old IM Yuxin Song in an entertaining 53-move English Opening game. The Chinese youngster surprised Humpy in the midgame with some notable moves on the 11th and 16th turns. Humpy remained composed throughout and made the most of Song‚Äôs 18th move blunder of castling on the wrong side to take a slight edge. On the 22nd turn, Humpy went a rook up but had to sacrifice the same on the next move following Song‚Äôs likely attack with her bishop and queen. By the next 10 moves, Humpy took control of the proceedings by going two pawns up, utilising her knight. After the exchange of queens in the 36th move, Humpy enjoyed an upper hand with a knight, rook and two extra pawns, while Song had a rook and bishop. When Humpy started advancing her pawns with a well-positioned rook, Song resigned on the 53rd move.Earlier, China‚Äôs top seed Lei Tingjie outclassed Georgia‚Äôs Nana Dzagnidze in an English Opening game in 40 moves to join Humpy in the lead.

Poll Should Jasprit Bumrah play in the fourth Test against England? Yes, he is crucial for the team Only if he is fully fit Let the medical team decide

Exclusive | First look of the Old Trafford pitch

NEW DELHI: With the Test series between India and England delicately poised at 2-1 in favour of the hosts, all eyes are on whether pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah will be in the XI for the fourth Test at Old Trafford, Manchester. Former India cricketer Suresh Raina weighed in on the burning question, hailing Bumrah as a ""legend"" while stressing that the final decision rests with the medical team.Speaking to ANI during the World Championship of Legends in Birmingham, Raina said, ‚ÄúI think it is a doctor's call, to be very honest. I know my body. I know my doctor. I know what guidelines he is giving me, how to play the game. With Bumrah, he is a legend. He knows his body. He knows his workload.‚ÄùBumrah, who has taken 12 wickets in two Tests in the series ‚Äî including a five-wicket haul at Lord's ‚Äî was rested for the second Test as part of workload management. His inclusion could be pivotal in India's bid to level the series.‚ÄúA little rest is important for Bumrah, especially after returning from such a long injury,‚Äù Raina added. ‚ÄúBut if they want to win or draw the series, then both Bumrah and [Rishabh] Pant will be key in the fourth Test.‚ÄùPant, India's second-highest run-scorer in the series with 425 runs at an average of 70.83, suffered a finger injury at Lord's but continued to bat.

FAQs

1. What college did Landon Jackson play for?

2. What is the height and weight of Landon Jackson?

3. What round was Landon Jackson drafted in?

The Buffalo Bills‚Äô third-round draft pick Landon Jackson has officially shut down doubts about his health status ahead of training camp. Days after being placed on the active/Physically Unable to Perform (PUP) list due to an undisclosed injury, Jackson made a high-energy appearance at MafiaCon 2025 and confirmed what fans and coaches were hoping to hear ‚Äî he‚Äôs ready. The rookie defensive end, expected to be a key part of Buffalo‚Äôs defensive front, is now set to fully participate when camp opens at St. John Fisher.The Bills raised eyebrows on July 15 by placing Jackson on the PUP list before camp began, sparking speculation about a potential lingering offseason issue. With no official details released, fans and analysts questioned whether the 6-foot-6, 264-pound edge rusher would miss valuable early reps. But just days later, while speaking to Trainwreck Sports at MafiaCon, Jackson confirmed that he's healthy and set to go. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm ready to get going‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm gonna be fully good to go for camp. So I am really excited about it.‚ÄùFor Head Coach Sean McDermott and Defensive Coordinator Bobby Babich, it‚Äôs a major relief. Jackson was one of the most athletic edge prospects in the 2025 NFL Draft ‚Äî recording a 4.68-second 40-yard dash and a 40.5-inch vertical jump ‚Äî both elite for his position.Buffalo invested $6.62 million in his rookie deal, including $1.45 million guaranteed, with hopes that he‚Äôd contribute immediately.While MafiaCon is known for fanfare and beer-fueled table dives, this year‚Äôs event doubled as a news break. Jackson, appearing comfortable and confident, mingled with fans, soaked in the Bills Mafia energy, and casually delivered the camp update that had social media buzzing. ‚ÄúReally enjoyed‚Ä¶ you know getting to meet all the Bills Mafia, interacting with the fans‚Ä¶ it has been great. I‚Äôve really enjoyed it ‚Äî a great community. ‚ÄùThe public appearance also gave Jackson a chance to display his personality ‚Äî something that doesn‚Äôt always show on tape. With a calm yet assured demeanor, he handled questions about his body and readiness with maturity well beyond his years, matching the high-character profile Buffalo‚Äôs staff praised on draft night.Beyond the athletic numbers, Buffalo believes they drafted a long-term defensive piece. W ith 16 career sacks and close to 28 tackles for loss in college, Jackson‚Äôs productivity mirrors his potential. Babich previously highlighted his ‚Äúthree-down upside‚Äù and mental sharpness.

Ryan ten Doeschate press conference: Updates on Jasprit Bumrah, Rishabh Pant and Arshdeep Singh

Akash Deep struggling with back niggle

It seemed like a picnic environment when the Indian cricket team went to the Kent county ground for a practice session last Thursday. Music played in the dressing room and the players were largely left on their own to decide how they wanted to use the three hours at the ground. ‚ÄòBurnout‚Äô was the last thing on the team management‚Äôs mind. Mohammed Siraj , however, looked restless and had his ‚Äògame face‚Äô on at all times. Having just played three gruelling Tests, he was restricted from bowling in the nets. But he did pad up and had a longish session with the bat even as Jasprit Bumrah and Akash Deep had light sessions in the gym.While the talk about India‚Äôs pace attack has largely revolved around Bumrah‚Äôs workload, Siraj has now become the most important pacer for India on this tour. Suddenly, the team management has to think about ways of preserving him in order to ensure Siraj is at his best in the next two Tests.‚ÄúSiraj is not someone who‚Äôs going to shy away from the workload, so it makes it even more important for us to manage his workload and make sure that he‚Äôs at least fit to give his best,‚Äù India‚Äôs assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate had said after the session.India‚Äôs bowling coach Morne Morkel had earlier said that they have to literally take the ball out of Siraj‚Äôs hands in practice sessions.Curbing Siraj‚Äôs enthusiasm was the greatest challenge for coaches both at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) and in the Team India setup during the fast bowler‚Äôs initial years.There was an underlying concern over Siraj‚Äôs form when the team for the England tour was picked. His poor returns on lively pitches in Australia seven months ago had raised alarm bells about India‚Äôs pace resources, especially with Mohammed Shami slowly fading away due to fitness issues. That Siraj was still bowling like a third seamer was a big concern for the team management and selectors.In England, however, Siraj has looked like a bowler who has put in a lot of thought into his preparation, besides being all heart. Former Team India strength and condition coach Soham Desai told TOI that Siraj had asked him to devise a workout programme even before the Australia tour since he wanted to go on pilgrimage to Mecca. Siraj went for the pilgrimage just before the Champions Trophy.‚ÄúSiraj was very deflated after the Australia tour and after being dropped from the Champions Trophy squad. He came to India and bowled with all his heart in a Ranji Trophy match. It is always difficult to explain to him that he doesn‚Äôt have to burn himself out. But even before we travelled to Australia, we discussed how many days he will be off training and designed a workout programme accordingly,‚Äù Desai said.Former India pacer Amit Bhandari, who is an assistant coach at Gujarat Titans, noticed that Siraj had been talking a lot about bowling with his fellow pacers like Prasidh Krishna and didn‚Äôt only focus on bowling T20 lengths and variations during the IPL.‚ÄúHe bowled long spells at nets. While he had to focus on the variations for the IPL, he generally bowled Test match lengths. Siraj and Prasidh were inseparable. They sat together in team buses and had all their meals together. He was super focused on talking about bowling in general even with head coach Ashish Nehra,‚Äù Bhandari said.Before the tour started, former India bowling coach Bharat Arun, who has been instrumental in discovering Siraj at Hyderabad in 2016, had told TOI that this England tour was an opportunity for Siraj to put his hand up and prove he could be the frontline bowler for India.‚ÄúWhat kind of mindset he has is going to be vital. He‚Äôs pretty smart. Siraj is someone who can be a captain‚Äôs delight, someone who will give his all. It‚Äôs good to be aggressive, but controlling it is going to be key,‚Äù Arun had said.Having turned 31 four months ago, Siraj‚Äôs approach in the field suggests he is growing into the role of a senior bowler. He has not let his emotions get the better of him. Interestingly, his bowling average comes down to 23 from his career average 31 when Bumrah isn‚Äôt playing.Akash Deep had credited Siraj for his 10-wicket haul in the second Test, which India won in Bumrah‚Äôs absence at Edgbaston. ‚ÄúSiraj bhai keeps talking to me during the game. We discuss what‚Äôs happening from each end and how we can plot a batsman‚Äôs dismissal,‚Äù Akash Deep had said during the second Test.‚ÄúI think we take for granted how lucky we are to have someone like Siraj. I know he doesn‚Äôt always have the returns that you expect from a fast bowler. But in terms of heart, he‚Äôs like a lion and whenever he has the ball in hand, you always feel like something‚Äôs going to happen,‚Äù ten Doeschate had said on Thursday.In England, Siraj has brought all his experience into play. It has been a long road for the caretakers of Indian cricket to prepare Siraj for the day when he can confidently lead an attack.In 2017, Siraj was here in England with the India ‚ÄòA‚Äô team followed by a tour of New Zealand four months later. At that time, then-India ‚ÄòA‚Äô bowling coach Paras Mhambrey had devised a bowlingagainst-the-wind plan. The sole objective was to keep players outside their comfort zones while in the field.Abhay Sharma, who was the fielding coach with the India ‚ÄòA‚Äô team, had once told TOI, ‚ÄúWhen you first make it to the highest level, there will be senior bowlers in the team. Senior bowlers get the option to choose the ends. Siraj learnt how to bowl against the wind and to manage the workload while bowling against the wind all day.‚ÄùAt Edgbaston, where he picked up 6/70 in the first innings on a placid pitch, Siraj stopped in his runup quite a few times. He didn‚Äôt lose the run-up. He actually chose to bowl into the blustery wind to give Akash Deep easier conditions to bowl.With two matches remaining in the series, India will hope for Siraj to keep growing as a lead pacer irrespective of Bumrah‚Äôs presence in the XI.Heavy rain greeted the Indian team when they arrived here in Manchester on Saturday. Trailing 1-2 in the series, the team management is working overtime to sort out the pace attack for the fourth Test match beginning on Wednesday. It has emerged Akash Deep is nursing a back niggle. Earlier, Arshdeep Singh had split the webbing on his bowling hand during practice.Akash Deep, it is learnt, has developed a sore back that has troubled him in the past. He struggled to get through the second innings at Lord‚Äôs last week. He is still not certain to start in the fourth Test on Wednesday. The medical team is working hard to get him back in shape.",Mohammed Siraj has become the most important pacer for India on this tour. The team management has to think about ways of preserving him in order to ensure Siraj is at his best in the next two Tests. India's bowling coach Morne Morkel had earlier said that they have to literally take the ball out of Siraj‚Äôs hands in practice sessions.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122793279,imgsize-153786,width-400,resizemode-4/122793279.jpg"

England level series after rain-hit win

Controversy unfolded at Lord‚Äôs during the second Women‚Äôs ODI between India and England, that tipped in the hosts' favour this time around following a win for India in the 1st. In the fifth over of England‚Äôs innings, Deepti Sharma bowled a fuller delivery to Tammy Beaumont . The English opener drove it towards Jemimah Rodrigues at short midwicket. Rodrigues dove to her right, stopped the ball, and threw it back towards wicketkeeper Richa Ghosh.Beaumont, whocut short her run after opting against a quick single, was walking back to the crease. After placing her left foot inside the crease, with her right leg, she appeared to attempt kicking the ball away. Though she didn‚Äôt make contact, it appeared that she had tried to stop the ball with her foot before it reached Ghosh.The visitors appealed without fail, gesturing to the umpires that Beaumont had tried to interfere with the throw. The umpires had a long discussion and opted for a review. After watching a few replays, the third umpire decided Beaumont was not out.However, according to the laws, there is no exemption that protects a batter from being given out for Obstructing the Field even if they are back inside the crease. The ball was still in play at the time, which is clear from the fact that it was moving towards the India wicketkeeper.Additionally, it has been mentioned in another clause that the batter will not be out if they Obstruct the field accidentally, to avoid injury or in the case of a second/subsequent strike made to guard the wicket lawfully (for a striker).However, the not out decision didn‚Äôt hurt India much in terms of runs conceded, given that Beaumont was batting on 25 off 16 balls at the time and was later dismissed for 34 off 35 by Sneh Rana in the 11th over.In the match itself, England bounced back to win the second ODI by eight wickets in a rain-shortened game at Lord‚Äôs. Chasing a revised target of 115, opener Amy Jones guided the hosts home with an unbeaten 46, helping them level the three-match series 1-1.India, who had successfully chased down 259 in the first ODI, struggled with the bat this time.

Hearing improvement

may be due to nerve decompression'





SURAT: ENT now stands for ear, nose... and teeth. For nearly two decades, 63-year-old Jaibunnisha M of Kosamba in Surat district lived in a world muffled by silence. The past 10 years had been especially isolating - even the best hearing aids failed her.She had stopped attending weddings and community events. Neighbours whispered that she'd become arrogant because her children were settled abroad. The truth: she couldn't hear them.Then came July.A cochlear implant surgery was booked. Her radiologist daughter flew in from Dubai.Her dentist daughter stayed on standby in the US. But just before the procedure, something strange happened.I was sitting at home when I suddenly began hearing sounds,"" Jaibunnisha said. ""I ran to tell my husband. We even went to our neighbour's house to confirm it wasn't just us."" It wasn't.The change followed a series of dental implant procedures - full-mouth reconstruction, temporomandibular joint rehabilitation, and nerve decompression. ""Her hearing improved after the dental work. It's possible that decompressing the nerve connected to the ear had an effect,"" said implant specialist Dr Rishi Bhatt.Astonished, her ENT team paused the cochlear plans. ""Her audiogram shows marked improvement,"" said ENT surgeon Dr Ashraf Master.From needing help for every phone call to chatting freely again, Jaibunnisha now looks forward to social functions. ""My calls used to be one-way - she'd talk, we'd listen,"" said her daughter Tehzeeb, a radiologist in Dubai. ""Now she's back.""Even husband Abbas - a doctor himself - was stunned. ""At first, I didn't believe her,"" he said. ""But we thank the almighty. The dental implant helped her hear again.""Science? Miracle in the molar? A bit of both, according to doctors. But for Jaibunnisha, it simply means she doesn't need silence to feel dignified anymore.","Jaibunnisha M, 63, of Kosamba in Surat district, couldn't hear for 20 years.

R Ashwin announces retirement from Test cricket

Poll Do you believe there was ever a genuine rift between Ashwin and Harbhajan? Yes, definitely No, it was all speculation Not sure

Former India off-spinners Ravichandran Ashwin and Harbhajan Singh confronted each other about their careers, rivalry, and the jealousy factor that reportedly created a rift between the duo.Over the years, comparisons between Ashwin and fellow Indian spin legend Harbhajan Singh were frequent. Speculation about a rift between the two spinners has often surfaced, suggesting strained relations.In the explosive teaser of Season 3 of Kutti Stories with Ash, India's two great spinners can be seen clearing the air about the speculated rift between them.""This whole jealousy bit. Before I allow you to answer that, let me clarify something. People look at everything from their perspective. For example, if they are passing a comment on me, they believe that others would see the world through their eyes. This comment that you are jealous of this person who is interviewing you today ‚Äî what would that..."" Ashwin asked Harbhajan.Harbhajan replied, ""Do you think I am jealous of you? You are sitting with me today, and we have spoken at length. Do you think I am that kind of person?""Ashwin, in a very nonchalant way, replied, ""Even if you are jealous at one point, it is justified. That is my point. I would never take it the wrong way because we are all human.Naturally, it is bound to be like that.""Ashwin also cleared the air about his retirement.""Some people believe I retired because of Washington Sundar. He is in the thick of things now. All of this is the perspective of others,"" he said.Ashwin picked up 765 wickets in international cricket in 379 innings, while Harbhajan scalped 707 wickets in his illustrious career.After Ashwin's retirement from Test cricket, Harbhajan had already dispelled such rumours, asserting that there is no truth to claims of discord between them.""I read social media only as much as I need to. If there is a standoff between me and Ashwin, or if there was ever any fight, quarrel or disagreement, I would be the first person to go up to him and ask what the issue is,"" Harbhajan Singh said on his YouTube channel.""But it was never like this, and it will never be like this, because whatever is in his destiny, he will get it, and I got whatever was in my destiny. He has been a phenomenal bowler for India. I am very happy for his achievements,"" he added.","Ravichandran Ashwin and Harbhajan Singh confronted each other about their careers, rivalry, and the jealousy factor that reportedly created a rift between the duo.

Natasha Archer has been by the Princess of Wales‚Äôs side since 2010. She selected outfits for overseas tours, was even on hand at the hospital for royal baby photo calls, ready with spare outfits and supplies and was promoted to Senior Private Executive Assistant in 2022. Last week Kensington Palace confirmed Archer, now 37, is leaving to start a private ‚Äúluxury consultancy.‚ÄùSoon after the news broke, Archer switched her long-private Instagram profile to public. Royal watchers noticed two quick moves. She stopped following Meghan Markle , the Duchess‚Äôs lifestyle label As Ever, and several friends in Meghan‚Äôs circle, including makeup artist Daniel Martin and polo player Delfina Blaquier.The timing set off fresh speculation because the royal family is quietly trying to ease tensions with the Sussexes. Palace sources say aides for King Charles and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex held an informal meeting in London this month to explore next steps toward better relations. Prince William‚Äôs team did not attend, leaving doubts about how far any thaw can go.Commentators see Archer‚Äôs ‚Äúunfollow‚Äù spree as a public hint that fences remain unmended. The Blast, citing insider chatter, called the move a ‚Äúcontroversial stunt‚Äù that risks undercutting reconciliation plans said to be backed by Princess Kate herself.People who have worked with Archer stress her loyalty to the Wales household. She received the Royal Victorian Order in 2019 for personal service and is married to royal photographer Chris Jackson. Friends say her new consultancy will advise private clients on travel logistics and event styling, skills honed during fifteen years on royal duty.Neither Kensington Palace nor the Sussex office has commented on the social-media changes. Online, opinions split quickly. Some see the unfollows as a harmless reset before Archer‚Äôs career move. Others view them as a subtle show of support for Kate during a sensitive phase in family diplomacy.What happens next will likely unfold off camera. Kate is said to be focused on her children‚Äôs summer break and on a fuller return to public engagements later in the year. Meghan remains in California, preparing for new launches under her As Ever brand. Behind the scenes, advisers on both sides are expected to keep talking, while Archer steps into private life with new clients and fewer royal handles in her feed.For royal watchers, the small click of an unfollow button has added one more twist to a story that shows no sign of fading from the spotlight.","Natasha Archer has been by the Princess of Wales‚Äôs side since 2010.

has emerged as a premier global cricket hub, hosting marquee events like the IPL, Women‚Äôs T20 World Cup, Asia Cups, and Champions Trophy matches on short notice. This success stems from top-tier stadium infrastructure, rapid-response operational capacity, a massive South Asian expatriate fan base, and sophisticated event management leverage.





Beyond sports, the UAE‚Äôs cricket push delivers economic gains in tourism, hospitality, and global branding while nurturing local talent and reinforcing geopolitical neutrality.

Domestic Leagues and High Profile Games









Strategic Benefits and the Road Ahead









The Emirates Cricket Board (ECB) has earned a reputation for last-minute tournament hosting. In 2025, for example, the ICC shifted Champions Trophy group and knockout matches featuring India to Dubai due to diplomatic tensions. Similarly, the UAE picked up the 2024 Women‚Äôs T20 World Cup, relocating the entire event from Bangladesh amid unrest. ECB COO Subhan Ahmed confirmed their ‚Äúunique selling point‚Äù is flexibility, citing a track record of rapidly delivering high-profile contests.The UAE operates multiple cricket-ready stadiums like Dubai International, Sheikh Zayed (Abu Dhabi), Sharjah‚Äîall ICC-compliant and equipped with modern amenities such as advanced lighting (‚ÄúRing of Fire‚Äù), state-of-the-art pitch management, and broadcast facilities. Significantly, the ICC relocated its global headquarters to Dubai in 2005, reinforcing confidence in the region as an administrative and logistical hub.Cricket thrives in the UAE largely due to its South Asian diaspora, constituting around 60‚Äì70% of the nation‚Äôs population . Matches of and between South Asian nations draw massive crowds. Women's T20 World Cup had a crowd of nearly 16,000 in women's group games and the Women‚Äôs T20 final attracted 21,457 spectators, a 68% increase on the prior edition.Fans describe the experience as electrifying, with chanting, dancing, and a shared cultural fervour.Sporting events now generate real economic impact. The ILT20 franchise league, launched in 2022, projected to attract global fans, boosting hotel, dining, and service-sector demand. Estimates suggest the 2025 Champions Trophy fixtures in Dubai may bring in USD 45 million through tickets, broadcasting rights, and sponsorships.The UAE‚Äôs neutrality enables crucial geopolitical hosting. Hosting high-profile Asia Cups, IPL editions during pandemic restrictions, and high-stakes T20 tournaments elevates the UAE's influence and global reputation.While the UAE hosts some of the world‚Äôs most prestigious cricket tournaments, its own national team has been steadily growing, albeit with less fanfare. The UAE men‚Äôs team, governed by the Emirates Cricket Board (ECB), is an Associate Member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) since 1990. It has qualified for multiple ICC tournaments, including the 1996, 2015 ODI World Cups and several T20 World Cups, most recently competing in the 2024 edition in USA and WI. The team is composed of a mix of Emirati-born players and expatriate talent primarily from South Asia, reflecting the country‚Äôs demographic makeup. While critics argue that homegrown Emirati representation remains limited, recent grassroots initiatives and partnerships with schools are aimed at developing local talent and reducing dependency on expatriate players. In the women‚Äôs circuit, the UAE team also qualified for the ICC Women‚Äôs T20 World Cup qualifiers, signalling growing participation at all levels. These efforts reflect the UAE‚Äôs broader vision not just to host cricket but to compete and succeed on the world stage.The UAE is not only a venue provider but also a cricket incubator. Grassroots programs, net-bowling coaching, and domestic tournaments support development. The ILT20 emerges as a flagship T20 league, enabling global and local player integration, while the national team fields local and expatriate-born talent raised in the UAE.The UAE maintains a balanced cricket schedule: IPL in 2020‚Äì21, men‚Äôs T20 World Cup in 2021, Asia Cups in 2018 & 2022, Women‚Äôs T20 World Cup in 2024, and Champions Trophy matches in 2025. This diversity enhances international visibility while testing operational resilience across formats and gender parity.Cricket benefits catalyze tourism, infrastructure investment, and global branding aligning with the UAE‚Äôs broader Vision 2030 objectives. Challenges remain: global competition from emerging cricket nations, transitioning from reactive hosting to establishing dedicated annual events, and integrating Emirati nationals into cricket pathways. Still, the UAE‚Äôs strong venue framework, diasporic backing, and neutrality keep it at the forefront of cricket strategy.The UAE‚Äôs commitment to cricket extends well beyond hosting, it‚Äôs a calculated, multi-layered strategy powered by strategic infrastructure, crowd attraction, soft power, and market economics. The Emirates Cricket Board‚Äôs ability to shift events on short notice, combined with sustained investment in local talent and inclusive programming, has cemented the UAE as a global cricket hub. As itinerant hosting evolves into institutional legacy, the UAE stands poised to redefine cricket in the 21st-century sports landscape.","The UAE has emerged as a premier global cricket hub, hosting marquee events like the IPL, Women‚Äôs T20 World Cup, Asia Cups, and Champions Trophy matches on short notice.

Grace Springer, the creator of the viral moment, said she did not know that the video would go viral and that the couple were so famous that it would storm the Internet, and also their public and professional livesThe woman called himself a Coldplay megafan and said he thought it would be an interesting reaction to the kiss cam. ‚ÄúPlay stupid games‚Ä¶ win stupid prizes,"" she said, adding that she also feels bad for turning so many people's lives upside down.‚ÄúI hope their partners can heal from this and get a second chance at the happiness they deserve with their future still in front of them,‚Äù Springer said.Springer said her video should be a blessing in disguise for Byron's wife, Megan Kerrigan. HR Cabot recently divorced her husband, Kenneth Thornby.Springer's video blew up as Andy Byron was quickly identified canoodling with the head of his company's HR while another employee of the company stood witness to it.All of them and also the company Astronomer maintained radio silence on the issue -- and several LinkedIn profiles of these top bosses disappeared as social media users slammed them on their social media profiles.A conversation on toxic workplaces also started as it became apparent that many in the office were aware of the affair.A former employee revealed that the social media reaction was a reflection of how hated Andy Byron is hated by his employees.

In conversation with Sky Sports Cricket , the player shared a hilarious tactic that he uses ahead of games.When quizzed about what a player will do if they want to use the toilet in the middle of an innings, Pope did not hesitate to reveal the facts. ""Yeah, you're in a bit of trouble.

In a Vitality Blast match at Trent Bridge, Nottinghamshire defeated Lancashire despite early struggles. The game stood out for exceptional performances from 17-year-old Farhan Ahmed , who took a hat-trick and five wickets, and Tom Moores, who scored a match-winning 75 runs. Lancashire were bowled out for 126, but Notts initially struggled before securing victory with 28 balls remaining.The young sensation Farhan Ahmed has continued his remarkable rise in cricket. Last season, he became Britain's youngest player to take ten wickets in a first-class match. His five-wicket haul, including a hat-trick in the final three balls, proved crucial in restricting Lancashire.Lancashire's innings started promisingly with 38 runs from 19 balls. However, their momentum quickly faded as Notts' spinners, including Farhan and Patterson-White, struck early. The batting side tumbled to 53 for 5 in eight overs. A 62-run partnership between Matty Hurst (36) and Chris Green (29) provided some resistance but wasn't enough.Notts' chase got off to a shaky start. They were reeling at 14 for 4 after Tom Hartley's double strike in the second over.Then came Tom Moores' game-changing innings. He smashed 75 off 42 balls, forming a crucial 81-run partnership with Lyndon James (20). Despite Moores' run-out near the end, Notts reached their target of 127 with plenty of balls to spare.The victory was bittersweet for Nottinghamshire. Their poor net run rate meant they missed the quarter-finals for the third time in four seasons.
