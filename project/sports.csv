Another notable absentee is Mohammed Shami, who is still recovering from an ankle injury sustained during the 2023 ODI World Cup.

🔴 LIVE: India vs New Zealand: Another embarrassing show by India batters, series in danger

NEW DELHI: In a major blow to India's prospects in Australia, pace ace Mohammed Shami has not been included due to his knee injury for the five-Test Border-Gavaskar Trophy next month. The selectors have been forced to pick an inexperienced pace attack in the 18-member team announced on Friday.Vice-captain Jasprit Bumrah will be the pace spearhead and will have Mohammed Siraj, Akash Deep, Prasidh Krishna and Harshit Rana for support. Seam-bowling allrounder Nitish Reddy has been included as the management wants someone who can bat at No. 7 or 8 and also play the role of a fourth seamer in Australian conditions.Interestingly, the three travelling reserves — Mukesh Kumar, Navdeep Saini and Khaleel Ahmed — too are all pacers. That indicates how unsure the team management is without the services of Shami. TOI had reported on Oct 2 that Shami has developed swollen knees and could be out for six to eight weeks. The team management was looking for tall fast bowlers who can hit the deck. That's why Krishna made the cut.Rana has been backed by head coach Gautam Gambhir . Saini too has shown good form in the ongoing domestic season and he also has the experience of playing in Australia during the last tour in 2020-21.Kuldeep Yadav has been ignored for the tour as he has a chronic groin issue. Washington Sundar has made the cut and Axar Patel has been left out.Washington made a memorable Test debut in the famous win at the Gabba on the last tour. “Kuldeep was unavailable since he has been referred to the BCCI centre of excellence for long-term resolution of his chronic left groin issue,” BCCI secretary Jay Shah said.Abhimanyu Easwaran has been picked as the third opener.The selectors also announced the T20I team to play four matches in South Africa from Nov 4.

Entrepreneur-turned-politician Vivek Ramaswamy on Thursday spoke against early voting and advocated for single-day nationwide voting.At an election rally in Arizona, also attended by former President Donald Trump , Ramaswamy suggested making Election Day a national holiday, using paper ballots, and requiring government-issued ID for voter identification .""I'll be honest with you. I don't love early voting. I never have. I believe we need single-day voting on Election Day as a national holiday with paper ballots and government-issued ID to match the voter file.

You got to play by the rules we have in order to change the rules to what they should be. So I'm asking you, as Republicans, we may not like early voting. Get out there and do it anyway because we have an election to win and a country to save,"" he said.He compared the upcoming 2024 election to the American Revolution , underlining the sacrifices made by the founding fathers. ""Our founding fathers, they made a sacrifice. There were 56 men who signed the Declaration of Independence… They didn't do it for them. They did it for us,"" Ramaswamy mentioned.He likened Donald Trump to George Washington and stressed the importance of the election. ""2024 is our 1776, and I mean it when I say this.

Donald Trump's going to do his,"" he added.Ramaswamy concluded by emphasising American exceptionalism and the need to revive the American dream, urging unity and resilience.""We will make sure that our best days are still ahead of us, that we restore that American dream… That is what still gives hope to the free world,"" he declared.","Entrepreneur-turned-politician Vivek Ramaswamy on Thursday spoke against early voting and advocated for single-day nationwide voting.

🔴 LIVE: India vs New Zealand: Another embarrassing show by India batters, series in danger

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali believes that India face an uphill task to make a comeback in the second Test against New Zealand at MCA Stadium in Pune.Speaking on his YouTube channel, Basit remarked, “Rohit Sharma aur Virat Kohli agar runs kare (If Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli score runs) — two big names who failed in the first innings—there might be a possibility (of a comeback). But the chances are very low right now. New Zealand are in a very strong position to win the match... Before the Australia tour, this is not a good sign for India. Let's see what happens.”New Zealand have taken control of the Test, leading by 301 runs at stumps on day two, thanks to a brilliant performance by left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner , who grabbed 7-53 to dismantle India's batting lineup.India were bowled out for just 156 in response to New Zealand's 259, giving the visitors a 103-run first-innings lead on a challenging Pune pitch.By the end of the day, New Zealand reached 198-5 in their second innings, with Tom Latham scoring a solid 86.Wicketkeeper Tom Blundell (30 not out) and Glenn Phillips (9 not out) remained unbeaten, steering New Zealand closer to what could be a historic Test series win in India.India’s bowlers, led by Washington Sundar , showed some resistance.Sundar picked up four wickets, bringing his match tally to 11, while Ravichandran Ashwin chipped in with a key breakthrough. However, New Zealand’s batters extended their lead, leaving India in a tough spot.India’s batting collapse in the first innings was another disappointment, following their 46 all-out debacle in Bengaluru.Ravindra Jadeja top-scored with 38, but wickets tumbled regularly. Santner’s spin exposed India's vulnerabilities, with crucial dismissals, including Virat Kohli for just one and Sarfaraz Khan for 11.With New Zealand already 1-0 up in the three-match series, Basit Ali’s doubts about India’s comeback seem justified.India's struggles with the bat are particularly concerning ahead of their upcoming Australia tour. At the moment, New Zealand appear to be firmly in control, leaving India searching for answers.","Former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali believes that India face an uphill task to make a comeback in the second Test against New Zealand.

🔴 LIVE: India vs New Zealand: Another embarrassing show by India batters, series in danger

PUNE: It's difficult to pinpoint what hurt India the most — Mitchell Santner 's best-ever bowling performance or the team's poor display with the bat. Or the decision to opt for a spin-friendly track here after losing the first Test in Bengaluru. Then there was Tom Latham 's crucial knock of 86, and the visitors milking 60-plus runs via sweeps and reverse sweeps.India, trailing 0-1 in the series, wanted to play on the front foot. They are on the back foot now.Many things didn't go well for India on the second day of the second Test against New Zealand at the Gahunje stadium on Friday. As a result, their winning streak of 18 home Test series is in serious danger of ending. India were all out for 156 in response to the Kiwis' 259 in the first innings. Then Latham's 86 (133b; 10x4s) helped New Zealand reach 198-5 by stumps. The visitors are now 301 runs ahead with plenty of time in hand.Santner bettered Washington Sundar 's haul of 7-59 with his own 7-53. Like Washington, he was not a part of the previous Test. Now both have recorded their best-ever figures. Santner bowled unchanged for more than 19 overs in the morning session. The 32-year-old, playing his 29th Test in nine years, was rewarded for his maturity, change of pace and variation in length.Santner was ""shocked"" after getting Virat Kohli out bowled (1 off 9 balls) with a full toss. The former India captain was so upset with himself that after hitting the air with the bat, he hit the air again and disturbed the wickets.Those who dreamt of India taking a 200-plus lead on a deteriorating pitch were in a for a reality check at that point.From 50-1 in the 22nd over to 95-6 in the 34th over, India collapse would have shocked fans. This isn't the first time they have collapsed in this series either — it happened in the first innings in Bengaluru and also in the latter part of the second innings in that Test.India needed one batsman like Latham to show hunger and effectiveness to bat longer on this pitch. But no one put his hand up. On the other hand, the Kiwis built partnerships.If Kohli's dismissal indicated that it was not going to be India's day, Rishabh Pant had other plans. He has been given a license to thrill and kill. But even the police have to use their guns responsibly. Living dangerously, Pant (18) did not bother to bide his time. He missed a hoick and got bowled off Glenn Phillips.Sarfaraz Khan (11), meanwhile, gave catching practice to deep mid-off. He offered a difficult low catch to first slip off Santner but the fielder could not pluck it. The first Test centurion had also attempted a slog-sweep, the only problem being bat did not meet ball.The fall of other Indian batsmen were not a consequence of rash shots. But the application of Shubman Gill (30), Ravindra Jadeja (38) and Washington (18*) left a lot to be desired. Washington did not even try to farm the strike with No. 11 Jasprit Bumrah. The Tamil Nadu southpaw hit a four off the last ball of the previous over.India did not latch on to the difficult chances (Pant and Gill) when their turn to make amends in the field came. Santner spoke with empathy about India's effort. ""A couple of umpires' calls and a couple of difficult chances did not go their way,"" he said. But India were lucky to get Rachin Ravindra (9) early despite the stage being set for him at 89-2. The left-hander misread the line from a Washington delivery and was bowled.",India were all out for 156 in response to the Kiwis' 259 in the first innings. Tom Latham's 86 (133b; 10x4s) helped New Zealand reach 198-5 by stumps.

NEW DELHI: Rishabh Pant is a livewire on the field, bringing energy to the atmosphere with his thrilling shots while batting and his entertaining antics behind the wickets.In a hilarious turn of events that unfolded during the first day's play of the second Test against New Zealand in Pune, Pant was caught on the stump mic telling spinner Washington Sundar to bowl a bit fuller to Kiwi tailender Ajaz Patel ""Washi aage daal sakta you can bowl a little fuller, thoda bahar daal sakta hai,"" Pant came up with a suggestion to Sundar.Sundar seemed to have followed Pant's advice, delivering a tossed-up ball that turned out to be a bit too straight. Ajaz Patel swung through the line, and the ball flew to the right of mid-on, racing away for four runs.Patel's response to Sundar's delivery left Pant slightly disappointed, as he was overheard saying, ""Yaar mereko kya pata issey Hindi aati hai"".In the match, Sundar shone on his return to the Indian side, taking seven wickets as New Zealand was bowled out for 259. At the close of play in Pune, India stood at 16 for 1, having lost captain Rohit Sharma for a nine-ball duck to a Tim Southee delivery that shaped away and crashed into the off-stump off his pad.Yashasvi Jaiswal, with six runs, and Shubman Gill, with ten, were at the crease as the hosts trailed by 243 runs. Devon Conway and Rachin Ravindra led the New Zealand batting effort, scoring 76 and 65 runs, respectively, after captain Tom Latham won the toss.Off-spinner Sundar finished with impressive figures of 7 for 59, while fellow off-break bowler Ravichandran Ashwin took 3 for 64, helping to dismiss New Zealand in just 79.1 overs.","Rishabh Pant was caught on the stump mic telling spinner Washington Sundar to bowl a bit fuller to Kiwi tailender Ajaz Patel.

Can Washington succeed Ashwin?

Chennai: October 24, 2024, will undoubtedly go down as a red-letter day in Tamil Nadu cricket history as two ‘sons of the soil’ joined forces to bag all 10 wickets for India in a Test innings .On the opening day of the second match in Pune on Thursday, the returning Washington Sundar ran through the New Zealand middle and lower-order with a personal-best seven-wicket haul after fellow off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin removed the top-three.The masterclass from Washington and Ashwin effectively made it a mini contest between TN and NZ, with the finger spinners from the southern region of the country emerging well on top in the end. The ‘brothers of destruction’ brought huge cheer to everyone associated with cricket in TN, a state that has a history of producing fine slow bowlers.“It was fantastic to see two off-spinners from TN combine to pick up all 10 wickets in an innings. Washington was a surprise element; no one would have expected him to pick up seven wickets. It is a great thing for him as well as TN cricket. When it comes to Ashwin, he has been consistently doing well and is expected to be among the wickets,” M Venkataramana , former India off-break bowler and TN head coach, told TOI.With pride swelling in his voice, M Senthilnathan, a former TN player who coaches MRF Globe Trotters SC – theTNCA first-division team which Washington plays for – said: “Washington can be a lethal weapon with the ball on turning tracks. Washington and Ashwin have shown in this Test that they can play together. The TN guys did it (10 wickets) together. They bowled NZ out.”As Ashwin is at the twilight of his glorious career, the selectors and management are busy finding an able successor for the maestro. Washington fits the bill and has made a strong case on his Test comeback.Asked if Washington can be a like-for-like replacement for Ashwin after the latter hangs up his boots, Venkataramana said: “So far, he has proved himself in white-ball cricket. In international red-ball cricket , this is the first time he has performed so well with the ball. He has to keep improving. He has to work harder to have the skills to bowl well on good batting tracks. If he does that, he will be very good in the future. His past experience in the India team will help.”Senthilnathan said that Washington has the wherewithal to operate in a spin-heavy attack. “He will be a star performer for India in the years to come. Ashwin has been doing very well. There is an option to play both of them. If Ashwin continues to play like this, why not have both of them in the XI? When we can play two left-arm spinners in the XI, why cannot we have two right-arm off-spinners in the team?”",Washington Sundar and Ravichandran Ashwin took all 10 wickets in India's innings. The 'brothers of destruction' brought huge cheer to everyone associated with cricket in Tamil Nadu. Former India off-break bowler M Venkataramana said Washington can be a like-for-like replacement for Ashwin after he hangs up his boots.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114566767,imgsize-55024,width-400,resizemode-4/114566767.jpg"

India’s squad for the

Border-Gavaskar Trophy

:

Reserves:

Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) announced an 18-member India squad for the five-match Test series against Australia on Friday with Abhimanyu Easwaran, Harshit Rana and Nitish Rana included. The series begins in Perth on November 22.Arguably, the biggest talking point in the squad is the absence of Mohammed Shami , who had been working against the clock to get ready for the series. The match-changing seamer underwent ankle surgery earlier in the year and his rehabilitation process had appeared to be on track until a recent swelling to his knee.Kuldeep Yadav is also not in the squad to figure out a long-term solution for his chronic left groin issue. BCCI said in a statement, ""Kuldeep Yadav was unavailable for selection for the tour of Australia since he has been referred to The BCCI Centre of Excellence after the end of the ongoing Test series against New Zealand for long term resolution of his chronic left groin issue.""Mukesh Kumar, Navdeep Saini and Khaleel Ahmed have been named as the reserves.Bengal's Easwaran has been rewarded for his success in domestic cricket as he becomes the third-choice opener alongside skipper Rohit Sharma and Yashasvi Jaiswal.India will also travel with a well-stocked pace attack alongside the leading pair of Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj. Akash Deep has maintained his spot following impressive performances against England and Bangladesh, while Prasidh Krishna returns to the Test squad after debuting in South Africa.The Karnataka seamer underwent lengthy rehabilitation for a stress fracture. He was impressive in India A's Duleep Trophy title win last month.Seamer Harshit Rana gets to cap off an excellent year where he starred in an IPL title and now gets a Test call-up, after already being picked in the other two white-ball squads.Andhra Pradesh's medium-pace all-rounder Nitish Reddy is in the same boat as Rana, having impressed in the T20 league and stepping up to India level with his T20I bow in the Bangladesh series this month.Among the spin-bowling options, Washington Sundar, who took seven wickets in the first innings against New Zealand in the on-going second Test in Pune, has also been picked. But Axar Patel has been left out.Rohit Sharma (C), Jasprit Bumrah (VC), Yashasvi Jaiswal, Abhimanyu Easwaran, Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, KL Rahul, Rishabh Pant (WK), Sarfaraz Khan, Dhruv Jurel (WK), R Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Mohammed Siraj, Akash Deep, Prasidh Krishna, Harshit Rana, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Washington Sundar.Mukesh Kumar, Navdeep Saini, Khaleel Ahmed.","India announce 18-member squad for five-match Test series against Australia.

However, his fortunes declined during the 2017 season, and his role came under scanner due to shifting of power structure, as he revealed in his latest book. Virender Sehwag was roped in as mentor of Punjab and it was the time when Maxwell was named the side's captain. However, the duo found themselves at loggerheads with Sehwag asserting his authority and taking control of decisions, including selecting the playing XI.""When it came to selection, I thought it might be a good idea to bring the coaches into a WhatsApp group to make our decisions. Everyone agreed to this and shared their teams, with the exception of Sehwag,"" Maxwell wrote in his book, the excerpt of which was published on ESPNCricinfo.""At the end of the process, he made it clear that he would pick the starting XI, end of story. We were losing on and off the field by now, with Sehwag on more than one occasion making decisions that didn't necessarily make sense.""Maxwell revealed that his relationship with Sehwag deteriorated further after he publicly criticized him. This public criticism deepened the rift between the two, worsening their already strained dynamic.""The season came down to our final group game against Pune away from home, and we had a shocker batting first on a wet wicket, rolled for 73. It was all over. In the context of what was going on, I'm still quite proud of how we were able to broadly keep the show on the road until that stage,"" Maxwell wrote.""I was also happy with how I performed, doing the right thing as leader by giving myself the chance to influence games at the right time with bat and ball. Of course, we were all flat not to make the postseason, but it could have been so much worse.""I volunteered to do press that night, but Sehwag said he would instead. Upon getting onto the team bus, I found I'd been deleted from the main WhatsApp group. What was going on here? By the time we reached the hotel my phone was blowing up, with Sehwag having unloaded on me as a ""big disappointment"", blaming me for not taking responsibility as captain, and all the rest. It was unpleasant, especially when I thought we had parted on good terms.""""I texted him to say how much it hurt to read those comments and added that he had lost a fan in me for the way he had conducted himself. Sehwag's response was simple: ""Don't need fan like you."" We never spoke again. I knew my time was at an end and told the owners as much: if Sehwag was going to stick around, they were making a mistake and not to bother with me. He only lasted one more season,"" Maxwell wrote.","Australian all-rounder Glenn Maxwell spilled the beans on the team infighting during his stint with Kings XI Punjab (now Punjab Kings ) in the IPL.

With only a point in the kitty — that, too, from their abandoned previous game against Bengal — a beleaguered Bihar will play host to Karnataka in a Ranji Trophy Elite Group C tie in Patna starting Saturday.The third-round fixture is Bihar’s first home game of the 2024-25 Ranji Trophy season where they will be up against a side who are in a must-win situation following two weather-affected drawn games.The Veer Pratap Singh-led home team will have to regroup and play out of their skin to take the fight to the star-studded Karnataka camp, who will be hungry for some game time on the field at Moin-ul Haq Stadium .The onus will be on the hosts to prove they are no pushovers in the top tier of the premier domestic tournament, too.As fate would have it, domestic heavyweights Karnataka are sixth in the eight-team group after collecting only two points from the opening two games.

🔴 LIVE: India vs New Zealand: Another embarrassing show by India batters, series in danger

LONDON: Indian billionaires Sanjiv Goenka and Mukesh Ambani have put in opening bids for multiple franchises in the Hundred , TOI can confirm. Both billionaires offered bids to the England and Wales Cricket Board ( ECB ) in the first round of bidding last Friday to buy stakes in multiple teams, insiders said.Others believed to have bid in the first round include the Glazer siblings, who own a majority stake in Manchester United and the director of Chelsea Football Club Jonathan Goldstein.The Hundred is a 100-ball cricket tournament first held in 2021 featuring eight teams situated in iconic British venues. The ECB is set for the first time to sell 49% stakes of each team to investors. There are three rounds of bidding.The Ambanis own Mumbai Indians in the IPL , as well as three other T20 teams – MI Cape Town, MI New York and MI Emirates. If the Ambanis were to buy London Spirit which is based at Lord’s, it could lead to them renaming it MI London.Last week at a special general meeting, MCC members voted on whether to accept the offer of a 51 per cent share in the London Spirit franchise. Voting remains open until Monday.Goenka, the founder and chairman of RPSG Group, already owns the IPL team Lucknow Super Giants and Durban’s Super Giants, which plays in the SA20 in South Africa. A stake in any of the Hundred teams will be an extension of that. It is understood that Goenka has bid for several teams.Decisions on successful bidders will be made by the ECB and the relevant host venue and announced in 2025. The first-round valuation of the eight teams is thought to be around £500 million. The proceeds from the sale will be shared across the recreational and professional game in the UK.Team owners will get a share of central revenues, such as broadcast rights and central competition sponsorship.""It wouldn't be appropriate for us to confirm either the name of interested parties or the value of any of the bids submitted. We are delighted by the level of interest we've seen, and the enthusiasm of investors from within the UK and around the world to become part of the competition,"" an ECB spokesperson said.There was no response from the Ambani group and the RPSG group declined to comment.",Indian billionaires Sanjiv Goenka and Mukesh Ambani have put in opening bids for multiple franchises in the Hundred.

India's bowling coach

says team's batters need to 'absorb pressure' & 'iron out mistakes' fast

🔴 LIVE: India vs New Zealand: Another embarrassing show by India batters, series in danger

PUNE: India's batting lineup has been prone to sudden collapses in the ongoing series against New Zealand. First they were all out 46, then folded up for 462 after being 408-3 in the first Test in Bengaluru. Here in the second Test, they managed just 156 in reply to New Zealand's 259.""I never like to have a punch-up between batters and bowlers,"" the team's bowling coach Morne Morkel said after the second day's play at the Gahunje Stadium on Friday. ""You need to score the first-innings runs. They (India batsmen) have got their processes and they know how to go about those things. Hopefully we can iron those mistakes out because it's costing us at the moment.""The conversations we've had (are about) showing good intensity, showing good body language, looking to score on these wickets."" Morkel said. He added that after losing the early wickets, ""the mindset of Indian batsmen was to go as close to the NZ score (259)"". This clearly indicated that India did not feel that scoring 450-plus runs and batting only once in the game was possible. It was also deemed as 'that sort of a wicket'.Morkel also echoed Kiwi assistant coach Luke Ronchi's thinking — that you have to bat smart and find ways to get off strike. It is not just about boundaries or big shots, as the NZ batters have shown. If you rotate strike frequently, the bowler automatically faces some trouble as he is not getting to bowl successive balls to a specific batter.NZ have scored more than 100 runs without boundaries in the second innings. ""We are missing those small little things,"" said Morkel. ""You have to absorb the pressure and then look for ways to score. We are just struggling to find that rhythm."" Morkel also said scoring was important and not just the blocking game ""because one ball comes with your name (wicket) written on it"".Credit must also be given to the adaptability shown by New Zealand and their understanding of conditions and the situation, indicated Morkel. ""Playing those important moments, they have done better than us. They are creating pressure with the ball and they are also putting our bowlers under pressure through sweeping and reverse-sweeping.""The 15 Kiwi wickets that have fallen in this match so far have been taken by either Washington (11) or Ashwin (4), both off-spinners. Morkel defended the selection of Akash Deep as the second pacer in this match for the skills and value that he brings to the table. However, he has bowled only six of 140-plus overs over two innings so far.New Zealand's seven-wicket hero Mitchell Santner (7/53), on his part, said the idea was to bowl with control, bowl wicket-to-wicket with variations of speed and angle. He also said the Kiwi batters were extra-defensive on the tour of India in 2016 and paid the price for it.",India's bowling coach Morne Morkel says team's batters need to 'absorb pressure' & 'iron out mistakes' Morkel also echoed Kiwi assistant coach Luke Ronchi's thinking — that you have to bat smart and find ways to get off strike.

Ramandeep Singh's half-century couldn't save India A from a 20-run loss to Afghanistan A in the Emerging Teams Asia Cup T20 semifinal held in Al Amerat, Oman, on Friday. Afghanistan A will now face Sri Lanka A in the final.Afghanistan A chose to bat first and posted 206/4, the highest total in the tournament. This was made possible by a strong 137-run opening partnership between Sediqullah Atal, who scored 83 off 52 balls, and Zubaid Akbari, who made 64 off 41 balls.India A struggled in their chase, losing five wickets by the 13th over. Ramandeep Singh and Nishant Sindhu then put together a quick 68-run partnership in just 31 balls. However, when India needed 53 runs from the last three overs, Nishant was run out after a miscommunication, having scored 23 off 13 balls.Afghanistan's Abdul Rahman, who took 2/32, bowled the final over and managed to dismiss Ramandeep on the last ball, limiting India to 186/7.Sri Lanka A earlier secured their spot in the final by defeating Pakistan Shaheens. They restricted Pakistan to 135/9 and chased the target down in 16.3 overs, winning by seven wickets. Leg-spinner Dushan Hemantha took 4/21, while Nipun Ranskika and Eshan Malinga claimed two wickets each.Afghanistan A got a strong start, reaching 61 without loss by the sixth over, with Zubaid and Sediqullah dominating the Indian bowlers. Zubaid hit four sixes and five fours, while Sediqullah added four sixes and seven fours.After Zubaid was dismissed, Karim Janat continued the aggressive play with a quick 41 off 20 balls, including two sixes and four fours. Rasikh Salam then delivered a crucial spell, taking three wickets, including two in consecutive balls, to curb Afghanistan's scoring in the final overs.India A had a shaky start, losing three wickets within the powerplay overs. Allah Mohammed Ghazanfar took the wickets of Abhishek Sharma (7) and Prabhsimran Singh (19), while Tilak Varma (16) fell to Abdul Rahman, leaving India at 48/3 in 5.4 overs. Ayush Badoni (31) and Nehal Wadhera (20) tried to stabilise the innings but Afghanistan triggered another collapse.(Sediqullah Atal 83, Zubaid Akbari 64, Karim Janat 41; Rasikh Salam 3/25)(Ramandeep Singh 64)","Afghanistan A beat India A by 20 runs in Emerging Teams T20 Asia Cup semi-final.

It rained non-stop throughout the day after a cyclone hit the Bengal-Odisha coast on Friday morning.The weather has affected both sides' Ranji campaign this season so far. While Bengal missed out on crucial points after their last match against Bihar was called off without a ball being bowled due to poor ground conditions, only two sessions of play was possible due to rain in the drawn Kerala vs Karnataka match.Hence both the sides will be eager to get a full match after ending up with one point each last time. However, that looks quite unlikely now. ""From the first match onwards, our games have been affected by rain. It's frustrating, but we are now used to it,"" Kerala skipper Sachin Baby told TOI while enquiring about the weather.As the entire ground has been kept under covers, neither Bengal skipper Anushtup Majumder nor his Kerala counterpart, got a chance to see the pitch and decide on the team combination.Bengal will miss three key players in opener Abhimanyu Easwaran , wicketkeeper-batter Abishek Porel and pacer Mukesh Kumar, who have joined the India 'A' squad for their tour Down Under.Sachin did not feel their absence would be an advantage for them. ""Bengal is always a good side, full of experience. With the return of Chatterjee (Sudip) and Saha (Wriddhiman), they are a very balanced unit,"" he said.The good news for the hosts is that Ishan Porel has recovered from his injury and will be leading the side's pace attack. Bengal's comeback man Saha, who celebrated his 40th birthday on Thursday, is likely to don the wicketkeeper's gloves once again while Shuvam Dey may open with in-form Sudip.In Sanju Samson's absence, Kerala will look to their skipper, Rohan Kunummal, Baba Aparajith and Mohammed Azharudden to put up a big score and bank on Jalaj Saxena, a doyen of domestic cricket, to bail them out if they get into trouble. The side will look for more from former Vidarbha all-rounder Aditya Sarwate, who has already made his presence felt for his new side picking up nine wickets in two matches so far.","Bengal and Kerala players were forced to stay indoors and keep an eye on the sky.

Kochi: Kerala Blasters paid a heavy price for two goof-ups, one by Pritam Kotal in the first half and then by goalkeeper Som Kumar in the second, as they went down to arch-rivals Bengaluru FC 1-3, despite dominating most of their fixture at the Jawaharlal Nehru International Stadium on Friday night.Second-half substitute Edgar Mendez scored twice for BFC in the 74th and 94th minutes after Pereyra Diaz gave them an early lead in the eighth minute. Jesus Jimenez Nunez (45+2) scored Blasters’ lone goal from a penalty.Former Blasters player Pereyra Diaz, who doesn’t enjoy a good relationship with the Blasters fans, continued to haunt the home side as he put BFC ahead before the match settled down. Capitalising on a Pritam Kotal mistake, Diaz won the ball from the Blasters centre-back and outfoxed Blasters goalkeeper Som Kumar with a delightful chip.After conceding, Blasters came out all guns blazing, and the remaining 37 minutes of the first half saw complete domination by the home side. They nearly equalised in the 11th minute, but Jesus’ stunning long-range shot from outside the box rebounded after hitting the top post. Two minutes later, Vibin Mohanan attempted a similar shot from the edge of the box, but this time the ball went over the bar.In the 29th minute, Blasters were awarded a free kick in the ‘D’ area after Rahul Bheke was caught handling the ball at the edge of the box. However, Luna's direct free kick missed the goal by inches. Though it seemed that Bheke deserved a yellow card for his foul, Referee Tejas Nagvenkar thought otherwise.That decision was crucial as Bheke entered the books in the 44th minute for a late challenge on Kwame Peprah inside the box. The foul resulted in a penalty, and Jesus converted it to put Blasters on level terms. It was also the first goal conceded by BFC in the last six matches.A silly error from Blasters’ 19-year-old goalkeeper Som Kumar saw BFC regain the lead in the 74th minute. Som Kumar came off his line to clear a free kick that came in for Alberto Ripoll . However, he failed to complete the catch and fumbled the ball as second-half substitute Edgar Mendez smashed the ball into the back of the net.With Blasters throwing more men forward in a desperate attempt to find an equaliser, BFC took advantage and put the game beyond their grasp in the 94th minute. Pritam Kotal once again gave away the ball to Mohammed Salah, who found Mendez all alone at the half-line. Receiving the ball, Mendez dribbled past Som Kumar, who came off his line, and shot the ball into an empty net.With this win, BFC extended their lead at the top of the points table and have 16 points from six matches, while Blasters remain in the sixth position with eight points.","Kerala Blasters paid a heavy price for two goof-ups, one by Pritam Kotal in the first half and then by goalkeeper Som Kumar in the second.

The cause of death was not specified, but local media reported it was due to cardiac arrest.Ze Carlos was part of the Brazil squad that reached the final of the 1998 World Cup. Initially uncapped, he was called up as a replacement for Flavio Conceicao.

Brazil won that match on penalties.

Although the club is yet to receive an official communication from the I-league authorities regarding the change, the tentative fixtures released on Thursday suggest that Manjeri will be their new home turf.The decision to move from the EMS Corporation Stadium in Kozhikode was anticipated after the Kozhikode corporation, who owns the stadium, decided to allocate the venue to KFA for hosting the Kerala Super League . Despite playing in Kozhikode since their debut season in the I-league in 2017-18, Gokulam is officially registered under the Malappuram District Football Association and had played a few matches in Manjeri during the previous season.According to the schedule, Gokulam will host their first home game on December 3 against Aizawl FC . Prior to that, they will face Sudeva in the opening day fixture on November 22 in Hyderabad and play against Real Kashmir in Srinagar in the second round.The 12-team I-League will run through December, January, February, and March, ending on April 6, 2025.Sporting Club Bengaluru and Dempo SC are the two new entrants into the country’s second-tier club competition after finishing as champions and runners-ups of 2023-24 I-League 2.The All India Football Federation (AIFF) said it held a meeting with the I-League club owners on Thursday and they agreed to its proposals ""to invite potential sponsors and the initiative to bring the telecasting partners and broadcasting team on board for all the I-League matches, including the IWL and other elite group of competitions in AIFF "".""Hopefully, we will be able to complete this process by the second week of November as the first match is on 22nd November.

As the two teams prepare to face each other for the first time this season at the Jawaharlal Nehru International Stadium, Kochi on Friday, fans are expecting another high-octane clash.Bengaluru are enjoying an impressive unbeaten run and are on top of the table, while Blasters, with their recent form, are expected to pose a significant challenge to the former champions.Since losing their opening match against Punjab FC, Blasters remained undefeated in their last four outings, securing two wins and two draws. In the 15 previous ISL meetings between the two sides, Bengaluru emerged victorious on nine occasions, while Blasters won just four fixtures, with two games ending in draws.However, Bengaluru have struggled historically at Kochi, never keeping a clean sheet at the Blasters' home venue and losing three out of the five matches played here. Their record of not conceding a goal this season might be put to the test against Blasters, especially with the home side playing attacking football with Noah Sadoui, Adrian Luna, and Jesus Jiminez in top form.The return of talismanic midfielder Luna to full fitness will boost the Blasters' confidence. ""I think of course we are three good players, but we need more time to play together. But so far Noah and Jesus are doing fantastic. I played 90 minutes after a long time (against Mohammedan Sporting). I need to catch up with them and hopefully we will continue to be good throughout the season,"" said Luna on match-eve.Blasters head coach Stahre emphasised their approach, stating, ""We want to play a fast, confident game. We strive to be highly competitive, and for each match, we have different game plans. About 80 per cent of our strategy is based on our core philosophy, while the remaining 20 per cent is tailored to adjustments for each game."" Sunil Chhetri , who scored seven goals against Blasters, will again be a threat. But the man to watch out for will be Nikhil Poojary , who recorded an impressive average of 24 forward passes per game this season and will look to make a difference in the midfield.","Bengaluru are enjoying an impressive unbeaten run and are on top of the table.

ISL: A text to Coyle that led to Edwin’s return to Chennaiyin FC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/isl-a-text-to-coyle-that-led-to-edwins-return-to-chennaiyin-fc/articleshow/114546752.cms,"Edwin Sydney Vanspaul in training

Excerpts:

How did the comeback to Chennaiyin happen?

How did you feel when you returned to Chennaiyin for selection?

When Coyle decided to sign you, what were his expectations?

You are yet to make a competitive appearance since returning to CFC. Are you fully fit and prepared to get back into action?

How did you remain in good shape when you were away from the East Bengal first team?

What would you like to achieve in your second stint at Chennaiyin

Edwin Sydney Vanspaul endured tough times at East Bengal FC after joining the Kolkata giants last year. Edwin was sparingly used by former East Bengal head coach Carles Cuadrat in the Indian Super League 2023-24 season and was later left out of the first team.Beginning the new season with the East Bengal reserve side, the Tamil Nadu player kept a sharp lookout for options to resurrect his career. Edwin turned to a familiar face and contacted Chennaiyin FC chief coach Owen Coyle , who he had worked with during his first spell at the southern ISL team.The attempt yielded a positive result as the 32-year-old terminated his East Bengal contract and returned to Chennaiyin, for the ongoing 2024-25 season. In an interaction with TOI, Edwin, a versatile player who can operate in midfield and defence, spoke about how the transfer to CFC materialised, the conversations he had with Coyle, his role in the team and more.I took the initiative to talk to Coyle. Everyone knew that I was finding it difficult at East Bengal. Signing for East Bengal was a good thing, but it did not go the way I wished. I did not get enough game time, so I thought whether I should stay at East Bengal or look for opportunities elsewhere. I first messaged Coyle, I asked him if there was an opportunity and told him that I was looking forward to play. We were getting towards the end of the summer transfer window and the club had completed most of the signings by then. But I made one last try. Coyle asked me to come and conducted trials for about a week. He told me clearly that he would sign me only if I am good enough. He was satisfied with how I performed in the trials.Coming back and having the touch of football felt different. I was extremely happy. I was under a lot of stress at East Bengal and was worried about what would happen next. When I joined the Chennaiyin camp, I was able to forget all the stress I had; it did not even cross my mind. Coyle has given me a new life following a period of struggle. He is always honest with his players, that is what I like about him the most. I cannot express my feelings in words.Coyle told me that he knows how I played in the ISL 2019-20 season. I responded that I am no longer young (laughs). He then said: “You need not match the speed of the youngsters. I want you to show them that you are pushing them for a spot in the team.” The way he demands is different; knowing what we have, he will get the best out of us.Personally, I am ready for everything; I am ready to do whatever the coach asks of me. That is the mentality I returned to Chennaiyin with. I had prepared myself for that. When I spoke to the coach, I told him: “It does not matter where you play me or how long you play me… 10 minutes or 20 minutes. I am fit and ready to give my 100 per cent.” Coyle explained to me that we are following a process and that I will get opportunities in the coming matches.I knew that I would get a chance one day, and I kept myself ready for it. When I played in the East Bengal reserve team, I learnt from the youngsters. A number of them are good. Whenever I took the field, I played with seriousness. That helped me a lot during my selection at Chennaiyin. Had I taken things lightly when I was in the East Bengal reserve team, I would have struggled to show my best in the CFC trials.When I left CFC last year, some fans messaged me saying that I left the club only because East Bengal offered me a better salary. I went there for a challenge. Had I gone there for money, I would not have come back to Chennaiyin. There were some things that needed to be worked out during my contract termination; I could have stayed there since I had a year left. Football is everything for me. I went to Kolkata for a change and I wanted to experience the derby. I managed to do it and the derby experience was great. Having come back to CFC, I want to act as a mentor to the youngsters and talk to them about the situations I have experienced over the years. I want to motivate the young players to give their best. I just ask them to be ready for every opportunity that comes their way. Whenever the youngsters need help, I will be there to explain how to navigate the tough situations.",Edwin Sydney Vanspaul is yet to make a competitive appearance for Chennaiyin FC.

My fighting spirit helped me win my first ITF title: Tanisha Kashyap,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/my-fighting-spirit-helped-me-win-my-first-itf-title-tanisha-kashyap/articleshow/114554193.cms,"Tanisha Kashyap in action during the $15,000 ITF women's tennis event in Bengaluru last week. (Photo Credit: KSLTA/Deepthi Indukuri)

For Tanisha Kashyap , 22, the $15,000 ITF title in Bengaluru last week will remain special for many reasons, not least because it's her first one on the pro circuit.""This one's really special because it's in my home country, in India, and it's something that I've waited for a while,"" Tanisha said.""I'm really glad how I performed in the week I was actually injured. I had a neck catch which led to my shoulders because of the continuous matches that I played.""And it was tough each and every match to play with that pain, but I managed it really well. Mentally, I stayed strong and I relied on my fitness to win this title.""Tanisha, world ranked 868, overcame Akanksha Nitture 6-7 (5), 6-1, 6-1 in the final of the hard court event.The triumph was made all the more memorable by the difficult start to the season wherein she was rendered out of action for three months after undergoing a ""mini surgery"" to treat a meniscus and ACL tear.Tanisha suffered the injury during an event in Monastir, Tunisia, in early April. She was leading in the second set against Finland'sAnastasia Kulikova , a former top-200 player with nine pro titles, when she felt pain but played through it. It was only the following day when she underwent scan, she discovered the full extent of the injury.""I cannot disclose what treatment I got, because I was treated by (Daniil) Medvedev's doctor … (I was) set back for three to four weeks,"" she said.""I was completely off from tennis. I was on crutches. I didn't play for three-four (sic) months. I was just building back my fitness and building the strength of my knee and everything.""So I would say this year has been tough, mentally, physically, and I had to face a lot adversities in the beginning because it was not looking that great.""But through it all, I stayed positive and didn't lose sight of my goal. I worked hard each and every day to build myself back up from injury … to get to where I'm right now, to lift my first pro title.""The time away from action and the subsequent comeback helped her understand her game better.""When I did start, it was also very tough, because when you start to play tournaments, you're trying to figure it out again because there's some pain or there's a certain movement that's bothering you.""So you have to find out, you have to go back and do therapy. It was a process to figure it out and to also strengthen my quads back up to support my knee. So, it was tough.""But, sometimes when there's a lot of chaos, when you have a lot of time, you can really think about tennis from an outside perspective, and you get to know yourself better.""Tunisia seems to be Tanisha's favourite hunting ground, at least this year, and it was for a reason.""The best probable reason why I frequently played in Monastir (is) because I've been boarding in All In Tennis Academy (in France), and it's very close,"" she said.""It's not that expensive to travel, not much of jet lag. And the level of the tournaments in Monastir are way, way, much higher than other places.""And I was still fresh off an injury. If you're injured and suddenly go to Thailand, what do you do? You go to Indonesia, you spend all that money for two weeks and you might not perform well.""It was in Monastir while she was finding her way back in July that she first felt a catch in the neck, which forced her to retire from a $15K event in the second round when she was leading 6-2, 4-1 against Spaniard Victoria Gomez O'Hayon.It was the same issue that cropped up in Bengaluru at the very start of the tournament, and she showed tremendous grit to play through the pain and obvious discomfort it put her in.""Right before my first round, in a certain movement, I jerked it, and I had the same neck catch again,"" she said.""I couldn't look up, I couldn't look to my right, I couldn't serve. And I think throughout this tournament, I had so many double faults. I'm sure the statistics are there.""It taught me something. I stayed strong, I battled each and every point. I ran for each and every shot. I didn't, you know, let anything go. So, that fighting spirit really helped me win this tournament.""And, of course, some strategy here and there, and to play smart tennis.""Smart tennis she did have to play in the final which lasted two hours and 19 minutes.""I knew that I had limited range of motion, and I knew that I couldn't blast my first serves, how I was blasting in Mysuru or before. So I knew that I had to tennis wise, play smart, and place the ball and start off the point and stay in the rallies for my match.""For sure, the neck started to act during the first set, which lasted more than an hour and a half. She delivered nine double faults in the opener, compared to just one for the remainder of the match.""When I was four or five down, my neck started to really catch again, and it was really extremely painful. So I had no other option to call the physio,"" Tanisha said.""The second and third, I took a breather. I just kind of meditated and focused on my game strategy … to place the balls away from her striking zone and to make her work for each and every point.And maybe she wasn't expecting, maybe she thought that I would be tired out and I wouldn't fight back. But I've always been a fighter, and I stayed strong mentally and just stayed in it, and I let her make the errors.""I was calm and cool. I can't explain it, but you know, I just went into my zone.""Tanisha has been mainly coached by her father Suresh Kalita. But she had worked with former Davis Cupper Vishaal Uppal and Billie Jean King Cup player Rushmi Chakravarthi among other coaches. She also had a short stint at the JC Ferrero Tennis Academy in Spain before heading to the Ohio State University to play college tennis.Having seen her share of tennis abroad, the Assam native believes that while the ""commitment level and fitness level"" were the areas where Indian players lagged, it was not necessary that they had to relocate to elsewhere to make the breakthrough.""We can definitely do that here as well. Like I said, it depends on the individual and how much they want to do it.""They might be doing the same exercises that the Europeans are doing, but it's not up to the standard that the Europeans are doing. In the sense, the effort, the physical ability, how much you are pushing yourself.""I've always believed that it's an individual's choice. And, there are some great tennis coaches, fitness coaches here. But in the end of the day, it's how hard you push yourself.""As for herself, Tanisha is not ready to rest on her Bengaluru laurels.""""This is just the beginning of something,"" she said, ""it's a good achievement, but I'm looking for more. I'm gonna get back to train and recover, to win some more, hopefully soon.""It's just one of the small stepping stones towards the bigger picture and the bigger goal.""","Tanisha Kashyap, 22, won the $15,000 ITF title in Bengaluru last week.
