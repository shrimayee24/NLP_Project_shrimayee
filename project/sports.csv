"Cong erased Patel's legacy, PM Modi restored his rightful place: Amit Shah",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cong-erased-patels-legacy-pm-modi-restored-his-rightful-place-amit-shah/articleshow/124975416.cms,"In Khagariya, Amit Shah Frames Bihar Poll As Choice Between NDA's Five Pandavas And RJD's Jungle Raj

EKTA NAGAR, NARMADA: Attacking the Congress for “leaving no stone unturned to erase Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s legacy” and overlooking his contribution in uniting the country after Independence, home minister Amit Shah on Thursday said the Narendra Modi govt accorded him due recognition by erecting his 182-ft ‘ Statue of Unity ’ at Kevadia, now called Ekta Nagar, and organising an annual parade of all state and Central police forces at the site on his birth anniversary.This year being the 150th birth anniversary of Sardar Patel, the Rashtriya Ekta Diwas parade will get grander. Presided over by the prime minister, it has been upgraded to the scale of the Republic Day parade. It will feature march-past by various state police and Central paramilitary contingents, each led by woman officers, as well as salute by Shaurya Chakra awardees of CRPF and 16 BSF personnel awarded police medals for their valour during Operation Sindoor. Also on display will be heroic stunts by BSF’s Indian breed dogs, daredevilry by motorcycle-borne personnel of the Assam police and BSF’s camel show. Just like the Republic Day parade, tableaux of different state police and paramilitary forces will be part of the parade. Cultural performances, including a grand closing show of dances from various parts of the country featuring 900 artistes, will enthrall the audience as they watch the spectacle with Sardar Patel’s towering statue as the perfect backdrop.A flypast by IAF’s Suryakiran team will match from the sky, the show of colour and talent on the ground.Shah, while addressing a conference on the event in Patna, said the grand parade will not be a one-off event and shall be organised every year on October 31, “similar to the Republic Day parade on January 26”. He said that this parade will serve as a strong medium to inspire the youth of the nation and educate them about Sardar Patel’s principles and his immense contributions to the country.The 150th year tribute to the ‘Iron Man of India” shall continue well beyond Friday. A ‘Bharat Parv’ is being organised here in Ekta Nagar from Nov 1 and shall conclude on the birth anniversary of tribal icon Bhagwan Birsa Munda. “This program will showcase a wonderful synthesis of the cultural diversity, food, costumes, crafts, folk art and music of tribes from across the country,” shared Shah.Hailing the role of Sardar Patel in uniting the country’s 562 princely states into one nation as Independent India’s first home minister, Shah said it is unfortunate that after his demise, the opposition left no stone unturned to erase his legacy. “He was awarded the Bharat Ratna after a delay of 41 years and no monument was built in his honour. It was only when Shri Narendra Modi became the chief minister of Gujarat that he conceptualised the Statue of Unity,” he said adding that Ekta Nagar is now an attractive tourist destination with 14 added attractions like the Valley of Flowers, Ekta Nagar Township, Lake Circuit, Light and Sound Show, Patel Garden, Ekta Cruise, Butterfly Garden, Jungle Safari, Ekta Mall and the Glow Torch Viewpoint.","This year being the 150th birth anniversary of Sardar Patel, the Rashtriya Ekta Diwas parade will get grander.

Drake Maye’s breakout season keeps Patriots soaring



Drake Maye has been the heartbeat of the New England Patriots this season, guiding the team to a commanding 6-2 start and first place in the AFC East. As the young quarterback continues to impress on the field, his wife, Ann Maye, has been making waves of her own — this time with a striking rainy-day outfit that had fans talking before Sunday’s home clash against the Atlanta Falcons.While Drake has been delivering highlight moments for New England, Ann has been winning hearts in her own way. Known for her stunning game-day fits — from her custom “10” Maye jersey to her all-Patriots-blue look — she has become a fan favorite. On a recent rainy Thursday, Ann showed off a chic workout look while hitting the gym, sharing a mirror selfie that quickly grabbed attention online.The couple’s love story runs deep. Both attended UNC, where Ann’s brother Tad even played quarterback alongside Drake. Their connection dates back to middle school, and after years together, they tied the knot in June 2025.As New England prepares for a crucial Week 9 showdown, fans are not just eager to see how Maye performs — they’re also curious about what Ann will wear next. One thing’s certain: whether on the field or off it, the Mayes are becoming one of the NFL ’s most captivating power couples.Maye’s sophomore NFL campaign has been nothing short of electric.Through eight games, the 23-year-old quarterback has thrown for 2,026 yards, 15 touchdowns, and just three interceptions, displaying poise beyond his years. His leadership and accuracy have turned New England into one of the most exciting teams to watch in the league.Even rival coaches can’t help but acknowledge his talent. After Wednesday’s practice, Falcons defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich admitted, “He’s way better than I want him to be. He feels like a younger Josh Allen .” That comparison says a lot, considering Allen is the reigning league MVP.Maye’s journey from the No. 3 overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft to one of the league’s most promising stars has silenced those who once questioned his readiness. Coming out of North Carolina, where he starred for the Tar Heels, many thought he lacked experience. But week after week, Maye continues to prove that he belongs among the NFL’s elite.Also Read: Isiah Pacheco’s family life: Meet his siblings Travoise, Ricky, Felicia, and Celeste who shaped his journey","Ann and Drake Maye are one of the NFL’s most captivating power couples.

Focus shifts back to football as Travis Kelce continues rewriting Chiefs history

Kansas City Chiefs star tight end Travis Kelce once again proved his dominance on the field Monday night, but it wasn’t his 99-yard, six-catch performance or his 83rd career touchdown that had fans talking, it was what he did before kickoff.In the Chiefs’ 28–7 win over the Washington Commanders, cameras caught Kelce during the national anthem bouncing lightly on his feet, moving his hands, and placing one over his heart, all while quarterback Patrick Mahomes stood motionless with his hands behind his back. The contrast immediately went viral, sparking criticism from viewers who felt the moment showed a lack of respect.Social media filled with posts labeling the star tight end “classless” and “disrespectful.” One fan wrote, “Kelce needs to be more respectful,” while others accused him of craving attention in a solemn moment. But not everyone saw it that way. Many defended Kelce, noting his high-energy personality and game-day intensity. One user even joked, “Explains why he got kicked out of pre-school. I'm 100000% confident he was quite the handful. ”For some, it was simply a snapshot of an emotional athlete channeling adrenaline before game time, not an act of defiance.Despite the noise, Kelce’s teammates and coaches made it clear his focus remains on football. After the win, Mahomes praised him, saying, “He’s what the Chiefs represent... the guy that's been here... helped set the culture of what it means to play for Coach [Andy] Reid and for Kansas City.”Kelce, meanwhile, stayed grounded, crediting the team and his love for Arrowhead Stadium: “I just cherish these moments... being able to play at Arrowhead. This place is special, and I love it here. In terms of the historical stuff, I'm still looking at the next game and the next catch and trying to get better.”While the national anthem debate continues to divide fans, Kelce’s record-tying touchdown, matching franchise legend Priest Holmes, cements his status as one of the greatest in Chiefs history. Whether his pregame energy was misread or misunderstood, one thing remains clear: Travis Kelce’s passion for the game continues to define Kansas City’s championship culture.Also Read: Brittany Mahomes' heartwarming hidden detail in her Chiefs game day outfit proves she’s Patrick Mahomes’ No. 1 cheerleader","Travis Kelce sparked online debate with his energetic actions during the national anthem before a Chiefs game.

But one topic, surprisingly, was completely off-limits: Brady’s 2018 viral “kiss on the lips” moment with his son.Comedian Nikki Glaser, one of the standout performers at The Greatest Roast of All Time: Tom Brady, recently opened up about what didn’t make the final cut. Speaking on the Comedy Bang Bang podcast, Glaser revealed that the roast’s comedians collectively agreed not to make jokes about Brady’s children, especially the infamous 2018 video in which the NFL star kissed his then-11-year-old son on the lips.“We didn’t joke about the kid thing,” Glaser explained. “Like that was a thing that we all chose … like, we’re not gonna make fun of the kid kissing thing, which is truly all I knew about him. I was obsessed with that kid kissing video. I thought it was so fascinating.”She went on to admit that she had originally written “a bunch of jokes about it,” but producers informed her just days before the show that those jokes had to be cut.“You have to lose 30% of that,” she recalled being told. “All of a sudden this big chunk comes out. You feel OK about it, but you’re like, ‘Why did you sign up for this then?’ But also his kids didn’t ask for it.”While Brady took the event in stride, even laughing at jabs about his personal life, he later told The Pivot Podcast that the roast had emotional consequences. “I liked when the jokes were about me. I thought they were so fun,” he said.“I didn’t like the way they affected my kids. It’s the hardest part about … like the bittersweet aspect of when you do something that you think is one way and then all of a sudden you realize: I wouldn’t do that again because of the way that it actually affected the people that I care about the most in the world.”Despite the controversy, The Roast of Tom Brady became one of Netflix’s most-watched comedy specials of the year, proof that even when boundaries are drawn, the GOAT of football still makes for legendary TV.Also Read: “Raise your kids right”: Kylie Kelce draws a clear line for Cowboys fans planning to trick-or-treat at her residence","Tom Brady's Netflix roast was billed as an unfiltered, no-holds-barred look at one of the most accomplished and scrutinized, athletes of all time.

Christian Gonzalez praises Stefon Diggs’ leadership and energy in practice

“He’s a real good leader,” Gonzalez said. “He cares a lot; he just be wanting to compete. He be trying to get up under my skin, tryna tell me certain things to get me going in practice… The media make him out to be a diva, but he ain’t been none of that.”

The “diva” narrative that’s followed Stefon Diggs for years

Looks like Stefon Diggs is flipping the script in New England. After years of being tagged as a “diva,” the veteran receiver is earning praise from one of the Patriots’ most promising young stars, cornerback Christian Gonzalez who says the media got it all wrong. In a recent interview, Gonzalez gave fans a peek at the real Diggs behind the scenes, calling him a leader, a motivator, and anything but the drama magnet people think he is.During a chat with NESN, Christian Gonzalez couldn’t have been clearer: Stefon Diggs isn’t the troublemaker the headlines make him out to be.It’s the kind of endorsement that means something coming from Gonzalez, a rising defensive star who lines up against Diggs every day in practice. For him to highlight Diggs’ competitive fire instead of conflict says plenty about how the veteran is fitting into his new environment.According to those around the team, Diggs’ voice has become one of the louder ones in the locker room in a good way. He’s been pushing the younger guys, setting the tempo, and making sure practices feel like game day.Diggs has had a complicated reputation. From his trade out of Minnesota to his public frustration during his final stretch with the Buffalo Bills, he’s been painted as overly emotional, difficult, and dramatic. Clips of sideline arguments and viral quotes didn’t help either.But Gonzalez’s words cut through all that noise. Instead of the so-called diva, he describes a version of Diggs who thrives on competition and pushes his teammates to get better. For the Patriots, that’s exactly the kind of fire they’ve been missing and maybe exactly what Diggs needed too.When Diggs landed in New England, critics questioned whether he’d mesh with the Patriots’ famously no-nonsense culture. But early signs suggest it’s working. Under head coach Jerod Mayo, the team’s tone has shifted- a little looser, a little more player-driven, and apparently a perfect fit for Diggs’ leadership style.Christian Gonzalez’s comments might just change how fans talk about Stefon Diggs this season. If the young corner’s words are anything to go by, Diggs isn’t the diva, he’s the standard-setter.Also read - Did Stefon Diggs get Crystal Westbrooks pregnant?

How Malik Washington became the Dolphins’ unexpected X-factor just in time for a crucial Week 9 test,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/how-malik-washington-became-the-dolphins-unexpected-x-factor-just-in-time-for-a-crucial-week-9-test/articleshow/124977137.cms,"Malik Washington's role in Dolphins (Imagn Images)

Malik Washington’s growing influence in Miami’s offense



Malik Washington’s path from reliability to breakout potential



Under the bright lights of Thursday Night Football, the Miami Dolphins find themselves facing one of their biggest challenges of the season — a ruthless Baltimore defense and sky-high expectations. Amid the star power of Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle, a new name is quietly making waves: Malik Washington. The rookie wideout, once a sixth-round long shot, has been earning trust through precision and poise. Now, as Miami hunts for consistency in its playoff push, Washington’s understated brilliance might be the edge that changes everything.Since late September, Miami has been reshaping its offensive rhythm, redistributing targets to fill the gaps in a thinned receiver room. Malik Washington, a sixth-round pick in 2024, has quietly become a trusted piece in that puzzle. He’s recorded five or more targets in four consecutive games, including a career-high in looks two weeks ago and his first professional touchdown last weekend.The Dolphins’ coaching staff now trusts him on quick-game staples like sticks, speed-outs, and choice routes, as well as pre-snap motions that help diagnose coverage.On film, Washington consistently displays traits that separate him from typical rookies. As a zone beater, he finds soft spots within 6–10 yards. His yards-after-catch ability comes not from brute force but from sharp angles and balance, allowing him to finish plays forward and keep Miami ahead of schedule.Then there’s his timing with Tua Tagovailoa . The connection between the two has grown, with the quarterback delivering on anticipation throws and Washington winning early in his routes. Against a Baltimore defense that thrives on tight man coverage and match-zone concepts, that precision and timing will be critical. When the deep shots are limited, it’s Washington’s ability to win early and convert third downs that could keep drives alive.Washington entered the league known for his route discipline, toughness across the middle, and high-end college production. His early Miami journey—from practice squad duties to carving out a role in the rotation—speaks to how much the Dolphins value reliability and timing over raw athleticism. The next steps in his development are clear: beating press coverage more consistently, layering routes for deeper gains, and perfecting his blocking angles to remain a fixture in all formations.In a league obsessed with highlight plays, Malik Washington is earning his place through the subtler details—clean routes, precise spacing, and dependable hands. Against Baltimore, those traits could quietly tilt the game Miami’s way. If the Dolphins succeed by moving the chains through rhythm and efficiency rather than pure explosiveness, Washington might just be the unsung difference-maker everyone notices by the final whistle.Also Read: Isiah Pacheco’s family life: Meet his siblings Travoise, Ricky, Felicia, and Celeste who shaped his journey","Rookie wideout Malik Washington is quietly making waves for the Miami Dolphins.

And then once they did, it was all in.”According to Randi, Brittany had been part of their family long before fame and Super Bowl rings entered the picture. “I think he was a sophomore or junior, it was all in.

I’ve kind of helped, maybe not raise her, but she grew up with Patrick and was always around.We’ve always been very close. ”Randi also shared that even during Patrick’s college years, Brittany made an effort to stay close to the family. “She’ll call me — we’ll keep in touch, especially when he was in college. And we would always hang out whenever he came home,” Randi revealed.Today, Brittany is a constant presence not only in Patrick’s life but also in the Kansas City Chiefs’ stands, cheering alongside Randi and their two children, Sterling and Bronze.

When is Chet Holmgren Expected to Recover From His Ongoing Injury?

, for tonight’s matchup against the Washington Wizards on October 31, 2025. The 21-year-old center has been officially ruled out due to lower back soreness, as confirmed in the Thunder’s injury report released on October 30.Chet Holmgren has been dealing with discomfort in his lower back since the Thunder’s recent victory over the Dallas Mavericks on October 27. In that game, the young big man delivered an impressive performance, putting up 18 points, 11 rebounds, and shooting an efficient 60% from the field. Following the win, he was held out of the second game of the Thunder’s back-to-back against the Sacramento Kings to recover.Despite Holmgren’s absence, the Thunder secured a 107-101 win over Sacramento, demonstrating their depth and adaptability. However, the matchup against the Wizards will mark the second consecutive game that Holmgren misses due to the lingering soreness.Even without Chet Holmgren, Oklahoma City has continued its remarkable start to the 2025–26 NBA season, entering the contest with a perfect 5-0 record. The team’s success has been fueled by outstanding performances from Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and rookie guard Ajay Mitchell, who have stepped up to maintain the Thunder’s momentum on both ends of the floor.Holmgren’s absence will be felt, as he has been off to one of the best starts of his young career. Through five games this season, he has averaged 23 points, 10 rebounds, and approximately 2.6 combined steals and blocks per game. His growth as a two-way player has been a major storyline for the Thunder, showing maturity and confidence since returning from a hip injury that kept him sidelined for much of the previous season.In Chet Holmgren’s absence, the Thunder are expected to continue leaning into a small-ball strategy. Isaiah Hartenstein will take on more frontcourt responsibilities, while the team will emphasize perimeter shooting and transition play to maintain its offensive rhythm.While Holmgren’s lower back issue is being closely monitored, the Thunder are optimistic it is only a minor setback and unrelated to his past injuries. The team is hopeful that he could make his return as early as November 2, when Oklahoma City faces the New Orleans Pelicans.The Thunder are dealing with several other injuries besides Holmgren’s. Jalen Williams and Isaiah Joe remain sidelined, but there’s a positive update as veteran guard Alex Caruso has cleared concussion protocols and is set to return to the rotation.Their upcoming opponent, the Washington Wizards, has struggled to find consistency early in the season. This game presents an opportunity for Oklahoma City to test its depth once again, as the team aims to remain unbeaten even without its key interior presence.Chet Holmgren’s back soreness comes at a time when he has been delivering dominant performances and establishing himself as a cornerstone for the Thunder’s future. While fans are disappointed to see his explosive start paused, the organization is prioritizing long-term health and ensuring that the young center returns only when fully recovered.Also read: Is LaMelo Ball playing tonight vs the Orlando Magic?

LaMelo Ball gets $35k fine after game against Miami Heat



Charlotte Hornets have gone the middle way

The last match between the Charlotte Hornets and the Miami Heat on October 28, saw the latter win the game 144 to 117. It also saw Hornets star LaMelo Ball showing his middle finger to the referee after getting called for a foul. The ""obscene gesture"" was made during the final few minutes of the game, and the player's frustration with his team's performance and getting called for a foul led to him flipping the referee. And now, he has been fined a pretty good amount.In the last few minutes of the game between the Charlotte Hornets and the Miami Heat, the visiting team somewhat knew the game was gone from their hands. In their frustration, LaMelo Ball accidentally kicked the ball at Heat star Davion Mitchell's face. He got called for an offensive foul and received a technical foul for his actions.Adding to an already frustrating result, getting a foul was not the best combination - and Ball ended up flipping the referee off. Now, the league has put a fine of $35,000 on him, which he will have to pay. He scored 20 points during the game, best from the Hornets, but with Bam Abadeyo and Aaron Wiggins leading the Heat with 26 and 21 points respectively, they had no chance.Not the best start to their 2025-26 season, but this is also not the worst for them, as the Charlotte Hornets go into their match-up against the Orlando Magic tonight on a 2-2 run. LaMelo Ball is their star player, averaging 21.1 points since joining the league back in 2020. He won the NBA Rookie of the Year award in 2021 and was named an NBA All-Star in 2022.But injury spells have let him out of the court for long portions, and his career has not been able to have the lift he had hoped for, especially after such a successful rookie season. Hopefully, things can turn around for him as well as the Hornets as they make a slow but steady turn to their season.Also Read: Will Chet Holmgren play tonight?

A fan tweet questions Taylor Swift’s activism era shift

“Well, ask Taylor Swift. When she was with Joe, she was an activist and preaching about being on the right side of history. After Joe Alwyn? Crashing out on 2 albums about racist Matty and now? Hanging out with MAGAs and SA apologists.”

Taylor Swift’s outspoken activist era set a precedent

Why fans are now questioning her current associations

“Taylor ‘crashed’ history by breaking records no one else dared touch: 14 Grammys, $1B tour, record-breaking album sales, and activism that actually moves the needle. But sure, keep explaining how she ‘crashed’ from behind your keyboard!”

Taylor Swift’s fandom is once again at war with itself this time not over setlists or surprise songs, but over her supposed “political glow-down.” A viral post on X called out the singer for allegedly drifting away from the activist persona she embraced during her Joe Alwyn era, when she proudly spoke about being “on the right side of history.” The comment quickly spread, with fans split down the middle, some claiming Taylor’s gone soft on social issues, others insisting she doesn’t owe anyone a political performance.The tweet that lit up SwiftTok and X timelines didn’t hold back:The post snowballed into a larger online debate about whether Taylor has “changed” her activism stance or whether fans are just reading too much into her relationships.Back in 2018–2020, Taylor Swift publicly stepped into the political arena after years of silence. In herdocumentary, she tearfully discussed the importance of using her platform responsibly and endorsed Democratic candidates in Tennessee. She even shared voter registration links, which led to aspike of over 65,000 new sign-ups in a single day.That period became known as her “activist era,” and it reshaped her image, from America’s sweetheart to a bold, politically conscious artist. Fans admired her courage, and for many, that version of Taylor became symbolic of growth, maturity, and empowerment.The criticism mainly stems from Taylor’s current relationship and friendships post Joe Alwyn. Fans say she’s “hanging out with MAGA types” or people accused of enabling problematic behavior ( Patrick Mahomes , Brittany Mahomes).Not everyone’s buying the criticism. Many fans argue that Taylor has already done her part as an activist, registering voters, speaking up for LGBTQ+ rights, and advocating for artists’ ownership.For them, silence isn’t regression, it’s just a choice to keep her personal life separate from public discourse.Also read - Michael Strahan gets emotional celebrating his twin daughters’ 21st birthday after cancer fight","Taylor Swift’s fandom is once again at war with itself over her supposed “political glow-down.” A viral post on X called out the singer for allegedly drifting away from the activist persona she embraced during her Joe Alwyn era.

The San Antonio Spurs' season-opening night was fantastic. Like most things, it revolved around Victor Wembanyama. He was outstanding in a 40-point performance that helped the Dallas Mavericks lose handily. However, due to serious injury concerns, the Miami Heat and the San Antonio Spurs will now play each other very cautiously on Thursday at Frost Bank Centre. Unfortunately, De'Aaron Fox will not be participating.Both the Miami Heat and the San Antonio Spurs have serious injury worries. Tyler Herro will not be playing for Miami due to a left ankle injury that will require surgery. Then due to a right groin strain, rookie Kasparas Jakucionis is also sidelined, and Norman Powell is labelled as doubtful. Terry Rozier is on unpaid leave due to a federal gambling investigation, and Nikola Jovic is still questionable due to a right hip injury. Meanwhile, De'Aaron Fox isn't playing for the Spurs.Fox is sidelined due to an injury. He suffered a hamstring injury during training camp, which he is currently recovering from. Dylan Harper, the No. 2 overall pick, and Stephon Castle saw much more playing time in the backcourt when Fox was benched. Additionally, it also gave Devin Vassell additional minutes.Due to the injury, De'Aaron Fox has missed the first four games . Before Spurs head coach Mitch Johnson reminded everyone that it's just October.He further implied that the team is probably going to take a cautious approach with Fox.The Spurs have not provided a clear schedule for Fox's comeback. It can take some time for a quick point guard like Fox to recover fully from a torn right hamstring. The Spurs will have to continue without Fox for the time being. Stephon Castle will probably continue to play point guard for the Spurs.The Spurs have had a fantastic start to the season, winning their first three games and defeating the Brooklyn Nets on Sunday. Victor Wembanyama led the team to win on Sunday, finishing with 31 points, 14 rebounds, and six blocks. Rookie Dylan Harper contributed 20 points, six rebounds, and eight assists off the bench.They will now take on the Raptors in an attempt to maintain their winning streak. On the other hand, De'Aaron Fox and Luke Kornet are among the five players on the Spurs' injury report. Due to a hamstring strain that has forced him out of San Antonio's opening three games of the season, Fox will not play for the time being.Also read: Is Cam Thomas playing?

Cleveland Cavaliers vs Boston Celtics Matchup Outlook (October 29, 2025)

What to Watch for in Tonight's Cleveland Cavaliers vs Boston Celtics Matchup?

Theare set to clash in a high-stakes regular-season showdown on October 29, 2025, at TD Garden in Boston. Both Eastern Conference contenders are dealing with crucial injuries that could heavily influence the outcome of this early-season matchup. Cleveland Cavaliers enter the contest with several key players sidelined. Star point guard Darius Garland remains unavailable as he continues to recover from surgery on his left great toe. Shooting guard Max Strus is also out of action, still rehabilitating from a Jones fracture in his left foot that required surgical repair. Adding to the Cavaliers’ injury woes, Sam Merrill has been ruled out after sustaining a right hip contusion in a collision with teammate Evan Mobley.These absences have forced head coach J.B. Bickerstaff to rely more heavily on his bench and recent addition Lonzo Ball, who has stepped into Garland’s role at point guard. Despite their injury setbacks, the Cavaliers have impressed early in the season, holding a 3-1 record and riding a three-game winning streak. Their ability to remain competitive without key starters underscores the team’s growing depth and resilience.The Boston Celtics , too, are managing their share of health concerns. Franchise cornerstone Jayson Tatum remains sidelined after undergoing surgery to repair his right Achilles and is not expected to return until he’s fully cleared by medical staff. Meanwhile, Jaylen Brown is listed as “probable” as he continues to manage a left hamstring strain that has nagged him since opening night. Though limited, Brown has continued to suit up in every game so far, demonstrating grit and consistency - including his solid 15-point, 7-rebound showing in the team’s 122-90 season-opening victory over the New Orleans Pelicans.Boston Celtics’ depth will be tested again, as players like Derrick White, Jrue Holiday, and Kristaps Porziņģis will be expected to shoulder additional scoring and defensive duties in Tatum’s absence. The Celtics currently sit at 1-3 and are looking to build momentum with a statement win at home.The injuries on both sides set the stage for an intriguing battle centered around adaptability and depth. The Cavaliers, buoyed by their strong start and improved chemistry, will look to continue their winning run on the road. With Lonzo Ball orchestrating the offense alongside a healthy frontcourt featuring Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen, Cleveland has the tools to pose a serious challenge to the Celtics.Boston, on the other hand, will rely heavily on Brown’s presence and the team’s collective effort to make up for Tatum’s scoring void. Head coach Joe Mazzulla will need to deploy creative rotations and balanced scoring to counter Cleveland’s size and physical play inside the paint.• Lonzo Ball’s performance as the primary playmaker in Garland’s absence.• Jaylen Brown’s agility and offensive rhythm as he continues to recover from a hamstring strain.• The Celtics’ secondary scorers and their ability to step up without Tatum.• The interior matchup between Evan Mobley, Jarrett Allen, and Boston’s frontcourt rotation.The October 29 meeting between the Cleveland Cavaliers and Boston Celtics promises to be a compelling contest defined by strategy, resilience, and adaptability. Both teams are navigating early-season adversity, but their depth and competitiveness should ensure an exciting night for fans at TD Garden.While injuries have reshaped both lineups, the clash serves as a testament to the physical demands of the NBA and the determination of two Eastern Conference powerhouses striving to stay in contention. Expect an intense and tactical battle as both sides look to prove their mettle early in the 2025-26 campaign.","Cleveland Cavaliers and Boston Celtics set to clash in a regular-season showdown on October 29, 2025.

Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank has long been known for his impact on the field and in the community — but his latest act of generosity reaches far beyond football. In response to the devastation caused by Hurricane Melissa, Blank has pledged a massive $2.5 million through the Arthur M. Blank Family Foundation to help support recovery efforts across the Caribbean.Hurricane Melissa tore through the Caribbean earlier this month, leaving widespread devastation in its wake. The storm first hit Jamaica as a powerful Category 5 hurricane, bringing winds close to 185 mph. Homes were destroyed, neighborhoods flooded, and hundreds of thousands lost power. Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness declared the island a disaster area as rescuers struggled to reach the hardest-hit communities. After pounding Jamaica, the hurricane moved north toward Cuba, where it made landfall as a Category 3 storm and caused even more destruction. Early assessments show that the damage is severe, and recovery will likely take years as families rebuild and essential services are restored.To help provide food, water, and medical aid to those affected, Arthur Blank’s foundation is donating $2.5 million to two major relief organizations.World Central Kitchen will receive $1.5 million to serve meals and deliver clean water to people displaced by the storm. Team Rubicon will get $1 million to help clear debris, respond to emergencies, and begin rebuilding efforts. This isn’t the first time Blank has stepped up to help communities in need, but this donation feels especially personal. He’s said that the Caribbean holds a special place in his family’s heart, making the devastation from Hurricane Melissa hit even closer to home.“We're humbled to support Team Rubicon and World Central Kitchen with an initial grant to help address immediate needs in the community with disaster relief and nourishing meals,” Blank said. He added that while the recovery will take time, he hopes the contribution offers strength and comfort to those affected.The Falcons owner’s quick action has drawn widespread praise from humanitarian groups. Many have highlighted Blank’s willingness to use his platform to make a real impact — not just in Atlanta, but around the world.As rebuilding efforts begin in Jamaica, Cuba, and neighboring islands, Blank’s donation stands as a reminder that leadership in the NFL can reach far beyond the sidelines — and that compassion, when paired with action, can help spark hope after even the darkest storms.","Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank has donated $2.5 million to Hurricane Melissa relief.

Stefon Diggs cheating on Cardi B speculations and rumors

On July 8, Dov Kleiman shared an X post with the caption, “𝗥𝗨𝗠𝗢𝗥𝗦: Patriots star WR Stefon Diggs allegedly cheated on Cardi B, which caused Cardi to delete all her photos with Stefon Diggs from her Instagram. The relationship lasted just over 2 months 💔 The breakup is trending upward on @polymarketsport.” On July 7, TMZ STAFF reported signs of trouble during the couple’s yacht outing, as a video surfaced on X showing Stefon talking to a bunch of cute young women on the same boat. Back then Cardi B had wiped her Instagram clean of any evidence of Stefon and offered a cryptic message to her fans, saying, “sooo tired.”

On September 18, an X account by the name of STUNNER shared a TMZ Sports report titled, “Congratulations to Cardi B, who announced that she is PREGNANT with Stefon Diggs’ baby!” The X post’ caption read, “From wife to baby mama. Left her cheating husband to go be a baby mama to a cheating man.

Recently, there have been rumors and speculation about New England Patriots star wide receiver Stefon Diggs cheating on Cardi B . Cardi B, a 32-year-old Grammy-winner and American rapper, has a history of being cheated on by her former husband, Offset, multiple times over many years. She also has a history of staying with a partner even after they cheated.In December 2019, Cardi B spoke to Vogue about Offset's infidelity, an interview that Brittney McNamara of Teen Vogue later reported on. Regarding her decision to stay with Offset, Cardi B said, “When me and my husband (Offset) got into our issues—you know, he cheated and everything—and I decided to stay with him and work together with him, a lot of people were so mad at me. A lot of women felt disappointed in me.”Back in December 2019, when Cardi B was married to Offset, he cheated on her. But her thoughts on cheating included “Till Death Do Us Part,” forgiveness, praying, understanding, and monogamy.“Everybody on social media acts like relationships is perfect,” Cardi said. “And that’s crazy to me. I’m around so many women, and there’s always a woman talking about how she loves her man, but her man is not financially stable, or she has a problem with his mom, or the s*x is not as good anymore.”“Everybody has issues. I believe in forgiveness. I prayed on it. Me and my husband (Offset)...we prayed on it. We had priests come to us. And we just came to an understanding like, bro, it’s really us against the world. He has my back for everything. I have his back for everything,” Cardi said. “So when you cheat, you’re betraying the person that has your back the most. Why would you do that? We have come to a clear understanding. For me, monogamy is the only way. I’ll beat your as* if you cheat on me.”“When me and my husband (Offset) got into our issues—you know, he cheated and everything—and I decided to stay with him and work together with him, a lot of people were so mad at me. A lot of women felt disappointed in me,” Cardi said. “But it’s a real-life sh*t. If you love somebody and you stop being with them, and you’re depressed and social media is telling you not to talk to that person because he cheated, you’re not really happy on the inside until you have the conversation. Then, if you get back with them, it’s like, how could you? You let all of us down.”“People that be in marriages for years,” she said. “When they say till death do us part, they not talking about little arguments like if you leave the fridge open. That’s including everything.”And as for Cardi B? She has filled her Instagram Stories with reposts of various renowned women like Elaine Welteroth, Jalessa Dejesus, Tana Whaitiri Kingi, Nadia Nakai, Draya Michele, and Gabrielle Union-Wade dancing and lip-syncing to her new album AM I THE DRAMA?

Two weeks into ESPN’s “Inside The NBA” show, after transitioning from TNT Sports, the crew–Ernie Johnson Jr., Charles Barkley , Shaquille O’Neal, and Kenny Smith–couldn’t prevent themselves from talking about another league: the National Football League, everyone. From a subtle jab at Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones to criticizing the NFL ’s worst-ranked defense, the crew knew where it would supposedly hurt the most.American sportscaster Ernie Johnson Jr. shared that it had been two weeks into ESPN’s “Inside The NBA” show, and they had not mentioned the Dallas Cowboys: “This is our second week on ESPN, and we still haven’t talked about the Cowboys.” Johnson Jr. said. “Isn’t that amazing?”The 11-time NBA All-Star Charles Barkley then added that they had a contractual obligation to talk about the Cowboys every day—even when their defense couldn't stop any opponent. Well, you know, they have a contractually obligated to talk about the Cowboys every day,” Barkley said. “Even though their defense can’t stop a bloody nose.”Shaquille O’Neal further jabbed at the Cowboys, saying, “That’s the Cowboys team. They are off the Cowboys.” Barkley interrupted O’Neal, screaming, “Stop people from scoring! Don’t trade your best defensive player and then whine about you can’t stop anybody!” —subtly hinting at former Dallas Cowboys defensive end Micah Parsons, who was traded to the Green Bay Packers before the 2025 season began.And now the Cowboys’ defense ranks last in the NFL, a significant change after Parsons’ trade.One fan was very happy about the crossover, writing, “Who let the cowboys sneak into the nba convo tonight 😂🔥.” Another fan mentioned Skip Bayless, a formerly devoted Dallas Cowboys fan who is now a Philadelphia Eagles fan: “Skip hasn't been at ESPN in nearly 10 years and his influence still reigns.” A third user called it an ideal crossover, saying, “Classic, nothing gets more reactions than talking Cowboys on Inside The NBA. Fans either cheer, cringe, or start a full-blown debate in the comments instantly. 😂.” Another mentioned Stephen A. Smith: “ESPN and the Cowboys. Shoutout to Stephen A. Smith. 😂.”","Charles Barkley, Ernie Johnson Jr., Shaquille O’Neal, and Kenny Smith were talking about the NFL on ESPN’s “Inside The NBA” The crew couldn’t prevent themselves from talking about another league: the National Football League.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124951614,imgsize-49976,width-400,resizemode-4/nfl-jerry-charles.jpg"

San Antonio Spurs vs Miami Heat - Game Prediction

At the beginning of the NBA season, the San Antonio Spurs have looked incredible. Even in the preseason, when they won all four of their games, there were signs of their growth. In contrast, the Miami Heat's appearance is very different from what the fans have seen in recent years. They didn't win any of their six preseason games, which was a worrying start to their problems. They are now prepared to face the San Antonio Spurs (4-0) on Thursday, October 30.The Spurs are preparing to play the Miami Heat (3-1) on Thursday, October 30 at Frost Bank Centre in San Antonio, Texas. The game will begin at 8:30 p.m. ET. The entire match will be available for viewing on FDSSUN and FDSSW.The Spurs are 4-0 going into Thursday's game, but they will be missing a number of important players. Luke Kornet is out due to a sprained left ankle, and De'Aaron Fox is out due to a strained right hamstring. Additionally, Jeremy Sochan has a sprained left wrist, Lindy Waters III is out after a bilateral eye procedure, and Kelly Olynyk is recovering from surgery on his left heel.The Heats are also dealing with a lot of injuries . Terry Rozier, Tyler Herro, and Kasparas Jakucionis are out, and Nikola Jovic and Norman Powell are questionable.Tyler Herro will not be playing for Miami due to a left ankle injury that will require surgery.Furthermore, due to a right groin strain, rookie Kasparas Jakucionis is also sidelined, and Norman Powell is labelled as doubtful. Terry Rozier is on unpaid leave due to a federal gambling investigation, and Nikola Jovic is still questionable due to a right hip injury.San Antonio finished 23rd on defense and 16th on offence in the NBA last season.

Finally, with 12.8 forced turnovers per game, they came in at number 20.Compared to its opponents, the San Antonio Spurs have rested far more.

Joey Chestnut crushes IShowSpeed in hilarious hot dog showdown on Speed Goes Pro

SPEED GOES PRO, EPISODE 3: JOEY CHESTNUT (Competitive eating)

A Look Back at the Pros IShowSpeed Has Faced So Far

Speed Goes Pro





In the latest chapter of his ambitious new series, IShowSpeed ventures into uncharted territory: competitive eating. Episode 3 of his YouTube show Speed Goes Pro, released on October 29, showcases Speed prepping for a showdown with the greatest in the game, Joey Chestnut. With production by OBB Media and sponsorship from Dick’s Sporting Goods, the episode is both entertaining and surprisingly informative, blending celeb-level training with quirky self-discovery.IShowSpeed may have the energy, the fans, and the fire to take on almost anything, but even he couldn’t handle the legend that is Joey Chestnut. In the latest episode of Speed Goes Pro, Speed went head-to-head with the 17-time Mustard Belt holder in an all-out hot dog eating challenge, and the results were both impressive and hilarious.Before they squared off, Speed tried to earn a little extra help by going through a series of “mini challenges” inspired by Chestnut’s record-breaking feats. From scarfing down pizza and chicken wings to powering through hard-boiled eggs, Speed gave it his all. His determination paid off, ‘sort of’ as he secured a two-minute head start before Chestnut even touched his first hot dog.But as it turns out, two minutes isn’t nearly enough of a cushion against the greatest eater alive.Speed managed to down five hot dogs in three minutes, while Chestnut devoured 11 in just one minute, barely breaking a sweat. The look of disbelief on Speed’s face said it all. Despite the domination, Chestnut showed class and humor throughout the friendly contest. “Winning is awesome,” he said afterwards, smiling as he accepted his latest unofficial victory.Ahead of facing Joey Chestnut, who holds an astounding 55 world records across as many competitive-eating disciplines and has claimed the Mustard Yellow Belt seventeen times, Speed’s journey mirrors an athlete’s preparation rather than a streamer’s prank. In his first two episodes, he trained with NFL legend Tom Brady for football and Olympic gold-medalist Suni Lee for gymnastics.For Speed, this newest episode was another entertaining chapter in his quest to “go pro” across the most unexpected arenas. And while it’s safe to say he won’t be showing up at Coney Island anytime soon, his effort and his comedic timing made for a memorable showdown that fans won’t forget anytime soon. With each new episode,continues to blend athletic excellence with pure entertainment, proving that even when Speed loses, the audience wins.Also read: From streaming chaos to IMDB glory: IShowSpeed dethrones Leonardo DiCaprio on top trending celeb list",IShowSpeed goes head-to-head with Joey Chestnut in latest episode of his YouTube show Speed Goes Pro.

She explained that her demeanor towards her son hasn’t changed, and she doesn’t plan on changing it for Swift, the billionaire sensational singer.

In the clip, Swift kisses Kelce, and Jason Kelce reacts with “Oh my gosh!” while Swift shyly chuckles.Randi Martin shared in the video that after seeing Swift’s involvement with her own family, including her children—Patrick and Brittany —and her grandchildren—Sterling Skye, Bronze, and Golden Raye—she couldn’t stop herself from loving Swift. “She’s been, you know, a perfect, sweet person that has embraced my family, my children, my grandkids, and so, I mean,” Randi shared. “I couldn’t not love her.”While it’s common to feel awkward around celebrities, Randi Mahomes is now so familiar with Taylor Swift that it may be challenging for her to treat the singer like a superstar instead of a family acquaintance. “She’s very nice, very genuine from what I see and from what I’ve learned and gotten to know,” Randi said.“And I just knew from Day 1 that I didn’t meet her, and it’s kind of hard for me to look at Patrick because he’s my son, to know that people get excited about meeting him, it’s still like, ‘Okay, you’re still my son. I don’t look at you that way.’ So, I wanted to be able to treat Taylor or anyone else that came involved just as normal as I would treat or be with anybody. Still, I know I definitely had taught myself that I’m just gonna be the same.

STAMMERTIME: Every Steven Stamkos Goal From 24-25 Season

Steven Stamkos faces uncertainty with the Nashville Predators



The Carolina Hurricanes could offer a Stanley Cup opportunity



Los Angeles Kings and Toronto Maple Leafs emerge as trade fits



The Nashville Predators’ slow start has reignited speculation about Steven Stamkos’ future. After signing a four-year, $32 million contract in 2024, the 35-year-old forward was expected to lift a young roster. However, through 11 games this season, he has managed just one goal and two points, a disappointing follow-up to last year’s 27-goal campaign.The Predators’ 4-5-2 record has only fueled trade chatter. Stamkos, who has a full no-move clause, controls his fate. But with Nashville struggling and his window to win another championship closing, discussions about a potential change of scenery have already begun.The Carolina Hurricanes stand out as an ideal fit. With $9 million in cap space and a strong playoff-ready roster, they could absorb Stamkos’ $8 million cap hit. Playing alongside Sebastian Aho and Andrei Svechnikov would immediately boost Carolina’s offensive power. While giving Stamkos another legitimate shot at a championship.For Nashville, a deal involving a younger scorer or draft picks could accelerate their rebuild. For Stamkos, it would mean joining a proven contender ready to make another deep postseason run.The Los Angeles Kings also make sense as a landing spot. General manager Ken Holland has built a balanced team with flexibility near the trade deadline, making Stamkos’ contract manageable.California’s lighter pressure and playoff expectations could appeal to the veteran forward.Meanwhile, the Toronto Maple Leafs offer a homecoming opportunity. A Markham, Ontario native, Stamkos could reunite with familiar faces and potentially play alongside Auston Matthews and William Nylander. However, with Toronto’s tight cap situation, any deal would require salary retention from Nashville.For now, Stamkos remains a Predator, but if the team continues to falter, his tenure in Nashville could soon come to an end.Also Read: Latest update on former Anaheim Ducks star Ryan Kesler’s criminal sexual conduct allegations","Nashville Predators' slow start has reignited speculation about Steven Stamkos' future.

Trump vs Xi: The Busan showdown



Round 1: Trump declares victory (again)



Round 2: Xi’s quiet power play



Round 3: Strategy vs showmanship



Round 4: Managed stability, fragile peace



Final score: Optics to Trump, substance to Xi







It takes a certain kind of genius to let Donald Trump take a victory lap, and still walk away holding the trophy. On Thursday, as Trump declared his meeting with Xi Jinping a “12 out of 10” success (because of course he did), the Chinese leader smiled politely, nodded in agreement, and pocketed a handful of US concessions like souvenirs from a diplomatic gift shop.While Trump gushed on Air Force One about “tremendous progress” and future golf-course diplomacy, Xi quietly secured a tariff rollback, suspended port fees, and a reprieve for Chinese tech firms.If this were a game of poker, Trump was busy telling everyone he’d won big, while Xi casually raked in the chips. With his trademark calm and a dash of subtle shade (“the recent twists and turns should be instructive,” he told Trump), Xi showed once again that in the delicate art of letting Trump claim the win while quietly tightening his own grip, China’s leader might just be the true master of the deal.Fresh off his meeting with Xi Jinping, Trump was in full salesman mode. From Air Force One, he called the talks a “12 out of 10” success, announced plans to visit China in April, and told reporters that “a lot of things” had been finalized.For his audience back home, Trump framed it as another “America Wins” moment -- soybeans for farmers, promises to tackle fentanyl, and friendly photo-ops with a “great leader of a great country.”Following the meeting between the two leaders, China’s commerce ministry announced that it would suspend the rare earth export restrictions introduced in October for one year.While Trump grabbed the headlines, Xi walked away with the hard gains. By flexing China’s near-monopoly on rare earths and its control over US agricultural imports, Xi secured tariff reductions, suspended port fees, and a pause on US export restrictions targeting Chinese tech firms.He even extended a tariff truce, all while maintaining the image of calm, rational statesmanship.Trump announced that he would reduce by half the 20% tariffs previously imposed on Chinese goods to pressure Beijing over fentanyl trafficking. The move, he said, lowered overall tariffs on Chinese imports from about 57% to 47%.Meanwhile, China’s commerce ministry confirmed that both sides agreed to extend for another year the tariff truce that was due to expire on November 10.Trump’s strength lied in optics -- dramatic handshakes, bold declarations, and a good headline for Truth Social. Xi, meanwhile, played the long game. Analysts said Beijing pocketed US concessions by exploiting Washington’s lack of clear strategy. “Tactics without a strategy,” as one expert put it, left Trump celebrating moves that effectively restored the pre-tariff status quo. In other words, Xi gave Trump his “win,” but only after resetting the board in China’s favor.""I think it's an approach that can safely be described as tactics without a strategy,"" NYT quoted Jonathan Czin, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who previously analyzed Chinese politics at the CIA saying.""Ostensibly, the goal was to address some of the meaty trade issues that had long bedeviled the relationship. Instead, the PRC side has successfully orchestrated a game of 'whack-a-mole' for the Trump administration,"" Czin added.For now, both sides are enjoying what Beijing calls a “period of managed stability.” Xi even echoed Trump’s “Make America Great Again” rhetoric, playing to his ego while ensuring China’s interests were secured.Yet, the calm could be short-lived, a single new sanction or export ban could unravel the deal. As one analyst quipped, “These are the kinds of truces that look good on paper, until the next tweet.”Trump may have won the spotlight, but Xi emerged with tangible gains. One got the headline; the other got the leverage.While Trump touted “tremendous progress,” the outcomes showed Beijing securing key concessions behind the scenes, leaving Washington with more talk than trade wins.However, with no finalized agreement in place, the durability of the current situation remains uncertain.""Maybe I'm jaded because I've seen this movie too many times, but these are issues that are relatively easy to roll back and also to accuse the other side of bad faith,"" NYT quoted a political science professor Ja Ian Chong saying.","Donald Trump and Xi Jinping met in Busan, South Korea, on Thursday.

Women's World Cup: Greenstone Lobo predicts India's chances

Poll Will India win the World Cup final against South Africa? Yes No

: This has to be right up amongst the finest triumphs in Indian cricket, let alone Indian Women’s cricket.Chasing an imposing target of 339 against the mighty Australia in the second semifinal of the 2025 Women’s ODI World Cup on Thursday at the DY Patil Stadium, India seemed to be sinking slowly when they lost both their openers as pacer Kim Garth scalped Pratika Rawal’s replacement Shafali Verma (10), whose much-touted comeback lasted just five balls, and in-form star batter and vice-captain Smriti Mandhana (24) inside the first 10 overs of their run chase.However, putting her hand up when it mattered the most, local girl Jemimah Rodrigues played the innings of her life, slamming a brilliant 127 not out (134 balls) to guide India to a memorable, improbable five-wicket win over seven-time champions Australia with nine balls to spare.It was her maiden World Cup hundred, and it couldn’t have come at a better time.Riding on her fabulous century, India have made it to the final of the World Cup, where they will play South Africa at the same venue on Sunday, hoping to be inspired by this magical feat and finally achieve their dream of winning a World Cup trophy that is just one step away now.Joining forces with Harmanpreet Kaur (89 from 86balls) when India were 59 for two in the 10th over, Rodrigues put on an epic 167-run partnership in 156 balls for the third wicket with her captain, as the 34,651-strong crowd found its voice back.Once Harman was gone, caught superbly by Ashleigh Gardner off Annabel Sutherland in the 36th over, Rodrigues kept the chase going in the company of Deepti Sharma, Richa Ghosh and finally Amanjot Kaur (15 not out) to take India home.The asking rate was a bit stiff, but Rodrigues added 38 in 34 balls with Deepti, then 46 in 31 balls with Richa, and finally 31* in just 15 balls with Amanjot to seal a famous win for India, which will be remembered for years to come.Steering the biggest chase ever in World Cup history, Rodrigues and the rest of the Indian team showed that this Australian women’s team indeed could be beaten!As soon as Amanjot cut Sophie Molineux for a four to seal India’s miraculous win, All the players rushed from the dugout to celebrate the triumph.Harmanpreet and Jemimah shed tears of joy, which was understandable because few gave India a chance against the seven-time and defending world champions. However, miracles do happen.They got the 'big fish' early as Healy played a Kranti Goud delivery onto her stumps in the sixth over in overcast conditions. However, their joy was short-lived as, launching a stunning counterattack on the Indian bowlers, Litchfield added 155 with Perry for the second wicket to put Australia on top.The 22-year-old-certainly a generational talent, came into this semifinals with only a fifty in her account, but owned the stage here with her third WODI century.Meanwhile, both the teams wore black armbands to mourn the tragic death of 17-year-old Australian cricketer Ben Austin, who lost his life after being struck on the neck while training in the nets at the Ferntree Gully Cricket Club in Melbourne.",India beat Australia by five wickets to reach Women's ODI World Cup final.
