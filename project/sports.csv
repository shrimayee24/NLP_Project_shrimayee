GEORGETOWN: In most parts of the West Indies, the old-fashioned way of walking down the runway to the plane still prevails. It's fun on most days, but at night with the rain lashing down, the walk to take the flight, or to deplane, can get a little tricky.On Tuesday night, a small flight of about 80 people, consisting mostly of people related to the T20 World Cup, landed in Georgetown and were greeted by persistent showers.As the passengers all dashed for the shade, one could see the tall figure of Australian umpire Rod Tucker running alongside. When somebody asked Tucker whether he would be officiating the game, he laughed: ""Well, yes, if it happens"".""If it happens."" That's the operative word on everybody's lips as India get ready to play England in Rohan Kanhai land on Thursday.It's been raining for the last couple of days in Guyana and it didn't stop through the morning on Wednesday. What the locals are hoping is that if it rains on one day, it doesn't on the other. But then, that's clutching at straws, especially when the forecast is as bad as it is for Thursday.Probably the only ones who don't care are the Indian fans who have tickets for the final in Barbados on Saturday but couldn't manage one for the semifinal here. India will make the final if it's a washout because they topped their Super 8 group.The ICC has extended the cut-off time for calling the game off by four hours than what it was earlier, but for all that to happen, the rain has to stop first. ""This is rain time in Guyana, why did they even schedule the game here? That too without a reserve day,"" mused a local in anguish.But the guys who will benefit the most if it keeps raining - the Indian team - are the ones who don't want it to happen this way. The sun came out here after the morning showers on match eve and after India completed a practice session at the quick drying Providence Stadium , captain Rohit Sharma said: ""We are not looking at a curtailed game. When we come tomorrow, we will hope that it is a full game, but if it is so, we will adapt.""This game has a lot riding on emotionally as well for the Indian team because it is their chance to get revenge on a team that had humiliated them in the 2022 T20 World Cup semis. Though the return of Jasprit Bumrah , who missed that World Cup with an injury, has been the single most important change that has happened since then, Rohit insists ""not much has changed"".""We have thought and discussed and thrashed out numerous times what needs to be done. It's about keeping it going,"" the skipper said.Bumrah apart, it's Kuldeep Yadav who has been another superb inclusion once India landed in the West Indies. His quality and guile have been difficult to deal with for most opponents and England shouldn't be any exception.The defending champions, though, have a bit of firepower with the likes of Jos Buttler , Phil Salt and the rest finding some form. They have three spinners - Moeen Ali, Adil Rashid and Liam Livingstone - who can make use of spin-friendly conditions in Guyana, but the biggest England supporter would say that a curtailed game would be their best chance.Man to man, on current form, India are much superior, but if it's a shorter game, many of those things go out of the window. It becomes a bit of a shootout and with rain in the air and Messrs Duckworth, Lewis and Stern calling the shots, the toss, too becomes important.India know that they may have to deal with these variables, because that's the nature of the beast these days if it's a 365-day cricket season. Rohit and Co. will believe they are good enough for whatever comes in their way as they look to break their ICC silverware drought.It will be cloudy in Guyana on Thursday with 75% probability of rain. While forecast for match hours are slightly better, if it rains heavily before the starts, it can have an impact. With an inefficient stadium drainage system, many hours could be lost.There is no reserve day for this game. However, play can extend to 4 hours and 10 minutes to complete the game. India advance in case of a washout.Providence Stadium is a spinner's haven with low, sharp turn on offer. Spinners have conceded less than 7 runs per over here in recent times, good news for India's spin troika - Kuldeep, Axar and Jadeja. England too boast of Moeen Ali, Adil Rashid and Liam Livingstone in their ranks for this day game.In the previous WC game here, West Indies struggled to chase down PNG's 137, with the variable bounce raising eyebrows. Don't expect the ball to come on to the bat and expect the surface to play a few tricks.This is precisely what India didn't do in Adelaide last time around. If Rohit Sharma can reprise his heroics against Australia, India will be home free.On paper, England have more six-hitters in the lineup but India's middle order enforcers like Suryakumar Yadav , Rishabh Pant and Shivam Dube will worry the England attack.India have been traditionally shaky in knockout rounds. But the current England white-ball dispensation too is under pressure after the failure to defend the ODI World Cup last year.",India face England in T20 World Cup semifinal in Guyana on Thursday. Rain forecast for Guyana with 75% probability of rain. ICC has extended the cut-off time for calling the game off by four hours. India will make the final if it's a washout because they topped their Super 8 group.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111302417,imgsize-55884,width-400,resizemode-4/111302417.jpg"

WATCH VIDEO

Inzamam-ul-Haq had stirred a bit of a controversey when he questioned how India, in particular left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh, managed to reverse-swing the ball in the 16th over of Australia's innings during their 'Super 8's match of the T20 World Cup , and the former Pakistan captain has retorted once again asking India skipper Rohit Sharma to not try to teach him how and when the ball reverse-swings.Replying to a reporter's question about Inzamam's allegations, Rohit rubbished the claims, saying: ""What should I say now about this? You are playing in such hot sun, the wicket is so dry, the ball reverses automatically. It's happening for all the teams, not only ours. All the teams are reverse-swinging. Sometimes, it's important to open your mind.""It's important to understand what conditions you're playing in. The match is not taking place in England or Australia.""Replying to Rohit's remark, Inzamam almost cautioned the India captain to not teach reverse-swing to the originators of the art, Pakistan.""Dimag to hum zarur apna khole lenge,"" said Inzamam on the Pakistan news channel, retoring to Rohit's advice to 'open your mind'.""First thing is that he (Rohit) has admitted that it's happening. So it means what we observed is correct. Second thing, Rohit Sharma ko humein batane ki zarurat nahi padni chahiye kereverse swing kis tarah hota hai, kitni dhoop mei hota hai, kis pitch pe hota hai. Jo sikhane wale hain unko nahi yeh cheez sikhaya karte (there is no need for Rohit to tell us how reverse swing happens, under how much sun, on what pitch; you don't teach something to someone who actually taught it to the world),"" said Inzamam.""Tell him it's not right to talk these things.""Inzamam then clarified that he never said that the Indian team is tampering with the ball. He said his intention was just to alert the umpires.""The reporter asked the wrong question. I gave a suggestion to the umpires, to keep their eyes open because the ball is reverse-swinging in the 15th over. Still my advise to the umpires is the same, keep your eyes open as well as your mind. He (Rohit) just talked about mind, I am saying keep both eyes and mind open,"" said Inzamam.Meanwhile, India went on to defeat England by 68 runs in the second semifinal to book a place in the final, where they will face South Africa.

to be fairer

GEORGETOWN: The wait kept getting longer. The world's eyes were on the weather radar and as the clouds seemed to keep moving away, the smiles were back on the faces of the fans who have been trooping into Guyana from across the United States and other parts of the world. The toss got delayed, the super-soppers were on, but nothing mattered more than the hot sun that was burning in full glory after morning showers.But as the teams got on to the field and started to prepare themselves for a long day, quite a few questions about how the tournament has been scheduled surfaced.To start with, there is no reserve day between games in the knock-out stage, which is beyond belief for anybody who is associated with cricket in this part of the world. To compensate for that, the rule of the tournament was amended at the 11th hour, with two days to go for the match, allowing four hours of extra time.Pakistan, who had been knocked out in Lauderdale because their game could not be started despite a hot sun blazing through the day, are justified to ask a few questions after rules got amended before the semis.While that's one issue, the fact that India knew way before the World Cup started that their semifinal would be played in Guyana has also come up for discussion. India captain Rohit Sharma tried to shut it down saying that ""it's the same for all teams"" and that ""England have enough experience of playing in these conditions"", the theory that India got a bit of unfair advantage cannot be disputed.Former England captain Michael Vaughan didn't mince his words when he said that the T20 World Cup is ""purely set up for India"" and ICC should have been a bit more ""fairer"" to other countries because this is not a bilateral event.""Well, it's their tournament isn't it? Literally it's that. You know that. They get to play whenever they want, they know where their semifinal is, they play every single game in the morning so people can watch them at night, obviously in India on TV,"" Vaughan said during a podcast with Australian great Adam Gilchrist on the YouTube channel Club Prairie Fire.The Ashes-winning captain feels it is purely the financial might of Indian cricket that has led to such a situation. ""I get that money is a big play, and I get that in bilateral series but when you get to a World Cup, the ICC should be a little bit fairer to everybody. There can't be sympathy or any kind of sway towards one team and this tournament is purely set up for India,"" Vaughan said.","Former England captain Michael Vaughan says T20 World Cup is ""purely set up for India"" ICC should have been a bit more ""fairer"" to other countries because this is not a bilateral event, says Vaughan.

The rest, including

Virat Kohli

, don't. With the team expected to stick to the template which has got them this far, one final hurdle now remains against the formidable South Africans. India will hope things fall into place at the Kensington Oval today...

Reserve day for final

BRIDGETOWN (BARBADOS): 'Chokers'.It's a tag that's bound to hurt. With cricket fans, exuberance spills over to anger every time their team loses a knockout game. There's a tendency to forget that a team that comes so close so often must be very good.South Africa have lived with this tag for a very long time and Rohit Sharma 's India would surely hate such a tag with all their heart.Since the 2013 Champions Trophy, success in ICC events has kept eluding India even as they have come agonizingly close time and time again.Many Indian fans had decided that they wouldn't watch cricket anymore after Nov 19, 2023, but such is the lure of the sport that it's impossible to stay away from it for long. The Indian team gives you enough reasons to come back to it, dream again, and hope that better days are around the corner.Kensington Oval on Saturday definitely promises to be one such day. Rohit and Co. came into this World Cup with a steely determination and a concrete plan. They didn't overdo it through the United States leg and the Super-8s, but simply kept at it.Virat Kohli hasn't scored runs. Shivam Dube hasn't quite set the stage on fire. Even the ever-reliable Ravindra Jadeja isn't at his usual best. But the team management is absolutely fixated about a template when it comes to West Indies conditions and it has worked like magic so far.""In the game against Bangladesh, most of us got 20s and 30s. Only one guy (Hardik Pandya) got a half-century. Yet we reached 196. That's the perfect performance for me,"" Rohit had said, and that's exactly what he wants his team to do against South Africa as well.He knows the pitches in West Indies have enough in them in a day game where his spinners Kuldeep Yadav , Axar Patel and Jadeja can keep any batting lineup to below 160. And then of course, there is Jasprit Bumrah . Never in the nine years that he has been playing international cricket has Bumrah looked so unplayable.With 15 off four Bumrah overs becoming par - add to that a couple of wickets - India are virtually turning every match into 18-over contest. Opposition batters are almost obligated to attack the other bowlers to make up for it, and the left-arm spin trio is just too good for that.Despite taking everything into consideration, there is a slight twist to this South Africa tale in the final. Forget the eight wins they have notched up so far. Just like India, South Africa, too, are a bat-first team. Even though they blew apart Afghanistan bowling first in the semis, the strength of the Proteas lies in going berserk at the top, courtesy IPL superstars like Quinton de Kock , Aiden Markram, Heinrich Klaasen, David Miller and a few others.Almost all the teams have been wary of taking first strike against India but this South African bunch will surely bat if they win the toss. The last time that happened was in the game against United States at the Nassau County ground and a chase of 110 didn't look straight-forward for a while.It's almost a given though that India, too, will like to bat first and take South Africa out of the contest. The Proteas pace-attack has a bit of venom to it and it is important that Kohli gets a few runs in this game. ""We understand his class. Form is never a problem when you've played for 15 years. Probably he is saving for the final,"" said Rohit, showing confidence in a long-time colleague.Friday was bright and sunny in Bridgetown but there is a likelihood of thunderstorms on Saturday. In case of a washout, the final will be played on the 'reserve day' Sunday.",India face South Africa in the T20 World Cup final at Kensington Oval. Captain Rohit Sharma's side are looking for their first World Cup win since 2007. South Africa have won all eight of their matches so far.

We know how special he is, so we just have to wait and see what he delivers tomorrow,"" Gayle said during a media conference, according to ANI.Kohli won the Orange Cap at the end of the 2024 Indian Premier League, after amassing an incredible 741 runs at an average of 61.75 and a strike rate of 154.69, including five half-centuries.However, he has been pursuing the ghosts of his past self in the ongoing T20 World Cup. Kohli's IPL statistics stand in stark contrast to his record.Even with all of his expertise, Kohli has unable to consistently produce strong performances when opening with Rohit in seven games. Only 75 runs, with an average of 10.71, have been scored by him during the competition.At the Kensington Oval on Saturday, India will meet South Africa in the final. A reserve day is scheduled in the event that rain prevents the game from happening.","Former West Indies skipper Chris Gayle is not willing to ""write off"" Virat Kohli.

He played an unbeaten 91-run knock in the final. His six over long on off Kulasekara is etched in everybody's mind. That's why I think Virat Kohli has a great chance to become a hero. He must forget that he is in poor form. He had hit a century when India last played South Africa in the ODI World Cup at Eden Gardens. He was brilliant that day and played very well but he wasn't slogging that day but was playing the ball on merit with proper cricket shots.""Kais adds, ""So I think in the final, he should play the ball on merit with proper cricket shots, he should not slog by exposing his wickets, he's a great player. Players like Hardik Pandya, Rohit Sharma and Suryakumar Yadav should play fast and Virat Kohli should play till the end the full 20 overs and the play the ball on merit. He's a big match player and has the chance to become a hero just like Dhoni who was not in form in the 2011 ODI World Cup but when the big match came he played a match-winning unbeaten knock and Virat Kohli can do the same in this match.""Kohli has been dismissed without scoring twice in his worst-ever appearance in six T20 World Cups.India are aiming to end their 11-year trophy drought in global cricket competitions.

'Six months ago he was not even MI captain': Sourav Ganguly backs Rohit Sharma to end India's ICC trophy drought,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/six-months-ago-he-was-not-even-mi-captain-sourav-ganguly-backs-rohit-sharma-to-end-indias-icc-trophy-drought/articleshow/111344625.cms,"India a dominant force by its performance

NEW DELHI: Former Indian skipper Sourav Ganguly praised Rohit Sharma 's captaincy skills on Friday, attributing them to India's undefeated streak in the current T20 World Cup . He encouraged the team to approach the final against South Africa with an unrestrained mindset, aiming to conclude an 11-year drought without an ICC title.The highly anticipated championship match between India and South Africa will take place in Bridgetown, Barbados.The Indian team is determined to secure their first international trophy since their triumphant campaign in the 2013 Champions Trophy.""I'm very happy for Rohit Sharma. Life comes full circle. Six months ago he was not even the captain of Mumbai Indians and the same man is now leading India to a World Cup final, unbeaten,"" Ganguly said, as quoted by PTI, after being roped in as the brand ambassador of Veedol.The former BCCI president Ganguly disclosed that Rohit was hesitant to assume the captaincy responsibilities following Virat Kohli's decision to step down from the leadership role.""He has played two World Cup finals where he has gone into the final unbeaten. That speaks of his captaincy and leadership quality and I'm not surprised because he became captain when I was the BCCI president and when Virat didn't want to captain India anymore.""It took a lot of time to make him captain because he was not ready to captain. It took a lot of pushing from all of us to make him captain and I'm very happy to see the progress of Indian cricket under him.""Ganguly expressed that securing victories in the Indian Premier League (IPL) can occasionally be a more demanding task due to the extended length of the competition.""Rohit has the record of winning five IPL titles, which is a huge achievement. Winning an IPL sometimes is more difficult. Don't misquote me, I'm not saying IPL is better than international cricket.""But you have to win 16-17 (12-13) matches to win an IPL; here you need to win 8-9 matches to win a World Cup. The honour is more in winning the World Cup, and I hope Rohit does it tomorrow.""""I don't think he can lose two World Cup finals in seven (six) months. He will probably jump into the Barbados ocean if he loses two finals under his captaincy in seven months. He has led from the front, batted brilliantly, and I hope it continues tomorrow. Hope India finishes on the right side, and they should play with freedom.""They have been the best side of the competition. I wish them luck, I wish they win. Hope they have a little bit of luck tomorrow because that is required to win big tournaments,"" Ganguly added.India's journey since their triumphant Champions Trophy campaign has been marked by a series of near misses in major tournaments. They fought their way to the final of the 2014 T20 World Cup, showcasing their prowess in the shortest format of the game. However, they fell short at the final hurdle, unable to clinch the coveted title.""I look at it differently. At least we are getting to the finals, we can only win once we get to the final,"" he said.""The positive thing is India is not getting eliminated. Secondly, they are dominating. You saw the World Cup in India seven months ago; they were the best side in the competition, although they lost to Australia in the final.""They were a better side than Australia right through the tournament; they just had one bad day,"" he pointed out.Ganguly expressed his views on South Africa's historic achievement of reaching the World Cup final for the first time since their reintegration into international cricket in 1991.""It's a huge moment for South African cricket. Imagine a team that came back to international cricket in 1992, and it took them 32 years to play in a World Cup final. So, it's going to be a big day for both teams,"" he said.Kohli has been experiencing a relatively average performance in the current World Cup while opening the batting order. However, Ganguly believes that Kohli should maintain his position and not shift to the No. 3 spot in the lineup.""Virat should continue to open. He just had a World Cup of 700 runs seven months ago. He is human. Sometimes, he will also fail, and you have to accept it.""People like Kohli, (Sachin) Tendulkar, (Rahul) Dravid, they are institutions for Indian cricket. Three-four matches don't make them weaker players. Don't rule him out in the final tomorrow,"" added Ganguly.Former England captain Michael Vaughan has expressed disapproval of the ICC. He alleges that the governing body has given India an advantage by selecting a venue for the World Cup semifinal in Guyana that is conducive to spin bowling.Furthermore, Vaughan has leveled accusations against broadcasters, claiming that they have consistently allocated India the desirable 8pm IST time slot for all of their matches in the tournament.Dismissing such claims, Ganguly said: ""Michael Vaughan is a very dear friend of mine. I don't know how ICC helps India win cricket matches by keeping the broadcast at 8 pm IST in the evening. I don't know how broadcasting wins you cricket matches. You still have to play in the middle and win.""""Secondly, I don't know why Guyana is thought to be a venue for winning when they have gone around and won everywhere.""Ganguly emphasized his stance, asserting that India's unwavering performance in matches has established them as a formidable power in the sport.""Yes, India are a dominant force in world cricket, by its performance, by its broadcast, and by the money it brings to the table.""You know if you own 80 percent of a company's shares, you will get more dividends and profits than others. It's the rule of life. India are the same,"" he said.",Sourav Ganguly praises Rohit Sharma's captaincy skills. India aiming to end 11-year drought without an ICC title.

NEW DELHI: India and South Africa are set to face off in the T20 World Cup final in Barbados on Saturday. As the two unbeaten sides in the tournament gear up for the finale, here's a look at 5 key contests that could determine the course of the match.Rohit Sharma's contest against Marco Jansen will be critical. While it is not yet a well-known rivalry, Rohit’s vulnerability to left-arm pace, revealed previously by Pakistan's Mohammad Amir and Shaheen Shah Afridi, offers Jansen a chance to exploit this weakness.Jansen has been in excellent form during the tournament and could disrupt India's early momentum with his line outside off-stump.Numbers show a slight edge for Rohit, who has faced Jansen in nine T20I innings, scoring 113 runs and being dismissed only once.Virat Kohli's performance in the World Cup has been below par with just 75 runs from seven matches at an average of 10.71. Kohli will face a formidable opponent in Kagiso Rabada during the title clash. Rabada, with 12 wickets from eight matches, has an impressive economy rate of 5.88, considering his frequent bowling during the Powerplay and death overs.In their T20I meetings, Rabada has dismissed Kohli four times in 13 innings, conceding only 51 runs.This is a crucial matchup and Kohli will need to be cautious with Rabada’s incoming deliveries, particularly while attempting his trademark swat-flick.Another key battle involves Rishabh Pant and Keshav Maharaj. Pant has accumulated 171 runs from seven matches at a strike rate of 129, while Maharaj has taken nine wickets in the same number of matches. Pant, batting at No.3, is likely to face Maharaj within the first 10 overs.Maharaj will need to bowl with utmost accuracy to curtail Pant’s unconventional shots. Notably, Pant has been dismissed thrice while attempting the reverse sweep and paddle shot.Jasprit Bumrah versus Quinton de Kock is another anticipated duel. De Kock, who is the highest run-scorer for South Africa in this tournament with 204 runs from eight matches at a strike rate of 143, has given South Africa an edge in some low-scoring games. However, de Kock will confront Bumrah, who is considered one of the best bowlers in the world currently.Bumrah has taken 13 wickets from seven matches with an extraordinary economy rate of 4.12. De Kock will need to be at his peak to score runs off Bumrah or even to avoid losing his wicket.Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav will be up against Heinrich Klaasen. While Klaasen has a reputation for being a destructive player against spin, he has only managed 138 runs from eight matches in this World Cup at a strike rate of 112.Klaasen will need to rediscover his range-hitting abilities to provide momentum for South Africa in the middle overs, whether they are setting or chasing a target.Both teams carry different strengths and weaknesses into this decisive match, and the performances of these players will likely determine which side comes out on top.",India and South Africa face off in the T20 World Cup final in Barbados.

Both teams and officials faced delays of nearly six hours at the Grantley Adams airport due to rain, according to ESPN Cricinfo. Most matches in the Caribbean and the USA have encountered rain interruptions , leading to some games being washed out entirely or shortened.The weather remains a concern for the T20 World Cup 2024, with a storm warning issued for the final on Saturday, June 29.There is a special provision for the final match day, offering an extra advantage to ensure the title clash can proceed despite the weather forecast.

NEW DELHI: The outgoing India head coach Rahul Dravid commended the team's exceptional consistency in reaching three ICC finals within the past year. He expressed his optimism that a blend of intelligent gameplay and good fortune would enable India to secure a long-awaited ICC championship.Throughout the current T20 World Cup , India has demonstrated their superiority, mirroring their performance in the ODI World Cup held in their home country the previous year.However, in that tournament, they stumbled at the final obstacle against Australia.Rohit Sharma and his team are now set to face South Africa in the final at Barbados' Kensington Oval. They are determined to clinch a ICC title, a feat they last achieved during the 2013 Champions Trophy.""It is a good thing we have been consistently playing good cricket. We have been in finals in all three formats and credit goes to the players. If we play well and rub of the green goes (our way) we will surely win,"" Dravid, as quoted by PTI, said.As the final approaches, athletes often experience heightened pressure. However, given the mere 24-hour gap between the semifinal and final, India has limited opportunities for mental preparation.Despite the swift journey from Guyana to Barbados following their semifinal victory against England, Dravid expressed confidence in the team's mental readiness for the upcoming contest.""In terms of our preparation, we've just got one day in the middle, so it's unlikely we're going to be having practice.""It's just about all the guys getting into ensuring that physically, mentally, tactically we are ready for the game.""Dravid emphasized his team's readiness for the crucial encounter at the top.""Those are the things that we can control, that we are fresh, that we've looked after all our niggles, if there are any. We've done all our tactical preparation and we're mentally relaxed and excited and looking forward to the game.""We'll be looking to do that in the next 24 hours and try and get ourselves in the right frame of mind to be able to play that game,"" said the former India captain.In 2023, India suffered two devastating losses in ICC finals. They were defeated by Australia in both the World Test Championship (WTC) final and the ODI World Cup final.The question that arises is whether the Indian team has learned from these heartbreaking experiences.""No, nothing. I thought we were very well-prepared in Ahmedabad (ODI WC). We ticked all the boxes and, on that day, the other team played better. That's part of the sport.""The other team that's coming there to play has also obviously reached the final because they're a good team and they're playing very good cricket as well. So, they have as much right to win it as we do, but we hope that we'll play better cricket on the day,"" he said.India managed to score 181 runs in their Super 8 match against Afghanistan, despite the challenging pitch conditions that made playing on the up difficult. The team aimed to apply the lessons learned from that game in their upcoming encounter with South Africa, according to Dravid.The Indian team hoped to leverage their experience on a tricky surface and adapt their approach accordingly when facing the South African side.""Yeah, I mean, just the fact that we've played a game in Barbados is nice. It's nice that we have that familiarity of having played on that surface in the past.""But again, I think it's very hard to... We're not going to get exactly the same wicket that we got last time. I mean, it can be different, right?Dravid praised the team's collective effort in preparing for this prestigious event, highlighting their ability to adapt to various situations. He acknowledged the hard work put in by the entire squad leading up to the tournament.""I think what's really important is that we've done really well as a group. This whole tournament we have shown the ability to adapt, to recognize what is a good score. We played very differently in New York, then we played in St. Lucia, then we played even in Barbados when I thought that the game was quite slow.""I'm just hoping that whatever we come up against, we will have the ability to recognize it and be able to play accordingly, as we've done in the last three games,"" said Dravid.India demonstrated their capability to achieve substantial scores on challenging pitches, as exemplified by their performance in the semifinal at Guyana. Despite the low bounce of the surface, they succeeded in amassing a total of 171 runs.South Africa managed to break the long-running semifinal jinx in the World Cup and Dravid expressed his belief that the Proteas will enter the match unencumbered by any past disappointments or setbacks.""Not really, I mean it's not that the same players have been playing since 1991 and there's so many players that come and go. I don't think that really matters. I can't speak for them. But I don't think players go in keeping their baggage of the past.Likewise, Dravid expressed confidence in the Indian team's resilience and their capacity to bounce back from the setback they faced in Ahmedabad the previous year.""Players are very good at moving on from things, recognizing things. So, we will move on from Ahmedabad. I'm sure they will not be thinking about history. It'll be a fresh day.""Two good teams, two teams I think that everyone will agree will probably be the top two teams in this tournament. So, deserving finals for both the teams. And, hopefully, it's a great game of cricket. Hopefully, we fall on the right side,"" added Dravid.",Rahul Dravid hails India's consistency in reaching three ICC finals in the past year. India will face South Africa in the final of the T20 World Cup in Barbados.

Rahul Dravid , who has been serving as the head coach, has made it clear that he does not wish to extend his contract beyond the tournament.""Every game I have coached for India is important.

Additionally, Panesar made a bold prediction regarding struggling Virat Kohli .As the tournament reaches its climax, with the undefeated teams of India and South Africa set to face off in the final, Panesar has placed his faith in the Indian side led by Rohit Sharma to emerge victorious.Furthermore, he forecasted that Kohli, who has been experiencing a lean patch, would rise to the occasion and score a century against the formidable South African team.""India will win the T20 World Cup final , and Virat Kohli will score 100,"" Panesar told ANI.Kohli's recent performances in the T20 World Cup have been a far cry from his stellar run in the IPL 2024 season with the Royal Challengers Bengaluru. The former Indian captain, who had been in sublime form during the IPL, has found runs hard to come by in the ongoing international tournament, struggling to find his rhythm at the top of the order alongside Rohit Sharma.In the IPL 2024, Kohli had a phenomenal season, amassing 741 runs at an average of 61.75 and a strike rate of 154.69, with a century and five half-centuries, ultimately claiming the Orange Cap for the most runs scored in the tournament.However, Kohli's fortunes have taken a drastic turn in the T20 World Cup. Across seven matches, the experienced batsman has only managed to score 75 runs at a dismal average of 10.71, failing to make a significant impact for his team throughout the tournament.Rohit expressed confidence in his fellow Indian player's ability to deliver an impressive performance when facing South Africa in Barbados on Saturday. In addition to Panesar, the skipper believes his teammate has the potential to put on a remarkable display during the upcoming match against the Proteas.""He (Kohli) is a quality player. Any player can go through that. We do understand his class, and we do understand his importance in all these big games. Form is never a problem. When you've played cricket for 15 years, form is never a problem. He's looking good, the intent is there, and he's probably saving for the final. Absolutely (backing Kohli for the final),"" Rohit said in the post-match presentation after India's 68-run over England in the semi-final.",Former England spinner Monty Panesar has expressed his support for the Indian cricket team in their quest to end their ICC World Cup title drought by securing the T20 World Cup trophy.

They are outright match-winners in spin-friendly conditions,"" Sarandeep told PTI Videos on Friday.""We are having at the world's best spinners at the moment. Look at the way Kuldeep and Axar came in, they are winning all the games. They are unplayable. Everyone is talking about Kuldeep. He is going to destroy the South African middle order.""He has done it against Australia (in Super 8s) and England (in semifinals). Now it's the turn of South Africa. Axar is also a very dangerous slow left-arm orthodox bowler. An outright match-winner. Indian spinners will win the final.""Both India and South Africa come into the final without having lost a single match in the World Cup. South Africa have won all their eight games, while India emerged victorious in seven, with their match against Canada in Florida being washed out due to rain.Sarandeep, who played three Tests and five ODIs, emphasized that the spin-friendly conditions at Bridgetown would work well in favor of Kuldeep and Axar. He pointed out how effective Axar has been, especially when he begins taking wickets from the sixth over, thus easing the pressure on the rest of the bowling attack.""Axar starts getting wickets from the sixth over. It's not easy for Axar to bowl in powerplay. He comes, bowls, and makes things easy for the rest of the bowlers. Kuldeep and Axar are complementing each other so well.""The wickets in West Indies are not easy to play especially if you have world-class spinners like Kuldeep and Axar. It was not easy for England, it will not be easy for South Africa as well,"" Sarandeep observed.The former India off-spinner added that skipper Rohit Sharma was spot on in his assessment of Caribbeans conditions and opted for four spinners.""Rohit opted for four spinners but (Yuzvendra) Chahal is not in the scheme of things. The reason is, others have done their job exceedingly well. (Ravindra) Jadeja is the senior-most player but he is not coming into powerplay. Axar knows how to bowl in these conditions. He is the best option for us to bowl into the powerplay. He is giving the results as well,"" he added.On whether South African spinners Keshav Maharaj and Tabraiz Shamsi could also trouble the Indian batters, Sarandeep said, ""Yes they will. Keshav and Shamsi are also very good. Let's see how Indian batsmen handle the spinners.""India has a very strong middle order. India has left-handers like Rishabh Pant, Shivam Dube, Axar, and Jadeja. Four left-handers in the middle order. It will be interesting to see how Maharaj and Shamsi are going to tackle them. And vice-versa. This will be a big challenge for them also.""Sarandeep further asserted that India boasts the best batting and bowling lineup in the world, highlighting the exceptional bowling economy of ace bowler Jasprit Bumrah throughout the tournament.""Bumrah's economy is 3.5 or 3.6. This is so unreal. Other bowlers go over 9 or 10. Even after eight games, his economy is 3.5. This is so unreal. What else can you ask from him? India is the favourites not only in batting but bowling as well.""The former cricketer played down Virat Kohli's lack of form. Virat has scored only 76 runs in seven innings.""Virat is waiting for the final to perform. He is a world-class player, no doubt. He is mentally very strong. He is a team man. He is playing for the team. And there is some plan given to him.""Normally he opens only in the IPL. But here he had been given a clear-cut role. Virat is trying to hit from the first ball and trying to put more pressure on the bowlers. But somehow he is getting out quickly. But I am not worried about him. He is a big-match player. And that big game is coming. His big innings is coming against South Africa.""",Former India spinner Sarandeep Singh believes that India's spin duo of Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel will prove to be too much for the South Africans to handle.

On the other hand, Gareca was late in bringing on a player at halftime during Chile's match against Argentina on Tuesday.CONMEBOL cited articles 104 and 145 of the tournament's regulations, which stipulate that teams must take the field on time for the scheduled start or restart of play. Failure to do so has resulted in the one-match suspension for both Scaloni and Gareca, preventing them from being present on the substitutes' bench during their respective teams' final group stage matches on Saturday.In addition to the suspensions, the Argentine and Chilean football federations have each been fined $15,000 as a consequence of their teams' tardiness.As things stand, Argentina currently top Group A with six points and have already secured their place in the quarter-finals. They will face Peru on Saturday without the presence of Scaloni on the sidelines.Meanwhile, Chile, with only one point, will take on group runners-up Canada in their final group match, also without the guidance of Gareca from the bench.While the suspensions and fines may seem harsh, they serve as a reminder to teams and coaching staff of the need to respect the established rules and schedules, ensuring the smooth and timely progression of the competition.","The South American football governing body, CONMEBOL, has taken disciplinary action against the coaches of Argentina and Chile, Lionel Scaloni and Ricardo Gareca.

The goals from Luis Diaz , Davinson Sanchez , and Jhon Cordoba ensured that Colombia finished in the top two positions in Group D.With this win, Colombia extended their unbeaten streak to 25 games, a remarkable achievement that dates back to February 2022 when they suffered a defeat against Argentina.Nestor Lorenzo's well-drilled side displayed a composed and organized performance, never allowing Costa Rica to threaten their unbeaten record.The opening goal came in the 31st minute when Liverpool's Luis Diaz converted a penalty kick with authority after Costa Rican goalkeeper Patrick Sequeira committed a reckless challenge on Jhon Cordoba near the edge of the penalty area. Diaz's powerful strike found the top corner, giving Colombia the lead.Colombia came close to doubling their advantage in the 37th minute when veteran midfielder James Rodriguez picked out Diaz at the back post with a precise cross. However, Diaz's attempted cutback across the face of the goal narrowly evaded the outstretched Davinson Sanchez.Sanchez made amends for the missed opportunity in the 59th minute, glancing in Jhon Arias's left-wing cross to extend Colombia's lead to 2-0. Three minutes later, Cordoba scored the third goal with a clinical finish, latching onto Rodriguez's incisive through ball and firing a low shot across the goalkeeper and into the far corner.With this comprehensive victory, Colombia will qualify for the quarter-finals as group winners if they can secure at least a point against Brazil in their final group game on Tuesday.

Slovakia no pushovers for misfiring England in last-16 clash,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/uefa-euro-2024/slovakia-no-pushovers-for-misfiring-england-in-last-16-clash/articleshow/111342428.cms,"NEW DELHI: England, led by the cautious Gareth Southgate , must assert themselves against Slovakia in the Euro 2024 last-16 match, or risk being upset by the underdog Slovaks who are growing in confidence.Despite arriving in Germany as one of the tournament favourites with a highly skilled squad, England's optimism has waned after three lacklustre group stage performances.Southgate admitted that his experiment with various line-ups in the early matches had been unsuccessful, leaving the team's best starting eleven in question.In contrast, Slovakia began their tournament with a stunning 1-0 victory over Belgium, a team ranked 42 positions higher than them. This unexpected result has given the Slovaks belief that they can overcome their higher-ranked opponent and progress further in the competition.""The English have quality, but every opponent they have played were able to torment them,"" Slovakia midfielder Ondrej Duda told TV Markíza.Slovakia's head coach, Francesco Calzona , referred to his squad as the unexpected success story of the group stage following their victory against Belgium. Meanwhile, the underdog team from Georgia also exceeded predictions by stunning Portugal with a 2-0 win, demonstrating that no team should be underestimated.Although England supporters celebrated their team's placement on the more favorable side of the tournament bracket, potentially providing a less challenging path to the final, this advantage exists only in theory.""I think everyone has seen in this competition that there is not a favourable side of the draw,"" England defender Marc Guehi told reporters on Thursday. ""Every team, every opponent, is really tough to come up against. I think we need to remain calm.""England demonstrated some progress in the latter half of their goalless draw against Slovenia on Tuesday, with Kobbie Mainoo and Cole Palmer making a positive impact as substitutes.Although England's backline was a significant worry prior to the tournament due to the absence of experienced players like Harry Maguire, it has been the strongest aspect of the team's Euro performance . Throughout the group stage, England have conceded the fewest expected goals (xG) - a metric that quantifies the quality of scoring opportunities allowed to opponents.Southgate will be hoping for an improved display from Jude Bellingham , who excelled in the first half of their 1-0 victory against Serbia but faded in the subsequent two matches.Slovakia's key player is the skillful Napoli midfielder Stanislav Lobotka , whom Italian legend Andrea Pirlo described as ""the best playmaker in the Italian league.""Calzona, who had served as an assistant throughout his career before being named Slovakia's manager in 2022, stated that his team had already achieved their primary objective of reaching Euro. ""Everything else,"" he told UEFA , ""is icing on the cake.""""One of the goals now will certainly be to play beautiful football and make these people proud, because we've had a great following at recent matches,"" he said.England faces a challenging match against Slovakia, who are expected to adopt a defensive approach. The English side has had difficulties breaking down teams that employ a low block defensive strategy.However, England can take comfort in their historical record against Slovakia, having never lost to them in six previous encounters, including five victories and a goalless draw during the group stage of Euro 2016.Both teams had impressive Euro qualifying campaigns, with Slovakia securing seven wins and a draw in their 10 matches, while England emerged from their five-team group with six wins and two draws.The victor of this encounter will progress to the quarter-finals, where they will face the winner of the match between Italy and Switzerland.","England face Slovakia in Euro 2024 last-16 match.

In the 77th minute, Maximiliano Araujo effectively sealed the victory, capitalizing on a precise through ball from Nicolas de la Cruz to score from close range.Uruguay's dominance continued into the closing stages of the match. Federico Valverde extended the lead to 4-0 just four minutes after Araujo's goal. Substitute Rodrigo Bentancur added the final touch to the rout, heading home Uruguay's fifth goal in the 89th minute, marking his first touch of the game.With this victory, Uruguay are firmly in control of their Copa America destiny. A draw or better against the United States in their final group stage match on Monday will guarantee them top spot in Group C and a place in the quarter-finals. Even a defeat might see them progress, given their superior goal difference.For Bolivia, the loss marks their second in as many games, leaving them with a slim mathematical chance of avoiding a fourth consecutive group stage exit.The match also provided a platform for Uruguay's emerging talents. Darwin Nunez further solidified his position as a key player, netting his 13th international goal.Meanwhile, the legendary Luis Suarez, Uruguay's all-time leading scorer, made a late appearance as a substitute, immediately assuming the captain's armband.","Uruguay beat Bolivia 5-0 in their Copa America Group C encounter at New Jersey's Red Bull Arena.
