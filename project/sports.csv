"“What is wrong with NFL owners"": Donald Trump can’t believe Shedeur Sanders wasn’t a first-round pick, slams team owners as ‘stupid’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/what-is-wrong-with-nfl-owners-donald-trump-cant-believe-shedeur-sanders-wasnt-a-first-round-pick-slams-team-owners-as-stupid/articleshow/120635077.cms,"NFL owners branded ‘stupid’ by Trump over Shedeur Sanders’ shocking first-round draft omission (Credit: Getty Images)

President Trump slams NFL owners as ‘stupid’ for skipping Shedeur Sanders in first round of 2025 draft



The NFL Draft is known for its unpredictability, but the dramatic fall of Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders into the third round of the 2025 Draft has shocked many football fans and analysts. Once touted as a potential No. 1 overall pick, Sanders now finds himself still waiting for a team to take a chance on him—despite boasting an impressive college résumé and pedigree. His fall out of the first and even second round not only stunned onlookers but sparked widespread debate across social and sports media.Shedeur, the son of NFL Hall of Famer Deion Sanders , was projected by many to be a first-round talent, with the Pittsburgh Steelers among the teams frequently linked to him in mock drafts. Yet, after 65 selections, his name still hadn't been called. While draft boards fluctuate and team needs vary, the lack of confidence in Sanders by quarterback-needy teams is puzzling, especially after his standout 2024 season, where he was named Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year, leading Colorado to a strong 9-4 finish.Perhaps the most headline-grabbing reaction came from U.S. President Donald Trump , who launched a scathing rebuke of the league’s team owners on Truth Social. “What is wrong with NFL owners, are they STUPID?” Trump posted. “Deion Sanders was a great college football player, and was even greater in the NFL. He’s also a very good coach, streetwise and smart! Therefore, Shedeur, his quarterback son, has PHENOMENAL GENES, and is all set for Greatness. He should be ‘picked’ IMMEDIATELY by a team that wants to WIN. Good luck Shedeur, and say hello to your wonderful father!”Trump’s passionate post highlights the sentiment shared by many who feel that Sanders’ family background, athleticism, and proven leadership should have made him an early-round lock. With Deion Sanders not only being a Hall of Famer but also Shedeur’s coach at Colorado, the quarterback’s exposure to high-level mentorship and football IQ is undeniable.It’s worth noting that the NFL Draft isn’t just about talent—it’s about fit, timing, and a complex web of organizational strategies. Some franchises may have prioritized other positional needs, while others may be skeptical of media hype or external influences, even one as loud as a former president's endorsement.The real question now isn’t why Shedeur fell—it’s who will finally recognize his potential and make the move. Whether Trump’s loud backing shifts any front office decisions remains to be seen, but the spotlight on Shedeur Sanders burns brighter than ever. One thing is certain: wherever he lands, he’ll arrive with a chip on his shoulder and something to prove.Also Read: Shedeur Sanders suffers massive financial blow after NFL Draft first-round snub","Shedeur Sanders, the son of NFL Hall of Famer Deion Sanders, was projected by many to be a first-round talent.

What Lauri Markkanen Brings to the Lod Angeles Lakers

Why the Jazz Might Consider This Trade

Is This A Win-Win Deal?

Thehave been performing well in recent games, thanks to dominant performances from Luka Doncic and LeBron James . However, their lack of depth outside the star trio raises questions about roster upgrades. A potential solution? Trading for Utah Jazz forwardThe Los Angeles Lakers' victory in Game 2 demonstrated how much they depended on Austin Reaves and Doncic (who scored 52 points alongside James). There were very little bench contributions; Gabe Vincent scored six points and Dorian Finney-Smith only scored seven in 39 minutes.With limited offensive support, GM Rob Pelinka might explore adding another high-caliber player. As Dean Simon of the Sporting News noted,To acquire Markkanen, the Lakers could offer a package centered around young talent and draft picks:Proposed Trade DetailsThis deal gives Utah expiring contracts, a promising rookie in Knecht, and draft assets while providing the Los Angeles Lakers a proven scorer.At 27, Lauri Markkanen is entering his prime. Though his numbers dipped slightly this season (19.0 PPG, 5.9 RPG), his 2022-23 campaign proved his elite scoring ability (25.6 PPG). Playing for a tanking Jazz team likely impacted his production.Key Strengths:- Elite Shooting: Career 37.1% from three, perfect for spacing alongside Doncic and James.- Pick-and-Roll Threat: His size (7’0”) and athleticism make him a dangerous lob finisher.- Versatility: Can play both forward spots, fitting seamlessly into the Los Angeles Lakers’ system.Utah is in rebuild mode, and Markkanen’s value won’t be higher. Acquiring Knecht—a high-upside prospect—along with a future pick accelerates their youth movement. Hachimura and Vanderbilt provide short-term flexibility with expiring deals.For the Lakers, adding Markkanen creates a ""Big Three"" capable of contending for years. For the Jazz, it’s a chance to stockpile assets. While unlikely, this trade could reshape the Western Conference hierarchy.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers could bag $97 million Brooklyn Nets center to support LeBron James and Luka Doncic in Championship push Would you make this trade if you were Rob Pelinka?

NEW DELHI: Just a season after leading Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) to IPL glory, Shreyas Iyer returns to Eden Gardens in opposition colours, now captaining a rejuvenated Punjab Kings (PBKS).Let go by KKR in a shock off-season move, Iyer has found form and leadership comfort under mentor Ricky Ponting, guiding PBKS to the top five with five wins from eight. With 263 runs and three fifties, Iyer now has a chance to deliver a KL Rahul-style statement knock against his former team.KKR, however, are floundering with five losses in eight. Their top-order is shaky, the middle-order misfiring, and spin options underwhelming on home turf.Calls for change may see Rovman Powell come in, while Angkrish Raghuvanshi remains a lone batting bright spot. Ajinkya Rahane’s conservative approach and Sunil Narine’s lack of impact have also added pressure.PBKS, on the other hand, look confident with Marco Jansen’s early bursts, Nehal Wadhera’s finishing skills, and Arshdeep Singh’s 11 wickets leading the attack. Yuzvendra Chahal, who wrecked KKR in their 95 all-out collapse last week, looms large again.KKR must win five of their remaining six to stay in playoff contention, but with just one home win this season and internal issues, including pitch controversies, they face a tough task.Saturday’s clash is more than just a game: it’s personal, tactical, and possibly season-defining.Rahmanullah Gurbaz (wk), Sunil Narine, Ajinkya Rahane (c), Venkatesh Iyer, Rinku Singh , Andre Russell, Moeen Ali, Ramandeep Singh , Harshit Rana, Vaibhav Arora, Varun Chakaravarthy, Angkrish RaghuvanshiPrabhsimran Singh, Priyansh Arya, Shreyas Iyer (c), Josh Inglis(wk), Nehal Wadhera, Shashank Singh, Marcus Stoinis, Marco Jansen, Xavier Bartlett, Arshdeep Singh, Yuzvendra Chahal, Harpreet BrarBrace for a hot Saturday in Kolkata.

Brief scores:

Chennai Super Kings:

Sunrisers Hyderabad:

Sunrisers Hyderabad dealt a massive blow to Chennai Super Kings’ playoff hopes with a five-wicket win in a battle of strugglers at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Friday. The victory, SRH's first-ever at Chepauk, was powered by Harshal Patel ’s brilliant 4 for 28 on a sluggish surface and a composed chase that took them over the line in 18.4 overs.Chennai’s batting frailties continued to haunt them as they were bundled out for 154 in 19.5 overs. Dewald Brevis top-scored with a fluent 42 off 25 balls, while Deepak Hooda’s late cameo of 22 helped CSK limp past 150. The SRH pace attack, led by Harshal’s clever variations and supported ably by Pat Cummins (2/21), Jaydev Unadkat (2/21), and Mohammed Shami (1/28), never let the hosts settle.Despite dew aiding the chase, SRH made hard work of the modest target. After early setbacks, Ishan Kishan (44 off 34) anchored the innings, before Kamindu Mendis (32* off 22) and Nitish Kumar Reddy (19* off 13) finished the job with a calm 49-run unbroken stand for the sixth wicket.With this win, SRH moved to eighth in the ten-team table, collecting six points from nine matches. Their playoff hopes, though slim, remain alive — requiring them to win all five of their remaining fixtures, and by a healthy margin to stay in contention.For CSK, it was their seventh loss in nine games, leaving them at the bottom of the table and needing a near-miracle to qualify — five consecutive wins and a favourable points cut-off. The loss also highlighted their mounting concerns: a brittle top-order, a lack of bowling bite, and diminishing confidence across the board.154 all out in 19.5 overs (Dewald Brevis 42; Harshal Patel 4/28).155/5 in 18.4 overs (Ishan Kishan 44).","Sunrisers Hyderabad dealt a massive blow to Chennai Super Kings’ playoff hopes with a five-wicket win in a battle of strugglers at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Friday.

Who’s still left in the 2025 NFL Draft? Top remaining players you can’t ignore on Day 2



2025 NFL Draft Full Round 1 Review

Shedeur Sanders

Will Johnson

Aireontae Ersery

Jalen Milroe

TreVeyon Henderson

Landon Jackson

The opening night of the 2025 NFL Draft in Green Bay delivered its fair share of fireworks. Cam Ward going first overall to the Tennessee Titans was a headline-grabber, while the Jacksonville Jaguars made a bold move to trade up for two-way sensation Travis Hunter . Not to be outdone, the Las Vegas Raiders invested in electric running back Ashton Jeanty. But even with 32 picks off the board, the draft is far from decided.As Round 2 looms large, there's a surprising amount of first-round-caliber talent still available, setting the stage for what could be an equally eventful Day 2.Among the biggest storylines is the stunning omission of Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders. The son of NFL Hall of Famer Deion Sanders, Shedeur entered the draft process with immense buzz and delivered under the brightest lights in college football. “Despite operating in a spotlight that might blind other passers, Sanders somehow managed to exceed outsized expectations by establishing himself as a precise and poised distributor.” His ability to read defenses and deliver timely throws is already NFL-ready. While his pocket presence under pressure remains a question, Sanders has the tools to thrive in a system that allows him to orchestrate rather than freelance. Teams needing a long-term starter would be wise not to let him slip further.Another surprising name still available is Michigan cornerback Will Johnson, who has drawn comparisons to reigning Defensive Player of the Year Pat Surtain II. “The comparisons to Pat Surtain II...are lofty but not outlandish.” Standing at 6'2"" and 194 pounds, Johnson offers elite size, fluidity, and awareness. A toe injury hindered his 2024 campaign, but his upside remains sky-high. He’s projected to be a future shutdown corner capable of shadowing elite wideouts.Meanwhile, the trenches haven’t been overlooked. Minnesota's Aireontae Ersery remains the best offensive tackle on the board. The Texans, after missing out on top linemen late in Round 1, could be in play here. At 6'6"" and 331 pounds, Ersery combines nimbleness with raw power. “His tools are worth developing,” making him a long-term left tackle solution for any pass-protection-needy team.In terms of explosiveness, few prospects rival Alabama’s Jalen Milroe. The dual-threat quarterback turned heads in 2023 as he led the Crimson Tide with 20 rushing scores and 16 through the air. With 71 total touchdowns across two seasons, Milroe is “perhaps the most dynamic dual-threat quarterback of the draft class.” If a team tailors its offense to his strengths, they might unlock one of the biggest steals of Day 2.Another offensive weapon to watch is TreVeyon Henderson of Ohio State. While his inside running needs refinement, “he has the burst to break long gains whenever he's given a crease.” A legitimate three-down back, Henderson’s pass protection and receiving ability make him an instant contributor.Defensively, Arkansas’ Landon Jackson brings intimidating length and energy off the edge. Though “his rigidity severely limits him in several phases,” his relentless motor and physical tools will appeal to teams looking for an edge presence with untapped upside.With so much high-level talent still in play, Day 2 of the NFL Draft promises intrigue, value picks, and possibly franchise-changing decisions.Also Read: Why the Patriots believe Will Campbell is the cornerstone their offensive line has desperately needed","The 2025 NFL Draft begins on Thursday in Green Bay, Wisconsin.

Chad Gable opens up on Jason Jordan’s role backstage

WWE Superstar Chad Gable is embracing a whirlwind of emotions following WrestleMania 41, where he quietly made his mark under a mask. While he was not advertised for the main event, Gable did compete, just not as himself.In a light-hearted yet honest conversation with Rope Breaks, Gable revealed that he felt ""robbed"" of a proper WrestleMania spotlight yet again. “I got robbed again, man,” Gable said, referencing his absence under his real name. “This year, by this new guy, comes out of nowhere. Two matches, and he’s on WrestleMania. Can you imagine how I feel? Twelve years in, thirteen years in?”The “new guy” he’s talking about? None other than El Grande Americano , Gable’s own masked persona. On Night 2 of WrestleMania 41, Gable, as El Grande Americano, faced off against Rey Fenix. The match wasn’t originally scheduled, but Fenix stepped in as a last-minute replacement for the injured Rey Mysterio, who pulled out due to a torn groin.The character switch offered Gable a fun detour from his usual in-ring identity. And while the match was kept under wraps in the lead-up to the event, fans in attendance were treated to a surprise clash that ended with Gable scoring the victory under a mask.Beyond WrestleMania, Gable also spoke candidly in another interview, this time with The Ringer Wrestling Show , about working with his longtime friend and former tag team partner Jason Jordan. Jordan, now a WWE producer, plays a key behind-the-scenes role and often helps lay out Gable’s matches.“I get the biggest smile on my face anytime I see I’m working with him on a Monday,” Gable said. “Everybody does, to be fair. If anybody gets to work with Jason, they are over the moon because he is so good.”Gable and Jordan were part of the tag team American Alpha, a fan-favorite duo known for their strong chemistry and technical wrestling. Even though Jordan had to retire early due to injury, their bond remains intact.“With me, especially, we could do our whole work together and never speak a word,” Gable said. “We were like brothers when we were a tag team. It was something that was for sure meant to be.”As Chad Gable continues to evolve both in-ring and through alter-egos like El Grande Americano, his connection to WWE’s roots - both in friendship and performance, remains stronger than ever. And perhaps, next year, he’ll finally get that WrestleMania spotlight - no mask required.","WWE Superstar Chad Gable is embracing a whirlwind of emotions following WrestleMania 41.

NEW DELHI: Sunrisers Hyderabad defeated Chennai Super Kings by five wickets in their Indian Premier League clash on Friday, keeping their play-off hopes alive. With this loss, CSK are now virtually out of the race for the knockouts, while SRH remain in contention—at least mathematically.Asked to bat first, Chennai Super Kings were bowled out for 154. In response, SRH chased down the target in 18.4 overs, thanks to key contributions from Ishan Kishan (44), Kamindu Mendis (32*), and Nitish Reddy (19*).This marked Sunrisers Hyderabad’s first-ever win over CSK at the MA Chidambaram Stadium.While SRH's clinical bowling performance was the highlight on the field, it was co-owner Kavya Maran ’s animated reactions during the chase that stole the spotlight online. Her emotional response during the 16th over, in particular, went viral on social media.The moment came when CSK’s Noor Ahmad overstepped, gifting Kamindu Mendis — then on 15 — a free hit. But Mendis couldn’t make the most of the opportunity, swinging hard and missing a wide delivery that turned away. The result: a dot ball.Credit goes to Dhoni for standing outside the off stump, which prompted Noor to bowl in that specific area, resulting in a dot ball.Kavya Maran’s reaction, a mix of disbelief and frustration, was caught on camera and quickly made the rounds on social platforms, sparking widespread discussion.With the victory, SRH leapfrogged Rajasthan Royals to move into seventh place on the points table. Meanwhile, CSK, with just two wins from nine matches, are all but out of the tournament.","Sunrisers Hyderabad defeated Chennai Super Kings by five wickets in their Indian Premier League clash on Friday.

NEW DELHI: Indian cricket legend Virender Sehwag has issued a strong piece of advice to 14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi , who’s quickly become one of the most talked-about talents in this season’s IPL In a recent appearance on Cricbuzz, Sehwag didn’t hold back. “If you step out knowing that you will get praised for doing well and criticised for not doing well, you will remain grounded,” he said.“I have seen many players who come, get fame from one or two matches, then they do not do anything, because they think that they have become a star player.”Suryavanshi, who made history by becoming the youngest ever to get an IPL contract at Rs 1.1 crore, has already shown promise, smashing two sixes in his debut and scoring 50 runs at a strike rate of 156.25 in two matches.But Sehwag warned that this is just the beginning.QUIZ: Who's that IPL player? “Look at Virat Kohli . He started at 19 and has now played all 18 IPL seasons,” Sehwag pointed out. “That’s what Vaibhav should aim for. But if he thinks he’s made it just because he hit a six off his first ball and earned a crore, he might not be around next season.”Suryavanshi’s Royals fell short against Royal Challengers Bengaluru on Thursday, despite a blazing 52-run opening stand with Yashasvi Jaiswal . RCB, powered by half-centuries from Virat Kohli (70 off 42) and Devdutt Padikkal (50 off 27), posted 205/5 and held the Royals to 194/9.Kohli’s performance has pushed him to second in the season’s top run-scorers list, another sign of the long-term consistency Sehwag was referring to.The message from Sehwag is clear: talent can open the door, but staying power is built over years.",Indian cricket legend Virender Sehwag has issued a strong piece of advice to 14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi.

Aleksander Barkov's injury raises questions before critical Game 3



Florida Panthers' captain Aleksander Barkov had to leave Thursday evening's Game 2 vs. the Tampa Bay Lightning following a big hit from Brandon Hagel that left the Florida Panthers down to one of their most valuable players in the latter stages of the game. It was a dark cloud for Florida's 2-0 victory, which took the Florida Panthers 2-0 up on their first-round Eastern Conference series.The game was turned around midway through the third period when Brandon Hagel collided with Aleksander Barkov, dropping the Florida Panthers captain to a knee. Though Aleksander Barkov skated off on his own, he went straight to the locker room and did not return. The Florida Panthers were down over 10 minutes in regulation before they had to finish without their captain.Officials awarded Brandon Hagel a five-minute major for interference, a call protested on the spot by Lightning head coach Jon Cooper. “I was a little surprised it was a (major) ... five minutes in a 1-0 game with eight minutes to play, nine minutes to play, that's a tough situation to be in,” Cooper said after the game.Panthers head coach Paul Maurice provided no postgame update on Aleksander Barkov's status, merely saying, “Nope,” when asked if the team had any information. “We’ll evaluate him and see where he’s at,” he added.Aleksander Barkov already has three assists in the series, one on the game-winner Thursday night by Nate Schmidt.

Doc Rivers remains confident despite 0-2 deficit

What the Bucks need to do differently

Theare in a must-win situation as they face the Indiana Pacers in Game 3 of their playoff series. Down 2-0, the Bucks need a spark to turn things around—and all eyes are onThe good news for Milwaukee Bucks fans is that Giannis Antetokounmpo will suit up tonight. Despite the team’s struggles in the first two games, the Greek Freak has been dominant, dropping 34 points, 18 rebounds, and 7 assists in Game 2. His presence alone gives Milwaukee a fighting chance, but he can’t do it alone.The injury report is mostly clean for Milwaukee, with only one player under scrutiny:- Tyler Smith (Questionable) – His absence hasn’t heavily impacted the Bucks this season, so his status won’t drastically alter the rotation.Here’s how Milwaukee is expected to line up for Game 3:The Pacers have outplayed Milwaukee so far, capitalizing on the Bucks’ mistakes and lack of urgency. Tyrese Haliburton has been a key factor, and Indiana’s aggressive play has exposed Milwaukee’s weaknesses.- Damian Lillard’s struggles – In Game 2, Lillard managed only 14 points, 7 assists, and 3 rebounds. The Bucks need him to regain his rhythm.- Defensive lapses – The Pacers have controlled the tempo, and Milwaukee must tighten up defensively.- Over-reliance on Giannis – While Antetokounmpo is a force, the supporting cast must step up.Bucks head coach Doc Rivers isn’t panicking yet. He believes the series is far from over and expects a stronger performance at home.""I look at it as a long series (and) we haven’t played a home game,"" Rivers said. ""We have to go home and take care of business, then we can talk. I’m very confident about this series. Very.""- Increase defensive intensity – The Pacers have been too comfortable offensively.- Better ball movement – Milwaukee’s offense has been stagnant at times.- Bench production – Role players like Bobby Portis and Gary Trent Jr. must contribute more.Also read: Indiana Pacers announce important update about Tyrese Haliburtons injury status for tonight's Game 3 against the Milwaukee Bucks (April 25, 2025) With Giannis playing, the Bucks have a chance to shift momentum.

NEW DELHI: At 43, MS Dhoni continues to redefine longevity and legacy in cricket. On Friday night at the MA Chidambaram Stadium, during Chennai Super Kings ' crucial clash against Sunrisers Hyderabad, Dhoni walked out for his 400th T20 match, becoming only the fourth Indian to do so, after Rohit Sharma (456), Dinesh Karthik (412), and Virat Kohli (407).From lifting the 2007 T20 World Cup for India to guiding CSK to five IPL titles, Dhoni's influence on the shortest format has been immense.Across these 400 games -- played for India, CSK, Rising Pune Supergiant, and Jharkhand -- Dhoni has scored 7,566 runs at a strike rate of 135.90, with 28 half-centuries and a highest score of 84 not out.Behind the stumps, he remains unmatched, holding a record 34 stumpings and 318 dismissals overall.Though no longer the explosive finisher of his peak, Dhoni still commands respect every time he dons the gloves.His reflexes remain razor-sharp, and his tactical nous continues to steer CSK’s approach in crunch moments.Dhoni has resumed captaincy duties this season after Ruturaj Gaikwad was ruled out with an elbow fracture.It marks his first full-time return to leadership since the unforgettable 2023 IPL final, where CSK clinched their fifth title. While the 2025 season hasn’t been kind, CSK sit near the bottom of the table with just two wins in eight games, Dhoni’s presence still draws packed stands and unwavering fan support.In a match that could define the season for both CSK and SRH, Dhoni’s 400th game is more than a statistic — it’s a celebration of endurance, evolution, and excellence in T20 cricket. A fitting stage, a legendary career, and a milestone worthy of a standing ovation.","MS Dhoni played his 400th T20 match against Sunrisers Hyderabad.

I read it in a newspaper and told him the story while we were on our way to his academy,"" Amit told TimesofIndia.com.The distance between Verma's rented accommodation and the Ankur Cricket Academy, where Aniket trained, was 13 kilometers. Amit recalls that his nephew kept asking him about Hardik Pandya's journey, his struggles, and rise. ""That day, I saw the spirit, the passion, and the hunger in him. He wanted to make it big. Once we reached the stadium, he touched my feet and said, 'I complain about trivial things.'

On Sunday, against Delhi Capitals, with his team at 25 for 3, he smashed a 41-ball 74, studded with five fours and six sixes. Against Lucknow Super Giants, he clobbered a 13-ball 36 with five maximums. The sample size is small, but against spin, he is as effective as his Sunrisers teammate Heinrich Klaasen. He picks up lengths early and muscles the ball over the boundary rope.Aniket lost his mother when he was three. A year later, his father remarried. This forced his grandmother, Parvati Verma, to move to Bhopal alongside Amit.""We moved to Bhopal. I had just finished school. My late father was in the Railways, so my mother received his pension. She took care of me and Anni (Aniket's nickname). Since I called her 'Ma' or 'Mummy,' Aniket also picked it up and calls her the same. It was tough, but we managed,"" recounts Amit.When Aniket turned eight, Amit, a cricket enthusiast, took him to Nand Jeet Singh, a coach at Railways Youth Sports Club in Bhopal. Impressed by young Aniket's hand-eye coordination and aware of their financial situation, Nand Jeet waived his fees. Aniket trained there for two years before Nand Jeet sent him to Jyoti Prakash Tyagi. ""Unique kid. He called me before joining the squad. I gave him my blessings. The family stayed in one of my flats for years. I have seen him grow in stature,"" says Singh.Before the IPL started, when TimesofIndia.com reached out to Aniket for an interview, his first response was, ""Brother, I haven't achieved anything yet. I'm not even a regular for MP. Can we do this interview after the IPL season?"" After some persuasion, the youngster replied, ""You talk to my uncle. He can tell you better. His life has revolved around me.""Amit, who returned to Bhopal after traveling with Aniket for the first three matches, became emotional when he unwrapped the gift Aniket gave him. Aniket had asked him to open it once he reached home. It was a branded shoe with a message: ""To the world's best Chachu.""""My first job was at an automobile showroom. My salary was Rs 3,000. He was playing with torn shoes. I immediately took him to the shop and bought him sports shoes that cost Rs 1,200. I had never worn something that expensive in my life, but for him, I would have done anything. He slept with his new shoes that day,"" laughs Amit, who now works for a private company and earns Rs 20,000 per month.Aniket's coach, Jyoti Prakash Tyagi, says his ward was always a natural and played with aggressive intent, but he feels the 23-year-old is still raw and needs to work on certain areas.""There is no question about his work ethic. I have seen that those who don't think about Plan 'B' or 'C' are the ones who nail their Plan 'A' with precision. I never stopped him from playing aggressive cricket. Now, cricket has changed. His strength is to go aerial and take on the bowlers. Why curb that aggression? It's his strength,"" says Tyagi.""I still feel he needs to learn how to finish games. He must develop that temperament if he wants to play for his country. He will learn from experience, and in the next games, I would like him to take his team home. The intent should remain the same,"" he says.Aniket was scouted by Sunrisers Hyderabad during the 2024 Madhya Pradesh Premier League . Playing for Bhopal Leopards, he amassed 273 runs in six innings, hitting a staggering 25 sixes.""We were over the moon when he was hitting sixes for fun in the MPL. Never thought he would do the same in the IPL,"" said Amit with a laugh.","Aniket Verma is making waves in the IPL with his six-hitting abilities. In just 56 balls, he has already hit 12 sixes.

NEW DELHI: It’s a moment that will be replayed all season and maybe even for years. During a high-octane IPL 2025 clash between Chennai Super Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Friday, Kamindu Mendis pulled off an astonishing catch that’s already being hailed as the “Catch of the Tournament”.In the 13th over, with Dewald Brevis threatening to take the game away from SRH, Harshal Patel delivered a tempting half-volley wide outside off.Brevis, in red-hot form, launched into a fierce lofted drive toward long-off. It looked destined to race away for six until Mendis took flight.The ambidextrous Sri Lankan, already known for his unique bowling ability, showcased outrageous athleticism.Watch:At full stretch and diving wide like a goalkeeper, he clung onto the ball mid-air, barely an inch from the ground.As he landed, he expertly cushioned the fall to prevent the ball from bouncing out. His teammates erupted, led by skipper Pat Cummins, who couldn’t contain his excitement and was the first to embrace Mendis.Brevis, stunned, could only walk off with a respectful nod, having scored 42 off just 25.But that wasn’t the only talking point. Earlier in the match, Ravindra Jadeja was forced to swap his bat after it failed a surprise umpire inspection. The gauge test ruled it out of regulation, causing a brief but curious delay. The same incident happened to batter Noor Ahmad later in the innings.Thanks to another dismal batting performance, CSK could only pose 154 all out in 19.5 overs.","Kamindu Mendis pulls off stunning catch in IPL 2025 clash between Chennai Super Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad.

Luguentz Dort shares his side of the story after causing Ja Morant’s fall

Memphis Commercial Appeal

Oklahoma City Thunder guard Luguentz Dort faced backlash from Memphis Grizzlies fans after his foul caused the team's star, Ja Morant, to suffer a hard fall and exit the game before he could lead a potential comeback. Dort has addressed the incident, calling Morant’s fall “unintentional” and expressing concern after learning Morant had sustained a hip contusion.After the Oklahoma City Thunder erased all the progress Memphis had made in the first half and defeated them 114-108, Dort gave a clarification, saying he didn’t intend to hurt Morant and that it all happened in the heat of the moment. He said, as reported by the, “Tough one. Obviously, I hope he’s OK. I was running back, making a hustle play for my team. I was running quick, stopped on a dime. I didn’t know he was behind me, and I was slipping. I tried to make a play on the ball, but we just ran into each other, and he fell down. But I hope he’s OK. I didn’t mean to hit him like that.”Dort even approached Morant to express regret for unintentionally hurting him. He said, “When he was at the line, I dapped him up and I apologized obviously. It's never good when a good player like that goes down. But people can say whatever they want. He dapped me up. That was it. That was enough. At least he knows that I didn't mean to take him down like that.""The Grizzlies might have won the game against the Oklahoma City Thunder had Ja Morant not suffered the hip injury. Morant still got up and limped to the line to take his free throws, which he missed. He received a standing ovation from the fans for his courage. He left the court soon after, and it's still unclear if he will return for Saturday’s game.Also Read: Ja Morant limps off court after scary fall during Oklahoma City Thunder vs Memphis Grizzlies This marks Morant’s second injury in just a few days.

NEW DELHI: The expression on captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni ’s face said it all as Chennai Super Kings suffered another defeat—this time a five-wicket loss to Sunrisers Hyderabad at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai on Friday. A visibly disappointed Dhoni admitted that a total of 154 was far from “justifiable” on a Chepauk pitch that didn’t have any demons, as SRH dealt a near-fatal blow to CSK’s IPL 2025 play-off chances.Sunrisers chased down the modest target in just 18.4 overs. Dhoni pointed out that it's always tough when several players fail to deliver simultaneously.He also believed that SRH batted under slightly tougher conditions in the second innings, yet CSK couldn't capitalise. For the skipper, the lack of cohesion in the team's overall effort was most frustrating.""I think we kept losing wickets and another thing is in the first innings the wicket was slightly better and 157 wasn't a justifiable score,"" Dhoni said after CSK’s loss.""It wasn't turning a lot, a little two-paced but nothing out of the ordinary. Yes, second innings there was a bit of help. Our spinners, the quality was there and they were bowling in the right areas, but we were 15-20 runs short,"" he added.Commenting on Dewald Brevis’ performance, Dhoni said, ""[On Brevis] I think he batted really well and we needed that in the middle order. When the spinners come in, you do it either by batsmanship or picking the right areas, but that's an area where we want to improve because middle overs are crucial.""Reflecting on the broader issues plaguing the team, Dhoni didn’t hold back.""In a tournament like this, if there are one or two areas to plug in the holes it's good, but when a majority of the players are not doing well you need to make changes. You can't just keep going. We are just not putting enough runs on the board,"" he said.With this win, SRH have moved up to eighth place on the points table, registering three wins and six losses for a total of six points.CSK, meanwhile, sit at the bottom with just two wins from nine games and only four points to show.","Chennai Super Kings lost to Sunrisers Hyderabad by five wickets.

NFL Draft 2025: A ratings smash that captures Football’s offseason magic



The NFL Draft has long been a spectacle that blends uncertainty with unfiltered hope, and the 2025 edition proved once again why it holds a unique place in sports culture. Averaging 13.6 million viewers across ESPN, NFL Network, ABC, ESPN Deportes, and various digital platforms, the first night of this year’s draft became the second-most watched opening round in NFL Draft history, according to data released by the league and Nielsen. It marked a solid 11% increase from 2024’s numbers and reaffirmed its role as the crown jewel of the offseason.While these figures still trail behind typical prime-time NFL games, the context is key—this isn’t a game. No touchdowns, no crunching tackles, and no game-winning drives. Just team executives, analysts, and young athletes in suits waiting for their names to be called. And yet, fans flock to it. Why? Because it’s more than a show—it’s a ritual, a nationwide celebration of what could be.The paradox of the NFL Draft lies in its format. As one might put it, “Nothing draws a crowd like the ultimate reality show about nothing.” On the surface, it’s just people talking in an auditorium. But for diehard fans, it’s so much more—weeks of research, mock drafts, combine performances, and trade rumors culminate in a single night of anticipation.Matt Shapiro, the NFL’s Vice President of Event Strategy, summed it up best: “All teams at this moment have hope. No matter how last season went, everyone is making a fresh start. And every team makes picks that the fanbase can get excited about.” That’s the heartbeat of the event—it’s not about the past, but the possibility of a better future. Whether your team went 3-14 or made a playoff run, draft night levels the playing field.Adding to the atmosphere, 205,000 fans gathered in Green Bay to witness the first round in person—further proof that the draft has evolved into a full-blown fan experience. It's not just a night of announcements, but a celebration of football’s future stars.And while the all-time record of 15.5 million viewers in 2020 remains untouched, the 2025 NFL Draft proved that excitement for the game begins long before kickoff. The event has transformed into a staple of the sports calendar—a mix of drama, dreams, and the thrill of the unknown. The first round of the NFL Draft in 2024 averaged 12.1 million viewers.The real games may be months away, but for one night in April, football fans got to believe again. That’s the magic of the draft—where every team has a chance, and every pick could be the start of something unforgettable.Also Read: The secret behind America’s obsession with the NFL Draft, even when no games are played","The 2025 NFL Draft attracted 13.6 million viewers across ESPN, NFL Network, ABC, ESPN Deportes, and various digital platforms.

Sunrisers Hyderabad secured their first-ever victory against Chennai Super Kings at MA Chidambaram Stadium on Friday, winning by five wickets while chasing a target of 155. The win kept SRH's slim playoff hopes alive while severely diminishing CSK's chances, who recorded their fourth home defeat this IPL season, their joint-highest-ever at Chepauk in a single season.This season once-a-fortress Chepauk has been breached multiple times by visiting teams. Royal Challengers Bengaluru won in Chennai for the first time after 17 years , when they thrashed CSK by 50-runs. Delhi Capitals also snapped their losing streak in Chennai, winning after a gap of 15 years on April 5 by a 25-run margin.And on Friday, SRH ended their own losing streak against CSK at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Before the game on Friday, CSK had beaten SRH each time at home: played five, won five. That run is now over.SRH captain Pat Cummins won the toss and elected to field, leading his bowling unit to a disciplined performance. Harshal Patel was the standout bowler with four wickets, while Cummins and Jaydev Unadkat claimed two wickets each.CSK's batting struggled from the start, with Ayush Mhatre scoring 30 and Dewald Brevis making 42 before being dismissed by a brilliant fielding effort from Kamindu Mendis.The chase proved challenging for SRH as they lost opener Abhishek Sharma for a duck. Travis Head and Ishan Kishan provided some aggressive batting before Kishan's dismissal.Ishan Kishan and Aniket Verma formed a crucial 36-run partnership, with Kishan scoring 44 before his departure. The victory was ultimately secured through a partnership between Kamindu Mendis and Nitish Kumar Reddy.For CSK, Noor Ahmad was the most effective bowler, claiming two wickets in his spell.The match marked a significant milestone for MS Dhoni, who became the fourth Indian cricketer to play 400 T20 matches. He joined the elite company of Rohit Sharma (456), Dinesh Karthik (412), and Virat Kohli (407).","Sunrisers Hyderabad secured their first-ever victory against Chennai Super Kings at MA Chidambaram Stadium on Friday.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin. The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee. England completely skipped Saturday's practice, but many India players also skipped the optional session.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118081067,imgsize-126924,width-400,resizemode-4/118081067.jpg"

NEW DELHI: In what was meant to be a celebratory night for MS Dhoni’s 400th T20 appearance, Sunrisers Hyderabad crashed the party with a ruthless pace performance, defeating Chennai Super Kings by five wickets at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Friday.Veteran seamer Harshal Patel starred with the ball, picking up 4 for 28, as CSK were bowled out for 154 in pursuit of SRH’s 149/5.Harshal’s clever variations and calm under pressure proved decisive, especially on a surface that didn’t offer much pace or bounce.It was a well-rounded bowling effort from SRH. Pat Cummins (2/21), Mohammed Shami (1/28), Jaydev Unadkat (2/21), and Kamindu Mendis (1/26) all chipped in to ensure CSK never truly gained control of the chase.CSK suffered an immediate blow when Shaik Rasheed fell on the very first ball of the innings.

Shah Rukh Khan: The superstar who turned IPL into a blockbuster

NEW DELHI: Punjab Kings skipper Shreyas Iyer’s scintillating form this IPL season has reignited talk about his comeback trail, with team’s spin coach Sunil Joshi attributing the resurgence to Iyer’s ""hunger for challenges"". Since being released by Kolkata Knight Riders despite leading them to the IPL 2024 title, Iyer has responded in style with unbeaten knocks of 97 and 52 to start the 2025 season.""If you look back at Shreyas' contribution from the Champions Trophy onward, he has become more consistent, especially against spin,"" Joshi said ahead of Punjab Kings’ clash against KKR. ""He accepts every challenge, every ball. That’s the mindset of a top player.""""He has shown the hunger and he is ready to accept every challenge he comes across. For any player of that calibre, you accept every challenge, every ball. I am sure that he has done some great work behind the scenes. It's a good momentum to carry forward as a leader as well,"" Joshi added.Iyer was a pillar in India’s middle order during the 2025 Champions Trophy, averaging 48.60 with two fifties in five matches. His resurgence has been fueled by both mental resolve and technical adjustments — most notably, a more open stance and deeper positioning in the crease to counter the short ball.Joshi also highlighted Iyer’s leadership evolution. ""He talks to every player — even net bowlers. That builds confidence and shows his care for the team. It’s a hallmark of a genuine leader.""Despite returning to Eden Gardens, where he lifted the IPL trophy last year, Iyer has shown no signs of emotional overdrive. ""Every game is important. The approach remains the same — play to win,"" Joshi said.While speculation continues about Iyer’s potential India recall for the England tour, Joshi chose to keep the focus on IPL. ""Let’s stick to the IPL. I’m not the right person to talk about national selection.""","Punjab Kings skipper Shreyas Iyer has been in superb form this IPL season.

He's not joining as an official playing member of the squad, but will work with the team and support staff to get back to his best! Welcome to the family, Umran.""KKR acquired Umran at his base price of Rs 75 lakhs during last year's IPL Mega Auction. However, due to injury, the team brought in Chetan Sakariya as his replacement in March before the season commenced.Previously associated with Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) for four years, Umran earned recognition as 'Jammu Express' for consistently bowling at speeds exceeding 150 kmph. During his SRH tenure from 2021 to 2024, he claimed 29 wickets in 26 matches, averaging 26.62 with an economy rate of 9.39, including a best performance of 5/25.His finest IPL performance came in 2022, securing 22 wickets at an average of 20.18, with best figures of 5/25 and an economy rate of 9.03.

NEW DELHI: A rare and unexpected moment unfolded at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Friday during the IPL clash between Chennai Super Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad , as Ravindra Jadeja was forced to change his bat after it failed the umpire's inspection.The incident took place right after Jadeja walked out to bat following Sam Curran’s dismissal in the fifth over.As Jadeja arrived, the on-field umpire stopped play momentarily to inspect his bat using the standard bat gauge — a tool used to ensure bats conform to size regulations.Watch:Much to the surprise of the crowd and players, the bat did not pass through the gauge, prompting the umpire to ask for a replacement.A fresh bat was quickly fetched from the CSK dugout, allowing play to resume.The brief delay added a layer of drama early in Chennai’s innings, drawing plenty of reactions from fans both in the stadium and online.Jadeja had come to the crease after Sam Curran fell to a clever delivery by Harshal Patel.In the 4.3 over, Curran attempted to pull a slower short ball outside off but mistimed it badly, sending a simple catch to Aniket Verma at deep mid-wicket. He departed for 9 runs off 10 balls.And despite giving CSK some respite with his knock of 21 off 17, Jadeja couldn't capitalise on the brisk start, falling to Kamindu Mendis in the 10th over.Earlier, Sunrisers Hyderabad captain Pat Cummins won the toss and opted to bowl first.SRH made notable changes, bringing in Mohammed Shami and Kamindu Mendis, while naming Travis Head, Abhinav Manohar, Sachin Baby, Rahul Chahar, and Wiaan Mulder as substitutes.CSK also shuffled their lineup, with Dewald Brevis and Deepak Hooda replacing Rachin Ravindra and Vijay Shankar.The unusual bat inspection moment, though brief, was one of the talking points in a match that was already high on stakes and expectations.",Ravindra Jadeja forced to change his bat after it failed the umpire's inspection.

Iyer, who guided KKR to their IPL championship in 2024, possesses comprehensive knowledge of the team.Kotian arrived at the team hotel on Thursday and immediately began contributing, delivering challenging overs to PBKS batsmen during practice sessions.",Mumbai all-rounder Tanush Kotian has joined Punjab Kings as a net bowler.

Liverpool manager Arne Slot is preparing for a potential Premier League title celebration at Anfield on Sunday against Tottenham, needing just one point to secure the club's record-equalling 20th English championship. The achievement would come five years after their last title, which was celebrated in an empty stadium during the COVID-19 pandemic.Liverpool currently lead Arsenal by 12 points with five games remaining in their campaign, while Arsenal have only four matches left to play.""It's a big responsibility. We are aware that the last time this club won the league was during the Covid time. So everybody is looking forward to Sunday,"" Slot told reporters on Friday.""We know there's still a job to do. We need at least one point. Our fans know as well. When they come to the stadium they have to support us in the best possible way as they have done all season. It's a nice game to look forward to but also a responsibility we have for Sunday.""The title could have been decided earlier this week when Arsenal faced Crystal Palace. Liverpool's players and staff gathered to watch the match together, hoping to celebrate, but the game ended in a 2-2 draw.""It was different. Normally when you watch a game of football, you are either alone or with family or friends. But we watched it all together,"" Slot said. ""Before the game, I would have been surprised if the game ended in a draw. But during the game, I wasn't because Crystal Palace again showed what this league is all about.""The upcoming achievement would see Liverpool match Manchester United's record of 20 English titles. Slot, in his first season after replacing Jurgen Klopp, would become the first Dutch manager to win the Premier League.""No, I get these questions so it comes to your mind but it is the last thing you think of as a manager at this time. We saw last week how hard it was to get a win against a team that was nearly relegated at Leicester,"" Slot said. ""I am not getting carried away. We have faced Tottenham three times and I know how hard it is to beat them.""Liverpool's impressive season under Slot has seen them lose only twice in the league. The manager acknowledges the expectations that come with leading the club.""This club has to win trophies,"" Slot said. ""The good thing is most managers work here a long time so you have a few chances to win trophies. You are aware of that but that is not the first thing that you think about when you walk through this door.""Some have suggested Liverpool's success comes from Manchester City's decline and Arsenal's injury problems. Slot responded to these claims.""Everybody can have their own opinion. You might have a different opinion. That is the nice thing about the world we are living in. I am only here for a year so I can only tell you what I experienced,"" Slot said. ""It has never been as hard to end up in the top four or five. In my opinion it is a really difficult league.""If Liverpool fail to secure the title against Tottenham, their next opportunity would come at Chelsea in their following league fixture.","Liverpool manager Arne Slot preparing for potential Premier League title celebration.
