Cricket holds a special place in the hearts of millions across India, with fans passionately following every move of their favorite cricketers. Legends like Sachin Tendulkar , Mahendra Singh Dhoni, and Virat Kohli enjoy massive fanbases, with their fame reaching almost mythical proportions within the country. However, this intense recognition doesn't always extend beyond India's borders, as a recent viral video highlights.A video recently surfaced on Instagram that caught the attention of cricket enthusiasts.The clip, shot in a foreign country, features a host stopping random passersby, asking them if they know who Virat Kohli is or if they've even heard of cricket. Much to the shock of Indian fans, the responses were overwhelmingly negative.In the video, the host begins by asking two men, ""Do you know who Virat Kohli is?"" Both men, without hesitation, admit they have no idea who the cricket star is. The host then turns to a woman and poses the same question, ""Have you heard of Virat Kohli?"" Initially confused, she too confirms that she’s unfamiliar with the name.The video continues as the host approaches more people, asking the same questions. Each time, the answer remains the same—none of the individuals interviewed had ever heard of Virat Kohli or cricket. This highlights the stark difference in the sport's popularity within India and globally. While Kohli is revered as a cricketing superstar in his homeland, cricket remains a relatively niche sport in many other parts of the world, where other sports like soccer or basketball dominate.Since being posted, the video has garnered over 1.6 million views on Instagram and sparked a flood of reactions. Thousands of users have liked, shared, and commented on the post, expressing everything from surprise to amusement.One user quipped, ""If you ask about Ronaldo, they'll know,"" referring to the global fame of football icons like Cristiano Ronaldo, whose recognition transcends borders. Another user called Virat Kohli ""the king"" in the comments, showcasing the immense pride Indian fans take in their cricket stars.A user named Suraj pointed out the obvious cultural divide, stating, ""When cricket isn’t famous worldwide, how will they know Virat Kohli?"" Another amused commenter asked, ""Brother, which country have you gone to?"" as others filled the comment section with shock emojis and disbelief.",Cricket holds a special place in the hearts of millions across India.

Mahmud's ability to swing the ball both ways showcased his potential on the international stage.Despite Mahmud's breakthroughs, India turned the tide through Ashwin and Jadeja. Ashwin scored an unbeaten 102, while Jadeja added 86 not out, their partnership of 195 runs for the seventh wicket stabilizing India's innings.Mahmud, who hails from a farming family near Chattogram, progressed through Bangladesh’s age-group cricket system.

India vs Bangladesh: How T20 hitting prepared Ravichandran Ashwin for Chepauk bash,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/bangladesh-in-india/india-vs-bangladesh-how-t20-hitting-prepared-ravichandran-ashwin-for-chepauk-bash/articleshow/113507702.cms,"CHENNAI: When Ravichandran Ashwin made his debut for an age-group Tamil Nadu team many moons ago, he did so as a batter who could bowl a bit. Years have gone by, the teenager of yesterday is in the twilight of a brilliant international career as an off-spinner, but his first love, batting, hasn't left him.Ashwin's as yet unbeaten 102 off 112 balls is his sixth century, but this one is different in many ways.At 144 for six in the first innings, India were in the dumps, and the game that Ashwin brought to the fore isn't something that we are used to.The 38-year-old, who normally looks to buy his time in the beginning of the innings, came out with an attacking intent and launched into his strokes right from the word go.It seemed well practised and one understands that this is something Ashwin has been working on for some time now. A month before the Test series started, he played the Tamil Nadu Premier League , a domestic T20 tournament, and batted most of the games as an opener or at No. 3.In the last three knockout games in which he scored three consecutive half-centuries-two being scored on the same MA Chidambaram pitch in Chennai-his strike rates were 160, 230 and 113, which went a long way in winning the title forDindigul Dragons .Guru Kedarnath, one of the coaches at Dindigul Dragons and a friend of Ashwin, told TOI that the allrounder has considerably improved his power-hitting over the years.""It's not that he comes into TNPL saying that he would like to improve one facet of the game, but you can see that he is constantly working on something or the other. Power-hitting definitely was a part of it. His ability to dance down the track and his excellent hand-eye co-ordination were absolutely crucial,"" Kedarnath, who is also the assistant coach of Tamil Nadu, said.On Thursday, after completing the century, Ashwin acknowledged that the TNPL experience was a big help. ""The fact that I'm coming off a T20 tournament worked quite a bit on batting and playing the shots. I've always been giving the ball a waft and on a surface like this, it's better to go hard like Rishabh (Pant) does,"" Ashwin said.The bounce and carry on the pitch was something that he had grown up playing, and Ashwin did mention that it was an ""old school Chennai surface"". ""When there is width, you can give it a tonk. I love playing when there is bounce and carry and enjoyed myself today,"" Ashwin said.His trusted comrade Ravindra Jadeja 's presence at the other end also played its part and Ashwin didn't forget to mention it. ""There was a point where I was sweating and tiring but Jaddu helped me through the phase. He's been solid and one of our best batters. He told me we don't have to convert twos into threes, which was useful for me,"" Ashwin added.This was his second consecutive Test century at home, the earlier one coming against England in 2021. That was between the first and second waves of Covid and not too many were there to witness in. This time around, his family and friends were present, making it ""a special occasion"".Just that the party isn't over yet. The best part-with the ball- is yet to come.","Ravichandran Ashwin scores unbeaten 102 off 112 balls in India's first innings.

India vs Bangladesh: Modest Hasan Mahmud at the forefront of Bangladesh's pace revolution,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/bangladesh-in-india/india-vs-bangladesh-modest-hasan-mahmud-at-the-forefront-of-bangladeshs-pace-revolution/articleshow/113509279.cms,"CHENNAI: When Hasan Mahmud was threatening to take the game away from India with his pace and movement on Thursday morning, he was making a silent statement. Not just for himself but for Bangladesh cricket in general.Gone are the days when Bangladesh depended solely on spinners to merely prolong the game. They have a crop of youthful pacers in the form of Mahmud, Nahid Rana, Shoriful Islam and a few others who can challenge the best in the business.Pakistan felt the heat of it in their own backyard and India were very close getting burnt till R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja intervened.While coach Chandika Hathurusingha said the other day that Bangladesh have a few pacers waiting to be unleashed on the big stage, at the forefront right now is the shy Mahmud, whose career was at the crossroads a few months ago. It's understood that after his white-ball debut about four years ago, the team management wasn't too happy with his attitude. He lost his place and was left out in the cold.After that, when Najmul Hossain Shanto and Hathurusingha took over the Bangladesh reins, they apparently had a conversation with the pacer. His biomechanically correct action, ability to move the ball both ways and deceptive pace off the pitch made them think of giving him a recall, but it was important that the 24-year-old fit the ethos of the team.When he made his Test debut against Sri Lanka in Chattogram in March 2024, however, Mahmud was not the first choice. ""Musfik Hasan, who bowls at a pace of 140 kph, was supposed to play the Test but he got injured. Mahmud was an afterthought but he was up for it,"" a source close to the team said. He got six wickets in the Test and hasn't looked back.Unlike most pace bowlers, Mahmud refused to celebrate wickets in his early days. It seemed he lacked the aggro, but on Thursday, there was a hint of euphoria on the pace bowler's part after dismissing Virat Kohli . But Mahmud stressed that it wasn't a celebration. ""No, that was not a celebration, it was only a simple gesture of mine. I was just happy getting the best batsman in the world out,"" Mahmud said.In everything he said on Thursday, there was modesty, but he didn't lack was conviction. He still believes a fightback is possible. ""Everything's not lost,"" Mahmud said.","Hasan Mahmud's career was at the crossroads a few months ago. He lost his place and was left out in the cold.

India scored 3.5 points as opposed to Iran's 0.5.With this victory, the Indian team has maintained a perfect score of 16 points out of a possible 16, while solidifying its claim for the gold medal in the open section.Arjun's performance in the tournament has been remarkable, as he has secured 7.5 points out of eight games, propelling him closer to the coveted 2800 rating mark.With his live rating now at 2793 points, Arjun is on the verge of becoming only the 16th player in history and the second Indian after Viswanathan Anand to surpass the 2800 rating threshold.Inspired by Arjun's success, Gukesh's victory elevated his rating to 2785 points. This unprecedented feat marks the first time two Indians have simultaneously ranked among the top five players in the world.In his game, Arjun employed the reverse Benoni opening with his black pieces, creating early complications on the board. Daneshwar could not recover from his mistakes.Gukesh secured a victory with the black pieces, employing the Dubov variation in response to his opponent's Queen pawn opening. Maghsoodloo's decision to pursue unnecessary complications backfired as time pressure mounted in the middle game.The Iranian soon found himself sacrificing a piece for a few pawns, but succumbed to a straightforward tactical maneuver that concluded the game.Vidit opted for the Sozin variation against Pouya's Sicilian defense, launching an irresistible attack.

NEW DELHI: Virender Sehwag , the explosive Indian opener who has amassed over 8,000 runs in both Test and ODI cricket, is renowned for his aggressive batting style. R Ashwin , India’s ace spinner, once mentioned that Sehwag does not consider off-spinners as true bowlers.Such was Sehwag’s aura that he could be singing Hindi songs while smashing bowlers for boundaries. Bowlers like Shoaib Akhtar Brett Lee , and Dale Steyn, all ace pacers, were not spared, as even the slightest loose ball from the greatest of bowlers was sent to the boundary.Sehwag, who scored a century on his Test debut, did not initially start as an opener, but his explosive batting earned him that role. He went on to open India’s batting in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2011 alongside the great Sachin Tendulkar , setting the tone of the tournament with a brilliant 175 in his first innings.Sehwag shares the record for the most triple centuries in Test cricket and was close to making history. During a Test match against Sri Lanka in Mumbai, he had the chance to become the first batsman to score three triple centuries.On the first day of this match, Sehwag scored 284 runs, making it the third-highest score by a batsman in a single day of a Test match. He faced tough bowlers like Muttiah Muralitharan but remained in control.Towards the end of the day, with only 3-4 overs left, his batting partner Rahul Dravid advised him to play out the day.Sehwag recalled in an interview that Dravid told him to imagine batting through the remaining overs without losing his wicket and then coming back the next day to possibly make 300, 400, or even 500 runs.According to Sehwag, after this conversation, Dravid carefully played out the overs, taking a single only when the over was about to end so that Sehwag would face fewer balls.When the day ended, and both batters remained not out as they returned to the dressing room, Dravid told him, 'Well done, bohot badhiya. Ab kal dekh tu wapas aaega toh pura din batting karega toh tu world record bana sakta hai.'Sehwag admitted that Dravid's words filled him with optimism, and he went to his room, had dinner, and slept soundly. However, the next day, he managed to add only 9 more runs before being dismissed for 293.Sehwag later admitted that as he walked back to the dressing room, he regretted listening to Rahul Dravid.Sehwag had scored 293 runs off 254 balls, with 40 fours and 7 sixes. In the end, the world’s leading wicket-taker, Muralitharan, dismissed Sehwag with a caught-and-bowled effort.

'I HAD FIVE SIXES ON MIND'

On September 19, 2007, former India allrounder Yuvraj Singh lit up the skies over Durban with a blitzkrieg in the inaugural T20 World Cup, which became part of the cricket folklore.Facing England pacer Stuart Broad , irked by Andrew Flintoff and with an eye on Dimitri Mascarenhas midway through the over, it's a story that has so many other stories intertwined and brings about a different flavour every year when September 19 arrives.Getting hit for 6 sixes in an over is one of the most unwanted records for a bowler, while Flintoff rued getting Yuvraj pumped up with a heated argument, and Yuvi hit a six more than he was hit for as a bowler by Mascarenhas not too long ago.Talking to ICC about the historic moment in a video interview some time ago, the ODI and T20 World Cup winner mentioned an interesting conversation with Dhoni, who was Yuvraj's partner at the crease and enjoyed watching him hit all six deliveries out of the park.""After I hit the final six, MS said to me 'everytime you come out to bat after me, your strike rate is double',"" Yuvraj had revealed.Talking about his altercation with the big-frame England all-rounder, Yuvraj said: ""Freddie (Flintoff) bowled two really good balls actually and on the last ball of the 18th over, I took a single (and the two exchanged a few words after Yuvi completed the run). I was like 'I am sorry, what did you say?'""Obviously I was angry, then the umpire came in...I was so furious that I just wanted to hit every ball out of the ground,"" he added.""The first ball went out of the park. I remember hitting this one without even realising how big that hit is.""But the duo left that altercation on the field.""The great thing about Freddie is he talked about it after the game and shook hands, and that is why I have a lot of respect for Flintoff,"" Yuvraj said.After hitting Broad for sixes off five balls, Yuvraj was on the verge of history. But the southpaw had already taken his revenge and was smiling. The sixth maximum was a bonus and icing on the cake.""I had actually 5 sixes in my mind since I was hit for 5 sixes by Dimitri Mascarenhas in the final over of the 2007 Oval ODI. It was very demeaning as well. You don't want to get hit for 5 sixes. I had been in this place and getting hit for 5 sixes is not a good feeling,"" he said.""If you will see (the footage), there was a smile on my face at that moment (after hitting five sixes), and that smile was for Dimitri.""He then narrated the scenes before the final ball of Broad's over.""I was like Dimitri was standing at deep mid-wicket and Flintoff was at deep square leg. I know where he was standing. Here what happened was Broad actually switched to over the stumps at the last moment. When he did that, in my mind I was like I knew where he was going to bowl. I was ready that it was going to be a full yorker towards my legs, and I just wanted to get my bat on it.""Yuvraj's blistering innings came to an end when he was caught at long-on off the penultimate delivery of the final over, having amassed a stunning 58 runs from a mere 16 balls, including the fastest fifty at that time in just 12 balls. That record stood for 14 years, until Nepal's Dipendra Singh Airee broke it at the Asian Games last year with a 9-ball fifty in a match against Mongolia.Yuvraj's explosive knock proved decisive, as India went on to secure a 20-run victory and later won the T20 World Cup with a thrilling win over archrivals Pakistan in the final.",Yuvraj Singh hit six sixes off Stuart Broad's final over in T20 World Cup 2007. India won the match by 20 runs and went on to win the tournament. Yuvraj said he had five sixes in his mind after being hit for five by Dimitri Mascarenhas in 2007 ODI.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113475985,imgsize-34770,width-400,resizemode-4/113475985.jpg"

Bangladesh have struggled to compete with India's strong batting line-ups and bowling attacks.India's batters like Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag, and Rahul Dravid have often proven too strong for Bangladesh attack.While India have overwhelmingly dominated the rivalry, Bangladesh's improvement in the last decade has added more competitiveness to their encounters. Players like Shakib Al Hasan , Mushfiqur Rahim, and Tamim Iqbal have been key contributors for Bangladesh, and their presence has made these contests more engaging.Bangladesh will be on a high after their Test series victory against Pakistan, but former Indian cricketer Mohammad Kaif believes that the visitors don’t have it in them to stun the hosts.In an exclusive interview with TimesofIndia.com, Kaif, who played 13 Tests and 125 ODIs for India, said that the hosts are very strong in home conditions and it would be very tough for Bangladesh to throw up a surprise.On Bangladesh winning the Test series in Pakistan and their chances in India, Kaif said, ""India are very strong. Pakistan anyways are on a strong team. Bangladesh played very well in Pakistan no doubt about that but even Bangladesh know that they will have to work very hard to surprise India.""Kaif continued, ""The last time India visited Bangladesh, they lost the ODI series and Shreyas Iyer and Axar Patel batted well to save a Test, but at that time some players were missing and in home conditions with the SG ball, India would be tough to beat.""India's last Test series was at home earlier this year when they beat England 4-1 in February.“Citing the example of the England cricket team, who came to India riding high on ‘Bazball’, and even won the first Test and had thoughts of winning the series in India, even they couldn’t do that. When a team like England lost the series so easily, that proves that this Indian team is a very balanced one,"" Kaif elaborated.Turning tracks have always been the centre of attraction when it comes to Test cricket in India and this time both teams have quality spinners in their ranks.Regarding the pitches for the both Tests in Chennai and Kanpur, Kaif said, ""Both the Test matches will be played on black soil pitches having low bounce, both in Chennai and Kanpur.""Pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah is in fine form but the combination would come down to the balance between pacers and spinners in the team with workload management of the pacers in mind.On the team combination, Kaif said, ""India will definitely play three spinners in Ravichandran Ashwin Ravindra Jadeja and Kuldeep Yadav and two pacers in Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj. Kuldeep Yadav might play ahead of Axar Patel, it’s a tough call but Kuldeep is a genuine wicket-taker and his form recently has been very good.""If the Indian think tank lay out a turning track, it may backfire as Bangladesh also have fine spinners in their ranks like Shakib Al Hasan, Mehidy Hasan Miraz and Taijul Islam. Kaif said, ""The last time when England came, then India coach Rahul Dravid set an example that we will have sporting tracks, not tracks on which Tests can get over in one and a half days, ones that even viewers would enjoy, have enough in them for batsmen to score hundreds and bowlers to take 5 wickets. When Ravi Shastri was coach and Virat Kohli was captain and South Africa played a Test in Mohali, the match got over in 2-3 days. But Rahul Dravid and Rohit Sharma preferred decent tracks, that’s good for batting in the beginning, and has something in it for the spinners, like a proper Test pitch. Against England, India played on decent tracks and that’s good for the game and the fans, so that good cricket prevails. Even Ajaz Patel took 10 wickets against India on a turning track. So Dravid and Rohit have learnt that we have a strong squad so we won’t play on an unprepared or a turning pitch, so that the opposition batting collapses.""This will be the first Test assignment for Team India head coach Gautam Gambhir who replaced Dravid.Kaif continued, ""Gautam Gambhir will fully take the advice of Rohit Sharma as it will be his first Test series. So we have quality bowlers and quality batsmen. Bangladesh will have to work very hard and it’s not easy to beat India in India.""On India losing to Sri Lanka in the recent ODI series, Kaif said, ""In white ball cricket you don’t get the time to bounce back and even weak teams can beat strong teams. But in Test matches, you get two innings, so a surprise in a Test is rare. Upsets can happen frequently in white ball cricket, but this Indian Test team has very mature players. A player like Dhruv Jurel will have to sit out. So this Indian team is very good, even better than England. Rishabh Pant is back, Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli are there. This is the best Indian team and Gambhir would want that the momentum that builds here goes on till like Australia. This will be the crux of the team in Australia as well. Mohammed Shami might come in Australia in place of a spinner but there won’t be many changes. Game time for Australia starts from the Bangladesh series and players should have confidence of playing in the middle by the time they reach Down Under.""The first Test against Bangladesh starts in Chennai from Thursday and the second Test will be played in Kanpur from September 27.","India have dominated their Test rivalry against Bangladesh, winning the majority of the matches - 11 out of 13 with two ending in draws.

"India vs Bangladesh: Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja turn it around in 1st Test",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/bangladesh-in-india/india-vs-bangladesh-ravichandran-ashwin-ravindra-jadeja-turn-it-around-in-1st-test/articleshow/113508373.cms,"Veteran off-spinner scores remarkable sixth Test ton as spin duo engineers exceptional fightback with bat in hand to put India in command

CHENNAI: This is an Indian team which refuses to surrender when the tide turns against it. And when a brave, new Bangladesh looked into their eye and asked tough questions on a murky Thursday morning, two veteran warriors - Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja-had all the answers.It's not everyday that a famed Indian batting lineup gets rattled by a Bangladesh pace attack that is consistently bowling at 140 kmph. And it's not a common occurrence that an Indian counter-attack with the bat is led by an incredibly attacking Ashwin.Given the situation, the game, the sixth Test hundred that he completed with a little nudge on the leg at the fag end of the day will probably be considered Ashwin's best.The star off-spinner may well be playing his last Test match at his home ground, the MA Chidambaram Stadium . He is expected to call the shots over the weekend with the ball but he had to be called into action way ahead of schedule.Reduced to 144 for six midway through the second session, getting all out for a score of 225 seemed more than a possibility. By the end of the day, the hosts were 339 for six after losing the first two sessions and now they can control the game.When Ashwin came on to bat, the Bangladesh pacers thought they would attack him with some short stuff. Hasan Mahmud , Nahid Rana and Taskin Ahmed tried to attack his rib cage, and out came the response with the bat. The pulls and cuts caught the Bangladesh attack off-guard and suddenly the score was 200-plus, with Ashwin starting to look more and more confident.And when there's an ally of the quality of Ravindra Jadeja (batting 86), life tends to get just a little easier. At such a critical juncture of the game, the left-hander looked completely at ease and with the ball losing its lustre, run scoring suddenly became easier.The beauty of the yet unbeaten 195-run Ashwin-Jadeja partnership reminded the cricket world all over again why India have won 17 consecutive Test series at home, their last defeat coming in 2012 against England.As the Bangladesh pacers started to tire, Shakib Al Hasan, who joined the team on Tuesday, came on to bowl in the 53rd over. But the highest Bangladesh wicket-taker didn't seem to be in the right rhythm and both Ashwin and Jadeja decided to take him apart.The over-rate of the Bangladesh pacers, too, was slow and that's why after 4 pm, when the sea breeze blew across the stadium, Mahmud and Co. couldn't avail the new ball, which was available after 80 overs. It considerably eased Ashwin's job as he closed in on the century and the smile on his face said it all when the milestone was achieved.While Ashwin did run away with the glory, the game was opened up by a magnificent spell of fast bowling by Mahmud (4-58). Mahmud's ability to move the ball both ways accounted for Rohit Sharma , the Indian captain surviving a leg-before shout early on before nicking one to slip soon after.The paceman followed it up with wickets of Shubman Gill and Virat Kohli and it was left to Yashasvi Jaiswal to come up with the rescue act in the first session.A couple of days ago in the nets, the left-hander didn't have a clue where his offstump was. But he seemed to have worked on it and found a method to deal with the threat against some quality pace of Mahmud and Rana. It was Rana, who can work up a pace of 145 kmph with regularity, induced the nick off Jaiswal's bat in the second session, but by then he had made a mark.More importantly, he had played out time which had taken some of the spice out of the track which became a serious sub-plot in the Ashwin-Jadeja show.","Ravichandran Ashwin scores remarkable sixth Test ton as spin duo engineers exceptional fightback with bat in hand to put India in command.

Big hundred! Travis Head stars in Australia's massive chase to win 1st ODI against England,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/big-hundred-travis-head-stars-in-australias-massive-chase-to-win-1st-odi-against-england/articleshow/113506204.cms,"Travis Head 's exceptional unbeaten 154, his best innings in ODI cricket, propelled the depleted Australian team to a convincing seven-wicket victory against England in the series opener at Trent Bridge on Thursday.Chasing a formidable target of 316, Australia reached 317 for 3 with 36 balls remaining, extending their winning streak to 13 consecutive ODI matches against all opponents.Earlier in the match, Marnus Labuschagne emerged as an unexpected bowling hero for Australia.England appeared to be on course for an enormous total, reaching 201 for 2 after 30 overs, with Ben Duckett -- playing his first ODI as an opener -- eyeing a century at his home ground in Nottinghamshire.However, Duckett's innings came to an end on 95 when he was caught and bowled by part-time leg-spinner Labuschagne. The Australian struck again shortly after, dismissing Harry Brook -- captaining England for the first time -- in a similar manner for 39.Labuschagne, the seventh bowler utilized by the Australian skipper Mitchell Marsh, achieved his career-best ODI bowling figures of 3 for 39, contributing to England's late collapse as they lost their last six wickets for a mere 59 runs.In his 100th ODI appearance, Australia leg-spinner Adam Zampa registered impressive figures of 3 for 49.After his bowling heroics, Labuschagne contributed a quickfire 77 not out off 61 balls. He added 148 runs with Head to take the visitors home.Early in their pursuit of the target, Australia suffered a setback when Marsh fell victim to Matthew Potts.. Just three deliveries later, Head, the centurion in Australia's ODI World Cup final triumph against India the previous year, narrowly escaped being dismissed for a score of six.Head showcased his batting prowess against England's bowling attack, with his square-cut off Potts, nearly resulting in a spectacular catch by Brydon Carse at deep point. Despite Carse's valiant effort, he couldn't quite hold onto the ball after coming in too far off the boundary rope.Head continued to dominate the English bowlers, reaching his half-century in just 50 balls. He took on both the fast bowlers and the spinners with equal ease. However, Australia suffered a setback when the in-form Steve Smith, who had struck three sixes in his 32-run innings, offered a return catch to Liam Livingstone.Unfazed by the loss of his partner, Head marched on, bringing up his sixth ODI century in his 66th match. He reached the 150-run mark in style, dancing down the track to Livingstone and launching him for a massive six over long-on.The left-handed opener surpassed his previous highest ODI score of 152, which he had achieved against England in Melbourne two years earlier. Head's innings was a display of sheer brilliance, as he faced 129 deliveries, smashing 20 fours and five sixes along the way.England's innings in the opening ODI saw mixed fortunes for the hosts. Despite losing the toss, Australia made an early breakthrough when debutant Ben Dwarshuis dismissed Phil Salt for 17. However, Dwarshuis' promising spell of 1 for 18 in four overs was cut short due to a pectoral injury.The England middle-order showcased their potential, with both Duckett and Will Jacks scoring brisk half-centuries. Duckett reached his fifty off 49 balls, while Jacks achieved the milestone in 45 deliveries. The pair shared a big partnership of 120 runs in 17 overs before Jacks, on 62, fell to Adam Zampa, holing out to Smith at cover.Duckett continued his impressive innings, but his 91-ball stay at the crease, which included 11 boundaries, concluded in a tame manner when he chipped a delivery from Labuschagne back to the bowler.England's position worsened when Brook, after striking a four and a six off Labuschagne, suffered the same fate. At the end of 35 overs, England found themselves at 232 for 4.Australia entered the match with several players unavailable due to illness and injury, notably the experienced fast bowling duo of Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood.","Australia beat England by seven wickets in ODI series opener at Trent Bridge. Travis Head scores unbeaten 154, his best ODI innings. Marnus Labuschagne takes career-best ODI bowling figures of 3 for 39.

You could say that if I celebrate after taking a wicket, it will make the batter feel more upset so that's why I don't celebrate,"" he explained during a press conference, as quoted by PTI.After the day's play, Mahmud expressed his happiness about taking the wickets of prominent players like Kohli, Rohit, and later, Rishabh Pant in the second session.""I'm just happy. When you take their wickets who are the best right now, naturally one would be happy,"" Mahmud said, noting that his career has been hampered by injuries.Born into a farming family in a village near Chattogram, Mahmud is a product of Bangladesh's development programs. He has been highly praised by South African pace legend Allan Donald and former West Indies fast bowler Ottis Gibson.Both have been part of Bangladesh's coaching staff in the past. Additionally, Russell Domingo has described Mahmud's ability to swing the ball as ""god-gifted.""Mahmud showcased his talent during Bangladesh’s historic Test series win in Pakistan recently, and he delivered again on Thursday against a formidable Indian batting lineup.""I was in my zone. So, it's been very joyful, whoever's wickets you are taking, any batsman. So, it's been very good,"" he said after the day's play.""My plan was very simple. I keep the ball in shape every time and try to bowl a bit up, seam up and shape the ball out or in any time. So, I was trying that.""Mahmud advanced through the Bangladesh Cricket Board's age-group structure, starting with Chattogram Under-16 in 2015.In 2018, he joined the Bangladesh squad for the U-19 World Cup in New Zealand, finishing as the team's second-highest wicket-taker.The following year, he was selected for the U-23 squad, participating in the Emerging Teams Asia Cup and the South Asian Games.Mahmud's impressive performances in the Dhaka Premier League, Bangladesh Premier League, and Bangladesh Cricket League led to his maiden T20 International call-up against Zimbabwe in 2020. He made his One-Day International debut the following year.However, it wasn't until four years later that he made his Test debut against Sri Lanka earlier this year, where he took six wickets.When asked how he stayed motivated during the waiting period, Mahmud said, ""At that time, I used to play our first-class matches at home. So, I used to try my best there before I got the call-up.""""So, I am doing very well now. I want to keep it that way.""One remarkable aspect of Mahmud's bowling is his ability to move the ball in both directions.""I will keep trying to improve my bowling movement as much as I can. But, I want to thank everyone for helping me,"" he added.Talking about his performance in this match, Mahmud noted, ""I think during the day, from the morning, it was like the ball zipped on the wicket. Later on, the wicket got settled, and the ball was coming to the bat nicely. Still, the fast bowler is getting the zip.""""We were trying to dominate from the morning, but the wicket has improved a lot now. So, we are trying to minimize the runs and the boundary.""""The momentum was with us at one point, but now it has shifted to the other side. Anything can happen. Tomorrow, we get another chance and we will try to work on it,"" he concluded.",Hasan Mahmud took three wickets on the first day of the first Test against India. The 24-year-old bowler is making a name for himself with his skillful bowling. He has been highly praised by South African pace legend Allan Donald and former West Indies fast bowler Ottis Gibson.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113498289,imgsize-25782,width-400,resizemode-4/113498289.jpg"

There's enough in it for the quicks-good carry, good bounce if we present the seam nice and hard.""""The new ball will do a bit, and we'll have to start afresh tomorrow.

Leverkusen's impressive performance came just months after their sole defeat in an otherwise remarkable season, which saw them clinch the Bundesliga title and the German Cup.Atalanta, the team responsible for Leverkusen's Europa League final defeat in May, was held to a goalless draw by Arsenal at home, with a penalty being saved during the match.In other fixtures, Atletico Madrid secured a 2-1 win against Leipzig, while Benfica emerged victorious over Red Star Belgrade with the same scoreline. Brest, making their European competition debut, celebrated a 2-1 triumph over Sturm Graz.These matches were part of the third evening of the revamped Champions League format, which has replaced the traditional group stage.The Champions League has undergone a change in format, with 36 teams now competing against eight different opponents until January. The teams are ranked in a single league table, which determines their progression to the knockout stage.Despite his young age, Lamal has already achieved numerous scoring records for both Barcelona and Spain. He played a crucial role in Spain's victory at the European Championship this summer, becoming the youngest goalscorer in the tournament's history.However, Lamal's goal in the Champions League was not a record-breaking achievement for him. At 17 years old, he became the second-youngest scorer in the competition, narrowly missing out on the record held by his teammate Ansu Fati, who was 28 days younger when he scored his first Champions League goal in December 2019.Lamal's impressive 28th-minute equalizer showcased his skill and precision. After cutting inside from the left, he expertly placed the ball between two defenders, finding the bottom right corner of the net. His goal canceled out Maghnes Akliouche's earlier opener for the opposing team.Barcelona faced a challenging match after Eric Garcia, their defender, was sent off within the first 11 minutes of the game. Monaco capitalized on this advantage when George Ilenikhena, an 18-year-old forward, scored an impressive goal in the 71st minute.The 21-year-old Writz maintained his goal-scoring streak on Thursday in Rotterdam. After Robert Andrich intercepted a misplaced Feyenoord pass, he played the ball through to Wirtz, who charged forward and struck the ball into the bottom right corner of the net.Leverkusen increased their lead to two goals at the half-hour mark. Victor Boniface made an intelligent pass from the edge of the penalty area to Jeremie Frimpong on the right wing. Frimpong then delivered a cross that Alejandro Grimaldo slotted in at the far post.Six minutes later, Wirtz volleyed in another cross from Frimpong to further extend Leverkusen's lead.Leverkusen hardly needed any help but it was given it on the stroke of halftime when a howler by Feyenoord’s German goalkeeper Timon Wellenreuther saw him turn the ball over the line following Edmond Tapsoba’s header.Antoine Griezmann, a seasoned player at 33 years old, stood out for Atletico despite the emphasis on youth. He scored in the Champions League for the 11th consecutive season and provided the assist for Jose Maria Gimenez's dramatic headed winner. Leipzig had initially taken the lead through Benjamin Šeško in the fourth minute.Arsenal's goalkeeper, David Raya, proved to be their savior by making a double save from a penalty in the 51st minute, which was awarded after Thomas Partey fouled Ederson. Raya first denied Mateo Retegui's spot kick, but the rebound fell back to the striker. However, Raya managed to claw Retegui's header off the line in a scrambling effort.Without the injured Martin Odegaard, their primary creative player, Arsenal found it challenging to create chances in attack. They relied on their characteristically resolute defense and Raya's heroics to secure a point in Bergamo. In the upcoming round, Arsenal will face Paris Saint-Germain at home.Brest's inaugural goal in European competition was netted by midfielder Hugo Magnetti at home, but not at their usual stadium.Due to Brest's stadium failing to meet UEFA's standards, the club's European home matches were played at Guingamp's Stade de Roudourou, situated approximately 114 kilometers (71 miles) away.Brest achieved an impressive third-place finish in the French league last season. Sturm is making its first appearance in the Champions League proper in 24 years, following their successful campaign to end Salzburg's decade-long dominance of the Austrian league.Under the guidance of new coach Bruno Lage, Benfica secured their second consecutive victory, courtesy of goals from Turkish internationals Kerem Aktürkoğlu and Orkun Kokcu.Kokcu's goal was particularly impressive, as he skillfully curled a free kick into the top right corner from a distance of 25 yards.

Wing-back Saviour Gama, who made his ISL debut in the last game, is also doubtful with the knock which made him go out in the 16th minute of the first match.Odisha, meanwhile, are winless in their last five ISL away games, and have lost their last three matches. They would surely aim to break that winless run on Friday evening by improving their performance on field.""We need to learn and improve, starting with myself as the coach. We need to analyse many things, but the players need to put their focus on the next game. We need to improve a lot of things if we want to be competitive and secure top positions in the ISL,"" Lobera said ahead of the encounter.Punjab, meanwhile, will find it difficult to quickly come to terms with the absence of their inspirational captain-forward Luka Majcen, who is set to miss the action for at least 6-8 weeks with fractured jaw.Admitting that their gameplan without Majcen in the setup will be crucial in shaping up their season, PFC head coach Panagiotis Dilmperis said on the eve of the match, ""We hope that Luka recovers quickly and joins the team. He is a fighter and would have been with the team even in this situation if it was possible.""However, the Dilmperis-coached side will hope to register their second win on the trot after beating Kerala Blasters in their away opener. And if Punjab managed to do so it would be their first against Odisha. Punjab lost both the league matches to the Juggernauts last season.Hugo Boumous showed his brilliance as the creative midfielder in his debut for Odisha in the last game and Lobera will need him to live up to the billing alongside experienced senior-pros like Roy Krishna, Diego Mauricio, Mourtada Fall and Ahmed Jahouh to deliver the goods in combination with the Indian youngsters in the Juggernauts' setup.",Odisha FC take on Punjab FC at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in New Delhi.

The goal came in the 34th minute when Ronaldo connected with a close-range volley from a Nuno Mendes cross, putting his team 2-0 ahead.Overwhelmed with emotion, the Portuguese star fell to the ground, acknowledging the magnitude of the moment.Throughout his career, Ronaldo has amassed an impressive tally of goals across various clubs and the national team.His international goal count now stands at 131, while he scored 450 goals for Real Madrid, 145 for Manchester United , 101 for Juventus, and 68 for his current club Al Nassr . Additionally, he netted five goals for his first professional club, Sporting Lisbon.""It means a lot,"" Ronaldo said after Portugal's 2-1 win. ""It was a milestone I wanted to reach for a long time. I knew I would reach this number, because as I continue to play, it would happen naturally.""During the celebration, Ronaldo raised his hands to his face and dropped to his knees, visibly moved by the achievement. He later explained, ""It was emotional because it's a milestone. It seems like any other milestone, but only I know, and the people around me, how hard it is to work every day, to be physically and psychologically fit, to score 900 goals. It's a unique milestone in my career.""At the age of 39, the Portuguese star continues to showcase his goal-scoring prowess, proving that age is just a number when it comes to his exceptional abilities on the pitch.Despite speculation about his potential retirement, Ronaldo has made it clear that he still has more to offer. He has already announced that the upcoming Euro 2024 will be his final appearance in the European Championship.Jorge Andrade , a former Portuguese star, believes that Ronaldo is capable of achieving this seemingly impossible feat. Speaking at the Thinking Football Summit organized by Liga Portugal, Andrade expressed his confidence in Ronaldo's ability to score 100 more goals before retiring.

If you win, you will get this much as a bonus, and if the team wins this much extra.""The committee then decided to authorize the captain to discuss it with the player.""Rajpal refused to comment on the matter but another member of the executive committee who attended the meeting confirmed, without revealing details, that Nagal's request was agreed to.An AITA source familiar with the subject said, ""It ($50,000) is roughly Rs. 40-45 lakh for two ties in a year. So essentially, he has asked for Rs. 20 lakh per tie, which I think is fine. A (No. 1) player gets anywhere around Rs. 7 to 12 lakhs at the moment.""As a standalone figure it might seem exorbitant, but to put it in perspective, a player earned $100,000 simply for turning up in the singles first round at the US Open this year. At the French Open, a first-round appearance made a player richer by 73,000-euros.It is also understood that Nagal had requested for a change in support staff attached to the Indian Davis Cup team. It is not clear whether he wanted both Rajpal (as captain by Mahesh Bhupathi) and Zeeshan Ali (as coach by Somdev Devvarman ) to be replaced, or only the latter. Devvarman is Nagal's mentor.The AITA subsequently appointed Ashutosh Singh as coach after Ali resigned.Nagal issued a detailed statement on the subject while also responding to the attack from the AITA that he skipped the Stockholm sojourn despite being fit.""It was a difficult decision to withdraw from the Davis Cup, as playing for the national team is a moment I cherish deeply. However, after consulting with my medical team, it became clear that competing while carrying an injury could not only jeopardize my health but also adversely impact the team’s chances,"" said Nagal, who on Thursday pulled out of the ATP 250 event in Hangzhou.""In professional sports, injury management is a complex science. Sometimes, just a few days of rest and targeted rehabilitation can make the difference between aggravating an injury and being fit to play again.""Regarding compensation, I want to clarify that it is standard practice in professional sports for athletes to be compensated for their participation in events, even when representing their country.""This is not about personal gain. My discussions with AITA and the Davis Cup Captain are confidential and I would not like to indulge in any speculation about this.""","Sumit Nagal had asked to be paid $50,000 a year for playing Davis Cup.
