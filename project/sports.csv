This remarkable season marked the second time Kohli has claimed the Orange Cap, the first being in 2016 when he set a record with 973 runs.Throughout the league phase, Kohli faced scrutiny over his strike rate, prompting him to address the criticism head-on after a stellar knock against Gujarat Titans.Former New Zealand pacer Simon Doull advised Kohli to disregard the 'rubbish' criticism, while batting legend Sunil Gavaskar criticized broadcasters for repeatedly airing Kohli's on-air rant against pundits.RCB icon Dinesh Karthik , speaking on Cricbuzz, credited Doull for motivating Kohli.""I can write a book on how he was this year. He started okay but thanks to people like Simon (Doull) and a few others, they just really spurred him on. And you don't want to see that side of Virat Kohli. I think he thrives on that.

Rayudu's Previous Remarks on Virat Kohli and RCB

Rayudu's Criticism of RCB Management:



NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer Ambati Rayudu has once again courted controversy following his comments on Virat Kohli and Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) after the IPL 2024 final.Despite Kohli's stellar performance, Rayudu pointed out that the consistency of the star batter might actually burden the team, even as he emerged as the highest run-scorer in the competition.During an analysis on Star Sports, Rayudu, along with Kevin Pietersen and Mayanti Langer, discussed the impact of having a player of Kohli's caliber on a team like RCB.""When you have a stalwart and a legend like Virat Kohli, who has set really high standards, it's very hard for the youngsters to be in a side like that and try and match his standard because he always wants the team to be performing at his level.""""No, it should be good for youngsters…""""But sometimes the burden of really trying to be Virat Kohli in a sport where you know nobody is going to be like him.""""But didn't Patidar step up to the plate?""""Patidar can only be a Patidar but not a Virat Kohli, and I think RCB, as a management, understands that you cannot have 11 Virat Kohli in the team. You need to have 1 Virat Kohli with 10 others being themselves, having their own identities and strengths and weaknesses. And you need to use them well in terms of resources. You can't expect somebody to win the game in the first season. You need to give him that leeway and time to grow into a match-winner. So I think the management has its task out, and even Virat Kohli needs to ease his standards a bit when it comes to youngsters, nurturing them, and letting them grow.""Earlier, in his congratulatory message to the Shreyas Iyer-led KKR, Rayudu subtly criticized RCB, emphasizing that individual accolades like the Orange Cap do not guarantee IPL titles, but rather it is the collective contributions from the entire team that lead to success.""Congratulations to the KKR team for really standing up for stalwarts like Narine, Russell, and Starc, and also contributing their share in the team's win. That’s how a team wins the IPL. We have seen this over the years. It's not the Orange Cap that wins you the IPL but it is the contributions like 300 runs each (from many players),"" Rayudu remarked.Kohli had an outstanding individual season, winning the Orange Cap with 741 runs in 15 innings, including one hundred and five fifties, at an average of 61.75 and a strike rate of over 154. Despite his impressive performance, RCB once again fell short of the title.This isn't the first time Rayudu has criticized RCB. Following their exit from IPL 2024 after a loss to Rajasthan Royals in the Eliminator, Rayudu took to X to express his thoughts. He pointed out the shortcomings in RCB's management and leadership, suggesting that prioritizing individual milestones over team interests has hindered their success.""My heart truly goes out to all the RCB supporters who have passionately supported the team over the years. If only the management and the leaders had the team's interests ahead of individual milestones, RCB would have won multiple titles. Just remember how many fantastic players have been let go of. Force your management to bring players who will put team interests first.

If Gambhir was still at Lucknow this year, there was no way that Narine would have opened the batting.""Moody emphasized that Gambhir's clarity and stability brought significant positive changes to KKR, addressing the confusion and inconsistency that had plagued the team in previous seasons.""A lot of things have just worked perfectly for KKR this year, in a positive way. I think Gambhir should be given a huge amount of credit for his impact as a leader. He has created stability and clarity that is the most important thing,"" Moody added.Robin Uthappa , a former teammate of Gambhir, also praised his leadership on JioCinema.""One of the things that he does as a leader is defining roles. He creates a sense and a feeling of security within the group. He defines the roles very clearly to each player. Everyone feels included, and you create a support staff that takes care of everybody. Honestly, there is no rocket science to this, and a lot of successful teams have done this. We have seen Mumbai Indians and CSK do this, and KKR, when they do this right, it actually works for them,"" Uthappa remarked.Uthappa noted that Gambhir's absence in recent years had seen the team lose its way, but his return brought back the successful strategies from his captaincy days.""Now he is doing it as a mentor, and you can see the fruits of all that work that he has put in,"" Uthappa added.Gambhir's return as mentor has evidently paid off, as KKR's 2024 IPL triumph underscores the importance of strong leadership and strategic clarity in achieving success. His ability to define roles, create a supportive environment, and maintain a clear direction has been instrumental in KKR's resurgence, earning him widespread acclaim within the cricketing community.",Kolkata Knight Riders clinched their third Indian Premier League title in 2024.

This unexpected defeat has left fans questioning whether the 14-time champion will return to the Grand Slam he has dominated for two decades.The 22-time major champion, who first claimed the Musketeers' Cup in 2005 and last lifted the trophy in 2022 before a serious hip injury disrupted his career, had hinted that this year might be his final one on the tour.Having returned to the tournament that he skipped in 2023 and refusing to confirm any farewells ahead of his opener, Nadal showed flashes of top form again on Court Philippe Chatrier but the 37-year-old ultimately went down fighting.Victory meant Zverev became only the third man to beat Nadal at Roland Garros , after Novak Djokovic and Robin Soderling, with the German banishing memories of his retirement due to an ankle injury when the duo last met in the 2022 semi-finals.Nadal was broken by in-form Rome champion Zverev in the opening game and surrendered his serve again late on to drop the first set in unfavourable conditions for him with the roof closed due to heavy rain.Faced with the prospect of only his fourth Roland Garros defeat in 116 matches, Nadal made a positive start to the next set as he leapt and pumped his fists after holding for 2-2 and broke for the first time with a delicate drop.The crowd began to sense a comeback as Nadal went ahead 4-2 with some vintage shots on both flanks but the steely Zverev hit back in the 10th game and saved two breakpoints before doubling his advantage by edging a high-octane tiebreak.Watched on by his great rival Djokovic and a host of other current players, Nadal surged to a 2-0 lead in the third set but squandered it as Zverev drew level and dealt another body blow in the seventh game.The boisterous crowd tried their best to roar Nadal on but Zverev held his nerve to clinch a famous victory that could well prove to be the springboard he needs to push for an elusive first Grand Slam title.","Rafa Nadal suffers his earliest exit from the French Open on Monday.

NEW DELHI: When Kolkata Knight Riders mentor Gautam Gambhir bought Australian left-arm speedster Mitchell Starc for a record-shattering sum of Rs 24.75 crore in the December auction last year, fans and even pundits were absolutely stunned.And after a jittery start to the season, where Starc was taken to the cleaners in almost every league game, trolling and memes followed Gambhir and KKR alongside Starc.But as the tournament progressed the 34-year-old regained his lost rhythm and in the playoffs produced a couple of sensational performances, shutting down every critique.After flooring Sunrisers Hyderabad in Qualifier 1, Starc once again roared with a mind-boggling performance against the same opposition in the IPL Final on Sunday.And with pacer having a memorable night in the final, mentor Gambhir too was hailed by everyone for his belief in Starc.What started as a tease and fun turned into appreciation and respect as Gambhir was lauded for his choice during the IPL auction.In the final on Sunday, left-arm quick Starc returned figures of 2 for 14 while fellow quicks Andre Russell and Harshit Rana shared five wickets between them to dismiss the Sunrisers for a lowly 113 in 18.3 overs at Chennai's MA Chidambaram Stadium.It was the lowest total in an IPL final after Chennai Super Kings' previous low of 125-9 in their loss to Mumbai Indians in 2013.KKR, then hunted down the total inside 11 overs to clinch their third IPL title, beating SRH by eight wickets in Chennai.Venkatesh Iyer remained not out on 52 off 26 balls, taking his side across the finish line.Starc, Andre Russell (3/19) and Harshit Rana (2/24) were the most successful bowlers for the Knight Riders, as SRH simply failed to turn up for the big game.Opting to bat first, SRH were off to a disastrous start as they lost their top guns Abhishek Sharma and Travis Head with just six runs on the board, with the latter getting dismissed for a first-ball duck to a beautiful outswinger.Before that, Abhishek was bowled by Mitchell Starc on the fifth ball of the first over, a peach of a delivery opening up the left-hander before hitting the top of the off stump.SRH were in all sorts of trouble as Starc accounted for the wicket of Rahul Tripathi to leave them reeling at 21/3 in the fifth over, the swing doing the trick for KKR bowlers early on.First-change bowler Harshit Rana continued the good work and got rid of Nitish Reddy (13). Andre Russell dismissed Aiden Markram in his first over as SRH slipped to 62/5 in the 11th over.SRH could not recover from there.Sunrisers Hyderabad: 113 all out in 18.3 overs (Pat Cummins 24; Mitchell Starc 2/14, Andre Russell 3/19, Harshit Rana 2/24).Kolkata Knight Riders: 114 for 2 in 10.3 overs (Venkatesh Iyer 52 not out).",Kolkata Knight Riders beat Sunrisers Hyderabad by eight wickets in IPL final.

Former England captain Michael Vaughan has blasted the England cricket board for its decision to call players back from the Indian Premier League (IPL) for the T20I series against Pakistan.The decision by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has been hugely debated since England players Will Jacks (Royal Challengers Bengaluru), Phil Salt (Kolkata Knight Riders) and Jos Buttler (Rajasthan Royals) and the rest were ordered to return for international duty.Buttler, Salt and Jacks would have featured in the IPL playoffs , which Vaughan and former Australia captain Adam Gilchrist believe is a ""missed opportunity"". Instead they were called back in time for the first T20I against Pakistan on May 22 in Headingley, which incidentally got washed out by rain.""I think England missed a trick by sending all their players home,"" said Vaughan on the 'Club Prairie Fire' podcast. ""I think Will Jacks, Phil Salt, Jos Buttler in particular, playing in the IPL in the eliminations (playoffs), pressure, crowd, expectation, I would argue that playing here is better preparation than playing a T20 game against Pakistan.""Vaughan went on to specify that he is not asking to put club cricket ahead of international duty and that his comment is based on the comparison between the pressure of playing in the IPL playoffs and in a T20 international from the point of view of preparing for the upcoming T20 World Cup in June.""I am all for international cricket, but...this tournament (IPL) in particular is so exposed to pressure...players are under a huge amount of pressure from fans, owners, social media; it's massive,"" said the former batsman.""I just felt Buttler, probably not as much but I still think he could have stayed here, but Will Jacks and Phil Salt, I think they would have been better prepared (for the T20 World Cup) staying here and playing in the IPL than going back to Headingley to play a (T20I) game.""I am not disrespecting Pakistan or the England side. They haven't been playing a lot of T20 cricket together but I would say the standard here (IPL) would possibly be better...,"" Vaughan added.Gilchrist, who was also part of the podcast episode, concurred with Vaughan's opinion.""I am sure there are a number of (England) players who could have fulfilled those obligations (for T20I series against Pakistan) in the international setup there, but the guys that were actively involved in the IPL, in the finals period (should have stayed back). I think that's a missed opportunity, spot on,"" said Gilchrist.The IPL final will be played between Kolkata Knight Riders and Sunrisers Hyderabad on Sunday in Chennai, which will be followed by the T20 World Cup beginning on June 2 in the US and West Indies.","Former England captain Michael Vaughan has blasted the England cricket board for its decision to call players back from the Indian Premier League.

When I wasn't in the team and rehabbing, I had a lot of time to think about my game and work on myself.""Thankfully I'm back now, and the World Cup is coming up.""Rauf's return at Edgbaston could not prevent Pakistan suffering a 23-run defeat by England as they fell 1-0 behind in the four-match series with two to play following a washed-out opener.But Rauf insisted Pakistan, the 2009 T20 world champions, remained in optimistic mood ahead of their opening match at this year's global showpiece against co-hosts the United States in Dallas on June 6.""When you lose a game it hurts, but as a team, we are confident,"" he said. ""We feel we can beat any opposition on any day. We've done it in the past, too. When you make mistakes you learn and try not to repeat those mistakes. We're looking to play better in the next few games and make a comeback.""The camp is relaxed. We're enjoying ourselves. We're trying to follow our game-plans and execute them well. The results haven't often been in our favour recently but if you stick to your plans they can sometimes follow.""",Pakistan fast bowler Haris Rauf returns from shoulder injury ahead of T20 World Cup. The 30-year-old claimed a couple of wickets in his comeback match against England.

After 15 years of service, the wicketkeeper-batter had formally parted ways with Cricket Association of Bengal ( CAB ) on July 2, 2022 after an official questioned his commitment towards Bengal cricket. Saha operated as player cum mentor of the Tripura senior side for two years.The CAB has been trying to bring the former Test wicketkeeper back to Bengal for a long time. It now seems that Saha has agreed to return after meeting former India skipper Sourav Ganguly at his residence on Monday afternoon. Although neither Saha nor the CAB have made any formal announcement, it was learnt that talks with Ganguly have helped break the ice.Just days back, left-handed batter Sudip Chatterjee also decided to return to Bengal after two seasons with Tripura. The former Bengal vice-captain will be playing in the upcoming Bengal Pro T20 league also.Saha was also finding it difficult to stay away from family for a longer period of time.

NEW DELHI: Will Jacks is keen to apply the on-field "" coaching "" he received from Virat Kohli during the IPL to help England retain their T20 World Cup title next month. Jacks heads into the third game of England's warm-up series against Pakistan on the back of a pivotal 37-run contribution that propelled England to a 23-run victory at Edgbaston.The Surrey all-rounder demonstrated his power-hitting prowess, recently smashing an unbeaten century off just 41 balls, including 28 runs from one Rashid Khan over, while playing for Royal Challengers Bangalore against Gujarat Titans. Kohli, who was batting at the other end, provided valuable insights.""The big thing with the IPL is that every game is such an occasion, the crowd, the atmosphere,"" Jacks shared with reporters. ""Every game you feel like you've got to step up, and that's similar to international cricket.""Reflecting on his experience with Kohli, Jacks said, ""He's a very good role model. The way he approaches all the training and every aspect of the game off the field, his intensity, everything he does is 100 percent attention. He's done it for such a long time, and I can appreciate that as a young guy who often doesn't want to do the hard yards, but you see him doing it and want to copy that.""Jacks emphasized the learning experience, ""When we were batting together, he was coaching me through there. I learned some valuable things about chasing in that innings and pacing the game, which was really helpful. I was really proud of the way I stayed in the partnership and didn't throw it away.""With limited international experience—two Tests, seven ODIs, and 12 T20s—Jacks is eager for the upcoming global tournament. ""Playing in a World Cup is something I've dreamed of since I was a little kid. I'm really excited to do it. It's getting closer now, and we're building in the right direction.""Regarding his T20 record of 218 runs at an average of 18.16, Jacks acknowledged it as a ""mixed bag."" He has been alternating between opening the innings and batting at number three. ""I've probably opened half my games and batted number three in the other half,"" he noted. ""It's no lie that I'm new to batting at three, I'm learning on the job.""Jacks added, ""I've been getting starts every game, and it's about how do I change those into match-winning scores. That's more of a mindset thing. It doesn't matter what I'm averaging: if the team's winning, then it's good.""",Will Jacks is keen to apply the coaching he received from Virat Kohli during the IPL to help England retain their T20 World Cup title next month.

Cristiano Ronaldo sets new Saudi Pro League season goal-scoring record,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/cristiano-ronaldo-sets-new-saudi-pro-league-season-goal-scoring-record/articleshow/110481207.cms,"(Inputs from AP)

NEW DELHI: Cristiano Ronaldo concluded the Saudi Pro League season by establishing a new goal-scoring record on Monday. In Riyadh, Ronaldo found the back of the net twice as Al-Nassr secured a 4-2 victory over Al-Ittihad, bringing his league goal tally to 35, surpassing the previous record of 34 set by Abderrazak Hamdallah in 2019.In the closing moments of the first half, Ronaldo, who had already seen two goals disallowed for offside, brought down a long pass from Mohammed Al-Fatil with his chest and scored with a low shot from the left side of the area. With 21 minutes left to play, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner celebrated enthusiastically after heading in a corner from Marcelo Brozovic . Five minutes later, he was substituted off the field to a standing ovation from the home supporters.Ronaldo's season was filled with notable moments, including four hat tricks and one red card. He also faced a suspension in February for making an obscene gesture towards Al-Shabab fans who had been chanting the name of his long-time soccer rival, Lionel Messi.Al-Nassr secured a second-place finish in the league, trailing local rival Al-Hilal by 14 points. Al-Hilal clinched the championship more than two weeks ago and completed the 34-round league undefeated on Monday. Even without the services of Neymar, who joined the club in August from Paris Saint-Germain but suffered a season-ending ACL injury in October, Al-Hilal proved to be a formidable force.Aleksandar Mitrovic , signed from London club Fulham last summer, stepped up and concluded the season with a goal in the final seconds, sealing a 2-1 win over Al-Wehda. The Serbian striker finished with 27 league goals, second only to Ronaldo. Al-Hilal's title-winning campaign included a 34-game winning streak across all competitions, setting a new world record for a top-tier team.""This season has been truly exceptional for the team, arguably our best ever,"" coach Jorge Jesus said. ""The credit goes to the immense talent within the squad and the incredible sense of unity that transcends both on and off-field interactions.""Al-Ittihad's loss to Al-Nassr capped off a disappointing season for the defending champion. Karim Benzema, acquired from Real Madrid, struggled with injuries, and despite the presence of N'Golo Kante and Fabinho in midfield, signed from Chelsea and Liverpool respectively, the Jeddah-based team could only manage a fifth-place finish. Poor results led to the dismissal of coach Nuno Santo in November, who returned to the English Premier League a month later to take charge of Nottingham Forest.Al-Ahli, the fourth of the 'Big Four' clubs acquired by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund last June, secured a third-place finish, 17 points behind Al-Nassr. Al-Ahli defeated Al-Fayha 1-0, courtesy of a late goal from former Liverpool forward Roberto Firmino, his ninth of the season.Amid various storylines, Ronaldo dominated the headlines, and the 39-year-old still has one more opportunity to end the season with a trophy when Al-Nassr faces Al-Hilal in the King's Cup final on Friday.","Cristiano Ronaldo scores twice as Al-Nassr beats Al-Ittihad 4-2 in Saudi Pro League.

NEW DELHI: Southampton secured promotion back to the Premier League after a one-year absence, with Adam Armstrong 's decisive goal leading to a 1-0 victory against Leeds in the Championship play-off final on Sunday.Armstrong's first-half strike at Wembley erased the disappointment of last year's relegation from the top flight, ensuring Southampton's immediate return.Winning football's most lucrative match will bring Southampton an estimated £140 million ($178 million) boost, thanks to the increased matchday, broadcast, and commercial revenues associated with the Premier League.According to financial experts Deloitte, Southampton could ultimately earn up to £305 million if they manage to avoid relegation next season.While the cash prize is a huge bonus, it is the prestige of competing with Manchester City and Arsenal, rather than second-tier minnows like Plymouth and Oxford, that fuelled Southampton's hunger to regain their Premier League status after a year in purgatory.Southampton, whose only major honour is the 1976 FA Cup, had spent 11 years in the Premier League prior to their relegation.They will hope this success, celebrated by over 35,000 of their fans at Wembley, is the prelude to another lengthy spell among the elite.In their first ever play-off final, Southampton made it three wins over Leeds this term despite finishing three points behind the Elland Road club in the regular season.Saints boss Russell Martin has become widely admired for his purist passing principles and this was the 38-year-old's crowning glory.Martin was managing in League One with Milton Keynes Dons just three years ago, but he has transformed Southampton in his first season in charge, to such an extent that they boasted more possession than any team in Europe's top five leagues this season.Securing promotion at Leeds boss Daniel Farke's expense was a sweet moment for Martin after his Norwich contract was terminated by the German during their time together at Carrow Road in 2018.Defeat was a bitter blow for Farke and Leeds, who were relegated alongside Southampton last season.American socialite Paris Hilton and movie star Will Ferrell -- a minority shareholder in the club -- had made good luck videos for Farke's side, but there was no Hollywood ending for Leeds.On the 35th anniversary of the death of their legendary manager Don Revie, Leeds were well below their best in the club's fourth play-off final loss.After losing their grip on an automatic promotion place that went instead to Ipswich, the three-time English champions remain without a win at Wembley since 1992.With Rain Man actor Dustin Hoffman watching from the stands, it was fitting that the heavens opened over Wembley as a torrential downpour hit just before kick-off.Leeds made a fast start but Southampton weathered the storm and as the sun appeared through the clouds, they gradually took control.Will Smallbone threatened to put Southampton ahead with a 30-yard free-kick that was clawed away by Illan Meslier.It was a warning Leeds failed to heed as Southampton snatched the lead with a clinical raid in the 24th minute.Armstrong had scored twice in the play-off semi-final win over West Brom and the striker showcased his predatory instincts again with his 24th goal this season.Cleverly eluding the Leeds offside trap with a well-timed run, Armstrong met Smallbone's pass with a superb strike into the far corner from 12 yards.Leeds were rocked and Armstrong nearly struck again from another instinctive shot from Smallbone's quick free-kick, but this time Meslier was able to parry his close-range effort.Early in the second half, Leeds defender Joe Rodon embarked on a rampaging run that looked certain to end in a goal until Taylor Harwood-Bellis threw himself into a last-ditch block.Leeds pushed hard for an equaliser, but Daniel James' blast cannoned back off the bar before the winger was denied by Alex McCarthy's stoppage-time save as Southampton celebrated their return to the promised land.",Southampton beat Leeds 1-0 in the Championship play-off final at Wembley. Adam Armstrong scored the only goal of the game in the first half. Southampton will return to the Premier League after a one-year absence. Leeds were relegated from the top flight last season.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110443921,imgsize-262258,width-400,resizemode-4/110443921.jpg"
