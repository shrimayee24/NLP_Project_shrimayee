Poll Do you think PM Modi's comparison of cricket to Operation Sindoor was appropriate? Yes, it was an appropriate analogy No, it was inappropriate

NEW DELHI: A day after the Indian cricket team won the Asia Cup Championship, political row erupted over PM Modi 's congratulatory remarks, with Congress terming the Operation Sindoor mention ""inappropriate"".Soon after the win, PM Modi posted on X last night saying, ""#OperationSindoor on the games field. Outcome is the same - India wins! Congrats to our cricketers.""The post drew flak from Congress, with Pawan Khera writing a direct post to PM Modi saying, ""Prime Minister, firstly, comparing a cricket match to a battlefield is not appropriate."" Further taking a jibe at the PM and indirectly hinting at Trump's repeated ceasefire claims, Khera added, ""Secondly, if you must make such a comparison, you need to learn from the Indian team that when you’re close to victory, good captains don’t call for a ceasefire just because a third umpire says so. ""This was the latest in series of back and forth among politicians. Earlier in the day, other Congress leaders had also taken jabs at the Prime minister. """"Sometimes I doubt if PM Modi has any knowledge of foreign policy and diplomacy. If we played, we should have played with sportsman spirit,"" Atul Londhe Patil told news agency PTI. """"If Operation Sindoor is ongoing, then we shouldn't have played. And if discussions are ongoing to normalise the situation, then sports can be a medium to improve it, but linking everything with Operation Sindoor is not right,"" Patil added.Maharashtra Congress president Harshvardhan Sakpal also reacted to the Prime Minister’s post. He said: “It is clear from his tweet that, be it air, water, or sports, he brings politics into everything to polarise. We take pride in India’s victory, but we haven't won the Asia Cup for the first time. There is a certain dignity of a country which he doesn't maintain, and I regret this.”Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi has criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for linking India’s Asia Cup victory over Pakistan with Operation Sindoor, warning that tournament proceeds could be diverted to fund terror activities across the border. Speaking to ANI, Chaturvedi had said that the Asia Cup games between India and Pakistan “should not have happened” in the first place, questioning why India chose to play Pakistan despite its stated “zero tolerance for terror” policy. “In the first place, this match should not have happened. The cricket match that BCCI played for the benefit of PCB... the match that took place for the revenue of the broadcasters. The 140 crore people of the country did not want this match to happen,"" she added.Also read: Congress slams PM Modi's post after India's Asia Cup win; row over playing match On the other hand, BJP had also taken jabs at Congress for not making a statement on India's win.

Braelon Allen injury adds to Jets’ offensive concerns



What’s next for Braelon Allen and the Jets



The New York Jets were dealt an early setback on Monday Night Football when running back Braelon Allen exited with a knee injury in the second quarter against the Miami Dolphins. The rookie went down after taking a hard hit during a kickoff return and was quickly escorted to the medical tent before limping to the locker room. Moments later, the Jets officially ruled him out for the rest of the game.Allen’s night had started with promise. Before the injury, he carried the ball four times for 26 yards, showing flashes of power and patience. However, the momentum shifted when he lost a costly fumble at the goal line on New York’s opening drive. “As Braelon Allen ran off the field after the fumble, Aaron Glenn grabbed both sides of his helmet to console him and give him words of encouragement,” sideline reporter Katie George noted during the ESPN broadcast.The emotional toll was clear. “Allen then spent a lot of time pacing, sitting and standing alone. He was obviously gutted to lose the ball at the goal line. Now, he’s in some physical pain, as they look at his left knee in the injury tent,” George added.For the Jets, Allen’s absence leaves the backfield thinner than planned. With Breece Hall already carrying the bulk of the offense, Isaiah Davis is now expected to step into a larger role.The team will need both to stay sharp if they hope to keep pace in the AFC East.The concern now extends beyond Week 4. A knee injury severe enough to sideline Allen immediately raises questions about his availability moving forward. In the first three games of the season, the 20-year-old logged 14 carries for 50 yards and a touchdown, carving out a role behind Hall.The Jets will await further testing to determine the severity of the injury. Losing Allen for an extended stretch would not only hurt New York’s depth but also slow the development of a rookie who was beginning to find his rhythm in the league.Also Read: Jake Browning’s fiancée Stephanie Niles turns heads with her unusual Bengals look ahead of Broncos clash",New York Jets running back Braelon Allen suffered a knee injury in the second quarter against the Miami Dolphins.

Poll Do you think India should have accepted the trophy from Mohsin Naqvi? Yes, it was just a formality No, a neutral official should present it

A video that surfaced on social media showed Asian Cricket Council (ACC) chief and Pakistan minister Mohsin Naqvi leaving the stadium in protest after India refused to accept the Asia Cup 2025 trophy and winners’ medals from his hands.Naqvi, who is also the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief, had waited on the podium for the post-match presentation. However, the Indian team, led by Suryakumar Yadav, refused to receive the trophy or medals, requesting that a neutral official hand them over instead.After discussions failed to resolve the situation, Naqvi walked off the stage. Officials were later seen taking the trophy away from the podium as well. The video brought to light the tense and unexpected moment, which brought the post-match ceremony to a halt.Speaking at the post-match press conference, India captain Suryakumar Yadav expressed disbelief at the incident. “This is one thing which I have never seen since I started playing cricket, started following cricket—a champion team is denied a trophy, that too a hard-earned one,” he said.“I feel we deserved it. And I can't say anything more. If you tell me about trophies, mine are sitting in the dressing room, all 14 guys with me, the support staff—those are the real trophies throughout this journey in the Asia Cup.”The BCCI has decided to lodge a formal protest with the International Cricket Council (ICC) against Naqvi’s actions. Despite the controversy, the Indian players celebrated their historic win on the field, even without the trophy in hand.On the pitch, India clinched clinched the 2025 Asia Cup title with a thrilling five-wicket victory over Pakistan. Riding on Tilak Varma’s unbeaten 69 off 53 balls and a vital 33 from Shivam Dube, India chased down a target of 147 with two balls to spare.Earlier, Pakistan had posted 146 all out in 19.1 overs, despite solid contributions from Sahibzada Farhan (57) and Fakhar Zaman (46). Indian spinners Kuldeep Yadav (4/30), Varun Chakravarthy (2/30), and Axar Patel (2/26) triggered a collapse that saw Pakistan lose their last nine wickets for just 33 runs. Jasprit Bumrah also chipped in with 2/25.This marked India’s third win over Pakistan in this edition of the tournament, following victories in the league and Super Fours stages. While the trophy controversy overshadowed the post-match proceedings, the Indian team’s performance on the field was a clear statement of dominance.","India beat Pakistan by five wickets in the 2025 Asia Cup cricket final.

Who is Gianna Carmona? The model and TikTok star linked to Justin Fields

The alleged love story: How the dating rumors started between Justin Fields and Gianna Carmona

New York Jets quarterback Justin Fields has long been in the spotlight for his career highs and struggles in the NFL. But in recent months, attention has shifted toward his personal life, with rumors linking him to Gianna Carmona, a fashion model, influencer, and former college volleyball player. While neither of them has confirmed their relationship, fans and media outlets continue to speculate about the pair.Gianna Carmona, 21, is carving her own path as a lifestyle and fashion influencer. With 15.3K followers on Instagram (@giannacarmona) and more than 27K fans on TikTok (@giannacarmona_), she frequently shares bold, stylish content that resonates with a younger audience. Raised in Silver Spring, Maryland, Gianna comes from a close-knit family with her parents, Norberto Carmona and Annie Franco, as well as two siblings, Xavier and Sasha.Sports also run deep in her family. Her cousin, Jioranni Rodriguez, once played football at Towson University, and Gianna herself competed as an outside hitter/middle blocker for the Towson Tigers volleyball team. That athletic background may explain why she seems so comfortable in NFL circles.Speculation about Fields and Carmona’s connection first surfaced in March 2023 after the two reportedly vacationed in Turks and Caicos.The rumors picked up when Gianna was spotted at NFL games for both the Chicago Bears and Pittsburgh Steelers — two of the teams Fields has previously played for. While neither has addressed the whispers, fans have not missed the subtle social media overlaps, often tagging Fields in Carmona’s posts.Fields, who signed a two-year, $40 million contract with the Jets in the 2025 offseason, is heading into what many analysts call a “make-or-break” year. Coming off a concussion in Week 3, he is set to return against the Miami Dolphins under the bright lights of Monday Night Football.

Jake Browning faces big test for Bengals against Broncos



Jake Browning has a career-defining chance under the lights of Monday Night Football as the Cincinnati Bengals face the Denver Broncos. While the quarterback is preparing for the pressure of the Mile High atmosphere, his fiancée Stephanie Niles is grabbing attention of her own with a bold Bengals-inspired game-day look. Even though she didn’t travel to Denver, her presence is felt as she continues to be one of the most visible supporters of the Bengals’ new starter.While Jake Browning prepares for the Broncos, Niles has become a story of her own. Raised in Shanghai before moving to Seattle in 2005, she later met Browning at the University of Washington in 2018. A business-minded professional, she earned her degree in informational systems and accounting, worked in New York for an accounting firm, and even co-founded a swimsuit brand called 7th Street Swim.Her fashion-forward approach has made her a standout on Bengals’ game days. From her custom “6” gear to her latest fit she proudly described as “proud of this one,” Niles has embraced her role in the spotlight. Off the field, she has worn many hats, from project management to finance roles, always balancing career ambitions with her personal journey alongside Browning.The couple’s bond has only grown stronger. Browning proposed in Malibu in November 2024, with Niles sharing her joy in a heartfelt post, “HAPPILY EVER AFTER!!!!!!! 💍💍💍💍.”Now, as Browning takes the field in one of his biggest tests yet, Niles’ unwavering support continues to be part of his story.The 29-year-old quarterback was thrust into the spotlight after Joe Burrow went down with a long-term turf toe injury. Browning delivered a win in his first outing but stumbled badly in last week’s loss to the Minnesota Vikings, throwing five interceptions in just two games. Now, against Denver’s aggressive defense, he must prove he can settle in and lead an offense under enormous pressure.Despite his shaky start, Browning has shown resilience before. His college years at Washington made him a star, but his NFL path was anything but easy. After going undrafted, he bounced around with the Minnesota Vikings before finally landing with Cincinnati in 2023.

Shedeur Sanders earns fan love despite Rex Ryan’s criticism



Pilar Sanders’ powerful Instagram message goes viral



Shedeur Sanders has many admirers across the NFL , but none stand taller in his corner than his family. So when ESPN analyst and former New York Jets head coach Rex Ryan publicly criticized the Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback, it was only a matter of time before Shedeur’s mother, Pilar Sanders, came forward with a fiery response.Deion Sanders’ son is already one of the league’s most popular young players, with Browns fans eagerly buying his jersey and hoping he eventually replaces veteran Joe Flacco. While head coach Kevin Stefanski seems more inclined to test rookie Dillon Gabriel, much of the fanbase sees Shedeur as the future. That optimism, however, clashed with Ryan’s blunt remarks on ESPN’s Get Up.“This kid talks and he runs his mouth,” Ryan said, mocking Shedeur’s confidence. “Like he said, ‘I can be a starting quarterback’ with his arms crossed like this. Get your ass in the front row and study and do all that. If I know, the whole league knows. Quit being an embarrassment that way. You’ve got the talent to be the quarterback, you should be. You should be embarrassed that you’re not the quarterback now.”Ryan’s words quickly made waves, but Pilar Sanders wasted no time striking back with passion.Pilar took to Instagram to defend her son, sharing a scathing post aimed directly at Ryan. “To young Athletes and Football fans... This is what impotent, cancerous, envious energy looks like,” she wrote. “This type of Evile [sic] goes waaay back – you can cut it with a knife – embedded in blood and bones seeping through all of the rotting worm holes [sic] it has. What and who does he really represent? Its’ family and peers should be embarrassed to know and let this on their platforms. There's no room for this type in sports. Please 🤫... Tsk tsk tsk... Enuff!”She followed with a simple caption: “Sad…”Her words struck a chord, resonating with fans who believe Shedeur deserves patience and support rather than public ridicule. The episode also highlighted how fiercely protective his family remains, especially as he battles to carve out his place in the NFL spotlight.Stay tuned, because as this back-and-forth shows, criticizing Shedeur Sanders might just unleash a storm. And if there’s one lesson here, it’s clear: never underestimate a mother’s defense of her son.Also Read: “Having heart failure”: Giants fan defends herself after viral backlash for taking Patrick Mahomes’ headband from young boy","Shedeur Sanders is the Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback.

The Kansas City Chiefs’ road victory against the New York Giants on September 21 at MetLife Stadium made headlines for more than just the game. A post-game moment involving Patrick Mahomes , a young fan, and an adult Giants supporter has spiraled into one of the season’s most talked-about viral controversies.After the game, Patrick Mahomes was spotted greeting fans and appeared to hand his game-worn headband to a 10-year-old Chiefs supporter who was celebrating his birthday. However, in a video that spread rapidly across social media, Nina Miller, a Giants fan wearing team gear, was seen taking the headband before the child could secure it.The clip drew immediate outrage, with fans dubbing her the “Kansas City Karen.” Internet sleuths quickly tracked Miller’s social accounts, uncovering a now-deleted video where she bragged about the keepsake. This fueled the perception that the act was intentional and not a misunderstanding.Amid mounting backlash, Miller posted a TikTok video on September 27, claiming the moment was chaotic. “Everyone is having heart failure over this,” she said, emphasizing that fans from multiple rows had rushed the front.She argued that she “paid for” her seat and didn’t realize the headband was meant for the boy.In a follow-up video the next day, Miller softened her tone, explaining, “At the game, with all the noise and all the excitement, I honestly thought that Pat Mahomes was giving me the headband. I reached for it without thinking.” She admitted later learning it was intended for the young fan’s birthday and added, “I’m sorry that I ruined your moment.

Back in 2018, Charlie Kirk — the outspoken founder of Turning Point USA — used his national platform to lash out at Taylor Swift after the pop star broke her silence on politics. Years later, his assassination in 2025 has reframed those moments as part of his long history of targeting cultural icons like Swift and, more recently, her fiancé Travis Kelce Taylor Swift shocked fans in October 2018 when she endorsed Democrat Phil Bredesen for Senate in Tennessee and spoke out against Republican candidate Marsha Blackburn, saying her record “appalls and terrifies me.” She urged fans to register to vote and added, “I always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights I believe we all deserve in this country.”Kirk, then just 24, appeared on Fox and Friends to undermine Swift’s words. “I don’t want to accuse her of this, but I don’t think she’s the only one who wrote that post on Instagram. She probably got some very bad information,” he said, suggesting she wasn’t capable of forming her own opinions. He also accused her of turning away from her brand, saying, “This is what I used to love about Taylor Swift is she stayed away from politics — she was all about music, all about female empowerment. ”On Twitter, Kirk went further, writing, “You have absolutely no idea what you are talking about.Your career has never recovered since Kanye ended it.”That early clash foreshadowed Kirk’s later attacks. In 2025, after Swift’s engagement to Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce, Kirk once again went after her, this time urging her to “submit to your husband Taylor” and mocking her career by saying he couldn’t wait for a “Taylor Kelce concert.” His remarks drew widespread backlash as sexist and bizarre, reinforcing how frequently he used Swift as a cultural punching bag.Also Read: “She ain’t Mother Mary”: Charlie Kirk’s more attacks on Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce resurfaces after his shocking assassination Now, with Charlie Kirk assassinated at a Utah campus event in 2025, those old comments resurface as part of his legacy, one built on provocative culture-war battles. His criticisms of Taylor Swift and even her relationship with Travis Kelce reveal just how much he saw her influence as a political threat.

Joe Burrow’s injury update and timeline for return



Impact on Bengals’ season and playoff chances without Joe Burrow



The Cincinnati Bengals are once again staring at uncertainty after quarterback Joe Burrow suffered a severe turf toe injury that required surgery. The timing could not be worse, as the team’s playoff hopes now hang in the balance while their franchise player faces an extended recovery.Joe Burrow went down in Week 2 against the Jacksonville Jaguars and was later diagnosed with a Grade 3 turf toe injury, a condition serious enough to sideline most players for months. NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reported that Burrow underwent surgery and is expected to miss “at least three months.” That puts his earliest possible return in late December, lining up with Week 16 against the Miami Dolphins.The timeline, however, is far from guaranteed. FOX Sports’ Jay Glazer questioned whether the three-month window is realistic, calling it “very aggressive.” He noted, “They’re saying three months, I don’t see three months being an actual timeline. I think more so [Burrow has] a chance [to return] if they make the playoffs, but only because it’s Joe Burrow. Somebody else, I’d say no. But he has that Mamba Mentality, maybe yes. It’s such a difficult injury to return from.”That reality means the Bengals must prepare for the likelihood that Burrow may not return during the regular season.Even in a best-case scenario, his availability depends heavily on whether Cincinnati remains in the postseason hunt.The loss of Burrow immediately reshaped expectations for the Bengals, who entered 2025 with legitimate Super Bowl aspirations. Without their star quarterback, Cincinnati has turned to Jake Browning. While Browning has shown flashes of potential, his early performances have been inconsistent, raising doubts about the Bengals’ ability to stay competitive in the tough AFC North.The division itself leaves little room for error. With the Ravens and Browns already stacking wins, every setback without Burrow makes the climb toward a Wild Card spot more difficult. The Bengals’ offensive rhythm has struggled without their leader, particularly in the passing game, which was built around Burrow’s precision and composure.The bigger question now is whether the team would risk bringing Burrow back late in the season if he isn’t fully ready. Turf toe can have lingering effects, and rushing a return could jeopardize his long-term health. The Bengals’ medical staff will need to weigh playoff chances against preserving the future of their franchise quarterback.For now, Joe Burrow’s regular season is in jeopardy. A late December comeback is possible, but only if recovery progresses perfectly and the Bengals remain in contention. Otherwise, fans may have to wait until 2026 to see him fully healthy under center again.Also Read: Braelon Allen injury update: What happened to New York Jets RB that made him leave Monday Night Football","Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow suffered a severe turf toe injury in Week 2.

“Woefully ignorant”: Travis Kelce and Andy Reid’s sideline behavior shocks fans after weeks of tension,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/woefully-ignorant-travis-kelce-and-andy-reids-sideline-behavior-shocks-fans-after-weeks-of-tension/articleshow/124223116.cms,"Andy Reid & Travis Kelce (Getty Images)

A complete turnaround from MetLife tensions

Is Travis Kelce being preserved for a playoff push?

The Kansas City Chiefs may have handled the Baltimore Ravens with ease in Week 4, but it was the sideline atmosphere between Travis Kelce and Andy Reid that truly stood out. Just a week after their heated exchange against the New York Giants, the two appeared lighthearted and united, giving fans plenty to talk about.During the Chiefs’ 37-20 win at Arrowhead Stadium, cameras caught Kelce and Reid sharing laughs and even an embrace—a sharp contrast to the tense shouting match that played out on September 22 at MetLife. For many fans, this moment confirmed what insiders have long suggested: their fiery sideline disputes are rooted in competitiveness, not division.One fan on X summed it up perfectly, writing, “Anyone who thinks those 2 don’t love each other are woefully ignorant.” Another joked about the duo’s chemistry, suggesting Kelce was teasing his coach mid-game: “He’s saying to Andy, ‘What can we give them to rant about this week?’”The show of unity couldn’t have come at a better time. With Patrick Mahomes spreading the ball to four different receivers for touchdowns, Kansas City looked like the dominant team that stormed to a Super Bowl win just two seasons ago.Despite his steady presence in the offense, Kelce’s red-zone numbers have raised eyebrows. At 36, the tight end has only one touchdown this season—a 37-yard score against the Chargers. Some analysts believe Reid and Mahomes may be intentionally scaling back his scoring role to preserve him for a deep postseason run, much like they did in 2023 when Rashee Rice emerged late but Kelce dominated in the playoffs.His 15 catches for 182 yards prove he’s still a reliable target, averaging 12.1 yards per reception—remarkably consistent for a veteran in his mid-30s. With Xavier Worthy just returning from injury and Rice sidelined, Kelce continues to carry a heavy load in sustaining drives.Also Read: “Having heart failure”: Giants fan defends herself after viral backlash for taking Patrick Mahomes’ headband from young boy Fans now wonder if this season could be his “last hurrah,” with a carefully managed workload designed to unleash him when it matters most—January and February football.","Travis Kelce and Andy Reid shared laughs and an embrace during the Chiefs' 37-20 win at Arrowhead Stadium.

Career stats overview of Justin Fields

Jets’ game plan built around Justin Fields’ strengths tonight

The New York Jets are gearing up to face the Miami Dolphins tonight in Week 4, and all eyes are on quarterback Justin Fields. Known for his dual-threat ability and fearless arm, Fields is the centerpiece of New York’s offense. Tonight isn’t just another game—it’s about a young leader returning from injury and carrying the hopes of a Jets team eager to make a statement in the AFC East.Yes, Justin Fields is confirmed active and expected to start under center. Cleared by the Jets’ medical staff, Fields will take his normal workload with no limitations. Head coach Aaron Glenn stressed that having Fields back gives the Jets a real chance to stabilize the offense and force the Dolphins’ defense to adapt. With Fields in command, New York has the tools to challenge one of the league’s most dynamic defenses.Fields missed Week 3 after suffering a concussion in Week 2, but he enters tonight fully healthy. Reports confirm he has participated in every practice leading up to this game, showing sharp decision-making, quick reads, and excellent mobility. There are no lingering issues, and the Jets are confident their star QB can handle the pressure and lead the offense against a tough Miami defense.In Week 1 against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Fields looked sharp, completing 72.7% of his passes for 218 yards with one touchdown and no interceptions, posting a 119.1 passer rating. His dual-threat ability also made an impact on the ground, helping sustain drives and keep defenses guessing.Week 2 against the Buffalo Bills was more difficult. Fields completed just 27.3% of his passes for 27 yards with no touchdowns, finishing with a 39.6 passer rating. Despite the setback, he remained composed and focused on leading the Jets, showing resilience and determination.Through two games this season, Fields has totaled 245 passing yards, one touchdown, no interceptions, and a 91.1 passer rating. The numbers reflect flashes of brilliance while highlighting areas for growth as he adjusts to running New York’s offense.Over his NFL career, Fields has thrown for 8,025 yards with 46 touchdowns, 31 interceptions, and a career passer rating of 84.1. His progression over the years has been steady:2021 (Bears): 58.9% completions, 1,870 yards, 7 TDs, 10 INT, 73.2 rating2022 (Bears): 60.4% completions, 2,242 yards, 17 TDs, 11 INT, 85.2 rating2023 (Bears): 61.4% completions, 2,562 yards, 16 TDs, 9 INT, 86.3 rating2024 (Steelers): 65.8% completions, 1,106 yards, 5 TDs, 1 INT, 93.3 rating2025 (Jets): 57.6% completions, 245 yards, 1 TD, 0 INT, 91.1 ratingFields’ career shows a quarterback who has steadily refined his accuracy, decision-making, and playmaking ability. His dual-threat skillset makes him dangerous both in the air and on the ground.Coach Glenn is expected to build the game plan around Fields’ ability to read defenses quickly and extend plays with his legs. He will serve as the primary weapon on early downs while also using mobility to keep Miami’s defense guessing. His poise under pressure and smart decision-making will be critical in giving New York a chance to compete in this pivotal AFC East matchup.With Fields back under center, tonight’s game promises to highlight his leadership, dual-threat impact, and ability to manage the offense. If he plays at his peak, Fields could stabilize the Jets’ attack and make this matchup against the Dolphins far more competitive than expected. A strong performance tonight could mark a turning point in Fields' season and the Jets' push for their first win of 2025.Also read: Rookie Jalen Cropper steps into the spotlight to lead Cowboys’ offense during CeeDee Lamb’s absence",Justin Fields is confirmed active and expected to start under center for the Jets.

What to expect: A playoff-style AFC battle with momentum swings and pressure-filled moments

Also read

The Miami Dolphins welcome the New York Jets to Hard Rock Stadium on Monday Night Football, in a matchup that could have real consequences for the AFC playoff picture. Both teams are still carving out their identities this season, and this prime-time showdown offers each a golden opportunity to make a statement. The Dolphins are searching for rhythm after an inconsistent start, while the Jets are aiming to prove they can win tough games on the road. With explosive playmakers on both sides and playoff implications on the line, fans should expect a tightly contested battle from the opening whistle.The pressure in Miami falls squarely on the shoulders of quarterback Tua Tagovailoa and wide receiver Tyreek Hill. Tagovailoa remains the heartbeat of Miami’s offense – his timing and decision-making will be key to neutralizing a physical Jets defense early. Tyreek Hill will be the biggest challenge for New York’s secondary. His elite speed stretches the field and forces safeties to play deep, which opens up space underneath for Jaylen Waddle, who thrives on quick separation and yards after the catch.The Dolphins will likely lean on short throws and tempo-based drives to keep the Jets’ pass rush in check and prevent them from disrupting Tua’s rhythm. If Miami can avoid third-and-longs, they’ll give themselves a real shot at controlling the pace.On defense, safety Jevon Holland will be one to watch. His ability to read plays and deliver big hits could change momentum – especially against a mobile quarterback like Justin Fields, if he’s cleared to play.For the Jets, all eyes are on the quarterback position. If Justin Fields is active, his mobility adds a dimension that can stretch Miami’s defense and force linebackers to stay honest. Fields’ threat as a runner, especially in third-and-medium scenarios, makes him difficult to game-plan against. Young wide receiver Irvin Charles could be a difference-maker if targeted – his speed gives the Jets a potential home-run threat. Defensively, New York has depth, but several starters are listed as questionable. If Sauce Gardner can lock down Hill or Waddle in man coverage, that frees up help elsewhere. Safety Malachi Moore is another rising name to watch. He’ll be tested often against Miami’s vertical passing game, but he’s shown the range and awareness to make plays in space.While the final injury report is still pending, several key names may be game-time decisions. If Fields can’t go, expect New York to lean on the run game and short passes to stay competitive.This game has all the makings of a classic Monday night battle — elite playmakers, high stakes, and pressure moments where every possession matters. The Dolphins will try to dictate the pace with efficient drives and explosive plays, while the Jets look to slow the game down, play smart defense, and force turnovers.Ball security and third-down conversions will be critical. If Miami limits mistakes, they have the edge at home. But if the Jets' defense delivers early pressure or Fields finds his rhythm, it could tilt in New York’s favor.","The Miami Dolphins welcome the New York Jets to Hard Rock Stadium on Monday Night Football.

Houston Texans traded veteran OT Cam Robinson to Cleveland Browns for a 2027 late-round pick

Fans react to Cam Robinson trade to Cleveland Browns

Also Read:

As per Nick Brinkerhoff of USA TODAY, two straightforward reasons led to the Cam Robinson trade: Despite offensive line concerns, offensive tackle Cam Robinson was inactive for the Houston Texans’ Week 4 matchup against the Tennessee Titans. And, for two, the Cleveland Browns lost Dawand Jones to a season-ending injury and desperately need a starter at their left tackle position. Jones suffered a lateral collateral ligament (LCL) tear and a hamstring avulsion in the Browns' 13-10 victory over the Green Bay Packers on Sunday. So what are the exact Robinson trade details? Let’s find out.On September 29, NFL Insiders Ian Rapoport and Tom Pelissero reported on X that the Texans are trading offensive tackle Cam Robinson to the Browns for a 2027 sixth- or seventh-round pick.According to Brinkerhoff, Robinson was previously expected to be Houston’s left tackle in 2025. However, the emergence of rookie left tackle Aireontae Ersery, whose rapid improvement impressed both coaches and teammates, contributed to the Texans' decision to move Robinson. Texans star pass rusher Will Anderson Jr. told Kevin Patra of NFL Network in August, “Tae, Aireontae, man, he has really like shocked me a lot.His mindset as a rookie. There’s not a lot of guys like that. He wants to be great. He wants to get better every day. He stays after practice with me and Danielle (Hunter). He just has the grit, the grime in his game, and he has all the tools to be a great offensive lineman in this league.”Fans had mixed reactions. Some questioned trading a veteran offensive lineman when the Texans already have O-line concerns, while others saw potential benefits for the Browns, especially for quarterback Joe Flacco. One fan directly wrote: “Browns really out here coupon clipping for linemen.” Another speculated: “So puzzling. OL is, by most accounts, the Texans' weakest position room. Maybe they have somebody they consider an upgrade in the works?” A third fan sarcastically commented, “Ah yes, trading away even more offensive linemen, exactly what the Texans need to be doing. ” A fourth fan declared, “They just made their O LINE worse??? A fifth fan was happy for Cleveland Browns veteran quarterback Joe Flacco: “Robinson brings veteran experience with stabilizing presence for Flacco’s protection.” A fan expressed concerns for Houston Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud, “If they hate Stroud this much they can trade him to Pittsburgh.” Another reiterated, “Who they r planning to keep on O line to protect QB CJ Stroud? Poor guy already broken mentally after taking so many hits with this bad O line.”",Houston Texans traded veteran OT Cam Robinson to Cleveland Browns for a 2027 late-round pick.

Stephen A. Smith believes Al Horford might be Golden State’s smartest trade in years





How does Al Horford fit well into the Golden State Warriors’ roster?

With the 2025 NBA season gradually moving towards training camps, the Golden State Warriors have finally made some noise. According to ESPN’s senior NBA insider Shams Charania, veteran center Al Horford joined hands with the Warriors with a multi-year contract. Popular media personality Stephen A. Smith believes that Hoford’s addition to the Golden State Warriors’ roster is the best that could have happened to the NBA team.Former Boston Celtics’ star Al Horford signed a multi-year deal with the Golden State Warriors ahead of the 2025 NBA season. The five time All-Star has spent five NBA seasons with the Celtics. His association with the Warriors has turned heads in the NBA world, including popular ESPN personality Stephen A. Smith. The NBA countdown star wrote on his X handle,""This is a good damn pickup for the Warriors. The ageless Horford can still defend, can shoot (spread the floor), and it'll help Dray! Luv it.""According to Stephen A. Smith, Horford’s addition to the Warriors could be a game-changer. During his eight-year stint with the Boston Celtics, the 39-year-old NBA star shot almsot 40% from a long distance, which clearly pointed to his floor spacing ability.Despite being in his late 30s and all set to play his 19th NBA season, Al Horford is still one of the most demanding players in the league. Reportedly, he went on to play around 60 games for the Boston Celtics during the 2024 NBA season.Al Horford’s shooting range and defensive awareness could fit perfectly alongside Stephen Curry, Jimmy Butler, and Draymond Green in the Golden State Warriors’ lineup.

Pakistan fans are heartbroken as their team lose to India, AGAIN. 'Next time', they say!

Poll Do you agree with the critics that Haris Rauf should not bowl in the death overs? Yes, he has proven to be ineffective. No, he can improve with experience.

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistani cricketers have sharply criticised pacer Haris Rauf’s performance in the Asia Cup 2025 final against defending champions India, where he conceded 50 runs in four overs. The veterans particularly questioned his death-over bowling and captain Salman Ali Agha’s decision to bring him on during a crucial phase as India chased a modest 147 runs to win the title.Former Pakistan batter Mohammad Yousuf expressed concerns about Rauf’s performance at the death overs.“We have to understand Haris Rauf – how many matches he has blown away at the end (“marwaa diya”). He shouldn’t be bowling the end overs. You remember the past world cups – har jagah isney maar khaayi hai (he has been smashed everywhere) … If he had bowled better, the scenario would have been different,” Yousuf said during a discussion on Samaa TV.Former wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal highlighted Rauf’s struggles in big matches.“Haris Rauf doesn’t win the big games. We all remember the Melbourne game (when Kohli hit Rauf for two sixes). The captain has to understand which bowler needs to be used in such situations.We are not learning, keep making mistakes,” Akmal told ARY News.Tauseef Ahmed, former Pakistan offspinner, questioned Rauf’s repeated poor performances in crucial moments.“We say anything can happen in cricket. But why do such things only happen to Haris Rauf in cricket? We have other bowlers who are outside. Stop the stories of franchise cricket. End franchise’s influence. Only Haris Rauf could have done this. Not Hasan Ali or another youngster. We also have been hit in our time, but not every time like this.”The match situation became critical when Rauf was brought in for the 15th over, after spinners had conceded only 13 runs in three overs. Rauf gave away 17 runs in that over, shifting momentum firmly towards India.Mohammad Amir, former fast bowler, criticized the tactical decision.""It was a huge mistake to give Rauf that over. The spinners had created a momentum towards you. But they removed the spinner Saim and brought in the fast bowler Rauf, and that changed the momentum completely. No doubt he is your wicket-taking bowler, but that situation demanded spinners to be bowled. You wouldn’t have lost this game. Shaheen and Faheem had bowled so well in the powerplay,” Amir said on his YouTube channel.Former captain Rashid Latif suggested alternative bowling options.“Haris Rauf shouldn’t have bowled that over. Abrar Ahmed should have bowled that and when he came back, he had to change ends. That’s very important for a spinner.

Bucky Irving BREAKS DOWN Bucs late game heroics against Texans | SPEAKEASY Exclusive

Tampa Bay Buccaneers fans have reason to keep a close eye on running back Bucky Irving ahead of their Week 5 matchup against the Seattle Seahawks. Head coach Todd Bowles confirmed that Irving is among several players scheduled for MRIs this week, sparking concern about his availability. The Bucs hope Irving can maintain his early-season momentum as they prepare for a critical game.Todd Bowles addressed Irving’s status on Monday, telling reporters, ""Yeah, he's one of them,"" when asked if the running back was a concern, according to Tampa Bay Times’ Rick Stroud. While the exact nature of Irving’s injury remains unclear, the team is exercising caution before the Week 5 game. Despite this, Irving has yet to appear on Tampa Bay’s official injury report this season, leaving fans and analysts guessing about his playing status.Irving has been a key contributor for the Buccaneers in 2025. His breakout performance in Week 4 included 165 scrimmage yards and a spectacular 72-yard touchdown catch, finishing with 102 receiving yards and 63 rushing yards. Such explosive production underscores Irving’s importance to the Bucs’ offense, particularly as the team navigates injury challenges among other skill-position players. If Irving is sidelined in Week 5 against the Seattle Seahawks, Tampa Bay’s offense could face a major setback in both the rushing and passing game.The Buccaneers have already faced setbacks with wide receivers Mike Evans and Jalen McMillan sidelined, though Chris Godwin returned in Week 4, and rookie Emeka Egbuka has impressed with his consistent play. If Irving is unable to suit up against the Seahawks, Tampa Bay will likely turn to Rachaad White as the next man up in the backfield. White’s versatility and previous NFL experience make him a capable backup, but Irving’s absence could still limit the Bucs’ offensive options.All eyes are on Bucky Irving as the Buccaneers await his MRI results, with his presence potentially shaping the team’s offensive strategy against Seattle. A healthy Irving not only strengthens Tampa Bay’s rushing attack but also provides critical depth in the passing game. With the Bucs aiming to gain momentum in Week 5, the team’s ability to keep key players like Irving on the field could make a significant difference against Seattle.As the Buccaneers prepare for a pivotal showdown with the Seahawks, all eyes are on Bucky Irving.

However, confirming it through photo-matching services proved difficult due to the lack of high-resolution images. After a detour through another auction house, the jersey finally resurfaced for this high-profile sale.Beyond the staggering price tag, this jersey embodies Gretzky’s enduring legacy. He retired as the NHL’s all-time leader in goals, assists, and points, and even more than two decades later, his influence on the game remains unmatched. The fact that the jersey was on his back as he notched his final point only amplifies its importance.Also Read: The Gretzky effect: How Wayne Gretzky made hockey cool in Hollywood and changed the NHL forever For fans, the jersey is more than a collectible—it’s a piece of living history.

Bob Melvin’s Giants run ends after two uneven years

Matt Chapman praises Bob Melvin as Buster Posey starts search

“I loved him. He’s been steady. He’s honest with players. He always has our back.”

Bob Melvin was fired as manager of the San Francisco Giants on September 29, 2025. The move came one day after the Giants ended their season with a 4–0 win over the Colorado Rockies in San Francisco. The Giants finished with a record of 81–81, missing the playoffs for the fourth straight year. Giants president of baseball operations Buster Posey said the team needs “a different voice.” He called the past two months “disappointing and frustrating.” The Giants had picked up Melvin’s 2026 option in July, but still chose to part ways.Bob Melvin, 63, joined the Giants in October 2023 after leaving the San Diego Padres. Managing the Giants was special for him because he had been their catcher from 1986 to 1988. But his two seasons as manager ended with a 161–163 record.The 2025 season was full of streaks. The Giants won 13 of 16 games from late August into early September. That hot run gave fans playoff hopes. But the team then lost 9 of 11 games from September 13 to 23. The collapse ended their postseason dreams.Posey explained the firing. He said, “We’ve got to get back to the playoffs.That’s what our fan base deserves. That’s what the city deserves.” Melvin admitted after Sunday’s game against Colorado that he had no promises about staying for 2026. His firing confirmed those doubts.Giants players supported Melvin after the news. Third baseman Matt Chapman said,Pitcher Logan Webb also praised his leadership. Players said the team’s struggles were not only on the manager.Also Read: Chaos In Katy, Texas: Coach Struck By Stray Bullet At Katy Little League Game; 3 Suspects Face Charges Posey will now lead the search for the next manager. One possible name is Bruce Bochy, who managed the Giants to three World Series titles.Bochy’s contract with the Texas Rangers ended this year. Posey said, “I don’t know what his status is yet.” He added there is no deadline. “I want to make sure we get it right.”The Giants last made the playoffs in 2021. That year, they won a team-record 107 games to beat the Los Angeles Dodgers in the division race. Since then, they have not posted a winning season. Fans now wait to see who will lead the team next.","Bob Melvin was fired as manager of the San Francisco Giants on September 29, 2025.

He set up his own firm that deals with business deals and growth projects, and it now owns part of a club in Europe too.

What to expect from the Dolphins in tonight’s primetime test



Also read

The 2025 NFL season continues tonight as the Miami Dolphins host the New York Jets at Hard Rock Stadium. As the AFC East rivals square off in a high-stakes primetime battle, all eyes are on Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa . Despite an uneven start to the season, head coach Mike McDaniel has confirmed that Tua will start under center in front of the home crowd. With pressure mounting amid Miami’s offensive struggles, tonight offers the veteran signal-caller a major opportunity to reset the narrative and reassert himself as the leader of the Dolphins’ attack.Yes, Tua Tagovailoa will start for the Miami Dolphins in tonight’s Monday Night Football matchup. There are no injury designations holding him back, and team officials have made it clear he’s good to go. The 27-year-old quarterback has been candid about his underwhelming performances early this season, admitting he's “not playing up to the standard that I’ve played in years past.” Despite that, he remains the focal point of Miami’s offense and is determined to help the Dolphins snap their losing streak against a divisional foe.Tua will have his full arsenal of playmakers at his disposal, including dynamic receivers Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle. Miami enters the contest as a narrow favorite, and with Tagovailoa at the helm, the offense has a chance to get back on track against a vulnerable Jets defense.Tua Tagovailoa is the clear leader of the Dolphins’ offense, but his play through the first three weeks has drawn criticism — even from himself. After a red-hot 2024 campaign, expectations were high heading into 2025, but Miami’s offensive unit has struggled to generate rhythm. With the passing game lagging and the rushing attack failing to provide consistent support, Tua has shouldered much of the blame.Heading into tonight’s matchup, the Dolphins are expected to place more emphasis on short-to-intermediate routes, play-action looks, and a balanced run-pass attack to ease the pressure on Tagovailoa. With Hill and Waddle healthy and ready to stretch the field, Tua’s ability to make smart decisions and avoid turnovers will be key in determining the outcome.This AFC East clash could be pivotal for both teams as they look to gain ground in a tightly contested division.With Tua Tagovailoa fully cleared and motivated to bounce back, the Dolphins are counting on their quarterback to deliver a composed, efficient performance under the lights. Miami’s offense, though inconsistent, has the tools to explode — and tonight’s matchup against a shaky Jets secondary may be the ideal chance to break out.Expect Miami to establish the run early to open up passing lanes, giving Tua easier reads and more time to connect downfield. If the Dolphins can avoid costly mistakes and sustain drives, they’ll be well-positioned to take control of the game. Ultimately, this is a defining moment in Tua’s season — and possibly Miami’s trajectory in the AFC East.","The 2025 NFL season continues tonight as the Miami Dolphins host the New York Jets at Hard Rock Stadium.
