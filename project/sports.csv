Powerful

spiritual force

aided

Silkyara rescue

, says Australian

tunnelling expert

DEHRADUN: Arnold Dix was in Germany when the first call came. Then another, in Slovenia. The news was urgent - a tunnel collapse in Uttarakhand had left 41 workers stranded. Their survival depended on whether a narrow passage could be drilled through layers of hard rock and debris before time ran out. He didn't hesitate. ""I was asked to join the team working to rescue the trapped workers. Without a second thought, I boarded a flight to India,"" he said.He arrived in Uttarkashi on Nov 20, eight days after the collapse. By then, frustration had begun to seep into the operation. A nation watched as engineers, officials, and workers clawed at the earth, racing against time.Dix, a tunnelling expert from Australia and president of International Tunnelling & Underground Space Association, was a man of engineering, precision, and numbers - he wasn't built to believe in things he couldn't measure. But standing at the mouth of that collapsed tunnel, surrounded by exhaustion & failure, he felt the unshakable presence of something heavier than rock. ""I'm a rational man,"" he told TOI, ""But I am of the firm belief that a powerful spiritual force also played a crucial role in saving the 41 men."" The experience changed him profoundly.As days went by without a substantial breakthrough, Dix knew he had to shift the way they worked. The white hard hat of ""management people"" came off. The yellow helmet of the workers came on. ""With the blessing of Baba Baukhnag , whose temple was near the tunnel, I wore that yellow hat with conviction. We would save them,"" he said.For a moment, it wasn't engineering that defined the rescue. It was belief.The auger machine was their best chance. On Day 14, it failed. It wasn't a slow breakdown. It was abrupt. A hard stop. The team deflated. The energy on-site sagged. He had seen this before - the point in a disaster where exhaustion sets in and hope begins to fray. ""I changed my hat, kept their spirits high, and reminded them that we would bring those men to safety before Christmas.""On his flight to India, somewhere above the Arabian Sea, he had been reading about Kali - goddess of time, doomsday, justice, and death. ""The more I read, the more she made sense to me,"" he wrote in his book 'The Promise', released last week. At the mouth of the tunnel, he thought about her again. ""My first time in the tunnel was overwhelming. This was a much bigger mess than I could have possibly imagined,"" he wrote.On Nov 28, the last slab of rock was cleared. Leaders of the operation, including Dix, were hailed as heroes. But for him, the experience did not end at the tunnel's mouth. It followed him across continents. He studies Sanskrit now. Has faith in things he once dismissed. Carries with him the yellow helmet - not as a souvenir, but as something else. A marker. A threshold. A reminder that sometimes, numbers aren't enough.","Arnold Dix was a tunnelling expert from Australia and president of International Tunnelling & Underground Space Association.

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce Are Likely Planning A Private Valentine’s Day Together

It’s been a chaotic February for Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce. After Taylor lost out on multiple Grammy Awards, her boyfriend Travis Kelce’s team Kansas City Chiefs lost out on their chance of bringing the Lombardy Trophy home at the Super Bowl. It’s not surprising that the couple is not exactly in a celebratory mood and is not exactly planning a big Valentine’s Day blowout with their celebrity pals.An insider who’s close to the couple has revealed that Taylor and Travis are planning to spend some quiet time together and are not likely to go out to celebrate V-Day in public. The source quoted that the couple is planning a ‘break together.’The source confirmed, “Their lives have been a whirlwind since they first started dating. Things seem great between them, and they’re incredibly happy together.” The source also added that the Super Bowl, which the Chiefs lost, “was upsetting for everyone.”Taylor and Travis started dating around September 2023 and both the stars have been under intense public scrutiny since they were experiencing crucial phases in their careers. While Taylor was travelling the world with her iconic Eras tour, which also became the highest-grossing tour in music history, Kelce was prepping for one of the most important seasons of his career.Also Read: Taylor Swift & Travis Kelce’s next move: Where will they relax after the Super Bowl loss? Both Taylor and Travis have shown up at each other’s shows and(or) games since they started dating. Taylor is often a fixture in NFL matches where she usually sits with Travis’s family to cheer on her boyfriend. Travis too has attended Taylor’s concerts across the globe and they have both socialised with each other’s families and friends. So, it makes sense that they would prefer spending some quiet time in each other’s company away from the public.Taylor and Travis had spent the last V-Day apart; Taylor was in Melbourne for her Eras Tour, while Kelce was in Kansas City celebrating the Chiefs' Super Bowl LVIII win. Although, Travis reportedly spent over $16,000 on gifts for Taylor. The Chiefs tight end reportedly spent over $2,000 on two arrangements of 250 roses, and $3,100 on a rose sculpture and he also bought the singer a beret, handbag, and shawl from luxury brands.","Taylor and Travis are reportedly planning a quiet V-Day.

Jalen Hurts Apartment: Jalen Hurts Has a $255M Contract—But Still Rents a $2K Apartment?! Here’s Why,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/jalen-hurts-has-a-255m-contractbut-still-rents-a-2k-apartment-heres-why/articleshow/118215918.cms,"Getty Images

Why Does Jalen Hurts Still Rent Instead of Buying a Lavish Home?

""I didn’t buy a house or anything when I got drafted because it was just me,""

""I didn’t need this big place just for myself. I just got me a little apartment. You know, something smooth that’ll last me for the time being.""

Where Does Jalen Hurts Actually Invest His Millions?

A $215,000 house in Humble, Texas, for his family.

A 3,000-square-foot home in Houston, which he bought under his mom’s name.

A $6 million mansion near Houston, where he spends most of his off-season.

The house next door for an extra $2.68 million, because why not? Privacy is key.

Super Bowl Victory & What’s Next for Hurts?

Let’s talk about Jalen Hurts—Super Bowl champ, MVP, and one of the highest-paid quarterbacks in the NFL. With a $255 million contract in his pocket, you’d think he’s living in a mega-mansion in Philly, right? Nope. This guy still rents a $2,000-per-month apartment in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, and honestly, his reasoning makes total sense.Hurts has been renting this modest apartment since 2020, back when he was just a rookie figuring things out. Even after signing his massive contract extension in 2023, he decided to stick with it. Why? Simplicity.Hurts told GQ Sports in 2021.And that “little apartment” just happens to be 20 minutes from the Eagles' training facility—so it’s practical, too.Don’t get it twisted—Hurts isn’t against buying property. He’s just smart about it. Instead of splurging on a massive home in Philly, he’s been investing in real estate back in Texas.Here’s what his $9.4 million real estate portfolio looks like:His main home in Houston is a 6,000-square-foot beast with six bedrooms, six bathrooms, a giant pool, and 10 acres of land.Oh, and did we mention? Hurts just won his first Super Bowl after leading the Eagles to a 40-22 victory over the Chiefs. He completed 17 of 22 passes for 221 yards, securing the Super Bowl MVP title.With a ring now in hand, maybe it’s time for Hurts to upgrade his Philly living situation? Then again, knowing him, he’ll probably just buy another house for his family before splurging on himself.Either way, one thing’s for sure—Hurts is playing the long game with his money, and we’ve gotta respect it.Also read - ""This fall off the cliff is two years in the making"": Andy Reid should resign as Chiefs coach, says Fox Sports host following Super Bowl loss against Eagles","Jalen Hurts is one of the highest-paid quarterbacks in the NFL.

Texas Rangers' Star Robert Garcia’s MLB Future Appears in Dark as Potential Closer Battles Serious Nerve Injury,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/texas-rangers-star-robert-garcias-mlb-future-appears-in-dark-as-potential-closer-battles-serious-nerve-injury/articleshow/118224378.cms,"Image via: Norm Hall/Getty Images

Garcia's Slow and Steady Approach: A Southpaw's Nerve Test in Spring Training



Robert Garcia Reacts to Being Traded to Texas Rangers, Watching Texas Rangers Win 2023 World Series

Thus begins the Spring Training of Major League Baseball teams in Surprise, Arizona, as pitchers and catchers gather to signal the beginning of another great season. While Texas Rangers pitchers were busy readying their arms and throwing some gas, one lefty stayed home. And no, it wasn't because of a wayward fastball.Meet Robert Garcia, the southpaw in exchange for sending Nathaniel Lowe to the Washington system. Garcia was part of the trade discussions, right along with Chris Martin, a veteran with 14 career saves, as a possible Rangers bullpen candidate. And therein lies the catch-or may we say, the nervy situation. Garcia learns the big leagues while having some irritation in the throwing arm's nerves. Not the best welcome into spring training when edging for the last slot in the bullpen.Chris Young, president of baseball operations for the Rangers, reassured the media that there were no real concerns-just precaution to start things off. Instead of mounding like everyone else, Garcia will keep it low-key with a few catch sessions off of flat ground. The cautious approach to ramp-up allows this nerve irritation to have a chance of being a less significant issue in the future. Moreover, spring training isn't a sprint to the mound.""Nothing we're worried about,"" Young told the media. So the Rangers are putting Garcia's long-term health ahead of a hasty return to the mound, which is certainly wise because of the pressure that would come with being a potential closer.This is a new realm for Garcia. Even though for some time now he has been considered to step into that closer role, he has, in fact, never seen the opportunity of actually closing out a game in the majors. In the meantime, Chris Martin presumably has much closing experience, with 14 career saves to his name. With the Rangers changing their bullpen and changing pitching philosophies, however, Garcia surely could be in the running when he gets back healthy.Clearly, with the Rangers' offseason moves, such as letting Kirby Yates walk in free agency, a hole is present to be filled in the bullpen. Yates, who was the closer last year, has signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers, and David Robertson, another experienced closer, is still a free agent, leaving a tremendous opportunity open for someone to step up and grab that high-leverage role-whether it be Garcia, Martin, or another arm looking to make a statement.As spring goes on, we will be watching closely to see if Garcia can return fully to health and position himself in the conversation for the closing duties. But for now, he's taking it slow; being cautious is the name of the game in times like these—especially when it comes to the arm that does the throwing.","Robert Garcia was traded to the Texas Rangers in exchange for Nathaniel Lowe.

Chiefs are facing an identity crisis on offense

The Kansas City Chiefs must decide whether to release Travis Kelce in 2025, as releasing him would save $17.2 million in cap space. Kelce, a valuable and important player, is too valuable and important in the locker room to make such a choice. The Chiefs must adapt their offense to achieve a fourth consecutive Super Bowl and sixth in seven years, focusing on receivers Xavier Worthy and Rashee Rice , with Kelce playing a crucial role.Kansas City has achieved significant success in the past two seasons, reaching both Super Bowls and winning one, including winning it all in 2022. This success came after trading All-Pro receiver Tyreek Hill to the Miami Dolphins, but the team's transformation from explosive to slow wasn't immediate. Patrick Mahomes, who previously ranked sixth, 10th, and 13th in average depth of target from '18 to '20, dropped to 24th in Hill's final campaign due to increased shell coverage.In 2022, Mahomes threw for 5,250 yards and earned MVP, but his ADOT was 23rd in the league. The following year, Kansas City's ADOT dropped to 30th due to poor wideouts like Valdes-Scantling, Watson, Moore, and Toney. Mahomes failed to throw for 4,000 yards for the first time in his career, ranking 41st in ADOT. Early injuries to Rice and Brown and overreliance on Kelce contributed to the issue.Kelce has been targeted 254 times in the past two years, with Rice second with 131 targets. Despite playing just four games this season, Kelce hasn't made the All-Pro team or gained 1,000 receiving yards in seven consecutive seasons before 2023. Mahomes needs to return to his former form, and the Chiefs must address left tackle issues. Jawaan Taylor is financially locked in for another year before Kansas City releases him to save $20 million by 2026.The Chiefs have $11.5 million in cap space and can potentially increase it to $60 million with an extension for Joe Thuney, a restructure of Mahomes's deal, and a void year in Kelce's pact. This could allow Veach to re-sign Trey Smith and search for a left tackle in free agency.Also Read: “I think he retires”: Colin Cowherd believes Travis Kelce have played the last game of his career against the Eagles at the Super Bowl LIX Kansas City needs to improve its speed and aggressive play style, as they have been focusing on smaller, surer gains over intermediate and deep routes. Super Bowl LIX demonstrated that without a better line and weapons, disaster is always looming against a quality opponent, emphasizing the need for better defenses. Kelce's decision to play in 2025 remains unmade, but his role is crucial for the Chiefs to maintain their dynasty and enjoy glory.","Kansas City Chiefs must decide whether to release Travis Kelce in 2025.

Champions Trophy: Will India and South Africa clash in another ICC final?

Harbhajan Singh backs India to dominate Pakistan in ICC Champions Trophy 2025

'ROHIT A GREAT LEADER'

NEW DELHI: The iconic moment of Suryakumar Yadav 's breathtaking boundary-line catch to dismiss David Miller Rohit Sharma 's intense gaze as he witnessed the match-defining moment, fans on the edge of their seats with mouths agape, and the euphoric celebrations that followed still remains etched in the hearts of Indian cricket fans. India snatched victory from the jaws of defeat, securing a thrilling seven-run win over South Africa in a pulsating final to claim their second ICC Men's T20 World Cup title.Now, with Rohit Sharma leading India into another ICC challenge - the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 - could we see another India vs South Africa showdown in the final?Former South Africa allrounder JP Duminy believes a rematch in the summit clash would be ideal. The tournament is set to take place from February 19 to March 9, 2025, across Pakistan and Dubai.India will kick off their Champions Trophy campaign in Dubai on February 20 against Bangladesh and will play all their matches at the same venue.""I think that would be ideal. Look, I know that from a white-ball point of view, particularly in one-day cricket, South Africa hasn't necessarily played its best cricket. But what encourages me about South Africa is that, in big tournaments, we seem to see the best of them-we saw that in the T20 World Cup in June,"" Duminy told TimesofIndia.com in an interview.""So, I'm pretty confident that, even with the World Test Championship final, we'll take confidence from that. And the fact that we're heading into a high-octane tournament like the Champions Trophy-where there are no so-called weaker teams, and every team has a genuine chance to win-makes it even more exciting. Starting well, building momentum, and gaining confidence will be key. But what creates confidence? Momentum creates confidence. So, if you get on a good run, the confidence levels rise. If we can do that early in the tournament, it will put us in a strong position. Along with every other team, I believe South Africa has a real chance,"" Duminy, who played 46 Tests, 199 ODIs and 82 T20Is for the Proteas, said.India are in Group A alongside Bangladesh, arch-rivals Pakistan, and New Zealand, while South Africa are placed in Group B alongside England, Australia, and Afghanistan.With match-winners like David Miller, Heinrich Klaasen , Tristan Stubbs, Kagiso Rabada, and Keshav Maharaj in their ranks, Duminy believes South Africa will once again enter the tournament as strong contenders.""Heinrich Klaasen is in a league of his own right now, particularly in white-ball cricket. We've seen that across the globe in every tournament he has played. It would be ideal if he remains in good form,"" Duminy said.""But the reality of tournaments-whether it's the World Cup or the Champions Trophy-is that you need two or three players to be consistently performing. One player can win you a game here and there, but for sustained success, you need consistency with both bat and ball. So, players like Kagiso Rabada, Keshav Maharaj-especially in those conditions-Marco Jansen, and obviously Heinrich Klaasen and David Miller will be crucial. If two or three of them can find consistency, it will give us the best chance to win,"" he said.Duminy played under Rohit's captaincy for Mumbai Indians in 2018, sharing the nets, warm-up sessions, dressing room, and crease with him.Reflecting on his experience, he described the Indian skipper as a ""great leader.""""Form is temporary, class is permanent (on Rohit). I was reminded of that a few days ago, and Rohit certainly fits that mold. I have no doubt he will come back stronger. I've had the privilege of playing alongside him, and one of his greatest attributes is his consistency in who he is-regardless of his performances. He's a great leader, and he has enjoyed tremendous success with both the Mumbai Indians and the Indian team,"" he said.""Cricket is a game of ups and downs, but how we respond to those challenges defines us as players and as people. Knowing Rohit's character, and having seen the consistency in his interviews and behavior over the last few months, I know that the players and staff trust him to come out of this stronger. I'm pretty sure we're going to see some big performances from him soon,"" Duminy said.","ICC Champions Trophy 2025 is set to take place in Pakistan and Dubai.

Injuries are part of the game, and we’re focused on getting everyone healthy at the right time.”With Jimmy Butler not listed on the injury report, the Warriors are optimistic about integrating him into their lineup soon.

But the home side successfully chased down the big target, powered by brilliant centuries from Salman Ali Agha (134) and captain Mohammad Rizwan (122 not out) with an over to spare.The six-wicket win took Pakistan to the final of the tri-series against New Zealand at the same venue on Friday, and the matches played so far in this tournament have indicated that the ICC Champions Trophy is going to be full of runs.The two venues used for the tri-series -- Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore and the National Stadium in Karachi -- will also host the upcoming Champions Trophy , with the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium as the third venue.While India play their matches in Dubai as part of a hybrid arrangement, the big-hitting stars among the two-time ODI World Cup winners will miss playing on the flat tracks in Pakistan.Each of the three league games in the tri-series -- two in Lahore and one in Karachi -- have seen the team batting first going past the 300-run mark, while two of those were successfully chased.Batting first in Lahore, New Zealand made 330 for 6 against Pakistan, while South Africa scored 304 for 6 in the next match, which the Kiwis chased down successfully. And if the 7.14 runs per over in Karachi on Wednesday are anything to go by, then the final is likely to witness another run-fest.""Batters will certainly take a lot of heart from the performances they put in the past two games, and as a bowling unit, we are working to understand how to create more pressure and ultimately force batters to take risks,"" said SA coach Rob Walter, after Pakistan completed their highest successful ODI chase to beat the Proteas on Wednesday.He added that more totals in excess of 350 are on the cards if similar batting conditions and the flat decks become the norm at the three Champions Trophy venues, while bowlers will have to think out of the box to get wickets.""As I said, both teams struggled to take wickets; it wasn't just unique to us. So the method (of taking wickets) moving forward is going to be important to us,"" said the coach.""If the pitches are the same moving forward, then you can expect to see more scores of 350.""","Pakistan beat South Africa by six wickets in ODI tri-series match in Karachi. 707 runs were scored in 99 overs at the National Stadium in Karachi on Wednesday.

Alex Bregman’s Out, Jose Altuve’s In Left Field—Now the Astros Are Making a Bold Play for Nolan Arenado!



Reacting to Alex Bregman's deal with Boston and its affect on Nolan Arenado's market | Hot Stove

Should Red Sox Add Alex Bregman, Nolan Arenado Or Justin Turner?

Saying that the Houston Astros find themselves staring at a familiar target—the third baseman Nolan Arenado-a little after they took a drastic shift in their game plan is almost an understatement. The Astros came close to having a deal worked out for the star third baseman to come over from the St. Louis Cardinals sometime in early December. But in a twist that could put any Hollywood movie to shame, Arenado triggered his no-trade clause and blocked the move, leaving the deal dangling like a curveball waiting to be hit.Fast forward to February, and the current position has turned upside down. Bregman out and panic Inside? Maybe for a moment. But the Astros, shrewd contenders, are back on Plan B: some major change. Picture Jose Altuve, the longtime second baseman for the organization, in left field—a position he is actually pretty good at but could now dive into full-time albeit part-time. Bob Nightengale from USA Today gave this little tidbit away, saying the Astros weren't just kicking tires on this idea; they are going full speed ahead.With Bregman out, then, and Altuve on the brink of an outfield plunge, it would be a logical step backward for Houston to again consider Arenado—as a third base balm, who better? After all, that depends on Arenado's willingness to waive that no-trade clause; he isn't too keen on moving out of St. Louis. But the Astros' actions lately, including signing Christian Walker, indicate that this team is serious about keeping its World Series window wide open.The Astros could now also be in a very favorable position since Boston has most likely withdrawn from the chase as Houston signed Bregman. Arenado will want to prove himself again after a rather mediocre 2024 season, and this could mean moving to Daikin Park, where he could again benefit from a power-friendly environment and boost his numbers.The only thing that remains to be seen is whether or not Arenado will agree to try Houston this time. For example, he turned down the first offer, and only time will tell. However, it is quite clear that the Astros will keep themselves open on this, and it might very well happen that Arenado is back in the books again. The drama continues!","The Astros came close to having a deal worked out for the star third baseman to come over from the St. Louis Cardinals sometime in early December.

The Cleveland Cavaliers ' blowout victory over the Toronto Raptors on Wednesday night took an unexpected turn when Tristan Thompson ignited a heated on-court confrontation with a late-game dunk. With the game well in hand, Thompson, known for his energetic play, decided to punctuate the win with a forceful dunk in the waning seconds. This seemingly innocuous play, however, did not sit well with the Raptors, who viewed it as an unnecessary display of showboating.Tempers flared immediately after the final buzzer sounded. Several Raptors players engaged in a heated exchange with Thompson, with pushing and shoving erupting near the Toronto bench. Coaches and staff from both teams quickly intervened to prevent the situation from escalating further.Raptors head coach Darko Rajakovic expressed his strong disapproval of Thompson's actions post-game, labeling them as disrespectful and asserting that he would not tolerate such behavior. ""I’m really glad our guys stood up for themselves,"" Rajakovic declared. ""I love when my team stands up for themselves.""Cleveland head coach Kenny Atkinson , while acknowledging Thompson's competitive spirit, admitted he was unsure of the motivation behind the dunk. He said, ""Sometimes, though, you're playing the game, and you just have a reaction,"" Atkinson stated. ""I know with Tristan, there's no bad intention there. I think just sometimes you're playing, and the goal of the game is to score. Unfortunate.""The incident didn't end on the court. Thompson, apparently catching wind of Rajakovic's post-game comments, took to social media to fire back. ""You wanna full court press with under a minute left in the game when you get cracked by 30 this will happen to you,"" the 2016 NBA champion wrote on social media. ""Lose for draft lottery and be happy buddy boy. Hopefully you and most of your guys see the light at the end of [GM] Bobby [Webster] and [team president] Masai [Ujiri] long term plan. Bless up stay warm in MY CITY 😉😁.""This verbal sparring added another layer to the already heated encounter, further emphasizing the tensions between the two teams.While the Cavaliers celebrated their resounding victory, the incident serves as a reminder that even in a blowout, emotions can run high. Thompson's late-game dunk, while perhaps unintentional, ignited a firestorm of controversy, leaving a lasting mark on an otherwise dominant performance.","Tristan Thompson ignited a heated on-court confrontation with a late-game dunk.

Saquon Barkley defended Taylor Swift after she was loudly booed during Super Bowl LIX

Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley defended 14-time Grammy award-winner Taylor Swift on The Howard Stern Show, after she was booed during Super Bowl LIX when she was shown on video boards at the Caesars Superdome. Stern inquired about Swift's engagement to Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce , but Eagles halfback Barkley had mixed opinions. He was confused by Swift's negative reception from Eagles fans, and couldn't understand why she was booed.Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley dismisses the backlash against Taylor Swift, despite her significant impact on the NFL's expansion. In a February 12 appearance on SiriusXM's ""The Howard Stern Show,"" Barkley discussed Swift's appearance at Super Bowl LIX, where she was met with jeers from the stands.Taylor Swift attended the game to support her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, and when her face appeared on the screen, boos erupted from the crowd. “I remember that they showed her on the jumbotron, and she got booed. I don’t get it.

I don’t get the dislike she’s getting.”Serena Williams also publicly supported Swift in response to the crowd's heckling, joining Barkley in her defense since the Super Bowl, as seen in a post on X.

'We don't look at averages and stats': Gautam Gambhir on sending Axar Patel at No. 5

AHMEDABAD: Head coach Gautam Gambhir has dismissed speculation that India only played Shreyas Iyer in the first ODI against England because Virat Kohli was injured. Iyer, as it turned out, was in excellent form throughout the series, starting with a 36-ball 59 with India in early trouble in Nagpur. He followed that up with 44 and 78 in the next two matches.Gambhir said Iyer had always been in the ""scheme of things"" and will be an ""important player"" heading into the Champions Trophy After the Nagpur ODI, Iyer had revealed that he was played only because Kohli’s knee had acted up, and that he had been informed only the night before the game.Gambhir cleared the air by saying, ""He wasn’t supposed to be benched throughout the series. We wanted to give Yashasvi (Jaiswal) a go in the first game and see what he can bring to the table because he was in really good form in Australia.""Jaiswal, however, was subsequently dropped to enable Iyer to retain his place in the side. ""I know that you can’t judge someone (Jaiswal) by one innings. But we always knew that Shreyas was going to be an important player for us. Sometimes when you’ve only got three games, you want to try and rotate your squad as well.""When you’ve got Champions Trophy around the corner, you want to try and maximise these three games and try and give everyone an opportunity. But Shreyas was always in the scheme of things (and it is) good that he played all the three games,"" Gambhir added.Asked about his broader view on the effectiveness of left-right combinations, Gambhir said, ""That’s the way cricket is meant to be played. It’s not about the batting order, it’s about who can create what impact. It’s about putting a quality left-hander in the middle.""","Gautam Gambhir says Shreyas Iyer would not have been benched all series. Iyer played in first ODI because Virat Kohli's knee had acted up.

Patidar was unaware of RCB decision when he was in Indore just three days ago: Family

BHOPAL/INDORE: Celebrations erupted in Madhya Pradesh on Thursday as Indore's Rajat Patidar was named captain of Royal Challengers Bangalore - the first from the state to become skipper of an IPL team.RCB released a video where Rajat says, ""I feel honoured that they have chosen me this year. I don't express much, and I don't panic in pressure situations, this is my strength. Inputs from great leaders in the team will help me in this leadership role.""The decision came in the wake of Faf du Plessis's exit before the IPL 2025 mega auction. Whilst many anticipated that Virat Kohli , who led the team from 2013 to 2021, would return to the helm, RCB sprung a surprise, indicating a shift in their leadership strategy.Patidar's rise has been remarkable - from joining the neighbourhood Vijay Club at age seven, going unsold in IPL in 2022, getting his Test cap in 2024 and now RCB captain. The Patidar family is elated but kept celebrations subdued, honouring Rajat's long-standing wish to keep things simple, his uncle Sanjay Patidar, told TOI. ""He never likes any celebrations for his achievements and always asks us to keep it low-key,"" he said.Family members revealed that Patidar himself was unaware of the decision when he was in Indore just three days ago. The family was attending a wedding when news broke. Rajat's father Manohar Patidar wad flooded with congratulatory calls. ""We are all happy for him, and we were hoping for this announcement. I am sure he will lead RCB well as he has done for domestic cricket,"" said the proud father. Manohar Patidar fondly recalled how he would drop his son at various match venues on his two-wheeler. ""Rajat's determination and discipline helped him attain this position. Virat Kohli has helped Rajat a lot and has always motivated him,"" Sanjay Patidar said.The franchise shared a video of Virat Kohli, in which he congratulated Rajat, and said: ""I, along with the other members of the team, am with you."" Ramji Atre, who was Rajat's coach at Vijay Club, said the youngster is very steady, and remains unaffected by success. ""Whenever he is in Indore, he visits the club and spends time with young cricketers. He even attended a local tournament final on Feb 8. I have never felt anything change in him despite all the success. He is the same - down-to-earth, focused, and humble,"" Atre said.During his tenure with RCB, Patidar demonstrated remarkable batting prowess, particularly in pressure situations. His partnerships with Virat Kohli were instrumental in several crucial matches. The retention at Rs 11 crore highlights the team's long-term vision for him.As captain of MP's limited-overs teams, Patidar showed tactical understanding and team management skills. His leadership in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy 2024 campaign, where the team reached the final, impressed the RCB management. The appointment represents RCB's bold strategy to break their IPL trophy drought. Head coach Andy Flower's endorsement emphasises Patidar's people management skills and leadership style. The support from former captain Virat Kohli adds credibility to this decision. Incidentally, another Indore player, Venkatesh Iyer, is a major contender for the KKR captaincy after Shreyas Iyer, who was KKR captain from IPL 2022 to 2024, joined Punjab Kings.",Indore's Rajat Patidar named captain of Royal Challengers Bangalore.

'We don't look at averages and stats': Gautam Gambhir on sending Axar Patel at No. 5

NEW DELHI: Eyebrows were raised when India announced five spinners in the team for the ICC Champions Trophy . Historically, the pitches in Dubai do not overly favour spinners. However, the venue has also just got done with the month-long ILT20 league which may have left the pitches tired and more amenable to spin. Predominantly, though, India’s spinner-heavy squad was chosen to lengthen the batting lineup, TOI has learnt.The trend emerging from head coach Gautam Gambhir ’s tenure is the inclination to have more allrounders in the lineup across formats. Gambhir has been vocal about the need to bat deep. Seambowling allrounders are a rarity at the moment. Hence, Washington Sundar too has made the cut along with Axar Patel and Ravindra Jadeja Interestingly, it was Gambhir who insisted on having Shivam Dube back in the ODI scheme of things by adding him to the list of non-travelling reserves, say insiders.Gambhir is someone who prefers to have more options in the playing XI. More allrounders give him the chance to be flexible. If India advance in the tournament, spinners are likely to play a greater role.The idea, according to those in the know of developments, is simple — play two steady finger-spinners who can bat well to complement either Kuldeep Yadav or Varun Chakravarthy . Kuldeep and Chakravarthy are seen as genuine strike options. If the pitches at the start look like they can produce big runs, one might see Chakravarthy in the XI ahead of Kuldeep. The majority of Chakravarthy’s wickets have come while the batters have been looking to push the scoring rate. Kuldeep is seen as someone who can deceive the batter in the air and lure him into a false shot, like he did against England in the last ODI in Ahmedabad on Wednesday.There are other factors too. India have played two Asia Cups at the venue over the last seven years and never played more than two frontline spinners in the XI.Jasprit Bumrah’s absence and Mohammed Shami being rusty after a long injury layoff has played a part in India picking a spin-heavy attack which can compensate for the inexperience of the two new pacers, Harshit Rana and Arshdeep Singh. It will be interesting to see how India’s campaign unfolds on the Dubai pitches, which usually sport a layering of grass to prevent the surface from cracking up.",The trend emerging from head coach Gautam Gambhir ’s tenure is the inclination to have more allrounders in the lineup across formats.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

"Cat-astrophe at 30,000 feet: Stowaway kitten grounds Rome-to-Germany Ryanair flight for 2 days",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/cat-astrophe-at-30000-feet-stowaway-kitten-grounds-rome-to-germany-ryanair-flight-for-2-days/articleshow/118177795.cms,"A rogue paw-ssenger tampering with electrical components mid-flight could have led to a catastrophic malfunction, potentially costing Ryanair thousands in damages.

A high-flying feline turned a routine Ryanair flight into an airborne spectacle after sneaking aboard a Boeing 737, delaying the journey for a full two days.The Rome-to-Germany flight was moments from takeoff last week when crewmembers heard an unexpected meow from deep within the aircraft, Jam Press reported. What followed was a two-day game of cat-and-mouse—or rather, cat-and-mechanics.Upon investigation, maintenance workers dismantled several panels, revealing the tiny black-and-white stowaway nestled inside the plane’s electrical bay. Photos captured the kitten peeking out like the star of an impromptu ""Snakes on a Plane"" sequel—only with fur and whiskers.However, this mischievous meow-er wasn't ready to leave. As workers tried to retrieve it, the cat darted deeper into the wiring, leading to a frustrating chase across the aircraft’s inner workings. Officials were forced to cancel the flight, fearing that a loose feline amid vital electronics could spell disaster mid-air.The game of whack-a-meow finally ended when the kitten voluntarily strolled out of the plane through an open door, casually descending the stairs before strutting across the tarmac—turning the runway into its personal catwalk.While passengers were grounded for 48 hours, experts say the delay was necessary. A rogue paw-ssenger tampering with electrical components mid-flight could have led to a catastrophic malfunction, potentially costing Ryanair thousands in damages.This isn’t the first time a feline flyer has disrupted a flight. In 2021, a plane from Khartoum, Sudan, to Qatar had to turn back after a loose cat reportedly attacked the pilot mid-air.As for the Rome-to-Germany escape artist? Reports suggest it was safely removed, but whether it made its way to a forever home or planned another high-altitude adventure remains a mystery.","The Rome-to-Germany flight was moments from takeoff when crewmembers heard an unexpected meow from deep within the aircraft.
