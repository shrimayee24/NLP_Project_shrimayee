This defeat came on their home soil in Rawalpindi . Despite declaring their first innings at 448/6, Pakistan lost the game after Bangladesh took a 117-run lead in their first innings. Pakistan collapsed to 146 in their second innings, and Bangladesh chased down the 30-run target with ease.This win marks Bangladesh's first victory against Pakistan in 14 matches.This loss marks the 17th time in Test cricket history that a team has lost after declaring their first innings. Ironically, Pakistan was also the first team to suffer such a defeat.In a 1961 Test in Lahore against England, they declared at 387/9 but lost by five wickets. The recent defeat in Rawalpindi is Pakistan's third such loss. Before this, they lost to Australia in the 2016 Melbourne Test despite declaring at 443/9 in the first innings.India also experienced a similar fate in a 1976 Test against the West Indies in Kingston. India declared at 306/6 but lost by 10 wickets. Pakistan's defeat by Bangladesh in Rawalpindi echoes India's 1976 loss.By declaring India's first innings at 306 for 6, captain Bishan Singh Bedi tried to protect the tailenders from the West Indies' fast bowlers on a dangerous pitch. Yet, India ended up losing by 10 wickets. Now, Pakistan shares the record with India as the only teams to lose by 10 wickets after declaring their first innings.","Pakistan lost their first-ever Test match against Bangladesh in Rawalpindi.

'Isme players ki koi galti nahi hai': Ahmed Shehzad blasts PCB after Pakistan's historic Test defeat to Bangladesh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/isme-players-ki-koi-galti-nahi-hai-ahmed-shehzad-blasts-pcb-after-pakistans-historic-test-defeat-to-bangladesh/articleshow/112791012.cms,"Watch:

NEW DELHI: In a stinging rebuke of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), cricketer Ahmed Shehzad has criticized the board's strategy and selection policies following Pakistan's historic 10-wicket loss to Bangladesh in the Rawalpindi Test on Sunday. This defeat marks Bangladesh's first-ever Test win over Pakistan, achieved on the latter's home soil.After being bowled out for just 146 runs in their second innings, Pakistan set Bangladesh a modest target of 30 runs, which the visitors chased down effortlessly.Expressing his frustration in a video posted on X, Shehzad described the defeat as a ""new low"" for Pakistan cricket.""Pakistan ki cricket ka haal yeh ho gaya hai ki aaj Bangladesh ne Pakistan ke home soil pe pehli dafa zindagi me Pakistan ko hara diya. Maine apni zindagi me Pakistan cricket ko itna low jaate huye kabhi nahi dekha. Kabhi zindagi me nahi dekha. Batting, bowling, fielding, achcha, bura ye toh baad ki baat he. Lekin yeh ek naya low hit kiya he Pakistan ne, jo ki maine apni Zindagi me kabhi nahi dekha [Pakistan cricket has reached a point where today Bangladesh defeated Pakistan on home soil for the first time ever. I have never seen Pakistan cricket sink so low in my life. This is a new low that Pakistan has hit, which I have never seen in my life],"" Shehzad said.Shehzad also suggested that Pakistan will struggle to recover from this loss, much like they have struggled since their defeat to Afghanistan in the 2023 ODI World Cup. He criticized the PCB for making short-term decisions that have led the team towards a decline reminiscent of the fall of Pakistani hockey.""Aur Pakistan iss defeat se bahut mushkil se nikal payega, jaise Afghanistan ki defeat se aaj tak nahi nikal paa raha hai. Issi tarah Pakistan is defeat se bahut mushkil se nikal payega. Humne pehle bhi bola tha. Agar aapne short term decision liye hai toh Pakistan ki team already he na zero ki taraf he, hockey wala haal ho raha hai. Lekin humne yeh nahi expect kiya tha ki aap Bangladesh se bhi har jayenge. Aaj aapne woh bhi kar dikhaya,"" he stated.Despite the poor performance, Shehzad did not place blame on the players but instead targeted the PCB for its lack of vision and poor selection policies.""Isme players ki koi galti main nahi manta. Mujhe nahi lagta isme players ki galti hai. Galti Pakistan Cricket Board ki hai. Kyunki players kabhi bhi aapko zabardasti nahi keh rahe he ki humein aap team me daale. Aap log he jo unko lagataar khilaye jaa rahe he. Aap log he jo domestic ke players ko aane nahi de rahe. Aap hi log he jo khud hi yeh bata rahe hai ki humare paas domestic me he hi kuch nahi. Toh aapke paas domestic mein iss tarah ke players nahi he jo in logon ko replace kar sakenge, toh aapne banaya kya hai abhi tak,"" he argued.Before this clash, Pakistan and Bangladesh had met in 13 Test matches, with Pakistan winning 12 and one ending in a draw. The Rawalpindi loss has prompted calls for introspection and changes within the PCB, as the cricketing community grapples with the implications of this historic defeat.","Ahmed Shehzad criticizes Pakistan Cricket Board's strategy and selection policies.

Test spot

COIMBATORE: The recent T20I series in Sri Lanka marked the beginning of not only Gautam Gambhir 's India coaching stint but also Suryakumar Yadav 's tenure as the permanent captain in the shortest format.Both Gambhir and Suryakumar had a lot to smile about at the end of the assignment as they got off to the perfect start with a 3-0 drubbing of the Lankans.With Gambhir throwing his weight behind him, Suryakumar, one of the most destructive batters in T20s, hardly put a foot wrong as skipper. The 33-yearold did not shy away from thinking out of the box when required, a move which enabled India to pull off an improbable win in the third and final match.Gambhir's decision to give a ""free hand"" to the team members is helping players express themselves, according to Suryakumar. ""The way he (Gambhir) played his cricket for India, it was amazing. He understands each player's game. He knows what players like to do on the ground and during practice sessions,"" said Suryakumar, who is in Coimbatore to represent Mumbai in the Buchi Babu tournament Group C match against TNCAXI.""He has given a free hand to everyone. As a team, when we come together, it is important to jot down all the thoughts that players have. We will think about it, go out and be ourselves.""While Suryakumar has been the backbone of India's T20I batting line-up in the last three and-a-half years, he has struggled to break into the Test squad. His only appearance in the longest format came against Australia in Nagpur in Feb 2023.But Suryakumar is motivated to force his way back into the red-ball scheme of things. ""There are a lot of players who have worked hard to earn their place in the Test squad. Even I want to earn a place. After I made my debut for India in Tests, I got injured. The players who have got opportunities, they have done well. Those are the players who deserve the opportunity right now,"" he said.Suryakumar emphasised that playing red-ball cricket has been his top ""priority"" since the time he made his state-team debut. ""The love for red-ball cricket has always been there. Though I made my debut for India in the shorter formats first, I have always enjoyed playing this format. Red-ball cricket has always been the first priority. There is no question about it and that is why I am here ahead of the Duleep Trophy ,"" Suryakumar said.""This format is a little challenging, you have to be one step ahead. You cannot bat like in a T20 game. But at the same time, intent is very important. What body language you carry on the ground, that is very important. If you do well, stay humble. If you do not do well, go back to the basics and drawing board, start and come back again.""",Suryakumar Yadav is in Coimbatore to represent Mumbai in the Buchi Babu tournament Group C match against TNCAXI.

NEW DELHI: While the prospect of an India vs Pakistan World Test Championship (WTC) final remains theoretically possible, recent results have made it a near-impossible scenario. Pakistan's historic defeat to Bangladesh in Rawalpindi has further diminished their already slim chances of reaching the WTC final . With India among the favorites to make it to the final again, a match-up between the two rivals would have been a blockbuster.However, Pakistan's road to the final now looks more challenging than ever.Pakistan currently sit in the eighth position on the WTC points table, with just two wins in six matches and a winning percentage of 30.56. This significant decline in form, especially in red-ball cricket, has left them with a steep mountain to climb if they hope to reach the WTC final.Pakistan still have eight Tests remaining in the current WTC cycle. To have a strong chance of making the final, they would need to win all of these matches. This task will be challenging, as they face tough opponents, including England, West Indies, and South Africa, with the series against the Proteas being played away from home.Meanwhile, India and Australia remain the favorites to face each other again in the WTC final next year. Both teams are at the top of the standings with a considerable lead. India lead with six wins in nine matches and a winning percentage of 68.52, while defending champions Australia are just behind with eight wins in 12 matches and a percentage of 62.50. The upcoming Border-Gavaskar Trophy later this year will be crucial for both teams as they aim to secure their places in the final.Bangladesh's recent victory over Pakistan has moved them up to sixth place in the points table, with two wins in five matches and a winning percentage of 40.00. This victory marks a significant improvement for Bangladesh in Test cricket .In another notable match, England defeated Sri Lanka by five wickets in the first Test, climbing from seventh to fourth in the WTC points table.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan suffered a significant defeat in Test cricket, losing by 10 wickets to Bangladesh at home, drawing sharp criticism towards captain Shan Masood and his team.It was Bangladesh’s first ever Test victory over Pakistan in 14 meetings.Former cricketer and commentator Ramiz Raja suggests that this loss was related to their underwhelming performance in the Asia Cup against India, which shattered the confidence of Pakistani bowlers.Ramiz Raja highlighted several issues contributing to the defeat, including dubious team selection choices and a noticeable decline in fast bowling prowess. He emphasized the lack of a specialist spinner and the current struggles faced by Pakistan's famous pace attack.Raja believes these issues became apparent following the Asia Cup when Indian batsmen exposed the weaknesses of Pakistani pacers.""Firstly, there was a mistake in team selection. You were without a spinner. Secondly, the reputation on which we rely for our fast bowlers is finished. This debacle, a sort of confidence crisis, started during the Asia Cup when India bashed our pacers on seaming conditions. Then the secret was out to the world: the way to counter this line-up was to attack. Their speeds have decreased, and so have their skill set,"" Ramiz said on his YouTube channel.Another focal point of Raja's critique was Shan Masood's captaincy. He faulted Masood's inability to assess playing conditions accurately, leading to the surprising loss. Raja particularly pointed to Masood’s decision to play four pacers on a Rawalpindi pitch during August as a strategic error that backfired.""Shan Masood is currently on a losing streak. I felt, in Australian conditions, things are tougher and it was impossible for the Pakistan team to win a series there. But you are now losing in home conditions against a team like Bangladesh because you did not read the conditions well,"" Ramiz asserted.Raja also reflected on Masood's decision-making abilities and the uninspiring performances from both the batsmen and bowlers under his leadership.

In an unexpected turn of events, West Indies all-rounder Carlos Brathwaite stunned fans and the cricketing world with an uncharacteristic display of anger during a T10 league match. The all-rounder’s rare outburst came after a controversial umpiring decision that left him visibly frustrated.The incident occurred during the ninth over of the match when Brathwaite was adjudged caught behind off the bowling of Josh Little .Believing the ball had struck his shoulder rather than his bat, Brathwaite stood his ground momentarily, clearly displeased with the umpire’s decision.Replays suggested that the ball might have hit his shoulder before being caught by the wicketkeeper, but the umpire upheld his decision, declaring Brathwaite out.Upon returning to the dugout, Brathwaite’s frustration boiled over in an uncharacteristic show of emotion. He removed his helmet and, in a fit of rage, smashed it out of the playing area with his bat. Not stopping there, he then threw his bat in frustration as he entered the dugout.Brathwaite’s innings ended with a score of 7 off 5 balls, and he was dismissed on the third delivery of the ninth over. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the intense emotions and pressures players face in competitive cricket , especially when they feel an umpiring decision has gone against them.",West Indies all-rounder Carlos Brathwaite stunned fans and the cricketing world with an uncharacteristic display of anger during a T10 league match.

Dhawan, fondly called 'Gabbar', was a prolific run-scorer across formats for India and in domestic leagues. Dhawan contributed significantly to India's cricketing success over the years.He scored 6,793 runs in 167 ODIs at an average of 44.11 and a strike rate of 91.35, including 17 centuries.In Test cricket, Dhawan amassed 2,315 runs in 34 matches, with an average of 40.61, including seven centuries.His T20I career saw him scoring 1,759 runs at a strike rate of 126.36.“Shikhar Dhawan’s retirement from all forms of the game is going to leave the sport poorer than before. The ever-smiling, ever-positive Shikhar, also fondly called ‘Gabbar’, was a player of enormous talent. But as befalls opening batters, a lean series or tournament can mean the selectors wielding the axe.”“In later years, injuries were part of Shikhar’s career, which seldom allowed him to fully display his skill and probably helped him make the decision to quit the game while he was still enjoying being part of the circuit,” wrote Gavaskar in his column for Sportstar.Dhawan played crucial roles in several tournaments for India. He was the leading run-scorer in India's victorious 2013 Champions Trophy campaign in England and continued to be the top run-scorer for India in numerous other major tournaments, including the 2014 Asia Cup, 2015 ODI World Cup, 2017 Champions Trophy, and 2018 Asia Cup.Apart from his contributions to the national team with the bat, Dhawan also led India on occasions when senior players were unavailable. In domestic leagues, he represented several teams including Delhi Capitals, Mumbai Indians, Deccan Chargers, Sunrisers Hyderabad, and Punjab Kings in the Indian Premier League (IPL). Dhawan is the second-highest run-getter in the IPL, only behind Virat Kohli.Gavaskar remarked on the broader opportunities available for retired cricketers to stay connected with cricket, suggesting that Dhawan can still bring joy to fans in various roles. Dhawan, aged 38, has already taken steps in this regard by joining the Legends Cricket League and engaging in philanthropic ventures.Moreover, Dhawan has his philanthropic ventures and recently became co-owner of the South Delhi Superstars team in the ongoing Delhi Premier League (DPL). “Taking that call is the hardest thing to do. But when the body tells the mind, ‘Enough, enough’, then that’s the right time to go.”“Retired cricketers today have many more avenues open to stay connected with the game, and Shikhar could well avail of them. There’s no doubt that whatever he chooses to do, he will do it with the same cheer that he brought to the game and was loved by teammates and fans for,” he concluded.","Legendary India opener Sunil Gavaskar says Shikhar Dhawan's retirement from all formats has left the sport 'poorer' Dhawan, fondly called 'Gabbar', was a prolific run-scorer across formats for India and in domestic leagues.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112812494,imgsize-43004,width-400,resizemode-4/112812494.jpg"

It can get us a chance to play with the elite women’s clubs in Asia and it’s through games like that we can assess our true place among the top continental teams,” the coach added.Chhetri also played down the injury that Pyari Xaxa sustained during the game but said the final call will be taken only after more examination.",Odisha FC Women beat Singapore's Lion City Sailors 4-1 in their first game of the preliminary stage of the AFC Women's Champions League.

While Kylian Mbappe made his much-anticipated home debut at the Santiago Bernabeu , the French star was unable to find the back of the net.Despite dominating possession throughout the match, Real Madrid struggled to break down a well-organized Valladolid defence in the first half.The visitors, who were the only team to keep a clean sheet in the opening round of LaLiga fixtures, remained resolute in their defensive approach.The deadlock was finally broken early in the second half when Fede Valverde 's powerful free-kick took a decisive deflection, finding its way past Valladolid goalkeeper Karl Hein.Despite creating further opportunities, Real Madrid struggled to convert their chances. Rodrygo missed a key opportunity to extend the lead, misplacing a pass with Vinicius Jr. well-positioned to score.Mbappe himself was denied on two separate occasions, once by a smart save from Hein and later firing wide when presented with a promising counter-attacking opportunity.Substitutes Brahim Diaz and debutant Endrick ultimately sealed the victory for Real Madrid in the closing stages of the match.

Emma Raducanu returns to the US Open confident and ready to compete,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/us-open/emma-raducanu-returns-to-the-us-open-confident-and-ready-to-compete/articleshow/112755647.cms,"NEW DELHI: Emma Raducanu concluded her U.S. Open practice session on Friday by hitting with a young fan she had asked her social media followers to help locate after they were unable to meet the previous day. As the defending champion from her surprising victory three years ago, Raducanu remains unfazed by questions regarding her match readiness for the tournament .Despite her 2021 U.S. Open title remaining her sole WTA Tour victory, and her absence from last year's event due to injuries, the 21-year-old British player has participated in fewer than 30 matches this season.Although she has declined opportunities to compete more frequently, Raducanu stands by her preparation approach for the year's final Grand Slam .""Even when I won the U.S. Open, I only played a few tournaments that year,"" Raducanu said. ""Yes, they were closer together, but I'm not in any big rush to play those. I think I'd rather target tournaments and play the tournaments that I'm entered in.""Emma Raducanu, following her fourth-round exit at Wimbledon in July, made the decision to skip the Olympic Games and participated in only one event during the North American hard-court season, suffering a third-round defeat in Washington.The young tennis star, who holds a Canadian passport due to being born there, chose not to compete in her birth country. Instead, she returned to Britain to focus on training rather than participating in additional tournaments in preparation for her highly anticipated return to New York. In the first round of the US Open, Raducanu is set to face off against Sofia Kenin, the 2020 Australian Open champion.While some players crave match time, Raducanu said that just isn't her. The rising star's approach to tournament preparation differs from that of many of her peers, as she prioritizes targeted practice sessions over extensive match play leading up to major events.""I don't think I'll ever be the player who's playing, like, close to 30 events a year,"" she said. ""I think that's not my style. It never has been.""Emma Raducanu's 2023 season was marred by injuries, forcing her to miss a significant portion of the year due to surgeries on both wrists and an ankle. As a result, her only appearance at the U.S. Open following her historic 2021 victory as a qualifier was a first-round defeat to Alize Cornet in 2022.Despite the setbacks, Raducanu expressed a greater sense of preparedness for this year's U.S. Open. During her practice session on Friday, she had an unexpected encounter with a 7-year-old fan who had watched her play the previous day and enthusiastically proclaimed Raducanu as her favorite player.Although Raducanu had to leave quickly after the practice and couldn't meet the young fan, she took to social media to apologize and asked her followers to help locate the girl.Much to the delight of the young fan, Raducanu found her on Friday and extended an invitation to hit together on the court, creating a memorable moment for both the player and her admirer.""She barely missed a ball and she has a lot of courage to kind of go onto the court with a lot of people watching and start hitting balls, and it was nice to meet her and speak to her,"" Raducanu said. ""Obviously I felt incredibly bad about yesterday but I feel good and I feel happy that I was able to connect with her today.""Emma Raducanu is well aware that her career decisions have drawn skepticism from those who doubt her ability to secure another U.S. Open title. However, the sight of her name etched on the trophy and her image displayed alongside past champions serves as a powerful reminder of her previous triumph and her potential to achieve such greatness once more.""I think that's such an epic achievement and these two weeks I completed it,"" she said. ""So for me coming back here now, I come back with such a different outlook and just joy and promise, and it inspires me to want to do more.""",Emma Raducanu is the defending champion of the U.S. Open.

""Now I just need some clean air.""The International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) revealed that Sinner failed two drug tests, one during a tournament in Indian Wells, California, and another eight days later. However, it was determined that the banned anabolic steroid Clostebol entered his system unintentionally through a massage from Naldi.""Obviously it has been a very tough moment for me and my team,"" Sinner said. ""It still is, because it's quite fresh.""Sinner, the top-seeded man at the U.S. Open , is scheduled to face American Mackie McDonald, ranked 140th, in the first round on Tuesday.Despite the timing of the news, Sinner maintained his innocence, stating, ""Of course it's not ideal before a Grand Slam, but in my mind, I know that I haven't done anything wrong. I had to play, already, (for) months with this in my head, but just (was reminding) myself that I haven't done really anything wrong. I always respect these rules - and I always will respect these rules - of anti-doping"" as reported by AP.Considered a leader among the next generation of male tennis stars, Sinner has had an impressive 2024 season, with a 48-5 record and a tour-leading five titles.He recently won the Cincinnati Open, a hard-court tournament, in preparation for the U.S. Open. Frances Tiafoe, the American who lost to Sinner in the Cincinnati final, commented on the situation, saying, ""He's an incredible player, and, you know, (governing) bodies made a decision. They went and did that; he's cleared to play. That's pretty much what I have to say about it. All the best to him in the U.S. Open.""Sinner explained that Ferrara purchased an over-the-counter spray containing Clostebol in Italy and gave it to Naldi, who used it on a cut finger before giving Sinner a massage.The investigation found a trace amount of the steroid in Sinner's system, which he illustrated by counting out the number of zeroes before the ""1"" in the amount: .000000001.When asked if the episode would affect his reputation, Sinner responded, ""We will see now - now, moving forward. Because this, I can't really control.""He also expressed relief at the outcome, admitting that he was worried as it was his first time in such a situation, and hopefully his last.","Italian tennis star Jannik Sinner fired his fitness trainer, Umberto Ferrara, and physiotherapist, Giacomo Naldi.
