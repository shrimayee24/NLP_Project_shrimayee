Emeka Egbuka injury update: Buccaneers fear worst as star rookie’s hamstring issue adds to mounting crisis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/emeka-egbuka-injury-update-buccaneers-fear-worst-as-star-rookies-hamstring-issue-adds-to-mounting-crisis/articleshow/124514694.cms,"Star rookie wide receiver Emeka Egbuka suffered a hamstring injury during the Buccaneers' win over the 49ers, adding to the team's extensive injury list. This setback, with key receivers already sidelined, severely depletes Tampa Bay's offensive depth and poses a significant challenge for quarterback Baker Mayfield and head coach Todd Bowles as they face upcoming matchups.

Buccaneers ’ offensive depth takes another brutal hit



Todd Bowles and Baker Mayfield face uphill challenge amid injury chaos

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ injury nightmare just got worse. Star rookie wide receiver Emeka Egbuka became the latest player to go down, suffering a hamstring injury during Sunday’s win over the San Francisco 49ers. The 21-year-old phenom, who has quickly emerged as one of the top young offensive threats in the NFL , was officially ruled out in the fourth quarter, casting uncertainty over his availability in the coming weeks.The Buccaneers have already been navigating through a minefield of injuries, and Egbuka’s setback couldn’t have come at a worse time. Tampa Bay entered the matchup without their top three wideouts — Mike Evans (hamstring), Chris Godwin Jr. (fibula), and Jalen McMillan (neck). Losing Egbuka left quarterback Baker Mayfield with a depleted receiving corps, forcing the team to lean heavily on depth players and creative play-calling.According to A to Z Sports, the rookie was listed as “doubtful to return” before being officially ruled out later in the game. He’s expected to undergo an MRI early this week to determine the severity of the injury. “We won’t know anything about the extent of Egbuka’s injury until Tuesday at the earliest,” the report noted.If Egbuka misses time, it would be a major blow to the Buccaneers’ passing attack. The Ohio State standout had been in early contention for Offensive Rookie of the Year, impressing fans and analysts alike with his explosive playmaking and maturity on the field.The Buccaneers’ roster has been riddled with injuries across the board, including key starters like Cody Mauch, Luke Goedeke, Calijah Kancey, and Zyon McCollum. Head coach Todd Bowles has managed to keep the team competitive despite the setbacks, guiding Tampa Bay to an impressive 5-1 record behind Mayfield’s MVP-caliber performances.However, if Egbuka’s injury sidelines him for an extended period, Bowles and offensive coordinator Josh Grizzard will need to dig deep into their playbook to keep the offense afloat.With a crucial Monday Night Football matchup against the Detroit Lions looming, the Buccaneers’ resilience is about to be tested yet again and whether Mayfield’s magic can continue without his top weapons remains the biggest question in Tampa Bay.Also Read: Fred Warner injury update: 49ers All-Pro linebacker suffers severe ankle dislocation in emotional scene vs. Buccaneers","Rookie wide receiver Emeka Egbuka suffered a hamstring injury during the Buccaneers' win over the 49ers.

Connor McDavid’s selfless contract raises a brutal question: Do the Oilers deserve him?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/connor-mcdavids-selfless-contract-raises-a-brutal-question-do-the-oilers-deserve-him/articleshow/124500451.cms,"Edmonton Oilers fans are relieved by Connor McDavid's contract extension, securing him until 2028. While his value remains immense, the team faces pressure to build a championship-caliber roster around him and Leon Draisaitl. General Manager Stan Bowman is pursuing affordable talent, but goaltending and top-six stability are key concerns. Three seasons remain to deliver a Stanley Cup.

Connor McDavid’s long-term value still defines the Oilers’ identity

Edmonton’s roster needs balance before Connor McDavid’s new deal expires

When Connor McDavid signed a two-year contract extension with the Edmonton Oilers this fall, fans across Alberta breathed a collective sigh of relief. After months of speculation about whether the superstar might eventually test free agency, McDavid’s decision to stay, at a significant discount, felt like both a victory and a warning. The deal secures the NHL ’s most electrifying player through at least the 2027-28 season, but it also shines a spotlight on whether the Oilers have built a roster capable of delivering him the championship he’s long deserved.Connor McDavid’s impact on the Oilers extends far beyond the stat sheet. Since joining the team in 2015, he’s transformed Edmonton’s brand value, led them deep into the playoffs, and solidified his place among the sport’s all-time greats. Analysts continue to describe his contract as one of the biggest bargains in hockey. Even with his scoring rate slightly dipping over recent years, from 1.87 points per 60 in 2022-23 to 1.49 in 2024-25, his production remains elite.Comparing McDavid’s trajectory to Sidney Crosby’s at the same age paints an encouraging picture. Like Crosby, McDavid shows no sign of slowing down as he nears his late 20s, and projections suggest he could maintain his dominance well into his 30s.But the challenge isn’t his endurance, it’s what surrounds him.Under general manager Stan Bowman, the Oilers have made several aggressive moves to strengthen their core, from acquiring veterans like Mattias Ekholm and Jake Walman to bringing in depth pieces such as Jack Roslovic and Connor Ingram. Bowman’s recent spree of European signings and under-the-radar free agents signals a strategy shift: find affordable, high-upside players who can support McDavid and Leon Draisaitl without sacrificing future assets.Still, the holes are clear. Goaltending remains unreliable, and the team’s top-six forward group lacks long-term stability. Veterans like Adam Henrique are aging out, while promising rookies such as Matt Savoie and Ike Howard have yet to prove themselves.Also Read: Connor McDavid’s wife Lauren Kyle gushes over Leon Draisaitl’s wife’s stunning after-party look from their French wedding McDavid’s extension buys Bowman three seasons to deliver the ultimate goal, a Stanley Cup in Edmonton.

Tyreek Hill opens up about surgery, support, and faith during recovery

Tua Tagovailoa’s comeback effort adds optimism to Miami’s future

Miami Dolphins star Tyreek Hill has given fans a heartfelt glimpse into his recovery after suffering a devastating dislocated knee injury that ended his season. Known for his blazing speed and explosive plays, Hill, fondly nicknamed “The Cheetah”, is now channeling that same determination into his rehabilitation journey.Following reports that Tyreek Hill tore multiple ligaments, including his ACL, the wide receiver underwent surgery and is expected to miss the rest of the 2025 season. Despite the difficult setback, Hill’s recent video message showed optimism and gratitude for the support surrounding him.“I’m doing great, I’m doing fantastic. I’m walking. And God has blessed me to this point, this far. So I would not be in any other position,” Hill shared. “It all happened so fast, but you know, great surgeon, great team, Dolphins. Those guys are taking great care of me and obviously my family, so let’s get the journey started.”That spirit of resilience has been matched by unwavering support from his teammates and coaches. Tua Tagovailoa, De’Von Achane, and Coach Mike McDaniel have all reached out since the injury. “Our thoughts and our prayers are with him,” Tagovailoa said, echoing the team’s shared sentiment.Hill’s family has also been a crucial part of his recovery. The wideout shared heartfelt photos from his hospital bed alongside his mother, captioned “Blessed” and “Love my mom,” a reminder that his strength runs deeper than football.While Hill begins his road back, Tua Tagovailoa is battling his own physical hurdles. The Dolphins quarterback, limited by hip and thumb issues, was cleared for full participation ahead of the team’s clash with the Los Angeles Chargers.“Ultimately, he’s working through stuff for the week, and we’re not overly concerned for Sunday,” offensive coordinator Frank Smith said.Also Read: Indianapolis Colts cheerleader Morgan McLain melts hearts after using sign language to communicate with deaf 8-year-old fan Despite Miami’s 1–4 start, Tagovailoa’s performance; 1,008 passing yards, 10 touchdowns, and a 70.7% completion rate, has reinforced his status as the Dolphins’ leader.

In a Week 6 game on October 12, 2025, the Los Angeles Rams faced off against the Baltimore Ravens at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore. During the second quarter, Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua suffered a foot injury but was able to come back in the third quarter.The Rams went on to win the game 17-3 against the Ravens. Nacua, who was leading the NFL with 52 receptions and 588 receiving yards at the time, raised concerns among fans and the team when he hobbled off the field.In the second quarter, Nacua tried to grab a pass from quarterback Matthew Stafford in the end zone during a third-down play. He jumped up to challenge a 50/50 ball against Ravens cornerback Marlon Humphrey but landed hard, having trouble getting back up right away. Nacua held onto the lower part of his left leg, first attempting to walk but soon collapsing back onto the ground in the end zone.Trainers were looking after Nacua on the field, concentrating on his lower leg area, which looked like it involved his ankle or foot. He was eventually escorted off the field by two trainers and limped right to the tunnel for further assessment, without pausing at the sideline.Shortly after, the Rams announced that Nacua was questionable to return due to a foot injury.At the moment he exited, the game was tied, and his absence left Davante Adams as the key target for Stafford.Rams running back Blake Corum also limped toward the tunnel shortly after Nacua, who is listed as questionable to return with an ankle injury.Initial assessments from medical analysts indicated that Nacua's injury could be a high ankle sprain or maybe a fibula fracture, based on how his left toes appeared to embed into the turf when he landed. Nacua was also seen momentarily holding his midsection, although the primary concern was reported to be his foot.Nacua made his way back to the Rams' sideline before halftime, wearing his helmet, which showed he was checking his mobility. He got back into the game in the third quarter, much to the relief of both the team and the fans.However, he didn't play much; he was on the field only a little in the second half and didn't make any catches after getting hurt. Even with his limited role, his return helped the Rams keep their offensive flow, leading to their final 17-3 victory.Nacua was back on the sidelines with his helmet on just before the third quarter started. She later clarified that he wasn't on the field for the initial drive of the second half, recommending that people be cautious about expecting him to be fully involved. His toughness was a key point in the reports, which mentioned that even though he returned, he could still be feeling considerable discomfort.Puka Nacua re-entered the game with the Los Angeles Rams during the third quarter. His involvement was limited, and he didn’t make any receptions, but his presence was key in keeping the offensive rhythm going.

The Man Who took the life of TikToker Yoon Ji-ah — The Dark Truth Behind “Black Cat”

The digital world in South Korea is mourning after losing Yoon Ji-ah who was known for being a TikToker and live streamer with more than 300,000 fans. On September 11, she was found dead on a secluded mountain in Muju County, North Jeolla Province, only a few hours after her last live stream. The terrifying circumstances of her passing have once again raised the issues of the dark side of fan communities and influencer security in the era of the internet.Police have indicated that Yoon Ji-ah met with her death about 30 minutes after cutting off her last stream. The 30-year-old digital star was pronounced dead with serious physical injuries inflicted on her body through beating, strangling, and asphyxias. Later, the medical examiner declared the cause of death to be suffocation from neck compression.Initially, the fan's affection reportedly transformed into obsession. Choi, who presented himself as a CEO enjoying success, was actually an individual who had gotten into deep financial trouble and lost his home through auction. He had created a fake persona and was financially supported which led him to create a close bond with Yoon and even convince her to go into business together.But there were reports about Yoon having recently sought to break the ties claiming controlling behavior and demanding schedule as reasons. The CCTV clips released by the detectives showed Choi kneeling and asking for forgiveness just before the tragic event. As per his later confession, he dragged her into her car before killing.After the murder, Choi made an effort to hide his actions, dressing up with a suitcase, and taking several stops to misdirect the police before he left Yoon's body on the mountainside. He was captured 12 hours after the incident. He first proclaimed his innocence but later admitted it when the police found the corpse.The death of Yoon Ji-ah has created a wave of nationwide protests and mourning compared to which the calls for more effective safety measures for content creators against the obsessive online behavior are stronger than ever. Her death serves as a grim reminder of the dangers influencers face, prompting urgent calls for stronger digital safety laws, mental health awareness, and accountability within online communities to prevent similar tragedies. Yoon Ji-ah’s story stands as a haunting reminder of love turned obsession, fame turned fear, and the urgent need to protect those who bring light to the digital world.","Yoon Ji-ah was found dead on a mountain in North Jeolla Province, South Korea.

Former NFL quarterback and current Fox Sports analyst, Mark Sanchez, was released from a hospital and police custody on Sunday, a week after an altercation that resulted in multiple stab wounds and a series of criminal charges against him. The incident happened on October 4 and has left the former Jets quarterback recovering while facing potential felony charges in Indiana.Mark Sanchez, 38, who played in the NFL for 10 years before retiring in 2019, got into a violent altercation with a 69-year-old truck driver, Perry Tole, outside a hotel in Indianapolis. Authorities say the fight started over a parking dispute but quickly turned physical. Tole, who works for a company called Restaurant Technologies, allegedly sprayed Sanchez with pepper spray and then stabbed him in the chest. Tole claimed he acted in self-defense. Police reports also suggest that Sanchez appeared intoxicated, with witnesses noting slurred speech and the smell of alcohol.Sanchez was initially arrested on charges including battery resulting in serious injury, public intoxication, and unlawful entry of a vehicle. The altercation led to Sanchez being hospitalized with multiple stab wounds, but the nature of his injuries was not disclosed in detail.Tole reportedly suffered a severe facial laceration in the fight.Sanchez, now recovering from his injuries, spoke publicly for the first time on Sunday. In an emotional statement, he thanked the first responders and medical staff that helped save his life, as well as law enforcement for their role in the incident. ""Right now I am just kind of focused on my recovery and I just want to thank the first responders, Eskenazi hospital, Marion County sheriff and the Indianapolis Police Department, metro PD,"" Sanchez told local station FOX59/CBS4. “But I'm focused on my recovery, and I just want to see my wife, I want to see my son, my two baby girls.”However, he declined to comment on the charges against him, saying, “There will be a day to answer all these questions, and unfortunately, today is not that day. I guess the real thing here is I just want to thank Dr. (Lindsey) Mossler, the surgeon. She saved my life. So, I'm grateful for that.""Despite the severity of the charges he faces, Sanchez was permitted to leave Indiana on Sunday. He was required to be fingerprinted and photographed before being released. A pretrial conference has been set for November 5 in Indianapolis, where further legal proceedings will unfold.Mark Sanchez's career in the NFL spanned ten seasons, with notable pitstops at the New York Jets, Philadelphia Eagles, Dallas Cowboys, and Washington Football Team.

What makes Test cricket so unmatched? Ramji Srinivasan on Virat Kohli's red-ball greatness

Poll Do you think Ramiz Raja's comment about Babar Azam was uncalled for? Yes, it was inappropriate. No, it was just commentary.

Former cricketer Ramiz Raja's controversial comment about Pakistan captain Babar Azam during the first Test match against South Africa at Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore on Sunday has gone viral.The incident occurred on Day 1 when Raja, while commentating, made a controversial remark as Babar reviewed a caught-behind decision against him.The incident took place on the first ball of the 48th over when Babar Azam, who was batting at one run, faced a delivery from left-arm spinner Senuran Muthusamy . The ball pitched and turned away as Babar attempted to defend, leading to an appeal.The on-field umpire initially gave Babar not out, believing there was no edge. South Africa immediately opted for the Decision Review System (DRS), and replays showed there was no edge, resulting in Babar staying at the crease.During the review process, Ramiz Raja, as per the viral post on social media, was heard saying on commentary, ""Haan haan yeh abh drama karega"" (If this is given out, he'll create drama), a comment that quickly gained attention on social media platforms.Though, TimesofIndia.com can't confirm the claim. Furthermore, Raja hasn't yet spoken about the incident.Throughout his brief innings, Babar had looked steady at the crease, alternating between stepping forward and going deep in his crease to handle the turning deliveries. However, the mounting pressure from the South African spinners eventually resulted in his wicket.Babar Azam went on to score 23 runs from 48 balls in his innings, displaying confident batting with elegant shots, including a well-timed boundary through mid-on off Muthusamy.He demonstrated good technique against the spinners, using soft hands and proper footwork.Pakistan ended the first day of the first Test on a high note, reaching 313/5 at stumps.","Ramiz Raja's comment about Babar Azam has gone viral on social media.

Brad Marchand leads the charge as Florida battles through Aleksander Barkov and Matthew Tkachuk 's absences



Brad Marchand guides Florida to an unbeaten start despite major injuries



Brad Marchand’s arrival in Florida has sparked a new chapter in his storied NHL career. The veteran winger, known for his grit and leadership, has quickly become the heartbeat of the Florida Panthers. With team captain Aleksander Barkov and star forward Matthew Tkachuk sidelined due to injuries, Marchand has stepped up as the emotional and strategic leader guiding the defending Stanley Cup champions through a challenging start to the 2025-26 season.When the Panthers acquired Brad Marchand from the Boston Bruins earlier this year, it sent shockwaves through the league. Yet, the 37-year-old instantly proved his worth, seamlessly fitting into Florida’s system and earning the respect of his new teammates. His blend of energy, tenacity, and championship experience was instrumental in helping the Panthers capture their second consecutive Stanley Cup title last season.Now, with both Barkov and Tkachuk out of action, Marchand has emerged as the team’s guiding force on and off the ice. His influence extends beyond goals and assists; it’s about setting the tone every night. “I’m the old guy, a little bit more of a voice, but I felt comfortable from day one in here, talking and communicating.”Marchand said in a recent post-game chat. “It’s such a welcoming crew in there. What I love about our group is everyone leads in their own way. You don’t really need anyone to take charge. Just everybody’s so dialed in here.”The Panthers have opened the new season strong, posting a perfect 3-0-0 record despite missing two of their top scorers. Much of that resilience can be traced to Marchand’s leadership. He’s helped keep the locker room focused, ensuring younger players rise to the occasion. His veteran mindset, treating adversity as an opportunit,y has set the tone for the entire roster.Marchand’s transition to Florida has also highlighted his ability to adapt. Once known as Boston’s fiery agitator, he’s embraced a mentor’s role in Miami, earning admiration from fans and teammates alike. His influence has been vital in maintaining the Panthers’ identity as a disciplined, high-energy squad even without their cornerstone stars.As the season unfolds, Brad Marchand’s leadership could define Florida’s quest for a third straight Stanley Cup run. With Barkov and Tkachuk recovering, the Panthers will rely on his experience to keep their championship hopes alive, and so far, he’s proving that age is no barrier to impact.Also Read: Seattle Kraken unveil F1 movie-inspired Sonny Hayes Helmet for ‘Player of the Game’ award","Brad Marchand has quickly become the heartbeat of the Florida Panthers.

Latest developments around the Jets ahead of Week 6

Justin Fields has been under the microscope all season. His flashes of brilliance haven’t been enough to lift the New York Jets from the bottom of the standings, and now, as they prepare to face the Denver Broncos in London, fans are asking one question, will Fields take the field this Sunday? The spotlight is as bright as ever, and for the Jets, every snap could shape the direction of their season.Let’s break down where things stand.Yes, Justin Fields is expected to play in the Week 6 game against the Denver Broncos at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.The Jets quarterback appeared on track throughout the week and participated fully in team activities. Head coach Aaron Glenn confirmed no setbacks during Friday’s practice session, signaling that Fields will start.That said, New York’s offensive situation remains complicated. Wide receiver Allen Lazard did not travel with the team due to personal reasons, and running back Michael Carter was ruled out with a concussion. Glenn told reporters in London, “So Lazard had a personal issue, and I'll tell you guys he will be out.”Fields enters the matchup looking to rebound from a sluggish start. Through five weeks, he has averaged 3.09 seconds to release the football, the third-slowest mark in the league, according to Next Gen Stats.When asked about the criticism, Fields brushed it off. “I don't really look at stats if I'm being honest with you,” he said. “My job is to put as many points up on the board, whether that's the least amount of time to throw, whether that's the most. ”Despite the 0-5 start, Fields has been one of the few bright spots in New York’s offense, combining mobility with flashes of strong decision-making. He’ll need both to handle a Denver defense that ranks near the top of the league in sacks and pressures.The Broncos and Jets square off in London for an early Sunday showdown, marking Denver’s third regular-season international appearance.Here’s everything you need to know:Sean Payton’s team arrives with momentum after back‑to‑back wins, including a comeback victory against the Philadelphia Eagles. Denver’s defense, led by outside linebacker Nik Bonitto, who already has seven sacks — will look to keep Fields under pressure from the first snap.On the other side, the Jets will rely on running back Breece Hall to stabilize the offense and take pressure off Fields, though Denver’s top‑five rushing defense presents a major challenge.The Jets’ struggles have extended beyond the scoreboard. New York has yet to record a single defensive turnover through five games, the franchise’s worst start since 1933. For a unit built around defensive identity, that’s a stunning statistic.Coach Glenn has maintained optimism, drawing comparisons to other coaches who turned slow starts into success stories. “Kyle Shanahan started 0-5 with the 49ers, too,” Glenn reminded reporters. Still, the Jets’ issues run deep: missed tackles, offensive miscues, and a lack of execution in critical moments.The return of defensive end Jermaine Johnson could inject some life into the pass rush. Johnson, who has been sidelined since Week 2, is expected to play in London. His presence should complement Will McDonald IV and provide a much‑needed spark to a defense desperate for takeaways.Meanwhile, Denver remains cautious but confident. “Desperate teams always win in this league,” tackle Mike McGlinchey said earlier this week. “I think we’re pretty desperate to be great. They’re ready to get their first win. It should be a great matchup.”As both teams take the field at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, the stakes couldn’t be clearer, the Broncos are chasing consistency, and the Jets are simply chasing their first win. Whether Fields can deliver it may define not just this game, but the rest of New York’s season.","New York Jets quarterback Justin Fields is expected to play in the Week 6 game against the Denver Broncos at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.

49ers lose their defensive heartbeat early in a critical game

Fred Warner’s elite leadership makes the setback even tougher for San Francisco

San Francisco 49ers star linebacker Fred Warner suffered what appears to be a dislocated right ankle during Sunday’s matchup against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, leaving both teammates and fans in visible distress. The emotional moment unfolded in the first quarter, with Warner being carted off the field as players from both sides took a knee in solidarity.According to The Athletic’s Dianna Russini, “NEWS: 49ers LB Fred Warner suffered a dislocated right ankle Sunday vs. the Buccaneers, per source. San Francisco’s All-Pro linebacker will meet with doctors to determine how much time he will miss.” The injury occurred when Warner got rolled up on during a tackle attempt by safety Ji’Ayir Brown on Buccaneers running back Rachaad White, a freak play that immediately raised alarm.Moments later, Warner’s right leg was secured in an air cast before he was taken off the field. The sight of one of the NFL ’s most dominant defenders being carted away in pain struck a nerve with the 49ers organization and fan base alike. The team has yet to release an official timetable, but such injuries often require extended recovery and rehabilitation periods.At just 28, Fred Warner has built a reputation as the emotional and strategic leader of the 49ers defense.A four-time All-Pro since 2020 and the heartbeat of San Francisco’s unit, Warner has consistently anchored one of the NFL’s most feared defensive fronts. Coming off a 2024 season that featured 131 tackles, four forced fumbles, and a pick-six, his 2025 campaign was already shaping up as another elite performance with 50 tackles entering Sunday’s game.Losing Warner is not just a tactical blow, it’s an emotional one. His presence on the field sets the tone for San Francisco’s defense, which thrives on his intensity and football IQ. If the injury keeps him sidelined for an extended stretch, the 49ers may face one of their toughest challenges yet in maintaining their defensive dominance.For now, the entire NFL community is holding its breath, hoping one of the league’s best defenders can make a full and speedy recovery.Also Read: The surprising reason why Chiefs WR Hollywood Brown was fined $12,172 after the Jaguars clash","Fred Warner suffered what appears to be a dislocated right ankle against the Buccaneers.

The Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders see a life-changing raise after years of fighting for fair pay

The new pay reflects the Cowboys’ brand power and public influence

For decades, the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders have been known as more than just sideline entertainers, they’ve been cultural icons, ambassadors of the franchise, and symbols of American sports glamour. Now, for the first time in years, their compensation is finally catching up with their star power.After years of discussion about fairness and visibility, members of the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders received a staggering 400% pay increase ahead of the 2025 NFL season. While official salary figures remain undisclosed, reports indicate that a veteran cheerleader now earns around $150,000 per year, a major step forward from previous rates. However, despite the raise, the cheerleaders still do not receive health insurance from the team.The news was revealed by team veteran Megan McElaney, a four-year member from Oceanside, California, during the hit Netflix series America’s Sweethearts: Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders. “Our efforts were heard and they wanted to give us a raise,” McElaney shared. “And we ended up getting a 400% increase, which is like, life-changing.”This raise follows years of gradual advocacy for better pay. Back in 2019, the cheerleaders’ per-game rate doubled from $200 to $400. Former member Kristin Westbrook also shed light on the earlier pay structure, revealing that during her time, cheerleaders earned “$15/hour” for practice, along with “flat fees for appearances – $100 (x # of years on the team).”The Cowboys’ cheerleaders have long been an integral part of the team’s identity, a brand recognized far beyond the gridiron. From global appearances to Halloween costumes inspired by their iconic uniforms, the cheerleaders symbolize both tradition and excellence. Their visibility has only grown with Netflix’s behind-the-scenes docuseries, which gave fans a closer look at the hard work behind the glamour.Also Read: “So embarrassing”: Dallas Cowboys cheerleader sparks viral debate after revealing surprising pom-pom rule behind the glamour While disparities between NFL players and cheerleaders remain, this pay raise marks a major cultural shift.

Swift's new song, 'CANCELLED!', is believed to be a tribute to Lively's public struggles. This potential reunion hints at Swift rebalancing her life amidst her relationship with Travis Kelce and her global tour.

Friendship whispers resurface after Blake Lively’s lawsuit drama

How Travis Kelce fits into Taylor Swift’s redefined circle



As Taylor Swift continues her global domination with The Life of a Showgirl, fans are now shifting their attention from her chart-topping music to her rekindled friendships and perhaps even her relationship balance with NFL star Travis Kelce . The latest whisper comes from Deuxmoi, where insiders claim Swift and her longtime friend Blake Lively may have quietly reunited after months of rumored distance.According to Deuxmoi’s October 9th Deux/U podcast, a discreet source revealed that Taylor Swift and Blake Lively “may have allegedly seen each other in the last few weeks.” The insider described the encounter as “not strained, rather friends just being friends.” The rumor comes months after Lively’s public “It Ends With Us” lawsuit against actor Justin Baldoni, which narrowly brushed against Swift’s name.While details remain private, the speculation has sparked excitement among fans who feared the pair’s friendship had fizzled. Observant Swifties also pointed out that Swift was recently spotted wearing a Lorraine Schwartz bracelet—the same one Lively wore to the It Ends With Us London premiere in 2024. Was it a subtle nod of support, or just another of Swift’s famous Easter eggs?Adding another layer, Swift’s track “CANCELLED!” from her new album has stirred conversation for its apparent empathy toward a friend facing public backlash.

Holly Campbell’s candid take on night games

Dan Campbell wary of Mahomes’ brilliance



The Detroit Lions are charging into Week 6 with confidence, holding a 4-1 record and the top spot in the NFC North. Their next challenge? A primetime showdown with the Kansas City Chiefs, led by none other than Patrick Mahomes . As excitement builds, Lions head coach Dan Campbell is well aware of the task ahead — and even his wife, Holly Campbell, is feeling the nerves in her own way.While the spotlight will be bright at Arrowhead Stadium, not everyone in the Campbell household is thrilled about the late-night timing. Holly Campbell, who has been by Dan’s side since their 1999 marriage and is a regular at both home and away games, recently shared a candid thought on Instagram. Posting a graphic for the Lions-Chiefs clash, she wrote simply, “I hate night games.”Her honesty resonated with fans who adore her down-to-earth personality. Just a week earlier, Holly was all smiles in Cincinnati, posting a celebratory video after Detroit’s 37-24 victory over the Bengals, captioning it, “We came, we saw, we conquered!! The 2025 Lion’s Ladies and one Dude Road Trip is in the books!!”Campbell didn’t hold back when discussing what makes facing Mahomes such a daunting assignment. “First of all, he can smell a rat from a mile away,” Campbell said. “If you're going to disguise, boy it better be worthy of a Grammy. This guy sees it all... He can alter protections, he can get to different things in the passing game.”Detroit’s defense has been sharp, but with a few injuries in the secondary, Campbell knows his team will need to be near perfect to contain Mahomes and his dynamic offense. Fortunately, quarterback Jared Goff has been in elite form, leading the league in completion percentage (75.2%) and tied for the most passing touchdowns (12).The Lions’ high-powered offense ranks No. 1 in scoring — a sign that Sunday night’s matchup could turn into an offensive spectacle.As the Lions prepare for another primetime test, fans will be tuning in — whether from the edge of their seats or, like Holly, wishing it started just a bit earlier. The Detroit Lions vs Kansas City Chiefs game airs Sunday night on NBC, promising fireworks on and off the field.Also Read: Fred Warner injury update: 49ers All-Pro linebacker suffers severe ankle dislocation in emotional scene vs. Buccaneers","The Detroit Lions host the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday night.

From Nebraska roots to NFL spotlight: Emily Wilkinson ’s rise alongside Baker Mayfield

The supportive influencer behind Baker Mayfield’s comeback season

Baker Mayfield’s resurgence with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers has him back in MVP conversations, but behind every big game, there’s someone quietly cheering him on his wife, Emily Wilkinson Mayfield. Their relationship, built long before Baker’s NFL stardom, has evolved from a chance FaceTime introduction to a full-fledged family with their daughter, Kova Jade, born in April 2024.Born in Nebraska in 1991, Emily Wilkinson’s journey to the spotlight wasn’t one of instant fame. After graduating from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln with a degree in business administration, she moved to Los Angeles to work as a patient coordinator at a plastic surgery clinic. That’s where her life took a turn, when she met Mayfield through a mutual friend in 2017.At first, Wilkinson wasn’t impressed. “I was assuming he’d be the typical playboy athlete,” she admitted to ESPN. But Baker was persistent, following and unfollowing her on Instagram to get her attention. Once they finally met in person before the Rose Bowl, everything changed. “We haven’t really been apart since,” she told Brides.The couple got engaged after just six months and tied the knot in July 2019 at the scenic Calamigos Ranch in Malibu, surrounded by 350 guests, including NFL stars like Saquon Barkley and Odell Beckham Jr.Now a full-time influencer with over 224,000 Instagram followers, Emily has turned her platform into a space where she shares glimpses of family life, travel, and her unwavering support for Baker. She also appeared alongside her husband in the Progressive commercial series, “At Home with Baker Mayfield,” offering fans a humorous peek at their dynamic off the field.As Mayfield continues to silence critics and lead Tampa Bay to a 5-1 start, fans are calling it his career revival. Despite playing without several top receivers, Mayfield has been unstoppable, throwing 12 touchdowns to just one interception this season.And through it all, Emily remains his anchor. Her heartfelt post after Kova Jade’s birth says it all: “She is truly everything we prayed for, and more. Daddy is so smitten, and Mama wants to pause time forever.”Behind every MVP-worthy performance, there’s a story of love, faith, and resilience and for Baker Mayfield, Emily Wilkinson is the constant in all of it.Also Read: Fred Warner injury update: 49ers All-Pro linebacker suffers severe ankle dislocation in emotional scene vs. Buccaneers","Emily Wilkinson Mayfield is the wife of Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Baker Mayfield.

Late update shocks Chiefs ahead of crucial prime-time matchup

Kansas City’s offensive line faces new pressure against Lions’ defense

The Kansas City Chiefs were dealt a surprise setback just hours before kickoff on Sunday night, as starting left tackle Josh Simmons was unexpectedly ruled out for the team’s Week 6 showdown against the Detroit Lions. The decision, which came after Simmons was added to the injury report late in the afternoon, had nothing to do with a physical setback, instead, it stemmed from a family emergency that forced the 24-year-old lineman to return to California.NFL Network insiders Ian Rapoport and Mike Garafolo broke the story, reporting, “Chiefs OT Josh Simmons is listed as questionable for tonight against the Lions, is dealing with a family matter back home in California.” Simmons was later downgraded to inactive when the official roster was released roughly 90 minutes before kickoff.This marks the second straight week Josh Simmons has appeared on the game-day injury report, last Monday, he was listed due to an illness but managed to play through it. However, Sunday’s situation was far more personal and beyond the realm of typical injury concerns. The Chiefs have not provided any additional details about the nature of the emergency, and out of respect for Simmons’ privacy, head coach Andy Reid is expected to refrain from elaborating further.Without Simmons, the Chiefs turned to backup options Wanya Morris and Jaylon Moore to fill the void at tackle, both significant downgrades against a dangerous Detroit pass rush led by Aidan Hutchinson, who entered the game ranked among the league’s top five in sacks. The matchup already carried major implications for Kansas City’s offensive rhythm, particularly in protecting Patrick Mahomes , and losing their starting left tackle only intensified the challenge.As the Chiefs continue to battle injuries and off-field disruptions, the focus now shifts to Simmons’ well-being and potential return. While his absence created a ripple effect on the field, the team made it clear that family comes first, a sentiment that resonates deeply in the locker room of a Super Bowl-caliber roster.Also Read: Emeka Egbuka injury update: Buccaneers fear worst as star rookie’s hamstring issue adds to mounting crisis","Kansas City Chiefs' starting left tackle, Josh Simmons, was unexpectedly ruled out for their Week 6 game against the Detroit Lions.

Ryan Clark warns A.J. Brown about media scrutiny following Eagles’ secret meeting denial

Does A.J. Brown NOT want to be an EAGLE? + Philadelphia's performance | First Take

A.J. Brown, Jalen Hurts , and Saquon Barkley under spotlight as Eagles struggle midseason



The Philadelphia Eagles’ 2025 season has started with high expectations, but recent struggles are testing both the team and its star players. After a promising 4-0 start, the Eagles have dropped two consecutive games, reigniting concerns about consistency and leadership. Amid the slump, A.J. Brown, Jalen Hurts, and Saquon Barkley reportedly held a private meeting, though Brown publicly denied it — sparking controversy and drawing a strong warning from NFL analyst Ryan Clark.When asked about the alleged meeting, A.J. Brown refused to confirm or deny it, a move that caught the attention of Ryan Clark on ESPN’s First Take. Clark didn’t mince words, cautioning the wide receiver that denying or sidestepping the media could have serious consequences. “You’re playing in the face of the media,” Clark said. “They’re going to mess with your life. They’re going to mess with your career. They’re going to make it difficult to function. ”Clark’s comments highlight the delicate balance NFL players must maintain between privacy and accountability. While locker room discussions are internal matters, the media has the power to shape public perception, and players who appear evasive can face intensified scrutiny.For Brown, who is one of the Eagles’ most visible stars, this warning carries extra weight.The Eagles’ recent slide has put the spotlight on team dynamics. Brown, Barkley, and Hurts are expected to lead both on and off the field, but the reported meeting suggests frustration may be mounting behind closed doors. While private discussions can help realign focus and strategy, the denial from Brown has fueled speculation about internal disagreements and how the team is handling its challenges.With the Eagles facing mounting pressure, the performance and decisions of Brown, Hurts, and Barkley are under intense scrutiny. How the star trio handles internal tension and media challenges could have a major impact on the team’s ability to regain momentum and stabilize their 2025 season.Philadelphia’s early-season promise now hangs in the balance. If the Eagles’ leaders can turn tension into accountability, there’s potential to regain momentum. However, missteps with media relations, as highlighted by Clark’s warning to Brown, could amplify pressure and derail focus. For the Eagles and their stars, managing both on-field performance and public perception will be key to salvaging the season.Also Read: “Just to clear this up”: A.J.

The Transformation

Two Bodies, One Soul





On June 12, two videos went viral. Both had a touch of the surreal. The first one was of a plane taking off, like planes routinely do, and then, within seconds, descending unhurriedly, unfathomably, like a giant suicidal bird. This couldn’t be real; except that it was. You could feel the heat and horror as the plane crashed into a building and became a ball of fire. These things don’t happen, till they do.The second video was equally surreal, maybe even more so. You can see black smoke curling up in greedy swirls, and the occasional tongue-lash of orange flames. This is the compound, about 1.7km from the Ahmedabad airport, where AI 171 had crashed within 40 seconds of takeoff. You can hear people screaming. You can hear sirens wailing. And then the screaming becomes even more hysterical. At the edge of the screen appears a figure, walking out of the black inferno. He is limping slightly. A man in a white tee and grey trousers. The cameras are zooming in on him. There’s some blood on his T-shirt. He’s holding a phone as he walks. He looks halfcrazed. He is saying something in Gujarati. The same thing over and over again.“Plane fatyo che ! Plane fatyo che ! (The plane has exploded.)”We had all seen the plane crash and explode, but coming from him, the words took on a different meaning. Because he was in the plane that exploded. There were 242 people on board the Dreamliner that day, including his brother Ajaykumar. Everyone else but him had died, some charred beyond recognition. And he was walking; bruised, but in his senses; sane enough to register that “Plane fatyo che !”That was four months ago. Everyone followed the story of 43-year-old Viswashkumar Ramesh’s miraculous survival in minute detail. Cameras chased him to Ahmedabad Civil Hospital, where he was admitted. His eyes were puffed, his left cheek badly bruised. But he spoke to reporters. He asked about his brother, who was dead. He met Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who visited him. And then, after five days, he went home — to Diu.But if you try to reach Viswashkumar now, you will hit a wall. He won’t talk to anyone. Whenreporters reached his house in Diu two days ago, his father Ramesh Bhaliya said he had left for London a few days ago. In London, Viswashkumar has hired Radd Seiger and Sanjiv Patel as advisers and spokesmen. Seiger, who is a lawyer and a crisis strategy consultant, textedthat “we have nothing to say at this time”. He later also objected tohaving approached the family in Diu, saying “this is not the way and… they should not approach the family in Diu any further”.Viswash’s house is in Bhucharwada village, about 8km inland from Diu’s sandy beaches. Ramesh met these correspondents at the gate of his house. No one is invited in. The family, once known for their warmth and laughter, now lives behind closed doors.Ayub Usmani is an old friend of Viswash and his brother Ajay. “They loved company, loved parties,” says Usmani, who drove them to the airport to catch AI 171. “We were supposed to leave by 10pm on June 11 to catch the flight the next day. But the two partied and had so much fun that we got delayed by two hours. They were in a great mood — joking, talking, full of life.”And the irony is that Ajay wasn’t even supposed to be on that flight. “Viswash was the only one returning to London,” says Shantilal Bhikha, Ajay’s father-in-law. “Ajay decided at the last minute to join him. I wish he hadn’t.”In Bhucharwada, you realise how life can be transformed in the blink of an eye. And once transformed, how grief refuses to lift. “I wouldn’t wish this torment on my worst enemy,” says Viswash’s father Ramesh, standing at the gate of his house.Ramesh says Viswash now barely talks. He avoids calls. He left for London, probably in search of peace. “Only those who have suffered such a tragedy can understand this pain,” says Ramesh. “We have lost everything. I lost one son, and the other barely speaks. He is withdrawn. He does not even talk to his mother anymore.” Maybe distance will help him heal, he adds.Six weeks back, the family travelled back to the site of the crash, says Usmani. “They requested security to let them perform a small ritual. They go there again and again. It is their way of keeping Ajay close,” he said.Viswash is the eldest of Ramesh’s four sons. Ajay was the second eldest. And the two were very, very close. “They were inseparable… like ‘ do jism, ek jaan ’ (two bodies, one soul),” says Usmani.The brothers had lived in London for 15 years, running a garment business there and a fishing operation in Diu. Ajay had lost his two young daughters in 2021 and 2022. Viswash had been helping him cope.On the flight, Viswash was seated by the emergency exit in 11A. Ajay was in 11J. Luck, of the kind that no statistician can ever calculate, saved Viswash. Ajay stood no chance, like everyone else on that flight.Viswash would ask after his brother in the hospital. And then, once back home, would travel to Rajkot for therapy. His cousin Dhirendra Somabhai remembered how any talk of the crash would send him into panic. “He wanted to be alone most of the time.”Sometimes, surviving against all odds can also bring a sense of guilt. Viswash was seated by the exit in 11A. Ajay K., the kindest person one could know, checked on Viswash like everyone else would, asking about his hospital stay and how he was doing at home in Rajkot.","Vishwas Kumar Ramesh, 43, was the sole survivor of the Air India crash.

Why the Dallas Cowboys’ defense failed miserably

Dak Prescott delivers historic numbers while Dallas Cowboys struggle to secure wins

In Week 6 of the 2025 NFL season, the Dallas Cowboys headed to Charlotte to challenge the Carolina Panthers on October 12, 2025, at Bank of America Stadium. The final score was a 30-27 loss for Dallas, finalized by a 33-yard field goal from Panthers rookie kicker Ryan Fitzgerald as the game clock hit zero. This defeat left the Cowboys with a record of 2-3-1, while the Panthers improved to 3-3 overall and maintained an impressive 3-0 record at home. The game revealed some significant contrasts, with quarterback Dak Prescott having a turnover-free outing, but the Cowboys' defense failing to stop Carolina's offense, particularly in the running department.The Cowboys' defense, ranked 32nd in the league, allowed 30 points for the fourth time in 2025, struggling particularly against the run and pass. In the Panthers game, they permitted 216 rushing yards while Carolina's offense did ""pretty much whatever they wanted.""The unit is coordinated by new defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus, and the defense remains a work in progress, running man coverage on only 6.2% of plays, the lowest rate in the league. Pass rush has been nonexistent, averaging just one sack per game. Bad drafting on defense, ineffective free agent maneuvers, and no stability in the defensive coaching staff have contributed to these issues.In the game against Carolina, Dak Prescott completed 25 out of 34 passes, totaling 261 yards, three touchdowns, and no interceptions, which gave him a passer rating of 124.8. He also had two rushing attempts for -1 yard with no touchdowns. His QBR for this game was 90.2.

Poll What was the biggest surprise of the Hero Women's Indian Open? Shannon Tan's comeback Hitaashee's final round performance Three Indian players in the Top-5 Alice Hewson's missed opportunity

Final scores:

GURUGRAM: There were many twists in the final-day narrative of the Hero Women's Indian Open. Ultimately, it was Singapore's Shannon Tan who unexpectedly clinched her third Ladies European Tour title, the $64,000-plus cheque, and control of the Order of Merit with a seven-under total.There was heartbreak for Hitaashee Bakshi as the pressure of starting Championship day with a three-stroke lead took its toll on her. The onus was on the 21-year-old to break the nine-year jinx since Aditi Ashok became the first Indian player to lift the trophy, and she had been negotiating the whimsical DLF G&CC course well. Till Sunday.There were surprises in store. And they weren't pleasant.Although she started with an assuring birdie on the second hole, the pendulum swung back and forth and suddenly The journey on the front nine was fraught with obstacles. Three consecutive bogeys from the fifth was compounded by a double bogey on the eighth. The prepared script was torn apart after more bogeys on the 10th and 12th. There was a different role to play now. Securing a full Ladies European Tour card became the priority and the DLF pro probably found herself in a better headspace, holing two birdies for a 76, two strokes behind the winner.“Honestly, since yesterday, my mind was only on No 1, but this was one of those days,” she later reflected on her disappointing outing, before consoling herself with the thought she had jumped from 108 to 56 in the Merit list. “But it's okay, that's golf, right? You can be playing your best golf ever, but not get the result you wanted. On the other hand, I've just been told I get full playing privileges now for next year, and a spot in next week's Taiwan Open. ”Her lessons in finishing school, then? “I think that is something that I just want to keep to myself,” she managed a laugh.History was made, though. India had an unprecedented three players in the Top-5 as Pranavi Urs finished 4th and Avani Prashanth tied-5th.As Hitaashee faltered, Englishwoman Alice Hewson had one grasp on the trophy — with steady hands. But the accomplished swimmer from Hemel Hempstead sunk her hopes with one cursed drive into the water on the final 18th. Shannon Tan's hot putter, meanwhile, did the trick ahead of the leadergroup.The Singaporean began the day seven strokes behind Hitaashee and her fiveunder 67 was enough. Missing a birdie putt on the 18th, Tan headed to the range to prepare for a potential playoff. Alice could have in wonderland with a par but her double-bogey underwater excursion ensured Shannon's coronation.Hewson was magnanimous in defeat after her even-par round. “I couldn't be happier for Shannon. If you can't win yourself, it's always good when you see one of your mates win out here too.”For Tan, it took time for things to sink in. “I think I'm still pretty much in shock about what happened. I thought I had to make that putt (on 18) to maybe force a playoff. I walked off, and someone said I'm still in the race. I asked someone what's going on and figured out what happened back there.”Shannon revealed she had received her visa only on Tuesday. “I am in shock,” the 21-year-old repeated, “but I'm really grateful and glad I took the opportunity to play here.””-7 Shannon Tan (68-73-73-67); -6 Alice Hewson (Eng) (69-72-69-72); -5 Hitaashee Bakshi (Ind) (70-67-70-76); -4 Pranavi Urs (Ind) (72-67-73-72); -3 Kelsey Bennett (Aus) (71-71-72-71), Avani Prashanth (Ind) (73-71-70-71); Selected scores: +1 Vani Kapoor (Ind) (67-74-74-74) (T-10th); +3 Zara Anand (Ind-Am) (68-70-76-77), Mimi Rhodes (Eng) (76-70-71-74) (T-15th).",Shannon Tan won the Hero Women's Indian Open by one stroke.

Church and gym cut ties



The open letter: Defiance and justification



Read Daniel Keene’s open letter here



Some facts the elders don’t bother disputing

1. That when I asked on Sept. 10th if this would rise to the level of discipline Matt said “Brother this *is* discipline. If you’re asking if you’re barred from the table right now, no. But if you continue in this, yes.”

They then referenced my “make church discipline great again” post 3 times over two meetings to point out the irony and that in Matt’s words that’s “what we’re doing”.

2. That I was told to leave the church on Sept. 24th in a dozen different ways over a two hour meeting with 7 elders and one staff member. Should I have called for a vote? The Bylaws say the elders can simply remove you. What more was needed? There is no option for resignation in the bylaws.

3. That I expressed very clearly in writing and verbally in the 24th meeting that I wanted to remain as a member. That I was okay with losing my leadership positions I just simply wanted to be left alone and my disagreement with them should not be characterized as “not submitting”. In my own words I was “happy to sit in the pews”.

4. That I was called for +7 hours of interrogation in response to my post.

5. That I offered character witnesses from Indian friends. They declined.

6. That I asked to review my posts *against* racism. They declined.

7. That I asked Matt directly several times to please give me my offense in writing.

Here’s one of the direct written quotes….

“I feel very strongly that I would like the elders to communicate in writing the exact issue at hand and the sin I'm being called to repent of so as to avoid hearsay and division on anything other than the specific issue. There already seems to be some and I'm still confused about the issue.

No response was given.

And if you think those are the most egregious details I assure you they are not.





Texas businessman Daniel Keene recently sparked outrage with his anti-India social media post. The now deleted post has got him removed from his local church and gym and also prompted him to publish a defiant open ‘letter’ on X (formerly known as Twitter ). For the uninitiated, Keeene posted a video online of Ganesh Chaturthi procession which happened in his neighbourhood last month. Along with this he also wrote a controversial caption and asked for the cancellation of H-1B visas. “We have to cancel the H-1Bs. I want my kids to grow up in America. Not India,” Keene wrote in the now-deleted post. The video shared by Keene showed the Hindu religious celebration and it quickly went viral and drew a lot of backlash from the Indian American communities. Many also accused Keene of xenophobia (dislike against people of other countries) and religious intolerance.After the viral incident, Keene was reportedly asked to apologise by his church for what they described as a ‘sinful’ act. However, he refused to the demand and stated that he stood by his views on immigration and cultural integration. As a result of this, Keene was removed from both is church and gym memberships. “I will not take back my H-1B comment,” Keene reiterated in his open letter posted on X.In his open letter shared on X, Keene defended his stance and claimed that it was not about race or religion but about preserving the cultural identity of America. He also argued that large-scale immigration via H-1B visas was charging the character of suburban neighbourhoods and schools.","Texas businessman Daniel Keene recently sparked outrage with his anti-India social media post.

It was just enjoyment and a surreal feeling of being with the South African team. Playing with Kallis, Pollock, and who you were playing against… Sachin (Tendulkar), Sehwag (Virender), Ganguly (Sourav), Laxman (VVS), you are playing against some crazy players, the guys who we had grown up watching for ten years.

Poll Did India make the right decision to enforce the follow-on? Yes, it was the right choice. No, it was a mistake.

NEW DELHI: Did India not heed Ravindra Jadeja 's warning about the slow nature of the Kotla pitch after Day Two, when he explained how taking wickets would turn out to be “hard work” and require “more shoulder”?With the result not looking in any doubt, the point is academic—but if the Windies batters can stretch things further on the fourth morning, perhaps captain Gill and coach Gambhir will have a post-match rethink on their decision to enforce India's first follow-on with a lead of under 300 runs since June 2015 against Bangladesh in Fatullah.That time, however, a day's play had been washed out and the game was drawn. At the Kotla, the pitch's tendency to stay so slow may have tired the bowlers out even more. The surface is expected to eventually crumble a bit more but how soon will that be?“We thought the wicket was going to keep deteriorating and by the close of play it would be at its worst. It just seems to have slowed down even more. It's quite challenging to get any pace up,” India's assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate said.Explaining the mechanics of bowling on such surfaces, ten Doeschate said, “Sometimes the wickets are a bit unresponsive. Monitoring speed is the one thing you can play with. You saw every time Washy (Washington) bowled a little bit slower, he got more turn. The batter has a bit more time so it's about using the change in pace to induce a mistake.”Ten Doeschate explained that the hardness of the new ball prompted the team to hold back Kuldeep Yadav . “We felt one of the finger spinners could just get more grip,” he said. “I don't think we were a million miles off this afternoon. There were three very close decisions there. But yes, that mystery element makes Kuldeep a little bit more effective than the other two.”",Ravindra Jadeja warned that taking wickets would be 'hard work' and require'more shoulder' India's assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate said the wicket was going to keep deteriorating.

West Indies all-rounder Rahkeem Cornwall had a narrow escape during the National Cricket T10 League 2025 eliminator between Atlanta Kings CC and Los Angeles Waves CC at the University of Texas, Dallas, on Sunday.The incident occurred when Waves bowler Rumman Raees sent down a sharp bouncer that smashed into Cornwall’s helmet grill. The impact was so fierce that the ball got stuck between the bars of the helmet, getting stuck dangerously close to his eye.For a brief moment, play stopped as players rushed in to check on Cornwall. The opposition wicketkeeper could be seen frantically signalling for medical assistance thinking the worst had happened. Thankfully, the helmet held strong and prevented what could have been a serious injury.The video of the freak moment spread rapidly on social media, leaving fans stunned at how close the 32-year-old came to picking up a brutal injury. The ball visibly jammed into the grill without breaking through and needed some prying out by the batter, who broke into a light chuckle after the incident.Cornwall, who had looked in control until then, was retired out after scoring 17 off 14 balls.His side, Atlanta Kings, however, failed to chase down the target, managing 62 for 9 in their 10 overs. The Los Angeles Waves advanced to the next round with a 34-run win, thanks to the 96-run total they had amassed at the loss of 7 wickets.Fans and players alike expressed relief that Cornwall escaped unhurt, as seen by Raees' concerned expression and the way he immediately rushed to the batter to check on him. The incident also sparked more conversation about helmet safety and the finest of margins that separate close calls from potential injuries in the game.","West Indies all-rounder Rahkeem Cornwall had a narrow escape during the National Cricket T10 League 2025 eliminator between Atlanta Kings CC and Los Angeles Waves CC at the University of Texas, Dallas.

How did Bad Bunny become famous?



A voice for Puerto Rico



The MAGA backlash to the Super Bowl pick



Homeland Security Secretary makes threatening comments







""I think it's absolutely ridiculous,"" said President Donald Trump on ""Newsmax's Greg Kelly Reports"" on Monday, reacting to the news that Puerto Rican star, Bad Bunny , would headline the 2026 Super Bowl's iconic halftime show. ""I've never heard of him,"" Trump added.Renowned for his obsession with ratings, the US president has presumably since been informed that the global superstar holds significant streaming records. Bad Bunny's ""Un Verano Sin Ti"" (2022) is Spotify's most-streamed album of all time. He was the most-played artist on Spotify for three consecutive years, from 2020 to 2022. And this September, his residency finale, ""Una Más,"" became the most-watched single-artist performance on Amazon Music to date.The streamed performance concluded a series of 31 concerts held in San Juan, the capital city of Puerto Rico, which from July to September during hurricane season injected millions into the struggling economy of the Caribbean island. Estimates vary between $200 million (€172 million) and $700 million (€602 million).Benito Antonio Martinez Ocasio was born in 1994 in Vega Baja, Puerto Rico. Bad Bunny, whose stage name was inspired by a childhood photo of himself in a grumpy mood while dressed in a bunny suit started uploading his music to SoundCloud while he was still in college.In 2016, his song ""Soy Peor"" became a big hit on YouTube and led to a record deal.In the years that followed, collaborations with stars including Cardi B, J Balvin, Drake and Rosalia massively boosted his fame.Now dubbed the ""King of Latin Trap,"" Bad Bunny has won three Grammys and 12 Latin Grammys.He knows how to generate a social media buzz, all while creating authentic connections with his fans. He has 49.5 million followers on Instagram and more than 35 million on TikTok.A fashion icon, the musician subverts gender norms through playful self-expression, embracing nail art and mashing up floral motifs and unexpected colors.Beyond his unique sound that blends reggaeton, Latin trap, dancehall, hip-hop and other Caribbean references, he has also gained supporters by speaking out on issues like Puerto Rican identity, women's and LGBTQ+ rights and social justice.Despite the artist's success, many people outside the Latin music scene were not familiar with his name until the National Football League (NFL) revealed at the end of September that Bad Bunny would be the Super Bowl's halftime show star in February 2026.Bad Bunny with golden accessories in his hair at the Met Gala.""What I'm feeling goes beyond myself,"" Bad Bunny said in a statement as the announcement was made. ""It's for those who came before me and ran countless yards so I could come in and score a touchdown… this is for my people, my culture, and our history.""""He's not an American artist,"" Fox News host Tomi Lahren mistakenly claimed, a statement that was quickly slammed online, as everyone born in Puerto Rico including Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio is automatically a US citizen.The conservative media influencer's blunder highlights the fact that Puerto Rico's political status is complicated. As an unincorporated US territory, the island has a particular legal standing. As American citizens, Puerto Ricans — also known as Boricuas — can live, work and study in any US state or territory and move freely from one place to another. They are subject to US federal laws, pay into Social Security and Medicare, but they can't vote in US federal elections — unless they live on the mainland. An estimated 5.8 million do, according to 2021 census data.During the presidential campaign, a comedian at a Trump rally referred to Puerto Rico as ""a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean."" Even though Trump distanced himself from the remarks, the act led Bad Bunny to break his longstanding tradition of not weighing in on national politics; he endorsed Kamala Harris , who had pledged more support to the island.Now the Super Bowl announcement is causing backlash among members of the MAGA movement. While the NFL's annual league championship game is traditionally seen as a unifying cultural event in the US, some fans say they are planning to boycott it.Conservative political commentator Benny Johnson summarized on X why MAGA supporters find the singer problematic: ""Massive Trump hater — Anti-ICE activist — No songs in English."" His post included photos of the star's face decorated with pearls, his fingernails stylishly covered with dominoes.""The NFL is self-destructing year after year,"" added Johnson.Many conservatives were already outraged by this year's halftime show, headlined by Pulitzer Prize winner Kendrick Lamar . While much attention was given to the rapper's diss track against Drake, the performance also included symbols criticizing the rise of white supremacy and authoritarianism in the US.It's the seventh year in a row that the NFL has teamed up with Jay-Z's entertainment company, Roc Nation, for its halftime program, which explains the artistically innovative selection of headliners.Trump's Homeland Security Secretary, Kristi Noem , has announced that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents will ""be all over"" the 2026 Super Bowl. She also said the NFL will ""not be able to sleep at night"" over its decision to choose Bad Bunny as the halftime performer.Bad Bunny had previously explained that he didn't include any US mainland stops during his upcoming world tour, due to fears that ICE would raid his concerts.Bad Bunny wearing sunglasses and a fur hat performs on stage, with percussionists behind him.Over the weekend, the music superstar hosted the season premiere of ""Saturday Night Live,"" and he joked about the backlash in his opening monologue: ""I think everybody is happy about it even Fox News.""He also spoke a few sentences in Spanish in the monologue, expressing Latino pride and joy over the achievement, concluding: ""If you didn't understand what I just said, you have four months to learn!"" referring to the time left before the football event in February. Bad Bunny will be making history by performing his set entirely in Spanish.""It would be a good time to pass my bill to make English the official language of America,"" far-right Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Green wrote on X in reaction to the show even though Trump has already signed an executive order making English the country's official language in March. Greene added: ""And the NFL needs to stop having demonic sexual performances during its halftime shows.""Meanwhile, Bad Bunny's music catalog has seen a jump in streams amid the backlash. And as different observers have noted, the NFL's move is presumably not so much about promoting diversity, as about increasing global ratings.Still, as The New York Times anticipates, the political impact of Bad Bunny's show could extend ""long after the game's final touchdown.""","Puerto Rican star, Bad Bunny, will headline the 2026 Super Bowl's iconic halftime show. The announcement caused backlash among members of the MAGA movement. Bad Bunny's ""Un Verano Sin Ti"" (2022) is Spotify's most-streamed album of all time.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124505333,imgsize-782468,width-400,resizemode-4/image-2025-10-12t220304805.jpg"
