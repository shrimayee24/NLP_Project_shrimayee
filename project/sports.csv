"Now a star in orbit, Shubhanshu Shukla was always a natural in the sky",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/now-a-star-in-orbit-shubhanshu-shukla-was-always-a-natural-in-the-sky/articleshow/122118986.cms,"BENGALURU: He was the kind of cadet who didn’t just learn to fly — he belonged in the sky. Years before Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla became the first Indian to board the International Space Station (ISS), he was already turning heads in the cockpit of a Super Dimona aircraft at the National Defence Academy (NDA).Back then, he was just another cadet from the Hunter Squadron — call sign not yet famous, dreams still earthbound. But to the instructor watching closely from the co-pilot’s seat, one thing was clear: the young man had wings.“He had a natural flair for flying,” recalled Group Captain (retd) Anupam Banerjee, Shukla’s first flying instructor at NDA. “In just the first few sorties, we could tell. Some cadets struggle with the feel of the controls or spatial awareness. Not Shukla. He was confident, intuitive — a very natural flier.”It was 20 years ago. The aircraft was an Austrian-built HK-36TC Super Dimona, used for ab-initio flying exposure at NDA before cadets move on to formal pilot training at the Air Force Academy.Shux, as Banerjee recalled, aced those initial flights — an early indication of the career that lay ahead: Jaguars, test pilot school, and finally, a ride to low-Earth orbit on Axiom-4 (Ax-4).But what truly stood out, Banerjee said, wasn’t just skill. “He was sincere, extremely hardworking, and that’s a rare combination when paired with ability. I told him then — you’ll go far if you keep this up.”Years later, when Shukla was preparing for spaceflight, he sent Banerjee a message. He hadn’t forgotten the words. “He told me he remembered what I’d said: that it’s not enough to be a good flier or officer — you must be a good human being. That stayed with him. And when he told me that, it meant a lot.”Banerjee had flown with Shukla only seven or eight times, but the connection endured. “He always stayed in touch. Not many do. Whenever he reached a big moment in life, he’d send a message. That says a lot about the man he’s become.”Before launch, the two had one last conversation. “I knew he was about to enter quarantine, so I wished him luck. I told him life had already prepared him for what was coming. And that, a part of me was going to space with him.”Watching Shukla dock with the ISS, Banerjee says he felt something beyond pride. “It’s still unbelievable to me — that someone I trained, someone who first flew with me, is now in space. It’s not just about reaching orbit. It’s about who he is as a person. That matters even more.”In a way, Shukla’s story is a flight path traced not just in the sky, but in character. “When your students do well, you feel proud. But when they turn out to be fine human beings too — that’s greater joy.”So yes, Shux may now be astronaut number 634. But long before he floated weightlessly in a pressurised module, he was already soaring — on skill, sincerity, and the sort of quiet steel that can’t be taught.","Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla became the first Indian to board the International Space Station (ISS) He was already turning heads in the cockpit of a Super Dimona aircraft at the National Defence Academy (NDA) His instructor, Anupam Banerjee, says he was confident, intuitive and a very natural flier.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122119024,imgsize-416194,width-400,resizemode-4/122119024.jpg"

WWE Tag Team Championship

WWE Women’s Championship



The night before the Night of Champions sees a star-studded Kingdom arena in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. From WWE Women’s Champion Tiffany Stratton, to the woman she will face tonight, Nia Jax, to WWE Tag Team Champions Montez Ford and Angelo Dawkins and Women’s U.S. Champion Zelina Vega, Giulia, Jade Cargill, and Asuka, Riyadh is a myriad of wrestling superstars.The June 27th edition of WWE SmackDown is a preview to the big night, where the King and Queen of the Ring for 2025 will be decided. But not to fret, the night in itself has some pretty high profile matches to go through, and John Cena is also set to be featured alongside CM Punk, Cody Rhodes, Randy Orton, and LA KnightCody Rhodes makes his entrance after being introduced by ring announcer Mark Nash to the crowd cheering for him. He was about to speak when he got interrupted by entrance music. Randy Orton walked to the ring, and the crowd continued to sing his theme song even after it stopped playing. The segment then got cut short for international viewers because of a feed issue with Netflix. The streaming company posted a graphic apologizing for the interruption, and then a “we’ll be right back” graphic appeared.The Bloodline members or whatever is left of it, are still fighting against each other.And this time it was a match between JC Mateo and Jimmy Uso with an appearance from Solo Sikoa. Mateo looked to be the dominant one from the beginning, even though Jimmy Uso tried his best to overcome his opponent. At the end, Uso went up top and then jumped over and rolled, but Mateo was ready for him and defeated Uso by pinfall in about 6 minutes into the match.In an after match segment, Solo Sikoa, who tried to distract Jimmy Uso during the match, helped him up and asked him if he was ready to come back. In return, he got slapped by his cousin while fans booed. Jacob Fatu made an entrance to the crowd cheering for him, and dropped a Samoan Drop on Mateo after running into the ring, and then a double jump moonsault. Uso then pushed Fatu out of the way and superkicked Sikoa out of the ring, bringing an end to the segment.In a backstage segment, #DIY and other tag teams are seen talking about The Wyatt Sicks when SmackDown General Manager Nick Aldis comes in. Listening to their chatter, Aldis calls in Andrade and asks him to find a partner to face a now furious #DIYBoth Giulia and Zelina Vega looked to be equally matched as the fight started. When Giulia hit a double underhook superplex, Vega retaliated with a Code Red. The match seemed like it could be in anyone's favor, before Giulia kneed her opponent in the face before hitting Vega with a Northern Lights Bomb, defeating her in roughly 7:30 minutes to win the Women’s U.S. Championship by pinfall.In another backstage segment, Charlotte Flair and Alexa Bliss are seen exchanging a few words before the latter walks off. Could this be the beginning of an unlikely partnership?Then Aksuka and Jade Cargill make their way into the ring before tomorrow night, where they will face off against each other for the Queen of the Ring title. They exchange a few words before Money in the Bank winner Naomi cuts them off with her entrance. There is a strong chance she will cash in her MITB win during the Night of Champions event the next night.In yet another backstage segment, Aleister Black walks in on Raw General Manager Adam Pearce and SmackDown General Manager Nick Aldis discussing the WWE Women’s Tag Team Championship. But it all turns into chaos when R-Truth bursts in demanding to get a face-off against John Cena. Aldis tells him that John Cena is in Riyadh to fight CM Punk, but R-Truth says he is here for Cena before walks off. All this while, Black is there watching everything happen. At the end he walks off. Is another storyline brewing backstage?Andrade bringing in Rey Fenix was a surprise for many, and the crowd are seen cheering for what is to come. The two tag teams go up against each other one after the other. At one time Fenix is seen running to the top rope and kicking Tommaso Ciampa in the face, while in the next moment fans can see #DIY hitting Andrade with the Shatter Machine for a near fall. At the end Andrade and Rey Fenix defeated “DIY” Johnny Gargano and Tommaso Ciampa by pinfall in about 15 minutes into the match.After the earlier backstage segment, R-Truth gets in the ring to a deafening crowd response. He is in his vibe, and calls out John Cena. But suddenly, Aleister Black comes from behind and hits him with Black Mass and a cryptic message, before walking off. The audience is left bewildered.The Street Profits sees Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford going against The Wyatt Sicks members, Joe Gacy and Dexter Lumis. To make things interesting, Erik Rowan, Nikki Cross, and Uncle Howdy also make their appearance, as things go awry minutes into the match. Los Garza, The Motor City Machine Guns, and Fraxiom are all seen coming to ringside, and even the recent losers #DIY are there. A brawl breaks out, leading to the match being thrown out.The Last Woman Standing Match seesNia Jax going against the current title holder, Tiffany Stratton. Before the bell can even ring, Nia Jax throws Tiffany Stratton into the ring post. Jax's physically imposing nature comes in handy against a lithe opponent like Stratton, but the latter manages to keep herself in the match over and over. Suddenly, Naomi runs into the ring with her Money in the Bank briefcase. But while she is talking to the referee, Stratton hits her before sending Jax on top of her. In the end, Stratton picked up the MITB briefcase and knocked Jax off before taking the win for herself with a pinfall after 17 minutes in the ring.The final segment of the night saw WWE Champion John Cena making his entrance with his title belt held high. He said, ""This is what a winner looks like,” and called CM Punk a loser. CM Punk then made his entry wearing a Chicago Cubs jersey, a chain with a padlock on it, a Chicago Bulls hat on backwards, and jorts, mocking Cena's usual attire.Punk also put on big rings resembling Cena, before saying, “Yo, check it, this is basic Punkanomics. Don’t adjust your television set, your eyes are just right. This clown plagiarized my pipe bomb, so now I’m stealing WordLife.” John Cena looked completely shocked at the tune of events as Punk continued rapping and rhyming. The Best in the World then dropped the mic and did the infamous “you can’t see me” hand gesture in Cena’s face, bringing an end to the show.PS. From next week onwards, SmackDown will be back to its two-hour long format.Also Read: WWE Night of Champions 2025 preview and streaming details (06/28/25): Full match card, show highlights, how to watch, and more","The June 27th edition of WWE SmackDown is a preview to the big night, where the King and Queen of the Ring for 2025 will be decided.

Chandi Dayle's Bahamas incident sparked internal fallout within Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders



What Happened to Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader Chandi? Bahamas Scandal Explained | E! News

Who is Chandi Dayle?



Chandi Dayle's retirement brings an end to an era



Veteran Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader member Chandi Dayle was caught in the middle of a scandal during Season 2 of America's Sweethearts: Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders on Netflix. The experienced performer and former team leader was under fire after a serious rules infraction during the team's visit to the Bahamas, ultimately resigning from leadership and eventually retiring.The Netflix docuseries’ second season, released on June 18, chronicled the cheerleaders' high-pressure training camp and performances, culminating in an off-field incident involving Chandi Dayle that fractured team dynamics.At the Bahamas retreat, Chandi Dayle—a sixth-year veteran at the time and the 2024–25 team's longest-serving member—allegedly brought an unauthorized person into the private hotel space of the team, an explicit violation of Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders (DCC) policy. The man was not disclosed to teammates, raising genuine safety and trust concerns.Chandi Dayle said the encounter was rooted in emotional distress. She talked to the man about personal issues and averred their encounter was just conversational. ""It was probably the wrong place and time to do that, but selfishly, I had to do it for me because I feel like I was just losing it,"" she admitted.Later in the season, Chandi Dayle went on a leave of absence.Team head choreographer Judy Trammell said that Dayle needed to attend to her mental health, and rehearsals went on without her. Fourth-year cheerleader KayDianna Garza filled the gap as a leader for a time, although she would later complain she felt unsupported.Garza eventually left the team after a scandal broke out from a TikTok Live, where she made comments about the scandal. She was suspended after footage from the livestream spread on Reddit, which led to an internal investigation. ""I needed to respect myself,"" Garza said regarding her departure.Before the controversy, Chandi Dayle was among the most recognizable faces of the DCC, with leadership qualities, charisma, and a long time staying on the team. In the Netflix series, glimpses of her private life were seen, some of them rooted in trauma in a previous relationship. In Season 2, Dayle talked about her ex-boyfriend Ryan, whom she had become involved with in the time of the pandemic. His complicated history with an allegedly abusive previous boyfriend became part of the emotional context that added to the mental strain on her during the season.Dayle went on to say, ""If I can't even organize my life and my own thoughts, I'm not gonna be able to organize a whole team."" When she came back to the squad after her leave, she chose not to return to her leadership role and described herself as relieved at the lessened pressure.Also read: “We at War?”: Cowboys linebacker Demarvion Overshown leaves fans guessing with vague social media post By season’s end, Chandi Dayle confirmed she would not return for another season with the DCC.

Stepping into her next phase, Dayle departs with a multifaceted legacy—one formed by excellence as well as by vulnerability.",Chandi Dayle was caught in the middle of a scandal during Season 2 of America's Sweethearts: Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders on Netflix.

Jets still hoping to make their case for long-term loyalty

As NHL free agency approaches, Winnipeg Jets winger Nikolaj Ehlers is quickly becoming one of the most sought-after names on the market. After 10 seasons in Manitoba, the Danish forward has reportedly told the Jets he intends to test free agency on July 1—news that has sparked interest from multiple franchises across the league.NHL trade rumors are swirling as Winnipeg Jets forward Nikolaj Ehlers prepares to hit free agency, drawing serious interest from contenders like the Hurricanes, Kings, and Sharks ahead of July 1.“Hearing Nikolaj Ehlers has informed the Jets he will go to free agency on July 1. Door not closed on Manitoba, but will test the market,” tweeted NHL insider Elliotte Friedman on Thursday.While the Winnipeg Jets are still hoping to retain the skilled winger, it’s clear other teams are preparing aggressive pitches. Among them, the Carolina Hurricanes—valued at $1.25 billion by Forbes—are reportedly “very serious” about signing Ehlers, according to Friedman, who spoke during Oilers Now with Bob Stauffer.“I think there are definitely some things in motion,” Friedman said. “I’ve heard Carolina is very serious about Ehlers, but I also think he could end up just about anywhere. That’s what’s going to make this a really interesting situation — there are a lot of teams poking around, and they all seem to have slightly different priorities.”Beyond Carolina, both the Los Angeles Kings and San Jose Sharks have emerged as potential suitors. The Kings are exploring multiple roster moves, while the Sharks, facing pressure to reach the salary cap floor, could view Ehlers as a strategic addition despite their ongoing rebuild.“Some teams are looking at shorter-term fits,” Friedman noted. “Then you’ve got teams like San Jose who need to hit the cap floor. So, Ehlers could have multiple types of suitors. ... I’ve also heard L.A. has a few irons in the fire.”Despite Ehlers' intention to explore options, Winnipeg GM Kevin Cheveldayoff hasn’t given up hope. He emphasized the team’s long-standing relationship with Ehlers, who was drafted by the Jets and has been a consistent top-six forward.“Nikolaj has been a player that has grown up in our organization,” Cheveldayoff said. “Drafted, developed him, we'll put our best foot forward with him to try to make our case to be a unique Jet-for-life-type player.”Also Read: NHL CBA overhaul: Auston Matthews sparks dress code rebellion as league expands to 84-game season With 63 points in 69 games last season, Ehlers’ mix of speed, offensive production, and two-way play makes him one of the most versatile forwards available this summer—guaranteeing a competitive bidding war once the free agent window opens.","Winnipeg Jets winger Nikolaj Ehlers is set to test free agency on July 1.

NEW DELHI: Teen prodigy Vaibhav Suryavanshi made a dazzling first impression on English soil with a stunning 19-ball 48 in the first Youth ODI between India U19 and England U19 at the County Ground in Hove on Friday.The 14-year-old opener announced himself with a fearless display of strokeplay, smashing five sixes and three fours to set the tone for India's successful run chase.Chasing 175, Suryavanshi partnered with captain Ayush Mhatre to give India U19 a lightning start, adding 71 runs in just 7.3 overs. His blistering innings ended two short of a deserving half-century when he was caught by Tazeem Chaudry Ali off Ralphie Albert in the eighth over. Mhatre followed soon after, dismissed for 21 off 30 balls.The total, however, was not threatening for the team as India U19 registered a commanding six-wicket victory with 156 balls to spare. Wicketkeeper-batter Abhigyan Kundu, 45 not out off 34 balls, hit the winning six in the 24th over.Earlier in the day, England U19 chose to bat first but were bowled out for 174 in 42.2 overs. Rocky Flintoff, son of former England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff , top-scored for the hosts with a composed 56 off 90 balls, laced with three sixes and as many boundaries.India's bowlers dominated proceedings, with Kanishk Chouhan leading the charge with figures of 3 for 20 in his full quota of 10 overs. Mohamed Enaan (2/37), RS Ambrish (2/24), and Henil Patel (2/41) chipped in with two wickets apiece to dismantle the England batting order.Speaking ahead of the tour, Suryavanshi had told iplt20.com, “I will get a good experience of playing in England. We will try to win a trophy from there as well.”If his debut is anything to go by, Indian cricket may have unearthed yet another star for the future.","India U19 beat England U19 by six wickets in first Youth ODI in Hove.

Kyrie Irving fires up after Paige Bueckers hits buzzer-beater three for Wings against Clark-less Fever,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/kyrie-irving-fires-up-after-paige-bueckers-hits-buzzer-beater-three-for-wings-against-clark-less-fever/articleshow/122123166.cms,"(Image Source - Getty Images)

Paige Bueckers hit a wild logo three at the buzzer and the crowd lost it

Paige Bueckers lit up the first half with a logo-range dagger that had fans on their feet and Kyrie Irving jumping out of his seat. It wasn’t just a buzzer-beater, it was a statement. As the Fever struggled without Caitlin Clark, Bueckers grabbed her moment, bringing energy, belief, and a little NBA magic to the floor. Her 12th point of the half might just be her most unforgettable.The vibe was electric at the American Airlines Center on June 27, 2025. During a close contest, Dallas Wings rookie Paige Bueckers pulled off a daring logo shot to finish the first half—her 12th point of the half—doing it in true Caitlin Clark style, even with Clark out due to a groin injury. The crowd erupted, and as the referee's whistles still echoed, Bueckers sprinted to the sideline. Right there, Kyrie Irving—Bueckers’s self-proclaimed favorite NBA star—jumped up and gave her a quick dap, sealing the moment and merging WNBA talent with NBA stardom.At the end of the half, Indiana was still in the lead by 13, but the momentum had noticeably changed. The Fever, who were missing their superstar Caitlin Clark averaging 18.2 points, 8.9 assists, and 5.6 rebounds, but going through a rough patch with a 1-for-23 shooting slump from three-point range on the road, were feeling the pressure.Bueckers’s signature shot not only reduced the lead but also energized the Wings and their star-studded audience.Bueckers has always talked about her dream of having a big-game moment with Irving—ever since she got to Dallas on Media Day, where she referred to him as her favorite player ""forever"". Now that dream has become a reality, proving her journey from an ACL comeback in college to thriving as a WNBA rookie in the same city as the nine-time NBA All-Star.Their shared background goes further: both dealt with ACL injuries (Irving’s in March 2025, Bueckers’s in 2022) and bounced back stronger, creating a natural connection. When Irving was courtside on Thursday, the combination of chants, whistles, and Bueckers’s shot resulted in one of the standout rookie moments of the young WNBA season.Even with her amazing performances, Bueckers’s team started this season at the bottom of the standings with a record of 4–12. Still, her personal stats—17.7 points, 5.8 assists, and 4.6 rebounds per game—are similar to Clark’s impressive numbers. She’s gaining national recognition, not only for her skills on the court but also for advocating for her fellow players—publicly supporting Caitlin Clark and challenging the “inhumane” pressure put on young talents.Also Read: LeBron James celebrates his electric boat team’s strong finish in Italy but the real test is still ahead As the Wings strive to narrow the distance, Bueckers keeps evolving amidst both attention and challenges.

Instagram war explodes as Jordon Hudson exposes Linda Holliday’s 'delusional' letter to Bill Belichick



Things are heating up off the football field for former New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick, but this time, the drama isn’t about playbooks—it’s about a fiery love triangle making waves on social media. His current girlfriend, 24-year-old pageant contestant Jordon Hudson, has allegedly taken direct aim at his longtime ex-partner Linda Holliday in a now-viral Instagram exchange.According to the Daily Mail, Hudson was engaged in a heated back-and-forth with someone she believed to be close to Holliday. The argument ignited when the woman allegedly branded Hudson a “gold digger” and accused her of taking advantage of the 73-year-old NFL legend. Hudson, however, did not hold back in her response and delivered a blistering message that included references to a letter Holliday wrote to Belichick nearly a decade ago.“Hey babes! Since you are tight with Ms Holliday, would you please ask her what she would like me to do with this letter I found from 2015?” Hudson reportedly wrote in a message shared via screenshot. She added, “Due to its pathetic and embarrassing content, I imagine she wants it back.She should make the point to burn it so she continue [sic] to live in delusional denial.”The letter in question was supposedly found by Hudson at Belichick’s $2.2 million Hingham home in an old invoice file. In it, Holliday had allegedly poured out her frustrations over being excluded from aspects of Belichick’s life and his ongoing loyalty to ex-wife Debbie Clarke. Holliday had written, “I’m the one that loves and adores you... tries to ALWAYS remind you how grateful I am of your love,” expressing feelings of being sidelined in favor of Clarke, despite her love and commitment to the coach.Belichick and Holliday were together for 16 years before parting ways in 2023. Shortly after, Belichick's romance with Hudson became public. The couple reportedly first met on a flight in 2021 and have since been spotted attending high-profile events, including the NFL Honors.But Hudson's entry into Belichick's world has been far from seamless. Page Six reports that she has been “iced out” by Nantucket’s elite social scene—where Holliday remains a central figure. Her growing influence in Belichick’s post-Patriots chapter has raised eyebrows too, especially after she was seen on the field at UNC, where Belichick has taken a new role. Some reports suggest she’s even being looped into work emails and possibly pitching involvement in media projects like Hard Knocks.Despite the noise, Belichick has publicly defended Hudson, stating she leads his “professional opportunities” outside UNC. Whether this storm settles or intensifies remains to be seen—but one thing is clear: this isn’t your typical offseason drama.Also Read: How Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen built their marriage on trust and acceptance of each other’s pasts?","Bill Belichick's current girlfriend, 24-year-old pageant contestant Jordon Hudson, has allegedly taken direct aim at his longtime ex-partner Linda Holliday in a now-viral Instagram exchange.

Steelers embrace Aaron Rodgers , but NFL legends push back on his greatness

Skip Bayless and Terry Bradshaw pile on Aaron Rodgers’ reputation



Aaron Rodgers is heading into his final NFL season, now wearing a Pittsburgh Steelers jersey, but the four-time MVP’s swan song is already facing scrutiny. At 41, the future Hall of Famer has made it clear this will be his last ride, but instead of a universal send-off, his legacy is under fire—especially from legends and analysts who aren’t sold on his leadership credentials.The Steelers have rolled out the red carpet for Aaron Rodgers. Head coach Mike Tomlin praised the veteran quarterback, saying, “I mean, read his resume. We're excited about him being here.” Tight end Pat Freiermuth also drew comparisons between Rodgers and Pittsburgh icon Ben Roethlisberger, adding, “I think he's similar to Ben in a way, where you know he sees the game in a certain way.”However, not all football voices are as supportive. Hall of Famer Cris Carter took a public shot at Rodgers on the Fully Loaded podcast, questioning his football intelligence and influence in team meetings compared to other greats. “People don't feel that same way about Aaron Rodgers because his knowledge of the game is not the same as these guys,” Carter said, referring to Peyton Manning and Tom Brady. “He sounds like a spoiled child. ”Carter argued that Rodgers lacks the elite mental grasp of the game that defined Brady’s and Manning’s success.He claimed Rodgers didn’t command the same respect in the Jets’ locker room, saying, “They would have been like, ‘Guess what we're getting ready to do? What that guy right there said.’ Manning conducted meetings in Denver. Brady did the same in Tampa Bay.”Rodgers’ image as a ""diva"" resurfaced once again when Skip Bayless blasted the Steelers for signing him. Even more brutally, Steelers legend Terry Bradshaw said Rodgers was a bad fit for the franchise and took a swipe at his off-field persona: “That guy needs to stay in California, go somewhere and chew on bark and whisper to the gods out there.”Despite the noise, Rodgers remains focused. “I mean, I played 20 freaking years, you know? It’s been a long run and I’ve enjoyed it,” he told The Pat McAfee Show. “What better place to finish than in one of the cornerstone franchises of the NFL?”Also Read: Patrick Mahomes reignites Kansas City’s Super Bowl fire as Chiefs chase NFL immortality in 2025 As Rodgers looks to cement his legacy with one last Super Bowl run, the criticism he faces may either break the myth—or prove once and for all that greatness just wears differently on him.","Aaron Rodgers is heading into his final NFL season, now wearing a Pittsburgh Steelers jersey.

Poll Do you think Rohit Sharma made the right decision to retire from red-ball cricket at 38? Yes, it's time to focus on ODIs No, he should have continued playing Tests

Gambhir & Agarkar Plot at the Birmingham Nets | Key Talks Ahead of 2nd Test vs England

NEW DELHI: Former India Test captain and current ODI skipper Rohit Sharma , who recently retired from red-ball cricket at the age of 38, was seen vacationing in Milan even as Team India battles England in the ongoing Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy five-Test series. His successor, Shubman Gill , came under fire following India’s five-wicket defeat in the series opener at Headingley — his first match as Test captain.Rohit, now focused solely on One-Day Internationals, shared glimpses of his holiday in Italy on social media, including a photo of the iconic Duomo di Milano cathedral. His next cricketing assignment is scheduled for August, when India tours Bangladesh for a three-match ODI series starting on August 17.Meanwhile, India endured a frustrating loss at Headingley, where England chased down a steep target of 371 runs in the fourth innings — their second-highest successful chase in Tests and the highest ever against India.Former England captain Nasser Hussain, speaking on Sky Sports, was critical of Gill's captaincy debut.""I saw someone finding his way. He didn't quite have that on-field aura of Rohit and Kohli. I thought he followed the ball a lot and was reactive rather than proactive.When Rohit and Kohli captained, you looked down and immediately knew who was in charge. In this game, I saw two or three captains — captaincy by committee,"" Hussain said.England’s victory was anchored by Ben Duckett’s explosive 149, aided by Joe Root’s unbeaten 53 and debutant Jamie Smith’s steady 44 not out.Despite India boasting five individual centuries across both innings — with Shubman Gill, KL Rahul, Yashasvi Jaiswal, and Rishabh Pant all reaching triple figures — the team failed to convert that dominance into a win.While highlighting Gill's leadership struggles, Hussain also noted that the young captain wasn’t solely to blame for the loss.""India lost the match because of two things Gill couldn't control — dropped catches and batting collapses,"" he said, referencing India's sloppy fielding and key middle-order failures.India had England at vulnerable positions — 276/5 in the first innings and 333/4 in the second — but failed to capitalise. Crucial batting collapses saw India lose 7 wickets for 41 runs in their first innings and 6 for 31 in the second, ultimately swinging the match in England’s favour.","Former India Test captain Rohit Sharma is vacationing in Milan.

WWE Raw 28/2/2011 The Rock Dwayne Johnson Rapping *HD*

CM Punk's infamous Pipebomb moment from 2011 was turned into a parody by John Cena on WWE SmackDown last week. The Best in the World retaliated in a similar fashion by donning Cena's popular 'Doctor of Thuganomics' and launching major verbal rap shots at The Cenation Leader. This came one night before they clashed for the final time with the Undisputed WWE Championship on the line at Night of Champions.Punk recreating an important part of Cena's WWE career as a mockery was a sight to witness. However, he was not the first one to do so. Over the years, top names in the business, who had heated feuds with the 17-time WWE Champion, mocked him in a similar way that The Second City Saint did on SmackDown. Here is a look back at those three times WWE superstars delivered savage John Cena parodies:John Cena's first major rivalry in WWE during the start of his rise as 'The Doctor of Thuganomics' was against then-WWE United States Champion, The Big Show. In the buildup to their match for the star-spangled prize at WrestleMania XX, the duo met on SmackDown in a rap battle where Show took aspects from Cena's rapper gimmick and went toe-to-toe with him. Cena won the battle and even defeated him at WrestleMania to win his first title in WWE.The first WWE superstar whom John Cena faced in the company was Kurt Angle in 2002. Sometime later, when Cena found his Doctor of Thuganomics persona, he found himself crossing paths with The Olympic Hero again.At one time during an in-ring confrontation, Angle decided to shut down the young rising star in his language by delivering a charismatic rap that left Cena speechless. It showed Angle's hilarious side who rapped to perfection and reminded Cena that he was the top player of the big leagues.John Cena began a rivalry with The Rock following his return to WWE in 2011. The Champ rapped to The Great One after he berated Cena in his return promo. In response, The Rock appeared via satellite wearing Cena's cap, armbands, and rapping in a similar fashion. He did a few lines, but immediately took off all of Cena's artifacts to deliver a scratching rant in his own style, which became a memorable segment in WWE.Also read: History in the Making: Legendary star can set new WWE SummerSlam milestone

Social media spotlight turns into scrutiny

Marital rumors and viral TikTok moments

Politics, PR optics, and the rumored Taylor Swift tension

Brittany Mahomes may be known as Patrick Mahomes' high-profile wife, but she’s built a presence—and controversy—of her own. From Instagram buzz to alleged feuds and political tension, Brittany has faced a relentless cycle of rumors that continue to put her under the microscope.Brittany Mahomes, a former soccer player and now a fitness entrepreneur, commands over 2 million followers online. With a net worth reportedly around $15 million, she’s transformed her visibility into a powerful brand. But with fame has come a wave of public speculation about her appearance.After fans accused her of undergoing plastic surgery, Brittany addressed the gossip head-on. “Filler in my lips,” she admitted during a 2023 Q&A on Instagram. As for breast augmentation, she joked under a bikini photo, “Haters will say they are fake, but breastfeeding moms will understand.” Her bold honesty has earned her both admiration and criticism.Despite her picture-perfect image with Patrick Mahomes, whispers of tension have emerged. A viral clip from a Texas Tech basketball game in June 2025 showed Brittany mocking Patrick’s “resting b***h face” comment. It echoed a similar moment from 2022, leading some fans to speculate that not all is well in the Mahomes household.In an April 2023 Q&A, Brittany revealed she doesn’t take flirtations toward Patrick lightly. “It's actually really sad how disrespectful some women are,” she said, acknowledging the emotional toll of life in the public eye.One of the most talked-about topics remains her rumored friction with Taylor Swift, reportedly stemming from political differences. Brittany’s support for Donald Trump—highlighted in a September 2024 Truth Social post—seemingly clashed with Swift’s endorsement of Kamala Harris. At Super Bowl LIX, they notably didn’t sit together, with one Daily Mail source citing “PR reasons” due to Trump’s presence.Though neither party has publicly addressed a falling out, the once-hyped idea of a Brittany-Taylor BFF dynamic now feels far-fetched.Amid divorce rumors, family tension with Jackson Mahomes, and endless online speculation, Brittany continues to push forward with grit. As she once said on the WHOOP podcast, Patrick told her, “Stop caring about what people think, especially the people that don't even know you.”Also Read: Chiefs' Trey Smith exposes Travis Kelce’s behaviour, calls him crazy and psycho Whether she's clapping back at rumors or balancing motherhood and business, Brittany Mahomes is clearly unbothered by the chaos—and she’s not slowing down.",Brittany Mahomes is the wife of Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes.

Toronto Maple Leafs hold on to John Tavares with a leadership contract renovation

The deepest thoughts of John Tavares for his tenure with the Toronto Maple Leafs were put down as the signing of a four-year contract extension that betrayed his heart for the franchise. Emerging from free agency, Tavares made the choice to stay with his alma mater, for whom he had led for many years. The attempt of the Leafs to create a nucleus of veteran leadership and consequently stay at the top of the Eastern Conference comes at a very critical moment for the player and team. Tavares's decision to make such a decision spoke of something that transcended money with Toronto.Making a wise decision in the trade market, the Maple Leafs decided to lock up veteran John Tavares with a new four-year deal that now has him with the franchise through 2028–29. The $18 million extension reduces his annual cap hit to $4.38 million because of a deferred component to his salary, which will not be allowed anymore once the new league rules take effect from the 2026–27 season onward. For the first two years, Tavares enjoys full no-movement rights before it reverts to a five-team limited trade clause.Even in his mid-30s, Tavares is still performing at an elite level. He managed to set 74 points last season, with 38 goals in 75 regular-season games.He also managed to score five goals through 13 playoff games before Florida dashed Toronto’s hopes in the second round. He could have taken a shorter, perhaps more lucrative contract elsewhere, but Tavares remained loyal to Toronto. He would rather look at stability and continuing than starting fresh elsewhere.Ever since his debut in the NHL in 2009, with the New York Islanders selecting him first overall, Tavares has evolved into one of the most reliable offensive players in the league. His career stats depict his longevity and consistency: 1,114 points in 1,184 games. The memorable first season in Toronto saw him score 47 goals, while his best 2014-15 season with the Islanders cemented his status as an elite scorer.Tavares' resume also features international glory. A native of Mississauga, Ontario, he has represented Canada in numerous major tournaments. Most prominently, he won gold at the 2014 Winter Olympics and was an integral part of the 2016 World Cup of Hockey-winning team. With these triumphs behind him, the added leadership presence from the Maple Leafs' locker room will undoubtedly be a great value as they continue to chase the championship.Also Read: John Tavares' uncertain future with Maple Leafs as free agency looms and changes mount John Tavares' decision to stay with the Toronto Maple Leafs further underlines his position as a cornerstone of the franchise. As the team continues to strive for playoff success, Tavares' leadership and scoring depth remain critical.

Could Trevor Lawrence be Pittsburgh’s next franchise QB?



Aaron Rodgers Praises Steelers Leadership & Talent, Gives Life Updates On The Pat McAfee Show

Trevor Lawrence’s role as Jaguars’ long-term QB could be on the line



With Aaron Rodgers likely headed into retirement after the 2025 NFL season, the Pittsburgh Steelers are reportedly keeping tabs on a potential blockbuster replacement—$275 million quarterback Trevor Lawrence. While Lawrence remains under contract with the Jaguars, growing doubts about his long-term fit in Jacksonville could open the door for a stunning trade in 2026 and the Steelers might just be ready to pounce.Aaron Rodgers signed a short-term deal with the Steelers, offering a temporary solution at quarterback. But with his career winding down, Pittsburgh must think long-term and ESPN’s Brooke Pryor has floated a name no one expected: Trevor Lawrence.""Trading for a starting quarterback is rarer these days, and expensive, but not impossible. Trevor Lawrence could be worth an inquiry,"" Pryor noted.The Jaguars made a massive investment in Lawrence, handing him a five-year, $275 million extension, banking on his development into an elite, top-tier passer. Yet after four up-and-down seasons with only one playoff appearance in 2023—questions remain about whether the former No.1 pick is truly their long-term answer.Lawrence enters the 2025 NFL season facing immense pressure to deliver. While he's showcased moments of brilliance, inconsistency has plagued his career. He’s yet to complete a full 17-game season at a high level, and the Jaguars' offense has failed to take the leap expected with him under center.If the struggles continue, Jacksonville could consider resetting and recovering value via a blockbuster trade. And few franchises are as desperate for a long-term quarterback as the Steelers.Since Ben Roethlisberger’s 2022 retirement, the Steelers have shuffled through short-term options without finding their true successor. Will Howard might get a shot, but he remains unproven. A player of Lawrence’s caliber could finally stabilize the franchise under head coach Mike Tomlin.Pairing Lawrence with Pittsburgh’s physical style of play and possibly D.K. Metcalf as his No. 1 target, could be the move that redefines both his career and the Steelers’ future.Also Read: Miami’s decision to draft Noah Igbinoghene over future All-Pro Jonathan Taylor still sparks backlash years later Until then, Steelers fans should keep a close eye on the Jaguars and their $275 million man.","Trevor Lawrence's role as Jaguars’ long-term QB could be on the line in 2026.

From injury to 8-year deal: Trent Frederic secures future with Edmonton Oilers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/from-injury-to-8-year-deal-trent-frederic-secures-future-with-edmonton-oilers/articleshow/122117321.cms,"From injury to 8-year deal: Trent Frederic secures future with Edmonton Oilers (Image Via Twitter)

The eight-year deal of Trent Frederic solidifies the Oilers' trust in their long-term depth strategy

The Oilers, by almost entering into an eight-year contract extension with forward Trent Frederic, are making a sizable commitment. Brought in during the trade deadline through a complicated three-way deal, Frederic's value to the Oilers stretches far outside of regular-season statistics. He came into the team injured and had some regular-season time prior to the playoffs, and since his presence had become steady in their postseason run, this move declared Edmonton's long-term commitment to those role players who bring grit, depth, and consistency to the team as opposed to relying solely on star power.The Edmonton Oilers rushed to finalize an eight-year extension for Trent Frederic for an average annual value of just under $4 million. While not a big scorer with the puck, he is positioned more as a road-weary physical forward, which fits Edmonton's vision of creating a well-balanced team for the postseason.Frederic came over to Edmonton from Boston at the 2024-25 trade deadline in a complicated three-team trade where the New Jersey Devils retained 50% of his salary. The Oilers sent out a 2025 second-rounder, a 2026 fourth-rounder, defenseman Max Wanner, and forward Shane LaChance (who went to New Jersey).It was a savvy move to add some depth to the roster without crippling themselves on the salary side.Frederic got injured in the ankle when he arrived, playing just one regular-season game. However, he returned in the playoffs in time to play in all 22 postseason games. His stats-one goal, three assists-were not very flashy, but he brought a gritty presence and defensive responsibility that sometimes cannot be measured on the scoreboard.Now 26 years old, Frederic is in his prime. Locking him in for long-term development shows the Oilers' faith in his refinement. A short-term deal costing just below $4 million for a reliable, hard-nosed winger who has playoff experience is a very calculated risk for not only team depth but also chemistry and consistency.In today's NHL, guys like Frederic, who are cheap and consistent, can be the difference-makers in deep playoff runs. Edmonton feels he is one of those guys.Also Read: Lauren Kyle helped with developing the special connection between Leon Draisaitl and Connor McDavid on the ice The newest contract extension for Trent Frederic is more than simply a signing-it symbolizes the Oilers' outlook on a larger scale.

Matthew Schaefer's Unbelievable Story Of Adversity And Perseverance

Back-to-back tragedies tested Schaefer’s strength off the ice

Matthew Schaefer is expected to be the first overall pick in the 2025 NHL Draft. But for the 17-year-old defenseman, draft night will be bittersweet. In just one year, Schaefer has lost his mother, billet mother, and a team owner-mentor—three key figures who shaped his journey. Here’s a look at the heartbreak behind hockey’s brightest young prospect.The NHL Draft is meant to be a celebration—a young player’s first step toward professional greatness. For Canadian defenseman Matthew Schaefer, projected to go No. 1 overall in the 2025 NHL Draft, the moment comes with deep emotional weight.In February 2024, Schaefer lost his mother, Jennifer, to breast cancer after a two-year battle. Despite her illness, she remained a constant source of strength and inspiration. Schaefer often reflects on her positivity, saying, “Just seeing what my mom went through, having a smile on her face with cancer and everything trying to bring her down, but she wouldn't let it bring her down. She's someone I look up to, really strong. ”Jennifer played a huge role in Schaefer’s development, even acting as a goalie in the basement so her sons could practice. Schaefer remembers those moments fondly: “When I’m shooting pucks in the basement, she’s probably spiritually having the hockey equipment on, trying to save them.I’m missing the net because she’s probably blocker saving that.”He carries her presence with him every time he steps on the ice. “I know she has a front-row seat every game,” he said.Only three months before his mother passed, Schaefer lost his billet mom, Emily Matson, in a tragic accident. Matson, a local journalist in Erie, Pennsylvania, was killed by a train in what was ruled a suicide in December 2023. She had welcomed Schaefer into her family and home, offering him comfort and stability while he pursued his hockey dreams away from home.Schaefer has also had to cope with the death of Erie Otters owner Jim Waters, who passed away from a heart attack in December 2024. Waters had bought the Otters in 2015 and quickly became a guiding force in Schaefer’s hockey journey. “Jim and his wife, Sheila, were two big parts of my life,” Schaefer shared.Despite these unimaginable personal losses, Schaefer remains mentally strong. A collarbone injury kept him out of the final three months of his season, but he shrugged it off in the context of his grief. “I’ve been through a lot in my life and I’d rather an injury than losing someone I love. There are a lot worse things than injuries.”Also Read: How to watch 2025 NHL Draft: Date, Time, Live stream, and Top picks to watch Now, as he prepares to hear his name called on draft night, Schaefer carries more than just a hockey legacy, he carries the memories and strength of the people who helped him reach this point.","Matthew Schaefer is expected to be the first overall pick in the 2025 NHL Draft.

Stephen Curry just dropped an Instagram Story that’s got the NBA world buzzing—and it’s more than just a throwback. The post, featuring a young Cooper Flagg, comes at a time when the spotlight couldn’t be brighter on the No. 1 draft pick. With a simple caption, Curry may have said more than words ever could — hinting at a future that’s already generating serious hype.Stephen Curry’s repost isn’t just a blast from the past—it’s a solid endorsement. The picture features Flagg as a wide-eyed kid at a Curry Camp, now set to be the number one pick in the 2025 NBA Draft by the Dallas Mavericks. With that caption—""Curry Camp → NBA. Let’s get it!""—Curry is shining a light on Flagg’s journey and effectively backing him as a high-level talent ready for the big stage. It’s a full-circle moment that raises the rookie’s profile.During his single season at Duke, Flagg was nothing less than amazing. He put up averages of 19.2 points, 7.5 rebounds, and 4.2 assists per game, while also contributing 1.4 blocks and 1.4 steals. His remarkable play earned him the consensus national player of the year award, which helped him secure the No. 1 overall pick by a Mavericks team eager to focus on youth and potential for the future.This February, Dallas stirred things up by sending Luka Doncic to the Lakers, officially making space for Flagg to take the spotlight. Despite the challenge of following in the footsteps of a franchise great, Flagg has openly rejected the comparisons — “I’m not worried about living up to certain players’ expectations,” he said confidently ahead of draft night, reinforcing that he plans to carve his own pathCurry’s backing is significant. He began as an overlooked prospect and transformed into a global superstar, mirroring the path the Mavericks envision for Flagg. By emphasizing Flagg’s early links to Curry’s youth program, he’s affirming not just the player but the entire process—implying that the rookie possesses both the talent and the mindset to excel at the highest tier.Also Read: Caitlin Clark sidelined by sudden injury as everything changes for the Indiana Fever The Instagram Story by Stephen Curry does not seem much, but there is so much behind it than the mere remembrance of the days gone by: it is a strong statement.

Poll What is your prediction for the next match of the series? India wins England wins

NEW DELHI: India’s Under-19 team began their five-match Youth ODI series against England in emphatic fashion, cruising to a six-wicket win at Hove. Chasing 175, the visitors wrapped up the game in just 24 overs, thanks to a blistering debut knock from 14-year-old sensation Vaibhav Suryavanshi Suryavanshi, who became the youngest centurion in men’s T20s during this year’s IPL for Rajasthan Royals, lit up the County Ground with a 19-ball 48, hammering five sixes and three fours. His explosive innings set the tone for India’s dominance and earned him the spotlight on his first outing in English conditions.The teenager shared a 71-run stand in just 7.3 overs with skipper Ayush Mhatre before holing out to Ralphie Albert after an electric cameo. After the match, Suryavanshi posted a photo with the team’s sports massage therapist, Mangesh Gaikwad, accompanied by the inspiring track Aashayein from the movie Iqbal.Despite a mini-collapse after Suryavanshi’s departure, wicketkeeper-batter Abhigyan Kundu anchored the chase with an unbeaten 45, ensuring India crossed the finish line with a massive 26 overs to spare.Earlier, England chose to bat but were skittled out for 174 in 42.2 overs.Debutant Isaac Mohammed shone briefly with a rapid 28-ball 42, which included four sixes and three fours, while Rocky Flintoff top-scored with a gritty 56. However, consistent breakthroughs derailed England’s innings, with little support for the pair.India’s spinners, Mohamed Enaan and Kanishk Chouhan, combined for five wickets and applied the brakes throughout the middle overs. The bowlers were backed up by sharp fielding, including a run-out and some well-judged catches.The dominant win follows India’s 231-run demolition of a Young Lions Invitational XI at Loughborough earlier in the week, extending their commanding run on the tour.","India's Under-19s beat England's Youth ODI team by six wickets.

Former Indian cricketer Shikhar Dhawan has shared a personal story from the early days of his career in his autobiography, revealing details of a relationship he developed during the 2006 India A tour to Australia. In the book, Dhawan recounted how he secretly brought his girlfriend into the hotel room he was sharing with teammate Rohit Sharma , and how word of their relationship eventually spread through the team.During the tour, Dhawan met a woman with whom he quickly formed a strong bond, believing she might be his life partner.""She was very beautiful, and suddenly I was in love again! I thought to myself, 'She is the one for me, and I am going to marry her,"" Dhawan wrote in his autobiography.The tour began well for Dhawan, with a solid start on the field, but he admitted that his focus shifted as he spent more time with his girlfriend, whom he refers to as Ellen (not her real name).""I started with a half-century in a practice game, and my tour was progressing well. After every game, I would go over to meet up with Ellen (not her real name) and I soon started smuggling her into my hotel room which I was sharing with Rohit Sharma. Now and then, he would complain in Hindi. 'Will you let me sleep?'""Their relationship became widely known within the squad after a senior national selector spotted the two together.""One evening, when I headed for dinner with Ellen, news of her presence spread like wildfire throughout the entire squad. A senior national selector, who was on tour with us, spotted us walking in the lobby with our hands linked. It didn't even occur to me that I should let go of her hand, because to me, we were committing no crime. There was a good chance that if I had performed consistently on that Australia tour, I would have made it to the senior Indian side, but my performance kept dipping.

Poll Should the selectors change their approach to player selection? Yes, they need to be more flexible No, the current strategy is fine

Former India opener and current head coach Gautam Gambhir is facing mounting pressure after Team India’s worrying run in Test cricket, despite continued success in white-ball formats including winning the Champions Trophy.The latest setback came at Headingley, where India, under new captain Shubman Gill , lost to England by five wickets. This adds to previous series defeats against New Zealand and Australia. India have now won only one of their last nine Tests under Gambhir’s watch. The stretch includes a 3-0 whitewash in New Zealand and a 3-1 loss to Australia that saw India surrender the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.This rough patch has coincided with a transition period marked by the retirements of senior players Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma from Test cricket following the Australia series loss. A fresh team under Gill’s leadership is still settling in, but the start in England has been disappointing.Former India batter Aakash Chopra analysed the situation on his YouTube channel, urging patience with Gill but warning of rising pressure on Gambhir. “There is a lot of pressure on Gautam Gambhir. The pressure is absolutely mounting. He has won two matches against Bangladesh and one against Australia, but we lost three to New Zealand, three to Australia and now one to England.He has been losing and losing.”Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Chopra stressed there are no excuses left. “The selectors have given everything the coaching staff has asked for. So, if this is the case, then you also need to deliver the results.

Which WWE Championship changed hands on SmackDown before Night of Champions 2025 Premium Live Event?

WWE Night of Champions is only a day away from emanating from the Kingdom Arena in the rich city of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. WWE built much hype for the Premium Live Event in the same venue by presenting the June 27th edition of Friday Night SmackDown. It featured three top title matches on the card. While two titles managed to stay with their respective titleholders, a major championship changed hands following a highly spectacular showdown that captivated the Riyadh audience.On the June 27th edition of WWE SmackDown, Zelina Vega was scheduled to defend her WWE Women's United States Championship against Giulia. The international sensation had been having multiple encounters with Vega over the last few weeks since she was called up from WWE NXT. After Vega defeated Pipe Niven in a match with Giulia's help, she immediately turned on her and held the star-spangled prize high. This clearly hinted at her intentions, and the match was made official for SmackDown taking place in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.The duo clashed in an epic encounter that was a thrilling sight to witness. The Beautiful Madness unleashed her fury on the defending champion, who fought through it valiantly.From stunning drops to power-packed moves, Vega and Giulia stole the show. Towards the final moments of the title match, Giulia clearly had the upper hand, launching a pair of knee strikes. She put a conclusion to the bout by delivering a Northern Lights Bomb on Zelina Vega and pinned her shoulders to the mat for the three count.With that win, Giulia became the new WWE Women's United States Champion, marking her first singles title on the main roster. It was a sight of similar success being replicated by Giulia that she did when she arrived in NXT last year. While Zelina Vega did her best, her effort ultimately fell short at the hands of The Beautiful Madness. With Giulia winning her first major championship in WWE, it will be interesting to see her title reign on Friday Night SmackDown.Also read: Seth Rollins’ Money in the Bank cash-in — 4 possible WWE victims!

Miami’s decision to draft Noah Igbinoghene over future All-Pro Jonathan Taylor still sparks backlash years later,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/miamis-decision-to-draft-noah-igbinoghene-over-future-all-pro-jonathan-taylor-still-sparks-backlash-years-later/articleshow/122117871.cms,"Dolphins passed on Jonathan Taylor, and it still hurts (Image via: Getty Images)

Miami passed on Jonathan Taylor , and the regret hasn’t faded

The Miami Dolphins had three first-round picks in the 2020 NFL Draft. While Tua Tagovailoa and Austin Jackson remain starters, the pick that continues to draw criticism is Noah Igbinoghene. Miami passed on running back Jonathan Taylor, who has since become one of the league’s top rushers. That decision still sparks fan frustration and media backlash.With the No. 30 overall pick in the 2020 NFL Draft, the Miami Dolphins selected cornerback Noah Igbinoghene. At the time, the move raised questions, especially since running back Jonathan Taylor was still available.In three seasons with Miami, Igbinoghene started just five games before being traded to the Dallas Cowboys. Meanwhile, Taylor was selected at No. 41 overall by the Indianapolis Colts. Since then, he’s rushed for over 6,000 yards, ranking second in the NFL behind only Derrick Henry during that span.Taylor has already earned Pro Bowl honors and was named First-Team All-Pro in 2021. His impact has been consistent, and he’s become one of the league’s most reliable running backs. Igbinoghene, on the other hand, never made a lasting impact in Miami’s secondary.Bleacher Report’s Matt Holder recently called Igbinoghene the worst Dolphins draft pick of the last five years, not just because of his limited production, but because of who the team passed up. Putting Taylor into head coach Mike McDaniel’s offensive system could have changed everything.In 2023, the Dolphins had two running backs rush for over 800 yards. Adding Jonathan Taylor to that mix alongside Tua Tagovailoa, Tyreek Hill, and Jaylen Waddle might have made Miami’s offense one of the most dangerous in the league.Fans continue to look back at that 2020 draft with frustration. While Tagovailoa and Jackson have held up, the Igbinoghene pick is a clear miss. The Dolphins had a shot at one of the NFL’s best backs and passed.Also Read: Kylie Kelce opens about haircut warning sign that signals postpartum struggle: “Take me to the doctor” As Taylor keeps producing at a high level, Miami’s decision only looks worse with time.

Wayne Gretzky's early days in the WHA and that contract, which changed everything

Wayne Gretzky 🏒: The NHL Legend Who Was Never Actually Drafted! 🚀 #shorts #waynegretzky #nhl #hockey

Memories: Wayne Gretzky tallies his final NHL point

It might be an astonishing fact to learn that the greatest player in hockey history, Wayne Gretzky, was never drafted into the NHL . Current stars like Connor McDavid and Sidney Crosby had the honor of going first overall, but Wayne entered the league in an unusual backdoor way. This was not a case of some bizarre scouting miss; it was a perfect storm comprising age restriction, rival league, and one extraordinary contract in the making of hockey legends.Wayne Gretzky's path to the NHL began outside the NHL. At barely 17 years of age, he joined the World Hockey Association (WHA), a rival to the NHL, which allowed younger players to turn professional. He signed in 1978 with the Indianapolis Racers, but his stay there was short. After just eight games, the financially shaky team sold his contract to the Edmonton Oilers, another WHA franchise.Even so, Gretzky wasn’t an ordinary player. He had entered into a personal services contract, not a standard player contract. This meant that he was bound directly to the Oilers owner, Peter Pocklington, circumventing normal player rules. When the WHA merged with the NHL in 1979, the league found itself at a crossroads: would Gretzky be entered into the draft, or would he be allowed to play under his existing contract?In its endless whim against the league recession, the Colorado Rockies would supposedly snatch up my pick if I were drafted and moved.Hence, Gretzky insisted that he would remain in Edmonton. Following protracted deliberations, the NHL finally agreed to a compromise: the Oilers could keep Gretzky, but their draft order would be moved to the bottom for 1979. Thus, in 1979, they held the 21st overall pick and opted for Kevin Lowe, yet another future Hall of Famer.The introduction of Gretzky into the NHL marked the beginning of the epic dynasty in Edmonton. Over nine seasons, Gretzky led the Oilers to four Stanley Cups and set scoring records that no one has dared to touch till today, 2,857 career points, including 894 goals and 1,963 assists. While Alex Ovechkin did put an end to the goal record in 2025, no one has matched his total supremacy since.Also Read: From Canada’s hero to Donald Trump’s ally? Wayne Gretzky’s silence still feels like a betrayal to his home country Wayne Gretzky’s undrafted road to NHL greatness is a rare story told on the stage of timing, talent, and smart maneuvering. While today's prospects follow rigid draft rules, Gretzky proved that greatness does not always need permission to begin. His legacy remains one of the most remarkable and unrepeatable in all of sports history.","Wayne Gretzky, the greatest player in hockey history, was never drafted into the NHL.

Trey Hendrickson still waiting as Bengals’ contract offer fails to match market value

Bengals Star Trey Hendrickson SOUNDS OFF on Contract Status, Future in Cincinnati

Bengals defense needs Trey Hendrickson now more than ever



Trey Hendrickson has officially turned down a $28 million-per-year offer from the Cincinnati Bengals, intensifying his contract holdout and casting serious doubt over his future with the team. Despite leading the NFL in sacks last season, the star EDGE rusher remains unsigned long-term, fueling speculation that one of Cincinnati’s most dominant defenders could be on his way out in 2025.Trey Hendrickson isn’t just another pass rusher, he’s the most productive EDGE defender in the NFL over the last two seasons. After posting a league-leading 17 sacks in 2024 and a staggering total of 35 since 2023, Hendrickson has become the anchor of a Bengals defense that desperately needs his presence.Yet, despite his performance, the Bengals have reportedly offered just $28 million annually—a figure well below market value for a player of Hendrickson’s caliber. While the deal would place him eighth among NFL EDGE defenders in annual salary, it still falls short of what most believe he’s worth in today’s rising salary cap environment.According to NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero, Hendrickson isn’t demanding to surpass Myles Garrett’s record-setting $40 million AAV.Instead, he’s seeking multi-year security that reflects his elite status and long-term impact in Cincinnati.“He would like to get a multi-year deal that gives him security and keeps him in Cincinnati,” Pelissero stated on The Rich Eisen Show. “Bengals just have not stepped up with significant enough of an offer for him to take it.”The Bengals’ hesitation to lock in Trey Hendrickson is raising concerns—especially after their defense struggled during the 2024 season. With Joe Burrow returning healthy, Cincinnati is back in win-now mode. Losing their top defensive player could seriously hurt those chances.Also Read: Michael Penix Jr. takes over as Falcons’ starting QB; $27.5M Kirk Cousins moved to backup role To make matters worse, stars like T.J. Watt are also due for new deals, and market prices are rising. If the Bengals wait too long, they risk overpaying later or losing Hendrickson entirely. And if that happens, the Bengals may find out just how hard it is to replace a true game-changer off the edge.","Trey Hendrickson has officially turned down a $28 million-per-year offer from the Cincinnati Bengals.
