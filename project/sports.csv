T20 World Cup: Does India having four spinners feel like a luxury?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/t20-world-cup-does-india-having-four-spinners-feel-like-a-luxury/articleshow/110578744.cms,"ALSO SEE:

Experts, fans and analysts point out that by selecting four spinners in India’s squad of 15 for the T20 World Cup , the selectors, led by Ajit Agarkar, have picked one spinner too many. “Another fast bowler, perhaps” or “Rinku Singh, surely” were words that formed part of their analysis.It was clear that Rohit Sharma wanted four spinners, and his mind about who would feature in his bowling attack (two allrounders, also left-arm-spinners, in Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel , and two wrist spinners in Yuzvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav ) was made up before the IPL.Morning starts, where dew would not play much of a role was one of the reasons cited.“I definitely wanted four spinners. We’ve played a lot of cricket there. We know what the conditions are like. With morning starts at 10-10.30am, there’s a little bit of technical aspect involved in this,” skipper Rohit had said in Mumbai when the team was picked.That technical aspect could be the fact that India are expected to qualify for the super-eights and all the games from that stage will be played in the West Indies and the general belief is that the pitches there will be spin-friendly.Former India manager and Tamil Nadu left-arm spinner Sunil Subramanian, also Indian legend R Ashwin’s coach, feels that way.“India may have picked one spin-bowling allrounder too many. Rinku Singh for Axar and Khaleel Ahmed for vice-captain Hardik would have balanced the side better. There is no way both wrist spinners will play, especially in Nassau County in New York. It is a mickey mouse ground with the straight boundary being 55 metres only. Also, it is a drop-in pitch. Against Pakistan, they may play with only one spinner and that could be Jadeja as they may want to pack the side with pacers who can execute yorkers,” he told TOI.Subramanian was part of the team between 2017 and 2019, where India played both Kuldeep and Chahal in most white-ball games, with success. Will we see that happening in the T20 World Cup?“The reason both the wrist spinners featured in the playing XI was because both Jadeja and Ashwin were not able to contain the flow of runs in the middle-overs and were not able to pick wickets,” Subramanian revealed.The 'Kul-Cha' combo, as it was called, was a run-away success. They played in 15 T20I games together, including four of the five matches in the West Indies in 2023 and India ended up victorious in 11 of them. In those 15 games, Kuldeep picked 29 wickets while Chahal picked 23. Will they go back to that formula?“Only if they are in a must-win situation. If Hardik is unable to bowl four overs and if one of the pacers gets hit, that may happen. But only in the West Indies leg of the tournament. The only other way to play both wrist spinners is by dropping Jaiswal and opening with Kohli and Rohit. They will not do that. They will err on the side of caution,” Subramanian stressed.India’s batting coach till the 2019 World Cup, who was with the team in the Kul-Cha era, and former India allrounder Sanjay Bangar, also does not see both Kuldeep and Chahal playing together.“It will be Jadeja and Kuldeep to start with. Two wrist spinners won’t feature in the same XI,” opined Bangar.Interestingly, he does not see India being light on pace bowling options either. “Even if we had picked an extra pacer, he might not have played. Bumrah, Siraj/Arshdeep and Hardik can go through the tournament unchanged,” he told TOI.Former West Indies pacer Ian Bishop, a respected voice in commentary, who is armed with local knowledge of the conditions, felt India’s four-spinner theory could be a luxury while acknowledging spin will play a part in the tournament.His assessment can be supported by the fact that in all CPLT20 matches so far, featuring 692 innings, pacers have taken 2384 wickets at a strike rate of 131.31 and an economy of 8.38. Spinners have grabbed 1565 wickets at a better strike-rate of 111.60 and a lower economy of 6.85.“The pitches for the World Cup may be slightly different. So, I think it’s a luxury to have four spinners rather than it being a necessity,” he told official broadcasters Star Sports.Aaron Finch, the man who led Australia to the title in the UAE in 2021 feels India may have “backed themselves into a corner.”“I had Rinku in there and only two spinners. I had the extra quick because of the inconsistency that we have seen with everyone barring Jasprit Bumrah. And if they want to play three spinners, one of them must bowl in the powerplay. I don’t see any of those guys doing it consistently,” Finch analysed while speaking to Star Sports.Now let’s look at the spin-bowling options of other teams expected to feature in the super-eights.Sri Lanka have six, England and New Zealand have five, Bangladesh have four and West Indies, Australia, and South Africa three. Does India having four feel like a luxury? Time will tell.","India have picked four spinners in their squad for the T20 World Cup.

He emphasized that the decision was not made on a whim but rather as part of a carefully crafted plan.The decision to include four spinners alongside three pacers has elicited varied opinions. Among them, Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal represent the wrist-spin department, while Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel offer left-arm spin options along with their all-round abilities.Former Australian captain Michael Clarke also voiced his opinion on the issue saying India's spin-heavy bowling lineup is going to play a decisive role in determining the outcome.""I think India have taken a risk with the squad they have picked - heavily reliant on spin, very different from Australia. But in the conditions that I have played in the Caribbean I think how you play spin is going to be a huge part of whether you succeed or not.

I still remember that when Narine first came into the IPL in 2012, it was in Jaipur, and we were going for practice, and I told him to come join for lunch. He was so shy that he did not say a single word during lunch, and the first question that he eventually asked was, 'Can I bring my girlfriend to the IPL?',"" Gambhir recalled.Gambhir suggested that he and Narine share a special bond, describing the all-rounder as a brother.""He was so quiet that first season, but now, we can talk about anything. He is like a brother to me. I don't see him as a friend, I don't see him as a teammate, I see him as a brother. If I need him or he needs me, I think we are just one call away, that is the sort of relationship that we have built. We do not get excited much, we do not show too many emotions, we are not flamboyant, we just do the job and come back,"" he added.Gambhir also emphasized Narine’s consistent value to KKR, asserting that he has always been the team's 'MVP'.""What can I say about him? Even if he didn't win the 'most valuable player award' he would have still been the MVP. You are looking at his stats but he was KKR's MVP even before the season got underway.

NEW DELHI: Following rain-marred ICC T20 World Cup preparations , England pacer Mark Wood emphasized that the team will make ""no excuses,"" with several players keen to get more runouts at the Oval to enhance their confidence.The first two T20I matches of the series against Pakistan at Headingley and Cardiff were called off without a ball being bowled. England secured a 23-run victory in the second game at Edgbaston, and they are optimistic for improved conditions in Thursday's series finale at the Oval, despite the forecast predicting more rain.""Obviously, it's not ideal when you schedule four games and we might only get one or two. A few of the lads are keen to get a run out at the Oval, so that will help. It will give confidence to everyone in the group,"" fast bowler Wood said as quoted by Sky Sports.""It was a good game the other day against Pakistan. They looked like they were pushing us really close, and might have got there in the end if it wasn't for such good bowling and shutting the game out from (Reece) Topley, (Chris) Jordan and (Jofra) Archer,"" he added.In Group B, England will face off against rivals Australia, Scotland, Namibia, and Oman. The defending champions will kick off their campaign against Scotland on June 4th.""Yes, we have got experience, but warm-up games always give you a sense of different things you can tinker with. Who is in good form? Who needs to work on other things? Some lads have been playing at the IPL and they are match-ready. Other lads haven't, and the lads that haven't, is there a freshness?"" asked the pacer.""You want the games to practise stuff, but it is a fine balance. One or two of us might feel like we need a game or two to get going, but there will be no excuses. It is coming round thick and fast. Whatever preparation we get, that is what we are going to have to go with,"" he added.The comeback of Jofra Archer , the fellow fast bowler of Wood, to international cricket has been the most significant development for England during the Pakistan series . Archer made his first appearance for his country in fourteen months at Edgbaston, claiming two wickets. After grappling with recurrent issues with his right elbow over the past few injury-plagued years, he had not represented his country on home turf since 2020.""The mark of Jofra is that he is always in the game, always at people. There is always a chance of wickets and him changing the game. He bowled that difficult over - that sixth over is a tough one, it is the last over of the powerplay where the batters are looking to score heavy, and I am sure he would have been nervous,"" Wood said.""He is a pretty cool guy, and as soon as he got that over out of the way he would have settled into the game. To bowl those next three overs for next to nothing shows a great deal of resilience, which is something he has had to show over the past few years,"" the pacer added.","England pacer Mark Wood says team will make ""no excuses"" after rain-marred T20 World Cup preparations.

NEW DELHI: Former Australia Test captain Tim Paine advocates for Nathan Ellis to be Australia's third fast-bowling option in the upcoming T20 World Cup , set to commence on June 1 in the West Indies and the USA.Ellis, aged 29, is lauded for his craftiness as a pacer, boasting an arsenal of variations. Despite not securing a permanent spot in the team, he has showcased his talent by claiming 24 wickets in 14 T20Is for Australia.Notably, Ellis served as a reserve player during Australia's triumph in the 2021 T20 World Cup in UAE. However, he was omitted from the 15-member squad for the 2022 edition hosted at home.Paine's endorsement highlights Ellis's potential to contribute significantly to Australia's bowling attack in the upcoming tournament.""I think Australia have a great opportunity, and I hope they take it in this World Cup, and that is to pick Nathan Ellis. He would be my third quick. I think he just complements the other guys really well, he's got a different skillset, comes from a different angle, different height, and thinks some variety in the attack will be really important to win this World Cup,"" said Paine to ESPN's Around The Wicket show.In IPL 2024, Ellis made only one appearance for Punjab Kings , contributing with figures of 1-24 in a rare victory for his team, which struggled and finished second-last in the points table. During Australia's first T20 World Cup warm-up match against Namibia, Ellis continued to impress, picking up 1-17 from his four overs.Given Ellis's consistent performances, former Australia Test captain Paine views him as a definite starter for the upcoming tournament. However, Paine believes the selection of the other pacer would be a toss-up between experienced campaigners Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins , adding depth and versatility to Australia's bowling lineup.""I know you are going to ask me straightaway who aren't you playing…I'm going to go Mitchell Starc , (he) is my out and out number one quick, I'm picking him, obviously going with Adam Zampa, and I'm going to decide between Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins.""I'm going to pick one of them and I'm going to go with Nathan Ellis' all-round skills, his ability to bowl all through the powerplay, I think his slower balls, he's clever. His international record for the opportunities that he's been given is outstanding and I think now is the right time.""That's not to say they (Cummins and Hazlewood) are not the best couple of bowlers in the country, they are outstanding bowlers, and will continue to be, I just think Nathan Ellis complements the rest of that attack really, really well,"" he added.Australia are set to face co-hosts West Indies in another warm-up match before kicking off their campaign against Group B opponents Oman at the Kensington Oval in Barbados on June 5. Subsequently, they will compete against England, Namibia, and Scotland in the league stage of the tournament.This rigorous schedule will provide Australia with ample opportunities to fine-tune their strategies and gauge their form ahead of the crucial matchups in the T20 World Cup. With a blend of experienced players and emerging talents, Australia aim to make a strong statement in pursuit of T20 World Cup glory.","Former Australia Test captain Tim Paine advocates for Nathan Ellis to be Australia's third fast-bowling option in the upcoming T20 World Cup.

'I know what to expect': Aiden Markram seeks to build on junior T20 World Cup glory,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/i-know-what-to-expect-aiden-markram-seeks-to-build-on-junior-t20-world-cup-glory/articleshow/110568008.cms,"(With AFP inputs)

NEW DELHI: Aiden Markram holds a unique advantage as no other South African cricket captain has led a team to victory in a World Cup before.He captained the team that won the 2014 Under-19 World Cup .Acknowledging the ten-year gap since that victory, Markram understands the significant difference between a junior tournament and the men's T20 World Cup . He will lead South Africa's campaign starting against Sri Lanka in New York on Monday.""There aren't so many eyes watching you in an age-group tournament, and as a youngster you are maybe a bit oblivious to pressure,"" Markram told AFP in a telephone interview.""Back then it was just a matter of handling what was in front of you. Now there is a lot more planning and preparation and making sure everyone is in a good space.""A World Cup is a massive event but I'm fortunate to have been to quite a few so I know what to expect. One thing that hasn't changed is that I'm excited to be part of it,"" he said.In 2014, Markram led by example, scoring 370 runs at an average of 123.33, earning the title of player of the tournament.He also had the support of the talented fast bowler Kagiso Rabada , who was the team's leading wicket-taker and played a key role in dismantling Australia's lineup in the semi-finals.Rabada is the only player from the 2014 squad who will join Markram in the United States and the West Indies.Markram acknowledges that South Africa's T20 results since he and coach Rob Walter took charge early last year have been less than stellar. Under his leadership, the team secured only two wins in eight matches, all of which were played at home.Last week, without Markram and six other Indian Premier League (IPL) players, South Africa lost all three games against the West Indies in Jamaica. Consequently, South Africa enters the World Cup ranked a lowly seventh by the International Cricket Council.However, Markram believes these results don't reflect the team's true potential, noting that South Africa has rarely fielded a full-strength team due to managing player workloads and giving opportunities to new players.""We've got a good team,"" he said.South Africa boasts a potentially powerful batting lineup, featuring talents like Quinton de Kock , Aiden Markram, Heinrich Klaasen , David Miller, and the exciting Tristan Stubbs, who was one of the stars of the recent IPL.Among these, only de Kock played against the West Indies.Coach Rob Walter emphasized that he selected bowlers capable of making crucial early strikes in T20 matches. Anrich Nortje, the team's fastest bowler, is a key player but has struggled in the IPL and against the West Indies after returning from a long-term stress fracture.""He had a massive injury and a lot of time away from the game but we all back him and know what he can do,"" said Markram.The South Africa captain, along with Klaasen and Marco Jansen, only arrived at the team's training base in Fort Lauderdale on Tuesday night after being involved in the IPL final in Chennai on Sunday.""You get used to it,"" he said of the travel. ""It's a reality for a lot of players these days.""In a way it is quite nice to get straight into training and getting ready for Monday. Sri Lanka have a great T20 team and it's important to get off to a good start.""",Aiden Markram captained South Africa in the 2014 Under-19 World Cup.

I just want to request one thing which we really need for the next four weeks. Let us all support our players,"" the PCB chairman told the media in London, according to Geo News.The first and third T20I matches of the ongoing series were washed out due to rain without a ball being bowled. In the second T20I, England took a 1-0 lead, thanks to skipper Jos Buttler 's impressive 84-run blitz, which played a pivotal role.Pakistan has been adjusting their team combination during their series against Ireland and England. Unlike other teams, which have opted for more spinners, Pakistan has chosen to name a pace-heavy 15-player squad for the tournament.When asked about Pakistan's combination for the World Cup, Naqvi affirmed that a strategy is in place and emphasized that the players need to give their best on the field.""Overall, a strategy is in place that they don't have to panic and give their best [on the field],"" Naqvi noted.Pakistan find itself in Group A and are set to commence their campaign against the tournament's co-hosts, the United States, on June 6.

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan wicketkeeper-batter Kamran Akmal has endorsed Michael Vaughan 's controversial remark that the Indian Premier League IPL ) is preferable to playing against Pakistan given the team's performance in the recent past.Vaughan's statement stirred debate, with the ex-Pakistan player aligning with his sentiment. While Vaughan's comment drew criticism for its insensitivity towards international cricket, it also reflects the IPL's stature as a premier T20 league.Former England skipper Vaughan's comment was made in relation to the ongoing T20I series between Pakistan and England. He suggested that the England Cricket Board (ECB) should have permitted its players to participate in the IPL rather than returning for the Pakistan series.Vaughan argued that playing in the IPL would have provided better preparation for the upcoming T20 World Cup . This perspective underscores the growing significance of franchise-based leagues like the IPL in shaping players' skills and readiness for international tournaments, sparking discussions about the balance between league commitments and national team duties.In a recent video on his YouTube channel 'Catch And Bat with Kamran Akmal', he echoed Vaughan's sentiments, expressing agreement with the notion that Pakistan's recent performances have been disappointing. He went on to describe the IPL as ""tough and quality cricket,"" emphasising the competitive nature of the tournament.Akmal's endorsement of Vaughan's viewpoint further underscores the acknowledgment within the cricketing community of the IPL's prominence and the challenges it presents.""Over the past few days, I have wondered why a former England captain is commenting and taking Pakistan cricket non-seriously. It has been a painful thought, but I think he was correct in his assessment,"" Akmal said.""Everybody knows the level of Pakistan cricket. We are losing against smaller teams like Ireland and in that sense Vaughan said that it is not a tough series. So the fault is ours. Had it been any other team like New Zealand, South Africa and India then Vaughan would not have said it.We need to understand that in IPL, the best bowlers and batters are participating with crowds of 40 to 50,000. So it is tough cricket and quality cricket,"" Akmal explained.Akmal additionally suggested that Pakistan should leverage Vaughan's comments as 'motivation' heading into the T20 World Cup.""The state of Pakistan cricket may be in need of a revamp, but this also presents an opportunity for growth. How do we respond to Vaughan's critique? By showing our mettle in the upcoming T20 series against England. Let's use this as a catalyst to regain our confidence and competitiveness, lest even teams like the USA start to see us as an easy target.""""The Pakistan cricket Chairman is to blame for all of this as he has completely ruffled the system. For now it remains to be seen if Pakistan team rises to the situation or keeps playing in the same zone as they have done till now,"" he concluded.",Former Pakistan wicketkeeper-batter Kamran Akmal has endorsed Michael Vaughan's controversial remark that the Indian Premier League IPL is preferable to playing against Pakistan.

Mendilibar expressed his satisfaction with the achievement, saying, ""I am very happy that we achieved something that the club had not achieved before. We will celebrate, we will cheer and then we will get back to work for what comes next.""The triumph was celebrated both inside the AEK Arena, with fans erupting in joy upon the goal's confirmation, and outside the stadium, where supporters in Piraeus engaged in vibrant celebrations.This victory marked Olympiakos as the first Greek club to win a European trophy, a notable achievement considering the closest any Greek club had come before was Panathinaikos' loss in the 1971 European Cup final.For Fiorentina, this defeat represented their second consecutive loss in theEuropa Conference League final and extended their wait for a trophy since 2001. Despite reaching the final without a single defeat, Vincenzo Italiano 's side faced disappointment, mirroring their loss in the previous season's Coppa Italia final.Stevan Jovetic , currently a forward for Olympiakos who had a history with Fiorentina, shared his pride in his team's performance throughout the year, stating, ""Amazing. For Olympiakos and me. Really proud of my guys. We did great all year and deserved it.""","Olympiakos secured a 1-0 victory over Fiorentina after extra time, clinching their first significant European title in the form of UEFA Europa Conference League. Ayoub El Kaabi scored the decisive goal in the 116th minute. This victory marked Olympiakos as the first Greek club to win a European trophy.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110549692,imgsize-76874,width-400,resizemode-4/110549692.jpg"

Any India match in the City of Joy garners substantial attention, but this particular fixture holds special importance.With three points, the Blue Tigers can take a significant step towards securing a spot in Round 3 of the FIFA World Cup 2026 Qualifiers, while also edging closer to automatic qualification for the AFC Asian Cup Saudi Arabia 2027.The enthusiastic crowd comprising officials from the Indian Football Association (West Bengal), passionate fans, and members of the media warmly greeted the Indian football team at the Netaji Subhash Chandra International Airport on Wednesday afternoon. However, amidst the excitement, all eyes were on one man - Sunil Chhetri.Earlier this month, Chhetri announced that June 6 would mark his final appearance in the international arena, adding an emotional layer to an already significant match for Indian football.As the team prepares for this pivotal encounter, the spotlight shines brightly on Chhetri, a true icon of Indian football, as he prepares to bid farewell to the national team.The India skipper, ahead of the team's departure from Bhubaneswar, took to his social media platforms to share his thoughts, ""These last few days, I've been caught in a bit of a dilemma. Now that there's a number to my days with the National Team, what's the right route to take - do I count every day, every training session? Or do I simply turn up without the thought of how this is coming to an end?""For now, Chhetri, who has netted an impressive 94 goals in 150 international appearances, is grateful for each day and counting his blessings.""Over time, I seemed to have found middle ground. They say, count your blessings. And every single day I get to be on the pitch is a blessing that I've never taken for granted,"" he wrote. ""So I've decided to count my sessions, but with a deep sense of gratitude. There's no apprehension. Instead, there's a feeling of being indebted to the sport, to my team, that I get to do this.""If I could, I would capture this feeling in a box. Or instead, I'll take it to my next training session.""The India number 11, alongside the other 26 players, will now continue their training camp in Kolkata. Their first on-field training session is scheduled for Thursday.","The Indian football team has arrived in Kolkata, the Mecca of Indian football.

The clay court major is the first Grand Slam to ban spirits in the stands.At the end of the epic second-round clash between Iga Swiatek and Naomi Osaka , where the world No.1 rallied from 2-5 in the decider, the Pole appealed to fans not to 'shout during rallies'. Swiatek, who alluded that French crowds could be 'harsh', was caught weeping on camera after the clash. Perhaps a release of the pressure that weighed on her in the near three-hour match.A couple of days ago, Belgium's David Goffin said he was 'spat at by a fan'. Tournament director Amelie Mauresmo in a bid to curb unruly behaviour announced that spectators will not be allowed to consume alcohol in the stands. Mauresmo warned: ""If they exceed the limit, if they don't behave well or if they throw things at the players, that's it.""Swiatek was at the receiving end of the support for Osaka, who was both the underdog and comeback player in this contest. 'Please don't shout during the rallies. This is serious for us,"" said the 23-year-old. ""The stakes are big, there's a lot of money to win, losing a few points may change a lot.""A spectator shouted midway through the third set, resulting in Swiatek missing a half-volley. ""I got most frustrated when I missed that volley,"" she said. ""It happened more times, if it happened one time, I would just let it go. French crowds can be kind of harsh. I don't know if it was a good decision or not (to speak), but I hope they can treat me as a human.""Osaka, who looked at home on the court, gave the Philippe Chatrier atmosphere the thumbs up. ""I thought the crowd was really cool. I feel like those are the moments I live for,"" the 26-year-old Japanese said. ""Also, it just makes me feel like the crowd is having fun, and at the end of the day that's what I want the most. I want people to be, like, no matter if I won or lost they said, I watched the match and I had a great time.""The fifth seed in the men's draw Daniil Medvedev, who has had his share of run-ins with spectators, said there were two ways to look at it. ""There's an official rule, don't interrupt players before second serve and when they're ready to serve and during the point,"" Medvedev said. ""Personally, I like it. Because it (tennis) is so technical and every millimetre of movement that you change, the ball is going to go to a different side. If someone screams in your ear you could double fault. Also, if there was no such rule, we would get used to it.""The Russian, asked about fans at the other majors, said French crowds were 'not easy'. ""I think a lot of players experience it,"" he said. ""I would say that the US Open and Wimbledon (crowds) are not the same. Australia (also) can be tough.""Paula Badosa vouched that it was louder on the smaller courts. ""I played in small courts these days, I was hearing so much noise. In that moment, I'm just so focused on myself and on my match that it doesn't really bother me,"" said the Spaniard, who is fighting her way back from injury. ""I like when fans cheer, I get pumped. We had a tough situation when we were playing without fans during Covid-19. So now, for me, I'm so happy they're back.""",French Open bans alcohol in galleries of match courts.
