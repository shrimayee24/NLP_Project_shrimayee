People put up with her tantrums/non sense just because she is @amitabhbachchan ji's wife. That Samajwadi topi looks like a rooster comb, while she looks like a rooster cock!! Such disgrace and shame.”The incident took place while Bachchan was accompanied by fellow parliamentarian, Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Priyanka Chaturvedi.

In 2020, after the Sholay actor described the film industry as a “gutter,” Kangana had said, “Jaya ji would you say the same thing if in my place it was your daughter Shweta beaten, drugged and molested as a teenage, would you say the same thing if Abhishek complained about bullying and harassment constantly and found hanging one day?

Taylor Swift was extremely private about her relationship with Joe Alwyn, years before she met Travis Kelce



Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have been pretty public about their relationship ever since the two started dating in 2023. The two high profile stars never tried to hide their relationship and were always spotted in public holding hands as they went on their dates. In 2023, just months after Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce began dating, she opened up about why she is so public with the Kansas City Chiefs’ star player.In 2023, the billionaire pop star, Taylor Swift became the 2023 Time Person of the Year. The “Cruel Summer” singer spoke to TIME about her relationship with Travis Kelce and the reason behind their public romance.Taylor Swift said, “When you say a relationship is public, that means I’m going to see him do what he loves, we’re showing up for each other, other people are there and we don’t care…”The billionaire pop star added, “The opposite of that is you have to go to an extreme amount of effort to make sure no one knows that you’re seeing someone. And we’re just proud of each other.”Taylor Swift’s public romance with Travis Kelce is completely opposite to how she was with her ex boyfriends, including in her long relationship with Hollywood actor, Joe Alwyn.Taylor Swift has always been extremely protective of her romances and has always tried to keep them out of the public eye.Despite being together for six years, Taylor Swift and her ex boyfriend, Joe Alwyn, were hardly ever spotted together in public.The two were mostly seen hiding their faces and running away from cameras to avoid being linked together.With Travis Kelce, Taylor Swift is completely different as she is extremely public about their expensive date nights. The billionaire pop star shocked her fans when she arrived at the stadium in 2023 to cheer on Travis Kelce, just weeks after rumours of their romance had begun.Now, it’s been two years and Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are deeply in love with each other and are still going strong. While there are speculations about their engagement, neither of them have confirmed their future plans yet and have maintained complete privacy over their much speculated future.It seems the two are now in for a long haul and are trying to spend all their time with each other. Both Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have also met each other's families and have often been spotted frequently hanging out in public. So it seems its only the inevitable that they would announce their future plans soon even though they are keeping things pretty private.Also Read: Selena Gomez opens up about Taylor Swift as the singer and Travis Kelce reportedly end all ties with Blake Lively","Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce started dating in 2023.

A mother's instinct kicks in as symptoms spark a race against time

Inside the emergency room where doctors worked swiftly to stabilise baby Capri

Family turmoil, NFL commitments, and the one update fans needed to hear

Global fanbase rallies around the family as messages of support pour in

A late-night dash to the emergency room turned into a wave of relief for Miami Dolphins star Tyreek Hill’s family when his eight-month-old daughter, Capri, was admitted with sudden alarming symptoms. The little girl, shared with Hill’s estranged wife Keeta Vaccaro, had grown unusually warm, lethargic, and “not herself.” Quick-thinking calls and faster medical hands helped her bounce back, with doctors now calling her recovery a ‘positive turn’.Keeta Vaccaro shared the moment every parent dreads — the instant one knows something isn’t right. In her Instagram update, she described noticing Capri’s heavy eyes and warm skin before rushing to phone pediatrician Dr. Jared Friedman. Within minutes, hospital doors swung open and nurses had her baby hooked up for tests. “Last night was scary,” she admitted, her words carrying the weight of those anxious hours.Hospital photos showed Capri, wrapped in a light orange gown, clutching her blanket like a shield. Keeta thanked Dr. Friedman for calming her in the chaos, recalling his text: “We got this. We are a Team!” Blood work and viral panels were done swiftly, each step explained gently so a worried mother could breathe.By sunrise, Capri’s temperature had settled, and she was responding to treatment with more alertness and strength.The scare comes just months after Keeta filed for divorce in April, with Capri’s November 2024 birth marking a bright chapter in an otherwise turbulent year. Hill, sidelined from a Dolphins practice by an undisclosed injury, has not confirmed if he was at the ER. Still, Capri’s life has been well documented on Keeta’s feed — from six-month milestones to Sunday church visits — proof that love can remain the anchor when life turns rough.As Keeta’s post spread, thousands of followers jumped in to comfort her. “Glad she is ok!” one wrote, while another shared, “Oh no!!! I’m glad she is feeling better!” A third simply said, “Thank God she’s ok.” For many parents, it was a story that hit home — that late-night terror, the helpless waiting, the relief of seeing your child smile again.From a panic-filled midnight to a hopeful morning, Capri’s quick recovery has become the only headline that matters for the Hills. And for those who have followed Keeta’s journey, the sight of her daughter resting peacefully is more than news — it’s a shared moment of gratitude. In times like this, the power of family love and the kindness of a supportive community feel more real than ever. Across the globe, fans continue to send prayers and warm wishes, reminding the young family they're not alone in this fight.Although Tyreek Hill and Keeta Vaccaro are separated and navigating a difficult divorce, their shared love for Capri remains the unbreakable bond that keeps them connected as family above all else. In every whispered prayer and hopeful glance toward the future, that love shines through- reminding us all that even in hardship, family endures.And for Keeta, that night will forever be proof that a mother's strength rises highest when her child needed her most. For Tyreek, it was a quiet remainder that fatherhood's truest measure came in moments of presence and care. Capri's smile the next morning was perhaps the clearest sign yet that brighter days were on their way- and that both her parents, despite everything, would always stand guard over her heart. In that shared love, they found a fragile but unbreakable hope that would guide them through whatever lay ahead.Together, they learned that love, even in its quietest forms, holds the power to heal wounds, mend fears, and light the darkest paths with unwavering faith. And in that simple truth, they discovered a strength deeper than any hardship-a love fierce enough to carry them through every storm. Their bond stood strong, a light through every storm.Also Read: Disney’s ESPN strikes landmark deal to buy NFL Network — league grabs 10% stake in blockbuster swap","Miami Dolphins star Tyreek Hill's daughter Capri rushed to ER.

All eyes on Dak Prescott as Cowboys prepare for season-defining clash in Philadelphia



The Dallas Cowboys traded game-day gear for glamour on Monday night, hosting a Blue Carpet premiere for their upcoming Netflix documentary, which will debut on August 19. While the evening was filled with cameras, celebrities, and suited-up players, quarterback Dak Prescott still found himself in the headlines — this time for being labelled “overpaid” by ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith.Smith, one of the Cowboys’ most persistent and outspoken critics, wasted no time delivering his verdict on Tuesday’s edition of First Take. While the panel initially debated whether Dallas would be taking a bigger gamble by trading star pass rusher Micah Parsons or by locking him into a record-setting extension, Smith quickly shifted the conversation to Prescott.Calling the Cowboys quarterback “overpaid,” Smith argued that the team’s repeated restructuring of his contract five times in total was proof that the franchise has mishandled its financial planning. He reminded viewers that Prescott’s deal briefly made him the highest-paid player in the NFL last season, a status Smith insists is not justified by his postseason résumé.The criticism is nothing new for Prescott, who has often found himself under the microscope during his nine seasons with Dallas. Despite putting up strong regular-season numbers, his playoff record has fuelled doubts among pundits, with Smith being one of the loudest voices questioning whether he can lead the Cowboys to a Super Bowl.While Smith sharpened his barbs, the Cowboys enjoyed their Hollywood moment. Owner Jerry Jones, speaking at the premiere, said he relishes the attention, whether from fans or detractors, because it reflects the team’s enduring relevance.Also Read: Tom Brady on Josh Allen and Lamar Jackson: ‘I don’t love predictions and hypothesizing’ about first Super Bowl win That spotlight will intensify in Week 1, when Dallas travels to Philadelphia to face the defending NFC champions during their Super Bowl banner-raising celebration.

Green Bay Packers quarterback Jordan Love will undergo a minor procedure this week to treat a ligament in his left thumb, but according to the team, it’s not expected to affect his availability for the regular-season opener. The injury, sustained during a preseason game against the New York Jets, involves Love’s non-throwing hand, and Green Bay is confident he will return to practice as soon as next week.General Manager Brian Gutekunst shared the update during his press conference on Tuesday morning, reassuring fans that while the surgery is necessary, the timeline remains on track. Love was already back at practice Monday, with his thumb taped and participating in limited drills.Jordan Love hurt his thumb during the final play of a preseason matchup against the New York Jets. While the injury wasn’t immediately serious, medical evaluations revealed ligament damage that required minor surgical repair. “That last play when he kind of split two guys, I think a helmet just got it,” Gutekunst said.“I think he had some options with what he could do,” Gutekunst said, adding, “Obviously, you guys saw him out there, he certainly was able to function.But as we looked at all the options – and he did as well – the best option, I think, for him to get back the fastest and feel the best was to do this. And he wanted to go out there yesterday to kind of see how it felt. And once we got through that, we made the decision. And he should meet us in Indy on Wednesday. ”Though any injury during the NFL offseason raises concern, especially to a starting quarterback, the Packers seem to be treating this one as more of a bump than a roadblock. Gutekunst said, “I think as he gets back, we’ll kind of assess where he’s at. It’s one of those things where I think he’ll be back at practice next week. How much he can do leading into that Seattle game, we’ll kind of see. It’ll be day-to-day a little bit. You never want any of these guys to be out because you want to be working as a team. They all need the work, obviously. More importantly, he’ll be ready for Week 1, and that’s the most important thing.” He added, “I think we’ll get him back in plenty of time. And I don’t foresee this affecting him long-term at all.”The Packers are scheduled to travel to Indianapolis on Wednesday ahead of joint practices with the Indianapolis Colts on Thursday. The teams will square off in a preseason matchup on Saturday, though Love’s availability for that game is still unclear and likely dependent on how he recovers in the coming days.Love has looked good in training camp and his short recovery time isn’t expected to slow him down as the Packers get ready for Week 1.","Green Bay Packers quarterback Jordan Love will undergo a minor procedure this week to treat a ligament in his left thumb.

Florida Panthers’ veteran core pursues historic third Stanley Cup win



The Florida Panthers Are Aiming to Become a Dynasty

Matthew Tkachuk's status remains uncertain



A new wave of Florida Panthers prospects on the rise



The Florida Panthers head into the 2025-26 NHL season with one situation on the horizon—a chance to become part of hockey lore with a third straight Stanley Cup title. A tough-minded vision that has already etched its name on the biggest of stages is heading the team, and the Florida Panthers blend a mixture of issues: burnout from deep playoff runs, injury issues regarding top forward Matthew Tkachuk, and whether new additions and young players can shoulder the burden.The Florida Panthers roster remains pretty much the same as the team that beat the Edmonton Oilers in consecutive Stanley Cup Finals. But the pursuit of a three-peat will push them to their limits as never before.This year's journey will be made even more challenging by a condensed schedule to fit in the Olympic Winter Games Milano Cortina 2026. With over eight Panthers likely to represent their nations, head coach Paul Maurice will be required to monitor minutes closely.The biggest question hanging over camp is Matthew Tkachuk's health. The 27-year-old winger contributed 23 points in last season's playoffs with a torn adductor muscle and sports hernia suffered at the 4 Nations Face-Off. How and when he recovered isn't known, with general manager Bill Zito not ready to comment on whether Tkachuk had surgery.If Matthew Tkachuk starts the season on long-term injured reserve, the Panthers will enjoy short-term salary cap relief.But if he's healthy for opening night, Florida may be forced to make roster moves to stay under the $95.5 million cap.Goaltending depth in the spotlightVeteran netminder Sergei Bobrovsky, set to be 37 in September, is still Florida's undisputed starter. But the team will need backup, Daniil Tarasov, to play at least 20–25 games. Tarasov, acquired on a one-year contract, replaces Vitek Vanecek and has a checkered NHL resume, but the Panthers believe that goaltending coach Rob Tallas and Roberto Luongo's crew can help him elevate his game.Outside of the primary roster fight, Florida's system is a source of hope. Defenseman Matvei Shuravin, a 6-foot-4, mobile blue-liner, was a standout in the MHL in Russia, and University of Denver product Jack Devine paced the NCAA in scoring and might find his way onto the Panthers' roster earlier than anticipated.Also read: Competitive windows: Florida Panthers and Dallas Stars set the pace as goaltending remains a problem The Florida Panthers have built a championship culture defined by resilience, star power, and adaptability. This season will test all three. Whether it’s a healthy Matthew Tkachuk returning to form, Daniil Tarasov proving himself in the net, or fresh faces making their mark, Florida’s fate will hinge on balancing the grind of history with the hunger for one more Cup.","The Florida Panthers are aiming for a third straight Stanley Cup title.

Kylie Kelce isn’t settling for the sidelines. Married to Philadelphia Eagles legend Jason Kelce, she’s stepping into her own arena—where motherhood meets empowerment, sports meets self-worth, and authenticity meets action. Her “Not Gonna Lie” podcast and advocacy work signal a shift in how women in her position can lead.

Steve Kerr needed more minutes on the court to prove his mettle and gain visibility in the NBA sphere. An unexpected departure of Michael Jordan from basketball in 1993 provided precisely that. Kerr joined the Chicago Bulls via a non-guaranteed deal, and to affirm his position, he needed visibility. With more minutes, Kerr’s performance started showing up and helped him shape his career further. So, according to Kerr, it was ‘good for him’ that Jordan took a break from basketball.Kerr made this interesting revelation on the Glue Guys Podcast. He also took the listeners on a journey of what it was like playing with NBA giants like Scotty Pippen and Bill Cartwright, among others. He shared that these experiences transformed his career.Steve Kerr appeared on the Glue Guys Podcast and talked about his starting years with the Chicago Bulls. Kerr reminisced about the time when he had just started and hoped to share the court with legendary Michael Jordan. But Jordan took a break when Kerr entered the Bulls camp. As per Kerr, it worked in his favor. He called it a personal benefit. Talking about that experience, Kerr said:“Well, when I got there, it was right when Michael decided to go play baseball.So, I was I went there expecting to play with him or at least be on the team with him. I was actually trying out with a non-guaranteed contract, just trying to keep, you know, keep my place in the league.”Kerr needed play time to boost his presence on the team and NBA, and with Jordan not around, he got what he required. He said, “Yeah. So, um, it actually was to my benefit in some ways that he went because it opened up a bunch of playing time. Uh, it was bad for the rest of the Bulls and their fan base, but it was good for me.”Kerr’s performance followed an upward curve in Jordan’s absence. He became an 8-point player from the 5-point one, with play time increased to about 24 minutes per game. The exposure allowed him to play the high-stakes games and taught him to perform well even under pressure.Kerr’s candid confession received laughs from the podcast hosts, and they prodded him further to share his experience as the new player on the Bulls’ team.In the same podcast, Steve Kerr further shared how he amassed career-definingexperience while playing with the NBA biggies. He shared that he understood how easy it becomes to develop a championship-worthy team when the right team is in place. Kerr said:“It was uh, that's kind of where I reestablished my career. It was my fifth year, and I was probably on my way out of the league. But um, you know to to step in there and learn from Phil and play with Scotty Pippen and Horus Grant and Bill Cartwright, these champions, um, changed my whole career.”The Chicago Bulls resurrected when Michael Jordan came back after two years, and the wins started coming in thereafter, per Kerr. Talking about his learnings from playing in the company of great players, Kerr shared:“What I learned was it's a lot easier to develop a role, um, on a great team with great players than on an average team, where everybody's just like kind of confused as to, you know, who's the man and all that stuff.”Kerr shared how the clear hierarchy in Chicago allowed him to pitch in efforts precisely when needed, and it gave him a masterclass on building an impregnable forte, which he indeed applied later as an NBA coach.Also Read: Steve Kerr and Draymond Green share behind-the-scenes Golden State Warriors adopted to bolster defense Steve Kerr’s revelation tells how things fall into place when one is destined to play a bigger role.

""It's crazy just to see John's impact has pretty much reached worldwide,"" she said, touched by such kindness as friends asking wedding guests to donate instead of giving gifts.The John and Matthew Gaudreau Foundation is more than just a memorial; it is a continuation of the generosity of the two brothers and will inspire generations on and off the ice.Also Read: Chad Ruhwedel announces retirement from NHL after a steady 11-year career It is through the mandate of this foundation that Meredith and Madeline Gaudreau ensure that John and Matthew’s love of hockey, generosity, and commitment to aid and uplift fellow human beings will go on changing lives for years to come.","Johnny and Matthew Gaudreau died on August 29, 2024, when an alleged drunk driver ran them over while they were out cycling in New Jersey.

It captured a perfect sibling moment. She shared the IG story four hours before her mother, Lauren, did. Ella’s IG story had a screenshot of a chat.The chat had a snapshot of her fishing excursion where she supposedly caught a tiny freshwater fish named “Tilapia.” There were three bread pieces surrounding the fish and a fishing rod.

Why would they not want to be in control of the stories about their relationships?

A massive campaign involving wide receiver Jadon Sancho is turning into one of the most talked-about stories of the NFL offseason – and it’s not just about money or contracts. Fans of Besiktas, a major team in Türkiye, are doing everything they can online to convince the 25-year-old to make the jump. After reports linked Sancho to the team, fans stormed his Instagram with over 5 million comments, nearly all saying the same thing: “Come to Besiktas.” The post has since gone viral on social media.Nothing has been finalized yet, but the interest is clearly mutual – and fans are making sure their voices are heard. The English media has taken notice as the Instagram campaign has exploded. Several UK media outlets picked up the story after Sancho’s latest post got flooded with millions of comments. Most of them were just one message repeated over and over: a plea for him to join Besiktas. Sancho hasn’t said anything publicly yet about the possible transfer, but the attention around him is growing fast.Besiktas president Serdal Adali gave a direct update about the team’s interest. He made it clear they are serious about going after Sancho – but also realistic about what it would take to make the move happen. “Just as much as the community wants him, I want him too,” Adali said, adding, “What matters is not only our desire, but also if the player wants to come to Türkiye.We have a budget, and we will do our best to bring him here. ”Adali also admitted that it’s not easy to land a player like Sancho, who has played for some of the biggest clubs in Europe and may prefer teams in bigger competitions. “Players like Jadon Sancho usually prefer clubs playing in the Champions League. Whether it happens today or not, it is hard to say. If it is possible, we will get him. Besiktas fans can rest assured.”Jadon Sancho does have other options. He’s been linked with Borussia Dortmund, where he has played before and also with Juventus in Italy. But neither club is moving quickly at the moment. Dortmund is said to be unsure about bringing him back again, and Juventus is focused on selling players before adding anyone new. Another twist came when Chelsea decided not to keep him permanently after a loan spell. They paid a penalty fee instead of making a long-term deal, which put Sancho back on the market.Now, Besiktas sees an opportunity. The club is pushing hard and the fans are doing their part. But the final decision is still up to Jadon himself – and time will tell whether all the noise will lead to a deal.",Manchester United wide receiver Jadon Sancho has been linked with a move to Besiktas.

"NHL Trade Rumors: Montreal Canadiens eye Mason McTavish, but Anaheim Ducks’ asking price for star center is steep",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-rumors-montreal-canadiens-eye-mason-mctavish-but-anaheim-ducks-asking-price-for-star-center-is-steep/articleshow/123244737.cms,"Ric Tapia/GettyImages

Anaheim Ducks set high asking price for Mason McTavish, targeting Canadiens prospect David Reinbacher

Why Mason McTavish could be the perfect addition to the Montreal Canadiens’ roster

Trade chatter is swirling around Anaheim Ducks center Mason McTavish, with the Montreal Canadiens emerging as a frequent link. While Ducks general manager Pat Verbeek has made it clear he wants to keep the 22-year-old, reports indicate he’s open to moving McTavish if the return is right. That return, however, comes with a high price tag, one that could force Montreal into a tough decision.According to multiple reports, including Jimmy Murphy’s, Verbeek would only consider parting with McTavish for a young, right-handed defenseman capable of playing in a top-four role immediately, with the potential to grow into a first-pairing cornerstone and significantly impact the team’s long-term competitiveness while addressing their current defensive depth concerns.Within the Canadiens’ system, that description points directly to David Reinbacher, the fifth overall pick in the 2023 NHL Draft. The 20-year-old is widely viewed as Montreal’s top defense prospect and a key part of their future blue line.The Ducks’ reported request is straightforward, Reinbacher for McTavish — but it’s a steep cost for the Habs, who have been cautious about moving their top young assets.McTavish, 22, stands 6-foot-2, weighs 220 pounds, and plays a strong two-way game.Selected third overall by Anaheim in 2021, he has already compiled 140 points in 229 NHL games, including 60 goals. Last season, he tallied 52 points in 76 games, often in a third-line role and with limited power play time, suggesting even more offensive upside.For Montreal, McTavish would slot perfectly as a second-line center behind Nick Suzuki, giving the team a reliable scoring threat and added size down the middle. His combination of skill, strength, and playoff-style play makes him an appealing target, but surrendering Reinbacher could leave a long-term hole on the right side of their defense.The McTavish-to-Montreal speculation highlights a classic NHL trade dilemma, balancing the allure of an NHL-ready young star against the value of a blue-chip prospect. While McTavish could address an immediate need for the Canadiens, Anaheim’s high asking price ensures this deal, if it ever happens, will require serious consideration from both sides. Until then, the trade rumors are likely to remain a hot topic.Also Read: Rasmus Andersson breaks silence on Calgary Flames trade rumors, contract status, and offseason speculation","Anaheim Ducks set high asking price for Mason McTavish, targeting Canadiens prospect David Reinbacher.

Flyers escape $8M cap hit after winning Ryan Johansen arbitration case in high-profile contract termination dispute,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/flyers-escape-8m-cap-hit-after-winning-ryan-johansen-arbitration-case-in-high-profile-contract-termination-dispute/articleshow/123267614.cms,"The contract dispute between Ryan Johansen and the Philadelphia Flyers has officially been settled (Imagn Images

The events that led to the Flyers cutting ties with Ryan Johansen

Why the ruling matters for the Flyers and the NHL



The long-running contract dispute between Ryan Johansen and the Philadelphia Flyers has officially been settled — and it’s the Flyers who came out on top. According to insider Darren Dreger, an arbitrator ruled in favor of Philadelphia in a grievance filed by the NHLPA after the team terminated Johansen’s contract last summer, citing a “material breach. ”Johansen’s exit from the Flyers was unusual from the start. Philadelphia acquired the veteran center from the Colorado Avalanche at the 2024 trade deadline in exchange for defenseman Sean Walker. Johansen had been active with Colorado right up until the deal, even participating in the Avalanche’s morning skate the same day the trade was finalized.Once in Philadelphia, things quickly soured. The Flyers reportedly had no plans to use Johansen in their NHL lineup and attempted to assign him to their AHL affiliate. However, Johansen claimed he was injured and did not report to the minors. The Flyers apparently believed the injury claim was a way to avoid playing in the AHL, and he never suited up for the organization at any level for the rest of the season.At season’s end, Philadelphia terminated the final year of Johansen’s contract, which was set to pay him $8 million in 2024–25. That salary had been split between the Flyers and the Nashville Predators, who had retained part of his cap hit in an earlier trade to Colorado.The arbitrator’s decision means the Flyers — and Nashville — are both free from the cap obligations tied to Johansen’s deal. It also sets a precedent for how NHL teams might handle situations where they believe a player has violated contract terms.For Johansen, the ruling is a major setback in a career that once saw him as one of the league’s top centers. The 13-year veteran and 2014–15 NHL All-Star has amassed 202 goals and 578 points in 905 games, but recent seasons have been marked by declining production and off-ice complications.Also Read: NHL Trade Rumors: Edmonton Oilers are considering bold goalie trade involving Detroit’s prized prospect Sebastian Cossa While the Flyers can now move forward without financial repercussions, Johansen faces an uncertain future in the league — and his next step could determine whether his NHL career continues at all.","The long-running contract dispute between Ryan Johansen and the Philadelphia Flyers has officially been settled.

From Kanata to downtown: Michael Andlauer ’s Ottawa Senators plan move to LeBreton Flats

Brady Tkachuk, Michael Andlauer and city leaders rally behind Ottawa Senators’ downtown arena vision

After seven long seasons without playoff hockey, the Ottawa Senators finally punched their ticket to the NHL postseason this year — and for captain Brady Tkachuk, it was a milestone that had been a long time coming. Since joining Ottawa, Tkachuk had played six full seasons without a single playoff appearance, while his brother Matthew lifted the Stanley Cup. This year changed that story. Under new ownership and first-year head coach Travis Green, the team not only broke its playoff drought but also took a major step toward changing its home ice. The Senators are set to move from their long-time suburban home in Kanata to a new downtown arena at LeBreton Flats, a shift fans believe will redefine both the team and the city.Earlier this week, the National Capital Commission (NCC) and Capital Sports Development Inc. (CSDI) approved the purchase and sale of 11 acres at LeBreton Flats to the Ottawa Senators . The team has played at the Canadian Tire Centre in Kanata since 1996, but the arena’s location — roughly 25 kilometers from downtown — has long been criticized.“It had to be done. Transportation to the Canadian Tire Center is abysmal. You build an arena in a good part of downtown Ottawa, and you’ll get fans,” one supporter wrote online.Another fan called the move “Great news for my hometown. Common sense prevails.”The new site sits beside the Ottawa River and within walking distance of Parliament Hill, addressing long-standing transportation complaints. Even fans who liked the Kanata arena see the change as positive. “I enjoyed being at that arena, but it was pretty far from everything else, and Ottawa has a beautiful downtown and shops to explore,” one hockey fan shared.In a statement on Monday, Senators President and CEO Cyril Leeder said, “We are pleased to reach an agreement of purchase and sale with the NCC to take the next step in this process. There are still many more hurdles to clear, and we look forward to working with the NCC and other stakeholders to achieve our shared vision.”NCC CEO Tobi Nussbaum echoed the excitement, noting the facility would “inject new energy and excitement into the core of the nation’s capital and further catalyze the development of LeBreton Flats” while also providing “a lively and convenient attraction for residents and visitors.”Fans agree. “This ownership group keeps hitting the mark,” one said after the team’s most successful season in seven years. Another added, “This is going to be such an improvement! It will take time, but so happy to see this progress!” TSN columnist Bruce Garrioch has reported it will take another five to six years before the Senators can take the ice in the new venue.The Ottawa Senators have pursued the LeBreton Flats project since 2019, but it stalled after a fallout between former owner Eugene Melnyk and business partner John Ruddy. Now, two years into Michael Andlauer’s ownership, the deal has grown from the original 5.8-acre site to 11 acres. Coming off their first playoff berth in seven years, Ottawa’s momentum is carrying from the ice to the city’s core — and fans are already imagining the roar of the crowd in their future downtown home.Also Read: Ilya Solovyov, Yan Kuznetsov, and Jeremie Poirier: Are these the next big names on the Calgary Flames’ blue line in 2025-26?","The Ottawa Senators are set to move from their long-time suburban home in Kanata to a new downtown arena at LeBreton Flats.

Contrast With Mikal Bridges’ Extension

Possible Reasons Behind the New York Knicks’ Decision

Theare heading into the 2025-26 NBA season with high expectations after making the Eastern Conference Finals last year. However, the team’s recent contract stance onhas made him the talk of the hour with a major trade could be on the horizon.Despite Towns’ strong first season in New York, the New York Knicks have decided against offering the 5-time All-Star a new contract extension this offseason. According to FanSided’s Josh Cornelissen, this decision is intentional.“The New York Knicks have not offered Karl-Anthony Towns a new contract extension,” Cornelissen wrote Tuesday. “The reason why? They want to be able to trade their star big man at any time.”This approach signals that the front office is keeping its options open for a potential roster shake-up, even as the franchise positions itself for a championship run.In his debut season with the Knicks, Karl-Anthony Towns delivered some of the best numbers of his career, showing both scoring efficiency and dominance on the glass.These stats reflect a highly productive year, making the decision not to extend him even more surprising to fans.While Towns awaits clarity on his long-term future, teammate Mikal Bridges secured a major commitment from the organization. On July 31, Bridges signed a 4-year, $150 million extension, locking him in as part of the Knicks’ core for the foreseeable future.This contrast raises questions about where Towns fits into the team’s long-term plans.Several factors could explain New York’s hesitation to commit to Towns right now:• Salary Cap Flexibility: Towns’ current deal already carries a massive financial commitment, and extending him could limit future roster moves.• Trade Leverage: Without a new extension, the Knicks can move Towns without worrying about potential trade restrictions.• Roster Construction: The front office may be exploring different combinations to maximize their championship window.• Recent History: The Knicks have been active in blockbuster trades in recent years and may keep Towns as a key trade chip.Also read: NBA Trade News: Denver Nuggets Sign $578,577 Dallas Mavericks Rookie to Bolster Wing Depth and Improve Championship Odds While trading Karl-Anthony Towns remains unlikely in the immediate future, the Knicks’ history suggests they won’t hesitate if the right opportunity arises. For now, Towns will look to build on his impressive first season in New York, but the lack of an extension keeps his long-term status with the franchise in question.","The New York Knicks have decided not to offer Karl-Anthony Towns a contract extension.

What This Means for the Lakers

Thehave emerged as a possible landing spot for, a key bench shooter from the 2024 championship roster, according to Zach Kram of ESPN.With Boston president and general manager Brad Stevens dismantling core parts of the team’s recent title-winning lineup to cut costs, multiple players - even role players like Hauser - could be available for trade. The Los Angeles Lakers, now featuring All-Star guard Luka Doncic , may see Hauser as a seamless fit given Doncic’s effectiveness alongside elite three-point shooters.Stevens’ roster shake-up has been swift and calculated, aimed at avoiding the league’s harsh luxury tax penalties - especially the repeater tax - in a transitional season without injured All-Star Jayson Tatum.• Kristaps Porzingis to Atlanta Hawks in a three-team deal with Brooklyn Nets• Boston received: Future second-round pick, Georges Niang• Later flipped Niang and two future second-rounders to Utah Jazz for rookie RJ Luis Jr. and an $8 million trade exception• Jrue Holiday to Portland Trail Blazers for Anfernee Simons• Simons brings scoring talent but questionable defensive fit• Waived point guard JD Davison, officially moving Boston below the second tax apronKram’s analysis points to Sam Hauser’s profile as exactly what the Los Angeles Lakers could use.Luka Doncic’s game thrives with reliable floor spacers, particularly those deadly from the corners.“The current supply of shooting in the NBA is so great that the skill set is generally available for cheap,” Kram said in his ESPN piece, noting players like Luke Kennard, Grayson Allen, and Hauser as attainable options. (H/t: Sporting News)The Los Angeles Lakers, already retooled with Doncic in the backcourt, may not need a high-usage scorer but could greatly benefit from a proven marksman who spaces the floor. Sam Hauser, who shot over 41% from deep in the regular season, fits that role perfectly and would likely come at a reasonable trade cost.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers Reportedly Could Sign $121 Million Golden State Warriors Superstar; LeBron James Key Trade Asset?

Antonio Brown’s history of polarizing behavior overshadows preseason buzz



Former NFL wide receiver Antonio Brown has stirred fresh controversy after publicly targeting one of the Minnesota Vikings’ newly appointed male cheerleaders. The incident comes at a time when the team’s decision to add male performers to its cheer squad has already divided fans, sparking discussions about tradition, inclusivity, and the evolving culture of the NFL.The Vikings recently confirmed that Blaize Shiek and Louie Conn would join their cheerleading roster for the 2025 season. The decision was presented as a step toward gender equality and representation within the organization, aligning with a growing trend of NFL teams adopting co-ed cheer squads.While many supporters applauded the move as progressive, others pushed back, arguing it clashed with long-standing game-day traditions. Some season ticket holders reportedly went as far as threatening to cancel their memberships over the change. This divide existed well before Antonio Brown’s remarks but has now been amplified by the former wideout’s public criticism, in which he tweeted, “F*ggot of the Day” alongside a video of Shiek.Brown, who enjoyed a 12-season NFL career and a Super Bowl victory, has built a reputation for courting controversy both during and after his playing days.His latest jab comes just as the Vikings have kicked off their preseason with a 20-10 win over the Houston Texans.

Brock Purdy’s whirlwind year just got even sweeter. At the end of July, the San Francisco 49ers quarterback and his wife, Jenna Purdy, announced the arrival of their first child - a daughter named Millie Joleen Purdy. “Life just became a whole lot sweeter,” they wrote. The couple had kept Jenna’s pregnancy a closely guarded secret, surprising fans and friends alike with the joyful news.For Brock Purdy, the timing couldn’t be more special. With the NFL season on the horizon, the 25-year-old had an extra supporter in the stands - baby Millie made her training camp debut, sharing an adorable moment with her father on the field.This has already been a landmark offseason for the young quarterback. In May, Purdy signed a five-year, $265 million contract extension - a staggering leap for the player once dubbed “Mr. Irrelevant” as the last pick in the 2022 NFL Draft. That deal not only secured his place in San Francisco’s future but also allowed the couple to purchase a new offseason home in Nashville, Tennessee, close to Purdy’s close friend and teammate, George Kittle.Now, Jenna Purdy has shared some beautiful memory from their pregnancy period, giving a sweet caption,"" Our little secret🤍""The love story began at Iowa State University, where Purdy starred on the football field and Jenna - then Jenna Brandt - shined as a setter on the volleyball team.She later transferred to the University of Northern Iowa, but the bond between them grew stronger.

A natural athlete, she captained her high school volleyball team twice, competed in track and field, and played club volleyball before committing to Iowa State.Her support for Purdy has been unwavering - from the early days when he was battling to prove himself, to his breakout moment when he led the 49ers to the 2024 Super Bowl. She stood proudly on the field after the NFC Championship win, captioning her celebration with Purdy, “The BEST feeling. God is good - all the time.”Though the Niners fell to the Kansas City Chiefs in a heart-pounding overtime finale, Jenna’s presence at every milestone underscored her role as Purdy’s biggest fan.

Connor McDavid’s contract talks heat up as Oilers push to secure their captain’s future

Connor McDavid's career is at a crossroads



Months of speculation and quiet whispers in NHL circles may finally give way to answers. Connor McDavid , the face of the Edmonton Oilers and one of the league’s most electrifying talents, could be on the verge of committing his future to Edmonton. The uncertainty surrounding his next move has kept front offices, fans, and analysts on edge, but signs now point toward the captain staying put, at least for the foreseeable future.From the start, the Oilers’ position was crystal clear—McDavid leaving was never part of the equation. Whether the team lifted the Stanley Cup or endured another heartbreak, their cornerstone wasn’t going anywhere. Even falling short in the Stanley Cup Final, while painful, didn’t alter the franchise’s long-term vision. As the saying goes, if the ship sinks, the captain must go down with it—but Edmonton isn’t ready to abandon this voyage.While McDavid has not formally resumed contract discussions since the 2024–25 season ended, multiple reports suggest both sides are aligned on key priorities. Yet one pivotal question remains unresolved—just how long McDavid’s next deal will be. “McDavid’s extension could be anywhere from a two-year to an eight-year deal.I don’t think that they’ve ruled out eight,” insider Frank Seravalli revealed.The 2025 offseason presents a rare wrinkle in NHL contract negotiations. With the new CBA about to take effect, this is the final year players can sign deals as long as eight years. Seravalli noted, “I don’t know that he’s terribly incentivized to do so… Four years might be the sweet spot here.” The decision, he added, could hinge on how many more legitimate shots this Oilers core has at claiming that elusive Stanley Cup.Now 712 games into his career, McDavid’s numbers are staggering—1,059 points, 358 goals, 701 assists, and a +150 rating. His statistical dominance even outpaces Sidney Crosby’s first 700 NHL games, though Crosby’s early playoff triumphs still give him the edge in historical debates.For McDavid, the conversation isn’t about whether he’ll be remembered as one of the greats—it’s about when he’ll finally hoist hockey’s ultimate prize. The Oilers know securing their captain isn’t just a contract move; it’s a statement of intent.Also Read: Connor McDavid could follow Wayne Gretzky’s path as trade proposal reignites talk of a historic NHL shake-up","Connor McDavid's contract talks heat up as Oilers push to secure their captain’s future.

Poll Do you think hosting an MMA event at the White House is appropriate? Yes, it's a unique celebration. No, it's not suitable for the White House.

The White House is set to host a mixed martial arts (MMA) event on July 4 next year, coinciding with the 250th anniversary of the United States’ founding, UFC president Dana White confirmed on Tuesday.“It is definitely going to happen. I talked to him last night — ‘him’ being the president — and I’m flying out there at the end of this month. I’m going to sit down and walk him through all the plans and the renderings, and we’re going to start deciding what he wants and doesn’t want,” White told CBS, as quoted by AFP.This will be the first time the combat sport, known for its intense and often bloody contests, will be staged at the heart of US political power. UFC bouts take place inside an eight-sided cage, “The Octagon,” where fighters use a range of techniques from various martial arts disciplines including boxing, kickboxing, wrestling, and jiu-jitsu.White, a long-time supporter of the president, revealed that the president’s daughter, Ivanka Trump, will also be involved in planning the Independence Day spectacle. “When (Trump) called me and asked me to do it, he said: ‘I want Ivanka in the middle of this,’” White said.The UFC has grown into the largest MMA organization in the world under White’s leadership since he took over in 2001. Known for its no-holds-barred nature, with only a few prohibited moves, the sport has drawn both widespread popularity and controversy. Critics, including medical professionals, have expressed concern over the potential for brain injuries due to repeated head strikes, even as MMA gains greater mainstream acceptance.President Trump has attended major UFC events in the past, often receiving star-like reception from fans. Bringing the sport to the White House on such a symbolic date is expected to draw significant attention both for its novelty and its political undertones.",The White House is set to host a mixed martial arts (MMA) event on July 4 next year.

Chad Ruhwedel’s last year and retirement

In a huge, heartfelt decision, former Penguins defenseman Chad Ruhwedel has officially hung up his skates after that immense NHL journey. From an undrafted player in the league, Ruhwedel was that dependable presence on the blue line. The marriage of hard work, muted consistency, and the occasional big-team-first move has come to define his career. Through more than a dozen years of sharpening and fitting in, Ruhwedel proved that grit and integrity could mean something in cracking down a lasting berth in the world's premier hockey league.Chad Ruhwedel's NHL story started in Buffalo, with the Sabres being the ones to give him his break and to allow him significant early experience. Once Ruhwedel spent four years in Buffalo, he found his longest tenure in Pittsburgh: seven more years with the Penguins.Lifting the Stanley Cup during the 2016–17 season remains a highlight of Ruhwedel's career as he stepped up when needed during 34 regular-season games and six playoff games. With those hands, he fostered back-to-back championships in an era for the Penguins.With 12 goals and 49 points in his 369-game career, the cards seem to read Ruhwedel never really scoring goals.He possesses significant value in being the steadfast, mistake-free defenseman placed by his coaches at crucial moments throughout a game.Calm, composed, and reliable in defensive coverage, he would often be that elusive sixth- or even seventh-defenseman position task truly underrated in the hockey world. It would come down to his ability to stay prepared even with the smallest ice time and become an option of choice among playoff aspirants.After the 2024 trade deadline of the NHL, Ruhwedel's last season was rounded off with a trade to the New York Rangers. Appearing in only five NHL contests in the season, Ruhwedel never lost his professionalism while between NHL showings, assisting the Hartford Wolf Pack in the AHL.Retiring on a Tuesday, Ruhwedel leaves with a telling tale of grit and contemplative mastery, underlining that fame is not the only way to create a shining career.Also Read: Marc-André Fleury’s wife Véronique Laroseé-Fleury hosts a star-studded retirement celebration Chad Ruhwedel, through his retirement, closes a chapter on an NHL journey of fortitude, determination, and commitment to the team.

How Taylor Swift’s 12:12 AM reveal hijacked the sports world

NHL teams go all-in: Glittered jerseys, secret clues, and playful Swiftie tributes

Beyond Music: Why this Swift reveal became a sports-culture gamechanger

T aylor Swift’s midnight reveal of The Life of a Showgirl didn’t just launch a new album—it triggered a sports-wide celebration that turned hockey rinks into pop-culture stages. From creative jersey edits to playful name parodies, NHL teams embraced the announcement with a burst of color, sparkle, and Swiftie-coded clues, proving once again how the superstar’s moves ripple far beyond music charts.At precisely 12:12 a.m. ET on August 12, Swift unveiled her twelfth studio album title on New Heights, the popular podcast hosted by NFL stars Travis and Jason Kelce. The reveal featured a mint-green briefcase and a countdown on her official site, which pulsed in orange and mint—a nod fans quickly linked to the album’s dance-pop aesthetic. Notably absent from the track credits was long-time collaborator Jack Antonoff, while pop hitmakers Max Martin and Shellback are rumored to be on board. The choice to break the news on a sports platform instantly blurred the lines between stadiums and stages.Within hours, NHL franchises were staging their own mini-rollouts. The Calgary Flames resurfaced Jarome Iginla’s famous No. 12 jersey in glitter, perfectly echoing the album’s symbolic number and shimmer.The Florida Panthers went full detective, zooming in on a Cartier Panthère pendant spotted in Swift’s teaser images, hinting it was “meant for them.” The Columbus Blue Jackets mocked up an orange-splashed fake album cover, while the Minnesota Wild gave center stage to winger Matt Boldy—another No. 12 standout. Even the Philadelphia Flyers and New Jersey Devils got playful, renaming players as honorary “showgirls” in tongue-in-cheek social posts.This wasn’t simply a music reveal—it was a cultural crossover event. By choosing a sports talk show for the announcement, Swift tapped directly into the fast-moving world of fan communities that thrive on shared moments. WNBA rookie Caitlin Clark erupted on social media within minutes, typing in all caps to capture her excitement. NFL fan accounts chimed in, calling it “the most Swiftie touchdown yet,” while even casual followers got pulled in, decoding orange lighting on the Empire State Building and counting the 12 glittery graphics posted on her website.Swift’s strategy shows a deep understanding of today’s fandom—where the real magic happens at the intersection of music, sports, and social media storytelling. By uniting the NHL, NFL, and pop music worlds in a single rollout, she didn’t just announce an album; she built a shared cultural memory. As one NHL social media manager noted, the buzz “felt like game day, only shinier.”The Life of a Showgirl is set for release later this year, but its first wave has already proven its power—turning an ordinary Monday into a league-wide spectacle and giving sports fans a reason to sing along before the puck even drops.Also read: Taylor Swift and Sabrina Carpenter’s surprise collab sparks NFL fans’ frenzy ahead of ‘The Life of a Showgirl’ release","Taylor Swift’s midnight reveal of The Life of a Showgirl triggered a sports-wide celebration.

Poll Should players be compared to legends like Virat Kohli? Yes, it motivates them No, it adds unnecessary pressure

Former Pakistan batter Ahmed Shehzad has come out strongly against the trend of comparing players, particularly Babar Azam , with modern-day great Virat Kohli . Speaking in an interview, Shehzad said that such comparisons are not only unfair but also add unnecessary pressure on players, which is visible in Babar’s current struggles.“When everything was going well, you were running campaigns comparing players. Now that the performances are not coming, you are saying ‘don’t compare two players’. Why not? Virat Kohli ’s comparison cannot be made with anyone in the world. He is a legend of this generation, a role model. You cannot compare him even with MS Dhoni . Dhoni may have been a great captain, but as a batter, cricketer, and athlete, Kohli stands alone. No one should be compared with anyone because it’s unfair and it adds extra pressure, which we are now seeing on Babar Azam,” Shehzad said.Babar’s dip in form has been a talking point for months. He has now gone 72 consecutive international innings without scoring a century, with his last hundred coming against Nepal. Since 2023, no other cricketer has endured a longer drought without a century.Adding to that, since 2024, Babar and Mohammad Rizwan are the only two batters from full-member nations with a strike rate below 80.The struggles have coincided with a change in leadership. Babar is no longer Pakistan’s captain across formats, having stepped down earlier this year following criticism over results and his own performances. The recent ODI series against West Indies only intensified the scrutiny, as Pakistan suffered a 202-run loss to concede their first bilateral ODI series to the Caribbean side in 34 years.Shehzad’s remarks highlight the pressure top players face when placed on the same pedestal as legends, and why the weight of public comparisons can often prove damaging to form and confidence.","Former Pakistan batter Ahmed Shehzad has come out strongly against the trend of comparing players, particularly Babar Azam, with modern-day great Virat Kohli.
