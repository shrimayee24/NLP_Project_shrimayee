'Jhukta wahi hai …': TMC MP Abhishek Banerjee’s ‘Kumbh’ retort to chaos at Messi’s Kolkata event; takes dig at BJP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jhukta-wahi-hai-tmc-mp-abhishek-banerjees-kumbh-retort-to-chaos-at-messis-kolkata-event-takes-dig-at-bjp/articleshow/126030437.cms,"From Kolkata Chaos to Delhi Celebration: Lionel Messi’s G.O.A.T India Tour At A Glance

NEW DELHI: Trinamool Congress MP Abhishek Banerjee on Tuesday defended the West Bengal government’s actions after chaos erupted during football legend Lionel Messi’s appearance at the Salt Lake Stadium in Kolkata.Banerjee said West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee apologised within an hour of the incident, while other state governments had not owned responsibility for incidents such as the Kumbh stampede and the New Delhi railway station stampede.“In states ruled by the BJP, so many people died during the Kumbh. So many people died in the stampede at New Delhi railway station — did you question them about that? Did you question Yogi Adityanath? What happened in Bengal — the chief minister apologised within one hour,” the TMC said.“Jhukta wahi hai jisme jaan hai. Akad to murdon ki pehchaan hai (Only those who have life in them bow; rigidity is the mark of the dead). We have bowed before the people. Action is being taken against everyone against whom there are allegations. That is why the BJP loses, and the Trinamool defeats them,” he added.Messi’s Kolkata appearance, the first stop of the GOAT Tour 2025, ended in chaos. What was meant to be a celebration of the World Cup-winning superstar in a football-loving state turned chaotic as VIPs and politicians on the pitch sparked fan frustration, with many attendees claiming they could barely see the footballer they had paid to watch.Angry fans resorted to vandalism at the stadium, alleging poor event management and criticising VIPs and politicians for hogging the football icon’s attention and time, to the extent that many fans did not even get a glimpse of Messi.Meanwhile, sports minister Aroop Biswas also resigned from his post on Tuesday following the chaos during Messi’s GOAT India Tour in Kolkata. The chief minister accepted his resignation.The state government also informed that a Special Investigation Team comprising IPS officers Piyush Pandey, Javed Shamim, Supratim Sarkar and Muralidhar has been constituted to conduct a thorough probe into the matter.The government has already served a notice to Director General of Police Rajeev Kumar, ordering him to clarify within 24 hours why such mismanagement and lapses occurred at the stadium and why proper coordination with concerned stakeholders, including the private organiser, was not carried out to ensure the smooth conduct of the event.","Messi’s Kolkata appearance, the first stop of the GOAT Tour 2025, ended in chaos.

Saros protagonist and story



Saros gameplay



The next major title from Housemarque, titled Saros, has received a new trailer, and the game is all set to be one of the finest releases of 2026. The title is said to be a spiritual successor to Returnal, a roguelike released by the Finnish studio in 2021.Saros was first revealed during a February State of Play, and it is set to evolve Returnal’s third-person roguelite formula with a new setting, characters, and a progression system. With the release date now set, it will be exciting to see how well the game performs.The following section takes a deeper look at the release date and other details of Saros.The release date for Saros is March 20, 2026, as previously confirmed by the developers at Housemarque.The game is set to be a PlayStation 5 exclusive at launch, and you will only be able to enjoy the game on the particular platform.However, given that previous PlayStation exclusives, including Returnal, have eventually been ported to PC, there is a chance that Saros will later be made available. If the same turns out to be true, Saros will likely arrive on PC in 2027/2028.The story places you in the role of Arjun Devraj, who is a Soltari Enforcer on a mission to find someone important. Devraj is essentially portrayed by the recognizable actor Rahul Kohli , who is better known for his roles in iZombie and Midnight Mass.Speaking of Saros’ setting, it is going to take place in Carcosa, which is a lost off-world colony haunted by an ominous eclipse. The world is littered with Soltari ruins and grotesque enemies, with some inspired by Hindu mythology.Saros will be maintaining the third-person action style of Returnal, but it will be introducing a key refinement to the roguelite element of the game. Essentially, Devraj will be retaining permanent upgrades and resources after dying. This will ensure that you make meaningful progress in the game, and also return stronger even after failing.In addition, the gameplay trailer showcased a variety of combat abilities, one of which is a Soltari shield. It will block enemy attacks and also absorb enemy projectiles to charge explosive bursts from Devraj's power weapon.You can also find Soltari holologs, which are the data caches across the landscape, helping you piece together the history of Carcosa. With the game's release set for March 2026, anticipation is high for the title.","Saros was first revealed during a February State of Play.

Former Indian cricket star Virat Kohli and his wife Anushka Sharma made their third visit this year to Premanand Ji Maharaj at Shri Hit Radha Keli Kunj Ashram in Vrindavan, where they engaged in a spiritual conversation with the religious leader after returning from the United Kingdom last week.The spiritual interaction was captured in a video shared by Bhajan Marg's Official Instagram handle, showing the couple seeking guidance from Premanand Ji Maharaj.""Apne karyakshetra ko bhagwan ka seva smajhiye.

Shawn Michaels’ career earnings and WWE income streams

Rebecca Curci Hickenbottom’s career and shared assets

Both Shawn Michaels and Rebecca Curci Hickenbottom have kept their respective finances private for a long time, so finding an estimated total net worth for the couple is an exercise in educated guesswork rather than exact calculation. However, by looking at the thousands of matches in Michaels' wrestling career and Curci's limited exposure to the world of professional entertainment, a general financial outline can be formed.Despite this, Shawn Michaels' net worth is estimated to be about $10 million in 2025, according to widely cited estimates, and his wife Rebecca Curci is believed to have a personal net worth of under $1 million. Their combined vermögen is generally placed in the $10.5 million to $11 million range together.That number is mostly driven by Michaels' earnings, brand value, and ongoing role in WWE.Michael Shawn Hickenbottom, known to the world as Shawn Michaels, amassed most of his wealth way back in the prime days of his in-ring career for WWE. Michaels was one of the company's most bankable stars of the mid-90s through the 2000s, and as such enjoyed the benefits of main-event contracts, pay-per-view bonuses, and merchandise royalties on his ""Heartbreak Kid"" character.Many of his contemporaries have become high-level corporate executives post their full-time competitive careers, but Michaels made the transition seamlessly. He has been Vice President and Senior Vice President, focused on various elements of WWE's NXT brand over the past several years. The executive role gives him a steady annual salary that is supplemented by his residual income from licensing, appearances, and long-term merchandising contracts. Specific salary numbers are impossible to trace, though industry watchers see his WWE office role as a major, steady revenue stream in any event.Rebecca Curci Hickenbottom was in the spotlight for a relatively brief period. In the late 1990s, she found fame as “Whisper,” one of the Nitro Girls dance troupe of WCW. Curci dated Michaels after her WCW run (they wed in '99) and then eased out of the public eye, preferring life as a wife and mother to a long-term TV or business profile.As a result, estimates of her personal wealth range widely and tend to be modest. Following her time in WCW, there is little public record of large independent business ventures or entertainment earnings.Also Read: Shawn Michaels calls Fraxiom WWE’s best tag team right now",Shawn Michaels' net worth is estimated to be about $10 million in 2025.

NEW DELHI: Sri Lankan authorities plan to arrest the country's former men's cricket team captain, Arjuna Ranatunga , on corruption charges linked to his tenure as petroleum minister, a court was told on Monday.The 1996 World Cup-winning cricketer Ranatunga and his brother are accused of altering the procedure for awarding long-term oil procurement contracts and instead making spot purchases at higher prices, according to a corruption watchdog.""The total loss to the state from 27 purchases is 800 million rupees,"" the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption told the court, as reported by news agency AFP.The amount was equivalent to just over $5 million at the time the deals were made in 2017.The commission told Colombo Magistrate Asanga Bodaragama that Arjuna Ranatunga was currently abroad and would be arrested upon his return.His elder brother, Dhammika Ranatunga, who was chairman of the state-run Ceylon Petroleum Corporation at the time, was arrested on Monday and later released on bail.The magistrate imposed a travel ban on Dhammika, who holds dual citizenship of Sri Lanka and the United States.The next hearing in the case is scheduled for March 13.Arjuna Ranatunga, 62, captained Sri Lanka to victory in the 1996 Cricket World Cup, defeating Australia in the final.The case involving the Ranatunga brothers is part of a broader crackdown by the government of Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who came to power last year after pledging to act against corruption.Another brother, Prasanna Ranatunga, a former tourism minister, was arrested last month in connection with an insurance fraud case. That matter is pending.Prasanna Ranatunga had earlier been convicted in June 2022 for extorting money from a businessman and is currently serving a two-year suspended prison sentence.","Arjuna Ranatunga, 62, captained Sri Lanka to victory in the 1996 Cricket World Cup.

Coming in at a base price of Rs 2 crore, Pathirana became the costliest Sri Lankan player ever sold at an IPL auction.Under existing IPL rules, Green will receive Rs 18 crore for the season, with the remaining amount going towards the BCCI’s player development programme, while Pathirana will pocket his full amount as it falls within the salary cap.KKR managing director Venky Mysore expressed satisfaction with the franchise’s marquee signing. “We are very happy. Something that we were focussed on and hoping. Quite happy with price at which we got him. Would have been a concern if it had gone higher. We were keen and attached but had it affected our rest of auction, we would have let him go,” Mysore said at a press conference.“He will add lot to our team and with our new power coach Andre Russell, we know what he does, with bat and ball, couldn't be happier.“The rule the BCCI made on the Rs 18 crore, our standpoint is there is no concern, in any case it's an outflow for franchise,” he added.Green, who has previously represented Mumbai Indians and Royal Challengers Bengaluru, has featured in 29 IPL matches, scoring 707 runs and taking 16 wickets. Reacting to his move, Green said, “I'm so excited to be part of Kolkata for this year's IPL. To get down to the Eden Gardens, to get used to the atmosphere. I hope it is a great year for us. So see you soon. Ami KKR!”Elsewhere, Bangladesh left-arm pacer Mustafizur Rahman was bought by KKR for Rs 9.20 crore, while uncapped Madhya Pradesh fast bowler Mangesh Yadav joined Royal Challengers Bengaluru for Rs 5.20 crore after a bidding war with Sunrisers Hyderabad.Sunrisers Hyderabad also spent big, paying Rs 13 crore for England batter Liam Livingstone, while Lucknow Super Giants secured Australian wicketkeeper-batter Josh Inglis for Rs 8.60 crore. Punjab Kings made their first purchase of the day by signing Australia’s Cooper Connolly for Rs 3 crore, and Australian all-rounder Jack Edwards was picked up by Sunrisers Hyderabad for the same amount.In the accelerated round, New Zealand’s Tom Banton went to Gujarat Titans for Rs 2 crore, while Adam Milne was snapped up by Rajasthan Royals for Rs 2.40 crore. South African batter David Miller returned to Delhi Capitals for his base price of Rs 2 crore, though New Zealand opener Devon Conway remained unsold.Quinton de Kock rejoined Mumbai Indians at his base price of Rs 1 crore. Spencer Johnson went unsold, while Anrich Nortje was signed by Lucknow Super Giants for Rs 2 crore. South African pacer Lungi Ngidi was also picked up by Delhi Capitals for his base price of Rs 2 crore.The mini auction featured a pool of 359 players — 246 Indians and 113 overseas — with the 10 franchises competing to fill up to 77 slots, including 31 reserved for overseas players.",Cameron Green becomes most expensive overseas player in IPL auction history.

MLB trade rumor: Arizona Diamondbacks show interest in Alex Bregman to fill void left by Eugenio Suárez trade,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/mlb-trade-rumor-arizona-diamondbacks-show-interest-in-alex-bregman-to-fill-void-left-by-eugenio-surez-trade/articleshow/126028410.cms,"(Image Source - Getty Images)

Arizona Diamondbacks explore financial flexibility tied to potential Ketel Marte trade

Ketel Marte trade talks shape Arizona Diamondbacks interest in Alex Bregman and long term infield plans

Diamondbacks rotation takes shape with Merrill Kelly joining Eduardo Rodriguez

Alex Bregman has been a hot topic this offseason, but on December 16, something unexpected happened. A seasoned MLB insider disclosed that the Arizona Diamondbacks are taking notice, which quickly altered the dynamics of the free agency market. At first, it seemed a bit puzzling. Arizona has young players already and a star second baseman locked in. However, if you take a deeper look, the scenario changes.Trade talks are getting intense, financial options are being considered, and the infield might change quite a bit soon. Across the league, executives and reporters are picking up on the subtle hints, suggesting that this interest is more serious than it seems.With past relationships, competing bidders, and strategic roster changes all in the mix, Bregman’s market could be on the verge of one of the most surprising developments of the offseason.The excitement surrounding Bregman and Arizona grew on December 16, 2025, when Jon Heyman from the New York Post tweeted that the Diamondbacks ""are interested"" in the 31-year-old infielder, who is among the best free agents on the market this winter.Heyman, an experienced MLB insider, posted this news on X, highlighting it as a fresh development in Bregman's free agency.Following up on Heyman's report, Bob Nightengale from USA Today took to X to call Arizona a ""surprise entrant in the Alex Bregman sweepstakes"" and stating the team is ""kicking the tires"" on a potential signing. Nightengale elaborated to his followers, ""The Dbacks would certainly have the financial flexibility if they move 2B Ketel Marte and could move 3B Jordan Lawlar to 2B.""Bregman's ability to play different positions makes him a fascinating option, especially since he could take over at third base while Lawlar moves to second, particularly if Arizona trades All-Star Ketel Marte.CBS Sports' shared similar thoughts in a roundup on December 16, mentioning that the Diamondbacks are ""kicking the tires"" on Bregman. He pointed out the necessary infield adjustments but considered them manageable.NESN's Keagan Stiefel brought attention to the unexpected twist, stating that Arizona's interest makes them fresh contenders for Bregman, especially against his old team, the Boston Red Sox.Arizona's interest in Bregman is closely linked to the current talks about trading second baseman Ketel Marte, who has a six-year, $116.5 million contract that runs through 2030, with $41 million of that being deferred.According to MLB.com, the Red Sox are leading the race to land Marte, while the Blue Jays and Mariners are also in the mix. Marte, who was the 2023 NLCS MVP and a three-time All-Star, has the ability to block trades to five teams: the Athletics, Yankees, Pirates, Giants, and Cardinals.The Athletic pointed out that Arizona wants a ""superstar-type return"" for Marte, even though some of his teammates had complaints about him last season, according to the Arizona Republic.Rob Bradford from WEEI tweeted that a source mentioned the talks between the Red Sox and Diamondbacks were ""nothing close,"" even though there was some earlier momentum that seemed to favor Boston.NESN's report hinted that interest in Bregman could speed up discussions about Marte, possibly leading to a ""quasi-swap"" where Boston trades Bregman to Arizona as part of a larger deal.Diamondbacks GM Mike Hazen has said he doesn't ""feel as if he has to trade Marte,"" per MLB.com, but the move could free up $17.25 million annually and allow Lawlar's promotion.To back any infield splash, Arizona has strengthened its pitching lineup. On December 10, the team brought on right-hander Michael Soroka with a one-year contract worth $7.5 million, including a mutual option and performance bonuses that could reach $9.5 million, according to MLB.com sources. Soroka described it as a ""dream scenario"" during a post-signing chat, thrilled about pitching year-round in his home state.A few days later, on December 14, the Diamondbacks struck a two-year, $40 million deal with free-agent right-hander Merrill Kelly bringing him back to the team after trading him midseason pending a physical.Kelly, who had a 4.23 ERA in 10 starts with Texas after the trade, will join Eduardo Rodriguez, Brandon Pfaadt, and Ryne Nelson in the rotation. These moves show Arizona's aim to compete in 2026, possibly combining Bregman's hitting with a solidified pitching staff.Also Read: Bryse Wilson joins the Philadelphia Phillies after the struggles with the Chicago White Sox and limited success",The Arizona Diamondbacks are reportedly interested in signing free agent Alex Bregman.

Stephen Curry faces harsh public advice after viral 6ix9ine remark

Ayesha Curry faced long-running online scrutiny over the years



Stephen Curry has built a public life on discipline. The same values often define how fans view his marriage to Ayesha Curry . The partnership of the duo has played out under an intense spotlight for over a decade. That spotlight grew harsher this week after a reckless comment from rapper 6ix9ine reignited online gossip and dragged the Warriors superstar into a conversation he never invited.The said controversy began as a livestream question and quickly went viral, further extended by reactions and amplified opinions. While neither Stephen nor Ayesha Curry initiated the moment, the fallout once again tested how public figures absorb noise without responding to it.This time, the commentary went beyond trolling and crossed into personal judgment.During a livestream with YouTubers Adin Ross and N3on, Daniel Hernandez, known as 6ix9ine, was asked to name the biggest “name” he had ever had a se*ual encounter with. After pausing to ask if he could be sued for defamation, the rapper answered, “In my dream? Ayesha Curry.”Though framed as a joke, the comment spread fast across social platforms.Internet personality Dr. Umar soon inserted himself into the discussion, offering unsolicited advice aimed directly at Stephen Curry.“If Steph Curry finds out 6ix9ine tapped his queen, he might have to leave,” Umar said. He continued, “Because you don’t go from Steph Curry to 6ix9ine, no disrespect.”Neither Stephen nor Ayesha Curry has addressed the comments publicly.This is not the first time Ayesha Curry has been pulled into viral discourse without seeking it. Over the years, her openness on podcasts and social media has often been dissected, sometimes unfairly. Yet this incident stands apart because it originated entirely outside her control.Stephen Curry has historically ignored most public shots aimed at his family. Still, there are moments when he draws a line. In the past, rapper Killer Mike made a comment that crossed that boundary, prompting a rare public response from Curry.“Naaaa, not you, Mike. I’m cool staying silent and letting these other clowns have their moment,” Curry wrote. “And you’re the worst of them. But you’re better than that, @killermike.”As the 6ix9ine controversy simmers, fans continue to watch closely. Although it’s unlikely, Steph’s response will certainly be a headline grabber.Also Read: Is Nikola Jovic alright?

Jake Paul vs Anthony Joshua sparks David Haye’s boldest boxing prediction



David Haye extends his support for Jake Paul



David Haye’s latest prediction landed with some force. Ahead of Jake Paul ’s professionally sanctioned heavyweight bout with Anthony Joshua, the former world champion stunned boxing fans by backing the YouTuber-turned-fighter to pull off what he believes could become a sporting earthquake. The super hyped fight, set for a global Netflix audience, is already in the speculation phase. Haye’s extended the curiosity, turning it into a heated debate.Joshua enters with pedigree, power, and experience in his sleeves. Paul walks in with belief and a strong desire to gamble big. Haye’s argument does not rely on fantasy, especially considering Jake’s history in the sport. While the result could be far from an easy prediction, there will certainly be chaos that heavyweight boxing can unleash when least expected.Speaking on SunSport’s No Glove Lost, David Haye made his stance clear. “I think something dramatic’s gonna happen,” he said. He floated scenarios many would dismiss, yet boxing history supports. Injuries. Cuts. A clash of heads. One moment that shifts everything.“I’m going the complete opposite way. I think it’s gonna be the biggest, somehow, I don’t know how it’s gonna happen, but I think it’s gonna be the biggest upset in sporting history,” Haye said.He added, “I don’t know why, I’m going the opposite way. Something’s gonna happen.”Haye questioned Paul’s motivation, noting the American had countless safer options. “Why would Jake Paul, who could pick anybody in the world, pick, maybe he knows something,” he said. “There’s something happening that Jake Paul and his team know that the rest of the world doesn’t know, including me.”Joshua, 36, returns after a knockout loss to Daniel Dubois. Paul, 28, arrives after beating Julio Cesar Chavez Jr and stepping up again in weight. The risk is real. So is the spectacle.Haye’s respect for Paul did not begin here. It grew during Paul’s bout with Mike Tyson . “I could tell he carried him,” Haye said. “Out of respect for Mike Tyson, he wanted him to hear the final bell.”That restraint reshaped Haye’s view. Others echoed it. Viddal Riley called Paul respectful. Derek Chisora praised the attention he brings to boxing, warning Joshua must dominate early or face questions.The rules are clear. Eight rounds. Knockouts allowed. Ten-ounce gloves. Joshua capped at 245 pounds. Paul enters lighter, daring the danger.Also Read: ""I already took over...""- Jake Paul says pressure is on Anthony Joshua ahead of Miami showdown","Former world champion David Haye believes Jake Paul vs Anthony Joshua could be the biggest upset in sporting history.

Garrett Wilson’s return to the field remains uncertain as the New York Jets gear up to face the New Orleans Saints



What happened to Garrett Wilson in this season as the New York Jets suffered?



Garrett Wilson, the New York Jets’ star player, remains missing from the field as he focuses on his recovery from the brutal knee injury that he suffered in Week 10.As the New York Jets gear up to face the New Orleans Saints on Sunday after witnessing a brutal loss against the Jacksonville Jaguars, all eyes are on Garrett Wilson’s return to the field this weekend.Last week, the New York Jets’ head coach, Aaron Glenn, opened up about Garrett Wilson’s potential return to the field.The New York Jets’ head coach said, ""Those conversations are going to be with the doc and are going to be with Garrett and once we nail down those conversations, a decision will be made after that…”But on Monday, Aaron Glenn did not reveal Garrett Wilson’s status for the match against the New Orleans Saints on Sunday.This has sparked concern whether Garrett Wilson would be able to return in this season at all as he focuses on his recovery.To make things more interesting, the New York Jets’ star player, Garrett Wilson should have been activated from injured reserve last week.However, Garrett Wilson remained missing from the field as the New York Jets lost against the Miami Dolphins.At this point in time, neither the team, the New York Jets, nor Garrett Wilson has confirmed any speculations about his potential return to the field in this season.For the unversed, the New York Jets’ popular wide receiver initially suffered a knee injury in Week 6 as the team lost against the Denver Broncos.It seems the injury was brutal as Garrett Wilson missed Week 7 and 8, only to return in Week 10.Unfortunately, as Garrett Wilson’s return to the field in Week 10 sparked hope among fans, the star player ended up injuring his knee once again.This led to Garrett Wilson leaving the game in the middle as he was spotted limping his way back to the sidelines.While Garrett Wilson focuses on recovery, the New York Jets ended up with a pretty devastating season as the team has lost eleven matches while winning only three.Also Read: Davante Adams injury update: Insider breaks silence with a devastating update on the WR’s injury as the Rams gear up to face the Seahawks","Garrett Wilson, the New York Jets’ star player, remains missing from the field as he focuses on his recovery from the brutal knee injury that he suffered in Week 10.

Huge underground tunnels found in South America were not made by humans; footprints point to an animal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/huge-underground-tunnels-found-in-south-america-were-not-made-by-humans-footprints-point-to-an-animal/articleshow/126000998.cms,"Source: BBC

What makes these underground structures unlike natural formations



What fossilised footprints inside the tunnels reveal



Why giant ground sloths dug tunnels: Shelter, climate, and survival strategies



How these tunnels change about our view of ancient ecosystems







Huge‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ underground tunnels found across South America have raised scientific eyebrows as their size and configuration do not match any known human activity. These tunnels, carved in rocks and hard soil, reach for tens of meters, the smoothness of the walls and the uniformity of the curve indicating the work of the purposeful excavation. Their discovery is significant beyond the regional archaeology of the areas, as they dispute the old theories of how the ancient world was transformed and which species were capable of making such changes. The latest studies of the footprints and markings on the floor have helped to establish that these tunnels are the work of a prehistoric animal rather than early humans. This proof has turned the finds into a bigger conversation about the extinct giant animals and their underestimated influence on the environment during the late Pleistocene.The underground tunnels or the giant palaeoburrows, as they are commonly known, have been found mainly in Brazil, Argentina, and parts of Uruguay. Most of them are several meters wide and high enough for a person to stand and walk through, with some extending for miles, so that even natural wear and tear or water flow can hardly be the cause. The inner walls of the tunnels have visible lines and curved marks, which likely resulted from the claws of an animal as opposed to an irregular pattern left by the earth's movements.These cavities are different from human mines or shelters in that they do not have any tool marks, smoke stains, or traces of living, such as fire pits or artefacts. Moreover, their presence is in districts that were once ecological zones and not human settlements, as they can be found in areas that were covered with grasslands and forests.The tunnels were dug into moderately soft rock and compacted sediments, materials that would have been easy for a strong digging animal but difficult for humans without the use of tools, as revealed by geological analysis. The date obtained from the rock layers around them shows that they were made tens of thousands of years ago; thus, the farthest the sustained human presence is in many of these regions will be after this time. The time of their origin, together with their enormous size, has thus excluded all but the largest land mammals of South America as the possible builders.The strongest argument is the fossilised footprints and the claw impressions on the tunnels' walls, and the entrances depict that this is the source of these creatures. Those prints depict an unusual set of toes and the weight distribution of a giant ground sloth, a very massive extinct animal belonging to megafauna. The curl and distance of the imprints indicate that the creature moved slowly and was strong; thus, the light footstep of a human or a small animal can be ruled out. Footprint analysis played a major role in the understanding of the interactions between humans and megafauna in other places, such as a single study published in Science Advances that dealt with terminal Pleistocene footprints connected to the encounters of humans and sloths in North America. Although these places are far away from each other, the method used there shows that trackways can be a dependable way of recognising the species and their behaviour long after the soft tissues and bones have disappeared.In South America, the footprints closely resemble the ground sloth skeletal reconstructions like Lestodon and Glossotherium. Among their characteristics were the huge forelimbs and the long, curved claws, which were perfect for digging and pulling the plant for food. When the traits are taken in relation to the tunnel evidence, they not only account for the size of the burrows but also explain the characteristic surface markings. Also, the non-existence of the mixed human and animal footprints inside the tunnels is additional evidence that the animals were the ones who excavated them and exclusively used them.By knowing the reason that made them spend so much energy on the digging frontier, us an inside in the late Pleistocene ecology. They may have served as simple shelters in which stable temperatures were accompanied by protection against predators. During the times when the climate changes, for example, during a cooler or drier period, the underground areas would have helped to lower the thermal stress and save energy. It is believed that the depth and the direction of many palaeoburrows are suggestive of their creators' intention to evade floods and, at the same time, get the most out of the insulation.The explanation is further supported by behavioural parallels with current burrowing mammals, albeit on a megafaunal scale. No living creature burrows on such a large scale, but a survival mechanism shared by some species, like armadillos, is the burrowing habit. If giant ground sloths, which were slow, could get out of danger, a strong underground refuge would have been a great help to them. The fact that these animals repeatedly scraped the tunnel walls may indicate that the tunnels are not short-term shelters; they were used frequently, and the presence of such behaviour is handed down from one generation to the next.These findings are challenging the scientist's perception of the prehistoric world. They were the animals that were anatomically extinct but still active engineers, rather than being passive later on. The tunnels changed the quality of the soil, affected the movement of the water, and were minuscule habitats for different species that might have been supported by the tunnel network. Attributing this role to them complicates the traditional stories, which consider humans as the sole performers of large-scale environmental modification.Also, the palaeoburrows draw attention to the importance of trace fossils such as footprints and claw marks, which are records of behaviour, not just presence. The more sites get documented, the clearer the picture is of the megafauna's interaction with the environment before their extinction. Apart from that, the present viewpoint has consequences for contemporary conservation, as it points out the great ecological impact of the large animals' extinction. By looking into these ancient tunnels, the researchers get a better understanding of the functioning of the past ecosystems, which is not based on guesses but on tangible ground ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌evidence.Also Read | Second most expensive artwork in history: Klimt’s portrait of Elisabeth Lederer sells for $236.4 million","Giant palaeoburrows have been found in Brazil, Argentina, and parts of Uruguay.

Brittany Williams’ Instagram post stands out amid Josh Allen family news



(Image via: Brittany Williams IG Story)

The NFL world was already in celebration mode when news broke that Josh Allen and Hailee Steinfeld were preparing to welcome their first child. Messages of support and excitement spread quickly, marking a major personal moment for the Buffalo Bills quarterback. Around the same time, a much quieter update surfaced, one that drew attention without trying to compete for it.Brittany Williams, Allen’s former longtime partner, shared a short Instagram Story that felt simple and unguarded. The image showed a neatly arranged closet, clothes lined up with care. Her caption read, “Vegas recap. I’m overwhelmed, i still have so much content to go through 😵‍💫😂,”. There was no reference to Allen or the news surrounding him.Still, the timing made people pause and take notice.On its own, the post was ordinary, a snapshot of travel and the familiar rush of sorting through memories. In context, it felt quietly telling. As Allen steps into a new phase of life, Williams appeared focused on her own present, moving forward at her own pace.The post felt easy. Nothing staged. Nothing pointed. Just a quick look into a normal, busy moment, the kind most people recognize.That’s what made it land. It wasn’t chasing headlines. It was simply part of her day.Williams and Allen go back long before contracts, cameras, or national attention. They were friends growing up and began dating in 2017, when his NFL future was still uncertain. When Allen was drafted by the Buffalo Bills in 2018, Williams moved with him to New York. She was there through the early seasons, the pressure, and the transition into league life. Their relationship lasted close to six years and came to an end in 2023, quietly and without public drama.Life moved quickly after that. Allen’s relationship with actress Hailee Steinfeld pushed him further into the spotlight, well beyond football circles. The attention followed closely. In November 2024, the couple announced their engagement. By May 2025, they were married in Santa Barbara, with family, teammates, and close friends around them.Earlier this month, Allen and Steinfeld shared their most personal update yet. On December 12, Steinfeld announced her pregnancy through her Beau Society Substack, posting a tender video of Allen kissing her baby bump as they stood together in the snow. The moment was widely celebrated across sports and entertainment circles.Against that backdrop, Williams’ Instagram Story felt quietly confident. It was not a response or a statement. It was simply a glimpse into a life continuing forward, busy, full, and entirely her own.Also read: Cardi B’s surprise appearance at Stefon Diggs’ Wellness Wonderland had fans talking all night","Brittany Williams, Josh Allen’s former longtime partner, shared a short Instagram Story that felt simple and unguarded.

NEW DELHI: Last season's finalists Punjab Kings entered the IPL 2026 auction with a purse of Rs 11.50 crore and four slots to fill, including two overseas positions, as they looked to fine-tune their squad after falling short in last season’s title clash against Royal Challengers Bengaluru. With a settled core already in place, the franchise focused on adding depth rather than making headline-grabbing purchases.PBKS have retained a strong and well-balanced nucleus under the leadership of skipper Shreyas Iyer. Their batting group blends youth with experience, with Prabhsimran Singh, Nehal Wadhera, Shashank Singh and Harnoor Pannu forming a dependable Indian core.Youngsters Musheer Khan and Priyansh Arya add future promise and flexibility, while the presence of Marcus Stoinis and Azmatullah Omarzai ensures all-round options in both departments.The bowling attack, led by Arshdeep Singh and Yuzvendra Chahal, continues to be one of the team’s major strengths.While Punjab Kings adopted a measured approach, the mini auction at the Etihad Arena in Abu Dhabi was dominated by big-money deals elsewhere.Punjab Kings strengthened their squad by picking up Cooper Connolly for Rs 3 crore, Ben Dwarshuis for Rs 4.40 crore, and adding domestic depth with Pravin Dubey and Vishal Nishad at Rs 30 lakh each.These additions complement a retained group that already includes the likes of Marco Jansen, Lockie Ferguson, Harpreet Brar and Xavier Bartlett.With a settled core, improved depth and a mix of proven performers and emerging talent, Punjab Kings will head into IPL 2026 aiming to go one step further and convert last season’s heartbreak into a long-awaited title triumph.Australian all-rounder Cameron Green grabbed the spotlight after being snapped up by Kolkata Knight Riders for a staggering Rs 25.20 crore, making him the third most expensive player in IPL history. Chennai Super Kings, meanwhile, went all out for uncapped Indian talent as Prashant Veer and Kartik Sharma became the highest-priced uncapped players in IPL history. KKR further made waves by securing Matheesha Pathirana for Rs 18 crore, a record fee for a Sri Lankan player at an IPL auction.Overall, all 10 franchises filled the 77 available slots, spending a combined Rs 215.45 crore in a frenetic auction that underlined the league’s growing financial muscle.Arshdeep Singh, Azmatullah Omarzai, Harnoor Pannu, Harpreet Brar, Lockie Ferguson, Marco Jansen, Marcus Stoinis, Mitch Owen, Musheer Khan, Nehal Wadhera, Prabhsimran Singh, Priyansh Arya, Pyla Avinash, Shashank Singh, Shreyas Iyer, Suryansh Shedge, Vishnu Vinod, Vyshak Vijaykumar, Xavier Bartlett, Yash Thakur, Yuzvendra ChahalCooper Connolly (Rs 3 crore), Pravin Dubey (Rs 30 lakh), Vishal Nishad (Rs 30 lakh), Ben Dwarshuis (Rs 4.40 crore)Punjab Kings: Prabhsimran Singh, Priyansh Arya, Shreyas Iyer, Shashank Singh, Nehal Wadhera, Marcus Stoinis, Azmatullah Omarzai, Marco Jansen, Harpreet Brar, Yuzvendra Chahal, Arshdeep Singh, Musheer Khan, Pyala Avinash, Harnoor Pannu, Suryansh Shedge, Mitchell Owen, Xavier Bartlett, Lockie Ferguson, Vyshak Vijaykumar, Yash Thakur, Vishnu Vinod, Cooper Connolly, Ben Dwarshuis, Pravin Dubey, Vishal Nishad.",Last season's finalists Punjab Kings entered the IPL 2026 auction with a purse of Rs 11.50 crore and four slots to fill.

"NHL Injury Update: Mike Matheson out for Montreal Canadiens vs Philadelphia Flyers, Jacob Fowler to start",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-injury-update-mike-matheson-out-for-montreal-canadiens-vs-philadelphia-flyers-jacob-fowler-to-start/articleshow/126018863.cms,"Mike Matheson (Image Via Twitter)

How Montreal Canadiens are adjusting with Jacob Fowler in net

The Montreal Canadiens have officially confirmed that they will be missing Mike Matheson, their pivotal defenseman, for their Tuesday matchup with the Flyers. Matheson, who is 31 years old, is considered day-to-day due to an upper-body injury and has been heavily involved in Montreal's defense this year. He is one of the top scorers on the team with four goals and twelve assists after playing 32 games, and averaging almost 25 minutes per game, which is the highest on the team. His absence will greatly affect the Canadiens, whom he has been helping with his experience and leadership on the ice.Just recently, Matheson signed a contract that extends over five years with a $6 million AAV, which will keep him in Montreal until the end of the 2030–31 season.He was brought over from the Pittsburgh Penguins in July 2022, and the Pointe-Claire native has been a valuable player right from the start. In his eleven NHL seasons spent with the Florida Panthers, Penguins, and Canadiens, Matheson has scored 78 goals and has collected 281 points in 659 games, and he has also added one goal and eight points in 25 playoff games. Even though his performance has slightly dropped in the recent past, the player is still a dependable member of Montreal's strongest defensemen.Since Matheson is not playing, the fresh goalie Jacob Fowler will take the net for the third time in the NHL, and it will be his first time at the Bell Centre. The young American of 21 years of age was recently called up from the AHL team Laval Rocket and made a good impression when he had his debut, as he had stopped 36 shots in a 4-2 victory against the Pittsburgh Penguins. Later, he had his first NHL loss when he let in five goals during a 5-4 overtime defeat to the New York Rangers. The team will rely on Fowler's nerve and the good support of the defense around him to keep the equilibrium against Philadelphia.The Canadiens, notwithstanding roster limitations, aspire to keep on reinforcing the momentum with the return of Matheson imminent in a few days. Supporters will observe the young lineup’s adaptation to Fowler’s playing goal, and at the same time, the unavailability of a veteran defender on the team.Also Read: Where does Auston Matthews live?

NHL Update: Joseph Woll returns vs Chicago Blackhawks as Toronto Maple Leafs look for stability in net,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-update-joseph-woll-returns-vs-chicago-blackhawks-as-toronto-maple-leafs-look-for-stability-in-net/articleshow/126020679.cms,"Joseph Woll (Image Via Twitter)

Why Joseph Woll’s return matters for Toronto Maple Leafs right now

The Toronto Maple Leafs, Joseph Woll, and the Chicago Blackhawks are all involved in a significant reset moment for Toronto that the regular season heavily needs. The Maple Leafs, having a brief but noticeable absence, are now getting a key player back in their goal, the team hoping that the player’s return can bring them the winning consistency that they have been struggling with in the past weeks.Craig Berube, the Toronto head coach, made it known that Joseph Woll would be taking up the position of the starting goalie on Tuesday night at Scotiabank Arena. This will be marking his first game in four matches that have been missed because of a lower-body injury. At the same time, Woll’s return is a part of a great plan that is aimed at keeping the team afloat in the very competitive Eastern Conference playoff race.The coach revealed to the press that Woll is all set to go after the injury he sustained on 4th December against the Carolina Hurricanes, which forced him to leave that match at an earlier stage.Although the team never announced the exact moment when the injury happened, Woll’s sudden disappearance to start the third period immediately created a concern. The coach stated that the goaltender was right on the projected time for recovery, which enabled the Toronto team to avoid a longer-term setback.The 27-year-old has already gone through a lot of troubles during this season, having been off the ice for some time because of personal issues, during which he was put on long-term injured reserve.He has been, though, quite unnoticeably, one of the most reliable players in the Leafs’ squad, performing the night with a record of 4-3-1, a goals-against average of 2.44, and a fantastic save percentage of .928. Prior to his injury, he had been successful in three out of four of his last games.Toronto’s record in Woll’s absence was 1-1-2, which included a very disappointing home defeat against the Edmonton Oilers. Since Anthony Stolarz is still out, Berube will have to depend on Woll and Dennis Hildeby to share the load. Hildeby had a good run, but still, it is the presence of Woll that gives the Leafs the much-needed evenness in goal.Woll is needed in such a case as he is in 7th spot (Toronto) in the division when it comes to the Atlantic. If he gets back the rhythm fast, the Maple Leafs might still find a realistic way into the playoff picture.Also Read: NHL Trade Rumours: Phillip Danault, Ryan Strome, Mason Marchment linked to potential trades",Joseph Woll is set to return for the Toronto Maple Leafs against the Chicago Blackhawks.

Cooper Flagg emerges as key player for Dallas Mavericks as he takes on multiple responsibilities amid injuries

Dallas Mavericks’ no 1 pick Cooper Flagg delivers historic performances

Cooper Flagg is only 18 years old, but he is already doing things no teenager has ever done in NBA history. With every game, the Dallas Mavericks rookie is proving why he was considered one of the most special young basketball talents in the world. On Sunday night, Flagg secured 21 points, eight rebounds, five assists, and two blocks. Even LeBron James never achieved that exact stat at the same age.On Monday night, against the Utah Jazz, Flagg scored 42 points, the most ever scored by an 18-year-old in an NBA game. That performance broke LeBron James’ previous record of 37 points during the 2003–04 season. Although the Mavericks lost the game, Flagg was the clear star of the night.He scored 24 points in the first half alone and carried Dallas on from start to finish.What makes Flagg stand out is not just his ability to score. Due to several recent injuries in the Mavericks, he has been asked to play multiple roles, including handling the ball. For any rookie, this would be a tough responsibility. For an 18-year-old just weeks into his NBA career, it is extraordinary.Despite the pressure, Flagg has shown immense maturity beyond his years.He defends, passes, rebounds, and leads on the court. The trust Dallas has placed in him is crystal clear, and Flagg has been able to do justice to the expectations put on him, with his consistent performances every game.The Dallas Mavericks selected Cooper Flagg as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NBA Draft, a decision that already looks just fully justified. Less than two months into his rookie season, he has delivered multiple headline-making performances. For now, one thing is certain that Flagg’s rapid rise couldn’t have come at a better time, and Flagg, at a very young age, is becoming one of the bigger faces of the NBA.Cooper Flagg’s journey has been remarkable. Born and brought up in Maine, he rose to national attention at Montverde Academy before becoming the standout player at Duke University. Even before college, he impressed while playing with the U.S. Select Team, helping prepare Team USA stars for the Paris 2024 Olympics.Also Read: How many points did Cooper Flagg score tonight?

DEHRADUN: Major General Lakhwinder Singh (retd), 77, hung up his boots in 2006 after nearly four decades of service in the Army. Commissioned in Dec 1967, he fought the 1971 Indo-Pak war as a 23-year-old captain attached to Field Regiment in the Dera Baba Nanak sector of Punjab. As the country prepares to celebrate Vijaya Diwas on Tuesday, he recalls an episode involving a Pakistani soldier that he says remains etched in his memory.Maj Gen Singh, who is also credited with the innovative use of artillery during the Kargil War that turned the tide in India's favour, shared the anecdote with TOI over the phone from his Delhi home.""I fought the adversary in the Dera Baba Nanak sector opposite Kartarpur Sahib on the western border.A few days after the war ended on Dec 16 with the declaration of a ceasefire, I was asked to lead a small contingent to exchange sweets and pleasantries with Pakistani counterparts to mark Eid,"" he said.""After reaching a common spot near the border, we exchanged greetings and sweets. After a few minutes, one of them asked about the officer handling artillery on our side, which was me. No one from our side revealed my name, but asked why they wanted to know.They said it was because artillery had caused heavy damage to them,"" Maj Gen Singh added.He recalled that soon after, a Pakistani soldier looked towards him and said, ""Agar India ke officers aur Pakistan ke jawan mil jaayen to duniya mein koi humein shikast nahi de sakta (If Indian officers and Pakistani soldiers come together, no one in the world could defeat us)."" ""I simply smiled and thanked him,"" he said.Maj Gen Singh described the moment as a testament to the ingrained ethos of Indian Army officers to lead from the front, unlike most of their Pakistani counterparts.""Having said that, it is not that Indian soldiers are not brave — they are extremely courageous. But the statement surprised us. We heard something similar again more than two decades later during the Kargil War, which suggested that stories about Indian Army officers were passed down generations on the other side,"" he said.""In the 1971 war, we largely encountered Pakistani JCOs and NCOs fighting at the front, which further reinforced that soldier's remark,"" he added.Lt Gen Mohan Bhandari (retd), who served alongside Maj Gen Singh during the Kargil War, echoed the Pakistani soldier's observation.""It is well known that Pakistani officers rarely lead their men from the front, unlike Indian Army officers. Indian officers are trained to lead from the front, not issue orders from behind,"" he said.""That is why the proportion of Indian Army officers making the supreme sacrifice during conflicts is higher. They are prepared to kill and to die for their men without a second thought,"" Lt Gen Bhandari added.The septuagenarian veteran also recalled another incident from the 1971 war in the Dera Baba Nanak sector, describing it as ""something divine"".""It was Dec 6, 1971. I, along with soldiers including those from 1/3 Gorkha, was tasked with attacking an enclave held by the Pakistani Army. The operation began in darkness, with heavy firing from our side,"" he said.""While advancing, we encountered a Pakistani pillbox, which we fired upon for three to four minutes — a significant duration in combat. We were certain that anyone inside would have been killed. Just then, a Pakistani soldier emerged from the pillbox and ran towards safety. We froze and could not bring ourselves to pull the trigger. It felt like the Almighty had willed that he live,"" Maj Gen Singh said.","Major General Lakhwinder Singh (retd), 77, hung up his boots in 2006 after nearly four decades of service in the Army.

Caleb Hammer pulls Frogan into financial audit as streamer drama escalates





Caleb Hammer has publicly invited Twitch streamer Frogan to appear on his YouTube show Financial Audit, tying the offer to a major charity donation amid ongoing backlash involving Asmongold. The finance creator stepped into the situation after Frogan went viral for an emotional stream where she spoke about serious money stress, declining income, and the mental toll of a legal dispute linked to Ethan Klein. Asmongold later reacted to the clip, questioning parts of her story and drawing wider attention from the commentary and finance side of YouTube. With interest growing, Hammer made his move, framing the invite as both content and potential financial help.In his public message, Hammer said he would match a $10,000 charity donation connected to Asmongold’s involvement or, alternatively, give Frogan $5,000 directly.Hammer wrote. The proposal quickly spread across social media, with viewers debating whether the offer was genuine support or another example of creators turning personal struggles into viral moments.Hammer’s show Financial Audit is known for breaking down guests’ budgets, debts, and spending habits on camera, often in a blunt and confrontational style. His invite to Frogan came after she revealed she streamed fewer than 100 days this year and struggled to afford basic expenses, claiming the stress of lawsuits and online pressure hurt both her finances and mental health. By linking her appearance to a charity donation, Hammer turned the situation into a high-stakes offer share her financial details publicly, and in return, a large sum goes to charity, with optional direct cash support.The offer also pulls Asmongold further into the conversation, even though Hammer made it clear the money would be separate from Asmongold’s own choices. For some viewers, it looked like a rare chance for transparency and real help. For others, it raised concerns about mixing charity, criticism, and entertainment in a highly emotional situation.In the end, the decision now rests with Frogan. Accepting the invite could bring clarity to her financial claims and immediate relief through charity or cash. Declining it may help her avoid further scrutiny but keep questions unanswered. Either way, Hammer’s move shows how fast personal creator struggles can turn into public, high-profile content once major names step in.Also Read: AugieRFC’s channel suspended by YouTube AI moderation, claims violation was fake",Caleb Hammer invited Twitch streamer Frogan to appear on his YouTube show Financial Audit.

Fame, safety concerns, and a lifestyle Nichols no longer wanted





Former YouTuber Luke Nichols, who was behind the highly successful Outdoor Boys channel, recently revealed his reason behind stepping back from YouTube and content creation. For many years, Nichols built a loyal following by documenting his outdoor adventures, survival skills, and familial moments that felt authentic and relatable. His channel’s rapid growth turned him into one of YouTube’s most recognizable outdoor creators.In an interview on Steven’s MyLifeOutdoors channel, Nichols spoke candidly about how he did not see himself growing old as a YouTuber and had been thinking of retirement for some years. He emphasized that other concerns, including long-term sustainability, personal safety, and family priorities, shaped his outlook.During his appearance on MyLifeOutdoors, Nichols explained his long-term plans and how being a YouTuber was not feasible anymore. While also reflecting on the nature of online fame, he said, ""I always knew that I wasn't going to do this forever. And I've been thinking of retiring for a couple of years, actually. You know? I've been talking.""Nichols further went back in time to when he achieved peak fame and how people were recognizing him everywhere.Instead of embracing all the attention, he grew concerned about himself and his family. The former YouTuber added, ""A big part of it was the exposure. The channel blew up really big, and it kind of went from, 'Oh, people recognize me every once in a while…we started to have really serious conversations about security issues and the safety of the family.For Nichols, the idea of becoming a full-time celebrity did not attract him in the first place. He expressed his desire to live a normal life with his family and have the freedom to go wherever he wanted without any disruptions of any kind. He stated, “I'm looking at, you know, 'Okay, I'm going to be, you know, a really full-blown celebrity lifestyle.' I'm like, 'I don't want that. I don't want it for the kids. I don't want to live that way. ”Alongside fame, Nichols further pointed to another issue many creators face, which is the need to work at a relentless pace. He asserted that working 80 to 100 hours a week had taken a toll on his health and balance. For him, stepping away was not about choosing a life that kept him grounded and focused on his family.Also read: OutDoor Boys star Luke Nichols comes back from YouTube retirement to help MyLifeOutdoors creator Steven in family crisis","Former YouTuber Luke Nichols, who was behind the highly successful Outdoor Boys channel, recently revealed his reason behind stepping back from YouTube and content creation.

After recovering from an injury, Wembanyama scored 22 points in just 21 minutes off the bench to help the Spurs defeat the Oklahoma City Thunder.During the NBA Cup semifinals matchup between the San Antonio Spurs and the Oklahoma City Thunder on Saturday, Victor Wembanyama had the surprise of being pulled out from the bench for the first time in his very short NBA career.Showing great persistence, San Antonio managed to have a record of 9-3 during Wemby’s time off.The Spurs ended the Thunder's 16-game winning streak thanks to Wembanyama's dominating 21 minutes after he missed a month of action due to a calf ailment. In response to a question about beginning in the final, Wembanyama said:""It's going to be a mix of different opinions. But I'm ready. Even I will have my own opinion [about what to do].It will also be based on my thoughts and the thoughts of the staff. I just said a bunch of nothing. But basically, we're going to discuss it.""Coach Mitch Johnson of the Spurs said they will continue cautiously with Wembanyama's involvement. Additionally, he mentioned that Wembanyama's first game back was limited in terms of minutes. He then stated:""It'll be something that Victor and I will continue to talk through.”Wembanyama's desire to play and start was acknowledged, but he emphasised that decisions must take team dynamics into account and not be made in a vacuum. Johnson went into detail about how difficult it is to efficiently manage playing time. He explained:""Wherever you put some minutes, that means you have less over there.”On Saturday, Wembanyama spent twenty-one minutes playing against the Thunder. His career-low of 19:41 from his rookie season is the second-fewest minutes he has ever recorded in an NBA game. The coach stressed the need of drawing lessons from the past without presuming to have all the answers. Johnson added:""We are still learning and want to be very mindful of that.”The return of Wembanyama gives San Antonio's lineup more depth as they get ready for this pivotal matchup with the New York Knicks. His significance to the team as they strive for success in Las Vegas is highlighted by his capacity to quickly recover from injuries.The versatile and talented big men of the Spurs want to take their team to victory over the Knicks in the NBA Cup championship game after handing the Thunder their second loss of the season only. These finals against the New York Knicks, who are always a fit and challenging opposition, are not just another series for the Spurs; rather, they are taking steps to ensure that all players are performing at their best.Anticipation has reached its peak and a lot of speculation can be made when it comes to Wemby, his Spurs teammates, and the Knicks. The fans are looking forward to seeing which team will handle the scenario under pressure and in a very soon to be live broadcast from a Las Vegas arena as the excitement for this decisive match between two teams, who are both striving for the NBA Cup, grows.Also read: Victor Wembanyama injury update: San Antonio Spurs legend set to return as team gears up for high-stakes NBA Cup semifinal against Oklahoma City Thunder","Victor Wembanyama scored 22 points in just 21 minutes off the bench to help the San Antonio Spurs defeat the Oklahoma City Thunder on Saturday.

Tee Higgins concussion status ahead of Week 16 against upcoming opponent

Over the last few weeks, Tee Higgins has been among the biggest missing pieces for the Cincinnati Bengals. Fans are anxiously watching the receiver's condition before to Week 16 of the 2025 NFL season; he has been out of the starting lineup in two of the last three games.With the Bengals still pushing to finish the season strong, Higgins’ health has become a major talking point.The concern is real. Tee Higgins has suffered two concussions in a short span, which has slowed his return. While there has been some progress, the team is moving carefully. Head coach Zac Taylor and the medical staff are focused on player safety as the week begins.Tee Higgins first entered the NFL concussion protocol after a head injury in Week 12. That injury forced him to miss the Week 13 game.Just when it looked like he was close to returning, Higgins suffered another concussion in Week 14.As a result, he was ruled out again and did not play in Sunday’s game.On Monday, head coach Zac Taylor confirmed that Tee Higgins was still in the concussion protocol. Taylor said this was expected since Higgins had not cleared all the required steps last week.The Bengals are taking a cautious approach due to the short gap between the two injuries.There was some positive movement last week. Tee Higgins managed to take part in two limited practices.That showed improvement, but it was not enough for full clearance.For Higgins to return, he must log a full practice session and then be evaluated by an independent neurologist. Only after that final check can he be approved to play.The Bengals will release their first official injury report on Wednesday. If Higgins remains limited, his status likely stays day to day. A full practice would be a strong sign he could suit up on Sunday.Tee Higgins is an important part of the Bengals offense, but the team is aware of the risks involved. Two concussions in such a short time raise serious concerns. That is why the Bengals are not rushing his return, even with a crucial Week 16 game coming up.The Bengals still have several days before kickoff, which gives Higgins time to progress. However, the decision will depend fully on medical clearance, not game importance. Zac Taylor has repeated all season that player health comes first.As of now, Tee Higgins’ status remains uncertain. His availability will likely come down to how his body responds in practice later this week.Also Read: Is Christian Watson Playing In Week 16 Vs The Bears?

Travis Kelce retirement: Brother Jason Kelce suggests stepping away from the game,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/travis-kelce-retirement-brother-jason-kelce-suggests-stepping-away-from-the-game/articleshow/126019931.cms,"(Image Via Getty)

What Jason Kelce actually said about stepping away from the game

“In my opinion, to nail that decision you gotta step away from the game…Play these last three games, enjoy them with your teammates…”

“The team’s going to be different whether you come back or not next year…So enjoy these last three games and then let it sink in.”

Jason Kelce Weighs in on Travis Kelce Retirement Rumors | E! News

Retirement talk around Travis Kelce is getting louder, and now his brother Jason Kelce is adding his voice to the conversation. The retired Philadelphia Eagles star recently shared advice for Travis as the Kansas City Chiefs tight end weighs what comes next after another long NFL season. While fans are reading deeply into Jason’s comments, the message is less about walking away for good and more about stepping back, slowing down, and thinking clearly before making a life-changing decision.Travis Kelce is currently in his 13th NFL season, a milestone that naturally sparks retirement talk for even the most durable stars. Tight end is a physically demanding position, and after more than a decade of hits, long playoff runs, and short offseasons, questions about longevity are unavoidable.Jason Kelce addressed the topic by encouraging his brother to step away from football temporarily before making any decision about retirement. His advice was not about quitting immediately or announcing anything publicly. Instead, Jason emphasized the importance of creating distance from the game once the season ends.According to Jason, taking time away helps players think more clearly, without the physical pain, emotional exhaustion, or outside noise influencing the decision. It is about reflection, not reaction. Jason made it clear that retirement choices should not be rushed or made while emotions are still raw.Jason’s comments carry extra weight because he has already been through the same process. He retired after 13 seasons in the NFL, the exact same career length Travis has now reached. Since stepping away, Jason has been open about how difficult the decision was and how important it was to give himself time before making it official.That experience shapes his advice. Jason understands that retirement is not just about football ability but also about identity, routine, and life after the game. His message reflects someone who has already navigated that emotional crossroads.It is important to be clear about what this situation does not represent. Travis Kelce has not announced his retirement, nor has he shared a timeline for making a decision. Jason is not signaling that his brother is done playing, nor is he pushing him out of the league.Also read - Why Michigan didn’t fire the staffer in Sherrone Moore affair case, and why the coach took the fall instead","Travis Kelce is currently in his 13th NFL season, a milestone that naturally sparks retirement talk for even the most durable stars.

I love everyone who shows love day after day! It is important that you guys also believe that you can do whatever you want in this world! Thank you ❤️”





Kai Cenat made the most of his 24th birthday and used it to spread a rather unique and genuine message among fans. Instead of celebrating on a full-blown “W” stream, the famous Twitch streamer made a video that featured him talking about his mental health issues. In the video that went viral on various social media platforms, Kai thanked fans for their unconditional support but added that the stress associated with trying to achieve more and more content had been giving him a tough time.In the video, Kai said that it’s not because he hasn’t had success, but there is a cost to success in terms of how he feels. The cost has to do with fear, with self-doubt, with the feelings he has inside because he always has to push himself creatively.Kai has announced that he wants to open up to his viewers in a better way. Clearly, this message resonates because it occurred on a day typically associated with celebration.Kai revealed that the pressure of always wanting to grow as a creator may have led him to feel mentally exhausted. As a streamer, he discussed how he had to take a step back and prioritize healing, as opposed to being consumed with thoughts about numbers, views, and what others might think of him.As a streamer, he advised everyone to never underestimate the significance of the streamer's or anyone else's mental health, especially when it might dictate their survival or growth as a creator.He also mentioned, “His message resonated with many viewers, who identified the people he referred to as those who tirelessly dedicate themselves online and rarely take a break. His fans filled his comments section with messages of appreciation for his honesty and reminding him that it's always fine to take a slower pace in life.This viral moment sparked many people to talk about the real consequences of burnout in the online world of live streaming, where people work so many hours and are always in the spotlight without realizing the consequences to their mental and physical health.Ultimately, Kai Cenat’s birthday video reminded us that even for the greatest content creators in the world, struggles exist behind the scenes. In opening up, not only did he give his fans a reminder that he is trying to get past his struggles and become a better person, he also paved a new way for a healthy conversation on mental health.Also Read: Caleb Hammer invites Frogan on financial audit amid Asmongold backlash","Kai Cenat made a video on his 24th birthday to talk about his mental health issues.

The Milwaukee Bucks are reportedly aiming to keep Giannis Antetokounmpo by pursuing short-term roster upgrades

Several NBA teams are monitoring Giannis Antetokounmpo’s situation as trade speculation continues to grow

Giannis Antetokounmpo, a forward with the Milwaukee Bucks, has recently been the subject of trade rumours and conjecture. This allegedly occurred after ESPN's Shams Charania revealed on December 3 that the team and his camp were debating his future and whether the ""best fit"" would be in town or somewhere else.However, Milwaukee is currently experiencing conflict. Giannis Antetokounmpo is said to occasionally urge the Bucks in the direction of a trade, but the Bucks consistently act as though they didn't hear him. Jake Fischer of the Stein Line newsletter has now released a new analysis on the Bucks star that addresses a number of issues.There is a lot of uncertainty about Giannis Antetokounmpo's future with the Milwaukee Bucks.According to Jake Fischer, the Milwaukee Bucks are making every effort to persuade Giannis to stay and have previously shown interest in players like Andrew Wiggins, Marcus Smart, Dejounte Murray, Zach LaVine, and Jerami Grant.On one end, Fischer talked about rival NBA executives' conjecture about the Bucks' potential assessment of Antetokounmpo's trade value:""I also hear rival teams wondering aloud if the Bucks have been so resistant until now to the mere idea of making Antetokounmpo available because they fear that his trade market wouldn't be as robust as anticipated.""According to Chris Haynes, Fischer said that Antetokounmpo is apparently uncomfortable with all of this. The Bucks won't move Antetokounmpo until he compels them to, and given his stated dislike of doing so, they appear to have a tiny window of opportunity to persuade him otherwise. According to reports from Eric Nehm and Marc Stein, they are trying to do this by looking into win-now deals.However, Fischer reported remarks made by a ""rival general manager"" who seemed to think the Bucks wanted to go ""big-game hunting"" in order to support Antetokounmpo and the struggling 11-16 team.""After repeatedly telling teams that Antetokounmpo is not available and that it is not interested in fielding trade offers for him, now Milwaukee is messaging that it wants to be buyers at this deadline to try to get Giannis more help. Even with no clear return-from-injury timetable yet in place for Antetokounmpo, Jon Horst's front office continues to hold onto hope that assembling a puncher's chance contender remains viable in the wide-open Eastern Conference…”The market for Antetokounmpo's services might not be as strong as anticipated if he does demand a move. A list of organisations interested in trading Giannis Antetokounmpo to the Milwaukee Bucks was made public by Chris Haynes. Rumours of a possible trade have been intensifying since the conclusion of the previous season.Before the NBA Cup semifinals, Chris Haynes spoke with Rachel Nichols in Las Vegas. Haynes was requested by Nichols to compile a list of the organisations interested in hiring the Greek superstar.""I heard that the New York Knicks are interested, I think the Miami Heat have interest in Giannis, the Golden State Warriors are interested for a long time, the San Antonio Spurs, the Minnesota Timberwolves, the list goes on.""Antetokounmpo reportedly wants to play in New York, according to several publications. The problem with an Antetokounmpo-to-Miami trade, from the Miami Heat's perspective, is that in order to make it work, the Heat would have to give up a lot of draft selections, Tyler Herro, and possibly Kel'el Ware. However, having said that, nothing is certain as of now for Antetokounmpo.Also read: Giannis Antetokounmpo to Miami Heat?

NEW DELHI: India opener Yashasvi Jaiswal was admitted to hospital on Tuesday after being diagnosed with acute gastroenteritis, just hours after Mumbai’s Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy Super League match against Rajasthan in Pune, according to a report in The Indian Express.The 23-year-old batter featured in the high-scoring encounter despite discomfort and made 15 off 16 balls as Mumbai chased down a stiff target of 217 to win by three wickets. However, the report said Jaiswal had been experiencing stomach cramps during the game, which worsened significantly after the match, prompting immediate medical attention.Jaiswal was taken to the Aditya Birla Hospital in Pimpri-Chinchwad, where doctors confirmed acute gastroenteritis. He was administered intravenous medication and underwent ultrasound and CT scans before being advised to continue his medication and take adequate rest. The BCCI is yet to issue an official update on his condition, though further clarity is expected in the coming days.The development came on a busy day in Indian cricket, with fans largely focused on the IPL auction in Abu Dhabi, where franchises spent heavily on both international stars and uncapped domestic players.Away from the auction spotlight, Jaiswal’s hospitalisation raised concern, given his growing importance across formats for India.Despite the health setback, Jaiswal has been in impressive form in recent weeks. In the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, he scored 145 runs in three matches at an average of 48.33 and a strike rate of 168.6. He also enjoyed a productive ODI series against South Africa earlier this month, amassing 156 runs in three matches at a remarkable average of 78, including his maiden ODI century.In Tuesday’s match, Mumbai’s chase was powered by Ajinkya Rahane’s unbeaten 72 and Sarfaraz Khan’s explosive 22-ball 73, though the team later crashed out of the tournament. With no immediate international assignments and not currently part of India’s T20I setup, Jaiswal is expected to have sufficient recovery time ahead of India’s next set of international commitments in mid-January.","Yashasvi Jaiswal admitted to hospital after being diagnosed with acute gastroenteritis.

The early December winter failed to dampen the mood in Sheeri village of Baramulla, north Kashmir after local boy Auqib Nabi — fondly called ‘North Kashmir Express’ — emerged as one of the region’s biggest cricketing success stories.Residents from Sheeri and adjoining areas gathered outside his two-storey home after the 29-year-old pacer was picked up by the Delhi Capitals for Rs 8.4 crore at the mini auction in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday.Men danced to drumbeats while women sang Kashmiri folk songs, turning the usually quiet village into a scene of jubilation. Despite freezing temperatures with Srinagar recording minus 2.9 degrees Celsius on Monday, celebrations carried on, at times under mobile phone lights as Sheeri remained without electricity due to a scheduled power cut today.Till late evening, groups of youngsters beat drums and marched along the main Sheeri road, expressing their joy.Inside the house, Nabi’s mother, Mehmooda Begum, distributed sweets to well-wishers who poured in to congratulate the family. Residents garlanded his father, Ghulam Nabi, a government school teacher, who was visibly moved and broke down in tears.“He is a down-to-earth cricketer who began his journey on the streets of our village,” neighbour Riyaz Ahmad Ganai said.“I have always seen him calm and focused. His dream has always been to play for the Indian national team, and that day is not far away now,” he said.Ghulam Nabi said the family initially hoped his son would pursue medicine. “But when I saw his dedication and hard work, I fully backed him in his cricketing pursuits,” he said.“I always believed he would make it.” Auqib’s younger brother Imran Nabi is pursuing masters in Mass Communication and Journalism from the University of Kashmir.Another neighbour said Nabi’s rise was remarkable given the lack of basic facilities in the area. “There is no proper cricket ground here. His success shows his resolve and determination,” he said, adding top selectors of the country should visit Baramulla to identify more promising players.“There are many more,” he added. Ghulam Nabi Wani, another resident, called Nabi’s success a message for the youth of Kashmir. “It shows that hard work and focus pays off,” he said.",Auqib Nabi has emerged as one of the region’s biggest cricketing success stories.

Gracie Hunt’s Instagram Story draws attention for its holiday message

(Image via: Gracie Hunt's IG Story)

Gracie Hunt’s holiday post did not come with a long caption or a setup. It was one image, shared briefly, and then gone like most Instagram Stories are. The photo showed a Christmas tree dressed in pink ornaments and large bows, glowing softly under warm lights. It felt lived-in, not styled, which is what made people stop and look.The line that followed was short. Hunt wrote, “This Christmas, give her the gift that keeps on giving,” and tagged @resurrectkinnd. She did not explain what the message meant or why she chose to share it. That absence mattered. The Story did not tell viewers what to think. It let them sit with it.That quiet approach is familiar if you have followed Hunt for a while.As the daughter of Kansas City Chiefs owner Clark Hunt, attention has never been something she needed to chase. Still, she rarely posts anything that feels loud. This Story fit right into that pattern.The pink Christmas tree softened the moment. It did not look like a brand display or a holiday ad. It looked like a corner of someone’s home. Paired with a single sentence, the post stayed open-ended. Some viewers saw it as a reminder about gifting.Others saw it as a simple seasonal thought. Hunt did not narrow it down.That is likely why people noticed. In December, social media is crowded with sponsored posts and heavy messaging. This one did not ask for clicks. It did not ask for engagement. It just appeared, quietly.Hunt has shared moments like this before, posts that touch on family, faith, or everyday life without turning them into statements. This Story followed the same instinct. It passed through timelines quickly, but the message stayed longer than expected. For many who saw it, the Story felt familiar in a quiet way.Not everything online needs to explain itself or ask for a reaction. Some moments pass quickly, then return later in thought. This one did that. It stayed subtle, seasonal, and unmistakably personal.Sometimes, that is enough to linger quietly beyond the moment for fans.Also read: Cardi B’s surprise appearance at Stefon Diggs’ Wellness Wonderland had fans talking all night","Gracie Hunt’s holiday post did not come with a long caption or a setup.
