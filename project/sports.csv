Why India need leader Shreyas Iyer for 2027 World Cup | Greenstone Lobo prediction

NEW DELHI: KL Rahul played a pivotal role in India’s tense run chase against New Zealand in the first ODI, but the challenge he faced went beyond the numbers on the scoreboard. Washington Sundar , who was struggling with a back issue picked up during his bowling spell, found himself unable to run effectively when it was his turn to bat. Rahul revealed the difficulty of managing the innings under these circumstances after the match.“I didn’t know Washi couldn’t run,” KL Rahul said after the match.That admission puts India’s chase into perspective. In tight ODI finishes, running between the wickets is often just as crucial as hitting boundaries. With Sundar’s mobility restricted, Rahul had to reassess how the team approached each scoring opportunity, balancing aggression with caution.“He played some excellent shots. We made sure not to let too many dot balls accumulate.”Rahul’s role expanded from just scoring runs to actively managing the tempo. He had to rotate strike, make calculated singles, and prevent the pressure from building — all while maintaining focus on the target.“We were not up against a very tall target; at this level, you’re generally expected to chase down 6 or 6.5 runs per over in 9 out of 10 instances.”Rahul also emphasised the importance of early partnerships and understanding the pitch conditions. “The pitch remained consistent for the full 100 overs; the new ball is the optimal time to bat. The partnerships developed by Rohit, Gill, and Virat found the precise tempo. It tended to become slower as the innings progressed…”Acknowledging New Zealand’s knack for prolonging matches, Rahul remained composed under pressure. “We have faced a multitude of last-over finishes against New Zealand; they are adept at finding ways to claw their way back into the match. I look forward eagerly to the upcoming games.”Through it all, Rahul’s composure and strategic management of the innings underscored his influence — proving that in such high-pressure chases, leadership at the crease can be just as important as the runs scored.","KL Rahul played a pivotal role in India’s tense run chase against New Zealand in the first ODI.

This defeats the very objective of SIR, which is intended to strengthen and purify the electoral roll.""After the 2002 SIR of the electoral roll, voters applied for changes in names and addresses, which were ratified by EC and included in 2025 poll rolls, Mamata said. ""EC is now disregarding its own statutory processes followed consistently over two decades and compelling electors to once again establish their identity and eligibility,"" she wrote.Mamata said that over 23 years, many electors submitted Form 8 with valid govt-issued documents and, after quasi-judicial hearings, their particulars were corrected.

The NBA trade deadline is getting closer, and the Los Angeles Lakers are once again part of serious trade talk. One proposal making the rounds involves a deal with the Sacramento Kings that would change the look of both teams without touching their main stars.The Lakers have been inconsistent this season, especially when the bench is on the floor. Scoring drops, spacing tightens, and defensive pressure fades. That has pushed the front office to look for rotation help that can contribute right away while still fitting around LeBron James and Luka Dončić.The proposed deal sends Malik Monk, Keon Ellis, and Devin Carter to the Los Angeles Lakers. In return, the Sacramento Kings would receive Dalton Knecht, Gabe Vincent, and Maxi Kleber.From a money standpoint, the deal works. Monk’s $18 million salary is balanced by Vincent and Kleber, while Knecht’s rookie contract helps fill the gap. No draft picks are included, which keeps the move simple and realistic before the deadline.Malik Monk gives the Los Angeles Lakers something they lack: reliable bench scoring. He can handle the ball, create shots late in the clock, and run offense when the starters sit.He has already shown he can thrive in a sixth-man role.Ellis adds perimeter defense and shooting. He guards well, stays disciplined, and knocks down open threes at a high rate. Carter, while still developing, brings athleticism and defensive effort that fits a team needing younger legs.Knecht and Vincent have struggled to earn steady minutes, and Kleber’s injuries have limited his impact. From the Lakers’ side, this is a rotation upgrade without sacrificing core pieces.Sacramento Kings’ backcourt is crowded. With De’Aaron Fox and DeMar DeRozan leading the offense, Monk, Ellis, and Carter often compete for limited minutes.Dalton Knecht offers scoring potential on the wing and is still on a rookie deal. Vincent provides experienced guard depth, and Kleber adds size and floor spacing in the frontcourt. The move also gives the Kings more flexibility moving forward without fully stepping away from the season.The Lakers clearly gain more in the short term. Monk and Ellis immediately raise the level of the rotation and address clear weaknesses. Sacramento gets useful pieces and flexibility but gives up players who already contribute.Also read: NBA trade rumors: Toronto Raptors predicted to pursue $197,230,450 Memphis Grizzlies Champion to fill roster void and improve title odds If this deal happens, it won’t grab headlines like a superstar trade, but it could matter when games slow down and benches decide outcomes in the playoffs.","The NBA trade deadline is getting closer, and the Los Angeles Lakers are once again part of serious trade talk.

How Evgeni Malkin’s contracts, achievements, and salary shaped his net worth after 2016

Celebrating Evgeni Malkin’s Journey to 1,000 Games

What achievements and off-ice income added to Malkin’s wealth?



Evgeni Malkin’s financial history in the past ten years is a kind of mirror that reflects how elite NHL stars have not only been able to add even more to their earnings by their performance but also to prolong their careers in terms of earning power, which is well beyond the traditional career curves. Starting from 2016, Malkin became the center of the Pittsburgh Penguins team and remained a highly valued asset of the franchise, which secured his long-term contract together with consistent production.Malkin's career took a major turn in this period that coincided with a change in the whole league where age was no longer considered a financial cutoff. The saying that ""2026 is the new 2016"" is a reflection of the fact that some veteran stars are still very much in their prime and hence able to command high salaries and play a prominent role in the game even after ten years, just like Malkin.As per Celebrity Net Worth, as of the year 2024, the net worth of Evgeni Malkin is believed to be around $60 million, whereas, at the end of the 2025-26 season, Spotrac will consider his overall NHL career earnings to be more than $151 million. Starting from 2016, Malkin's sports career was entirely connected to the Pittsburgh Penguins, thus securing both the team's financial stability and the value of the franchise during the final period of his career.Malkin's contract extended from 2016 to 2022, which was the second half of an eight-year, $76 million contract. He was earning a salary of $9.5 million per year until the 2021-22 season. This period marked some of the most important successes of his late career, including getting the Stanley Cup twice in a row and being the main player of Pittsburgh's dominance for the whole period. Not only did the winning seasons elevate his status, but they also made sure that he would receive the highest salary till his 30s and beyond.Malkin officially extended his contract with the Penguins for four years and $24.4 million, which was published by NHL.com in July 2022; thus, the extension had an average annual value of $6.1 million for the whole period up to the 2025–26 season. The annual payment was gradually reduced—from $8 million in 2022-23 to $4.8 million in 2025–26. This part of the contract coincides perfectly with a larger trend in the NHL, often referred to as ""2026 is the new 2016"", where aging superstars are still able to keep their value longer because of good training, flexible roles, and wisdom.Despite contracts, Malkin kept reaching important milestones after 2016, i.e., his 1,000th NHL point, his 1,000th NHL game in 2022, and his 500th career goal in 2024, all the while being an alternate captain in Pittsburgh.Malkin's partnership with GoPro, Upper Deck, Framework, and Mogosport, as well as investments such as the e-sports organization Pittsburgh Knights, not only supplemented his NHL salary but also transformed his career into a long-term financial growth plan.During the period of 2016-2026, Evgeni Malkin transformed elite performance into durable financial strength, therefore mirroring both longevity and the changing trends in the NHL throughout the decade of consistency turned into a net worth.Also Read: Detroit Red Wings retire Sergei Fedorov’s iconic No. 91 jersey, closing a long‑awaited chapter","Evgeni Malkin's net worth is believed to be around $60 million as of the year 2024.

Comparing Alex Ovechkin and Connor McDavid Car Collections

Alex Ovechkin: “My Car is like My Girl”

Alex Ovechkin and Connor McDavid are remarkable not only in the NHL for their super speed, skill, and all-around accomplishments but also for their very impressive passion off the ice. Besides hockey, these superstars are already taking a great interest in high-performance and luxury cars, thereby making their garages an extension of their characters. The sportsmen and the collectors are all amazed at how these athletes manage to exhibit the qualities of precision, power, and style in all aspects of their lives, whether on or off the rink.The discussion isn’t limited only to the rich; It also includes the love for cars, the selection, and the story each vehicle represents. Ovechkin’s favorites are the ones that symbolize bravado and control, reflecting his daredevil-esque playing style; on the other hand, McDavid’s automobiles imply subtlety, mastery, and accuracy—all the same qualities that he exhibits on the rink. It is very hard for the supporters not to put the two on the same scales when weighing who would be the ""winner"" in terms of horsepower and elegance, taken alongside their NHL awards.Alex Ovechkin had created a stronghold of sports cars in his garage. The star vehicle in his collection is the Mercedes-Benz SL65 AMG Black Series, which not only has an aggressive look but also a twin-turbo V12 engine that produces spectacular power; the Lamborghini Aventador is another beast in Ovechkin's collection that puts out over 700 hp.The already familiar to the fans BMW 5 Series, which was an early pick, still is in the collection, as it has sentimental value for Ovechkin, and a new luxury SUV presented as a gift for breaking records is another car that mirrors his developing likings. Ovechkin’s cars are high-octane, powerful, and made for those who want the world to notice them everywhere.On the other hand, Connor McDavid is the epitome of melodrama balanced with great precision. The Porsche 911 GT2 RS essentially is the car he would use for the track, while the Lamborghini Huracán and Audi R8 are the ones that present the attributes of high performance and flashy looks. McDavid’s storytelling through the use of cars shows the combination of performance and art, the mixing of showmanship and technical mastery. ESPN and NHL.com confirm that both players are very selective when it comes to filling their garages with cars, saying that each car is a manifestation of the athlete’s personality and career style.The supercar collections of both Ovechkin and McDavid are the perfect reflection of their rivalry on the ice, whether it be Ovechkin's sheer strength or McDavid's accuracy. Supporters may argue all day, but one thing is for sure: both athletes are outstanding in the rink as well as they drive off it.Also Read: Detroit Red Wings retire Sergei Fedorov’s iconic No. 91 jersey, closing a long‑awaited chapter","Alex Ovechkin and Connor McDavid are remarkable not only in the NHL for their super speed, skill, and all-around accomplishments but also for their very impressive passion off the ice.

The NBA fined Jaylen Brown after public criticism of officiating



The NBA fined Jaylen Brown amid free-throw disparity concerns



Jaylen Brown stepped in front of reporters after Boston’s narrow loss to San Antonio on Saturday, and the outcome was not so smooth. The Celtics had dropped a 100-95 game at TD Garden, and the frustration lingered even after the final buzzer.Boston attempted only four free throws as a team. San Antonio took 20. Brown scored 27 points, grabbed eight rebounds, and dished out seven assists, yet never reached the line. His reaction became the center of attention across the league, and by Monday afternoon, the NBA delivered its response with a $35,000 fine.The league fined Jaylen Brown for comments made to reporters and on social media that directly criticized game officials. The NBA cited public criticism of officiating as the reason for the penalty. Brown acknowledged the risk in real time and made it clear he accepted the consequence.“I'll accept the fine at this point,” saying that the officiating was not good enough. “I think they're a good defensive team, but they ain't that damn good. I hope somebody can just pull up the clips, because it's the same (things) every time we play a good team.It's, like, they refuse to make a call, then they call touch fouls on the other end, and that's just extremely frustrating, bro.”Brown continued speaking at length, calling out what he described as repeated inconsistency. He even mentioned an official by name, which all but guaranteed league action. The NBA responded swiftly, issuing the fine before Boston’s next game.The numbers from Saturday night added context to Brown’s anger. Boston entered the game already ranking last in the league in free-throw attempts compared to opponents. Against San Antonio, the gap widened again. The Celtics committed 18 fouls, while the Spurs were whistled for 13, yet most of Boston’s fouls resulted in trips to the line.Brown, who committed four fouls himself, focused on the physical nature of the game and how contact was judged on each end of the floor.“We play hard. We are outplaying our expectations, we compete hard on the defensive end and they reward the other team with touch fouls and we go down there and guys are allowed to get away with — somebody please pull it up,” Brown said. “Every time we play a good team the inconsistency is crazy. I'll take the fine. Curtis, all them dudes, was terrible tonight. I don't care, they can fine me whatever they want.”Brown later doubled down online, writing, “I’m irate at how they officiated the game today,” while again pointing to the four free throw attempts in a four-point loss.Despite the fine, Brown’s on-court production has been standout. He is averaging a career-high 29.5 points while leading a Celtics team sitting at 24-14.Also Read: Jordyn Woods dazzles in winterwear trapper hat as Karl-Anthony Towns’ fiancée shares stunning photos","The NBA fined Jaylen Brown for comments made to reporters and on social media that directly criticized game officials.

“She'll choose…”: Aaron Rodgers opens up about consulting wife Brittani amid growing NFL retirement speculation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/shell-choose-aaron-rodgers-opens-up-about-consulting-wife-brittani-amid-growing-nfl-retirement-speculation/articleshow/126485584.cms,"Aaron Rodgers sparked fresh retirement speculation after referencing his wife, Brittani, while discussing his NFL future. Playing on a one-year deal with the Pittsburgh Steelers, Rodgers said he would consult her before making any decision. The rare comment offered insight into his private marriage and family-first mindset.

Aaron Rodgers linked retirement talks to his private marriage

As the 2025 NFL season drew to a tense close, Aaron Rodgers found himself at the center of two conversations that refused to stay separate. One involved football, legacy, and the possibility of retirement. The other was far more personal. In a rare moment of openness, Rodgers referenced his wife, Brittani, offering fans an unexpected glimpse into a relationship he has deliberately kept away from public view.At the time, Rodgers was navigating uncertainty with the Pittsburgh Steelers, playing on a one-year deal with questions swirling about whether a Week 18 loss could mark the end of his NFL career. Amid that tension, a single comment shifted attention away from stats and contracts and toward the quieter forces shaping his decisions.While speaking to the media ahead of the Steelers’ matchup against the Ravens, Rodgers acknowledged that any decision about retirement would not be made alone. According to Daily Mail, he referenced his wife, Brittani, a figure who remains largely unknown even to those close to him.“I don't really want to get too deep into it, you know? Obviously, I'll talk to my wife and then, you know, hopefully that's a decision down the line, but I'm not really going to talk about anything.”The comment resonated because of its restraint. Rodgers did not frame Brittani as a public presence or a storyline. He framed her as a partner. The moment reinforced what he has consistently said about keeping his personal life protected after years of intense scrutiny during past high-profile relationships.Rodgers later explained that Brittani values privacy and never sought the spotlight. He confirmed in mid-2025 that they had married quietly months earlier and reiterated that she would only be seen publicly if she chose to be. Speaking on The Pat McAfee Show, he said, “If and when she [Brittani] wants to be out and there's a picture, she'll choose that.”Looking back, the moment stands as a reminder that even one of football’s most analyzed figures makes his biggest decisions off the field, guided by someone the world has never truly seen.Also Read: Aaron Rodgers’ wife mystery deepens as Brittani misses another Steelers WAG event",Aaron Rodgers linked retirement talks to his private marriage to Brittani.

While she has many ideas and loves wedding details, insiders say she is consciously holding back to avoid overstepping. Despite the challenge, she shares a strong, positive relationship with Swift and supports the couple’s choices.

Why Donna Kelce is choosing restraint over control

With the wedding buzz about Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift still taking up most of the pop culture, there is one individual quietly balancing the emotional aspect behind the scenes. At the beginning of 2026, a short-term shift away from the couple was that of Travis mother Donna Kelce, who has gained a fanbase due to her increasing presence on TV and her open reputation.With Donna appearing on The Traitors and her son facing a tough NFL season, sources suggested that wedding planning brought a different kind of challenge. Not conflict, but restraint. According to insiders, Donna has strong ideas, a big heart, and the awareness to step back when it matters most.A source close to Donna told Daily Mail that she has made a conscious effort to stay out of the decision-making process, even though it does not come easily. The insider said,“When it comes to the wedding, the planning is all on Taylor and Travis, not on Donna. I think her head knows that, even when her heart wants to be more involved. She told me she has to bite her tongue when it comes to the wedding plans because she has all sorts of ideas.Location, menu, the cake, the colors. She lives for that stuff. But she doesn't want to be overbearing; she doesn't want to overstep.”Despite holding back, the relationship between Donna and Swift is reportedly strong. Another source emphasized the lack of tension, saying,“I don't think there's been any friction at all. On the contrary, it's all good. But she just thinks about that wedding all the time.”Behind the scenes, Travis is said to be fully involved in planning alongside Swift, treating the process as a shared responsibility. Reports also suggest the couple has already secured a venue and set a June 13, 2026 date. Looking back, the story highlights not wedding drama, but a mother choosing grace, patience, and trust as her son builds a new chapter.Also Read: “Don’t get mad”: Travis Kelce’s mom Donna reveals how her future daughter-in-law Taylor Swift shaped her mindset","Donna Kelce is reportedly finding it difficult to stay on the sidelines as her son Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift plan their wedding.

The game tips off at 10:00 p.m. ET at the Golden 1 Center.The Lakers are trying to keep pace near the top of the West and avoid slip-ups against teams lower in the standings. The Kings are focused on staying competitive through a season disrupted by injuries. Even with missing players, division games tend to stay physical and direct.Los Angeles Lakers enters with a 23-13 record and has been dependable when favored, winning 15 of 20 games as moneyline favorites. Sacramento has struggled at 9-30, but playing at home gives them a chance to stay close early, especially if role players step up.The Lakers are listed as 9.5-point favorites. The over/under is set at 228.5, suggesting steady scoring from both teams.Sacramento Kings are without key starters. Domantas Sabonis remains out with a knee injury and is not expected back until late January.

Securing long-term wealth with the Philadelphia Phillies

Kyle‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ Schwarber has definitely seen his money increasing steadily during his professional baseball career, primarily as a result of the salaries and contracts from playing in the MLB. In fact, the Cubs gave him his start, but later he had a very meaningful time with the Phillies, and his income has therefore gone up a lot. To give you an idea, according to Baseball-Reference.com, Kyle Schwarber has raked in a whopping sum of $101,092,000 from his career earnings till 2025 not counting the 2026 ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌salary.Net worth estimates aren't usually shared in detail and can differ depending on the source. Some estimates use algorithms based on social factors, showing figures like $6.03 million in 2022, $7.04 million in 2023, $8.05 million in 2024, $9.05 million in 2025, and $10.1 million in 2026.Schwarber kicked off his MLB career when the Chicago Cubs picked him in the first round (4th overall) of the 2014 MLB June Amateur Draft, coming straight from Indiana University Bloomington.At first, his paychecks were pretty small, which is normal for a rookie and a pre-arbitration player, but his efforts played a big role in the Cubs clinching the 2016 World Series.In context, Schwarber was out for most of the 2016 season because of a torn ACL, but he made a stunning comeback in the World Series, batting .412 with seven hits in 17 at-bats. This impressive showing raised his profile, even though his pay was still at the entry-level.In 2021, Schwarber joined the Washington Nationals as a free agent on January 9, 2021, signing a one-year deal worth $7 million. This was his first experience with free agency and a chance to bounce back. Context: After the Cubs decided not to keep him, Schwarber teamed up with hitting coach Kevin Long in Washington, who assisted in fine-tuning his swing.Schwarber told MLB.com in a 2025 interview reflecting on his career: ""Long helped resurrect Schwarber’s career in Washington in 2021."" During the season, he was traded to the Boston Red Sox on July 29, 2021, and helped them in their playoff journey. With the Nationals, he earned a salary of $7,000,000. His total earnings amounted to $19,092,000.Schwarber's fortune took off when he inked a four-year, $79 million deal with the Philadelphia Phillies on March 16, 2022, which averages out to $19.75 million a year.This contract followed a solid 2021 season where he smashed 32 home runs between Washington and Boston.Phillies' baseball operations president, Dave Dombrowski, went after Schwarber because of his power and leadership qualities.His $19 million deal with the Phillies, along with a $3 million buyout from the Boston Red Sox, brings his total earnings to $41,092,000.Under the Phillies deal, Schwarber's pay stayed steady at $20 million each year, thanks to the back-loaded setup. He had his best season in 2025, hitting an NL-high 56 home runs and driving in 132 runs, which got him second in the NL MVP race, just behind Shohei Ohtani.In December 2025, Schwarber re-signed with the Phillies for a five-year deal worth $150 million, making it the biggest contract ever for a full-time designated hitter, according to CBS Sports. Here are the details from On Pattison: a signing bonus of $15 million; salaries of $15 million in 2026 and $30 million each year from 2027 to 2030.Regarding the luxury tax, the AAV stands at $30 million. Context: During the Winter Meetings in Orlando, Florida, Schwarber opted for Philadelphia instead of accepting similar offers from the Baltimore Orioles and other teams. In 2026: $30,000,000 ($15 million salary + $15 million bonus).

Erika Kirk faces mixed reactions online after Peach Bowl appearance following Charlie Kirk’s death

Erika Kirk is once again facing heavy criticism on social media. This time, fans lashed out after she was seen attending the Peach Bowl in Atlanta without her children. The college football semifinal took place on January 10, 2025, and photos of Erika at the game went viral.Soon after the pictures went viral, many people began asking why she chose to attend a public sports event instead of staying home with her kids. The comments grew louder because this came months after her husband, Charlie Kirk, was assassinated. Critics questioned her parenting choices and said they had not seen her children with her in public for a long time.As the posts kept circulating, social media users shared strong opinions. Some questioned her priorities and wrote negative things, while others defended her, saying grief looks different for everyone. Erika Kirk has not responded to the criticism so far.The backlash mostly came from users on X, formerly known as Twitter. Many questioned Erika Kirk’s absence from her children during public outings.One user wrote, “Is she ever with her kids?”Another tweet said, “Erika’s kids lost a devoted father and the mother is everywhere but home.I pray for her kids dada.”A different user added, “I haven’t seen Erika with her kids since Charlie died.”More comments followed the same tone. One person wrote, “This is so not normal behavior for someone that just lost her husband and the father of her children.”Another said, “The way her very young children who recently lost their dad are literally never with her.”At the same time, many users came forward to support Erika Kirk. Some reminded others that everyone handles grief in their own way. Others pointed out that she may be trying to protect her children from public attention and media focus.The criticism also connects to Erika Kirk’s past public statements. According to The 19th, she spoke at the Young Women’s Leadership Summit in June 2025. During her speech, she talked about traditional gender roles in Christian marriages.She said, “The enemy loves to make you feel like you’re running out of time, but you can always have a career; it is not going anywhere.”She also added, “But children, family, your husband, marriages, that is not a renewable resource.”Erika also stated, “Don’t delay the eternal for the temporary, and do not sacrifice the sacred for the secular; it is not worth it.”During Charlie Kirk’s eulogy, she told women that being a mother “is the single most important ministry you have.”She also shared that she was raised by a single mother who taught her independence, but meeting Charlie Kirk changed her views.Erika said, “When you meet the right man, everything shifts, everything changes. When I met Charlie, that was it.”She added, “I could care less about the career. Motherhood is not a pause, it’s a launchpad.”Charlie Kirk once said on The Charlie Kirk Show that Erika was more conservative than him. As of now, Erika Kirk has not made any statement about the latest online backlash.Also Read: Candace Owens Raises New Questions About Charlie Kirk After Revealing A Never Before Seen Image With No Visible Blood","Erika Kirk was seen attending the Peach Bowl in Atlanta without her children.

Left-hander Ranger Suárez is drawing strong interest, with projections suggesting a deal that could land in the $160-200 million range.This is not a trade situation. Ranger Suárez is under contract with the Philadelphia Phillies through 2025. The discussion centers on what happens once he reaches the open market. The Giants are viewed as a serious contender, with the financial space to compete against teams like the New York Mets and Baltimore Orioles.San Francisco Giants have leaned on short-term pitching options such as Adrian Houser and Tyler Mahle. A long-term deal for Suárez would be a clear change in direction. Despite past hesitation around nine-figure contracts, the Giants are expected to be aggressive if they believe the fit is right.Suárez would likely slot near the top of the rotation behind Logan Webb. His groundball-heavy approach suits Oracle Park, where limiting home runs is critical. The Giants’ 2025 rotation struggled with injuries and uneven production, and Suárez offers stability.From the Phillies’ side, letting Suárez walk would not be a sign of retreat. With Andrew Painter nearing a full-time role, the team can afford to lose a veteran arm. They would gain draft compensation and free up payroll to address other needs without moving players in a trade.At age 30, Ranger Suárez is entering the most valuable stretch of his career. A six- to eight-year deal would provide long-term security. A move to San Francisco Giants also removes some of the pressure that comes with pitching in Philadelphia, while keeping him on a competitive team.There are concerns about a drop in velocity, which could affect durability over a long contract. Still, compared to higher-priced alternatives, Ranger Suárez offers consistency and fit.Also read: MLB trade rumors: Pittsburgh Pirates could sign $66 million ex-Cincinnati Reds star to bolster rotation and improve title odds If this signing happens, the San Francisco Giants would gain the most by adding a reliable starter to a thin rotation.

Giannis Antetokounmpo explains the hardship of the 65-game rule

When is Nikola Jokic returning?

The Milwaukee Bucks faced the Denver Nuggets on January 11, 2026. Even without their star player, Nikola Jokic, the team managed to rack up a 4-point lead. Jokic has been missing the last few games owing to his left knee injury. His absence has raised the debate over his eligibility for the postseason awards and accolades this year, as the minimum eligibility criteria is 65 games. On average, each team plays 82 games.Before the Bucks vs. the Nuggets game, NBA star Giannis Antetokounmpo was asked to address the 65-game rule. The power forward gave a rather honest reply about how hard it is to reach the threshold of 64 games. According to the athlete, the margin of error is really less. One serious injury might lead to a season-long ejection.As the Milwaukee Bucks prepared to face the Denver Nuggets, Giannis Antetokounmpo was asked about his opinion on the 65-game rule. He replied, “I will be honest with you. Like 13 years of me being in the league, I think I have played 65 games every year. I am still on track. I think I am gonna still play 65 games.” While being confident about his roadmap this season, the athlete reveals the hardships behind the rule.He continued, “It's hard. If you want to be a really good player, help your team get deep in the playoffs and then come back at it and then again play 65 games, you do it for a couple of years. Because I have been All-NBA for 9 years in a row. 7 times first team and putting a rule in there does give a break.”Giannis further added, “The margin of error is hard. Like, you get one injury and you are off the race.” The athlete believed that while he was determined to complete 65 games, he might not make it in the end. He mentioned a few other players, including Victor Wembanyama, who might not qualify for the postseason awards due to the rule. While initially, the Bucks' power forward was all for it at a younger age, he is not that supportive of the rule now that he is growing older. In the end, Giannis, however, acknowledged the importance of these rules and why they should exist.Nikola Jokic has been left with a left knee hyperextension. Owing to this injury, the player will be away for 4 weeks. The athlete suffered the injury in a game against the Miami Heat team when Spencer Jones stepped on him accidentally. Ever since, he has missed quite a few games. While the team is being carried forward by the young members, concerns have been raised for Jokic regarding his postseason awards and accolades. His return timeline is still uncertain.","NBA star Giannis Antetokounmpo was asked to address the 65-game rule.

Who is Rick Bowness, the new Columbus Blue Jackets head coach?



Rick Bowness set to start his tenure at Columbus at a moment when urgency has replaced patience inside the Blue Jackets organization. The season has slipped away faster than anyone in the front office expected. Columbus sits at the bottom of the Metropolitan Division, leaking goals and confidence with equal speed. What makes the move sting more is the contrast to last year, when optimism returned and playoff hopes lasted deep into spring. This time, results fell short of internal standards, forcing management to act before the standings became impossible to climb.With 37 games still on the schedule, the Blue Jackets chose experience over experimentation. Dean Evason and assistant Steve McCarthy were relieved of their duties, and the franchise turned to a familiar NHL name to steady a drifting ship. The decision signals a belief that the roster is not broken beyond repair, but rather in need of structure, accountability, and calm leadership during a turbulent stretch.Rick Bowness arrives in Columbus with nearly four decades of professional hockey behind him and a reputation built on resilience.At 70, he is one of the rare coaches whose career spans five different NHL decades, a testament to adaptability. Bowness was head coach of the Jets in 1988-89. He also coached the Boston Bruins (1991-92), Ottawa Senators (1992-96), New York Islanders (1996-98), Phoenix Coyotes (2003-04), Dallas Stars (2019-21), and Jets (2022-24).As an assistant in Vancouver, Tampa Bay, and Dallas, Bowness became trusted for his defensive structure and steady presence. That trust paid off in Dallas, where he took over midseason and guided the Stars to the Stanley Cup Final in 2020. Even in defeat, his leadership earned respect across the league.His most recent stop in Winnipeg shows his ceiling. In the 2023-24 season, the Jets posted a 52-win campaign, the strongest record of his head coaching career. That run reaffirmed his ability to connect with modern players while demanding discipline in all three zones. He went 310-408 with 48 overtime/shootout losses and 37 ties as a head coach.For Columbus, Bowness brings clarity more than promises. His career record reflects hardship as much as success, but it also reflects survival in one of sports’ most unforgiving environments. The Blue Jackets are betting that his experience, voice, and calm authority can halt the slide and reset standards before the season slips beyond reach.Also Read: NHL insider explains how a shifting buyer-seller market impacts Sidney Crosby and Erik Karlsson’s future","Rick Bowness is the new head coach of the Columbus Blue Jackets.

How Virat Kohli gets ready before batting - WATCH



NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli continues to be in sublime form, doing what he does best — arriving at the crease, settling in quickly, unfurling his trademark cover and straight drives, and piling on the runs. In the first ODI of the three-match series, Kohli, who has already retired from T20Is and Tests, struck a fluent 93 off 91 deliveries as India chased down a target of 301 to seal a four-wicket victory and take a 1-0 lead in the series.During the knock, Kohli achieved two significant milestones, becoming the fastest player to reach 28,000 international runs across formats and moving to second place on the list of highest run-scorers in international cricket, behind Sachin Tendulkar.A video shot by a fan during the match has since gone viral on social media, offering a glimpse into Kohli’s pre-batting routine. The footage shows Kohli padding up moments after Rohit Sharma’s dismissal, spraying perfume over himself, applying lotion on his hands, grabbing a quick bite, slipping on his gloves and immediately walking out to bat — all completed within seconds.Kohli looked well set for a record-extending 54th ODI century in the series opener on Sunday but fell seven runs short of the landmark when he was caught at mid-off for 93 by a towering New Zealand bowler.Having faced Kohli both as a rival and a teammate, New Zealand all-rounder Kyle Jamieson said he remains in awe of the Indian great’s batting, describing him as someone who operates at a completely different level.Jamieson, who has shared the Royal Challengers Bengaluru dressing room with Kohli in the IPL, admitted it is difficult to judge whether the Indian batter is currently at his peak.""It's hard to say from an opposition point of view whether this is the best version of him or not -- he's been pretty good for a long time, right?,"" Jamieson told the media after Sunday's loss.The second ODI of the series will be played on Wednesday at the Niranjan Shah Stadium in Rajkot.","Virat Kohli hits 93 off 91 deliveries as India beat New Zealand by four wickets.

Bangladesh seek T20 WC match shift from India after Mustafizur Rahman's IPL exit

Afghanistan all-rounder Mohammad Nabi cut a visibly irritated figure during a post-match press conference in the Bangladesh Premier League after being questioned about the growing controversy involving Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman and Kolkata Knight Riders. Nabi, who is representing Noakhali Express in the BPL, made it clear that the issue had nothing to do with him and shut down the line of questioning immediately.The flashpoint stems from KKR releasing Mustafizur despite having secured him for INR 9.20 crore at the December 2025 IPL auction. The decision came after a directive from the BCCI , amid heightened political and diplomatic tensions between India and Bangladesh. Mustafizur was the only Bangladesh player picked in the auction, with KKR beating Chennai Super Kings and Delhi Capitals to his signature before being forced to let him go.Asked to comment on the situation, Nabi refused to be drawn in. “Iska merese kya lena dena bhai. Mera Mustafizur se kya kaam hai? Politics me kya kaam hai mera?” he said. “I know he is a good bowler, all these things. But the way you are questioning, it's not related to me.”The controversy has also spilled into the international arena, with the Bangladesh Cricket Board writing to the ICC requesting that their T20 World Cup matches be moved out of India, citing security concerns. The 20-team tournament is scheduled to be held across India and Sri Lanka from February 7 to March 8, with Bangladesh set to play three matches in Kolkata and Mumbai.

Harshit Rana press conference: 'Team wants to groom me as an all-rounder'

NEW DELHI: Shreyas Iyer will walk out to bat in the second ODI against New Zealand on Wednesday with history firmly within touching distance, as the India vice-captain stands on the verge of a massive personal milestone that underlines his growing stature in the format.Iyer needs just 34 runs to etch his name into the record books, a feat that would place him among the quickest Indians to reach 3000 runs in ODI cricket and further highlight his transformation into one of India’s most reliable middle-order batters. Presently, the record for the fastest Indian to the landmark is held by Shikhar Dhawan, who achieved it in 72 innings, followed by Virat Kohli, who took 75 innings. Iyer, who has 2966 runs to his name, will reach the milestone in just 69 innings if he scores the required runs on Wednesday.The right-hander marked his return to international cricket in style in the series opener on Sunday, scoring a fluent 49 off 47 balls as India successfully chased down a target of 301. It was a reassuring comeback after a frustrating injury layoff that began during the third ODI against Australia on October 25, 2025, forcing him to miss the home series against South Africa.Iyer worked his way back through the BCCI Centre of Excellence and proved his readiness with strong performances for Mumbai in the Vijay Hazare Trophy before reclaiming his place in the national side.Since making his ODI debut in 2017, Iyer has steadily evolved from a promising talent into a mainstay of India’s XI and a key member of the leadership group. Should he achieve the milestone in the second ODI, Iyer will also join West Indies great Viv Richards as the joint-fourth fastest batter overall to the mark, with the all-time record belonging to South Africa’s Hashim Amla, who reached it in just 57 innings.","Shreyas Iyer needs just 34 runs to reach 3000 runs in ODI cricket.

Poll What do you think of the Bazball approach in Test cricket? It is innovative and exciting It has lost its effectiveness It's too risky for Test matches

NEW DELHI: Batting legend Sunil Gavaskar launched a scathing broadside against Ben Stokes ’ England after their crushing 4-1 defeat in the 2025–26 Ashes series in Australia, branding the visitors “paper tigers” and declaring that the much-hyped Bazball approach has well and truly lost its edge.England’s tour ended in disappointment despite a solitary consolation win — their first Test victory in Australia in 14 years — which came only after the Ashes urn had already slipped beyond reach. The series was effectively decided in just 11 days, with England losing the opening three Tests in Perth, Brisbane and Adelaide.Writing in his column for Sportstar, Gavaskar said neutral fans had not expected much from England, given how unforgiving Australian conditions can be. However, he took sharp aim at the English media for relentlessly hyping the side despite clear warning signs.“England’s performances in most sports are a huge let-down when set against the write-ups their teams receive from people who have hardly, if ever, played any sport at the highest level,” Gavaskar wrote. “The disappointment, therefore, is far greater when the teams show that they are more paper tigers than real ones.”Gavaskar added that England’s heavy Ashes defeat did not come as a shock outside the country. “England’s capitulation to Australia by a 4–1 margin was, therefore, not really a surprise for the non-English. It is extremely tough for visiting teams to win a Test series anywhere, especially in Australia and India,” he noted, while also pointing out that even India have suffered overseas setbacks in recent years.The former opener acknowledged that Brendon McCullum and Stokes had initially brought freshness after the New Zealander took over as Test coach in 2022, helping England win series against New Zealand and Pakistan. But Gavaskar argued that Bazball’s novelty quickly faded.“Gone was the dreary, dull cricket they played, and suddenly, the opposition did not know how to counter it. However, as with so-called mystery bowlers, the surprise wore off,” he wrote. “Once teams realised that England had little answer whenever the ball deviated, provided the pitches were not flat, the problems became evident.”Gavaskar was particularly critical of England’s batting mindset and lack of accountability. “With their media making excuses for them about pitches when they were overseas, the batters refused to change their approach and bat according to the situation,” he said, adding that only Joe Root consistently valued his wicket.He concluded with a damning assessment of England’s much-celebrated style. “What the media calls fearless cricket today often looks more like couldn’t-care-less cricket,” Gavaskar wrote, before posing a blunt question: “How many in the England team that lost the Ashes series can put their hands on their hearts and say that they gave it everything — not just physically but, more crucially, temperamentally?”",Sunil Gavaskar slams England after their crushing 4-1 defeat in the 2025–26 Ashes series in Australia.

Why did it take so long for Red Wings to retire Sergei Fedorov’s No. 91?

Hey Hockeytown: A Letter from Sergei Fedorov

The Detroit Red Wings and Sergei Fedorov are finally sealing the fate of the period, which was the hallmark of an entire generation of NHL hockey. The jersey of the superstar Fedorov, number 91, will be retired by the franchise on Monday night at Little Caesars Arena, a moment that many fans have doubted would ever come to be. For Detroit, the ceremony is not just an honor but a wish to publicly recognize a player through whose impact the organization triumphed, gained cultural acceptance, and acquired global popularity.Fedorov’s tenure in the Red Wings was a mix of events that were both wonderful and complicated. He was selected in the 1989 draft during the Soviet era, when such players were considered highly speculative in terms of their playing ability, but Fedorov turned out to be the most scintillating and productive two-way forward in the NHL. Detroit won three Stanley Cups with his support, and in 1994, he won the Hart Trophy.As per NHL.com and Mike Ilitch's old interviews, the trust was broken because of the delay and not the on-ice performance. Fedorov and the management of Detroit had a strained relationship during the contract negotiations twice. The worst was after the 2002 Stanley Cup. Fedorov rejected a long-term deal and became a free agent, opting for Anaheim instead of Detroit.His move hurt the organization a lot more than he might have thought. Loyalty was one of the core values the organization had.They say that emotions were very high during the players’ and even the management’s turmoil. Detroit fans booed the star player during his first games back in the city. Nevertheless, time changed the approach. Fedorov kept coming back to Detroit and was grateful behind the scenes for the role the city played in his career. A video made available by the team recently featured him saying, “I made a wrong decision to leave,” and calling it his greatest regret.The combination of that truthfulness and a new generation of leaders was the opening. The current president of the team, Christopher Ilitch, personally contacted Fedorov to inform him of the honor.While jersey No. 91 is being retired, Detroit is not changing the past – it is just completing the story. Fedorov's era, difficult but also unforgettable, now has the ending it has been longing for all along.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky vs Connor McDavid: Net Worth, Cars, Lifestyle, and Legacy Compared","Sergei Fedorov's No. 91 jersey will be retired by the Detroit Red Wings on Monday night.

George Kittle has been a very strong physical player for the 49ers and has proved to be a shining star for the team. There are so few tight ends in the NFL right now who play with his level of power, speed, and dedication to the game. However, he has faced several injuries and setbacks over the years of varying degrees, even missing games due to them.From college to the pros, injuries have followed Kittle at nearly every stage. Despite that, his enthusiasm and love for the game have always pushed him harder and led him to return to it as soon as he was able to. Unfortunately, the Achilles injury he suffered during the 2026 playoffs proved to be the most damaging, raising questions about his availability this year.Here is a timeline of Kittle’s significant injuries throughout his career from 2016 to 2026:: Before the NFL, Kittle’s injury history began at Iowa, where he suffered a foot sprain in October during his senior year. The injury benched him for the rest of the season, causing him to miss two games.: Entering his rookie year with the 49ers, Kittle dealt with a hamstring injury during training camp. He missed about a week but was ready for Week 1 of that season.Later in the season, a sprained ankle forced him to miss one game before returning and finishing the year.: A preseason shoulder A/C joint separation raised early concern for the tight end. Fortunately for San Francisco, tests showed no structural damage, allowing Kittle to play in the season opener and avoid missed games.: Kittle experienced his first notable regular-season absence after spraining his knee against the Cardinals that year. Unfortunately, he ended up missing two games: This year proved to be a serious test for the tight end. A sprained MCL in Week 1 sidelined him briefly for the season. He returned with a massive performance on ""Sunday Night Football"" against the Eagles, only to later fracture his foot. That injury landed him on injured reserve for the first time and cost him nearly two months.: After the 49ers’ loss to the Packers in Week 3 of the season, a calf strain became serious enough to require another IR stint for the tight end. But he returned in November and managed to do six catches for 101 yards and a touchdown.: A groin strain forced him to miss two early-season games that year. It was a problem that would linger into the following year.: Groin issues followed Kittle throughout the season, from training camp through November. He played through the discomfort but eventually needed surgery after the season ended.: Hamstring problems continued to haunt Kittle as he missed one game early in the season and another later on, continuing a pattern of short but recurring absences.: A Grade 3 torn hamstring in Week 1 led to a five-game absence, his longest since 2020. Later that season, a left ankle sprain caused him to miss another game.: The Wild Card game against the Eagles proved to be the most damaging for Kittle, as he was carted off with an Achilles injury. The diagnosis put his postseason on hold, and it has cast doubt over his appearance in the regular 2026.Also read: George Kittle injury sparks panic in San Francisco as tight end leaves Eagles game on a cart","George Kittle has been a very strong physical player for the 49ers.

LeSean McCoy says he’s heard Jalen Hurts is limiting the Eagles’ offense after playoff loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/lesean-mccoy-says-hes-heard-jalen-hurts-is-limiting-the-eagles-offense-after-playoff-loss/articleshow/126492042.cms,"(Image via Perry Knotts via Getty Images)

What LeSean McCoy actually said about Jalen Hurts



“a lot of digging”

“The problem is, we can’t do different exotic looks, different formations, different motions,”

Former Philadelphia Eagles running back LeSean McCoy has sparked fresh debate around Jalen Hurts and the team’s offensive approach after making pointed comments about what he believes is holding the Eagles back. Speaking publicly after Philadelphia’s playoff loss, McCoy suggested that the offense’s lack of creativity may be tied to Hurts’ ability to handle more complex looks, a claim he says is based on conversations with people close to the situation.McCoy made the remarks during a recent media appearance, where he claimed he had doneinto the Eagles’ offensive struggles. According to McCoy, people he spoke to suggested that the team avoids running more exotic formations, motions, and looks because Hurts allegedly struggles with them.McCoy said, adding that he was “hearing” Hurts “can’t really do it.” McCoy did not identify his sources and emphasized that his comments were based on what he had been told rather than first-hand knowledge.McCoy’s comments tie into a broader criticism that has followed the Eagles in recent weeks that the offense has become predictable.According to him, varied formations makes it easier for opposing defenses to prepare especially in high-stakes games.McCoy suggested that the issue is not just play-calling creativity but what the coaching staff feels comfortable asking its quarterback to execute. He framed the situation as a limitation rather than a refusal, implying that coaches may be simplifying the offense to avoid mistakes.Philadelphia’s offense has faced criticism for stagnation particularly in big games and questions about scheme flexibility have been widely discussed. However, offensive design is influenced by many factors, including coaching philosophy, game planning, injuries, and personnel not solely quarterback capability.Hurts has previously operated complex offenses at both the college and NFL levels, making McCoy’s claim a talking point rather than a settled conclusion. Analysts remain divided on whether the Eagles’ predictability stems from system choices or execution issues.As of now, neither the Eagles organization nor Jalen Hurts has responded publicly to McCoy’s remarks. There has been no official confirmation that Hurts is unable to handle more advanced formations or motion-heavy schemes.McCoy’s remarks come at a time when the Eagles are already facing scrutiny following their playoff exit. Whether the team adjusts its offensive approach moving forward will depend on coaching decisions and roster planning not outside commentary.Also read - Who is Beckett DeJean, the brother of Eagles star Cooper DeJean and why was he arrested in Iowa?",Former Philadelphia Eagles running back LeSean McCoy has sparked fresh debate around Jalen Hurts and the team's offensive approach.

Walker Kessler is out for the season with a shoulder injury. Georges Niang remains sidelined with a foot problem. Jusuf Nurkic is listed as probable while dealing with a toe issue. Ace Bailey is questionable because of hip soreness. Lauri Markkanen is resting as part of workload management.Cleveland Cavaliers have injuries of its own, though they are less damaging. Dean Wade is out with a knee injury. Larry Nance Jr. is sidelined due to a calf issue. Max Strus is also out with a foot injury.Even so, Cleveland’s core rotation remains intact.The game will be played Monday, January 12, at 7:00 PM ET at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse.

Donovan Mitchell leads the team with 26.0 points per game, while Darius Garland averages 17.1 points and 6.3 assists. Cleveland’s balance on both ends of the floor has kept them among the league’s best.Cleveland opens as a 13.5-point favorite with a projected total of 250.5. Utah’s lack of size puts pressure on players like Kyle Filipowski to handle a difficult matchup inside. If Ace Bailey does not play, Utah’s perimeter defense could struggle, especially against Mitchell in transition.For Utah to stay close, they will need an efficient shooting night and fewer mistakes. Otherwise, this game is set up for Cleveland to control from early on.","The Utah Jazz visit the Cleveland Cavaliers on January 12, 2026, with the two teams moving in very different directions.

From Tampa Bay to retirement and the income shift that followed

When Tom Brady packed up and left the New England Patriots for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2020, it felt risky in every sense. He was in his forties, stepping away from the only franchise he had ever known, and walking into a league that was rapidly getting younger. Financially, though, Brady was already secure. His net worth at that point was estimated, according to Forbes, at around $250 million, built slowly through years of contracts that were rarely the biggest on the market, combined with endorsements and long-term brand deals.ID@undefinedCaption not available.Then Tampa happened. Winning a Super Bowl in his first season with the Buccaneers did more than add another ring. It reshaped how Brady was viewed, not just as a quarterback, but as a business asset. He proved he could win outside the Patriots system, and that mattered enormously for his value off the field. By the end of the 2020 season, his earning power had grown, even though his paycheck had not dramatically changed.In 2021, Brady kept going. He played at an elite level, stayed visible, and remained relevant in a league that usually moves on quickly.His net worth rose to around $260 million, driven less by football salary and more by the fact that his brand refused to fade. While younger quarterbacks were signing massive contracts early in their careers, Brady was showing that staying power could be just as valuable. By 2022, his final season in the NFL, Brady’s net worth reached roughly $280 million, according to Investopedia..His total career salary had crossed the $330 million mark according to Spotrac, but the bigger story was what came next. Retirement did not mean slowing down but shifting gears.In 2023, Brady walked away from the game knowing exactly what came next. He was done taking hits, but he wasn’t stepping into the unknown. His long-term broadcasting deal meant the paychecks would keep coming, just without the wear and tear of another NFL season. By then, his net worth had climbed to around $300 million, and that was before he had fully settled into life after football.Over 2024 and 2025, the money side of his career stayed steady and kept moving upward. Instead of game checks, Brady’s income came from business ventures, endorsements, and ownership stakes.By 2026, Brady’s net worth is between $300 million and $350 million approximately, depending on how his investments and businesses are valued.Compared to today’s quarterback model, the contrast is clear. Players like Patrick Mahomes of the Kansas City Chiefs locked in generational wealth early. Brady took a slower, more patient route. From Tampa Bay to retirement, Brady’s money story mirrors his career. He did not chase quick wins. He built something designed to last long after the final whistle.Also read: Jacoby Brissett’s current net worth: Inside the career earnings of the NFL quarterback who turned opportunity into millions","Tom Brady left the New England Patriots for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2020.

What happens to LeBron James’ jersey patch after each game and what it could signal about his NBA future

LeBron James, whose NBA career began in 2003, will wear a slightly different Los Angeles Lakers suit on Monday when he plays in the city. In honor of James' record-breaking 23rd NBA season, a patch with a silhouette of his pregame chalk toss and three cultured stripes symbolizing the teams he has played for in Cleveland, Miami, and Los Angeles would be applied to the top right chest of his jersey, an insider told ESPN.This is because Topps and James are collaborating to make some unique relic cards. James will have a unique memorial patch on his uniform, the firm revealed on Monday. Certain inserts will use some of the patches commemorating his 23rd NBA season.LeBron James' outfit will differ slightly from his teammates' when he plays for the Los Angeles Lakers tonight. In honour of his record-breaking 23rd NBA season, James will make his jersey patch debut on Monday night against the Sacramento Kings.An outline of James performing his trademark pregame ""chalk toss"" may be seen in the center. In addition, James' patch will eventually be included on Topps trading cards. The three NBA teams James has played for, the Lakers, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Miami Heat, are represented by the decal's four distinct colors.The patch also prominently features the number 23, which stands for the amount of years James has played in the NBA.Additionally, James will be returning to the place where he played his first NBA regular season game on October 29, 2023, on this occasion.LeBron will wear the patch for the Lakers' last 46 games, according to ESPN's Dave McMenamin. With a current season record of 23–13, LA sits in fifth place in the fiercely competitive Western Conference.Topps trading cards are increasingly featuring unique jersey patches. Each rookie is given a debut patch by the Fanatics-owned company, and NBA and MLB award winners are honored with a gold logoman.In 2024, LeBron agreed to an exclusive trading card contract with Topps. Future trading cards will now feature his new jersey patch.Staff members of the Lakers will take off the patch after every game and record it on camera by date. After that, the patch will be shipped to a Topps manufacturing facility so it can be utilised in future cards. We're going to assume that once the cards are out, they'll be in high demand.James broke the record for the most NBA seasons played in November. James beat NBA Hall of Famer Vince Carter, who played in 22 NBA seasons, despite missing the first 14 games of the season due to sciatica.James has not stated whether his 23rd NBA season will be his final one. The superstar's career is almost over, but depending on how this year goes, he might decide to play another season.

Where Joel Embiid’s Season Stands

for theagainst the Toronto Raptors on. The team has ruled him out due to left knee injury management and soreness in his left groin. His absence will end a six-game stretch, which had been his longest run of games this season.Philadelphia has continued to take a careful approach with Embiid’s health. His availability has been limited for much of the year, and the team has avoided pushing him during tight stretches on the schedule. While his impact is clear when he plays, the Sixers have adjusted to long periods without him.Joel Embiid was first listed as questionable because of his knee. Later in the day, groin soreness became a concern, and the team downgraded him to out. The decision followed a familiar pattern this season, with swelling and soreness continuing after his previous surgery.Embiid has appeared in only 19 games so far. The six-game stretch he recently completed was his longest since January 2024. Philadelphia has made it clear that protecting him for later in the season remains the priority.The game comes on the second night of a back-to-back road set. On January 11, the Philadelphia 76ers lost 116-115 in overtime, also without Joel Embiid. Despite that loss, they enter the January 12 matchup with a 21-15 record and a four-game road winning streak.Philadelphia has managed to stay competitive without its center. The team is 10-6 in games Embiid has missed. Tyrese Maxey and Paul George have carried more responsibility, particularly on offense, helping the Sixers stay afloat.Toronto is also short-handed. Jakob Poeltl was out with a back injury, and RJ Barrett missed the game due to an ankle issue. Brandon Ingram and Scottie Barnes are both listed as questionable.The Raptors still lean on home court, especially after Barnes decided the previous meeting at the free-throw line. Without Embiid, Toronto face less pressure inside, where his scoring and presence usually force defensive adjustments.In his 19 appearances, Joel Embiid is averaging 23.5 points and 7.1 rebounds. Over his last five games, his combined production in points, rebounds, and assists has remained high, and his shooting efficiency has stayed strong. At the same time, his movement has not looked the same as during his MVP season.Also read: Philadelphia 76ers vs Toronto Raptors injury report: Injured and questionable players, where to watch, team stats, and more (January 12, 2026) Philadelphia 76ers have shown they can survive without him, but the numbers also highlight what the team loses.
