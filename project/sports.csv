He is a kid, for God's sake!! Let him grow!! If u can't tolerate a kid, imagine the society still tolerating many nut cases like the ones commenting on this kid and much more!!!!!!""The controversy has led to broader discussions about the nature of social media criticism, particularly when directed at minors appearing on television shows.The incident has also highlighted the challenges faced by young participants in reality television shows and the public scrutiny they encounter.Social media users have praised Amitabh Bachchan's composed handling of the situation during the show's recording.","A fifth-grade student from Gandhinagar, Gujarat, Ishit Bhatt, appeared on Kaun Banega Crorepati 17 hosted by Amitabh Bachchan.

Bihar Polls: UP CM Yogi Adityanath Accuses RJD, Congress of ‘Mischief’ Over Burqa Verification Order

NEW DLEHI: Janhit Janata Dal (JJD) chief and Lalu Yadav ’s elder son Tej Pratap Yadav , who is set to contest from Mahua constituency in the upcoming Bihar Assembly elections , filed his nomination on Thursday accompanied by a roadshow and carrying a photo of his grandmother Marchiya Devi.Speaking to reporters, he said the occasion was significant for him as he had moved ahead with the blessings of his grandmother and parents.""I have moved ahead with the blessings of my grandmother and my parents. On this auspicious occasion, as I am required to file my nomination, I have brought my grandmother with me. She lives on in our hearts... People of Mahua will support whoever works for them. I worked to make Mahua a district and also give employment opportunities to the youth,"" Tej Pratap said, as quoted by ANI.Tej Pratap, who currently represents Hasanpur, had earlier served as Mahua MLA from 2015 to 2020. The seat is now held by RJD’s Mukesh Kumar Raushan.The JJD, which Tej Pratap floated after his expulsion from the RJD earlier this year, has announced 22 candidates in its first list for the assembly elections scheduled for November. His expulsion from the party followed a controversy involving a social media post where he claimed to be in a long-term relationship.Tej Pratap had later stated that his account was hacked.His strained ties with his family have played out publicly in recent months. On October 12, he unfollowed his younger brother and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav on X. He had earlier unfollowed his sisters Misa Bharti and Hema Yadav. He now follows only five accounts, including his father Lalu Prasad Yadav, mother Rabri Devi, and sister Raj Lakshmi Yadav.Despite family tensions, Tej Pratap’s sister Rohini Acharya extended her support to him with a message on X: ""May you achieve all the success and happiness in the world, and may you always move forward like a shining light, brother. Wishing you all the very best... with love and blessings.""It makes an interesting twist in the Yadav family dynamics, as last month Rohini Acharya did something similar to his elder brother Tej Pratap when she unfollowed RJD, and Tejaswi Yadav from her social media accounts. The increasing rifts between family members playing out in public are often attributed to sudden importance given to Sanjay Yadav, a close friend to Tejaswi.On being asked about the grandmother and Acharya he said, ""I brought the photo of my grandmother Marchiya Devi in the nomination. With her blessing, I am going to win in Mahua. The Janshakti Janata Dal is going to win. Rohini Acharya called me, she extended her good wishes.""The Bihar Assembly elections will take place in two phases on November 6 and November 11, with counting scheduled for November 14. The main contest is expected between the NDA alliance led by BJP-JD(U) and the INDIA bloc led by RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav. JJD is among the new entrants in the fray, alongside Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj, which has announced plans to contest all 243 seats.",Lalu Yadav's elder son Tej Pratap Yadav filed his nomination for Bihar Assembly elections.

prowess and combat

Each Mega Evolution's ranking in this tier list emphasizes its offensive and defensive capabilities in battles. Accordingly, their base stats were evaluated, alongside their type advatanges, their movepool, and overall damage output. Megas with better type coverage, damage metrics, and versatility received higher rankings.

Availability and accessibility

Another essential factor for ranking the Mega Evolutions in Pokemon Legends: Z-A was the ease of obtaining them. Megas available earlier in the game or through common Pokemon receive higher rankings than those requiring late-game progression or rare encounters. This ensures that you actually end up using the Megas during your playthrough.

Typing

Lastly, the strategic value of each Mega's typing combination and the roles it can fulfill within team compositions affects this ranking. The Evolutions that offer better coverage options, defensive typing, or filling team gaps receive a higher position. In the meantime, those Pokemon with limited strategic flexibility rank lower.

Pokemon Legends: Z-A is finally here, and it has resulted in the introduction of several new Mega Evolutions. From classics like Starmie to legendary ones like Zygarde, these Mega Evolutions are unique and add a lot of depth to the game.In this article, we provide you with a tier list, ranking the different Mega Evolutions in Pokemon Legends: Z-A.

She said,""I'll speak for myself when I say that the decisions that he was making hurt me about his cancer. It felt like, 'Oh, you're trying to kill me. And I'm going to be alone raising these kids. It's a very selfish response that I had, and it caused all kinds of problems, but [so did] his need for secrecy about his cancer decisions. It just starts sowing the seeds of distrust.""After coming across the life-threatening tumor in Wade’s kidney, Gabrielle Union felt as if the NBA icon was almost near to death. She explained that the Miami Heat's alum was trying to leave her behind all alone raising the kids herself. The uncertainty of Wade's Cancer diagnosis left her in a mentally wretched state.

When you mention year nine being hard, he hadn’t revealed his cancer diagnosis and his own cancer journey, so now we can put it in more context.”She further elaborated,""Obviously him getting that diagnosis was traumatic for him: Being faced with your own mortality in your early 40s, and you’re like, ‘Am I going to be here to see my family? Who am I without this big life, and without this healthy body? But you also don’t understand the journey and the toll that it takes on your marriage, on your family, on your kids.”After being married for 11 long years, Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union share a daughter named Kaavia via surrogacy.

Has anyone seen or met Aaron Rodgers’ wife, Brittani yet? The answer is NO



Aaron Rodgers says his wife changed his life



The Pittsburgh Steelers are into another primetime clash, this time against the Cincinnati Bengals, as Aaron Rodgers leads the team atop the AFC North. But while fans are eager to see the 42-year-old quarterback on the field, they’re equally curious about something he refuses to reveal — his mysterious wife, Brittani. Despite the spotlight on him, Rodgers has kept his marriage completely hidden from public view.When Rodgers signed his one-year, $13.6 million contract with the Steelers in June, the wedding band on his finger instantly caught attention. Yet, months later, not a single photo or public appearance of his wife has surfaced. There’s no marriage license on record, no social media traces, and not even teammates’ spouses have met her. Brittani’s identity remains a complete enigma.Rodgers first mentioned her last December while still playing for the New York Jets, telling The Pat McAfee Show that he was in a serious relationship. However, Jets players’ wives, including Maranda Williams and Jessie Vera-Tucker, later confirmed they never met anyone named Brittani during his two seasons with the team.In June, Rodgers again addressed the swirling speculation, defending his wife’s desire for privacy.“I’m with somebody who’s private, who doesn’t want to be in the public eye, didn’t sign up to be a celebrity, doesn’t want to be a part of it,” he explained. “If and when she wants to be out and there’s a picture, she’ll choose that.”While Brittani remains unseen, Rodgers has opened up about how she’s transformed his life. During training camp in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, he told NFL Network’s Kyle Brandt, “When you meet the right one and you're with the right one, your whole world changes in a second.”He credited her for being his “rock” and source of calm. “To have that person that unconditionally loves you behind the scenes, there's no better feeling in the world, and I got the most incredible wife,” he said. “When you have that stability and that rock behind you at the house, you feel like you can do anything.”As Rodgers continues to lead the Steelers this season, he’s made it clear that while he’s chosen the fame of the NFL once more, his private life — and his wife Brittani — will stay firmly out of the spotlight.Also Read: Who is Chase Brown’s girlfriend?

Record milestone highlights Aaron Rodgers’ enduring impact in the NFL

Career achievements from Green Bay to New York set the stage for Steelers success

New chapter in Pittsburgh demonstrates leadership and competitiveness

Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers became the fifth all-time leading passer in NFL history during Thursday night’s Week 7 road game against the Cincinnati Bengals, surpassing former Steelers star Ben Roethlisberger’s 64,088 career passing yards. At 41, Rodgers continues to impress, leading Pittsburgh with poise and precision in a thrilling contest.Rodgers opened Thursday’s game with a signature touchdown drive, capped by a 10-yard pass to Jonnu Smith, helping the Steelers take an early lead. Despite throwing two first-half interceptions, he finished the half with 118 passing yards, enough to officially surpass Roethlisberger and secure his place in NFL history. His performance underscores that even late in his career, Rodgers remains one of the league’s premier quarterbacks.The majority of Rodgers’ career passing yards came during 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers, where he backed up Brett Favre for three years before becoming the franchise quarterback for 15 campaigns. By the time he left Green Bay in 2022, he had thrown 59,055 yards, second only to Favre in team history.Rodgers then joined the New York Jets, where a torn Achilles in 2023 derailed his first season, but he returned in 2024 to throw 3,897 yards, proving his resilience and ability to perform at an elite level.This offseason, Rodgers signed a one-year contract with the Steelers, bringing his experience and leadership to a new team. Through the first five games of the season, he has already thrown for over 1,000 yards, establishing himself as a key figure in Pittsburgh’s offense. His performance demonstrates that even late in his career, Rodgers continues to lead with intelligence, determination, and precision.With this milestone, Rodgers joins Matthew Stafford as one of only two active quarterbacks in the top 10 all-time passing yards. He will turn 42 in December, yet shows no signs of slowing down, underscoring that his career is defined by endurance, adaptability, and an unrelenting competitive drive.Rodgers’ journey — from Green Bay to New York and now Pittsburgh — reinforces that greatness in the NFL is about more than talent: it is about longevity, leadership, and the ability to continue rewriting history with every game.Also read: Will Aaron Rodgers play against the Cincinnati Bengals tonight?

Early in the fourth quarter, Jared Goff’s thrilling receiving touchdown appeared to give momentum to the Detroit Lions in their matchup against the Kansas City Chiefs. However, just as the team and fans celebrated, a late flag was thrown, and the touchdown was called “Illegal motion. ” Head coach Dan Campbell demanded an explanation from referee Craig Wrolstad, who revealed the call came from the league office. Later, in a radio discussion with Jim Costa and Jon Jansen on 97.1 The Ticket, Campbell confirmed, when asked, that the call came from New York. Lions' wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown recounted on his podcast the surprise at the delayed penalty: “The craziest part is we’re all celebrating. We get to the sideline. We sit down and we’re like done. And then they like to blow the whistle…I’ve never seen a flag come out like this late.”During the radio show, Jim Costa, Jon Jansen, and Dan Campbell discussed the details of the controversial call.Jon Jansen asked Dan Campbell on the call, “Did that call come from New York about overturning the Goff touchdown? Are you guys enquiring as to why you were told that or what happened in that situation? Why they went back a minute and a half later and threw the flag?”Campbell replied, “Yeah, we asked all that.I can’t tell you any of that.”Jim Costa pressed further, “But then it was official that they told you it came from New York?”After a minute’s pause, Lions head coach replied, “Yeah.”Costa concluded, “Obviously, it’s raised a lot of questions and concerns from the fans. I know you guys probably have a lot of those too.”Back in 2013, during the Dallas Cowboys vs. Denver Broncos matchup, quarterback Peyton Manning faked a pass to running back Knowshon Moreno at the 1-yard line—and carried the ball himself up to the end zone! He had scored his first rushing touchdown in five years. It was not in the official playbook, but it’s called a bootleg touchdown. No flag was thrown then. In Jared Goff's case, the quarterback became a wide receiver after running back David Montgomery threw a pass at him—then he carried the ball, avoided tackles, and ran towards the end zone to score a touchdown. What happened then? A few moments later (even after the Lions celebrated Goff’s touchdown)—a flag was dropped! And they called it “Illegal action.”David Birkett of The Detroit Free Press reported that Goff believed he had done everything right. Officials on the field disagreed.

Cam Ward shares new Tennessee Titans interim head coach Mike McCoy’s message—“At the end of the day, we are trying to win football games”



This connection sparks supposed question: Could Mike McCoy and Cam Ward become a duo like Troy Aikman and Jimmy Johnson from the 1990s?

Also Read:

Amongst many secret messages revealed in Netflix’s sports docuseries “America’s Team: The Gambler and His Cowboys,” there was one that may stand true for Tennessee Titans rookie quarterback Cam Ward. First, the message: With legendary coach Jimmy Johnson, NFL legend Troy Aikman was unstoppable. With Barry Switzer, Aikman struggled. Now, how’s it supposedly related to the Titans—the front office of Tennessee fired Brian Callahan after failing to bring out the best in the rookie quarterback and brought in a new interim head coach, Mike McCoy. Ward’s words for McCoy: “I have developed a good relationship with coach McCoy since the pre-draft process, and I think his history with other top quarterbacks will benefit me over the rest of my rookie season.” And the rookie’s quotes on Callahan: “I feel for coach Callahan because of what he has done for me to get to this point,” and “I am going to support whatever decision we make, and the guys in the locker room are going to support it.”The coach-quarterback connection became even clearer when Cam Ward shared new Tennessee Titans interim head coach Mike McCoy’s core message: “At the end of the day, we are trying to win football games.”The rookie signal-caller spoke to reporters on Wednesday. His calm composure let out words of praise for the new interim coach, and he shared how his own goals matched with the coach’s goals: “At the end of the day, with coach or without coach, we are trying to win football games, and that is the same message coach Mike (McCoy) is preaching. We just have to live by it and stay true to it.”Despite five losses and only one win, Cam Ward remains calm and hopes for the best for his team—“My job is to play quarterback, and my job is to help lead this team to wins.” That’s what happened with the Dallas Cowboys in the 1990s. Troy Aikman believed in his team. Jimmy Johnson believed in his team. And they won two Super Bowls back-to-back!Would Mike McCoy turn out to be the legendary coach Jimmy Johnson for the Tennessee Titans? Only time will tell—for now, the faith that the quarterback has in the new interim coach (probably) looks a lot like NFL legend Troy Aikman had in Johnson.","Cam Ward shared new Tennessee Titans interim head coach Mike McCoy’s core message: “At the end of the day, we are trying to win football games” The connection sparks supposed question: Could Mike McCoy and Cam Ward become a duo like Troy Aikman and Jimmy Johnson from the 1990s?","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124610252,imgsize-42326,width-400,resizemode-4/nfl-cam-ward.jpg"

Jake Browning's Postgame Reaction After Bengals Crushed by Vikings in Week 3

Browning’s path from national records to Bengals huddle

Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Jake Browning’s rise from a California high school star to an NFL QB is one of the most jaw-dropping journeys in football. At Folsom High, he turned every Friday night into a record-breaking show. Even without playing varsity as a freshman, he walked into the spotlight and changed the state’s football story forever. Browning’s numbers are so massive, they sound almost unreal, and yet they remain etched in the national record books.Browning spent three seasons leading Folsom’s varsity squad and delivered unmatched numbers. As a sophomore, he threw for 5,248 yards and 63 touchdowns with a 64.6% completion rate. His junior season was even more ridiculous: 5,737 yards and 75 touchdowns while completing 76% of his passes. By his senior year, Browning was averaging 5.7 touchdown passes per game, piling up 5,790 yards and 91 scores.Over his high school career, he finished with 16,775 passing yards, 229 touchdowns, 1,191 completions, and a 69.7% completion percentage. Those stats were no fluke either; Folsom finished 16-0 his senior year, winning the CIF State D1 Championship.Along the way, Browning had two games with eight touchdown passes and three with seven. His arm made him a living highlight reel.MaxPreps confirms Browning’s spot at the very top of high school football history. He still holds multiple national records, including career marks and single-season feats that remain untouched. Despite his gaudy numbers, Browning’s path wasn’t smooth.He went to the University of Washington, where 2016 was his breakout season, and he finished sixth in the Heisman voting. After that, the NFL didn’t call his name on draft day, but he carved out a spot as an undrafted player. Today, Browning is no longer just a backup. With Joe Burrow sidelined, the Cincinnati Bengals have handed him the keys to the offense in 2025. For fans who remember his high school fireworks, it feels like the stage he was always meant for.Also read: James Cook: from Miami roots to Buffalo Bills star","Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Jake Browning is a former California high school star.

First Take

Shae Cornette steps in as versatile anchor for ESPN’s high-energy show

Molly Qerim's successor on First Take has been signed by ESPN. The network told Front Office Sports that Shae Cornette and Stephen A. Smith would be hosting. Cornette was selected by the network to take Qerim's place on ""First Take"" following a month-long audition process, Front Office Sports announced Thursday. On November 3, Cornette will formally take over as host of First Take. Smith is one of the network's highest-paid performers. He will therefore probably need to approve the final decision.Molly Qerim abruptly quit First Take last month, and several of her coworkers and an ESPN executive speculated that it had something to do with contract negotiations and her future at the network. However, after testing out a few presenters, the Worldwide Leader has reportedly chosen a substitute for Qerim: Shea Peppler Cornette.After presenting the morning discussion program for over ten years, Qerim left it last month. Cornette, Peter Schrager, Amina Smith, MJ Acosta, Courtney Cronin, and Joe Fortenbaugh are among the hosts that ESPN has since tried out for the position.Cornette has hosted radio and television programs, including SportsCenter, since joining ESPN in 2020. ESPN and Cornette have not yet released an official statement, though. David Roberts, the executive vice president of ESPN, told FOS:“Shae is meticulous in her preparations, connects naturally with our show’s high-profile personalities, and has a unique ability to keep lively debate engaging and on point..Her professionalism, presence and energy make her an ideal fit for First Take and a great addition to one of ESPN’s most successful franchises.”ESPN president of content Burke Magnus told media reporter Richard Deitsch last month that Qerim's departure from First Take came sooner than anticipated. In the announcement, Qerim wrote:“After much reflection, I’ve decided it’s time to close this incredible chapter and step away from.. Hosting this show has been one of the greatest honors of my career. Every morning, I had the privilege of sharing the desk with some of the most brilliant, passionate, and entertaining voices in sports — and with all of you, the best fans in the world…”She further stated:“I’m so grateful for what this journey has given me: lifelong friendships, unforgettable memories, and the chance to be part of something truly special. From the bottom of my heart, thank you for welcoming me into your homes.”Meanwhile, Shae Cornette seems perfect for the new role.Following rumors that she would be retiring at the end of the year, Qerim abruptly left the program. Smith, who earns $20 million annually, is one of the network's highest-paid performers. He is also the executive producer of the venerable ""Embrace Debate"" program.He will thus likely need to sanction the ultimate decision. Having worked for Chicago media for decades, such as ABC 7, Fox 32, and ESPN 1000, Cornette came to ESPN in 2020. She has worked as a SportsCenter anchor and studio host for both TV and radio at ESPN on a regular basis.The morning program, launched in 2003 as Cold Pizza, was reformatted in 2011 as First Take, hosted by Skip Bayless . Smith joined as a regular cast member in 2012. Qerim took over hosting First Take then. However, the new chapter for the show is about to begin as the new host prepares herself for the role.Also read: Stephen A.

Marcus Mariota gets emotional after Commanders’ win over his former team, the Raiders

Marcus Mariota’s career earnings: From Titans to Commanders

Marcus Mariota has been in the spotlight since his first NFL snap. Back in 2015, the Oregon Ducks star stunned fans with a record-setting debut, throwing four touchdowns and finishing with a perfect passer rating of 158.3. That performance made him the first player since 1933 to hit that mark in his first game. Even with all the hype, Mariota downplayed the moment, saying, “We have to find ways to get better.” Now, after more than a decade in the league, the Washington Commanders quarterback is still collecting big checks.In 2025, Marcus Mariota’s net worth stands at $75,541,683. The number reflects his steady run of NFL salaries, bonuses, and endorsements. He once ranked 83rd on Forbes’ list of highest-paid athletes, pulling in $23.9 million in 2020 alone. That season, $20.9 million came directly from NFL salary and winnings, while $3 million came through endorsement deals.Fast forward to today, Mariota is in his second season with the Washington Commanders. After working as a backup to Jayden Daniels last year, he signed a fresh one-year, $8 million contract in March 2025.The deal includes a $5.5 million signing bonus, $7.39 million guaranteed, and carries an $8.08 million cap hit. According to Spotrac, his dead cap value sits at $7.49 million. Even as a backup, Mariota’s bank account shows he remains a valuable veteran presence.Mariota’s 2025 pay package is structured in layers. His base salary is $1.89 million, with $2 million in possible incentives and another $1 million as a workout bonus. When all is added up, the Commanders are investing heavily in their QB2.Looking back, his salary journey tells the story of a long NFL grind. With the Commanders in 2024, he made $6 million plus $3 million in bonuses. A year earlier with the Eagles, he took home $5 million and $3.8 million in bonuses. His biggest checks came during his Tennessee Titans run (2015–2019), when he banked $6.05 million in salary and $15.9 million in bonuses. In total, Mariota’s career earnings now hit $83 million. That number got a huge boost in 2019 when the Titans gave him a $20 million base, which alone makes up nearly 20% of his career income.Also read: Seahawks dealing with key injuries as Saints look for edge in Week 3","In 2025, Marcus Mariota’s net worth stands at $75,541,683.

Salman Agha press conference: Lashes out at SKY, India on handshake and trophy controversy

Pakistan Cricket Board is set to replace Salman Ali Agha as T20I captain with all-rounder Shadab Khan following Pakistan 's three consecutive losses to India in the Asia Cup 2025. According to PTI, decision comes as part of a strategic reset ahead of the 2026 T20 World Cup scheduled to be held in India and Sri Lanka, with the change expected to be implemented once Shadab recovers from shoulder surgery next month.The decision was triggered by Pakistan's poor performance against India during the Asia Cup 2025, where they lost all three encounters against their arch-rivals within a span of 15 days. The defeats occurred in the Group A clash on September 14, the Super Fours on September 21, and the final on September 28.The Asia Cup final proved particularly devastating for Pakistan. Despite a strong start with 113 for one, the team suffered a dramatic collapse, losing nine wickets for just 33 runs and getting bowled out for 146. India's Kuldeep Yadav played a crucial role in the collapse, taking four wickets for 30 runs.India managed to chase down the target in a tense finish, with Tilak Varma scoring 69 runs to lead his team to victory by two wickets. The win secured India's ninth Asia Cup title. Agha Salman 's personal performance in the tournament was notably poor, scoring only 72 runs in seven matches with a strike rate of 80.90 and an average of just 12.His captaincy decisions faced criticism throughout the tournament, and the consecutive losses to India further intensified the need for change.The selection of Shadab Khan as the new captain is based on his extensive experience in international cricket. He has represented Pakistan in 112 T20Is and has previously served as vice-captain. His experience extends to leadership roles in various cricket leagues globally.Shadab Khan brings valuable skills to the captaincy role as a leg-spinning all-rounder. His ability to contribute both as a middle-over spinner and lower-order batsman provides tactical advantages for the team, which has been struggling to find the right combination.The change in leadership reflects Pakistan Cricket Board's focus on rebuilding the team's strategy and improving their performance against strong opponents.

Poll Do you think Vaibhav Sooryavanshi has the potential to be the next cricket superstar like Sachin Tendulkar? Yes, absolutely! Maybe, he needs to prove himself. No, it’s too early to say.

Former India coach Ravi Shastri has lauded young batting prodigy Vaibhav Sooryavanshi, saying the teenager reminded him of a young Sachin Tendulkar . Shastri also revealed that Matthew Hayden was left stunned in the commentary box, refusing to believe that the batter was only 14 years old.""I was amazed; I was on air in that game in Jaipur. I went on air in the 4th over, and I did two stints in a row because we were one commentator short by that time. By the 9th, 10th over, he had gotten to his 100, and he had smacked it. He was hitting Mohammed Siraj , Ishant Sharma 10 rows back over extra cover and midwicket. Haydos (Matthew Hayden) was there, and he said, 'Oh he can't be 14', and I said, 'Come on, calm down',"" Shastri said on the Willow Talk show on the LiSTNR Sport podcast.Praising the youngster’s talent, Shastri said Vaibhav’s biggest challenge starts now.""For him, the toughest time is now. Because he’s made such an impression at such a young age, much like Sachin. Now, in those next two or three years, he needs someone to guide him. You can go off the rails very quickly. You can go into your head, expectations are high, you might not be able to handle it,"" Shastri explained.""This is where someone has to go and tell him, you’re bound to fail at some stage.It’s a level, this game. So don’t be upset. It’s a part and parcel of life. You stick to what you are doing. Once you start embracing failure, start taking it in your stride, then you strike the right balance. This is an important time for him.""Shastri also advised that the young prodigy should play red-ball cricket to fine-tune his technique and temperament.""How good were a Sachin or a Kohli at that age? If this guy is that good at this age, there is no reason why he can’t be asked to play four-day games. It will do him good to ball out. It will help tighten his technique. Then he will get the balance of which bowlers to see off and which to target... targeting is not a problem — it is already there. It is about respecting the conditions,"" Shastri added.","Former India coach Ravi Shastri has lauded young batting prodigy Vaibhav Sooryavanshi, saying the teenager reminded him of a young Sachin Tendulkar.

England fast bowler Mark Wood , who was sidelined due to a knee injury since the Champions Trophy , has described his off-season as a ""frustrating summer"" as he prepares for the upcoming Ashes 2025 series against Australia. The 35-year-old pacer, who was England's leading wicket-taker in the 2021-22 Ashes and earned a Man of the Match award at Headingley in 2023, is now focusing on his recovery and return to competitive cricket.The Ashes 2025-26 series is scheduled to begin on November 21 at Perth's Optus Stadium, with the opening Test running until November 25.The second Test, which will be a day-night match, will be played at The Gabba in Brisbane from December 4 to 8.The Adelaide Oval will host the third Test from December 17 to 21, followed by the fourth Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground from December 25 to 29.The series will conclude with the fifth Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground, scheduled from January 4 to 8.Speaking about his recovery and preparations, Wood shared his experiences on the Wisden Cricket Weekly podcast: ""It was a frustrating summer. I didn't get to play any cricket and my knee, at times when you think that you're just about ready to play, it was not just quite there.I got knocked back a couple of times, but in the tent it's been going well. I've had the speed gun out and the pace is getting up there, so I'm building nicely into New Zealand first, and then the Australian leg. ""Wood expressed cautious optimism about his return to the field, stating: ""Hopefully, I'm in form, bowling well in the practice games and in the nets, and can put my hand up for that game [in Perth]. The rehab hasn't just been a straight curve. It's been a bit up and down, but I'm in a good position now where I'm hoping to kick on for that game. I never want to give an answer where I say, 'Yes, I'm pumped, I'm ready'. But I'm in a confident place at the minute and feeling a lot more positive, so I'm quietly confident. ""The fast bowler's return to fitness will be crucial for England's chances in the series, considering his previous performances against Australia, particularly his impressive showing at Headingley in 2023.Wood is currently focusing on regaining his pace during training sessions, with his immediate target being the New Zealand series before the Australian tour.","Mark Wood has described his off-season as a ""frustrating summer"" The 35-year-old was sidelined due to a knee injury since the Champions Trophy.

Australian all-rounder Cameron Green has been ruled out of the upcoming three-match ODI series against India due to a minor side soreness, with Marnus Labuschagne being called up as his replacement. The injury, diagnosed as ""low grade,"" has prompted Cricket Australia to take a precautionary approach, especially considering the upcoming Ashes series.Green experienced discomfort during training this week before the first ODI against India scheduled for Sunday. The 26-year-old is expected to return to cricket in Western Australia's next Sheffield Shield match on October 28.Cricket Australia provided an official statement on the situation: ""Green will complete a short period of rehabilitation and is tracking to return to play in round three of the Sheffield Shield to continue his preparation for the Ashes.""The timing of Green's setback raises concerns with the Ashes series opener against England approaching in five weeks. This comes as Australia already face uncertainty regarding captain Pat Cummins, who is recovering from lumbar back stress.Green had only recently returned to bowling in competitive cricket, taking 1-13 from four overs during Western Australia's Sheffield Shield match against NSW last week. This marked his first bowling spell since undergoing spinal surgery last October.The injury represents a new challenge in Green's careful return to full fitness following his back operation, where doctors fused his L4 vertebrae. The current side soreness is not related to his previous surgery.Labuschagne's inclusion comes after impressive recent performances, including four centuries in the domestic season for Queensland. His teammate Matthew Renshaw provided insight into Labuschagne's current form: ""He's just so on, peak Marnus. It's really good to see, and it's good that the work he's done in the off-season is working out for him now... he's (only) missed out once (this season).""The series against India has faced multiple changes to the Australian lineup. Josh Philippe will replace wicketkeeper Josh Inglis, who is recovering from a calf strain, while Matthew Kuhnemann will step in for Adam Zampa, who will miss the match for personal reasons.Labuschagne's recent form, including two centuries in the one-day format - 130 against Victoria and 105 against Tasmania - strengthens his case for immediate inclusion in the playing XI. His latest achievement includes scoring 159 at Adelaide Oval in the Sheffield Shield.Green's absence could create an opportunity for Matthew Renshaw to make his debut at No.4, a position where he has maintained an average of 50 with a strike rate exceeding 100 over the past four One-Day Cup seasons.The Australian team management continues to prioritise player fitness and recovery, particularly with the crucial Ashes series on the horizon. Other players currently managing injuries include Sean Abbott with a hand injury and Brendan Doggett with a hamstring issue.Jhye Richardson, recovering from shoulder surgery, showed positive signs by bowling a lengthy spell during the ODI squad's first training session in Perth on Thursday.Green had previously skipped the T20 tour of New Zealand to focus on Sheffield Shield cricket as part of his Ashes preparation.Mitchell Marsh (c), Xavier Bartlett, Cooper Connolly, Ben Dwarshuis, Nathan Ellis, Josh Hazlewood, Travis Head, Matthew Kuhnemann, Marnus Labuschagne, Mitchell Owen, Josh Philippe, Matthew Renshaw, Matthew Short, Mitchell Starc.Adam Zampa, Alex Carey, Josh InglisShubman Gill (c), Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, Axar Patel, KL Rahul, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav, Harshit Rana, Mohammed Siraj, Arshdeep Singh, Prasidh Krishna, Dhruv Jurel, Yashasvi Jaiswal",Cameron Green ruled out of three-match ODI series against India.

Max Scherzer refuses to leave the mound and asserts his competitive fire in the fifth inning of a critical ALCS clash

Overcoming a difficult season to deliver his best performance when it mattered most in the playoffs

Turning back the clock with his longest postseason outing since 2021 and leaving in line for a crucial victory

In a defining moment of Toronto’s postseason run, Max Scherzer refused to be pulled from the mound and delivered a vintage dominant outing that reminded everyone why he is one of baseball’s fiercest competitors. The 41-year-old ace, returning from injury and a challenging season, showed grit, fire, and mastery in his American League Championship Series debut.As manager John Schneider approached the mound in the fifth inning, Scherzer’s defiance was clear. After a brief conversation, Schneider stepped back, allowing Scherzer to continue pitching. It was a moment fans had joked about when Toronto signed him—the challenge of taking a fiery veteran off the mound mid-inning—but in the postseason, there was no joking. Scherzer’s intensity energized his team and set the tone for the night.This season had been a rollercoaster for Scherzer. Injuries and a late-season slump had kept him off Toronto’s Division Series roster and limited his appearances. Yet in Game 4 of the ALCS, he erased all doubts. By the fifth inning, he had already completed two trips through the lineup, allowing just one run on a Josh Naylor solo homer while the Jays led 5-1.Not satisfied with that, he battled for every pitch, delivering three more outs and finishing the fifth inning with a strikeout of Julio Rodriguez.Scherzer ultimately left the game with two outs in the sixth inning, finishing with 5 2/3 innings pitched and two earned runs. It was his best start since late August and his longest playoff outing since 2021. Beyond the numbers, his performance symbolized resilience, leadership, and the kind of veteran presence that can swing momentum in Toronto’s favor. The Blue Jays now carry forward a renewed confidence, powered by the fiery display of their ace.With this performance, Scherzer not only reminded fans of his Hall of Fame-caliber talent but also gave Toronto a crucial boost in morale as the ALCS continues. His determination and dominance may well define the series moving forward.Also read: Inside George Kirby’s 2025 season: Career earnings, salary details and recent MLB highlights","The 41-year-old ace showed grit, fire, and mastery in his American League Championship Series debut.

Carter Hart drops a bold message to Mitch Marner and his new Golden Knights teammates upon his long-awaited return,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/carter-hart-drops-a-bold-message-to-mitch-marner-and-his-new-golden-knights-teammates-upon-his-long-awaited-return/articleshow/124619497.cms,"Carter Hart opens up on Golden Knights move (AP Photos)

Carter Hart’s next chapter with the Golden Knights



Golden Knights stand by their decision



Carter Hart is officially back in the NHL , and the Vegas Golden Knights have secured a goalie who once held the spotlight in Philadelphia. The 27-year-old goaltender has signed a professional tryout contract (PTO) with the team, setting the stage for a mid-season return. After months away from the league, Hart is ready to prove himself once again, telling the Las Vegas Review–Journal, “I’ve learned a lot. I’ve grown a lot. I’m ready to move on. I’m excited to get out in the community and show my true character.”Though Hart’s comeback has drawn mixed reactions from fans, his talent is undeniable. Vegas expects him to strengthen an already formidable goaltending room alongside Mitch Marner. While Hart won’t be eligible to play until December 1, the team has ample time to get him back into top form. The Golden Knights could debut him against the Chicago Blackhawks on December 3, or perhaps schedule a dramatic return in Philadelphia on December 11. Either way, expectations are high for a goalie eager to leave past struggles behind.Hart’s career with the Flyers saw highs and lows. Drafted 48th overall in 2016, he amassed a 96-93-29 record with a 2.94 goals-against average and a .906 save percentage, including six shutouts.Yet his last NHL outing in January 2024, where he allowed five goals against the Colorado Avalanche, left fans questioning his consistency. Now reinstated by the NHL and signed for a PTO with Vegas, Hart has a chance to redefine his legacy.Vegas faced criticism for bringing Hart aboard, but the organization emphasized their commitment to core values. A team statement highlighted alignment with the NHL and NHLPA’s process, noting, “We remain committed to the core values that have defined our organization from its inception and expect that our players will continue to meet these standards moving forward.” With a fresh start and clear support, Hart’s journey with the Golden Knights promises to be both closely watched and deeply compelling.Hart’s story is one of resilience, growth, and the pursuit of redemption. As the calendar flips to December, all eyes will be on him to see if he can recapture the form that once made him a rising star in the NHL.Also Read: Connor McDavid leads the way as Oilers rookie Matt Savoie reveals candid thoughts on playing with NHL legends","Carter Hart has signed a professional tryout contract with the Vegas Golden Knights.
