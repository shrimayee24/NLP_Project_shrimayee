Cowboys put Micah Parsons’ back injury holdout to test

Will Micah Parsons eventually get a new deal from Dallas Cowboys? | Pro Football Talk | NFL on NBC

Micah Parsons' holdout could make him top NFL trade asset

Dallas Cowboys EDGE Micah Parsons continues to make headlines by sitting out games while citing back tightness, delaying his new contract negotiations. Owner Jerry Jones and the front office appear unfazed, allowing Parsons to use the injury as the reason for his absence while maintaining control of the situation. Experts are keeping a close eye on whether Parsons will be ready for Week 1, given his importance to Dallas’ defense.Pro Football Talk’s Mike Florio suggests the Cowboys may be daring Parsons to continue using back tightness to avoid playing. “He’s not sitting out as a business decision. He’s citing back tightness. If he’s willing to continue to ride that wave, he’ll be able to not play until he gets his new contract,” Florio explained.Dallas seems to be testing whether Parsons will miss Week 1 or return sooner, keeping fans and media speculation alive. While the holdout continues, Parsons must prepare for the season if he hopes to take the field. Any delay could impact both his performance and the team’s defensive effectiveness. The Cowboys are carefully balancing player relations with organizational leverage in this high-stakes negotiation.If the standoff between Micah Parsons and the Dallas Cowboys escalates beyond resolution, the star EDGE linebacker could become one of the NFL’s most valuable trade assets. Former NFL GM Mike Tannenbaum has highlighted potential blockbuster trades involving the Buffalo Bills, Detroit Lions, and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, underlining Parsons’ elite talent and market value.While no trade is expected immediately, Parsons’ contract holdout underscores the high stakes of managing top-tier NFL talent, contract negotiations, and team strategy. His absence has already raised questions about Week 1 readiness, defensive impact, and how the Cowboys plan to navigate the season without their defensive centerpiece.Also Read: Bengals rookie Shemar Stewart explains low hit on Joe Burrow and what really happened The ongoing saga highlights the delicate balance between player power and team control, with Micah Parsons at the center of a standoff that could shape the Cowboys’ season and significantly influence the NFL’s trade landscape.","Dallas Cowboys EDGE Micah Parsons continues to make headlines by sitting out games while citing back tightness.

Kelsey Plum admits her joke on Caitlin Clark didn’t land



A brief context behind the Kelsey Plum’s controversy



Los Angeles Sparks guard Kelsey Plum has broken her silence on the controversy surrounding her postgame remark about Caitlin Clark’s team at the WNBA All-Star Game. Plum claims that it was meant as a joke quickly turned into a flashpoint. Her comments quickly sparked criticism across social media and national coverage. Now, in a sit-down with Sue Bird on the “Bird’s Eye View” podcast, Plum admitted the timing of her words was off and that the moment was taken out of context.After the All-Star Game in Indianapolis, Kelsey Plum told reporters that “zero members of Team Clark” had attended the players’ morning meeting, where the decision to wear black “Pay Us What You Owe Us” shirts was made. At the time, she laughed alongside Sabrina Ionescu, trying to inject humor into a press conference heavy with collective bargaining questions.On Bird’s podcast, Plum admitted her intent never matched how the comments were received. “The questions came in, and it was like, ‘CBA, this, this, this.’ It was like, ‘Hey, Team Clark, they didn’t make it to the meeting.’ I was making a joke that they were hungover, even though our team nickname was ‘hungover.’So it was like, ‘At least we made it (to the meeting).’”Plum has long been known for throwing in lighthearted remarks, but this one hit differently. Fans interpreted her words as a slight against Clark, especially since Clark, though sidelined, was photographed wearing the protest shirt on the court. In retrospect, Plum acknowledged she failed to read the seriousness of the moment.“I made a bad joke. I made a really bad joke, tough one,” she admitted. “I should have—like, hindsight’s 20/20—because of the shirts, because of the fans… I should have known it was a way more serious moment than a typical All-Star Game. Because I went into that press conference very, like, happy-go-lucky we won, you know?”The WNBA’s labor climate explains why Plum’s comment became a hot topic of discussion beyond the locker-room. Players are in the middle of collective bargaining with the league, with the current CBA set to expire in October. The protest shirts worn at All-Star Weekend were designed to highlight pay equity concerns following the WNBA’s $2.2 billion television rights deal.Clark joined her peers in wearing the shirts, despite being sidelined from her play. Plum emphasized that her words should not be taken as questioning Clark’s commitment. “Obviously, we’re all on the same page. We all wore the shirts. Like, we’re all unified. I think, if anything, I was more discouraged because I felt like the comments took away from the moment of what we were trying to do.”Also Read: Magic Johnson’s wife Cookie Johnson celebrates the Los Angeles Lakers legend’s 66th birthday at world famous chef’s restaurant As the league and union move toward tense negotiations, even offhand remarks are under a microscope.

Cam Jordan calls on Bengals to pay Trey Hendrickson



Why Trey Hendrickson deserves Bengals extension



Cincinnati cannot risk losing Trey Hendrickson in AFC title chase

The Cincinnati Bengals face a crucial decision regarding star pass rusher Trey Hendrickson, who remains in a contract standoff with the team. While Hendrickson continues his hold-in, one former teammate is publicly urging the Bengals to lock him down with a well-deserved extension. For Cincinnati, the situation could prove pivotal to both their short- and long-term success.During an appearance on Up & Adams, veteran defensive end Cam Jordan made his stance clear: the Bengals cannot afford to mishandle Hendrickson’s situation. Jordan, who played four seasons with Hendrickson in New Orleans, emphasized that Cincinnati should pay him what he’s worth before it’s too late.“He needs to be paid,” Jordan told Kay Adams. “Don’t let a guy like Trey Hendrickson walk. They’ve never had a pass rusher like Trey Hendrickson over Cincinnati.”Jordan referenced the lucrative contracts of elite defenders such as T.J. Watt and Myles Garrett, noting that Hendrickson’s production places him in the same category. Despite those comparisons, Hendrickson remains without the extension he is seeking.The numbers speak for themselves. Hendrickson has delivered back-to-back 17.5-sack seasons, totaling 35 sacks over the past two years.That level of production has placed him among the league’s most dominant pass rushers. For a Bengals defense striving to keep pace with AFC heavyweights like the Kansas City Chiefs and Baltimore Ravens, Hendrickson’s presence is critical.Cincinnati may have invested a first-round pick in defensive end Shemar Stewart, but as Jordan pointed out, proven production carries more weight than potential. “I get it, you picked up a first-rounder, but you have something proven. When you have something proven, you add to that,” Jordan said.The Bengals have made significant investments in their offensive core around Joe Burrow and Ja’Marr Chase, but maintaining balance requires equal commitment on defense. Hendrickson’s consistency as a pass rusher is rare, and his ability to disrupt opposing quarterbacks makes him indispensable.Also Read: Dillon Gabriel shows promise in Cleveland Browns' preseason debut despite costly mistakes If Cincinnati hopes to remain a legitimate contender in the AFC, extending Trey Hendrickson must be a top priority. As Cam Jordan emphasized, players of Hendrickson’s caliber do not come around often, and losing him would create a void the Bengals may not be able to replace quickly.","Cincinnati Bengals defensive end Trey Hendrickson is in a contract standoff with the team.

As mentioned, Jake was the one who shared clips and photos from the ceremony on social media, giving fans a glimpse into the big day.The couple’s 10-month-old daughter, Esmé Agdal Paul, also played a special role in the celebration.Logan and Nina welcomed Esmé in September 2024, with Logan announcing the happy news by posting photos of the family cuddled together in a hospital bed, along with a close-up of their newborn.Jake didn’t come alone as he was joined by his fiancée, Dutch speed skating star Jutta Leerdam.

Shannon Sharpe’s accuser, 20 year old former OnlyFans model, might have hinted at what really went down between the two



Shannon Sharpe has also been accused of assaulting the young woman a number of times



Shannon Sharpe and his legal scandal with the 20 year old former OnlyFans model might have come to an end after the NFL legend paid $23 million to settle the lawsuit but the controversy is far from over. The legal mess cost Shannon Sharpe his job at ESPN and his reputation has taken a huge hit. The former OnlyFans model had also accused Shannon Sharpe of threatening to harm her and now, she might just be dropping hints of what really happened.A few days ago, the 20 year old OnlyFans model shared a verse from Bible on her Instagram story that has shocked fans.The verse reads as, “You have freed me from the feuds among my people; you have preserved me as the head of nations.""It continued, ""God — he grants me vengeance and casts down people under me. He frees me from my enemies. You exalt me above my adversaries; you rescue me from violent men.""In the lawsuit filed by the 20 year old former OnlyFans model, in the court documents accessed by NBC Sports, she had accused Shannon Sharpe of threatening to “harm” her.As per the lawsuit, Shannon Sharpe once was furious at the 20 year old for trying to share her location with her friends when she was with him.The NFL legend had lost his cool and reportedly told her, “I will f***ing kill you.”Apart from this, the 20 year old has also accused Shannon Sharpe of trying to “violently” sexually assault her multiple times.Amid all the mess, Shannon Sharpe has mostly remained silent after he constantly tried to prove his innocence when the lawsuit was initially filed in May.Shannon Sharpe’s silence about the settlement of the lawsuit and his accuser sharing Bible verses related to the legal mess has raised many eyebrows.However, the NFL legend continued to maintain distance from the scandal and has not spoken about any of it.Shannon Sharpe’s exit from ESPN’s First Take has shocked fans as many felt he would be back for the upcoming season after he stepped down from the role in April.Also Read: Shannon Sharpe allegedly filmed s*x acts with 20-year-old OnlyFans model and shared them without consent","Shannon Sharpe’s accuser, 20 year old former OnlyFans model, might have hinted at what really went down between the two.

Will Aaron Rodgers play in the Steelers’ second preseason game against the Buccaneers?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/will-aaron-rodgers-play-in-the-steelers-second-preseason-game-against-the-buccaneers/articleshow/123314307.cms,"Will Aaron Rodgers make his preseason debut versus the Buccaneers? (Getty Images)

Steelers sideline Aaron Rodgers again for preseason clash with Buccaneers, raising fresh questions on readiness



Steelers banking on practice chemistry over preseason reps



Pittsburgh’s preseason strategy is set in stone for Week 2, and it looks familiar. Head coach Mike Tomlin has confirmed that most of his high-profile starters will once again remain on the sidelines, prioritizing controlled practice reps over game action. Saturday’s matchup against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers will offer little in the way of star power, but plenty of opportunity for depth players to make their case.The list of absentees is star-studded: Aaron Rodgers, DK Metcalf, Jalen Ramsey, T.J. Watt, Alex Highsmith, Cam Heyward, Jaylen Warren, and several others will skip Pittsburgh’s second preseason game. Mason Rudolph will start at quarterback, while Rodgers continues to work through joint practice sessions rather than live game snaps.Tomlin explained, ""I'm going to play this preseason game very much like we did the first one, in terms of participation. The same collection of guys that were held out the last time will comprise the guys that are held out this time.""While fans may be disappointed at not seeing Rodgers in Steelers colors yet, the 41-year-old quarterback is hardly in uncharted territory. His preseason absences are nothing new, and Tomlin appears confident that his preparation habits need no on-field exhibition warm-up.For Rodgers, the real work is happening behind closed doors at training camp and joint practices—like this week’s matchups with the Bucs, where Ramsey has been squaring off against Mike Evans in spirited one-on-one battles.Pittsburgh’s approach this summer is less about proving veterans’ readiness and more about protecting their health while evaluating younger talent. Tomlin noted that decisions will be made weekly, taking into account “development and performance” rather than sticking to a rigid formula.Some, however, remain curious about how Rodgers’ connection with his new targets—Metcalf, Robert Woods, and Calvin Austin III—will evolve without live preseason action. A defensive coach speaking to The Athletic remarked, ""Aaron has had good route runners around him when he was at his best… Metcalf is like a bully, jump-ball, kill-you-in-the-red-zone guy. Truthfully, I have no idea how that works there.""The Steelers completely retooled their passing attack this offseason, and while the vision is clear, the execution will take shape in real time once the regular season begins. For now, Tomlin is betting on practice intensity, competitive matchups, and veteran experience to be enough—leaving the real fireworks for when the games start counting.Also Read: Mike Vrabel plays peacemaker after Patriots and Vikings erupt in intense training camp fight","Aaron Rodgers, DK Metcalf, Jalen Ramsey, T.J.

Mike Vrabel jumps into the fray during joint practice



Toughness defines Mike Vrabel’s coaching style



The competitive fire in New England Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel was on full display during Thursday’s joint practice with the Minnesota Vikings. What began as an ordinary preseason workout quickly escalated into a heated on-field confrontation — and Vrabel, never one to watch from the sidelines, threw himself right into the chaos. The 50-year-old coach ended up at the bottom of the pile but emerged unscathed, reinforcing his reputation as a fearless leader.The incident unfolded during the second practice session between the Patriots and Vikings ahead of their preseason clash at Gillette Stadium. While it’s still unclear what initially sparked tensions, video from VikingzFanPage captured Vrabel charging into the scrum, determined to separate his players from their opponents.It wasn’t his first time playing peacemaker under fire. Just last week, during a joint practice with the Washington Commanders, Vrabel walked away with a gash on his right cheek after breaking up another fight. Despite the risks, players have taken notice of his willingness to stand with them. Wide receiver DeMario Douglas praised the gesture, saying it shows “a lot about our coach” and that “He’ll do anything for us.That’s love.” Quarterback Drake Maye even joked the injury looked like “the Trump gunshot wound.”Mike Vrabel’s readiness to step into the middle of conflict reflects the same grit he displayed during his eight-year playing career with the Patriots, where he won three Super Bowls. After a successful run as Tennessee Titans head coach from 2018 to 2023 — marked by four winning seasons and multiple playoff appearances — Vrabel returned to Foxborough in January with the mission to restore a struggling franchise.Known as a quintessential “football guy,” Vrabel has long built a culture where players feel protected and motivated. That presence was evident again on Thursday — not just in his words, but in his actions. If New England ever needed him to suit up again, it seems the former linebacker might still have a few snaps left in him.Also Read: NFL’s 2025 shake-up: 12 teams add male cheerleaders, sparking fierce debate over tradition and inclusivity",New England Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel jumped into a scuffle during Thursday's joint practice with the Minnesota Vikings.

From clueless to committed: how Taylor Swift’s football glow-up resonated on New Heights

Why FOX eyeing Taylor Swift could be a strategic ratings move beyond a celebrity cameo

Taylor Swift on Reclaiming Her Masters, Wrapping The Eras Tour, and The Life of a Showgirl | NHTV

What this could mean for how we watch football next season

Taylor Swift’s unannounced drop-in on the New Heights podcast with Travis and Jason Kelce did more than stir headlines — it reopened a conversation about the blending of pop culture and live sports. Swift’s playful reflection on her early football misunderstandings and her cheeky timeline for career expansion have set social feeds alight, and FOX’s push to land fresh, crossover personalities means the idea of her in a broadcast booth no longer feels purely fanciful.On the episode, Swift admitted a charming origin story of confusion, “I used to think both offenses were on the field at the same time. Like Jared Goff is here, and Josh Allen is here… and then they both blow a whistle and then they go at each other.”That frankness underscored a genuine learning arc: from bafflement to obsession. Her curiosity, combined with visible enthusiasm for tactical details like special teams and draft decisions, reframes her as a conduit between longtime fans and newcomers who want the game explained without condescension.NFL on Fox’s official account posted an Instagram video demanding, “We need to get @taylorswift in the NFL on FOX booth.”Networks increasingly chase attention economies where appointment viewing depends on cultural relevance as much as analysis. FOX already stacked its lead booth with Tom Brady and seasoned on-air talent, but adding a figure like Swift could expand casual viewership and deepen engagement among younger, pop-oriented audiences.Swift’s comment, “I’m not ready to be an analyst right now, but give me 16 months”, feels less like refusal and more like a promise of potential. If networks want to grow the pie, having a high-profile celebrity who’s also committed to learning the game could be a smart long-term play.Inviting Swift would be about more than novelty. It signals a shift toward broadcasts that treat narrative, personality and expert analysis as complementary. Whether she ever lands in a booth, her New Heights visit highlighted a broader truth: modern sports audiences value authenticity and accessibility.Also Read: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s New Heights appearance fuels marriage rumors with secretive backdrop clue For FOX, that’s the attractive part — a chance to marry gridiron expertise with mainstream cultural momentum and make each weekend feel like a shared event across fandoms.","NFL on Fox’s official account posted an Instagram video demanding, “We need to get @taylorswift in the NFL on FOX booth” FOX already stacked its lead booth with Tom Brady and seasoned on-air talent.

Why It Makes Sense for Los Angeles

Key benefits for the Lakers:

A hypothetical trade scenario has surfaced that would send LeBron James and his son Bronny James from the Los Angeles Lakers to the Golden State Warriors, with Jimmy Butler and a 2028 first-round pick going the other way. This proposal could reshape the NBA landscape, pairing LeBron with Stephen Curry in what could be one last run at a championship.As Dan Angell of Sports Illustrated wrote, “Even at 40 years old, there’s only one LeBron.”The challenge in moving LeBron James is not just his full no-trade clause but also his desire to play alongside Bronny. That means any acquiring team would need to take on $54.5 million in combined salary.The Los Angeles Lakers, operating over the first apron, must receive similar salary back under NBA cap rules. Many teams, like the Cleveland Cavaliers, are unable to make such a deal due to second-apron restrictions, but the Warriors can. Golden State ’s front office must remain cautious with the salary cap to avoid losing their mid-level exception and other flexibility. Swapping Jimmy Butler for the James duo works financially when Bronny’s minimum deal is factored in.• LeBron finally teams up with Stephen Curry, fulfilling a long-standing wish.• Bronny joins the roster, keeping LeBron content and motivated.• The team remains competitive at Butler’s former position while aiming for another championship before Curry’s window closes.While the Los Angeles Lakers are not eager to take on Butler’s contract, they cannot offload LeBron before the 2026 offseason without taking back equal salary. The inclusion of a 2028 first-round pick makes the deal more appealing.• Gain a valuable future draft asset to support their plan to build around Luka Doncic.• Butler, though 36, remains an elite defender and capable scorer.• Potential to trade Butler later for pieces that align with a long-term title push in 2027 and beyond.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors Eyeing $28 Million Portland Trail Blazers Star; Potential Stephen Curry Reunion Amid Jonathan Kuminga Uncertainty?

Why Payton Still Fits the Golden State Warriors’ Direction

Why Gary Payton II Fits Perfectly

Theare reportedly moving toward a reunion with defensive specialistin the upcoming free agency, according to Eric Pincus of Bleacher Report. While the team’s offseason has been relatively quiet with no blockbuster additions, the front office is carefully navigating roster construction and salary cap logistics. Jonathan Kuminga’s restricted free agency is also playing a central role in how soon Payton’s deal can get done.Gary Payton II’s reputation as one of the league’s premier defenders makes him a natural fit for the Golden State Warriors’ system. His ability to lock down opposing guards and wings complements the Warriors’ long-standing strategy of pairing Stephen Curry ’s offensive brilliance with a strong defensive backbone.Payton’s impact goes beyond numbers—his defensive communication, hustle, and on-court chemistry have made him a fan favorite. Last season, he appeared in 62 games, providing consistency and energy off the bench. Jonathan Kuminga ’s status remains the key domino in Golden State’s offseason. As a restricted free agent, his future - whether through re-signing, a sign-and-trade, or another move - will determine the team’s financial and roster flexibility.Pincus notes that Payton’s potential return is “waiting on the Warriors to either sign or move on from Jonathan Kuminga,” a situation similar to past cases where other signings were delayed pending bigger roster decisions.The Golden State Warriors are operating just below the luxury tax apron, making every contract decision significant. Even with potential re-signings like De’Anthony Melton and Al Horford, the team could keep space for Payton while adding other depth pieces.The mention of Simmons by Pincus adds intrigue - he could bring a Draymond Green-like blend of defense and playmaking if healthy.Golden State is entering a transition period post–“Splash Brothers” era, but the team’s DNA still values defense, ball movement, and chemistry. Payton’s familiarity with Steve Kerr’s schemes and his ability to elevate lineup performance make him a low-risk, high-reward signing.Personally, I feel that Gary fits in the Warriors for the following factors:• Elite perimeter defense against top guards/wings• High lineup net ratings when on the floor• Efficient scorer with strong cutting and finishing ability• Durable and adaptable to multiple lineup configurations• Enhances team chemistry and allows stars like Curry to focus on offenseAlso read: Why the Golden State Warriors are Interested in $60 Million Boston Celtics Big Man to Bolster Stephen Curry and Jonathan Kuminga’s Supporting Cast The Golden State Warriors’ measured offseason is less about chasing headlines and more about securing the right pieces.

Michael Porter Jr. addressed a topic that isn't included in a box score on his Curious Mike show. During the YouTube podcast, he said:“Everybody has different vices. Everybody has different things that they struggle with. … You know, for example, my brother struggled with gambling. My vice has always come in the form of women.”He continued:“There was one girl I really liked… She used to talk to a dude in the league and I was like I just can’t do it, because if I’m cooking him and he’s allowed to say thats why I hit your girl.”He had previously talked candidly about his romantic life. On One Night with Steiny, the 27-year-old discussed his romantic pursuits and said:""My only thing with a girl, you gotta bring something to the table. I don’t mind providing for you, I don’t mind doing that… You can stay at the crib, you can do your thing. You gotta bring something to the table. … Positivity, you gotta help me mentally, you gotta be able to cook or something. You gotta bring something to the table … look, what value are you bringing to my life? That’s the way I look at it now…”He continued:""In a wifey, I don’t mind if she’s a stay-at-home mom. My mom was a stay-at-home mom but she raised all eight of us kids, she homeschooled us, she cooked for us when my dad was out working, she raised us. You gotta be able to do something.

Milan Lucic’s wife Brittany hints at his NHL return

How the legal and team context still shapes any potential return

What to watch next and why fans should pay attention



Brittany Lucic used an Instagram Q&A to offer a rare, personal update about her husband Milan Lucic’s recovery and the possibility of him returning to the NHL — a brief but loaded exchange that rewrites the public narrative around a case that drew intense media scrutiny. Her comments didn’t settle questions about a comeback, but they did spotlight accountability, rehabilitation and how families navigate high-profile incidents behind closed doors.When a follower asked if Milan planned to return to pro hockey, Brittany posted a swim-trunk photo and wrote: “I’m not sure but he looks great!” That clipped answer didn’t confirm a roster plan — but it did suggest Lucic is physically well and perhaps rebuilding his life away from the headlines. For teams, agents and fans tracking roster depth, ambiguous updates like this are often the first public signals of someone moving through recovery toward potential availability.Across the Q&A, Brittany framed their progress as deliberately staged: “Separate! And then together! It’s a powerful journey I will share more about my views/path eventually! 🤍” She also reflected on self-accountability: “Isn’t it so easy to blame others, have no accountability, identify the role you played in your life, or even have to self reflect … spooky stuff going to those places.”These words matter because they shift the frame from legal outcomes to personal growth — a narrative teams and leagues increasingly weigh when considering an athlete’s return to play.Lucic was arrested in November 2023 after an alleged domestic incident; prosecutors later dropped charges when Brittany invoked marital privilege, and Lucic entered the NHL/NHLPA Player Assistance Program and took an indefinite leave. Those facts remain central to how franchises, sponsors and the public will evaluate any comeback path — medical clearance and PR rehabilitation alone rarely settle the broader reputational calculus.This Instagram exchange isn’t a roster update so much as a status report on a family working through trauma under public view. If Lucic aims to play again, expect a slow, documented return: formal medical updates, team statements, and possibly conditions tied to assistance-program milestones.Brittany’s candor, and her “I’m not sure but he looks great!”, keeps the conversation alive, but the final call will hinge on health, league protocols and how stakeholders assess accountability and readiness.Also Read: Johnny Gaudreau’s 32nd birthday unites fans, teams, and rivals across the NHL, turning loss into a call for change","Brittany Lucic offered a rare, personal update about her husband Milan Lucic’s recovery.

NHL trade rumors heat up as Carey Price’s contract linked to potential Chicago Blackhawks deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-rumors-heat-up-as-carey-prices-contract-linked-to-potential-chicago-blackhawks-deal/articleshow/123313471.cms,"The Montreal Canadiens could finally be on the verge of moving Carey Price’s massive contract (Getty Images)

Why the Blackhawks make sense as a landing spot for Carey Price's contract

What Montreal gains — and the steep price they’d pay



The Montreal Canadiens could finally be on the verge of moving Carey Price’s massive contract — and the Chicago Blackhawks might be the team to make it happen. With Price’s deal entering its final year and carrying a $10.5 million cap hit, a proposed trade scenario has emerged that could benefit both sides while reshaping their near-term plans.The Chicago Blackhawks currently sit just over $6 million above the salary cap floor and are expected to move several veterans by the trade deadline. Taking on Carey Price’s contract would give them a financial cushion and strategic flexibility. Analyst Tab Bamford suggests a swap in which Chicago would receive Price’s contract, along with Montreal’s 2026 and 2027 first-round picks, in exchange for goaltender Laurent Brossoit, forward Lukas Reichel, and three second-round picks spread across 2026 and 2027.For Chicago, the move would create a stockpile of draft capital — including three first-rounders in 2026 — giving them “enough ammo to do something significant” in the future. And if the Hawks decide to make a big splash in free agency, Price’s and Shea Weber’s contracts could be placed on LTIR, unlocking more than $18 million in extra cap space.From Montreal’s perspective, adding Brossoit would address a current depth issue behind starter Samuel Montembeault.As Bamford bluntly put it, “Right now, their backup is Kaapo Kahkonen — who is not good.” Brossoit’s career .911 save percentage (.927 last season with Winnipeg) and Stanley Cup-winning experience with Vegas in 2023 make him an immediate upgrade.Reichel, meanwhile, is a 23-year-old former first-round pick who hasn’t found his stride in Chicago. A fresh start in Montreal could unlock his potential, especially in a system eager to develop young forwards.The challenge for the Canadiens would be the heavy draft pick sacrifice — having already moved both 2025 first-rounders in the Noah Dobson trade, losing their ’26 and ’27 selections would test their long-term asset management.Also Read: NHL Trade Rumors: Connor McDavid linked to Maple Leafs and $3.5B Rangers if Oilers extension talks stall Still, if Montreal believes Brossoit and Reichel can contribute immediately, and if shedding Carey Price’s cap hit accelerates their rebuild, this could be the kind of high-risk, high-reward move that changes their trajectory.",The Montreal Canadiens could finally be on the verge of moving Carey Price’s massive contract.

“very amicable.”

Montreal Canadiens and defenseman Lane Hutson making progress in NHL contract extension talks

How Lane Hutson’s potential Montreal Canadiens contract compares to other top young NHL defensemen

The Montreal Canadiens and 21-year-old defenseman Lane Hutson have begun preliminary talks on a new contract, with sources describing discussions asHutson, a pending 10.2(c) restricted free agent, is coming off a standout rookie season and is eligible to sign an extension as of July 1. While talks are still early, both sides appear confident a deal will eventually be reached.According to RG’s Marco D’Amico, the Canadiens and Hutson’s camp are in a good place as negotiations move forward. Hutson’s 10.2(c) status, meaning no arbitration rights or offer sheet eligibility, gives Montreal a stronger negotiating position. This lack of external leverage for the player allows the team to explore cap-friendly options without the immediate pressure of a bidding war.Hutson’s debut season was nothing short of impressive. The reigning Calder Trophy winner posted 60 assists and 66 points in 82 games, cementing his status as one of the NHL’s brightest young blue-liners. Given his performance, the Canadiens are aiming to secure his prime years while balancing the long-term salary cap outlook. Early projections suggest an annual average value (AAV) in the $8.8 million to $9.5 million range, depending on term length.While some have drawn comparisons between Hutson’s upcoming deal and Noah Dobson’s eight-year, $9.5 million AAV contract, industry insiders point out key differences. Dobson’s right-shot profile, top-pair minutes, and proximity to unrestricted free agency gave him far greater bargaining power than Hutson currently holds.Instead, Hutson’s situation aligns more closely with recent long-term deals for fellow 10.2(c) defensemen like Quinn Hughes, Jake Sanderson, and Brock Faber. These players secured contracts worth roughly 9–9.5% of the salary cap. With the NHL cap projected to reach $104 million, Hutson’s extension will likely follow a similar formula. Both sides may also be waiting to see what New Jersey’s Luke Hughes signs for, giving Hutson’s camp another relevant comparable.The Canadiens appear set on keeping Lane Hutson as a central piece of their defensive core for years to come. While the exact term and cap hit are still being negotiated, the tone of discussions suggests a mutually beneficial deal is on the horizon. Montreal’s focus now is locking in their promising young defenseman at the right price before the market shifts further.Also Read: Utah Mammoth prospect Caleb Desnoyers likely to have debut pushed back to November due to injury","Montreal Canadiens and defenseman Lane Hutson making progress in NHL contract extension talks.

The Falcons shocked many analysts by drafting him in the first round despite signing veteran QB Kirk Cousins just weeks earlier.Known for his cannon arm and calm demeanor, Penix took over starting duties late in the 2024 season and has been touted as one of the most promising young quarterbacks in the league.

Lerone Murphy: The Rise of 'The Miracle' from the Streets of Manchester to UFC Stardom,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mma/news/lerone-murphy-the-rise-of-the-miracle-from-the-streets-of-manchester-to-ufc-stardom/articleshow/123312213.cms,"Image credit: Instragram

Growing up in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester, Lerone Murphy’s childhood was a whirlwind of football, friends, and the occasional mischief. Living near Manchester United’s iconic stadium meant the game was never far away. “My childhood was crazy,” Murphy recalls. “I used to love playing football, going out with friends. Sometimes we got into trouble, but it was fun. Football was a big part of my life.”But life in a deprived, rough area shaped him in ways beyond sport. “It made me mentally resilient,” he says. “I got into a lot of fights when I was younger, and that toughened me up.”For years, football seemed like his future—until a devastating knee injury at 16 changed everything. Playing in a cup final, Murphy suffered a serious blow. “I blew my knee up, and that set me back,” he remembers. “It took me away from sport altogether. Without that, I went down the wrong path.”Combat sports weren’t initially on his radar, even though his uncle, Oliver Harrison, was a respected boxing trainer who worked with big names like Amir Khan. “It was inspiring, seeing what he was doing,” Murphy says, “but I never thought I’d be a fighter.I just wanted to be a footballer.”That changed when a gym opened in Manchester. Training with his cousin, Murphy discovered mixed martial arts—and instantly connected with it. “It was love at first sight,” he admits. “I’d always been into combat through things like anime and Street Fighter, but I’d never tried it. Once I did, I was hooked.”Murphy turned professional in 2016, and within three years, he was making his UFC debut—a rapid rise built on relentless dedication. “I train every day. I don’t do anything else but train or think about fighting,” he says. “That’s why I’ve grown so quickly.”But perhaps the most pivotal moment of his life came in 2013, when he was 21. Leaving a barbershop, Murphy was shot—a brush with death that would alter his path forever. “It was a dark time,” he admits. “But it was also the moment that changed me. If that didn’t happen, who knows what I’d be doing now. As strange as it sounds, I’m happy it happened because it put me on the path to MMA.”That life-altering event earned him the nickname “The Miracle,” a badge of resilience he carries into every fight. “It reminds me I can get through anything,” he says. “Even if things don’t go your way, it doesn’t mean it’s the end. You can turn things around if you stay resilient.”Training at Manchester Top Team has been key to his continued growth. Surrounded by high-level fighters chasing the same dreams, Murphy has refined his skills while staying loyal to the team that shaped him. “It’s good to have that environment,” he says. “It keeps you sharp.”For young people facing tough times, Murphy’s message is simple but heartfelt: “There’s always light at the end of the tunnel. It’s never over until it’s over. If you’re still here, you can change your situation. Keep good people around you, lean on them, and cut out the bad influences. That’s the main thing.”Looking ahead, Murphy’s ambitions are crystal clear. “My goal is to be UFC champion—and defend it in Manchester. That’s my dream.”Watch Lerone Murphy in UFC 319 on 17th August from 7:30 AM IST live on Sony Sports Ten 1 SD & HD, Sony Sports Ten 3 Hindi SD & HD , Sony Sports Ten 4 Tamil & Sony Sports Ten 4 Telugu.","Lerone Murphy is a welterweight fighting for the UFC.

Poll What do you think has the biggest impact on an athlete's success? Support from family Personal determination Access to training facilities Societal acceptance

Indian wushu athlete Namrata Batra exemplifies the story of a small town girl with aspirations who fights adversities to achieve success on the international stage.Born in Indore in a conservative family, Namrata wanted to pursue martial arts but was opposed by her grandparents. They were concerned about perceptions related to the attire — wearing sleeveless vests and matching shorts — during training and competitions.However, her businessman father Sanjay Batra provided unwavering support, ensuring that societal pressure did not impede her ambitions to represent the country and win medals. On Tuesday earlier this week, the 24year-old became the first Indian ever to win a World Games medal in wushu, finishing runner-up in the women’s sanda 52kg event in Chengdu, China.India have won a total of seven medals in different editions of the World Games – one gold, two silver and four bronze – but Namrata’s wushu medal was a first in the quadrennial multisport event’s 44-year-long history.Today, Namrata’s grandparents feel immensely proud as they see her medal winning photos in the country’s newspapers and websites.“I come from a big joint family. My grandparents earlier didn’t like theh fact that I had to wear shorts and t-shirts to pursue myu dreams.They initially put a lot of restrictions and didn’t even allow me to venture out alone for training and competition purposes. They were like what would the society say. For them, it was all about studying, getting good grades and looking for a settled job. But my father was always supportive of my career choices. He stood by me like a rock and backed my decision to become a martial arts player.Today, my grandparents and the same set of people who discouraged me, feel proud about my achievements. They fully support my journey,” Namrata told TOI after returning from Chengdu.Namrata boasts of an impressive CV. She is one of the country’s leading female wushu (sanda) athletes with several domestic and international medals to her name. Wushu, a Chinese martial art, is categorised into two disciplines: Taolu (forms) and Sanda (sparring). Taolu involves choreographed routines with empty hands or weapons, while Sanda is a full-contact combat sport.Apart from the historic silver at the World Games, she finished second at the Asian championships last year, won bronze at the Asia Cup earlier this year, a gold medal at the Moscow Wushu Star championships and had podium finishes at the Uttarakhand and Gujarat editions of the National Games. She was the junior national champion from 2015 to 2018 and continued her success as a senior, winning gold medals from 2018 to 2021 in the 48kg division before moving to the 52kg category in 2022.","Namrata Batra became the first Indian ever to win a World Games medal in wushu.

From social-media hype and rising stardom to a humbling fall that stunned Giants fans

The viral clip that spread everywhere and turned a rookie’s growing pains into a national talking point

Inside the Giants’ locker room, teammates and coaches rally behind Carter with faith in his future

Even on a night when Carter struggled, the Giants’ preseason victory showed promise across the roster

Every NFL great has endured early bruises, and Carter’s viral moment could become the spark of his rise

New York Giants rookie Abdul Carter, drafted third overall in 2025 and tipped as one of the most exciting defensive talents in years, had his dream start collide with a dose of reality in Week 2 of the preseason. After hyping fans with a Star Wars-themed post and shining in his debut against Buffalo, Carter was floored in unforgettable fashion against the Jets — first chipped to the ground by tight end Stone Smartt, then flattened by right tackle Jay Tufele. The play instantly went viral, reminding everyone that even top prospects must endure humbling first lessons.Carter arrived at MetLife with the buzz of a blockbuster. At 6-foot-3 and 250 pounds, the linebacker looked built for dominance, and his debut a week earlier had fueled optimism. His playful social-media stunt — casting himself as a Star Wars hero — added to the growing legend. But the Jets delivered a moment that stripped the gloss. Within seconds, Carter was on the turf twice, reduced to a meme as much as a menace. It was a jolt, but also the type of moment every rookie eventually encounters.The collision was replayed across timelines within minutes. On X, fans mixed amusement with sympathy: some laughed at the giant falling, while others urged patience, pointing out how every NFL newcomer has to take their lumps.What made it sting more was the contrast: Carter, the face of New York’s defensive future, upended by journeymen blockers. He ended the night with just one tackle, his stat line far quieter than the storm online.Inside the Giants’ locker room, there’s no panic—just belief. Offensive lineman Jermaine Eluemunor put it plainly, “I know that kid’s going to be great. I tell him every day, tell him when I see him I think he’s going to be great… There’s hard work, there’s talent, but there’s something that’s just God-given like his twitch and his shiftiness.” Coaches echoed that view, stressing that Carter’s ability to learn from mistakes is part of what made him a top-three pick. The setback, they suggested, could become fuel rather than a flaw.Beyond Carter’s stumble, New York had little to complain about. The Giants rolled to a 31–12 win over the Jets, with their quarterback trio of Jaxson Dart, Russell Wilson, and Jameis Winston orchestrating steady drives. Defensively, the team showed depth across the line, with Kayvon Thibodeaux and Dexter Lawrence anchoring the front.

Poll Do you believe Gautam Gambhir's strategies will lead India to success in T20 cricket? Yes, absolutely No, I have doubts Maybe, it depends on execution I need more time to decide

Moments after India pulled off a miraculous draw in the fourth Test in Manchester last month, head coach Gautam Gambhir turned up at the press conference in his usual feisty avatar. It was the only Test during the two-month long tour in which India had been trailing England for almost four days. Gambhir wasn’t merely there to express his glee or relief. He was there to reiterate that those who doubted his strategies weren’t clued in. The coach feeds off the challenges thrown at him. In coming back from England with a 2-2 scoreline, he has been vindicated for some of the tough calls he took.The next six months, starting with the Asia Cup in UAE next month, will be the first time Gambhir will truly get to work on the T20I team for a period of time. Yet, the current T20I side is more his baby. His stint as India’s head coach started with Suryakumar Yadav being propelled to T20I captaincy ahead of Hardik Pandya . With Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli already retired from the format at the start of his stint, he could seamlessly drive home his philosophy in the dressing room. It didn’t matter if India were the new T20I world champions.“T20 World Cup, T20 side for India should be selected from IPL,” Gambhir said on former India off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin ’s YouTube channel just before assuming the role with the Indian team. Gambhir isn’t looking to rock the boat.But by now, it has been well established that he doesn’t mind dragging established names out of their comfort zones. He is rarely inhibited while giving more responsibility to unheralded cricketers — be it Suryakumar Yadav and Manish Pandey at KKR in 2014 or backing Ayush Badoni at Lucknow Super Giants.Much of Washington Sundar’s evolution as a Test allrounder is down to Gambhir’s unwavering backing. Gambhir swears by continuity. Despite all the talk of flexibility, he seeks stability at the top. The chatter in Indian cricket is that he would prefer an all format captain soon to build a common culture. Gambhir has been very clear with his vision. He walked in with an idea to rebrand the T20 team. India have often been accused of not being able to move with the times in the shortest format. Gambhir has decided to address it with players who can be branded as T20 specialists. He doesn’t mind if the pool swelled. That’s why Ramandeep Singh and Mayank Yadav were given their opportunities last year. India’s attacking brand of T20 cricket over the last 12 months is proof enough of how the Delhi man wants to go about his job.This is the format that brought him recognition as a tactician. He won two IPL titles with KKR as a captain more than a decade ago before returning as a mentor in 2024 and delivering their third. He also stands out, being quite bullish about ‘results’ rather than process. Those who share the dressing room with Gambhir say that the coach loves breaking the game up into 120 balls rather than looking at it as a 20-over entity. ‘Every ball has to have an impact’ is his go-to phrase.There’s no room for getting comfortable. Roles are assigned as per skills, not batting numbers. He is comfortable with this facet of a modern-day T20 cricketer. Shivam Dube, for one, will always get preference since he can go up the order and blast the bowling if the openers get off to great starts. There are no designated finishers.Gambhir’s inclination towards having allrounders stems from the need to have more options. The Asia Cup may give us a glimpse of how he wants to go about his business in the next few months, but nothing is cast in stone yet. With the success in Champions Trophy and England, things have started to fall in place for Gambhir. Till the transition button is pressed in ODIs, it won’t be surprising to see a few unexpected moves in T20 cricket.",Gautam Gambhir has been vindicated for some of the tough calls he took.

R Ashwin has issued a clarification after his comments on Chennai Super Kings’ (CSK) acquisition of South Africa's Dewald Brevis sparked a huge controversy on social media.CSK had to put out a statement after Ashwin claimed that the franchise paid an “extra"" amount to Dewald Brevis, who had a base price of Rs 75 lakh in the mega auction and went unsold. The South African was later roped in by CSK as an injury replacement for Gurjapneet Singh.“I just want to say this.

In today's world, news can be made based on one statement or headline.""The way Brevis is batting, CSK has struck gold. The decision to bring him on board is very good.""The franchise has struck gold during the purple patch of Dewald Brevis. He has been batting really well; he hits big sixes.

The previous record was held by JP Duminy, who scored a 31-ball fifty in Melbourne in 2009.The 22-year-old also broke the record for the quickest fifty against Australia on their home soil, beating Ravi Bopara's 23-ball effort in Hobart in 2014.Prior to this match, Brevis had demonstrated his batting prowess in the second T20I with an unbeaten 125 off 56 balls. This innings included the second-fastest century for South Africa in T20Is, achieved in 41 balls, second only to David Miller's 35-ball century against Bangladesh in 2017.","R Ashwin's comments on Chennai Super Kings' acquisition of Dewald Brevis sparked a huge controversy on social media.

Themay be heading toward a roster shake-up before the 2025-26 NBA season concludes, with reports suggesting power forwardcould be on the trade block. While the Lakers have publicly expressed satisfaction with their current lineup, ongoing trade rumors hint that the front office is still searching for the right mix of talent to maximize Luka Doncic’s championship window.According to RB Hayek of ClutchPoints, Vanderbilt’s combination of strong perimeter defense but limited offensive production might not fit the direction head coach JJ Redick wants to take the team. Hayek wrote: “Jarred Vanderbilt may be out of time in LA. Sadly, the Lakers forward is just not cutting it. He averaged 4.1 points and 5.1 rebounds per game during the 2024-25 season while shooting 48.8 percent from the hardwood. However, Vanderbilt only averaged 1.4 points per game during the playoffs and shot 33.3 percent over five games.”While his defense remains a strength, Vanderbilt’s inability to consistently contribute on the offensive end could make him expendable, especially if the Lakers want a more balanced two-way player in their rotation. Jarred Vanderbilt is under contract for $10.7 million through next season, giving the Lakers some flexibility if they decide to move him. His deal could be used in a trade package to bring in players who offer more scoring punch and have a stronger track record of staying healthy.While the Los Angeles Lakers may not fetch a significant return for Vanderbilt, moving him could open up a valuable roster spot for a player with more offensive upside. Given the competitive Western Conference, every roster decision could play a crucial role in positioning the team for a deep playoff run.Possible motivations for a trade:• Acquire a more versatile forward who can contribute offensively and defensively• Improve injury reliability in the frontcourt rotation• Create cap flexibility for midseason movesAlso read: NBA Mock Trade: Los Angeles Lakers Land $121 Million Golden State Warriors Big Man in Blockbuster Swap for LeBron James Vanderbilt’s journey in Los Angeles started with promise, but his offensive limitations and recent playoff struggles have raised questions about his long-term fit.

Cookie Johnson had been an immense support to Magic Johnson throughout his HIV diagnosis

Magic Johnson revealed the agony of sharing a life-changing illness with his wife

NBA veteran Magic Johnson is suffering from an incurable disease, i.e., Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). He retired from the NBA back in 1991 after announcing that he was HIV-positive. His wife, Cookie Johnson, had been an immense support throughout his diagnosis. However, she was pregnant when she heard the news about her husband. Magic Johnson’s biggest fear was whether his child would develop the same condition, along with his wife. Thankfully, that wasn't the case. He said that he hated telling his wife about the news of his illness. It was hard, harder than having to bear the pressure of winning NBA titles. He loves his wife, and so does Cookie Johnson.Magic Johnson’s wife, Cookie Johnson, was scared in the beginning, but she had to be strong for her husband, her family. “It scared me to death when he told me that,” she recalled. “I just fell on my knees and started crying.” This was because, back then, HIV was regarded as a death sentence, and having to see her husband suffering from the same killed her from within. Even after having the option of leaving, she chose not to and decided to stay by his side, “I got mad, I was like, ‘Are you kidding? I love you.I’m not gonna let you die’”, she said.According to Cookie Johnson’s interview with “Variety”, she was asked why she chose to stand by her partner and what led her to make that decision. “I wasn’t going to just walk away. I loved him, number one. And because I loved him, I felt like, the first thing that was facing me was life or death. All the other stuff went out the window”, she said during that interview. “To me, it was choose to stay with him to help him live, or leave him and watch him die. I loved him enough that I chose to stay and help him live and we figured it out together. Whatever we had to face, we were going to face it together. That was never an option to leave.”Magic Johnson’s illness had a life-changing impact on the couple. However, his wife, Cookie Johnson was determined on her decision to stay by her husband till death parts them. He said that he hated sharing the news with his wife in the first place because he loves her a lot. “It was hard because I loved her so much and I hated to hurt her”, the NBA veteran said. “I've played against some of the best basketball players in the world, right? I've been in championships. I've been in nine [NBA] Finals, so I know pressure. But there was no greater pressure than driving home to tell her.”The NBA star was worried about the disease being transmitted to his child since Cookie Johnson was pregnant at that time. But that wasn’t the case. “The key moment was when Cookie took the test and the results came back that her and the baby was fine”, said Magic Johnson. The couple was “scared to death” before the reports tested negative.Also read: Magic Johnson’s wife Cookie Johnson celebrates the Los Angeles Lakers legend’s 66th birthday at world famous chef’s restaurant","NBA veteran Magic Johnson is suffering from an incurable disease, i.e., Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) He retired from the NBA back in 1991 after announcing that he was HIV-positive.

“Trans people still have rights but not a right to play sports against the opposite sex… you can be trans all day long but you can’t be a boy and play girl sports.”

Parents, district officials, and AB Hernandez’s mother react to forfeit

AB Hernandez, a transgender athlete from Jurupa Valley High School, is in the spotlight again. On Friday night, August 15, 2025, Riverside Poly High School in Riverside County, California, said its girls’ volleyball team would not play the scheduled match against Jurupa Valley. The school called it a forfeit in non-league standings, saying they wanted to keep a safe, positive place for all athletes. They gave no official reason, but many believe the decision was tied to Hernandez being on Jurupa Valley’s team. A father of a Riverside Poly player said, “trans people have no right to play sports against the opposite sex.”AB Hernandez is well-known in the area. Last spring, she won state titles in the girls’ high jump and triple jump at the California Interscholastic Federation championships. Her wins came amid protests and a policy change creating shared medals for runners-up so that biological girls weren’t pushed down the rankings.On the volleyball front, Riverside Poly didn’t give a reason for backing out, but Amanda Vickers, a member of the Riverside Unified School District board, said parents and students had concerns.

Taylor Swift & Travis Kelce on ‘New Heights': Super SWIFTIE Decodes Major REVELATIONS

Taylor Swift’s appearances at Kansas City Chiefs games to cheer on boyfriend Travis Kelce have been a cultural phenomenon since 2023. While many fans see it as a fun crossover between pop culture and sports, critics claim it distracts from the actual football action. On his FS1 show The Herd, sports commentator Colin Cowherd had little patience for the backlash. He called out what he saw as a double standard, pointing out that celebrity-athlete relationships are hardly new.Colin Cowherd pushed back at critics of Taylor Swift cheering Travis Kelce, invoking David Beckham parallels as Swifties dissected the couple’s affectionate New Heights appearance and the NFL’s culture-versus-sport debate.“I will say I’ve been a little shocked at how myopic and rigid sports fans have been with this. David Beckham married a Spice Girl (Victoria Beckham). Derek Jeter had celebrity girlfriends. Russell Wilson’s married to a singer (Ciara)... Let’s be serious here. Celebrities get celebrities. Justin Verlander, didn’t he marry Kate Upton, the supermodel?” Cowherd said.The conversation comes after Kelce and Swift appeared together on his New Heights podcast with brother Jason Kelce, giving fans a rare glimpse into their relationship.The episode quickly racked up over 13 million views on YouTube.Social media influencer Olivia Levin, who manages the swiftiesforeternity Instagram account, shared her take after going to great lengths to listen live. Stranded in Philadelphia after a flight change, she ended up renting a car with two fellow Swifties just to catch the episode.According to Levin, the chemistry between the couple was undeniable. “They were touching the whole time, the hands intertwined, arms intertwined. When she was having an emotional moment talking about getting her masters back, he kissed her on the forehead. They seemed so supportive of one another,” she said.Also Read: FOX NFL invites Taylor Swift to Tom Brady-led booth as Travis Kelce's beau impresses everyone with her football knowledge Whether you see it as a PR boost for the NFL or a genuine love story, the Kelce–Swift pairing has brought new audiences to football while dominating headlines.

A behind the scenes look at New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady

Nearly a decade later, the headlines feel like a time capsule: the NFL consumed by “Deflategate,” Tom Brady’s reputation under a microscope, and whispers that the strain had followed him home. In this throwback, we revisit how a football controversy turned into a relationship stress test for Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen and the line the couple reportedly drew to steady the ship.The 2014 AFC Championship fallout wasn’t just about PSI charts and legal briefs; it was about fatigue, scrutiny, and isolation. As one source put it, “Things got so bad after Deflategate that they could barely speak to each other.” The quote captured a grim, mundane reality: two megastars reduced to quiet dinners and clipped exchanges, while an investigation stretched on and a four-game suspension loomed.The pressure cooker intensified familiar friction. Another insider described the tipping point: “Tom got irritable under the stress, and she started blaming him for all their unhappiness, much of which was there before the scandal.
