'I dedicate my Padma Shri to the rich heritage of Indian classical music': Pt Tejendra Narayan Majumdar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/i-dedicate-my-padma-shri-to-the-rich-heritage-of-indian-classical-music-pt-tejendra-narayan-majumdar/articleshow/117558563.cms,"Pt Tejendra Narayan Majumdar

KOLKATA: It was amongst the most momentous concerts in Pt Tejendra Narayan Majumdar 's illustrious career when he received the official announcement of being a Padma Shri recipient. The 63-year-old sarod virtuoso , who was performing in concert with Pt Bickram Ghosh at the IIT Kharagpur’s Spring Fest on Saturday, dedicated it to the rich heritage of Indian classical music .The Sangeet Natak award winner, who initiated his musical tutelage with mandolin under his grandfather Bibhuti Ranjan Majumdar, was a disciple of Ustad Bahadur Khan before he received talim from Ustad Ali Akbar Khan. Talking about his unpretentious middle-class household and how it necessitated an extraordinary leap of faith to pursue this vocation, Majumdar said, ""My mother served as a schoolteacher whilst my father played the sitar for light music productions. Baba had other responsibilities and could not fulfil his personal aspiration of being a classical musician. But he yearned for me to fulfil his dream.”According to him, the Padma awards are an aspiration for individuals across the globe. “I do not hail from a lineage of practising classical musicians. Since childhood, I felt a divine connection with music and practised hard. With no godfather in the realm of Indian classical music, it was an extraordinary gamble for me to pursue this vocation. My gurus’ ‘talim’ and parents’ blessings and sacrifice have enabled me to achieve this milestone,” he said.This accolade, he said, not merely recognises his proficiency but the endeavours of everyone who believed in his music. “It bestows upon me a greater responsibility to propagate Indian classical music and empowers me to dispel the myth that the young generation is disinterested in pursuing this art form. I dedicate the award to our rich heritage,” he said.Many of his contemporaries and juniors in Indian classical music have previously been honoured with the Padma award. Has the accolade arrived rather belatedly? “It is easy to proclaim that one doesn’t anticipate any honours. However, the reality is that the only recourse is to persevere diligently and trust that everything has its destined moment,” he said.The sarod player wishes that his father, Ranjan Majumdar, was alive to witness this day. “I also miss Ustad Zakir Hussain, Ustad Rashid Khan and Pt Subhankar Banerjee. They would have been overjoyed with this news. I am fortunate to have those like Bickram by my side now. He gave me the warmest embrace after receiving the news,” he said.",The 63-year-old sarod virtuoso was performing in concert with Pt Bickram Ghosh at the IIT Kharagpur’s Spring Fest on Saturday.

THE COSTLY DROP

ENGLAND 'SPUN OUT' AGAIN

Tilak Varma produced an exceptional innings in a tough situation while wickets kept falling around him and managed to hold his nerve in India's famous two-wicket win against England in the second T20I at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai on Saturday.The last-over win gave India a 2-0 lead in the five-match series.Varma's (72 not out of 55 balls) skilfully exploited the pace battery of English bowlers and steered India to their target, with the home side concluding at 166 for 8 in 19.2 overs.The innings was particularly remarkable as the left-handed batter had minimal support from his partners, while the England bowlers maintained their momentum after securing breakthroughs at regular intervals.Jofra Archer proved particularly costly, with Varma targeting him specifically, striking four sixes against the Sussex bowler, the fourth bringing up his fifty, as Archer conceded 60 runs in four overs besides claiming Sanju Samson's (5) wicket.The southpaw's remarkable shot, sending the ball over deep fine leg for six against Brydon Carse (3 for 29), demonstrated his exceptional batting skills.India faced tense moments at the start of their run-chase before Varma's steadfast batting guided them to victory.Opener Abhishek Sharma (12) began India's innings brilliantly, striking three boundaries against Archer in the opening over. However, Mark Wood's pace caught him on the back foot and the review of the LBW decision by the batter stayed in favour of Wood.The situation shortly deteriorated to 19 for 2 with Samson's departure.A swift 39-run partnership between captain Suryakumar Yadav and Varma alleviated some pressure, taking the score to 58, but Carse dismissed Suryakumar (12), who played onto his stumps.The English pace attack capitalised on the opportunity, as India lost Dhruv Jurel (4) and Hardik Pandya's (7) wickets and were left struggling at 78 for 5.Washington Sundar capitalised on his early fortune when Adil Rashid dropped him at mid-on off Wood's bowling. He went on to strike Wood for a six and two fours in quick succession, helping in bringing the required run-rate in manageable space.However, Sundar's innings (26 off 19) came to an end when he attempted to guide Carse towards third-man, only to have his stumps disturbed.At that stage, India were struggling at 116 for 6, but found resilience through Varma.After India won the toss and opted to bowl, England captain Jos Buttler showed resistance, but his fellow English batters faltered against the Indian spinners.Buttler (45 off 30 balls) displayed his class with some brilliant shots, including a sequence of 4, 6, 4 against Arshdeep Singh, who had already dismissed Phil Salt in his opening over.Salt's attempt to pull the left-arm pacer fell short as Sundar, who came in for the injured Nitish Reddy, took the catch near the square leg boundary.Sundar found success when Ben Duckett's reverse sweep was caught by Jurel, who replaced the injured Rinku Singh.The pull shot proved to be problematic for England batters throughout the evening, with both Buttler and Liam Livingstone falling while attempting it.India's vice-captain Axar Patel (2 for 32) capitalised on England batters' aggressive approach.The left-arm spinner's strategy of bowling into the pitch, combined with the surface grip, made it difficult for batters to control their shots.Buttler, whose aggressive batting had helped England reach 58 for 2 in the Powerplay overs, was caught by Varma, while Livingstone was dismissed when he was caught by substitute fielder Harshit Rana.Carse, who replaced Atkinson in the line-up, displayed aggression with a quickfire 31 from 17 deliveries, including three sixes. However, his promising innings ended in a run-out after a mix-up with Archer.Another notable moment of England's batting show came in the form of Brook's dismissal. Despite starting well with a six against Varun Chakravarthy (2 for 38), Brook's innings was cut short.Chakravarthy's clever variation with a back-of-the-hand delivery proved too good for Brook, who failed to read the ball as it crashed into his off-stump.",Varma's (72 not out of 55 balls) skilfully exploited the pace battery of English bowlers and steered India to their target. The home side concluded at 166 for 8 in 19.2 overs. The last-over win gave India a 2-0 lead in the five-match series.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117560558,imgsize-47654,width-400,resizemode-4/117560558.jpg"

Travis Kelce always wanted to be like Josh Allen

The Kansas City Chiefs and the Buffalo Bills will add another chapter to their rivalry on Sunday in the AFC Championship game at Arrowhead Stadium. Still going in for the fourth straight game against the Buffalo Bills before facing them, Travis Kelce called Josh Allen maybe the finest quarterback he has ever been ready to play against. He complimented Allen further and really expressed his dream of being the type of player he wished when growing up.Travis Kelce, now dating the world's biggest pop star, has appeared in TV shows and commercials, looks back on his childhood dreams of being like Josh Allen, the former Super Bowl champion. Kelce initially saw himself as a center in the NFL , making big plays with his arm and legs. But he did not possess Allen's arm talent, so a perceptive coach shifted him to tight end, and he has since become one of the best players in the position.""Josh is who I used to dream of being like in the NFL,"" Kelce said of Allen. ""Big athletic quarterback, big arm, being able to be a dual-threat guy. ... His ability to do everything. You can tell he's took the bull by the horns and really been their leader up front and channeled that. Guys come in and out of the building and he's the main piece in there making that thing go. I have so much respect for that guy.”As Kelce shared his praise for Allen he also joked, ""I never had the arm talent that Josh has so they kicked me over to tight end.” Kelce, though not having Allen's strong arm, proved to be quite versatile, tying for 1,523 yards passing with 15 touchdowns and 1,016 running yards as a senior at Cleveland Heights High.Kelce has even had a few chances in games of the NFL. Against the Raiders in a match-up in the 2020 season, he completed a 4-yard pass that gave him a first down. The very next week against Tampa Bay, Kelce was given another chance but came up short when the pass was incomplete.Travis Kelce has made numerous impressive plays, including catching the ball, lateralizing to another player, and watching them take off for more yards, which are close-up moments for Chiefs coach Andy Reid and Kelce's friend Patrick Mahomes.“He does that in practice,” Mahomes said with a smile, “and it started off as kind of a joke, and now it’s kind of become a thing. As long as he completes it, Coach is going to keep letting him do it. But he knows the consequences if he doesn’t.”Also Read: ""I laugh at it”: Travis Kelce says he is not bothered by haters who claim he is too old to play professional football The Chiefs are back in the AFC championship game for the seventh straight season, while the Bills are back for the second time in five seasons and looking to avenge a 2021 loss that set them up for a Super Bowl win.","Travis Kelce says he always wanted to be like Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen.

Dominik Mysterio Reveals Locker Room Buzz Surrounding Netflix Collaboration

WWE's move to Netflix has sent shockwaves through the wrestling world, and it seems the impact is being felt backstage too. At least, that's according to Judgment Day's own Dom Mysterio. Speaking on the podcast, the ""Dirty Dom"" revealed that the Netflix deal has injected a fresh wave of energy into the WWE locker room. ""Morale is definitely high,"" Dom declared. Of course, Dom's own Judgment Day faction has been facing some turbulence lately. And let's not forget his awkward encounter with Liv Morgan after Rhea Ripley dethroned her as Women's World Champion on that historic Netflix debut.In addition to bringing Raw, the weekly shows, and the PLEs to Netflix, the rumored $5 billion deal also introduced a number of other content-rich shows for the audience. Dominik Mysterio, a member of Judgment Day, recently discussed how the collaboration has impacted backstage morale after three Monday-night episodes into the agreement. The former NXT North American Champion discussed the morale of the Raw roster after the Netflix move on the Babyfaces Podcast He said, “Morale is high. We’re all super excited to to be able to just be on Netflix, because a lot of a lot of us have families. I have family in Mexico. Judgment Day has family in Ireland and stuff because of Finn and JD. So, our families struggled to to be able to see us because if they don’t have USA, they have to watch it on for us, it’s, like, Fox Sports or for that I don’t know what they have to watch it on in Ireland but it’s always different channels here and there. So the fact that you can just tune in whether it’s 8 PM or 5 PM West coast, East coast time, as long as you figure it out overseas and you have Netflix, you can watch it. So the fact that you can watch it all around the world at any point in time, even if you missed an episode last week, you can just go on there and click it and they have it all there. So that’s huge for us, we’re in over a hundred something million homes, right? So that’s insane. That’s a whole different viewership for us. We’re used to just people tuning in on USA and seeing Monday Night Raw. But now it’s like whoever clicks on Netflix, you’re going to see, whether it’s Cody Rhodes or Bianca or Roman, Liv, myself, like you’re going to see wrestling on there. It’s really cool to see because it’s going to catch your attention and people are going to click on to see Monday Night Raw.”ALSO READ: Matthew McConaughey Becomes Part of WWE Legacy Thanks to The Undertaker But amidst the drama, Dom couldn't resist taking a subtle jab at WWE legends.

Broadcast: CBS



Streaming: Paramount+, NFL+



Arrowhead Stadium sets the stage once again. The Buffalo Bills face the Kansas City Chiefs in another critical playoff clash. Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen lead two of the AFC's best teams into what feels like a defining moment. For Allen, the stakes are immense—a chance to rewrite the narrative around his career. For Mahomes, it's an opportunity to cement his place as one of the game's all-time greats.This game isn’t just about the teams; it’s about the quarterbacks who’ve defined this rivalry. Allen, often criticized for not winning ""the big one,"" faces a legacy-defining challenge. Mahomes, a three-time Super Bowl champion, remains unbeaten against Allen in playoff matchups. Can the Buffalo star finally step out of Mahomes' shadow, or will history repeat itself?Yes, Josh Allen will suit up against the Chiefs. Buffalo's star quarterback has no reported injuries leading into this game. Allen’s availability is crucial for the Bills, who rely heavily on his ability to control the game and make plays under pressure.Allen enters the game in top form, completing 72% of his passes during these playoffs. Over the course of the season, his numbers have been historic—posting the lowest percentage of plays resulting in a sack, fumble, or interception (4.2%) since the AFL-NFL merger. If Allen can replicate his efficiency, Buffalo has a shot at knocking off Kansas City.Josh Allen remains one of the most scrutinized quarterbacks in the NFL. Critics often point to his inability to win defining games as a stain on his resume. While he’s led the Bills to success, including five straight AFC East titles, a playoff victory over Mahomes has eluded him.This season, however, Allen has operated within the most efficient offensive system of his career. He’s thrown for 3,731 yards, 28 touchdowns, and only six interceptions, with a passer rating of 101.4. Additionally, his dual-threat capabilities remain unmatched, with 531 rushing yards and 12 touchdowns on the ground.If Allen can lead the Bills past Mahomes, he won’t just secure a trip to the Super Bowl—he’ll finally silence the doubters questioning his ability to deliver in high-pressure moments.Here’s how you can catch the action live:This game will define the narrative around Josh Allen’s career. A win puts him on the map as one of the league’s elite quarterbacks, finally breaking through the Mahomes-dominated AFC. A loss, however, could solidify the perception of Allen as a talented quarterback who falls short when it matters most.

Patrick Mahomes remains on the Kansas City Chiefs' injury report due to a lingering ankle issue that has raised concerns among fans ahead of their crucial matchup. As the Chiefs prepare to host the Buffalo Bills in the AFC Championship game, the star quarterback’s availability is critical. Mahomes has shown resilience before, but will his ankle hold up under the pressure of a high-stakes game?Yes, Patrick Mahomes is expected to play. Despite concerns about his ankle injury, Mahomes has been a full participant in practice throughout the week. His performance in Kansas City's decisive win over the Houston Texans in the Divisional Round showed that he can handle the pressure, even while managing the injury. The reigning Super Bowl MVP has not missed any game time and is prepared to lead the Chiefs in their seventh consecutive AFC Championship game.Backup quarterback Carson Wentz remains an option for Kansas City if needed, though his limited game time this season suggests the Chiefs are fully confident in Mahomes’ ability to deliver under pressure.The stakes couldn’t be higher for the AFC Championship game at Arrowhead Stadium. A win for Kansas City would take Mahomes to his fourth Super Bowl appearance and put him on a path to cementing his dynasty. For Mahomes, this is more than just another game. A victory would make him the first quarterback in NFL history to achieve four consecutive playoff wins over a counterpart—Josh Allen in this case.Arrowhead Stadium remains a fortress for the Chiefs. They haven't lost at home since Christmas 2023, a streak that adds to their psychological advantage. On the other hand, the Bills are no strangers to taking down Kansas City, having defeated them earlier this season.Josh Allen, a standout MVP candidate this year, brings his best form to Arrowhead.

Is Travis Kelce Preparing to Call Time on His Legendary NFL Career?



Travis Kelce’s Future: Retirement or Continued Dominance?



Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce has long been an icon in the NFL, known for his unmatched athleticism and game-changing performances. However, recent comments by his brother, Jason Kelce , have sparked speculation about whether Travis might soon hang up his cleats. Jason, a former Philadelphia Eagles standout, recently hinted at the possibility of Travis retiring during an appearance on ESPN's late-night coverage.This weekend, all eyes will be on the AFC Championship game between the Kansas City Chiefs and Buffalo Bills, a matchup poised to make history. The Chiefs are chasing their third consecutive Super Bowl appearance, while the Bills aim to secure their first-ever title. The rivalry is intense, with the Bills having won their last four regular-season meetings against the Chiefs, but the Chiefs hold a perfect 3-0 playoff record against Buffalo.While Travis Kelce focuses on this monumental game, Jason Kelce faces a personal dilemma. Speaking on his talk show, They Call It Late Night, Jason shared his excitement about covering the Eagles' NFC Championship game against the Commanders as an ESPN reporter. However, he expressed being torn between supporting the Eagles and being there for his brother. “I don’t know how many more he has,” Jason admitted, hinting at the potential conclusion of Travis’ storied NFL career.“I’m working with ESPN, and I’ll be at the tailgate for the Birds game, which I’m excited about. Initially, they were going to make me go up to Bristol, but then they said, ‘Hey, do you want to just stay down there and be a reporter on the scene?’ So I’m really fired up to be there for that.” But the dilemma occurred, “I don’t know, I’m kind of torn. I want to be there for the Eagles, but I also want to be there for my brother. I don’t know how many more he has.”Travis Kelce has shown no signs of slowing down on the field, delivering jaw-dropping performances, including a spectacular touchdown against the Texans that will be remembered as one of the NFL’s greatest moments. Yet, Jason’s comments have ignited speculation about Travis’ future in the league. Addressing retirement rumors, Travis candidly stated, “It changes every single day,” highlighting his focus on helping the Chiefs make history with a three-peat Super Bowl victory.Patrick Mahomes, Kelce's quarterback and close friend, also addressed the possibility of Travis’ retirement during an interview on The Drive with Carrington Harrison. “If it’s his last game, let’s go out there and get him a win,” Mahomes said, underscoring the camaraderie and respect within the Chiefs' locker room.Also Read: Commanders' Dan Quinn reacts in six words to Raiders hiring Pete Carroll as mentor Whether or not Travis Kelce decides to retire after this season, his legacy as one of the NFL’s all-time great tight ends is secure.

While the possibility of his retirement looms, one thing remains certain: Travis Kelce has already cemented his place in NFL history, leaving an indelible mark on the sport.","Travis Kelce has long been an icon in the NFL, known for his unmatched athleticism and game-changing performances.

Champions Trophy Squad: Chief selector Ajit Agarkar and skipper Rohit Sharma PC

NEW DELHI: India batter Shubman Gill reflected on his recent struggles in red-ball cricket following his composed second-innings century for Punjab against Karnataka in the Ranji Trophy . While his 102-run effort showcased his undeniable talent, it came in a heavy defeat as Karnataka triumphed by an innings and 207 runs.""Red-ball batting is a concern,"" Gill conceded candidly. ""Sometimes, I think with the red ball, in the matches that I play, I get very good 25-30 runs. I think in those moments, I put too much pressure on myself to score big runs. That’s not the way I have grown up playing my game.""The elegant right-hander admitted that overthinking has often disrupted his rhythm. ""There is a certain zone that I am in, certain intent that I am in, and sometimes I lose that because I put too much pressure on myself that I have to get a big run now that I am set,"" he explained.Gill’s century, which included measured resilience early on and aggression later, was satisfying, especially after his dismissal off an inside edge in the first innings. ""I think this innings was very satisfying for me, the way I played,"" he said. ""In the first 130 balls, I scored 40-odd runs. They were bowling well, and there was some help in the wicket as well. Keeping that in mind, I was very satisfied with the way I was playing.""Reflecting on his approach, he added, ""After lunch, I just thought to play a little bit more of my shots. The wickets were falling from one end, so I wanted to make sure I was getting some runs as well.""Gill acknowledged that competitive match practice is invaluable, no matter how much preparation a player undertakes in training. ""When you’re playing at any level, certain aspects of your game are challenged that you can’t replicate in practice. So, if there’s enough of a gap before the next series, I think it’s very helpful to play matches,"" he remarked.Gill’s introspection and gritty century underscore his commitment to addressing his red-ball challenges as he looks to reclaim consistency in the format.","Shubman Gill scored 102 runs for Punjab against Karnataka in the Ranji Trophy.

'It's all instinctive' - Varun Chakravarthy on his plans for 2nd T20I against England

NEW DELHI: India captain Suryakumar Yadav was full of praise for Tilak Varma after his match-winning knock steered India to a nail-biting two-wicket victory against England in the second T20I in Chennai on Saturday. Tilak's unbeaten 72 off 55 balls anchored India's chase of 166, with four balls to spare, in a game that swung back and forth until the very end.""Very happy with the way Tilak batted,"" said Suryakumar during the post-match presentation. ""Good to see someone like him taking responsibility. Ravi Bishnoi also deserves credit; he has been putting in the hard work in the nets and wants to contribute with the bat. Both of them showed a lot of character today.""The match saw India under pressure at various stages, with the required run rate climbing and wickets falling at crucial moments. With 20 runs needed from the final three overs, Tilak remained calm and placed his faith in Bishnoi, who chipped in with two valuable boundaries, including a flick off Brydon Carse and an edge against Liam Livingstone Reflecting on the tense chase, Suryakumar expressed relief that the team held its nerve. ""A little bit of relief. The way the game was going, we felt 160 was good, but the way they bowled, it was good that the game went down to the wire. We've been playing with an extra batter for the last few series, and that depth really helped today,"" he said.Suryakumar also highlighted the team's aggressive approach, a shift in mindset that has been evident throughout the series. ""The chat was to play like the last game. Good to see we are playing an aggressive brand of cricket. At the same time, the guys put their hands up and stitched the small partnerships. That was key in taking the pressure off,"" he noted.The skipper credited the relaxed atmosphere in the dressing room for enabling the players to express themselves freely. ""The boys have taken off a lot of pressure, and the atmosphere in the dressing room is light. There will be days it won't come off, but we know what we want to do. If we're on the same page, good things will take place,"" he added.India's bowlers also played a pivotal role, restricting England to 165/9 on a two-paced surface. The disciplined effort provided a platform for the batters to chase down the target, despite the mid-innings jitters.","India captain Suryakumar Yadav full of praise for Tilak Varma.

Career and personal life

Bonnie Blue , a 25-year-old OnlyFans creator from Derbyshire , claims to have set a world record by having sex with 1,057 men in 12 hours, reports Daily Mail.The event took place in London, allegedly surpassing the previous record of 919 men in 24 hours set by adult actress Lisa Sparks in 2004, with Bonnie claiming she ""bedded 1,057 in 12 hours.""In a video shared on TikTok, Bonnie thanked those who participated, saying, “Thank you to all the barely legal, barely breathing and the husbands.”She added that her skin looked better after the event and described the experience: “The room was absolutely full. We did groups of five, like one after the other. It was a rotating circle.”Her PR team confirmed the tally, stating, “She slept with 1,057 people. As she hit 1,000, there were still 57 left in the queue who Bonnie wanted to pleasure before ending the 12-hour day.” Calculations suggest she averaged 41 seconds per partner.The stunt sparked outrage online, with comments such as “How embarrassing” and “Sad that men would want to do that too—all for fame and money.” Bonnie is no stranger to controversy, having previously defended her claims of sleeping with “barely legal” 18-year-olds and encouraging men to cheat on their wives.Bonnie's real name is Tia Billinger , who says she earns up to £750,000 a month from her OnlyFans content. Despite criticism, she insists her work is educational. “I can’t think of one situation where an 18-year-old has had sex where they’ve had to bring a passport, sign consent forms, and do a breathalyser,” she said on ITV’s This Morning.She also addressed criticism for sleeping with married men, arguing, “If wives aren’t going to pleasure husbands, let them go elsewhere. It’s just an act; the husbands mean nothing to me.”Bonnie transitioned to sex work after moving to Australia in 2022 with her now ex-husband, Oliver Davidson. Formerly a recruitment professional, she launched her career as a cam girl and later joined OnlyFans.She claims her family now supports her career, with her mother even assisting her business by booking appointments and handing out condoms for marketing. “It’s changed their life completely for the better,” she said.Bonnie defended her actions, stating, “These 18-year-olds can go to the army, they can drive, they can drink… If they want to use their own bodies to come and sleep with me, that is their decision.”","Bonnie Blue, 25, claims to have had sex with 1,057 men in 12 hours.

NEW DELHI: Gukesh Dommaraju, the youngest-ever World Chess Champion, displayed his best version in classical chess during Round 7 of the Tata Steel Chess Tournament 2025 on Saturday in Wijk aan Zee .Facing compatriot Pentala Harikrishna , who also served as his second during the World Chess Championship against Ding Liren, Gukesh opted for the French Opening.Despite Harikrishna's strong start with the black pieces, he made a misstep on move 12 (Nfe7) after white castled early on move 7. Gukesh capitalised on this by exerting dominance in the centre of the board.The 38-year-old GM attempted to reposition his knight with Kf5 but only compounded his troubles, handing further advantage to the youngster.A critical moment came on move 20 when Gukesh's b4 posed a serious threat; however, Harikrishna missed the opportunity for an effective counter.On move 29, Harikrishna captured a pawn with Nxe3, but Gukesh’s reply, Qb7—widely regarded as the best move in the position—steered the game decisively in his favour. The endgame reached its climax when Harikrishna resigned on move 45.With this victory, Gukesh climbed to the top of the Masters leaderboard in the 87th edition of the ""Wimbledon of Chess"", scoring 5/7.Meanwhile, Praggnanandhaa Rameshbabu faced Jorden van Foreest, a former Tata Steel champion. Playing Black, Pragg adopted the Sicilian Defense and skillfully countered the Dutch GM's solid play.A couple of strong moves from the Dutch grandmaster were aptly countered by the Indian GM. With the queens being traded off the board by the end of the 16th move, the game reached a stalemate.Sensing the deadlock, Pragg chose to shake hands and call it a draw, maintaining his position as co-leader of the Masters, with the same points as Gukesh and Nodirbek Abdusattorov.While Gukesh and Pragg had a good day in the office, Arjun Erigaisi 's poor run in the tournament continued as he suffered a heavy loss to Dutchman Max Warmerdam.Playing the Sicilian Defense with the black pieces, Arjun made several early mistakes, giving Max some breathing space. Despite trying to remain compact in the centre of the board for a long time, Arjun took Max's bait and sacrificed his rook with his own rook on the 29th move, which proved fatal for the Indian.Although he showed some resistance with the queen, Arjun resigned with his queen still on the board, and the Indian GM currently finds himself at the bottom of the Masters standings.Elsewhere, Leon Luke Mendonca held off defending champion Wei Yi in a 40-move draw. Notable games included draws between Anish Giri and Abdusattorov, as well as Fabiano Caruana and Alexey Sarana. Vladimir Fedoseev rebounded from a previous loss to secure a victory against Germany’s Vincent Keymer.In the Challengers section, Divya Deshmukh fell to China's rising star Miaoyi Lu, while Vaishali Rameshbabu maintained her strong form with a hard-fought draw against Arthur Pijpers. Thai Dai Van Nguyen and Erwin l'Ami retained the lead in this section with 5/7.","Gukesh Dommaraju defeats Pentala Harikrishna in Tata Steel Chess Tournament 2025.

Road to the final for Madison Keys

Milestones to be achieved

Sabalenka is aiming for a historic three-peat at the Australian Open, a feat last accomplished by Hingis from 1997 to 1999. A victory would also give her a fourth Grand Slam title.

If successful, Sabalenka would become the first woman to win three consecutive hard-court Grand Slam titles this century, following Hingis, who won the 1997 Australian Open, the 1997 US Open, and the 1998 Australian Open. Only three women in the Open Era have achieved three consecutive hard-court majors, and Sabalenka could join Graf, Seles, and Hingis in this exclusive club.

On the other hand, Keys is vying to become the first first-time Grand Slam singles champion since Coco Gauff at the 2023 US Open. This would be her second title of the season and her tenth overall.

Having already defeated No. 2 Swiatek, Keys aims to become the first player to beat both the World No. 1 and No. 2 in a Grand Slam since Svetlana Kuznetsova at the 2009 Roland Garros and the first at the Australian Open since Serena Williams in 2005.

She joins an elite group of five players in the Open Era to achieve this, alongside Martina Navratilova, Steffi Graf, Monica Seles, and Martina Hingis.Keys has fought through four three-set matches to reach her second Grand Slam final, including a match-point saving effort against No. 2 Iga Swiatek in the semis. In the contest that lasted over 2 hours and 35 minutes, Keys showcased her powerful forehand to fend off Swiatek, winning 4-6, 6-1, 7-6(8).This victory marked her third win over a Top-10 seed in the tournament, having previously defeated No. 10 Danielle Collins and No. 6 Elena Rybakina.

By making the final, Sabalenka is assured of keeping her spot as the World No. 1.Madison Keys, meanwhile, has assured her return to the Top-10 for the first time since 2023. If she wins, the American would better her career-high ranking of No.7, which she achieved in 2016.",World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka and No. 14 Madison Keys will meet in the Australian Open final on Saturday. The winner will become the first woman to win three consecutive hard-court Grand Slam titles this century.

Novak Djokovic retires to put Alexander Zverev into Australian Open final,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/novak-djokovic-retires-to-put-alexander-zverev-into-australian-open-final/articleshow/117508162.cms,"Novak Djokovic (AP photo)

NEW DELHI: Novak Djokovic 's quest for a record-breaking 25th Grand Slam title ended prematurely as he retired injured during his Australian Open semi-final against Alexander Zverev on Friday.The 37-year-old Serbian star, who had his upper left leg heavily taped following an injury in the quarter-finals, called it quits after losing a grueling first set 7-6 (7/5).Djokovic's exit from the court was met with a mix of boos and applause from the crowd, as Zverev advanced to his first Melbourne final.This marks the fifth consecutive Grand Slam where Djokovic has failed to secure the title he needs to surpass Margaret Court's record of 24 Grand Slam victories.His last Grand Slam triumph came at the 2023 US Open, raising doubts about his ability to overtake Court's record.The defeat also denied Djokovic his 100th career title, a feat only achieved by Roger Federer (102) in the history of tennis.Zverev will now face either world number one Jannik Sinner or American 21st seed Ben Shelton in Sunday's final.Despite being a two-time Grand Slam runner-up at the 2020 US Open and last year's French Open, this will be Zverev's first appearance in the Australian Open final .Last year, Zverev suffered a heartbreaking defeat to Daniil Medvedev in the semi-finals after holding a 2-0 lead. However, he entered this season with renewed energy, finishing 2024 as world number two and winning more matches than anyone except Sinner, having recovered from a severe ankle injury.Djokovic's fitness was under scrutiny heading into the semi-final, as he required medical attention during his four-set quarter-final victory over Carlos Alcaraz. The Serbian expressed concerns about his physical condition before the match.""It's not like I'm worrying approaching every Grand Slam now whether I'm going to get injured or not, but statistics are against me in a way in the last couple of years,"" he said.""So it is true that, you know, getting injured quite a bit last few years. But I'll keep going. I'll keep striving to win more Slams. And as long as I feel that I want to put up with all of this, I'll be around.""Despite his renowned ability to recover, Djokovic's movement appeared unhindered initially, as evidenced by a 27-shot rally in his opening service game and his ability to save four break points. Zverev also had his share of missed opportunities, failing to convert break points at crucial moments.The match remained on serve until the tiebreak, after which Djokovic ultimately retired due to his injury.",Novak Djokovic retires injured in Australian Open semi-final against Alexander Zverev.

NEW DELHI: After a rest day on Thursday, the Tata Steel Chess Tournament 2025 resumed full throttle on Friday. A dramatic Round 6 unfolded, with Indian chess prodigies making their presence felt in both Masters and Challengers sections amid the chilly weather of Wijk aan Zee .Struggling with three early losses in the tournament, Arjun Erigaisi opted for stability against the top-seeded American, Fabiano Caruana . Playing with the white pieces, Erigaisi opened with the King’s Pawn and steered the game into a Berlin Defense. The Indian grandmaster castled early.By the 22nd move, both queens were off the board, setting the stage for a balanced middlegame. Soon after, the players agreed to a draw through threefold repetition with 30 moves.It was Erigaisi’s third draw of the tournament. Caruana, also grappling with form issues, welcomed the result. For Erigaisi, the draw against a higher-rated opponent is a noteworthy outcome, but whether he can stage a comeback from here remains to be seen.Praggnanandhaa Rameshbabu began his game against the defending champion of the tournament GM Wei Yi of China with a King’s Pawn Opening, met by the Morphy Defense.Wei’s precise counterplay limited Pragg’s opportunities to launch a sustained attack. Queens were traded as early as the 16th move, signalling an imminent draw.The stalemate was eventually formalised after 58 moves, capping a game where both players achieved over 99% accuracy, according to engine analysis.With Gukesh holding Nodirbek Abdusattorov to a draw at the other corner of the room, Praggnanandhaa retains a share of the leaderboard's top spot alongside the Uzbek prodigy.Facing co-leader of ""Wimbledon of Chess"", Nodirbek Abdusattorov, India’s Gukesh D exhibited boldness with black pieces early on in a Giuoco Piano Game.Aggressive play defined the opening stages, but Gukesh’s 45th move (Kf8) allowed Nodirbek to seize the initiative.However, the young Uzbek’s 59th move (Re8) squandered a significant advantage, enabling Gukesh to fight back.After several strong defensive moves, a threefold repetition was agreed, ensuring Gukesh held the youngest-ever World Chess Champion to a draw in an intense battle.Leon Luke Mendonca salvaged his tournament prospects by holding Max Warmerdam of the Netherlands to a draw after a difficult start.Pentala Harikrishna shared points with home favourite Jorden van Foreest, a former champion of the tournament. Dutch No. 1 Anish Giri also drew his game against Germany’s Vincent Keymer.The only decisive result of the day came from Alexey Sarana, who secured a victory against Slovenia’s Vladimir Fedoseev in a strong performance.In the Challengers section, Vaishali Rameshbabu defended skillfully with the black pieces to hold Romania’s Irina Bulmaga to a draw. Meanwhile, Divya Deshmukh suffered a crushing defeat against 11-year-old Argentine sensation Faustino Oro.","After a rest day on Thursday, the Tata Steel Chess Tournament 2025 resumed full throttle on Friday.

CHENNAI: After laying down a marker in the series opener, India have a spring in their step moving into the second T20I against England on Saturday.India, playing a fearless brand of cricket, have been nearly unstoppable in the shortest format ever since head coach Gautam Gambhir and skipper Suryakumar Yadav joined forces. While Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and South Africa were decimated, England, under their new chief coach-captain combination of Brendon McCullum and Jos Buttler , are making an attempt to crack the Indian T20 code.England gave a poor ac count of themselves when trying to stop the Indian juggernaut in Kolkata, where the Men in Blue strolled to victory. The visitors should dish out a much-improved show in the remainder of the five-match assignment to pose any sort of a challenge to the high-flying hosts, beginning with Saturday’s clash. Here are some of the talking points for the Chennai fixture:Returning speedster Mohammed Shami will once again be a point of focus, after being surprisingly left out of the XI for the first game.Since there are only seven competitive fixtures left—four T20Is and three ODIs—ahead of the Champions Trophy, the team management does not have plenty of time to hand Shami a sustained run in the build-up to the global event. But if the thinktank decides to stick with the idea of having just one frontline pacer and three specialist spinners—Varun Chakravarthy, Axar Patel and Ravi Bishnoi—Shami may have to warm the bench again.Shami, wearing a protective gear on his knees, appeared fine on the eve of the encounter, operating along with pace colleague Arshdeep Singh.Spin is likely to have a say on a fresh black-soil Chepauk pitch. Considering the England batters’ issues against quality spin, India’s slow-bowling department will eye another feast in favourable conditions.“Back in Chennai in blues, I see it as a very important day for me. Playing for my country and in front of my parents and the home crowd will be very special. We will have certain plans, but I will also look to be instinctive depending on the situation. My role is to be aggressive and brave… keep bowling to the stumps,” said Varun on Friday.With Suryakumar recently reaffirming that Sanju Samson is the first-choice wicketkeeper, opener Abhishek Sharma has a lot riding on his performances.Abhishek will have a direct competitor once Yashasvi Jaiswal is back in the T20 scheme of things and must continue to deliver the goods to strengthen his case. The 24-year-old has recently let his willow do the talking with impactful knocks, including the free-flowing 79 on Wednesday.England must find a method to succeed while retaining their aggressive style of play. Making moves to square the series, England have roped in fast bowler Brydon Carse for Gus Atkinson, the pacer who was taken to the cleaners last game.",India beat England by eight wickets in the first T20I in Kolkata. The second match takes place at Chepauk in Chennai on Saturday. Mohammed Shami will be a point of focus for India after being left out of the first game.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117541821,imgsize-50516,width-400,resizemode-4/117541821.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Former Australian captain Ricky Ponting has advised the Australian selectors to include young opener Sam Konstas in the playing XI for the upcoming Test series against Sri Lanka in Galle.With Australia having already secured a spot in the ICC World Test Championship final against South Africa, they can approach the Sri Lanka series with a relaxed mindset.Ponting believes that Konstas, who impressed during his debut against India in the Boxing Day Test, should be given an opportunity to gain valuable experience in the challenging Sri Lankan conditions.""I think they will pick Konstas and I think they should pick Konstas. He is the one they have identified, he has hit the ground running here in his first innings as well. He provided a lot of entertainment and a lot of buzz around that whole series (against India),"" Ponting told Sydney Morning Herald .""I think they need to play him, to be honest. It is a hard place to play and a hard place to win. It will be a hard place to bat for all of our guys, but especially some of the younger guys who have not experienced those conditions much in the past. But I think they should pick him, it will be a great learning experience for him.""The 19-year-old showcased positive intent and the ability to unsettle the Indian bowlers, scoring 113 runs in four innings.While Australia is considering shuffling their batting order to accommodate the spin-friendly conditions in Sri Lanka, with Travis Head potentially opening alongside Usman Khawaja , Ponting emphasised the importance of investing in Konstas' Test career.""I would be picking him if I was a selector,"" he added. ""I think the order will stay the same. I think it will be the same with the option they have is maybe playing another spinner. They will have Beau Webster there who will give the seam-up overs, one of the quicks is going to miss out, so Cooper Connolly might find himself in a 7 or 8 batting spot and bowling a few overs as well.""","Former Australian captain Ricky Ponting has advised the Australian selectors to include young opener Sam Konstas in the playing XI for the upcoming Test series against Sri Lanka.

CHENNAI: Stars returning to play domestic tournaments has been the hot topic of discussion in Indian cricket of late, especially with coach Gautam Gambhir and the BCCI making it clear that domestic outings are a must for those who want to play for India.Varun Chakravarthy , a key component of India’s T20I set-up, on Friday echoed Gambhir’s views, emphasising that consistently featuring for his state side Tamil Nadu in white-ball competitions has contributed to his growth as a spinner. “Definitely, it gives me the rhythm (before joining the India team). The level in domestic cricket is extremely high. I would say that it is almost on par with the IPL and the international matches that we play,” said Varun on the eve of the second India-England T20I here.Varun finished as the second-highest wicket-taker in the recent Vijay Hazare Trophy (50 overs) with 18 scalps in six matches and also shone in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy (T20). “I would suggest to everyone to go and play the Mushtaq Ali Trophy as it is very challenging. We play on small grounds and I find it very tough playing the SMAT.“It (domestic cricket) has definitely helped me get better, be more instinctive and on my toes. It has also helped me to think correctly at the right time,” Varun said.‘Should be ready for all challenges’: Varun stressed that the bowlers must try to stay one step ahead of the batters, even though T20 has become a batter-dominated format with favourable surfaces and small-sized boundaries.“In T20s, almost everywhere, the grounds are very small. Bowlers have the challenge of bowling from smaller ends. We plan for that as well. If we say that the batters are looking to have an aggressive approach, that is how T20 is. I cannot complain or be shocked by their (England’s) approach. I am expecting it and I have certain plans for that. Let us see if they work.”The 33-year-old also said that he has been putting in the hard yards to turn into a multi-utility cricketer across levels. “I have been working on my batting for the last six to seven months. I started my preparation at Kolkata Knight Riders, with the help of Abhishek Nayar (current India assistant coach). That kind of helped me. There is still a lot of work to do.”",Varun Chakravarthy says playing for Tamil Nadu in domestic tournaments has helped his development as a spinner.

NEW DELHI: In a remarkable display of sportsmanship, the spirit of cricket took center stage during an ILT20 encounter between Gulf Giants and MI Emirates on Saturday evening.The incident occurred on the last ball of the 18th over of the Giants' innings when Tom Curran , at the non-striker's end, was involved in an unusual dismissal.Facing Alzarri Joseph ’s delivery, the batters ran a single to long-off, and Curran returned to his crease. However, believing the over had concluded, Curran walked out prematurely.The ball had yet to be declared dead, and a quick throw to Nicholas Pooran resulted in the third umpire ruling him run-out by the book.The confusion and subsequent ruling left Gulf Giants’ coach Andy Flower visibly displeased. Curran had not intended to steal a run; it was an honest lapse in judgment.While the dismissal was within the laws of the game, MI Emirates chose to prioritize sportsmanship over strict enforcement.They decided to withdraw their appeal, allowing Curran to resume batting. The gesture drew widespread admiration, exemplifying the true essence of fair play in cricket.Watch:This moment proved pivotal as Curran, joined by lower-order teammates, played a crucial role in Gulf Giants’ dramatic two-wicket win. He contributed to the final stages of their tense chase of 152 at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi.Such moments are rare in the high-pressure environment of professional cricket, where every advantage can define outcomes. MI Emirates’ decision showcased that the spirit of the game remains as important as the result, reminding fans why cricket is often referred to as the ""gentleman's game"".While Gulf Giants secured a thrilling last-ball victory, this incident left a lasting impression, demonstrating that the values of fairness and respect can shine even amidst the most intense competition.This act by MI Emirates transcended the game, setting a benchmark for sportsmanship in modern cricket.","Tom Curran was run-out by the third umpire on the last ball of the 18th over.

NEW DELHI: Alex Hales and Sam Curran 's blistering knocks powered the Desert Vipers to a comprehensive eight-wicket victory over the Sharjah Warriorz in their recent encounter at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium.Chasing a modest target of 152, the duo forged a remarkable 128-run partnership off just 65 balls, effectively turning the chase into a one-sided affair.Hales set the tone with a blistering 36-ball half-century, while Curran followed suit with a scintillating 33-ball fifty. Their onslaught ensured the Vipers sealed the win in just 14.5 overs, inching closer to the play-offs stage.Earlier, the Vipers' bowlers laid the foundation for the victory. David Payne struck early, claiming two wickets, while UAE's Khuzaima Tanveer ripped through the middle and lower order with an impressive four-wicket haul. Jason Roy 's spirited 55 off 38 balls provided a brief respite for the Warriorz, but their total of 151/8 proved insufficient.The Warriorz had an ideal start, with Adam Milne removing Fakhar Zaman and Dan Lawrence within the first four overs. However, Hales and Curran seized control, initially cautious before unleashing a barrage of boundaries. Hales reached his half-century with three consecutive sixes, whileCurran hammered Adam Zampa and Tim Southee, sealing the deal for the Vipers.Player of the Match, Khuzaima Tanveer said:Whenever I play cricket, I truly enjoy it without feeling any pressure. The captain gave me a clear plan to hit the deck hard, and I simply executed it, which led to taking wickets. Overall, I'm really enjoying my time out there""Sharjah Warriorz captain Tim Southee said: ""We got ourselves into a good position but lost too many wickets in the back half. We've shown glimpses of quality but haven’t been able to string enough together. With four games left, the equation is pretty simple. It was tough in the first few overs, and we needed to take regular wickets. On a positive note, it was great to see Jason Roy back in form""In the first innings, Payne's early breakthroughs left the Warriorz searching for stability. Tom Kohler-Cadmore and Roy responded with intent, building a 50-run partnership before Wanindu Hasaranga dismissed Kohler-Cadmore for 42.Roy continued to lead the charge, reaching his half-century in 35 balls, but his dismissal in the 17th over derailed the death overs.Tanveer's decisive spell dismantled the middle and lower order, while Ashton Agar's late cameo pushed the total to 151/8. Ultimately, the Vipers' clinical batting performance, led by Hales and Curran, proved too much for the Warriorz, as the Vipers inched closer to the play-offs.",Desert Vipers beat Sharjah Warriorz by eight wickets.

NEW DELHI: Jos Buttler displayed a semblance of resistance, but the rest of England ’s batting order faltered against India’s spinners, resulting in the visitors being restricted to165/9 in the second T20I in Chennai on Saturday.Buttler (45 off 30 balls, 2 fours, 3 sixes) played some elegant strokes, including a 4, 6, 4 sequence off Arshdeep Singh, who struck early by dismissing Phil Salt in the first over.Salt’s pull shot lacked the distance, and Washington Sundar , replacing the injured Nitish Kumar Reddy, held a straightforward catch near square leg.Washington added to England’s woes by removing Ben Duckett, whose reverse sweep landed in Dhruv Jurel’s hands, another replacement in the XI for injured Rinku Singh The pull shot continued to haunt the English batters, claiming Buttler and Liam Livingstone. Axar Patel (2/32) exploited the surface's grip to stifle England's intent, dismissing Buttler and Livingstone with well-directed deliveries.Brydon Carse, in for Gus Atkinson, provided late resistance with a fiery 31 off 17 balls, including three sixes. However, a miscommunication with Jofra Archer ended his promising knock.The highlight was Harry Brook’s dismissal by Varun Chakravarthy (2/38), who breached his defence with a deceptive back-of-the-hand delivery. Despite some late blows, England’s struggles against India’s spinners remain a point of concern.","Buttler (45 off 30 balls, 2 fours, 3 sixes) played some elegant strokes, including a 4, 6, 4 sequence off Arshdeep Singh.

Rahane showers praise on J&K seamers

MUMBAI: Mumbai may have won the Ranji Trophy 42 times, but Jammu & Kashmir can claim some serious bragging rights by saying that they have beaten the domestic giants in both their meetings in the Ranji Trophy, held in the space of a decade!Karnataka, who are the big boys of domestic cricket, are the only other team who have managed to have scored two consecutive outright wins over Mumbai in the Ranji Trophy-in the 2014-15 & 2017-18 season. Talk about J&K being the true giant-killers!On Saturday, J&K knocked off the remaining three Mumbai wickets for the addition of just 16 runs. Resuming at 274 for seven, the hosts lost their overnight centurion Shardul Thakur (119, 135b, 18x4) when he was caught at cover off seamer Auqib Nabi. Pacer Yudhvir Singh then castled Tanush Kotian (62, 136b, 6x4) with a superb inswinger, while last man Mohit Avasthi (4) was run out.Chasing 205, J&K were coasting at 112 for one, before they suffered a few anxious moments as their batters kept losing their wickets while trying to smash left-arm spinner Shams Mulani (four for 54) out of the ground. However, opener Shubham Khajuria (45, 89b, 5x4), Yawer Hussain (24) Vivrant Sharma (38, 69b, 5x4), Abid Mushtaq (38, 69b, 5x4) and Kanhaiya Wadhawan (19 not out) all made vital contributions to see their team home at the stroke of tea. Mushtaq, who sealed J&K’s famous win by sweeping Tanish Kotian for a six, added 48 in just 43 balls for the sixth wicket with Wadhawan.While J&K’s four-wicket win over Mumbai in the 2014-15 season at the Wankhede Stadium was historic, their five-wicket triumph at the Sharad Pawar Academy in BKC had a special taste to it as Mumbai, unlike the last time, were star-studded and the defending Ranji champions on this occasion.Considering the names on the Mumbai team sheet for this match, any opposition would’ve been intimidated. There was Rohit Sharma , Yashasavi Jaiswal, Shreyas Iyer and allrounders Shardul Thakur and Shivam Dube. Leading Mumbai was 85-Test veteran Ajinkya Rahane . And the man who walked away with the Player of the Match award was J&K’s impressive seamer Yudhvir Singh, who took seven for 95 in 23.2 overs (4-31 in 8.2 overs & 3-64 in 15 overs), troubling Mumbai’s star-studded batsmen throughout the match.After downing Mumbai, the unfancied J&K have rocketed to the top of the table in Group A, and, with 29 points in six matches, need to just log one point in their final outing against Baroda to secure a knockout berth.On the other hand, the stunning defeat has seriously jeopardized Mumbai’s chances of advancing to the knockouts. If Baroda (27 from five games), who are currently playing Maharashtra, gain a first-innings lead against J&K in their last game, Mumbai (22 from six games and presently placed third in Elite Group A) would be knocked out of the group league phase even if they win with bonus points against Meghalaya at BKC.The last league matches will be played from Jan 30, with Mumbai’s KO hopes hanging by a thread. “There’s still a one per cent chance for us to qualify. So, you never know. Our main thing is to learn from this game,” said Rahane.With scores of 3 & 28, Rohit couldn’t achieve much out of this outing. It didn’t help Mumbai that they had to drop talented in-form young opener Ayush Mhatre (408 runs opener in five matches, with two centuries in his debut Ranji season) to accommodate the 37-year-old and Jaiswal (4 & 26) for this match.Rahane, meanwhile, was whole-hearted in his praise for J&K, especially their bowlers.“Firstly, let's give credit to Jammu and Kashmir. I thought they played this game really well. They bowled consistently in the right areas and challenged our batting line-up, especially in both the innings, so credit to them. As I mentioned before the game, we are not going to take any team lightly and we didn't take anyone lightly. I think we were not up to the mark as a team, as a unit. They challenged us and played really well, so they deserved to win,” Rahane complimented.The Mumbai captain was especially impressed by J&K pacers Auqib Nabi (2-36 & 4-80), Umar Nazir (4-41 & 2-79) and Yudhvir, who took 19 wickets between them to demolish Mumbai’s batting line-up for 120 in the first innings, and restrict them to 290 in the second dig. Rahane admitted, though, that Mumbai didn’t expect the wicket to help the pacers to this extent, especially on Day One, when Mumbai were shot out for just 120.“There’s quite a bit of talent in their line-up, especially in fast bowling. I think this season they've been doing really well. We saw their fast bowlers’ videos. They read the conditions really well. Frankly, we didn't expect that ball to seam around that much. We thought it would be a good wicket to bat and it will spin on day two but obviously they bowled really well,” Rahane explained.",Jammu & Kashmir beat Mumbai by five wickets in the Ranji Trophy. Unfancied J&K have rocketed to the top of the table in Group A. Mumbai's KO hopes are hanging by a thread after the stunning defeat.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117556186,imgsize-47594,width-400,resizemode-4/117556186.jpg"
