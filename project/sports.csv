Fast bowler Pat Cummins led the bowling unit with a hat-trick and David Warner 's unbeaten half-century ensured no hiccups with the bat as Australia cruised to a win over Bangladesh in their 'Super 8s' match in Group 1 of the T20 World Cup , even as rain threatened to play spoilsport in Antigua on Friday (IST).Australia secured a 28-run victory over Bangladesh via the DLS method, thanks to the exceptional performances of Cummins and leg-spinner Adam Zampa before Warner & Co took charge of the run-chase.Cummins claimed the tournament's first hat-trick in the final overs, while Zampa showcased his precision in the middle overs, as Bangladesh were restricted to 140 for 8 after being asked to bat first by Mitchell Marsh.Australia's chase was led by the experienced Warner, who smashed an unbeaten 53 off just 35 balls, including five fours and three sixes. Along with Travis Head (31), Warner got the Aussies off to a flying start, racing to 60/0 before rain interrupted play.Despite losing some momentum after the break, with young leg-spinner Rishad Hossain (2/23 in 3 overs) dismissing Head and Mitchell Marsh (1) in quick succession, Australia remained in control. Warner, playing in his last T20 World Cup, brought up his half-century with a majestic six, showcasing his dominance.When rain stopped play for the second time, Australia were comfortably ahead of the DLS par score, with 100 for 2 in 11.2 overs, 28 runs ahead of the required target of 72. The victory showcased the depth and quality of the Australian team, as they continue their march ahead in the tournament strongly.In the opening over of the match, Mitchell Starc, the left-arm pacer, provided Australia with the anticipated early breakthrough by dismissing Tanzid Hasan. With this wicket, Starc surpassed Sri Lankan legend Lasith Malinga to become the leading wicket-taker in World Cups with 95 scalps.The innings was stabilized by Litton Das (16) and captain Najmul Hossain Shanto (41), who put together a 58-run partnership. In the fourth over, Shanto hit a six off Josh Hazlewood over long-on. He then targeted Starc, hitting a couple of fours in the fifth over.However, Zampa immediately ended the partnership, trapping Das leg before wicket in the ninth over. Australian spinners Zampa and Glenn Maxwell applied pressure on Bangladesh, restricting them to only 26 runs from the ninth to the 13th over while also dismissing Rishad Hossain (2) besides taking the crucial wicket of Shanto, who fell to Zampa.Hridoy (40 off 28) helped Bangladesh surpass the 100-run mark and attempted to boost his team's total. He hit consecutive sixes off Marcus Stoinis. However, Cummins made a significant impact in the latter stages of the innings, dashing any hopes of a strong finish by Bangladesh.At the end of the 18th over, Cummins took wickets off successive deliveries. Mahmudullah tried to play a pull shot but ended up playing the ball back onto his stumps. Cummins then had Mahedi Hasan caught by Zampa. He returned to bowl the final over and dismissed Hridoy with his first ball, completing the hat-trick -- the first of this T20 World Cup.",Australia beat Bangladesh by 28 runs in Group 1 of T20 World Cup in Antigua. Fast bowler Pat Cummins took a hat-trick and David Warner hit an unbeaten 53. The Aussies reached 100-2 in 11.2 overs before rain stopped play for the second time.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111156855,imgsize-52336,width-400,resizemode-4/111156855.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Upbeat England endeavor to take a monumental leap towards the semi-finals of the T20 World Cup against South Africa on Friday.England suffered a resounding defeat the previous instance they confronted the Proteas. That Mumbai encounter, seven months prior, was arguably the nadir of England's abysmal defense of their 50-over World Cup title.That was one of six losses in nine games for England as they failed to reach the knockout stage in India.However, it appears Buttler's men are mounting a superior defense of their T20 World Cup crown, with England overpowering co-hosts the West Indies by eight wickets in St. Lucia on Wednesday.Another victory for England in St. Lucia against the Proteas would virtually guarantee a semi-final berth.Several of the players that featured for both England and South Africa in India will be involved again on Friday.However, England opener Phil Salt, who made a scintillating unbeaten 87 against the West Indies, and in-form fast bowler Jofra Archer had no part in that dire defeat in October.This tournament marked Archer's return to international duty after a protracted injury absence.Archer certainly had one of those while bowling a remarkable 16th over to West Indies' dangerman Nicholas Pooran, the leading run-scorer in the tournament.He did not concede a run off five of his six balls and also dismissed Pooran.By contrast, Salt hammered Romario Shepherd for 30 in the one over of England's innings.England now face another big-hitter in Heinrich Klaasen, whose brutal hundred was the cornerstone of South Africa's victory in Mumbai.The highly anticipated fifth match of the Super Eights in the T20 World Cup 2024 will feature a clash between England (ENG) and South Africa (SA). Scheduled for June 21 at 8:00 PM IST, the game will take place at the Daren Sammy National Cricket Stadium, Gros Islet in St Lucia.In their previous 24 T20I meetings, both teams have won an equal numbers of matches -- 12 each.It is a high scoring pitch with a shorter boundary to the right. It is a good surface to bat with a few scratch marks. Very hard surface with not too much live grass. There will be some extra bounce, but very true bounce so batters can cut, pull and drive more easily.A batting paradise, top-order batsmen are expected to be key performers on this pitch. Spinners will have a few say too.Phil Salt from England, in red-hot form, could be a game-changer again, given his ability to score big in quick time.Jofra Archer, also from England, has been impressive on his return to cricket after injury break, particularly effective with both new and old ball.Quinton de Kock of South Africa has return to top form in the previous match, and will play a vital role in his team's batting lineup again, making him a strong fantasy pick.Philip Salt, Jos Buttler(w/c), Jonny Bairstow, Harry Brook, Moeen Ali, Liam Livingstone, Sam Curran, Jofra Archer, Adil Rashid, Mark Wood, Reece Topley, Ben Duckett, Will Jacks, Chris Jordan, Tom HartleyQuinton de Kock(w), Reeza Hendricks, Aiden Markram(c), David Miller, Heinrich Klaasen, Tristan Stubbs, Marco Jansen, Keshav Maharaj, Kagiso Rabada, Anrich Nortje, Tabraiz Shamsi, Ryan Rickelton, Ottneil Baartman, Bjorn Fortuin, Gerald CoetzeeBatters: Philip Salt, Jos Buttler, Heinrich Klaasen, Jonny Bairstow, David MillerWicketkeeper: Quinton de KockAll-rounders: Moeen Ali, Sam CurranBowlers: Jofra Archer, Anrich Nortje, Tabraiz Shamsi","England take on South Africa in the fifth match of the T20 World Cup 2024.

T20 World Cup: 'Be careful Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma!'

Virat Kohli is itching to rediscover his batting touch as India refocus at the T20 World Cup with their first match of the ' Super 8s ' against Afghanistan in Barbados on Thursday.Opening the batting with skipper Rohit Sharma , Kohli hasn't had the kind of start his fans expected of him at the T20 World Cup, with his three innings totaling a mere 5 runs in 9 balls.Kohli's knocks of 1, 4 and 0 have also raised questions whether asking him to open is a correct move. However, playing in the same position for Royal Challengers Bengaluru, Kohli scored a tournament-highest 741 runs in the 2024 season of the Indian Premier League just before the T20 World Cup.Facing up to the tricky Afghanistan at the Kensington Oval on Thursday, Kohli and Rohit will be up against a challenge that former South Africa speedsterDale Steyn sees as a big danger for the Indian openers""Be careful Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma; he can knock your pegs up,"" said Steyn in a Star Sports video, talking about the in-form Afghan pacer Fazalhaq Farooqi.The left-arm fast bowler has invariably tore into opposition's top order in this tournament, and his wicket-taking consistency has put him on top of the bowling charts with 12 wickets in four matches, including a best of 5 for 9. Farooqui's economy rate of 5.58 is as impressive as his wickets tally.Among the Afghan batters, Steyn felt opener Rahmanullah Gurbaz can get stuck into the Indian pacers, which makes his duel with Jasprit Bumrah as the one to watch out for.Interestingly, while Steyn alerted Kohli and Rohit to the danger posed by Farooqi, the South African didn't pick either of the two openers as the Indian batsman to watch out for in the contest.""Starting with India, from a bowling point of view, Jasprit Bumrah. Absolutely phenomenal! He's great with all three disciplines - Tests, T20s, ODIs,"" said Steyn.Talking about Indian batting, Steyn said, ""SKY (Suryakumar Yadav) is gonna come good with the bat. Just watch out for him from India's point of view.""India and Afghanistan are placed in Group 1 of the 'Super 8s' stage alongside Australia and Bangladesh.",Virat Kohli has scored just 5 runs in three innings at the T20 World Cup. Former South Africa fast bowler Dale Steyn has warned the Indian openers to be careful of Afghan pacer Fazalhaq Farooqi. Steyn picked Jasprit Bumrah as the one to watch out for in the contest.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111130453,imgsize-194682,width-400,resizemode-4/111130453.jpg"

NEW DELHI: A fearless half-century from swashbuckling Suryakumar Yadav was followed by a special spell from Jasprit Bumrah as India secured a commanding 47-run victory over Afghanistan in their opening Super 8 fixture of the T20 World Cup on Thursday in Barbados.Suryakumar's quick-fire 53 off 28 balls helped set a challenging total of 181 for 8 on a tricky surface at Kensington Oval after Afghanistan's Rashid Khan took three key wickets.Bumrah's stellar bowling, yielding three wickets for just seven runs in four overs and Kuldeep Yadav’s impactful performance in the middle overs, who took two wickets for 32 runs, restricted Afghanistan to 134 all out.Skipper Rashid tried his best, claiming three wickets for 26 runs, but Afghanistan's questionable shot selection hampered their chase.The defeat extended Afghanistan's winless streak against India in T20Is.In the second over of Afghanistan's innings, Rahmanullah Gurbaz, after hitting a six and four off Arshdeep Singh, went for a rash shot against Bumrah and was caught behind. Hazratullah Zazai, who replaced the injured Mujeeb Zadran, was Bumrah's next victim, caught at backward point by Ravindra Jadeja.Playing his first game of the tournament, Kuldeep made his presence felt with a crucial dismissal of Gulbadin Naib in the 11th over.Azmatullah Omarzai was Afghanistan's top scorer with 26 runs off 20 balls.The fall of wickets through the innings did not allow Afghanistan to get back in the game.Earlier, Surya displayed his signature nonchalant style, picking boundaries at will while others struggled.Rishabh Pant contributed a quick 20 off 11 balls and Hardik Pandya added a brisk 32 off 24.

Pant saw some success against spinners with sweeps and reverse sweeps before falling to Rashid.Kohli's wicket fell in Rashid’s second over and Shivam Dube was trapped lbw by Rashid after the ball turned sharply.Suryakumar eased the tension with a flurry of sweeps against Rashid. He then continued to find big hits, including an impressive sweep of a wide full toss from Azmatullah Omarzai and a combination of six and four off Farooqi to reach his half-century.After Suryakumar's departure, Hardik Pandya stepped up, hitting a few sixes, including one powerful shot off left-arm spinner Noor Ahmed that nearly shattered a window in the press box.India's final total of 181 for 8 was their highest at this historic venue, ultimately proving to be unassailable.India opted to bat first on a pitch where the ball held up early, making it difficult to play through the line, but they managed to post a solid total.Skipper Rohit admitted the pitch was challenging but expressed satisfaction with the total.India's bowling unit then delivered a clinical performance to seal the win.India will face Bangladesh in their next Super 8 fixture in Antigua on Saturday.",India beat Afghanistan by 47 runs in their opening Super 8 fixture of the T20 World Cup.

The World Cup-winner described the regulation as being ""unfair"" to finger spinners.In October 2011, the ICC introduced this specific rule for ODIs, which the iconic Sachin Tendulkar had described as ""perfect recipe for disaster.""""One thing I would definitely change is the use of two new balls, especially in white-ball cricket,"" Gambhir said, as quoted by PTI, during the 'Rise to Leadership' talk show by the Indian Chamber of Commerce in Kolkata.The requirement to utilize a pair of new balls, according to numerous specialists, has put finger spinners at a disadvantage and decreased the likelihood of reverse swing, as it enables the ball to maintain its shine for a longer duration.""It is very unfair for finger spinners, who are not playing enough white-ball cricket because there is nothing for them. It is not right.""The ICC's job is to ensure that everyone, whether a finger spinner, fast bowler, wrist spinner, or batter, has an equal opportunity to showcase their talents,"" said Gambhir, who recently mentored Kolkata Knight Riders during their run to the third IPL title.Gambhir, a strong contender for the position of India's head coach afterRahul Dravid 's departure following the current T20 World Cup, has called upon the ICC to reassess a particular regulation.""Taking that opportunity away from certain players is very unfair. Today, you hardly see any finger spinners playing white-ball cricket. Why? The blame lies not with them, but with the ICC.""There is no reverse swing anymore because of the two new balls, and there is nothing for finger spinners or left-arm spinners.""This is something I would want to change, and hopefully, it will change to create a balance between bat and ball,"" added Gambhir.Gambhir has played under the leadership of several captains throughout his career. While he chose not to single out the best captain he played under, Gambhir praised MS Dhoni and acknowledged that his finest cricketing years were during Dhoni's tenure as skipper.""This is such a controversial question. I honestly don't want to give headlines, everyone had their strengths and weaknesses. I made my Test debut under Rahul Dravid and ODI under (Sourav) Ganguly.""I had my best performance under Anil Kumble and I had my phase under MS Dhoni, and the longest I played was under MS.

BRIDGETOWN: There’s no time to rest. India had just finished a comprehensive win against Afghanistan at the Kensington Oval on Thursday, but even before they could catch their breath, Rohit Sharma’s boys were on the road again. It’s going to be like this till the end of the World Cup. This time it’s destination Antigua , where they take on neighbours Bangladesh, who haven’t really been a match for India over the years.The pitch at the Vivian Richards Stadium isn’t what it used to be. The pace and bounce that were so integral to cricket in this part of the world is a thing of the past and now it’s only spin, spin and more spin.Quite predictably, India shifted from their four-pacer theory in the USA leg of the World Cup to a three-spin line-up, with Kuldeep Yadav being added to a lineup which already included Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel .Kuldeep took 2-32 against the Afghans after star pacer Jasprit Bumrah had done the early damage. The Indian attack is truly looking very balanced.Bangladesh, too, during the course of their loss to Australia in Antigua in a day-nighter on Thursday, played four spinners. Offies Mahedi Hassan and Mahmadullah will be backed by leggie Rishad Hossain and left-arm spinner Shakib Al Hassan.On paper, Bangladesh have a bit of depth, but that doesn’t count for much in a game against India. Man to man, India’s spinners are better than Bangladesh, the Indian batters’ ability against spin should also stand them in good stead.Suryakumar Yadav is probably the best player of spin in limited-overs cricket and he has been in supreme touch of late, scoring two back-to-back, match-winning half-centuries. Shivam Dube, too, is a monster against spin, and so is Rishabh Pant.Virat Kohli is still due for a big score but batting coach Vikram Rathour seems hardly bothered.“Obviously we want him to score but even when he hasn’t, the others have chipped in, which is a good sign. But Virat stays at the top of the order and we know he will get the runs,” Rathour said.Though there is a quiet confidence about the way India are going about their job, there can always be a worry that complacency may creep into the ranks, especially against a team that isn’t fancied on paper. And the World Cup is being played in such a format that one defeat can suddenly make qualification difficult, especially with the threat of rain always round the corner.While India will be keen not to have a curtailed game — Antigua doesn’t have any rain forecast in the next couple of days — Rathour insisted that the team is taking all measures to ensure they don’t lose focus ahead of a match like this.“We know what we are expected to do and everyone understands that. There is absolutely no option for any kind of complacency,” Rathour said.The fact that Bangladesh have a bit of depth in their spin attack has also kept the Indian management on their toes.“They have some experienced spinners in conditions which are favourable for spin. And they are a good team, there’s a reason why they are in the Super 8,” the batting coach warned.The likes of Shakib, Najmul Hossain Shanto, Liton Das or Mustafizur Rahman have been playing India for a very long time and it is not that they haven’t troubled the Men in Blue on an odd occasion or two, especially in bilateral T20 cricket.Left-arm medium pacer Mustafizur, not too long ago, looked particularly good playing for Chennai Super Kings in the IPL and his cutters may just be effective on a pitch like Antigua’s. Add to that the extra gear that Bangladesh will try to find, especially because it’s India and their survival in the World Cup is on the line. India will have to avoid any possible pitfalls.","India take on Bangladesh in their second T20 of the World Cup in Antigua. The match will be played on a pitch that is more favourable to spin.

BRIDGETOWN: The overriding theme of this T20 World Cup , from now on, is going to be spin bowling. How teams deal with spin is going to be key. Yes, there’s also a Jasprit Bumrah or a Pat Cummins who are masters of their craft — fast bowling — and can win games in all conditions, but it’s the tweakers who will call the shots.India, in their team selection, have been quite unorthodox, to say the least.Once they landed in the West Indies, they opted to go in with three left-arm spinners, something we don’t always see teams doing.Captain Rohit Sharma has been adamant going into this World Cup — probably his last as captain — he won’t care for reputation and will go with instinct and current form. Hence, it’s Ravindra Jadeja , Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav together, unless of course there are seamer-friendly conditions available, as Rohit pointed out after the win on Thursday.Even though Jadeja, Axar and Kuldeep are left-armers, they are not necessarily the same bowlers. As for Jadeja and Axar, the release points are not the same, because the Gujarat man is taller. So the bounce and the angles that are generated are different and the use of the crease is also not the same.Jadeja comes closer to the stumps while Axar normally prefers to go slightly wider while delivering the ball. Kuldeep, meanwhile, is a wrist-spinner who is a completely different kettle of fish. He is an out-and-out attacking option. Rohit looks to buy wickets with him, even if it is at the cost of a few runs, as was the case against Afghanistan.Axar, who is one of the key components of this attacking formation, explained how they go about their job.“We have played quite a bit together and we communicate well. Whoever comes to bowl first lets the other know what is working and what is not. I think that is very important when you work as a bowling unit,” Axar said.While Kuldeep and Jadeja are the ones who are brought into action after the Powerplay is over, Axar often bowls in the first six overs as well, when nine fielders are inside the ring.“I can bowl in the Powerplay, middle or towards the end, in the 15th or 16th overs. I know my role well and can be called by the captain in any situation. My plan is to know what the team needs at that time — if there is a need for wickets I go for it, if the choice is to defend, I try that,” Axar said.The left-armer explained that with examples from the Pakistan game in New York, where Axar bowled a superb 16th over to turn the game around.“In that game, I felt that if I give less runs in the 16th over, that would be very good for the team. So, basically according to the situation, I plan my bowling,” Axar said.Jadeja is more or less similar, just that his role is slightly more restricted between the 7th and 15th overs. He has been doing it for CSK for a long time now and if he can translate his IPL performances into something similar in the World Cup, India can go from strength to strength.","The overriding theme of this T20 World Cup, from now on, is going to be spin bowling.

NEW DELHI: Wicket-keepers are known to be livewires on the field. One of their unofficial tasks is to cheer up their teammates when the shoulders are down.And Rishabh Pant is known for this. He is quite 'chirpy' behind the stumps and always tends to be over-excited whether asking for a review for going for a catch.And then comes captain Rohit Sharma who is quite laidback in his attitude and tends to take things easily, which reflects in his batting also and even makes his lazy elegance look stylish.A quite hilarious moment occurred during the India-Afghanistan Super 8 T20 World Cup match that India won by 47 runs on Thursday.Kuldeep Yadav bowled the 11th over of the Afghanistan run chase and Gulbadin Naib mishit the second delivery high up in the air over the covers.Pant ran from behind the stumps shouting ""mine, mine"". Rohit who could have also gone for the catch, remained stationed at his position hardly moving an inch.To Pant's credit, he made the catch look simple but he had to cover some distance while keeping his eyes on the ball.And to Rohit's credit, he chose not to disturb Pant in taking the catch and in his typical style seemed to have said, ""All yours"".As Pant completed the catch, he even threw the ball to his skipper who still didn't catch it!The International Cricket Council ( ICC ) shared a video of the moment on their Instagram handle:The Indian cricket team now heads to Antigua to face Bangladesh on Saturday.","Rishabh Pant ran from behind the stumps shouting ""mine, mine"".

BRIDGETOWN: There are times you feel for Rashid Khan . Shane Warne used to call him the best modern-day spinner. However, there isn’t enough international success to back up such a claim.Take Thursday’s game, for example. The spinner was outstanding against an Indian batting lineup that is probably the best against spin across the globe. He had figures of 3/26. The wickets in his bag were that of Virat Kohli, Rishabh Pant and Shivam Dube, all excellent players of spin. Yet, the first question coach Jonathan Trott and Rashid himself had to face after the defeat was whether the skipper did the right thing by finishing his quota of overs within the 15th over.While Rashid was smiling sitting at the other end of the table, Trott categorically said that “it was definitely not the reason why Afghanistan lost the match”.But that’s the predicament of Rashid in a team like Afghanistan, where he doesn’t always get the support to churn out consistent winning performances. In a way, he at times reminds you of Kapil Dev away from home in the late 1970s and through the 1980s.When Trott was asked about Rashid’s role, the coach’s first reaction was: “How much time do we have? With all great players it’s often what they do off the field, that’s not in front of the cameras. The way they conduct themselves. Rashid is sitting here and he won’t mind me saying, setting high standards for themselves that take others with them and inspire other people is what he does,” Trott said.While Rashid is probably the best spinner playing in this World Cup, the coach insists that he “never stops learning”.“It’s his work ethic, desire, ability to listen and learn, and always wanting to grow and discover, try new deliveries, and push the boundaries of the game,” Trott enlisted the qualities that have made the 25-year-old a global superstar.It’s true that Rashid sets an example for his teammates, but against India it wasn’t enough. There wasn’t enough help either with the bat or ball that could ensure a win for Afghanistan.You could see Rashid was disappointed, but he tried not to blame his younger colleagues, who according to him “are still new to international cricket”.We have seen time and time again, both in the IPL and international cricket , that despite the options Rashid has, he generally sticks to a plan. He was probably slightly frustrated on Thursday about the fact that his teammates were “trying too many things”.“You don’t need to have so many plans, it is about one clear plan and sticking to it. In your desperation to try many things, if you end up giving three extra boundaries, that’s when the pressure starts to build, especially against top sides,” Rashid said.",Afghanistan lost to India in the T20 World Cup on Thursday. Rashid Khan took three wickets for the hosts. The spinner was outstanding against an Indian batting lineup that is probably the best against spin across the globe.

In Tests, he can bat down the order and in white-ball cricket at the top of the order, so there is similarity with Gilchrist there,” Smith said.The 67-year-old, who was part of Martin Crowe ’s New Zealand team that fell short to Pakistan in the 1992 World Cup semis, is confident that if he continues in the same vein in a few years people “will say Gilchrist and Pant are very close”.When asked who is the best wicketkeeper-batter in the game at the moment, Smith thought for a bit and kept Pant on a par with the likes of Quinton de Kock and Jos Butler .“In white-ball cricket, De Kock is showing good form and is invaluable at the top of the order. Jos Butler is also there, while Pant is a dynamic batsman --- aggressive, dangerous --- and can compliment Virat Kohli orRohit Sharma ,” Smith said.The keeper felt No. 3 is a good spot for Pant, because “best players should have the opportunity to face the most deliveries”. “He can hit the first ball for six he faces…And he has replaced a very good player in KL Rahul, so Pant is really a good player for me.”When asked who his favourite would be to win the World Cup, Smith named both India and Australia. “Both are playing good cricket and they are the favourites for me,” Smith said.",Ian Smith is one of New Zealand ’s greatest wicketkeeper batters.

I think he's very smart.And if you're having those pre-planned shots against him, I think that's where he gets the success. So, that's a kind of learning for us.

But in the middle, when Surya came, that's how he plays. He changed the tempo of the game, and he tries to play his shots. I think that's something which makes him a unique player. He believes in his skills. It doesn't matter wherever he plays, whatever the condition is, that's how much belief he has on his skills,"" he added.Suryakumar Yadav 's blistering knock of 53 runs off just 28 balls proved to be the turning point in India's innings against Afghanistan.His ability to change the tempo of the game and play fearless shots, even in a precarious situation, showcased his unique batting style and unwavering belief in his skills.Rashid Khan's own performance was commendable, as he picked up three crucial wickets, including those of Virat Kohli and Rishabh Pant .However, he acknowledged the limited opportunities he has had against India in his nine-year career, having played only three T20Is against them. Rashid emphasized that judging his record based on such a small sample size would be premature, saying, ""My own performance? Oh, I think this is my second T20I against India or a third. So, I think this record is good enough for three T20s and more important is how you bowl. I don't really see the numbers. It's all about how you're delivering and what you're doing for the team. But in the last nine years of my career, if you play three games, I don't think you can say your record is bad or good. I would still say you have to play more games. And that's where your records get to know if they are good or bad.""Rashid also expressed his desire for Afghanistan to play more cricket against top teams, as bilateral series provide valuable exposure and opportunities to assess their performance against the best sides.

But yeah, these conditions maybe suit us more because we can afford to play two or three spinners at times. So that I believe can be our best team.

Gautam Gambhir is a very misunderstood person: Ashwin,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/gautam-gambhir-is-a-very-misunderstood-person-ashwin/articleshow/111174320.cms,"'Dhoni didn't know someone like me existed'

'Kirsten, an outstanding human being'

NEW DELHI: Veteran spinner Ravichandran Ashwin praised Gautam Gambhir on Friday, describing him as a tenacious and exceptional motivator. Gambhir is the leading candidate to replace Rahul Dravid as India's head coach. Ashwin credited Gambhir with instilling confidence in him during the early stages of his Test career.The spinner reminisced about his conversations with Gambhir during his debut full series for India, which took place against New Zealand in 2012. ""Gambhir was a fighter,"" Ashwin stated, emphasizing the former opener's role in his development as a cricketer.""I was playing my first full series. I only carried drinks during the first two years before the World Cup (in 2011). He gave me a lot of confidence at the beginning (of his career). I was not used to someone beyond my state (Tamil Nadu) giving me that sort of confidence,"" Ashwin, as quoted by PTI, said while launching his book -- I Have the Streets - A Kutti Cricket Story -- in Chennai.Ashwin expressed his views on the former Indian opener, stating that the cricketer's frank and straightforward manner often led to misinterpretation of his character.""Gautam Gambhir is a very misunderstood person. It's all about perception. He is a fighter.""The biggest issue with many of us is that we give hero status to someone in our mind and forget about everyone else. This is a sport, not a movie narrative.""There are no heroes and villains. Gambhir is a competitor. His desire and hunger to win is unbelievable. I have massive respect (for him),"" he added.Ashwin's rise to prominence in the Indian Premier League (IPL) occurred in 2010 when he was selected to play for the Chennai Super Kings , led by the iconic MS Dhoni . This opportunity proved to be a turning point in Ashwin's career, showcasing his skills on a grand stage.However, Ashwin's journey to the IPL spotlight can be traced back to a pivotal moment in the 2008 Challenger Trophy. It was during this tournament that Ashwin managed to catch the eye of Dhoni, who recognized the young spinner's potential.""It's an evolving relationship. MS didn't even know someone like me existed in 2008,"" he remembered.""And because of that, I made it my life's goal -- from 2009, it was to get the wicket of MS Dhoni. When a person has a goal like this, he will go crazy when an opportunity to achieve it pops up.""Ashwin went back to that final match held in Nagpur.""We were playing the Challenger Trophy, and I bowled an unbelievable spell. MS would struggle through that spell in Nagpur. Once, when he tried to play, the ball went through his gates.""I got him out in the final. From then on, I think he saw somebody with skill, and the relationship matured.""Ashwin revealed that once a player gained Dhoni's confidence, they would receive numerous opportunities to showcase their abilities.""One of MS' usual qualities is that, if he decides this horse (a player) is not ready to race, he will not use you. He needs to know you're a horse.""But, once he knows you're a horse, only when you feel like giving up, he will look past you. That is MS Dhoni; he believes in you,"" he added.Ashwin's contribution to India's historic 2011 World Cup triumph was minimal. However, the Tamil Nadu spinner fondly remembered the inclusive atmosphere created by head coach Gary Kirsten and the entire team, ensuring he never felt left out or unappreciated.""After winning (the WC), Gary called me over and said we have not done justice to your talent. You have waited two years, but make no mistake, take it from me -- you will achieve far greater things, and I am upset that I will not be a part of it,"" he reflected.""So, Gary actually resigned (as head coach) with me first before announcing it outside (laughs). It was surprising for me because in all these two years, Gary actually spoke, maybe, 100 lines to me. Gary was a man of few words and an outstanding human being,"" he added.In fact, Ashwin was used sparingly even in the run-up to that World Cup. He offered a reason for that.""One of the reasons why MS did not play me leading up to the World Cup (2011) was the novelty factor. But eventually, I figured out that they would play me.""I was about to play the match against Pakistan (2nd semifinal in Mohali). But, they decided to opt for an extra fast bowler because there was heavy dew the previous day there,"" he concluded.",Ravichandran Ashwin says Gautam Gambhir is a tenacious and exceptional motivator. The spinner credits the former Indian opener with instilling confidence in him. Ashwin's rise to prominence in the Indian Premier League can be traced to the 2008 Challenger Trophy.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111174316,imgsize-60394,width-400,resizemode-4/111174316.jpg"

Many believe he is the frontrunner to take over from current head coach Rahul Dravid , whose tenure is set to conclude after the ongoing T20 World Cup .Despite his recent success as a team mentor, playing a key role in KKR's third IPL title win, Gambhir refused to comment on his prospects.""I don't see that far ahead. You are grilling me, asking me all tough questions,"" Gambhir, as quoted by PTI, said.""It is difficult to answer right now. All I can say is that I'm happy being here, just finished a brilliant journey (and) let's enjoy that. I'm in a very happy space right now,"" Gambhir said at a 'Rise To Leadership' seminar.Gambhir emphasized that prioritizing the team over individual players forms the foundation of his approach to coaching.""If you have the intent of keeping your team ahead of any individual, things will fall in place. If not today, tomorrow, if not tomorrow, someday it will fall in place,"" he said.""But if you start thinking on that, or if you know that you need to help one or two individuals perform, then your team will only suffer.""""My job is not to make individuals perform. My job, as a mentor, is to make KKR win,"" said Gambhir who was praised all over for his role in KKR's winning run this year.""For me, the guru mantra is team first philosophy. I think team-first ideology, team-first philosophy is the most important ideology in any team sport,"" he added.Gambhir said KKR's near-flawless run in the tournament can be credited to the team's cohesive and leadership-driven environment.""Yes I was the leader but all of us in the dressing room made the change. it was about making Kolkata proud. It was morale responsibility for me to give something back to Kolkata,"" he said.The ex-cricket player, who had the opportunity to lead the Indian team in several matches, emphasized that his philosophy revolves around giving equal treatment to all players within the team.""In a team sport, it's the team that matters the most. Individuals do play a role, individuals do contribute,"" he said.""But I think if 11 people are treated equally, if 11 people have equal respect, if everyone is treated equally, given the same respect, same responsibility, same honour, you will achieve an unbelievable amount of success.""You cannot have discrimination in a set up or in an organisation,"" he added.He expressed no regrets about his relatively short tenure as the captain of the Indian cricket team. Despite the brevity of his leadership role, he remained content with his contributions to the team during his time at the helm.""I have always thought about performing for the fans, and that has been my thought since the last year of my training career. In the middle, I got this honour of captaining India for six games. I tried doing it to the best of my ability,"" he said.""Otherwise, I have no regrets whatsoever because my job was not to captain the series. My job was to make my country win, and whichever team I play for, make that team win,"" he added.Gambhir does have one regret though.""I wish I had finished that game,"" he said referring to the 2011 World Cup final in which then skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni scored the winning runs.""It was my job to finish the game, rather than leaving someone to finish the game. If I had to turn back the clock, I would go back there and score the last run, irrespective of how many runs I scored,"" added the left-hander, who scored 97 runs in that epic clash against Sri Lanka at the Wankhede Stadium.",Gautam Gambhir refused to comment on his potential appointment as the next head coach of the Indian cricket team.

Poland managed to equalize through Krzysztof Piatek, who skillfully found the net after a rebound.However, Austria regained control in the second half with goals from Christoph Baumgartner and Marko Arnautovic , the latter converting a penalty, securing the win for Austria.This match was of particular interest given the geographical proximity of Austria and Poland to the host nation, Germany, contributing to a sold-out Olympiastadion and a vibrant atmosphere.Despite Poland's efforts and the introduction of Lewandowski in the second half, Austria's performance under the guidance of coachRalf Rangnick was too strong, with Baumgartner praising Rangnick for his motivational support.Elsewhere, in Group E, Ukraine secured a 2-1 victory over Slovakia, moving them into second place ahead of their next match.

Coach Roberto Martinez has confirmed Ronaldo's participation in the upcoming match, emphasizing his enduring value to the team.Martinez highlighted Ronaldo's experience, tactical awareness, goal-scoring prowess, and ability to create space as key assets.""I think what's important is to understand what a player brings. For us, Cristiano brings the experience, brings the know-how, brings the goal-scoring opportunities, the movement in the box, the opportunity to open up space If you want to analyse the stats in terms of the physical side, well you need to look at what he's done in the last 12 months,"" Martinez said, as quoted by AFP.""Cristiano is in the national team of Portugal because he deserves to be, and all the physical stats just back that he can play every four days,"" the coach added.Ronaldo's recent form supports Martinez's assessment. He has an impressive scoring record for both club and country, netting 44 goals in 45 appearances for Al Nassr and seven goals in seven international matches leading up to the Euros.However, Ronaldo's performance in Portugal's opening 2-1 victory against the Czech Republic, where he failed to score despite playing the full match, raises questions about his effectiveness within the team's current tactical framework. While his overall contribution might be valuable, his ability to convert chances and be the decisive factor in crucial games requires further scrutiny.Looking at Portugal's qualification prospects, they currently trail group leaders Turkey on goal difference.
