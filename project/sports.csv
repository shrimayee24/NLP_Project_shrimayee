Taylor Swift Has “Distanced” Herself From Blake Lively Because Of This Reason, Fans Say



Blake Lively Was Not Spotted With Taylor Swift At Super Bowl 2025



Taylor Swift, the billionaire pop star, has been in the news since she got booed at the Super Bowl last weekend when Travis Kelce’s team, the Kansas City Chiefs lost the trophy to the Philadelphia Eagles. Away from the Super Bowl drama, the pop star has also found herself involved in the legal drama between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni. But now, the reason why Taylor Swift has “distanced” herself from Blake Lively is pretty clear, according to fans.Taylor Swift has remained pretty silent about the whole controversial situation and is yet to make an official announcement about it. It seems like fans have found the reason behind it.A fan took to X and wrote, “The fact that Taylor Swift, huge advocate of the womens movement, didnt support bestie Blake Lively speaks volumes. If anyone would support, know and have proof that Blake was harrassed it would be Taylor Swift. Talks, calls, texts...Yet Taylor didn't support it. Hmmm”Another fan wrote, “If my bestfriend who made me godmother to her children was in a legal battle over sexual harassment & retaliation, I would be standing ten toes down with her. I would not abandon her. The fact that Taylor Swift distanced herself from Blake Lively is damning enough.”While it is not confirmed why Taylor Swift has not been spotted recently with her best friend, Blake Lively, fans are pretty convinced that this is the reason behind it.For the unversed, Blake Lively had accused Justin Baldoni of harassment and Justin filed a counter lawsuit against Blake Lively and her husband Ryan Reynolds accusing them of defamation and trying to take over control of their blockbuster movie, It Ends With Us. Taylor Swift was named by Justin Baldoni in the lawsuit as he felt Blake Lively tried to “use” Taylor Swift’s power and influence to gain control of the movie.Many fans also expected to see Taylor Swift and Blake Lively at the Super Bowl held last weekend but Blake was nowhere to be found at the stadium. This was in complete contrast to the 2024 Super Bowl when Blake Lively was spotted cheering on Travis Kelce as she stood next to Taylor Swift. The two were also spotted hugging each other when the Kansas City Chiefs won the trophy last year.A few days ago, a source revealed to Page Six that “Taylor really wishes Blake hadn’t dragged her into this whole situation.” This might be true considering how Taylor Swift has avoided being spotted with Blake Lively.With the Chiefs losing the Super Bowl, both Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift have been trolled but have remained silent.Also Read: Hailee Steinfeld reacts as Josh Allen gets asked out on a date during their appearance at NFL Honors","Taylor Swift has been in the news since she got booed at the Super Bowl last weekend when Travis Kelce’s team, the Kansas City Chiefs lost the trophy to the Philadelphia Eagles.

Evander Kane Was Accused Of Gambling And Domestic Violence By His Ex Wife Anna Kane



Edmonton Oilers ’ Evander Kane has been a pretty popular player in the National Hockey League but his life and career have been a victim of controversies. While Evander Kane is officially engaged to Mara Teigen currently, he was previously married to Anna Kane who has accused him of “mistreatment” and betting on NHL matches. Anna Kane also later accused him of domestic violence and neglect.In 2021, Evander Kane was investigated by the NHL after his ex wife, Anna Kane, released a statement on Instagram revealing the star player regularly engages in betting on his own games and was “addicted” to gambling. She also spoke about how she is “struggling” with their daughter while Evander Kane was “out on dinner and partying every night”.Evander Kane’s ex wife, Anna Kane’s statement on Instagram read as, “You have enough money to party and stay in hotels in Europe, go to dinners every night, but I can’t buy my daughter formula and [you] force me to sell my wedding ring to have any money to survive, as you party every day, every night, never calling your daughter and never asking, not even one time, how I’m doing by myself.”Two months later Evander Kane’s ex wife, Anna Kane, filed a case of domestic violence and sexual assault against the star player.When Anna Kane had accused Evander Kane of gambling and financially and emotionally neglecting his family, the star player released a statement where he denied all such accusations.

Shannon Sharpe advises Travis Kelce about his future

Chiefs give Travis Kelce DEADLINE to decide NFL future | Nightcap

After the Eagles' 40-22 victory against the Chiefs, Philadelphia experienced a tragic event where a man shot two women. Fortunately, both were stable and the suspect was arrested. Meanwhile, the Chiefs faced doubts for the next season due to their poor performance in the Super Bowl, particularly for their future quarterback, Travis Kelce. Kelce, at 35, has had his worst season in yards and touchdowns since his rookie year.Travis Kelce, the longest-tenured player on the Chiefs roster, has been a cornerstone since being drafted 63rd overall in 2013. He has appeared in 175 games and is considered one of the greatest tight ends in NFL history. However, his age is starting to catch up, and this season he appeared slower and lacked his usual explosiveness. With one year left on his contract, the Chiefs must decide if keeping him is worth the financial investment.NFL Hall of Famer Shannon Sharpe advises Kelce to take control of his future and not let the organization dictate his next move, referencing legendary players like Tom Brady, Peyton Manning, and Jerry Rice who changed teams late in their careers.""Tom Brady won six Super Bowls and ended up in Tampa. Peyton Manning had four MVPs, two Super Bowl appearances, one Super Bowl MVP and finished in Denver. Jerry Rice...I don't have to go anymore,"" Sharpe said on his podcast with Ochocinco. ""Understand the business and how it works. Do what is in your best interest.”Shannon Sharpe's comparisons are valid, but Kelce's situation is unique. Unlike Brady and Manning, Kelce's last game was a Super Bowl loss, making it difficult for him to process his last game in a successful career. He wants to return to the most important game, making it difficult for him to process.Travis Kelce, despite declining production, holds the NFL record for most receptions and playoff receiving touchdowns by a receiver. He currently ranks 14th on the all-time receptions list with 1,004 career catches. If he returns for one more season, he has a good chance of joining Marvin Harrison and Larry Fitzgerald as the only players in this elite group to spend their entire careers with one team.Also Read: “An upward trajectory”: Birmingham fans express their opinions on minority owner of Birmingham City club Tom Brady With free agency approaching on March 12, Kelce must now evaluate his options and seek advice from his closest friends, including Taylor Swift. Chiefs head coach Andy Reid believes Kelce has the potential to be a great coach, but it seems more likely that he will pursue entertainment opportunities. With past hosting gigs and an upcoming role in Happy Gilmore 2, Kelce's post-NFL future could be as high-profile as his playing career.","NFL Hall of Famer Shannon Sharpe advises Travis Kelce to take control of his future and not let the organization dictate his next move.

What’s the reason behind South African cricket's renaissance? SA20’s Graeme Smith answers

'Everyone played a part': Captain Rashid Khan as MI Cape Town clinch maiden SA20 title

SA20 showcasing perfect balance between bat and ball: Vernon Philander

NEW DELHI: Dinesh Karthik came in as Jos Buttler's replacement in the Paarl Royals squad ahead of the third season of the SA20 - South Africa's premier T20 competition. On January 11, he made his debut against two-time defending champions Sunrisers Eastern Cape in a milestone moment. 'DK', as he is commonly and popularly known, became the first Indian to feature in the SA20.Unlike the female players, Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) has a strict rule on Indian players plying their trade in foreign T20 leagues. In order to retain exclusivity for the Indian Premier League (IPL), male players cannot play in T20 leagues abroad. The exception, however, is made when the player announces retirement from international cricket and the IPL.Karthik fit that bill after playing his last for Royal Challengers Bengaluru in IPL 2024. After 257 IPL matches in which he scored 4842 runs, DK decided to say goodbye for good. He decided to make a U-turn because of the competition and the lure of playing for the Royals.Now with the season wrapped up, where Paarl Royals bowed out after Qualifier 2, Karthik admits BCCI's stiff policy is for the betterment of Indian cricket and its players with enough happening at state levels as well to aid youngsters.""I'm a big believer that the IPL should be the crown jewel for BCCI. And it is, at the moment, the crown jewel in world cricket. And for that to maintain its status quo as No. 1, I believe that Indian cricketers shouldn't be allowed unless they're retired,"" he said in a conversation organised by SA20.""Because they can take the call if they feel they're done with the IPL and then move on to play other leagues. I completely stand with the BCCI on that front. I agree you can always argue saying 'Can youngsters be given an opportunity?' But I think there is enough in India in terms of competition and ways of being financially secure. And if you're good enough, IPL is a great platform. They have domestic cricket and all the state franchise leagues as well.""So I think there's a lot of cricket that's played in India. And I think cricketers from India should be allowed to play once they retire. And I believe that is the right way to go. And I think SA20, or any other league for that matter, will be more than happy to work with and to have a couple of the players who have retired from BCCI and from playing for India,"" he added.Karthik played 11 matches in the season for Paarl Royals and scored 130 runs at an average of 21.67 and strike rate of 121.50 in a season that saw scarcity of runs under tough pitches. Enough that Royals set a record of bowling their entire 20 overs against Pretoria Capitals with spinners - an aspect that brought out a chuckle from DK who compared the conditions at Boland Park to Tamil Nadu.He might not have set the scoring charts ablaze but did have a jolly time in South Africa with family in tow - especially at the 10,000 capacity Boland Park.""IPL (and SA20) had one thing in common - the fact that there were full houses for all games that I played. So Paarl is well supported, but you have to understand the numbers are very different. South Africa had packed houses, almost all the games that we played, which was very encouraging,"" he said.""Standard of cricket is very good. Obviously, with IPL, the challenges are very different. The quality in terms of how it is played over two months is very, very different to SA20.""Paarl Royals (and eventual champions MI Cape Town) went unbeaten in the league stage with five wins in five played. While MICT went all the way, Royals stumbled against the Sunrisers Eastern Cape. Yet, it was a memorable debut season for Karthik who shared the dressing room with England's Joe Root.""Playing with Joe Root was one of the highlights, I believe, for me personally, playing this tournament. I've never interacted much with him. Always seen him - said a hello, but to rub shoulders with him, be with him in the same dressing room, what a terrific personality. He's a legend of the game. Easily will go down as one of the greatest batters to have ever played this sport.""But the attitude that he brings, it's just very warm, welcoming, helps the youngsters so much. And always wants to have fun and a laugh. And wants the team to have a great time. Like we had this pushups contest after a match. And it was all started by him. It's just the energy that he brings, the genuinity that he brings towards the sport. It was wonderful playing with him. It was one of the best experiences, actually, playing with such a legend who has no hang-ups about himself. Very relaxed, very humble. It was a lot of fun,"" stated Karthik who acknowledged he would be keen on being part of the SA20 again in the future.",Dinesh Karthik is the first Indian to feature in South Africa's premier T20 competition.

Ant-Man Sits This One Out: Why Anthony Edwards Missed the NBA All-Star Game?



Minnesota Timberwolves Schedule 2025 After the NBA All-Star Game



ALSO READ:

The NBA All-Star Game brought the league's brightest stars to San Francisco, but one notable absentee was Minnesota Timberwolves guard Anthony Edwards . The Timberwolves' scorer, known for his explosive play and entertaining antics, was unexpectedly held out of the game due to a nagging groin injury. Edwards, who was selected as a Western Conference reserve , had previously hinted at some All-Star game shenanigans, following his memorable left-handed shooting spree from last year.This year, however, it was injury that sidelined the young star.Edwards, who had been selected as a Western Conference reserve, was introduced alongside his fellow All-Stars, but ultimately decided to sit out the game due to a nagging groin injury. This comes just a year after his memorable – and controversial – ""left-handed only"" shooting performance in the previous All-Star Game.""My groin, my groin has been messed up for a minute,"" Edwards explained to reporters. ""Three or four days, I should be ok.""The injury has been a lingering issue for Edwards in recent weeks, forcing him to miss a couple of games for the Timberwolves. While he was initially listed as ""questionable"" for the All-Star Game, he ultimately decided that the risk of further aggravating the injury wasn't worth the reward.This absence undoubtedly dampened the excitement for many fans who were eager to witness Edwards' unique brand of basketball on the All-Star stage. However, the Timberwolves and their fans will be hoping for a swift recovery for their young star, as he looks to lead the team on a strong push towards the playoffs in the second half of the season.February 21 at 9:30 p.m. ET against Houston RocketsFebruary 23 at 9:30 p.m. ET against Oklahoma City ThunderFebruary 24 at 8:00 p.m. ET against Oklahoma City ThunderFebruary 27at 10:30 p.m. ET against Los Angeles LakersFebruary 28 at 9:30 p.m. ET against Utah JazzThe Minnesota Timberwolves' schedule following the All-Star break features a mix of challenging road games and divisional matchups, providing Edwards and the team with ample opportunities to solidify their playoff position.","Anthony Edwards missed the NBA All-Star Game due to a nagging groin injury.

Indian cricket team lands in Dubai for Champions Trophy | Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Gautam Gambhir all spotted | Exclusive visuals

Poll What Are You Looking Forward to for India in the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy? Strategic and Innovative Gameplay Outstanding Teamwork and Collaboration

India’s squad for ICC Champions Trophy, 2025:

Late in the afternoon on February 15, an unusual frenzy gripped the business class arrivals lounge of the Dubai International Airport. The word had travelled that the Indian cricket team was going to land shortly and plenty of fans had assembled to catch a glimpse of their favourite superstars. The area which generally sees passengers quietly make their way to the fleet of luxury vehicles waiting outside was buzzing with activity.Security officials were working overdrive when the flight carrying the Men in Blue landed on the runway. Few luggage trolleys were used to cordon off the area and the intensity picked up when the local police directed everyone to vacate the lounge area and head to the parking lot outside. There were loud cheers when head coach Gautam Gambhir led the entourage to the team bus. Everyone - from Virat Kohli to Hardik Pandya to Shreyas Iyer - acknowledged the fans while boarding the team bus.When the players took their respective seats, the waiting fans kept looking inside because captain Rohit Sharma was yet to exit the building. And when he did, there were loud cheers for the Hitman who walked briskly to the waiting bus and even summoned the security official for some instructions. Did he forget something again? Eh, not quite sure but you never know! The bus left the airport and KL Rahul, who made his way out at least 20 minutes after the team, took a separate car to the team hotel.Business as usual resumed after that and the usual calm was restored to the business class arrivals lounge. The ICC Champions Trophy 's first match in Dubai is still some days away and the buzz has naturally been missing in the city. And quite understandably so. Only India would be parked here because the rest of the teams will play their matches in Pakistan, the official hosts of the tournament. The teams allotted fixtures vs India will travel to Dubai and then head back as per the hybrid arrangement okayed by the International Cricket Council (ICC).The tournament gets underway on February 19 with India playing their opening match vs Bangladesh in Dubai on February 20. The large section of Bangladeshis residing here are excited to see their heroes in action and sound very optimistic on their chances too. The only question on their lips is ""when will the Bangladesh team land?"" and they certainly sound confident of taking a Jasprit Bumrah-less India down in their tournament opener.""I support Bangladesh and want them to win. It will be difficult but easier than before because Jasprit Bumrah , the dangerman, is not here. And we have good pacers. So it will not be an easy game for India as pacers do well in Dubai,"" said a cab driver who makes multiple trips to the airport in a day.""Pakistan is 50-50. They can do anything on their day but when it's not their day, they are a difficult team to even watch on TV (laughs),"" he added on the hosts' chances.Pakistan, the defending champions, will put their credentials to the test in the opener against New Zealand in Karachi.Rohit Sharma (Captain), Shubman Gill (Vice-captain), Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul (WK), Rishabh Pant (WK), Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav, Harshit Rana, Mohd.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Alex Ovechkin disses NHL for the absence of Russian players in 4 Nations Face-Off

Alex Ovechkin , a Washington Capitals star, provided some insightful remarks to Gary Bettman and the NHL regarding the Four Nations faceoff, which has been a success, featuring dramatic moments like the match between Toronto Maple Leafs Mitch Marner and William Nylander. The event has been the first best-on-best tournament in a long time.Alex Ovechkin is not participating in the 4 Nations Face-Off tournament, leaving Russians' status for the upcoming Olympics in doubt. Russia could have formed a dynamic roster with players like Ovechkin, Kucherov, Malkin, Kaprizov, and Panarin, and goalkeepers Shesterkin or Vasilevsky. Evgeni Malkin expressed interest in the 4 Nations Face-Off, which was relayed to Ovechkin, who was asked about his attention to the tournament by Match TV.Alex Ovechkin referenced this in his latest comments about the tournament, indicating that he simply does not care because his countrymen are not there. ""I won't be watching the Four Nations Tournament. What's the point of watching something where the Russian team isn't participating?”Alex Ovechkin, who would likely lead the Russian team in scoring, would not be watching the Four Nations faceoff on TV. Instead, he has taken advantage of his vacation in Miami, where he is currently on vacation. Despite this, he is still taking care of himself, posting about training with one of his former teammates.Alex Ovechkin is close to surpassing Wayne Gretzky with 879 career goals, just 15 behind the NHL's all-time leading goal scorer. Ovechkin's rapid scoring pace this season has helped close the gap. To surpass Gretzky, Ovechkin needs 16 goals in 27 games and a 0.593 goals-per-game pace, with a goal-per-game rate of 0.593.Also Read: Charlie McAvoy threw a textbook hit to Connor McDavid, sending the world's best hockey player down to the ice Hopefully, the next time we get a major best-on-best tournament where Russians and other Europeans can participate, while focusing on the NHL's success thus far, as it has not disappointed them thus far.","Alex Ovechkin is not participating in the 4 Nations Face-Off tournament, leaving Russians' status for the upcoming Olympics in doubt.

The debate on LeBron James Michael Jordan , the greatest of all time debate is far from settling as it comes up with new perspectives. While James still has, at least a few years on his sleeves and he has been on a streak of adding more records to his already stunning basketball resume, Jordan’s impact in the basketball narrative has always been on top alongside James. Now, in a recent interview, former Chicago Bulls star Kendall Gill shared that NBA executives already have theirpick in the debate.NBA has never openly shared its pick on the LeBron James vs. Michael Jordan GOAT debate. While it has been a safe play for the league to maintain the balance among fans, former NBA star Kendall Gill seemingly has the answer to the long-time debated question as he shared that he got it from NBA executives at the United Center. In a recent chat with the 2 Raw 4 TV podcast, the former NBA star gave the inside scoop on the matter.“I’m at the United Center all the time. And I did this specifically to get answers from executives of other teams. I go downstairs and ask each executive: ‘In their prime, who would you take in the draft—Michael Jordan or LeBron James?’ Just one executive chose LeBron over Jordan. That tells you everything,” Gill said.That tells you everything? Of course, most have been long-time devout fans of Jordan but James has also made his case strong. Additionally, it is also hard to compare the legends following their statistics.James is on top in regards to both their career points holding a stunning 41,641 points and continuing while Jordan posted 32,292 points in his legendary career. James has 21 All-Star selections to his credit while Jordan ended his career with 14. James has never won the Defensive Player of the Year award in his career. In the 1987–88 season, Jordan won the NBA Defensive Player of the Year award, becoming the first player to claim both the scoring title and DPOY in the same year. Jordan has 10 NBA scoring titles, which is the most in NBA history while James has claimed only one. Michael Jordan won the MVP award five times and James is a four-time NBA MVP.Also Read: “Go f**k it, go”: LeBron James explains what his wife Savannah James endured to influence his basketball legacy The stats continue and both the legends have made their marks in the league in different ways.

The ‘Young and Drunk’ Version Of Tom Brady Which Vince Wilfork Saw At The Derby

For most NFL fans, Tom Brady ’s let-his-hair-down moment and the ensuing drunken trophy toss at the Buccaneers’ Super Bowl parade was a rare glimpse of him letting loose. But his teammates have often talked about how Brady loves partying. Former Patriots DT Vince Wilfork has recently revealed that Brady’s 2021 trophy toss wasn’t the only time the team got a look at Brady’s fun side.In the latest episode of Green Light with Chris Long, Wilfork revealed that he saw an adventurous side of Tom Brady at the 2014 Kentucky Derby . Wilfork said that during his and Brady’s attendance at the Derby, the latter got quite drunk and lost some of his inhibition.“Yes, I did see him drunk, but it was early on in my career. Tom was always private, like Tom only used to hang around certain people and stuff, but I think I’ve seen him drunk because we had gone to Derby. There I got a chance to see the different side of him,” Wilfork recalled.Tom Brady is a big Kentucky Derby fan and visited Churchill Downs where his Pork Pie hat would make headlines the next day. Wilfork also pointed out how Brady was different than most quarterbacks especially when it comes to dealing with people.Also Read: THROWBACK: When the FBI Helped Find $500K Worth Super Bowl Jersey of NFL Legend Tom Brady “Tom never acted like one of those bougie quarterbacks. He is a great team player,” Wilfork broke down. “I would see rookies coming in and they would have a jersey and Tom would sit there and sign. He would tell nobody no, he never cared who you are, he doesn’t care how long you’ve been in the league—he would sit and sign for you.”Wilfork also called the seven-time Super Bowl winner one of the best teammates he’s ever had the chance to play with. Many kudos go to him because you know QBs have a stigmatism to where they are known to be a-holes. But Tom probably is one of the greatest teammates I’ve had.”","Former Patriots DT Vince Wilfork revealed that he saw Tom Brady drunk at the 2014 Kentucky Derby.
