NEW DELHI: Prashant Kishor 's Jan Suraaj Party lost its deposit in 236 of the 238 seats that it contested but data suggests it may have played spoiler in quite a few seats. In 35 constituencies, the party's votes were higher than the winning margin. NDA won 19 of these seats while 14 went to Mahagathbandhan. AIMIM and BSP each won one of these seats.Of course, the fact that Jan Suraaj got more votes than the margin in a seat does not necessarily mean it made the difference to the outcome since there is no way of knowing where those votes would otherwise have gone.The party came third in 115 seats and in one, Marhaura, it finished second.Of the 35 seats, within NDA, JDU, Kishor's former party, won 10 of these seats while BJP won five. The tally was three for LJP-RV and one for RLM.In the MGB camp, RJD was the winner in nine of these seats while Congress won two. One seat each went to CPM, CPIML-L and IIP.Despite his amplified presence on the social media, many critics of the party had claimed that Prashant Kishor would at best be a spoiler.Some felt his upper caste identity meant he would cut into BJP's vote while others argued he would divide the anti-incumbency youth votes since he was talking about issues like migration from the state.","Jan Suraaj Party lost its deposit in 236 of the 238 seats that it contested.

Mahagathbandhan's

NEW DELHI: Hours after announcing publicly that she had severed ties with her family, Lalu Prasad Yadav ’s daughter, Rohini Acharya, claimed she was ""thrown out"" by her brother, Tejashwi Yadav , and his close aides, Sanjay Yadav and Rameez. Speaking on the Rashtriya Janata Dal 's (RJD) debacle in the Bihar assembly polls, Rohini said she was ""disgraced, abused, and even hit"" when she questioned Sanjay Yadav and Rameez.""I have no family.

The whole nation is asking why the party failed like this.

Born in Haryana in 1984, Sanjay Yadav joined the RJD in 2012 and was sent to the Rajya Sabha by the party in 2024.Rameez, meanwhile, is reportedly an old friend of Tejashwi Yadav and comes from a political family in the neighbouring Uttar Pradesh.Earlier, taking all the blame, Rohini hit out at Sanjay Yadav for her decision and alleged that it was Sanjay Yadav and Rameez who ""asked"" her to do so.""I’m quitting politics and I’m disowning my family … This is what Sanjay Yadav and Rameez had asked me to do …nd I’m taking all the blame’s,"" she wrote on X.On Rohini's decision, BJP's Bihar chief Dilip Jaiswal said: ""Rohini Acharya has donated her kidney to save Lalu Yadav.

Manifesto as mandate

Age, health narratives and Bihar’s same-old leadership

Youth involvement: Maithili, Chirag a beginning – needs more

Eyes on Bengal

Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam: The big election year

NEW DELHI: The National Democratic Alliance ( NDA ) registered a decisive victory in the 2025 Bihar Assembly elections. The alliance won 202 seats in the 243-member assembly, with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) emerging as the single largest party with 89 seats, closely followed by the Janata Dal (United) (JDU) at 85 seats. The Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) also performed strongly, winning 19 of the 29 seats it contested.The NDA powered through the Bihar elections , securing a decisive win despite opposition’s attempts to raise issues such as alleged “voter chori” by the Centre and the Election Commission, and campaigning around the Special Intensive Revision drive and Voter Adhikar Yatra. However, the NDA’s strong organisational machinery, coupled with its development-focused messaging, neutralised these allegations on the ground, leaving Mahagathbandhan struggling.After such a massive victory, the next obvious question is - what next for NDA?The NDA’s landslide victory sets the stage for a governance cycle anchored in its 69-page manifesto — a roadmap promising one crore employment opportunities, Mega Skill Centres and major infrastructure upgrades including expressways, new rail lines, and international airports in multiple cities.With commitments ranging from 10 new industrial parks, 100 MSME hubs, semiconductor and chipset parks, to transformative welfare pledges such as one crore, expanded Kisan Samman Nidhi, free education for poor children, and 50 lakh new homes, NDA now carries a development agenda, which has to build upon Nitish’s decade-long ruling in the state.The election outcome brought a sharp generational contrast to the forefront. Nitish Kumar , 74, secured a renewed mandate even as the opposition showcased one of its youngest leadership line-ups in years. Despite attacks centred on his age, physical health and even insinuations about his “ill health,” voters ultimately sided with experience over experimentation.Nitish’s consolidated support among Kurmis, EBCs, Mahadalits, and women, boosted by central strength, effectively turned age into an advantage. His reputation as a steady, predictable administrator outweighed concerns over longevity or past political allegiance shifts.Thus, the upcoming term will hinge on the NDA capitalizing on Nitish’s stature as a veteran leader, coupled with the anti-incumbency narrative, while countering renewed questions about his age, particularly as this tenure will span till the time he’s 79.This becomes more significant, looking back on political rivals who had leaned heavily on this line of attack. Jan Suraaj’s Prashant Kishor repeatedly claimed Nitish was “ill” and “his mind not working”. RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav had also argued that Nitsh was no longer in full command and speculated around the JDU leader’s health.In his victory speech, PM Modi gave credit to ""positive MY formula, and that is Mahila and youth"". Yet, taking a look at the elected MLAs’, overall youth representation is at a low. While NDA did use some new, young faces, the overall Assembly age actually is older. The average of NDA MLA-elects is 53, as opposed to 2020’s 52, suggesting that the overall demographic has remained unchanged more or less in the bigger picture.The standout is 25-year-old Maithili Thakur, whose decisive victory in Alinagar introduces a fresh cultural and youth-centric face into the BJP’s Bihar landscape. Her entry — as one of the youngest MLAs — symbolises youth outreach into its leadership pipeline.Chirag Paswan’s LJP (Ram Vilas), with 19 seats, adds another layer to this generational shift. Positioning himself as a “Yuva Bihari” while drawing on the legacy of his father, Ram Vilas Paswan, Chirag has emerged as a central youth figure within the broader NDA framework.Together, these leaders signal NDA’s start to blend legacy governance with new-age political capital, which needs to consider expansion on this formula.In his victory speech, PM Modi moved beyond Bihar, positioning the win as a launchpad for the 2026 West Bengal Assembly elections. PM Modi said that “just as the Ganga flows from Bihar to West Bengal, this victory signals the BJP’s win in West Bengal as well.” West Bengal, which shares a border with Bihar, will hold its next assembly elections in April–May 2026, where Mamata Banerjee will seek a fourth consecutive term as chief minister.The themes that defined the Bihar campaign — welfare delivery, women’s empowerment, organisational cohesion — are expected to form the strategic backbone of the BJP’s Bengal playbook in a high-stakes battleground.The Bihar mandate feeds into the wider national playbook ahead of key elections in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Assam. The NDA might aim to replicate Bihar’s formula — welfare delivery, youth mobilisation, cultural messaging, and alliance cohesion — while adapting it to regional contexts.In Tamil Nadu, the battle will hinge on the anti-SIR narrative, as evident by TVK chief Vijay warning that the verification drive has left many unsure whether their names will remain on the rolls. “If I say that even at this very moment, not everyone in Tamil Nadu has the right to vote, would you believe it? Don’t think I’m trying to scare you… this is the truth,” he said, blaming the SIR.Kerala presents a similar SIR challenge, with the addition that the BJP has to break into a left-dominated ground.Meanwhile, in Assam, the contest centres on anti-incumbency. Himanta Biswa Sarma, who left Congress in 2015 and became chief minister in 2021, now faces his popularity test in 2026 as he seeks to secure a third consecutive victory for the BJP.","The National Democratic Alliance ( NDA ) registered a decisive victory in the 2025 Bihar Assembly elections.

NDA Sweeps Bihar, Nitish Kumar Prepares for 10th CM Oath; A Look Back at ‘Sushasan Babu’s’ Journey





Behind-the scenes build-up





2025: Outgrowing the dependency narrative





Will Nitish continue as CM?





Nitish: The constant switch





The psychologist shift





From outsider to power centre





NEW DELHI: Amit Shah's pre-poll boast - ""We will win more than 160 seats... It can be 180 also"" - sounded-like a typical campaign bravado, the verdict proved otherwise. The NDA did not just meet expectations. It blew past them, finishing at 202 seats. With this sweeping mandate, one storyline stood above all: the BJP emerged as the single largest party in Bihar, securing 89 seats - its highest tally ever in the state assembly.This rise has taken decades to shape. For years, Bihar was defined by the dominance of socialist and Mandal-era forces led by leaders like Lalu Prasad Yadav and later Nitish Kumar. The BJP, despite expanding nationally, had little organic ground in the state. It lacked historical roots, caste-led influence and a natural voter identity in a state where politics was built more on community loyalties than ideology.So the party chose patience.The BJP stayed behind the scenes and allowed Nitish Kumar -- the face of ""sushasan babu"" -- to remain the mascot of reform and governance. While Nitish held the chair and the credit, the BJP quietly built its booth networks, expanded OBC outreach, infiltrated and weakened RJD's voter base, and steadily infused ideological presence into a state long driven by personality-centric politics revolving around Lalu and Nitish.BJP's social engineering strategy in Bihar, largely driven under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi , appears to have paid off -- including in the Muslim-dominated Seemanchal region, where voters did not hesitate to support the BJP-NDA alliance.The Muslim electorate, traditionally seen as outside BJP's fold and often viewed as a disadvantage for the saffron party, showed a noticeable shift this time.The real inflection came in 2020, when the BJP, for the first time, outscored its senior ally JD(U), winning 74 seats compared to JD(U)'s 43. Yet it still supported Nitish as chief minister, signalling endurance over instant glory.This election made the transformation official. During seat negotiations, the BJP secured 101 seats, the same as JD(U), positioning itself as an equal partner and ending the long-held narrative of Nitish-led JD(U) as the ""big brother."" The results confirmed what the groundwork had hinted at: the BJP had outgrown its dependency narrative.However, Nitish Kumar also made an impressive comeback -- rising from 43 seats in the previous election to 85 this time, just behind the BJP. Yet his indispensability may not look the same anymore. With its partners, the NDA nearly touches majority on its own: the BJP's 89 seats, LJP (RV)'s 19, HAM's 5 and RLM's 4 total 117 seats, only a few short of the required majority. The remaining gap could potentially be bridged through talks with nine Independent candidates who are not aligned with either camp.A big question now emerges over who will be projected as the chief ministerial face for the BJP, especially when it comes to placing complete trust in Nitish Kumar - a leader who has built an unmatched reputation for switching sides, often described as practising ""weatherproof politics.""Over the past decade, he has moved between alliances with a precision almost unique in Indian politics. He walked out of the BJP in 2013 just as Narendra Modi was rising on the national stage, partnered with the RJD to form a grand alliance, switched back to the BJP, returned to the RJD camp, and then again shifted to the NDA. The pace and timing of these shifts have kept observers guessing for years.It was Nitish who first worked toward bringing opposition parties together under what eventually became the INDIA bloc. But before the idea could fully mature, he stepped away and returned to the NDA. This is why a familiar phrase keeps resurfacing in Bihar's political chatter: ""Nitish sabke hain."" Today, once again, he stands with the NDA to take on the very bloc he helped shape.Despite these repeated shifts, the BJP has usually not pressed hard on trust issues with JD(U), largely because Nitish’s ""sushasan babu"" image has been politically valuable in Bihar. Even after outscoring JD(U) in 2020, the BJP continued to back Nitish as chief minister. But now, with greater strength and momentum, a new question arises: will the BJP once again settle for a secondary role, or assert itself and claim the lead?When asked who would be chief minister, Amit Shah kept the answer open: ""Who am I to decide it? NDA partners will decide who will be the next Bihar CM."" Although the NDA publicly supports Nitish Kumar, the BJP has avoided formally projecting him as its chief ministerial face, keeping room for negotiation.Nitish Kumar's political shifts -- from BJP to RJD and back, then back again -- may have generated headlines, but beneath those dramatic alliance flips, the BJP was slowly becoming indispensable to Bihar’s power structure. Nitish remained the face, but BJP became the framework.The turning point is not just numerical; it is psychological. For decades, Bihar politics revolved around the Lalu-Nitish axis. Today, it revolves around the BJP’s bargaining weight. The Mahagathbandhan’s collapse, especially RJD’s reduction to 25 seats and Congress winning only 6 out of 61 it contested, underlined that shift.BJP veteran Lal Krishna Advani, who was arrested in Samastipur during his iconic Ram Mandir ""Rath Yatra"" on the orders of then-chief minister Lalu Prasad Yadav -- a moment can be viewed as Bihar unwelcoming of the BJP. Now, the saffron party stands in sharp contrast to the party's present position, where it holds the strongest hand inside the state's ruling coalition. This transformation marks one of the most significant slow-burn political realignments in recent political history.In the end, Bihar 2025 isn't just about who will be chief minister. It’s about who now shapes the state’s political centre of gravity. And for the first time in three decades, that person may no longer be Nitish Kumar -- but the BJP itself.","The BJP emerged as the single largest party in Bihar, securing 89 seats - its highest tally ever in the state assembly. Nitish Kumar also made an impressive comeback -- rising from 43 seats in the previous election to 85 this time, just behind the BJP. With its partners, the NDA nearly touches majority on its own.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125349669,imgsize-1222098,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-95.jpg"

A paradox the verdict did not resolve

Lalu absent, yet unavoidable

NEW DELHI: This election season in Bihar, Lalu Prasad Yadav did not appear at rallies, did not deliver a single speech, and did not record even a short video for supporters. His party, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), delivered one of its weakest performances in decades, winning only about two dozen seats. And yet the results, the campaign rhetoric, and even voter anxieties seemed to orbit around one man who never entered the arena.Lalu's absence this year may have defined the election as much as his presence once did.The NDA’s sweeping victory, 202 seats between the BJP, JD(U) and allies, was built on a familiar message architecture that repeatedly invoked the spectre of jungle raj. As Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in his victory speech on Friday, Bihar had rejected ""jungle raj"" and ""katta sarkaar,"" choosing development and stability instead.For decades, the term carried clear caste-coded undertones. Today, its meaning has broadened. Uday Chandra , writer and field-based researcher of politics and society, notes that ""jungle raj functions today less as a narrow upper-caste smear than as a broad anxiety about disorder that cuts across caste lines."" That evolution shaped how women, Extremely Backward Classes, Mahadalits and non-Yadav OBCs understood the stakes of their vote.These groups, Chandra says, ""prioritise predictability, personal safety and routine welfare over expressive grievance politics."" Any party that appeared vulnerable to instability began the campaign with a trust deficit. RJD entered the fray knowing it had to battle not only the NDA, but also a historical memory that no longer targeted only upper castes but resonated across the electorate.The party's messaging, as a result, was pushed into a defensive crouch. ""It forces RJD to defend its reputation continuously rather than focusing solely on policy promises,"" Chandra explains. ""Much of its messaging becomes defensive, explaining, denying, contextualising, which is poor terrain when the median voter wants reassurance, not argument.""The electoral map reflected this tension. Though the RJD won only 25 seats, it recorded the highest vote share, 23%, proving its strongholds of Yadav-Muslim loyalty remain intact. But its reach in competitive seats shrank further. As Chandra puts it, ""RJD’s core still turns out strongly but in marginal constituencies the fear-of-disorder payoff favours the side that can credibly promise stability.""""Lalu remains the master symbol of Yadav pride and political memory,"" Chandra says. Symbolism, however, is not the same as vote transfer.Lalu's failure to ensure that the fruits of post-Mandal empowerment were widely dispersed, and not overwhelmingly cornered by Yadavs, also helped the NDA prevent Tejashwi from pulling non-Yadav OBCs and even a section of upper castes toward his promise of development and a break from Lalu-era politics.Internal fragmentation aggravated these shifts. Chandra notes that the Yadav vote ""can be split when local notables run their own machines or when personal rivalries are visible."" In several constituencies, Tej Pratap Yadav 's parallel activity and the presence of strong independents splintered the Yadav vote. These splits did not hurt the RJD in strongholds — but proved lethal in front-line marginals.For many RJD supporters, Tejashwi is the softer, modern face meant to reassure voters uneasy about a return to chaos. For critics, he remains Lalu’s political heir and therefore the inheritor of jungle raj. He ends up fighting two battles simultaneously: his father's past and his coalition’s present. And in 2025, he lost both.Lalu’s relevance is not sustained by nostalgia alone. The infrastructure he built still shapes Bihar’s politics. Chandra points to three drivers of his enduring centrality: ""historical anchoring, identity brokerage, and a relational patronage network.""His tenure in the 1990s reshaped Bihar’s caste politics in ways that even his opponents acknowledge. His presence still influences alliances, candidate selection and the strategies of regional players. And the organisational networks he built, cadres, kinship links, local intermediaries, continue to be activated during elections.This duality explains why Lalu remained the focal point despite the RJD’s weak performance. Opponents framed their campaign around his record; allies used his legacy as political glue. As Chandra observes, ""Opponents weaponise his record to raise risk perceptions among swing voters; allies treat him as an indispensable ledger item in coalition arithmetic.""The NDA ran as much against Lalu as against Tejashwi. The Mahagathbandhan campaigned with Lalu’s symbolism while trying to present a forward-looking message. Voters judged both through the prism of his legacy.The verdict reveals the limits of symbolic politics. The NDA tapped into a broad desire for stability and continuity. Nitish Kumar’s credentials as Sushasan Babu, combined with Modi’s welfare-driven appeal, proved more persuasive than the RJD’s defensive messaging.The RJD struggled to convincingly present itself as a clean break from the 1990s. Tejashwi’s blended pitch, social justice plus governance, was often overshadowed by ambiguity. Was he an inheritor or a reformer? Voters were unsure.The 2025 election may be one of the harshest electoral blows to the RJD, but it also reaffirms something deeper: Lalu Yadav continues to frame the boundaries of how politics is imagined, narrated and contested in Bihar. Every debate about governance, justice, development or security remains tethered to reactions to his legacy.His absence became a presence.This year, Lalu did not campaign, did not speak, did not even wave from a balcony. Yet no NDA rally avoided attacking his past; no MGB rally could afford to ignore his symbolism. He was not on the ballot but still shaped the ballot box.The verdict has sidelined his party, but it has not erased him. Lalu Prasad Yadav remains the axis around which Bihar’s political conversation still turns.","Lalu Prasad Yadav did not appear at rallies, did not deliver a single speech, and did not record even a short video for supporters.

NEW DELHI: Lalu Prasad Yadav's daughter Rohini Acharya said on Saturday that she has decided to quit politics, declaring that she was disowning her family a day after the Rashtriya Janata Dal-led Mahagathbandhan’s poll debacle in Bihar.Taking all the blame, Rohini hit out at Sanjay Yadav, who is a close confidant of Tejashwi Yadav, for her decision and alleged that it was Sanjay Yadav and Rameez who ""asked"" her to do so.""I’m quitting politics and I’m disowning my family … This is what Sanjay Yadav and Rameez had asked me to do …nd I’m taking all the blame’s,"" she wrote on X.On Rohini's decision, BJP's Bihar chief Dilip Jaiswal said: ""Rohini Acharya has donated her kidney to save Lalu Yadav.

PATNA: An electoral rout and a daughter's fury spilling into public view. Rohini Acharya - the second of RJD chief Lalu Prasad's nine children and the donor of the kidney that saved him - announced Saturday she was quitting politics and ""disowning"" her family, igniting a storm that cut across party lines and private loyalties a day after the party's crushing defeat in Bihar.“I don’t have any family, you should go and ask Tejashwi, Sanjay and Rameez. They are the ones who have expelled me from the family because they don’t want to take responsibility,” she told reporters.“The whole world is saying that we will ask questions to whoever becomes Chanakya. The party workers are asking Chanakya why the RJD has reached this state. If Sanjay, Rameez’s name is taken, you will be thrown out of the house and defamed. You will also be hit with slippers,” she added.Her remarks echoed the frustration she had earlier expressed in a social media post announcing that she was quitting politics and “disowning” her family. While she did not explain the full circumstances behind this step, her comments once again pointed towards resentment over the influence wielded by two of Tejashwi Prasad Yadav’s key advisers – Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Yadav, who is from Haryana, and Rameez, who hails from Uttar Pradesh.Her post suggested she believed they had contributed to the party’s disastrous showing in the assembly polls, where the RJD collapsed to 25 seats – 50 fewer than in 2020, when it had been close to forming the govt.“I am quitting politics and disowning my family… This is what Sanjay Yadav and Rameez asked me to do… and I’m taking all the blame,” she wrote, sparking heated debate across political circles. Her post did not clarify what exactly the two advisers had said, and they were not available for comment.JD(U) spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said the episode reflected the pain of a daughter who once gave a part of herself to save her father. “Why is Laluji silent over such an important issue? He should not act like Dhritrashtra,” he said.Rohini had gained prominence last year when she contested the Saran Lok Sabha seat, losing to BJP leader Rajiv Pratap Rudy by 13,661 votes. Long before that, her kidney donation to Lalu during a transplant in Singapore had become a defining symbol of her loyalty, invoked repeatedly whenever tensions surfaced within the family.Her displeasure with Sanjay Yadav is not new. In Sept, she indirectly criticised him for occupying the front seat of Tejashwi’s specially designed rath during the Bihar Adhikar Yatra in Tejashwi’s absence – a seat regarded within the family as a symbol of authority. Without naming him directly, she had shared a post stating, “The front seat is always reserved for the top leaders, and no one should sit there in their absence. However, if ‘someone’ considers themselves above the top leadership, that’s a different matter.”Earlier, she had also blamed Sanjay for her brother Tej Pratap’s estrangement from both the family and the party. Tej, whom Lalu distanced himself from after he publicly revealed his relationship with a woman, eventually floated his own party and contested from Mahua, where he was defeated emphatically.Despite her escalating criticism, Rohini has consistently asserted that her actions stem from duty, not political ambition. “I have fulfilled my duty and dharma as a daughter and sister and will continue to do so. I have no desire for any position, nor do I have any political ambitions. My self-respect is paramount for me,” she said in an earlier post.","Rohini Acharya is the second of RJD chief Lalu Prasad's nine children and the donor of the kidney that saved him. She announced Saturday she was quitting politics and ""disowning"" her family. Her comments once again pointed towards resentment over the influence wielded by two of Tejashwi Yadav's key advisers.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125358046,imgsize-30224,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

The road ahead: Continuity with caution

NEW DELHI: Bihar ’s 2025 verdict was at once predictable and surprising. Predictable because as usual the NDA retained the power and Nitish Kumar is once again expected to retain the CM chair.Surprising because new, youthful faces such as Chirag Paswan and Maithili Thakur played decisive, complementary roles that helped NDA push past the 200-seat mark.The lesson from this election is clear - in Bihar’s complex social landscape, a mix of experienced leaders, steady welfare delivery and energetic young faces has proved more effective than relying only on old popularity or only on youth-driven politics.Despite the surge of young voters, the new Bihar Assembly has actually grown older — with the average MLA age rising to 53, according to data from the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR).Bihar’s demographics set the stage for an assumed Gen Z breakthrough. The state is young: nearly 57–58% of the population is under 25 and Gen Z accounts for roughly 25% of registered voters.Yet the ballot did not produce a wholesale generational turnover. Voter turnout rose to 67.13%, the highest since 1951, but the assembly that emerges remains led by established figures.The paradox points to a deeper truth: youth ambitions are powerful as a narrative, but they need organisation, welfare credibility and cross-cutting alliances to translate into seats.Nitish Kumar’s appeal rested on delivery and familiarity. His long record including infrastructure, electrification, women-centred schemes and visible rural services have converted into voter trust, especially among families worried about daily survival and local governance.That credibility was amplified by BJP’s organisational muscle power and national messaging, producing a coalition that combined administrative reputation with ground-level reach.But this was not a victory of seniority alone. The NDA’s seat haul hinged on a deliberate fusion of styles: the steady administrative image of Nitish; BJP’s organisational discipline and PM Modi’s national appeal and the insurgent energy of newer coalition partners.Chirag Paswan’s description of himself as “sabji mein namak” captured the strategic role he played.The Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) won 19 of the 29 seats it contested, a performance that materially pushed the NDA beyond the 200-seat threshold.More striking was the party’s ability to wrest seats from the Mahagathbandhan: LJP(RV) took 17 constituencies that had earlier been with the opposition, undercutting expectations about its limited reach.Chirag’s rise was not accidental. His bargaining power had roots in the 2024 Lok Sabha sweep, where his party performed strongly and in smart seat-sharing talks that gave LJP(RV) winnable contests.By winning 19 of the 29 seats it contested in assembly elections, LJP(RV)’s strike rate suggests that the party had converted local appeal into electoral returns and reasserted Chirag as a major NDA face in Bihar’s new political arithmetic.The BJP’s capture of Alinagar through Maithili Thakur underlined a different dynamic: cultural influence and youth appeal can convert into real votes when rooted in local identity and persistent outreach.The 25-year-old folk singer — a social media star and cultural ambassador for Mithilanchal has defeated RJD’s Binod Mishra and looked set to become the state’s youngest MLA.Her campaign blended grassroots outreach with a strong online following, demonstrating that youthful charisma, when allied to party structure and local ties, can win seats that long resisted the BJP. Rahul Gandhi and Tejashwi Yadav aggressively pitched themselves as the voice of young India, placing job creation, caste-based census and economic justice front and centre.Rahul’s “Voter Adhikar Yatra” also saw him raise the issue of “vote chori”, warning young voters of manipulation and urging them to defend democracyBefore the first phase of voting in Bihar, in a video message, Rahul addressed his “Gen-Z brothers and sisters” in Bihar, saying: “Tomorrow is not just a day for voting, but a day to decide the direction of Bihar’s future … Stay alert to every conspiracy and manipulation at the booths … The future of Bihar is in your hands.”Tejashwi, in particular, sought to expand his connection with first-time voters through social media-heavy messaging and large rallies projecting himself as the future of Bihar.Yet, critics argued that assurance of results mattered more than rhetoric. Prashant Kishor , once an architect of JD(U)’s electoral strategies, did not miss the opportunity to take a swipe at both sides, calling them outdated in approach and disconnected from ground realities.Kishor questioned Rahul’s deep engagement with the state. He asked, “How much knowledge does Rahul Gandhi have here? Rahul Gandhi comes here, roams around, does a couple of show-bites and then he is gone.”“When the people of Bihar are not listening to him (Rahul Gandhi), then why would Gen Z listen to him? Gen Z is not a homogeneous group in Bihar who acts on someone’s call or on the basis of their assessment,” Kishor said.New and “youth-first” political experiments, including Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj aimed to target a niche of voters through their extensive door-to-door campaigning. However, the party struggled to convert enthusiasm into booth-level performance.Changing politics in Bihar requires patient groundwork: building cadres, stitching alliances and nurturing constituency-specific strategies. A single poll cycle rarely grants instant success.Another twist in Bihar’s electoral story comes from its women voters. This year, women recorded a turnout of 71.6%, significantly higher than the 62.8% turnout among men. This creates a clear gender advantage in the NDA’s favour.Women-centric welfare measures, particularly direct cash transfers and mobility-support initiatives, played a critical role.Nitish Kumar’s long-running focus on women’s empowerment, including the Rs 10,000 direct assistance scheme, strengthened trust and reinforced a dependable female vote bank.Bihar’s verdict shows that generational change in politics can be gradual rather than revolutionary.For the NDA, the 2025 win validates a coalition approach that pairs veteran governance with youthful faces. For the opposition, the message is stark: charisma must be matched by credible welfare offerings and grassroots architecture.Bihar’s politics will stay complicated. But the 2025 election offered a lesson that is both simple and hard to achieve: in a state as socially layered as Bihar, mixed leadership with combined experience, welfare credibility and new energy is not just desirable, it is essential.","Bihar’s demographics set the stage for an assumed Gen Z breakthrough. Nearly 57–58% of the population is under 25 and Gen Z accounts for roughly 25% of registered voters. Voter turnout rose to 67.13%, the highest since 1951, but the assembly that emerges remains led by established figures.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125350250,imgsize-1188117,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

Auction Details:





In a blockbuster trade ahead of IPL 2026, Chennai Super Kings (CSK) have acquired veteran Indian wicketkeeper-batter Sanju Samson from Rajasthan Royals (RR), while sending Men in Yellow legend Ravindra Jadeja and Sam Curran to RR. This move marks one of the biggest trade deals in IPL history.CSK Managing Director Kasi Viswanathan described the decision to part ways with Jadeja as one of the toughest the franchise has faced. “We felt the need for a top-order Indian batsman, and since not many Indian batsmen will be available at the auction, the trade window was the best option. Leaving Jaddu was extremely difficult given his contribution to CSK’s success over the years,” Viswanathan said in a video released by the team.Jadeja, who represented RR in 2008-09 and CSK from 2012 to 2025 (with brief stints at Kochi Tuskers Kerala and Gujarat Lions), leaves as CSK’s leading wicket-taker with 143 scalps in 186 matches and their highest run-getter in IPL history with 2,198 runs.CSK will have ₹43.4 crore left to spend at the IPL 2026 mega auction. They have 9 slots remaining to fill in the upcoming season. With the inclusion of Samson, their top order is settled, but they will look for middle-order batters and spinners in the auction, having let go of Jadeja and with Ashwin already retired.","Chennai Super Kings (CSK) have acquired veteran Indian wicketkeeper-batter Sanju Samson from Rajasthan Royals (RR), while sending Men in Yellow legend Ravindra Jadeja and Sam Curran to RR.

As the 2026 Indian Premier League (IPL) approaches, Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) enter another defining phase in their brief but eventful journey. Since joining the league in 2022, the franchise has experienced early playoff highs, difficult downturns, and seasons shaped by injuries, form slumps and constant rebuilding.Their campaigns have often revolved around sharp pace bowling, tactical flexibility and a core that mixed promising youth with seasoned performers. But the last season exposed significant gaps, especially in the fast-bowling group, forcing LSG back to the drawing board as they prepare for a crucial reset ahead of IPL 2026.In the previous campaign, Australia's Mitchell Marsh top scored for the the side with 627 runs in 13 matches - the joint-lowest in terms of matches played among the top 10 players with most runs last season. Surprisingly, no other player found room in the top 10, despite an explosive start from Nicholas Pooran, who ended the campaign on 524 in 14 games.Skipper Rishabh Pant , who was also the most expensive, ended the campaign with just 269 runs in 14 matches. He was brought to the side for a mammoth Rs 27 crore.LSG's bowlers were far from their best too, as no bowler found spot among the top 10 wicket takers. In fact, it was Digvesh Rathi who led the pack with 14 wickets from 13 matches.The franchise's focus will be on doing better in this department as they finalize their retentions and releases and head to the auction.LSG will go into the auction with a purse of Rs 22.9 crore, and they will look to buy an overseas pacer and backup spin-bowling all-rounders.

As the 2026 Indian Premier League approaches, Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) enter the new season with a long history of strong squads, heavy expectations and a fan base that has remained one of the most loyal in the tournament.Their journey across seasons has swung between high-scoring spectacles, deep playoff pushes and repeated attempts to secure the league’s most elusive prize.That pursuit finally ended with their title breakthrough last season. RCB produced one of their most complete campaigns, driven by consistent top-order runs, reliable middle-overs control and a bowling group that delivered in pressure situations.Several players stood out through the year, forming the spine of the championship run and shaping the core the team now carries into 2026.Virat Kohli led the charge with 657 runs, producing eight half-centuries, that too, all in wins, and setting the tone with his aggressive approach in the powerplay. Phil Salt complemented him with rapid starts of his own, striking at 175.98 and consistently breaking open the first six overs.Rajat Patidar’s return as captain added stability, with crucial early-season half-centuries in important away wins that helped steady the side’s route to the final.Their bowling unit matched the batting group’s impact as well. Josh Hazlewood’s 22 wickets, including decisive powerplay bursts and death-overs control, turned tight games in RCB’s favour, while Krunal Pandya’s 17 wickets and late-order utility added balance.Jitesh Sharma and Romario Shepherd provided the finishing punch, delivering high-impact cameos in must-win situations. The abundance of match-winners across departments became the defining trait of RCB's campaign and the backbone of their climb to the title.The win also marked a shift in the side’s approach. After years of depending heavily on individual brilliance, RCB’s 2025 campaign was built on a collective effort, with contributions spread across departments. Their late-season surge, which carried them through the playoffs and into the final, highlighted that shift and has now become the base for their upcoming plans.The focus now shifts to building around the title-winning team. The retained core offers experience and consistency, while younger players who impressed in the previous season add depth.: Rs 16.4 crore: 8 (2 overseas)RCB, the defending champions, will have Rs 16.4 crore going into the auction, but they already have a settled playing eleven and would only look to solidify themselves by adding backups.",Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) won the IPL 2025 title. RCB will have a squad of 16 going into the 2026 IPL auction. The defending champions will be looking to retain their crown. The IPL 2026 auction will take place in Bangalore on May 26.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125330698,imgsize-268532,width-400,resizemode-4/2025-ipl-final-royal-challengers-bengaluru-v-punjab-kings.jpg"

AUCTION BUDGET:





As the 2026 Indian Premier League draws closer, Punjab Kings will look to bounce back from the heartbreak of the previous season and launch a renewed campaign for their maiden IPL trophy. Under the leadership of Shreyas Iyer, PBKS came agonisingly close in IPL 2025, falling just six runs short against Royal Challengers Bengaluru in a thrilling final. Despite the defeat, Punjab’s performance throughout the season reflected significant improvement and marked one of their strongest campaigns in recent years.In IPL 2025, Punjab Kings finished at the top of the points table, showcasing remarkable consistency. They won 10 of their 17 matches, with six losses and one no-result, registering an impressive win percentage of 63.64%. Their journey to the final included a confident victory over Mumbai Indians in Qualifier 2, reinforcing their status as one of the most balanced and competitive sides of the season.The 2025 squad featured a strong mix of experienced international stars and promising young Indian talent. Led by Shreyas Iyer, the squad included dynamic players like Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Josh Inglis and Marco Jansen, while homegrown talents such as Prabhsimran Singh, Arshdeep Singh, Harpreet Brar, Shashank Singh and Nehal Wadhera played pivotal roles.Rising names like Xavier Bartlett, Priyansh Arya, Musheer Khan and Suryansh Shedge added depth and energy to the lineup. This combination of youth and experience was one of the biggest strengths of PBKS in 2025.The franchise’s historical performance in the IPL highlights its inconsistent yet occasionally brilliant journey. As Kings XI Punjab, the team enjoyed strong seasons in 2008 and 2014, finishing as semi-finalists and runners-up respectively. However, they also endured several years at the bottom of the table. After rebranding to Punjab Kings in 2021, the team’s fortunes fluctuated but eventually surged in 2025 when they topped the league standings and finished as runners-up—signalling a resurgence under new leadership.The table of past seasons clearly reflects the team’s evolution: a mix of mid-table finishes, a few disappointing campaigns, and standout years where they looked like title contenders. The dramatic turnaround in 2025 stands out as their best finish since the famous 2014 season.Shreyas Iyer (c), Nehal Wadhera, Priyansh Arya, Prabhsimran Singh, Shashank Singh, Pyla Avinash, Harnoor Pannu, Musheer Khan, Vishnu Vinod, Marcus Stoinis, Azmatullah Omarzai, Suryansh Shedge, Mitchell Owen, Arshdeep Singh, Vijaykumar Vyshak, Yash Thakur, Xavier Bartlett, Lockie Ferguson, Yuzvendra Chahal, Harpreet BrarGlenn Maxwell, Josh Inglis, Aaron Hardie, Kuldeep Sen, Praveen DubeyRs 11.50 crore is left for Punjab to spend in the upcoming auction, and they have the second-lowest purse going into the auction after Mumbai Indians.","Punjab Kings are bidding for their maiden IPL trophy in the 2026 season.

How are Ty Gretzky, Sara Gretzky, and rest of the Wayne Gretzky family staying in the spotlight?







Wayne Gretzky's son, Ty Gretzky created an Instagram post that was both very emotional and very beautiful to celebrate Sara Gretzky’s birthday, and the post was immediately accepted by the fans. Rather than a plain message, Ty wrote a carousel that combined love and tenderness with nostalgia and spontaneous family cuteness, giving the relationship of Sara with their daughters—Sicily and Vienna—the first place. The tribute began with an outdoor picture of Sara on the ground with both girls on her lap, a situation that showed the softness and comfort of their daily family life. The carousel then took one through different scenes that were at the same time close and grand, echoing a year that was full of memories, and which Ty was very fond of.The post went on with seasonal pictures, one of which was taken in a holiday-decorated porch where Sara, in winter clothes, had the girls snuggled up to her. A video where she was having fun dancing with Sicily and Vienna was also shown, and this was the moment Ty emphasized in his writing, telling her to ""Never stop dancing with the girls."" He counterpoised the lively moments with quiet, warm family life scenes—like a movie theater selfie where Sara was cuddling Ty and one daughter was posing dramatically with popcorn.A dinner outing photo showed Sara assisting one of the girls in blowing out the candles on a dessert while behind them, festive lights were shining. More pictures portrayed a palm-tree-lined plaza walk, the clouds at a beach, and a hotel hallway scene behind a double stroller, reminding the public that the family's happiness spreads wherever they go.Ty and Sara, who were married in 2020 with a modern Gatsby-inspired ceremony in Brooklyn, had a baby named Sicily in 2021 and another one, Vienna, in 2023. The hockey legend’s son, Ty, is personally responsible for his coaching capacity in Gretzky Hockey School, which means he is staying involved with the development of youngsters. On the other hand, Wayne Gretzky finished a busy international tour recently, according to Canadian media. He was in Scotland and Slovakia, for instance, meeting Karen Mollica, the ambassador, and attending a leadership conference in Bratislava, where he also signed T-shirts for kids. This trip followed the 2025 Alfred Dunhill Links Championship that he attended with his son-in-law, Dustin Johnson.Ty Gretzky’s touching tribute shone the spotlight on Sara’s pivotal role in the family, but also revealed the close, worldwide rhythm of the Gretzkys. The family had a celebration full of love, connection, and memories that the fans undeniably accepted.More coverage on NHL","Wayne Gretzky's son, Ty, created an Instagram post that was both very emotional and very beautiful.

Candace Owens explains her list of “verifiable lies” told after Charlie Kirk’s assassination





Image via Candace/Podcast

She said the first lie was the story that Mikey McCoy had “blood all over him.” She said this story was made up and was told by Pastor Rob McCoy.

The second lie, she said, came from Alex Clark and Andrew Kolvet. She said they pushed a story that Charlie Kirk was a “committed evangelical” who only liked Catholic buildings. Owens said this was not true.

The third lie was a strange story that Charlie Kirk’s “strong bones” stopped a 30-06 bullet. She said Andrew Kolvet pushed this and that it made no sense.

The fourth lie, she said, was the claim that Charlie “never blinked” in his support for Israel. Owens said this was not true.

For the fifth lie, she said TPUSA told people that Mikey McCoy first called his dad during the crisis. Owens said this story was also false.

The sixth lie was about Terryl Farnsworth, the AV worker. She said TPUSA claimed police told him to remove cameras. Owens said her video review shows this did not happen.

The seventh lie was the claim that Farnsworth moved SD cards because “people were stealing them.” She said this made no sense because SD cards are cheap and cameras are expensive.

The eighth lie came from Alex Clark, who said there was “no bad blood” between Ben Shapiro and Charlie Kirk. Owens said that was “propaganda.”

The ninth lie was that TPUSA’s yearly audits proved nothing odd. Candace Owens said this was misleading because Doge worked differently from normal TPUSA work.

The tenth lie was calling Mikey McCoy a “hero.” Candace Owens said this was not fair because he did not call 911 right away.





Candace Owens spoke on her podcast on November 13, 2025. She said she found ten “verifiable lies” that she believes Turning Point USA (TPUSA) told after Charlie Kirk was killed. Charlie Kirk was shot in the neck on September 10, 2025, at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. The next day, 22-year-old Tyler James Robinson was arrested for the shooting. Owens said she will keep talking about this case because she feels she is getting “very close” to the real truth, and she believes some people at TPUSA are upset with her for this.In her show, Candace Owens said TPUSA gave wrong or confusing stories about what happened that day. She said some stories made people sound more heroic, more loyal, or more important than they really were. She also said some stories changed facts about Charlie Kirk, his beliefs, his staff, and what happened at the scene.Candace Owens then shared the ten lies she says TPUSA spread. She said her list is not final, but these were the lies she wanted to clear up right now.Candace Owens said she will keep talking about the Charlie Kirk case on her Candace podcast.Also Read: Candace Owens And Allie Beth Stuckey Spark Big Drama As New Words On Charlie Kirk Assassination Go Viral","Candace Owens spoke on her podcast on November 13, 2025.

Upper-body setback sidelines Seth Jarvis for Carolina Hurricanes



More coverage on NHL:





The Carolina Hurricanes experienced a concerning moment on Friday night when forward Seth Jarvis was forced to leave the game due to an upper-body setback. During a play behind the net, Jarvis was struck near the eye by teammate Andrei Svechnikov’s high stick. He did not return for the remainder of the first period, with the team listing the incident as an upper-body issue. The play was sudden and highlighted the physical intensity of NHL games, even in routine situations.Jarvis has been a key contributor for Carolina this season, entering the night with 10 goals and five assists through 16 games. At 23 years old, his offensive production has been integral to the Hurricanes’ early-season performance, and his temporary absence may affect line rotations and scoring depth. Known for his speed, vision, and scoring ability, Jarvis has emerged as one of Carolina’s most promising young forwards.Injuries involving the upper body, particularly near the eye, are taken seriously due to their potential impact on a player’s vision, mobility, and overall performance. Carolina’s coaching and medical staff are monitoring his condition closely, focusing on a cautious approach to ensure full recovery.Even a short absence can influence team dynamics, and the Hurricanes are likely to make tactical adjustments to maintain offensive balance while he recovers.The incident underscores the physical risks inherent in professional hockey, where even routine plays can have unexpected consequences. Carolina’s depth chart may need adjustments while Jarvis is unavailable, with other forwards stepping into increased responsibilities. His experience and familiarity with the team’s systems will be missed, but the organization is prepared to adapt while evaluating the full extent of his setback. Updates on Jarvis’ status are expected in the coming days as the Hurricanes’ medical team continues its assessment.Additionally, this injury could influence upcoming matchups as the Hurricanes manage their roster and line combinations. Coaching staff may adjust strategies, modify power-play and penalty-kill units, and shift responsibilities among forwards to compensate for Jarvis’ absence. Maintaining offensive consistency without Jarvis will be a priority, while ensuring he receives proper care to return at full strength.","Seth Jarvis was struck near the eye by teammate Andrei Svechnikov's high stick.

How the Proposed Trade Structure Appears

Why the Boston Red Sox Are Interested in Greene

Why the Reds Would Consider Trading Their Ace

Who Benefits Most?





The 2025 MLB offseason has already sparked its share of high-profile rumors, and one of the most talked-about possibilities centers on a potential blockbuster between the Boston Red Sox and the Cincinnati Reds. Several league insiders indicate that Boston is actively exploring moves to strengthen its rotation, and Cincinnati’s electric young ace Hunter Greene has quickly become one of the most discussed names on their radar.As speculation intensifies, the Boston Red Sox are believed to be constructing a competitive package that appeals to the Reds’ long-term offensive needs. Outfielder Wilyer Abreu, coming off a strong 2025 campaign, sits at the core of these discussions, with multiple prospects also viewed as realistic components of a multilateral deal.The rumored framework would send Greene and veteran catcher Jose Trevino to Boston. Cincinnati, in turn, would acquire Abreu along with promising young talents Franklin Arias and Jhostnyxon Garcia.• Red Sox Receive: Hunter Greene (RHP), Jose Trevino (C)• Reds Receive: Wilyer Abreu (OF), Franklin Arias (Prospect), Jhostnyxon Garcia (Prospect)This setup aligns with a familiar MLB pattern: a contending team adds a high-end pitcher with years of control, while a retooling team brings in a controllable offensive piece and valuable farm-system depth.Greene, 26, is coming off an elite showing in 2025, posting a 2.76 ERA, 0.94 WHIP, and a dominant 31.4% strikeout rate while averaging 99.4 mph on his fastball. Though he missed over two months with injuries, his ceiling remains one of the highest among young pitchers. His contract - six years at $53 million with team options - adds to his value, giving Boston an affordable potential ace to anchor its rotation. Trevino’s defensive abilities and leadership further strengthen the Boston Red Sox catching core.Cincinnati’s interest in Abreu is tied to their need for offensive upgrades. The team ranked 24th in Weighted Runs Created Plus and 21st in home runs in 2025, making an impact bat a priority. Abreu, age 26, hit .246 with an .810 OPS and 22 home runs last season. His defense grades in the 90th percentile, though he led MLB with five errors. Arias and Garcia add long-term upside and organizational depth, giving the Reds a more balanced roster outlook.Also read: MLB trade rumors: New York Yankees could sign $102 million New York Mets megastar to bolster squad and improve title odds The Boston Red Sox gains immediately with a frontline pitcher, assuming Greene stays healthy and performs at a Cy Young-level trajectory. Cincinnati, meanwhile, strengthens its lineup and replenishes its prospect pool, potentially laying groundwork for sustained improvement. The ultimate winner depends on performance and development, but the deal presents meaningful benefits for both franchises as the offseason unfolds.","The Boston Red Sox and Cincinnati Reds are rumored to be in talks over a 2025 trade.

More coverage on NFL WAGs:





The electric connection between Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski echoes the dynamic spark we see today with Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce, offering a vivid lens for comparison. Brady, a seven-time Super Bowl legend, closed out his storied career with three seasons in Tampa Bay, hanging up his cleats as a Buccaneer in 2023. Gronkowski, never far from the spotlight, first retired from the New England Patriots in March 2019, only to be lured back by Brady for a Tampa Bay reunion. Their partnership delivered fourth Super Bowl win before Gronkowski announced his second retirement in June 2022. But was his heart truly at rest? Perhaps not, since he rewrote his retirement script. On November 12, Rob Gronkowski signed a ceremonial one-day contract with New England at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, so he could officially retire as a Patriot after 11 total NFL seasons. Witnessing this emotional homecoming, his longtime partner and SI Swimsuit star Camille Kostek celebrated on Instagram , sharing 11 photos, one supposedly for each season, and declaring him a “Patriot for life.”The first snapshot was taken inside Gillette Stadium, likely from the Patriots' office. The NFL couple stood in business casuals before a backdrop of Gronkowski’s moments as a Patriots player. Camille Kostek wore a dark denim blue co-ord set with a denim shirt and matching wide-legged trousers. Her medium-length wavy blond hair was left down. She wore glossy peach lipstick, blush, and prominent kohl on the corners of her eyes, along with big, round gold earrings.Gronkowski wore a navy-blue suit with a white collared shirt and brown and white shoes. He had a thin goatee and a spiked army cut.The next snapshot showed them with Patriots owner Robert Kraft, who appeared to be signing his one-day contract. Another image showed the Gillette Stadium Jumbotron displaying a big message: “THANK YOU GRONK,” with Patriots’ Super Bowl championship banners above, commemorating six victories. Other images included the four-time Super Bowl champion in an interview or photoshoot, the stadium in its raw form, and Gronkowski chatting with current head coach Mike Vrabel. The coach and the tight end never played together, as Gronkowski was drafted a year before Vrabel was traded. Vrabel played linebacker for the Patriots from 2001 to 2008. The last image is the cutest, featuring the couple’s French bulldog, Ralphie Gronkowski, whom Rob and Camille adopted in February 2021. Ralphie lies comfortably on a sofa, wearing a Patriots jersey.BBC Sport's Sean Kearns reported that Rob Gronkowski fulfilled the dying wish of his friend and charity partner, Susan Hurley, who was also a former Patriots cheerleader and founded CharityTeams in 2008, by signing a one-day contract with the New England Patriots. Hurley died from cancer earlier this month, and before she passed way, she publicly requested Gronkowski to return to the Patriots.","Gronkowski signed a ceremonial one-day contract with New England at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, on November 12.

Seahawks mourn Kenny Easley: Hall of Fame safety dies at 66, cause still not public



Dialysis three times a week





A full kidney transplant in 1990





A long recovery that forced him to rebuild his life away from football





More coverage from NFL:







When news broke that Seattle Seahawks legend Kenny Easley had passed away at 66, the NFL world felt the shock instantly. Fans, former teammates, and Hall of Fame members all reacted with the same heavy silence because the Enforcer wasn’t just a player. He was a presence. And now that voice is gone.Easley died on November 14, 2025, according to confirmations from the Pro Football Hall of Fame and his family. But one crucial detail remains unknown: no cause of death has been released.And that mystery has left many revisiting the long, difficult health journey that shaped Easley’s life long after he left the field.But what we do know is this: no official source has linked his death to any past health condition. Until the family or medical authorities release more information, the cause of death remains undisclosed.This silence has left fans wondering especially because Easley had a well-documented medical history that dramatically changed the course of his life.Long before his Hall of Fame induction, Easley suffered through one of the toughest medical battles an athlete can face.In the late 1980s, he was diagnosed with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome, a severe kidney disorder that ultimately ended his NFL career at just 28 years old.At the time, it shocked the league, he was in his prime, playing at an elite level, and widely considered one of the greatest safeties of his generation.The situation grew more painful when Easley later revealed the underlying cause. In a lawsuit, he claimed that excessive ibuprofen use, a common pain-management routine in the NFL had worsened his kidney failure.His life quickly turned into a medical fight:Even after the transplant, he carried the weight of that diagnosis for decades. Easley’s medical battles didn’t stop with the kidney transplant.In 2016, he underwent triple-bypass heart surgery, another major challenge that could have easily knocked him down. But in true Kenny Easley fashion, he bounced back, showing up for Seahawks events, supporting charitable causes, and remaining a powerful voice in the Seattle community.But even then, he stayed private about his health. And that privacy continues today, with his family choosing not to release the cause of death.His death at 66 leaves behind unanswered questions, yes. But it also leaves behind an undeniable legacy, a reminder that greatness doesn’t always last long, but it always lasts loud.","Easley died on November 14, 2025, according to confirmations from the Pro Football Hall of Fame and his family.

Former NBA star Patrick Beverley has landed himself in hot water. The Houston Rockets alum generated waves in the NBA world after he was arrested for a felony assault charge in Texas. According to the latest update on Beverley’s felony arrest, the former point guard was charged for assault on a family member or household member impeding breath or circulation, falling under the third-degree felony.According to a post made by Patrick Beverley, he was detained at the Fort Bend County Sheriff’s Office in Richmond, Texas. The incident has diverted widespread media attention as his little sister, Mya Beverley, lies at the center of the matter. As reported by reputed media outlets, he found his sister with an 18-year-old man in the middle of the night, which got the former NBA star “understandably concerned.” Here is everything you need to know about Patrick Beverley’s little sister, Mya Beverley.Patrick Beverley’s life has always been more than basketball. The Lakers’ alum has always been around his close knit family irrespective of his NBA duties. Amidst all the ups and downs in his life, Patrick’s sister Mya has always been around him. However, little did he know that one day his sister would lead to his arrest based on severe charges.According to a post shared by Patrick a few hours after his arrest, “Please don’t believe everything you see on the internet. Hope all is well, Luv.” The 37-year-old former NBA star’s attorney Letitia Quinones-Hollins, even clarified the entire matter via a statement, which mentioned,“Patrick Beverley has no criminal record. He cares deeply about his little sister—a young lady, a minor.Given that, when he unexpectedly found Mya alone in the home with an 18-year-old man in the middle of the night, he was understandably concerned, as any brother would be about his sister.

New Orleans Pelicans front office ends Willie Green’s tenure hours after reviewing the team’s direction





The New Orleans Pelicans made a clear and firm decision when they fired Willie Green only hours after a 118-104 home loss to the Los Angeles Lakers on November 14. The move came after a start that did not meet the standards of a team coming off a 49-33 season. New Orleans opened 0-6 and became the first team in NBA history to lose three of its first six games by at least 30 points. The team also allowed 120 points or more in each of its first five games, marking the worst defensive opening in franchise history.These results left little room for interpretation. The performance level was not close to what the roster was built for, and the front office responded. Willie Green addressed the pressure earlier in the season and spoke about staying focused on the players, but the issues remained the same across multiple games. If you look at how the season went, the firing was based strictly on the on-court product and the urgent need to change direction. The Pelicans acted decisively because the stats from the early weeks supported a major adjustment.Pelicans Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations Joe Dumars delivered the news in a statement released by the team on Saturday morning. ""After careful evaluation, we have made the difficult decision to make a change at head coach,"" Dumars said in the official announcement.He added, ""I have the utmost respect for Willie Green, and I’m sincerely appreciative of his contributions to the Pelicans organization and the New Orleans community. We wish him and his family all the best in the future.""Team owner Gayle Benson backed the move in a separate statement issued the same day. ""I have tremendous admiration and respect for Willie Green, and I truly appreciate all he has done for our organization over the last few years,"" Benson said. ""This is a tough business and these are difficult decisions.""In a recent interview prior to the firing, Benson had expressed urgency about the team's direction, ""We need to improve immediately. Our roster is built for success right now."" She also reiterated her confidence in Dumars, stating, ""I really like Willie Green, but I hired Joe Dumars to assess our basketball operation. And that’s what he is doing.""Dumars had previously defended retaining Green after a disappointing 21-61 finish in the 2024-25 season, the second-worst record in franchise history for an 82-game campaign. Speaking to media in May 2025, Dumars said, ""I'm looking forward to going forward and working with Willie and to push us to success. You've got to set the bar. And that's what we're going to do."" He focused on the desired style of play, adding, ""The style of play — resilience, toughness, playing hard, never quit — that’s what we want people to see right away. ""The New Orleans Pelicans were done hoping the same approach would fix itself. Willie Green had four-plus seasons and two playoff runs, but the early problems kept repeating. Add injuries to Zion Williamson and Dejounte Murray, and the team looked stuck again. Putting James Borrego in charge is their attempt to wake the roster up before the season gets even harder to recover from.Also Read: Stephen Curry seen rocking Nike just a day after ending his Under Armour partnership in a match against San Antonio Spurs",New Orleans Pelicans front office ends Willie Green's tenure hours after reviewing the team’s direction.

But the years after brought turbulence. Between 2021 and 2023, SRH endured some of their toughest campaigns, finishing in the bottom three each season.The turning point arrived in 2024, when Pat Cummins’s aggressive leadership and a revamped squad powered SRH to a spectacular resurgence.They shattered the all-time IPL score twice, dominated with an explosive top order, and reached the final, eventually finishing runners-up to Kolkata Knight Riders. The momentum faltered in 2025, a season marked by inconsistency, but SRH still clawed their way to a respectable 6th-place finish after a late surge.Now, heading into IPL 2026, the franchise stands at another crucial moment. With key retentions shaping the core and a blend of experience, youth, and firepower, SRH look ready to script their next chapter, one that aims to reclaim playoff stability and push once again for the title.Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Aniket Verma, B Smaran, Ishan Kishan, Heinrich Klaasen, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Harsh Dubey, Kamindu Mendis, Harshal Patel, Brydon Carse, Pat Cummins, Jaydev Unadkat, Eshan Malinga, Zeeshan AnsariAbhinav Manohar, Atharva Taide, Sachin Baby, Wiaan Mulder, Mohammed Shami, Smarjeet Singh, Rahul Chahar, Adam ZampaSRH will enter the auction with a purse of ₹25.5 crore and will look to strengthen their spin-bowling department.

As the countdown to the 2026 Indian Premier League (IPL) begins, the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) arrive at the new season carrying one of the league’s most colourful and fluctuating histories, marked by iconic title wins, bold leadership calls, dramatic rebuilds and, most recently, a return to dominance.Since the league’s inception, KKR have embodied unpredictability and flair, evolving from an underperforming side in the early years to a powerhouse capable of producing match-winners across disciplines.Their transformation began with the Gautam Gambhir era, which delivered two IPL titles in 2012 and 2014, redefining the team’s culture around aggression, discipline and tactical clarity.The seasons that followed brought mixed fortunes, with playoff appearances sprinkled between rebuilding phases. From 2015 to 2020, KKR remained competitive but inconsistent, often hovering around the mid-table as they tried to rediscover their title-winning balance.A significant shift came with the emergence of a new leadership and coaching setup, laying the foundation for their remarkable 2024 campaign.That season, KKR’s powerful all-round squad, explosive batting line-up and sharp bowling attack propelled them to the IPL title, defeating Sunrisers Hyderabad in a commanding final, re-establishing the franchise as a top-tier force.The 2025 season, though filled with intense battles and flashes of brilliance, didn’t replicate the previous year’s highs. KKR experienced ups and downs throughout the tournament, but retained a strong core and continued developing young talent, finishing mid-table and setting the stage for another rebuild.Now, with IPL 2026 on the horizon, KKR enter a crucial phase. Their retention decisions reflect a balanced approach, backing proven match-winners while nurturing the next generation, as they aim to reclaim their crown and push for another deep title run.Ajinkya Rahane, Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Anukul Roy, Harshit Rana, Manish Pandey, Ramandeep Singh, Rinku Singh, Rovman Powell, Sunil Narine, Umran Malik, Vaibhav Arora, Varun ChakaravarthyAndre Russell, Venkatesh Iyer, Quinton de Kock, Moeen Ali, Anrich Nortje, Mayank Markande (traded out).KKR will have a lot of work to do at the auction and will be the busiest of all franchises.

Players Released by DC Ahead of IPL 2026 Auction







NEW DELHI: Delhi Capitals on Friday unveiled their retained and released player lists ahead of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2026 auction, scheduled later this year. The franchise has retained 17 players from the squad that finished fifth last season.After internal reviews and discussions, the Capitals have released Mohit Sharma, Faf du Plessis, Sediqullah Atal, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Manvanth Kumar and Darshan Nalkande ahead of the upcoming edition.Core players retained include Axar Patel, KL Rahul, Kuldeep Yadav, Mitchell Starc and Tristan Stubbs. The squad has also been bolstered by the arrival of Nitish Rana, who joins DC in a trade that sees Donovan Ferreira move to Rajasthan Royals.Delhi finished fifth in IPL 2025 and failed to make it past the league stage, continuing a trend of inconsistency that has held the franchise back in recent years.With a talented squad and a history of occasional brilliance, DC will look to rebuild momentum and return to the playoffs in IPL 2026.In the 2025 season, Delhi Capitals played 14 matches, winning seven, losing six, and registering one no result. Their win percentage of 50.00% reflects a season where they showed sparks of promise but lacked the sustained dominance needed to secure a top-four finish.While the team delivered some commanding performances with both bat and ball, crucial moments in key matches cost them valuable points.A look at Delhi Capitals’ historical performance in the IPL provides a clearer picture of their fluctuating journey. The table of their year-wise standings shows a franchise with high peaks but equally deep troughs. DC made impressive runs in the early years, finishing as semi-finalists in 2008 and topping the league stage in 2009 before another semifinal exit. Their best phase came between 2019 and 2021, where they reached the playoffs twice and finished runners-up in 2020—their closest shot at a maiden IPL trophy.However, the table also reveals several disappointing seasons, particularly between 2013 and 2018, where they consistently finished in the bottom half, including last place in 2013, 2014 and 2018. Post-2021, the Capitals again slipped into inconsistency, finishing 5th, 9th and 6th between 2022 and 2024. The fifth-place finish in 2025 continued this pattern, showcasing a team capable of competing but unable to convert opportunities.Overall, the standings table highlights Delhi Capitals’ inconsistency: strong runs followed by sudden declines. Their runner-up finish in 2020 stands out as the franchise's best-ever campaign, but they have struggled to replicate that form since.Heading into IPL 2026, the Capitals will look to address these inconsistencies and build a squad capable of returning to playoff contention. With a fresh approach and renewed focus, Delhi will hope that the upcoming season marks the beginning of a stronger, more stable era.Delhi Capitals IPL 2026 Retentions: Complete Squad OverviewTristan StubbsSameer RizviKarun NairDonovan Ferreira (Trade)Nitish Rana (Trade – Rs 4.2 Cr)Jake Fraser-McGurkKL RahulAbhishek PorelALL-ROUNDERSAxar PatelAayush BadoniVicky OstwalMahipal LomrorTripuranha VijayAjay MandalManav SutharKuldeep YadavMitchell StarcMukesh KumarTushar DeshpandeT NatarajanDarshan NalkandeMohit SharmaRs 21.8 Cr8 (5 Overseas)Mohit SharmaFaf du PlessisSediqullah AtalJake Fraser-McGurkManvanth KumarDarshan NalkandeDonovan Ferreira (traded out)DC will enter the auction with Rs 21.8 crore.

Drake Maye and the New England Patriots kept their win streak alive on Thursday night, pushing it to eight with a steady victory over the New York Jets. While Maye delivered another controlled performance on the field, it was his wife Ann who drew plenty of attention in the stands. Her outfit for the primetime matchup was far from her usual Patriots-themed style, which made fans even more curious as she revealed the story behind it.Maye threw for 281 yards, added a touchdown, and scrambled for 26 more as New England secured a 27-14 win against a struggling Jets team. The temperature at Gillette Stadium dropped into the low 40s, and that alone shaped Ann’s look. She has become a familiar presence at Patriots games, often going all-in on team colors, whether in bright red or deep New England blue. Her near-wardrobe mishap from a previous outing had already made headlines, and her growing popularity on social media, especially on her cooking TikTok, has only amplified the attention around her game-day fits.For the TNF game, Ann Maye ditched the Patriots palette and chose warmth over theme, telling fans in her TikTok video, “It’s cold, so we are working with what we got.” She followed it up with another candid line that fans immediately latched onto: “I know it’s brown and brown like has nothing to do with the Patriots, but I think it’s going to be really warm and I think it’s going to be a fun statement winter coat.”She showcased the look from the stadium, proving that practicality can still stand out. With New England now sitting at 9-2 and eyeing a playoff run that could stretch deep into January, staying warm will only get more important. Fans are already wondering what Ann might choose once true winter hits and the stakes rise even higher.Drake and Ann’s story has long been part of their charm. The couple met in middle school, both attended UNC, and even shared connections on the field through Ann’s brother Tad, who played quarterback with Maye. Their June 2025 wedding marked a new chapter, and today Ann stands as his strongest Patriots supporter, even when she leaves the team colors at home.","Drake Maye and the New England Patriots beat the New York Jets 27-14 on Thursday night.

Jack Hughes' injury puts Devils' momentum and Olympic hopes in spotlight



More NHL coverage

New Jersey Devils fans woke up to news they did not expect. Star forward Jack Hughes is out with a “non-hockey” hand injury, the team confirmed on Friday, Nov. 14. The announcement caught everyone by surprise because Hughes has been one of the brightest players in the league this season and a major reason behind New Jersey’s strong start. The team said he was still being evaluated and that “more details would be provided when they become available,” leaving the situation open to worry and speculation.Reports soon painted a clearer, yet stranger, picture. According to Sportsnet insider Elliotte Friedman, the injury happened during a team dinner on Thursday night. ESPN called it a “freak accident,” and early information suggests Hughes slipped and cut his hand. It may sound small, but the cut is serious enough to keep him out for at least one game. As odd as it seems, the dinner reportedly included Barstool Sports personality Frank “The Tank” Fleming, based on a social media post. That twist only added to the buzz around the incident.The timing of the Jack Hughes injury could not be more frustrating for New Jersey. Hughes has been electric this season, producing a team-high 10 goals and 20 points in 17 games for the Eastern Conference leaders.It is the strong comeback the team hoped for after he needed season-ending shoulder surgery last March. That injury came after he crashed into the boards, ending what had already been a disrupted stretch in which he missed 20 games in each of the previous two seasons.At 24, Hughes is entering his prime, and his play reflects that. He posted a team-record 99 points in 2022-23 and is widely considered a lock for Team USA’s Olympic roster. Any setback now raises questions not just for the Devils but also for his international plans. If the cut is deep or slow to heal, it could shift timelines the team had counted on.For now, the Devils and their fans must wait. The situation may have started as a rare accident at dinner, but its impact could linger far longer than the moment it happened.","New Jersey Devils forward Jack Hughes is out with a ‘non-hockey’ hand injury.

NHL news





The Chicago Blackhawks walked away from their overtime loss to the New Jersey Devils with more than a single point. They walked away with another reminder that Connor Bedard is growing into something rare. Even in a game where Chicago gave up three separate one-goal leads, Bedard still found a way to shape the night. His early strike set the tone and kept the Blackhawks in a fight they were never fully out of. On a roster missing Frank Nazar, Jason Dickinson, and Andre Burakovsky, his presence mattered even more.Spencer Knight also played a key role, turning away chance after chance to keep Chicago steady. But it was Bedard who delivered the first spark. He opened the scoring on a well-earned 5-on-3 advantage created through persistence, smart puck movement, and hard work along the boards. A sharp give-and-go with Teuvo Teravainen pulled Jacob Markstrom out of position long enough for Bedard to finish. It was another example of how quickly he can change a game.That goal pushed Bedard to four straight games with a goal and nine straight with at least one point. With 26 points, he now sits tied for second in league scoring alongside Leo Carlsson and Macklin Celebrini.His rise has caught national attention, but it was a comment on TNT that carried the most weight.""He's been absolutely spectacular."" Wayne Gretzky said of Bedard. ""It's such a pleasure to see because coming into this league at 18, you [have] all this pressure on you, you [have] all of this focus on you, you're not a very good team, you're a young team, you're rebuilding. He was front and center; he didn't back away from anybody or shy away from the media. For him to work as hard as he did in the off-season to come in and play at the level he's playing at now, he's earning his way onto Team Canada. ""When The Great One speaks that strongly, people listen. Gretzky went out of his way to mention Team Canada, suggesting he believes Bedard not only belongs but is carving out a clear path. With the pace he is setting, leaving him off would feel impossible.Gretzky later compared Bedard’s scoring play to a Larry Bird no-look pass, a nod to the creativity behind the goal. More eyes will be on him soon as Chicago heads into a Hockey Night in Canada matchup with the Toronto Maple Leafs, and the praise is only expected to grow.","Connor Bedard continues to earn praise from Wayne Gretzky.

NHL Trade Rumors: Could GM Stan Bowman push Edmonton Oilers toward a Juuse Saros deal?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-rumors-could-gm-stan-bowman-push-edmonton-oilers-toward-a-juuse-saros-deal/articleshow/125333517.cms,"Could GM Stan Bowman push Edmonton Oilers toward a Juuse Saros deal? (Image Via Twitter)

Can Edmonton Oilers actually convince the Nashville Predators to trade Juuse Saros?

“Absolutely Dynamic”: 55 Minutes of Juuse Saros Saves

At the beginning of their season, the goaltending dilemma at the Edmonton Oilers turned out to be their most important story, particularly after the humiliating 9-1 loss to the Colorado Avalanche. That loss led fans and analysts to push for GM Stan Bowman to take action immediately, and now he is under a lot of pressure to consider upgrading the goaltender position. Stuart Skinner has managed to perform better recently, and so he has received some support, but the conversation concerning if Juuse Saros could be the long-term answer still reigns in the league discussions.Interest in Saros rose when Jeff Marek first floated his name as a possible target, then insiders like Allan Mitchell and Mark Spector followed up with more detailed analyses. The biggest problem is clear: Edmonton is very close to the salary cap limit, has almost no tradable players, and Saros has only just begun the first year of an eight-year contract that carries a full no-movement clause. This situation makes any trade incredibly difficult, despite the fact that most people think that Saros would quickly bring stability to the Oilers’ most vulnerable area.The first question is whether Nashville wants to discuss things.Until now, the insider's view of the situation is that the Predators are not interested in trading Juuse Saros. Allan Mitchell mentioned that any trade would see the Nashville team retaining some salary, and allowing it to take back several players, whereas, in the case of Skinner, Frank Seravalli was not sure if Saros’ recent performance could be considered an upgrade over Skinner.The Pittsburgh Penguins, meanwhile, are figuring out how their narrative is changing. Insiders, like Josh Yohe, are saying that after the team’s surprisingly good start, players like Erik Karlsson, Rickard Rakell, and Bryan Rust are no longer going to be trade candidates — at least not as long as the team stays in the playoffs. GM Kyle Dubas will not be chasing risky rentals or sacrificing future assets, which implies he is adopting a more conservative approach compared to the previous seasons.The Oilers can only have Juuse Saros in their dreams for the moment, as all indications are that this trade is unlikely to happen — at least for now. Nashville wants to keep its goalie, and Edmonton has no room under the cap, making it more probable that the latter's next step will be aiming at a backup strengthening rather than going for a spectacular blockbuster trade.More coverage on NHL","Edmonton Oilers GM Stan Bowman is under a lot of pressure to consider upgrading the goaltender position.
